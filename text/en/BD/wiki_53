<text>Hughes Air Corporation, doing business as Hughes Airwest, was a local service carrier from 1970 to 1980 in the Western United States. It was backed by Howard Hughes&#x27; Summa Corporation. Its original name in 1968 was Air West and the air carrier was owned by Nick Bez. Hughes Airwest flew routes in the western U.S. and to several destinations in Mexico and Canada; its headquarters were on the grounds of San Francisco International Airport (SFO) in unincorporated San Mateo County, California.

With distinctive all-yellow aircraft, the company slogan was &quot;Top Banana in the West&quot;; Hughes Airwest was purchased by Republic Airlines in 1980, which in turn was merged into Northwest Airlines in 1986. Northwest Airlines was then merged into Delta Air Lines in 2010.

== History ==
On April 17, 1968, three earlier local service carriers in the western U.S. merged to form Air West:
* Pacific Air Lines, which previously operated as Southwest Airways when it was founded in 1941, was based in San Francisco, flew along the coast and California&#x27;s Central Valley, linking cities from Medford, Oregon, to southern California. Pacific operated Boeing 727-100s and Fairchild F-27s in 1968.
* Bonanza Air Lines routes reached west from its Phoenix base to southern California and north to Las Vegas, Reno, and Salt Lake City. Bonanza flew Douglas DC-9-10s and Fairchild F-27s in 1968, with a DC-9-30 on order, delivered after the merger.
* West Coast Airlines, based at Boeing Field in Seattle, served the Pacific Northwest, Idaho, Utah, Montana, and northern California. West Coast operated DC-9-10s, F-27s, and Piper Navajos in 1968.

The initial Air West fleet included Boeing 727-100s, Douglas DC-9s, Fairchild F-27s, and Piper Navajos. The first new addition to the Air West fleet was a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30, which had been ordered by Bonanza Air Lines.

Hungry for another adventure in the airline industry, TWA&#x27;s former owner Howard Hughes sought the airline in 1968, and the US$90 million deal was finalized in April 1970. Renamed Hughes Air West, its call sign became &quot;Hughes Air,&quot; and the airline expanded to several cities in the western United States, Canada, and Mexico. With the new yellow paint scheme, unveiled in September 1971, the airline began calling itself Hughes Airwest, two words instead of the initial three.

The airline participated in some movies in the 1970s, notably &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; with Clint Eastwood and Sondra Locke in 1977. Eastwood&#x27;s character arrives in Las Vegas from Phoenix on the airline and when he phones the airport for flight departure times, Locke&#x27;s character sarcastically called the airline, &quot;Air &quot;Worst&quot;.&quot; Also in 1977, the airline was operating service from both Burbank (BUR) and Orange County (SNA) to Denver (DEN) via an interchange flight agreement with the original Frontier Airlines. Hughes Airwest soon introduced its own jet service to Denver from a number of locations.

Like other local service airlines in the 1970s, Hughes Airwest eliminated many stops and opened longer routes. Service expanded to resorts in Mexico; domestic routes didn&#x27;t reach east of Utah and Arizona until Denver, Des Moines, Milwaukee, and Houston Hobby Airport were added in 1978. When it ended F-27 turboprop flights in 1979, Hughes Airwest became an all-jet airline with 727-200s, DC-9-10s, and DC-9-30s.

In September 1979, the airline was grounded for two months by a walkout by their ticket agents, reservations handlers, and office employees, who had been without a contract for over a year. During 1979, several airlines showed interest in buying Hughes Airwest, including Alaska and Allegheny, with the latter soon becoming USAir. The strike was resolved in late October and flights resumed in November. Four months later they were the target of a buyout by Republic Airlines, which was finalized on October 1, 1980, for $38.5 million. Minneapolis-based Republic had formed in July 1979 via the merger of North Central Airlines and Southern Airways, the first under airline deregulation.

Republic was acquired by Northwest Airlines in 1986, which merged into Delta Air Lines in 2010.

==Corporate affairs==
The original headquarters were in two buildings in downtown San Mateo, California, on the San Francisco peninsula.

Its new headquarters were located in San Mateo. The airline scheduled the move to a new headquarters in late August 1973; the complex was on a hill overlooking San Mateo and San Francisco Bay. The airline relocated two departments from the offices at San Francisco International Airport: flight control and reservations.

=== Livery ===
Hughes Airwest&#x27;s planes were recognizable by their banana-yellow fuselage and tail colors. Their airplanes were often dubbed &quot;flying bananas&quot; and the airline launched an advertising campaign with the catchphrase &quot;Top Banana in the West.&quot; Most nicknames given to Hughes Airwest airplanes in aviation books and magazines have to do with bananas. Apart from their all-yellow scheme, the airplanes also featured a blue logo on the vertical stabilizer (tail) that resembled three diamonds connected (possibly a reference to the initials of Howard Hughes). The name &quot;Hughes Airwest&quot;, in stylized lettering, was featured unconventionally &quot;below&quot; the front passenger windows.

This livery was devised by the southern California design firm of Mario Armond Zamparelli, following the crash of Flight 706 in June 1971, caused by a mid-air collision with a U.S. Marine Corps F-4B jet fighter near Duarte, California. In late 1971, the company launched a new marketing campaign which included new colors and repainted planes. The cabin windows also had a metallized PET film coating originally, but this proved too costly to maintain. Zamparelli also designed the uniforms of the flight attendants in the new colors, primarily in Sundance Yellow trimmed with Universe Blue.

After the sale in October 1980 the all-yellow paint scheme was gradually replaced by Republic&#x27;s white with blue and green trim. Aircraft tails bore Republic&#x27;s flying mallard, &quot;Herman the Duck.&quot;

===Air West in July 1968===
This is a list of destinations taken from the Air West system timetable dated July 1, 1968, when the merger to form Air West became effective. Cities served with jets are noted in bold. Air West was operating Boeing 727-100, Douglas DC-9-10, and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jets, as well as Fairchild F-27 turboprops and small Piper Navajo twin props at this time. The majority of the destinations on this list that did not have jet service were served with F-27 twin turboprops.

==Accidents and incidents==
===1971 – Flight 706===

On the evening of Sunday, June 6, 1971, Flight 706, a Douglas DC-9-31 collided in mid-air with a U.S. Marine Corps F-4B fighter over southern California near Duarte. All 49 on the airliner and the F-4 pilot were killed; the sole survivor was the F-4 radar intercept officer. Flight 706 had departed Los Angeles for Seattle, with five intermediate stops, the first in Salt Lake City.

===1972 – Flight 800 hijacking===
Two months after the hijacking by D. B. Cooper of Northwest Orient flight 305, Hughes Airwest was the target of a copycat hijacker in early 1972. After boarding Flight 800 at McCarran airport in Las Vegas in late morning on Thursday, January 20, 23-year-old Richard Charles LaPoint claimed he had a bomb while the plane was on the taxiway and demanded $50,000 cash, two parachutes, and a helmet. When these demands were met, 51 Reno-bound passengers and two flight attendants were released; the DC-9 departed eastward toward Denver, followed by two F-111 aircraft of the U.S. Air Force from nearby Nellis AFB. The parachutes were high-visibility and equipped with emergency locator devices.

Without a coat and in cowboy boots, the hijacker bailed out from the lower aft door over the treeless plains of northeastern Colorado in mid-afternoon. LaPoint was apprehended a few hours later, with minor injuries and very cold. The plane, with two pilots and a flight attendant on board, landed safely at Denver&#x27;s Stapleton airport at 2:55 p.m. MST. Facing potential death penalty charges for air piracy, the Vietnam veteran and former U.S. Army paratrooper was sentenced to forty years, but served less than eight, and was released from a halfway house in 1979; he died at age 60 in his native New Hampshire in 2008.

<text>Sir Cameron Anthony Mackintosh (born 17 October 1946) is a British theatrical producer and theatre owner notable for his association with many commercially successful musicals. At the height of his success in 1990, he was described as being &quot;the most successful, influential and powerful theatrical producer in the world&quot; by the &quot;New York Times&quot;. He is the producer of shows including &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;Cats&quot;, &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;Oliver!,&quot; and &quot;Hamilton.&quot;

Mackintosh was knighted in 1996 for services to musical theatre. Two of his productions, &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, are the two longest-running musicals in West End history. In 2008, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranked him number 7 in their list of the &quot;100 most powerful people in British culture&quot;. In the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; of 2021, Mackintosh was estimated to have a net worth of £1.2 billion.

==Early life==
Mackintosh was born in Enfield, London, the son of Diana Gladys (née Tonna), a production secretary, and Ian Robert Mackintosh, a timber merchant and jazz trumpeter. His father was Scottish, and his mother who was a native of Malta, was of Maltese and French descent. Mackintosh was educated at Prior Park College in Bath.

Mackintosh first knew that he wanted to become a theatre producer after his aunt took him to a matinee of the Julian Slade musical &quot;Salad Days&quot; when he was eight years old.

==Theatrical career==

Mackintosh began his theatre career in his late teens, as a stagehand at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and then became an assistant stage manager on several touring productions. In 1967, working with Robin Alexander, he co-produced five plays at the Kenton Theatre, Henley. He began producing his own small tours before becoming a London-based producer in the 1970s. His early London productions included &quot;Anything Goes&quot; in 1969 (which closed after two weeks), &quot;The Card&quot; (1973), &quot;Side by Side by Sondheim&quot; (1976), &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1978), and &quot;Tomfoolery&quot; (1980).

In 1981, he produced Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Cats&quot;, then considered an unlikely subject for a musical. It became the hit of the season, and went on to become one of the longest running musicals on both sides of the Atlantic. After the success of &quot;Cats&quot;, he approached the French writing team Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil about bringing their musical &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (then a successful French concept album) to the London stage. The musical opened in 1985 at the Barbican before transferring to the Palace Theatre. &quot;Les Misérables&quot; had a shaky start at the box office and a lukewarm critical reception before becoming a massive hit, largely by word-of-mouth and is now the longest running musical and second longest running London production.

In 1986, Mackintosh produced Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, which is one of the most commercially successful musicals of all time. The original London production is still running and is the 3rd longest running production in London, along with the New York production, which is the longest-running Broadway musical of all time.

He produced Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil&#x27;s next musical &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;, which opened at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in the West End in September 1989. It was similarly successful, and the 1991 Broadway production had what was then the largest advance ticket sales in theatre history prior to its controversy. Asian American actors protested the casting of a Caucasian actor and the use of yellowface in the role of the pimp.

Mackintosh has produced several other successful musicals, including &quot;Five Guys Named Moe&quot; (both in London in 1990 and on Broadway) and a revised London production of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot; in 1987. In 1995, Mackintosh produced the 10th anniversary concert of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in London. Additionally he was responsible for presenting the West End transfers of the National Theatre revivals of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1999), &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (2001), and &quot;Carousel&quot; (1993).

Mackintosh&#x27;s less successful London productions include &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (1993) and &quot;Martin Guerre&quot; (1996). He produced the stage adaptation of John Updike&#x27;s &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot; (2000) which despite some positive reviews and a run of over 15 months, failed to replicate the worldwide success of his previous blockbusters.

Mackintosh became a co-owner of the theatrical licensing company Music Theatre International in 1990. He started the theatre group Delfont Mackintosh Theatres in 1991.

Disney Theatrical Productions president Thomas Schumacher met with Mackintosh in 2001 to discuss making &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; into a stage musical. Mackintosh&#x27;s involvement in the development of the musical adaptation led to his producing both the 2004 West End and 2006 Broadway productions, at the Prince Edward Theatre and the New Amsterdam Theatre, respectively, along with Schumacher. He co-produced the London transfer of &quot;Avenue Q&quot;, which opened in the West End at the Noël Coward Theatre on 1 June 2006.

In 1998, Mackintosh celebrated thirty years in show business with &quot;Hey, Mr. Producer!&quot;, a gala concert featuring songs from shows he had produced during his career. The concert was performed twice, on 7 and 8 June, with proceeds going to the Royal National Institute of Blind People and the Combined Theatrical Charities. Many celebrities took part, and the 8 June performance was attended by Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

Mackintosh produced a revival of Lionel Bart&#x27;s &quot;Oliver!&quot; at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane which ran from 2008 to 2009. The production was cast via the hit BBC television series &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot;. Jodie Prenger became the winner and was subsequently cast as Nancy in the production, with Rowan Atkinson as Fagin. The publicity and attention surrounding the production was unprecedented on the West End stage, and it was reported in January 2009 that the production was the fastest-selling show in West End history, with £15 million of pre-opening sales.

In April 2010, Mackintosh staged a West End revival of the musical &quot;Hair&quot; in London&#x27;s Gielgud Theatre. This production was transferred from Broadway, where a revival production was staged in 2009.

In 2013, he worked with the Chichester Festival Theatre on a revival of &quot;Barnum&quot;, starring Christopher Fitzgerald. Due to the Theatre&#x27;s refurbishment, it was performed in a giant tent &#x27;Theatre in the Park&#x27; in July and August. In 2014, the production toured the UK and Ireland starring Brian Conley in the title role.

On 27 January 2014, Mackintosh was the first British producer to be inducted into Broadway&#x27;s American Theater Hall of Fame.

On 3 May 2014, Mackintosh relaunched &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; at the Prince Edward Theatre in London, celebrating 25 years since its first launch.

In 2016, Mackintosh co-produced a new version of &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot; at Chichester Festival Theatre before transferring to the Noël Coward Theatre in the West End where it ran for 10 months.

Mackintosh produced the London transfer of Lin-Manuel Miranda&#x27;s Broadway hit musical &quot;Hamilton&quot;, which premiered on 21 December 2017 at the Victoria Palace Theatre in the West End.

In 2019, Mackintosh and Disney&#x27;s production of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; returned to the Prince Edward Theatre in the West End, where it ran until January 2023.

In summer 2024, Mackintosh co-produced and revised a new production of &quot;Oliver!&quot; directed and produced by Matthew Bourne at Chichester Festival Theatre before transferring to the Gielgud Theatre in the West End in December 2024.

==Influence==
Mackintosh is notable as a producer for his transformation of the musical into a global and highly profitable brand; he was the first theatrical producer to recognise that both touring productions and worldwide productions (often in countries where musicals were seldom seen such as the former eastern bloc countries in the early 90s) were potentially highly lucrative markets which could collectively, match and even surpass the revenues generated from New York and London productions.

Mackintosh has also had considerable success in bringing legitimate theatre directors (such as the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s Trevor Nunn and Nicholas Hytner) and technicians to the world of musical theatre.

Mackintosh&#x27;s Delfont Mackintosh group owns eight London theatres, the Prince Edward, the Prince of Wales, the Novello, the Sondheim, the Gielgud, the Wyndham&#x27;s, the Victoria Palace and the Noël Coward.

==Personal life==
Mackintosh was knighted during the 1996 New Year Honours for services to musical theatre.

His partner is Australian-born theatre photographer Michael Le Poer Trench. They met at the opening night of a production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; in Adelaide, Australia in 1982. The couple live between homes in London; Stavordale Priory in Charlton Musgrove, Somerset; and the Nevis Estate, on North Morar in the West Highlands.

In 2006, Mackintosh was listed 4th on &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;″s &quot;Pink List&quot;, a list of the most influential &quot;out-and-proud&quot; gay men and women. He was also listed 4th in 2005. Mackintosh also topped &quot;The Stage 100&quot; list in 2007 for the first time since 2000. The list recognises the most influential members of the performing arts community at the end of each year.

He is a patron of The Food Chain, a London-based HIV charity.

His younger brother, Robert Mackintosh, is also a producer.

===Laird of Nevis===
In 1994, Mackintosh bought the Nevis Estate, on North Morar, to the east of Mallaig in the West Highlands of Scotland, covering around . He has since been involved in a long-running dispute with a tenant crofter, over the land use on the estate. As the laird, Mackintosh wants to use the land for building holiday homes, but the crofter says the land is needed for grazing.

==Politics==
In 1990, Mackintosh responded to criticism of Jonathan Pryce using prosthetics and skin darkening makeup to play a Vietnamese character in &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;, saying &quot;We passionately disapprove of stereotype casting...by choosing to discriminate against Mr. Pryce on the basis of his race, Equity has further violated the fundamental principles of federal and state human rights laws, as well as of federal labour laws.&quot;

In 1998, Mackintosh was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to the Labour Party, a decision he later regretted, saying in 2010, &quot;Labour really fucked it up. They were profligate at a time when we were doing well. That&#x27;s why we have the problems we have now. They didn&#x27;t save any money for a rainy day. It couldn&#x27;t have been worse these last 12 years.&quot; In the 2015 British general election, Mackintosh donated £25,000 to the successful Conservative candidate for Somerton and Frome, David Warburton.

In the 2016 European Union membership referendum, Mackintosh voted for the UK to leave the EU, stating that it was &quot;not because I don&#x27;t love Europe - I do huge amount of work in Europe and love Europeans - but there is something wrong with a system where the Fat Controller is not accountable&quot;.

<doc id="263185" wikidata="Q27712" url="?curid=263185" title="Jewish Renewal">
<text>Jewish Renewal () is a Jewish religious movement originating in the 20th century that endeavors to reinvigorate modern Judaism with Kabbalistic, Hasidic, and musical practices. Specifically, it seeks to reintroduce the &quot;ancient Judaic traditions of mysticism and meditation, gender equality and ecstatic prayer&quot; to synagogue services. It is distinct from the baal teshuva movement of return to Orthodox Judaism.

==Overview==
The term &quot;Jewish Renewal&quot; describes &quot;a set of practices within Judaism that attempt to reinvigorate what it views as a moribund and uninspiring Judaism with mystical, Hasidic, musical and meditative practices drawn from a variety of traditional and untraditional, Jewish and other, sources. In this sense, Jewish Renewal is an approach to Judaism that can be found within segments of any of the Jewish denominations&quot;.

The term also refers to an emerging Jewish movement, the Jewish Renewal movement, which describes itself as &quot;a worldwide, transdenominational movement grounded in Judaism&#x27;s prophetic and mystical traditions&quot;. The Jewish Renewal movement incorporates social views such as egalitarianism, environmentalism and pacifism. 

Jewish Renewal rabbi Barbara Thiede writes:

The movement&#x27;s most prominent leader was Zalman Schachter-Shalomi. Other leaders, teachers and authors associated with Jewish Renewal include Arthur Waskow, Michael Lerner, Tirzah Firestone, Phyllis Berman, Shefa Gold, David Ingber, and Marcia Prager.

Jewish Renewal brings kabbalistic and Hasidic theory and practice into a non-Orthodox, egalitarian framework, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as neo-Hasidism. Like Hasidic Jews, Renewal Jews often add to traditional worship ecstatic practices such as meditation, chant and dance. In augmenting Jewish ritual, some Renewal Jews borrow freely and openly from Buddhism, Sufism and other faiths.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Jewish Renewal, in its most general sense, has its origins in the North American Jewish countercultural trends of the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this period, groups of young rabbis, academics and political activists founded experimental &quot;chavurot&quot; (singular: &quot;chavurah&quot;) or &quot;fellowships&quot; for prayer and study, in reaction to what they perceived as an over-institutionalized and unspiritual North American Jewish establishment.

Initially the main inspiration was the pietistic fellowships of the Pharisees and other ancient Jewish sects.

Also initially, some of these groups, like the Boston-area &quot;Havurat Shalom&quot; attempted to function as full-fledged communes after the model of their secular counterparts. Others formed as communities within the urban or suburban Jewish establishment. Founders of the havurot included the liberal political activist Arthur Waskow, Michael Strassfeld (who later became rabbi for a Conservative congregation and then moved on to serve a major Reconstructionist congregation), and Zalman Schachter-Shalomi. Although the leadership and ritual privileges were initially men-only, as in Orthodox Jewish practice, the second wave of American feminism soon led to the full integration of women in these communities. Lynn Gottlieb became the first female rabbi in Jewish Renewal in 1981.

=== Havurot ===
Apart from some tentative articles in &quot;Response&quot; and other Jewish student magazines, the early havurot attracted little attention in the wider North American Jewish community. Then, in 1973, Richard Siegel, and Michael and Sharon Strassfeld released &quot;The Jewish Catalog: A Do-It-Yourself Kit&quot;. Patterned after the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;, the book served both as a basic reference on Judaism and American Jewish life, as well as a playful compendium of Jewish crafts, recipes, meditational practices, and political action ideas, all aimed at disaffected young Jewish adults. &quot;The Jewish Catalog&quot; became one of the bestselling books in American Jewish history to that date and spawned two sequels. A much more widespread havurah movement soon emerged, including self-governing havurot within Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist synagogues.

By 1980 an increasing number of &quot;havurot&quot; had moved away from strictly traditional Jewish worship practices, as members added English readings and chants, poetry from other spiritual traditions, percussion instruments, and overall a less formal approach to worship.

In an interview (published in &quot;Zeek&quot; in 2012), scholar and folklorist Chava Weissler, who has been a &quot;participant-observer&quot; in both the Havurah movement and in Jewish Renewal, said:

=== B&#x27;nai Or / P&#x27;nai Or ===
Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, a Hasidic-trained rabbi ordained in the Lubavitch movement, broke with Orthodox Judaism beginning in the 1960s, and founded his own organization, The B&#x27;nai Or Religious Fellowship, which he described in an article entitled &quot;Toward an Order of B&#x27;nai Or&quot;. &quot;B&#x27;nai Or&quot; means &quot;sons&quot; or &quot;children&quot; of light, and was taken from the Dead Sea Scrolls material, where the &quot;sons of light&quot; battle the &quot;sons of darkness&quot;. Schachter-Shalomi envisioned B&#x27;nai Or as a semi-monastic ashram-type community, based upon the various communal models prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s. This community never materialized as he envisioned it, but B&#x27;nai Or did produce a number of important leaders in the Renewal movement. It also produced the &quot;B&#x27;nai Or Newsletter&quot;, a quarterly magazine that presented articles on Jewish mysticism, Hasidic stories and Schachter-Shalomi&#x27;s philosophy. The masthead of this publication read: &quot;B&#x27;nai Or is a Jewish Fellowship established for the service of G-d through prayer, Torah, celebration, meditation, tradition, and mysticism. We serve as a center to facilitate people in the pursuit of Judaism as a spiritual way of life.&quot;

Schachter-Shalomi was strongly influenced by Sufism of Islam and Buddhism, and translated some of the prayers into Hebrew. He also focused more on urban sustainable living than rural culture, and suggested for instance interconnected basements of houses in urban neighborhoods that would create collective space (especially for holidays), while providing the level of privacy secular life had encouraged. Some of these ideas have influenced urban economics.

In 1985, after the first national &quot;Kallah&quot; (conference) gathering in Radnor, Pennsylvania, the name was changed from &quot;B&#x27;nai Or&quot; to &quot;P&#x27;nai Or&quot; (&quot;Faces of Light&quot;) to reflect the more egalitarian perspective of the rising feminist movement. Together with such colleagues as Arthur Waskow, Schachter-Shalomi broadened the focus of his organization. In 1993 it merged with The Shalom Center, founded by Waskow, to become ALEPH: Alliance for Jewish Renewal.

In 1979, Waskow had founded a magazine called &quot;Menorah&quot;, which explored and encouraged many creative ritual and social issues from a Jewish perspective. It was in this publication that Waskow coined the term &quot;Jewish Renewal&quot;. In 1986, &quot;Menorah&quot; merged with &quot;The B&#x27;nai Or Newsletter&quot; to become &quot;New Menorah&quot;, now available online through ALEPH. The new version of the publication addressed Jewish feminism, the nuclear arms race, new forms of prayer, social justice, etc. Several of the early &quot;New Menorah&quot; issues explored gay rights, and became an important catalyst for opening this discussion in more mainstream synagogues.

The executive-director of ALEPH said in 2016 that 50 Jewish Renewal communities had been established in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe and Israel. By this time, the beginnings of institutionalization were in place, in the form of the nonprofit organization ALEPH: Alliance for Jewish Renewal, the rabbinical association OHaLaH, and an increasingly formalized but non-accredited rabbinic ordination program.

== Renewal and the contemporary Jewish community ==
Statistics on the number of Jews who identify themselves as &quot;Renewal&quot; are not readily available. However, the evidence of Renewal influence can be found throughout the spectrum of Jewish denominational affiliation and in many diverse other arenas of Jewish life. It is not uncommon for congregations that are not associated with the Reconstructionist movement to feature many Renewal influences. These include workshops on Jewish meditation and various Judaized forms of yoga which may be incorporated into religious services. &quot;Chanting&quot; and &quot;healing&quot; services have become increasingly common. Many melodies and liturgical innovations have found their way into the Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist movements. Rabbis and Cantors trained by the ALEPH Ordination Program, the Jewish Renewal seminary, have begun to serve congregations with other affiliations and bring Renewal-informed influences to these environments.

Jewish Renewal is &quot;part of the burgeoning world of transdenominational Judaism—the growing number of synagogues, rabbis and prayer groups that eschew affiliation with a Jewish stream&quot;.

Rabbi Marcia Prager wrote in 2005:

=== Ordination training ===

The ALEPH Ordination Program emerged from ALEPH founder Reb Zalman&#x27;s earlier project of training and ordaining an inner circle of students, many with extensive yeshiva backgrounds, to be inspiring progressive post-denominational community organizers and spiritual leaders. 
The ALEPH Ordination Program has grown to become the largest rigorous liberal Jewish seminary in North America, comprising a Rabbinic Program, a Rabbinic Pastor Program (training Jewish clergy specializing in pastoral care), a Cantorial Program, and the Hashpa&#x27;ah Program (training Jewish Spiritual Directors).

Over 90 students are currently enrolled from varying denominational backgrounds in the US, Canada, Europe and Israel, who study both locally and through ALEPH courses and retreats. The rabbinic students undertake an academic program comprising a minimum of 60 graduate-level courses and practica covering a broad curriculum of rabbinic education. Cantorial students are masters of liturgy and nusach, traditional and contemporary Jewish music, western and non-western traditions, and also fulfill course requirements in Jewish history, philosophy, text, thought and practice. Rabbinic Pastors are specialists, trained to provide Jewish wisdom, spiritual direction, support, and counseling in chaplaincy and in congregational settings. The Hashpa&#x27;ah Program offers a three-year concentration in Jewish Studies and Jewish Spiritual Counseling and Guidance, leading to Certification as Mashpia/Spiritual Director.

Since 1973, more than 200 Jewish Renewal spiritual leaders have been ordained through the ALEPH Ordination Program and/or its predecessor the B&#x27;nai Or/P&#x27;nai Or Ordination Program.

The ALEPH Ordination Program combines low-residency and residential components. Semester-length seminars and courses are offered via live videoconference technology; winter and summer residential &quot;retreats&quot; are held of students and faculty for intensive sessions and practica.

AOP offers both a Master of Divinity degree and Doctor of Ministry Degree in cooperation with New York Theological Seminary (NYTS).

==Criticism and response==

=== New Age Judaism ===
Jewish Renewal has been criticized for emphasizing individual spiritual experience and New Age practices over communal norms and Jewish textual literacy.

The ALEPH website offers the following response:

=== Mainstreaming ===
Many Jewish Renewal techniques, ideas, and practices have become mainstream and are now familiar to Jews across the denominations, according to claims by the movement:
Despite the prevalence of Renewal practices, ideas, and teachings across the denominational spectrum, Jewish Renewal is not always known or credited with having originated these teachings and ideas. &quot;Our influence is penetrating much deeper into the mainstream, but without acknowledgement,&quot; said Rabbi Daniel Siegel. &quot;There is still a lot of ignorance and prejudice toward us in other movements.&quot;

=== Challenges ===
Some within the Renewal community maintain that the movement has been more successful in providing occasional ecstatic &quot;peak experiences&quot; at worship services and spiritual retreats than in inculcating a daily discipline of religious practice. Others have observed a tension within the community between those who prefer to focus on liberal social activism on American, Middle East and global issues; and those who favor an emphasis on meditation, text study and worship. And as a summer 2017 article in The Forward notes, there are tensions within ALEPH that have led many of its recent and in particular younger leaders not directly associated with the movement&#x27;s early years to walk away, preferring to pursue the renewal of Judaism outside that organization. Additionally the movement struggles to recruit and train future generations of leaders.

<doc id="263187" wikidata="Q1558496" url="?curid=263187" title="Gypsy (musical)">
<text>Gypsy: A Musical Fable is a musical with music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and a book by Arthur Laurents. It is loosely based on the of striptease artist Gypsy Rose Lee, and focuses on her mother, Rose, whose name has become synonymous with &quot;the ultimate show business mother.&quot; It follows the dreams and efforts of Rose to raise two daughters to perform onstage and casts an affectionate eye on the hardships of show business life. The character of Louise is based on Lee, and the character of June is based on Lee&#x27;s sister, the actress June Havoc.

The musical contains many songs that became popular standards, including &quot;Everything&#x27;s Coming Up Roses&quot;, &quot;Rose&#x27;s Turn&quot;, &quot;Small World&quot;, &quot;Together (Wherever We Go)&quot;, &quot;You Gotta Get a Gimmick&quot;, and &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot;.

It is frequently considered one of the crowning achievements of the mid-twentieth century&#x27;s conventional musical theatre art form, often called the book musical. &quot;Gypsy&quot; has been referred to as the greatest American musical by numerous critics and writers, among them Ben Brantley (&quot;what may be the greatest of all American musicals...&quot;) and Frank Rich. Rich wrote that &quot;&quot;Gypsy&quot; is nothing if not Broadway&#x27;s own brassy, unlikely answer to &quot;King Lear&quot;.&quot; Theater critic Clive Barnes wrote that &quot;&quot;Gypsy&quot; is one of the best of musicals...&quot; and described Rose as &quot;one of the few truly complex characters in the American musical.&quot;

==Background==
A musical based on the memoirs of Gypsy Rose Lee was a project of producer David Merrick and actress Ethel Merman. Merrick had read a chapter of Lee&#x27;s memoirs in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and approached Lee to obtain the rights. Jerome Robbins was interested and wanted Leland Hayward as co-producer; Merman also wanted Hayward to produce her next show. Merrick and Hayward approached Arthur Laurents to write the book. As he relates, Laurents initially was not interested until he saw that the story was one of parents living their children&#x27;s lives. Composers Irving Berlin and Cole Porter declined the project. Finally, Robbins asked Stephen Sondheim, who agreed to do it. Sondheim had worked with Robbins and Laurents on the musical &quot;West Side Story&quot;. However, Merman did not want an unknown composer and wanted Jule Styne to write the music. Sondheim initially refused to write only the lyrics but was persuaded by Oscar Hammerstein to accept the job.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
Baby June and Louise, the two daughters of Rose Hovick, play the vaudeville circuit around the United States in the early 1920s. Rose, the archetype of a stage mother, is aggressive and domineering, pushing her children to perform. While June is an extroverted, talented child star, the older girl, Louise, is shy. Their act has one song, &quot;May We Entertain You&quot;, with June always as the centerpiece and Louise in the background. Rose has big dreams for the girls but encounters setbacks when her father refuses to lend her money for those dreams (&quot;Some People&quot;). When Rose meets a former agent, Herbie, she persuades him to become their manager using her seductive and feminine wiles (&quot;Small World&quot;). Through Herbie&#x27;s efforts, &quot;Baby June and Her Newsboys&quot; becomes a top vaudeville act.

As the girls grow into adolescents, June and her act have a chance to perform for Mr. Goldstone of the Orpheum Circuit (&quot;Mr. Goldstone, I Love You&quot;). Meanwhile, Louise celebrates her birthday alone and wonders how old she is (&quot;Little Lamb&quot;). Rose rejects Herbie&#x27;s marriage proposal and he considers leaving, but she asserts that he could never get away from her (&quot;You&#x27;ll Never Get Away From Me&quot;). After an audition for T.T. Grantziger (&quot;Dainty June and Her Farmboys/Broadway&quot;), June is offered a place at a Performing Arts school. However, Rose turns this down, refusing to break up the act. Louise and June fantasize what life would be like if Rose were married and finished with show business (&quot;If Momma Was Married&quot;).

A few months later, still on the road from show to show, Tulsa, one of the boys from the act, confides to Louise that he has been working on his own act and Louise fantasizes that she and he could do the act together (&quot;All I Need Is the Girl&quot;). Shortly after this, June is missing, and she explains in a note that she has grown sick of her mother and the endless tour and has eloped with Tulsa, with whom she will do a new act. Rose is hurt, but she optimistically vows that she will make Louise a star, proclaiming that &quot;Everything&#x27;s Coming Up Roses&quot;.

===Act II===
Louise is now a young woman, and Rose has built a pale imitation of the Dainty June act for her. Using all girls, Rose and Herbie try valiantly to sell &quot;Madame Rose&#x27;s Toreadorables&quot; to a fading vaudeville industry. However, they are still together (&quot;Together, Wherever We Go&quot;).

With no vaudeville venues left, Louise and her second-rate act wind up accidentally booked at a burlesque house in Wichita, Kansas, as a means to deter police raids. Rose is anguished, as she sees what a booking in burlesque means to her dreams of success, but Louise persuades her that two weeks&#x27; pay for the new act is better than unemployment. Backstage, Rose proposes marriage to Herbie. He asks her to break up the act and let Louise have a normal life, and she reluctantly accepts, agreeing to marry the day after their show closes. As they are introduced to Louise, three of the strippers on the bill advise her on what it takes to be a successful stripper, a &quot;gimmick,&quot; something that &quot;makes your strip special&quot; (&quot;You Gotta Get a Gimmick&quot;).

On the last day of the booking, the star stripper in the burlesque show is arrested for solicitation. Desperate, Rose cannot resist the urge to give Louise another nudge toward stardom, and she volunteers Louise to do the striptease as a last-minute replacement. Herbie is disgusted at how low Rose has stooped and he finally walks out on her (&quot;Small World&quot; (Reprise)). Although reluctant, Louise goes on, assured by Rose that she needn&#x27;t actually strip but simply walk elegantly and tease by dropping a single shoulder strap. Shy and hesitant, she sings a titillating version of the old vaudeville song &quot;May We Entertain You&quot;. She removes only her glove, but she speaks directly to her audience, which becomes her &quot;gimmick&quot;. Louise becomes secure, always following her mother&#x27;s advice to &quot;Make &#x27;em beg for more, and then don&#x27;t give it to them!&quot; With each performance, the song becomes brasher and brassier, and Louise removes more articles of clothing. Ultimately, she becomes a major burlesque star (&quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot;).

At Louise&#x27;s dressing room, Rose argues with her daughter, now known as the sophisticated &quot;Gypsy Rose Lee&quot;. Embittered, Rose reveals that the true motivation for all her actions has been to live vicariously through her daughters so she can chase the stardom she wanted for herself, not for her children. She realizes that she has driven away June, Herbie, and now possibly Louise. She displays the talent that could have been under different circumstances, as the name &quot;Rose&quot; flashes in neon lights (&quot;Rose&#x27;s Turn&quot;). After her admission to Louise, mother and daughter tentatively move toward reconciliation in the end.

*In the 1974 and 2008 Broadway revivals, although the final dialogue scene remains, there is not a happy ending, but rather a bleak, sad one as all hopes of reconciliation for Rose and Louise fall flat when Louise walks away, laughing sarcastically at Rose&#x27;s new &quot;dream.&quot; The audience is then left with a somber Rose, whose dream of her own lit up marquee slowly fades away to her unrealistic dreams.
*In the 2003 revival starring Bernadette Peters, the final dialogue scene remains, but leaves the ending open to more interpretation from the audience. Louise walks through the stage door, with Rose following behind. Rose then turns to face the audience, a look of sadness and longing on her face as she takes one last look at the empty stage. She pauses and slowly closes the door.
*In the 2015 West End revival starring Imelda Staunton, Louise begins to walk out, and Rose catches up after waking up to reality. Louise puts her arm around Rose as they exit together. 
*In the 2024 revival starring Audra McDonald, Rose and Louise embrace and exit the stage arm in arm.

===Notes on songs===

During the pre-Broadway tryout tour, several songs were cut, including a song for Herbie called &quot;Nice She Ain&#x27;t&quot; (cut because it was given to Jack Klugman one week prior to opening and he could not memorize the keys and staging in time), and a song for Baby June and Baby Louise titled &quot;Mama&#x27;s Talkin&#x27; Soft&quot;. The latter song was cut partly because the staging required the little girls to stand on a platform elevated above the stage, which terrified the young actress playing Baby Louise and partly because the show was running too long. &quot;Mama&#x27;s Talkin&#x27; Soft&quot; was later recorded by Petula Clark and released as a single in the UK in 1959. Other cut songs include &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot;, a song for Baby June&#x27;s act, &quot;Smile, Girls&quot;, which involves Rose trying to teach the untalented girls to smile in order to make the act look good, &quot;Who Needs Him?&quot;, which Rose sings to herself after Herbie leaves her, and &quot;Three Wishes for Christmas&quot;, a burlesque number similar to one that would be performed at Minsky&#x27;s Burlesque.

==Dramatic analysis==
In analyzing the character of Rose, Clive Barnes described her as &quot;bossy, demanding, horrific&quot;. Rich described Rose as &quot;a monster&quot;. Critic Walter Kerr commented that though Rose is a monster, she must be liked and understood. Patti LuPone describes Rose: &quot;She has tunnel vision, she&#x27;s driven, and she loves her kids... And she is a survivor. I do not see her as a monster at all—she may do monstrous things, but that does not make a monster.&quot; Sondheim has said of the character: &quot;The fact that she&#x27;s monstrous to her daughters and the world is secondary... She&#x27;s a very American character, a gallant figure and a life force.&quot; Sondheim also noted, &quot;Yet the end of &quot;Gypsy&quot; is not entirely bleak. Louise comes out a star and forgives her mother. There is hope for her. Rose does confront who she is in &#x27;Rose&#x27;s Turn.&#x27; There is a catharsis. It&#x27;s not Rodgers and Hammerstein, but you feel maybe the mother and daughter will come to an understanding and maybe triumph over Rose&#x27;s craziness and Louise&#x27;s bitterness.&quot;

Brantley noted that Rose is a &quot;mythic character&quot;. She is &quot;[t]raditionally presented as an armored tank on autopilot, which finally crashes only minutes before the final curtain&quot;.

Bernadette Peters&#x27; take on the character was different: &quot;Rose was a woman who was traumatized by her own mother leaving her at an early age. I think that longing for acceptance is what fuels all her ambition. In the end, when she confronts herself in &#x27;Rose&#x27;s Turn&#x27;, she realizes she has failed her daughter just as her own mother failed her...and that destroys Rose. There is a vulnerability to Rose that makes her human, not just some loud and cartoonish parody of a stage mother.&quot;

==Productions==
===Original production===
The original Broadway production opened on May 21, 1959, at The Broadway Theatre, transferred to the Imperial Theatre, and closed on March 25, 1961, after 702 performances and two previews. The show was produced by David Merrick and directed and choreographed by Jerome Robbins. Ethel Merman starred as Rose, with Jack Klugman as Herbie and Sandra Church as Louise. Scenic and Lighting design were by Jo Mielziner and costumes were by Raoul Pène Du Bois. The orchestrations, including an overture, were supplied by Sid Ramin and Robert Ginzler.

Critic Frank Rich has referred to Robbins&#x27; work as one of the most influential stagings of a musical in American theatrical history. The original production received eight Tony Award nominations, including Best Musical, but failed to win any. The original Broadway cast recording won the Grammy Award for Best Original Cast Album (Broadway or TV), and &quot;Small World&quot; was nominated for the Grammy for Song of the Year which went to Sondheim &amp; Styne, popularized with a recording by Johnny Mathis.

When the show closed in March 1961, two national touring companies toured the US. The first company starred Merman and opened in March 1961 at the Rochester, New York Auditorium, and closed in December 1961 at the American, St. Louis, Missouri. The second national company starred Mitzi Green as Rose, followed by Mary McCarty. A young Bernadette Peters appeared in the ensemble and understudied Dainty June, a role she would play the following year in summer stock, opposite Betty Hutton&#x27;s Rose. It opened in September 1961 at the Shubert Theatre, Detroit and closed in January 1962 at the Hanna, Cleveland, Ohio.

===1973 London production===
In 1973, it was announced that Elaine Stritch would be starring in the first West End production of the show. However, when ticket sales proved to be unsuccessful, producers hired the more familiar Angela Lansbury (according to Craig Zadan, &quot;The ...producers were not able to raise the required capital on Stritch&#x27;s name, and the promise of a new production...became ominously distant&quot;). The West End production opened at the Piccadilly Theatre on May 29, 1973. It was produced by Barry M. Brown and Fritz Holt, in association with Edgar Lansbury (Angela&#x27;s brother) and directed by the show&#x27;s author, Arthur Laurents, with choreography reproduced by Robert Tucker. The supporting cast featured Zan Charisse, Barrie Ingham, Debbie Bowen and Bonnie Langford. Lansbury left the London production in December 1973 to tour the show in the US and was succeeded by Dolores Gray. The production closed on March 2, 1974, after 300 performances.

===1974 Broadway revival===
Prior to opening on Broadway, the Lansbury West End production had a 24-week tour of North America, starting in Toronto, and then travelling to many cities, including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington, DC and Boston. The production opened on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre on September 23, 1974, for a planned limited engagement, and closed on January 4, 1975, after 120 performances and four previews. It was completely recast for the American tour and Broadway run with the exception of Bonnie Langford as baby June and Zan Charisse as Louise/Gypsy who played it in the West End with Ms. Lansbury. Maureen Moore (later Bernadette Peters&#x27; understudy as Rose in the 2003 revival) played the adult June, and Mary Louise Wilson was Tessie Tura. John Sheridan played Tulsa, for which he won the 1974-75 Theatre World Award. Angela Lansbury won the 1975 Tony Award.

===1989 Broadway revival===
A second revival had pre-Broadway engagements starting at the Jackie Gleason Theater of the Performing Arts, Miami Beach, Florida, in May 1989, and Tampa in May, then The Muny, St. Louis, in June 1989, moving to the Los Angeles Music Center and Orange County Performing Arts Center, Costa Mesa, California in July 1989, and then the Kennedy Center in August and September 1989, with several other venues prior to Broadway.

The production opened on Broadway on November 16, 1989, at the St. James Theatre, and then moved to the Marquis Theatre on April 18, 1991, and closed on July 28, 1991, after 476 performances and 23 previews. Laurents returned as director, with Tyne Daly as Rose, Jonathan Hadary as Herbie and Crista Moore as Louise. Linda Lavin (on July 30, 1990) and Jamie Ross replaced Daly and Hadary respectively, with Daly returning to the production at the Marquis Theatre from April 18, 1991 until closing.

This production won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival and Daly won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance.

Jule Styne, in a 1989 interview in connection with the California tryout, said: &quot;About six months ago, Bette Midler wanted to buy it (&quot;Gypsy&quot;) for a movie. We wouldn&#x27;t sell it. Because they&#x27;d only destroy it.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that &quot;Both Liza Minnelli and Bernadette Peters say they would love to play it, but they weren&#x27;t even approached for this production.&quot;

===2003 Broadway revival===
A new Broadway revival began previews on March 31, 2003, and opened on May 1, 2003, at the Shubert Theatre. The director was Sam Mendes, with choreography by Jerry Mitchell and costumes and sets by Anthony Ward. Bernadette Peters played the role of Rose. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Peters as &quot;a surefire box office draw who nonetheless may surprise some &quot;Gypsy&quot; aficionados...How will the ladylike Ms. Peters fit into the role of Rose, a part indelibly marked by its brassy, belting originator, Ethel Merman?...&#x27;One of the main reasons I wanted to do the piece was to cast someone as Rose that was closer to Rose as she really existed,&#x27; Mr. Mendes said. &#x27;She was a tiny woman. And she was a charmer. And so is Bernadette.&#x27;&quot; Laurents had talked to Mendes (&quot;Roughly five years ago&quot; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2003) about directing the revival, and Mendes said &quot;he was surprised by the idea of casting Ms. Peters as Rose&quot;. Laurents notes of his suggestions on this production are in his 2009 book &quot;Mainly on Directing &#x27;Gypsy&#x27;, &#x27;West Side Story&#x27; and Other Musicals&quot;. In a 2004 interview Laurents said that Peters&#x27; portrayal of Rose was &quot;brilliant, original, totally unlike any of the others&quot; while criticizing Mendes for the &quot;physical production&quot; which Laurents said &quot;was misconceived and hurt the show more than people realized.&quot; &quot;Gypsy&quot; had begun previews with a virtually bare stage, but by opening night this had been changed to a minimalist set. The cast featured John Dossett as Herbie, Tammy Blanchard as Louise, Kate Reinders as June and David Burtka as Tulsa. The production was nominated for four Tony Awards, including Best Revival of a Musical and Best Actress in a Musical; it won none.

In his review, Ben Brantley in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the surprise coup of many a Broadway season...Working against type and expectation under the direction of Sam Mendes, Ms. Peters has created the most complex and compelling portrait of her long career...There have been many illustrious successors to Merman as Rose...Only Ms. Peters, however, can be said to have broken the Merman mold completely.&quot;

&quot;Gypsy&quot; twice set new box office records for the Shubert Theatre. Its gross of $853,476 for the week of June 9–14, 2003 was the highest ever gross for a non-holiday week and the subsequent June 15–21, 2003 box office gross of $874,397 represented the highest gross for a show in Shubert history. However, &quot;The New York Times&quot; announced that &quot;Gypsy&quot; would close on February 28, 2004, stating: &quot;&quot;Gypsy&quot; sold well for most of 2003. But by early January [2004], with tourists gone and local theatergoers staying inside during a brutal stretch of weather, the production&#x27;s sales grew increasingly weak. More important, the show&#x27;s advance sale, the main indicator of a production&#x27;s staying power, began to shrink rapidly. It stood at less than $2 million yesterday.&quot; After an increase in the gross, the show&#x27;s closing was postponed indefinitely, but &quot;Gypsy&quot; finally closed on May 30, 2004, after 451 performances and 33 previews. The production is believed to have recouped a little more than half of its $8 million investment.

===2008 Broadway revival===
Patti LuPone first portrayed Rose in &quot;Gypsy&quot; at the Chicago Ravinia Festival in August 2006, directed by Lonny Price and accompanied by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It began as a concert production but evolved into a full-fledged production featuring Jerome Robbins&#x27; original choreography (recreated by Bonnie Walker) and even a live lamb. Excitement was generated around LuPone playing the role of Rose and producers were eager to see Price&#x27;s production, with the hope of moving it to New York. Jack Viertel, the artistic director of New York City Center Encores! saw the production and was so impressed that he contacted Arthur Laurents, requesting that he direct a new production of the show for a new summer &quot;Encores!&quot; program. From July 9 to 29, 2007, the show was presented at New York City Center with LuPone once again. Directed by Arthur Laurents, the production also featured Laura Benanti as Louise, Boyd Gaines as Herbie and Leigh Ann Larkin as June. Nancy Opel, Marilyn Caskey, and Alison Fraser played the strippers Mazeppa, Electra, and Tessie Tura (Lenora Nemetz assumed the role of Mazeppa / Miss Cratchitt for the Broadway transfer.)

LuPone recounted in her memoirs that, when Laurents began directing this production, he based his direction initially on the 1989 revival, &quot;because, I think that in Arthur&#x27;s mind, the Tyne Daly &quot;Gypsy&quot; had been the last successful production.&quot; However, the cast &quot;questioned Arthur relentlessly about...the scenes&quot;, and he &quot;tossed the old prompt book out and freed&quot; the actors to explore.

The &quot;Encores!&quot; production was a success, and despite Ben Brantley&#x27;s somewhat negative review of LuPone&#x27;s performance in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the show transferred to Broadway, where it opened at the St. James Theatre on March 27, 2008. Brantley gave the production a rave review, praising LuPone, Laurents and the rest of the cast, and describing the characterizations in the production:
&quot;You see, everyone&#x27;s starved for attention in &quot;Gypsy&quot;. That craving, after all, is the motor that keeps showbiz puttering along. And Mr. Laurents makes sure that we sense that hunger in everyone... I was so caught up in the emotional wrestling matches between the characters (and within themselves), that I didn&#x27;t really think about the songs as songs... There is no separation at all between song and character, which is what happens in those uncommon moments when musicals reach upward to achieve their ideal reasons to be.&quot;

This production won numerous awards including the Tony Awards and Drama Desk Awards for LuPone, Gaines and Benanti. The show was originally scheduled to close in March 2009 on LuPone&#x27;s final performance, but closed on January 11, 2009, due to decreases in ticket sales. Like the 2003 production, this revival also closed at a loss. The production played for 332 performances and 27 previews. On the eve before the final performance, LuPone made news when she stopped the show during the song &quot;Rose&#x27;s Turn&quot; to scold a patron for taking illegal photographs during the performance.

Patti LuPone performed in &quot;Gypsy&quot; before Broadway, stating she starred as Louise in a high-school production of the show when she was 13 years old. LuPone had voiced interest in heading the 2003 Broadway revival, but Arthur Laurents reportedly banned her from any future work with his involvement because she previously walked out on a production of &quot;Jolson Sings Again&quot;, written by Laurents, in 1995. LuPone and Laurents subsequently reconciled.

===2015 West End revival===

===Remake talks===
In January 2011, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that Barbra Streisand was in negotiations to produce, direct and star in a new film version of &quot;Gypsy&quot;. In an interview with the &quot;New York Post&quot;, Arthur Laurents said, &quot;We&#x27;ve talked about it a lot, and she knows what she&#x27;s doing. She has my approval.&quot; He said that he would not write the screenplay. In a clarifying statement and report, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Streisand would star, but would not produce or direct. Streisand&#x27;s spokesperson confirmed that &quot;there have been conversations&quot;.

However, Frank Rizzo of &quot;courant.com&quot; reported on March 12, 2011, that the film with Streisand &quot;is not going to happen, according to playwright-director Arthur Laurents, one of the rights holders to the work.&quot; But that was contradicted by an August 2011 report by &quot;USA TODAY&quot; that the plans for a film adaptation of &quot;Gypsy&quot; were still intact. &quot;Before writer and director Arthur Laurents died at age 93 last May, there had been much talk about a movie version of &quot;Gypsy&quot; starring Streisand as Rose. &#x27;We just have to find our team and a writer,&#x27; said Streisand. &#x27;It&#x27;s too bad, because I was looking forward to working with Arthur,&#x27; who directed Streisand in her Broadway debut. &#x27;I had seen him a few months before that, and he seemed so strong and healthy.

In March 2012, reports stated that Universal Pictures was pressing on with the new film. Streisand was still attached to produce and play Rose, with Joel Silver co-producing and Julian Fellowes scripting. &quot;Playbill&quot; reported in October 2015 that &quot;Universal, which had been working with Streisand on the project, formally put &quot;Gypsy&quot; in turnaround, meaning it has decided not to develop the film any further. Streisand reportedly has been working with producer Joel Silver on the project, and they are now free to shop their &quot;Gypsy&quot; around to other studios.&quot; In April 2016, it was reported that Streisand was in advanced negotiations to star in and produce the film, which will be directed by Barry Levinson and distributed by STX Entertainment. In July 2016, it was reported that Richard LaGravenese had finished writing the script for the film and that production for the film was aiming to begin in early 2017. However, on August 3, 2016, it was reported that STX Entertainment &quot;was withdrawing as distributor and co-financier of the film.&quot;

In February 2019, it was reported that Amy Sherman-Palladino will write and direct the remake, Silver is still producing, with distribution by New Regency. As of June 2024, there have been no updates.

==Stage casts==

==Recordings==
There are recordings of each of the Broadway and London productions, as well as the film and television productions. The original 1959 and revival 2003 cast albums each won the Grammy Award for Best Original Cast Show Album.

The original Broadway cast album was Ethel Merman&#x27;s first recording in the then-new stereophonic sound technology. Motion pictures recorded in stereo had been steadily made since 1953, and stereo was first used on magnetic tape in 1954, but it was not until 1958, a year before &quot;Gypsy&quot; opened, that it became possible to use this technology on records.

The 1974 Broadway recording was not an actual recording of the Broadway revival, but a remix of the London Cast recording of 1973 with a new recording of &quot;Some People&quot;.

The 1989 Broadway cast recording featuring Daly was released in 1990.

The 2003 Broadway cast recording featuring Peters was released August 19, 2003.

The 2008 Broadway cast recording featuring LuPone was released August 28, 2008.

The 2015 West End cast recording was recorded at Angel Recording Studios in London on 9 March 2015 and was released on 27 April 2015.

==Other performances==
The 2001 Royal Variety Performance featured Cilla Black, Paul O&#x27;Grady (in his Lily Savage persona), and Barbara Windsor singing &quot;You Gotta Get a Gimmick&quot;.

<doc id="263189" wikidata="Q1691783" url="?curid=263189" title="Heel-and-toe shifting">
<text>Heel-and-toe shifting is an advanced driving technique used mostly in performance driving with a manual gearbox, although some drivers use it on the road in everyday conditions in the interest of effectiveness. It involves operating the throttle and brake pedals simultaneously with the right foot, while facilitating normal activation of the clutch with the left foot. It is used when braking and downshifting simultaneously (prior to entering a turn), and allows the driver to &quot;blip&quot; the throttle to raise the engine speed and smoothly engage the lower gear.

==Usage==

Heel-and-toe shifting is used before entry into a turn while a vehicle is under braking, preparing the transmission to be in the optimal range of rpm to accelerate out of the turn. One benefit of downshifting before entering a turn is to eliminate the jolt to the drivetrain, or any other unwanted dynamics. The jolt will not upset the vehicle as badly when going in a straight line, but the same jolt while turning may upset the vehicle enough to cause loss of traction if it occurs after the turn has begun. Sporting vehicles are usually modified (if necessary) so that the heights of the brake and accelerator pedals are closely matched when the brake is sufficiently depressed, and the pedals are not too far apart to permit easy use of heel-and-toe.

The name stems from pre-WW2 vehicles where the accelerator pedal was in the centre (between the clutch on the left and the foot brake to the right). The brake was able to be operated with the heel whilst the accelerator pedal could be simultaneously pressed with the toe. The technique is carried out in modern cars by operating the brake with the toe area, while rocking the foot across to the right to operate the throttle with the right side of the foot. With practice, it becomes possible to smoothly and independently operate both pedals with one foot.

As the power band of most race cars is found high in the rev range, this technique can also be used to ensure that engine rpm does not drop below the power band of the car while under braking, by allowing a lower gear to keep the engine in the desired rev range. The importance of this is to avoid delay between the driver accelerating after the corner and when the car responds. This is especially true in turbocharged cars where not only is it important to maintain the required rev range for strong positive boost, but the &#x27;blipping&#x27; of the accelerator can also be used to maintain turbine speeds and thus avoid turbo lag. This technique ensures that maximum power can be reached the instant the brake pedal is released and the accelerator fully depressed.

Rowing is the technique of downshifting more than one gear along with the heel-and-toe technique to provide engine braking and smoother deceleration/braking while in the intermediate gears. This provides for maximum braking when going from a top gear to a much lower gear, and optimal engine rpm for exiting the corner.

== Synchronized down shift rev-matching system ==

Synchronized downshift rev-matching system (&quot;SynchroRev Match&quot;) is a technology invented by Nissan for use on the Nissan 370Z. In combination with the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) and various sensors, the engine electronically blips the throttle for the driver during both downshifts and upshifts to allow for better and smoother shifting, and improved handling.

=== Purpose ===
When a car with a manual transmission is in motion with the clutch engaged, there is a mechanical connection between the engine and wheels which keeps them in sync with each other. When shifting, however, depressing the clutch is required. This disconnects the engine from the wheels, and the engine speed is no longer linked to that of the wheels. When upshifting, this is usually not a problem, as the tendency of the engine to reduce speed itself without gas will slow it to loosely match the lower speed of the higher gear. However, when downshifting, the engine needs to speed up to come to speed with the wheels. If the accelerator is not &quot;blipped&quot; (or briefly and quickly pressed to speed up the disengaged engine), the engine will have to take power from the wheels and momentum of the car to come to speed, which is often accompanied by a sudden deceleration of the vehicle due to the power suddenly going to the engine, often described as a &quot;lurch&quot; or &quot;jolt&quot;. This sudden external acceleration of the engine through the transmission also causes increased wear on the mechanics of the car. Therefore, a staple of advanced or professional manual-transmission driving is the &quot;rev match&quot;, or &quot;throttle-blip&quot;, in which the driver quickly brings the engine up to speed with the wheels by use of the throttle. As downshifting is often necessary when accelerating into or out of a curve or other slow-down, advanced techniques such as the &quot;heel-toe method&quot; are often required, in which the toe of the right foot presses on the brake pedal, while the heel of the same foot blips the throttle.

Nissan&#x27;s SynchroRev Match system makes such throttle blipping and advanced techniques by the driver unnecessary and accomplishes engine rev-matching automatically.

=== Implementation and experience ===
The system employs sensors on the clutch pedal, gear shift, and transmission, and is coordinated by the ECU. When the clutch pedal is depressed, the system waits for the user to either move the shifter to a different position or to re-engage the clutch. If a new gear is never selected but the clutch has been depressed long enough for the engine to lose speed, the system will bring the engine back to speed for the same gear if the driver begins to raise the clutch. If the shifter is moved to a higher gear and the clutch is re-engaged quickly, the system will let the natural deceleration of the engine sync the drive train with the higher gear. If the clutch is depressed long enough for the engine to fall below the speed of the higher new gear, the computer will blip the throttle to bring the engine back to speed. Most usefully, if a new, lower gear is selected, the computer will accelerate the engine to the new estimated speed, even to the point of redline.

In all cases, the computer continues to adjust the throttle to match the ever-changing target speed of the wheels when the clutch is partially engaged, as the vehicle speed may often change while shifting (for example due to shifting while going up or down a hill). In actual execution, the computer is able to &quot;blip&quot; the throttle due to the presence of an electronic throttle, in which the computer has direct control over both the fuel and air inputs to the engine. As the accelerator pedal in such a system has no direct mechanical connection to the throttle valve, the engagement of the system to change engine speeds is apparent to the driver via sound and tachometer cues only, and the feel or weight of the accelerator pedal remains constant. Regardless of the previous operation, the involvement of the system is ended when the clutch pedal reaches a certain point of re-engagement to ensure the system does not interfere with the driver&#x27;s intended power output to the wheels. In any case, Nissan has provided a switch to disengage the system, for example in the case of the driver preferring to perform their own rev-matching.

<text>The common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus), also known as the waterhen, is a bird species in the rail family (Rallidae). It is distributed across many parts of the Old World, across Africa, Europe, and Asia. It lives around well-vegetated marshes, ponds, canals and other wetlands. The species is not found in the polar regions or many tropical rainforests; generally it is one of the commonest Old World rail species, together with the Eurasian coot in some regions.

==Taxonomy==
The common moorhen was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it in the genus &quot;Fulica&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Fulica chloropus&quot;. The common moorhen is now one of five extant species placed in the genus &quot;Gallinula&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The genus name is from Latin &quot;gallinula&quot; meaning &quot;little hen&quot; or &quot;little chicken&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;chloropus&quot; combines the Ancient Greek &quot;khlōros&quot; meaning &quot;green&quot; and &quot;pous&quot; () meaning &quot;foot&quot;.

The closely related common gallinule &quot;G. galeata&quot; of the New World, and the tristan moorhen &quot;G. nesiotis&quot; and gough moorhen &quot;G. comeri&quot; of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago, formerly often regarded as conspecific, are now treated as a separate species by all the ornithological authorities, following the discovery of significant genetic differences in addition to differences in the structure of the red bill shield and vocal differences. The final species in the genus, the dusky moorhen &quot;G. tenebrosa&quot; of Australasia, has also been considered conspecific by some authors in the past.

The name &quot;mor-hen&quot; has been recorded in English since the 13th century. The word &quot;moor&quot; here is in its old sense meaning marsh; the species is not usually found in what is now called moorland. Another old name, waterhen, is more descriptive of the bird&#x27;s habitat. A &quot;watercock&quot; is not a male &quot;waterhen&quot; but the rail species &quot;Gallicrex cinerea&quot;, not closely related to the common moorhen. &quot;Water rail&quot; usually refers to &quot;Rallus aquaticus&quot;, again not closely related.

Five subspecies are currently accepted:
* &quot;G. c. chloropus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Europe and north Africa to Japan and southeast Asia
* &quot;G. c. meridionalis&quot; (Brehm, CL, 1831) – Africa south of the Sahara and Saint Helena (tropical southeast Atlantic Ocean)
* &quot;G. c. pyrrhorrhoa&quot; Newton, A, 1861 – Comoros, Madagascar, Réunion and Mauritius (west, central Mascarene Islands) 
* &quot;G. c. orientalis&quot; Horsfield, 1821 – Inner Islands (northeast Seychelles), Andamans, Malay Peninsula, Greater and Lesser Sunda Islands, Sulawesi region and Philippines
* &quot;G. c. guami&quot; Hartert, EJO, 1917 – north Mariana Islands and Guam (west Micronesia)

==Description==

The moorhen is a distinctive species, with predominantly black and brown plumage, with the exception of a white under-tail, white streaks on the flanks, yellow legs and a red frontal shield. The bill is red with a yellow tip. The young are browner and lack the red shield. The frontal shield of the adult has a rounded top and fairly parallel sides; the tailward margin of the red unfeathered area is a smooth waving line. The subspecies &quot;G. c. meridionalis&quot; is smaller than the nominate, has slaty blue-grey upperwing coverts and lacks the olive wash. Subspecies &quot;G. c. orientalis&quot; is similar to &quot;G. c. meridionalis&quot; but has a larger shield. Subspecies &quot;G. c. pyrrhorrhoa&quot; is darker than the nominate; subspecies &quot;G. c. pyrrhorrhoa&quot; has buff . In the related common gallinule (&quot;Gallinula galeata&quot;) of the Americas, the frontal shield has a fairly straight top and is less wide towards the bill, giving a marked indentation to the back margin of the red area.

The common moorhen gives a wide range of gargling calls and will emit loud hisses when threatened. A midsized to large rail, it can range from in length and span across the wings. The body mass of this species can range from .

==Distribution and habitat==
This is a common breeding and resident bird in marsh environments, rivers, well-vegetated lakes and even in city parks. Populations in areas where the waters freeze, such as eastern Europe, migrate to more temperate climates. In China, common moorhen populations are largely resident south of the Yangtze River, whilst northern populations migrate in the winter; these populations show high genetic diversity.

==Behaviour==
===Food and feeding===
This species will consume a wide variety of vegetable material and small aquatic creatures. They forage beside or in the water, sometimes walking on lilypads or upending in the water to feed. They are often secretive, but can become tame in some areas. Despite loss of habitat in parts of its range, the common moorhen remains plentiful and widespread.

===Breeding===
The birds are territorial during breeding season, and will fight with other members of their species, as well as other water birds such as ducks, to drive them out of their territory. The nest is a basket built on the ground in dense vegetation. Laying starts in spring, between mid-March and mid-May in Northern hemisphere temperate regions. About 8 eggs are usually laid per female early in the season; a brood later in the year usually has only 5–8 or fewer eggs. Nests may be re-used by different females. Incubation lasts about three weeks. Both parents incubate and feed the young. These fledge after 40–50 days, become independent usually a few weeks thereafter, and may raise their first brood the next spring. When threatened, the young may cling to the parents&#x27; body, after which the adult birds fly away to safety, carrying their offspring with them.

=== Nest parasitism ===
Common moorhens are known to partake in both intraspecific and interspecific parasitism, meaning they will lay their eggs in the nests of other moorhens as well as other species. The frequency of the former increases when there are an insufficient number of nesting sites, while the causes for the latter are relatively unknown. There is no one specific species that is the target of their interspecific paratisism, as moorhen eggs have been discovered in the nests of common coots, grey partridges, mallards, and several other species. 

==Status and population==

On a global scale (all subspecies taken together) the common moorhen is as abundant, as its vernacular name implies. It is therefore considered a species of Least Concern by the IUCN. However, small populations may be prone to extinction. The population of Palau, belonging to the widespread subspecies &quot;G. c. orientalis&quot; and locally known as &quot;debar&quot; (a generic term also used for ducks and meaning roughly &quot;waterfowl&quot;), is very rare, and apparently the birds are hunted by locals. Most of the population on the archipelago occurs on Angaur and Peleliu, while the species is probably already gone from Koror. In the Lake Ngardok wetlands of Babeldaob, a few dozen still occur, but the total number of common moorhens on Palau is about in the same region as the Guam population: fewer than 100 adult birds (usually fewer than 50) have been encountered in any survey.

Other localised groups of common moorhen are starting to come under threat. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in the United Kingdom has the common moorhen classified as one of its 103 species whose conservation status is of moderate concern due to its recent population decine. The number of breeding pairs has fallen to its lowest level in the UK since 1966 and has been protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981).

The common moorhen is one of the birds (the other is the Eurasian coot, &quot;Fulica atra&quot;) from which the cyclocoelid flatworm parasite &quot;Cyclocoelum mutabile&quot; was first described. The bird is also parasitised by the moorhen flea &quot;Dasypsyllus gallinulae&quot;.

==Subspecies==
Five subspecies are today considered valid; several more have been described that are now considered junior synonyms. Most are not very readily identifiable, as differences are subtle and often clinal. Usually, the location of a sighting is the most reliable indication as to subspecies identification, but the migratory tendencies of the species make identifications based on location not completely reliable. In addition to the extant subspecies listed below, an undescribed form from the Early Pleistocene is recorded from Dursunlu in Turkey.

== Relationship with humans ==
Moorhens are very tolerant of, and even thrive in anthropized habitats.

=== In history ===
Abdul hamid II, the then-Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, was known to have a special interest in the Moorhen, which was found in almost all bodies of freshwater in the land which now constitutes Turkey. So much so that over fifty moorhens were recorded to have been kept and raised in the Yildiz Palace.

<text>Left-foot braking is the technique of using the left foot to operate the brake pedal in an automobile, leaving the right foot dedicated to the throttle pedal. It contrasts with the practice of using the left foot to operate the clutch pedal, leaving the right foot to share the duties of controlling both brake and gas pedals.

At its most basic purpose, left-foot braking can be used to decrease the time spent moving the right foot between the brake and throttle pedals, and can also be used to control load transfer.

It is most commonly used in auto racing, where simultaneous gas and brake keeps revs up, and in turbocharged vehicles keeps pressure up and reduces turbo lag.

==Racing and rallying==
Karts, many open-wheelers, and cars that are equipped with automatic transmissions, or semi-automatic transmissions with paddle-shifters (as used in motorsports such as Formula One) have no foot-operated clutch, and allow, or sometimes even require the driver to use their left foot to brake.

One common race situation that requires left-foot braking is when a racer is cornering under power. If the driver does not want to lift off the throttle, potentially causing trailing-throttle oversteer, left-foot braking can induce a mild oversteer situation, and help the car &quot;tuck&quot;, or turn-in better. Mild left-foot braking can also help reduce understeer.

In rallying left-foot braking is very beneficial, especially to front-wheel drive vehicles. It is closely related to the handbrake turn, but involves locking the rear wheels using the foot brake (retarding actually, to reduce traction, rarely fully locking – best considered a misapplication), which is set up to apply a significant pressure bias to the rear brakes. The vehicle is balanced using engine power by use of the gas pedal, operated by the right foot. The left foot is thus brought into play to operate the brake. It is not as necessary to use this technique with rear-wheel drive and four-wheel drive rally vehicles because they can be easily turned rapidly by using excess power to the wheels and the use of opposite lock steering, however the technique is still beneficial when the driver needs to decelerate and slide at the same time. In rear wheel drive, left foot braking can be used when the car is at opposite lock and about to spin. Using throttle and brake will lock the front tires but not the rears, thus giving the rears more traction and bringing the front end around.

Finnish rally legend Flying Finn Rauno Aaltonen used left-foot braking as a driving style in rallying when he competed for Saab in the 1950s.

In restrictor plate NASCAR events, drivers were known to left-foot-brake at times, particularly in heavy traffic situations. Rather than lift off the throttle, which could lose considerable power and speed (due to the restrictor plates), a mild tap of the brakes while the right foot was still planted flat on the gas, could help avoid contact and bump drafting.

This technique should not be confused with heel-and-toe shifting, which is another driving technique.

=== Switch-foot braking ===
A left-foot braking technique where the driver will complete the heel-and-toe downshift using standard right-foot braking at which time they will switch to left-foot braking. This is most often used by drivers wishing to employ left-foot braking, but that must still use the left foot to operate the clutch.

=== Throttle-braking ===
A braking technique where the driver will combine the use of left-foot braking with throttle to dynamically control brake bias and remove engine braking. In a rear wheel drive vehicle, greater throttle usage while braking will counteract the rear braking force and move the brake bias forward.

==Road use==
Many commentators advise against the use of left-foot braking while driving on public roads. Critics of the technique suggest that it can cause confusion when switching to or from a vehicle with a manual transmission, and that it is difficult to achieve the necessary sensitivity to brake smoothly when one&#x27;s left foot is accustomed to operating a clutch pedal. Other factors cited include potential brake damage as well as driver fatigue. Most of the arguments are based on the difficulty of switching from automatic to manual cars, and do not apply to people who only drive automatic cars.

However, some commentators do recommend left-foot braking as routine practice when driving vehicles fitted with an automatic transmission, when maneuvering at low speeds.

Proponents of the technique note that in low-speed maneuvers, a driver of a vehicle with a manual transmission will usually keep a foot poised over the clutch pedal, ready to disengage power when the vehicle nears an obstacle. This means that disengagement is also possible in the event of malfunction such as an engine surge. However, the absence of a clutch pedal on a vehicle with automatic transmission means that there is no such safety override, unless the driver has a foot poised over the brake pedal.

<doc id="263196" wikidata="Q1263469" url="?curid=263196" title="Common gallinule">
<text>The common gallinule (Gallinula galeata) is a bird in the family Rallidae. It was split from the common moorhen by the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union in July 2011. It lives around well-vegetated marshes, ponds, canals, and other wetlands in the Americas. The common gallinule is one of the most conspicuous rail species in North America, along with the American coot.

==Description and ecology==
The gallinule has dark plumage apart from the white undertail, yellow legs and a red frontal shield. The young are browner and lack the red shield. It has a wide range of gargling calls and will emit loud hisses when threatened.

Measurements:

* Length: 12.6–13.8 in (32–35 cm)
* Weight: 10.9–16.1 oz (310–456 g)
* Wingspan: 21.3–24.4 in (54–62 cm)

This is a common breeding bird in marsh environments and well-vegetated lakes. Populations in areas where the waters freeze, such as southern Canada and the northern USA, will migrate to more temperate climes. This species will consume a wide variety of vegetable material and small aquatic creatures. It forages beside or in the water, sometimes upending in the water to feed. Its wide feet allow it to hop about on lily pads. It is often secretive, but can become tame in some areas. Despite loss of habitat in parts of its range, the common gallinule remains plentiful and widespread.

The common gallinule will fight to defend its territory. The nest is a basket built on the ground in dense vegetation. Laying starts in spring, between mid-March and mid-May in northern hemisphere temperate regions. About 8 eggs are usually laid per female early in the season; a brood later in the year usually has only 5–8 or even fewer eggs. Nests may be re-used by different females. Incubation lasts about three weeks. Both parents incubate and feed the young. These fledge after 40–50 days, become independent usually a few weeks thereafter, and may raise their first brood the next spring. When threatened, the young may cling to a parent&#x27;s body, after which the adult birds fly away to safety, carrying their offspring with them.

This species is parasitized by the moorhen flea, &quot;Dasypsyllus gallinulae&quot;.
==Subspecies==

Seven subspecies are today considered valid; others have been described that are now considered junior synonyms. Most are not very readily recognizable, as differences are rather subtle and often clinal. Usually, the location of a sighting is the most reliable indication as to subspecies identification, but the migratory tendencies of this species make identifications based on location not completely reliable.

In addition to the extant subspecies listed below, there is a Pleistocene population known from fossils: the larger, stout and long-winged paleosubspecies &quot;G. g. brodkorbi&quot; is known from the Ichetucknee River deposits in Florida. It was originally described as a distinct species, but is probably the direct ancestor of some of today&#x27;s common gallinules. The presence in the same deposits of fossils typical of the shorter-winged and more delicate &quot;G. g. cerceris&quot; suggests that &quot;G. g. brodkorbi&quot; was not ancestral to the Antillean (Florida) gallinule of our time but rather to the more northerly North American subspecies.

<doc id="263198" wikidata="Q7098621" url="?curid=263198" title="Opposite lock">
<text>Opposite lock, also commonly known as countersteer, is a colloquial term used to mean the steering associated with the deliberate use of oversteer to turn a vehicle rapidly without losing momentum. It is typified by the classic rallying style of rear-wheel drive cars, where a car travels around a bend with a large drift angle. The terms &quot;opposite lock&quot; and &quot;counter-steering&quot; refer to the position of the steering wheel during the maneuver, which is turned in the opposite direction to that of the bend.

The technique works best on loose or wet surfaces where the friction between the tires and the road is not too high, but can also be used on asphalt or other surfaces with high friction if the vehicle has enough power to maintain speed.

Before entry to the bend, the car is turned towards the bend slightly, but quickly, so as to cause a rotating motion that induces the rear of the car to slide outwards. Power is applied which applies further sideways movement. At the same time, opposite lock steering is applied to keep the car on the desired course. As the car reaches the bend it will have already turned through most of the needed angle, traveling sideways and losing some speed as a result. A smooth application of power at this point will accelerate the car into the bend and then through it, gradually removing the sideways component of travel.

For front-wheel drive vehicles, there is much less natural tendency for the rear wheels to break traction because they are not transmitting power, so often such vehicles are set up with a strong bias to the rear brakes, allowing the driver to control traction using the brake pedal. The brake balance (front/rear braking force) may be continually controllable by the driver using a hand lever. Left-foot braking is the favored technique for using opposite lock in a front drive vehicle.

A related technique is the handbrake turn, in which the rear wheels are deliberately locked in order to break the friction between the tires and the road, allowing the car to be spun around a very tight bend or junction, etc.

<doc id="263203" wikidata="Q490327" url="?curid=263203" title="Andean goose">
<text>The Andean goose (Chloephaga melanoptera) is a species of waterfowl in tribe Tadornini of subfamily Anserinae. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The Andean goose&#x27;s taxonomy is unsettled. The International Ornithological Committee (IOC) and BirdLife International&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot; (HBW) place it in genus &quot;Chloephaga&quot; with several other geese. However, based on a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014, the South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society and the Clements taxonomy place it and the Orinoco goose in the resurrected genus &quot;Oressochen&quot;. The IOC and HBW place the Orinoco goose in genus &quot;Neochen&quot;.

The Andean goose is monotypic.
== Description ==
The Andean goose is long and weighs . Both sexes have the same plumage. Adults&#x27; heads and bodies are white. Some scapulars have sooty centers and others are dark brown, giving a striped appearance to the shoulders. The wing&#x27;s primaries and the tail are black with a greenish gloss. Their bill is coral red with a black nail and the legs and feet are light red. Downy young are mostly white with some blackish spots and streaks. Older immatures are similar to adults but duller. Their bodies are somewhat off-white, the sides of the head often partly gray, and the scapulars brownish gray.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The Andean goose is found from Peru&#x27;s departments of Ancash and Junín south through western Bolivia to the Ñuble Region of Chile and in Argentina into Catamarca Province. It inhabits open grasslands, bogs, and the shores of lakes and lagoons. In elevation it is found almost entirely above but in Chile moves lower temporarily in times of heavy winter snow.

== Physiological adaptation ==

Andean geese have developed a mutation in their hemoglobin that has led to a vast increase in hemoglobin-oxygen affinity over that of lower-elevation species.
== Behavior ==
=== Movement ===

Except for temporary elevational changes, the Andean goose is a year-round resident throughout its range. They are almost entirely terrestrial but will fly to escape danger and will lead chicks into water to avoid predators.

=== Feeding ===

Almost nothing is known about the Andean goose&#x27;s diet but it appears to be almost entirely grasses. They often form loose flocks except in the breeding season.

=== Breeding ===

Andean geese are territorial only in the breeding season, which begins in November, the austral spring. They are believed to form strong year-round pair bonds. They do not make a conventional nest but lay eggs in a scrape among sparse vegetation and sometimes on bare ground. The clutch size is five to ten eggs. Males guard females during the incubation period of about 30 days.
=== Vocalization ===

The Andean goose is very vocal, and males and females have very different voices. Males make &quot;a &quot;soft &quot;huit-wit-wit..., crip, quiop&quot;, [a] low, grunting &quot;kwwwwwu...&quot;, [a] single-syllable threat whistle, and double-syllable sexual calls.&quot; Females make a louder &quot;somewhat grating &quot;kwa-kwak&quot; and &quot;a hoarse &quot;gack-gack&quot;&quot;.

== Status ==

The IUCN has assessed the Andean goose as being of Least Concern. It has a very large range, and though its population size is unknown it is believed to be stable. No immediate threats have been identified. &quot;The remote habitat of this species has protected it from human persecution [and it] is unlikely that the areas this goose uses will be modified by man in the near future.&quot; It is persecuted by sheep farmers who view it as a competitor to their flocks.

<doc id="263209" wikidata="Q216938" url="?curid=263209" title="Mushroom cloud">
<text>A mushroom cloud is a distinctive mushroom-shaped flammagenitus cloud of debris, smoke, and usually condensed water vapour resulting from a large explosion. The effect is most commonly associated with a nuclear explosion, but any sufficiently energetic detonation or deflagration will produce a similar effect. They can be caused by powerful conventional weapons, including thermobaric weapons such as the ATBIP and GBU-43/B MOAB. Some volcanic eruptions and impact events can produce natural mushroom clouds.

Mushroom clouds result from the sudden formation of a large volume of lower-density gases at any altitude, causing a Rayleigh–Taylor instability. The buoyant mass of gas rises rapidly, resulting in turbulent vortices curling downward around its edges, forming a temporary vortex ring that draws up a central column, possibly with smoke, debris, condensed water vapor, or a combination of these, to form the &quot;mushroom stem&quot;. The mass of gas plus entrained moist air eventually reaches an altitude where it is no longer of lower density than the surrounding air; at this point, it disperses, drifting back down, which results in fallout following a nuclear blast. The stabilization altitude depends strongly on the profiles of the temperature, dew point, and wind shear in the air at and above the starting altitude.

==Early accounts and origins of term==

Although the term appears to have been coined in the early 1950s, mushroom clouds generated by explosions were being described centuries before the Atomic Age. A contemporary aquatint by an unknown artist of the 1782 Franco-Spanish attack on Gibraltar shows one of the attacking force&#x27;s floating batteries exploding with a mushroom cloud after the British defenders set it ablaze by firing heated shot.
In 1798, Gerhard Vieth published a detailed and illustrated account of a cloud in the neighborhood of Gotha that was &quot;not unlike a mushroom in shape&quot;. The cloud had been observed by legation counselor Lichtenberg a few years earlier on a warm summer afternoon. It was interpreted as an irregular meteorological cloud and seemed to have caused a storm with rain and thunder from a new dark cloud that developed beneath it. Lichtenberg stated to have later observed somewhat similar clouds, but none as remarkable.

The 1917 Halifax Explosion produced a mushroom cloud. In 1930 Olaf Stapledon in his novel &quot;Last and First Men&quot; imagines the first demonstration of an atomic weapon &quot;clouds of steam from the boiling sea.. a gigantic mushroom of steam and debris&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; published a report on 1 October 1937 of a Japanese attack on Shanghai, China, that generated &quot;a great mushroom of smoke&quot;. During World War II, the destruction of the Japanese battleship &quot;Yamato&quot; produced a mushroom cloud.

The atomic bomb cloud over Nagasaki, Japan, was described in &quot;The Times&quot; of London of 13 August 1945 as a &quot;huge mushroom of smoke and dust&quot;. On 9 September 1945, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an eyewitness account of the Nagasaki bombing, written by William L. Laurence, the official newspaper correspondent of the Manhattan Project, who accompanied one of the three aircraft that made the bombing run. He wrote of the bomb producing a &quot;pillar of purple fire&quot; out of the top of which came &quot;a giant mushroom that increased the height of the pillar to a total of 45,000 feet&quot;.

In 1946, the Operation Crossroads nuclear bomb tests were described as having a &quot;cauliflower&quot; cloud, but a reporter present also spoke of &quot;the mushroom, now the common symbol of the atomic age&quot;. Mushrooms have traditionally been associated both with life and death, food and poison, which made them a more powerful symbolic connection than, say, the &quot;cauliflower&quot; cloud.

==Physics==

Mushroom clouds are formed by many sorts of large explosions under Earth&#x27;s gravity, but they are best known for their appearance after nuclear detonations. Without gravity, or without a thick atmosphere, the explosive&#x27;s by-product gases would remain spherical. Nuclear weapons are usually detonated above the ground (not upon impact, because some of the energy would be dissipated by the ground motions), to maximize the effect of their spherically expanding fireball and blast wave. Immediately after the detonation, the fireball begins to rise into the air, acting on the same principle as a hot-air balloon.

One way to analyze the motion, once the hot gas has cleared the ground sufficiently, is as a &quot;spherical cap bubble&quot;, as this gives agreement between the rate of rise and observed diameter.

As it rises, a Rayleigh–Taylor instability is formed, and air is drawn upwards and into the cloud (similar to the updraft of a chimney), producing strong air currents known as &quot;afterwinds&quot;, while, inside the head of the cloud, the hot gases rotate in a toroidal shape. When the detonation altitude is low enough, these afterwinds will draw in dirt and debris from the ground below to form the stem of the mushroom cloud.

Once the mass of hot gases reaches its equilibrium level, the ascent stops, and the cloud begins to flatten into the characteristic mushroom shape, often assisted by surface growth from decaying turbulence.

==Nuclear detonations==

=== Description ===
At the moment of a nuclear explosion, a fireball is formed. The ascending, roughly spherical mass of hot, incandescent gases changes shape due to atmospheric friction, and the surface of the fireball is cooled by energy radiation, turning from a sphere to a violently rotating spheroidal vortex. A Rayleigh–Taylor instability is formed as the cool air underneath initially pushes the bottom fireball gases into an inverted cup shape. This causes turbulence and a vortex that sucks more air into the center, creating external afterwinds and further cooling the fireball. The speed of rotation slows as the fireball cools and may stop entirely during later phases. The vaporized parts of the weapon and ionized air cool into visible gases, forming a cloud; the white-hot vortex core becomes yellow, then dark red, then loses visible incandescence. With further cooling, the bulk of the cloud fills in as atmospheric moisture condenses. As the cloud ascends and cools, its buoyancy lessens, and its ascent slows. If the size of the fireball is comparable to the atmospheric density scale height, the whole cloud rise will be , overshooting a large volume of overdense air to greater altitudes than the final stabilization altitude. Significantly smaller fireballs produce clouds with buoyancy-governed ascent.

After reaching the tropopause (the bottom of the region of strong static stability) the cloud tends to slow and spread out. If it contains sufficient energy, the central part may continue rising up into the stratosphere as an analog of a standard thunderstorm. A mass of air ascending from the troposphere to the stratosphere leads to the formation of acoustic gravity waves, virtually identical to those created by intense stratosphere-penetrating thunderstorms. Smaller-scale explosions penetrating the tropopause generate waves of higher frequency, classified as infrasound. The explosion raises a large amount of moisture-laden air from lower altitudes. As the air rises, its temperature drops and its water vapour first condenses as water droplets and later freezes as ice crystals. The phase change releases latent heat, heating the cloud and driving it to yet higher altitudes. The heads of the clouds consist of highly radioactive particles, primarily the fission products and other weapon debris aerosols, and are usually dispersed by the wind, though weather patterns (especially rain) can produce nuclear fallout. The droplets of condensed water gradually evaporate, leading to the cloud&#x27;s apparent disappearance. The radioactive particles, however, remain suspended in the air, and the invisible cloud continues depositing fallout along its path.

A mushroom cloud undergoes several phases of formation.
* &quot;Early time&quot;, the first ~20 seconds, when the fireball forms and the fission products mix with the material aspired from the ground or ejected from the crater. The condensation of evaporated ground occurs in first few seconds, most intensely during fireball temperatures between 3500 and 4100 K.
* &quot;Rise and stabilization phase&quot;, 20 seconds to 10 minutes, when the hot gases rise up and early large fallout is deposited.
* &quot;Late time&quot;, until about 2 days later, when the airborne particles are being distributed by wind, deposited by gravity, and scavenged by precipitation.
The shape of the cloud is influenced by the local atmospheric conditions and wind patterns. The fallout distribution is predominantly a downwind plume. However, if the cloud reaches the tropopause, it may spread against the wind, because its convection speed is higher than the ambient wind speed. At the tropopause, the cloud shape is roughly circular and spread out. The initial color of some radioactive clouds can be colored red or reddish-brown, due to presence of nitrogen dioxide and nitric acid, formed from initially ionized nitrogen, oxygen, and atmospheric moisture. In the high-temperature, high-radiation environment of the blast, ozone is also formed. It is estimated that each megaton of yield produces about 5,000 tons of nitrogen oxides. A higher-yield detonation can carry the nitrogen oxides from the burst high enough in atmosphere to cause significant depletion of the ozone layer. Yellow and orange hues have also been described. This reddish hue is later obscured by the white colour of water/ice clouds, condensing out of the fast-flowing air as the fireball cools, and the dark colour of smoke and debris sucked into the updraft. The ozone gives the blast its characteristic corona discharge-like smell.
The distribution of radiation in the mushroom cloud varies with the yield of the explosion, type of weapon, fusion–fission ratio, burst altitude, terrain type, and weather. In general, lower-yield explosions have about 90% of their radioactivity in the mushroom head and 10% in the stem. In contrast, megaton-range explosions tend to have most of their radioactivity in the lower third of the mushroom cloud. The fallout may appear as dry, ash-like flakes, or as particles too small to be visible; in the latter case, the particles are often deposited by rain. Large amounts of newer, more radioactive particles deposited on skin can cause beta burns, often presenting as discolored spots and lesions on the backs of exposed animals. The fallout from the Castle Bravo test had the appearance of white dust and was nicknamed &quot;Bikini snow&quot;; the tiny white flakes resembled snowflakes, stuck to surfaces, and had a salty taste. In Operation Wigwam, 41.4% of the fallout consisted of irregular opaque particles, slightly over 25% of particles with transparent and opaque areas, approximately 20% of microscopic marine organisms, and 2% of microscopic radioactive threads of unknown origin.

=== Differences with detonation types ===
With surface and near-surface air bursts, the amount of debris lofted into the air decreases rapidly with increasing burst altitude. At a burst altitude of approximately 7meters/kiloton, a crater is not formed, and correspondingly lower amounts of dust and debris are produced. The fallout-reducing height, above which the primary radioactive particles consist mainly of the fine fireball condensation, is approximately 55meters/kiloton. However, even at these burst altitudes, fallout may be formed by other mechanisms. Airbursts produce white, steamy stems, while surface bursts produce gray to brown stems because large amounts of dust, dirt, soil, and debris are sucked into the mushroom cloud. Surface bursts produce dark mushroom clouds containing irradiated material from the ground in addition to the bomb and its casing and therefore produce more radioactive fallout, with larger particles that readily deposit locally.

A detonation high above the ground may produce a mushroom cloud without a stem. A double mushroom, with two levels, can be formed under certain conditions. For example, the Buster-Jangle Sugar shot formed the first head from the blast, followed by another one generated by the heat from the hot, freshly formed crater. 

A detonation significantly below ground level or deep below the water (for instance, a nuclear depth charge) does not produce a mushroom cloud, as the explosion causes the vaporization of a huge amount of earth or water, creating a bubble which then collapses in on itself; in the case of a less deep underground explosion, this produces a subsidence crater. An underwater detonation near the surface may produce a pillar of water which collapses to form a cauliflower-like shape, which is easily mistaken for a mushroom cloud (such as in the well-known pictures of the &quot;Crossroads Baker&quot; test). An underground detonation at low depth produces a mushroom cloud and a base surge, two different distinct clouds. The amount of radiation vented into the atmosphere decreases rapidly with increasing detonation depth. 

===Cloud composition===

The cloud contains three main classes of material: the remains of the weapon and its fission products, the material acquired from the ground (only significant for burst altitudes below the fallout-reducing altitude, which depends on the weapon yield), and water vapour. The bulk of the radiation contained in the cloud consists of the nuclear fission products; neutron activation products from the weapon materials, air, and the ground debris form only a minor fraction. Neutron activation starts during the neutron burst at the instant of the blast, and the range of this neutron burst is limited by the absorption of the neutrons as they pass through the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

Thermonuclear weapons produce a significant part of their yield from nuclear fusion. Fusion products are typically non-radioactive. The degree of radiation fallout production is therefore measured in kilotons of fission. The Tsar Bomba, which produced 97% of its 50-megaton yield from fusion, was a very clean weapon compared to what would typically be expected of a weapon of its yield (although it still produced 1.5 megatons of its yield from fission), as its fusion tamper was made of lead instead of uranium-238; otherwise, its yield would have been 100 megatons with 51 megatons produced from fission. Were it to be detonated at or near the surface, its fallout would comprise fully one-quarter of all the fallout from every nuclear weapon test, combined.

Initially, the fireball contains a highly ionized plasma consisting only of atoms of the weapon, its fission products, and atmospheric gases of adjacent air. As the plasma cools, the atoms react, forming fine droplets and then solid particles of oxides. The particles coalesce to larger ones, and deposit on surface of other particles. Larger particles usually originate from material aspired into the cloud. Particles aspired while the cloud is still hot enough to melt them mix with the fission products throughout their volume. Larger particles get molten radioactive materials deposited on their surface. Particles aspired into the cloud later, when its temperature is low enough, do not become significantly contaminated. Particles formed only from the weapon are fine enough to stay airborne for a long time and become widely dispersed and diluted to non-hazardous levels. Higher-altitude blasts which do not aspire ground debris, or which aspire dust only after cooling enough and where the radioactive fraction of the particles is therefore small, cause a much smaller degree of localized fallout than lower-altitude blasts with larger radioactive particles formed.

The concentration of condensation products is the same for the small particles and for the deposited surface layers of larger particles. About 100 kg of small particles are formed per kiloton of yield. The volume, and therefore activity, of the small particles is almost three orders of magnitude lower than the volume of the deposited surface layers on larger particles. For higher-altitude blasts, the primary particle forming processes are condensation and subsequent coagulation. For lower-altitude and ground blasts, with involvement of soil particles, the primary process is deposition on the foreign particles.

A low-altitude detonation produces a cloud with a dust loading of 100 tons per megaton of yield. A ground detonation produces clouds with about three times as much dust. For a ground detonation, approximately 200 tons of soil per kiloton of yield is melted and comes in contact with radiation. The fireball volume is the same for a surface or an atmospheric detonation. In the first case, the fireball is a hemisphere instead of a sphere, with a correspondingly larger radius.

The particle sizes range from submicrometer- and micrometer-sized (created by condensation of plasma in the fireball), through 10–500 micrometers (surface material agitated by the blast wave and raised by the afterwinds), to millimeter and above (crater ejecta). The size of particles together with the altitude they are carried to, determines the length of their stay in the atmosphere, as larger particles are subject to dry precipitation. Smaller particles can be also scavenged by precipitation, either from the moisture condensing in the cloud or from the cloud intersecting with a rain cloud. The fallout carried down by rain is known as &quot;rain-out&quot; if scavenged during raincloud formation, &quot;washout&quot; if absorbed into already formed falling raindrops.

Particles from air bursts are smaller than 10–25 micrometers, usually in the submicrometer range. They are composed mostly of iron oxides, with smaller proportion of aluminium oxide, and uranium and plutonium oxides. Particles larger than 1–2 micrometers are very spherical, corresponding to vaporized material condensing into droplets and then solidifying. The radioactivity is evenly distributed throughout the particle volume, making total activity of the particles linearly dependent on particle volume. About 80% of activity is present in more volatile elements, which condense only after the fireball cools to considerable degree. For example, strontium-90 will have less time to condense and coalesce into larger particles, resulting in greater degree of mixing in the volume of air and smaller particles. The particles produced immediately after the burst are small, with 90% of the radioactivity present in particles smaller than 300 nanometers. These coagulate with stratospheric aerosols. Coagulation is more extensive in the troposphere, and, at ground level, most activity is present in particles between 300 nm and 1 μm. The coagulation offsets the fractionation processes at particle formation, evening out isotopic distribution.

For ground and low-altitude bursts, the cloud contains vaporized, melted and fused soil particles. The distribution of activity through the particles depends on their formation. Particles formed by vaporization-condensation have activity evenly distributed through volume as the air-burst particles. Larger molten particles have the fission products diffused through the outer layers, and fused and non-melted particles that were not heated sufficiently but came in contact with the vaporized material or scavenged droplets before their solidification have a relatively thin layer of high activity material deposited on their surface. The composition of such particles depends on the character of the soil, usually a glass-like material formed from silicate minerals. The particle sizes do not depend on the yield but instead on the soil character, as they are based on individual grains of the soil or their clusters. Two types of particles are present, spherical, formed by complete vaporization-condensation or at least melting of the soil, with activity distributed evenly through the volume (or with a 10–30% volume of inactive core for larger particles between 0.5–2 mm), and irregular-shaped particles formed at the edges of the fireball by fusion of soil particles, with activity deposited in a thin surface layer. The amount of large irregular particles is insignificant. Particles formed from detonations above, or in, the ocean, will contain short-lived radioactive sodium isotopes, and salts from the sea water. Molten silica is a very good solvent for metal oxides and scavenges small particles easily; explosions above silica-containing soils will produce particles with isotopes mixed through their volume. In contrast, coral debris, based on calcium carbonate, tends to adsorb radioactive particles on its surface.

The elements undergo fractionation during particle formation, due to their different volatility. Refractory elements (Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm) form oxides with high boiling points; these precipitate the fastest and at the time of particle solidification, at temperature of 1400 °C, are considered to be fully condensed. Volatile elements (Kr, Xe, I, Br) are not condensed at that temperature. Intermediate elements have their (or their oxides) boiling points close to the solidification temperature of the particles (Rb, Cs, Mo, Ru, Rh, Tc, Sb, Te). The elements in the fireball are present as oxides, unless the temperature is above the decomposition temperature of a given oxide. Less refractory products condense on surfaces of solidified particles. Isotopes with gaseous precursors solidify on the surface of the particles as they are produced by decay.

The largest and therefore most radioactive particles are deposited by fallout in the first few hours after the blast. Smaller particles are carried to higher altitudes and descend more slowly, reaching ground in a less radioactive state as the isotopes with the shortest half-lives decay the fastest. The smallest particles can reach the stratosphere and stay there for weeks, months, or even years, and cover an entire hemisphere of the planet via atmospheric currents. The higher danger, short-term, localized fallout is deposited primarily downwind from the blast site, in a cigar-shaped area, assuming a wind of constant strength and direction. Crosswinds, changes in wind direction, and precipitation are factors that can greatly alter the fallout pattern.

The condensation of water droplets in the mushroom cloud depends on the amount of condensation nuclei. Too many condensation nuclei actually inhibit condensation, as the particles compete for a relatively insufficient amount of water vapor. Chemical reactivity of the elements and their oxides, ion adsorption properties, and compound solubility influence particle distribution in the environment after deposition from the atmosphere. Bioaccumulation influences the propagation of fallout radioisotopes in the biosphere.

===Radioisotopes===
The primary fallout hazard is gamma radiation from short-lived radioisotopes, which represent the bulk of activity. Within 24 hours after a burst, the fallout gamma radiation level drops 60 times. Longer-life radioisotopes, typically caesium-137 and strontium-90, present a long-term hazard. Intense beta radiation from the fallout particles can cause beta burns to people and animals coming in contact with the fallout shortly after the blast. Ingested or inhaled particles cause an internal dose of alpha and beta radiation, which may lead to long-term effects, including cancer. The neutron irradiation of the atmosphere produces a small amount of activation, mainly as long-lived carbon-14 and short-lived argon-41. The elements most important for induced radioactivity for sea water are sodium-24, chlorine, magnesium, and bromine. For ground bursts, the elements of concern are aluminium-28, silicon-31, sodium-24, manganese-56, iron-59, and cobalt-60.

The bomb casing can be a significant sources of neutron-activated radioisotopes. The neutron flux in the bombs, especially thermonuclear devices, is sufficient for high-threshold nuclear reactions. The induced isotopes include cobalt-60, 57 and 58, iron-59 and 55, manganese-54, zinc-65, yttrium-88, and possibly nickel-58 and 62, niobium-63, holmium-165, iridium-191, and short-lived manganese-56, sodium-24, silicon-31, and aluminium-28. Europium-152 and 154 can be present, as well as two nuclear isomers of rhodium-102. During the Operation Hardtack, tungsten-185, 181 and 187 and rhenium-188 were produced from elements added as tracers to the bomb casings, to allow identification of fallout produced by specific explosions. Antimony-124, cadmium-109, and cadmium-113m are also mentioned as tracers.

The most significant radiation sources are the fission products from the primary fission stage, and in the case of fission-fusion-fission weapons, from the fission of the fusion stage uranium tamper. Many more neutrons per unit of energy are released in a thermonuclear explosion in comparison with a purely fission yield influencing the fission products composition. For example, uranium-237 is a unique thermonuclear explosion marker, as it is produced by a (n,2n) reaction from uranium-238, with the minimal neutron energy needed being about 5.9 MeV. Considerable amounts of neptunium-239 and uranium-237 are indicators of a fission-fusion-fission explosion. Minor amounts of uranium-240 are also formed, and capture of large numbers of neutrons by individual nuclei leads to formation of small but detectable amounts of higher transuranium elements, e.g. einsteinium-255 and fermium-255.

One of the important fission products is krypton-90, a radioactive noble gas. It diffuses easily in the cloud and undergoes two decays to rubidium-90 and then strontium-90, with half-lives of 33 seconds and 3 minutes. The noble gas nonreactivity and rapid diffusion is responsible for depletion of local fallout in Sr-90, and corresponding Sr-90 enrichment of remote fallout.

The radioactivity of the particles decreases with time, with different isotopes being significant at different timespans. For soil activation products, aluminium-28 is the most important contributor during the first 15 minutes. Manganese-56 and sodium-24 follow until about 200 hours. Iron-59 follows at 300 hours, and after 100–300 days, the significant contributor becomes cobalt-60.

Radioactive particles can be carried for considerable distances. Radiation from the Trinity test was washed out by a rainstorm in Illinois. This was deduced, and the origin traced, when Eastman Kodak found x-ray films were being fogged by cardboard packaging produced in the Midwest. Unanticipated winds carried lethal doses of Castle Bravo fallout over the Rongelap Atoll, forcing its evacuation. The crew of Daigo Fukuryu Maru, a Japanese fishing boat located outside of the predicted danger zone, was also affected. Strontium-90 found in worldwide fallout later led to the Partial Test Ban Treaty.

===Fluorescent glow===

The intense radiation in the first seconds after the blast may cause an observable aura of fluorescence, the blue-violet-purple glow of ionized oxygen and nitrogen out to a significant distance from the fireball, surrounding the head of the forming mushroom cloud. This light is most easily visible at night or under conditions of weak daylight. The brightness of the glow decreases rapidly with elapsed time since the detonation, becoming only barely visible after a few tens of seconds.

===Condensation effects===
Nuclear mushroom clouds are often accompanied by short-lived vapour clouds, known variously as &quot;Wilson clouds&quot;, condensation clouds, or vapor rings. The &quot;negative phase&quot; following the positive overpressure behind a shock front causes a sudden rarefaction of the surrounding medium. This low pressure region causes an adiabatic drop in temperature, causing moisture in the air to condense in an outward moving shell surrounding the explosion. When the pressure and temperature return to normal, the Wilson cloud dissipates. Scientists observing the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in 1946 at Bikini Atoll named that transitory cloud a &quot;Wilson cloud&quot; because of its visual similarity to a Wilson cloud chamber; the cloud chamber uses condensation from a rapid pressure drop to mark the tracks of electrically charged subatomic particles. Analysts of later nuclear bomb tests used the more general term &quot;condensation cloud&quot; in preference to &quot;Wilson cloud&quot;.

The same kind of condensation is sometimes seen above the wings of jet aircraft at low altitude in high-humidity conditions. The top of a wing is a curved surface. The curvature (and increased air velocity) causes a reduction in air pressure, as given by Bernoulli&#x27;s Law. This reduction in air pressure causes cooling, and when the air cools past its dew point, water vapour condenses out of the air, producing droplets of water, which become visible as a white cloud. In technical terms, the &quot;Wilson cloud&quot; is also an example of the Prandtl–Glauert singularity in aerodynamics.

The shape of the shock wave is influenced by variation of the speed of sound with altitude, and the temperature and humidity of different atmospheric layers determines the appearance of the Wilson clouds. Condensation rings around or above the fireball are a commonly observed feature. Rings around the fireball may become stable, becoming rings around the rising stem. Higher-yield explosions cause intense updrafts, where air speeds can reach . The entrainment of higher-humidity air, combined with the associated drop in pressure and temperature, leads to the formation of &quot;skirts&quot; and &quot;bells&quot; around the stem. If the water droplets become sufficiently large, the cloud structure they form may become heavy enough to descend; in this way, a rising stem with a descending bell around it can be produced. Layering of humidity in the atmosphere, responsible for the appearance of the condensation rings as opposed to a spherical cloud, also influences the shape of the condensation artifacts along the stem of the mushroom cloud, as the updraft causes laminar flow. The same effect above the top of the cloud, where the expansion of the rising cloud pushes a layer of warm, humid, low-altitude air upwards into cold, high-altitude air, first causes the condensation of water vapour out of the air and then causes the resulting droplets to freeze, forming &quot;ice caps&quot; (or &quot;icecaps&quot;), similar in both appearance and mechanism of formation to scarf clouds.

The resulting composite structures can become very complex. The Castle Bravo cloud had, at various phases of its development, 4 condensation rings, 3 ice caps, 2 skirts, and 3 bells.

<text>Mary Elizabeth &quot;Tipper&quot; Gore (née Aitcheson; born August 19, 1948) is an American social issues advocate. She was the second lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001 through her marriage to the 45th vice president, Al Gore in 1970, from whom she separated in 2010.

In 1985, Gore co-founded the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), which advocated for labeling of record covers of releases featuring profane language, especially in the heavy metal, punk, and hip hop genres of music. Throughout her decades of public life, she has advocated for placing advisory labels on music (leading critics to call her a censor), and for mental health awareness, women&#x27;s causes, children&#x27;s causes, LGBT rights, and reducing homelessness.

==Early life and education==
Born Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson in Washington, D.C., Tipper Gore is the daughter of John Kenneth &quot;Jack&quot; Aitcheson Jr., a plumbing-supply entrepreneur and owner of J &amp; H Aitcheson Plumbing Supply, and his first wife, Margaret Ann (&quot;née&quot; Carlson) Odom (who lost her first husband during World War II). She was given the nickname &quot;Tipper&quot; by her mother, from a lullaby her mother had heard. Gore grew up in Arlington, Virginia. Her mother and grandmother raised her after her parents divorced.
She attended St. Agnes (now St. Stephen&#x27;s &amp; St. Agnes School), a private Episcopal school in Alexandria, Virginia, where she played basketball, softball and field hockey, and played the drums for an all-female band called The Wildcats.

She met Al Gore at his senior prom in 1965. Although she came to the prom with one of his classmates, Gore and Tipper began to date immediately afterwards. When Al Gore began attending Harvard University, she enrolled in Garland Junior College (now part of Simmons College) and later transferred to Boston University receiving her B.A. in psychology in 1970. On May 19, 1970, she and Gore were married at the Washington National Cathedral.

Gore pursued a master&#x27;s degree in psychology from Vanderbilt University&#x27;s George Peabody College, graduating in 1975.

==Career==
Gore worked part-time as a newspaper photographer for Nashville&#x27;s &quot;The Tennessean&quot; and continued as a freelance photographer in Washington after her husband was elected to the U.S. Congress in 1976.

==Politics and activism==

Gore took an active role in her husband&#x27;s political pursuits starting with his first campaign for the United States House of Representatives from Tennessee in 1976. Soon after her husband&#x27;s election, Gore established a group to examine and write about social issues called the Congressional Wives Task Force.

In 1984, Gore began volunteering in homeless shelters. Homelessness became a major cause for Gore, and she formed a group called Families for the Homeless to raise funds and awareness for the issue.

===Parents Music Resource Center ===
In 1985, Tipper Gore co-founded the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) with Sally Nevius, Pam Howar, and Susan Baker, wife of then–United States secretary of the treasury James Baker, because Gore heard her then 11-year-old daughter Karenna playing &quot;Darling Nikki&quot; by Prince. The group&#x27;s goal was to increase parental and consumer awareness of music that contained explicit content through voluntary labeling albums with Parental Advisory stickers. Their coalition included the National PTA and the American Academy of Pediatrics. The PMRC had no members, merely founders, and all of the founders were wives of prominent politicians.

According to an article by NPR, Gore went &quot;before Congress to urge warning labels for records marketed to children.&quot; Gore explained that her purpose wasn&#x27;t to put a &quot;gag&quot; on music, but to keep it safe for younger listeners by providing parents with information about the content of the songs. A number of individuals including Glenn Danzig of Danzig/Misfits, Dee Snider of Twisted Sister, Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys, John Denver, Joey Ramone, and Frank Zappa criticized the group, arguing that it was a form of censorship. Gore&#x27;s relationship with Snider was particularly antagonistic, with Snider accusing her of having a &quot;dirty mind&quot; for suggesting that his band&#x27;s song &quot;Under the Blade&quot; contained sadomasochistic references, when the song in fact referred to medical surgery instead. In response to such criticism, NPR further stated that according to Gore, she &quot;wasn&#x27;t out to censor the objectionable material&quot; and quoted her as stating that she is &quot;a strong believer in the First Amendment&quot; who is calling for greater &quot;consumer information in the marketplace.&quot;

The PMRC&#x27;s efforts were successful and resulted in an agreement where recording labels voluntarily placed warning labels on music with violent or sexually explicit lyrics.

===1990s to present===

In 1990, Gore founded the Tennessee Voices for Children to advance youth services for mental health and substance abuse. Gore also co-chaired the National Mental Health Association&#x27;s Child Mental Health Interest Group.

Gore campaigned during her husband&#x27;s 1988 presidential bid and toured with him and Bill and Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign of 1992.

As second lady, Gore served as the mental health policy advisor to the president. Her goals were to diminish the stigma surrounding mental illness and to bring awareness to the need for affordable mental health care. In 1999, Gore hosted the first White House Conference on Mental Health. That same year, she launched the National Mental Health Awareness Campaign (NMHAC) to encourage Americans to seek treatment for mental illness. Gore has frequently spoken about her own experience with depression and treatment following the near-fatal injury of her son Albert.

Along with her work in mental health, Gore was a part of several other initiatives during her time as second lady. She served as special advisor to the Interagency Council on the Homeless and as the national spokesperson for the &quot;Back to Sleep&quot; SIDS awareness campaign. In 1994, Gore visited a refugee camp and an orphanage in Zaire on a personal trip to provide aid in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide. She stayed in a UNICEF camp and assisted doctors and aid workers. She made an official visit to Honduras in 1998 following Hurricane Mitch to volunteer, bring medical supplies, and survey the damage.

Gore took part in campaigning for the reelection of President Clinton and Vice President Gore in 1996, and she was actively involved in her husband&#x27;s presidential campaign in 2000, making her own campaign stops and media appearances. She also acted as an advisor and was a part of decisions including the hiring of Tony Coelho as chairman of the campaign and moving its headquarters to Nashville.

In 2002, Gore was urged by her supporters to run for the vacant U.S. Senate seat her husband once held in Tennessee, which was being vacated by Fred Thompson; however, she declined.

Gore has been a long-time advocate for the LGBT community. She represented the Clinton administration in the Washington, D.C. AIDS Walk in 1993 as one of the highest-ranking public officials ever to participate. She has continued to participate in such walks and, in 2013 she was an honorary chair of the Nashville AIDS Walk &amp; 5K Run. She was a public opponent of California&#x27;s Proposition 8 to ban same-sex marriage in 2008. In 2014, she created an exhibition of her photographs at the Wall Space Gallery to support the Pacific Pride Foundation that provides services to the HIV/AIDS and LGBT communities of Santa Barbara, California.

<doc id="263212" wikidata="Q2719710" url="?curid=263212" title="Horlicks">
<text>Horlicks is a British sweet malted milk hot drink powder developed by founders James and William Horlick. It was first sold as &quot;Horlick&#x27;s Infant and Invalids Food&quot;, soon adding &quot;aged and travellers&quot; to their label. In the early 20th century, it was sold as a powdered meal replacement drink mix.

&#x27;Night starvation&#x27; was a fictitious condition invented by Horlicks as an advertising gimmick that was supposedly relieved if a mug of the malt drink was consumed before bedtime. In the song &quot;Goodness gracious me!&quot;, the doctor (played by Peter Sellers) mentions night starvation as one of the many possible ailments that his wealthy Italian patient (played by Sophia Loren) might be suffering from, when in fact the trouble is that they are both lovesick.

It was then not marketed as a nutritional supplement and manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (Consumer Healthcare) in Australia, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Thailand, Singapore, Jamaica, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and the United Kingdom. It is now produced by the Anglo-Dutch company Unilever through its Indian division. Horlicks in the UK is currently owned by Aimia Foods.

On 3 December 2018, Unilever announced they were buying Horlicks Indian business for US$3.8 billion. The Horlicks UK business had already been sold in 2017 to Aimia Foods, a UK-based subsidiary of Cott Corporation.

In Britain, Horlicks is commonly consumed as a drink near bedtime, and is marketed as an evening drink; in contrast, it has been marketed as a breakfast drink in India where it is far more popular.

==Ingredients==
The main ingredient in the United Kingdom formulation is a mixture of wheat flour and malted wheat (46%), followed by malted barley (26%). As of 2019, the other ingredients include dried whey, calcium carbonate, dried skimmed milk, sugar, palm oil, salt, Anti-Caking Agent (E551), and a mixture of vitamins and minerals. The palm oil used is non-hydrogenated and certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. The formulation may vary slightly depending upon the country. For instance, the Indian formulation does not contain oil, but does contain soy protein isolate.

==Advertising==
&quot;Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future&quot; serial was sponsored by Horlicks in 1952 and was aired Monday to Friday at 7:15 p.m. over Radio Luxembourg.

In 1961, Horlicks ran a television advertising campaign that featured Scottish entertainer Billy Raymond and an actress. The theme of the advert was &quot;Horlicks – the food drink of the night.&quot;

Horlicks was the sponsor of the &quot;Lum and Abner&quot; Show from 1934 to 1937.

==Around the world==

===India===
Horlicks came to India with the British Army; the end of World War I saw Indian soldiers of British Indian Army bringing it back with them as a dietary supplement. Punjab, Bengal and Madras Presidencies became early adopters of Horlicks and many well-to-do Indians took to drinking Horlicks as a family drink in early 1940s and 1950s. It became a sort of status symbol in upper middle class Indians and rich classes. The first flavour available in India, as in Britain, was malt.

India, where it has traditionally been marketed as &quot;The Great Family Nourisher&quot;, is the largest market for Horlicks. The Indian formulation for Horlicks is slightly different from that used in most other countries, as there it is manufactured from buffalo milk rather than cows milk. In 2003, the brand underwent a revamp which led to the introduction of new flavours such as vanilla, toffee, chocolate, honey, and elaichi (cardamom). The current line-up of flavours include original (malt), chocolate and elaichi. with the latest offering Horlicks Kesar Badaam added recently to the portfolio, providing a more specialized taste offering to the consumers.

In recent years, there has been an increase in the scope of the brand in India. By pushing it to newer segments of the market, Horlicks has become an umbrella brand for a wide variety of products ranging from the flagship malt drink to instant noodles, confectionery and breakfast cereal. Special formulations of the malted drink for young children (&quot;Junior Horlicks&quot;), breast-feeding mothers (&quot;Mother&#x27;s Horlicks&quot;), women (&quot;Women&#x27;s Horlicks&quot;) and adults (&quot;Lite Horlicks&quot;) exist. Horlicks biscuits were first launched in 1993, and an energy bar was launched in 2009, named &quot;Horlicks NutriBar&quot;. Also in late 2009, &quot;Foodles&quot;, a brand of instant noodles, was launched under the Horlicks umbrella. This was followed in 2011 by launches of &quot;Horlicks Gold&quot;, a premium variant of the malt drink (dubbed &quot;The Best Horlicks Ever&quot;), and &quot;Horlicks Oats&quot;, the first breakfast cereal product under the Horlicks brand.

In 2010, Horlicks accounted for 85% of the revenue of GlaxoSmithKline in India. In 2012 it was the most widely consumed packaged beverage in India, after bottled water.

The biggest branding event is Horlicks Wizkids. This event started its way in 2003 and till now has reached approximately 25 million children in all India as well as in Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh.

Ahaar Abhiyan is a Horlicks initiative to increase malnutrition-related awareness amongst mothers, families and communities. With the sale of every bottle of Horlicks, the company contributes ₹1 towards the initiative. The campaign attempts to raise awareness about proper nutrition amongst mothers of children aged between 3 and 6 years.

Horlicks Wizkids is an interschool cultural and literary competition for children from class 1 to 12. The competition attracts students from India, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh. With more than 30 events in the field of arts, literature, painting and extra-curricular activities, Horlicks Wizkids is South Asia&#x27;s largest interschool fiesta giving children an opportunity to showcase their talent on a global platform.

The 2013 Edition of Horlicks Wizkids South Asia was held in Bangalore. It consisted of five days of rigorous training sessions, talent rounds, project presentations and other fun, learning and recreational activities. More than 100,000 students from over 1,200 schools participated. Five students from Vizag, Jaipur, Delhi, Hyderabad and Bhubaneshwar earned the title of the Horlicks WizTeam 2013. The winners got an opportunity to go for a learning program to Germany and a cash award of ₹100,000 each.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, Horlicks is known better as a café drink than as a sleeping aid. It is served at cha chaan tengs as well as fast-food shops such as Café de Coral, Fairwood and Maxim&#x27;s Express. It can be served hot or cold, and is usually sweetened with sugar. It is made with warm milk, and ice is added to it if a cold drink is desired.

===Southeast Asia===
In some Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines and Malaysia, Horlicks was also sold as milky-chocolate-flavoured discs in paper packets, which were then eaten as candy. Horlicks remains popular in Malaysia and Singapore where it packed under licence from SmithKline Beecham and sold in large glass and tin containers. It is also available in 1.5 kg refill packs. &quot;Taller, stronger, sharper&quot; is its slogan.
===South Africa===
Besides its use as a hot drink prepared with hot milk, Horlicks is also a popular ingredient in &quot;honey and Horlicks&quot; milkshakes in South Africa.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, Horlicks is produced by Aimia Foods. It is available in original (prepared with hot milk), instant (prepared with hot water), chocolate (prepared with hot water), and vegan. A &#x27;pudding range&#x27; is also available in cherry bakewell, banoffee pie and apple pie flavours. In addition, a &#x27;nourishing shakes&#x27; range (requiring milk) includes products claiming to help with a healthy body, healthy gut, or healthy sleep.

GlaxoSmithKline attempted a rebrand of the product in 2004 for younger consumers by redesigning the packaging and publicising its consumption at a number of trendy London venues such as the Groucho Club.

The company also owned Horlicks Farms and Dairies, a cheese, dairy and cattle breeding station at &quot;Hort Bridge&quot;, Ilminster, Somerset. (The cattle breeding centre provided an artificial insemination service to farmers). In 1958 it took over the Cheddar Valley Dairy, and by the early 1960s had retail rounds, depots, and shops at Burnham, Cheddar, Clevedon, Glastonbury, Nailsea, Taunton, and Weston-super-Mare.

<doc id="263220" wikidata="Q205089" url="?curid=263220" title="Department of Ancash">
<text>Ancash (; ) is a department and region in western Peru. It is bordered by the departments of La Libertad on the north, Huánuco and Pasco on the east, Lima on the south, and the Pacific Ocean on the west. Its capital is the city of Huaraz, and its largest city and port is Chimbote. The name of the region originates from the Quechua word (&#x27;light, of little weight&#x27;), from (&#x27;blue&#x27;) or from (&#x27;eagle&#x27;).

== Geography ==

Ancash is a land of contrasts: it features two great longitudinal valleys, which combine the mountain characteristics of the Callejón de Huaylas (Alley of Huaylas) with the sylvan ones of the Alto Marañón. Kilometres of sandy beaches and the blue waters of the Pacific. The territory of the coast, high plateaux and Andean &quot;punas&quot; of the department are flat, while the rest of the territory, in the Andes, is very rough. In the west, there are slopes with strong declivity form narrow canyons with abrupt and deserted sides.

The rough territory of the department is crossed by two mountain ranges: on the western side, the Cordillera Negra (Spanish for &quot;black mountain range&quot;), which has peaks without glaciers, and on the eastern side, the Cordillera Blanca (&quot;white mountain range&quot;), which has many peaks covered with snow and ice, such as the Huascarán and the Alpamayo. Between these two mountain ranges, the Santa River flows through the so-called &quot;Callejón de Huaylas&quot;. This valley narrows to form the Cañón del Pato (&quot;duck canyon&quot;). Also along the Pacific slopes, the Santa River has shaped a wide valley in the &quot;punas&quot; which narrows into the Cordillera Negra, where the Cañón del Pato canyon was formed.

The snow-covered peak of Huascarán, the highest peak of Peru and second of the Americas, reaches a height of and contrasts with the deep trough of Chimbote found in the ocean west of Ancash. Remnants of glaciers created many lakes such as Llanganuco Lakes and Lake Parón.

Following the Pan-American Highway north from Lima, the territory of the department begins just beyond the Fortress of Paramonga, between wide fields of sugarcane, and across the Fortaleza River, from Lima.

Along the coast of Ancash, from the Fortaleza River to the Santa River, the Pacific exerts great influence. The Peruvian current and the El Niño current exert considerable and sometimes tragic effect on local lives and regional economies.

Normally, the Peruvian current, also known as the Humboldt Current, brings cold water and large numbers of fish. With the development of the shoals of anchoveta, the Ancash ports and creeks became commercial fishing centers. During the 1950s, the bay of Chimbote was the top fishing port of the world.

However, when warmer waters from the north, such as the current of El Niño, bring catastrophic rains to the coast and sea, the shoals of anchoveta disappear, leaving the fishing fleets plants paralysed, and flooding rivers cause serious damage to the lands and cities. The cycles of these two sea currents that affect Peru are hard to predict.

Further north along the Pan-American highway, numerous islands and islets dot the sea near the coast. Most are home only to guano seabirds. From south to north, the most important islands include Tortuga Island (Turtle Island), La Viuda Island (The Widow Island), Isla Blanca (White Island) and Santa Island (Holy Island).

The coastal region of Peru includes many peninsulas, creeks, warm bays and sand beaches, full of colour. Because of the lack of roads and difficult terrain, many of these are inaccessible by land. The most important beaches include Grande Beach, La Gramita Beach and Las Salinas Beach.

Much of this coast is a monotonous stretch of huge sand deserts, a common denominator in all Peruvian coastal regions because of the influence of the Humboldt Current.

Along the rivers, there are green valleys, cultivated mainly with sugarcane, rice and cotton. From south to north, the main rivers of the Ancash coast are the following: Huarmey, Culebras, Casma, Sechín, Nepeña, Lacramarca and Santa.

Of these rivers, the only one with water year-round is the Santa River. Its sources are the glaciers and lakes of the Cordillera Blanca. The other rivers, as with most rivers of the Peruvian coast, are intermittent, depending on the highland rains or the advance of El Niño.

== History ==

Between 400 and 600 BC, the first Peruvian civilization, known as Chavín, originated and flourished in this zone. The importance of this culture lies not only in its antiquity but in the history and culture it shares with other cultures along the Andean and Amazonian territories. As archaeologist Julio C. Tello put it, &quot;Chavín was the mother of all the cultures that later bloomed in the old Peru.&quot; The name &quot;Chavín&quot; comes from the Quechua word &quot;Chawpin&quot;, which translates as &quot;center&quot; or &quot;headquarters&quot;. Tello believed that people came from the Amazonas, scaled the Andes, and developed the Chavín culture.

During the Inca age, the population of the Santa valley was assimilated into the Inca empire by Pachacuti.

The first Spaniards came to Huaylas attracted by the fame of the silver veins of the department. In time, the Spanish destroyed the Inca cities. It was during this time that Jerónimo de Alvarado founded the city of Huaraz. Though in the Colonial Age this city held little importance and its artistic and cultural life did not have much relevance, it became the headquarters for Simón Bolívar during his campaign to liberate Peru.

The department of Ancash was created following the defeat of the Peru-Bolivia Confederation by the combined forces of the Peruvian restoration army and the Chilean army at the battle of Yungay in 1839.

The 1970 Ancash earthquake devastated the department, killing more than 50,000 people and damaging 186,000 houses in one of the deadliest natural disasters in Peru.

Today, most of the Ancash population is concentrated in the Callejón de Huaylas.

Beginning in 2011, the department has been the site of an ongoing anti-mining protest over allegations of water contamination and public versus private rights to the natural resources of the zone. Clashes between protesters, mining company security, and the federal police have resulted in numerous deaths and injuries.
== Political division ==
The department is divided into 20 provinces (&quot;provincias&quot;, singular: &quot;provincia&quot;), which comprise 166 districts (&quot;distritos&quot;, singular: &quot;distrito&quot;). Its capital is Huaraz. The provinces and their capitals are:

== Economy ==
The economy of Ancash, the third largest in Peru, is largely made up of gold, copper and zinc mining. Its coast is rich in fishing resources and it is the most productive fishing region of Peru (Peru is the world&#x27;s largest exporter of fish meal). Crops cultivated in Ancash include potatoes, wheat and barley.

== Demographics ==

=== Languages ===
According to the 2007 Peru Census, the language learnt first by most of the residents was Spanish (68.34%) followed by Quechua (31.36%). The Quechua variety spoken in Ancash is Ancash Quechua. The following table shows the results concerning the language learnt first in the Department of Ancash by province:

=== Ethnicity ===

Most of the population identifies Mestizo or Quechua.
=== Religion ===
=== Literacy ===
As of 2017, 85.3% (923,542) of the population is literate and 14.7% (158,839) of the population is illiterate.

== Toponyms ==
Many of the toponyms of the Department of Ancash originate from Quechua. In and around the Cordillera Blanca, in provinces like Huaylas and Yungay, these names are overwhelmingly predominant. Their Spanish-based orthography, however, is in conflict with the normalized alphabet of the language. According to Article 20 of &quot;Decreto Supremo No 004-2016-MC&quot; (Supreme Decree) which approves the Regulations to Law 29735, published in the state-owned newspaper El Peruano on 22 July 2016, adequate spellings of the toponyms in the normalised alphabets of the indigenous languages must progressively be proposed with the aim of standardizing the namings used by the National Geographic Institute &quot;(Instituto Geográfico Nacional, IGN)&quot;. The National Geographic Institute realizes the necessary changes in the official maps of Peru.

Contrarily to intentions to replace indigenous toponyms by other names like Santa Cruz or Contrahierbas, the Ministry of Culture proposes to the municipalities of the provinces to recover ancient indigenous toponyms and that these names should be spread by the local and communal authorities on posters and other signage.

== Tourism ==

The geographical centre of Ancash, the Callejón de Huaylas, is an area of intense interest to tourists. This is due to its large variety of natural attractions, its sport and recreational facilities, and the nearby archaeological remains of the ancient cultures that once flourished there. The Cordillera Blanca offers an interesting attraction for tourists visiting Peru. Visitors also come to see the natural beauty of the area&#x27;s glaciers and valleys and to enjoy the many lakes and thermal fountains.

Ancash is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Switzerland of Peru&quot;. There is the four mile high Huascarán, home to the Huascarán National Park. There is also the Alpamayo peak, considered one of the most beautiful in the world.

Among archaeological sites of interest, Ancash has many vestiges of old cultures, including the Guitarrero Cave (10,000 BC), the pre-Columbian ruins of Chavín de Huantar, Hunsakay, Willkawayin, Sechín, and Pañamarka are also well-known.

=== Tours ===
There are a few tours in the Department of Ancash that will let us know the main touristic and historical places of the zone. Among the principal ones are:

* Huaraz – Recuay – Catac – Pachaqutu ravine and Pastururi.
* Yungay – Llankanuku – Vaquería – Waripampa – Santa Cruz and Caraz
* Caraz, Cañon del Pato
* Huaraz – Pitiq – Qillqay and Juanca
* Caraz, Puya Raimondi at Mirador de Huinchus
* Huaraz – Olleros – Yanashallash – Chavín de Huantar – Qiruqucha and Catac
* Caraz, Parun Lake
* Catac and Carpa
* Huaraz – Willkawayin and Llaqa ravine
* Chacas – Perlilla
* Chacas – Huari

=== Pativilca-Caraz-Huallanca route ===
The historical village Pativilca (Lima Region), where Simón Bolívar planned his expedition for the liberation of Peru, lies 202 kilometres (126 mi) north of Lima on the Pan-American Highway. At this point begins the highway that leads to the Callejón de Huaylas. This road is completely paved, although it often had to be repaired because of the extreme damage caused by the &quot;huaycos&quot; (flash floods) and the rains. The same problem affects most Peruvian roads, especially the ones in the mountains (Quechua natural region and rainforest Rupa-Rupa natural region).

This highway is 287 kilometres (178 mi) long, with an extremely comfortable course, especially in the steep climbing stretches through the Cordillera Negra (Black Range) up to the summit of Conococha, 4,100 metres (13,451 ft) above sea level. From there, the road descends toward the Callejón de Huaylas.

The trip Lima-Huaraz-Caraz of 468 kilometres (254 mi) takes seven hours by car. Modern buses spend eight hours over the same stretch.

East of Pativilca, for about 20 kilometres (12 mi) the highway passes between wide fields planted with sugarcane in extensive fields, parallel to the Fortaleza River bed.

At the town Huaricanga the road enters the department of Ancash. At this point, the highway begins a slow ascent of the first spurs of the Cordillera Negra. This stretch continues for about 50 kilometres (31 mi). The climb gets suddenly steeper beyond the towns Chasquitambo and Chaucayán, with many bends and serpentines.

=== Cordillera Blanca ===

This mountain range is composed by gigantic summits covered with snow, which are among the most beautiful of the world. The White mountain range is considered the highest tropical mountain range in the world. It borders the Callejón de Huaylas to the east. It has a length of .

It has 35 peaks that are higher than 6,000 m and many other smaller ones, a real symphony of summits with different grades of difficulty in climbing.

This mountain range was called White, not only for its eternal snow but also for the chemical constitution of its quartz and feldspar rocks. It has the highest summit in Peru and the fifth one in America after Aconcagua, Ojos del Salado, Bonete and Mercedario: Huascarán, whose south peak reaches 6768 msnm. Huascarán&#x27;s north peak reaches 6655 m.

Alpamayo whose height has been estimated in 5,947 m, has been considered as &quot;the most beautiful snow mountain of the world&quot;. This statement was achieved by the distinguished Peruvian mountaineer César Morales Arnao who sent the photo of Alpamayo to the world contest of scenic beauty made in 1966 in Munich, Germany.

Huandoy N reaches 6,395 m, Huantsán reaches 6410 m, Chopicalqui reaches 6354 m, Copa N reaches 6173 m, Artesonraju reaches 6025 m, Santa Cruz S reaches 6,259 m and Hualcán reaches 6,126 m.

The beauty of the Cordillera Blanca is largely determined by the Cordillera Negra because this mountain range softens the winds that come from the Pacific Ocean. The Cordillera Negra, acting as a shield, avoids the thaw of the big glaciers from the Cordillera Blanca.

The Cordillera Negra has rocky peaks with very little winter snowfall, reaching a maximum height of 5500 m. Its name comes from the comparison with the white snowy peaks of the Cordillera Blanca.

=== Huascarán National Park ===
The Huascarán National Park is one of the most outstanding conservation parks in Peru, due to its landscapes that are full of peaks, lakes, canyons, torrents and waterfalls. Inside its borders, it can be observed the whole Cordillera Blanca and seven peaks of more than 6000 m height. They constitute one of the main international focuses for climbers and mountaineers. It was stated as a National Park on July 1, 1975, with a surface of 340,000 ha and a length of . This National Park includes parts of the following provinces: Recuay, Huaraz, Carhuaz, Yungay, Huaylas, Pomabamba, Mariscal Luzuriaga, Huari, Corongo, Sihuas and Bolognesi. This park has also been listed as a biosphere reservation and as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

The park territory is very uneven. It has snowy summits, which altitudes vary between 5000 and 6768 MSL. It also has gullies, that are deeply encased because of the fluvioglacial erosion, and a great number of lagoons. Inside the borders of the park, there are 663 glaciers that are distributed throughout 180 km, from the Tuku in the south up to the Champara in the north.

Regarding its climate, there are two very well defined seasons: The dry season from April to September becoming worse between the months of June and August and the wet season from October to May whose highest rainfall is between January and March.

Its flora is countless and beautiful, including important groups of Puya Raimondi. In its fauna, there are , spectacled bears, vicuñas, pumas, foxes, vizcachas, weasels, Andean mountain cats, opossums, hog-nosed skunks, etc.

There is also a great number of birds, predominantly ducks, American coots and hummingbirds.

=== Cordillera Negra ===
The route Casma-Huaraz is not a very highly travelled road. The highway begins with a paved path that arrives up to Yaután. Then it quickly begins to ascend through an unpaved path by the sides of the Cordillera Negra, following the course of the Casma River. This route becomes more steep once it arrives to Pariacoto. Along the road, there are not important towns at all, except for Pira that offers some traveler&#x27;s services.

This route, extremely steep and narrow, goes between big abysses and gullies. It can be seen small rural districts with chacras (smallholdings) that have been sown with potatoes, wheat, barley and other food products. It can also be seen livestock and a lot of human activity.

The gullies of the Cordillera Negra -that goes, simultaneously, with the Cordillera Blanca throughout 150 km- are gloomy and dark. Most of them are dry or their flow is scarce. From north to south, there are some hills like Rumicruz (5,020 m), Rocarre (5,187 m), Cerro Rico (5,015 m), and Chunta (4,810 m).

The beauty of the Cordillera Blanca is largely determined by the Cordillera Negra because this mountain range soften the winds that come from the Pacific Ocean. The Cordillera Negra acts like a shield and avoids the thaw of the big glaciers that are located in the Cordillera Blanca.

The Cordillera Negra has rocky peaks with very little winter snow, reaching a maximum height of 5,500 m. Its name comes from the comparison with the white snowy peaks of the Cordillera Blanca.

=== Extreme sports ===
Extreme sports in the Callejón de Huaylas and the Huascarán National Park:

*Mountaineering: the glaciers of the Cordillera Blanca constitute one of the most important world scenarios for ice climbing. Mountaineering can be practiced the whole year but the weather is best between the months of May and September.
*Trekking: the prehispanic paths offer excellent opportunities for trekking during the whole year. On the way, it can be observed varied flora, fauna, impressive snowy mountains, gullies and deep canyons, archaeological sites and several typical villages. There are several routes that last from one day to three weeks.
*Camping: it is a pleasant and a relaxing experience to spend the night under the moonlight, having as a unique companion: the stars and some constellations like Capricornus, Crux, Centaurus and others. This sport can be practiced at any time of the year.
*Canoeing: the Santa River has the technical characteristics and different difficulty grades for practicing river sports as canoeing, kayak and others. For example, there are some rapids between Anta and Caraz that are good for those who are just beginning to practice this sport. The lakes Llankanuku and Qiruqucha also offer some special characteristic for a boat ride.
*Cycling: the cyclists that ride on the highways and roads enjoy the practice of this sport by traveling inside and outside the Huascarán National Park. This sport can be practiced at any time of the year. The north area, near Caraz, offers the best rides, single tracks and down hill tracks.
*Rock climbing: the granite belt that goes round the glaciers of the Cordillera Blanca constitutes the suitable place for practicing this sport. There are walls from 100 m to 1000 m of height that have many kinds of technical difficulties to get through. There is an odd scenario for this sport called Rocódromo de Monterrey.
*Alpine skiing: it consists on slipping from the glaciers. The most favorable ones for practicing this sport are: Pastururi, Copa, Wallqan, Huascarán, Wallunarahu and Perlilla, the latter being recently discovered and promoted by the local government of the Asunción Province, with of moderate and steep slopes where competitions were held soon snowboarding and alpine skiing. These snowcapped mountains are ideal for practicing the slide on snow (also known as siquiesqui) and for making snowmen.
*Paragliding – Hang gliding: along the Callejón de Huaylas there are several places that are favourable for the practice of these flight sports. They can be practiced at any time of the year.
*Horse riding: it is a sport of big emotions. It is practiced on bridle paths with Peruvian horses that were raised in the Callejón de Huaylas.
*Fishing: the rod fishing of trout can be practiced in rivers and lagoons of the Cordillera Blanca and Cordillera Negra at any time of the year.

=== Santa River and the Cañón del Pato ===

From Chimbote to Huallanca, there are approximately . This unpaved and very little travelled highway is a provisional line over the embankment of the old railroad. This railway and several tunnels were destroyed by the catastrophe of 1970.

The highway, outside Chimbote, goes through the wide flat and fertile embankments of the Santa valley and it continuous its course up to Huallanca.

From Chuquicara, the highway becomes narrower. The Chuquicara River is a major right-hand tributary of the Santa River. Its waters are black because they contain abundant coal sediments proceeding from the heights of Pallasca.

From Huallanca, it is possible to travel through the Cañón del Pato. This canyon is one of the many canyons that are along the of the Santa River. The Santa River has its source in the lake Conococha. This river is the most important river in the coast, because its annual water mass is 6100 million m3. As centuries went by, it has formed a narrow pass of 2000 m of altitude in the Cordillera Negra.

In this place, the waters turn into whirlpools and rapids before going out from a narrow gorge of 500 m that is called Cañón del Pato (Duck Canyon). This waterfall constitutes the source of hydroelectric energy in the power station of the Cañón del Pato, in Huallanca.

From Huallanca, it is possible to enter the Callejón de Huaylas by the highway that goes to Caraz. It is also a way to enter the Callejón de Conchucos (Conchucos valley).

=== Callejón de Conchucos ===

The Callejón de Conchucos is a beautiful succession of valleys located to the east of the Cordillera Blanca. It is connected by a highway from Catac to Huallanca.

There are eight provinces of the Ancash Region that cover the Callejón de Conchucos. They are Huari, Asunción, Antonio Raymondi, Mariscal Luzuriaga, Pomabamba, Sihuas, Corongo and Pallasca. This Callejón is located to the east of the Cordillera Blanca, that is to say, to the other side of the Callejón de Huaylas, before the Marañón River.

The topography of the soil presents high summits, deep valleys and inhospitable punas, making it a rough zone, such as most of the highland in Peru.

The northern provinces of Pallasca Province and Corongo Province have their own direct access towards Chimbote and the Callejón de Huaylas. The other provinces have a longitudinal highway of double entry, one from Huari Province and the other one from Huallanca District and Sihuas Province, joining Pomabamba Province, Mariscal Luzuriaga Province and Antonio Raymondi Province.

== Transportation ==

Five main highways cross the department: 
* The North Pan-American highway, that crosses the coast of Ancash longitudinally.
* Three east-west highways that connect the coast with the region of the highlands, most importantly the Callejón de Huaylas:
** Pativilca – Huaraz – Caraz – Huallanca
** Nepeña – Pamparumas – Caraz
** Huarmey – Aija – Recuay
** Casma – Huaraz
** Chimbote – Huallanca – Caraz
* One highway that crosses the Callejón de Conchucos (Conchucos Alley) longitudinally, to the east of the Cordillera Blanca.

In addition, the region has a network of local roads.

<doc id="263228" wikidata="Q3267783" url="?curid=263228" title="Handbrake turn">
<text>The handbrake turn (also known as a bootleg or bootlegger&#x27;s turn) is a driving technique used to deliberately slide a car sideways, either for the purpose of quickly negotiating a very tight bend, or for turning around well within the vehicle&#x27;s own turning diameter.

==Technique==
The driver starts by using steering input to transfer weight to the outside tires; the handbrake is then used to lock the rear wheels, thus upsetting the adhesion between the tires and the road surface. With practice, the car can be placed accurately by releasing the handbrake and accelerating the vehicle. The technique is used in some forms of motorsport, for example rallying, autotesting, drifting and motorkhana.

Many sports cars, especially UK makes such as MG and Triumph, as late as the early 1970s were offered with a fly-off handbrake option for competition purposes—the button on the end of the lever has to be pressed before the brake will lock on, which is the reverse of the normal arrangement—allowing for faster and more controlled application in a handbrake turn, and less liable to be accidentally locked on while doing such a maneuver.

In a rear-wheel drive manual transmission vehicle, it is also necessary to operate the clutch to prevent the handbrake from stalling the engine.

==Physics involved==
In a normal turn, rear wheels follow the front ones because resistance to motion in the forward direction (in which the wheels turn) is significantly less than in the sideways direction. The latter provides the centripetal force that makes the rear end of the car follow the turn. When the driver locks the rear wheels with the handbrake, both directions offer the same resistance, so the rear end tends to keep moving in the existing direction (due to inertia) and thus slides out.

==Usage==
Handbrake turns are primarily a technique used to negotiate tight turns in motorsport but can also be used in certain other applications such as stunt or pursuit driving.

For stunt purposes, parallel parking can be completed in a single motion using the handbrake. This technique is often demonstrated at car shows, demonstrating the vehicle&#x27;s agility and the driver&#x27;s control.

In pursuit driving, the technique can be used for turning the car around in the width of two lanes without using a three-point maneuver (see bootleg turn), for example, to bewilder a pursuer. It can also be used to quickly negotiate tight corners.

The handbrake turn has colloquially been called the bootlegger&#x27;s turn in the US as it was reported to be used by bootleggers transporting illegally manufactured alcoholic drinks while escaping from the IRS. It has been reportedly used by boy racers on public roads as a manoeuvre to show off to their friends.

==Usage in drifting and rallying==
Whereas pulling the handbrake is the easiest way to start a drift, it is rarely used in circuit racing because it causes a significant loss of speed at the exit of the corner. Racers use handbrake turning only to negotiate tight 180-degree bends that would otherwise require a three-point turn. 

Handbrake turns are commonly used in rallying to negotiate tight, low-speed corners, and also as a means of performing manoeuvres and stunts.

==Dangers==
The handbrake turn is not recommended for novice racing drivers, as pulling the brake with too little or too much force will not lock the wheels correctly to allow the vehicle to negotiate the corner correctly.

Like other methods of inducing a drift, the handbrake turn does pose a serious risk of the vehicle flipping over, and caution must be taken when performing the maneuver with a vehicle with a high center of gravity (such as an SUV). The basic danger lies in bad judgment of surroundings, resulting in the sliding vehicle hitting an obstacle (another vehicle, a guardrail or a tree), or bad judgment of speed, resulting in the vehicle driving off the road entirely rather than sliding, or releasing the handbrake when the vehicle is moving sideways so that all tire forces are sideways.

<doc id="263233" wikidata="Q2861077" url="?curid=263233" title="Hand-waving">
<text>Hand-waving (with various spellings) is a pejorative label for attempting to be seen as effective – in word, reasoning, or deed – while actually doing nothing effective or substantial. It is often applied to debating techniques that involve fallacies, misdirection and the glossing over of details. It is also used academically to indicate unproven claims and skipped steps in proofs (sometimes intentionally, as in lectures and instructional materials), with some specific meanings in particular fields, including literary criticism, speculative fiction, mathematics, logic, science and engineering. 

The term can additionally be used in work situations, when attempts are made to display productivity or assure accountability without actually resulting in them. The term can also be used as a self-admission of, and suggestion to defer discussion about, an allegedly unimportant weakness in one&#x27;s own argument&#x27;s evidence, to forestall an opponent dwelling on it. In debate competition, certain cases of this form of hand-waving may be explicitly permitted.

&quot;Hand-waving&quot; is an idiomatic metaphor, derived in part from the use of excessive gesticulation, perceived as unproductive, distracting or nervous, in communication or other effort. The term also evokes the sleight-of-hand distraction techniques of stage magic, and suggests that the speaker or writer seems to believe that if they, figuratively speaking, simply wave their hands, no one will notice or speak up about the holes in the reasoning. This implication of misleading intent has been reinforced by the pop-culture influence of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, in which mystically powerful hand-waving is fictionally used for mind control, and some uses of the term in public discourse are explicit &quot;Star Wars&quot; references.

Actual hand-waving motions may be used either by a speaker to indicate a desire to avoid going into details, or by critics to indicate that they believe the proponent of an argument is engaging in a verbal hand-wave inappropriately.

== Spelling and history ==
The spelling of the compound varies (both with regard to this idiom and the everyday human communication gesture of waving). While &quot;hand-waving&quot; is the most common spelling of the unitary present participle and gerund in this usage, and &quot;hand-wave&quot; of the simple present verb, &quot;hand wave&quot; dominates as the noun-phrase form. &quot;Handwaving&quot; and &quot;handwave&quot; may be preferred in some circles, and are well attested. &quot;Hand waving&quot; is mostly used otherwise, e.g. &quot;she had one hand waving, the other on the rail&quot;, but is found in some dictionaries in this form. A more arch, mock-antiquarian construction is &quot;waving of [the] hands&quot;. Superlative constructions such as &quot;vigorous hand-waving&quot;, &quot;waved their hand[s] furiously&quot;, &quot;lots of waving of hands&quot;, etc., are used to imply that the hand-waver lacks confidence in the information being conveyed, cannot convincingly express or defend the core of the argument being advanced. The descriptive epithet &quot;hand-waver&quot; has been applied to those engaging in hand-waving, but is not common. The opposite of hand-waving is sometimes called nose-following in mathematics .

However it is spelled, the expression is also used in the original literal meaning of gesturing in a greeting, departing, excited, or attention-seeking manner by waving the hands, as in &quot;friendly were the hand-waving crowds ...&quot; (— Sinclair Lewis), which dates to the mid-17th century as a hyphenated verb and the early 19th century United States as a fully compounded verb. It is unclear when the figurative usage arose. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English&quot; lists it as &quot;extended use&quot;, and it appears primarily in modern American dictionaries, some of which label it as &quot;informal&quot;.

==In debate, generally==
Handwaving is frequently used in low-quality debate, including political campaigning and commentary, issue-based advocacy, advertising and public relations, tabloid journalism, opinion pieces, Internet memes, and informal discussion and writing. If the opponent in a debate or a commentator on an argument alleges hand-waving, it suggests that the proponent of the argument, position or message has engaged in one or more fallacies of logic, usually informal, and/or glossed over non-trivial details, and is attempting to challenges and deflect questions, as if swatting at flies. The &quot;distraction&quot; inherent in the sense of the term has become a key part of the meaning. The fallacies in question vary, but often include one of the many variants of argument to emotion, and in political discourse frequently involve unjustified assignment or transference of blame. Hand-waving is not itself a fallacy; the proponent&#x27;s argument may incidentally be correct despite their failure to properly support it. A tertiary meaning refers to use of poorly-reasoned arguments specifically to impress or to persuade.

&quot;The New Hacker&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Jargon File&quot;) observes:
The implication that hand-waving is done with the specific intent to mislead has long been attached to the term, due to the use of literal waving of a hand – either natural-looking or showy, but never desperate – by illusionists to distract audiences and misdirect their attention from the mechanisms of the sleight-of-hand, gimmicked props or other trick being used in the performance. This meaning has become reinforced in recent decades by the influence of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) and its sequels, in which the fictional Jedi mind trick involves a subtle hand wave with mystical powers – that only work on the weak-minded – to disguise reality and compel compliance. Consequently, there is an implication in current usage that a hand-waver may be craftily intending to deceive, and has a low opinion of the intelligence of the opponent or (especially) an audience or the general public. The labels &quot;Jedi hand wave&quot; and &quot;Jedi mind trick&quot; themselves are sometimes applied, in a tongue-in-cheek way, to this manipulation technique in public discourse; US Congressman Luke Messer&#x27;s use of it in reference to President Barack Obama&#x27;s 2016 State of the Union address generated headlines.

In an unplanned debate or presentation, an off-the-cuff essay, or an informal discussion, the proponent may have little or no time for preparation. Participants in such exchanges may use the term in reference to their own arguments, in the same sense as an author admitting a minor plot flaw . When the proponents use the term, they are conceding that they know an ancillary point of or intermediate step in their arguments is poorly supported; they are suggesting that such details are not important and do not affect their key arguments or conclusions, and that the hand-waved details should be excluded from current consideration. Examples include when they believe a statement is true but cannot prove it at that time, and when the sources upon which they are relying conflict in minor ways: &quot;I&#x27;m hand-waving over the exact statistics here, but they all show at least a 20% increase, so let&#x27;s move on&quot;.

In formal debate competition, certain forms of hand-waving may sometimes be explicitly permitted. In policy debate, the concept of &quot;fiat&quot; allows a team to pursue a line a reasoning based on a scenario that is not presently true, if a judge is satisfied that the case has been that it could become true.

==In literary criticism==

By extension, handwaving is used in literary, film and other media criticism of speculative fiction to refer to a plot device (e.g., a scientific discovery, a political development, or rules governing the behavior of a fictional creature) that is left unexplained or sloppily explained because it is convenient to the story, with the implication that the writer is aware of the logical weakness but hopes the audience will not notice or will suspend disbelief regarding such a macguffin, &quot;deus ex machina&quot;, continuity error or plot hole.

The fictional material &quot;handwavium&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;unobtainium&quot;, among other humorous names) is sometimes referred to in situations where the plot requires access to a substance of great value and properties that cannot be explained by real-world science, but is convenient to solving, or central to creating, a problem for the characters in the story. Perhaps the best known example is the spice melange, a fictional drug with supernatural properties, in Frank Herbert&#x27;s far-future science-fantasy epic, &quot;Dune&quot;.

&quot;Hand-waving&quot; has come to be used in role-playing games to describe actions and conversations that are quickly glossed over, rather than acted out in full according to the rules. This may be done to keep from bogging down the play of the game with time-consuming but minor details.

==In mathematics==

In mathematics, and disciplines in which mathematics plays a major role, &quot;hand-waving&quot; refers to either absence of formal proof or methods that do not meet mathematical rigor. In practice, it often involves the use of unrepresentative examples, unjustified assumptions, key omissions and faulty logic, and while these may be useful in expository papers and seminar presentations, they ultimately fall short of the standard of proof needed to establish a result. Proof by intimidation is one form of hand-waving.

The mathematical profession tends to be receptive to informed critiques from any listener, and a claimant to a new result is expected to be able to answer any such question with a logical argument, up to a full proof. Should a speaker apparently fail to give such an answer, anyone in the audience who can supply the needed demonstration may sometimes upstage the speaker. The objector in such a case might receive some measure credit for the theorem the hand-waver presented. The opposite of hand-waving in mathematics (and related fields) is sometimes called nose-following, which refers to the unimaginative development of a narrow line of reasoning that—while correct—can also end up making the subject dry and uninteresting.

The rationale for this culture of hyper-critical scrutiny is suggested by a quote of G. H. Hardy: &quot;[A mathematician&#x27;s] subject is the most curious of all—there is none in which truth plays such odd pranks. It has the most elaborate and the most fascinating technique, and gives unrivalled openings for the display of sheer professional skill.&quot;

==In applied science and engineering==

Hand-waving arguments in engineering and other applied sciences often include order-of-magnitude estimates and dimensional analysis, especially in the use of Fermi problems in physics and engineering education. However, competent, well-intentioned researchers and professors also rely on explicitly declared hand-waving when, given a limited time, a large result must be shown and minor technical details cannot be given much attention—e.g., &quot;it can be shown that is an even number&quot;, as an intermediary step in reaching a conclusion.
Another example of hand-waving can be found in the oversimplifications of the geologic representations commonly used in groundwater models created in support of land-development applications, especially those involving metal mining and aggregate extraction. 
Back-of-the-envelope calculations are approximate ways to get an answer by over-simplification, and are comparable to hand-waving in this sense.

==In business==
&quot;Hand-waving&quot; has been used to describe work-related situations where productivity is seemingly displayed, but deliverables are not produced, especially in the context of intentional engagement in busy work or pretend-work, vague claims of overwork or complications, impenetrably buzzword-laden rationalizations for delays or otherwise poor performance, and plausible-sounding but weak excuse-making and attention-deflecting tactics. In employment situations, as in political discourse, a hand-waving effort may seek to shift blame to other parties.

Another use is in reference to fiscal problems, such as an inability to adequately explain accounting discrepancies or an avoidance of accountability for missing funds.

<text>The Kreisau Circle (German: &quot;Kreisauer Kreis&quot;, ) (1940–1944) was a group of about twenty-five German dissidents in Nazi Germany led by Helmuth James von Moltke, who met at his estate in the rural town of Kreisau, Silesia. The circle was composed of men and a few women from a variety of backgrounds, including those of noble descent, devout Protestants and Catholics, intellectuals, military personnel, socialists and conservatives. Despite their differences, the members of the Kreisau Circle found common interest in their opposition to Hitler&#x27;s regime on moral and religious grounds. At their meetings, the circle discussed how they would reorganize the German government after the end of the Third Reich.

Although the circle did not promote violent overthrow of the regime, their planning was considered by the Nazis to be treasonous as it rested on the assumption that Germany would lose the war. The group began to falter after Helmuth von Moltke was arrested by the Gestapo in January 1944 and eventually came to an end when most of its members were arrested following Claus von Stauffenberg&#x27;s attempt on Hitler&#x27;s life on 20 July 1944.

== Intellectual background ==
The members of the Kreisau Circle were heavily influenced by popular movements in Germany that followed World War I, most notably the German Youth Movement and German religious socialism. Although motivated by differing ideologies (the German Youth Movement in a return to nature and religious socialism in a return to Christian values), each faction inspired resistance to the Nazi regime by encouraging their followers to reconsider traditionally rigid political, social, and religious distinctions and engage in discourse with those who disagreed with them. These fundamental similarities created an environment that allowed for persons of a variety of backgrounds to meet and participate in intellectual resistance to the Third Reich.

=== German Youth Movement ===
The German Youth Movement was characterized by the creation of various youth organizations that emphasized a return to nature since 1896. For example, the &quot;Wandervogel&quot;, a youth movement that arose in the early 20th century, encouraged youth to reject their middle-class upbringings that overemphasized materialism. The movement stressed the importance of the individual and emboldened them to pursue their interests rather than follow traditional class expectations.

Many members of the German youth groups were sent to war in 1914. Following great losses during the war, young men found themselves fascinated with Volkish ideology, the idea of reunification of the German people that transcended class distinctions. The preoccupation with the Volk made for an easy transition for some into Nazi ideology, but for others, such as Helmuth von Moltke, their roots in a youth movement that questioned the status quo led them to resist a regime that undermined the freedom which they sought through their youth organizations.

==== Löwenberger Arbeitsgemeinschaften (Löwenberger Working Groups) ====
An extension of the German Youth Movement, the Löwenberger Arbeitsgemeinschaften was an organization of college professors, youth movement leaders, unemployed workers, students, and farmers who came together to work in work camps and discuss social and political issues and solve the problems Silesia faced (i.e. high unemployment) in the aftermath of WWI. Between the days of 14 March and 1 April 1928, approximately one-hundred people from a variety of backgrounds came together for the first Silesian work camp. In the mornings, participants would partake in physical labour. This was followed by lecture courses, discussion groups, and leisure time. Two additional camps followed in 1929 and 1930. One participant described his time at the camps, &quot;Representatives of the three social groups in the nation were able to achieve a common language that had proved beyond the grasp of the older generation. A group such as this, which formed a cross-section of the community, was capable of rising above class and party interests&quot;. The camp allowed participants to cooperate with people of different upbringings and discuss how they could work together for the common good of their community. This lesson that people of differing social classes and political views could collaborate successfully would greatly influence Helmuth James von Moltke in his construction of the Kreisau Circle, who himself was an important contributor to the Löwenberger movement.

=== Religious Socialism in Germany ===
Religious socialism in 20th century Germany also influenced members of the Kreisau Circle. This movement is notably characterized by the work of Paul Tillich, who sought to fashion socialism into an ideology that was complementary with Christian faith. He looked to create “socialist political forms that were rooted in a religious substance”. Tillich called this socialism “theonomous”. Tillich emphasized the importance of social justice which he defined as &quot;the demand for a society in which it is possible for every individual and for every group to live meaningfully and purposefully, a demand for a meaningful society&quot;. 

Similarly to the youth movements, religious socialism challenged conventional political divisions. The movement asked followers not to focus on the differences between Christianity and socialism but rather see how the two could work together to create a better society. Prison chaplain Harald Poelchau, a member of the Kreisau Circle, was a close follower of Tillich, and other members such as , , Adolf Reichwein, and Adam von Trott zu Solz were also affiliated with religious socialism.

== Origins of the Circle ==
The Kreisau Circle was officially formed in 1940 with the merging of the intellectual circles of Helmuth James Graf von Moltke and Peter Graf Yorck von Wartenberg. Moltke and Yorck were descendants of prominent Prussian nobility and therefore were initially favored by Hitler&#x27;s regime. Helmuth von Moltke, for example, descended from Field Marshal von Moltke, who was a prominent military commander in the Bismarck era. The Nazis honored his family title by giving him a position in their High Command. Despite this special treatment, both men felt morally obliged to resist Hitler. In 1938, both men began to form separate social circles in which they discussed the problems of the Reich and their hopes for Germany&#x27;s future. Moltke&#x27;s circle, which included Einsiedel, was largely preoccupied with the sociological and economic problems that Germany would face after the Reich fell. Yorck&#x27;s circle, which began to meet frequently at his home, focused mostly on the administrative questions of how the government should run after Hitler&#x27;s regime had ended. In January 1940, Moltke was connected to Yorck through a mutual friend. They both agreed that the Third Reich&#x27;s defeat was inevitable and that a new government would have to be prepared to take over in this event. The two valued their common desire to oppose the regime through intellectual means despite differences in political views. The circle was formed in November 1940, against the backdrop of Hitler&#x27;s successes in France.

== Members ==
The membership of the Kreisau Circle was varied, with affiliates ranging from conservatives to socialists, religious and non-religious, and all of the above. Although Freya von Moltke, Helmuth von Moltke, Peter von Yorck and Marion von Yorck were at the center of the circle, the group was more of a network of friends than a formal organization. Freya von Moltke said her husband and Yorck searched for, “people who objected, who were opposed to National Socialism and were trying to envisage a better Germany beyond National Socialism, which at the time seemed completely impossible”. Their differences were valued as Moltke and Yorck believed that debate would assist them to accomplish their common goal for a better Germany following “X-day”, or the day after the end of the Reich.

=== Helmuth James Graf von Moltke ===
The Kreisau Circle&#x27;s most notable member was Helmuth James Graf von Moltke, who was considered to be the leader of the organization. Moltke was born on 11 March 1907 in Kreisau, Silesia to one of Prussia&#x27;s best known military families. The Moltke household encouraged discussion and debate. For instance, although both of Moltke&#x27;s parents were Christian Scientists, he became an Evangelical Christian at the age of 14. He attended university from 1925 to 1929 and studied law and political science. During this time, he became an important leader of the Lowenberger Arbeitsgemeinschaften. He also found himself drawn to the Schwarzwald Circle in 1929, which was an intellectual discussion group led by Eugenie Schwarzwald, where he met his future wife, Freya Deichmann. Later that year, Helmuth was forced to return home from school to Kreisau to manage his family&#x27;s estate. He married Freya on 18 October 1931. In 1932, the Kreisau Estate had been stabilized, allowing Helmuth to resume his career in law in Berlin. He eventually opened his own private firm along with his colleague Karl von Lewinski to practice international law. In this occupation, Moltke assisted Jewish émigrés to escape the Nazi regime despite the obvious threat that this presented to his own safety.

From 1935 to 1938, he spent time in England in hopes of joining the British bar. Although these plans were halted by the declaration of war in September 1939, it was during this time that Moltke gained many of his connections outside of Germany. He returned to Berlin and was drafted into the &quot;Abwehr&quot;, where he attempted to ensure adherence to international law. During this time, Moltke kept in contact with his friends from the Silesian work camps, such as Horst von Einsendel. They largely discussed sociological and economic consequences of the Third Reich. In January 1940, Moltke met Peter Graf Yorck von Wartenburg. By November 1940, the circles of Moltke and Yorck had merged to create the Kreisau Circle.

=== Peter Graf Yorck von Wartenburg ===
Peter Graf Yorck von Wartenburg was born on 13 November 1904 to a well-known family of Prussian nobles. The family emphasized the importance of scholarship and the arts and encouraged opposition to authority. Peter&#x27;s father, Heinrich, called himself &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s most loyal opposition&quot;. Yorck studied law in Bonn and Breslau and during this time became critical of the failing republic. Following Kristallnacht in 1938 and a trip to Prague that made him realize the Nazis&#x27; imperialist intentions, Yorck became increasingly troubled with Hitler&#x27;s regime and began to bring groups of dissenters to his home to discuss what was to be done after the fall of the Third Reich. Members of these initial groups would later become a part of the Kreisau Circle.

=== Women in the Kreisau Circle ===
The participation of women in the Kreisau Circle discussion was often limited to the presence of their husbands. Freya von Moltke, a founding participant, was cut off from the circle&#x27;s correspondence following her husband Helmuth von Moltke&#x27;s arrest. There are also no known female members who were not married to a male member. However, despite these limitations, women played an integral role in the Kreisau Circle. Margrit von Trotha, for example, utilized her skills as an economist to partake in the plans for Germany&#x27;s future economy. In addition, in Marion Yorck von Wartenburg&#x27;s memoirs, she refers to the circle as &quot;our group&quot;, indicating that she was a part of the circle&#x27;s membership and discourse. A known list of female members of the circle includes: Freya von Moltke (lawyer), Marion Yorck von Wartenburg (lawyer), Margrit von Trotha (economist), Rosemarie Reichwein (physician/therapist), and Irene Yorck von Wartenburg.

=== Other Protestant members ===
Additional Protestant members of the circle included Horst von Einsiedel, Carl-Dietrich von Trotha, Adolf Reichwein, Otto von der Gablentz, Theodor Steltzer, Adam von Trott, Hans-Bernd von Haeften, Harald Poelchau, and Eugen Gerstenmaier.

=== Catholic members ===
Catholic members included Hans Peters, Hans Lukaschek, Paulus Husen, Augustin Rösch, Lothar Konig, and Alfred Delp.

=== Socialist members ===
Socialists members included Carlo Mierendorff, Theodor Haubach, and Julius Leber.

== Proposals for the future ==
The activities of the Kreisau Circle formed around the idea that the fall of the Third Reich was in the near future. The day after this day when the new government would need to take over was referred to as &quot;Day X&quot;. This day would mark the beginning of a new Germany and the end of an historical era. Therefore, based on this assumption, the job of the Kreisau Circle was to prepare for this day. On 24 April 1941, the Kreisau Circle created a memorandum titled, &quot;Starting-point, Objectives and Tasks&quot;. In this text, the Circle expresses their belief that with the end of the Third Reich would also come the end of nationalism, racism, and party politics.

Although a general consensus existed regarding the imminent fall of the Third Reich, the question of what this reformed Germany would look like remained up for debate. According to Freya von Moltke, some of the most pressing questions that the group sought to answer were, &quot;How can I make democrats out of Germans who had not been able, really, to run a democracy properly?&quot; and &quot;How to build a new economy and whether it should be free or not free&quot;.

In 1943, Moltke began to prepare formal drafts for a new German constitution to answer these questions. In a constitutional draft made on 9 August 1943, Moltke outlined a new Reich structure which would be self-governing and rest upon the, “natural divisions of the nation: family, municipality, and land”. Basic freedoms were to be restored. Germany would become a federal state with a weak central government, divided into provinces of between 3 and 5 million people, the provinces would also be divided into self-governing communities, organised into districts. The regions would have parliaments elected by the district assemblies. The minimum voting age would be 27. The eligible voters, which Moltke defined as all persons over the age of 21 or have served in the military, would elect municipal and county representative assemblies. These district assemblies would then elect the regional legislature, which would have the responsibility of electing those in the Reichstag. In the realm of culture and education, Moltke emphasized the importance of a renewed relationship with the German Evangelical Church and the German Catholic Church. Moltke and other members in the circle wanted a restoration of Christian values that they felt had been lost and led to Hitler&#x27;s regime. With the return of Christian values, the group believed that greater acceptance and cooperation between all peoples would occur and lead to the political unification of the European continent. However, this is not to be mistaken for intolerance of other religions, as Moltke emphasizes that in this new government, &quot;The freedom of [religious] faith and conscience is guaranteed&quot;. Moltke hoped this government would create a unified Germany where freedom and personal responsibility would be complementary to order and leadership.

== End of the Kreisau Circle ==

=== Arrests in January 1944 ===
In the autumn of 1943, Helmuth von Moltke learned from an informant that a Gestapo spy had discovered an anti-Nazi salon in Berlin and that there would be a round-up of all participants. Moltke warned his friend who had been present at the salon, Otto Kiep, of the round-ups. Kiep, former German Consul General in New York and member of the Abwehr&#x27;s counterintelligence department under Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, failed to escape and was arrested in January 1944. The Gestapo later discovered that von Moltke had warned him of the arrests, and Helmuth himself was then arrested on 19 January 1944. This left the Kreisau Circle without one of its integral members. Freya von Moltke was also ousted from the group following Helmuth&#x27;s arrest as the members were worried she would be interrogated. During this time, Yorck struggled to maintain cohesion of the group. However, this was not the death knell of the circle as the Gestapo was not yet aware of the resistance. Prior to the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler, Helmuth von Moltke was treated fairly in prison and allowed to correspond with his wife Freya.

=== 20 July 1944 attempt and executions ===
On 20 July 1944 a group of dissidents attempted to assassinate Hitler with a bomb and failed. Claus von Stauffenberg, cousin of Peter Yorck, was among the leading figures in this attempt to create &quot;Day-X&quot;. However, the bombing only injured Hitler and led to a series of arrests. Peter Yorck was arrested and executed on 8 August 1944 for his involvement. Although Moltke himself was not involved, his close association with Yorck proved fatal as he was also executed on 23 January 1945. These arrests and executions signaled the formal end of the activities of the Kreisau Circle.

== Legacy ==
When &quot;X-day&quot; finally came in May 1945, none of the Kreisau Circle&#x27;s proposals for Germany&#x27;s future were implemented. Although their plans never came to fruition, the legacy of resistance established by the Kreisau Circle still remains important. The members of Kreisau came together, despite their individual differences, to fashion a Germany which was democratic, anti-racist, and internationalist. Those at the Kreisau Circle committed treason and sacrificed their lives for their belief of a fairer society where opposition was heard, and that if heard together these voices could fashion a better world. They were idealists in a totalitarian regime which threatened to extinguish any trace of resistance.

Many of the surviving members of the circle continued to remain active after the war. For example, Marion Yorck received a judgeship in Berlin and Rosemarie Reichwein began her own physical therapy clinic. In addition, Freya von Moltke transformed the Kreisau estate into the Krzyzowa Foundation for Mutual Understanding in Europe on 10 July 1990. This foundation bases its work on the principles of the Kreisau Circle, and continues to look towards developing understanding between persons from different social, political, and cultural backgrounds.

<doc id="263244" wikidata="Q955948" url="?curid=263244" title="Ergotism">
<text>Ergotism (pron. ) is the effect of long-term ergot poisoning, traditionally due to the ingestion of the alkaloids produced by the &quot;Claviceps purpurea&quot; fungus—from the Latin &quot;club&quot; or clavus &quot;nail&quot; and for &quot;head&quot;, i.e. the purple club-headed fungus—that infects rye and other cereals, and more recently by the action of a number of ergoline-based drugs. It is also known as ergotoxicosis, ergot poisoning, and Saint Anthony&#x27;s fire.

==Signs and symptoms==
Ergotism is the effect of long-term ergot poisoning. The symptoms can be roughly divided into convulsive symptoms and gangrenous symptoms. 

Ergot alkaloids, the active compounds produced by the ergot fungus, can cause severe vasoconstriction, leading to symptoms like gangrene and convulsions. Additionally, ergot alkaloids can mimic neurotransmitters and hormones in the human body, causing hallucinations and affecting hormonal balance. Chronic exposure to ergot alkaloids has been linked to reproductive issues, such as spontaneous abortions and infertility, due to their action on the pituitary gland. 

===Convulsive===

Convulsive symptoms include painful seizures and spasms, diarrhea, paresthesias, itching, mental effects including mania or psychosis, headaches, nausea and vomiting. Usually the gastrointestinal effects precede central nervous system effects.

===Gangrenous===
The dry gangrene is a result of vasoconstriction induced by the ergotamine-ergocristine alkaloids of the fungus. It affects the more poorly vascularized distal structures, such as the fingers and toes. Symptoms include desquamation or peeling, weak peripheral pulses, loss of peripheral sensation, edema and ultimately the death and loss of affected tissues. Vasoconstriction is treated with vasodilators.

==Causes==

Historically, eating grain products, particularly rye, contaminated with the fungus &quot;Claviceps purpurea&quot; was the cause of ergotism.

The toxic ergoline derivatives are found in ergot-based drugs (such as methylergometrine, ergotamine or, previously, ergotoxine). The deleterious side effects occur either under high dose or when moderate doses interact with potentiators such as erythromycin.

The alkaloids can pass through lactation from mother to child, causing ergotism in infants.

===Identification of agent===

Dark-purple or black grain kernels, known as ergot bodies, can be identifiable in the heads of cereal or grass just before harvest. In most plants the ergot bodies are larger than normal grain kernels, but can be smaller if the grain is a type of wheat.

==Prevention==

Removal of ergot bodies is done by placing the yield in a brine solution; the ergot bodies float, while the healthy grains sink. Infested fields must be deep-ploughed; ergot cannot germinate if buried more than one inch (2.5 cm) in soil and therefore will not release its spores into the air. Rotating crops using non-susceptible plants helps reduce infestations, since ergot spores live only one year. Crop rotation and deep tillage, such as deep mold-board ploughing, are important components in managing ergot, as many cereal crops in the 21st century are sown with a &quot;no-till&quot; practice (new crops are sown directly into the stubble from the previous crop to reduce soil erosion). Wild and escaped grasses and pastures can be mown before they flower to help limit the spread of ergot.

Chemical controls can also be used but are not considered economical, especially in commercial operations, and germination of ergot spores can still occur under favourable conditions even with the use of such controls.

==History==

Throughout history, outbreaks of ergotism have been documented, particularly in Europe. One of the most notable incidents occurred in 944 AD in France, where ergot poisoning led to widespread hallucinations, gangrene, and convulsions. Another significant case is associated with the Salem witch trials in 1692, where some historians believe ergotism may have contributed to the symptoms reported by the accusers. 

Epidemics of the disease were identified throughout history, though the references in classical writings are inconclusive. Rye, the main vector (route) for transmitting ergotism, was not grown much around the Mediterranean. When Fuchs separated references to ergotism from erysipelas and other conditions in 1834, he found the earliest reference to ergotism in the &quot;Annales Xantenses&quot; for the year 857: &quot;a great plague of swollen blisters consumed the people by a loathsome rot, so that their limbs were loosened and fell off before death&quot;.

In the Middle Ages the gangrenous poisoning was known as &quot;holy fire&quot; or &quot;Saint Anthony&#x27;s fire&quot;, named after monks of the Order of St. Anthony, who were particularly successful at treating this ailment. According to Snorri Sturluson in his , King Magnus II of Norway, son of King Harald Sigurtharson, who was the half-brother of Saint King Olaf Haraldsson, died from ergotism shortly after the Battle of Hastings. The 12th-century chronicler Geoffroy du Breuil of Vigeois recorded the mysterious outbreaks in the Limousin region of France, where the gangrenous form of ergotism was associated with the local Saint Martial. Likewise, an outbreak in Paris around 1129 was reported to be cured by the relics of Saint Genevieve, a miracle commemorated in the &quot;Feast of the Burning Ones&quot;.

The blight, named cockspur owing to the appearance of infected grains, was identified and named by Denis Dodart, who reported the relation between ergotized rye and bread poisoning in a letter to the French Royal Academy of Sciences in 1676 (John Ray mentioned ergot for the first time in English the next year). &quot;Ergotism&quot; in this modern sense was first recorded in 1853.

Notable epidemics of ergotism occurred into the 19th century. Fewer outbreaks have occurred since then owing to rye being carefully monitored in developed countries. However, a severe outbreak of something akin to ergot poisoning occurred in the French village of Pont-Saint-Esprit in 1951, resulting in five deaths. The outbreak and the diagnostic confusion surrounding it are vividly described in John Grant Fuller&#x27;s book &quot;The Day of St Anthony&#x27;s Fire&quot;.

Ergot sclerotiums were found in the gut of the Grauballe Man, a bog body dated the late 3rd century BC.

When milled, the ergot is reduced to a red powder, obvious in lighter grasses but easy to miss in dark rye flour. In less wealthy countries, ergotism still occurs; an outbreak in Ethiopia occurred in mid-2001 from contaminated barley. Whenever there is a combination of moist weather, cool temperatures, delayed harvest in lowland crops and rye consumption, an outbreak is possible.

Poisonings due to consumption of seeds treated with mercury compounds are sometimes misidentified as ergotism. There have been numerous cases of mass-poisoning due to consumption of mercury-treated seeds.

===Salem witchcraft accusations===
The convulsive symptoms from ergot-tainted rye may have been the source of accusations of bewitchment that spurred the Salem witch trials. This medical explanation for the theory of &quot;bewitchment&quot; was first propounded by Linnda R. Caporael in 1976 in an article in &quot;Science&quot;. In her article, Caporael argues that the convulsive symptoms such as crawling sensations in the skin, tingling in the fingers, vertigo, &quot;tinnitus aurium&quot;, headaches, disturbances in sensation, hallucination, painful muscular contractions, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as psychological symptoms such as mania, melancholia, psychosis, and delirium, were all symptoms reported in the Salem witchcraft records. Caporael also states that there was an abundance of rye in the region, as well as climate conditions that could support the tainting of rye. In 1982, historian Mary Matossian raised Caporael&#x27;s theory in an article in &quot;American Scientist&quot;, in which she argued that symptoms of &quot;bewitchment&quot; resemble the ones exhibited in those affected by ergot poisoning.

The hypothesis that ergotism could explain cases of bewitchment has been subject to significant debate and has been criticized by several scholars. Within a year of Caporael&#x27;s article, historians Nicholas Spanos and Jack Gottlieb refuted the idea in the same journal. In Spanos and Gottlieb&#x27;s rebuttal to Caporael&#x27;s article, they concluded that there are several flaws in the explanation. They noted that if ergotism was present in Salem, the symptoms would have occurred by household, not individual. Whole families, and particularly all the young children in a household, would have shown symptoms, but this was not the case. In general, the proportion of children affected was significantly less than in a typical ergotism epidemic. Spanos and Gottlieb also state that most of ergot poisoning&#x27;s symptoms, like crawling and tingling sensations, vertigo, tinnitus, vomiting, and diarrhea, do not appear in the records of events in Salem. Lastly, they note that convulsive ergotism epidemics only take place in communities suffering from vitamin A deficiencies; they argued that residents of Salem, living in a farming community with ample access to dairy, would have had no reason to be deficient in vitamin A. Therefore, an outbreak of ergotism as the cause of the Salem epidemic was unlikely. Historians published in the early 21st century continue to stand by Spanos and Gottlieb&#x27;s conclusion.

Historian Leon Harrier has argued that only some members of a household might have shown symptoms because they had underlying conditions. Being chemically similar to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), ergot would not survive in the acidic environment of a typical human&#x27;s stomach, especially in properly cooked food. But if some residents of a household were malnourished and had bleeding stomach ulcers, those individuals would have had a heightened risk of absorbing the toxin (even with properly cooked food items) through the stomach lining, offering a direct route to the bloodstream. Only those with these preexisting conditions would have been affected by ingesting contaminated grains, leaving the majority unaffected. 

Anthropologist H. Sidky noted that ergotism had been known for centuries before the Salem witch trials and argued that its symptoms would have been recognizable during the time of the Salem witch trials. 

In 2003 it was pointed out that ergots produced by different strains of &quot;Claviceps purpurea&quot;, as well as those growing in different soils, may produce different ergot alkaloid compositions. This may explain the different manifestations of ergotism in different outbreaks. For example, an alkaloid present in high concentrations in ergots from Europe east of the Rhine may have caused convulsive ergotism, while ergot from the west caused epidemics of gangrenous ergotism.

== Cultural and religious beliefs ==
In medieval Europe, outbreaks of ergotism were sometimes interpreted as divine punishment or witchcraft. The condition&#x27;s symptoms, particularly hallucinations and convulsions, often led to accusations of demonic possession. The disease&#x27;s association with St. Anthony&#x27;s Fire is linked to the Order of St. Anthony, a medieval Christian order that provided care for ergotism sufferers.

== Environmental factors ==
The prevalence of ergotism was closely linked to environmental conditions, such as cold, damp weather, which promoted the growth of the ergot fungus. Poor storage of grain also contributed to the risk of contamination. Changes in agricultural practices and the introduction of disease-resistant crop varieties have largely eliminated ergotism in modern times.

<text>A first language (L1), native language, native tongue, or mother tongue is the first language a person has been exposed to from birth or within the critical period. In some countries, the term &quot;native language&quot; or &quot;mother tongue&quot; refers to the language of one&#x27;s ethnic group rather than the individual&#x27;s actual first language. Generally, to state a language as a mother tongue, one must have full native fluency in that language.

The first language of a child is part of that child&#x27;s personal, social and cultural identity. Another impact of the first language is that it brings about the reflection and learning of successful social patterns of acting and speaking. Research suggests that while a non-native speaker may develop fluency in a targeted language after about two years of immersion, it can take between five and seven years for that child to be on the same working level as their native speaking counterparts.

On 17 November 1999, UNESCO designated 21 February as International Mother Language Day.

== Definitions ==
The person qualifies as a &quot;native speaker&quot; of a language by being born and immersed in the language during youth, in a family in which the adults shared a similar language experience to the child. Native speakers are considered to be an authority on their given language because of their natural acquisition process regarding the language, as opposed to having learned the language later in life. That is achieved by personal interaction with the language and speakers of the language. Native speakers will not necessarily be knowledgeable about every grammatical rule of the language, but they will have good &quot;intuition&quot; of the rules through their experience with the language.

The designation &quot;native language&quot;, in its general usage, is thought to be imprecise and subject to various interpretations that are biased linguistically, especially with respect to bilingual children from ethnic minority groups. Many scholars have given definitions of &quot;native language&quot; based on common usage, the emotional relation of the speaker towards the language, and even its dominance in relation to the environment. However, all three criteria lack precision. For many children whose home language differs from the language of the environment (the &quot;official&quot; language), it is debatable which language is their &quot;native language&quot;.

===Defining &quot;native language&quot;===

*Based on origin: the language(s) or dialect one learned first (the language(s) or dialect in which one has established the first long-lasting verbal contacts).
*Based on internal identification: the language(s) one identifies with/as a speaker of;
*Based on external identification: the language(s) one is identified with/as a speaker of, by others.
*Based on competence: the language(s) one knows best.
*Based on function: the language(s) one uses most.

In some countries, such as Kenya, India, Belarus, Ukraine and various East Asian and Central Asian countries, &quot;mother language&quot; or &quot;native language&quot; is used to indicate the language of one&#x27;s ethnic group in both common and journalistic parlance (&quot;I have no apologies for not learning my mother tongue&quot;), rather than one&#x27;s first language. Also, in Singapore, &quot;mother tongue&quot; refers to the language of one&#x27;s ethnic group regardless of actual proficiency, and the &quot;first language&quot; refers to English, which was established on the island under the British Empire, and is the lingua franca for most post-independence Singaporeans because of its use as the language of instruction in government schools and as a working language.

In the context of population censuses conducted on the Canadian population, Statistics Canada defines the &quot;mother tongue&quot; as &quot;the first language learned at home in childhood and still understood by the individual at the time of the census.&quot;
It is quite possible that the first language learned is no longer a speaker&#x27;s dominant language. That includes young immigrant children whose families have moved to a new linguistic environment as well as people who learned their mother tongue as a young child at home (rather than the language of the majority of the community), who may have lost, in part or in totality, the language they first acquired (see language attrition). According to Ivan Illich, the term &quot;mother tongue&quot; was first used by Catholic monks to designate a particular language they used, instead of Latin, when they were &quot;speaking from the pulpit&quot;. That is, the &quot;holy mother the Church&quot; introduced this term and colonies inherited it from Christianity as a part of colonialism. J. R. R. Tolkien, in his 1955 lecture &quot;English and Welsh&quot;, distinguishes the &quot;native tongue&quot; from the &quot;cradle tongue&quot;. The latter is the language one learns during early childhood, and one&#x27;s true &quot;native tongue&quot; may be different, possibly determined by an inherited linguistic taste and may later in life be discovered by a strong emotional affinity to a specific dialect (Tolkien personally confessed to such an affinity to the Middle English of the West Midlands in particular).

Children brought up speaking more than one language can have more than one native language, and be bilingual or multilingual. By contrast, a &quot;second language&quot; is any language that one speaks other than one&#x27;s first language.

== Bilingualism ==
A related concept is bilingualism. One definition is that a person is bilingual if they are equally proficient in two languages. Someone who grows up speaking Spanish and then learns English for four years is bilingual only if they speak the two languages with equal fluency. Pearl and Lambert were the first to test only &quot;balanced&quot; bilinguals—that is, a child who is completely fluent in two languages and feels that neither is their &quot;native&quot; language because they grasp both so perfectly. This study found that

*balanced bilinguals perform significantly better in tasks that require flexibility (they constantly shift between the two known languages depending on the situation),
*they are more aware of the arbitrary nature of language,
*they choose word associations based on logical rather than phonetic preferences.

==Multilingualism==
One can have two or more native languages, thus being a native &quot;bilingual&quot; or indeed &quot;multilingual&quot;. The order in which these languages are learned is not necessarily the order of proficiency. For instance, if a French-speaking couple have a child who learned French first but then grew up in an English-speaking country, the child would likely be most proficient in English.
===Defining &quot;native speaker&quot;===
Defining what constitutes a native speaker is difficult, and there is no test which can identify one. It is not known whether native speakers are a defined group of people, or if the concept should be thought of as a perfect prototype to which actual speakers may or may not conform.

An article titled &quot;The Native Speaker: An Achievable Model?&quot; published by the Asian EFL Journal states that there are six general principles that relate to the definition of &quot;native speaker&quot;. The principles, according to the study, are typically accepted by language experts across the scientific field. A native speaker is defined according to the following guidelines:

#The individual acquired the language in early childhood and maintains the use of the language.
#The individual has intuitive knowledge of the language.
#The individual is able to produce fluent, spontaneous discourse.
#The individual is communicatively competent in different social contexts.
#The individual identifies with or is identified by a language community.
#The individual does not have a foreign accent.

<text>Bai Shouyi (; February 1909 – March 21, 2000), also known as Djamal al-Din Bai Shouyi, was a Chinese ethnologist, historian, social activist, and writer who revolutionized recent Chinese historiography and pioneered in relying heavily on scientific excavations and reports. A Marxist philosophically, his studies thus take a very class-centric view and reasoning.
Born a son of a Hui merchant in Kaifeng, he became literate in Arabic from his mother and aunt.

Bai argued for the need for increased awareness of Islam and Muslims by the Chinese population in general in 1937, since Muslims numbered 50 million in China alone and western works were the only works available for non-Muslim Chinese to study Muslims living right with them in China. He said Muslims in Western China could either stand as a &quot;defensive wall&quot; or &quot;hinder ...national defence&quot;, depending on whether conduct to them was good or bad.

He died in Beijing at the age of 91.

<doc id="263261" wikidata="Q833926" url="?curid=263261" title="Sacco and Vanzetti">
<text>Nicola Sacco (; April 22, 1891 – August 23, 1927) and Bartolomeo Vanzetti (; June 11, 1888 – August 23, 1927) were Italian immigrants and anarchists who were controversially convicted of murdering Alessandro Berardelli and Frederick Parmenter, a guard and a paymaster, during the April 15, 1920, armed robbery of the Slater and Morrill Shoe Company in Braintree, Massachusetts, United States. Seven years later, they were executed in the electric chair at Charlestown State Prison.

After a few hours&#x27; deliberation on July 14, 1921, the jury convicted Sacco and Vanzetti of first-degree murder and they were sentenced to death by the trial judge. Anti-Italianism, anti-immigrant, and anti-anarchist bias were suspected as having heavily influenced the verdict. A series of appeals followed, funded largely by the private Sacco and Vanzetti Defense Committee. The appeals were based on recanted testimony, conflicting ballistics evidence, a prejudicial pretrial statement by the jury foreman, and a confession by an alleged participant in the robbery. All appeals were denied by trial judge Webster Thayer and also later denied by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. By 1926, the case had drawn worldwide attention. As details of the trial and the men&#x27;s suspected innocence became known, Sacco and Vanzetti became the center of one of the largest causes célèbres in modern history. In 1927, protests on their behalf were held in every major city in North America and Europe, as well as in Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Montevideo, Johannesburg, and Auckland.

Celebrated writers, artists, and academics pleaded for their pardon or for a new trial. Harvard law professor and future Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter argued for their innocence in a widely read &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; article that was later published in book form. Even the Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini was convinced of their innocence and attempted to pressure American authorities to have them released. The two were scheduled to be executed in April 1927, accelerating the outcry. Responding to a massive influx of telegrams urging their pardon, Massachusetts governor Alvan T. Fuller appointed a three-man commission to investigate the case. After weeks of secret deliberation that included interviews with the judge, lawyers, and several witnesses, the commission upheld the verdict. Sacco and Vanzetti were executed in the electric chair just after midnight on August 23, 1927.

Investigations in the aftermath of the executions continued throughout the 1930s and &#x27;40s. The publication of the men&#x27;s letters, containing eloquent professions of innocence, intensified the public&#x27;s belief in their wrongful execution. However, a ballistic test performed in 1961 proved that the pistol found on Sacco was indeed used to commit the murders. On August 23, 1977—the 50th anniversary of the executions—Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis issued a proclamation that Sacco and Vanzetti had been unfairly tried and convicted and that &quot;any disgrace should be forever removed from their names&quot;. The proclamation however, did not include a pardon.

==Background==

Sacco was a shoemaker and a night watchman, born April 22, 1891, in Torremaggiore, Province of Foggia, Apulia region (in Italian: &quot;Puglia&quot;), Italy, who migrated to the United States at the age of seventeen. Before immigrating, according to a letter he sent while imprisoned, Sacco worked on his father&#x27;s vineyard, often sleeping out in the field at night to prevent animals from destroying the crops. Vanzetti was a fishmonger born June 11, 1888, in Villafalletto, Province of Cuneo, Piedmont region. Both left Italy for the US in 1908, although they did not meet until a 1917 strike.

The men were believed to be followers of Luigi Galleani, an Italian anarchist who advocated revolutionary violence, including bombing and assassination. Galleani published &quot;Cronaca Sovversiva&quot; (&quot;Subversive Chronicle&quot;), a periodical that advocated violent revolution, and a bomb-making manual called &quot;La Salute è in voi!&quot; (&quot;Salvation Is within You!&quot;). At the time, Italian anarchists—in particular the Galleanist group—ranked at the top of the United States government&#x27;s list of dangerous enemies. Since 1914, the Galleanists had been identified as suspects in several violent bombings and assassination attempts, including an attempted mass poisoning. Publication of &quot;Cronaca Sovversiva&quot; was suppressed in July 1918, and the government deported Galleani and eight of his closest associates on June 24, 1919.

Other Galleanists remained active for three years, 60 of whom waged an intermittent campaign of violence against US politicians, judges, and other federal and local officials, especially those who had supported deportation of alien radicals. Among the dozen or more violent acts was the bombing of Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer&#x27;s home on June 2, 1919. In that incident, Carlo Valdinocci, a former editor of &quot;Cronaca Sovversiva&quot;, was killed when the bomb intended for Palmer exploded in the editor&#x27;s hands. Radical pamphlets entitled &quot;Plain Words&quot; signed &quot;The Anarchist Fighters&quot; were found at the scene of this and several other midnight bombings that night.

Several Galleanist associates were suspected or interrogated about their roles in the bombing incidents. Two days before Sacco and Vanzetti were arrested, a Galleanist named Andrea Salsedo fell to his death from the US Justice Department&#x27;s Bureau of Investigation (BOI) offices on the 14th floor of 15 Park Row in New York City. Salsedo had worked in the Canzani Printshop in Brooklyn, to where federal agents traced the &quot;Plain Words&quot; leaflet.

Roberto Elia, a fellow New York printer and admitted anarchist, was later deposed in the inquiry, and testified that Salsedo had committed suicide for fear of betraying the others. He portrayed himself as the &#x27;strong&#x27; one who had resisted the police. According to anarchist writer Carlo Tresca, Elia changed his story later, stating that Federal agents had thrown Salsedo out the window.

==Robbery==


The Slater-Morrill Shoe Company factory was located on Pearl Street in Braintree, Massachusetts. On April 15, 1920, two men were robbed and killed while transporting the company&#x27;s payroll in two large steel boxes to the main factory. One of them, Alessandro Berardelli—a security guard—was shot four times as he reached for his hip-holstered .38-caliber, Harrington &amp; Richardson revolver; his gun was not recovered from the scene. The other man, Frederick Parmenter—a paymaster who was unarmed—was shot twice: once in the chest and a second time, fatally, in the back as he attempted to flee. The robbers seized the payroll boxes and escaped in a stolen dark blue Buick that was carrying several other men.

As the car was being driven away by Michael Codispoti, the robbers fired wildly at company workers nearby. A coroner&#x27;s report and subsequent ballistic investigation revealed that six bullets removed from the murdered men&#x27;s bodies were of .32 automatic (ACP) caliber. Five of these .32-caliber bullets were all fired from a single semi-automatic pistol, a .32-caliber Savage Model 1907, which used a particularly narrow-grooved barrel rifling with a right-hand twist. Two of the bullets were recovered from Berardelli&#x27;s body. Four .32 automatic brass shell casings were found at the murder scene, manufactured by one of three firms: Peters, Winchester, or Remington. The Winchester cartridge case was of a relatively obsolete cartridge loading, which had been discontinued from production some years earlier. Two days after the robbery, police located the robbers&#x27; Buick; several 12-gauge shotgun shells were found on the ground nearby.

==Arrests and indictment==
An earlier attempted (unsuccessful) robbery of another shoe factory payroll occurred on December 24, 1919, in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, by four persons identified as Italian who used a car that was seen escaping to Cochesett in West Bridgewater. A delivery truck for the L.Q. White Shoe Factory was taking a $33,113.31 payroll with a driver, paymaster and a police constable. The assailants in a car tried to hijack the truck with one robber using a pistol and the other a double-barrelled shotgun. Police speculated that Italian anarchists perpetrated the robberies to finance their activities. Bridgewater police chief Michael E. Stewart suspected that known Italian anarchist Ferruccio Coacci was involved. Stewart discovered that Mario Buda (aka &#x27;Mike&#x27; Boda) lived with Coacci.

When Chief Stewart later arrived at the Coacci home, only Buda was living there, and when questioned, he said that Coacci owned a .32 Savage automatic pistol, which he kept in the kitchen. A search of the kitchen did not locate the gun, but Stewart found (in a kitchen drawer) a manufacturer&#x27;s technical diagram for a Model 1907 of the exact type of .32 caliber pistol used to shoot Parmenter and Berardelli. Stewart asked Buda if he owned a gun, and the man produced a .32-caliber Spanish-made automatic pistol. Buda told police that he owned a 1914 Overland automobile, which was being repaired. The car was delivered for repairs four days after the Braintree crimes, but it was old and apparently had not been run for five months. Tire tracks were seen near the abandoned Buick getaway car, and Chief Stewart surmised that two cars had been used in the getaway, and that Buda&#x27;s car might have been the second car.

When Stewart discovered that Coacci had worked for both shoe factories that had been robbed, he returned with the Bridgewater police. Mario Buda was not home, but on May 5, 1920, he arrived at the garage with three other men, later identified as Sacco, Vanzetti, and Riccardo Orciani. The four men knew each other well; Buda would later refer to Sacco and Vanzetti as &quot;the best friends I had in America&quot;.

Sacco and Vanzetti boarded a streetcar but were tracked down and soon arrested. When searched by police, both denied owning any guns, but were found to be holding loaded pistols. Sacco was found to have an Italian passport, anarchist literature, a loaded .32 Colt Model 1903 automatic pistol, and twenty-three .32 automatic cartridges in his possession; several of those bullet cases were of the same obsolescent type as the empty Winchester .32 casing found at the crime scene, and others were manufactured by the firms of Peters and Remington, much like other casings found at the scene. Vanzetti had four 12-gauge shotgun shells and a five-shot nickel-plated .38-caliber Harrington &amp; Richardson revolver similar to the .38 carried by Berardelli, the slain Braintree guard, whose weapon was not found at the scene of the crime. When they were questioned, the pair denied any connection to anarchists.

Orciani was arrested May 6, but gave the alibi that he had been at work on the day of both crimes. Sacco had been at work on the day of the Bridgewater crimes but said that he had the day off on April 15—the day of the Braintree crimes—and was charged with those murders. The self-employed Vanzetti had no such alibis and was charged for the attempted robbery and attempted murder in Bridgewater and the robbery and murder in the Braintree crimes. Sacco and Vanzetti were charged with the crime of murder on May 5, 1920, and indicted four months later on September 14.

Following Sacco and Vanzetti&#x27;s indictment for murder for the Braintree robbery, Galleanists and anarchists in the United States and abroad began a campaign of violent retaliation. Two days later on September 16, 1920, Mario Buda allegedly orchestrated the Wall Street bombing, where a time-delay dynamite bomb packed with heavy iron sash-weights in a horse-drawn cart exploded, killing 38 people and wounding 134. In 1921, a booby trap bomb mailed to the American ambassador in Paris exploded, wounding his valet. For the next six years, bombs exploded at other American embassies all over the world.

==Trials==

===Bridgewater crimes trial===
Rather than accept court-appointed counsel, Vanzetti chose to be represented by John P. Vahey, a former foundry superintendent and future state court judge who had been practicing law since 1905, most notably with his brother James H. Vahey and his law partner Charles Hiller Innes. James Graham, who was recommended by supporters, also served as defense counsel. Frederick G. Katzmann, the Norfolk and Plymouth County District Attorney, prosecuted the case. The presiding judge was Webster Thayer, who was already assigned to the court before this case was scheduled. A few weeks earlier he had given a speech to new American citizens decrying Bolshevism and anarchism&#x27;s threat to American institutions. He supported the suppression of functionally violent radical speech, and incitement to commit violent acts. He was known to dislike foreigners but was considered to be a fair judge.

The trial began on June 22, 1920. The prosecution presented several witnesses who put Vanzetti at the scene of the crime. Their descriptions varied, especially with respect to the shape and length of Vanzetti&#x27;s mustache. Physical evidence included a shotgun shell retrieved at the scene of the crime and several shells found on Vanzetti when he was arrested.

The defense produced 16 witnesses, all Italians from Plymouth, who testified that at the time of the attempted robbery they had bought eels from Vanzetti for Eastertide, in accordance with their traditions. Such details reinforced the difference between the Italians and the jurors. Some testified in imperfect English, others through an interpreter, whose inability to speak the same dialect of Italian as the witnesses hampered his effectiveness. On cross examination, the prosecution found it easy to make the witnesses appear confused about dates. A boy who testified admitted to rehearsing his testimony. &quot;You learned it just like a piece at school?&quot; the prosecutor asked. &quot;Sure&quot;, he replied. The defense tried to rebut the eyewitnesses with testimony that Vanzetti always wore his mustache in a distinctive long style, but the prosecution rebutted this.

The defense case went badly and Vanzetti did not testify in his own defense. During the trial, he said that his lawyers had opposed putting him on the stand. That same year, defense attorney Vahey told the governor that Vanzetti had refused his advice to testify. Decades later, a lawyer who assisted Vahey in the defense said that the defense attorneys left the choice to Vanzetti, but warned him that it would be difficult to prevent the prosecution from using cross examination to challenge the credibility of his character based on his political beliefs. He said that Vanzetti chose not to testify after consulting with Sacco. Herbert B. Ehrmann, who later joined the defense team, wrote many years later that the dangers of putting Vanzetti on the stand were very real. Another legal analysis of the case faulted the defense for not offering more to the jury by letting Vanzetti testify, concluding that by his remaining silent it &quot;left the jury to decide between the eyewitnesses and the alibi witness without his aid. In these circumstances a verdict of not guilty would have been very unusual&quot;. That analysis claimed that &quot;no one could say that the case was closely tried or vigorously fought for the defendant&quot;.

Vanzetti complained during his sentencing on April 9, 1927, for the Braintree crimes, that Vahey &quot;sold me for thirty golden money like Judas sold Jesus Christ.&quot; He accused Vahey of having conspired with the prosecutor &quot;to agitate still more the passion of the juror, the prejudice of the juror&quot; towards &quot;people of our principles, against the foreigner, against slackers.&quot;

On July 1, 1920, the jury deliberated for five hours and returned guilty verdicts on both counts, armed robbery and first-degree murder. Before sentencing, Judge Thayer learned that during deliberations, the jury had tampered with the shotgun shells found on Vanzetti at the time of his arrest to determine if the shot they contained was of sufficient size to kill a man. Since that prejudiced the jury&#x27;s verdict on the murder charge, Thayer declared that part a mistrial. On August 16, 1920, he sentenced Vanzetti on the charge of armed robbery to a term of 12 to 15 years in prison, the maximum sentence allowed.

Sacco and Vanzetti both denounced Thayer. Vanzetti wrote, &quot;I will try to see Thayer death before his pronunciation of our sentence&quot; and asked fellow anarchists for &quot;revenge, revenge in our names and the names of our living and dead.&quot;

In 1927, advocates for Sacco and Vanzetti charged that this case was brought first because a conviction for the Bridgewater crimes would help convict him for the Braintree crimes, where evidence against him was weak. The prosecution countered that the timing was driven by the schedules of different courts that handled the cases. The defense raised only minor objections in an appeal that was not accepted. A few years later, Vahey joined Katzmann&#x27;s law firm.

===Braintree crimes trial===

Sacco and Vanzetti went on trial for their lives on May 31, 1921, at Dedham, Norfolk County, Massachusetts, for the Braintree robbery and murders. Webster Thayer again presided; he had asked to be assigned to the trial. Katzmann again prosecuted for the State. Vanzetti was represented by brothers Jeremiah and Thomas McAnraney. Sacco was represented by Fred H. Moore and William J. Callahan. The choice of Moore, a former attorney for the Industrial Workers of the World, proved a key mistake for the defense. A notorious radical from California, Moore quickly enraged Judge Thayer with his courtroom demeanor, often doffing his jacket and once, his shoes. Reporters covering the case were amazed to hear Judge Thayer, during a lunch recess, proclaim, &quot;I&#x27;ll show them that no long-haired anarchist from California can run this court!&quot; and later, &quot;You wait till I give my charge to the jury. I&#x27;ll show them.&quot;

Authorities anticipated a possible bomb attack and had the Dedham courtroom outfitted with heavy, sliding steel doors and cast-iron shutters that were painted to appear wooden. Each day during the trial, the courthouse was placed under heavy police security, and Sacco and Vanzetti were escorted to and from the courtroom by armed guards.

The Commonwealth relied on evidence that Sacco was absent from his work in a shoe factory on the day of the murders; that the defendants were in the neighborhood of the Braintree robbery-murder scene on the morning when it occurred, being identified as having been there seen separately and also together; that the Buick getaway car was also in the neighborhood and that Vanzetti was near and in it; that Sacco was seen near the scene of the murders before they occurred and also was seen to shoot Berardelli after Berardelli fell and that that shot caused his death; that used shell casings were left at the scene of the murders, some of which could have been found to have been discharged from a .32 pistol afterwards found on Sacco; that a cap was found at the scene of the murders, which witnesses identified as resembling one formerly worn by Sacco; and that both men were members of anarchist cells that espoused violence, including assassination. Among the more important witnesses called by the prosecution was salesman Carlos E. Goodridge, who stated that as the getaway car raced within twenty-five feet of him, one of the car&#x27;s occupants, whom he identified as being Sacco, pointed a gun in his direction.

Much of the trial focused on material evidence, notably bullets, guns, and the cap. Prosecution witnesses testified that &quot;Bullet III&quot;, the .32-caliber bullet that had fatally wounded Berardelli, was from a discontinued Winchester .32 Auto cartridge loading so obsolete that the only bullets similar to it that anyone could locate to make comparisons were those found in the cartridges in Sacco&#x27;s pockets.

In court, District Attorney Katzmann called two forensic gun expert witnesses, Capt. Charles Van Amburgh of Springfield Armory and Capt. William Proctor of the Massachusetts State Police, who testified that they believed that of the four bullets recovered from Berardelli&#x27;s body, &quot;Bullet III&quot;—the fatal bullet—exhibited rifling marks consistent with those found on bullets fired from Sacco&#x27;s .32 Colt Automatic pistol. In rebuttal, two defense forensic gun experts testified that &quot;Bullet III&quot; did not match any of the test bullets from Sacco&#x27;s Colt. After the trial, Capt. Proctor signed an affidavit stating that he could not positively identify Sacco&#x27;s .32 Colt as the only pistol that could have fired &quot;Bullet III&quot;. This meant that &quot;Bullet III&quot; could have been fired from any of the 300,000 .32 Colt Automatic pistols then in circulation. All witnesses to the shooting testified that they saw one gunman shoot Berardelli four times, yet the defense never questioned how only one of four bullets found in the deceased guard was identified as being fired from Sacco&#x27;s Colt.

Vanzetti was being tried under Massachusetts&#x27; felony-murder rule, and the prosecution sought to implicate him in the Braintree robbery by the testimony of several witnesses: one testified that he was in the getaway car, and others who stated they saw Vanzetti in the vicinity of the Braintree factory around the time of the robbery. No direct evidence tied Vanzetti&#x27;s .38 nickel-plated Harrington &amp; Richardson five-shot revolver to the crime scene, except for the fact that it was identical in type and appearance to one owned by the slain guard Berardelli, which was missing from the crime scene. All six bullets recovered from the victims were .32 caliber, fired from at least two different automatic pistols.

The prosecution claimed Vanzetti&#x27;s .38 revolver had originally belonged to the slain Berardelli, and that it had been taken from his body during the robbery. No one testified to seeing anyone take the gun, but Berardelli had an empty holster and no gun on him when he was found. Additionally, witnesses to the payroll shooting had described Berardelli as reaching for his gun on his hip when he was cut down by pistol fire from the robbers.

District Attorney Katzmann pointed out that Vanzetti had lied at the time of his arrest, when making statements about the .38 revolver found in his possession. He claimed that the revolver was his own, and that he carried it for self-protection, yet he incorrectly described it to police as a six-shot revolver instead of a five-shot. Vanzetti also told police that he had purchased only one box of cartridges for the gun, all of the same make, yet his revolver was loaded with five .38 cartridges of varying brands. At the time of his arrest, Vanzetti also claimed that he had bought the gun at a store (but could not remember which one), and that it cost $18 or $19 (three times its actual market value). He lied about where he had obtained the .38 cartridges found in the revolver.

The prosecution traced the history of Berardelli&#x27;s .38 Harrington &amp; Richardson (H&amp;R) revolver. Berardelli&#x27;s wife testified that she and her husband dropped off the gun for repair at the Iver Johnson Co. of Boston a few weeks before the murder. According to the foreman of the Iver Johnson repair shop, Berardelli&#x27;s revolver was given a repair tag with the number of 94765, and this number was recorded in the repair logbook with the statement &quot;H. &amp; R. revolver, .38-calibre, new hammer, repairing, half an hour&quot;. However, the shop books did not record the gun&#x27;s serial number, and the caliber was apparently incorrectly labeled as .32 instead of .38-caliber. The shop foreman testified that a new spring and hammer were put into Berardelli&#x27;s Harrington &amp; Richardson revolver. The gun was claimed and the half-hour repair paid for, though the date and identity of the claimant were not recorded. After examining Vanzetti&#x27;s .38 revolver, the foreman testified that Vanzetti&#x27;s gun had a new replacement hammer in keeping with the repair performed on Berardelli&#x27;s revolver. The foreman explained that the shop was always kept busy repairing 20 to 30 revolvers per day, which made it very hard to remember individual guns or keep reliable records of when they were picked up by their owners. But, he said that unclaimed guns were sold by Iver Johnson at the end of each year, and the shop had no record of an unclaimed gun sale of Berardelli&#x27;s revolver. To reinforce the conclusion that Berardelli had reclaimed his revolver from the repair shop, the prosecution called a witness who testified that he had seen Berardelli in possession of a .38 nickel-plated revolver the Saturday night before the Braintree robbery.

After hearing testimony from the repair shop employee that &quot;the repair shop had no record of Berardelli picking up the gun, the gun was not in the shop nor had it been sold&quot;, the defense put Vanzetti on the stand where he testified that &quot;he had actually bought the gun several months earlier from fellow anarchist Luigi Falzini for five dollars&quot;—in contradiction to what he had told police upon his arrest. This was corroborated by Luigi Falzini (Falsini), a friend of Vanzetti&#x27;s and a fellow Galleanist, who stated that, after buying the .38 revolver from one Riccardo Orciani, he sold it to Vanzetti. The defense also called two expert witnesses, a Mr. Burns and a Mr. Fitzgerald, who each testified that no new spring and hammer had ever been installed in the revolver found in Vanzetti&#x27;s possession.

The District Attorney&#x27;s final piece of material evidence was a flop-eared cap claimed to have been Sacco&#x27;s. Sacco tried the cap on in court and, according to two newspaper sketch artists who ran cartoons the next day, it was too small, sitting high on his head. But Katzmann insisted the cap fitted Sacco and, noting a hole in the back where Sacco had hung the cap on a nail each day, continued to refer to it as his, and in denying later appeals, Judge Thayer often cited the cap as material evidence. During the 1927 Lowell Commission investigation, however, Braintree&#x27;s Police Chief admitted that he had torn the cap open upon finding it at the crime scene a full day after the murders. Doubting the cap was Sacco&#x27;s, the chief told the commission it could not have lain in the street &quot;for thirty hours with the State Police, the local police, and two or three thousand people there.&quot;

Controversy clouded the prosecution witnesses who identified Sacco as having been at the scene of the crime. One, a bookkeeper named Mary Splaine, precisely described Sacco as the man she saw firing from the getaway car. From Felix Frankfurter&#x27;s account from &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; article:

Viewing the scene from a distance of from sixty to eighty feet, she saw a man previously unknown to her in a car traveling at the rate of from fifteen to eighteen miles per hour, and she saw him only for a distance of about thirty feet—that is to say, for from one and a half to three seconds.

Yet cross examination revealed that Splaine was unable to identify Sacco at the inquest but had recall of great details of Sacco&#x27;s appearance over a year later. While a few others singled out Sacco or Vanzetti as the men they had seen at the scene of the crime, far more witnesses, both prosecution and defense, could not identify them.

The defendants&#x27; radical politics may have played a role in the verdict. Judge Thayer, though a sworn enemy of anarchists, warned the defense against bringing anarchism into the trial. Yet defense attorney Fred Moore felt he had to call both Sacco and Vanzetti as witnesses to let them explain why they were fully armed when arrested. Both men testified that they had been rounding up radical literature when apprehended, and that they had feared another government deportation raid. Yet both hurt their case with rambling discourses on radical politics that the prosecution mocked. The prosecution also brought out that both men had fled the draft by going to Mexico in 1917.

The jury ultimately reached a guilty verdict. The verdicts and the likelihood of death sentences immediately roused international opinion. Demonstrations were held in 60 Italian cities and a flood of mail was sent to the American embassy in Paris. Demonstrations followed in a number of Latin American cities. Anatole France, veteran of the campaign for Alfred Dreyfus and recipient of the 1921 Nobel Prize for Literature, wrote an &quot;Appeal to the American People&quot;: &quot;The death of Sacco and Vanzetti will make martyrs of them and cover you with shame. You are a great people. You ought to be a just people.&quot;

====Jury====
The 12 jurors were sequestered at the courthouse for the entirety of the six-week trial. They slept on cots in the courthouse&#x27;s grand jury room and bathed in the basement of the jail. To celebrate the 4th of July, they were brought to Scituate, Massachusetts and given a lobster dinner.

To get a full jury, courthouse officials had to go to extraordinary lengths. Over 600 men were interviewed, with the most common reason for dismissal being their opposition to the death penalty. One man, a sugar dealer, tried to pretend that he was deaf in an attempt to get out of serving on the jury. When he was discovered, by answering a question posed by the judge, Sacco and Vanzetti were sent into fits of laughter.

After 500 potential jurors were interviewed, but only seven selected, deputies from the Norfolk County Sheriff&#x27;s office went out to workplaces, club meetings, concerts, and elsewhere to bring in additional potential jurors. One man, ultimately selected, was brought from his wedding dinner. The Quincy man had to postpone his honeymoon until after the trial.

==Defense committee==

In 1921, most of the nation had not yet heard of Sacco and Vanzetti. Brief mention of the conviction appeared on page three of the &quot;New York Times&quot;. Defense attorney Moore radicalized and politicized the process by discussing Sacco and Vanzetti&#x27;s anarchist beliefs, attempting to suggest that they were prosecuted primarily for their political beliefs and the trial was part of a government plan to stop the anarchist movement in the United States. His efforts helped stir up support but were so costly that he was eventually dismissed from the defense team.

The Sacco-Vanzetti Defense Committee was formed on May 9, 1920, immediately following the arrests, by a group of fellow anarchists, headed by Vanzetti&#x27;s 23-year-old friend Aldino Felicani. Over the next seven years, it raised $300,000. Defense attorney Fred Moore drew on its funds for his investigations. Differences arose when Moore tried to determine who had committed the Braintree crimes over objections from anarchists that he was doing the government&#x27;s work. After the Committee hired William G. Thompson to manage the legal defense, he objected to its propaganda efforts.

A Defense Committee publicist wrote an article about the first trial that was published in &quot;The New Republic&quot;. In the winter of 1920–1921, the Defense Committee sent stories to labor union publications every week. It produced pamphlets with titles like &quot;Fangs at Labor&#x27;s Throat&quot;, sometimes printing thousands of copies. It sent speakers to Italian communities in factory towns and mining camps. The Committee eventually added staff from outside the anarchist movement, notably Mary Donovan, who had experience as a labor leader and Sinn Féin organizer. In 1927, she and Felicani together recruited Gardner Jackson, a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reporter from a wealthy family, to manage publicity and serve as a mediator between the Committee&#x27;s anarchists and the growing number of supporters with more liberal political views, who included socialites, lawyers, and intellectuals.

Jackson bridged the gap between the radicals and the social elite so well that Sacco thanked him a few weeks before his execution:
We are one heart, but unfortunately we represent two different class. ... But, whenever the heart of one of the upper class join with the exploited workers for the struggle of the right in the human feeling is the feel of an spontaneous attraction and brotherly love to one another.

The noted American author John Dos Passos joined the committee and wrote its 127-page official review of the case: &quot;Facing the Chair: Story of Americanization of Two Foreignborn Workmen&quot;. Dos Passos concluded it &quot;barely possible&quot; that Sacco might have committed murder as part of a class war, but that the soft-hearted Vanzetti was clearly innocent. &quot;Nobody in his right mind who was planning such a crime would take a man like that along&quot;, Dos Passos wrote of Vanzetti. After the executions, the Committee continued its work, helping to gather material that eventually appeared as &quot;The Letters of Sacco and Vanzetti&quot;.

==Motions for a new trial==
Multiple separate motions for a new trial were denied by Judge Thayer. One motion, the so-called Hamilton-Proctor motion, involved the forensic ballistic evidence presented by the expert witnesses for the prosecution and defense. The prosecution&#x27;s firearms expert, Charles Van Amburgh, had re-examined the evidence in preparation for the motion. By 1923, bullet-comparison technology had improved somewhat, and Van Amburgh submitted photos of the bullets fired from Sacco&#x27;s .32 Colt in support of the argument that they matched the bullet that killed Berardelli. In response, the controversial self-proclaimed &quot;firearms expert&quot; for the defense, Albert H. Hamilton, conducted an in-court demonstration involving two brand new Colt .32-caliber automatic pistols belonging to Hamilton, along with Sacco&#x27;s .32 Colt of the same make and caliber. In front of Judge Thayer and the lawyers for both sides, Hamilton disassembled all three pistols and placed the major component parts—barrel, barrel bushing, recoil spring, frame, slide, and magazine—into three piles on the table before him. He explained the functions of each part and began to demonstrate how each was interchangeable, in the process intermingling the parts of all three pistols. Judge Thayer stopped Hamilton and demanded that he reassemble Sacco&#x27;s pistol with its proper parts.

Other motions focused on the jury foreman and a prosecution ballistics expert. In 1923, the defense filed an affidavit from a friend of the jury foreman, who swore that prior to the trial, the jury foreman had allegedly said of Sacco and Vanzetti, &quot;Damn them, they ought to hang them anyway!&quot; That same year, the defense read to the court an affidavit by Captain William Proctor (who had died shortly after conclusion of the trial) in which Proctor stated that he could not say that &quot;Bullet III&quot; was fired by Sacco&#x27;s .32 Colt pistol. At the conclusion of the appeal hearings, Thayer denied all motions for a new trial on October 1, 1924.

Several months later, in February 1924, Judge Thayer asked one of the firearms experts for the prosecution, Capt. Charles Van Amburgh, to reinspect Sacco&#x27;s Colt and determine its condition. With District Attorney Katzmann present, Van Amburgh took the gun from the clerk and started to take it apart. Van Amburgh quickly noticed that the barrel to Sacco&#x27;s gun was brand new, being still covered in the manufacturer&#x27;s protective rust preventative. Judge Thayer began private hearings to determine who had tampered with the evidence by switching the barrel on Sacco&#x27;s gun. During three weeks of hearings, Albert Hamilton and Captain Van Amburgh squared off, challenging each other&#x27;s authority. Testimony suggested that Sacco&#x27;s gun had been treated with little care, and frequently disassembled for inspection. New defense attorney William Thompson insisted that no one on his side could have switched the barrels &quot;unless they wanted to run their necks into a noose.&quot; Albert Hamilton swore he had only taken the gun apart while being watched by Judge Thayer. Judge Thayer made no finding as to who had switched the .32 Colt barrels, but ordered the rusty barrel returned to Sacco&#x27;s Colt. After the hearing concluded, unannounced to Judge Thayer, Captain Van Amburgh took both Sacco&#x27;s and Vanzetti&#x27;s guns, along with the bullets and shells involved in the crime to his home where he kept them until a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; exposé revealed the misappropriation in 1960. Meanwhile, Van Amburgh bolstered his own credentials by writing an article on the case for &quot;True Detective Mysteries&quot;. The 1935 article charged that prior to the discovery of the gun barrel switch, Albert Hamilton had tried to walk out of the courtroom with Sacco&#x27;s gun but was stopped by Judge Thayer. Although several historians of the case, including Francis Russell, have reported this story as factual, nowhere in transcripts of the private hearing on the gun barrel switch was this incident ever mentioned. The same year the &quot;True Detective&quot; article was published, a study of ballistics in the case concluded, &quot;what might have been almost indubitable evidence was in fact rendered more than useless by the bungling of the experts.&quot;

==Appeal to the Supreme Judicial Court==
The defense appealed Thayer&#x27;s denial of their motions to the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), the highest level of the state&#x27;s judicial system. Both sides presented arguments to its five judges on January 11–13, 1926. The SJC returned a unanimous ruling on May 12, 1926, upholding Judge Thayer&#x27;s decisions. The Court did not have the authority to review the trial record as a whole or to judge the fairness of the case. Instead, the judges considered only whether Thayer had abused his discretion in the course of the trial. Thayer later claimed that the SJC had &quot;approved&quot; the verdicts, which advocates for the defendants protested as a misinterpretation of the Court&#x27;s ruling, which only found &quot;no error&quot; in his individual rulings.

==Medeiros confession==
In November 1925, Celestino Medeiros, an ex-convict awaiting trial for murder, confessed to committing the Braintree crimes. He absolved Sacco and Vanzetti of participation in them. In May, once the SJC had denied their appeal and Medeiros was convicted, the defense investigated the details of Medeiros&#x27; story. Police interviews led them to the Morelli gang based in Providence, Rhode Island. They developed an alternative theory of the crime based on the gang&#x27;s history of shoe-factory robberies, connections to a car like that used in Braintree, and other details. Gang leader Joe Morelli bore a striking resemblance to Sacco.

The defense filed a motion for a new trial based on the Medeiros confession on May 26, 1926. In support of their motion they included 64 affidavits. The prosecution countered with 26 affidavits. When Thayer heard arguments from September 13 to 17, 1926, the defense, along with their Medeiros-Morelli theory of the crime, charged that the U.S. Justice Department was aiding the prosecution by withholding information obtained in its own investigation of the case. Attorney William Thompson made an explicitly political attack: &quot;A government which has come to value its own secrets more than it does the lives of its citizens has become a tyranny, whether you call it a republic, a monarchy, or anything else!&quot; Judge Thayer denied this motion for a new trial on October 23, 1926. After arguing against the credibility of Medeiros, he addressed the defense claims against the federal government, saying the defense was suffering from &quot;a new type of disease, ... a belief in the existence of something which in fact and truth has no such existence.&quot;

Three days later, the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; responded to Thayer&#x27;s decision by reversing its longstanding position and calling for a new trial. Its editorial, &quot;&quot;, earned its author a Pulitzer Prize. No other newspapers followed suit.

==Second appeal to the Supreme Judicial Court==
The defense promptly appealed again to the Supreme Judicial Court and presented their arguments on January 27 and 28, 1927. While the appeal was under consideration, Harvard law professor and future Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter published an article in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; arguing for a retrial. He noted that the SJC had already taken a very narrow view of its authority when considering the first appeal and called upon the court to review the entire record of the case. He called their attention to Thayer&#x27;s lengthy statement that accompanied his denial of the Medeiros appeal, describing it as &quot;a farrago of misquotations, misrepresentations, suppressions, and mutilations&quot; that were &quot;honeycombed with demonstrable errors.&quot;

At the same time, Major Calvin Goddard was a ballistics expert who had helped pioneer the use of the comparison microscope in forensic ballistic research. He offered to conduct an independent examination of the gun and bullet forensic evidence by using techniques that he had developed for use with the comparison microscope. Goddard first offered to conduct a new forensic examination for the defense, which rejected it, and then to the prosecution, which accepted his offer. Using the comparison microscope, Goddard compared &quot;Bullet III&quot; and a .32 Auto shell casing found at the Braintree shooting with that of several .32 Auto test cartridges fired from Sacco&#x27;s .32 Colt automatic pistol. Goddard concluded that not only did &quot;Bullet III&quot; match the rifling marks found on the barrel of Sacco&#x27;s .32 Colt pistol, but that scratches made by the firing pin of Sacco&#x27;s .32 Colt on the primers of spent shell casings test-fired from Sacco&#x27;s Colt matched those found on the primer of a spent shell casing recovered at the Braintree murder scene. More sophisticated comparative examinations in 1935, 1961, and 1983 each reconfirmed the opinion that the bullet the prosecution said killed Berardelli and one of the cartridge cases introduced into evidence were fired in Sacco&#x27;s .32 Colt automatic. However, in his book on new evidence in the Sacco and Vanzetti case, historian David E. Kaiser wrote that Bullet III and its shell casing, as presented, had been substituted by the prosecution and were not genuinely from the scene.

The Supreme Judicial Court denied the Medeiros appeal on April 5, 1927. Summarizing the decision, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the SJC had determined that &quot;the judge had a right to rule as he did&quot; but that the SJC &quot;did not deny the validity of the new evidence&quot;. The SJC also said: &quot;It is not imperative that a new trial be granted even though evidence is newly discovered and, if presented to a jury, would justify a different verdict.&quot;

==Protests and advocacy==

In 1924, referring to his denial of motions for a new trial, Judge Thayer confronted a Massachusetts lawyer: &quot;Did you see what I did with those anarchistic bastards the other day?&quot; the judge said. &quot;I guess that will hold them for a while! Let them go and see now what they can get out of the Supreme Court!&quot; The outburst remained a secret until 1927 when its release fueled the arguments of Sacco and Vanzetti&#x27;s defenders. The &quot;New York World&quot; attacked Thayer as &quot;an agitated little man looking for publicity and utterly impervious to the ethical standards one has the right to expect of a man presiding in a capital case.&quot;

Many socialists and intellectuals campaigned for a retrial without success. John Dos Passos came to Boston to cover the case as a journalist, stayed to author a pamphlet called &quot;Facing the Chair&quot;, and was arrested in a demonstration on August 10, 1927, along with writer Dorothy Parker, trade union organizer and Socialist Party leader Powers Hapgood and activist Catharine Sargent Huntington. After being arrested while picketing the State House, the poet Edna St. Vincent Millay pleaded her case to the governor in person and then wrote an appeal: &quot;I cry to you with a million voices: answer our doubt ... There is need in Massachusetts of a great man tonight.&quot;

Others who wrote to Fuller or signed petitions included Albert Einstein, George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells. The president of the American Federation of Labor cited &quot;the long period of time intervening between the commission of the crime and the final decision of the Court&quot; as well as &quot;the mental and physical anguish which Sacco and Vanzetti must have undergone during the past seven years&quot; in a telegram to the governor.

Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, the target of two anarchist assassination attempts, quietly made inquiries through diplomatic channels and was prepared to ask Governor Fuller to commute the sentences if it appeared his request would be granted.

In 1926, a bomb presumed to be the work of anarchists destroyed the house of Samuel Johnson, the brother of Simon Johnson and garage owner that called police the night of Sacco and Vanzetti&#x27;s arrest.

In August 1927, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) called for a three-day nationwide walkout to protest the pending executions. The most notable response came in the Walsenburg coal district of Colorado, where 1,132 out of 1,167 miners participated in the walkout. It led to the Colorado coal strike of 1927.

==Defendants in prison==

For their part, Sacco and Vanzetti seemed to alternate between moods of defiance, vengeance, resignation, and despair. The June 1926 issue of &quot;Protesta Umana,&quot; published by their Defense Committee, carried an article signed by Sacco and Vanzetti that appealed for retaliation by their colleagues. In the article, Vanzetti wrote, &quot;I will try to see Thayer death before his pronunciation of our sentence&quot;, and asked fellow anarchists for &quot;revenge, revenge in our names and the names of our living and dead.&quot; The article made a reference to &quot;La Salute è in voi!&quot;, the title of Galleani&#x27;s bomb-making manual.

Both wrote dozens of letters asserting their innocence, insisting they had been framed because they were anarchists. Their conduct in prison consistently impressed guards and wardens. In 1927, the Dedham jail chaplain wrote to the head of an investigatory commission that he had seen no evidence of guilt or remorse on Sacco&#x27;s part. Vanzetti impressed fellow prisoners at Charlestown State Prison as a bookish intellectual, incapable of committing any violent crime. Novelist John Dos Passos, who visited both men in jail, observed of Vanzetti, &quot;nobody in his right mind who was planning such a crime would take a man like that along.&quot; Vanzetti developed his command of English to such a degree that journalist Murray Kempton later described him as &quot;the greatest writer of English in our century to learn his craft, do his work, and die all in the space of seven years.&quot;

During the trial, Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who was then in Washington, invited Sacco&#x27;s wife to stay at his home near the courthouse. Sacco&#x27;s seven-year-old son, Dante, would sometimes stand on the sidewalk outside the jail and play catch with his father by throwing a ball over the wall.

==Sentencing==
On April 9, 1927, Judge Thayer heard final statements from Sacco and Vanzetti. In a lengthy speech Vanzetti said:

I would not wish to a dog or to a snake, to the most low and misfortunate creature of the earth, I would not wish to any of them what I have had to suffer for things that I am not guilty of. But my conviction is that I have suffered for things that I am guilty of. I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian ... if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do what I have done already.

Thayer declared that the responsibility for the conviction rested solely with the jury&#x27;s determination of guilt. &quot;The Court has absolutely nothing to do with that question.&quot; He sentenced each of them to &quot;suffer the punishment of death by the passage of a current of electricity through your body&quot; during the week beginning July 10. He twice postponed the execution date while the governor considered requests for clemency.

On May 10, a package bomb addressed to Governor Fuller was intercepted in the Boston post office.

==Clemency appeal and the Governor&#x27;s Advisory Committee==
In response to public protests that greeted the sentencing, Massachusetts Governor Alvan T. Fuller faced last-minute appeals to grant clemency to Sacco and Vanzetti. On June 1, 1927, he appointed an Advisory Committee of three: President Abbott Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, President Samuel Wesley Stratton of MIT, and Probate Judge Robert Grant. They were presented with the task of reviewing the trial to determine whether it had been fair. Lowell&#x27;s appointment was generally well received, for though he had controversy in his past, he had also at times demonstrated an independent streak. The defense attorneys considered resigning when they determined that the Committee was biased against the defendants, but some of the defendants&#x27; most prominent supporters, including Harvard Law Professor Felix Frankfurter and Judge Julian W. Mack of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, persuaded them to stay because Lowell &quot;was not entirely hopeless&quot;.

One of the defense attorneys, though ultimately very critical of the Committee&#x27;s work, thought the Committee members were not really capable of the task the Governor set for them:
No member of the Committee had the essential sophistication that comes with experience in the trial of criminal cases. ... The high positions in the community held by the members of the Committee obscured the fact that they were not really qualified to perform the difficult task assigned to them. He also thought that the Committee, particularly Lowell, imagined it could use its fresh and more powerful analytical abilities to outperform the efforts of those who had worked on the case for years, even finding evidence of guilt that professional prosecutors had discarded.

Grant was another establishment figure, a probate court judge from 1893 to 1923 and an Overseer of Harvard University from 1896 to 1921, and the author of a dozen popular novels. Some criticized Grant&#x27;s appointment to the Committee, with one defense lawyer saying he &quot;had a black-tie class concept of life around him&quot;, but Harold Laski in a conversation at the time found him &quot;moderate&quot;. Others cited evidence of xenophobia in some of his novels, references to &quot;riff-raff&quot; and a variety of racial slurs. His biographer allows that he was &quot;not a good choice&quot;, not a legal scholar, and handicapped by age. Stratton, the one member who was not a &quot;Boston Brahmin&quot;, maintained the lowest public profile of the three and hardly spoke during its hearings.

In their earlier appeals, the defense was limited to the trial record. The Governor&#x27;s Committee, however, was not a judicial proceeding, so Judge Thayer&#x27;s comments outside the courtroom could be used to demonstrate his bias. Once Thayer told reporters that &quot;No long-haired anarchist from California can run this court!&quot; According to the affidavits of eyewitnesses, Thayer also lectured members of his clubs, calling Sacco and Vanzetti &quot;Bolsheviki!&quot; and saying he would &quot;get them good and proper&quot;. During the Dedham trial&#x27;s first week, Thayer said to reporters: &quot;Did you ever see a case in which so many leaflets and circulars have been spread ... saying people couldn&#x27;t get a fair trial in Massachusetts? You wait till I give my charge to the jury, I&#x27;ll show them!&quot; In 1924, Thayer confronted a Massachusetts lawyer at Dartmouth, his &quot;alma mater&quot;, and said: &quot;Did you see what I did with those anarchistic bastards the other day. I guess that will hold them for a while. ... Let them go to the Supreme Court now and see what they can get out of them.&quot; The Committee knew that, following the verdict, &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reporter Frank Sibley, who had covered the trial, wrote a protest to the Massachusetts attorney general condemning Thayer&#x27;s blatant bias. Thayer&#x27;s behavior both inside the courtroom and outside of it had become a public issue, with the &quot;New York World&quot; attacking Thayer as &quot;an agitated little man looking for publicity and utterly impervious to the ethical standards one has the right to expect of a man presiding in a capital case.&quot;

On July 12–13, 1927, following testimony by the defense firearms expert Albert H. Hamilton before the Committee, the Assistant District Attorney for Massachusetts, Dudley P. Ranney, took the opportunity to cross-examine Hamilton. He submitted affidavits questioning Hamilton&#x27;s credentials as well as his performance during the New York trial of Charles Stielow, in which Hamilton&#x27;s testimony linking rifling marks to a bullet used to kill the victim nearly sent an innocent man to the electric chair. The Committee also heard from Braintree&#x27;s police chief who told them he had found the cap on Pearl Street, allegedly dropped by Sacco during the crime, a full 24-hours after the getaway car had fled the scene. The chief doubted the cap belonged to Sacco and called the whole trial a contest &quot;to see who could tell the biggest lies.&quot;

After two weeks of hearing witnesses and reviewing evidence, the Committee determined that the trial had been fair and a new trial was not warranted. They assessed the charges against Thayer as well. Their criticism, using words provided by Judge Grant, was direct: &quot;He ought not to have talked about the case off the bench, and doing so was a grave breach of judicial decorum.&quot; But they also found some of the charges about his statements unbelievable or exaggerated, and they determined that anything he might have said had no impact on the trial. The panel&#x27;s reading of the trial transcript convinced them that Thayer &quot;tried to be scrupulously fair&quot;. The Committee also reported that the trial jurors were almost unanimous in praising Thayer&#x27;s conduct of the trial.

A defense attorney later noted ruefully that the release of the Committee&#x27;s report &quot;abruptly stilled the burgeoning doubts among the leaders of opinion in New England.&quot; Supporters of the convicted men denounced the Committee. Harold Laski told Holmes that the Committee&#x27;s work showed that Lowell&#x27;s &quot;loyalty to his class ... transcended his ideas of logic and justice.&quot;

Defense attorneys William G. Thompson and Herbert B. Ehrmann stepped down from the case in August 1927 and were replaced by Arthur D. Hill.

==Execution and funeral==
The executions were scheduled for midnight between August 22 and 23, 1927. On August 15, a bomb exploded at the home of one of the Dedham jurors. On Sunday, August 21, more than 20,000 protesters assembled on Boston Common.

Sacco and Vanzetti awaited execution in their cells at Charlestown State Prison, and both men refused a priest several times on their last day, as they were atheists. Their attorney William Thompson asked Vanzetti to make a statement opposing violent retaliation for his death and they discussed forgiving one&#x27;s enemies. Thompson also asked Vanzetti to swear to his and Sacco&#x27;s innocence one last time, and Vanzetti did. Celestino Medeiros, whose execution had been delayed in case his testimony was required at another trial of Sacco and Vanzetti, was executed first. Sacco was next and walked quietly to the electric chair, then shouted &quot;Farewell, mother.&quot; Vanzetti, in his final moments, shook hands with guards and thanked them for their kind treatment, read a statement proclaiming his innocence, and finally said, &quot;I wish to forgive some people for what they are now doing to me.&quot; Following the executions, death masks were made of the men.

Violent demonstrations swept through many cities the next day, including Geneva, London, Paris, Amsterdam, and Tokyo. In South America wildcat strikes closed factories. Three died in Germany, and protesters in Johannesburg burned an American flag outside the American embassy. It has been alleged that some of these activities were organized by the Communist Party.

At Langone Funeral Home in Boston&#x27;s North End, more than 10,000 mourners viewed Sacco and Vanzetti in open caskets over two days. At the funeral parlor, a wreath over the caskets announced &quot;In attesa l&#x27;ora della vendetta&quot; (Awaiting the hour of vengeance). On Sunday, August 28, a two-hour funeral procession bearing huge floral tributes moved through the city. Thousands of marchers took part in the procession, and over 200,000 came out to watch. Police blocked the route, which passed the State House, and at one point mourners and the police clashed. The hearses reached Forest Hills Cemetery where, after a brief eulogy, the bodies were cremated. The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; called it &quot;one of the most tremendous funerals of modern times&quot;.
Will H. Hays, head of the motion picture industry&#x27;s umbrella organization, ordered all film of the funeral procession destroyed.

After their cremation, Sacco and Vanzetti&#x27;s ashes were taken onto the SS Conte Grande and repatriated to Italy. Sacco&#x27;s ashes were sent to Torremaggiore, the town of his birth, where they are interred at the base of a monument erected in 1998. Vanzetti&#x27;s ashes were buried with his mother in Villafalletto.

==Continuing protests and analyses==

Italian anarchist Severino Di Giovanni, one of the most vocal supporters of Sacco and Vanzetti in Argentina, bombed the American embassy in Buenos Aires a few hours after the two men were sentenced to death. A few days after the executions, Sacco&#x27;s widow thanked Di Giovanni by letter for his support and added that the director of the tobacco firm &quot;Combinados&quot; had offered to produce a cigarette brand named &quot;Sacco &amp; Vanzetti&quot;. On November 26, 1927, Di Giovanni and others bombed a Combinados tobacco shop. On December 24, 1927, Di Giovanni blew up the headquarters of The National City Bank of New York and of the Bank of Boston in Buenos Aires in apparent protest of the execution. In December 1928, Di Giovanni and others failed in an attempt to bomb the train in which President-elect Herbert Hoover was traveling during his visit to Argentina.

Three months later, bombs exploded in the New York City Subway, in a Philadelphia church, and at the home of the mayor of Baltimore. The house of one of the jurors in the Dedham trial was bombed, throwing him and his family from their beds. On May 18, 1928, a bomb destroyed the front porch of the home of executioner Robert Elliott. As late as 1932, Judge Thayer&#x27;s home was wrecked and his wife and housekeeper were injured in a bomb blast. Afterward, Thayer lived permanently at his club in Boston, guarded 24 hours a day until his death on April 18, 1933.

In October 1927, H. G. Wells wrote an essay that discussed the case at length. He called it &quot;a case like the Dreyfus case, by which the soul of a people is tested and displayed.&quot; He felt that Americans failed to understand what about the case roused European opinion: However, many major cities in the United States held protests throughout the trial, proving otherwise.

The guilt or innocence of these two Italians is not the issue that has excited the opinion of the world. Possibly they were actual murderers, and still more possibly they knew more than they would admit about the crime. ... Europe is not &quot;retrying&quot; Sacco and Vanzetti or anything of the sort. It is saying what it thinks of Judge Thayer. Executing political opponents as political opponents after the fashion of Mussolini and Moscow we can understand, or bandits as bandits; but this business of trying and executing murderers as Reds, or Reds as murderers, seems to be a new and very frightening line for the courts of a State in the most powerful and civilized Union on earth to pursue.

In 1928, Upton Sinclair published his novel &quot;Boston&quot;, in which he inserted fictional characters into the trial and execution. He explored Vanzetti&#x27;s life and writings, as its focus, and mixed fictional characters with historical participants in the trials. Though his portrait of Vanzetti was entirely sympathetic, Sinclair disappointed advocates for the defense by failing to absolve Sacco and Vanzetti of the crimes, however much he argued that their trial had been unjust. Years later, he explained: &quot;Some of the things I told displeased the fanatical believers; but having portrayed the aristocrats as they were, I had to do the same thing for the anarchists.&quot; While doing research for the book, Sinclair was told confidentially by Sacco and Vanzetti&#x27;s former lawyer Fred H. Moore that the two were guilty and that he (Moore) had supplied them with fake alibis; Sinclair was inclined to believe that that was, indeed, the case, and later referred to this as an &quot;ethical problem&quot;, but he did not include the information about the conversation with Moore in his book.

When the letters Sacco and Vanzetti wrote appeared in print in 1928, journalist Walter Lippmann commented: &quot;If Sacco and Vanzetti were professional bandits, then historians and biographers who attempt to deduce character from personal documents might as well shut up shop. By every test that I know of for judging character, these are the letters of innocent men.&quot; On January 3, 1929, as Gov. Fuller left the inauguration of his successor, he found a copy of the &quot;Letters&quot; thrust at him by someone in the crowd. He knocked it to the ground &quot;with an exclamation of contempt.&quot;

Intellectual and literary supporters of Sacco and Vanzetti continued to speak out. In 1936, on the day when Harvard celebrated its 300th anniversary, 28 Harvard alumni issued a statement attacking the University&#x27;s retired President Lowell for his role on the Governor&#x27;s Advisory Committee in 1927. They included Heywood Broun, Malcolm Cowley, Granville Hicks, and John Dos Passos.

==Massachusetts judicial reform==
Following the SJC&#x27;s assertion that it could not order a new trial even if there was new evidence that &quot;would justify a different verdict&quot;, a movement for &quot;drastic reform&quot; quickly took shape in Boston&#x27;s legal community. In December 1927, four months after the executions, the Massachusetts Judicial Council cited the Sacco and Vanzetti case as evidence of &quot;serious defects in our methods of administering justice.&quot; It proposed a series of changes designed to appeal to both sides of the political divide, including restrictions on the number and timing of appeals. Its principal proposal addressed the SJC&#x27;s right to review. It argued that a judge would benefit from a full review of a trial, and that no one man should bear the burden in a capital case. A review could defend a judge whose decisions were challenged and make it less likely that a governor would be drawn into a case. It asked for the SJC to have right to order a new trial &quot;upon any ground if the interests of justice appear to inquire it.&quot; Governor Fuller endorsed the proposal in his January 1928 annual message.

The Judicial Council repeated its recommendations in 1937 and 1938. Finally, in 1939, the language it had proposed was adopted. Since that time, the SJC has been required to review all death penalty cases, to consider the entire case record, and to affirm or overturn the verdict on the law and on the evidence or &quot;for any other reason that justice may require&quot; (Mass. General Laws, 1939 ch. 341)

==Historical viewpoints==
Many historians, especially legal historians, have concluded the Sacco and Vanzetti prosecution, trial, and aftermath constituted a blatant disregard for political civil liberties, and especially criticize Thayer&#x27;s decision to deny a retrial.

John W. Johnson has said that the authorities and jurors were influenced by strong anti-Italian prejudice and the prejudice against immigrants widely held at the time, especially in New England. Against charges of racism and racial prejudice, Paul Avrich and Brenda and James Lutz point out that both men were known anarchist members of a militant organization, members of which had been conducting a violent campaign of bombing and attempted assassinations, acts condemned by most Americans of all backgrounds. Though in general anarchist groups did not finance their militant activities through bank robberies, a fact noted by the investigators of the Bureau of Investigation, this was not true of the Galleanist group. Mario Buda readily told an interviewer: &quot;Andavamo a prenderli dove c&#x27;erano&quot; (&quot;We used to go and get it [money] where it was&quot;)—meaning factories and banks. The guard Berardelli was also Italian.

Johnson and Avrich suggest that the government prosecuted Sacco and Vanzetti for the robbery-murders as a convenient means to put a stop to their militant activities as Galleanists, whose bombing campaign at the time posed a lethal threat, both to the government and to many Americans. Faced with a secretive underground group whose members resisted interrogation and believed in their cause, Federal and local officials using conventional law enforcement tactics had been repeatedly stymied in their efforts to identify all members of the group or to collect enough evidence for a prosecution.

Most historians believe that Sacco and Vanzetti were involved at some level in the Galleanist bombing campaign, although their precise roles have not been determined. In 1955, Charles Poggi, a longtime anarchist and American citizen, traveled to Savignano in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy to visit old comrades, including the Galleanists&#x27; principal bombmaker, Mario &quot;Mike&quot; Buda. While discussing the Braintree robbery, Buda told Poggi, &quot;Sacco c&#x27;era&quot; (Sacco was there). Poggi added that he &quot;had a strong feeling that Buda himself was one of the robbers, though I didn&#x27;t ask him and he didn&#x27;t say.&quot; Whether Buda and Ferruccio Coacci, whose shared rental house contained the manufacturer&#x27;s diagram of a .32 Savage automatic pistol (matching the .32 Savage pistol believed to have been used to shoot both Berardelli and Parmenter), had also participated in the Braintree robbery and murders would remain a matter of speculation.

==Later evidence and investigations==
In 1941, anarchist leader Carlo Tresca, a member of the Sacco and Vanzetti Defense Committee, told Max Eastman, &quot;Sacco was guilty but Vanzetti was innocent&quot;, although it is clear from his statement that Tresca equated guilt only with the act of pulling the trigger, i.e., Vanzetti was not the principal triggerman in Tresca&#x27;s view, but could have been an accomplice to Sacco. This conception of innocence is in sharp contrast to the legal one. Both &quot;The Nation&quot; and &quot;The New Republic&quot; refused to publish Tresca&#x27;s revelation, which Eastman said occurred after he pressed Tresca for the truth about the two men&#x27;s involvement in the shooting. The story finally appeared in &quot;National Review&quot; in October 1961. Others who had known Tresca confirmed that he had made similar statements to them, but Tresca&#x27;s daughter insisted her father never hinted at Sacco&#x27;s guilt. Others attributed Tresca&#x27;s revelations to his disagreements with the Galleanists.

Labor organizer Anthony Ramuglia, an anarchist in the 1920s, said in 1952 that a Boston anarchist group had asked him to be a false alibi witness for Sacco. After agreeing, he had remembered that he had been in jail on the day in question, so he could not testify.

Both Sacco and Vanzetti had previously fled to Mexico, changing their names in order to evade draft registration, a fact the prosecutor in their murder trial used to demonstrate their lack of patriotism and which they were not allowed to rebut. Sacco and Vanzetti&#x27;s supporters would later argue that the men fled the country to avoid persecution and conscription; their critics said they left to escape detection and arrest for militant and seditious activities in the United States. However, a 1953 Italian history of anarchism written by anonymous colleagues revealed a different motivation:

Several dozen Italian anarchists left the United States for Mexico. Some have suggested they did so because of cowardice. Nothing could be more false. The idea to go to Mexico arose in the minds of several comrades who were alarmed by the idea that, remaining in the United States, they would be forcibly restrained from leaving for Europe, where the revolution that had burst out in Russia that February promised to spread all over the continent.

In October 1961, ballistic tests were run with improved technology on Sacco&#x27;s Colt semi-automatic pistol. The results confirmed that the bullet that killed Berardelli in 1920 was fired from Sacco&#x27;s pistol. The Thayer court&#x27;s habit of mistakenly referring to Sacco&#x27;s .32 Colt pistol as well as any other automatic pistol as a &quot;revolver&quot; (a common custom of the day) has sometimes mystified later-generation researchers attempting to follow the forensic evidence trail.

In 1987, Charlie Whipple, a former &quot;Boston Globe&quot; editorial page editor, revealed a conversation that he had with Sergeant Edward J. Seibolt in 1937. According to Whipple, Seibolt said that &quot;we switched the murder weapon in that case&quot;, but indicated that he would deny this if Whipple ever printed it. However, at the time of the Sacco and Vanzetti trial, Seibolt was only a patrolman, and did not work in the Boston Police ballistics department; Seibolt died in 1961 without corroborating Whipple&#x27;s story. In 1935, Captain Charles Van Amburgh, a key ballistics witness for the prosecution, wrote a six-part article on the case for a pulp detective magazine. Van Amburgh described a scene in which Thayer caught defense ballistics expert Hamilton trying to leave the courtroom with Sacco&#x27;s gun. However, Thayer said nothing about such a move during the hearing on the gun barrel switch and refused to blame either side. Following the private hearing on the gun barrel switch, Van Amburgh kept Sacco&#x27;s gun in his house, where it remained until the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; did an exposé in 1960.

In 1973, a former mobster published a confession by Frank &quot;Butsy&quot; Morelli, Joe&#x27;s brother. &quot;We whacked them out, we killed those guys in the robbery&quot;, Butsy Morelli told Vincent Teresa. &quot;These two greaseballs Sacco and Vanzetti took it on the chin.&quot;

Before his death in June 1982, Giovanni Gambera, a member of the four-person team of anarchist leaders who met shortly after the arrest of Sacco and Vanzetti to plan their defense, told his son that &quot;everyone [in the anarchist inner circle] knew that Sacco was guilty and that Vanzetti was innocent as far as the actual participation in killing.&quot;

Months before he died, the distinguished jurist Charles E. Wyzanski, Jr., who had presided for 45 years on the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, wrote to Russell stating, &quot;I myself am persuaded by your writings that Sacco was guilty.&quot; The judge&#x27;s assessment was significant, because he was one of Felix Frankfurter&#x27;s &quot;Hot Dogs&quot;, and Justice Frankfurter had advocated his appointment to the federal bench.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published an article on December 24, 2005, &quot;Sinclair Letter Turns Out to Be Another Exposé&quot;, which references a newly discovered letter from Upton Sinclair to attorney John Beardsley in which Sinclair, a socialist writer famous for his muckraking novels, revealed a conversation with Fred Moore, attorney for Sacco and Vanzetti. In that conversation, in response to Sinclair&#x27;s request for the truth, Moore stated that both Sacco and Vanzetti were in fact guilty, and that Moore had fabricated their alibis in an attempt to avoid a guilty verdict. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; interprets subsequent letters as indicating that, to avoid loss of sales to his radical readership, particularly abroad, and due to fears for his own safety, Sinclair didn&#x27;t change the premise of his novel in that respect. However, Sinclair also expressed in those letters doubts as to whether Moore deserved to be trusted in the first place, and he did not actually assert the innocence of the two in the novel, focusing instead on the argument that the trial they got was not fair.

==Dukakis proclamation==
In 1977, as the 50th anniversary of the executions approached, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis asked the Office of the Governor&#x27;s Legal Counsel to report on &quot;whether there are substantial grounds for believing—at least in the light of the legal standards of today—that Sacco and Vanzetti were unfairly convicted and executed&quot; and recommend an appropriate action. The resulting &quot;Report to the Governor in the Matter of Sacco and Vanzetti&quot; detailed grounds for doubting that the trial was conducted fairly in the first instance, and argued as well that such doubts were only reinforced by &quot;later-discovered or later-disclosed evidence&quot;. The report questioned prejudicial cross-examination that the trial judge allowed, the judge&#x27;s hostility, the fragmentary nature of the evidence, and eyewitness testimony that came to light after the trial. It found the judge&#x27;s charge to the jury troubling for the way it emphasized the defendants&#x27; behavior at the time of their arrest and highlighted certain physical evidence that was later called into question. The report also dismissed the argument that the trial had been subject to judicial review, noting that &quot;the system for reviewing murder cases at the time ... failed to provide the safeguards now present.&quot;

Based on recommendations which were made by the Office of Legal Counsel, Dukakis declared that August 23, 1977, the 50th anniversary of their execution, was Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti Memorial Day. His proclamation, issued in English and Italian, stated that Sacco and Vanzetti had been unfairly tried and convicted and that &quot;any disgrace should be forever removed from their names.&quot; He did not pardon them, because that would imply they were guilty. Neither did he assert their innocence. A resolution to censure Dukakis failed in the Massachusetts Senate by a vote of 23 to 12. Dukakis later expressed regret only for not reaching out to the families of the victims of the crime.

==Later tributes==


A memorial committee tried to present a plaster cast which was constructed in 1937 by Gutzon Borglum, the sculptor of Mount Rushmore, to Massachusetts governors and Boston mayors in 1937, 1947, and 1957 without success. On August 23, 1997, on the 70th anniversary of the Sacco and Vanzetti executions, Boston&#x27;s first Italian-American Mayor, Thomas Menino, and the Italian-American Governor of Massachusetts, Paul Cellucci, unveiled the work at the Boston Public Library, where it remains on display:

&quot;The city&#x27;s acceptance of this piece of artwork is not intended to reopen debate about the guilt or innocence of Sacco and Vanzetti,&quot; Menino said. &quot;It is intended to remind us of the dangers of miscarried justice, and the right we all have to a fair trial.&quot;The event occasioned a renewed debate about the fairness of the trial in the editorial pages of the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;.
A mosaic mural portraying the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti is installed on the main campus of Syracuse University.
In Braintree, Massachusetts on the corner of French Avenue and Pearl Street, a memorial marks the site of the murders. The memorial has two exhibits. The first is a weatherproof poster that discusses the crime and the subsequent trial. The second exhibit is a metal plaque that memorializes the victims of the crime.

The &quot;Sacco and Vanzetti Centuria&quot; was an American anarchist military unit in the Durruti Column that fought in the Spanish Civil War.

Many sites in the former USSR are named after &quot;Sacco and Vanzetti&quot;: for example, a beer production facility in Moscow, a kolkhoz in Donetsk region, Ukraine; and a street and an apartment complex in Yekaterinburg. &#x27;Sacco and Vanzetti&#x27; was also a popular brand of Russian pencil from 1930 to 2007. Numerous towns in Italy have streets named after Sacco and Vanzetti, including Via Sacco-Vanzetti in Torremaggiore, Sacco&#x27;s home town; and Villafalletto, Vanzetti&#x27;s.

In Bakhmut Raion in Eastern Ukraine, there is Sakko i Vantsetti, a small village which is named after them, and it was occupied by Russian forces from Feb to mid-May 2023 during the Battle of Bakhmut.

In 2017, as part of an Eagle Scout project, a plaque was placed outside of Norfolk Superior Court commemorating the trial. The Justinian Law Society
of Massachusetts owns the bound transcripts of the trial with a verbatim transcription of testimony, objections, and statements by the attorneys and judge in the case. In 2024, they loaned the books to the Dedham Museum and Archive for curation.

<text>Chang Bunker (จัน บังเกอร์) and Eng Bunker (อิน บังเกอร์) (May 11, 1811 – January 17, 1874) were Siamese (Thai)-American conjoined twin brothers whose fame propelled the expression &quot;Siamese twins&quot; to become synonymous for conjoined twins in general. They were widely exhibited as curiosities and were &quot;two of the nineteenth century&#x27;s most studied human beings&quot;.

The brothers were born with Chinese ancestry in Siam (now known as Thailand) and were brought to the United States in 1829. Physicians inspected them as they became known to American and European audiences in &quot;freak shows&quot;. Newspapers and the public were initially sympathetic to them, and within three years they left the control of their managers, who they thought were cheating them, and toured on their own. In early exhibitions, they were exoticized and displayed their athleticism; they later held conversations in English in a more dignified parlor setting.

In 1839, after a decade of financial success, the twins quit touring and settled near Mount Airy, North Carolina. They became American citizens, bought slaves, married local sisters, and fathered 21 children, several of whom accompanied them when they resumed touring. Chang and Eng&#x27;s respective families lived in separate houses, where the twins took alternating three-day stays. After the Civil War, they lost part of their wealth and their slaves. Eng died hours after Chang at the age of 62. An autopsy revealed that their livers were fused in the ligament connecting their sterna.

The novelist Darin Strauss writes, &quot;their conjoined history was a confusion of legend, sideshow hyperbole, and editorial invention even while they lived.&quot; Many works have fictionalized the Bunkers&#x27; lives, often to symbolize cooperation or discord, notably in representing the Union and Confederacy during the Civil War.

==In Siam (1811–1829)==

Chang and Eng (จัน-อิน) were born in 1811 in Siam (modern-day Thailand). Their mother reportedly said their birth was no more difficult than that of their other several siblings. Their exact date of birth and details of their early lives are unclear. The earliest report on the twins assigns the birth month of May 1811. Their native village is called Meklong (today&#x27;s Samut Songkhram); a statue in the town commemorates the twins&#x27; birthplace.

Their father, Ti-eye or Ti (นายที), was a fisherman of Chinese descent. He died when the twins were young, possibly in a smallpox epidemic that ran through the area in 1819. Their mother, Nak (อำแดงนาก), raised ducks with her children&#x27;s help. Their mother&#x27;s ethnic origin is unclear. Varying accounts suggest that she was Siamese, Chinese, part-Chinese and part-Siamese, or part-Chinese and part-Malay. Chang and Eng were raised as Theravada Buddhists. Despite being joined at the sternum, they were lively youths, running and playing with other children. Their mother raised them like her other children, in a &quot;matter-of-fact&quot; way without special attention on them being conjoined.

The &quot;discovery&quot; of the brothers is credited to the Scottish merchant Robert Hunter. Hunter was a trusted trade associate of the Siamese government who traveled with considerable freedom. In 1824, Hunter reportedly first met the twins while he was on a fishing boat in the Menam River and the twins were swimming at dusk. He mistook them for a &quot;strange animal&quot;, but after meeting them he saw economic opportunity in bringing them to the West.

He would later tell a story that the king of Siam had ordered the brothers&#x27; deaths and had originally forbidden him to transport them out of the country. Regardless of the story&#x27;s veracity, it took five years for Hunter to bring them away. Hunter and American sea captain Abel Coffin departed to the United States with the twins in summer 1829. A contract Hunter and Coffin signed with the brothers stipulated that their tour would last for five years, though a rumor later circulated that Chang and Eng&#x27;s mother had sold them into slavery, a charge that greatly upset the twins.

Christian missionaries contacted their mother in 1845, four years before she died. She had believed that her conjoined sons were dead, having not seen them for fifteen years, but was informed that they were alive and recently married.

== Travel and touring (1829–1839) ==

Chang and Eng were 17 years old when they traveled to the United States with Hunter, Coffin, a crew of 18 men, and a Siamese translator. They arrived in Boston on August 16, 1829, and the next day the &quot;Boston Patriot&quot; confirmed Coffin and Hunter&#x27;s ambitions: the twins &quot;will probably be exhibited to the public&quot;. They were soon inspected by physicians, many of whom employed physiognomy and phrenology. Their arrival was excitedly reported in newspapers with varying degrees of racial stereotypes and falsehoods.

After leaving the United States they toured major cities in the British Isles, and by the time they returned to New York in March 1831, the twins had gained some skill in English reading, writing, and speaking. Newspapers reported that they had earned great profits, and their promotional materials began to describe their customers as dignified—though their act of exhibition could seem crude—to help bring more moneyed visitors.

The twins first appeared in London at the Egyptian Hall. They later toured Europe, then returned to the United States, appearing at dime museums and other venues. When touring in cities, the twins stayed at a hotel for several days (sometimes more than a week) and charged audiences to attend their &quot;freak show&quot;. In small towns, their manager would send flyers ahead of their arrival, and they would remain at a lodge or inn for just one or two nights. Their first manager, James W. Hale, introduced them as the &quot;Siamese Youths&quot;, a name they preferred to &quot;boys&quot;. The usual admission price was 25 cents, , and pamphlets and drawings featuring the brothers were usually also for sale. In early performances, the twins performed physical feats, running and doing somersaults. An emphasis was placed on their exoticness: they wore pigtails, dressed in &quot;Oriental&quot; clothing, and were soon billed as the &quot;Siamese twins&quot;. Their performances occasionally featured swimming, playing checkers, and doing parlor tricks.

===Conflicts on tour===

In summer 1831, Hale took the twins on a retreat in Lynnfield, Massachusetts. While hunting game, they thought they were being taunted and harassed by over a dozen local men who had approached them, going on to strike a man named Elbridge Gerry with the butt of their gun. Gerry retaliated, throwing a heavy stone at one twin&#x27;s head, drawing blood. The twins then fired at Gerry, though the gun was blank. The men ran off. The following day, one of the men pressed charges, alleging that the twins were at fault. A special court was convened, and the brothers were arrested for disturbing the peace and paid bond for good behavior. The &quot;Salem Mercury&quot; portrayed the twins as the victims of the Lynnfield incident; other papers followed suit. Two weeks after the event, Gerry published a letter titled &quot;To the Public&quot;, saying that the twins had provoked the violence. Hale was angered that the twins had gotten into a situation in which their public image could be slandered. He resigned as their manager in September 1831 and was replaced by a friend, Charles Harris. Hale counseled Harris; for example, he could avoid paying a Virginia exhibition tax through careful marketing: he was to call the twins&#x27; tour a &quot;business&quot;, not a &quot;show&quot;. In the public eye, Abel Coffin, the man who first brought them to the United States, continued to serve as a father figure to the twins.

The twins were soon involved in another conflict, during a performance in Alabama. A surgeon in attendance asked to conduct a close examination of the ligature connecting the twins. They refused, having not permitted close inspections for more than two years. Rising in anger, the doctor said, &quot;You are all a set of impostors and pickpockets&quot;, and disorder erupted as guests threw objects across the room. The twins fled and later, because they probably were the first ones to disturb the peace, paid a good-behavior bond as ordered by a magistrate.

Relations between the twins and the Coffins strained beginning in January 1831 when Abel&#x27;s wife, Susan Coffin, upset the twins by refusing their requests. Chang and Eng then started asking Harris to send letters pleading their cases. In one instance, Mrs. Coffin refused the twins an additional $3 per week to feed their horse, a refusal the twins compared to clipping a bird&#x27;s wings and saying, &quot;Now you may fly if you wish&quot;. Harris first maintained a distinction between his and the twins&#x27; point of view but eventually wrote using their voice and had them sign their names, &quot;Chang Eng&quot;.

Abel Coffin left for Asia in late 1831 and planned to return to America by January 1832. After January passed, the twins&#x27; relations with Mrs. Coffin broke down completely, the twins regularly asking when Abel Coffin would return. They hoped to be free from commitment to the Coffins on their 21st birthday (in May 1832), as Abel had once promised. They also worried that, should he never return, they would remain in permanent limbo between contract and freedom. They began also to think that Mrs. Coffin was &quot;deceitful and greedy&quot; as they learned of the Coffins&#x27; management practices. For instance, Mrs. Coffin had encouraged them to perform when they were sick. During one trip, the Coffins had paid full fare for themselves but booked the twins into steerage, listing them as servants, and lied then to them when they were questioned. And the twins learned that Mrs. Coffin was willing to pay a higher wage only for a certain attendant, not the one whom the twins preferred. They jointly came to believe that Mrs. Coffin &quot;had misled me&quot;.

===Independent travel===

Abel Coffin, upon returning to Massachusetts in July 1832, discovered that Chang and Eng were missing. Coffin accused Hale of &quot;exciting &quot;his subjects&quot; to rebellion&quot; (Hale had done no such thing), and after a chase he finally tracked down the brothers in Bath, New York. Hale later said Coffin told him he had met the twins &quot;whoring, gaming, and drinking&quot; and &quot;gave Chang Eng &#x27;the damndest thrashing they ever had in their lives&#x27;&quot;. On the twins&#x27; desertion, Coffin simply wrote to his wife as follows: &quot;We have had much talk; they seem to feel themselves quite free from me.&quot;

The twins themselves did not immediately announce that they were in business on their own, nor did they much alter their public persona. Nonetheless, they were now exclusively referred to by their stage name—the &quot;Siamese twins&quot;—and they did change some parts of their performance, such as by wearing more American clothes, speaking English with the audience, and presenting themselves no longer as &quot;boys&quot; but men. They also answered audience questions sitting in a formal, parlor setting and hunted game in their free time. What had once essentially been their indentured servitude had changed to freedom; they were in command of their act and hired their own staff.

Chang and Eng did not perform on their sightseeing trip across Western Europe in 1835–36 visiting Paris, Antwerp, The Hague, Amsterdam, and other cities. In 1836, Hale published a pamphlet about them titled &quot;A Few Particulars concerning Chang-Eng, the United Siamese Brothers, Published under Their Own Direction&quot;. Positioning the twins as upper-class, saying that in Siam, Chinese were elites; it reported, among other particulars, that a representative of President Jackson had visited the twins&#x27; mother.

==Settling and later years (1839–1874)==

===Traphill===

The final setting for Chang and Eng&#x27;s on-and-off 1829–1839 tour was held in Jefferson, North Carolina, on July 3 and 4, 1839. According to a family friend, their move to Wilkes County, in the northwest of the state, allowed them to &quot;engage in chasing stag and catching trout ... to enjoy the recreation which they had desired to find far away from the hurrying crowds.&quot; In October 1839, they purchased for $300, , near the rural community of Traphill, in mountainous northeast Wilkes County. The tract runs along Little Sandy Creek, near the Roaring River.

They soon became well acquainted with members of elite Wilkes society, including James Calloway and Robert C. Martin, both physicians; Abner Carmichael, the county sheriff; and James W. Gwyn Jr., the county&#x27;s superior court clerk. Charles Harris, their former manager, relocated with them, and he became the Traphill postmaster. The month they bought the land, the twins (as well as Irish-born Harris) became naturalized citizens. Gwyn administered their oath of allegiance; despite a federal law from 1790 restricting naturalization to &quot;free white persons&quot;, citizenship was a matter generally governed by local attitudes.

A home on Chang and Eng&#x27;s Traphill land was constructed in 1840. The brothers would buy foodstuffs from Wilkes slaveholders and trade dry goods with their neighbors. They also bought slaves and hired several women as housekeepers; the twins&#x27; first slave was named &quot;Aunt&quot; Grace Gates. Prosperous from touring, they displayed their wealth through elegant house decorations; by the early 1840s, their property was the third-most valuable in the county at $1,000, . Settled, they planned to stop exhibiting for good, content to live in Traphill. The Whig Party newspaper &quot;Carolina Watchman&quot; of Salisbury called them &quot;genuine Whigs&quot;, and the &quot;Boston Transcript&quot; reported that they were &quot;happy as lords&quot;.

In 1840, a profile of the twins in the &quot;Tennessee Mirror&quot; made clear the twins&#x27; intentions to marry. Many newspapers regularly joked about this, discouraging their marriage not just with objections over the twins&#x27; disability but also because of their race. Nevertheless, on April 13, 1843, Baptist preacher Colby Sparks officiated the weddings between Eng and Sarah Yates, and between Chang and Adelaide Yates. Though national (mainly Northern) newspapers generally condemned the marriages, there was probably little local reaction except purported vandalism of Sarah and Adelaide&#x27;s parents&#x27; house the night before the wedding. The Bunkers would prominently feature their marriages when they went back on tour later in life.

By the late 1840s, the twins spoke English fluently, had voted, and had filed criminal charges against several white people. They had also adopted the English-language surname &quot;Bunker&quot;, in honor of a woman whom they met in New York and admired. Continued newspaper coverage, as visitors flocked to their Traphill home, established their place as national celebrities; and they felt themselves to be Americans. The Bunkers carved a unique place in Americans&#x27; perception of race—they were considered nonwhite but were afforded many of the privileges of White people, being fairly wealthy Southern slaveholders with property rights.

===Mount Airy===

On March 1, 1845, the Bunkers bought a plot of in Surry County. They had a home built—at first just for part-time use—about south of Mount Airy, along Stewart&#x27;s Creek. The twins amassed wealth during the late 1840s and 1850s and lived in luxury as plantation owners. In 1850, it was estimated that they had invested $10,000 in property in North Carolina, . Meanwhile, they had a merchant in New York who managed another $60,000 for importing, , and they lived off the interest.

For about a decade they split their time between Mount Airy and Traphill because their families had grown large; by 1847 Adelaide had given birth to four children; Sarah, to three. They would maintain the Traphill residence through 1853; later their time was divided solely between two homes located around Mount Airy. Then for the next decades, the twins would alternate which house they used, three days at a time; the twin who owned the current house could elect to do whatever he wanted while his brother complied and kept silent.

In 1850, ten of their 18 slaves were under the age of seven, some being owned only to be sold later for profit, and others growing up to work the fields. The Bunker plantations produced wheat, rye, corn, oats, and potatoes, and they raised cows, sheep, and pigs. Unlike families that owned many North Carolina farms, the Bunkers did not grow tobacco, which may suggest that their plantation was run primarily to feed the Bunker family and its slaves, not for commercial purposes. The press characterized the Bunkers&#x27; treatment of slaves as particularly harsh, though the twins decried accusations of cruelty and said that their wives supervised the slaves and raised money for their education.

Though the Bunkers were generally part of the region&#x27;s aristocracy, some of their practices set them apart. They were occasionally seen performing manual labor; their method of chopping wood was particularly effective: they would wield an axe with all four hands, for more force, or would rapidly alternate turns swinging. They continued recreational hunting, and they took up fishing, drinking, and several sports.

===Return to touring===

Partial retirement ended up not suiting the Bunkers, and they sought to resume touring for what they called financial reasons: they said they needed to earn more money to support their then-seven children. They traveled to New York City in 1849 with daughters Katherine and Josephine, both aged five, but the brief tour petered out because of poor management, and they returned to North Carolina. Advertisements had described them as &quot;The Living Siamese Twins Chang-Eng and Their Children&quot;.

They conducted a successful year-long tour in 1853, again bringing two children (Christopher and Katherine). They again justified the tour by saying their motivation was to raise money to support their (by this point, 11) children&#x27;s education. On this tour, viewings were like levees and were not elaborate, as the twins and their children usually sat, spoke, and mingled with the audience. Chang and Eng wore American suits and spoke in English about their marriages and families, and they also showed off their wit and political knowledge. They appeared educated and polite, according to biographer Joseph Andrew Orser, and &quot;might have appeared as a distinguished southern family on display except for the fact that no family of distinction would exhibit itself to the public.&quot;

In early October 1860 they signed with famed showman P. T. Barnum for a month and exhibited in Barnum&#x27;s American Museum in New York City. Alongside Zip the Pinhead, they performed for several distinguished guests, including the Prince of Wales; in 1868, they would briefly tour with Zip in the British Isles. Contrary to popular belief, Barnum did not create the Bunkers&#x27; careers; in fact, they were competitors in the entertainment business and the twins had already become world-famous from their own tours. The brothers and Barnum did not like each other, and the twins rejected Barnum&#x27;s offer of a longer, countrywide tour.

They departed New York City on November 12, 1860, and took steamships and crossed Panama by train to arrive in San Francisco on December 6. Californians at the time were in the midst of figuring out how to deal with a recent influx of Chinese immigrants, and the arrival of the Bunkers (as well as two of Eng&#x27;s sons, Patrick and Montgomery) was put in the spotlight. As usual, Chang and Eng were favorably received by audiences with whom they spoke, though reports of their performances in California took various perspectives on their race and nationality. Newspapers called them &quot;yellow&quot; but also the &quot;greatest of living curiosities&quot; who had &quot;made much noise in the world, and are certainly worth seeing&quot;. They left California on February 11, 1861, by which time seven states had seceded from the United States, sparking the American Civil War. The Bunkers likely returned to their Mount Airy homes by April—after gunfire had begun in South Carolina, but before North Carolina seceded on May 20.

===Civil War metaphor===

Throughout the Civil War, the twins&#x27; conjoined state served in several metaphors. In July 1860, the &quot;Louisville Journal&quot; chided divisions in the Democratic Party by making the twins out to represent rival factions within the party, split on the extent to which slavery should be federally protected. The Bunker brothers were long-time supporters of the Whig Party, however, and a neighbor wrote to &quot;The Fayetteville Observer&quot; that they &quot;are not now and never have been Democrats [and] they say they never expect to be Democrats&quot;. This neighbor also said that in the 1860 presidential election both twins supported the Tennessean John Bell of the Constitutional Union Party, a candidate popular in northwestern North Carolina whose platform included both support of slavery and of preservation of the union.

More prominently, many newspapers fictitiously wrote that Chang and Eng were at odds with each other on the issue of secession, personifying fears of sectional violence. The &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; ran a colorful allegory that claimed to be an account of a dispute between the twins while they were at Barnum&#x27;s American Museum. It says that Chang, the quarrelsome one, wants the ligament connecting them to be painted black (signifying the key issue of slavery) but that Eng does not. Chang says that his &quot;union&quot; with Eng is to be &quot;dissolved&quot;, while a &quot;Dr. Lincoln&quot; reasons that a separation surgery would be &quot;dangerous for both parties&quot;&quot;. According to Orser, &quot;The united brothers had become symbols of the American union and the promise it offered to its citizens.&quot;

===Final years===

By the time the Civil War ended in 1865, the twins&#x27; finances had suffered (they had lent money that was repaid in worthless Confederate currency) and their slaves were emancipated, so they decided to resume touring. Northern audiences at this point were not so receptive to the twins—for they had been Confederate slaveholders—so during tours they sympathetically presented themselves as old men, with many children, who only reluctantly supported their state over country and who each had a son hurt in the war, one injured and one captured (serving in the Confederate States Army). Newspapers disparagingly wrote that the twins had lost &quot;a considerable number of slaves of about the same color of themselves&quot; and claimed that the twins were taking advantage of their audience.

Chang and Eng made a trip to Britain in 1868–69, seeing physicians and chatting in exhibition; their last visit there had been over 30 years before. Chang&#x27;s daughter Nannie, who had never before been far from home, and Eng&#x27;s daughter Kate, both in their 20s, came on the trip, from North Carolina to Baltimore and New York, then across the Atlantic to Liverpool and into rural Scotland, later going to Manchester.

In 1870, Chang, Eng, and two sons went to Germany and Russia; they wanted to further explore Europe, but returned home to avoid the developing Franco-Prussian War. On the ship back home, Chang&#x27;s right side (toward Eng) became paralyzed after he suffered a stroke, and they effectively retired, as Eng cared for Chang. The Bunker estate in 1870 was worth $30,000 in total, —two-thirds belonging to Chang.

===Family===

Sarah Yates Bunker was born on December 18, 1822, the fourth child and second daughter of David and Nancy Yates. Sometimes called &quot;Mrs. Eng&quot;, she was seen as the simpler sister and, uneducated, lived frugally and was a capable chef. She was also described as the &quot;more portly, fair one&quot;.

Adelaide Yates Bunker, or &quot;Mrs. Chang&quot;, was born on October 11, 1823. Taller and thinner than her older sister, she was said to have &quot;excelled in personal beauty&quot; and to have possessed a more refined taste. It was said that both Chang and Eng favored Sarah; according to a contemporary newspaper, however, &quot;To any but an oriental taste, [Adelaide] was much the prettiest, being, in fact, a handsome and showy brunette.&quot;

Both sisters outlived their husbands; Sarah died at age 69 on April 29, 1892. Adelaide died at age 93 on May 21, 1917.

Chang&#x27;s and Eng&#x27;s first children were born within six days of each other: Sarah gave birth to Katherine Marcellus on February 10, 1844; Adelaide, to Josephine Virginia on February 16. One set of cousins was born eight days apart: Chang&#x27;s son Christopher and Eng&#x27;s daughter Julia. Altogether, Chang and Adelaide had ten children and Eng and Sarah had eleven; in total, there were twelve daughters and nine sons; two children were deaf, two died from burns before the age of three and none were born as twins.

The twins occasionally attended church with their wives. Their children were for some time formally educated, and generally they were seen favorably; a profile of Chang and Eng said the children represented &quot;a credit to their parents and the community in which they live&quot;.

, descendants of Chang and Eng&#x27;s 21 children number about 1,500. Much of the extended family still lives in western North Carolina, and the family has hosted annual get-togethers since the 1980s, usually on the last Saturday of June. Chang&#x27;s descendants include grandson Caleb V. Haynes, an Air Force major general, and his son Vance Haynes, an archaeologist; great-granddaughter Alex Sink, former Chief Financial Officer of Florida and the Democratic nominee for Governor of Florida in 2010; and great-great-granddaughter Caroline Shaw, a composer and the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Music recipient. Eng&#x27;s descendants include grandson George F. Ashby, president of the Union Pacific Railroad in the 1940s. The Bunker pedigree contains 11 sets of twins, none conjoined; the first set of twins, Eng&#x27;s great-grandsons, were also named Chang and Eng.

==Medical condition and deaths==

At birth, Chang and Eng were healthy xiphopagus twins connected at the sternum by a flexible circular band of flesh and cartilage, about long with a maximum circumference of . Their livers were connected through the band, and only at the middle of the ligament did they share sensation.

Most physicians who met the twins recommended against surgery for separation, as with medical technology at the time it would have been a fatal procedure. Contemporary medical literature strongly suggests that the twins could have been easily separated today. Their autopsy was performed by surgeon William Pancoast of Philadelphia&#x27;s Jefferson Medical College.

While Eng enjoyed good health toward the end of his life, most of Chang&#x27;s right side became paralyzed in 1870 after his stroke, and eventually his right leg needed to be kept in a sling. From then on, Chang—becoming a heavy drinker—remained in poor health. Chang contracted bronchitis in January 1874, and the family physician recommended that he stay indoors and warm. On January 15, the Bunkers traveled through cold weather to Eng&#x27;s house. Chang seemed to have recovered somewhat by the next day but at night was unable to breathe comfortably. On Chang&#x27;s urging the brothers slept sitting upright on a chair, in front of a fireplace. Eng was healthy physically yet weary from spending the past week with a seriously ill Chang, so he asked to move to their bed after hours of drifting in and out of sleep.

Early in the morning of January 17, one of Eng&#x27;s sons checked on the sleeping twins. &quot;Uncle Chang is dead,&quot; the boy reportedly said to Eng, who responded, &quot;Then I am going!&quot; The family doctor was quickly sent for but Eng soon died, reportedly just over two hours after his brother&#x27;s death. The Bunkers had the longest known life-span (62 years) of any conjoined twins in history until 2012, when their record was surpassed by Ronnie and Donnie Galyon (1951–2020). Eng was remembered as a caring supporter of his brother, especially during their final years, when Chang developed severe illnesses. After their deaths, their good friend Jesse Franklin Graves recalled, &quot;[Eng&#x27;s] kindness was received with the warmest appreciation by Chang, whose disposition was very different from the morose, ill nature so falsely ascribed to him [by the press].&quot;

===Autopsy===

The &quot;New York Herald&quot; ran a front-page story about the Bunkers&#x27; deaths, which attracted public demand for an autopsy as well as the attention of William Pancoast, who successfully petitioned for the opportunity to study the twins. It was rumored that Pancoast and other physicians had offered money to Chang and Eng&#x27;s widows to inspect the twins, but more likely the doctors pressured the sisters into giving up the bodies by framing this donation as their &quot;duty to science and humanity&quot;. The bodies were preserved for two weeks by the cold weather, and then an express train delivered them to the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, where the autopsy was performed and where preliminary findings were presented on February 18 while the autopsy was in progress.

The twins&#x27; final autopsy report said that Chang had most likely died of a cerebral blood clot; the cause of Eng&#x27;s death was left unclear. Pancoast and colleague Harrison Allen attributed it to shock—that is, Eng &quot;died of fright&quot; upon seeing his dead brother—based on the fact that Eng&#x27;s bladder had distended with urine and his right testicle had retracted. Others who worked on the autopsy suggested alternate theories, most prominently that Eng had died of blood loss as his circulatory system pumped blood through the connecting band into his dead brother&#x27;s body and received no blood in return. &quot;In the end,&quot; wrote academic Cynthia Wu in 2012, &quot;that Eng died of fright prevails not only in the medical record but also in the popular-cultural imagination.&quot;

==Legacy==

The Bunker brothers coined the term &quot;Siamese twins&quot;, and their fame made it a synonym for conjoined twins in colloquial use, even referring to those before the Bunkers&#x27; lifetime; however, modern researchers see the term as outmoded, preferring &quot;conjoined twins&quot;. The phrase &quot;like the Siamese twins&quot; (or variations) was in use as early as October 1829 to describe other conjoined pairs, but over the decades use of the standalone &quot;Siamese twins&quot; became widespread. &quot;Siamese&quot; is sometimes used separately to refer to any conjoined pairs, like &#x27;Siamese standpipes&#x27;, a type of fire hydrant.

Chang and Eng are often referred to retrospectively as the &quot;original Siamese twins&quot;.

Before the Bunkers&#x27; bodies were returned to North Carolina for burial (in 1917 they were moved to the cemetery at White Plains Baptist Church outside Mount Airy), doctors took photographs of the connecting tissue and hired sculptor John Casani to make a plaster cast of the twins. The Bunkers&#x27; fused livers are preserved in fluid and displayed in a clear jar along with the death cast in Philadelphia&#x27;s Mütter Museum as a permanent exhibition. A basement room of the Andy Griffith Museum contains an exhibit on the twins. The Circus World Museum houses life-size figures of the twins. The Southern Historical Collection of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill keeps the Bunkers&#x27; personal papers.

===In fiction===

Many anonymous promotional pamphlets were printed depicting the Bunkers in artwork and literature, comprising early fiction pieces on the &quot;Siamese twins&quot;; the twins were used more metaphorically in later works. Edward Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s satirical poem &quot;The Siamese Twins&quot; was published while they toured Britain. Mentioning them in his novels &quot;The Confidence-Man&quot; and &quot;Billy Budd&quot;, Herman Melville also alludes to the Bunkers in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;. The anti-socialist political cartoonist Thomas Nast in 1874 drew &quot;The American Twins&quot;, in which a worker (&quot;Labor&quot;) wears an apron next to a businessman (&quot;Capital&quot;) with a sack of money who are joined at the chests with a band labeled &quot;The Real Union&quot;. Before the United States entered World War II, Dr. Seuss used a &quot;Siamese Beard&quot; in his 1941 cartoon &quot;The Great U.S. Sideshow&quot; to attach a man with an America First shirt to Nazi Germany.

Mark Twain referenced conjoined twins in several ways, such as by wearing a pink sash connecting him to another man onstage at a New Year&#x27;s Eve party; in &quot;Personal Habits of the Siamese Twins&quot; (1869), republished as &quot;The Siamese Twins&quot; in his 1875 collection &quot;Sketches New and Old&quot;, Twain provides an account of the Bunkers&#x27; lives, including both true and outlandish anecdotes. This satirical work, with Twain&#x27;s typical deadpan humor, jokes about, among other things, the twins&#x27; different attitudes and their romantic pursuit of the same woman.

The musical &quot;Chang &amp; Eng&quot;, directed by Ekachai Uekrongtham, has themes of open-mindedness and interdependence, and it opened in Singapore in 1997. &quot;Chang &amp; Eng&quot; (2000), the debut novel of Darin Strauss, is a fictionalized account of the Bunker brothers&#x27; lives based on some historical context. Chang is the narrator in &quot;God&#x27;s Fool&quot; (2002), Mark Slouka&#x27;s first novel, and he has a hindsight letting him know the importance of future events. The story of Eng and Chang is retold via sock puppets in the 2009 film &quot;Trash Humpers&quot; directed by Harmony Korine. The play &quot;I Dream of Chang and Eng&quot; by playwright Philip Kan Gotanda, a &quot;reimagining&quot; of the twins&#x27; lives that departs somewhat from truthfulness, was workshopped and performed at UC Berkeley in 2011. Chang and Eng (played by Danial Son and Yusaku Komori) are featured in the musical biopic &quot;The Greatest Showman&quot; (2017) about the early years of the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.

In the 1988 movie &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, directed by David Cronenberg, identical twin brothers (both portrayed by Jeremy Irons) come to identify with the Siamese twins Chang and Eng, and the story of their sad death is evoked.

<doc id="263266" wikidata="Q4311841" url="?curid=263266" title="Penetration diving">
<text>An overhead or penetration diving environment is where the diver enters a space from which there is no direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside or under other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit. 

There are some applications where scuba diving is appropriate and surface-supplied diving is not, and other where the converse is true. In other applications either may be appropriate, and the mode is chosen to suit the specific circumstances. In all cases risk is managed by appropriate planning, skills, training and choice of equipment.

== Environments ==
Penetration diving is also known as diving in overhead environments, which is a class of confinement which restricts the diver from free vertical access to the surface. An overhead environment may also be a confined space, in which the diver is restricted in their ability to maneuver, and is roughly the opposite of open water. Confinement can influence diver safety and the ability of the diver to perform the required task. Some types of confinement improve safety by limiting the ability of the diver to move into higher risk areas, others limit the ability of the diver to maneuver, to perform the task of the dive, or to escape to a place of safety in an emergency. The usual types of recreational penetration diving are cave diving, cavern diving, ice diving and wreck penetration diving. Professional divers may also penetrate culverts, intakes such as penstocks, sewers, and under floating ships.
An overhead may be as minor as an overhang, a topographical feature which is open to at least one side, but obstructed overhead, and deep enough for a diver to be under the overhang, or as severe as a major restriction deep inside a cave or wreck. A is a space through which it is possible for a diver to pass with some difficulty due to a lack of space. A minor restriction is too small for two divers to swim through together, a major restriction requires the diver to remove some equipment to fit through.
A swim-through is an arch, lintel, or short, clear tunnel that has sufficient space to allow a diver to swim through and where the light of the opening at the far end is visible through the hole. It is technically an overhead environment, but one often entered by divers with only open water certification, if the risk of entrapment appears to be very low.
Diving under moored ships, usually for inspection, maintenance and repair, or incidentally, when diving from one is also considered penetration diving if the ship is large. In some cases the gap between the ship and the bottom or the jetty or dock can be quite small and the visibility may be poor.
Fatal accidents have occurred when a diver has run out of air trying to find the way out from under a large flat-bottomed vessel in low visibility.

==Cave diving==
Cave-diving is underwater diving in water-filled caves. It may be done as an extreme sport, a way of exploring flooded caves for scientific investigation, or for the search for and recovery of divers or, as in the 2018 Thai cave rescue, other cave users. The equipment used varies depending on the circumstances, and ranges from breath hold to surface supplied, but almost all cave-diving is done using scuba equipment, often in specialised configurations with redundancies such as sidemount or backmounted twinset. Recreational cave-diving is generally considered to be a type of technical diving due to the lack of a free surface during large parts of the dive, and often involves planned decompression stops. A distinction is made by recreational diver training agencies between cave-diving and cavern-diving, where cavern diving is deemed to be diving in those parts of a cave where the exit to open water can be seen by natural light. An arbitrary distance limit to the open water surface may also be specified.

Equipment, procedures, and the requisite skills have been developed to reduce the risk of becoming lost in a flooded cave, and consequently drowning when the breathing gas supply runs out. The equipment aspect largely involves the provision of an adequate breathing gas supply to cover reasonably foreseeable contingencies, redundant dive lights and other safety critical equipment, and the use of a continuous guideline leading the divers back out of the overhead environment. The skills and procedures include effective management of the equipment, and procedures to recover from foreseeable contingencies and emergencies, both by individual divers, and by the teams that dive together.

Despite these risks, water-filled caves attract scuba divers, cavers, and speleologists due to their often unexplored nature, and present divers with a technical diving challenge. Underwater caves have a wide range of physical features, and can contain fauna not found elsewhere. Several organisations dedicated to cave diving safety and exploration exist, and several agencies provide specialised training in the skills and procedures considered necessary for acceptable safety.

===Cavern diving===
Cavern diving is an arbitrarily defined, limited scope activity of diving in the naturally illuminated part of underwater caves, where the risk of getting lost is small, as the exit can be seen, and the equipment needed is reduced due to the limited distance to surface air. It is defined as a recreational diving activity as opposed to a technical diving activity on the grounds of low risk and basic equipment requirements.

==Ice diving==
Ice diving is a type of penetration diving where the dive takes place under ice. Because diving under ice places the diver in an overhead environment typically with only a single entry/exit point, it requires special procedures and equipment. Ice diving is done for purposes of recreation, scientific research, public safety (usually search and rescue/recovery) and other professional or commercial reasons.

The most obvious hazards of ice diving are getting lost under the ice, hypothermia, and regulator failure due to freezing. Scuba divers are generally tethered for safety. This means that the diver wears a harness to which a line is secured, and the other end of the line is secured above the surface and monitored by an attendant. Surface supplied equipment inherently provides a tether, and reduces the risks of regulator first stage freezing as the first stage can be managed by the surface team, and the breathing gas supply is less limited. For the surface support team, the hazards include freezing temperatures and falling through thin ice.

==Wreck penetration diving==
Penetration diving in shipwrecks is done as a recreational activity and as a professional activity in salvage and clearance work.

===Wreck diving===
Wreck diving is recreational diving where the wreckage of ships, aircraft and other artificial structures are explored. The term is used mainly by recreational and technical divers. Professional divers, when diving on a shipwreck, generally refer to the specific task, such as salvage work, accident investigation or archaeological survey. Although most wreck dive sites are at shipwrecks, there is an increasing trend to scuttle retired ships to create artificial reef sites. Diving to crashed aircraft can also be considered wreck diving. The recreation of wreck diving makes no distinction as to how the vessel ended up on the bottom.

Some wreck diving involves penetration of the wreckage, making a direct ascent to the surface impossible for a part of the dive.

===Salvage diving===
Salvage diving is the diving work associated with the recovery of all or part of ships, their cargoes, aircraft, and other vehicles and structures which have sunk or fallen into water. In the case of ships it may also refer to repair work done to make an abandoned or distressed but still floating vessel more suitable for towing or propulsion under its own power. The recreational/technical activity known as wreck diving is generally not considered salvage work, though some recovery of artifacts may be done by recreational divers.

Most salvage diving is commercial work, or military work, depending on the diving contractor and the purpose for the salvage operation, Similar underwater work may be done by divers as part of forensic investigations into accidents, in which case the procedures may be more closely allied with underwater archaeology than the more basic procedures of advantageous cost/benefit expected in commercial and military operations. 

Savage work that may require penetration of flooded internal spaces or diving under the vessel includes surveys of underwater damage, patching, shoring and other reinforcement, and attachment of lifting gear.

===Clearance diving===

Clearance diving, the removal of obstructions and hazards to navigation, is closely related to salvage diving, but has a different purpose, in that the objects to be removed are not intended to be recovered, just removed or reduced to a condition where they no longer constitute a hazard or obstruction. Many of the techniques and procedures used in clearance diving are also used in salvage work.

==Diving under ships==

The underside of the hull is an overhead environment with no direct vertical access to the surface. As such it constitutes an entrapment hazard, particularly under large vessels where it may be too dark due to low natural light or turbid water to see the way to the side of the hull. The bottom of the largest ships is mostly flat and featureless, exacerbating the problem, and as the plating is almost always steel, a magnetic compass is not reliable for navigation. Only surface-supplied diving is authorised for this work in most jurisdictions, as this not only secures the diver&#x27;s breathing gas supply, but also provides a guideline to the exit point. There is also a hazard of crushing if the clearance is small and the tide range is large.

==Sewer diving==
==Safety and risk management==
The main generic hazards of penetration diving are being unable to navigate back to the surface and running out of breathing gas before reaching the surface. Both of these hazards are well mitigated by the use of surface supplied breathing equipment, but at the cost of seriously reduced mobility and extremely restricted range, to the extent that some penetration activities are impossible on surface supply.

===Scuba diving===

For scuba diving, the risk of getting lost and running out of breathing gas is real and significant. These are the most common factors recorded in diving deaths in penetration diving. The use of a continuous guideline leading to open water is recognised as the most important safety precaution in any overhead environment with a real possibility of not being able to see the way out, along with sufficient emergency gas to compensate for any single catastrophic breathing gas supply failure at any time during the planned course of a penetration dive.

===Surface supplied diving===

Surface supplied diving reduces the risk of getting lost under an overhead, as the umbilical provides a reliable guideline back to the entry point, and a reliable source of breathing gas with a low risk of out of air incidents, but it can be cumbersome, only allows a limited penetration distance based on available umbilical length and the ability of the diver to drag it along and the ability of the tenders to drag it back during exit, and can become snagged on obstructions or diverted through line traps. It may need one or more in-water tenders or guide hoops to avoid these problems, and it may not be possible for the standby diver to reach the diver within an acceptable time in an emergency. Another possible problem is hydrodynamic drag in a current.

==Equipment==
All critical life-support equipment must be sufficiently redundant to allow escape in any reasonably foreseeable failure scenario.
==Skills, procedures, and training==
Skills and procedures have been developed for managing the hazards and foreseeable contingencies associated with different circumstances of penetration diving and the equipment suitable for use in each environment. These are generally learned in training for diving in those specific environments, but most are applicable across a range of environments with similar hazards.

<doc id="263274" wikidata="Q379200" url="?curid=263274" title="Manakin">
<text>The manakins are a family, Pipridae, of small suboscine passerine birds. The group contains 55 species distributed through the American tropics. The name is from Middle Dutch &quot;mannekijn&quot; &quot;little man&quot; (also the source of the different bird name &quot;mannikin&quot;).

==Description==
Manakins range in size from and in weight from . Species in the genus &quot;Tyranneutes&quot; are the smallest manakins, those in the genus &quot;Antilophia&quot; are believed to be the largest (since the genus &quot;Schiffornis&quot; are no longer considered manakins). They are compact stubby birds with short tails, broad and rounded wings, and big heads. The bill is short and has a wide gap. Females and first-year males have dull green plumage; most species are sexually dichromatic in their plumage, the males being mostly black with striking colours in patches, and in some species having long, decorative tail or crown feathers or erectile throat feathers. In some species, males from two to four years old have a distinctive subadult plumage.

The syrinx or &quot;voicebox&quot; is distinctive in manakins, setting them apart from the related families Cotingidae and Tyrannidae. Furthermore, it is so acutely variable within the group that genera and even species may be identified by the syrinx alone, unlike birds of most oscine families. The sounds made are whistles, trills, and buzzes.

==Distribution and habitat==
Manakins occur from southern Mexico to northern Argentina, Paraguay, and southern Brazil, and on Trinidad and Tobago as well. They are highly arboreal and are almost exclusively forest and woodland birds. Most species live in humid tropical lowlands, with a few in dry forests, river forests, and the subtropical Andes. Some highland species have altitudinal migrations.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Feeding===
Manakins feed in the understory on small fruit (but often remarkably large for the size of the bird) including berries, and to a lesser degree, insects. Since they take fruit in flight as other species &quot;hawk&quot; for insects, they are believed to have evolved from insect-eating birds. Females have big territories from which they do not necessarily exclude other birds of their species, instead feeding somewhat socially. Males spend much of their time together at courtship sites. Manakins sometimes join mixed feeding flocks.

===Reproduction===
Many manakin species have spectacular lekking courtship rituals, which are especially elaborate in the genera &quot;Pipra&quot; and &quot;Chiroxiphia&quot;. The rituals are characterized by a unique, species-specific pattern of vocalizations and movements such as jumping, bowing, wing vibration, wing snapping, and acrobatic flight. The members of the genera &quot;Machaeropterus&quot; and &quot;Manacus&quot; have heavily modified wing feathers, which they use to make buzzing and snapping sounds. Members of &quot;Manacus&quot; and &quot;Ceratopipra&quot; have superfast wing movements. The ability to produce these wing movements is supported by specialized peripheral androgen receptors in the muscular tissue.

Building of the nest (an open cup, generally low in vegetation), the incubation for 18 to 21 days, and care of the young for 13 to 15 days are undertaken by the female alone, since most manakins do not form stable pairs. (The helmeted manakin does form pairs, but the male&#x27;s contribution is limited to defending the territory.) The normal clutch is two eggs, which are buff or dull white, marked with brown.

Lekking polygyny seems to have been a characteristic of the family&#x27;s original ancestor, and the associated sexual selection led to an adaptive radiation in which relationships may be traced by similarities in displays. Manakin sexual displays within these leks among the ancestral subfamily Neopelminae are the most simple, while displays among the more evolutionarily recent subfamily Piprinae are the most complex. An evolutionary explanation connecting lekking to fruit-eating has been proposed.

== Species list==
The family Pipridae was introduced (as Pipraria) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. The members of the genus &quot;Schiffornis&quot; were previously placed in this family, but are now placed in Tityridae.

<text>A mooring is any permanent structure to which a seaborne vessel (such as a boat, ship, or amphibious aircraft) may be secured. Examples include quays, wharfs, jetties, piers, anchor buoys, and mooring buoys. A ship is secured to a mooring to forestall free movement of the ship on the water. An &quot;anchor mooring&quot; fixes a vessel&#x27;s position relative to a point on the bottom of a waterway without connecting the vessel to shore. As a verb, &quot;mooring&quot; refers to the act of attaching a vessel to a mooring.

The term likely stems from the Dutch verb &quot;meren&quot; (to &quot;moor&quot;), used in English since the end of the 15th century.

== Permanent anchor mooring ==

These moorings are used instead of temporary anchors because they have considerably more holding power. They cause lesser damage to the marine environment, and are convenient. Where there is a row of moorings they are termed a tier. They are also occasionally used to hold floating docks in place. There are several kinds of moorings:

=== Swing moorings ===
Swing moorings also known as simple or single-point moorings, are the simplest and most common kind of mooring. A swing mooring consists of a single anchor at the bottom of a waterway with a rode (a rope, cable, or chain) running to a float on the surface. The float allows a vessel to find the rode and connect to the anchor. These anchors are known as swing moorings because a vessel attached to this kind of mooring swings in a circle when the direction of wind or tide changes.

For a small boat (e.g. 22&#x27; / 6.7 m sailing yacht), this might consist of a heavy weight on the seabed, a 12 mm or 14 mm rising chain attached to the &quot;anchor&quot;, and a bridle made from 20 mm nylon rope, steel cable, or a 16 mm combination steel wire material. The heavy weight (anchor) should be a dense material. Old rail wagon wheels are used in some places (e.g. Clontarf, Dublin, Ireland) for this purpose. In some harbours (e.g. Dun Laoghaire, Ireland), very heavy chain (e.g. old ship anchor chain) may be placed in a grid pattern on the sea bed to ensure orderly positioning of moorings. Ropes (particularly for marker buoys and messenger lines) should be &quot;non floating&quot; to reduce likelihood of a boat&#x27;s propeller being fouled by one.

=== Pile moorings ===
Pile moorings are poles driven into the bottom of the waterway with their tops above the water. Vessels then tie mooring lines to two or four piles to fix their position between those piles. Pile moorings are common in New Zealand but rare elsewhere.

While many mooring buoys are privately owned, some are available for public use. For example, on the Great Barrier Reef off the Australian coast, a vast number of public moorings are set out in popular areas where boats can moor. This is to avoid the massive damage that would be caused by many vessels anchoring.
There are four basic types of permanent anchors used in moorings:

*Dead weights are the simplest type of anchor. They are generally made as a large concrete block with a rode attached which resists movement with sheer weight; and, to a small degree, by settling into the substrate. In New Zealand old railway wheels are sometimes used. The advantages are that they are simple and cheap. A dead weight mooring that drags in a storm still holds well in its new position. Such moorings are better suited to rocky bottoms where other mooring systems do not hold well. The disadvantages are that they are heavy, bulky, and awkward.
*Mushroom anchors are the most common anchors and work best for softer seabeds such as mud, sand, or silt. They are shaped like an upside-down mushroom which can be easily buried in mud or silt. The advantage is that it has up to ten times the holding-power-to-weight ratio compared to a dead weight mooring; disadvantages include high cost, limited success on rocky or pebbly substrates, and the long time it takes to reach full holding capacity.
*Pyramid anchors are pyramid-shaped anchors, also known as Dor-Mor anchors. They work in the upside-down position with the apex pointing down at the bottom such that when they are deployed, the weight of wider base pushes the pyramid down digging into the floor. Lateral pulls cause the side edges or corners of the pyramids to dig deeper under the floor, making them more stable.
*Screw-in moorings are a modern method. The anchor in a screw-in mooring is a shaft with wide blades spiraling around it so that it can be screwed into the substrate. The advantages include high holding-power-to-weight ratio and small size (and thus relative cheapness). The disadvantage is that a diver is usually needed to install, inspect, and maintain these moorings.
*Multiple anchor mooring systems use two or more (often three) light weight temporary-style anchors set in an equilateral arrangement and all chained to a common center from which a conventional rode extends to a mooring buoy. The advantages are minimized mass, ease of deployment, high holding-power-to-weight ratio, and availability of temporary-style anchors.

== Mooring to a shore fixture ==

A vessel can be made fast to any variety of shore fixtures from trees and rocks to specially constructed areas such as piers and quays. The word pier is used in the following explanation in a generic sense.

Mooring is often accomplished using thick ropes called &quot;mooring lines&quot; or &quot;hawsers&quot;. The lines are fixed to deck fittings on the vessel at one end and to fittings such as bollards, rings, and cleats on the other end.

Mooring requires cooperation between people on a pier and on a vessel. Heavy mooring lines are often passed from larger vessels to people on a mooring by smaller, weighted heaving lines. Once a mooring line is attached to a bollard, it is pulled tight. Large ships generally tighten their mooring lines using heavy machinery called &quot;mooring winches&quot; or &quot;capstans&quot;.
The heaviest cargo ships may require more than a dozen mooring lines. Small vessels can generally be moored by four to six mooring lines.

Mooring lines are usually made from manila rope or a synthetic material such as nylon. Nylon is easy to work with and lasts for years, but it is highly elastic. This elasticity has advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is that during an event, such as a high wind or the close passing of another ship, stress can be spread across several lines. However, should a highly stressed nylon line break, it may part catastrophically, causing &quot;snapback&quot;, which can fatally injure bystanders. The effect of &quot;snapback&quot; is analogous to stretching a rubber band to its breaking point between your hands and then suffering a stinging blow from its suddenly flexing broken ends. Such a blow from a heavy mooring line carries much more force and can inflict severe injuries or even sever limbs. Mooring lines made from materials such as Dyneema and Kevlar have much less elasticity and are therefore much safer to use. However, such lines do not float on water and they do tend to sink. In addition, they are relatively more expensive than other sorts of line.

Some ships use wire rope for one or more of their mooring lines. Wire rope is hard to handle and maintain. There is also risk associated with using wire rope on a ship&#x27;s stern in the vicinity of its propeller.

Mooring lines and hawsers may also be made by combining wire rope and synthetic line. Such lines are more elastic and easier to handle than wire rope, but they are not as elastic as pure synthetic line. Special safety precautions must be followed when constructing a combination mooring line.

The two-headed mooring bitts is a fitting often-used in mooring. The rope is hauled over the bitt, pulling the vessel toward the bitt. In the second step, the rope is tied to the bitt, as shown. This tie can be put and released very quickly. In quiet conditions, such as on a lake, one person can moor a 260-tonne ship in just a few minutes.

Quick release mooring hooks provide an alternative method of securing the rope to the quay: such a system &quot;greatly reduces the need for port staff to handle heavy mooring ropes … means staff have to spend less time on exposed areas of the dock, and [reduces] the risk of back injuries from heavy lifting&quot;. The Oil Companies International Marine Forum recommend the use of such hooks in oil and gas terminals.

The basic rode system is a line, cable, or chain several times longer than the depth of the water running from the anchor to the mooring buoy, the longer the rode is the shallower the angle of force on the anchor (it has more scope). A shallower scope means more of the force is pulling horizontally so that ploughing into the substrate adds holding power but also increases the swinging circle of each mooring, so lowering the density of any given mooring field. By adding weight to the bottom of the rode, such as the use of a length of heavy chain, the angle of force can be dropped further. Unfortunately, this scrapes up the substrate in a circular area around the anchor. A buoy can be added along the lower portion of rode to hold it off the bottom and avoid this issue.

=== Other types ===
Non-line mooring (&quot;hands-free&quot;) is used where pier time is highly valuable, and includes suction cups or magnets. It can also be used between ships.

=== Mediterranean mooring ===

Mediterranean mooring, also known as &quot;med mooring&quot; or &quot;Tahitian mooring&quot;, is a technique for mooring a vessel to pier. In a Mediterranean mooring the vessel sets a temporary anchor off the pier and then approaches the pier at a perpendicular angle. The vessel then runs two lines to the pier. Alternatively, simple moorings may be placed off the pier and vessels may tie to these instead of setting a temporary anchor. The advantage of Mediterranean mooring is that many more vessels can be connected to a fixed length of pier as they occupy only their width of pier rather than their length. The disadvantages of Mediterranean mooring are that it is more likely to result in collisions and that it is not practical in deep water or in regions with large tides.

=== Travelling/running mooring ===
A mooring used to secure a small boat (capable of being beached) at sea so that it is accessible at all tides. Making a Travelling Mooring involves (1) the sinking of a heavy weight to which a block (pulley wheel) is attached at a place where the sea is sufficiently deep at low tide, (2) fitting a block / pulley wheel to a rock or secure point above the high tide mark, and (3) running a heavy rope with marker buoy between these blocks.

Mooring involves (a) beaching the boat, (b) drawing in the mooring point on the line (where the marker buoy is located), (c) attaching to the mooring line to the boat, and (d) then pulling the boat out and away from the beach so that it can be accessed at all tides.

=== Canal mooring ===

A mooring used to secure a narrowboat (capable of traversing narrow UK canals and narrow locks) overnight, during off boat excursions or prolonged queuing for canal lock access. Water height with minimal exceptions, remain constant (not-tidal); there is water height variance in close proximity to locks.

Types of canal moorings:

Mooring pin (boat operator supplied) driven into the ground between the edge of the canal and the towpath with a mooring-line rope to the boat.

Mooring hook (boat operator supplied) placed on the (permanent) canal-side rail with either (boat operator supplied) rope or chain-and-rope to the boat.

Mooring ring (permanent) affixed between the edge of the canal and the tow path, with (boat operator supplied) rope to the boat.

Mooring bollard (permanent) affixed canal-side on lock-approaches for the short-term mooring of advancing boats and lock-side to assist in ascent and descent.

<text>Mboubène is a town in the lower delta of the Senegal River, near the mouth of the Marigot de Djeuss. The town is located on the main highway to the Maka-Diama Dam at a distance of from the coastal city of Saint-Louis, Senegal. On French and Dutch maps, the name of the town has been spelled variously, including &quot;MBoulene&quot; and &quot;Emboulan.&quot; It was called &quot;Biffeche-Ville&quot; during the period of the 1960s through the 1980s when it was inhabited by resettled members of the Sèrèer ethnic group. (The Sèrèers moved away to the nearby town of Savoigne.)

Today, Mboubène consists of two parts: Al Madinatoul Islamiah Mboubène Peulh inhabited by Fula people, and Mboubène Naar primarily inhabited by Moors. There is a Koranic school and general store at the former, and a royal residence at the latter.

The chief economic activities are animal husbandry and gardening. Nearby agricultural fields suffer from yearly flooding and salinity.

Mboubène-Peulh is governed by an appointed Chef de Village.

<doc id="263285" wikidata="Q816605" url="?curid=263285" title="Ben Stein">
<text>Benjamin Jeremy Stein (born November 25, 1944) is an American writer, lawyer, actor, comedian, and commentator on political and economic issues. He began his career as a speechwriter for U.S. presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford before entering the entertainment field as an actor, comedian, and game show host. He is best known on screen as the economics teacher in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, as the host of &quot;Win Ben Stein&#x27;s Money&quot;, and as Dr. Arthur Neuman in &quot;The Mask&quot; and &quot;Son of the Mask&quot;. Stein also co-wrote and starred in the controversial 2008 film&quot; &quot; which was widely criticized for promoting pseudoscientific intelligent design creationist claims of persecution. Stein is the son of economist and writer Herbert Stein, who worked at the White House under President Nixon. As a character actor he is well known for his droning, monotonous delivery. In comedy, he is known for his deadpan delivery.

== Early life and education ==
Stein was born on November 25, 1944 in Washington, D.C., the son of Jewish parents Mildred ( Fishman), a homemaker, and Herbert Stein, a writer, economist, and presidential adviser. He grew up in the Woodside Forest neighborhood of Silver Spring, Maryland. Stein graduated from Montgomery Blair High School in 1962 along with classmate journalist Carl Bernstein (class of 1960); actress Goldie Hawn (class of 1963) was one year behind. He went on to major in economics at Columbia University&#x27;s Columbia College, where he was a member of Alpha Delta Phi and the Philolexian Society. After graduating with honors from Columbia in 1966, Stein went to Yale Law School, graduating as valedictorian in June 1970.

== Career ==
=== Legal and academic career ===

He was first a poverty lawyer in New Haven, Connecticut, and Washington, D.C., before becoming a trial lawyer for the Federal Trade Commission.

Stein&#x27;s first teaching stint was as an adjunct professor, teaching about the political and social content of mass culture at American University in Washington, D.C. He subsequently taught classes at the University of California, Santa Cruz on political and civil rights under the United States Constitution. At Pepperdine University Stein taught libel law and United States securities law and its ethical aspects. He was a professor of law and economics at Pepperdine University Law School from about 1990 to 1997.

=== Writing career ===
Stein writes a regular column in the conservative media outlets &quot;The American Spectator&quot; and &quot;Newsmax&quot;. He has also written for numerous publications, including &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, &quot;Penthouse&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Barron&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. He wrote a regular biweekly column for &quot;Yahoo! Finance&quot; online, with his last article dated August 7, 2009. His bestselling books (with investment advisor Phil DeMuth) include &quot;Yes, You Can Retire Comfortably&quot;; &quot;Can America Survive?&quot;; and &quot;Yes, You Can Time the Market&quot;. In 2009, he published a collection of essays, &quot;The Real Stars&quot;.

Stein was fired from his position as a Sunday Business columnist at &quot;The New York Times&quot; in August 2009 owing to a policy prohibiting writers from making product endorsements or advertising. Stein had recently become an advertising spokesman for credit information company Freescore.com and, according to a &quot;Times&quot; statement, had assumed there would be no conflict provided that he did not discuss credit scoring in general or FreeScore.com itself in his column. However, the publication felt that it would be inappropriate for him to write for them while he was involved in advertising and terminated his contract. Writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Stein states his belief that the real reasons for his firing were budget cuts at the &quot;Times&quot;, his criticism of Obama, and pressure from those critical of &quot;Expelled&quot;, who &quot;bamboozled some of the high pooh-bahs at the &quot;Times&quot; into thinking there was a conflict of interest&quot;.

=== Political career ===

Stein began his political career as a speechwriter and lawyer for President Richard Nixon, and later for President Gerald Ford. On May 3, 1976, &quot;Time&quot; magazine speculated on the possibility of Stein having actually been Deep Throat. Stein responded over the years not only by denying he was Deep Throat but by going further and accusing journalist Bob Woodward of falsifying the famous secret source. In the May 14–21, 1998, edition of the &quot;Philadelphia City Paper&quot;, Stein is quoted as saying, &quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t think there was a Deep Throat. That was a fake. I think there were several different sources and some they just made up.&quot; After Mark Felt&#x27;s identity as Deep Throat was revealed, Stein stated that Nixon would have prevented the rise to power of the Khmer Rouge if he had not been forced to resign. For his actions leading to that resignation, Stein said:
In 2005, Stein said in the &quot;American Spectator&quot;:

=== Career in the media ===

Stein acted as the monotonous economics teacher in the 1986 movie &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. In one scene, he lectures on the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930 and the then-current debate over supply-side economics.

Stein played similarly bland and unemotional characters. He had a recurring role in the TV series &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; as science teacher Mr. Cantwell, who would narrate 16 mm films in monotone. Stein also played himself in &quot;Dave&quot;.

He appeared in several television advertisements, such as for Clear Eyes eye drops throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Godfather&#x27;s Pizza in 1987, a bland science teacher in 1990 for Sprinkled Chips Ahoy! cookies, and in 2013 for small business accounting service firm 1-800Accountant.

From 1997 to 2003, Stein hosted the Comedy Central game show &quot;Win Ben Stein&#x27;s Money&quot; along with co-host Jimmy Kimmel (replaced by Nancy Pimental and later by Sal Iacono). True to its name, the money that contestants won on the show was subtracted from the $5,000 pay that Stein earned per episode (in addition to his salary). The show won five Daytime Emmy Awards before ending its run in 2003.

In 1999, Stein also hosted the Comedy Central talk show &quot;Turn Ben Stein On&quot;. One of the mainstays of the show was Stein&#x27;s dog, Puppy Wuppy, who had free run of the set. In 2001, Stein appeared on a celebrity episode of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; entitled &quot;TV Hosts Edition&quot; alongside other television hosts and was voted off in round 6 despite being that round&#x27;s Strongest Link. Anne Robinson&#x27;s quip was that while he &quot;might win Ben&#x27;s money; you&#x27;re NOT taking ours!&quot;.

Other movies and television shows in which Stein has appeared include &quot;Charles in Charge&quot;; &quot;Seinfeld&quot;; &quot;Full House&quot;; &quot;Casper&quot;; &quot;&quot;; &quot;Casper Meets Wendy&quot;; &quot;The Mask&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Son of the Mask&quot; as well as the television show, &quot;The Mask: Animated Series&quot;; &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot;; &quot;Star Search&quot;; &quot;MacGyver&quot;; &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;; &quot;Richie Rich&quot;; &quot;Game Show Moments Gone Bananas&quot;; &quot;Cavuto on Business&quot;; &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;; &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;; &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot;; &quot;Family Guy&quot;; the 1998–2004 version of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;; the Michael Berger-hosted version of &quot;Match Game&quot;; &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;; &quot;Duckman&quot;; &quot;Married... with Children&quot;; &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New School&quot;; &quot;My Girl 2&quot;; &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;; and the intelligent design documentary &quot;&quot;.
In addition, Stein&#x27;s voice roles include The Pixies, magical creatures on the animated series &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;; Mr. Purutu on the animated series &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New School&quot;; Professor Wisenstein in &quot;Bruno the Kid&quot;; the birthday party clown, Mr. Giggles, on &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;; a bingo caller on &quot;Rugrats&quot;; Francis &quot;Pip&quot; Pumphandle in &quot;Animaniacs&quot;; and H.A. Futterman in &quot;Freakazoid!&quot;. Stein also voiced a psychiatrist, again named after himself, in the USA TV series &quot;Duckman&quot;; he once appeared in the sitcom &quot;Married... with Children&quot; as a receptionist in the animal afterlife. He also made a cameo appearance in the comic book &quot;Young Justice&quot;, as Ali Ben Styn. Another cameo appearance was as Rabbi Goldberg in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episodes &quot;When You Wish Upon a Weinstein&quot; and &quot;Family Goy&quot;. Stein also voiced the character Sam Schmaltz in the 1996 computer adventure game &quot;Toonstruck&quot;.

Stein has written for the television industry, including outlines for the TV movie &quot;Murder in Mississippi&quot; and for the lengthy ABC miniseries &quot;Amerika&quot;. He has also contributed to the creation of the talk show parody series &quot;Fernwood 2 Night&quot;.

Stein hosted a show on VH1 called &quot;America&#x27;s Most Smartest Model&quot;. The show aimed to find the smartest among 14 models through a series of challenges.

On May 14, 2006, during an appearance on the Fox News program &quot;Your World with Neil Cavuto&quot;, Stein called for a tax increase of 3.5% for wealthy Americans, to be earmarked for soldiers and military initiatives. Stein wrote an editorial for &quot;The New York Times&quot; critical of those who would rather make money in the world of finance than fight terrorism.

On December 28, 2009, Stein appeared on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot; with Ron Paul to discuss the attempted bombing of an American plane on Christmas Day 2009. Stein said that Paul&#x27;s stance that the United States were &quot;occupiers&quot; in Iraq and Afghanistan was antisemitic. The comment started a shouting match between the two men. Two days later, Stein clarified that &quot;if Rep. Paul says he is... not an anti-Semite, I believe him&quot;.

Stein&#x27;s political and economics commentary has appeared on CNBC&#x27;s &quot;The Kudlow Report&quot; and CNN.

=== Commentary in the lead-up to and during the Great Recession ===
In the months before the late-2000s recession, Stein made frequent and vehement claims about the economy&#x27;s good health and the relative unimportance of the mortgage-derivative market; these would shortly be proven dead wrong.

Examples include:

* On March 18, 2007, as the subprime mortgage crisis began, Stein wrote a column for the online version of &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning.&quot; He proclaimed that the foreclosure problem would &quot;blow over and the people who buy now, in due time, will be glad they did,&quot; that the economy was &quot;still very strong,&quot; and that the &quot;smart money&quot; was &quot;now trying to buy—not sell—as much distressed merchandise&quot; in mortgages as possible.
* In an August 12, 2007, column in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, titled &quot;Chicken Little&#x27;s Brethren, on the Trading Floor&quot;, Stein—while acknowledged that &quot;I don&#x27;t know where the bottom is on subprime. I don&#x27;t know how bad the problems are at Bear [Bear Stearns]&quot;—claimed that &quot;subprime losses are wildly out of all proportion to the likely damage to the economy from the subprime problems,&quot; and &quot;[t]his economy is extremely strong. Profits are superb. The world economy is exploding with growth. To be sure, terrible problems lurk in the future: a slow-motion dollar crisis, huge Medicare deficits and energy shortages. But for now, the sell-off seems extreme, not to say nutty. Some smart, brave people will make a fortune buying in these days, and then we&#x27;ll all wonder what the scare was about.&quot;
* On August 18, 2007, on Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;Cavuto on Business&quot;, Stein and other financial experts dismissed worries about a coming credit crunch. Thirteen months later, in the global financial crisis in September 2008, global stock markets crashed, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taken over by the US government, AIG was bailed out by the Federal Reserve, Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America Corporation, and Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs confirmed that they would become traditional bank holding companies.

In January 2008, business commentator Henry Blodget wrote a piece for &quot;Business Insider&quot; entitled, &quot;Ben Stein is an Idiot&quot;, which stated that Stein&#x27;s criticism of those with bearish views and positions on the market was either &quot;delusional&quot; or a deliberate and &quot;shrewd&quot; attempt to create false controversy and increase web traffic.

In a Yahoo! Finance article published on October 17, 2008, Stein said his wildly incorrect claims were due to his expectations that the real-estate market would roughly resemble the collapse of junk bonds in the early 1990s. He said he failed to understand that debt obligations based on real estate loans were less than the &quot;staggeringly large&quot; amount of obligations that were created through trading in derivatives of those: &quot;Where I missed the boat was not realizing how large were the CDS [credit default swaps] based on the junk mortgage bonds.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Stein is married to entertainment lawyer Alexandra Denman. They were married in 1968 and divorced in 1974. They reconciled and in 1977 they were married again. Stein lives with Denman in Beverly Hills and Malibu, California. He also has a summer home in Sandpoint, Idaho, and an apartment in the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., which he inherited from his parents. 

In 2014, performance artist Tanya Ma claimed that a financial arrangement between her and Stein had turned inappropriate. Stein said of the incident that he only expected &quot;hugging and kissing&quot; and that he often gets &quot;mad crushes&quot; on women that &quot;last about ten minutes.&quot;

== Views and advocacy ==

=== Abortion ===
Stein is a supporter of the criminalization of abortion and was given an anti-abortion award in 2003 by the National Right to Life Educational Trust Fund.

=== Larry Craig scandal ===

In 2007, Stein chastised the police and the GOP leadership for their response to the Larry Craig scandal. Stein said that Craig&#x27;s sexuality should not be an issue: &quot;A party that believes in individual rights should be rallying to his defense, not making him walk the plank.&quot;

=== Tax code ===
Stein has criticized the United States Internal Revenue Code for being too lenient on the wealthy. He has repeated the observation made by Warren Buffett, one of the richest individuals in the world (who pays mostly capital gains tax), that Buffett pays a lower overall tax rate than his secretaries (who pay income taxes and payroll taxes). Stein has advocated increasing taxation on the wealthy. Stein objected to Obama&#x27;s proposal in 2010 not to extend tax cuts for the highest earning taxpayers in the midst of the recession, saying that:

In 2012, Stein stated that due to the tremendous amount of national debt, he agreed with Obama&#x27;s proposal to increase taxes on the wealthy and that ultimately everyone&#x27;s taxes should be raised to avoid defaulting on the debt.

=== Dominique Strauss-Kahn ===
When the head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, was arrested for sexual assault and attempted rape in 2011, Stein published an editorial in &quot;The American Spectator&quot; in which he closely scrutinized Strauss-Kahn&#x27;s accuser and cited Strauss-Kahn&#x27;s education, wealth, and position as reasons to believe he was unlikely to have committed the crime:
Stein&#x27;s editorial was criticized by a number of media outlets. Jon Stewart dedicated an entire segment on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; to his response. All charges against Dominique Strauss-Kahn were formally dismissed by a judge on 23 August 2011.

=== Ferguson shooting ===
In response to the death of Michael Brown, Stein made the following comment:
=== Evolution ===

Stein has denounced the scientific theory of evolution, which he and other intelligent design advocates call &quot;Darwinism&quot;, declaring it to be &quot;a painful, bloody chapter in the history of ideologies&quot;, &quot;the most compelling argument yet for Imperialism&quot;, and the inspiration for the Holocaust. Stein does not say belief in evolution alone leads to genocide, but that scientific materialism is a necessary component. He co-wrote and stars in &quot;&quot;, a film that aims to persuade viewers that evolution was instrumental to the rise of the eugenics movement, Nazi Germany, and the Holocaust, and portrays advocates of intelligent design as victims of intellectual discrimination by the scientific community, which has rejected intelligent design as creationist pseudoscience. In the trailer for the film, Stein said that his aim was to expose &quot;people out there who want to keep science in a little box where it can&#x27;t possibly touch God.&quot;

Many critics point out that Stein selectively used and edited quotes by Charles Darwin to make his case in &quot;Expelled&quot;, also noting that scenes shot at Pepperdine University, in which Stein gives a speech to an auditorium full of students, in fact used a large number of extras, hired to respond favorably to Stein&#x27;s speech, to fill the room.
The media response to the film has been largely unfavorable. It received an 11% meta-score from Rotten Tomatoes. Multiple reviews, including those of &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;Scientific American&quot;, have described the film as propaganda.

In a Trinity Broadcasting Network interview with Paul Crouch Jr. regarding the movie, Stein claimed that &quot;[religion] leads you to a very glorious place, and science leads you to killing people&quot;.

The Anti-Defamation League issued a statement condemning the film&#x27;s misuse of the Holocaust and its imagery, &quot;Using the Holocaust in order to tarnish those who promote the theory of evolution is outrageous and trivializes the complex factors that led to the mass extermination of European Jewry&quot;.

At the University of Vermont, Stein was invited to receive an honorary degree and be the commencement speaker for the graduating class of 2009. University President Dan Fogel received complaints about Stein&#x27;s planned appearance, due to Stein&#x27;s views on evolution. Stein declined his commencement invitation.

At the private, Christian Liberty University 2009 graduation, Stein was awarded an honorary degree and, according to the university, &quot;spoke extensively about his work on &quot;Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed&quot;&quot;.

=== Foreign policy ===
Stein is a staunch supporter of Israel. On &quot;Larry King Live&quot; in 2009, in a heated exchange with then-Congressman Ron Paul, he referred to Paul as antisemitic for referring to the U.S. as &quot;occupiers&quot; in the Arabian peninsula.

=== Political endorsements ===
Stein endorsed John McCain for president in 2008, calling him &quot;an impressive guy&quot;. That year, he also stated that he would vote for Ralph Nader. In January 2012, Stein appeared in political advertisements sponsored by Associated Industries of Florida supporting legislation that would create three resort casinos in South Florida. He claimed in late 2014 that President Barack Obama was the most racist president in American history, saying Obama &quot;made everything about race&quot;.

In 2016, Stein reprised the famous attendance scene from &quot;Ferris Bueller&quot; in a campaign ad for Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley. In it, Stein intoned the last name of Grassley&#x27;s opponent (Patty Judge) to silence, while facts about her missed votes and absences from state board meetings were listed. Stein then calls out &quot;Grassley,&quot; which gets a response; Stein mutters, &quot;He&#x27;s always here.&quot;

Stein initially supported Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, but retracted his support in October 2016, writing, &quot;But it&#x27;s time for Donald Trump to go back to Trump Tower. Time for Mike Pence to move to the top of the ticket.&quot; However, Stein went on to vote for Trump.

=== Aunt Jemima ===
In February 2023, Stein released a video on Donald Trump&#x27;s Truth Social stating he missed the Aunt Jemima logo with a &quot;large African American woman chef.&quot; He added, &quot;But, I prefer when it was a black person, showing their incredible skill at making pancakes.&quot; The video was also shared on Twitter and the story ran on media outlets across the country.

The original Aunt Jemima logo and brand name was retired in 2021 by PepsiCo and its subsidiary, Quaker Oats. This was due to the connection with the &quot;Mammy&quot; stereotype and racial connotations associated with the character.

<text>The antbirds are a large passerine bird family, Thamnophilidae, found across subtropical and tropical Central and South America, from Mexico to Argentina. There are more than 230 species, known variously as antshrikes, antwrens, antvireos, fire-eyes, bare-eyes and bushbirds. They are related to the antthrushes and antpittas (family Formicariidae), the tapaculos, the gnateaters and the ovenbirds. Despite some species&#x27; common names, this family is not closely related to the wrens, vireos or shrikes.

Antbirds are generally small birds with rounded wings and strong legs. They have mostly sombre grey, white, brown and rufous plumage, which is sexually dimorphic in pattern and colouring. Some species communicate warnings to rivals by exposing white feather patches on their backs or shoulders. Most have heavy bills, which in many species are hooked at the tip.

Most species live in forests, although a few are found in other habitats. Insects and other arthropods form the most important part of their diet, although small vertebrates are occasionally taken. Most species feed in the understory and midstory of the forest, although a few feed in the canopy and a few on the ground. Many join mixed-species feeding flocks, and a few species are core members. To various degrees, around eighteen species specialise in following swarms of army ants to eat the small invertebrates flushed by the ants, and many others may feed in this way opportunistically.

Antbirds are monogamous, mate for life, and defend territories. They usually lay two eggs in a nest that is either suspended from branches or supported on a branch, stump, or mound on the ground. Both parents share the tasks of incubation and of brooding and feeding the nestlings. After fledging, each parent cares exclusively for one chick.

Thirty-eight species are threatened with extinction as a result of human activities. Antbirds are not targeted by either hunters or the pet trade. The principal threat is habitat loss, which causes habitat fragmentation and increased nest predation in habitat fragments.

== Systematics ==

The antbird family Thamnophilidae used to be considered a subfamily, Thamnophilinae, within a larger family Formicariidae that included antthrushes and antpittas. Formerly, that larger family was known as the &quot;antbird family&quot; and the Thamnophilinae were &quot;typical antbirds&quot;. In this article, &quot;antbird&quot; and &quot;antbird family&quot; refer to the family Thamnophilidae.

Thamnophilidae was removed from Formicariidae, leaving behind the antthrushes and antpittas, due to recognition of differences in the structure of the breastbone (sternum) and syrinx, and Sibley and Ahlquist&#x27;s examination of DNA–DNA hybridization. The Thamnophilidae antbirds are members of the infraorder Tyrannides (or tracheophone suboscines), one of two infraorders in the suborder Tyranni. The Thamnophilidae are now thought to occupy a fairly basal position within the infraorder, i. e. with regard to their relatives the antthrushes and antpittas, tapaculos, gnateaters, and also the ovenbirds. The sister group of the Thamnophilidae is thought to be the gnateaters. The ovenbirds, tapaculos, antthrushes and antpittas are thought to represent a different radiation of that early split.

The antbird family contains over 230 species, variously called antwrens, antvireos, antbirds and antshrikes. The names refer to the relative sizes of the birds (increasing in the order given, though with exceptions) rather than any particular resemblance to the true wrens, vireos or shrikes. In addition, members of the genus &quot;Phlegopsis&quot; are known as bare-eyes, &quot;Pyriglena&quot; as fire-eyes and &quot;Neoctantes&quot; and &quot;Clytoctantes&quot; as bushbirds. Although the systematics of the Thamnophilidae is based on studies from the mid-19th century, when fewer than half the present species were known, comparison of the myoglobin intron 2, GAPDH intron 11 and the mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; DNA sequences has largely confirmed it. There are two major clades – most antshrikes and other larger, strong-billed species as well as &quot;Herpsilochmus&quot;, versus the classical antwrens and other more slender, longer-billed species – and the monophyly of most genera was confirmed.

The Thamnophilidae contains several large or very large genera and numerous small or monotypic ones. Several, which are difficult to assign, seem to form a third, hitherto unrecognised clade independently derived from ancestral antbirds. The results also confirmed suspicions of previous researchers that some species, most notably in &quot;Myrmotherula&quot; and &quot;Myrmeciza&quot;, need to be assigned to other genera. Still, due to the difficulties of sampling from such a large number of often poorly known species, the assignment of some genera is still awaiting confirmation.

== Morphology ==
The antbirds are a group of small to medium-sized passerines that range in size from the large giant antshrike, which measures 45 cm (18 in) and weighs 150  g (5.29  oz), to the tiny 8-cm (3 in) pygmy antwren, which weighs 7  g (0.25 oz). In general terms, &quot;antshrikes&quot; are relatively large-bodied birds, &quot;antvireos&quot; are medium-sized and chunky, while &quot;antwrens&quot; include most smaller species; &quot;antbird&quot; genera can vary greatly in size. Members of this family have short rounded wings that provide good manoeuvrability when flying in dense undergrowth. The legs are large and strong, particularly in species that are obligate ant-followers. These species are well adapted to gripping vertical stems and saplings, which are more common than horizontal branches in the undergrowth, and thus the ability to grip them is an advantage for birds following swarms of army ants. The claws of these antbirds are longer than those of species that do not follow ants, and the soles of some species have projections that are tough and gripping when the foot is clenched. Tarsus length in antbirds is related to foraging strategy. Longer tarsi typically occur in genera such as the &quot;Thamnophilus&quot; antshrikes that forage by perch-gleaning (sitting and leaning forward to snatch insects from the branch), whereas shorter tarsi typically occur in those that catch prey on the wing, such as the &quot;Thamnomanes&quot; antshrikes.

Most antbirds have proportionately large, heavy bills. Several genera of antshrike have a strongly hooked tip to the bill, and all antbirds have a notch or &#x27;tooth&#x27; at the tip of the bill which helps in holding and crushing insect prey. The two genera of bushbirds have upturned chisel-like bills.

The plumage of antbirds is soft and not brightly coloured, although it is occasionally striking. The colour palette of most species is blackish shades, whitish shades, rufous, chestnut and brown. Plumages can be uniform in colour or patterned with barring or spots. Sexual dimorphism – differences in plumage colour and pattern between males and females – is common in the family. Overall the pattern within the family is for the males to have combinations of grey, black or white plumage and the females having buff, rufous and brown colours. For example, the male dot-winged antwren is primarily blackish, whereas the female has rust-coloured underparts. In some genera, such as &quot;Myrmotherula&quot;, species are better distinguished by female plumage than by male. Many species of antbirds have a contrasting &#x27;patch&#x27; of white (sometimes other colours) feathers on the back (known as interscapular patches), shoulder or underwing. This is usually concealed by the darker feathers on the back but when the bird is excited or alarmed these feathers can be raised to flash the white patch. dot-winged antwrens puff out white back patches, whereas in bluish-slate antshrikes and white-flanked antwrens the white patch is on the shoulder.

=== Voice ===
The songs and calls of antbirds are generally composed of repeated simple uncomplicated notes. The family is one of the suboscines (suborder Tyranni) which have simpler syrinxes (&quot;voiceboxes&quot;) than other songbirds. Nevertheless, their songs are distinctive and species-specific, allowing field identification by ear. Antbirds rely on their calls for communication, as is typical of birds in dark forests. Most species have at least two types of call, the &quot;loudsong&quot; and the &quot;softsong&quot;. The functions of many calls have been deduced from their context; for example some loudsongs have a territorial purpose and are given when birds meet at the edges of their territories, or during the morning rounds of the territory. Pairs in neighbouring territories judge the proximity of rivals by the degradation of the song caused by interference by the environment. In bouts of territorial defence the male will face off with the other male and the female with her counterpart. Loudsong duets are also potentially related to the maintenance of pair bonds. The functions of softsongs are more complex, and possibly related to pair-bond maintenance. In addition to these two main calls a range of other sounds are made; these include scolding in mobbing of predators. The calls of antbirds are also used interspecifically. Some species of antbirds and even other birds will actively seek out ant-swarms using the calls of some species of ant-followers as clues.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The distribution of the antbirds is entirely Neotropical, with the vast majority of the species being found in the tropics. A few species reach southern Mexico and northern Argentina. Some species, such as the barred antshrike, have a continental distribution that spans most of the South and Middle American distribution of the family; others, such as the ash-throated antwren, have a tiny distribution.

Antbirds are mostly birds of humid lowland rainforests. Few species are found at higher elevations, with less than 10% of species having ranges above 2000  m (6500 ft) and almost none with ranges above 3000  m (10000 ft). The highest species diversity is found in the Amazon basin, with up to 45 species being found in single locations in sites across Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. The number of species drops dramatically towards the further reaches of the family&#x27;s range; there are only seven species in Mexico, for example. Areas of lower thamnophilid diversity may contain localised endemics, however. The Yapacana antbird, for example, is restricted to the stunted woodlands that grow in areas of nutrient-poor white-sand soil (the so-called Amazonian caatinga) in Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia. Some species are predominantly associated with microhabitats within a greater ecosystem; for example, the bamboo antshrike is predominantly found in bamboo patches.

Genetic comparison of the whole genomes of higher and lower-humidity antbirds have shown some differences in genes linked to water balance and temperature regulation. More significantly, antbirds differ in the regions of the genome that regulate gene activity, suggesting that differences for antbirds are a result less of the genes themselves than of how they are deployed.

== Behaviour ==

Antbirds are diurnal: they feed, breed and defend territories during the day. Many of the family are, however, reluctant to enter areas of direct sunlight where it breaks through the forest canopy. Antbirds will engage in anting, a behaviour in which ants (or other arthropods) are rubbed on the feathers before being discarded or eaten. While this has conventionally been considered a way to remove and control feather parasites, it has been suggested that for antbirds it may simply be a way to deal with the distasteful substances in prey items.

=== Feeding ===
The main component of the diet of all antbirds is arthropods. These are mostly insects, including grasshoppers and crickets, cockroaches, praying mantises, stick insects and the larvae of butterflies and moths. In addition antbirds often take spiders, scorpions and centipedes. They swallow smaller prey items quickly, whereas they often beat larger items against branches in order to remove wings and spines. Larger species can kill and consume frogs and lizards as well, but generally these do not form an important part of the diet of this family. Other food items may also be eaten, including fruit, eggs and slugs.

The family uses a number of techniques to obtain prey. The majority of antbirds are arboreal, with most of those feeding in the understory, many in the middle story and some in the canopy. A few species feed in the leaf litter; for example, the wing-banded antbird forages in areas of dense leaf-litter. It does not use its feet to scratch the leaf litter, as do some other birds; instead it uses its long bill to turn over leaves rapidly (never picking them up). The antbirds that forage arboreally show a number of techniques and specialisations. Some species perch-glean, perching on a branch watching for prey and snatching it by reaching forward, where others sally from a perch and snatch prey on the wing. In both cases birds will hop through the foliage or undergrowth and pause, scanning for prey, before pouncing or moving on. The time paused varies, although smaller species tend to be more active and pause for shorter times.

==== Mixed-species feeding flocks ====
Many species participate in mixed-species feeding flocks, forming a large percentage of the participating species within their range. Some of these are core or &quot;nuclear species&quot;. These nuclear species share territories with other nuclear species but exclude conspecifics (members of the same species) and are found in almost all flocks; these are joined by &quot;attendant species&quot;. Loud and distinctive calls and conspicuous plumage are important attributes of nuclear species as they promote cohesion in the flock. The composition of these flocks varies geographically; in Amazonia species of &quot;Thamnomanes&quot; antshrike are the leading nuclear species; elsewhere other species, such as the dot-winged antwrens and checker-throated stipplethroats, fill this role. Other species of antwren and antbird join them along with woodcreepers, ant-tanagers, foliage-gleaners and greenlets. The benefits of the mixed flock are thought to be related to predation, since many eyes are better for spotting predatory hawks and falcons. Comparisons between multi-species feeding flocks in different parts of the world found that instances of flocking were positively correlated with predation risk by raptors. For example, where &quot;Thamnomanes&quot; antshrikes lead the group they give loud warning calls in the presence of predators. These calls are understood and reacted to by all the other species in the flock. The advantage to the &quot;Thamnomanes&quot; antshrikes is in allowing the rest of the flock, which are typically gleaners, to act as beaters, flushing prey while foraging which the antshrikes can obtain by sallying. Similar roles are filled in other flocks by other antbird species or other bird families, for example the shrike-tanagers. Within the feeding flocks competition is reduced by microniche partitioning; where dot-winged antwrens, checker-throated stipplethroats and white-flanked antwrens feed in flocks together, the dot-wings feed in the densest vines, the white-flank in less dense vegetation, and the checker-throats in the same density as the latter but in dead foliage only.

Swarms of army ants are an important resource used by some species of antbird, and the one from which the family&#x27;s common name is derived. Many species of tropical ant form large raiding swarms, but the swarms are often nocturnal or raid underground. While birds visit these swarms when they occur, the species most commonly attended by birds is the Neotropical species &quot;Eciton burchellii&quot;, which is both diurnal and surface-raiding. It was once thought that attending birds were actually eating the ants, but numerous studies in various parts of &quot;Eciton burchellii&#x27;s&quot; range has shown that the ants act as beaters, flushing insects, other arthropods and small vertebrates into the waiting flocks of &quot;ant followers&quot;. The improvement in foraging efficiency can be dramatic; a study of spotted antbirds found that they made attempts at prey every 111.8 seconds away from ants, but at swarms they made attempts every 32.3 seconds. While many species of antbirds (and other families) may opportunistically feed at army ant swarms, 18 species of antbird are obligate ant-followers, obtaining most of their diet from swarms. With only three exceptions, these species never regularly forage away from ant swarms. A further four species regularly attend swarms but are as often seen away from them. Obligate ant-followers visit the nesting bivouacs of army ants in the morning to check for raiding activities; other species do not. These species tend to arrive at swarms first, and their calls are used by other species to locate swarming ants.

Because army ants are unpredictable in their movements, it is impractical for obligate ant-followers to maintain a territory that always contains swarms to feed around. Antbirds have evolved a more complicated system than the strict territoriality of most other birds. They generally (details vary among species) maintain breeding territories but travel outside those territories in order to feed at swarms. Several pairs of the same species may attend a swarm, with the dominant pair at the swarm being the pair which holds the territory that the swarm is in. In addition to competition within species, competition among species exists, and larger species are dominant. In its range, the ocellated antbird is the largest of the obligate ant-following antbirds and is dominant over other members of the family, although it is subordinate to various species from other families (including certain woodcreepers, motmots and the rufous-vented ground cuckoo). At a swarm, the dominant species occupies positions above the central front of the swarm, which yields the largest amount of prey. Smaller, less dominant species locate themselves further away from the centre, or higher above the location of the dominant species, where prey is less plentiful.

=== Breeding ===

Antbirds are monogamous, in almost all cases forming pair bonds that last the life of the pair. Studies of the dusky antbird and the white-bellied antbird did not find &quot;infidelity&quot;. In the white-plumed antbird, divorces between pairs are common, but, as far as known, this species is exceptional. In most species the pair defends a classic territory, although the nesting territories of ant followers are slightly different (see feeding above). Territories vary in size from as small as 0.5 ha for the Manu antbird, to 1500  m (5000 ft) in diameter for the ocellated antbird. Ocellated antbirds have an unusual social system where the breeding pair forms the nucleus of a group or clan that includes their male offspring and their mates. These clans, which can number up to eight birds, work together to defend territories against rivals. Pair bonds are formed with courtship feeding, where the male presents food items to the female. In spotted antbirds males may actually feed females sufficiently for the female to cease feeding herself, although she will resume feeding once copulation has occurred. Mutual grooming also plays a role in courtship in some species.
The nesting and breeding biology of antbirds have not been well studied. Even in relatively well-known species the breeding behaviour can be poorly known; for example the nest of the ocellated antbird was first described in 2004. Nests are constructed by both parents, although the male undertakes more of the work in some species. Antbird nests are cups of vegetation such as twigs, dead leaves and plant fibre, and they follow two basic patterns: either suspended or supported. Suspended cups, which may hang from forks in branches, or between two branches, are the more common style of nest. Supported nests rest upon branches, amongst vines, in hollows, and sometimes on mounds of vegetation on the ground. Each species nests at the level where it forages, so a midstory species would build its nest in the midstory. Closely related species nest in the same ways. For example, antvireos in the genus &quot;Dysithamnus&quot; are all suspension nesters.
Almost all antbirds lay two eggs. A few species of antshrike lay three eggs, and a smaller number of antbirds lay one egg, but this is unusual. Small clutch sizes are typical of tropical birds compared to more temperate species of the same size, possibly due to nest predation, although this is disputed. Both parents participate in incubation, although only the female incubates at night. The length of time taken for chicks to hatch is 14–16 days in most species, although some, such as the dusky antbird, can take as long as 20 days. The altricial chicks are born naked and blind. Both parents brood the young until they are able to thermoregulate, although, as with incubation, only the female broods at night. In common with many songbirds, the parents take faecal sacs for disposal away from the nest. Both parents feed the chicks, often bringing large prey items. When the chicks reach fledging age, after 8–15 days, attending parents call their chicks. As each chick leaves the nest it is cared for exclusively from then on by the parent that was present then. After the first chick fledges and leaves with a parent the remaining parent may increase the supply of food to speed up the process of fledging. After fledging, chicks spend the first few days well hidden as the parents bring them food. Chicks of some species may not become independent of the parents for as long as four months in some antwrens, but two months is more typical for the rest of the family.

== Ecology ==

Antbirds are common components of the avifauna of some parts of the Neotropics and are thought to be important in some ecological processes. They are preyed upon by birds of prey, and their tendency to join flocks is thought to provide protection against such predation. The greater round-eared bat preys on some antbird species, such as the white-bibbed antbird and the scaled antbird; the latter is the bat&#x27;s preferred prey. Nests, including incubating adults, chicks and eggs, are vulnerable to predators, particularly snakes but also nocturnal mammals. Nesting success is low for many species, particularly in areas of fragmented habitat.

It was once suggested that the relationship between the obligate and regular ant-followers and the army ants, particularly &quot;Eciton burchellii&quot;, was mutualistic, with the ants benefiting by having the birds chase prey back down towards them. However, experiments where ant followers were excluded have shown that the foraging success of the army ants was 30% lower when the birds were present, suggesting that the birds&#x27; relationship was in fact parasitic. This has resulted in a number of behaviours by the ants in order to reduce kleptoparasitism, including hiding of secured prey in the leaf litter and caching of food on trails. It has been suggested that the depressive effect of this parasitism slows the development of &quot;E. burchellii&quot; swarms and in turn benefits other ant species which are preyed upon by army ants. The ant-following antbirds are themselves followed by three species of butterfly in the family Ithomiinae which feed on their droppings. Bird droppings are usually an unpredictable resource in a rainforest, but the regular behaviour of ant followers makes the exploitation of this resource possible.

== Status and conservation ==
As of April 2008, 38 species are considered by the IUCN to be near threatened or worse and therefore at risk of extinction. Antbirds are neither targeted by the pet trade nor large enough to be hunted; the principal cause of the decline in antbird species is habitat loss. The destruction or modification of forests has several effects on different species of antbirds. The fragmentation of forests into smaller patches affects species that are averse to crossing gaps as small as roads. If these species become locally extinct in a fragment, this reluctance to cross unforested barriers makes their re-establishment unlikely. Smaller forest fragments are unable to sustain mixed-species feeding flocks, leading to local extinctions. Another risk faced by antbirds in fragmented habitat is increased nest predation. An unplanned experiment in fragmentation occurred on Barro Colorado Island, a former hill in Panama that became an isolated island during the flooding caused by the creation of the Panama Canal. Numerous species of antbird formerly resident in the area were extirpated, in no small part due to increased levels of nest predation on the island. While the species lost from Barro Colorado are not globally threatened, they illustrate the vulnerability of species in fragmented habitats and help explain the declines of some species. The majority of threatened species have very small natural ranges. Some are also extremely poorly known; for example the Rio de Janeiro antwren is known only from a single specimen collected in 1982, although there have been unconfirmed reports since 1994 and it is currently listed as critically endangered. Additionally, new species are discovered at regular intervals; the Caatinga antwren was described in 2000, the acre antshrike in 2004, the sincorá antwren in 2007, and the description of a relative of the Paraná antwren discovered in 2005 in the outskirts of São Paulo is being prepared. While not yet scientifically described, conservation efforts have already been necessary, as the site of discovery was set out to be flooded to form a reservoir. Consequently, 72 individuals were captured and transferred to another locality.

<text>The Fennoman movement or Fennomania was a Finnish nationalist movement in the 19th-century Grand Duchy of Finland, built on the work of the &quot;fennophile&quot; interests of the 18th and early-19th centuries.

==History==

After the Crimean War, Fennomans founded the Finnish Party and intensified the language strife, yearning to raise the Finnish language and Finnic culture from peasant status to the position of a national language and a national culture. The opposition, the Svecomans, tried to defend the status of Swedish and the ties to the Germanic world.

Although the notion of &quot;Fennomans&quot; was not as common after the generation of Juho Kusti Paasikivi (born 1870), their ideas have dominated the Finns&#x27; understanding of their nation.

The mother tongue of many of the first generation of Fennomans, like Johan Vilhelm Snellman, was Swedish. Some of the originally Swedish-speaking Fennomans learned Finnish, and made a point of using it inside and outside the home.

Several Fennomans were from Finnish or bilingual homes. Some originally had Swedish surnames, common in Finland at that time.

Most of the Fennomans also Finnicized their family names, particularly from the end of the 19th century.

In the last years of the 19th century, and in the first years of the 20th, the Fennoman movement split into two political parties: the Old Finnish Party and the Young Finnish Party.

== Motto ==
The Fennoman motto attributed to Adolf Ivar Arwidsson was actually coined by Johan Vilhelm Snellman:
&quot;Svenskar äro vi icke, ryssar vilja vi icke bli, låt oss alltså vara finnar.&quot;
:&quot;&quot;We are not Swedes,&quot; 
:&quot;We do not want to be Russians,&quot;
:&quot;So let us be Finns.&quot;&quot;

<text>Murder at Midnight is an old-time radio show featuring macabre tales of suspense, often with a supernatural twist. It was produced in New York and was syndicated beginning in 1946. The show&#x27;s writers included Robert Newman, Joseph Ruscoll, Max Ehrlich, and William Morwood, and it was directed by Anton M. Leader. The producer was Louis G. Cowan. The host was Raymond Morgan, who delivered the lines of introduction over Charles Paul&#x27;s organ theme: &quot;Midnight, the witching hour when the night is darkest, our fears the strongest, and our strength at its lowest ebb. Midnight, when the graves gape open and death &quot;strikes&quot;.&quot;

A total of 50 episodes were produced. Ten shows were syndicated and rerun on Mutual in 1950.
==Critical response==
A review in the trade publication &quot;Variety&quot; called &quot;Murder at Midnight&quot; &quot;just another routine chiller series&quot;, comparing its writing to horror films from 10 years earlier. It described the acting as &quot;fairly good&quot; and found the direction to be &quot;mechanical rather than imaginative&quot;.

<doc id="263302" wikidata="Q7679320" url="?curid=263302" title="Tales of Fatima">
<text>Tales of Fatima is an old-time radio transcribed show that was broadcast on CBS from January 8, 1949, to October 1, 1949.

Basil Rathbone starred as himself in the program, with Francis DeSales portraying Lieutenant Farrell and Agnes Young portraying Lavender, Rathbone&#x27;s assistant and wardrobe woman. Princess Fatima was a &quot;sultry woman&quot; who inspired Rathbone as she spoke to him in dreams. At the beginning of each episode, Princess Fatima (in a voice that was altered by an echo chamber) gave the audience an &quot;obscure tidbit&quot; as a clue to help listeners solve that night&#x27;s mystery.

Adventurous situations were played for broad comedy. References to the sponsor, Fatima Cigarettes, were embedded in the storylines, and Rathbone delivered the commercials.

Early publicity said that the show would be based on &quot;actual experiences encountered by Rathbone during his adventurous life&quot;, from his younger years in South Africa to his worldwide travels. That concept ended after about 10 episodes, when the series changed to what critic John Crosby described as &quot;more orthodox lines, which is to say the plots are downright fantastic.&quot; Another change in format occurred beginning on August 27, 1949. Each episode featured a guest star, and Rathbone played varied roles rather than being heard as himself. Guest stars included John Garfield, Rex Harrison, Bela Lugosi, and Lilli Palmer.

Others actors heard on the program included Frances Chaney, Tony Barrett, Betty Lou Gerson, and Ed Begley. Michael Fitzmaurice was the program&#x27;s announcer. and Harry Ingram directed the program. Orchestra directors were Carl Hoff and Jack Miller. Gail Ingram was the writer.

The series ended with the October 1, 1949, episode as Fatima sponsorship was shifted to &quot;Dragnet&quot; on NBC effective October 6, 1949.

==Critical reception==
A review of the premiere episode in the trade publication &quot;Variety&quot; described the program as &quot;a weird combination of hard and often taut dramatics&quot;, with the mood often broken up by Rathbone&#x27;s interactions with Fatima. It concluded, &quot;According to the debut stanza, the show&#x27;s elements are too diverse to jell.&quot;

Crosby wrote that on this program Rathbone came off badly in comparison to his portrayal of Holmes and in comparison to his portrayal of Inspector Burke in the &quot;Scotland Yard&quot; radio series. Crosby wrote, &quot;He just blunders through each case, exhibiting only ordinary intelligence . . .&quot;

<text>Pierre Ambroise François Choderlos de Laclos (; 18 October 1741 – 5 September 1803) was a French novelist, official, Freemason and army general, best known for writing the epistolary novel &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot; (&quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;) (1782).

A unique case in French literature, he was for a long time considered to be as scandalous a writer as the Marquis de Sade or Nicolas Restif de la Bretonne. He was a military officer with no illusions about human relations, and an amateur writer; however, his initial plan was to &quot;write a work which departed from the ordinary, which made a noise, and which would remain on earth after his death&quot;; from this point of view he mostly attained his goals with the fame of his masterwork &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot;. It is one of the masterpieces of novelistic literature of the 18th century, which explores the amorous intrigues of the aristocracy. It has inspired many critical and analytic commentaries, plays and films.

==Biography==
Born in Amiens into a bourgeois family, in 1761 Laclos began studies at the &quot;School of Artillery of La Fère&quot;, ancestor of the École Polytechnique. As a young lieutenant, he briefly served in a garrison at La Rochelle until the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War (1763). Postings to Strasbourg (1765–1769), Grenoble (1769–1775) and Besançon (1775–1776) followed.

In 1763 Laclos became a Freemason in &quot;L&#x27;Union&quot; military lodge in Toul.

Despite a promotion to the rank of captain (1771), Laclos grew increasingly bored with his artillery garrison duties and with the company of soldiers; he began to devote his free time to writing. His first works, several light poems, appeared in the &quot;Almanach des Muses&quot;. Later he wrote the libretto for an opéra comique, &quot;Ernestine&quot;, inspired by a novel by Marie Jeanne Riccoboni. The music was composed by the Chevalier de Saint Georges. Its premiere on 19 July 1777, in the presence of Queen Marie Antoinette, proved a failure. In the same year, he established a new artillery school in Valence, which would include Napoleon Bonaparte among its students in the mid-1780s. On his return to Besançon in 1778 Laclos was promoted second captain of the Engineers. In this period he wrote several works which showed his great admiration of Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778).

In 1776 Laclos requested and received affiliation with the &quot;Henri IV&quot; lodge in Paris. There he helped Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans leading the Grand Orient of France. In 1777, in front of the Grand Orient&#x27;s dignitaries, he delivered a speech in which he urged for the initiation of women into Freemasonry.

In 1779, he was sent to Île-d&#x27;Aix (in present-day Charente-Maritime) to assist Marc René, marquis de Montalembert in the construction of fortifications there against the British. However, he spent most of his time writing his new epistolary novel, &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot;, as well as a &quot;Letter to Madame de Montalembert&quot;. When he asked for and received six months of vacation, he spent the time in Paris, writing.

Durand Neveu published &quot;Les Liaisons Dangereuses&quot; in four volumes on 23 March 1782; it became a widespread success (1,000 copies sold in a month, an exceptional result for the time). Laclos was immediately ordered to return to his garrison in Brittany; in 1783 he was sent to La Rochelle to collaborate in the construction of the new arsenal. Here he met Marie-Soulange Duperré, whom he would marry on 3 May 1786, and remain with for the rest of his life. The following year, he began a project of numbering the streets of Paris.

In 1788, Laclos left the army, entering the service of Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans, for whom, after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, he carried forward with intense diplomatic activity. In 1790/91 he was the editor of &quot;Journal des amis de la constitution&quot;, connected with the Feuillants. Captured by Republican ideals, he left the Duke to obtain a place as commissar in the Ministry of War. His reorganization has been credited as having a role in the French Revolutionary Army&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Valmy (20 September 1792). Later, after the desertion (April 1793) of general Charles François Dumouriez, he was however arrested as an &quot;Orleaniste&quot;, being freed after the Thermidorian Reaction of 27 July 1794.

He thenceforth spent some time in ballistic studies, which led him to the invention of the modern artillery shell. In 1795 he requested reinstatement in the Army by the Committee of Public Safety; the request was ignored. His attempts to obtain a diplomatic position and to found a bank also proved unsuccessful. Eventually, Laclos met the young general and recently appointed (November 1799) First Consul, Napoleon Bonaparte, and joined his party. On 16 January 1800 he was reinstated in the Army as Brigadier General in the Army of the Rhine; he took part in the Battle of Biberach (9 May 1800).

Made commander-in-chief of Reserve Artillery in Italy (1803), Laclos died shortly afterward in the former convent of St. Francis of Assisi at Taranto, probably of dysentery and malaria. He was buried in the fort still bearing his name (&quot;Forte de Laclos&quot;) in the Isola di San Paolo near the city, built under his direction. Following the restoration of the House of Bourbon in southern Italy in 1815, his burial tomb was destroyed; it is believed that his bones were tossed into the sea.

<text>Horsted Keynes is a village and civil parish in the Mid Sussex District of West Sussex, England. The village is about north east of Haywards Heath, in the Weald. The civil parish is largely rural, covering . At the 2011 census, it had a population of 1,586, increased from 1,507 in 2001. The 0° meridian passes about 1 mile to the east of the village of Horsted Keynes.

==Origin and history==
&quot;Willelmus de Cahaines&quot;, a Norman knight who participated in the conquest of England, and lord of what is now Cahagnes (Bessin), was given Middletone (Buckinghamshire) and the Sussex village of Horstede (The Place of Horses in Old English). The latter became&quot; Horstede de Cahaignes&quot; and in time Horsted Keynes. The place name is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086. The village has been formally twinned with the Normandy village of Cahagnes since 1971. The Horsted Cahagnes Society promotes social and cultural links, and organises annual exchange visits between the two places.

On Saturday, 28 August 1624, Horsted Keynes hosted what is believed to be the earliest known organised cricket match in Sussex. Knowledge of it stems from the death thirteen days later of Jasper Vinall, on whom an inquest was held. He had suffered a head injury during the game when accidentally hit by a cricket bat.

Two months before being assassinated, U.S. President John F. Kennedy slept in the parish when he stayed one Saturday night at Birch Grove, the home of the former Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. The American Secret Service closed the village that night, siting their communication hub in the Lounge Bar of The Crown Inn.

This part of Sussex was known for its iron industry long before the Industrial Revolution and the coming of the railways. Little remains of this now, except for the hammer ponds and other traces of this activity dotted around the surrounding countryside, although iron working is remembered in many local place names.

==Amenities==
Horsted Keynes is centred on a village green with pubs, Post Office and village store. The Post Office was to be closed down for lack of use but was bought up by a group of villagers who invested in its continued use for the community. It now serves a large rural area.

Like many other English villages Horsted Keynes is losing businesses that have been there for many years. After the closure of the main village store in 1992, and the more recent loss of the butcher, village hairdresser and photographer, the village garage closed down in June 2007. It was only 20 years ago that the village had two garages, but now it has none, leaving the nearest petrol retailer more than away. Planning permission was granted and the garage site has now been turned into residential accommodation.

==Churches==

The two principal churches are: the Anglican Parish Church dedicated to St Giles and the Roman Catholic church of St Stephen which is unoccupied and controlled from the nearest town, Haywards Heath. 

==Railway station==
The railway station, three-quarters of a mile from the village, was on the line from East Grinstead to Lewes. It is now owned and operated by the Bluebell Railway, which is largely run by volunteers and operates using vintage steam trains. The station originally also had a connection with Haywards Heath, between 1883 and 1963.

==Notable people==
*Robert Leighton (prelate) - buried here
*Harold Macmillan, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, owner of Birch Grove – buried here, alongside his wife Dorothy Macmillan

<text>NetBIOS Frames (NBF) is a non-routable network- and transport-level data protocol most commonly used as one of the layers of Microsoft Windows networking in the 1990s. NBF or NetBIOS over IEEE 802.2 LLC is used by a number of network operating systems released in the 1990s, such as LAN Manager, LAN Server, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95 and Windows NT. Other protocols, such as NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP), and NBX (NetBIOS-over-IPX/SPX) also implement the NetBIOS/NetBEUI services over other protocol suites.

The NBF protocol is broadly, but incorrectly, referred to as &quot;NetBEUI&quot;. This originates from the confusion with NetBIOS Extended User Interface, an extension to the NetBIOS API that was originally developed in conjunction with the NBF protocol; both the protocol and the &quot;NetBEUI&quot; emulator were originally developed to allow NetBIOS programs to run over IBM&#x27;s new Token Ring network. Microsoft caused this confusion by labelling its NBF protocol implementation &quot;NetBEUI&quot;. NBF is a protocol and the original NetBEUI was a NetBIOS application programming interface extension.

NBF protocol uses 802.2 type 1 mode to provide the NetBIOS/NetBEUI name service and datagram service, and 802.2 type 2 mode to provide the NetBIOS/NetBEUI session service (virtual circuit). NBF protocol makes wide use of broadcast messages, which accounts for its reputation as a interface. While the protocol consumes few network resources in a very small network, broadcasts begin to adversely impact performance and speed when the number of hosts present in a network grows.

Sytek developed NetBIOS for IBM for the PC-Network program and was used by Microsoft for MS-NET in 1985. In 1987, Microsoft and Novell utilized it for their network operating systems LAN Manager and NetWare.

Because NBF protocol is unroutable it can only be used to communicate with devices in the same broadcast domain, but being bridgeable it can also be used to communicate with network segments connected to each other via bridges. The lack of support for routable networks means that NBF is only well-suited for small to medium-sized networks, where it has such an advantage over TCP/IP that requires little configuration. The NetBIOS/NetBEUI services must be implemented atop other protocols, such as IPX and TCP/IP (see above) in order to be of use in an internetwork.

==Services==
NetBIOS/NetBEUI provides three distinct services:
* Name service for name registration and resolution
* Datagram distribution service for connectionless communication
* Session service for connection-oriented communication

NBF protocol implements all of these services.

===Name service===
In order to start sessions or distribute datagrams, an application must register its NetBIOS/NetBEUI name using the name service. To do so, an &quot;Add Name Query&quot; or &quot;Add Group Name Query&quot; packet is broadcast on the network. If the NetBIOS/NetBEUI name is already in use, the name service, running on the host that owns the name, broadcasts a &quot;Node Conflict&quot; message on the network.

In addition, to start a session or to send a datagram to a particular host rather than to broadcast the datagram, NBF protocol has to determine the MAC address of the host with a given NetBIOS/NetBEUI name; this is done by sending a &quot;Name Query&quot; packet, the response to which will have the MAC address of the host sending the response, i.e. the host with that name.

===Datagram distribution service===
Datagram mode is &quot;connectionless&quot;. A datagram is sent with a &quot;Datagram&quot; packet if it is being sent to a particular NetBIOS/NetBEUI name, or a &quot;Datagram Broadcast&quot; packet if it is being sent to all NetBIOS/NetBEUI names on the network.

===Session service===
Session mode lets two computers establish a connection for a &quot;conversation,&quot; allows larger messages to be handled, and provides error detection and recovery.

Sessions are established by exchanging packets. The computer establishing the session sends a &quot;Name Query&quot; request, specifying that a session should be initialized. The computer with which the session is to be established will respond with a &quot;Name Recognized&quot; response indicating either that no session can be established (either because that computer is not listening for sessions being established to that name or because no resources are available to establish a session to that name) or that a session can be established (in which case the response will include a local session number to be used in subsequent packets). The computer that is starting the session will then send a &quot;Session Initialize&quot; request which will prompt a &quot;Session Confirm&quot; response.

Data is transmitted during an established session by data packets. IEEE 802.2 handles flow control and retransmission of data packets. Because NetBIOS/NetBEUI allows packets to be sent that are larger than the largest packet that could be transmitted on a particular MAC layer, a NetBIOS/NetBEUI packet might have to be transmitted as a sequence of &quot;Data First Middle&quot; packets and a &quot;Data Only Last&quot; packet; packets that do not need to be segmented in that fashion will be sent as a single &quot;Data Only Last&quot; packet. An acknowledgment will be sent for all &quot;Data Only Last&quot; packets that are successfully received; this will also acknowledge all preceding &quot;Data First Middle&quot; packets.

Sessions are closed by sending a &quot;Session End&quot; request.

==Availability==
NBF protocol – apart from DOS, OS/2 and Unix implementations – was officially supported by Microsoft on almost every version of Windows up to Windows 2000, but its use has decreased quickly since the development of NBT.

Microsoft officially dropped support starting with Windows XP, but it is included on the Windows XP CD-ROM and can be installed manually. Windows Vista does not include &quot;NetBEUI&quot; (means NBF) support at all, but the Windows XP &quot;NetBEUI&quot; support drivers can be used.

<text>In the OSI networking model, Data Link Control (DLC) is the service provided by the data link layer. Network interface cards have a DLC address that identifies each card; for instance, Ethernet and other types of cards have a 48-bit MAC address built into the cards&#x27; firmware when they are manufactured. 

There is also a network transport protocol with the name Data Link Control, comparable to better-known protocols like TCP/IP and AppleTalk. DLC is a transport protocol used by IBM SNA mainframe computers and peripherals and compatible equipment. In computer networking, it is typically used for communications between network-attached printers, workstations and servers, for example by HP in their JetDirect print servers. While it was widely used up until the time of Windows 2000, versions from Windows XP onward do not include support for DLC.

<doc id="263315" wikidata="Q3989988" url="?curid=263315" title="The Whistler (radio series)">
<text>The Whistler is an American radio mystery drama which ran from May 16, 1942, until September 22, 1955, on the west-coast regional CBS radio network. The show was also broadcast in Chicago and over Armed Forces Radio. On the west coast, it was sponsored by the Signal Oil Company: &quot;That whistle is your signal for the Signal Oil program, &quot;The Whistler&quot;.&quot; There were also two short-lived attempts to form east-coast broadcast spurs: July 3 to September 25, 1946, sponsored by the Campbell Soup Company; and March 26, 1947, to September 29, 1948, sponsored by Household Finance. The program was also adapted into a film noir series by Columbia Pictures in 1944.

==Characters and story==

Each episode of &quot;The Whistler&quot; began with the sound of footsteps and a person whistling. (&quot;The Saint&quot; radio series with Vincent Price used a similar opening.) The haunting signature theme tune was composed by Wilbur Hatch and featured Dorothy Roberts whistling with an orchestra.

A character known only as the Whistler was the host and narrator of the tales, which focused on crime and fate. He often commented directly upon the action in the manner of a Greek chorus, taunting the characters, guilty or innocent, from an omniscient perspective. The stories followed a formula in which a person&#x27;s criminal acts were typically revealed either by an overlooked but important detail or by the criminal&#x27;s own stupidity. An ironic ending, often grim, was a key feature of each episode. But on rare occasions, such as &quot;Christmas Bonus&quot; broadcast on Christmas Day 1944, the plot&#x27;s twist of fate caused the story to end happily for the protagonist.

Bill Forman, a veteran radio announcer, had the title role of the Whistler for the longest period of time. Others who portrayed the Whistler at various times were Gale Gordon, Joseph Kearns, Marvin Miller (announcer for the show, who occasionally filled in for Forman and played supporting roles), and Bill Johnstone (who had the title role on radio&#x27;s &quot;The Shadow&quot; from 1938 to 1943). Cast members included Betty Lou Gerson, Hans Conried, Joseph Kearns, Cathy Lewis, Elliott Lewis, Gerald Mohr, Lurene Tuttle and Jack Webb.

Writer-producer J. Donald Wilson established the tone of the show during its first two years, and he was followed in 1944 by producer-director George Allen. Other directors included Sterling Tracy and Sherman Marks with final scripts by Joel Malone and Harold Swanton. Of the 692 episodes, over 200 no longer exist. In 1946, a local Chicago version of &quot;The Whistler&quot; with local actors (including Everett Clarke as the Whistler) aired Sundays on WBBM, sponsored by Meister Brau beer.

==Films and television==

===Films===
&quot;The Whistler&quot; was adapted into a film noir series of eight films by Columbia Pictures. The &quot;Voice of the Whistler&quot; was provided by an uncredited Otto Forrest. In the first seven films, veteran actor Richard Dix played the main character in the storya different character in each film, ranging from mild-mannered sympathetic heroes to flawed and forceful villains. In the eighth film, made after Dix&#x27;s retirement, Michael Duane played the main character.

===Television===
A syndicated TV version of &quot;The Whistler&quot; was produced and aired for a brief period in 1954. Bill Forman, the most frequently employed radio voice of the show&#x27;s title character, reprised that role on TV. 

===Cultural references===
On April 21, 1964, the show was parodied on an episode of &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; entitled &quot;I Am the Fiddler,&quot; an expanded reboot of an earlier, like-named, audio-only Benny parody, which aired during the October 20, 1946 episode of his radio show.

In the 1990 film &quot;The Two Jakes&quot;, set in Los Angeles in the late 1940s, the opening narrative of &quot;The Whistler&quot; can be heard on the car radio as private detective J.J. Gittes (played by Jack Nicholson) cruises the streets.

<text>A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. 
When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data are represented in a 3D plot they may be called &quot;waterfall displays&quot;.

Spectrograms are used extensively in the fields of music, linguistics, sonar, radar, speech processing, seismology, ornithology, and others. Spectrograms of audio can be used to identify spoken words phonetically, and to analyse the various calls of animals.

A spectrogram can be generated by an optical spectrometer, a bank of band-pass filters, by Fourier transform or by a wavelet transform (in which case it is also known as a scaleogram or scalogram).
A spectrogram is usually depicted as a heat map, i.e., as an image with the intensity shown by varying the colour or brightness.

==Format==
A common format is a graph with two geometric dimensions: one axis represents time, and the other axis represents frequency; a third dimension indicating the amplitude of a particular frequency at a particular time is represented by the intensity or color of each point in the image.

There are many variations of format: sometimes the vertical and horizontal axes are switched, so time runs up and down; sometimes as a waterfall plot where the amplitude is represented by height of a 3D surface instead of color or intensity. The frequency and amplitude axes can be either linear or logarithmic, depending on what the graph is being used for. Audio would usually be represented with a logarithmic amplitude axis (probably in decibels, or dB), and frequency would be linear to emphasize harmonic relationships, or logarithmic to emphasize musical, tonal relationships.

==Generation==
Spectrograms of light may be created directly using an optical spectrometer over time.

Spectrograms may be created from a time-domain signal in one of two ways: approximated as a filterbank that results from a series of band-pass filters (this was the only way before the advent of modern digital signal processing), or calculated from the time signal using the Fourier transform. These two methods actually form two different time–frequency representations, but are equivalent under some conditions.

The bandpass filters method usually uses analog processing to divide the input signal into frequency bands; the magnitude of each filter&#x27;s output controls a transducer that records the spectrogram as an image on paper.

Creating a spectrogram using the FFT is a digital process. Digitally sampled data, in the time domain, is broken up into chunks, which usually overlap, and Fourier transformed to calculate the magnitude of the frequency spectrum for each chunk. Each chunk then corresponds to a vertical line in the image; a measurement of magnitude versus frequency for a specific moment in time (the midpoint of the chunk). These spectrums or time plots are then &quot;laid side by side&quot; to form the image or a three-dimensional surface, or slightly overlapped in various ways, i.e. windowing. This process essentially corresponds to computing the squared magnitude of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) of the signal formula_1 — that is, for a window width formula_2, formula_3.

==Limitations and resynthesis==
From the formula above, it appears that a spectrogram contains no information about the exact, or even approximate, phase of the signal that it represents. For this reason, it is not possible to reverse the process and generate a copy of the original signal from a spectrogram, though in situations where the exact initial phase is unimportant it may be possible to generate a useful approximation of the original signal. The Analysis &amp; Resynthesis Sound Spectrograph is an example of a computer program that attempts to do this. The pattern playback was an early speech synthesizer, designed at Haskins Laboratories in the late 1940s, that converted pictures of the acoustic patterns of speech (spectrograms) back into sound.

In fact, there is some phase information in the spectrogram, but it appears in another form, as time delay (or group delay) which is the dual of the instantaneous frequency.

The size and shape of the analysis window can be varied. A smaller (shorter) window will produce more accurate results in timing, at the expense of precision of frequency representation. A larger (longer) window will provide a more precise frequency representation, at the expense of precision in timing representation. This is an instance of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, that the product of the precision in two conjugate variables is greater than or equal to a constant (B*T&gt;=1 in the usual notation).

==Applications==
* Early analog spectrograms were applied to a wide range of areas including the study of bird calls (such as that of the great tit), with current research continuing using modern digital equipment and applied to all animal sounds. Contemporary use of the digital spectrogram is especially useful for studying frequency modulation (FM) in animal calls. Specifically, the distinguishing characteristics of FM chirps, broadband clicks, and social harmonizing are most easily visualized with the spectrogram.
* Spectrograms are useful in assisting in overcoming speech deficits and in speech training for the portion of the population that is profoundly deaf.
* The studies of phonetics and speech synthesis are often facilitated through the use of spectrograms.
* In deep learning-keyed speech synthesis, spectrogram (or spectrogram in mel scale) is first predicted by a seq2seq model, then the spectrogram is fed to a neural vocoder to derive the synthesized raw waveform.
* By reversing the process of producing a spectrogram, it is possible to create a signal whose spectrogram is an arbitrary image. This technique can be used to hide a picture in a piece of audio and has been employed by several electronic music artists. See also Steganography.
* Some modern music is created using spectrograms as an intermediate medium; changing the intensity of different frequencies over time, or even creating new ones, by drawing them and then inverse transforming. See Audio timescale-pitch modification and Phase vocoder.
* Spectrograms can be used to analyze the results of passing a test signal through a signal processor such as a filter in order to check its performance.
* High definition spectrograms are used in the development of RF and microwave systems.
* Spectrograms are now used to display scattering parameters measured with vector network analyzers.
* The US Geological Survey and the IRIS Consortium provide near real-time spectrogram displays for monitoring seismic stations
* Spectrograms can be used with recurrent neural networks for speech recognition.
* Individuals&#x27; spectrograms are collected by the Chinese government as part of its mass surveillance programs.
* For a vibration signal, a spectrogram&#x27;s color scale identifies the frequencies of a waveform&#x27;s amplitude peaks over time. Unlike a time or frequency graph, a spectrogram correlates peak values to time and frequency. Vibration test engineers use spectrograms to analyze the frequency content of a continuous waveform, locating strong signals and determining how the vibration behavior changes over time.
* Spectrograms can be used to analyze speech in two different applications: automatic detection of speech deficits in cochlear implant users and phoneme class recognition to extract phone-attribute features.
* In order to obtain a speaker&#x27;s pronunciation characteristics, some researchers proposed a method based on an idea from bionics, which uses spectrogram statistics to achieve a characteristic spectrogram to give a stable representation of the speaker&#x27;s pronunciation from a linear superposition of short-time spectrograms.
* Researchers explore a novel approach to ECG signal analysis by leveraging spectrogram techniques, possibly for enhanced visualization and understanding. The integration of MFCC for feature extraction suggests a cross-disciplinary application, borrowing methods from audio processing to extract relevant information from biomedical signals.
* Accurate interpretation of temperature indicating paint (TIP) is of great importance in aviation and other industrial applications. 2D spectrogram of TIP can be used in temperature interpretation.
* The spectrogram can be used to process the signal for the rate of change of the human thorax. By visualizing respiratory signals using a spectrogram, the researchers have proposed an approach to the classification of respiration states based on a neural network model.

<text>The gnateaters are a bird family, Conopophagidae, consisting of twelve small suboscine passerine species in two genera, which occur in South and Central America. 

==Taxonomy==
The family Conopophagidae was introduced in 1877 by the English zoologist Alfred Henry Garrod. The family was formerly restricted to the gnateater genus &quot;Conopophaga&quot; but a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2005 found that the genus &quot;Pittasoma&quot; in the family Formicariidae was sister to &quot;Conopophaga&quot;. The association between this genus and &quot;Conopophaga&quot; is also supported by traits in their natural history, morphology, and vocalizations. The members of this family are very closely related to the antbirds and less closely to the antpittas and tapaculos. Due to their remote and dim habitat, gnateaters are a little-studied and poorly known family of birds.

== Description==

They are round, short-tailed, and long-legged birds, about in length, with &quot;Pittasoma&quot; being larger than &quot;Conopophaga&quot;. They are quite upright when standing. All species are sexually dimorphic, although the extent of this varies greatly. Most &quot;Conopophaga&quot; species have a white tuft behind the eye.

==Distribution and habitat==
Gnateaters are birds of the forest understory, bamboo stands, and the forest floor. The members of the genus &quot;Conopophaga&quot; are found in the Amazon and Orinoco basins, east and central Andean slopes, Atlantic Forest, and nearby regions, while the members of the genus &quot;Pittasoma&quot; are found in the Chocó, and Panama and Costa Rica. Some species live in impenetrable thickets; others live in more open forest. Most are entirely restricted to humid habitats, but several species extend into drier regions in eastern Brazil. While the members of the genus &quot;Conopophaga&quot; always are found near the forest floor, seldom rising more than 1.5 m above the ground, they also seldom travel or spend much time on the ground (though they do feed there; see diet). The members of the genus &quot;Pittasoma&quot; are more commonly seen hopping around on the ground.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Food and feeding===
Gnateaters are insectivorous as the group name implies. The members of the genus &quot;Conopophaga&quot; feed mostly using two methods; one is to perch above the forest floor until prey is spotted, then lunge down to the ground to snatch it; having landed on the ground to snatch a prey item it will not remain on the forest floor for more than a couple of seconds. The second method used is to glean insects directly from the foliage, trunks, and branches of low vegetation. Typical prey items include spiders, caterpillars, insect larvae, grasshoppers and beetles; individuals of some species have also been observed eating fruit and in one case a frog. Very little information is available on the diet of the two &quot;Pittasoma&quot;, but they are presumably also insectivorous.

== Species list ==
The family contains 12 species in two genera.

<doc id="263321" wikidata="Q2914302" url="?curid=263321" title="Concave function">
<text>In mathematics, a concave function is one for which the function value at any convex combination of elements in the domain is greater than or equal to that convex combination of those domain elements. Equivalently, a concave function is any function for which the hypograph is convex. The class of concave functions is in a sense the opposite of the class of convex functions. A concave function is also synonymously called concave downwards, concave down, convex upwards, convex cap, or upper convex.

==Definition==
A real-valued function formula_1 on an interval (or, more generally, a convex set in vector space) is said to be &quot;concave&quot; if, for any formula_2 and formula_3 in the interval and for any formula_4,

:formula_5

A function is called &quot;strictly concave&quot; if additionally any formula_6 and formula_7.

For a function formula_8, this second definition merely states that for every formula_9 strictly between formula_2 and formula_3, the point formula_12 on the graph of formula_1 is above the straight line joining the points formula_14 and formula_15.

A function formula_1 is quasiconcave if the upper contour sets of the function formula_17 are convex sets.

==Properties==

===Functions of a single variable===
# A differentiable function is (strictly) concave on an interval if and only if its derivative function is (strictly) monotonically decreasing on that interval, that is, a concave function has a non-increasing (decreasing) slope.
# Points where concavity changes (between concave and convex) are inflection points.
# If is twice-differentiable, then is concave if and only if is non-positive (or, informally, if the &quot;acceleration&quot; is non-positive). If is negative then is strictly concave, but the converse is not true, as shown by .
# If is concave and differentiable, then it is bounded above by its first-order Taylor approximation: formula_18
# A Lebesgue measurable function on an interval is concave if and only if it is midpoint concave, that is, for any and in formula_19
# If a function is concave, and , then is subadditive on formula_20. Proof:
#* Since is concave and , letting we have formula_21
#* For formula_22: formula_23

===Functions of &quot;n&quot; variables===
# A function is concave over a convex set if and only if the function is a convex function over the set.
# The sum of two concave functions is itself concave and so is the pointwise minimum of two concave functions, i.e. the set of concave functions on a given domain form a semifield.
# Near a strict local maximum in the interior of the domain of a function, the function must be concave; as a partial converse, if the derivative of a strictly concave function is zero at some point, then that point is a local maximum.
# Any local maximum of a concave function is also a global maximum. A &quot;strictly&quot; concave function will have at most one global maximum.

==Examples==
* The functions formula_24 and formula_25 are concave on their domains, as their second derivatives formula_26 and formula_27 are always negative.
* The logarithm function formula_28 is concave on its domain formula_29, as its derivative formula_30 is a strictly decreasing function.
* Any affine function formula_31 is both concave and convex, but neither strictly-concave nor strictly-convex.
* The sine function is concave on the interval formula_32.
* The function formula_33, where formula_34 is the determinant of a nonnegative-definite matrix &quot;B&quot;, is concave.

==Applications==
* Rays bending in the computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere involve concave functions.
* In expected utility theory for choice under uncertainty, cardinal utility functions of risk averse decision makers are concave. 
* In microeconomic theory, production functions are usually assumed to be concave over some or all of their domains, resulting in diminishing returns to input factors.
* In Thermodynamics and Information Theory, Entropy is a concave function. In the case of thermodynamic entropy, without phase transition, entropy as a function of extensive variables is strictly concave. If the system can undergo phase transition, and if it is allowed to split into two subsystems of different phase (phase separation, e.g. boiling), the entropy-maximal parameters of the subsystems will result in a combined entropy precisely on the straight line between the two phases. This means that the &quot;Effective Entropy&quot; of a system with phase transition is the convex envelope of entropy without phase separation; therefore, the entropy of a system including phase separation will be non-strictly concave.

<text>In geometry, curve sketching (or curve tracing) are techniques for producing a rough idea of overall shape of a plane curve given its equation, without computing the large numbers of points required for a detailed plot. It is an application of the theory of curves to find their main features.

==Basic techniques==
The following are usually easy to carry out and give important clues as to the shape of a curve:
*Determine the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; intercepts of the curve. The &quot;x&quot; intercepts are found by setting &quot;y&quot; equal to 0 in the equation of the curve and solving for &quot;x&quot;. Similarly, the &quot;y&quot; intercepts are found by setting &quot;x&quot; equal to 0 in the equation of the curve and solving for &quot;y&quot;.
*Determine the symmetry of the curve. If the exponent of &quot;x&quot; is always even in the equation of the curve then the &quot;y&quot;-axis is an axis of symmetry for the curve. Similarly, if the exponent of &quot;y&quot; is always even in the equation of the curve then the &quot;x&quot;-axis is an axis of symmetry for the curve. If the sum of the degrees of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in each term is always even or always odd, then the curve is symmetric about the origin and the origin is called a &quot;center&quot; of the curve.
*Determine any bounds on the values of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.
*If the curve passes through the origin then determine the tangent lines there. For algebraic curves, this can be done by removing all but the terms of lowest order from the equation and solving.
*Similarly, removing all but the terms of highest order from the equation and solving gives the points where the curve meets the line at infinity.
*Determine the asymptotes of the curve. Also determine from which side the curve approaches the asymptotes and where the asymptotes intersect the curve.
*Equate first and second derivatives to 0 to find the stationary points and inflection points respectively. If the equation of the curve cannot be solved explicitly for &quot;x&quot; or &quot;y&quot;, finding these derivatives requires implicit differentiation.

==Newton&#x27;s diagram==
Newton&#x27;s diagram (also known as &quot;Newton&#x27;s parallelogram&quot;, after Isaac Newton) is a technique for determining the shape of an algebraic curve close to and far away from the origin. It consists of plotting (α, β) for each term &quot;Ax&quot;α&quot;y&quot;β in the equation of the curve. The resulting diagram is then analyzed to produce information about the curve.

Specifically, draw a diagonal line connecting two points on the diagram so that every other point is either on or to the right and above it. There is at least one such line if the curve passes through the origin. Let the equation of the line be &quot;q&quot;α+&quot;p&quot;β=&quot;r&quot;. Suppose the curve is approximated by &quot;y&quot;=&quot;Cxp/q&quot; near the origin. Then the term &quot;Ax&quot;α&quot;y&quot;β is approximately &quot;Dx&quot;α+βp/q. The exponent is &quot;r/q&quot; when (α, β) is on the line and higher when it is above and to the right. Therefore, the significant terms near the origin under this assumption are only those lying on the line and the others may be ignored; it produces a simple approximate equation for the curve. There may be several such diagonal lines, each corresponding to one or more branches of the curve, and the approximate equations of the branches may be found by applying this method to each line in turn.

For example, the folium of Descartes is defined by the equation
:formula_1. 
Then Newton&#x27;s diagram has points at (3, 0), (1, 1), and (0, 3). Two diagonal lines may be drawn as described above, 2α+β=3 and α+2β=3. These produce
:formula_2
:formula_3
as approximate equations for the horizontal and vertical branches of the curve where they cross at the origin.

==The analytical triangle==
De Gua extended Newton&#x27;s diagram to form a technique called the analytical triangle (or &quot;de Gua&#x27;s triangle&quot;). The points (α, β) are plotted as with Newton&#x27;s diagram method but the line α+β=&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the degree of the curve, is added to form a triangle which contains the diagram. This method considers all lines which bound the smallest convex polygon which contains the plotted points (see convex hull).

<text>Operation Crosstie was a series of 48 nuclear tests conducted by the United States in 1967–1968 at the Nevada Test Site. These tests followed the &quot;Operation Latchkey&quot; series and preceded the &quot;Operation Bowline&quot; series.

==Nuclear tests==

===Gasbuggy===
The blast designated Gasbuggy involved an underground detonation, intended to stimulate production of natural gas by cracking the rock in the underground formation of its deposit. The test proceeded as expected, but not only did the production not increase as much as expected, but the customers also refused to buy gas contaminated with traces of radioisotopes.

===Faultless===

The Faultless test was a calibration test conducted in a mine cavity 3,200 feet beneath the Hot Creek Valley near Tonopah, Nevada, with a yield of around 1 megaton. This test was conducted to see if the land was fit for testing a 5 megaton thermonuclear warhead for the Spartan missile. The test failed because of the large degree of faulting that resulted in the area around the test. It was decided that the land was unfit for multi-megaton nuclear tests, so a similar calibration test was conducted at Amchitka Island, Alaska, in the fall of 1969 during Operation Mandrel.

The 8 foot diameter steel pipe that was used to place the bomb remains at the test site. The top of the pipe was originally flush with the surface; however, the ground sank by nine feet following the explosion. A plaque is mounted on the exposed pipe to commemorate the event.
===Buggy===

Buggy was a Plowshare test designed to excavate a channel. It was a simultaneous detonation of 5 devices, placed apart and below the surface that resulted in a
channel wide,
900 feet long, and deep
. Or 65 feet deep and 254 feet wide, according to declassified U.S. film.

The USSR conducted a similar salvo-test to investigate the use of nuclear explosions in the construction of the Pechora–Kama Canal project. On March 23, 1971, three simultaneously detonated 15 kiloton underground nuclear charges were exploded in the Taiga test.

===Rickey===
Rickey was the first Los Alamos test to use a television PINEX (pin-hole neutron experiment) system. A fluor was imaged using a newtonian telescope which was split for imaging by two cameras by a beam splitter. The instrument package containing the television system was protected from neutrons and gamma rays by kinking the path between it and the nuclear device and by placing baffles along the optical path pipe.

==List of nuclear tests==

The United States&#x27;s Crosstie nuclear test series was a group of 48 nuclear tests conducted in 1967–1968. These tests followed the &quot;Operation Latchkey&quot; series and preceded the &quot;Operation Bowline&quot; series.

<text>Suddenly Susan is an American television sitcom that aired on NBC from September 19, 1996, to December 26, 2000. The series was created by Clyde Phillips and starred Brooke Shields in her first regular series. Shields played Susan Keane, a glamorous San Francisco magazine writer who begins to adjust to being single, and who learns to be independent-minded after having been taken care of all her life. The series was developed by Gary Dontzig and Steven Peterman, who also served as executive producers during the first three seasons, and was produced by Warner Bros. Television.

==Synopsis==
Susan Keane (Brooke Shields) has always been taken care of by someone else. She worked as a copy editor at &quot;The Gate&quot;, a fictional San Francisco magazine. On her wedding day, she realizes that she and her wealthy, vain fiancé, Kip, are not meant for each other and that there is more to life than just being known as the &quot;s&quot; in &quot;The Kip Richmonds.&quot; She abruptly leaves him at the altar. Now, she&#x27;s suddenly just Susan. Susan&#x27;s parents (guest stars Swoosie Kurtz and Ray Baker) were less than ecstatic about their daughter deciding to end her engagement to Kip, though her grandmother and confidant, Nana (Barbara Barrie), stands as a pillar of support for Susan.

The day after the wedding, Susan goes to her boss, Jack Richmond (Judd Nelson), the rebellious brother of Susan&#x27;s former fiancé, Kip, begging for her job back. Instead, Jack assigns Susan to write a regular column about being suddenly single. Susan&#x27;s coworkers include photographer Luis Rivera (Nestor Carbonell), boyish rock music reporter Todd Stites (David Strickland), restaurant critic Vicki Groener (Kathy Griffin), and, in later episodes, investigative reporter and Susan&#x27;s old enemy Maddy Piper (Andréa Bendewald).

In the show&#x27;s final season, &quot;The Gate&quot; is taken over by Ian Maxtone-Graham (Eric Idle) and overhauled into a men&#x27;s magazine that is run out of an old warehouse in Chinatown. Along with this, Ian brings his own team of workers, including executive assistant and U.S. Navy veteran Miranda Charles (Sherri Shepherd), sports writer Nate Knaborski (Currie Graham), and freelance photographer Oliver Browne (Rob Estes). Susan is faced with a new set of problems and has to prove herself all over again.

Besides the task of putting together a magazine and focusing on the lead character&#x27;s life, &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot; also focuses on the private lives of many employees in the show.

===Series overview===
===Season 1 (1996–97)===
===Season 2 (1997–98)===
===Season 3 (1998–99)===
===Season 4 (1999–2000)===
==Production==
===Original pilot===
In the show&#x27;s original pilot, written by Billy Van Zandt and Jane Milmore and based on a dramatic script by Clyde Phillips, Susan worked at a publishing house editing children&#x27;s books. After breaking up with her live-in boyfriend Ted (Brian McNamara), Susan finds herself &quot;single&quot; for the first time in years. Concurrently, Susan faces even greater challenges at work when her boss, Eric (Philip Casnoff), assigns her the task of working as an editor with Charlotte (Elizabeth Ashley), a hugely successful and highly opinionated romance novelist. Always on hand to provide support is Susan&#x27;s grandmother, Nana (Nancy Marchand), her co-workers, acerbic best friend Marcy (Maggie Wheeler) and Neil (David Krumholtz), who has a crush on Susan.

When the series was picked up, former &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; writers/producers Gary Dontzig and Steven Peterman were brought in to redevelop the concept, being appointed as the show&#x27;s co-showrunners. Other changes between the pilot and the series included Barbara Barrie replacing Nancy Marchand in the role of Nana, and Swoosie Kurtz and Ray Baker replacing Kurt Fuller and Caroline McWilliams as Susan&#x27;s parents, Bill and Liz; the characters of Eric and Ted were reworked into the roles of Jack Richmond (played by Nelson) and his brother, Kip (Anthony Starke), whom Susan jilts during their wedding. (McNamara would later play Cooper Elliot, a friend of Jack&#x27;s who briefly replaces him as publisher of &quot;The Gate&quot; through a poker game bet and takes Susan to Italy at the end of Season 1.) In the series, though the setting switches from a publishing house to a magazine, the main office set retained most of its features from the pilot; the most noticeable difference was that the elevator was at stage right. While the pilot&#x27;s storyline featuring Elizabeth Ashley as one of the publishing house&#x27;s clients was not used in the series, a cardboard cut out of Ashley that was featured in the pilot appears throughout the first three seasons of the show – it can be seen briefly behind Susan&#x27;s desk, near the filing cabinets along the back wall.

The actual location for the exterior shots of the office was the Newhall Building at 260 California Street in San Francisco.

===Death of David Strickland===

David Strickland died by suicide in a Las Vegas motel room on March 22, 1999. Strickland&#x27;s death was later incorporated into the show&#x27;s third season finale, &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, which killed off his character, Todd Stites. The episode&#x27;s plot finds Susan desperately trying to find Todd when she suspects he has gone missing after he fails to show up to work one morning. As the episode progresses, Susan learns about a number of good deeds that Todd had done around his neighborhood that she never knew about. In-character interviews with the supporting cast also appear throughout the episode, with each actor sharing their personal experiences they had with Strickland before his death, framed as each character&#x27;s own memories of Todd. As the episode comes to an end, Todd&#x27;s favorite song, &quot;Praise You&quot; by Fatboy Slim, plays outside of Luis&#x27; apartment as Susan and her co-workers sit in a circle praying for Todd&#x27;s well-being. At last, the phone in the middle of the room rings, but the camera cuts away before the news of Todd&#x27;s fate can be revealed. The episode ends with memorable clips of Strickland from the show and the memorial subtitle: &quot;The Gods of comedy looked down upon you and smiled&quot;.

===Fourth season and cancellation===

Before production began on the fourth and final season, Judd Nelson and Andrea Bendewald left the show; Peterman and Dontzig also stepped down as showrunners, and the series replaced almost its entire writing staff (with the exception of executive producer Maria Semple, who joined the show at the start of Season 3 and took over showrunning duties alongside Mark Driscoll, one of the new writers hired for the fourth season). The departures of Nelson and Bendewald, along with the death of Strickland, prompted Driscoll and Semple to retool the series: &quot;The Gate&quot; was transformed into a men&#x27;s magazine by its new owner, Ian Maxtone-Graham (Eric Idle), and relocated from its trendy uptown offices overlooking the bay to a dingy former warehouse in Chinatown. In tow, Ian brought his own team of workers, including executive assistant and U.S. Navy veteran Miranda Charles (Sherri Shepherd), sports writer Nate Knaborski (Currie Graham), and freelance photographer Oliver Browne (Rob Estes). Faced with new challenges, Susan suddenly had to prove herself all over again.

Airing between &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;ER&quot; during its first season, &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot; was initially a ratings success, attracting almost 25 million viewers per episode, despite mostly unfavorable critical reviews. When the show was moved to Monday nights at 8:00 p.m. (against the Top 30 hit &quot;Cosby&quot;) for the second season, the show experienced a large decline in viewership, sliding from #3 to #71 in one year, bringing in less than 11 million viewers. The ratings failed to bounce back, and in its final season, the show barely ranked in the top 100, prompting NBC to pull it from the schedule in January. It returned briefly in June, but at the end of the month was pulled from the network&#x27;s prime-time schedule with five episodes left unaired. One episode, &quot;The Gay Parade&quot;, remained unaired by NBC (but was eventually shown on Lifetime a few years later); the final four episodes (including the two-part series finale) were burned off from 2:00 to 4:00 a.m. EST on December 26, 2000, airing as part of the &quot;NBC All Night&quot; overnight block.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, season 1 has an approval rating of 55% based on reviews from 11 critics. The website&#x27;s critical consensus was: &quot;Comedic inspiration doesn&#x27;t spark Suddenly for this Susan, hampered by derivative gags that undermine Brooke Shields&#x27; energetic performance.&quot;

Caryn James of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Like its lead character, &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot; has no identity of its own. The beauty of the magic time slot is that it gives Suddenly Susan, with its engaging star and flexible format, a well-deserved chance to grow.&quot;

Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a grade C and called it: &quot;A wearyingly self-conscious updating of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;: nice girl trying to make it in the competitive workplace of a big town.&quot;

<doc id="263327" wikidata="Q28449" url="?curid=263327" title="Charadriidae">
<text>The bird family Charadriidae includes the plovers, dotterels, and lapwings. The family contains 69 species that are divided into 10 genera.

== Taxonomy ==
The family Charadriidae was introduced (as Charadriadæ) by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in a guide to the contents of the British Museum published in 1820. Most members of the family are known as &quot;plovers&quot;, &quot;lapwings&quot; or &quot;dotterels&quot;. These were rather vague terms which were not applied with any great consistency in the past. In general, larger, broader-winged species have often been called &quot;lapwings&quot;, and the smaller, narrower-winged species &quot;plovers&quot; or &quot;dotterels&quot;. Until recently, it was thought these formed two major clear taxonomic sub-groups, with lapwings belong to the subfamily Vanellinae, and all but one of the plovers and dotterels to Charadriinae; the last one placed in a small third subfamily Pluvianellinae containing only the Magellanic plover. Modern genetic evidence has however shown that this arrangement was polyphyletic, with in particular, many species traditionally placed in the plover genus &quot;Charadrius&quot; proving more closely related to the lapwings than they were to the type species of that genus, &quot;Charadrius hiaticula&quot;; as a result, those species have now been split out into the genus &quot;Anarhynchus&quot; (syn. &quot;Ochthodromus&quot;). The third former &#x27;subfamily&#x27; proved so completely unrelated to the other plovers that it has been removed from the Charadriidae altogether and given its own monotypic family Pluvianellidae, its closest relatives being the strikingly different sheathbills.

The trend in recent years has been to rationalise the common names of the Charadriidae. For example, the large and very common Australian bird traditionally known as the &#x27;spur-winged plover&#x27;, is now the masked lapwing to avoid conflict with another bird with the same name; and the former &#x27;sociable plover&#x27; is now the sociable lapwing.

==Description==
They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short, thick necks and long, usually pointed, wings, but most species of lapwing have broader, more rounded wings. Their bill are usually straight (except for the wrybill) and short, their toes are short, hind toe can be reduced or absent, depending on species. Most Charadriidae also have relatively short tails, with the exception of the killdeer. In most genera, the sexes are similar, very little sexual dimorphism occurs between sexes. They range in size from the collared plover, at 26 grams and , to the masked lapwing, at and .

==Distribution and habitat==
They are distributed through open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water, although there are some exceptions: the inland dotterel, for example, prefers stony ground in the deserts of central and western Australia, and the killdeer is often found in grasslands in North America.

==Behaviour and ecology==
They hunt by sight, rather than by feel as longer-billed waders like snipe do. Foods eaten include aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates such as insects, worms, molluscs and crustaceans depending on habitat, and are usually obtained by a run-and-pause technique, rather than the steady probing of some other wader groups. They also feed on plant material.

===Breeding===
The vast majority of Charadriidae have a socially monogamous mating system. Some, such as Northern lapwings, are polygynous, others, such as mountain plovers have a rapid multiple-clutch system that can be accompanied by sequential polyandry. In Eurasian dotterels, females compete for males and males provide all parental care. While breeding, they defend their territories with highly visible aerial displays.

Charadridae lay two to four eggs into the nest, which is usually a shallow scrape in the open ground, and incubate the clutch for 21–30 days. In species where both parents incubate the eggs, females and males vary in the way they share their incubation duties, both within and between species. In some pairs, parents exchange on the nest in the morning and in the evening so that their incubation rhythm follows 24-hour day, in others females and males exchange up to 20 times a day.

Most Charadriidae are protective over their eggs and offspring. The parents protect their young by uttering an alarm call, performing distraction display and they may even attack the predator or intruder. The chicks are precocial; their parents do not feed them.

<doc id="263328" wikidata="Q396808" url="?curid=263328" title="Princeps">
<text>Princeps (plural: &quot;Principes&quot;) is a Latin word meaning &quot;first in time or order; the first, foremost, chief, the most eminent, distinguished, or noble; the first person&quot;. As a title, &quot;Princeps&quot; originated in the Roman Republic wherein the leading member of the Senate was designated &quot;princeps senatus&quot;. It is primarily associated with the Roman emperors as an unofficial title first adopted by Augustus () in 23 BC. Its use in this context continued until the regime of Diocletian (r. 284 – 305 AD) at the end of the third century. He preferred the title of &quot;dominus&quot;, meaning &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;master&quot;. As a result, the Roman Empire from Augustus to Diocletian is termed the &quot;principate&quot; (&quot;principatus&quot;). Other historians define the reign of Augustus to Severus Alexander (r. 222 – 235) as the Principate, and the period afterwards as the &quot;Autocracy&quot;.

The medieval title &quot;Prince&quot; is a derivative of princeps, as is the title Principal.

== Roman military ==
* See Principes (legionary heavy infantry soldier)
* centurio(n) in command of a unit or administrative office.
* &quot;Princeps ordinarius vexillationis&quot;: centurion in command of a &quot;vexillatio&quot; (detachment).
* &quot;Princeps peregrinorum&quot; (&quot;commander of the foreigners&quot;): centurion in charge of troops in the &quot;castra peregrina&quot; (military base at Rome for personnel seconded from the provincial armies)
* &quot;Princeps prior&quot;: Centurion commanding a &quot;manipulus&quot; (unit of two centuries) of &quot;principes&quot; (legionary heavy infantry).
* &quot;Princeps posterior&quot;: deputy to the Princeps prior
* &quot;Princeps praetorii&quot; : centurion attached to headquarters.
&quot;Princeps&quot; was also used as the second part of various other military titles, such as &quot;Decurio princeps&quot;, Signifer princeps (among the standard-bearers). See also Principalis (as in &quot;Optio principalis&quot;): NCO.

== Roman administration ==

&quot;Princeps&quot; is also the (official) short version of Princeps officii, the chief of an officium (the office staff of a Roman dignitary).

== Roman Emperor ==

&quot;Princeps civitatis&quot; (&quot;First Citizen&quot;) was an official title of a Roman Emperor, as the title determining the leader in Ancient Rome at the beginning of the Roman Empire. It created the principate Roman imperial system.

This usage of &quot;Princeps&quot; derived from the position of &quot;Princeps senatus&quot;, the &quot;first among equals&quot; of the Senate. The &quot;princeps senatus&quot; (plural &quot;principes senatus&quot;) was the first member by precedence of the Roman Senate, and his opinion would usually be asked first in senatorial debates.

It was first given as a special title to Caesar Augustus in 27 BC, who saw that use of the titles &quot;rex&quot; (king) or dictator would create resentment amongst senators and other influential men, who had earlier demonstrated their disapproval by supporting the assassination of Julius Caesar. While Augustus had political and military supremacy, he needed the assistance of his fellow Romans to manage the Empire. In his &quot;Res Gestae&quot;, Augustus claims auctoritas for the princeps (himself).

Various official titles were associated with the Roman Emperor. These titles included &quot;imperator&quot;, Augustus, Caesar, and later dominus (lord) and basileus (the Greek word for &quot;sovereign&quot;). The word Emperor is derived from the Roman title &quot;imperator&quot;, which was a very high, but not exclusive, military title until Augustus began to use it as his praenomen.

The Emperor Diocletian (284–305), the father of the Tetrarchy, was the first to stop referring to himself as &quot;princeps&quot; altogether, calling himself &quot;dominus&quot; (lord, master), thus dropping the pretense that emperor was not truly a monarchical office. The period when the emperors that called themselves princeps ruled—from Augustus to Diocletian—is called &quot;the Principate&quot;.

Ancient Rome knew another kind of &quot;princely&quot; principes too, like &quot;princeps iuventutis&quot; (&quot;the first amongst the young&quot;), which in the early empire was frequently bestowed on eligible successors to the emperor, especially from his family. It was first given to Augustus&#x27; maternal grandsons Gaius and Lucius.

== Nobiliary legacy ==

&quot;Princeps&quot; is the root and Latin rendering of modern words as the English title and generic term &quot;prince&quot; (see that article, also for various equivalents in other languages), as the Byzantine version of Roman law was the basis for the legal terminology developed in feudal (and later absolutist) Europe.

== Non-Roman meaning ==

Princeps has been used in various scientific names, including the following:

* &quot;Princeps&quot;, a former genus of swallowtail butterflies now treated as a subgenus of &quot;Papilio&quot;

<text>The University of Bologna (, abbreviated Unibo) is a public research university in Bologna, Italy. Teaching began around 1088, with the university becoming organised as guilds of students () by the late 12th century, it is the oldest university in continuous operation in the world, and the first degree-awarding institution of higher learning. The university&#x27;s emblem carries the motto, &quot;Alma Mater Studiorum&quot; (&quot;Nourishing mother of studies&quot;), and the date &quot;A.D. 1088&quot;. With over 90,000 students, the University of Bologna is one of the largest universities in Europe. 

The university saw the first woman to earn a university degree and teach at a university, Bettisia Gozzadini, and the first woman to earn both a doctorate in science and a salaried position as a university professor, Laura Bassi. The University of Bologna has had a central role in the sciences during the medieval age and the Italian renaissance, where it housed and educated Nicholas Copernicus as well as numerous other renaissance mathematicians. It has educated a wide range of notable alumni, amongst them a large number of Italian scientists, prime ministers, supreme court judges, and priests.

The University of Bologna has campuses in Cesena, Forlì, Ravenna and Rimini as well as branch centres abroad in Buenos Aires, New York, Brussels, and Shanghai. It houses the fully funded boarding college &quot;Collegio Superiore di Bologna,&quot; the Bologna School of Advanced Studies, the botanical gardens of Bologna, a large number of museums, libraries and archeological collections, as well as the Bologna University Press.

== History ==

The date of the University of Bologna&#x27;s founding is uncertain. The university was granted a charter (&quot;Authentica habita&quot;) by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa in 1158, but in the 19th century, a committee of historians led by Giosuè Carducci traced the founding of the university back to 1088, which would make it the oldest continuously operating university in the world. However, the development of the institution at Bologna into a university was a gradual process. Paul Grendler writes that &quot;it is not likely that enough instruction and organization existed to merit the term &quot;university&quot; before the 1150s, and it might not have happened before the 1180s.&quot;

The university arose around mutual aid societies (known as &quot;universitates scholarium&quot;) of foreign students called &quot;nations&quot; (as they were grouped by nationality) for protection against city laws which imposed collective punishment on foreigners for the crimes and debts of their countrymen. These students then hired scholars from the city&#x27;s pre-existing lay and ecclesiastical schools to teach them subjects such as liberal arts, notarial law, theology, and &quot;ars dictaminis&quot; (scrivenery). The lectures were given in informal schools called &quot;scholae&quot;. In time the various &quot;universitates scholarium&quot; decided to form a larger association, or &quot;Studium&quot;—thus, the university. The &quot;Studium&quot; grew to have a strong position of collective bargaining with the city, since by then it derived significant revenue through visiting foreign students, who would depart if they were not well treated. The foreign students in Bologna received greater rights, and collective punishment was ended. There was also collective bargaining with the scholars who served as professors at the university. By the initiation or threat of a student strike, the students could enforce their demands as to the content of courses and the pay professors would receive. University professors were hired, fired, and had their pay determined by an elected council of two representatives from every student &quot;nation&quot; which governed the institution, with the most important decisions requiring a majority vote from all the students to ratify. The professors could also be fined if they failed to finish classes on time, or complete course material by the end of the semester. A student committee, the &quot;Denouncers of Professors&quot;, kept tabs on them and reported any misbehavior. Professors themselves were not powerless, however, forming &quot;collegia doctorum&quot; (professors&#x27; committees) in each faculty, and securing the rights to set examination fees and degree requirements. Eventually, the city ended this arrangement, paying professors from tax revenues and making it a chartered public university.
The university is historically notable for its teaching of canon and civil law; indeed, it was set up in large part with the aim of studying the &quot;Digest,&quot; a central text in Roman law, which had been rediscovered in Italy in 1070, and the university was central in the development of medieval Roman law. Until modern times, the only degree granted at that university was the doctorate.

Bettisia Gozzadini earned a law degree in 1237, being one of the first women in history to obtain a university degree. She taught law from her own home for two years, and in 1239 she taught at the university, becoming the first woman in history to teach at a university.

In 1477, when Pope Sixtus IV issued a papal bull, authorizing the creation of Uppsala University in Sweden, the bull specified that the new university would have the same freedoms and privileges as the University of Bologna—a highly desirable situation for the Swedish scholars. This included the right of Uppsala to establish the four traditional faculties of theology, law (Canon Law and Roman law), medicine, and philosophy, and to award the bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, licentiate, and doctoral degrees.

Laura Bassi was born into a prosperous family of Bologna and was privately educated from the age of five. Bassi&#x27;s education and intellect was noticed by Prospero Lorenzini Lambertini, who became the Archbishop of Bologna in 1731 (later Pope Benedict XIV). Lambertini became the official patron of Bassi. He arranged for a public debate between Bassi and four professors from the University of Bologna on 17 April 1732. In 1732, Bassi, aged twenty, publicly defended her forty-nine theses on &quot;Philosophica Studia&quot; at the Sala degli Anziani of the Palazzo Pubblico. The University of Bologna awarded her a doctorate degree on 12 May. She became the first woman to receive a doctorate in science, and the second woman in the world to earn a philosophy doctorate after Elena Cornaro Piscopia in 1678, fifty-four years prior. She was by then popularly known as Bolognese Minerva. On 29 October 1732, the Senate and the University of Bologna granted Bassi&#x27;s candidature, and in December she was appointed professor of natural philosophy to teach physics. She became the first salaried woman lecturer in the world, thus beginning her academic career. She was also the first woman member of any scientific establishment, when she was elected to the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna in 1732. Bassi became the most important populariser of Newtonian mechanics in Italy.

In 1971, the Hellenist Benedetto Marzullo in company with Umberto Eco, Renato Barilli, Adelio Ferrero. instituted within the Faculty of Letters and Arts the DAMS (acronym of &quot;discipline delle arti, della musica e dello spettacolo&quot;, &quot;Dicipline of Arts, Musics and Performance&quot;). It was the first degree course of this type to be opened in Italy. Between December 26, 1982, and November 29, 1983, there occurred the DAMS murders (in Italian: &quot;Delitti del DAMS&quot;), dealing with four victims who were students or professors of the DAMS: Angelo Fabbri (a brilliant student of Umberto Eco), Liviana Rossi, the dancer Francesca Alinovi (who was stabbed for 47 times), and Leonarda Polvani.

==Organization==


Higher education processes are being harmonised across the European Community. Nowadays the university offers 101 different &quot;&quot;Laurea&quot; or &quot;Laurea breve&quot; first-level degrees (three years of courses), followed by 108 &quot;Laurea specialistica&quot; or &quot;Laurea magistrale&quot; second-level degrees (two years). However 11 other courses have maintained the previous rules of &quot;Laurea specialistica a ciclo unico&quot; or &quot;Laurea magistrale a ciclo unico&quot;, with only one cycle of study of five years, except for medicine and dentistry, which require six years of courses. After the &quot;Laurea&quot;&quot; one may attain first-level Master (one-year diploma, similar to a postgraduate diploma). After second-level degrees are attained, one may proceed to second-level Master, specialisation schools (residency) or research doctorates (PhD).

The 11 Schools (which replace the existing 23 faculties) are:
* School of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine
* School of Economics, Management and Statistics
* School of Engineering and Architecture
* School of Foreign Languages and Literature, Interpreting and Translation
* School of Law
* School of Arts, Humanities, and Cultural Heritage
* School of Medicine and Surgery
* School of Pharmacy, Biotechnologies and Sport Sciences
* School of Political Sciences
* School of Psychology and Education Sciences
* School of Sciences

The university is structured in 33 departments (66 until 2012), organized by homogeneous research domains that integrate activities related to one or more faculty. A new department of Latin history was added in 2015.

The 33 departments are:
* Architecture - DA

==Affiliates and other institutions==
===Il Mulino===
In the early 1950s, some students of the University of Bologna were among the founders of the review &quot;il Mulino&quot;. On 25 April 1951 the first issue of the review was published in Bologna. In a short time, &quot;il Mulino&quot; became one of the most interesting reference points in Italy for the political and cultural debate and established important editorial relationships in Italy and abroad. Editorial activities evolved along with the review. In 1954, the il Mulino publishing house (It. &quot;Società editrice il Mulino&quot;) was founded, which today represents one of the most relevant Italian publishers. In addition to this were initiated research projects (focusing mostly on the educational institutions and the political system in Italy), that eventually led, in 1964, to the establishment of the Istituto Carlo Cattaneo.

===Collegio Superiore===
The &quot;Collegio Superiore&quot; is an excellence institution inside the University of Bologna, aimed at promoting students&#x27; merit through dedicated learning programmes.

The institution was founded in 1998 as &quot;Collegio d&#x27;Eccellenza&quot;. Together with the Institute for Advanced Study it is part of the Institute for Higher Study.

The Collegio Superiore offers an additional educational path to students enrolled in a degree programme at the University of Bologna, providing specialized courses as part of an interdisciplinary framework.

All students of the Collegio Superiore are granted a full-ride scholarship and additional benefits such as the assistance of a personal tutor and free accommodation at the Residence for Higher Study. In order to remain members of the Collegio Superiore students are required to maintain high marks in both their degree programme and the additional courses.

Beatrice Fraboni, professor of Physics of Matter, has been head of Collegio Superiore since 2019.

<text>The tapaculos or tapacolos are a family, Rhinocryptidae, of small suboscine passerine birds, found mainly in South America and with the highest diversity in the Andean regions. Three species (Chocó, Tacarcuna, and the silvery-fronted) are found in southern Central America.

==Description==

Tapaculos are small to medium-sized birds, with a total length ranging from 10–24 cm (4–9½ in). These are terrestrial species that fly only poorly on their short wings. They have strong legs, well-suited to their habitat of grassland or forest undergrowth. The tail is cocked and pointed towards the head, and the name &quot;tapaculo&quot; probably derives from Spanish for loincloth. Another possible explanation is that it originates from the Chilean name for the white-throated tapaculo, simply &quot;tapaculo&quot;, which is an onomatopoeic reference to its commonly heard song.

While the majority of the family are small blackish or brown birds there are some larger and more colourful species. All tapaculos are skulking birds that frequently stay low in dense vegetation, even the larger, colorful species, and this renders them difficult to see. They are best located and – in the case of &quot;Scytalopus&quot; spp. – identified by their vocalisations.

They feed on insects, seeds and other soft plant material with their pointed bills, and will scratch on the ground like a pheasant.
Most species lay two or three white eggs in a covered location, whether it be a burrow, a hole in a tree, or a domed nest.

==Status and conservation==
Some species have highly localized distributions and, being poor fliers, they easily become isolated in small populations. BirdLife International currently (2007) consider one species vulnerable (&quot;Scytalopus panamensis&quot;), three species endangered (&quot;S. iraiensis&quot;, &quot;S. rodriguezi&quot; and &quot;S. robbinsi&quot;), and two species critically endangered (&quot;Eleoscytalopus psychopompus&quot; and &quot;Merulaxis stresemanni&quot;). The two critically endangered species are restricted to Atlantic forest of eastern Brazil, and were only recently rediscovered after several years without any records.

==Taxonomy==

The tapaculos were traditionally placed in a distinct family Rhinocryptidae; more recent research indicates that according to analysis of mt and nDNA sequence data, the tapaculos might be better merged into the Formicariidae as tribe Rhinocryptini, as they are closer to the antthrushes than either is to the true antpittas.

An alternative family name Pteroptochidae, has been used historically.

The phylogenetic tree shown below is based on a large-scale genetic study of the suboscines by Michael Harvey and collaborators that was published in 2020. The species numbers are from the list maintained by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC).

The species-limits within the genus &quot;Scytalopus&quot; have historically been difficult to determine. The birds are highly cryptic, and identification using visual features often is impossible. Vocal and biochemical data is typically needed to clarify the taxonomic status of the various populations. Several new species have been described in recent years (e.g. &quot;S. whitneyi&quot; and &quot;S. frankeae&quot; from Peru). The Brazilian taxa are similarly complex with several recently described species and considerable confusion surrounding the use of the scientific name &quot;Scytalopus speluncae&quot;.

Additionally, still undescribed species are known to exist, while some species as currently defined actually may include several species (e.g. the southern population of the large-footed tapaculo may represent a yet undescribed species). The confusing situation is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that only ten species were recognized in this genus in 1970, while the figure now is more than four times as high.

<text>A model is an informative representation of an object, person, or system. The term originally denoted the plans of a building in late 16th-century English, and derived via French and Italian ultimately from Latin , .

Models can be divided into physical models (e.g. a ship model or a fashion model) and abstract models (e.g. a set of mathematical equations describing the workings of the atmosphere for the purpose of weather forecasting). Abstract or conceptual models are central to philosophy of science.

In scholarly research and applied science, a model should not be confused with a theory: while a model seeks only to represent reality with the purpose of better understanding or predicting the world, a theory is more ambitious in that it claims to be an explanation of reality.

==&quot;Model&quot; in specific contexts==
As a noun, &quot;model&quot; has specific meanings in certain fields, derived from its original meaning of &quot;structural design or layout&quot;:
* Model (art), a person posing for an artist, e.g. a 15th-century criminal representing the biblical Judas in Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s painting &quot;The Last Supper&quot;
* Model (person), a person who serves as a template for others to copy, as in a role model, often in the context of advertising commercial products; e.g. the first &quot;fashion model&quot;, Marie Vernet Worth in 1853, wife of designer Charles Frederick Worth.

* Model (product), a particular design of a product as displayed in a catalogue or show room (e.g. Ford Model T, an early car model)
* Model (organism) a non-human species that is studied to understand biological phenomena in other organisms, e.g. a guinea pig starved of vitamin C to study scurvy, an experiment that would be immoral to conduct on a person
* Model (mimicry), a species that is mimicked by another species
* Model (logic), a structure (a set of items, such as natural numbers 1, 2, 3..., along with mathematical operations such as addition and multiplication, and relations, such as formula_1) that satisfies a given system of axioms (basic truisms), i.e. that satisfies the statements of a given theory
* Model (CGI), a mathematical representation of any surface of an object in three dimensions via specialized software

A physical model (most commonly referred to simply as a model but in this context distinguished from a conceptual model) is a smaller or larger physical representation of an object, person or system. The object being modelled may be small (e.g., an atom) or large (e.g., the Solar System) or life-size (e.g., a fashion model displaying clothes for similarly-built potential customers). 

The geometry of the model and the object it represents are often similar in the sense that one is a rescaling of the other. However, in many cases the similarity is only approximate or even intentionally distorted. Sometimes the distortion is systematic, e.g., a fixed scale horizontally and a larger fixed scale vertically when modelling topography to enhance a region&#x27;s mountains.

An architectural model permits visualization of internal relationships within the structure or external relationships of the structure to the environment. Another use is as a toy.

Instrumented physical models are an effective way of investigating fluid flows for engineering design. Physical models are often coupled with computational fluid dynamics models to optimize the design of equipment and processes. This includes external flow such as around buildings, vehicles, people, or hydraulic structures. Wind tunnel and water tunnel testing is often used for these design efforts. Instrumented physical models can also examine internal flows, for the design of ductwork systems, pollution control equipment, food processing machines, and mixing vessels. Transparent flow models are used in this case to observe the detailed flow phenomenon. These models are scaled in terms of both geometry and important forces, for example, using Froude number or Reynolds number scaling (see Similitude). In the pre-computer era, the UK economy was modelled with the hydraulic model MONIAC, to predict for example the effect of tax rises on employment. 
==Conceptual model==

A conceptual model is a theoretical representation of a system, e.g. a set of mathematical equations attempting to describe the workings of the atmosphere for the purpose of weather forecasting. It consists of concepts used to help understand or simulate a subject the model represents. 

Abstract or conceptual models are central to philosophy of science, as almost every scientific theory effectively embeds some kind of model of the physical or human sphere. In some sense, a physical model &quot;is always the reification of some conceptual model; the conceptual model is conceived ahead as the blueprint of the physical one&quot;, which is then constructed as conceived. Thus, the term refers to models that are formed after a conceptualization or generalization process. 

===Examples===
* Conceptual model (computer science), an agreed representation of entities and their relationships, to assist in developing software
* Economic model, a theoretical construct representing economic processes
* Language model a probabilistic model of a natural language, used for speech recognition, language generation, and information retrieval
** Large language models are artificial neural networks used for generative artificial intelligence (AI), e.g. ChatGPT 
* Mathematical model, a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language
** Statistical model, a mathematical model that usually specifies the relationship between one or more random variables and other non-random variables
** Model (CGI), a mathematical representation of any surface of an object in three dimensions via specialized software
* Medical model, a proposed &quot;set of procedures in which all doctors are trained&quot;
* Mental model, in psychology, an internal representation of external reality
* Model (logic), a set along with a collection of finitary operations, and relations that are defined on it, satisfying a given collection of axioms
* Model (MVC), information-representing component of a software, distinct from the user interface (the &quot;view&quot;), both linked by the &quot;controller&quot; component, in the context of the model–view–controller software design
* Model act, a law drafted centrally to be disseminated and proposed for enactment in multiple independent legislatures
* Standard model (disambiguation)

==Properties of models, according to general model theory==
According to Herbert Stachowiak, a model is characterized by at least three properties:

; 1. Mapping
: A model always is a model &quot;of something&quot;—it is an image or representation of some natural or artificial, existing or imagined original, where this original itself could be a model.
; 2. Reduction
: In general, a model will not include all attributes that describe the original but only those that appear relevant to the model&#x27;s creator or user.
; 3. Pragmatism
: A model does not relate unambiguously to its original. It is intended to work as a replacement for the original
: a) for certain subjects &quot;(for whom?)&quot;
: b) within a certain time range &quot;(when?)&quot;
: c) restricted to certain conceptual or physical actions &quot;(what for?)&quot;.

For example, a street map is a model of the actual streets in a city (mapping), showing the course of the streets while leaving out, say, traffic signs and road markings (reduction), made for pedestrians and vehicle drivers for the purpose of finding one&#x27;s way in the city (pragmatism).

Additional properties have been proposed, like &quot;extension&quot; and &quot;distortion&quot; as well as &quot;validity&quot;. The American philosopher Michael Weisberg differentiates between concrete and mathematical models and proposes computer simulations (computational models) as their own class of models.

<text>The title of imperator ( ) originally meant the rough equivalent of &quot;commander&quot; under the Roman Republic. Later, it became a part of the titulature of the Roman Emperors as their praenomen. The Roman emperors generally based their authority on multiple titles and positions, rather than preferring any single title. Nevertheless, &quot;imperator&quot; was used relatively consistently as an element of a Roman ruler&#x27;s title throughout the Principate and the later Roman Empire. It was abbreviated to &quot;IMP&quot; in inscriptions. The word derives from the stem of the verb , meaning &#x27;to order, to command&#x27;. The English word &quot;emperor&quot; derives from &quot;imperator&quot; via .

== &quot;Imperatores&quot; in the ancient Roman Kingdom ==
When Rome was ruled by kings,
to be able to rule, the king had to be invested with the full regal authority and power. So, after the comitia curiata that was held to elect the king, the king also had to be conferred the imperium.

== &quot;Imperatores&quot; in the Roman Republic ==
In Roman Republican literature and epigraphy, an imperator was a magistrate with imperium. During the later Roman Republic and during the late Republican civil wars, &quot;imperator&quot; mainly was the honorific title assumed by certain military commanders. After an especially great victory, an army&#x27;s troops in the field would proclaim their commander &quot;imperator&quot;, an acclamation necessary for a general to apply to the Senate for a triumph. After being acclaimed &quot;imperator&quot;, the victorious general had a right to use the title after his name until the time of his triumph, where he would relinquish the title as well as his imperium.

Since a triumph was the goal of many politically ambitious commanders, republican history is full of cases where legions were bribed to call their commander &quot;imperator&quot;. The title of &quot;imperator&quot; was given firstly to Aemilius Paulus in 189 BC, for his campaigns against the Lusitanians from 191–89 BC. Next, it was given to Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 95 BC as governor or pro consul of the Cilician province for his returning of Ariobarzanes I to the Cappadocia throne. Then in 90 BC to Lucius Julius Caesar, in 84 BC to Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, in 60 BC to Gaius Julius Caesar, relative of the previously mentioned Lucius Julius Caesar, during the 50s BC to Gaius Julius Caesar (in Gaul), in 45 BC again to Gaius Julius Caesar, in 43 BC to Decimus Junius Brutus, and in 41 BC to Lucius Antonius (younger brother and ally of the more famous Marcus Antonius). In AD 15 Germanicus was also &quot;imperator&quot; during the empire (see below) of his adoptive father Tiberius.

== &quot;Imperator&quot; as an imperial title ==
After Augustus established the Roman Empire, the title &quot;imperator&quot; was generally restricted to the emperor, although in the early years of the empire it would occasionally be granted to a member of his family. As a permanent title, &quot;imperator&quot; was used as a praenomen by the Roman emperors and was taken on accession. After the reign of Tiberius, the act of being proclaimed imperator was transformed into the act of imperial accession. In fact, if a general was acclaimed by his troops as &quot;imperator&quot;, it would be tantamount to a declaration of rebellion against the ruling emperor. At first the term continued to be used in the Republican sense as a victory title, but attached to the &quot;de facto&quot; monarch and head of state, rather than the commander of the military. The title then followed the emperor&#x27;s name along with the number of times he was acclaimed as such, for example &quot;IMP V&quot; (&quot;imperator five times&quot;). In time it became the title of the &quot;de facto&quot; monarch, pronounced upon (and synonymous with) their assumption.

As a title &quot;imperator&quot; was generally translated into Greek as &quot;autokrator&quot; (&quot;one who rules oneself,&quot; also sometimes used as a translation for &quot;Roman dictators&quot;). This was necessarily imprecise as it lost the nuances of Latin political thought contrasting &quot;imperium&quot; with other forms of public authority. Nevertheless, this title (along with &quot;sebastos&quot; for &quot;augustus&quot;) was used in Greek-language texts for Roman emperors from the establishment of the empire.

In the east, the title continued to be used into the Byzantine period, although to a lesser, and much more ceremonial extent. In most Byzantine writings, the Greek translation &quot;Autokrator&quot; is preferred, but &quot;Imperator&quot; makes an appearance in Constantine IV&#x27;s mid seventh century mosaic in the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Apollinare in Classe, and on various ninth century lead seals.

== Use in eastern Rome and other post-Roman states ==
After the Roman empire collapsed in the West in the fifth century, Latin continued to be used as the official language of the Eastern Roman Empire. The Roman emperors of this period (historiographically referred to as Byzantine emperors) were referred to as &quot;imperatores&quot; in Latin texts, while the word &quot;basileus&quot; (king) and &quot;autokrator&quot; (emperor) were used in Greek.

After 800, the &quot;imperator&quot; was used (in conjunction with &quot;augustus&quot;) as a formal Latin title in succession by the Carolingian and German Holy Roman Emperors until 1806 and by the Austrian Emperors until 1918.

In medieval Spain, the title &quot;imperator&quot; was used under a variety of circumstances from the ninth century onward, but its use peaked, as a formal and practical title, between 1086 and 1157. It primarily was used by the Kings of León and Castile, but it also found currency in the Kingdom of Navarre and was employed by the Counts of Castile and at least one Duke of Galicia. It signalled at various points the king&#x27;s equality with the Byzantine Emperor and Holy Roman Emperor, his rule by conquest or military superiority, his rule over several people groups ethnic or religious, and his claim to suzerainty over the other kings of the peninsula, both Christian and Muslim.

Beginning in 1077, Alfonso instituted the use of the style &quot;ego Adefonsus imperator totius Hispaniae&quot; (&quot;I, Alfonso, emperor of all Spain&quot;) and its use soon became regular. This title was used throughout the period 1079–81, which represents the peak of his imperial pretensions before his capture of the city of Toledo, ancient capital of the Visigoths. In 1080, he introduced the form &quot;ego Adefonsus Hispaniarum imperator&quot; (&quot;I, Alfonso, emperor of the Spains&quot;), which he used again in 1090. His most elaborate imperial title was &quot;ego Adefonsus imperator totius Castelle et Toleto necnon et Nazare seu Alave&quot; (&quot;I, Alfonso, emperor of all Castile and of Toledo also and of Nájera, or Álava&quot;).

After the Ottoman Empire conquered both the Balkan peninsula (Rumeli in Turkish meaning &quot;lands of Rome&quot;) and Constantinople, the Turkish ruler acclaimed to be the Caesar of Rome (&quot;sultan-ı iklim-i Rûm&quot;). In the fifteenth century Bayezid II established diplomatic relations with some Christian European states, and sent a document to the King of Poland in which he used the titles &quot;Sultan Dei gratia Asie, Grecie etc. Imperator Maximus&quot; (&quot;with help of God, emperor of Asia and Greece&quot;). Like his predecessor, Selim I titled himself imperator in diplomatic correspondence (&quot;per la Divina favente clementia Grande Imperator di Constantinopoli, di Asia, Europa, Persia, Syria et Egypto et Arabia et de li mari etc.&quot;) due to his military successes.

== &quot;Imperatrix&quot; ==
The term imperatrix seems not to have been used in Ancient Rome to indicate the wife of an imperator or later, of an emperor. In the early years of the Roman Empire there was no standard title or honorific for the emperor&#x27;s wife, even the &quot;Augusta&quot; honorific was rather exceptionally granted, and not exclusively to wives of living emperors.

It is not clear when the feminine form of the Latin term &quot;imperator&quot; originated or was used for the first time. It usually indicates a &quot;reigning&quot; monarch, and is thus used in the Latin version of titles of modern reigning empresses.

When Fortuna is identified &quot;imperatrix mundi&quot; in the &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;, the term describes the Goddess Fortune, or a personification of her, it is as the &quot;ruler of the world&quot;.

The word &quot;imperatrix&quot;, which did not exist in Latin, is deployed by Cicero for Clodia in 56 BC; only in the mid-fifth century AD is Pulcheria Augusta also imperatrix.

In Christian context, &quot;Imperatrix&quot; became a laudatory address to the Virgin Mary, in diverse forms at least since the Middle Ages — for example, she is sometimes called &quot;Imperatrix angelorum&quot; (&quot;ruler of the angels&quot;).

== Derivatives ==
&quot;Imperator&quot; is the root for the word for emperor of most Romance languages. It is the root of the English word &quot;emperor&quot;, which entered the language via the French &quot;empereur&quot;, while related adjectives such as &quot;imperial&quot; were imported into English directly from Latin.

<text>The Union Banking Corporation (UBC) was a New York investment bank incorporated in 1924 in the United States. During World War II, under the U.S. Trading with the Enemy Act, the United States government seized the bank&#x27;s assets pending investigation of the bank&#x27;s business involving a former party member of the Nazi government in Germany, Fritz Thyssen. The now-former U.S. Senator Prescott Bush was a founding member and is included among its seven directors whose entire collective shareholdings in Union Banking Corp. were shares wholly owned by, and held on behalf of, the Thyssen empire&#x27;s Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart in Rottendam. [1]

== Seizure ==
According to an October 5, 1942 report from the Office of Alien Property Custodian, Union Banking was owned by Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V., a Dutch bank. The memo from August 18, 1941, states &quot;My investigation produced no evidence as to the ownership of this Dutch bank.&quot;

The Dutch bank was alleged to be affiliated with United Steel Works, a German company. Fritz Thyssen and his brother, Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, had the Dutch bank and the steel firm as part of their business and financial empire according to the government agency. Fritz Thyssen resigned from the Council of State after November 9, 1938 &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, was arrested in 1940, and spent the remainder of the war in a sanatorium and in concentration camps. The APC documents say &quot;Whether any or all part of the funds held by Union Banking Corporation, or companies associated with it, belong to Fritz Thyssen could not be established in this investigation.&quot; The assets were held by the government for the duration of the war, then returned afterward; UBC dissolved in the 1950s.

<text>The merger of four major firms into the German Steel Trust (Vereinigte Stahlwerke) in 1926 was modeled on the U.S. Steel corporation in the U.S. The goal was to move beyond the limitations of the old cartel system by incorporating advances simultaneously inside a single corporation. The new company emphasized rationalization of management structures and modernization of the technology; it employed a multi-divisional structure and used return on investment as its measure of success. it represented the &quot;Americanization&quot; of the German steel industry because of its internal structure, management methods, use of technology, and emphasis on mass production replicated the Steel Trust developed a multi-divisional structure and aimed at return on investment as a measure of success. The chief difference was that consumer capitalism as an industrial strategy did not seem plausible to German steel industrialists.

<doc id="263364" wikidata="Q27042" url="?curid=263364" title="Recurvirostridae">
<text>The Recurvirostridae are a family of birds in the wader suborder Charadrii. It contains two distinct groups of birds, the avocets (one genus) and the stilts (two genera).

==Description==
Avocets and stilts range in length from and in weight from ; males are usually slightly bigger than females. All possess long, thin legs, necks, and bills. The bills of avocets are curved upwards, and are swept from side to side when the bird is feeding in the brackish or saline wetlands they prefer. The bills of stilts, in contrast, are straight. The front toes are webbed, partially in most stilts, and fully in avocets and the banded stilt, which swim more. The majority of species&#x27; plumage has contrasting areas of black and white, with some species having patches of buff or brown on the head or chest. The sexes are similar.

Their vocalizations are usually yelps of one or two syllables.

==Distribution and habitat==
Avocets and stilts are a cosmopolitan family, being distributed on all the world&#x27;s continents except Antarctica, and occurring on several oceanic islands. Several species are wide-ranging and a few are locally distributed.

One species, the black stilt of New Zealand, is critically endangered due to habitat loss, introduced predators, and hybridisation with the pied stilt.

==Feeding==
These species feed on small aquatic animals such as mollusks, brine shrimp and other crustaceans, larval insects, segmented worms, tadpoles, and small fish.

==Breeding==
Stilts and avocets breed on open ground near water, often in loose colonies. They defend nesting territories vigorously with aggressive displays, and mob intruders and possible predators with a great deal of noise. They are monogamous, although the pair bonds are not maintained from season to season. Their eggs are light-coloured with dark markings, weighing . Three to four are laid in simple nests, and both parents share the incubation duties, which last 22 to 28 days. The banded stilt may breed only every few years, as it breeds on temporary lakes caused by rains in the deserts of Australia. The chicks are downy and precocial, leaving the nest within a day of hatching; they fledge in 28 to 35 days. In all species except the banded stilt, the chicks are cared for by the parents for several months, and they may move them to new areas and defend territories there. Banded stilts deviate from this by collecting their chicks in massive crèches numbering several hundred.

==Taxonomy==
The taxonomy of the stilts is particularly debated, with the genus &quot;Himantopus&quot; considered to have two to six species.

<text>Marine Corps Air Station Yuma or MCAS Yuma is a United States Marine Corps air station in Arizona. It is the home of multiple squadrons of F-35B Lightning IIs of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron 1 (MAWTS-1), Marine Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron 1 (VMX-1) and Marine Fighter Training Squadron 401 (VMFT-401), an air combat adversary squadron of the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing of the Marine Corps Reserve. It is a designated Superfund site due to a number of soil and groundwater contaminants, including asbestos.

The station is from the city of Yuma, Arizona. A joint use civilian-military airport, MCAS Yuma shares airfield facilities with Yuma International Airport and occupies approximately , most of which is flat desert. MCAS Yuma also operates an auxiliary airfield on the Barry M. Goldwater Range.
==History==

===Air Force use===
In 1928, the federal government purchased near Yuma at the recommendation of Colonel Benjamin F. Fly. Temporary dirt runways were installed for usage by military and civilian planes. It was called &quot;Fly Field&quot;.

The outbreak of World War II transformed the civilian airport into the Yuma Army Airfield. Construction of facilities began on 1 June 1942 and was activated on 15 December

Yuma AAF was a single-engine flight training school, operated by the Army Air Forces Flying Training Command, West Coast Training Center, later Western Flying Training Command. Flying training began in January 1943. Its training unit was the 307th Single Engine Flying Training Group which operated AT-6 Texans, reporting to the 37th Flying Training Wing. The base operating unit was the 403d Army Air Force Base Unit. In 1944, the unit was upgraded to multi-engine flight training, operating B-26 Marauders. In addition to the flying training, a Flexible Gunnery School was established at the airfield in November 1943. Flight training was discontinued on 23 April 1945 and gunnery training on 31 May 1945.

The base was closed on 1 November 1945. After the war, the airfield was turned over to the Department of the Interior as a headquarters for the Bureau of Land Reclamation.

On 1 January 1954, Yuma County Airport was reactivated by the United States Air Force (USAF) Air Defense Command (ADC) as a training facility. In the mid-1950s, ADC was equipped almost solely with rocket-firing F-86D Sabre and F-89C Scorpion interceptors, and Headquarters USAF decided they should have their own training base.

Yuma Airport became the home of the 4750th Training Wing (Air Defense). The 4750th had two major components, the 4750th Training Group (Air Defense) and the 4750th Training Squadron. The group had two flying squadrons assigned – the 4750th TS equipped with six F-86D Sabres and six F-94C Scorpions: and the 4750th Tow Target Squadron equipped with twelve T-33As and eight B-45As used to tow targets for the live fire portion of the course.
The first ADC squadron arrived at Yuma for the Rocketry Proficiency Program on 1 February 1954. ADC squadrons rotated through Yuma on a regular basis for a two-week proficiency program that included live-fire exercises over the Williams AFB and Luke AFB gunnery ranges.

The two-week course included a controller course, many hours in the F-86D simulator and at least one &#x27;live fire&#x27; mission flown each day. The targets, usually towed behind B-45A tow ships, were 9&#x27;x45&#x27; target sleeves, with two radar reflectors attached for the interceptor fire control systems to lock onto. Most of the TDY personnel were quartered in tents near the flight line, at least until April 1954 when the first permanent barracks buildings were finished and air conditioned. By June, seven ADC units had rotated through the Yuma program.

Also Headquarters USAF decided to add a separate air-to-air rocketry competition to the annual USAF gunnery meet that was held at Las Vegas Air Force Base (renamed &quot;Nellis Air Force Base&quot; in 1950). The Interceptor Phase of the competition would be held at Yuma between 20 June and 27 June 1954. The competition would take place each year, with the last occurring in 1956.

Several changes occurred during the last half of 1954. On 24 August, Yuma County Airport was redesignated Yuma Air Force Base. On 1 September, the 4750th Training Wing became the 4750th Air Defense Wing (Weapons). The 4750th Group and squadrons were also redesignated. And on 8 January 1955, the 4750th Tow Target Squadron became the 17th TTS. Between July 1954 and the end of the year, ADC rotated eleven more squadrons through the Yuma program – nine in F-86Ds, and one each in F-94Cs and F-89Ds.

On 1 January 1956, the 4750th Drone Squadron was established as part of the 4750th ADW (Weapons). They were equipped with the brand new Ryan Q-2A Firebee drone, which was launched from GB-26C Invader aircraft. Although the drones were in place by spring, the first GB-26Cs did not arrive until June, and the first Firebee flight took place in July. The Q-2A Firebees were recovered by H-21 helicopters after landing on the desert floor.

Yuma AFB was renamed on 13 October 1956 as Vincent Air Force Base, the installation was named for Brigadier General Clinton D. &quot;Casey&quot; Vincent, one of Major General Claire Chennault&#x27;s top fighter leaders in the China-Burma Theater and the second youngest General Officer in U.S. Air Force history, receiving his star at the age of 29. Vincent was the subject of a TIME magazine article titled &quot;Up Youth&quot;, which covered the meteoric promotions of the U.S. Army and USAF. Vincent was also an inspiration for the main character in the comic strip &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;. Vincent died of a heart attack in 1955 at the age of 40 while serving as the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Air Defense Command (ADC) at Ent AFB, Colorado.

In addition to the fighter units, Vincent AFB was used by Air Defense Command as a general surveillance radar station. The 864th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron began operations in 1956 using AN/MPS-7 and AN/MPS-14 radars, the site being designated as &quot;SM-162&quot;.

In addition to the main facility, Vincent AFB operated several AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites:

* Tacna, AZ (SM-162A): 
* Corn Springs, CA (SM-162B): 
* Stone Cabin, AZ (SM-162C): 
* Palo Verde, CA (SM-162D): 

&quot;Fleet Air Gunnery Unit Pacific&quot; was moved before 1 July 1958 to MCAAS YUMA from NAS El Centro, California.&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=D2RGAQAAMAAJ&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=A8_V2OxM-b0C&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Vincent AFB was transferred to the U.S. Navy on 1 Jan 1959, and the tenant radar site was renamed Yuma Air Force Station. On 20 July 1962, the base designation was changed to Marine Corps Air Station. In this time frame, the USAF began construction of a new Yuma AFS (RSM-162) about 13 miles south of Yuma. However, the replacement site was never completed, as, in March 1963, the Air Force ordered the 864th AC&amp;W Squadron to inactivate. Operations ceased 1 August 1963.

===Marine Corps use===

The 4750th Air Defense Wing was inactivated at Vincent AFB on 15 June 1959 and control of the base was passed over to the United States Navy. Nine days later the base was turned over to the United States Marine Corps (USMC). The base was renamed Marine Corps Air Station Yuma (Vincent Field) on 20 July 1962.

MCAS Yuma is currently the busiest air station in the Marine Corps, offering excellent year-round flying conditions and thousands of acres of open terrain for air-to-ground weapons ranges (including the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range and the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range- West), and associated restricted airspace for military flight operations. During the 1960s, 70s, and early 1980s, MCAS Yuma was home to VMFAT-101, the Marine Corps&#x27; Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) for the F-4 Phantom II, training USMC, U.S. Navy, and NATO/Allied flight crews and maintenance personnel in the F-4B, F-4J, F-4N, and F-4S. Following the transfer of VMFAT-101 to MCAS El Toro, California in the 1980s, MCAS Yuma became the principal Fleet Marine Force, Pacific operating base for the AV-8B Harrier II, under the cognizance of Marine Aircraft Group 13 (MAG-13).

Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron 1 (MAWTS-1) is a major aviation command at MCAS Yuma, conducting training for all Marine Corps tactical aviation units, most notably the Weapons and Tactics Instructor (WTI) course. Marine Fighter Training Squadron 401 (VMFT-401) is a Marine Air Reserve squadron also based at MCAS Yuma, containing both active duty and Selected Marine Corps Reservists, providing aerial adversary/aggressor services and dissimilar air combat training (DACT) for all U.S. military services, and selected NATO, Allied, and Coalition partners. This base was also used in the late 1980s and early 1990s as the Marine Corps Airborne Training Center.

MCAS Yuma is currently programmed to become the Marine Corps&#x27; initial operating base for the F-35B STOVL variant of the F-35 Lightning II, the first of which arrived on 16 November 2012.
