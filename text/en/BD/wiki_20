<text>The grade (US) or gradient (UK) (also called stepth, slope, incline, mainfall, pitch or rise) of a physical feature, landform or constructed line is either the elevation angle of that surface to the horizontal or its tangent. It is a special case of the slope, where zero indicates horizontality. A larger number indicates higher or steeper degree of &quot;tilt&quot;. Often slope is calculated as a ratio of &quot;rise&quot; to &quot;run&quot;, or as a fraction (&quot;rise over run&quot;) in which &quot;run&quot; is the horizontal distance (not the distance along the slope) and &quot;rise&quot; is the vertical distance.

Slopes of existing physical features such as canyons and hillsides, stream and river banks, and beds are often described as grades, but typically the word &quot;grade&quot; is used for human-made surfaces such as roads, landscape grading, roof pitches, railroads, aqueducts, and pedestrian or bicycle routes. The grade may refer to the longitudinal slope or the perpendicular cross slope.

==Nomenclature==
There are several ways to express slope:
# as an &quot;angle&quot; of inclination to the horizontal. (This is the angle opposite the &quot;rise&quot; side of a triangle with a right angle between vertical rise and horizontal run.)
# as a &quot;percentage&quot;, the formula for which is formula_1 which is equivalent to the tangent of the angle of inclination times 100. In Europe and the U.S. percentage &quot;grade&quot; is the most commonly used figure for describing slopes.
# as a &quot;per mille&quot; figure (denoted with the symbol ), the formula for which is formula_2 which could also be expressed as the tangent of the angle of inclination times 1000. This is commonly used in Europe to denote the incline of a railway. It is sometimes written as mm/m or m/km instead of the ‰ symbol.
# as a &quot;ratio&quot; of one part rise to so many parts run. For example, a slope that has a rise of 5 feet for every 1000 feet of run would have a slope ratio of 1 in 200. (The word &quot;in&quot; is normally used rather than the mathematical ratio notation of &quot;1:200&quot;.) This is generally the method used to describe railway grades in Australia and the UK. It is used for roads in Hong Kong, and was used for roads in the UK until the 1970s.
# as a &quot;ratio&quot; of many parts run to one part rise, which is the inverse of the previous expression (depending on the country and the industry standards). For example, &quot;slopes are expressed as ratios such as 4:1. This means that for every 4 units (feet or metres) of horizontal distance there is a 1 unit (foot or metre) vertical change either up or down.&quot;

Any of these may be used. Grade is usually expressed as a percentage - converted to the angle by taking the inverse tangent of the standard mathematical slope, which is rise / run or the grade / 100. If one looks at red numbers on the chart specifying grade, one can see the quirkiness of using the grade to specify slope; the numbers go from 0 for flat, to 100% at 45 degrees, to infinity as it approaches vertical.

Slope may still be expressed when the horizontal run is not known: the rise can be divided by the hypotenuse (the slope length). This is not the usual way to specify slope; this nonstandard expression follows the sine function rather than the tangent function, so it calls a 45 degree slope a 71 percent grade instead of a 100 percent. But in practice the usual way to calculate slope is to measure the distance along the slope and the vertical rise, and calculate the horizontal run from that, in order to calculate the grade (100% × rise/run) or standard slope (rise/run). When the angle of inclination is small, using the slope length rather than the horizontal displacement (i.e., using the sine of the angle rather than the tangent) makes only an insignificant difference and can then be used as an approximation. Railway gradients are often expressed in terms of the rise in relation to the distance along the track as a practical measure. In cases where the difference between sin and tan is significant, the tangent is used. In either case, the following identity holds for all inclinations up to 90 degrees:
formula_3. Or more simply, one can calculate the horizontal run by using the Pythagorean theorem, after which it is trivial to calculate the (standard math) slope or the grade (percentage).

In Europe, road gradients are signed as a percentage.

===Equations===
Grades are related using the following equations with symbols from the figure at top.

====Tangent as a ratio====
:formula_4

The slope expressed as a percentage can similarly be determined from the tangent of the angle:
:formula_5

====Angle from a tangent gradient====
:formula_6

If the tangent is expressed as a percentage, the angle can be determined as:
:formula_7

If the angle is expressed as a ratio &quot;(1 in n)&quot; then:
:formula_8

===Example slopes comparing the notations===

For degrees, percentage (%) and per-mille (‰) notations, larger numbers are steeper slopes. For ratios, larger numbers &quot;n&quot; of 1 in &quot;n&quot; are shallower, easier slopes.

The examples show round numbers in one or more of the notations and some documented and reasonably well known instances.

==Roads==
In vehicular engineering, various land-based designs (automobiles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, trains, etc.) are rated for their ability to ascend terrain. Trains typically rate much lower than automobiles. The highest grade a vehicle can ascend while maintaining a particular speed is sometimes termed that vehicle&#x27;s &quot;gradeability&quot; (or, less often, &quot;grade ability&quot;). The lateral slopes of a highway geometry are sometimes called fills or cuts where these techniques have been used to create them.

In the United States, the maximum grade for federally funded highways is specified in a design table based on terrain and design speeds, with up to 6% generally allowed in mountainous areas and hilly urban areas with exceptions for up to 7% grades on mountainous roads with speed limits below .

The steepest roads in the world according to the Guinness Book of World Records are Baldwin Street in Dunedin, New Zealand, Ffordd Pen Llech in Harlech, Wales and Canton Avenue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Guinness World Record once again lists Baldwin Street as the steepest street in the world, with a 34.8% grade (1 in 2.87) after a successful appeal against the ruling that handed the title, briefly, to Ffordd Pen Llech.

A number of streets elsewhere have steeper grades than those listed in the Guinness Book. Drawing on the U.S. National Elevation Dataset, 7x7 (magazine) identified ten blocks of public streets in San Francisco open to vehicular traffic in the city with grades over 30 percent. The steepest at 41 percent is the block of Bradford Street above Tompkins Avenue in the Bernal Heights neighborhood. The San Francisco Municipal Railway operates bus service among the city&#x27;s hills. The steepest grade for bus operations is 23.1% by the &quot;67-Bernal Heights&quot; on Alabama Street between Ripley and Esmeralda Streets.

Likewise, the Pittsburgh Department of Engineering and Construction recorded a grade of 37% (20°) for Canton Avenue. The street has formed part of a bicycle race since 1983.

==Environmental design==
Grade, pitch, and slope are important components in landscape design, garden design, landscape architecture, and architecture; for engineering and aesthetic design factors. Drainage, slope stability, circulation of people and vehicles, complying with building codes, and design integration are all aspects of slope considerations in environmental design.

==Railways==
Ruling gradients limit the load that a locomotive can haul, including the weight of the locomotive itself. Gradients are expressed as a ratio of vertical rise to horizontal distance; for example, a 1% gradient (1 in 100) means the track rises 1 vertical unit for every 100 horizontal units. On such a gradient, a locomotive can pull half (or less) of the load that it can pull on level track. (A heavily loaded train rolling at 20 km/h on heavy rail may require ten times the pull on a 1% upgrade that it does on the level at that speed.)

Early railways in the United Kingdom were laid out with very gentle gradients, such as 0.07575% (1 in 1320) and 0.1515% (1 in 660) on the Great Western main line, nicknamed Brunel&#x27;s Billiard Table, because the early locomotives (and their brakes) were feeble. Steep gradients were concentrated in short sections of lines where it was convenient to employ assistant engines or cable haulage, such as the section from Euston to Camden Town.

Extremely steep gradients require the use of cables (such as the Scenic Railway at Katoomba Scenic World, Australia, with a maximum grade of 122% (52°), claimed to be the world&#x27;s steepest passenger-carrying funicular) or some kind of rack railway (such as the Pilatus railway in Switzerland, with a maximum grade of 48% (26°), claimed to be the world&#x27;s steepest rack railway) to help the train ascend or descend.

Gradients can be expressed as an angle, as feet per mile, feet per chain, 1 in , % or per mille. Since designers like round figures, the method of expression can affect the gradients selected.

* 0.77% (1 in 130) – Rudgwick, UK platform after regrading – not too steep if a train is not provided with continuous brakes.

===Compensation for curvature===
Gradients on sharp curves are effectively a bit steeper than the same gradient on straight track, so to compensate for this and make the ruling grade uniform throughout, the gradient on those sharp curves should be reduced slightly.

===Continuous brakes===
In the era before they were provided with continuous brakes, whether air brakes or vacuum brakes, steep gradients made it extremely difficult for trains to stop safely. In those days, for example, an inspector insisted that Rudgwick railway station in West Sussex be regraded. He would not allow it to open until the gradient through the platform was eased from 1 in 80 to 1 in 130.

<text>Kenneth Eugene Iverson (17 December 1920 – 19 October 2004) was a Canadian computer scientist noted for the development of the programming language APL. He was honored with the Turing Award in 1979 &quot;for his pioneering effort in programming languages and mathematical notation resulting in what the computing field now knows as APL; for his contributions to the implementation of interactive systems, to educational uses of APL, and to programming language theory and practice&quot;.

== Life ==
Ken Iverson was born on 17 December 1920 near Camrose, a town in central Alberta, Canada. His parents were farmers who came to Alberta from North Dakota; his ancestors came from Trondheim, Norway.

During World War II, he served first in the Canadian Army and then in the Royal Canadian Air Force. He received a B.A. degree from Queen&#x27;s University and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University. In his career, he worked for Harvard, IBM, I. P. Sharp Associates, and Jsoftware Inc. (née Iverson Software Inc.).

Iverson suffered a stroke while working at the computer on a new J lab on 16 October 2004, and died in Toronto on 19 October 2004 at age 83.

== Education ==

Iverson began school on 1 April 1926 in a one-room school, initially in Grade 1, promoted to Grade 2 after 3 months and to Grade 4 by the end of June 1927.
He left school after Grade 9 because it was the depths of the Great Depression and there was work to do on the family farm, and because he thought further schooling only led to becoming a schoolteacher and he had no desire to become one. At age 17, while still out of school, he enrolled in a correspondence course on radios with De Forest Training in Chicago, and learned calculus by self-study from a textbook.
During World War II, while serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force, he took correspondence courses toward a high school diploma.

After the war, Iverson enrolled in Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario, taking advantage of government support for ex-servicemen and under threat from an Air Force buddy who said he would &quot;beat his brains out if he did not grasp the opportunity&quot;. He graduated in 1950 as the top student with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics and physics.

Continuing his education at Harvard University, he began in the Department of Mathematics and received a Master&#x27;s degree in 1951. He then switched to the Department of Engineering and Applied Physics, working with Howard Aiken and Wassily Leontief.

Howard Aiken had developed the Harvard Mark I, one of the first large-scale digital computers, while Wassily Leontief was an economist who was developing the input–output model of economic analysis, work for which he would later receive the Nobel Prize. Leontief&#x27;s model required large matrices and Iverson worked on programs that could evaluate these matrices on the Harvard Mark IV computer. Iverson received a Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 1954 with a dissertation based on this work.

At Harvard, Iverson met Eoin Whitney, a 2-time Putnam Fellow and fellow graduate student from Alberta. This had future ramifications.

== Work ==
=== Harvard (1955–1960) ===

Iverson stayed on at Harvard as an assistant professor to implement the world&#x27;s first graduate program in &quot;automatic data processing&quot;.

It was in this period that Iverson developed notation for describing and analyzing various topics in data processing, for teaching classes, and for writing (with Brooks) &quot;Automatic Data Processing&quot;. He was &quot;appalled&quot; to find that conventional mathematical notation failed to fill his needs, and began work on extensions to the notation that were more suitable. In particular, he adopted the matrix algebra used in his thesis work, the systematic use of matrices and higher-dimensional arrays in tensor analysis, and operators in the sense of Heaviside in his treatment of Maxwell&#x27;s equations, higher-order functions on function argument(s) with a function result. The notation was also field-tested in the business world in 1957 during a 6-month sabbatical spent at McKinsey &amp; Company. The first published paper using the notation was &quot;The Description of Finite Sequential Processes&quot;, initially Report Number 23 to Bell Labs and later revised and presented at the Fourth London Symposium on Information Theory in August 1960.

Iverson stayed at Harvard for five years but failed to get tenure, because &quot;[he hadn&#x27;t] published anything but the one little book&quot;.

=== IBM (1960–1980) ===

Iverson joined IBM Research in 1960 (and doubled his salary). He was preceded to IBM by Fred Brooks, who advised him to &quot;stick to whatever [he] really wanted to do, because management was so starved for ideas that anything not clearly crazy would find support.&quot; In particular, he was allowed to finish and publish &quot;A Programming Language&quot; and (with Brooks) &quot;Automatic Data Processing&quot;, two books that described and used the notation developed at Harvard. (&quot;Automatic Data Processing&quot; and &quot;A Programming Language&quot; began as one book &quot;but the material grew in both magnitude and level until a separation proved wise&quot;.)

At IBM, Iverson soon met Adin Falkoff, and they worked together for the next twenty years. Chapter 2 of &quot;A Programming Language&quot; used Iverson&#x27;s notation to describe the IBM 7090 computer. In early 1963 Falkoff, later joined by Iverson and Ed Sussenguth, proceeded to use the notation to produce a formal description of the IBM System/360 computer then under design. The result was published in 1964 in a double issue of the IBM Systems Journal, thereafter known as the &quot;grey book&quot; or &quot;grey manual&quot;. The book was used in a course on computer systems design at the IBM Systems Research Institute. A consequence of the formal description was that it attracted the interest of bright young minds. One hotbed of interest was at Stanford University which included Larry Breed, Phil Abrams, Roger Moore, Charles Brenner, and Mike Jenkins, all of whom later made contributions to APL. Donald McIntyre, head of geology at Pomona College which had the first general customer installation of a 360 system, used the formal description to become more expert than the IBM systems engineer assigned to Pomona.

With the completion of the formal description Falkoff and Iverson turned their attention to implementation. This work was brought to rapid fruition in 1965 when Larry Breed and Phil Abrams joined the project. They produced a FORTRAN-based implementation on the 7090 called IVSYS (for Iverson system) by autumn 1965, first in batch mode and later, in early 1966, in time-shared interactive mode. Subsequently, Breed, Dick Lathwell (ex University of Alberta), and Roger Moore (of I. P. Sharp Associates) produced the System/360 implementation; the three received the Grace Murray Hopper Award in 1973 &quot;for their work in the design and implementation of APL\360, setting new standards in simplicity, efficiency, reliability and response time for interactive systems.&quot; While the 360 implementation work was underway &quot;Iverson notation&quot; was renamed &quot;APL&quot;, by Falkoff. The workspace &quot;1 cleanspace&quot; was saved at 1966-11-27 22.53.58 UTC. APL\360 service began within IBM several weeks before that and outside IBM in 1968. Additional information on the implementation of APL\360 can be found in the Acknowledgements of the &quot;APL\360 User&#x27;s Manual&quot; and in &quot;Appendix. Chronology of APL development&quot; of &quot;The Design of APL&quot;.

The formal description and especially the implementation drove the evolution of the language, a process of consolidation and regularization in typography, linearization, syntax, and function definition described in &quot;APL\360 History&quot;, &quot;The Design of APL&quot;, and &quot;The Evolution of APL&quot;. Two treatises from this period, &quot;Conventions Governing the Order of Evaluation&quot; and &quot;Algebra as a Language&quot;, are apologias of APL notation.

The notation was used by Falkoff and Iverson to teach various topics at various universities and at the IBM Systems Research Institute. In 1964 Iverson used the notation in a one-semester course for seniors at the Fox Lane High School, and later in Swarthmore High School. After APL became available its first application was to teach formal methods in systems design at NASA Goddard. It was also used at the Hotchkiss School, Lower Canada College, Scotch Plains High School, Atlanta public schools, among others. In one school the students became so eager that they broke into the school after hours to get more APL computer time; in another the APL enthusiasts steered newbies to BASIC so as to maximize their own APL time.

In 1969, Iverson and the APL group inaugurated the IBM Philadelphia Scientific Center. In 1970 he was named IBM Fellow. He used the funding that came with being an IBM Fellow to bring in visiting teachers and professors from various fields, including Donald McIntyre from Pomona and Jeff Shallit as a summer student. For a period of several months the visitors would start using APL for expositions in their own fields, and the hope was that later they would continue their use of APL at their home institutions. Iverson&#x27;s work at this time centered in several disciplines, including collaborative projects in circuit theory, genetics, geology, and calculus. When the PSC closed in 1974, some of the group transferred to California while others including Iverson remained in the East, later transferring back to IBM Research. He received the Turing Award in 1979.

=== I. P. Sharp Associates (1980–1987) ===

In 1980, Iverson left IBM for I. P. Sharp Associates, an APL time-sharing company. He was preceded there by his IBM colleagues Paul Berry, Joey Tuttle, Dick Lathwell, and Eugene McDonnell. At IPSA, the APL language and systems group was managed by Eric Iverson (Ken Iverson&#x27;s son); Roger Moore, one of the APL\360 implementers, was a vice president.

Iverson worked to develop and extend APL on the lines presented in &quot;Operators and Functions&quot;. The language work gained impetus in 1981 when Arthur Whitney and Iverson produced a model of APL written in APL at the same time they were working on IPSA&#x27;s OAG database. (Iverson introduced Arthur Whitney, son of Eoin Whitney, to APL when he was 11-years-old and in 1974 recommended him for a summer student position at IPSA Calgary.) In the model, the APL syntax was driven by an 11-by-5 table. Whitney also invented the rank operator in the process. The language design was further simplified and extended in &quot;Rationalized APL&quot; in January 1983, multiple editions of &quot;A Dictionary of the APL Language&quot; between 1984 and 1987, and &quot;A Dictionary of APL&quot; in September 1987. Within IPSA, the phrase &quot;dictionary APL&quot; came into use to denote the APL specified by &quot;A Dictionary of APL&quot;, itself referred to as &quot;the dictionary&quot;. In the dictionary, APL syntax is controlled by a 9-by-6 table and the parsing process was precisely and succinctly described in Table 2, and there is a primitive (monadic ⊥, modeled in APL) for word formation (lexing).

In the 1970s and 1980s, the main APL vendors were IBM, STSC, and IPSA, and all three were active in developing and extending the language. IBM had APL2, based on the work of Jim Brown. Work on APL2 proceeded intermittently for 15 years, with actual coding starting in 1971 and APL2 becoming available as an IUP (Installed User Program, an IBM product classification) in 1982. STSC had an experimental APL system called NARS, designed and implemented by Bob Smith. NARS and APL2 differed in fundamental respects from dictionary APL, and differed from each other.

I.P. Sharp implemented the new APL ideas in stages: complex numbers, enclosed (boxed) arrays, match, and composition operators in 1981, the determinant operator in 1982, and the rank operator, link, and the left and right identity functions in 1983. However, the domains of operators were still restricted to the primitive functions or subsets thereof. In 1986, IPSA developed SAX, SHARP APL/Unix, written in C and based on an implementation by STSC. The language was as specified in the dictionary with no restrictions on the domains of operators. An alpha version of SAX became available within I.P. Sharp around December 1986 or early 1987.

In education, Iverson developed &quot;A SHARP APL Minicourse&quot; used to teach IPSA clients in the use of APL, and &quot;Applied Mathematics for Programmers&quot; and &quot;Mathematics and Programming&quot; which were used in computer science courses at T.H. Twente.

=== Jsoftware (1990–2004) ===

Iverson retired from I. P. Sharp Associates in 1987. He kept busy while &quot;between jobs&quot;. Regarding language design, the most significant of his activities in this period was the invention of &quot;fork&quot; in 1988. For years, he had struggled to find a way to write f+g as in calculus, from the &quot;scalar operators&quot; in 1978, through the &quot;til&quot; operator in 1982, the catenation and reshape operators in 1984, the union and intersection operators in 1987, &quot;yoke&quot; in 1988, and finally forks in 1988. Forks are defined as follows:

Moreover, (f g p q r) ←→ (f g (p q r)). Thus to write f+g as in calculus, one can write f+g in APL. Iverson and Eugene McDonnell worked out the details on the long plane rides to the APL88 conference in Sydney, Australia, with Iverson coming up with the initial idea on waking up from a nap.

Iverson presented the rationale for his work post 1987 as follows:

Roger Hui described the final impetus that got J started in Appendix A of &quot;An Implementation of J&quot;:

Hui, a classmate of Whitney at the University of Alberta, had studied &quot;A Dictionary of the APL Language&quot; when &quot;he&quot; was between jobs, modelled the parsing process in at least two different ways, and investigated uses of dictionary APL in diverse applications. As well, from January 1987 to August 1989 he had access to SAX, and in the later part of that period used it on a daily basis.

J initially took &quot;A Dictionary of APL&quot; as the specification, and the J interpreter was built around Table 2 of the dictionary. The C data and program structures were designed so that the parse table in C corresponded directly to the parse table in the dictionary. In retrospect, Iverson&#x27;s APL87 paper &quot;APL87&quot;, in five pages, prescribed all the essential steps in writing an APL interpreter, in particular the sections on word formation and parsing. Arthur Whitney, in addition to the &quot;one-page thing&quot;, contributed to J development by suggesting that primitives be oriented on the leading axis, that agreement (a generalization of scalar extension) should be prefix instead of suffix, and that a total array ordering be defined.

One of the objectives was to implement fork. This turned out to be rather straightforward, by the inclusion of one additional row in the parse table. The choice to implement forks was fortuitous and fortunate. It was realized only later that forks made tacit expressions (operator expressions) complete in the following sense: any sentence involving one or two arguments that did not use its arguments as an operand, can be written tacitly with fork, compose, the left and right identity functions, and constant functions.

Two obvious differences between J and other APL dialects are: (a) its use of terms from natural languages instead of from mathematics or computer science (the practice began with &quot;A Dictionary of APL&quot;): noun, verb, adverbs, alphabet, word formation, sentence, ... instead of array, function, operator, character set, lexing, expression, ... ; and (b) its use of 7-bit ASCII characters instead of special symbols. Other differences between J and APL are described in &quot;J for the APL Programmer&quot; and &quot;APL and J&quot;.

Eric Iverson founded Iverson Software Inc., in February 1990 to provide an improved SHARP APL/PC product. It quickly became obvious that there were shared interests and goals, and in May 1990 Iverson and Hui joined Iverson Software Inc.; later joined by Chris Burke. The company soon became J only. The name was changed to Jsoftware Inc., in April 2000.

<doc id="259165" wikidata="Q967620" url="?curid=259165" title="TRW Inc.">
<text>TRW Inc. was an American corporation involved in a variety of businesses, mainly aerospace, electronics, automotive, and credit reporting. It was a pioneer in multiple fields including electronic components, integrated circuits, computers, software and systems engineering. TRW built many spacecraft, including Pioneer 1, Pioneer 10, and several space-based observatories. It was #57 on the 1986 Fortune 500 list, and had 122,258 employees. The company was called Thompson Ramo Wooldridge Inc., after the 1958 merger of the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation and Thompson Products. This was later shortened to TRW.

The company was founded in 1901 and lasted for just over a century until being acquired by Northrop Grumman in 2002. It spawned a variety of corporations, including Pacific Semiconductors, The Aerospace Corporation, Bunker-Ramo and Experian. Its automotive businesses were sold off by Northrop Grumman as TRW Automotive, which is now part of ZF Friedrichshafen. TRW veterans were instrumental in the founding of corporations like SpaceX.

In 1953, the company was recruited to lead the development of the United States&#x27; first ICBM. Starting with the initial design by Convair, the multi-corporate team launched Atlas in 1957. It flew its full range in 1958 and was then adapted to fly the Mercury astronauts into orbit. TRW also led development of the Titan missile, which was later adapted to fly the Gemini missions. The company served the U.S. Air Force as systems engineers on all subsequent ICBM development efforts but TRW never produced any missile hardware because of the conflict of interest. In 1960, Congress spurred the formation of the non-profit Aerospace Corporation to provide systems engineering support to the U.S. government but TRW continued to guide the ICBM efforts.

== History ==
TRW originated in 1901 with the Cleveland Cap Screw Company, founded by David Kurtz and four other Cleveland residents. Their initial products were bolts with heads electrically welded to the shafts. In 1904, a welder named Charles E. Thompson adapted their process to making automobile engine valves and by 1915, the company was the largest valve producer in the United States. Charles Thompson was named general manager of the company, which became Thompson Products in 1926. Their experimental hollow sodium-cooled valves aided Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s solo flight across the Atlantic.

In 1937, Thompson Motor Products bought J.A. Drake and Sons (JADSON). The company made high-performance valves that were used in many racing engines of the day, including the Miller Offy. Dale Drake (son of J.A. Drake) bought the Offy engine design with his partner Louis Meyer in 1946 and won the Indianapolis 500 twenty-seven times, more than any other engine design.

During the period leading up to World War II, through the end of the Korean war, Thompson Products was a key manufacturer of component parts for aircraft engines, including cylinder valves. The TAPCO plant, owned by the U.S. government but operated by Thompson Products, extended for almost a mile along Cleveland&#x27;s Euclid Avenue. It employed over 16,000 workers at the peak of WW II production. As jet aircraft replaced piston-engined aircraft, Thompson Products became a major manufacturer of turbine blades for jet engines.

In 1950, Simon Ramo and Dean Wooldridge while working for Hughes Aircraft, led the development of the Falcon radar-guided missile, among other projects. They grew frustrated with Howard Hughes&#x27; management, and formed the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation in September 1953, with the financial support of Thompson Products. The detonation of a thermonuclear bomb by the Soviet Union spurred Trevor Gardner to form the Teapot Committee in October 1953. Chaired by John von Neumann, its purpose was to study the development of ballistic missiles, including ICBMs. Ramo and Wooldridge were committee members, and Ramo-Wooldridge Corp. became the lead contractor of the resulting ICBM development effort, reporting to the United States Air Force.

With continued backing from Thompson Products, Ramo-Wooldridge diversified into computers and electronic components, founding Pacific Semiconductors in 1954. They also produced scientific spacecraft such as Pioneer 1. Thompson Products and Ramo-Wooldridge merged in October 1958 to form Thompson Ramo Wooldridge Inc., unofficially known as &quot;TRW&quot;. In February 1959, Jimmy Doolittle became chairman of the board of Space Technology Laboratories (STL), the division which continued to support the Air Force ICBM efforts.

Other aerospace companies believed TRW&#x27;s Air Force advisory role granted it unfair access to their technologies and in September 1959, Congress issued a report recommending that STL be converted to a non-profit organization. With nearly half of STL&#x27;s employees, The Aerospace Corporation was formed in June 1960. It headed the Atlas conversion for Mercury, Titan conversion for Gemini, and provided ongoing systems engineering support for the government. The Air Force continued its ICBM work with TRW.

Dean Wooldridge retired in January 1962 to become a professor at California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Simon Ramo became president of the Bunker-Ramo Corporation in January 1964, jointly owned by TRW and Martin Marietta for the production of computers and monitors. Thompson Ramo Wooldridge officially became TRW Inc. in July 1965. Free of anti-competitive restrictions short of ICBM hardware, STL was renamed TRW Systems Group that same month. In 1968, the company entered the credit reporting industry by purchasing Credit Data Corporation and renaming it TRW Information Systems and Services Inc. The Credit Data group was formed in 1970 to compete with Dun &amp; Bradstreet, from the combination of TRWISS and ESL Incorporated to specialize in technical strategic reconnaissance. TRW Information Systems and Services Division (Credit Data) was spun off in 1996 to form Experian. TRW acquired LucasVarity in 1999, then selling Lucas Diesel Systems to Delphi Automotive and Lucas Aerospace (then called TRW Aeronautical Systems) to Goodrich Corporation.

The company was 57th on the Fortune 500 list of highest revenue American companies in 1986 and had 122,258 employees in 2000. It operated in 25 countries.

On 3 February 1986, the TRW plant in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, burned to the ground in an eight-alarm fire. The damage was estimated to be greater than US$10 million and was the most serious fire to date in the area.

In February 2002, Northrop Grumman launched a US$5.9 billion hostile bid for TRW. Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, and General Dynamics contended for the company with Northrop&#x27;s increased bid of US$7.8 billion ultimately being accepted on July 1, 2002. Soon afterward, the automotive assets of LucasVarity and TRW&#x27;s own automotive group were sold to The Blackstone Group as TRW Automotive.

A portion of TRW&#x27;s Lyndhurst campus was developed as Legacy Village. The headquarters building became home to the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute. The TRW headquarters building was demolished in 2023.

Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, says that he got &quot;his first big break&quot; at age fifteen, debugging energy-grid control software for TRW. &quot;It was kind of scary&quot;, Gates said, realizing the things the program was going to help operate. &quot;This thing &quot;needs&quot; to work&quot;.

== Aerospace ==
TRW Inc. was active in the development of missile systems and spacecraft, notably, the early development of the U.S. ICBM program under the leadership of the Teapot Committee led by John von Neumann. TRW pioneered systems engineering, creating the ubiquitous &quot;N&quot;2 chart and the modern functional flow block diagram. It served as the primary source of systems engineering for the United States Air Force ballistic missile programs.

=== Space exploration ===
Space Technology Laboratories (STL), then a division of Ramo-Wooldridge Corp., designed and produced the identical payloads for Pioneer 0, Pioneer 1 and Pioneer 2. These were intended to orbit and photograph the Moon, but launch vehicle problems prevented this. NASA launched Pioneer 1 as its first spacecraft on 11 October 1958. It set a distance record from Earth, and provided data on the extent of Earth&#x27;s radiation belts.

Pioneer 10 and 11 were nearly identical spacecraft, designed and fabricated by TRW Systems Group. They were optimized for ruggedness since they were the first man-made objects to pass through the asteroid belt and Jupiter&#x27;s radiation belt. Simplicity, redundancy, and use of proven components were essential. As NASA&#x27;s first all-atomic powered spacecraft, these used plutonium-238 units developed by Teledyne Isotopes. Pioneer 10 carried eleven instruments and Pioneer 11 carried twelve for investigating Jupiter and Saturn, respectively. Data was transmitted back to Earth at 8 watts, 128 bytes/s at Jupiter, and 1 byte/s from further out. Pioneer 10 was the first man-made object to pass the planetary orbits and its last telemetry was received in 2002, thirty years after launch.

TRW Systems Group designed and built the instrument package which performed the Martian biological experiments, searching for life aboard the two Viking Landers launched in 1975. The system performed four experiments on Martian soil using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and a combined biological instrument.

=== Space-based observatories ===
TRW designed and built the following space observatories:
* HEAO 1, 2, and 3, with HEAO 2 being the Einstein Observatory, the first fully imaging X-ray telescope put into space
* Compton Gamma Ray Observatory which is the second of four among NASA&#x27;s Great Observatories program
* Chandra X-ray Observatory is the third of NASA&#x27;s Great Observatories

The teams developing the following observatories continued their work as part of Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems:

* SIM Lite space telescope which would have searched for Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones around nearby stars (project canceled)
* James Webb Space Telescope which is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope

=== Satellites ===
TRW Systems Group designed and manufactured the Vela series of nuclear detection satellites which monitored the 1963 establishment of the nuclear Partial Test Ban Treaty. Subsequently, they produced the Advanced Vela series, first launched in 1967, which could detect nuclear air bursts using instruments called bhangmeters. It had the first dual-spin attitude control system with the total system momentum controlled to zero. The Vela and Advanced Vela satellites were the first to alert astronomers to the presence of gamma-ray bursts. They also reported a mysterious apparent nuclear test now called the Vela incident.

First launched in 1970, the company built all twenty-three reconnaissance satellites in the Defense Support Program (DSP), which are the principal components of the Satellite Early Warning System currently used by the United States. These are operated by the Air Force Space Command, and they detect missile or spacecraft launches and nuclear explosions using sensors that detect the infrared emissions from these intense sources of heat. During Desert Storm, for example, DSP satellites were able to detect the launches of Iraqi Scud missiles and provide timely warnings to civilians and military forces in Israel and Saudi Arabia.

The initial seven Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) were built by TRW to improve communication coverage for the Space Shuttle, International Space Station (ISS), and U.S. military satellites. When first launched in 1983, the TDRS satellites were the largest, most sophisticated communications satellites built at the time. The seventh vehicle in the series was ordered as a replacement when TDRS-B was lost in the Challenger accident.

Launched in 2002, TRW produced the Aqua spacecraft based on their modular standardized satellite bus. A joint project of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (NASA), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and National Institute for Space Research (INPE), Brazil, Aqua delivers 750 Gigabytes per day detailing the Earth&#x27;s water cycle in the oceans, lakes, atmosphere, polar ice caps, and vegetation.

=== Rocket engines ===
TRW designed and built the descent engine or (LMDE) for the Apollo lunar lander. Due to the need for a soft landing on the Moon, it was the first throttleable engine for crewed space flight. This, and the requirements for high thrust, low weight, and crushability (in case of landing on a large rock), earned surprising praise from NASA&#x27;s history pages, considering the complexity of the lunar missions: &quot;The lunar module descent engine probably was the biggest challenge and the most outstanding technical development of Apollo&quot;. This engine was used on Apollo 13 to achieve free return trajectory and make a minor course correction after damage to the Service Module.

After the Apollo program Moon landings, the LMDE was further developed into the TRW TR-201 engine. This engine was used in the second stage Delta-P of the Delta launch vehicle for 77 launches between 1972–1988.

== Weapons ==
At the turn of 1964-65, the United States started the ambitious Bushmaster program to create small-caliber assault guns for arming promising infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) of the American Army. The result of this program was the creation of a whole series of automatic cannons with an external automatic drive in caliber from 25 to 40 mm, which received their own general name &quot;Bushmaster&quot;. 

At the early stage of American research, TRW was one of the companies involved in the development of automatic guns of the Bushmaster program, where, under the leadership of engineer Eugene Stoner, the author of the famous M16 rifle, a 25 mm automatic cannon was developed under the internal designation TRW model 6425, an ordinary system with automatic gas venting and locking the barrel with a rotary bolt is enough.

The TRW-6425 design was later bought by Oerlikon-Bührle, it was improved and manufactured as the Oerlikon KBA 25 mm.

== Semiconductors and computers ==
The Ramo-Wooldridge Corp formed Pacific Semiconductors in June 1954, under the leadership of Harper North who had been head of electronics R+D at Hughes Aircraft Company. The funding for this endeavor from Thompson Products was about ten times their initial investment in Ramo-Wooldridge. The original goal was to produce the recently invented transistor for commercial sales.

In 1957, Howard Sachar and Sanford &quot;Sandy&quot; Barnes invented the Varicap electronic component (also known as the varactor diode) at Pacific Semiconductors. This device reduced the physical size of radio tuners and eliminated the need for moving mechanical parts. This simplified the implementation of remote control TV tuners. Sachar and Barnes were awarded an Emmy in 2007.

The company manufactured the RW-300 for sales in 1959, one of the first &quot;all-transistor&quot; computers with a power supply that used vacuum tubes. The computer was targeted at industrial control applications, with 1024 analog inputs multiplexed to a 1.9K sample/s 10-bit analog-to-digital converter which was transparent to the programmer. It weighed about . The real-time operating system was written by John Neblett, and was the intellectual precursor of the RSX-11 operating system for the PDP-11.

The TRW-130 computer was introduced in 1961, and designated the AN/UYK-1 by the U.S. Navy as part of its pre-GPS TRANSIT (NAVSAT) satellite-based location system. It used Doppler shifts to compute a location in about 15 minutes, and had rounded corners to allow installation in submarines.

The Transistor Transistor Logic (TTL) logic gate, which was the electronics industry standard for two decades, was invented by TRW&#x27;s James L. Buie in 1961.

In 1965, engineers Don Nelson and Dick Pick at TRW developed the Generalized Information Retrieval Language and System, for use by the U.S. Army to control the inventory of Cheyenne helicopter parts. This developed into the Pick Database Management System which is still in use as of 2016.

TRW LSI Products, Inc. was a wholly owned subsidiary formed to commercialize the integrated circuit technology the company had developed in support of its aerospace business. They produced some of the first commercially available digital signal processing ICs including the TDC1008 multiplier-accumulator. They also made the first 8-bit flash ADC IC, the TDC1007, resulting in an Emmy Award for analog/digital video conversion technology. TRW also pioneered gallium arsenide (GaAs) chip applications for local multipoint distribution service (LMDS) systems, radios, and satellite communications.

== Music ==
Bel Canto Stereophonic Recordings, a TRW subsidiary, was a record label active from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s.

== In the media ==
Christopher John Boyce was a TRW employee convicted of selling security secrets to the Soviet Union via the Soviet embassy in Mexico City in the mid-1970s. Boyce and his accomplice, Andrew Daulton Lee, were the subjects of the best-selling 1979 Robert Lindsey book &quot;The Falcon and the Snowman&quot;, and the 1985 film of the same title.

Representatives from Space Technology Laboratories (STL) present their ICBM expertise to Don and Pete in &quot;Mad Men&quot; season 2 episode &quot;The Jet Set&quot;.

The &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; season 1 episode &quot;Operation -- Annihilate!&quot; (13 April 1967) was filmed on the then-TRW campus (now Northrop Grumman&#x27;s Space Park) in Redondo Beach, California. The two sets of stairs shown are those leading to the cafeteria of Building S. William Shatner had previously filmed at the TRW campus for the &quot;Outer Limits&quot; episode &quot;Cold Hands, Warm Heart&quot;. In the episode, he plays an astronaut for &quot;Project Vulcan&quot;. The 1967 sci-fi film Countdown, also filmed at the TRW Space Park.

The TRW building is supposedly one of the credit company buildings demolished in the 1999 film &quot;Fight Club&quot;. This is because at the time the book was written, TRW was in the business of credit reporting. However, there is no TRW building in Delaware, where the demolition purportedly happens.

TRW equipment/boxes can be seen stored and being unloaded in the film Close Encounters of the Third Kind during scenes filmed at Devils Tower.

== Superfund site ==
In the 1960s and 1970s, TRW stored trichloroethylene (TCE), a critical chemical for cooling and degreasing computer chips, in tanks deep underground in Sunnyvale, California for later use. TCE is also found in household cleaners. As a result of pipe and tank degradation, the tanks leaked into the ground, resulting in contaminated soil and groundwater. TCE was later determined to be toxic to humans at high concentrations. In 2013, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; referred to the site as a &quot;paved-over environmental disaster zone&quot;.

In the 1980s, the US introduced the federal Superfund program to clean up the country&#x27;s toxic waste sites. The site TRW (now Northrop Grumman) is responsible for is called the &#x27;TRW Microwave site&#x27;. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) worked with TRW to treat the water with ultraviolet light and oxygenation and excavate the contaminated soil. In 1994, a public health study determined that the groundwater was still unacceptably contaminated, which can cause vapor intrusion. The EPA says the site has institutional controls to protect people from contact with affected water. Drinking water in the area comes from Hetch Hetchy and municipal wells.

In the 2000s, a bioremediation method developed by Stanford University using bacteria in molasses to naturally breakdown the TCE into harmless sub-compounds was implemented. Other measures included engineering vapor pathways to avoid direct human contact by releasing it into the air. Jared Blumenfeld, the former EPA director, said that TCE released in the air after the cleanup efforts reduces the concentrations to levels that eliminate health risks. Blumenfeld said that airborne TCE is not ideal, but the cleanup has reduced the toxins by 90% , according to Max Shahbacian, the project&#x27;s lead at California State Water Resources Control Board before it was transferred to the EPA, and geologist Michael Calhoun.

In 2014 and 2015, a newly required vapor intrusion test of the surrounding residential area, including homes, apartment buildings, and four schools, showed unacceptable levels of TCE. A 2011 study had revealed TCE caused birth defects and cancer by all pathways of exposure. In 2014, the region&#x27;s congressional representative Anna Eshoo expressed concerns that the EPA had not been properly monitoring the site and notififying residents of a possible health issue. The EPA litigated with the responsible parties in order update its notification and testing measures to warn residents about possible exposure as early as possible and keeping people away from any unsafe areas.

, the site is owned by GI Partners, an investment company, and has been leased by Apple Inc. since 2015 for research and development . The octagonal glass building was renovated in 2014 and made available for occupancy in 2015. The safety of the site was verified by the EPA. In 2016, the Donald Trump administration cut funding the Superfund program by $330 million and EPA funding by more than 30%, resulting in a significant reduction in enforcement and testing. During his presidency, the EPA increased its use of consent decrees, or administrative settlements, to ensure progress continued under the budget cuts, forcing responsible parties to pay for the cleanup. Scott Pruitt, Trump&#x27;s head of the EPA threatened to cut budgets again for the enforcement. In 2019, the EPA and Philips Semiconductors agreed to a consent decree, with Northrop Grumman as a signatory, to fund the remaining cleanup and monitoring of the site, along with two nearby sites collectively known as the &quot;Triple Site&quot;.

In March 2021, Ashley Gjøvik, a former Apple program manager, publicized concerns that the site had not been properly tested since 2015 after receiving an email from Apple notifying employees of forthcoming vapor intrusion testing. An EPA study in 2019 had confirmed the previous remedies effective, but Gjøvik told &quot;TechCrunch&quot; cracks in the floor were exposing employees to carcinogenic fumes. She filed a whistleblower complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration against Apple, which was investigated and dismissed. A site evaluation by the EPA done in August 2021 found that the likelihood for vapor intrusion was low and not expected. Based on field testing done between April 24, 2023 and May 5, 2023, the EPA concluded that vapor intrusion was being prevented.

<text>Houlton is a town in and the county seat of Aroostook County, Maine, United States, on the Canada–United States border. As of the 2020 census, the town&#x27;s population was 6,055. It is perhaps best known for being at the northern terminus of Interstate 95 and as the birthplace of Samantha Smith, a goodwill ambassador as a child during the Cold War. The town hosts the annual Houlton Agricultural Fair.

Its nickname is the &quot;Shire Town&quot;. The Houlton High School sports teams are named &quot;The Shiretowners&quot;. The Meduxnekeag River flows through the heart of the town, and the border with the Canadian province of New Brunswick is east of the town&#x27;s center. Houlton was the home of Ricker College, which closed in 1978.

The primary settlement and center of the town is designated as a CDP with the same name. The headquarters of the federally recognized Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians is based here.

==History==
The area was occupied for thousands of years by varying cultures of indigenous peoples. In historic times, these were the Algonquian-speaking Maliseet people. When Maine was part of Massachusetts, parcels of land were dealt out to schools and colleges. The area that was to become Houlton was deeded to the Academy of New Salem, Massachusetts. Thirteen men from New Salem bought the land from the academy, though only three settled there.

Decades after the American Revolutionary War, Anglo-American pioneers Aaron Putnam and Joseph Houlton started a village. They named it for Houlton, who had moved to Maine in 1807 from the more populated part of Massachusetts. Maine separated from Massachusetts in 1820 and became an independent state.

In 1828 the United States government established Hancock Barracks, a military post, in the area. Houlton was officially incorporated as a town in 1831. When the Aroostook War flared in 1839 over the border with Canada, three companies of the 1st Artillery Regiment manned Hancock Barracks under Major R. M. Kirby. Major Kirby helped to restrain the twelve companies of militia that Maine sent there from starting a shooting war. The Webster-Ashburton Treaty settled the boundary dispute in 1842, and the Army abandoned Hancock Barracks in 1847.

The U.S. Army installed its first transatlantic radio intelligence station 1.5 miles east of the town center of Houlton, Maine, during World War I. The Houlton Radio Intelligence Station intercepted German diplomatic communications, primarily from its Nauen Transmitter Station. MI-8 created the Radio Intelligence Service, using selected Signal Corps personnel for the sole purpose of supporting strategic intelligence through radio intercepts during World War I. The United States intelligence services built Houlton as the first unit of its type, and its success helped to lay the foundation for many more United States long-range radio-intercept stations.

On January 7, 1927, AT&amp;T initiated the first transatlantic commercial telephone service, linking New York and London. The AT&amp;T Transoceanic Receiver Station was located at the end of Hand Lane, , two miles west of the town center. The massive receiving beverage antenna, over three miles long and two miles wide, straddled what is now Interstate 95 in Maine four miles west of the center of Houlton. The receiver station worked with the large long-wave transmitting facility of AT&amp;T located at RCA in Rocky Point, New York. The receiver station received the longwave telephone signal from the British General Post Office Rugby transmitting station near Rugby, England. The Rugby Radio Station ceased operations in 2007. On its site is a new large-scale housing development, which has also been named Houlton, in honour of the historic links with its American namesake. 

The US Army established Houlton Army Air Base in 1941 immediately adjacent to the Canada–US border. Prior to the United States&#x27; entry into World War II, American army pilots flew planes to the base. They could not fly the planes directly into Canada, a member of the British Commonwealth, because that would violate the official United States position of neutrality. Local farmers used their tractors to tow the planes into Canada, where the Canadians closed the Woodstock highway so that aircraft could use it as a runway.

A Royal New Zealand Air Force pilot, officer George Newall Harrison, died on December 5, 1942, when he crashed 500 yards south of the runway while ferrying a Hudson Bomber to Britain. Survivors buried his body in the Evergreen Cemetery plot for veterans. Few other New Zealand casualties from World War II were buried in the United States of America. His 19-year-old radio operator, Sergeant Henry Bordewick, also died and was buried there; he was from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The American Legion post in Houlton maintains both these Commonwealth war graves.

The Houlton Army Air Base closed in July 1944. In 1944, the Army adapted a major part of the Houlton Army Air Base for use as prisoner of war internment in Camp Houlton. At its peak, the internment camp held 3,700 German prisoners of war. Forcing prisoners of war to work violated the Geneva Convention; however, they could volunteer to work. Camp Houlton provided laborers for local farms to harvest peas, pick potatoes, and do other labor. For security reasons, the government did not allow every prisoner of war to work on the farms. Most prisoners selected to work did not want to harm their captors or cause trouble. Many farmers came to consider the prisoners of war who worked their fields as good laborers rather than enemy soldiers. They paid the prisoners $1/day in scrip, which the prisoners could spend at the post exchange, the base store, to buy toiletries, tobacco, chocolate, or beer. After the prisoners repatriated, the Army closed Camp Houlton in 1946. The site was redeveloped as Houlton International Airport.

A solar eclipse across the United States was expected on April 8, 2024, and Houlton was known to be in the path of totality. The town spent two years preparing a three-day festival leading up to the event. The turnout was even greater than planners had expected because of bad weather in other parts of the country, resulting in a last-minute rush of visitors to Houlton. Attendance was estimated at 20,000 people or more. Welcome news as the sudden unexpected influx of tourist seeking clear skies only added to the street party atmosphere. A large (photo op) banner was unveiled, celebrating Houlton’s being the Great American Eclipse&#x27;s final destination proclaiming, &quot;The End is Here,&quot; and the town&#x27;s bust of George Washington was outfitted with a pair of oversized eclipse glasses. As the celestial moment drew near observers clustered in different areas of the city to marvel at the spectacle. But when the people started leaving after totality, there was a 7-mile traffic backup heading south out of town.

==Geography and climate==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Houlton is drained by the Meduxnekeag River.

Interstate 95 has its northernmost two exits in Houlton. The Houlton/Woodstock Border Crossing, located to the east of downtown Houlton, marks the northern terminus of Interstate 95. The town is also crossed by U.S. Route 1 and U.S. Route 2, which have a brief concurrency in the center of town.

Typically for Maine, Houlton has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm summers and cold, snowy winters comparable to Fargo. The coldest month between 1971 and 2000 was January 1994 with a mean temperature of , though data from nearby stations suggest the Januaries of 1920 and 1925 were equally cold. Snow depth typically reaches in February, and has been as high as at the close of January 1998. Temperature extremes range from −41 °F (−41 °C) on January 4, 1981, up to 99 °F (37 °C) on August 2, 1975.

<text>Brunswick is a town in Cumberland County, Maine, United States. Brunswick is included in the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine metropolitan New England city and town area. The population was 21,756 at the 2020 United States Census. Part of the Portland-South Portland-Biddeford metropolitan area, Brunswick is home to Bowdoin College, the Bowdoin International Music Festival, the Bowdoin College Museum of Art, the Peary–MacMillan Arctic Museum, and the Maine State Music Theatre. It was formerly home to the U.S. Naval Air Station Brunswick, which was permanently closed on May 31, 2011, and has since been partially released to redevelopment as &quot;Brunswick Landing&quot;.
==History==

Settled in 1628 by Thomas Purchase and other fishermen, the area was called by its Indian name, Pejepscot, meaning &quot;the long, rocky rapids part [of the river]&quot;. In 1639, Purchase placed his settlement under protection of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. During King Philip&#x27;s War in 1676, Pejepscot was burned and abandoned, although a garrison called Fort Andros was built on the ruins during King William&#x27;s War. During the war, in Major Benjamin Church&#x27;s second expedition a year later, he arrived on September 11, 1690, with 300 men at Casco Bay. He went up the Androscoggin River to Fort Pejepscot (present day Brunswick, Maine). From there he went upriver and attacked a native village. Three or four native men were shot in retreat. When Church discovered five captive settlers in the wigwams, six or seven prisoners were butchered as an example, and nine prisoners were taken. A few days later, in retaliation, the natives attacked Church at Cape Elizabeth on Purpooduc Point, killing seven of his men and wounding 24 others. On September 26, Church returned to Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

The 1713 Treaty of Portsmouth brought peace to the region between the Abenaki Indians and the English colonists.

In 1714, a consortium from Boston and Portsmouth bought the land, thereafter called the &quot;Pejepscot purchase&quot;. The Massachusetts General Court constituted the township in 1717, naming it &quot;Brunswick&quot; in honor of the House of Brunswick and its scion, King George I. A stone fort called Fort George was built in 1715 near the falls. But during Dummer&#x27;s War on July 13, 1722, Abenaki warriors from Norridgewock burned the village. Consequently, Governor Samuel Shute declared war on the Abenakis. In 1724, 208 English colonial militia left Fort Richmond and sacked Norridgewock during Dummer&#x27;s War. Brunswick was rebuilt again in 1727, and in 1739 incorporated as a town. It became a prosperous seaport, where Bowdoin College was chartered in 1794.

The Androscoggin River falls in three successive stages for a total vertical drop of , providing water power for industry. Brunswick became a major producer of lumber, with as many as 25 sawmills. Some of the lumber went into shipbuilding. Other firms produced paper, soap, flour, marble and granite work, carriages and , plows, furniture, shoes and confections. The town was site of the first cotton mill in Maine, the Brunswick Cotton Manufactory Company, built in 1809 to make yarn. Purchased in 1812, the mill was enlarged by the Maine Cotton &amp; Woolen Factory Company. In 1857, the Cabot Manufacturing Company was established to make cotton textiles. It bought the failed Worumbo Mill and expanded the brick factory along the falls. Needing even more room, the company in 1890 persuaded the town to move Maine Street.

Principal employers for Brunswick include L.L. Bean, Bath Iron Works, as well as companies that produce fiberglass construction material and electrical switches. A number of health services providers serving Maine&#x27;s mid-coast area are located in Brunswick. The former Naval Air Station Brunswick was a major employer in Brunswick prior to its closure.

<text>Farmington is a town in and the county seat of Franklin County, Maine, United States. As of the 2020 census, its population was 7,592. Farmington is home to the University of Maine at Farmington, Nordica Memorial Auditorium, the Nordica Homestead, and the annual Farmington Fair.

==History==

The area was once territory of the Canibas tribe of Abenaki Indians. They had two camps located near Farmington Falls, with fields cleared for cultivation of maize and potatoes. Their fort&#x27;s stockade enclosed about an acre at the center of what is today Farmington Falls village. 

A group from Topsham arrived in 1776 to explore the area and lay out a town, called Plantation No. 1 or Sandy River Plantation, but permanent settlement was delayed by the Revolutionary War.

In 1781, the first settlers arrived, the same year a sawmill was established. On February 1, 1794, Sandy River Plantation was incorporated as Farmington, named for its unusually fertile soil. Beginning with a cluster of log houses at Farmington Falls, the town grew quickly and prospered. Agriculture was an important early occupation, with hay a principal product. Orchards yielded apples and other fruit. Farmington became one of the largest wool producing towns in New England, with many herds of sheep grazing the hills and intervales.

==History==

The town of Bar Harbor was founded on the northeast shore of Mount Desert Island, which the Wabanaki Indians knew as &quot;Pemetic&quot;, meaning &quot;range of mountains&quot; or &quot;mountains seen at a distance.&quot; The Wabanaki seasonally fish, hunt and gather berries, clams, and other shellfish in the area. They speak of Bar Harbor as &quot;Man-es-ayd&#x27;ik&quot; (&quot;clam-gathering place&quot;) or &quot;Ah-bays&#x27;auk&quot; (&quot;clambake place&quot;), leaving great piles of shells as evidence of this abundance. In early September 1604, French explorer Samuel de Champlain ran aground on a rock ledge believed to be Egg Rock, just off Otter Cliffs, and when he came ashore to repair his boat he met local natives. Champlain named the island &quot;Isles des Monts Deserts&quot;, meaning &quot;island of barren mountains&quot;—now called Mount Desert Island, the largest island in Maine.

In 1761, Abraham Somes established the first European village on Mount Desert Island, naming it Somesville. Also named for him is Somes Sound, the only naturally occurring fjard on the East Coast of the US. Bar Harbor itself was incorporated as Eden on February 23, 1796, named after Sir Richard Eden, an English statesman.

Early industries included fishing, lumbering and shipbuilding. With the best soil on Mount Desert Island, it also developed agriculture, with a main focus on dairy. In the 1840s, its rugged maritime scenery attracted the Hudson River School and Luminism artists Thomas Cole, Frederic Edwin Church, William Hart and Fitz Henry Lane. Inspired by their paintings, journalists, sportsmen and &quot;rusticators&quot; followed. Agamont House, the first hotel in Eden, was established in 1855 by Tobias Roberts. Birch Point, the first summer estate, was built in 1868 for Alpheus Harding.

By 1880, there were 30 hotels, including the Mira Monte Inn, a historic landmark that survived a massive fire in 1947. Tourists were arriving by train and ferry to the Gilded Age resort that would rival Newport, Rhode Island. The rich and famous tried to outdo each other with entertaining and estates, often hiring landscape gardener and landscape architect Beatrix Farrand, a resident at local Reef Point Estate, to design their gardens. A glimpse of their lifestyles was available from the Shore Path, a coastal path skirting waterfront lawns. Yachting, garden parties at the Pot &amp; Kettle Club, and carriage rides up Cadillac Mountain were popular diversions. Others enjoyed horse-racing at Robin Hood Park-Morrell Park. US President William Howard Taft played golf in 1910 at the Kebo Valley Golf Club. He was the last sitting president to visit the town until Barack Obama in July 2010.

On March 3, 1918, Eden was renamed Bar Harbor, after the sand and gravel bar, visible at low tide, which leads across to Bar Island and forms the rear of the harbor. The name would become synonymous with elite wealth. It was the birthplace of vice-president Nelson Rockefeller.
Bar Harbor was also used for naval practices during World War II. More specifically, Bald Porcupine Island (one of the five Porcupine Islands) was used to fire live torpedoes. In October 1944, the submarine USS &quot;Piper&quot; fired 12 live torpedoes at the island. Of those fired, one failed to explode on the first attempt but was later detonated by the twelfth torpedo. In 1996, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers surveyed all 30 acres of Bald Porcupine Island for unexploded ordnance. Nine were found.

Many influential people have called Bar Harbor home for at least part of the year. John D. Rockefeller Jr., son of John D. Rockefeller of Standard Oil Co., donated about one-third of the land in Acadia National Park and built the carriage roads that are used for hiking and biking. J. P. Morgan owned a house that is adjacent to the town. Cornelius Vanderbilt built cottages in Bar Harbor, while the Astor family owned hotels and cottages in Bar Harbor and the surrounding areas. Roxanne Quimby, co-founder and CEO of Burt&#x27;s Bees, has a home near Bar Harbor. Martha Stewart owns property in nearby Seal Harbor and frequents Bar Harbor.

===Mount Desert Island fire===

In mid-October 1947, Maine experienced a severe drought, seeing only half of its usual rainfall. On October 17, sparks at a cranberry bog near Town Hill ignited a wildfire that intensified over the next ten days, due to strong winds that began on October 21, and it was not declared out until mid-November. This was one of several wildfires in the state that year. Nearly half the eastern side of Mount Desert Island burned, including 67 &quot;cottages&quot;—nearly one-third of the 222 cottages that stood at the time. (Many were empty or for sale; only 135 were occupied that summer.) Five historic grand hotels were also destroyed. These were Agamont House (Main Street), Hamor House (Main Street at Cottage Street), Belmont Hotel (Mount Desert and Kebo Streets), Malvern Hotel (Kebo Street) and the DeGregoire Hotel (Eden Street at West Street). The Building of Arts civic building, on Kebo Street at Cromwell Harbor Road, also perished.

Over of Acadia National Park were destroyed. The town&#x27;s business district was spared, including Mount Desert Street, where several former summer homes within a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places operate as inns.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Bar Harbor is situated on Frenchman Bay, with multiple smaller islands just offshore. Twice a day, at low tide, a sand bar (Bar Harbor&#x27;s namesake) is exposed, linking the town to Bar Island.

===Climate===
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Bar Harbor has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps. Bar Harbor and Mount Desert Island are located near the coastline and surrounded by the North American continent to the northeast and southwest. This location, combined with prevailing winds that are not from the Atlantic, gives Bar Harbor a continental climate with very cold winters for an island location at such a low latitude.

Mount Desert Island High School serves the four towns of Mount Desert Island, plus the outlying islands of Swans Island and the town of Cranberry Isles. The school also serves students from towns such as Trenton, Hancock, Lamoine and Mariaville on the mainland.

The College of the Atlantic is located in Bar Harbor, on Route 3.

==Transportation==

Bar Harbor&#x27;s main access road, from the north or south, is State Route 3, which is the coastal Eden Street taken from the Trenton Bridge. Upon entering the town limits from the north, Route 3 turns east onto Mount Desert Street, before turning south onto Main Street at Bar Harbor&#x27;s Village Green. It then circumnavigates the eastern portion of Mount Desert Island. Two other streets link Route 3 to Main Street: West Street (the first visitors from the north see) and Cottage Street. Another principal road, Eagle Lake Road, leads west, from its intersection with Eden Street, Mount Desert Street and Kebo Street, into the national park.

The town is served by the Hancock County–Bar Harbor Airport, which provides year-round nonstop flights to Boston, Massachusetts.

Bar Harbor is the western terminus for &quot;The CAT&quot;, a high-speed summer ferry service across the Gulf of Maine to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada, operated by Bay Ferries. The 3.5-hour route returned to service in 2022 after previously operating from 1955 to 2009.

Downeast Windjammer Cruise Lines operates regular summer ferry service across Frenchman Bay between Bar Harbor and Winter Harbor.

==Tourism==
The population of Bar Harbor, and Mount Desert Island generally, increases dramatically from May through October with &quot;seasonal&quot; residents and tourists. Many come for Acadia National Park, with its hiking trails and carriage roads, providing opportunities for biking, bird watching, and mountain climbing, with Cadillac Mountain being the highest point on the Atlantic seaboard.

Maritime tours are available, on a wide variety of boats, introducing visitors to puffins, whales, seals, seabirds, lighthouses, even lobsters, illustrating the working waterfront side of Bar Harbor.

The town has many historic houses, including large &quot;cottages&quot; along the shore, often converted to other uses today. To protect its housing supply for residents, citizens voted in 2021 to cap the number of vacation rentals in Bar Harbor.

In 2012, the American Planning Association named the Village Green one of their top ten Great Places in America for Public Spaces.

Cruise ships visit Bar Harbor from May through October (most in September and October), with 154 ship visits and more than 222,000 passengers in 2018. The forecast for 2019 was 176 ship visits and more than 254,000 passengers. In November 2022, concerned about crowding and overtourism, the citizens of Bar Harbor voted for a citizens&#x27; initiative to cap cruise ship disembarkations to 1,000 per day.

Bar Harbor also hosts many long-distance cyclists, as it is the eastern terminus of the Adventure Cycling Association&#x27;s Northern Tier Bicycle Route (Anacortes, Washington, is the western terminus), and the northern terminus of its Atlantic Coast Bicycle Route (Key West, Florida, is the southern terminus).

Mount Desert Island Ice Cream, ranked among the best ice cream shops in the country, made the news in 2010 when President Obama and his family made a surprise visit for a treat. Ben &amp; Bill&#x27;s Chocolate Emporium, with its lobster-flavored ice cream and lobster statue, is a popular stop.

==In popular culture==
Bar Harbor is featured in the 2007 book &quot;The Titan&#x27;s Curse&quot; by Rick Riordan as the setting of Westover Hall, a boarding school.

The &quot;Far Harbor&quot; add-on for the video game &quot;Fallout 4&quot; is located on Mount Desert Island, with Bar Harbor being reimagined as the post apocalyptic settlement of Far Harbor.

<text>Richmond is a town in Sagadahoc County, Maine, United States. The population was 3,522 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area, situated at the head of Merrymeeting Bay.

Richmond is located adjacent to the 2,019 acre state-owned and managed Steve Powell Wildlife Management Area on Swan Island, a wildlife sanctuary and tourist area listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Swan Island is a major wildlife tourist attraction for the town, especially during the summer.

Richmond is also known for its collection of Greek Revival homes, unique for the area.

==History==
The tract of land which comprises Richmond and Gardiner was purchased in 1649 from the Abenaki Indians by Christopher Lawson. The site of Richmond, as well as neighboring Swan Island, is believed by historians to have served as a summer settlement for the Abenaki.

In 1719, Fort Richmond was built by the Province of Massachusetts Bay on the western bank of the Kennebec River where Richmond is located today. Named for Ludovic Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond, the fort included a blockhouse, trading post, chapel, officers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; quarters, all surrounded by a palisade. In 1722 during the Dummer&#x27;s War, following the battle at Arrowsic, Maine, Fort Richmond was attacked in a three-hour siege by warriors from Norridgewock. Houses were burned and cattle slain, but the fort held. Brunswick and other settlements near the mouth of the Kennebec River were destroyed. The fort&#x27;s defenses were enlarged in 1723. On August 19, 1724, a militia of 208 soldiers departed Fort Richmond under command of captains Jeremiah Moulton and Johnson Harmon, traveling up the Kennebec in 17 whaleboats to sack Norridgewock. Fort Richmond would be rebuilt in 1740, attacked by another tribe in 1750, then dismantled in 1755 when forts Shirley (also called Frankfort), Western and Halifax were built upriver.

Settled in 1725, the community was part of Bowdoinham when it was incorporated in 1762 by the Massachusetts General Court. In 1790, Revolutionary War veteran John Plummer was awarded a land grant on Plummer Road, where his son built the surviving house about 1810. The Embargo of 1807 crippled the port&#x27;s economy, bankrupted merchants and created a recession which lingered through the War of 1812.

The town was set off and incorporated on February 10, 1823, taking its name from the old fort. Farms produced hay and potatoes. With the arrival of steamboats in the 1830s, Richmond boomed as a shipbuilding and trade center on the navigable Kennebec River estuary. Among the more important shipbuilders were T. J. Southard, also considered one of the town&#x27;s &quot;founding fathers&quot;. A brass foundry was established. The community also produced shoes, sails and wood products. Its peak years were between 1835 and 1857, endowing the town with a wealth of fine Greek Revival architecture.

Richmond is believed to have been a site along the Underground Railroad.

Richmond was once the center of the largest Slavic-speaking settlement in the United States. People of Ukrainian, Russian, and Polish heritage emigrated to the United States during World War II to settle along the Kennebec Valley. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was also a large influx of White Russian emigres, who earlier fled the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.

==Geography==

<text>The Committee for the Re-election of the President (or the Committee to Re-elect the President, CRP, but often mocked by the acronym CREEP) was, officially, a fundraising organization of United States President Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1972 re-election campaign during the Watergate scandal. In addition to fundraising, the organization also engaged in political sabotage against Nixon&#x27;s opponents, the various Democratic politicians running in the election.

== History ==
Planning began in late 1970 and an office opened in the spring of 1971. Besides its re-election activities, CRP employed money laundering and slush funds, and was involved in the Watergate scandal.

The CRP used $500,000 in funds raised to re-elect President Nixon to pay legal expenses for the five Watergate burglars. This act helped turn the burglary into an explosive political scandal. The burglars, as well as G. Gordon Liddy, E. Howard Hunt, John N. Mitchell, and other Nixon administration figures (Watergate Seven), were indicted over the break-in and their efforts to cover it up.

The acronym CREEP became popular due to the Watergate scandal.

<text>The Assumption of Mary is one of the four Marian dogmas of the Catholic Church. Pope Pius XII defined it on 1 November 1950 in his apostolic constitution as follows:

It leaves open the question of whether Mary died or whether she was raised to eternal life without bodily death.

The equivalent belief in the Eastern Christianity is the Dormition of the Mother of God or the &quot;Falling Asleep of the Mother of God&quot;.

The word &#x27;assumption&#x27; derives from the Latin word , meaning &#x27;taking up&#x27;.

Pope Pius XII expressed in his encyclical &quot;Munificentissimus Deus&quot; the hope that the belief in the bodily assumption of the virgin Mary into heaven &quot;will make our belief in our own resurrection stronger and render it more effective&quot;, while the Catechism of the Catholic Church adds: &quot;The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin is a singular participation in her Son&#x27;s Resurrection and an anticipation of the resurrection of other Christians.&quot;

==Traditions relating to the Assumption==
In some versions of the assumption narrative, the assumption is said to have taken place in Ephesus, in the House of the Virgin Mary. This is a much more recent and localised tradition. The earliest traditions say that Mary&#x27;s life ended in Jerusalem (see Tomb of the Virgin Mary).

According to the &quot;Passing of the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot;, attributed to Joseph of Arimathea, which is a later version of the Virgin Mary&#x27;s Dormition, probably from sometime after the early seventh century, one of the apostles, often identified as Thomas the Apostle, was not present at the death of Mary but his late arrival precipitates a reopening of Mary&#x27;s tomb, which is found to be empty except for her grave clothes. Finally, Mary drops her girdle down to the apostle from heaven as testament to the event. This incident is depicted in many later paintings of the Assumption.

Teaching of the Assumption of Mary became widespread across the Christian world, having been celebrated as early as the 5th century and having been established in the East by Emperor Maurice around AD 600. In a homily, John Damascene (675–749 AD), citing the third book of the Euthymiac History, records the following:

==History==
Some scholars argue that the Dormition and Assumption traditions can be traced early in church history in the apocryphal books, with Stephen J. Shoemaker stating: 

According to Shoemaker, the first known narrative to address the end of Mary&#x27;s life and her assumption is the apocryphal third- and possibly second-century (&quot;The Book of Mary&#x27;s Repose&quot;). Yet numerous features indicate that the &quot;Liber Requiei Mariae&quot;, or the &quot;Obsequies of the Virgin&quot;, as the text is called in Syriac, is even older than this ancient manuscript alone would suggest.

Another early source that speaks of the Assumption is the &quot;Six Books Dormition Apocryphon&quot;, so- called on account of its division into six separate books. It dates almost certainly to the middle of the fourth century, if not perhaps even earlier. Most significantly, the &quot;Six Books Dormition Apocryphon&quot; provides compelling evidence for an early cult of the Virgin nearly a century before the events of the Council of Ephesus.

&quot;The Greek Discourse on the Dormition&quot; or &quot;The Book of John Concerning the Falling Asleep of Mary&quot; (attributed to John the Theologian), is another anonymous narrative, and may even precede the &quot;Book of Mary&#x27;s Repose&quot;. This Greek document, is dated by Tischendorf as no later than the 4th century. but is dated by Shoemaker as later. 

The New Testament is silent regarding the end of her life. In the late 4th century Epiphanius of Salamis wrote he could find no authorized tradition about how her life ended. Nevertheless, although Epiphanius could not decide on the basis of biblical or church tradition whether Mary had died or remained immortal, his indecisive reflections suggest that some difference of opinion on the matter had already arisen in his time, and he identified three beliefs concerning her end: that she had a normal and peaceful death; that she died as a martyr; or that she did not die. Even more, in another text Epiphanius stated that Mary was like Elijah because she never died but was assumed, like him.

Other works that mention the assumption of Mary are the apocryphal treatise , bearing the name of St. John, which belongs however to the fourth or fifth century. It is also found in the apocryphal book , falsely ascribed to Melito of Sardis, and in a spurious letter attributed to Denis the Areopagite. 

The &quot;Euthymiac History&quot;, from the sixth century, is cited by John of Damascus, which narrates how Mary was assumed into heaven.

John of Damascus set out what had become the standard Eastern tradition, that &quot;Mary died in the presence of the Apostles, but that her tomb, when opened, upon the request of St Thomas, was found empty; wherefrom the Apostles concluded that her body was taken up to heaven.&quot;

The feast of the Dormition, arrived in the West in the early 7th century, its name changing to Assumption in some 9th century liturgical calendars. The feast was decreed for Constantinople on 15 August by the emperor Maurice in 600; about fifty years later it was introduced in Rome and is mentioned in a papal decree of Sergius (687-701), who fixed a procession for the feast. Pope Leo IV (reigned 847–855) gave the feast a vigil and an octave to solemnise it above all others, Pope Nicholas I (858–867) placed it on a par with Christmas and Easter, and Pope Benedict XIV (1740–1758) declared it &quot;a probable opinion, which to deny were impious and blasphemous&quot;. 

Scholars of the &quot;argued that during or shortly after the apostolic age a group of Jewish Christians in Jerusalem preserved an oral tradition about the end of the Virgin&#x27;s life&quot;. Thus, by pointing to oral tradition, they argued for the historicity of the assumption and Dormition narratives. According to Antoine Wenger &quot;the strikingly diverse traditions of Mary&#x27;s Dormition and Assumption arise from ‘a great variety of original types’, rather than being the result of a progressive modification of a single, original tradition&quot;. Simon Claude Mimouni and his predecessors have argued that belief in the Virgin&#x27;s Assumption is the final dogmatic development, rather than the point of origin, of these traditions.

There is a large number of accounts of assumption of the Virgin Mary, published in various languages (including Greek, Latin, Coptic, Syriac, Ethiopic, Arabic). The standard Greek text is the one attributed to St John the Theologian (Evangelist). The standard Latin is that attributed
to Melito of Sardis. Shoemaker mentions that &quot;the ancient narratives are neither clear nor unanimous in either supporting or contradicting the dogma&quot; of the assumption.

===Scriptural basis===

The apostolic constitution mentions several Holy Fathers, theologians and Doctors of the Church who held the Assumption of Mary, among them are Adrian I, Sergius I, Leo IV, John of Damascus, Amadeus of Lausanne, Modestus of Jerusalem, Anthony of Padua, Albertus Magnus, Thomas of Aquinas (Angelic Doctor), Bonaventure (Seraphic Doctor), Bernardino of Siena, Robert Bellarmine, Francis de Sales, Peter Canisius, Francisco Suárez, among others. The apostolic constitution adds: &quot;All these proofs and considerations of the holy Fathers and the theologians are based upon the Sacred Writings as their ultimate foundation.&quot; 

Father Jugie, expressed the view that Revelation 12:1–2 was the chief scriptural witness to the assumption:

This passage, Epiphanius proposes, may indicate that Mary did not die as other human beings, but somehow remained immortal, although he makes clear his own uncertainty and refrains from advocating this view. Ultimately Epiphanius concludes: &quot;[I] am not saying that she remained immortal. But neither am I affirming that she died.&quot;

Since the time of the early Church Fathers, this image of &quot;the woman clothed with the sun&quot; has had a threefold symbolism: the ancient people of Israel, the Church and Mary.

Many of the bishops cited Genesis 3:15, in which God is addressing the serpent in the Garden of Eden, as the primary confirmation of Mary&#x27;s assumption:

Many scholars connect Jesus&#x27; usage of the word &quot;woman&quot; to call Mary instead of calling her &quot;mother&quot; as a confirmation of Mary being the &quot;woman&quot; described in Genesis 3:15. Mary was often seen as the &quot;New Eve&quot;, who crushed the serpent&#x27;s head at the Annunciation by obeying the angel Gabriel when he said she would bear the Messiah (Luke 1:38).

The Catechism of the Catholic Church affirms that the account of the fall in Genesis 3 uses figurative language, and that the fall of mankind, by the seductive voice of the snake in the Bible, represents the fallen angel, Satan or &quot;the devil&quot;. Similarly, the great dragon in Revelation 12 is a representation of Satan, identified with the serpent from the garden who has enmity with the woman. Therefore, in Catholic thought, there is an association between this woman and Mary&#x27;s Assumption.

Among the many other passages noted by Pope Pius XII were the following:
* Psalm 132 (), greeting the return of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem (&quot;Arise, O Lord, into your resting place, you and the ark which you have sanctified!&quot;), where the ark is taken as the prophetic &quot;type&quot; of Mary;
* Revelation 11:19, in which John sees the Ark of the Covenant in heaven (this verse immediately precedes the vision of the woman clothed with the sun);
* Luke 1:28, in which the Archangel Gabriel greets Mary with the words, &quot;Hail Mary, full of grace&quot;, since Mary&#x27;s bodily assumption is a natural consequence of being full of grace;
* 1 Corinthians 15 () and Matthew 27 (), concerning the certainty of bodily resurrection for all who have faith in Jesus.
The Bible mentions two prominent figures, Enoch and Elijah, who were taken up to heaven, serving as important precedents for the assumption of Mary. Enoch, referenced in the Book of Genesis, is noted for his intimate walk with God and is described as having been &quot;taken&quot; by God (), an event that is also reported in the Epistle to the Hebrews (). Similarly, Elijah, the great prophet, was taken up to heaven in a whirlwind, accompanied by a chariot of fire, as recorded in 2 Kings ().

=== Catholic marian visionaries and the Assumption ===
In the 12th century, the German nun Elisabeth of Schönau was reportedly granted visions of Mary and her son which had a profound influence on the Western Church&#x27;s tradition. In her work &quot;Visio de resurrectione beate virginis Mariae&quot; relates how Mary was assumed in body and soul into Heaven. 

On 1 May 1950 Gilles Bouhours (a marian seer) reported to Pius XII a presumed message that the Virgin Mary would have ordered him to communicate to the pope on the dogma of the Assumption of the Holy Virgin Mary. It is said that Pius XII asked God, during the Holy Year of 1950, for a sign that could reassure him that the dogma of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary was actually wanted by God and when Gilles communicated the message to Pius XII, the pope considered this message the hoped-for sign. Six months after the private audience granted to Gilles by the pope, Pius XII himself proclaimed the dogma of the Assumption of body and soul of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven.

==Assumption versus Dormition==

Some Catholics believe that Mary died before being assumed, but they believe that she was miraculously resurrected before being assumed (mortalistic interpretation). Others believe she was assumed bodily into Heaven without first dying (immortalistic interpretation). Either understanding may be legitimately held by Catholics, with Eastern Catholics observing the Feast as the Dormition. It seems, however, that there is much more evidence for the mortalistic position in the Catholic traditions (liturgy, apocrypha, material culture). Pope John Paul II expressed the mortalistic position in his public speech.

Many theologians note by way of comparison that in the Catholic Church the Assumption is dogmatically defined, whilst in the Eastern Orthodox tradition the Dormition is less dogmatically than liturgically and mystically defined. Such differences spring from a larger pattern in the two traditions, wherein Catholic teachings are often dogmatically and authoritatively defined – in part because of the more centralized structure of the Catholic Church – whilst in Eastern Orthodoxy many doctrines are less authoritative.

The Latin Catholic Feast of the Assumption is celebrated on 15 August and the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholics celebrate the Dormition of the Mother of God (or Dormition of the Theotokos, the falling asleep of the Mother of God) on the same date, preceded by a 14-day fasting period. Eastern Christians believe that Mary died a natural death, that her soul was received by Christ upon death, that her body was resurrected after her death and that she was taken up into heaven bodily in anticipation of the general resurrection.

==Protestant views==
Views differ within Protestantism, with those with a theology closer to Catholicism sometimes believing in a bodily assumption whilst most Protestants do not.

===Lutheran views===
The Feast of the Assumption of Mary was retained by the Lutheran Church after the Reformation. Evangelical Lutheran Worship designates August 15 as a lesser festival named &quot;Mary, Mother of Our Lord&quot; while the current Lutheran Service Book formally calls it &quot;St. Mary, Mother of our Lord&quot;.

===Anglican views===
Within Anglicanism the Assumption of Mary is accepted by some, rejected by others, or regarded as adiaphora (&quot;a thing indifferent&quot;). The doctrine effectively disappeared from Anglican worship in 1549, partially returning in Anglo-Catholic tradition during the 20th century under different names. A Marian feast on 15 August is celebrated by the Church of England as a non-specific feast of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a feast called by the Scottish Episcopal Church simply &quot;Mary the Virgin&quot;, and in the US-based Episcopal Church it is observed as the feast of &quot;Saint Mary the Virgin: Mother of Our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;,
while other Anglican provinces have a feast of the Dormition – the Anglican Church of Canada&#x27;s Book of Common Prayer (1962), for instance, marks the day as the &quot;Falling Asleep of the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot;.

The Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission, which seeks to identify common ground between the two communions, released in 2004 a non-authoritative declaration meant for study and evaluation, the &quot;Seattle Statement&quot;; this &quot;agreed statement&quot; concludes that &quot;the teaching about Mary in the two definitions of the Assumption and the Immaculate Conception, understood within the biblical pattern of the economy of hope and grace, can be said to be consonant with the teaching of the Scriptures and the ancient common traditions&quot;.

===Other Protestant views===
The Protestant reformer Heinrich Bullinger believed in the assumption of Mary. His 1539 polemical treatise against idolatry expressed his belief that Mary&#x27;s (&quot;sacrosanct body&quot;) had been assumed into heaven by angels:

==Feasts and related fasting period==

Orthodox Christians fast for fourteen days before the Feast of the Assumption of Mary, including abstinence from sexual relations. Fasting in the Orthodox Churches generally consists of abstinence from certain food groups; during the Dormition fast, one observes a strict fast on weekdays, with wine and oil allowed on weekends and, additionally, fish on the Transfiguration (August 6).

The Assumption is important to many Christians, especially Catholics and Orthodox, as well as many Lutherans and Anglicans, as the Virgin Mary&#x27;s heavenly birthday (the day that Mary was received into Heaven). Belief about her acceptance into the glory of Heaven is seen by some Christians as the symbol of the promise made by Jesus to all enduring Christians that they too will be received into paradise. The Assumption of Mary is symbolised in the Fleur-de-lys Madonna.

The present Italian name of the holiday, , may derive from the Latin name, (&quot;Holidays of the Emperor Augustus&quot;), since the month of August took its name from the emperor. The feast was introduced by Bishop Cyril of Alexandria in the 5th century. In the course of Christianization, he put it on 15 August. In the middle of August, Augustus celebrated his victories over Marcus Antonius and Cleopatra at Actium and Alexandria with a three-day triumph. The anniversaries (and later only 15 August) were public holidays from then on throughout the Roman Empire.

The Solemnity of the Assumption on 15 August was celebrated in the Eastern Church from the 6th century. The Western Church adopted this date as a Holy Day of Obligation to commemorate the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a reference to the belief in a real, physical elevation of her sinless soul and incorrupt body into Heaven.

===Public holidays===

Assumption Day on 15 August is a nationwide public holiday in Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chile, Republic of Congo, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Croatia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cyprus, East Timor, France, Gabon, Greece, Georgia, Republic of Guinea, Haiti, Italy, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Republic of North Macedonia, Madagascar, Malta, Mauritius, Monaco, Montenegro (Albanian Catholics), Paraguay, Philippines (Maragondon, Cavite),Poland (coinciding with Polish Army Day), Portugal, Romania, Rwanda, Senegal, Seychelles, Slovenia, Spain, Syria, Tahiti, Togo, and Vanuatu; and was also in Hungary until 1948.

It is also a public holiday in parts of Germany (parts of Bavaria and Saarland) and Switzerland (in 14 of the 26 cantons) and Bosnia (the Croatian zone). In Guatemala, it is observed in Guatemala City and in the town of Santa Maria Nebaj, both of which claim her as their patron saint. Also, this day is combined with Mother&#x27;s Day in Costa Rica and parts of Belgium.

Prominent Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox countries in which Assumption Day is an important festival but is not recognised by the state as a public holiday include the Czech Republic, Ireland, Mexico, the Philippines and Russia. In Bulgaria, the Feast of the Assumption is the biggest Eastern Orthodox Christian celebration of the Holy Virgin. Celebrations include liturgies and votive offerings. In Varna, the day is celebrated with a procession of a holy icon, and with concerts and regattas.

In many places, religious parades and popular festivals are held to celebrate this day. In Canada, Assumption Day is the Fête Nationale of the Acadians, of whom she is the patroness saint. Some businesses close on that day in heavily francophone parts of New Brunswick, Canada. The Virgin Assumed in Heaven is also patroness of the Maltese Islands and her feast, celebrated on 15 August, apart from being a public holiday in Malta it is also celebrated with great solemnity in the local churches especially in the seven localities known as the Seba&#x27; Santa Marijiet. The Maltese localities which celebrate the Assumption of Our Lady are: Il-Mosta, Il-Qrendi, Ħal Kirkop, Ħal Għaxaq, Il-Gudja, Ħ&#x27;Attard, L-Imqabba and Victoria. The hamlet of Praha, Texas, holds a festival during which its population swells from approximately 25 to 5,000 people.

In Anglicanism and Lutheranism, the feast is now often kept, but without official use of the word &quot;Assumption&quot;. In Eastern Orthodox churches following the Julian Calendar, the feast day of Assumption of Mary falls on 28 August.

==Art==

The earliest known use of the Dormition is found on a sarcophagus in the crypt of a church in Zaragoza in Spain dated . The Assumption became a popular subject in Western Christian art, especially from the 12th century, and especially after the Reformation, when it was used to refute the Protestants and their downplaying of Mary&#x27;s role in salvation. Angels commonly carry her heavenward where she is to be crowned by Christ, while the Apostles below surround her empty tomb as they stare up in awe. Caravaggio, the &quot;father&quot; of the Baroque movement, caused a stir by depicting her as a decaying corpse, quite contrary to the doctrine promoted by the church; more orthodox examples include works by El Greco, Rubens, Annibale Carracci, and Nicolas Poussin, the last replacing the Apostles with putti throwing flowers into the tomb.

<text>The subscription business model is a business model in which a customer must pay a recurring price at regular intervals for access to a product or service. The model was pioneered by publishers of books and periodicals in the 17th century, and is now used by many businesses, websites and even pharmaceutical companies in partnership with governments.

==Subscriptions==
Rather than selling products individually, a subscription offers periodic (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, semi-annual, yearly/annual, or seasonal) use or access to a product or service, or, in the case of performance-oriented organizations such as opera companies, tickets to the entire run of some set number of (e.g., five to fifteen) scheduled performances for a whole season. Thus, a one-time sale of a product can become a recurring sale and build brand loyalty.

Industries that use this model include mail order book sales clubs and music sales clubs, private web mail providers, cable television, satellite television providers with pay television channels, providers with digital catalogs with downloadable music or eBooks, audiobooks, satellite radio, telephone companies, mobile network operators, internet providers, software publishers, websites (e.g., blogging websites), business solutions providers, financial firms, health clubs, lawn mowing and snowplowing services, pharmaceuticals, renting an apartment, property taxes, as well as the traditional newspapers, magazines, and academic journals.

Renewal of a subscription may be periodic and activated automatically so that the cost of a new period is automatically paid for by a pre-authorized charge to a credit card or a checking account. A common variation of the model in online games and on websites is the &quot;freemium&quot; model, in which the first tier of content is free. Still, access to premium features (for example, game power-ups or article archives) is limited to paying subscribers.

In addition to the freemium model, other subscription pricing variations are gaining traction. For instance, the tiered pricing model is frequently used in software as a service (SaaS) platforms, offering customers different access levels and features based on their subscription tier. This model is particularly effective for tailoring services to customer requirements. Another approach is the usage-based pricing model, which calculates charges based on the extent of service or product utilization by the customer. This model is becoming increasingly prevalent, especially in services where customer usage varies significantly.

===Types and examples===
There are different categories of subscriptions:
*A subscription for a fixed set of goods or services.
** Periodicals, such as a newspaper or magazine, have several types of subscriptions:
*** Paid circulation
*** Non-paid circulation
*** Controlled circulation
** Subscription boxes contain a variety of consumables
*** Community-supported agriculture
*** Meal delivery service
*** Meal kit delivery service
*A subscription for unlimited use of a service or collection of services. Usage may be personal and non-transferable for a family or, under certain circumstances, for a group utilizing a service simultaneously. In the publishing industry, a subscription to a bundle of several journals, at a discounted price, is known as a &quot;big deal&quot;.
** Software as a service
*A subscription where a consumer subscribes to purchase a product periodically. This is also known as the convenience model because it is convenient for the customer not to have to remember to find their product and buy it periodically. This model has been popularized by companies like Dollar Shave Club, Birchbox, and OrderGroove. Based on their success, many other retailers have begun to offer subscription model services. 
** For example, a company&#x27;s subscription to a rail pass may not be individualized but might permit all firm employees to use the service. Subscriptions of this type are rare for goods with an unlimited supply and many luxury services.
*A subscription for basic access or minimal service plus some additional charge depending on usage. A basic telephone service pays a pre-determined fee for monthly use. Still, it may have extra charges for other services such as long-distance calls, directory, and pay-per-call services. When the basic service is offered free of charge, this business model is often referred to as Freemium.
*An online subscription supports content creators using crowdfunding. Fans can interact and send tips to the content creator but also have access to exclusive paid content. Popular examples are Patreon and OnlyFans.

===Publishing===
In publishing, the subscription model typically involves a paywall, paysite, or other &quot;toll-access&quot; system (named in opposition to open access). As revenues from digital advertising diminish, a paid subscription model is being favoured by more publishers who see it as a comparatively stable income stream.

== Academic journals ==

In the field of academic publishing, the subscription business model means that articles of a specific journal or conference proceedings are only available to subscribers. Subscriptions are typically sold to universities and other higher education institutions and research institutes, though some academic publishers also sell individual subscriptions or access to individual articles.

In contrast with other media such as newspapers, subscription fees to academic publishers generally do not go towards supporting the creation of the content: the scientific articles are written by scientists and reviewed by other scientists as part of their work duties. The publisher does not pay the paper authors and reviewers. In this light, the subscription model has been called undesirable by proponents of the open access movement.

Academic publications that use the subscription model are called &quot;closed-access&quot; in opposition to their open-access counterparts.

==Effects==
===Vendors===
Businesses benefit because they are assured a predictable and constant revenue stream from subscribed individuals for the duration of the subscriber&#x27;s agreement. Not only does this greatly reduce uncertainty and the riskiness of the enterprise, but it often provides payment in advance (as with magazines, and concert tickets), while allowing customers to become greatly attached to using the service and, therefore, more likely to extend by signing an agreement for the next period close to when the current agreement expires.

In an integrated software solution, for example, the subscription pricing structure is designed so that the revenue stream from the recurring subscriptions is considerably more significant than the revenue from simple one-time purchases. Some subscription schemes (like magazines) also increase sales by not allowing subscribers to accept or reject any specific issue. This reduces customer acquisition costs and allows personalized marketing or database marketing. However, the system requires that the business have an accurate, reliable, and timely way to manage and track subscriptions.

From a marketing-analyst perspective, the vendor has the added benefit of knowing the number of currently active members since a subscription typically involves a contractual agreement. This so-called &#x27;contractual&#x27; setting facilitates customer relationship management to a large extent because the analyst knows who is an active customer and who recently churned.

Additional benefits include a higher average customer lifetime value (ACLV) than that of nonrecurring business models, greater customer inertia and a more committed customer base as it transitions from purchase to opt-out decisions, and more potential for upselling and cross-selling other products or services.

Some software companies such as Adobe and Autodesk have moved from a perpetual licensing model to a subscription model, known as &quot;software as a service&quot;. This move has significant implications for sales and customer support organizations. Over time, the need to close large deals decreases, resulting in lower sales costs. However, the size of the customer support organization increases so that the paying customers stay happy.

===Customers===
Consumers may find subscriptions convenient if they believe they will buy a product regularly and might save money. The customer saves time for repeated delivery of the product or service.

Subscriptions which exist to support clubs and organizations call their subscribers &quot;members&quot; and they are given access to a group with similar interests. 

Subscription pricing can make it easier to pay for expensive items since they can often be paid for over time and thus can make the product seem more affordable. On the other hand, most newspaper and magazine-type subscriptions are paid upfront, which may prevent some customers from subscribing. Fixed prices may be an advantage for consumers who frequently use those services. However, it could disadvantage a customer who plans to use the service frequently but later does not. The commitment to paying for a package may have been more expensive than a single purchase. In addition, subscription models increase the possibility of vendor lock-in, which can have fatally business-critical implications for a customer if its business depends on the availability of software: For example, without an online connection to a licensing server to verify the licensing status every once in a while, a software under a subscription-model would typically stop functioning or fall back to the functionality of a freemium version, thereby making it impossible (to continue) to use the software in remote places or particularly secure environments without internet access, after the vendor has stopped supporting the version or software, or even has gone out of business leaving the customer without a chance to renew the subscription and access his data or designs maintained with the software (in some businesses it is important to have full access even to old files for decades). Also, consumers may find repeated payments to be onerous.

Subscription models often require or allow the business to gather substantial amounts of information from the customer (such as magazine mailing lists), and this raises issues of privacy.

A subscription model may benefit the software buyer if it forces the supplier to improve its product. Accordingly, a psychological phenomenon may occur when a customer renews a subscription, that may not occur during a one-time transaction: if the buyer is not satisfied with the service, he/she can leave the subscription to expire and find another seller.

===Environment===
Because customers may only need or want some of the items received, this can lead to waste and an adverse effect on the environment, depending on the products. Greater volumes of production, greater energy and natural resource consumption, and subsequently greater disposal costs are incurred.

Subscription models also create the opposite effect. This can be illustrated by subscribing to a service for mowing lawns. The effective use of a single mower increases when mowing for a collection of homes; instead of every family owning a lawnmower that is not used as much as the service-providing mower, the use of resources for producing lawnmowers, therefore, decreases while lawns stay cut.

<text>Operation Ranch Hand was a U.S. military operation during the Vietnam War, lasting from 1962 until 1971. Largely inspired by the British use of chemicals 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D (Agent Orange) during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s, it was part of the overall herbicidal warfare program during the war called &quot;Operation Trail Dust&quot;. &quot;Ranch Hand&quot; involved spraying an estimated of defoliants and herbicides over rural areas of South Vietnam in an attempt to deprive the Viet Cong of food and vegetation cover. Areas of Laos and Cambodia were also sprayed to a lesser extent. According to the Vietnamese government, the chemicals caused 400,000 deaths. The United States government has described these figures as &quot;unreliable&quot;.

Nearly 20,000 sorties were flown between 1961 and 1971. The &quot;Ranch Handers&quot; motto was &quot;Only you can prevent a forest&quot; – a take on the popular U.S. Forest Service poster slogan of Smokey Bear. During the ten years of spraying, over of forest and of crops were heavily damaged or destroyed. Around 20% of the forests of South Vietnam were sprayed at least once.

The herbicides were sprayed by the U.S. Air Force flying C-123s using the call sign &quot;Hades&quot;. The planes were fitted with specially developed spray tanks with a capacity of of herbicides. A plane sprayed a swath of land that was wide and long in about 4½ minutes, at a rate of about . Sorties usually consisted of three to five aircraft flying side by side. 95% of the herbicides and defoliants used in the war were sprayed by the U.S. Air Force as part of Operation Ranch Hand. The remaining 5% were sprayed by the U.S. Chemical Corps, other military branches, and the Republic of Vietnam using hand sprayers, spray trucks, helicopters and boats, primarily around U.S. military installations.

== Defoliants ==

The herbicides used were sprayed at up to 50 times the concentration than for normal agricultural use. The most common herbicide used was Herbicide Orange, more commonly referred to as Agent Orange: a fifty-fifty mixture of two herbicides 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and 2,4,5-T (2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid) manufactured for the U.S. Department of Defense primarily by Monsanto Corporation and Dow Chemical. The other most common color-coded &quot;Ranch Hand&quot; herbicides were Agent Blue (cacodylic acid) that was primarily used against food crops, and Agent White which was often used when Agent Orange was not available.

The Agents used are known as the Rainbow Herbicides with their active ingredients, and years used were as follows:
*Agent Green: 100% &quot;n&quot;-butyl ester 2,4,5-T, used prior to 1966
*Agent Pink: 100% 2,4,5-T (60% &quot;n&quot;-butyl ester 2,4,5-T, and 40% iso-butyl ester of 2,4,5-T) used prior to 1966
*Agent Purple: 50% 2,4,5-T (30% &quot;n&quot;-butyl ester of 2,4,5-T, and 20% iso-butyl ester of 2,4,5-T) and 50% &quot;n&quot;-butyl ester of 2,4-D used 1961–1965
*Agent Blue (Phytar 560G): 65.6% organic Arsenicical (cacodylic acid (Ansar 138) and its sodium salt sodium cacodylate) used from 1962–1971 in powder and water solution
*Agent White (Tordon 101): 21.2% (acid weight basis) triisopropanolamine salts of 2,4-D and 5.7% picloram used 1966–1971
*Agent Orange or Herbicide Orange, (HO): 50% &quot;n&quot;-butyl ester 2,4-D and 50% &quot;n&quot;-butyl ester 2,4,5-T used 1965–1970
*Agent Orange II:50% n-butyl ester 2,4-D and 50% isooctyl ester 2,4,5-T used after 1968.
*Agent Orange III: 66.6% n-butyl 2,4-D and 33.3% n-butyl ester 2,4,5-T.
*Enhanced Agent Orange, Orange Plus, Super Orange (SO), or DOW Herbicide M-3393: standardized Agent Orange mixture of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T combined with an oil-based mixture of picloram, a proprietary Dow Chemical product called Tordon 101, an ingredient of Agent White.

The herbicides were procured by the U.S. military from Dow Chemical Company (all but Agent Blue), Monsanto (Agent Orange, Agent Purple, and Agent Pink), Hercules Inc. (Agent Orange and Agent Purple), Thompson-Hayward Chemical Company (Agent Orange and Agent Pink), Diamond Alkali/Shamrock Company (Agent Orange, Agent Blue, Agent Purple, and Agent Pink), United States Rubber Company (Agent Orange), Thompson Chemicals Corporation (Agent Orange and Agent Pink), Agrisect Company (Agent Orange and Agent Purple), Hoffman-Taff Inc. (Agent Orange), and the Ansul Chemical Company (Agent Blue). In April 1967, the entire American domestic production of 2,4,5-T was confiscated by the military; foreign sources were also tapped into, including the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI).

65% of the herbicides used contained 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid that was contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, a &quot;&quot;known human carcinogen&quot;... by several different routes of exposure, including oral, dermal, and intraperitoneal&quot;. About of dioxin-contaminated herbicides were sprayed over Southeast Asia (mainly in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos) during American combat operations in the Vietnam War.

In 2005, a New Zealand government minister was quoted and widely reported as saying that Agent Orange chemicals had been supplied from New Zealand to the United States military during the conflict. Shortly after, the same minister claimed to have been mis-quoted, although this point was less widely reported. From 1962 to 1987, &quot;2,4,5-T&quot; herbicide had been manufactured at an Ivon Watkins-Dow plant in New Plymouth for domestic use, however it has not been proven that the herbicide had been exported for use by the U.S military in Vietnam.

==Operations==
For most of the war, Operation Ranch Hand was based at Bien Hoa Air Base (1966–1970), for operations in the Mekong Delta region where U.S. Navy patrol boats were vulnerable to attack from areas of undergrowth along the water&#x27;s edge. Storage, mixing, loading, and washing areas and a parking ramp were located just off the base&#x27;s inside taxiway between the Hot Cargo Ramp and the control tower. For operations along the central coast and the Ho Chi Minh trail regions, &quot;Ranch Hand&quot; operated out of Da Nang Air Base (1964–1971). Other bases of operation included Phù Cát Air Base (1968–1970), Tan Son Nhut Air Base (1962–1966), Nha Trang Air Base (1968–69), Phan Rang Air Base (1970–1972), and Tuy Hoa Air Base (1971–1972). Other bases were also used as temporary staging areas for &quot;Ranch Hand&quot;. The Da Nang, Bien Hoa and Phu Cat Air bases are still heavily contaminated with dioxin from the herbicides, and have been placed on a priority list for containment and clean-up by the Vietnamese government.

The first aerial spraying of herbicides was a test run conducted on 10 August 1961 in a village north of Đắk Tô against foliage. Testing continued over the next year and even though there was doubt in the State Department, the Pentagon and the White House as to the efficacy of the herbicides, Operation Ranch Hand began in early 1962. Individual spray runs had to be approved by President John F. Kennedy until November 1962, when Kennedy gave the authority to approve most spray runs to the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam and the U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam. &quot;Ranch Hand&quot; was given final approval to spray targets in eastern Laos in December 1965.

The issue of whether or not to allow crop destruction was under great debate due to its potential of violating the Geneva Protocol. However, American officials pointed out that the British had previously used 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D (virtually identical to America&#x27;s use in Vietnam) on a large scale throughout the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s in order to destroy bushes, crops, and trees in effort to deny communist insurgents the cover they needed to ambush passing convoys. Indeed, Secretary of State Dean Rusk told President Kennedy on 24 November 1961, that &quot;[t]he use of defoliant does not violate any rule of international law concerning the conduct of chemical warfare and is an accepted tactic of war. Precedent has been established by the British during the emergency in Malaya in their use of aircraft for destroying crops by chemical spraying.&quot; The president of South Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem began to push the U.S. Military Advisory Group in Vietnam and the White House to begin crop destruction in September 1961, but it was not until October 1962 when the White House gave approval for limited testing of Agent Blue against crops in an area believed to be controlled by the Viet Cong. Soon after, crop destruction became an integral part of the &quot;Ranch Hand&quot; program.

Targets for the spray runs were carefully selected to satisfy the strategic and psychological operations goals of the U.S. and South Vietnamese military. Spray runs were surveyed to pinpoint the target area and then placed on a priority list. Due to the low altitude (ideally required for spraying, the C-123s were escorted by fighter aircraft or helicopter gunship that would strafe or bomb the target area in order to draw out any ground fire if the area was believed to be &#x27;hot&#x27;. Spray runs were planned to enable as straight a run as possible to limit the amount of time the planes flew at low altitude. Data on the spray runs, their targets, the herbicide used and amount used, weather conditions and other details were recorded and later put into a database called the Herbicide Reporting System (HERBS) tapes.

The effectiveness of the spraying was influenced by many factors including weather and terrain. Spray runs occurred during the early morning hours before temperatures rose above and the winds picked up. Mangroves in the Delta region required only one spraying and did not survive once defoliated, whereas dense forests in the uplands required two or more spray runs. Within two to three weeks of spraying, the leaves would drop from the trees, which would remain bare until the next rainy season. In order to defoliate the lower stories of forest cover, one or more follow-up spray runs were needed. About 10 percent of the trees sprayed died from a single spray run. Multiple spraying resulted in increased mortality for the trees, as did following up the herbicide missions with napalm or bombing strikes.

==Scientific community reaction==
The use of herbicides in the Vietnam War was controversial from the beginning, particularly for crop destruction. The scientific community began to protest the use of herbicides in Vietnam as early as 1964, when the Federation of American Scientists objected to the use of defoliants. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) issued a resolution in 1966 calling for a field investigation of the herbicide program in Vietnam. In 1967, seventeen Nobel laureates and 5,000 other scientists signed a petition asking for the immediate end to the use of herbicides in Vietnam.

In 1970, AAAS sent a team of scientists—the Herbicide Assessment Commission (HAC), consisting of Matthew Meselson, Arthur Westing, John Constable, and Robert Cook—to conduct field tests of the ecological impacts of the herbicide program in Vietnam. A 1969 study by the Bionetics Research Laboratory found that 2,4,5-T could cause birth defects and stillbirths in mice. The U.S. government suspended the military use of 2,4,5-T in the U.S. in April 1970. Sporadic crop destruction sorties using Agent Blue and Agent White continued throughout 1970 until the final &quot;Ranch Hand&quot; run was flown on 7 January 1971.

==Human impact==
The use of herbicides as a defoliant had long-term destructive effects on the people of Vietnam and their land and ecology, as well as on those who fled in the mass exodus from 1978 to the early 1990s. According to the Vietnamese government, the US program exposed approximately 4.8 million Vietnamese people to Agent Orange, resulting in 400,000 deaths due to a range of cancers and other ailments.

Hindsight corrective studies indicate that previous estimates of Agent Orange exposure were biased by government intervention and under-guessing, such that current estimates for dioxin release are almost double those previously predicted. According to the Vietnamese Government, census data indicates that the United States military directly sprayed upon millions of Vietnamese during strategic Agent Orange use.

According to the Vietnamese government, the program caused three million Vietnamese health problems, with 150,000 children born with severe birth defects, and 24% of the area of Vietnam being defoliated. The Red Cross of Vietnam estimates that up to one million people were disabled or have health problems as a result of exposure to Agent Orange. The United States government has described these figures as &quot;unreliable&quot;. According to the Department of Veteran Affairs, 2.6 million U.S. military personnel were exposed and hundreds of thousands of veterans are eligible for treatment for Agent Orange-related illnesses.

<text>Measure 11, also known as &quot;One Strike You&#x27;re Out&quot;, was a citizens&#x27; initiative passed in 1994 in the U.S. State of Oregon. This statutory enactment established mandatory minimum sentencing for several crimes. The measure was approved in the November 8, 1994 general election with 788,695 votes in favor, and 412,816 votes against.

The sentencing judge cannot give a lesser sentence than that prescribed by Measure 11, nor can a prisoner&#x27;s sentence be reduced for good behavior. Prisoners cannot be paroled prior to serving their minimum sentence.

The measure applies to all defendants aged 15 and over, requiring juveniles 15 and over charged with these crimes to be tried as adults.

The measure was placed on the ballot via initiative petition by Crime Victims United, a tough-on-crime political group. Then-State Representative Kevin Mannix, who sponsored the measure, has since argued that violent criminals cannot be reformed through probation or short prison sentences, and that the time they are kept incarcerated is itself a benefit to society.

Ballot Measure 10, also passed in 1994, permitted the Oregon Legislative Assembly to change Measure 11, but only with a 2/3 vote in each chamber. The legislature has done so several times.

Legislative Attempts to Alter or Repeal Measure 11:

*House Bill 3439 passed June 1995: Added Attempted Murder and Attempted Aggravated Murder.
*Senate Bill 1049 passed July 1997: Added Arson I (when a serious physical threat is involved), Compelling Prostitution, and Use of Child in Display of Sex Act. This also allowed for departures from the mandatory minimum sentencing for some Assault II, Kidnapping II, and Robbery II convictions.
*House Bill 2494 passed August 1999: Allowed for departures from the mandatory minimum sentence for some Manslaughter II convictions committed after October 23, 1999.
*Measure 94 defeated November 2000: Attempt to repeal mandatory minimum sentencing in Oregon; defeated 387,068 to 1,073,275.[14]
*House Bill 2379 passed July 2001: Allowed for departure from the mandatory minimum sentence for some Rape II, Sodomy II, Sexual Penetration II, and Sexual Abuse I convictions after January 1, 2002.
*Senate Bill 1008 passed in May 2019 (pending signature from the Governor): The bill is a major overhaul of many Measure 11 stipulations. Key parts of the bill seek to address the impacts of Measure 11 on youth reported by the Oregon Justice Resource Center, such as:
**&quot;Second Look&quot; hearings for any juvenile convicted in adult court after completion of half their sentence. Judges are to consider factors such as remorse and rehabilitation, and may reduce the remainder of the juvenile&#x27;s sentence to community-based supervision.
**Prohibiting life without parole for minors.
**Ensuring minors of 15 years or older are not automatically tried as adults for major crimes.

Proponents of Measure 11 argued that judges had been too lenient in sentencing violent offenders. They saw the measure as critical for lowering crime rates.

Opponents of Measure 11 argued that judges should be allowed discretion in sentencing and should be able to account for the particular circumstances of a given crime. They also objected to the requirement that many youth defendants be tried as adults.

Oregon&#x27;s prison population increased after Measure 11, and as of 2004, 41% of the growth was attributed to the direct or indirect impact of Measure 11. Crime rates in Oregon decreased between 1994 and 2000, but increased in 2001; opponents of Measure 11 noted that the trend mirrored national trends, while acknowledging that some likely re-offenders were imprisoned as a result of the law.

The effectiveness of Measure 11 to deter crime is further questioned when compared to research about mandatory minimums. Research has repeatedly disproven mandatory minimums as public safety tools. For example, a 1993 meta-analysis report compiled from 50 different studies found mandatory minimums’ lengthier prison sentences produced higher rates of recidivism and a tendency for lower-risk offenders to experience more negative outcomes.

== Background and context ==
Prior to 1989, Oregon judges would decide whether a convicted felon should be put on probation or sent to prison, and for those sent to prison, set a maximum sentence (known as an &quot;indeterminate sentence.&quot;) Based on a subsequent decision by the Parole Board, which used an assessment of good behavior, rehabilitative efforts, and criminal case, the average offender would serve a fraction of the sentence handed down by the judge.

The Oregon Legislative Assembly established felony sentencing guidelines in 1989, in an attempt to achieve the following four goals:
* Proportional punishment, imposing the most severe sentences on the most serious offenders
* Truth in sentencing, so the judge&#x27;s sentence would more closely reflect actual prison time
* Sentence uniformity, to reduce disparities among judges
* Maintenance of correctional capacity consistent with sentencing policy, so the criminal justice system would be able to deliver proposed penalties.

Parole release for most offenders was abolished by the establishment of these guidelines. The Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision continues to have release authority over those prison inmates sentenced for crimes committed prior to November 1, 1989, those sentenced by the courts as dangerous offenders, and for murderers and aggravated murderers who are eligible for parole, regardless of the date of their crimes. Other prisoners began serving at least 80% of their sentences.

Measure 11, passed in 1994, affected only specific crimes, which were covered by the sentencing guidelines from 1989 to 1994.

Various exceptions exist to the guidelines, and to Measure 11 restrictions on sentencing.

== Impact on youth ==
In February 2018, Oregon Council on Civil Rights, in collaboration with the Oregon Justice Resource Center, released a report on the impact of Measure 11 on Oregon&#x27;s young people and whether the law is out-of-step with legal and scientific developments of recent years.

According to the report, Measure 11 mandates that juveniles hold the same culpability as adults, despite brain science declaring otherwise. The US Supreme Court has ruled several times in regards to the sentencing of minor:

* Roper v. Simmons, which ruled that juveniles cannot be sentenced to death.
* Graham v. Florida, which ruled that juvenile life without parole is unconstitutional for non-homicide juvenile offenders.
* Miller v. Alabama, which ruled that mandatory juvenile life without parole is unconstitutional for all crimes.
* Montgomery v. Louisiana, which confirms that the miller ruling now be applied retroactively.
* Key conceptual takeaways from the supreme court decisions:
** Youth have a unique capacity for reform.
** Youth are fundamentally different from, and less culpable than, adults
** All youth should have a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate their ability to change.
** Lengthy sentences that fail to take into consideration the mitigating qualities of youth are in violation of their Eighth Amendment rights.
** Youth should have access to a “meaningful opportunity for release.

Some key statistics:

* Today, Oregon incarcerates young people at a higher rate than almost every other state in the country, including Texas and Louisiana. In fact, Oregon has the second highest rate of youth transfers to adult court in the nation, with young people - especially youth of color - subjected to lifelong consequences as a result.
* In 2012, Oregon convicted black youth of Measure 11 offenses at 17 times the rate of their white counterparts.
* Black youth account for 15.5% of Measure 11 indictments but only 1.8% of the general population in Oregon (resulting in an overrepresentation of around 8.6 times.)
* The average relative rate of disparity (measure by the relative rate index or RRI2 ) between black and white youth for the five most common Measure 11 crimes is 15.26. The overall RRI for all crimes covered in this study was 13.6.
* Oregon taxpayers bear a significant burden for youth incarceration. Measure 11 offenders require close custody, the most expensive form of state confinement, which can result in costs of as much as $263 per day and $95,995 per year, per juvenile.

== Impact on women ==
In October 2018, the annual Women in Prison Conference held by the Oregon Justice Resource Center Women&#x27;s Justice Project focused primarily on the effects of mandatory minimum sentences imposed by Measure 11 on female defendants. The conference highlights similar concerns and statistics echoed by Measure 11&#x27;s original opponents in concerns to youth, including:

* Oregon&#x27;s incarceration rate for women has tripled since 1994 when Measure 11 when was first passed
* Many convicted females had mitigating circumstances at the times of their cases, which are barred from consideration during sentencing under Measure 11&#x27;s mandatory minimums. Coffee Creek Correctional Facility reported 2015 that 46% of their intakes that year experienced domestic violence; 76% were unemployed; over half had children; and 38% had not finished high school.

== Political impact ==
The passage of Measure 11 was a central issue of Governor John Kitzhaber&#x27;s first term, and remains a matter of controversy in Oregon politics. Supporters credit Measure 11 for reducing crime rates.[12] Opponents argue Measure 11 pressures innocent defendants into plea bargains for lesser (non-Measure 11) crimes, due to fear of mandatory sentences.[13]

<doc id="259344" wikidata="Q830643" url="?curid=259344" title="The Egyptian">
<text>The Egyptian (&quot;Sinuhe egyptiläinen&quot;, Sinuhe the Egyptian) is a historical novel by Mika Waltari. It was first published in Finnish in 1945, and in an abridged English translation by Naomi Walford in 1949, from Swedish rather than Finnish. Regarded as &quot;one of the greatest books in Finnish literary history&quot;, it is, so far, the only Finnish novel to be adapted into a Hollywood film, which happened in 1954.

&quot;The Egyptian&quot; is the first and the most successful of Waltari&#x27;s great historical novels, and that which gained him international fame. It is set in Ancient Egypt, mostly during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten of the 18th Dynasty, whom some have claimed to be the first monotheistic ruler in the world.

The novel is known for its high-level historical accuracy regarding the life and culture of the period depicted. At the same time, it also carries a pessimistic message of the essential sameness of flawed human nature throughout the ages.

==Summary==
The protagonist of the novel is the fictional character Sinuhe, the royal physician, who tells the story in exile after Akhenaten&#x27;s fall and death. Apart from incidents in Egypt, the novel charts Sinuhe&#x27;s travels in then Egyptian-dominated Syria (Levant), in Mitanni, Babylon, Minoan Crete, and among the Hittites.

The main character of the novel is named after a character in an ancient Egyptian text commonly known as the &quot;Story of Sinuhe&quot;. The original story dates to a time long before that of Akhenaten: texts are known from as early as the 12th dynasty.

Supporting historical characters include the old Pharaoh Amenhotep III and his conniving favorite wife, Tiy; the wife of Akhenaten, Nefertiti; the listless young Tutankhamun (King Tut), who succeeded as Pharaoh after Akhenaten&#x27;s downfall; and the two common-born successors who were, according to this author, integral parts of the rise and fall of the Amarna heresy of Akhenaten: the priest and later Pharaoh Ay and the warrior-general and then finally Pharaoh, Horemheb. Though never appearing onstage, throughout the book the Hittite King Suppiluliuma I appears as a brooding threatening figure of a completely ruthless conqueror and tyrannical ruler.
Other historical figures with whom the protagonist has direct dealings are: Aziru (ruler of Amurru kingdom), Thutmose (sculptor), Burna-Buriash II (Babylonian king), and, under a different name, Zannanza, son of Suppiluliuma I. Zannanza&#x27;s bride is a collage of at least three historical figures: herself, first wife of Horemheb and, by him, mother of Ramesses I. Historical Horemheb died childless.

===Plot===

Sinuhe recounts, in his old age at his location of forced exile by the Red Sea coast, the events of his life. His tone expresses cynicism, bitterness and disappointment; he says humans are vile and will never change, and that he&#x27;s writing down his story for therapeutic reasons alone and for something to do in the rugged and desolate desert landscape.

Sinuhe begins his life as a foundling discovered in a reed boat in the Nile, and grows up in the poor part of Thebes. His adoptive father Senmut is a doctor, and Sinuhe decides to walk in his footsteps. As an assistant to a royal doctor who knows his adoptive father, Sinuhe is allowed to visit the court, during a trepanation on the dying Amenhotep III – here Sinuhe, the young crown prince Akhenaten and Horemheb meet for the first time. Well educated, Sinuhe sets up a clinic and acquires the sly and eloquent slave Kaptah, who will be his companion and close friend throughout his life.

One day he gets acquainted with the gorgeous woman Nefernefernefer and is bewitched by her. Nefernefernefer gets Sinuhe to give her everything he owns – even his adoptive parents&#x27; house and grave. When the woman has realised that Sinuhe has run out of possessions, she gets rid of him. Ashamed and dishonored, Sinuhe arranges his adoptive parents to be embalmed and buries them in the Valley of the Kings (they had taken their lives before eviction), after which he decides to go to exile in the company of Kaptah to Levant, which was under Egyptian rule at the time.

In Syria, his medical skill earns him fame and wealth. During an Egyptian military operation in Syria, he re-encounters Horemheb, serving as a military commander. From this, Sinuhe is commissioned to travel at his expense in the known world to determine what military potential the established nations have.

Sinuhe, in company of Kaptah, travels first to Babylon where he engages in science and socializes with the city&#x27;s scholars. One day he is summoned to the sick king Burraburiash, whom he manages to cure. Soon Kaptah is selected for the traditional day of the false king, where the city&#x27;s greatest fool is king for a day and then killed. A young Cretan woman named Minea has been recently acquired to the king&#x27;s harem against her will; during a feast, Sinuhe, in the process of falling in love with her, smuggles Minea and Kaptah from the palace and flees with the two to the neighboring country Mitanni. From there they proceed to Anatolia and to the fast-growing Hittite empire. Sinuhe and his companions feel unhappy about the militarism and tough rule of law that characterize the kingdom of the Hittites, and they decide to leave Anatolia and sail to Crete, Minea&#x27;s homeland.

Minea has grown up with the mission to sacrifice herself as a virgin to the local bull god who lives in a mountain cave at the sea. Sinuhe is horrified by this and fears that he will not see her again. In the evening before Minea should enter the mountain cave, they marry each other unofficially. A while after Minea has been escorted into the mountain cave, Sinuhe enters the cave in search for her. He finds Minea&#x27;s dead body and the remains of the Cretan god (described as a bull-headed sea serpent), and realises that she has been killed by the god&#x27;s high priest Minotaurus to prevent her from returning and telling the god is dead. Sinuhe loses his mind from grief, but Kaptah eventually succeeds in calming him down and convinces him that it&#x27;s best to move on and return to Syria.

In Syria, Sinuhe returns to medical profession and regains his previous status. He notices, however, that the Egyptian sovereignty in the area has now begun to be questioned and threatened. This rebellious mood is triggered not in the least by the Syrian, Hittite-friendly Prince Aziru, whom Sinuhe still befriends, among other things, through a medical assignment.
One day Sinuhe decides to return to Egypt. He sails to Thebes and opens a clinic for the poor in the same neighborhood he grew up in. He does not get rich in this, being driven by ideological motives instead. His slave Kaptah (now released by Sinuhe) instead becomes a businessman and buys a pub called &quot;Crocodile&#x27;s Tail&quot;. There Sinuhe meets a woman named Merit, who becomes Sinuhe&#x27;s life partner.

In Egypt, a new king, Akhenaten, has begun to convey a monotheistic teaching centered around the sun god Aten. According to Akhenaten&#x27;s doctrine, all people are equal, and in the new world order there no longer would be slaves and masters. Aspects of Akhenaten prove to be unpopular: his pacifism, among Horemheb and others concerned with the threat of Syrian and Hittite invasion; his attempts at redistributing property to the poor; and his worship of Aten at the exclusion of the old gods, among the clergy of the mighty state god Amon. Sinuhe is attracted to the teachings that the new king proclaims and, as he feels, focus on light, equality and justice, and joins Akhenaten&#x27;s court.
After a particularly violent public incident, Akhenaten, fed up with opposition, leaves Thebes with Sinuhe to middle Egypt where a new capital, Akhetaten, dedicated to Aten, is built. However, the conflicts between Amon and Aten continue, and it all develops into a civil war. Aten&#x27;s kingdom on Earth begins to fall, and the courtiers, one after another, abandon Akhenaten and Akhetaten in favor of Amon and Thebes. The final battle also takes place in Thebes. Sinuhe fights for the sake of Aten and Pharaoh to the end, but ultimately the side of the Amon priesthood is victorious. During the chaos, Merit and her son Thot are killed – the latter would turn out to be Sinuhe&#x27;s offspring. When defeat has become reality, Akhenaten dies after having drunk a cup of poison mixed by the embittered Sinuhe. Queen Nefertite&#x27;s father, Ay, takes the throne, after the boy king Tutankhamun&#x27;s short reign, despite Sinuhe having realised from Tiy that he himself is of royal blood and must be the son of Amenhotep III and his Mitannic consort, and thus closer to the throne.

With Akhenaten out of the way, Horemheb gathers all fit men and conducts a full-scale war against the Hittite kingdom – Egypt&#x27;s premier rival at this time. Both Sinuhe and Kaptah participate in this battle, as Sinuhe wanted to know what war is like. A peace treaty is ultimately established, and king Aziru and his royal family are captured and publicly executed. Sinuhe later succeeds with Horemheb&#x27;s and Ay&#x27;s mission to assassinate the Hittite prince Shubattu, secretly invited by Baketamon to marry her, preventing him from reaching Egypt and seizing the throne.

Sinuhe now goes back, afflicted by all the losses, to a simple dwelling in Thebes, bitter and disillusioned in the heart. Every now and then he is visited by his former servant Kaptah, who only becomes richer and richer, and is now Sinuhe&#x27;s patron. Sinuhe begins to criticise the new regime led by his old friend Horemheb, and as a punishment for this he is exiled to the Red Sea coast.

==Writing process==
===Research and background===

Although Waltari employed some poetic license in combining the biographies of Sinuhe and Akhenaten, he was otherwise much concerned about the historical accuracy of his detailed description of ancient Egyptian life and carried out considerable research into the subject. Waltari&#x27;s fascination of ancient Egypt was sparked as a 14-year-old by the 1922 discovery of Tutankhamun, which became widely publicised and a cultural phenomenon at the time. On his trips to foreign countries he would always first visit the local egyptological exhibitions and museums. Waltari didn&#x27;t make notes, instead preferring to internalise all this vast knowledge; this allowed him to interweave his accumulated information smoothly into the story. The result has been praised not only by readers but also by Egyptologists.
Waltari had long been interested in Akhenaten and wrote a play about him, &quot;Akhnaton, auringosta syntynyt&quot; (&quot;Akhnaton, Born of the Sun&quot;), which was published in 1936. In it, Waltari explored the disastrous consequences of Akhenaten&#x27;s well-intentioned implementation of unconditional idealism in a society, and referenced the tensions at the borders of the Egyptian empire which resemble those on the Soviet-Finnish frontier. Waltari would later revisit these themes, which only had a minor role in the play, in greater depth in &quot;The Egyptian&quot;. The character of Sinuhe makes no appearance in this play.

With the advent of World War II, Waltari&#x27;s idealism crumbled and was replaced with cynicism; this was in no small part due to him serving as a propagandist during the Winter War and Continuation War at the State Information Bureau, causing him to realise how much historical information is actually relative or made of half-truths. Waltari also witnessed Finland&#x27;s sudden, perfidious change of policy towards the USSR from &quot;enemy&quot; to &quot;friend&quot; upon the signing of the armistice on 4 September 1944, another ideal shattered. The war provided the final impulse for exploring the subjects of Akhenaten and Egypt in a novel which, although depicting events that took place over 3,300 years ago, in fact reflects the contemporary feelings of disillusionment and war-weariness and pessimistically illustrates how little the essence of humanity has changed since then. The political and battle depictions of ancient Egypt and surrounding nations contain many parallels with World War II. The threatening King Suppiluliuma has many of the overtones of Hitler. Waltari often said that the novel would have been a very different one had it not been for World War II.

===The writing===
In April 1945 Waltari travelled to his mother-in-law&#x27;s cottage in Hartola, where he began writing in the attic. The experiences of war and 20 years of research had pushed him into a state where the novel burst out of him: The novel was written within a three and a half-month period of great inspiration, with Waltari producing as many as between 15 and 27 sheets per day. So intense was his state of inspiration and immersion that, in a fictionalised account called &quot;A Nail Merchant at Nightfall&quot; he would write later, he claimed to have been visited by visions of Egyptians and to have simply transcribed the story as dictated by Sinuhe himself. He repeated the same story four decades later in &quot;Kirjailijan muistelmia&quot;. This has caused some to speculate that Waltari in fact had been an Egyptian in a prior life or was a reincarnation of Sinuhe. Waltari followed a consistent schedule, writing from 9 AM to 4 or 5 PM, meal breaks at predetermined times, family members leaving him to his work. A state of happiness and being in love during creative work was essential to Waltari, and on evenings he wrote long love letters to one Helena Kangas (later known as Leena Ilmari) throughout the summer. Waltari&#x27;s extramarital relationships were no danger to his marriage, as he and his wife Marjatta had developed a mutual understanding regarding these matters and Waltari would always remain loyal to her in the end. His mother died during this; his wife managed the funeral arrangements, Waltari attended the funeral, and on the next morning he resumed writing the novel where he left off.

The completed manuscript, totaling almost one thousand pages, was delivered by Waltari to WSOY in the first half of August 1945. Editor Jalmari Jäntti had typically cut risqué material from Waltari&#x27;s prior works. This time, however, little to no corrections or deletions were required by the editor – it went on to be printed as it was on the same month.

==Themes==
===Unchanging humanity===

Central to the novel&#x27;s themes is the conviction of the unchanging nature of mankind, exemplified by the recurring phrase &quot;so there has ever been and ever will be&quot;. Its view on humanity is reputedly grim, displaying human failings such as selfishness, greed and prejudice as widespread. Waltari has gone on to state: &quot;Although the basic characteristics of a human being can not change in the foreseeable time-frame due to the fact that they have 10000, 100000, 200000 years old inherited instincts as their basis, people&#x27;s relationships can be altered and must be altered, so that the world can be saved from destruction.&quot;

Commenting on the prevalence of this interpretation, Finnish literary scholar views that the novel&#x27;s main thesis is not simply that people can not change, but rather that it contains a contradiction that nothing can change &quot;and&quot; everything can change; on some levels things remain the same, but on other levels the hope of future change survives in the novel.

Envall brings up the &quot;familiarity&quot; of the depiction of 14th-century BC Egypt as highly developed: the novel describes phenomena – inventions, knowings, institutions etc. – that, although resembling familiar modern day equivalents that are rather new in Finland, are nonetheless egyptologically accurate. The similarity between ancient and modern times supports the themes of changelessness, and is in an &quot;effective&quot; tension with the archaic-style language. &quot;The narration estranges the phenomena by portraying them as simultaneously archaic and timeless, alien and familiar,&quot; he writes. As examples of these cultural parallels, Envall lists: the pseudo-intellectuals exalt themselves by flaunting their usage of foreign loanwords; the language of Babylon is the common language of the learned throughout various countries (like Greek in the Hellenistic period, Latin in the medieval period, French among diplomats and English in the 20th and 21st centuries); education takes place in faculties that provide degrees for qualification in posts (European universities began in the Middle Ages); people have addresses and send mail as papyrus and clay tablets; censorship is circumvented by cloaking subjects with historical stand-ins. There are precursors to aspects of modern medicine and monetary economy as well.

Similar themes are expressed via repetition throughout the novel, such as: everything is futile, the tomorrow is unknowable, no one can know &quot;why&quot; something has always been so, all people are fundamentally the same everywhere, the world year is changing, and death is better than life.

===Clash of ideologies===
Markku Envall describes the work as a criticism of utopism, the advocation of an ideology or idealism while ignorant of the world where it is supposed to be realized. Idealistic and materialistic worldviews are at clash in the novel, the former represented by the pacifist pharaoh Akhenaten and latter by the cold-bloodedly realist warlord Horemheb – idealism and realism are similarly represented also by Sinuhe and Kaptah, respectively. This tension is played out in a world concerned chiefly with worldly matters and rampant with prejudiced attitudes and lust for material possessions, wealth and power. Akhenaten is an illustration of the destructiveness of well-intentioned blindness; he is a tragic character and this blindness is his tragic flaw, by which he causes the destruction of his own kingdom – much like King Lear. The protagonist Sinuhe is an open-minded, learning and developing character, the sole such one in the novel according to Envall. Through him, the worldviews represented by other characters are experienced and evaluated, and during his character arc he is able to internalise much of these aspects, combining idealism and realism. Although Horemheb is able to reinstate peace and order, rebuilding that which Akhenaten destroys, his ingenious realpolitik is rejected by Sinuhe, because it also abolishes freedom. Whether suffering is increased or decreased during Horemheb&#x27;s reign is left ambiguous, however. Envall constructs the following graph:

He argues that &quot;whole&quot; individuals are achieved by combining these &quot;partial&quot; ones: a good ruler by combining Akhenaten and Horemheb, and an individual capable of surviving through everyday life by combining Sinuhe and Kaptah. Sinuhe is dependent on Kaptah&#x27;s street-smartness and life experience, and they are inseparable to such an extent that in Kaptah&#x27;s absence Sinuhe is forced to imagine his voice.

===Allegory of Christianity===

The portrayal of Atenism, as a doctrine advocating peace and equality, has attracted readings as an allegory of the attempted rise of an early form of Christianity. Markku Envall finds many resemblances between phrases uttered by Jesus and the apostles in the New Testament, and those by characters in &quot;The Egyptian&quot; (especially in context of Atenism). He argues that by this Waltari anachronistically utilizes literature from after the story&#x27;s setting, and that it demonstrates the parallelism of the two religions: both religions are prophetic (a single informant), noninstitutional (to experience God, the believer does not necessarily require an intermediary infrastructure), egalitarian (before God, secularly unequal people are equal) and universal (meant for all humanity). As reasons for these similarities, Envall explains that firstly, the religions of Egypt were a major influence on Judaism and hence Christianity, and secondly, that the religions share common archetypical material. Sigmund Freud has likewise called out in his work &quot;Moses and Monotheism&quot; that there are numerous similarities between the worship of Akhenaten&#x27;s Aten, and the books of the bible.

===Relationship to Ecclesiastes===
Ecclesiastes was an influence, both stylistically and thematically. A device Waltari uses to emphasise a theme is the &quot;chorus&quot; – the reiteration of an idea. On the first page Sinuhe states: &quot;Everything returns to what it was, and there is nothing new under the Sun, and man never changes&quot;. Shortly afterwards, the opposite of this idea is denied: &quot;There are also those, who say that which has happened has never before happened, but this is useless talk.&quot; This thesis is repeated by multiple other characters as well. The main thesis is borrowed from Ecclesiastes:

Like &quot;The Egyptian&quot;, Ecclesiastes strengthens the idea by denying its opposite:

Other shared themes are the futility of everything, and the suffering brought by knowledge. Conversely however, Sinuhe&#x27;s preference of death over life is the antithesis of Ecclesiastes&#x27; love of life over death.

===World War II allegory===

The geopolitical situation of the Middle East, as depicted by the novel, is thought to represent the second world war. Waltari reluctantly approved this interpretation. These analogies are not exact but suggestive in nature; they are split up and mixed up, hidden among a vast amount of reliable historical knowledge. The relations between nations of the two time periods look as follows:

*Land of the Hittites / Germany
*Babylon / Soviet Union
*Mitanni / Poland
*Crete / France
*Egypt / England

The similarities between the warlike Hittites and Nazi Germany include their &quot;Lebensraum&quot; project, fast sudden warfare or &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;, use of propaganda to weaken the enemy, and worship of health and power while disdaining the sickly and weak. Mitanni is a border and buffer nation between the land of the Hittites and Babylon, like Poland between Germany and the USSR. Akhenaten&#x27;s and Horemheb&#x27;s battle for power mirrors the opposition of Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill; the former seeks peace by conceding lands to the invader but helps the enemy, whereas the latter knows that war is the only way to save the home country.

==Historical accuracy==
The novel&#x27;s reputation of historical flawlessness has been often repeated, by the egyptological congress of Cairo, French egyptologist Pierre Chaumelle, and U. Hofstetter of &quot;The Oakland Post&quot;. In 2008 Dr Richard Parkinson, the director and the curator of the Egyptian department of the British Museum, called it a &quot;serious intellectual achievement&quot; and that it &quot;depicts a culture of real human beings in a way achieved by few other novels&quot;. Waltari has been mistaken for an egyptologist. He never visited Egypt, because he feared it would ruin his mental image of Egypt and modern Egypt was completely different from the ancient one. He has said: &quot;I have lived in Egypt although I have never visited the place.&quot;

Nonetheless, Markku Envall cautions that the novel cannot be taken as absolutely free of errors on a literal level. A Swiss scholar complained that a sand flea species mentioned did not exist in Africa until it migrated via slave ships. Rostislav Holthoer has doubted the historicity of the depiction of trepanation prominent in the novel, and the act of abandoning newborns in reed boats. He has not been able to confirm nor deny some specific manners or traditions, such as breaking vases to conduct marriage, but the majority of religious ones are real. Even the day of the false king has its basis on reality, with ancient Babylonians killing a surrogate king to save their real king should he have been prophesied to die. On the other hand, he has given Waltari credit for his predictions, as later discoveries have confirmed dubious details of the novel. Waltari&#x27;s unflattering characterisation of Akhenaten, Horemheb, Tiy and Ay as flawed persons proved to be closer to reality than their earlier glorification. Research at Long Island University has supported Tutankhamun having been murdered, as hinted in the novel. Some have doubted the possibility of an ancient Egyptian person writing a text for oneself only, but in 1978 such a papyrus became public; its author, a victim of wrongdoing, tells his life story in it with no recipient. According to Jussi Aro, the real Hittites were seemingly less cruel and stern than other peoples of the Middle East and the day of the false king was misdated among other errors, although Panu Rajala dismisses his claims as alternative readings of evidence rather than outright contradictions. Markku Envall argues that the accuracy or lack thereof is irrelevant to a fictional work&#x27;s literary merit, citing the errors of Shakespeare.

==Reception==
The messages of the novel evoked a wide response in readers in the aftermath of the World War, and the book became an international bestseller. &quot;The Egyptian&quot; has been translated into 41 languages; it&#x27;s the most internationally famous and translated Finnish novel, yet in 2009 &quot;100 Must-read Historical Novels&quot; estimated that &quot;its fame has faded in recent decades&quot;.

===First publication===
&quot;The Egyptian&quot; was first published in late November 1945. Initially knowledge of the novel spread through word of mouth in Finland; WSOY hadn&#x27;t advertised it due to concerns over erotic content. It gained some early notoriety through an incident by historical novelist Maila Talvio: after hearing lewd sections read out beforehand in an autumn 1945 literature event, she took offense, marched into WSOY&#x27;s office and demanded that the novel&#x27;s printing be stopped, even in vain offering to buy the whole edition when told the printing machines were already in full action. The first two editions were sold out by the end of the year, and it became one of the most discussed topics in societal and literary circles.

The few reviews before the end of the year were positive: Huugo Jalkanen of &quot;Uusi Suomi&quot; and Lauri Viljanen of &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; said that the novel was no mere colourful retelling of history, but was relevant to the current attitude shaped by the events of recent years. More reviews followed in January, and a common element among the more negative or lukewarm reviews was the scolding of Waltari&#x27;s previous work, but many saw it as a turning point for his career. The sexual depictions drew ire. Eino Sormunen of &quot;Savon Sanomat&quot; recommended discretion due to plenitudes of horrifying decadence at display, and Vaasan Jaakkoo of &quot;Ilkka&quot; warned about it as unsuitable for children. Yrjö Tönkyrä of &quot;Kaiku&quot; wrote: &quot;Not wanting to appear in any way as a moralist, I nonetheless cannot ignore the erotic gluttony that dominates the work, as if conceived by a sick imagination – the whole world revolves for the sole purpose that people can enjoy...&quot;

French egyptologist Pierre Chaumelle read &quot;The Egyptian&quot; in Finnish and, in a letter featured in a &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; article in 13. 8. 1946, wrote of his impressions:

Critics had been concerned that Waltari might have played fast and loose with historical events, but this article dispelled these doubts and begot a reputation of almost mythical accuracy around the novel. This lack of errors was also confirmed by the egyptological congress of Cairo, and egyptologist Rostislav Holthoer also has since then noted that later research has confirmed some of Waltari&#x27;s speculations.

===First translations===
The Swedish translation by Ole Torvalds was published in late 1946, abridged with Waltari&#x27;s approval. Torvalds was careful not to omit anything essential while streamlining the pacing. Waltari praised the result. In 1948 a complete French version by Jean-Louis Perret came out, as well as the Danish and Norwegian versions. The novel sold one million copies in Europe within the first five years after its publication.

&quot;The Egyptian&quot; saw an English release in August 1949. Putnam had asked a Swedish woman of culture (coincidentally the wife of an editor who&#x27;d previously rejected the novel) for input, and she had urged them to publish it. It was translated by Naomi Walford, not directly from Finnish but rather Swedish, and abridged even further at the behest of the aforementioned Swede, the same also hired to abridge it. About a third of the text was lost: aside from the excision of repetitions, the philosophical content suffered and key facts were omitted.

Edmund Fuller of &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; described the narrative as &quot;colorful, provocative, completely absorbing&quot;; he compared it to Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;Joseph and His Brothers&quot;, writing: &quot;Again, Mann&#x27;s great work is a study of ideas and of personality. The Egypt emergent from his formidable style is shown within a limited social range and is detailed only in isolated scenes. If there are deeps of the personality that Mann plumbs further, Waltari makes an exciting, vivid, and minute re-creation of the society of Thebes and of Egypt and the related world in general, ranging from Pharaoh and his neighbor kings to the outcast corpse-washers in the House of the Dead. We see, feel, smell, and taste Waltari&#x27;s Egypt. He writes in a pungent, easy style and it is obvious that he has been wonderfully served by his translator, Naomi Walford.&quot; Gladys Schmitt, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, commented on the unresolved philosophical dilemma posed between Ekhnaton&#x27;s generosity for bettering the world and Horemheb&#x27;s pragmatic belligerence for stability, and praised the vibrancy and historical research evident in the characterisation of countries and social classes; however, she criticised social struggles surrounding Akhenaton as obscured, and found events oversensational and the characters composed of predictable types. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; wrote: &quot;He [Sinuhe] observes- and remembers- and in his old age writes it down, – the world as he knew it. It&#x27;s a rich book, a bawdy book, a book that carries one to distant shores and makes one feel an onlooker as was Sinuhe. The plot is tenuous, a slender thread never wholly resolved. But the book opens one&#x27;s eyes to an ancient world, nearer to ours than we think.&quot;
Soon after its release in the USA, it was selected book of the month in September 1949, and then entered the bestseller lists in October 1949, where it remained the unparalleled two years – 550 000 copies were sold in that time. Marion Saunders, the agent who had arranged its US publication, remarked that she had never seen anything like it during her 15-year career. It remained the most sold foreign novel in the US before its place was taken over by &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;, by Umberto Eco. Overall the reception was highly positive and some predicted Waltari as being a Nobel prize candidate. A film version with a budget of 5 million dollars and an extensive marketing campaign started production in 1952 and was released in 1954. However, there were issues with actors and inexperience with the then new Cinemascope technology, and the film received mixed reviews and modest financial success.

===Losing the &quot;popular fiction&quot; stigma===
In Finnish academic literary circles, critics had generally regarded Waltari as an author of popular fiction. This stigma he had gained for perceived overproductivity, superficiality and looseness of style; for his popular erotic flavouring in clearly told stories; and not conforming to the &quot;Great Tradition&quot; of Finnish literature (patriotic, realistic depiction of the struggles of poor yet courageous Finns with nature and society) favoured by critics at the time. Despite its popularity and acclaim, the novel was denied the 1946 state literature award, largely due to the efforts of vocal Waltari critic and ideological opponent Raoul Palmgren. Even the overseas success was denounced in Finland as a popular novel&#x27;s success. has described the literary discourse of the time as having been dominated by indifference and jealousy towards Waltari. Waltari finally gained appreciation in Finland in the 1980s, after his historical novels had made appearances in French bestseller lists one after another.
&quot;The Egyptian&quot; has since secured the place as a classic and masterpiece of Finnish literature. It came at first place in a 1988 Finnish reader poll, second place (after &quot;Alastalon salissa&quot; by Volter Kilpi) in a 1992 poll by Finnish representatives of art, science and culture, it was voted by Finns as the most beloved Finnish book in a 2008 poll and in a 2017 poll it was selected as the Finnish book of the century. When Finnish writer and scholar was in 2017 asked by &quot;Ilta-Sanomat&quot; to select the 10 best books from Finland&#x27;s period of independence, &quot;The Egyptian&quot; was one of them and he commented:

As a result of its use in the novel, the name Minea remains in occasional use in Finland. Likewise, named in Finland after the novel&#x27;s protagonist are Sinuhe Wallinheimo and a café chain.

===International reputation===
By the 1990s, Waltari was regarded in foreign countries not as a specifically Finnish author but as a master of historical fiction in world literature. He had been invited multiple times to lecture in U.S. universities and literary clubs, but turned down these for his inadequate English and as he felt &quot;the author shouldn&#x27;t cause to his readers the disappointment caused by meeting him in person&quot;. He also politely turned down Egyptian President Nasser&#x27;s invitation to visit Egypt, because it no longer had anything in common with the ancient one and he was already done with the subject.
An unlicensed Arabic translation appeared in Egypt in 1955, translated from the incomplete English version by engineer Hamed al-Qasb. Taha Hussein, an influential figure in Arabic literature, had read the French translation of &quot;The Egyptian&quot; and was very much taken in despite his reputation of criticalness. In the preamble of the Arabic translation of &quot;The Egyptian&quot; he relates that he had read numerous books about ancient Egypt but none had come close to Waltari&#x27;s novel. He lamented the fact that it was translated from English instead of directly from Finnish, and exclaimed: &quot;Because we have no mastery of even the dominant languages of the world, how could we translate from the minority languages either!&quot; Faruk Abu-Chacra from the University of Helsinki has since then begun a project to produce a complete Arabic version, although he clarifies he is not the translator; as of 2003, he compares the 1955 edition with the original Finnish and other European versions, Pekka Lehtinen is the official translator, and they have to translate the missing portions by themselves. Abu-Chacra describes &quot;The Egyptian&quot; as a very well-known and respected novel in Egypt, but that nowadays it has become a rarity, disappearing from libraries in Arab countries. It took him 30 years to find some Arabic copies, from Beirut.

Among Czechs, &quot;The Egyptian&quot; and Waltari&#x27;s oeuvre enjoy immense, &quot;cult-like&quot; popularity. &quot;The Egyptian&quot; depicted cynical power politics and a world of violence similar to which the Eastern Bloc lived under; it came out in Czechoslovakia in 1965, at a time when the country&#x27;s isolation from the rest of the world was starting to ease. Translator , wanting to convey the novel&#x27;s message to the Czech people as purely as possible, had learned Finnish in four months to translate directly from the original. It took her 9 years of work, some of it while under imprisonment for Western thinking, until she was done. A reader wrote in &quot;Lidové noviny&quot;: &quot;I can say that it [&quot;The Egyptian&quot;] helped me survive through the darkness of the communist era sane! I am immensely grateful to Mr. Waltari.&quot; When &#x27;s Waltari biography was released in 2007, a review in &quot;Hospodářské noviny&quot; likened it to the Czechs&#x27; own 200-page version of a monument to Waltari.

<doc id="259345" wikidata="Q2844818" url="?curid=259345" title="Amerasian">
<text>An Amerasian may refer to a person born in East or Southeast Asia to an East Asian or Southeast Asian mother and a U.S. military father. Other terms used include War babies or G.I. babies. 

Several countries in East and Southeast Asia have significant populations of Amerasians, reflecting a history of US military presence within those two respective regions. These include Okinawa (Japan), South Korea, Cambodia, China, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan and the Philippines. The latter once had the largest US air and naval bases outside the US mainland.

==Definitions==


The term was coined by novelist Pearl S. Buck and was formalized by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Many people were born to East or Southeast Asian women and U.S. servicemen during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The official definition of Amerasian came about as a result of Public Law 97-359, enacted by the 97th Congress of the United States on October 22, 1982.

According to the United States Department of Justice and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), an Amerasian is: &quot;[A]n alien who was born in Korea, Kampuchea, Laos, Thailand or Vietnam after December 31, 1950 and before October 22, 1982 and was fathered by a U.S. citizen.&quot; The Amerasian Foundation (AF) and Amerasian Family Finder (AFF) define an Amerasian as &quot;Any person who was fathered by a citizen of the United States (an American serviceman, American expatriate or U.S. Government Employee (Regular or Contract)) and whose mother is or was, an Asian National.&quot;

The term is commonly applied to half Japanese children fathered by a U.S. serviceman based in Japan, as well as half Korean children fathered by veterans of the Korean War or stationary soldiers in South Korea. The term is also applied to children of Filipinos and American rulers during the U.S. colonial period of the Philippines (still used until today) and children of Thais and U.S. soldiers during World War II and the Vietnam War. The U.S. had bases in Thailand during the Vietnam War.

Amerasian should not be interpreted as a fixed racial term relating to a specific category of multiracial groups (such as Mestizo, Mulatto, Eurasian or Afro-Asians). The racial strain of the American parent of one Amerasian may be different from that of another Amerasian; it may be White, Black, Hispanic or even Asians in general. In the latter case, it is conceivable that the Amerasian could be fathered by a person who shares the same racial stock, but not necessarily the same nationality.

In certain cases, the term could also apply to the progency of American females, who engaged in professions such as military nursing for East and Southeast Asian males. Mixed-race children, whatever the occupational background or prestige of their parents, have suffered social stigma. With genetic relation to U.S. soldiers, Amerasians have faced additional exclusion by perceived association to being military enemies of East and Southeast Asian countries. This stigma extended to the mothers of Amerasians, majority of whom were Asian, causing many of the Asian mothers to abandon their Amerasian children. The abandonment of both parents led to a large proportion of orphaned Amerasians.

==Cambodia==
The Amerasian Immigration Act included Amerasians whose fathers were U.S. citizens and whose mothers were nationals of Kampuchea (Cambodia). As many as 10,000 Cambodians of mixed Amerasian ancestry may have been fathered by US servicemen.

==Japan==


According to one estimate, around 5,000 to 10,000 Amerasian babies had been born in Japan from 1945 to 1952. Data from the Japanese Welfare Ministry from July 1952, on the other hand, revealed that only 5,013 Japanese Amerasian children were born in all of Japan. Masami Takada from the Welfare Ministry put an exaggerated estimate of 150,000 – 200,000. Another investigation by the Welfare Ministry was conducted again in August 1953, this time them revising the number to reveal that only 3,490 half-castes of American fathers and Japanese mothers had been born during the 7 years of American occupation of Japan, which lasted from 1945 – 1952. Some of the children were abandoned and raised in orphanages such as the Elizabeth Saunders Home in Oiso, Japan.

The actual number of Japanese Amerasians is unknown. Officially, the number of 10,000 Amerasians in Japan would be an upper limit. Some contemporary writers had however reported rumors of 200,000 while actual numbers had been found to be 5,000, possibly 10,000, no more than 20,000 allowing for underestimates. Of those fathered by American soldiers. Their presumed &quot;colors&quot; were 86.1% &quot;white,&quot; 11.5% &quot;black&quot; and 2.5% &quot;unknown.&quot;

===Hāfu===

Today, many Japanese Amerasians go by the term Hāfu, which is used to refer to a person who is half Japanese and half non-Japanese ancestry.

===Amerasian School of Okinawa===
In Okinawa, The Amerasian School of Okinawa was formed to educate children of two different cultures. The school population includes Japanese Amerasians.

==Laos==
The Amerasian Immigration Act included Amerasians whose fathers were U.S. citizens and whose mothers were nationals of Laos. The number of Laotian Amerasians is currently unknown.

==Philippines==
===The Forgotten Amerasians===
Since 1898, when the United States annexed the Philippines from Spain, there were as many as 21 U.S. bases and 100,000 U.S. military personnel stationed there. The bases closed in 1992 leaving behind thousands of Amerasian children. There are an estimated 52,000 Amerasians in the Philippines. According to an academic research paper presented in the U.S. (in 2012) by a Philippines Amerasian college research study unit, the number could be a lot more, possibly reaching 250,000, this is due the fact almost all generations of Amerasians intermarried with other Amerasians and Filipino natives. The newer Amerasians from the United States would add to the already older settlement of peoples from other countries in the Americas that happened when the Philippines was under Spanish rule. The Philippines once received immigrants from Spanish-occupied Panama, Peru, and Mexico.

Unlike their counterparts in other countries, American-Asians or Amerasians in the Philippines remain impoverished and neglected. A study by the University of the Philippines&#x27; Center for Women Studies found that many Amerasians have experienced some form of abuse and/or domestic violence. The findings cited cases of racial, gender and class discrimination that Amerasian children and youth suffer from strangers, peers, classmates and teachers. The study also said black Amerasians seem to suffer more from racial and class discrimination than their white-descended counterparts.

Two-thirds of Amerasian children are raised by single mothers, others by relatives and non-relatives. Six percent live on their own or in institutions, and 90 percent were born out of wedlock. It was reported in 1993 that prostitutes are increasingly Amerasian (especially black amerasian females), and frequently children of prostitutes who are caught in a cycle that transcends generations.

===Legal action===
In 1982, the U.S. passed the Amerasian Immigration Act, giving preferential immigration status to Amerasian children born during the Vietnam Conflict. The act did not apply to Amerasians born in the Philippines. They can become United States citizens only if claimed by their fathers; most fathers fail to do so. To become citizens of the United States, Filipino Amerasians must be able to show proof of parentage by a U.S. citizen before they turn eighteen years old; most are unable to do so before that cut off age.

A class-action suit was filed in 1993 on their behalf in the International Court of Complaints in Washington, DC, to establish Filipino American children&#x27;s rights to assistance. The court denied the claim, ruling that the children were born to unmarried women who provided sexual services to U.S. service personnel in the Philippines and who were therefore engaged in illicit acts of prostitution. Such illegal activity could not be the basis for any legal claim.

In 2012, the number of Amerasians descended from American servicemen in the Philippines or “G.I. babies” was estimated to be around 250,000.

==South Korea==


Since the Korean War, there has been a significant population of Amerasians in South Korea. Many Amerasians were born into &quot;Camptowns&quot; which were established by the South Korean government. The women in these Camptowns were affected by the post-war poverty and turned to prostitution with American soldiers. This perpetuated the stereotype that children born in Camptowns were mothered by prostitutes. The South Korean government never viewed Korean Amerasians as Korean citizens but encouraged the foreign adoption of mixed South Korean babies. In 1953&#x27; the United States Congress passed the Refugee Relief Act, which allowed 4000 Amerasians to emigrate to the US for adoption. This group became commonly known as Korean Adoptees. They were part of the International adoption of South Korean children that made up roughly 160,000 adoptees.

===Amerasian Christian Academy===
The Amerasian Christian Academy still educates Amerasian children today in Gyeonggi-Do, South Korea.

==Taiwan==
US soldiers fathered children in Taiwan at the end of World War II. Today there are an estimated 1,000 Taiwanese Amerasians. Over 200,000 American soldiers in Korea and Vietnam visited Taiwan for rest and relaxation between 1950 and 1975.

==Thailand==
In Thailand, Amerasian children are dubbed as Luk khrueng or half children in the Thai language. These Amerasians were fathered by US soldiers who took part in the Vietnam War. At the height of the Vietnam War, 50,000 GIs were based in Thailand. The Pearl S. Buck Foundation estimated around 5,000-8,000 Thai Amerasians. Some migrated to the United States under the 1982 Amerasian Immigration Act. An unknown number were left behind. &quot;I had trouble at school. I was teased and bullied a lot because of my skin color,&quot; says entertainer Morris Kple Roberts, who had an African American father and a Thai mother.

===Searches===
US veteran, Gene Ponce, helps American fathers find their Thai Amerasian children. He has recently used popular DNA services, such as Ancestry.com to help match Amerasians with their relatives in the US.

==Vietnam==
The exact number of Amerasians in Vietnam is not known. The U.S. soldiers stationed in Vietnam had relationships with local females, many of the women had origins in nightclubs, brothels and pubs. The American Embassy once reported there were fewer than 1,000 Amerasians. A report by the South Vietnamese Senate Subcommittee suggested there are 15,000 to 20,000 children of mixed European American and Vietnamese ancestry, but this figure was considered low. Congress estimated 20,000 to 30,000 Amerasians by 1975 lived in Vietnam. According to &quot;Amerasians Without Borders&quot;, they estimated about 25,000 to 30,000 Vietnamese Amerasians were born from American first participation in Vietnam in 1962 and lasted until 1975. Although during the Operation Babylift it was estimated at 23,000. In April 1975, Operation Babylift was initiated in South Vietnam to relocate Vietnamese children, many orphans and those of mixed American-Vietnamese parentage (mostly Vietnamese mothers and American serviceman fathers), to the United States and find American families who would take them in. The crash of the first flight of Operation Babylift led to the death of 138 people, 78 of which were children. During the operation, they estimated over 3,000 Amerasians were evacuated from South Vietnam; however, more than 20,000 Amerasians remained.

In July 1979, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) created the Orderly Departure Program in order to mitigate safer travel conditions for Vietnamese refugees to various nations after the Vietnam War. However, since its inception to mid 1982, only 23 Amerasians successfully emigrated under the Orderly Departure Program. By October 1982, there was more hope for Amerasian emigration as the largest group of 11 Amerasian children, aged seven to fifteen, departed from Vietnam to immigrate to the U.S.

In 1982, the U.S. Congress passed the Amerasian Immigration Act in an attempt to grant Amerasian immigration to the U.S. However, the Amerasian Immigration Act provided great emigration difficulty for many Vietnamese Amerasians, due to a lack of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the Vietnamese government. This was due to a clause in the Amerasian Immigration Act that required documentation of the fathers in the U.S. in order for the Vietnamese Amerasians to acquire a visa. However, around 500 Amerasians were still able to safely immigrate to the U.S. between 1982 and 1983 due to Hanoi&#x27;s cooperating with the U.S. In 1988, U.S. Congress passed the American Homecoming Act, aiming to grant citizenship to Vietnamese Amerasians born between 1962 and 1975. By 1994, more than 75,000 Amerasians and their family from Vietnam immigrated to the U.S. The American Homecoming act eventually led to 23,000 Amerasians and 67,000 of their relatives immigrating to the U.S. For the Vietnamese Amerasians, this meant that their migration to the U.S. occurred as teenagers, leading to struggles in the resettlement process. A study in 1994 found that 22 percent of Amerasian men and 18 percent of Amerasian women residing in the U.S. reported physical or sexual abuse. By 2018, at least 400 Amerasians still currently reside Vietnam through DNA testing of 500 people by the nonprofit organization Amerasians Without Borders.

===Vietnamese Amerasian Search Organizations===
Up to the 2000s, many Vietnamese Amerasians were still not reunited with their fathers. Some Amerasians still resided in Vietnam unable to obtain the necessary documents to emigrate to the US. Organizations such as the Amerasian Child Find Network, run by Clint Haines and AAHope Foundation, run by Jonathan Tinquist, helped American fathers reunite with their Amerasian children. Both are Vietnam Vets.

Other organizations that helped with Amerasian, Adoptee and family searches included the Adopted Vietnamese International (AVI) (Indigo Willing) and Operation Reunite (Trista Goldberg). The only current active US organization seeking to reunite Amerasians is Amerasian Without Borders (AWB) run by Jimmy Miller, a Vietnamese Amerasian based in the US.

<doc id="259347" wikidata="Q722842" url="?curid=259347" title="Christian Kane">
<text>Christian Kane is an American actor and singer-songwriter. His television roles include Lindsey McDonald in &quot;Angel&quot;, Eliot Spencer in &quot;Leverage&quot; and its spin-off &quot;&quot;, Jacob Stone in &quot;The Librarians&quot;, and Abe &quot;High Wolf&quot; Wheeler in &quot;Into the West&quot;. His cinematic filmography includes &quot;Just Married&quot;, &quot;Taxi&quot;, and &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot;.

Kane is the lead singer of the country-southern rock band Kane. On December 7, 2010, they released &quot;The House Rules&quot;, their third album and their debut for record label Bigger Picture Music Group. The album reached no. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Albums chart. The first single from the album, also titled &quot;The House Rules&quot;, debuted at no. 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Songs chart. The second single, “Let Me Go”, was released on July 11, 2011.

==Early life==
Kane has stated that he is of Cherokee (Native American) ancestry. His parents participated in, and met at, the rodeo. The family moved around the South because his father was in the oil business, and they finally settled in Norman, Oklahoma, when Kane was in eighth grade. While growing up in Texas and Oklahoma, Kane was a collegiate-style wrestler and played football (as a strong safety). He studied art history at the University of Oklahoma, but decided he wanted to be an actor and headed to Los Angeles before finishing the degree. In Los Angeles, he worked at a talent management company, where he delivered scripts in exchange for getting acting jobs.

==Career==
===Acting===

Kane landed his first acting role in 1997 as one of the leads in MGM&#x27;s television series &quot;Fame L.A.&quot; playing a country singer who moved to Los Angeles from Kansas. His television roles have included a recurring role in Joss Whedon’s &quot;Angel&quot; as the lawyer Lindsey MacDonald, the Jerry Bruckheimer-produced series &quot;Close to Home&quot; on CBS, the TNT television film &quot;Crossfire Trail&quot; in which he appeared alongside Tom Selleck, and the role of Abe Wheeler in the Steven Spielberg-produced 2005 miniseries &quot;Into the West&quot;. He starred as Billy Ryan in the MTV movie &quot;Love Song&quot; in 2000, alongside R&amp;B artist Monica.

Kane’s appearances on the big screen include the 20th Century Fox film &quot;Just Married&quot; and New Line Cinema&#x27;s &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot; (as the younger version of Robert Duvall&#x27;s Hub McCann, he has a scar on his upper lip from an injury he received while filming the movie). He also appeared in &quot;Taxi&quot;, &quot;Life or Something Like It&quot;, the Peter Berg-directed &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;, and the Warner Bros. baseball film &quot;Summer Catch&quot;.

In 2007, Kane was featured in the Carrie Underwood music video &quot;So Small&quot;, playing the role of one of the three converging stories.

<doc id="259349" wikidata="Q509860" url="?curid=259349" title="Stokely Carmichael">
<text>Kwame Ture (; born Stokely Standiford Churchill Carmichael; June 29, 1941November 15, 1998) was an American activist who played a major role in the civil rights movement in the United States and the global pan-African movement. Born in Trinidad in the Caribbean, he grew up in the United States from the age of 11 and became an activist while attending the Bronx High School of Science. He was a key leader in the development of the Black Power movement, first while leading the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), then as the &quot;Honorary Prime Minister&quot; of the Black Panther Party, and last as a leader of the All-African People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (A-APRP).

Carmichael was one of the original SNCC freedom riders of 1961 under Diane Nash&#x27;s leadership. He became a major voting rights activist in Mississippi and Alabama after being mentored by Ella Baker and Bob Moses. Like most young people in the SNCC, he became disillusioned with the two-party system after the 1964 Democratic National Convention failed to recognize the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party as official delegates from the state. Carmichael eventually decided to develop independent all-black political organizations, such as the Lowndes County Freedom Organization and, for a time, the national Black Panther Party. Inspired by Malcolm X&#x27;s example, he articulated a philosophy of black power, and popularized it both by provocative speeches and more sober writings.

Carmichael became one of the most popular and controversial Black leaders of the late 1960s. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover secretly identified Carmichael as the man most likely to succeed Malcolm X as America&#x27;s &quot;black messiah&quot;. The FBI targeted him for counterintelligence activity through its COINTELPRO program, causing Carmichael to move to Africa in 1968. He reestablished himself in Ghana, and then Guinea by 1969. There, he adopted the name Kwame Ture, and began campaigning internationally for revolutionary socialist pan-Africanism. Ture died of prostate cancer in 1998 at the age of 57.

==Early years==
Carmichael was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. He attended Tranquility School before moving to Harlem, New York City, in 1952 at the age of 11, to rejoin his parents. They had migrated to the United States when he was two, and he was raised by his grandmother and two aunts. He had three sisters.

His mother, Mabel R. Carmichael, was a stewardess for a steamship line. His father, Adolphus, was a carpenter who also worked as a taxi driver. The reunited Carmichaels eventually left Harlem to live in Van Nest in the East Bronx, at that time an aging neighborhood primarily of Jewish and Italian immigrants and descendants. According to a 1967 interview Carmichael gave to &quot;Life Magazine&quot;, he was the only black member of the Morris Park Dukes, a youth gang involved in alcohol and petty theft.

Carmichael attended the Bronx High School of Science in New York from 1956, being selected through high achievement on its standardized entrance examination. He was acquainted with fellow Bronx Science student Samuel R. Delany during his time there.

After graduation in 1960, Carmichael enrolled at Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C. His professors included the poet Sterling Brown, Nathan Hare, and Toni Morrison, who was later awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. Carmichael and fellow civil rights activist Tom Kahn helped to fund a five-day run of the &quot;Three Penny Opera,&quot; by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill:

Tom Kahn—very shrewdly—had captured the position of Treasurer of the Liberal Arts Student Council and the infinitely charismatic and popular Carmichael as floor whip was good at lining up the votes. Before they knew what hit them the Student Council had become a patron of the arts, having voted to buy out the remaining performances. It was a classic win/win. Members of the Council got patronage packets of tickets for distribution to friends and constituents.

Carmichael&#x27;s Washington, D.C., apartment on Euclid Street was a gathering place for his activist classmates. He graduated in 1964 with a degree in philosophy. Carmichael was offered a full graduate scholarship to Harvard University but turned it down.

At Howard, Carmichael joined the Nonviolent Action Group (NAG), the Howard campus affiliate of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Kahn introduced Carmichael and the other SNCC activists to Bayard Rustin, an African-American leader who became an influential adviser to SNCC. Inspired by the sit-in movement in the southern United States during college, Carmichael became more active in the Civil Rights Movement.

==1961: Freedom Rides==
In his first year at Howard, in 1961, Carmichael participated in the Freedom Rides that the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) organized to desegregate the interstate buses and bus station restaurants along U.S. Route 40 between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., as they came under federal rather than state law. They had been segregated by custom. He was frequently arrested and spent time in jail. He was arrested so many times for his activism that he lost count, sometimes estimating 29 or 32. In 1998, he told the &quot;Washington Post&quot; that he thought the total was fewer than 36.

Along with eight other riders, on June 4, 1961, Carmichael traveled by train from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Jackson, Mississippi, to integrate the formerly &quot;white&quot; section on the train. Before getting on the train in New Orleans, they encountered white protesters blocking the way. Carmichael said, &quot;They were shouting. Throwing cans and lit cigarettes at us. Spitting on us.&quot; Eventually, the group was able to board the train. When the group arrived in Jackson, Carmichael and the eight other riders entered a &quot;white&quot; cafeteria. They were charged with disturbing the peace, arrested, and taken to jail.

Eventually, Carmichael was transferred to the infamous Parchman Penitentiary in Sunflower County, Mississippi, along with other Freedom Riders. He gained notoriety as a witty and hard-nosed leader among the prisoners.

He served 49 days with other activists at Parchman. At 19, Carmichael was the youngest detainee in the summer of 1961. He spent 53 days at Parchman in a six-by-nine cell. He and his colleagues were allowed to shower only twice a week, were not allowed books or any other personal effects, and were at times placed in maximum security to isolate them.

Carmichael said of the Parchman Farm sheriff:

The sheriff acted like he was scared of black folks and he came up with some beautiful things. One night he opened up all the windows, put on ten big fans and an air conditioner, and dropped the temperature to 38 degrees [Fahrenheit; 3 °C]. All we had on was T-shirts and shorts.

While being hurt on one occasion, Carmichael began singing to the guards, &quot;I&#x27;m gonna tell God how you treat me&quot;, and the other prisoners joined in.

Carmichael kept the group&#x27;s morale up in prison, often telling jokes with Steve Green and the other Freedom Riders, and making light of their situation. He knew their situation was serious:

What with the range of ideology, religious belief, political commitment and background, age, and experience, something interesting was always going on. Because no matter our differences, this group had one thing in common, moral stubbornness. Whatever we believed, we really believed and were not at all shy about advancing. We were where we were only because of our willingness to affirm our beliefs even at the risk of physical injury. So it was never dull on death row.

In a 1964 interview with author Robert Penn Warren, Carmichael reflected on his motives for going on the rides:

I thought I have to go because you&#x27;ve got to keep the issue alive, and you&#x27;ve got to show the Southerners that you&#x27;re not gonna be scared off, as we&#x27;ve been scared off in the past. And no matter what they do, we&#x27;re still gonna keep coming back.

==1964–67: SNCC==
===Mississippi and Cambridge, Maryland===
In 1964, Carmichael became a full-time field organizer for SNCC in Mississippi. He worked on the Greenwood voting rights project under Bob Moses. Throughout Freedom Summer, he worked with grassroots African American activists, including Fannie Lou Hamer, whom Carmichael named as one of his personal heroes. SNCC organizer Joann Gavin wrote that Hamer and Carmichael &quot;understood one another as perhaps no one else could.&quot;

He also worked closely with Gloria Richardson, who led the SNCC chapter in Cambridge, Maryland. During a protest with Richardson in Maryland in June 1964, Carmichael was hit directly in a chemical gas attack by the National Guard and had to be hospitalized.

He soon became project director for Mississippi&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, made up largely of the counties of the Mississippi Delta. At that time, most blacks in Mississippi had been disfranchised since the passage of a new constitution in 1890. The summer project was to prepare them to register to vote and conduct a parallel registration movement to demonstrate how much people wanted to vote. Grassroots activists organized the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), as the regular Democratic Party did not represent African Americans in the state. At the end of Freedom Summer, Carmichael went to the 1964 Democratic Convention in support of the MFDP, which sought to have its delegation seated. But the MFDP delegates were refused voting rights by the Democratic National Committee, which chose to seat the regular white Jim Crow delegation. Carmichael, along with many SNCC staff members, left the convention with a profound sense of disillusionment in the American political system, and what he later called &quot;totalitarian liberal opinion&quot;. He said, &quot;what the liberal really wants is to bring about change which will not in any way endanger his position&quot;.

===Selma to Montgomery marches===
Having developed an aversion to working with the Democratic Party after the 1964 convention, Carmichael decided to leave the MFDP. Instead, he began exploring SNCC projects in Alabama in 1965. During the period of the Selma to Montgomery marches, James Forman recruited him to participate in a &quot;second front&quot; to stage protests at the Alabama State Capitol in March 1965. Carmichael became disillusioned with the growing struggles between SNCC and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), which opposed Forman&#x27;s strategy. He thought SCLC was working with affiliated black churches to undercut it. He was also frustrated to be drawn again into nonviolent confrontations with police, which he no longer found empowering. After seeing protesters brutally beaten again, he collapsed from stress, and his colleagues urged him to leave the city.

Within a week, Carmichael returned to protesting, this time in Selma, to participate in the final march along Route 80 to the state capital. But on March 23, 1965, Carmichael and some in SNCC who were participating in the Selma to Montgomery march declined to complete the march, instead initiating a grassroots project in &quot;Bloody Lowndes&quot; County, along the march route, talking with local residents. This was a county known for white violence against blacks during this era, where SCLC and Martin Luther King Jr. had tried and failed to organize its black residents. From 1877 to 1950, Lowndes County had 14 documented lynchings of African Americans. Carmichael and the SNCC activists who accompanied him also struggled in Lowndes, as local residents were at first wary of their presence. But they later achieved greater success as a result of a partnership with local activist John Hulett and other local leaders.

===Lowndes County Freedom Organization===
In 1965, working as a SNCC activist in the black majority Lowndes County, Alabama, Carmichael helped increase the number of registered black voters from 70 to 2,600, being 300 more than the number of registered white voters. Black voters had essentially been disfranchised by Alabama&#x27;s constitution, passed by white Democrats in 1901. After Congressional passage in August of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the federal government was authorized to oversee and enforce their rights. There was still tremendous resistance from wary residents, but an important breakthrough occurred when, while he was handing out voter registration material at a local school, two policemen confronted Carmichael and ordered him to leave. He refused and avoided arrest after challenging the two officers to do so. As word of this incident spread, Carmichael and the SNCC activists who stayed with him in Lowndes gained more respect from local residents and started working with Hulett and other local leaders. With the objective of registering African American voters, Carmichael, Hulett and their local allies formed the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO), a party that had the black panther as its mascot, over the white-dominated local Democratic Party, whose mascot was a white rooster. Since federal protection from violent voter suppression by the Ku Klux Klan and other white opponents was sporadic, most Lowndes County activists openly carried arms.

Despite Carmichael&#x27;s role in forming the LCFO, Hulett served as the group&#x27;s chairperson and became one of the first two African Americans whose voter registration was successfully processed in Lowndes County. Although black residents and voters outnumbered whites in Lowndes, their candidate lost the countywide election of 1965. In 1966, several LCFO candidates ran for office in the general election but lost. In 1970, the LCFO merged with the statewide Democratic Party, and former LCFO candidates, including Hulett, won their first offices in the county.

===Chairman of SNCC and Black Power===

In August 1963, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee elected as its chairman John Lewis, one of the &quot;Big Six&quot; activists who organized the March on Washington. Carmichael said Lewis was &quot;regular guy, uncomplicated, friendly, and brave&quot;, while Carmichael himself led a faction whose direction was toward a path &quot;less regular&quot; and &quot;a lot less friendly&quot;.

In 1966, the SNCC convened in Kingston Springs, Tennessee, and reelected Lewis by a 60-22 vote. Activist Worth Long challenged the election on procedural grounds and, in the debate that followed, Lewis was repeatedly denounced and the meeting concluded with Carmichael elected as chairman. One of his first actions was to call upon all fellow black activists to continue writer and Air Force veteran James Meredith&#x27;s solitary March Against Fear. Meredith had not wanted any well-known civil rights organizations or leaders involved in the action but would accept individual black men. On his second day out, Meredith was shot and wounded by a sniper and was hospitalized. 

Carmichael joined King, Floyd McKissick, Cleveland Sellers and others to continue Meredith&#x27;s march. He was arrested while marching through Greenwood, and, after his release, gave his first &quot;Black Power&quot; speech at a rally that night, using the term to urge black pride and socioeconomic independence:

According to historian David J. Garrow, a few days after Carmichael spoke about Black Power at the rally during &quot;Meredith March Against Fear&quot;, he told King: &quot;Martin, I deliberately decided to raise this issue on the march in order to give it a national forum and force you to take a stand for Black Power.&quot; King responded, &quot;I have been used before. One more time won&#x27;t hurt.&quot;

While Black Power was not a new concept, Carmichael&#x27;s speech brought it into the spotlight. It became a rallying cry for young African Americans across the country who were frustrated by slow progress in civil rights, even after federal legislation had been passed to strengthen the effort. Everywhere that Black Power spread, if accepted, Carmichael got credit. If it was condemned, he was held responsible and blamed. According to Carmichael, &quot;Black Power meant black people coming together to form a political force and either electing representatives or forcing their representatives to speak to their needs [rather than relying on established parties].&quot; Strongly influenced by the work of Frantz Fanon and his landmark book &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot;, along with others such as Malcolm X, Carmichael led SNCC to become more radical. The group focused on Black Power as its core goal and ideology.

During the controversial Atlanta Project in 1966, SNCC, under the local leadership of Bill Ware, engaged in a voter drive to promote the candidacy of Julian Bond from an Atlanta district for a seat in the Georgia State Legislature. Ware excluded Northern white SNCC members from working on this drive. Carmichael initially opposed this decision but changed his mind. At the urging of the Atlanta Project, the issue of white members in SNCC came up for a vote. Carmichael ultimately sided with those calling for the expulsion of whites. He said that whites should organize poor white southern communities, of which there were plenty, while SNCC focused on promoting African American self-reliance through Black Power.

Carmichael considered nonviolence a tactic, not a fundamental principle, which separated him from civil rights leaders such as King. He criticized civil rights leaders who called for the integration of African Americans into existing institutions of the middle-class mainstream.

Now, several people have been upset because we&#x27;ve said that integration was irrelevant when initiated by blacks, and that in fact it was a subterfuge, an insidious subterfuge, for the maintenance of white supremacy. Now we maintain that in the past six years or so, this country has been feeding us a &quot;thalidomide drug of integration&quot;, and that some Negroes have been walking down a dream street talking about sitting next to white people; and that that does not begin to solve the problem; that when we went to Mississippi we did not go to sit next to Ross Barnett; we did not go to sit next to Jim Clark; we went to get them out of our way; and that people ought to understand that; that we were never fighting for the right to integrate, we were fighting against white supremacy. Now, then, in order to understand white supremacy we must dismiss the fallacious notion that white people can give anybody their freedom. No man can give anybody his freedom. A man is born free. You may enslave a man after he is born free, and that is in fact what this country does. It enslaves black people after they&#x27;re born, so that the only acts that white people can do is to stop denying black people their freedom; that is, they must stop &quot;denying&quot; freedom. They never give it to anyone.

Carmichael wrote that &quot;in order for nonviolence to work, your opponent must have a conscience. The United States has none.&quot;

During Carmichael&#x27;s leadership, SNCC continued to maintain a coalition with several white radical organizations, most notably Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). It encouraged the SDS to focus on militant anti-draft resistance. At an SDS-organized conference at UC Berkeley in October 1966, Carmichael challenged the white left to escalate their resistance to the military draft in a manner similar to the black movement. For a time in 1967, he considered an alliance with Saul Alinsky&#x27;s Industrial Areas Foundation, and generally supported IAF&#x27;s work in Rochester&#x27;s and Buffalo&#x27;s black communities.

===Vietnam===
SNCC conducted its first actions against the military draft and the Vietnam War under Carmichael&#x27;s leadership. He popularized the oft-repeated anti-draft slogan &quot;Hell no, we won&#x27;t go!&quot; during this time.

Carmichael encouraged King to demand unconditional withdrawal of US troops from Vietnam, even as some King advisers cautioned him that such opposition might have an adverse effect on financial contributions to the SCLC. King preached one of his earliest speeches calling for unconditional withdrawal with Carmichael in the front row at his invitation. Carmichael privately took credit for pushing King toward anti-imperialism, and historians such as Peniel Joseph and Michael Eric Dyson agree.

Carmichael joined King in New York on April 15, 1967, to share his views with protesters on race related to the Vietnam War:

==1967–68: Transition out of SNCC==
===Stepping down as chair===
In May 1967, Carmichael stepped down as chairman of SNCC and was replaced by H. Rap Brown. SNCC was a collective, working by group consensus rather than hierarchically; many members had become displeased with Carmichael&#x27;s celebrity status. SNCC leaders had begun to refer to him as &quot;Stokely Starmichael&quot; and criticized his habit of making policy announcements independently, before achieving internal agreement. According to historian Clayborne Carson, Carmichael did not protest the transfer of power and was &quot;eager to relinquish the chair&quot;. It is sometimes mistakenly reported that Carmichael left SNCC completely at this time and joined the Black Panther Party, but that did not occur until 1968. SNCC officially ended its relationship with Carmichael in August 1968; in a statement, Philip Hutchings wrote: &quot;It has been apparent for some time that SNCC and Stokely Carmichael were moving in different directions.&quot;

===Targeted by FBI COINTELPRO===
During this period, Carmichael was targeted by a section of J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s COINTELPRO (counter-intelligence program) that focused on black activists; the program promoted slander and violence against targets Hoover considered enemies of the US government. It attempted to discredit them and worse. Carmichael accepted the position of Honorary Prime Minister in the Black Panther Party, but also remained on the SNCC staff. He tried to forge a merger between the two organizations. A March 4, 1968, memo from Hoover states his fear of the rise of a Black Nationalist &quot;messiah&quot; and that Carmichael alone had the &quot;necessary charisma to be a real threat in this way&quot;. In July 1968, Hoover stepped up his efforts to divide the black power movement. Declassified documents show he launched a plan to undermine the SNCC-Panther merger, as well as to &quot;bad-jacket&quot; Carmichael as a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent. Both efforts were largely successful: Carmichael was expelled from SNCC that year, and the Panthers began to denounce him, putting him at grave personal risk.

===International activism===
After stepping down as SNCC chair, Carmichael wrote the book &quot;Black Power: The Politics of Liberation&quot; (1967) with Charles V. Hamilton. It is a first-person reflection on his experiences in SNCC and his dissatisfaction with the direction of the Civil Rights Movement in the late 1960s. Throughout the work he directly and indirectly criticizes the established leadership of the SCLC and NAACP for their tactics and results, often claiming that they were accepting symbols instead of change.

He promoted what he calls &quot;political modernization.&quot; This idea included three major concepts: &quot;1) questioning old values and institutions of the society; 2) searching for new and different forms of political structure to solve political and economic problems; and, 3) broadening the base of political participation to include more people in the decision-making process.&quot; By questioning &quot;old values and institutions&quot;, Carmichael was referring not only to the established Black leadership of the time but also to the values and institutions of the nation as a whole. He criticized the emphasis on the American &quot;middle-class.&quot; &quot;The values,&quot; he said, &quot;of that class are based on material aggrandizement, not the expansion of humanity.&quot; (40) Carmichael believed that blacks were being lured to enter the &quot;middle-class&quot; as a trap, in which they would be assimilated into the white world by turning their backs on others of their race who were still suffering. This assimilation, he thought, was an inherent indictment of blackness and validation of whiteness as the preferred state. He said, &quot;Thus we reject the goal of assimilation into middle-class America because the values of that class are in themselves anti-humanist and because that class as a social force perpetuates racism.&quot;

Secondly, Carmichael discussed searching for different forms of political structure to solve political and economic problems. At the time, the established forms of political structure were the SCLC and the NAACP. These groups were religiously and academically based and focused on nonviolence and steady legal and legislative change within established U.S. systems and structures. Carmichael rejected that. He discusses the development of the Mississippi Freedom Democrats, the 1966 local election in Lowndes County, and the political history of Tuskegee, Alabama. He chose these examples as places where blacks changed the system by political and legal maneuvering within the system, but said they ultimately failed to achieve more than the bare minimum. In the process, he believed they reinforced the political and legal structures that perpetuated the racism they were fighting.

In response to these failures and to offer a way forward, Carmichael discusses the concept of coalition with regard to the Civil Rights Movement. The leadership of the movement had affirmed that anyone who truly believed in their cause was welcome to join and march. Carmichael offered a different vision. Influenced by Fanon&#x27;s ideas in &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot;, wherein two groups were not &quot;complementary&quot; (could have no overlap) until they were mutually exclusive (were on an equal power footing economically, socially, politically, etc.), Carmichael said that U.S. blacks had to unite and build their power independent of the white structure, or they would never be able to build a coalition that would function for both parties, not just the dominant one. He said, &quot;we want to establish the grounds on which we feel political coalitions can be viable.&quot; For this to happen, Carmichael argued that blacks had to address three myths regarding coalition: &quot;that the interests of black people are identical with the interests of certain liberal, labor, or other reform groups&quot;; that a viable coalition can be created between &quot;the politically and economically secure and the politically and economically insecure&quot;; and that a coalition can be &quot;sustained on a moral, friendly, sentimental basis; by appeals to conscience.&quot; He believed that each of these myths showed the need for two groups to be mutually exclusive, and on relatively equal footing, to be in a viable coalition.

This philosophy, grounded in the independence literature of Africa and Latin America, became the basis for a great deal of Carmichael&#x27;s work. He believed the Black Power Movement had to be developed outside the white power structure.

Carmichael also continued as a strong critic of the Vietnam War and imperialism in general. During this period, he traveled and lectured extensively throughout the world, visiting Guinea, North Vietnam, China, and Cuba. He became more clearly identified with the Black Panther Party as its &quot;Honorary Prime Minister.&quot; During this period, he acted more as a speaker than an organizer, traveling throughout the country and internationally advocating for his vision of Black Power.

Carmichael lamented the 1967 execution of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara, saying:

Carmichael visited the United Kingdom in July 1967 to attend the Dialectics of Liberation conference. After recordings of his speeches were released by the organizers, the Institute of Phenomenological Studies, he was banned from reentering the United Kingdom. In August 1967, a Cuban government magazine reported that Carmichael met with Fidel Castro for three days and called it &quot;the most educational, most interesting, and the best apprenticeship of [my] public life.&quot; Because relations with Cuba were prohibited at the time, after his return to the US, the government withdrew his passport. In December 1967, he traveled to France to attend an antiwar rally. There he was detained by police and ordered to leave the next day, but government officials eventually intervened and allowed him to stay.

===1968 D.C. riots===
Carmichael was present in Washington, D.C., on April 5, 1968, the night after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. He led a group through the streets, demanding that businesses close out of respect. He tried to prevent violence, but the situation escalated beyond his control. Due to his reputation as a provocateur, the news media blamed Carmichael for the ensuing violence as mobs rioted along U Street and other areas of black commercial development.

Carmichael held a press conference the next day at which he predicted mass racial violence in the streets. Since moving to Washington, he had been under nearly constant FBI surveillance. After the riots, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover instructed a team of agents to find evidence connecting Carmichael to them. He was also subjected to COINTELPRO&#x27;s bad-jacketing technique. Huey P. Newton suggested Carmichael was a CIA agent, slander that led to Carmichael&#x27;s break with the Panthers and his exile from the U.S. the following year.

==1969–98: Travel to Africa==

In 1968, he married Miriam Makeba, a noted singer from South Africa. They left the US for Guinea the next year. Carmichael became an aide to Guinean president Ahmed Sékou Touré, and a student of the exiled Ghanaian president Kwame Nkrumah. Makeba was appointed Guinea&#x27;s delegate to the United Nations.

===Break with the Black Panthers===
Three months after his arrival in Guinea, in July 1969 Carmichael published a formal rejection of the Black Panthers, condemning them for not being separatist enough and for their &quot;dogmatic party line favoring alliances with white radicals&quot;. The Panthers believed that white activists could help the movement, while Carmichael had come to agree with Malcolm X that white activists should organize their own communities before trying to lead black people.

===Life in Guinea===
Carmichael remained in Guinea after his separation from the Black Panther Party. He continued to travel, write, and speak in support of international leftist movements. In 1971 he published his collected essays in a second book, &quot;Stokely Speaks: Black Power Back to Pan-Africanism&quot;. This book expounds an explicitly socialist Pan-African vision, which he retained for the rest of his life.

Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Ture in 1978 to honor Nkrumah and Touré, who had become his patrons. At the end of his life, friends called him by both names, &quot;and he doesn&#x27;t seem to mind&quot;.

In 1986, two years after Sékou Touré&#x27;s death, the military regime that took his place arrested Carmichael for his association with Touré, and jailed him for three days on suspicion of attempting to overthrow the government. Although Touré was known for jailing and torturing his opponents (some 50,000 people are believed to have been killed under his regime) Carmichael had never publicly criticized the man he named himself after. From the late 1970s till his death, he answered his phone by announcing: &quot;Ready for the revolution!&quot;

=== U.S. and British government attention ===

Carmichael&#x27;s suspicions about CIA surveillance were confirmed in 2007 by declassified documents revealing that the agency had tracked him from 1968 as part of their surveillance of Black activists abroad. The surveillance continued for years.

Documents declassified in 2022 revealed that the Information Research Department (IRD) of the British Foreign Office, concerned by Carmichael&#x27;s socialist and pan-Africanist views, created a fake organization which published literature critical of Carmichael. The IRD created &quot;The Black Power – Africa&#x27;s Heritage Group&quot;, supposedly based in West Africa, and via the organization disseminated a pamphlet portraying Carmichael &quot;as a foreign interloper in Africa who was contemptuous of the inhabitants of the continent&quot;. The pamphlet, which said, &quot;Enough is enough – why Stokely must go! – and do his thing elsewhere&quot;, alleged that Carmichael was controlled by Nkrumah and was &quot;weaving a bloody trail of chaos in the name of Pan-Africanism&quot;.

===All-African People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party===
For the final 30 years of his life, Kwame Ture was devoted to the All-African People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (A-APRP). His mentor Nkrumah had many ideas for unifying the African continent, and Ture extended the scope of these ideas to the entire African diaspora. He was a Central Committee member during his association with the A-APRP and made many speeches on the party&#x27;s behalf.

Ture did not simply study with Touré and Nkrumah. The latter had been designated honorary co-president of Guinea after he was deposed by the US-backed coup in Ghana. Ture worked overtly and covertly to &quot;Take Nkrumah Back to Ghana&quot; (according to the movement&#x27;s slogan). He became a member of the Democratic Party of Guinea (PDG), the revolutionary ruling party. He sought Nkrumah&#x27;s permission to launch the All-African People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (A-APRP), which Nkrumah had called for in his book &quot;Handbook of Revolutionary Warfare&quot;. After several discussions, Nkrumah gave his blessing.

Ture was convinced that the A-APRP was needed as a permanent mass-based organization in all countries where people of African descent lived. For the last decades of his life, a period often ignored by popular media, Ture worked full-time as an organizer of the party. He spoke on its behalf on several continents, at college campuses, community centers, and other venues. He was instrumental in strengthening ties between the African/Black liberation movement and several revolutionary or progressive organizations, both African and non-African. Notable among them were the American Indian Movement (AIM) of the United States, New Jewel Movement (Grenada), National Joint Action Committee (NJAC) of Trinidad and Tobago, Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the Pan Africanist Congress (South Africa) and the Irish Republican Socialist Party.

Routinely, Ture was regarded as the leader of the A-APRP, but his only titles were &quot;Organizer&quot; and Central Committee member. Beginning in the mid-1970s, the A-APRP began each May to sponsor African Liberation Day (ALD), a continuation of the African Freedom Day Nkrumah began in 1958 in Ghana. Although the party was involved in or was primary or co-sponsor of other ALD annual observances, marches, and rallies around the world, the best-known and largest event was held annually in Washington, D.C., usually at Meridian Hill Park (also known as Malcolm X Park) at 16th and W Streets, NW.

====Lecturing in the Caribbean and the United States====
While making his home in Guinea, Ture traveled frequently. In the last quarter of the 20th century, he became the world&#x27;s most active and prominent exponent of pan-Africanism, defined by Nkrumah and the A-APRP as &quot;The Liberation and Unification of Africa Under Scientific Socialism&quot;.

Ture often returned to speak to audiences of thousands (including students and townspeople) at his alma mater, Howard University, and other campuses. The Party worked to recruit students and other youth, and Ture hoped to attract them with his speeches. He also worked to raise the political consciousness of African/Black people in general. He formed the A-APRP with the initial goal of putting &quot;Africa&quot; on the lips of Black people throughout the diaspora, knowing that many did not consciously or positively relate to their ancestral homeland. Ture was convinced that the party significantly raised international black &quot;consciousness&quot; of Pan-Africanism. The government of Trinidad and Tobago barred him from lecturing in the country for fear that he would cause disturbances among black Trinidadians.

Under his leadership, the A-APRP organized the All African Women&#x27;s Revolutionary Union and the Sammy Younge Jr. Brigade (named after the first black college student to die during the 1960s Civil Rights Movement) as component organizations.

Ture and Cuban president Fidel Castro admired each other, sharing a common opposition to imperialism. In Ture&#x27;s final letter, he wrote:

It was Fidel Castro who before the OLAS (Organization of Latin American States) Conference said &quot;if imperialism touches one grain of hair on his head, we shall not let the fact pass without retaliation.&quot; It was he, who on his own behalf, asked them all to stay in contact with me when I returned to the United States to offer me protection.

Ture was ill when he gave his final speech at Howard University. A standing-room-only crowd in Rankin Chapel paid tribute to him, and he spoke boldly, as usual. A small group of student leaders from Howard and a former Party member traveled to Harlem (Sugar Hill) in New York City to bid Ture farewell shortly before his final return to Guinea. Also present that evening were Kathleen Cleaver and another Black Panther, Dhoruba bin Wahad. Ture was in good spirits though in pain. The group included men and women born in Africa, South America, the Caribbean, as well as the USA.

==Illness and death==
After his diagnosis of prostate cancer in 1996, Ture was treated for a period in Cuba, while receiving some support from the Nation of Islam. Benefit concerts for Ture were held in Denver, New York, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C., to help defray his medical expenses. The government of Trinidad and Tobago, where he was born, awarded him a grant of $1,000 a month for the same purpose. He went to New York, where he was treated for two years at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, before returning to Guinea.

In a final interview given in April 1998 to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Ture criticized the limited economic and electoral progress made by African Americans in the U.S. during the previous 30 years. He acknowledged that Black people had won election to the mayor&#x27;s office in major cities, but said that, as the mayors&#x27; power had generally diminished over earlier decades, such progress was essentially meaningless.
In 1998, Ture died of prostate cancer at the age of 57 in Conakry, Guinea. He had said that his cancer &quot;was given to me by forces of American imperialism and others who conspired with them.&quot; He claimed that the FBI had infected him with cancer in an assassination attempt.

The civil rights leader Jesse Jackson spoke in celebration of Ture&#x27;s life, saying: &quot;He was one of our generation who was determined to give his life to transforming America and Africa. He was committed to ending racial apartheid in our country. He helped to bring those walls down&quot;. NAACP Chair Julian Bond said that Carmichael &quot;ought to be remembered for having spent almost every moment of his adult life trying to advance the cause of black liberation.&quot;

==Carmichael&#x27;s marriages and divorces==
Ture married singer Miriam Makeba from South Africa in the U.S. in 1968. They divorced in Guinea after separating in 1973.

Later he married Marlyatou Barry, a Guinean doctor. They divorced sometime after having a son, Bokar, in 1981. By 1998, Marlyatou Barry and Bokar were living in Arlington County, Virginia, near Washington, D.C. Using a statement from the All-African People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party as a reference, Ture&#x27;s 1998 obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said he was survived by two sons, Bokar Biro Ture and Alpha Yaya Ture; three sisters; and his mother.

==Legacy==
Ture, along with Charles V. Hamilton, is credited developing the concept of &quot;institutional racism&quot;, defined as racism that occurs through institutions such as public bodies and corporations, including universities. In the late 1960s Ture defined &quot;institutional racism&quot; as &quot;the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their color, culture or ethnic origin&quot;.

In his book on King, David J. Garrow criticizes Ture&#x27;s handling of the Black Power movement as &quot;more destructive than constructive&quot;. Garrow describes the period in 1966 when Ture and other SNCC members managed to register 2,600 African American voters in Lowndes County as the most consequential period in Ture&#x27;s life &quot;in terms of real, positive, tangible influence on people&#x27;s lives&quot;. Evaluations by Ture&#x27;s associates are also mixed, with most praising his efforts and others criticizing him for failing to find constructive ways to achieve his objectives. SNCC&#x27;s final chair, Phil Hutchings, who expelled Ture over a dispute about the Black Panther Party, wrote: &quot;Even though we kidded and called him &#x27;Starmichael&#x27;, he could sublimate his ego to get done what was needed to be done...He would say what he thought, and you could disagree with it but you wouldn&#x27;t cease being a human being and someone with whom he wanted to be in relationship.&quot; &quot;Washington Post&quot; staff writer Paula Span described Carmichael as someone who was rarely hesitant to push his own ideology. Tufts University historian Peniel Joseph&#x27;s biography, &quot;Stokely: A Life&quot;, says that Black Power activist Ruby Doris Smith Robinson, the first to call him as &quot;Stokely Starmichael,&quot; gave him the nickname in protest of his growing ego and that other SNCC staff shared her view.

Joseph credits Ture with expanding the parameters of the civil rights movement, asserting that his black power strategy &quot;didn&#x27;t disrupt the civil rights movement. It spoke truth to power to what so many millions of young people were feeling. It actually cast a light on people who were in prisons, people who were welfare rights activists, tenants&#x27; rights activists, and also in the international arena.&quot; Tavis Smiley calls Ture &quot;one of the most underappreciated, misunderstood, undervalued personalities this country&#x27;s ever produced&quot;.

In 2002, the American-born scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Ture as one of his 100 Greatest African Americans.

Ture is also remembered for his actions in James Meredith&#x27;s March Against Fear in June 1966, when he issued the call for Black Power. When Meredith got shot, Carmichael came up with the phrase and gathered a crowd to chant it in Greenwood, Mississippi. Already, earlier that day, he had been arrested for the 27th time; he spoke to over 3,000 people that day in the park. Ture was angry that day because black people had been &quot;chanting&quot; freedom for almost six years with no results, so he wanted to change the chant. He also participated in and contributed to the Black Freedom Struggle. Many people have overlooked his involvement in the movement. He never switched from left to right in his politics as he got older, and his trajectory both marked and influenced the course of black militancy in the United States. The outrage that most affected him was King&#x27;s assassination.

==Controversies==
===Alleged antisemitism===
According to Abraham H. Foxman, National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, Carmichael was &quot;an unabashed racial separatist and anti-Semite&quot; who often used the slogan &quot;the only good Zionist is a dead Zionist&quot; and in 1990 said that &quot;Zionist pigs have been harassing us everywhere. . . . And when this anger rises, [we] will snap our fingers and finish them off.&quot;

Although he wrote in his posthumously published memoirs that he had never been antisemitic, in 1970 Carmichael proclaimed: &quot;I have never admired a white man, but the greatest of them, to my mind, was Hitler.&quot; But in the same speech, Carmichael condemned Hitler on moral grounds, saying:

Adolf Hitler, I&#x27;m not putting a judgment on what he did. If you asked me for my judgment morally, I would say it was bad, what he did was wrong, was evil, etc. But I would say he was a genius, nevertheless ... You say he&#x27;s not a genius because he committed bad acts. That&#x27;s not the question. The question is, he does have genius. Now when we condemn him morally or ethically, we will say, well, he was absolutely wrong, he should be killed, he should be murdered, etc., etc. ... But if we&#x27;re judging his genius objectively, we have to admit that the man was a genius. He forced the entire world to fight him. He was fighting America, France, Britain, Russia, Italy once—then they switched sides—all of them at the same time, and whipping them. That&#x27;s a genius, you cannot deny that.

===Views on women===
In November 1964 Carmichael made a joking remark in response to a SNCC position paper written by his friends Casey Hayden and Mary E. King on the position of women in the movement. In the course of an irreverent comedy monologue he performed at a party after SNCC&#x27;s Waveland conference, Carmichael said, &quot;The position of women in the movement is prone.&quot; A number of women were offended. In a 2006 &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; article, historian Peniel E. Joseph later wrote:

While the remark was made in jest during a 1964 conference, Carmichael and black-power activists did embrace an aggressive vision of manhood—one centered on black men&#x27;s ability to deploy authority, punishment, and power. In that, they generally reflected their wider society&#x27;s blinders about women and politics.

Carmichael&#x27;s colleague, John Lewis, stated in his autobiography, &quot;March&quot;, that the comment was a joke, uttered as Carmichael and other SNCC officials were &quot;blowing off steam&quot; following the adjournment of a meeting at a staff retreat in Waveland, Mississippi. When asked about the comment, former SNCC field secretary Casey Hayden stated: &quot;Our paper on the position of women came up, and Stokely in his hipster rap comedic way joked that &#x27;the proper position of women in SNCC is prone&#x27;. I laughed, he laughed, we all laughed. Stokely was a friend of mine.&quot; In her memoir, Mary E. King wrote that Carmichael was &quot;poking fun at his own attitudes&quot; and that &quot;Casey and I felt, and continue to feel, that Stokely was one of the most responsive men at the time that our anonymous paper appeared in 1964.&quot;

Carmichael appointed several women to posts as project directors during his tenure as chairman of SNCC; by the latter half of the 1960s (considered to be the &quot;Black Power era&quot;), more women were in charge of SNCC projects than during the first half.

<text>The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, known as the Kerner Commission after its chair, Governor Otto Kerner Jr. of Illinois, was an 11-member Presidential Commission established in July 1967 by President Lyndon B. Johnson in to investigate the causes of over 150 riots throughout the country in 1967 and to provide recommendations that would prevent them from reoccurring.

The report was released in 1968 after seven months of investigation. Rather than attributing the rioting to a small group of outsiders or trouble-makers (&quot;riffraff&quot;) as many prior riot investigations had done or to radicals or a foreign conspiracy as almost three-fourths of white America believed, the Commission concluded that the rioting was a response to decades of &quot;pervasive discrimination and segregation.&quot; Said the Commission, &quot;White racism is essentially responsible for the explosive mixture which has been accumulating in our cities since the end of World War II . . . What white Americans have never fully understood--but what the Black can never forget, is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.&quot;

The Commission&#x27;s 426-page report is regarded as &quot;the touchstone for race relations&quot; and as &quot;one of the two seminal works&quot; on race in this country. It was also a bestseller, outselling even the Warren Report which dealt with President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination.

== Background ==

President Johnson appointed the Commission on July 28, 1967, while rioting was still underway in Detroit. There had been mounting civil unrest in a few predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods since 1965, but what happened in 1967 shocked and terrified much of America as the evening news seemed to regularly show National Guardsmen and police crouching behind parked cars, tanks rumbling down dark streets, towering fires, and blocks and blocks of rubble and broken windows.

In his remarks upon signing the order to establish the Commission, Johnson asked for answers to three basic questions about the riots: &quot;What happened? Why did it happen? What can be done to prevent it from happening again and again?&quot;

== Operations ==
David Ginsburg was selected by President Johnson to serve as the Commission&#x27;s executive director within two days of the Commission&#x27;s official creation. Victor Palmieri was then hired by Ginsburg several weeks later to serve as the Commission&#x27;s deputy executive director. A staff of approximately 200 was quickly hired and an elaborate, multi-faceted strategy for investigating the rioting, determining who had rioted and why, and for developing recommendations was developed. This methodology featured examining the characteristics of 13,000 people who had been arrested for rioting, sending six-member field teams to over twenty cities, interviewing state and local law enforcement personnel, using FBI reports, studying census bureau data, and talking to and conducting public opinion polling of riot area residents.

The Commission was also aided by the work of the National Advisory Panel on Insurance in Riot-Affected Areas, which was appointed by President Johnson and by an advisory panel on private enterprise that the Commission itself created. The insurance committee, which became known as the Hughes Panel after its chairman, New Jersey governor Richard Hughes, was created because of the concern that insurance companies, which had already begun abandoning minority areas in the years before 1967, would only accelerate this trend now that massive property damage had occurred in cities like Newark and Detroit. This committee&#x27;s recommendations were summarized and included as Chapter 14 in the Kerner Report. The Commission&#x27;s private enterprise panel was created to identify what incentives might encourage businesses to hire low-income workers or expand or relocate to low-income/minority areas. Its recommendations were included in the &quot;employment&quot; subsection of Chapter 17 in the Kerner Report.

== Report summary ==
The Commission&#x27;s final work, &quot;Report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders&quot; or Kerner Report, was issued on February 29, 1968. The Report became an instant bestseller, and more than two million Americans bought copies of the 426-page document. Its primary finding was that the riots resulted from Black frustration at the lack of economic opportunity and the manner in which they were treated by white society, especially by the police. Martin Luther King Jr. pronounced the report a &quot;physician&#x27;s warning of approaching death, with a prescription for life.&quot;

The report was made available through the US Government Printing Office, but it was Bantam Books who published the full report that most people purchased or read. Bantam published it in an inexpensive, mass-market paperback book format with an introduction written by Tom Wicker of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

The report berated federal and state governments for failed housing, education, and social-service policies. The report also aimed some of its sharpest criticism at the media. &quot;The press has too long basked in a white world looking out of it, if at all, with white men&#x27;s eyes and white perspective.&quot; The report combined a detailed description of how eight riots unfolded and ended with governmental statistics that demonstrated the differences in living conditions between America&#x27;s Black and white populations. It also included a chapter on African American history and a chapter on how the European immigrant experience differed from what Blacks were experiencing and a vast array of recommendations pertaining to the police, the justice system, property insurance, the media, employment, education, welfare, and housing&quot;.

The report&#x27;s best-known passage warned: &quot;Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal.&quot;

It concluded that the main cause of the violence was white racism and suggested that white America bore much of the responsibility for Black rioting and rebellion. Its study of arrested rioters found that these individuals were not transients, habitual criminals, or unemployed troublemakers. In fact, these individuals were usually lifelong residents of the city where they rioted, they had actually stayed in school a little longer and had previously been arrested no more than the average person from their neighborhood, and they had a job (albeit one that did not pay particularly well).

It is also important to note that neither the Commission nor the FBI found any evidence that the rioting was the result of a local, national or foreign conspiracy.

The Report called for an end to de facto segregation, the creation of new jobs, the construction of new housing, major changes to the welfare program, and the diversification of local police and the media.

The Commission further noted that:

* &quot;Unless there are sharp changes in the factors influencing Negro settlement patterns within metropolitan areas, there is little doubt that the trend toward Negro majorities will continue.&quot;
* &quot;Providing employment for the swelling Negro ghetto population will require ...opening suburban residential areas to Negroes and encouraging them to move closer to industrial centers...&quot;
* &quot;[c]ities will have Negro majorities by 1985 and the suburbs ringing them will remain largely all white unless there are major changes in Negro fertility rates, in migration settlement patterns or public policy.&quot;
* &quot;[w]e believe that the emphasis of the program should be changed from traditional publicly built slum based high rise projects to smaller units on scattered sites.&quot;

Findings from the Hughes Panel were also published separately from the Kerner Report under a report titled, &quot;Meeting The Insurance Crisis Of Our Cities&quot;, in January 1968. This panel found that insurance not being available was a contributor toward creating the conditions that spawned these civil disturbances. It specifically found that, from a survey of 3,000 businesses and homeowners in six major cities, 30% of homeowners and 40% of businesses had &quot;faced serious insurance problems&quot;.

== Reception ==
The report received widespread media coverage and had many mixed responses. Media coverage primarily looked at the recommendations and the report&#x27;s summary.

Conservatives disliked that blame was placed on white institutions and society and thought rioters were &quot;let off the hook.&quot; The response of Black news groups was mixed towards the report. Some Black newspapers like the &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot; and those they interviewed thought that the report did not have any new findings and was simply mirroring what Black people already knew. Others were happy that the report was simply acknowledging racism.

President Johnson, who had already pushed through the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, largely rejected the Commission&#x27;s report. It is thought that he disliked it because of a number of reasons: that the report did not adequately acknowledge the accomplishments of his Administration, that its call for &quot;unprecedented levels of funding&quot; was unrealistic and only exacerbated the budget problems that he was already having with Congress, and that he felt that a conspiracy had to be involved given the magnitude of the rioting.

A Harris poll taken about a month after the report was released found that only 37% of surveyed whites believed that the riots were mainly caused by racism. However, an earlier poll taken immediately after the Newark and Detroit riots had found that a much smaller amount—16%--had believed this to be true eight months earlier.

== Legacy ==
In April 1968, one month after the Kerner Report was published, Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated and rioting of protest and grief broke out in more than 100 cities. Although this rioting seemed to indicate that America was on its way to successive years of racially-oriented urban violence, which many feared, the rioting largely disappeared after 1968. It was not until 1980 that such rioting returned, and it was only in one city—Miami. It was then another twelve years until the Rodney King riot in Los Angeles that another significant disorder occurred.

It is generally thought that much of the Report has been ignored and that its recommendations have not been implemented. 

A number of its &quot;National Action&quot; recommendations have been addressed to questionable effectiveness, as per the criticism of each policy: Congress passed the Fair Housing Act about one month after the report&#x27;s completion, and within a few years, funding for the nation&#x27;s two largest urban aid programs (Model Cities and urban renewal), as well as federal aid for education, had been doubled. In addition, Congress passed the Community Development Act to build on the Fair Housing Act towards helping housing equality. Many of its major policing and riot control recommendations were also adopted: police forces are much more racially diverse than they were in 1967, formal grievance processes are now in place in almost every city, many cities utilize community policing programs which seek to get officers out of the patrol car so that they can build a rapport with the people on their beats. Police brutality is a massive social issue as evidenced by the many protests against them, such as those for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Freddie Gray. Mental disorders are now handled much differently than they were in 1967, police utilize new crowd control techniques like banning the firing of weapons over the heads of the crowd as a dispersal technique. Funding for mental asylums has been decimated as a result of the deinstitutionalization trend in public policy of the 1980s and austerity measures. The report itself has been cited in major housing discrimination and desegregation court cases and in economic studies. Its &quot;two societies&quot; warning has become a form of socio-political shorthand that is frequently used whenever there is a tragic police incident. Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and Donald Trump espoused a law and order platform that favored strong policing and suppression of riots. As the Report predicted, incidents of police brutality continued to spark riots and protest marches even after the 1960s had ended, although substantially much smaller in number, frequency and intensity, including the 1980 Miami riots, 1989 Miami riot, 1992 Los Angeles riots and West Las Vegas riots, 1992 Washington Heights riots, St. Petersburg, Florida riots of 1996, Cincinnati riots of 2001, 2013 Flatbush Riots, 2009 and 2010 riots associated with the shooting of Oscar Grant, 2014 Oakland riots, 2014 Ferguson unrest, 2015 Baltimore protests, 2016 Charlotte riot, 2016 Milwaukee riots, 2017 Anaheim protests, 2017 St. Louis protests and the 2020 George Floyd protests.

Many of its recommendations have not been enacted as of 2024. Head Start has never been funded at the level that the Commission desired nor has the Commission&#x27;s major welfare and job training recommendations been adopted. What may be more accurate to state about the Report is that instead of it being ignored or forgotten is that its implementation has not been &quot;consistent with the scope and urgency&quot; of its recommendations.

=== Continuation of the Commission ===
The Milton S. Eisenhower Foundation (the Eisenhower Foundation) was formed in 1981 to support the findings of the Kerner Commission and of the 1968 National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence (the National Violence Commission). Kerner Commission Executive Director Ginsburg, Kerner Commissioner and Senator Fred Harris (D-OK) and Kerner Commissioner and Senator Edward Brooke (R-MA) were among the founding trustees of the Eisenhower Foundation. The Foundation has released 25 year, 30 year and 40 year updates of the Kerner Commission&#x27;s final report.

To mark the 30th anniversary of the Kerner Report, the Eisenhower Foundation in 1998 sponsored two complementary reports, The Millennium Breach and Locked in the Poorhouse. The Millennium Breach, co-authored by commissioner Harris, found the racial divide had grown in the subsequent years with inner city unemployment at crisis levels.
The Millennium Breach found that most of the decade that followed the Kerner Report, America made progress on the principal fronts the report dealt with: race, poverty, and inner cities. Then progress stopped and in some ways reversed by a series of economic shocks and trends and the government&#x27;s action and inaction.

Harris reported in &quot;Locked in the Poorhouse&quot;, &quot;Today, thirty years after the Kerner Report, there is more poverty in America, it is deeper, blacker and browner than before, and it is more concentrated in the cities, which have become America&#x27;s poorhouses.&quot;

== Criticism ==
Gary T. Marx, one of the Commission&#x27;s consultant sociologists, wishes the report would have given every-day examples of the discrimination that existed in 1967. Without them, it enabled whites to believe that the Commission was incorrect or talking about someone else.

Conservatives were critical of the cost of the Commission&#x27;s many recommendations (there were over 170) at a time when the nation was already trying to fight both a domestic war on poverty and a war in Vietnam. Said one congressman: &quot;The recommendations of the President&#x27;s panel can be summed up in three words. &#x27;Spend more money.&#x27;&quot;

At a 1998 lecture commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Report, Stephan Thernstrom, a conservative voice and a professor of history at Harvard University, argued: &quot;Because the commission took for granted that the riots were the fault of white racism, it would have been awkward to have had to confront the question of why liberal Detroit blew up while Birmingham and other Southern cities — where conditions for blacks were infinitely worse — did not. Likewise, if the problem was white racism, why didn&#x27;t the riots occur in the 1930s, when prevailing white racial attitudes were far more barbaric than they were in the 1960s?&quot;

Others refute this criticism by pointing to the importance of expectations—in Alabama and other states black people could only survive by &quot;knowing their place&quot;; in the North, Black people expected fair treatment. In broader writings on revolution, this has been referred to as the Tocqueville effect or paradox. This criticism also seems to ignore that there were serious/major riots in southern cities like Tampa, Houston, and Jackson (MS) and that the Black populations in northern cities like Detroit were larger than the entire populations of most southern towns and cities. As for why there was no rioting in the 1930s, this was a time of such economic deprivation for so many people of every race, that had there been rioting, it would have likely been of a class nature rather than of a racial nature.

<text>Kennebunk is a town in York County, Maine, United States. The population was 11,536 at the 2020 census. Kennebunk is home to several beaches, the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge, the 1799 Kennebunk Inn, many historic shipbuilders&#x27; homes, the Brick Store Museum and the Nature Conservancy Kennebunk Plains (known locally as the Blueberry Plains), with 1,500 acres (6 km) of nature trails and blueberry fields.

The municipality includes the constituent villages of Kennebunk Village (Town), the Lower Village (Lower Kennebunk), Kennebunk Landing (the Landing), Bartlett Mills, West Kennebunk, Kennebunk Beach, Lords Point, Coopers Corner Crossing, Sea Roads Crossing, Webahennet Grove, and Vinegarhill, Cheshire Commons, Kennebunk Meadows, and various newer neighborhoods. It does not include Kennebunkport, which is a separate town.

==History==

First settled in 1621, the town developed as a trading and, later, shipbuilding until 1918, and shipping center with light manufacturing. It was part of the town of Wells and Arundel until 1820, when it incorporated as a separate town. &quot;Kennebunk, the only village in the world so named,&quot; was featured on a large locally famous sign attached to the Kesslen Shoe Mill on Route One. To the Abenaki peoples, Kennebunk means &quot;the long cut bank,&quot; presumably the long bank behind Kennebunk Beach.

In the 19th century and early 20th century, many industrial concerns were attracted to Mousam River at Kennebunk to provide motive force for their mills. Among the firms to do business there were the Kennebunk Manufacturing Company, the Mousam Manufacturing Company, the Leatheroid Company and the Rogers Fibre Company.

The Lafayette Elm was a tree which was planted to commemorate General Lafayette&#x27;s 1825 visit to Kennebunk. It became famous for its age, size, and survival of the Dutch elm disease that destroyed the hundreds of the other elms that once lined Kennebunk&#x27;s streets. The elm is featured on the town seal.

The restored Kesslen Shoe Mill has been renamed the Lafayette Center. Kennebunk is home to two of the state&#x27;s oldest banks—Ocean Bank (1854) and Kennebunk Savings Bank (1871). Only Saco &amp; Biddeford Savings Institution (1827) and Bangor Savings Bank (1852) are older.

The town&#x27;s archives are located at the local history and art center, the Brick Store Museum, on Main Street.

=== Beaches ===
Kennebunk&#x27;s coastline is divided into three major sections: Mother&#x27;s Beach; Middle Beach or Rocky Beach; and Gooch&#x27;s Beach or Long Beach. Separate from Kennebunk Beach is secluded Parson&#x27;s Beach, a quiet alternative to the summer crowds.

There is some local controversy regarding the &quot;Mother&#x27;s Beach&quot; nickname. According to many local residents, the smaller of the three main beaches—at the intersection of Beach Avenue and Ridge Avenue—is officially Kennebunk Beach or, alternatively, Boothby Beach. The term Boothby Beach was from the mid-1730s when a Mabel Littlefield married Richard Boothby and settled on land near what came to be known as Boothby Beach. The information about the Boothbys was taken from the &quot;Old News From Southern Maine&quot; article on Mable and Richard Boothby, by Sharon Cummins. Many natives today may not remember it being called Boothby Beach, and over the years it came to be known as Kennebunk Beach or Mothers Beach. Older residents also recall the name Dipsy Bath Beach, a reference to the baths once located there. The term Mother&#x27;s Beach didn&#x27;t come into widespread use until the mid-1980s; however, other native residents dispute that date and say they remember it being called &quot;Mothers Beach&quot; as far back as the late 1950s. The name likely evolved due to its small size and generally calmer water, due to the rocks under and above the ocean, thus making it a natural harbor of refuge that is safer for swimming and which makes it popular with mothers keeping a watchful eye on their children. The name is clearly descriptive rather than official, in spite of the recent installation of road signs pointing the way to &quot;Mother&#x27;s Beach&quot;. Contradicting the above beach naming is the town&#x27;s website, which states, &quot;Permits are valid for Gooch’s Beach, Kennebunk Beach (Middle Beach) and Mother’s Beach.&quot;

Additionally, without public parking access, both Libbys and Crescent beaches are in Kennebunk between Parson&#x27;s Beach and Mother&#x27;s Beach.

Day School, Sea Road School, Middle School of the Kennebunks, and Kennebunk High School. The Middle School of the Kennebunks is part of Maine&#x27;s project that gives laptops to all of the 6th, 7th and 8th graders in the school called MLTI, or Maine Learning Technology Initiative.

In 2000, a group of students teamed up with parents and local community members to found The New School, a small alternative high school, with students coming from as close as Kennebunk and Wells and as far away as Portland and Somersworth. The school is accredited by the State of Maine and the first group of students graduated in June 2001. The New School has a focus on community-based learning.

<text>Kennebunkport is a resort town in York County, Maine, United States. The population was 3,629 people at the 2020 census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford metropolitan statistical area.

The town center, the area in and around Dock Square, is located along the Kennebunk River, approximately from the mouth of the river on the Atlantic Ocean. Historically a shipbuilding and fishing village, for well over a century the town has been a popular summer colony and seaside tourist destination. The Dock Square area has a district of souvenir shops, art galleries, schooner attractions, seafood restaurants, and bed and breakfasts. Cape Porpoise, while retaining its identity as a fishing harbor, has a very small village area with several restaurants, a church, grocery store, coffee shop, small library, and art gallery. Kennebunkport has a reputation as a summer haven for the upper class and is one of the wealthiest communities in the state of Maine. The Municipality of Kennebunkport includes the constituent villages of Kennebunkport Village, Cape Arundel &amp; Colony Beach, the Cottage Coast, Wilde&#x27;s District (Wildwood), Goose Rocks Beach, Turbatts Creek, Cape Porpoise Village, North Village Crossing (Townhouse Corner), among various other newer developments. The town is the home of Walker&#x27;s Point, a summer estate of the Bush family.

Kennebunkport and neighboring towns Kennebunk and Arundel comprise school district RSU 21.

The Kennebunkport Christmas Prelude takes place annually in the town, beginning either in late November or early December.

==History==

Archeological evidence exists of activity in the area now known as Cape Porpoise 7000 years ago. In 1602, the time of contact with Europeans, it was occupied by communities of the Almouchiquois people, who referred to the area as Nampscoscock. According to 1640 land records, a sagamore of that community was &quot;Thomas&quot; Chabinock.

Kennebunkport was first incorporated in 1653 as Cape Porpus, subject to the government of the Massachusetts Bay Colony (Maine was admitted to the Union in 1820 as part of the Missouri Compromise). Due to Abenaki Indian resistance to colonial expansion, European settlers abandoned the town by 1689 and did not return for at least ten years. The Wabanaki Confederacy again expelled English from the area from 1703 to 1717, and continued violent resistance to colonization until the end of King George&#x27;s War in 1748.

The town was renamed Arundel in 1701, and the town center located inland at Burbank Hill. &lt;br&gt;
On August 8, 1782 Arundel was under attack by two loyalist vessels: the 16 gun brig &quot;Miriam&quot; [Richard Pomroy] and the schooner &quot;Hammond&quot; [Doty] captured two unanmed vessels from Newbury Massachusetts (a schooner and a sloop). The sloop was burned after it went aground on Goat Island. A battle took place between the vessels and the milita ashore. The Patriot casualties were Captain James Burnham killed in action; civilian Samuel Wildes was wounded when he demanded the Loyalists return the vessels they had taken. In 1821 the town was renamed again, this time to Kennebunkport in reflection to its economy becoming one of shipbuilding and trade along the Kennebunk River.

By the 1870s the town had developed as a popular summer destination, with both hotels and homes constructed along its coastline. Cape Arundel, Cape Porpoise, and Beachwood (now called Goose Rocks) were some of the early summer colonies; although Cape Porpoise was, and still is, a working fishing harbor. Since 1939, Kennebunkport has been home to the Seashore Trolley Museum.

The Great Fires of 1947, which devastated much of York County, affected Kennebunkport and especially the area near Goose Rocks Beach. Much of the housing near Goose Rocks Beach was destroyed by the fire, but the area has since recovered and been rebuilt.

==Geology==
Like much of the northeast coast, the geography of the southern Maine coast was largely directed by the retreat of the Laurentide ice cap about 23,000 years ago. The coast is framed by bedrock, left during the formation of the Appalachian mountains, and the irregular shape of the coast (characteristic of much of the New England coast, with the exception of Cape Cod and the islands) is attributed to differential erosion of the underlying rock layer.

The coast along Kennebunkport differs sharply from the Maine coast north and east of Portland due to differences in the composition of this rock layer. Beyond Portland, the layer is a largely metamorphic rock, but here the coast is a mixture of igneous rock, and embayments of more deeply eroded sedimentary and metamorphic rock. These embayments result in the sandy beaches that can be found in southern Maine (such as Goose Rocks Beach, Colony Beach, and nearby Kennebunk Beach) but are uncommon north of Portland. Likewise, the geology here differs from that of the outer lands (Cape Cod, Nantucket, and Martha&#x27;s Vineyard in Massachusetts, Block Island in Rhode Island, and Long Island in New York), which were formed as terminal and recessional moraines, and do not contain much in the way of a bedrock skeleton.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The town has several distinct areas, each developed during a phase of the town&#x27;s history. The original town center was at Cape Porpoise, which today has a small village center, is both a summer colony and year-round community, and hosts a working fishing harbor. Inland from Cape Porpoise is a mix of forest and agricultural land, punctuated by a historic town center at Burbank Hill (there are a few historic buildings of interest here, including a schoolhouse and jail). Heading west, towards the mouth of the Kennebunk River is Dock Square, the current town center.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Kennebunkport, and especially Cape Arundel (also known as Point Arundel), developed as a summer colony for the wealthy. Traveling from Dock Square along Ocean Avenue is the Cape Arundel Summer Colony Historic District. This district of many well-preserved examples of early-20th-century shingle-style cottages begins at Chick&#x27;s Creek and ends at Walker&#x27;s Point.

====Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge====
The Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge has a significant portion of lands in Kennebunkport, northeast of Cape Porpoise and through Goose Rocks. Within Kennebunkport, much of this protected land is salt-water marsh.

===Climate===
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Kennebunkport has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

==Summer home of the Bush family==

Kennebunkport was also the summer home of former U.S. President George H. W. Bush, father of former U.S. President George W. Bush. First built by Bush&#x27;s maternal grandfather George Herbert Walker, it has been a family home ever since, and has been owned by the Bush family since sometime in the early 1980s. The Bushes&#x27; ancestry is distinct from the Walker family that settled York County, Maine. Some of this family&#x27;s Walker relatives are buried in the Kennebunkport area ancient cemeteries. During his presidency, George H.W. Bush often invited world leaders, from Margaret Thatcher to Mikhail Gorbachev, to Kennebunkport. In 2007, his son George W. Bush invited Vladimir Putin and Nicolas Sarkozy. The Bush compound is on Walkers Point, called Point Vesuvius prior to the Walker family&#x27;s acquisition.

<text>Kittery is a town in York County, Maine, United States, and the oldest incorporated town in Maine. Home to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on Seavey&#x27;s Island, Kittery includes Badger&#x27;s Island, the seaside district of Kittery Point, and part of the Isles of Shoals. The southernmost town in the state, it is a tourist destination known for its many outlet stores.

Kittery is part of the Portland-South Portland-Biddeford metropolitan area. The town&#x27;s population was 10,070 at the 2020 census.

==History==

English settlement around the natural harbor of the Piscataqua River estuary began about 1623. By 1632 the community was protected by Fort William and Mary on today&#x27;s New Hampshire side of the river; in 1689 defensive works that later became Fort McClary in Kittery Point were added on today&#x27;s Maine side to the north.

Kittery was incorporated in 1647, staking a claim as the &quot;oldest incorporated town in Maine.&quot; It was named after the birthplace of a founder, Alexander Shapleigh, from his manor of Kittery Court at Kingswear in Devon, England. Shapleigh arrived in 1635 aboard the ship &quot;Benediction&quot;, which he co-owned with another prominent settler, Captain Francis Champernowne, a cousin of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, lord proprietor of Maine. Together with the Pepperrell family, they established fisheries offshore at the Isles of Shoals, where fish were caught, salted, and exported to Europe. Other pioneers were hunters, trappers, and workers of the region&#x27;s abundant timber. The settlement at the mouth of the Piscataqua River was protected by Fort McClary.

Thomas Spencer, Esquire, immigrant from Gloucestershire, England, is also a notable settler of Kittery with his wife Patience Chadbourne. Their story is included in &quot;The Maine Spencers: a history and genealogy, with mention of many associated families.&#x27;

Kittery originally extended from the Atlantic Ocean inland up the Salmon Falls River, including the present-day towns of Eliot, South Berwick, Berwick, and North Berwick. Located opposite Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the town developed into a center for trade and shipbuilding. In 1652, after the death of Gorges, Maine became part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

Francis Small was a pioneer resident of Kittery, and operated a trading post near the confluence of the Ossipee River and Saco River. Here major Indian trails converged—the Sokokis Trail (now Route 5), the Ossipee Trail (now Route 25), and the Pequawket Trail (now Route 113). The site supported the lucrative fur trade with Indians, but had the risks of living isolated in the wilderness. Small became the largest property owner in the history of Maine, and was known as &quot;the great landowner&quot;.

In 1663, John Josselyn wrote: &quot;Towns there are, are not many in this province. Kittery, situated not far from Passacataway (Portsmouth), is the most populous.&quot;

In late 1694 or early 1695 the enslaved woman Rachel of Kittery, Maine was murdered by her enslaver, Nathaniel Keen in Kittery. During the colonial era in Kittery Parish, which included present-day Kittery, Eliot, Berwick and South Berwick, as many as 500 enslaved people were brought to Kittery Parish and striped of their identities The Maine Historical Society calls Sir William Pepperrell (1696 – 1759) of Kittery &quot;Maine&#x27;s most prolific and infamous slave owner.&quot;

In 1705, during Queen Anne&#x27;s War, tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy raided the town, killing six residents and taking five prisoners.

During the Revolution, the first vessels of the U.S. Navy were constructed on Badger&#x27;s Island, including the USS &quot;Ranger&quot; (1777) commanded by John Paul Jones. The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, the nation&#x27;s first federal navy yard, was established in 1800 on Fernald&#x27;s Island. It connects to the mainland by two bridges. During the Civil War, the facility rebuilt the USS &quot;Constitution&quot;, and built the Civil War USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot;. Seavey&#x27;s Island was annexed and became site of the now defunct Portsmouth Naval Prison.

In 1905, the Treaty of Portsmouth, which formally ended the Russo-Japanese War, was signed at the shipyard.

From 1946 and 1977, when racial discrimination in public accommodations was common, Clayton and Hazel Sinclair operated the Rock Rest summer guest house in Kittery Point providing lodging to Black vacation travelers. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Rock Rest was featured in the 2020 documentary &quot;Driving While Black&quot;, that aired on PBS.

<text>North Berwick is a town in York County, Maine, United States. The town was set off from Berwick in 1831, following South Berwick in 1814.

North Berwick&#x27;s population was 4,978 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area.

==History==

Originally a part of Kittery called Kittery Commons, the area was first settled in 1693 by John Morrell, a Quaker who built a log cabin on Wells Street. It was set off from Kittery in 1713 as part of Berwick, named for Berwick-upon-Tweed on the Anglo-Scottish border. Doughty Falls in the Great Works River provided water power for a sawmill, gristmill and carding mill. After the Revolutionary War, the small mill town grew rapidly. It was set off and incorporated as North Berwick on March 22, 1831. The town was named after Berwick, England.

Development was spurred in 1842 by the arrival of the Portland, Saco &amp; Portsmouth Railroad, joined by the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad in 1873. North Berwick became a railroad hub from which its manufactured goods were shipped, including lumber, shingles, clapboards, wooden boxes, firewood, bricks, carriages, caskets, clocks, stove and shoe polish, toboggans and sleds. Also loaded aboard the boxcars were barrels of apples, blocks of ice cut from frozen ponds, granite from quarries, and tins of corn packed at a canning factory. But the 2 biggest North Berwick businesses during the 19th-century made woolens and farm implements.

In 1834, the Maine Legislature incorporated Lang, Hill &amp; Company to manufacture woolen blankets, called &quot;printing blankets,&quot; at a mill beside the Great Works River. Renamed the North Berwick Company, by 1850 its principal owner was &quot;Friend&quot; William Hill, who trained as a machinist at the Great Falls Manufacturing Company in Somersworth, New Hampshire. The wooden mill was destroyed by fire in 1861 but rebuilt in brick in 1862. It produced blankets for Civil War troops. The factory had 40 looms turning out 1,500 yards of flannel daily, in addition to blankets. In 1955, the North Berwick Company would close. Its landmark Greek Revival building was used as the Parrish Shoes factory in the 1995 movie &quot;Jumanji&quot;, and has since been renovated and adapted as housing.

<text>Bourne ( ) is a town in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 20,452 at the 2020 census.

For geographic and demographic information on specific parts of the town of Bourne, please see the articles on Bourne (CDP), Buzzards Bay, Monument Beach, Pocasset, Sagamore, and Sagamore Beach.

==History==
Bourne was first settled in 1640 by Ezra Perry as a part of the town of Sandwich. Prior to its separation from Sandwich, the area was referred to as West Sandwich. It was officially incorporated in 1884, the last town to be incorporated in Barnstable County. It was named for Jonathan Bourne Sr. (1811–1889), whose ancestor Richard Bourne represented Sandwich in the first Massachusetts General Court and was the first preacher to the Mashpee Wampanoag on Cape Cod. The town lies at the northeast corner of Buzzards Bay and is the site of Aptucxet Trading Post, the nation&#x27;s oldest store. It was founded by the Pilgrims in 1627 at a site halfway between the two rivers which divided Cape Cod from the rest of the state. It was out of this location that the Cape Cod Canal was formed, in order to save time and lives by eliminating the need to sail around the hazardous eastern shores of the Cape. Because of the canal, Bourne is now considered the &quot;first&quot; town on the Cape, as all three bridges (the Bourne, Sagamore and the Cape Cod Canal Railroad Bridge) are located within the town. All of Bourne is on Cape Cod, Buzzards Bay and Sagamore Beach being the villages that are on the mainland side with Buttermilk Bay forming the western edge of the peninsula (cape) and the Bourndale Road forming the northern boundary to the cape.

Bourne is the site of the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, a maritime college located at the southern mouth of the canal on the western shore.

Otis Air National Guard Base is partially located in the town. The Air Force Space Command system PAVE PAWS northeast radar is located within Bourne&#x27;s borders inside Otis Air National Guard Base.

Bourne is home to an archaeological curiosity known as the &quot;Bourne stone&quot;, featuring markings whose origin and significance have not been conclusively established.

President Grover Cleveland owned a summer estate in Bourne Village, Gray Gables, that served as the Summer White House from 1893 to 1896. The building was destroyed in a fire in 1973.

==Geography==
Bourne is located at the western end of Cape Cod, with the Cape Cod Canal cutting across the northern portion of the town. It is bordered by Sandwich to the east, Falmouth to the south, Marion and Wareham to the west, and Plymouth and Cape Cod Bay to the north. The town lies approximately west of Barnstable, south-southeast of Boston, and the same distance east of Providence, Rhode Island. The border with Plymouth and Wareham in Plymouth County constitutes the only landed border between Barnstable County and any other county (the borders with Dukes and Nantucket counties lie in Nantucket Sound). Major localities of Bourne include Bournedale and Buzzards Bay on the west side of the Cape Cod Canal, Sagamore, which straddles the canal, and Bourne village, Monument Beach, Pocasset, and Cataumet on the east side of the canal.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 23.11%, is water.

Bourne&#x27;s geography was formed around its location on Buzzards Bay and the Cape Cod Canal. There are several necks (the local term for a peninsula), including Wings Neck and Scraggy Neck, and islands along the shore, which create several small coves and harbors. There are also several small ponds and rivers, all of which (except the Herring River, which feeds directly into the Canal) feed into Buzzards Bay. The largest of these inlets, Buttermilk Bay, lies along the border with Wareham. Because of the large parcel of land occupied by Otis A.N.G.B. in the eastern part of the town, the majority of settlement is either along the shores of the Canal or along Buzzards Bay. There is also a small neighborhood (South Sagamore) located between the Canal and the northern boundaries of the base. Bourne has a town forest and a small portion of the Shawme-Crowell State Forest, which is located along Otis&#x27;s northern boundary. There are also many beaches along its shores, mostly along Buzzards Bay (although Sagamore Beach lies along Cape Cod Bay).

Bourne&#x27;s chief rival is Wareham High School.

In the fall of 2009, Bournedale Elementary School opened, closing Otis Memorial Elementary and Ella F. Hoxie School.

Bourne High School&#x27;s sports teams have been very successful in the recent past, including state championships in boys&#x27; hockey and girls&#x27; volleyball. State finalists include girls&#x27; volleyball, golf, and boys&#x27; soccer. Conference championships have been won by boys&#x27; tennis, soccer, and football.

A New England Football League team, the South Shore Outlaws, were formerly located in Bourne.

==Transportation==
===Roadways===
The largest highways in Bourne are Massachusetts Route 3, U.S. Route 6, Massachusetts Route 25 and Massachusetts Route 28. Routes 6 and 28 enter the town concurrently from Wareham, bypassing Buzzards Bay to the north. At the Buzzards Bay Rotary, the two routes split. Route 6 goes straight ahead and assumes its old alignment as a four-lane highway along the north side of the Cape Cod Canal, going through the village of Bournedale before becoming the Mid-Cape Highway, a four-lane limited-access highway beginning at the western approach to the Sagamore Bridge. Sandwich Road, the road parallel to Route 6 running along the south side of the canal, was formerly signed as Route 6W. Currently it is an unsigned two-lane state highway that is used as an alternative to Route 6. Sandwich Road becomes Massachusetts Route 6A east of the intersection with Cranberry Highway, a road that acts as a connector between Route 6A and Route 6 eastbound prior to the approach of the Sagamore Bridge. Route 28 splits off at the Buzzards Bay Rotary as a ramp headed to the Bourne Bridge and Route 25. Route 25&#x27;s terminus is just prior to the northern approach of the Bourne Bridge where the highway continues as Route 28 south. At the southern end of the bridge is the Bourne Rotary, where Sandwich Road intersects. Route 28 continues past the rotary as a four-lane divided highway, officially known as McArthur Boulevard. At the Otis Rotary, the intersection with the road leading to the main gate to Otis Air Force Base, Route 28A spurs off and heads towards Woods Hole in Falmouth. It is at this point that the highway goes from being a surface road to a true limited-access highway. Route 3, also known as the Pilgrims Highway, ends at the junction of Route 6, just prior to the Sagamore Bridge. Up until 2006, the intersection was a rotary, which caused daily traffic nightmares during the busy summer tourist season. The rotary was removed in 2007.

===Rail===
The third bridge over the Canal is the Cape Cod Canal Railroad Bridge, a vertical lift bridge. Freight rail service is provided by the Massachusetts Coastal Railroad. The town is part of the MBTA district and is directly served by the seasonal CapeFlyer at Buzzards Bay station and Bourne station.

<text>Brewster is a town in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, United States, Barnstable County being coextensive with Cape Cod. The population of Brewster was 10,318 at the 2020 census.

Initially settled in 1659, the Town of Brewster is named after Elder William Brewster, the religious leader of Plymouth Colony. Brewster is known as the &quot;Sea Captain&#x27;s Town&quot; for its wealth of eighteenth and nineteenth century historic captain&#x27;s homes, including the Cobb House (1799), the current home of the Brewster Historical Society.

Brewster is also notable as the home of Nickerson State Park, a 1,900 acre preserve carved out of the former hunting grounds of the prominent Nickerson Family. The impact of the Nickerson Family can be seen at the Nickerson Mansion, now the home of Ocean Edge Resort. Constructed in 1890, the structure known as Fieldstone Hall was considered one of the most expensive houses built in the country at that time.

The town is a popular summer destination, with the town population increasing to 30,000. It also contains two National Historic Districts: Brewster Old King&#x27;s Highway Historic District and Stony Brook–Factory Village Historic District, both listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Brewster is twinned with the town of Budleigh Salterton in the United Kingdom.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Indigenous settlement in Brewster took place on the north shore of the present-day town, with a Sauguatuckett farming area centered around the contemporary Stony Brook. Individual accounts subdivide the indigenous tribes of pre-contact Cape Cod, but any historians and researches today use the unifying term Nauset. Somewhere around 1,200 indigenous people populated Outer Cape Cod prior to 1617 pandemics, with this number reduced to 500 by 1621. The first permanent colonial settlement in Brewster centered around the Stony Brook area, part of the &quot;Old Comers&quot; or &quot;Purchasers&quot; grant of 1641. The land that now makes up Brewster was purchased in 1653 from Wano and his son Sachemas, leaders of the local Sauguatuckett. By this period, the Sauguatuckett held significant quantities of corn, beans, and squash which were at times for sale to English settlers. Brewster was first officially settled in 1656 as a northeastern parish of the town of Harwich. However, at the turn of the eighteenth century, there were only seventeen known male settlers in what is now Brewster. 

Brewster&#x27;s first settlers came from Sandwich, Plymouth, and Eastham, as well as many arriving directly from England. Throughout the 1700s, there were interspersed agricultural settlements throughout the area now known as Brewster. The Stony Brook gristmill remains as a testament to the early manufacturing activity at this site. In 1709, a public house and store existed, with a congregational church and meeting house first organized in 1700. By 1750, there were around 190 settlers living in the Brewster environs. The remaining indigenous population in Brewster consolidated around the southwestern corner of the town. Settlers and indigenous people alike utilized the abundant cornfields, as well as the natural resources of Cape Cod Bay. Substantial amounts of herring, or alewife, were, and continue to be, found in the Stony Brook area.

=== Nineteenth century ===
Brewster was officially incorporated as its own town in 1803 when the less wealthy citizens of Harwich were upset that the town&#x27;s institutions were all concentrated on Brewster&#x27;s Main Street, now Route 6A, including the town hall and churches. Brewster was named in honor of Elder William Brewster, the first religious leader of the Pilgrims at Plymouth Colony.

By this period, roughly 75% of town inhabitants were involved in shipping and maritime trades. Brewster captains invested an estimated $250,000 on merchant vessels, and a large saltworks was present on the shoreline of Cape Cod Bay during this period. In 1865, Brewster maintained 56 farms, the highest of any town on the Lower Cape aside from Orleans. At this time, Brewster also had the third highest number of cranberry bogs on the Cape, following Harwich and Dennis. Architecturally, Brewster blossomed during this period, with wealthy sea captains and commercial titans constructing Italianate, Greek Revival, and Second Empire homes. The most emblematic structure of this period is Albert Crosby&#x27;s 1888 Crosby Mansion, located on Crosby Lane.

<text>Chatham () is a town in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, United States. Chatham is located at the southeastern tip of Cape Cod and has historically been a fishing community. First settled by the English in 1664, the township was originally called Monomoit based on the indigenous population&#x27;s term for the region. Chatham was incorporated as a town on June 11, 1712, and has become a summer resort area. The population was 6,594 at the 2020 census and can swell to 25,000 during the summer months. There are four villages that comprise the town, those being Chatham (CDP), South Chatham, North Chatham, and West Chatham. Chatham is home to the Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge and the decommissioned Monomoy Point Light, both located on Monomoy Island. A popular attraction is the Chatham Light, which is an operational lighthouse that is operated by the United States Coast Guard.

==History==

Native American tribes who lived in the area before European colonization included the Nauset, specifically the Manomoy or Monomoy people. The expansive lands over which they roamed were known to them as Manamoyik or Monomoit. Explorer Samuel de Champlain landed there in October 1606 at a place he christened &quot;Port Fortuné&quot;, where conflict arose with the Nauset. Twelve years later, another group of Europeans gave it the name &quot;Sutcliffe&#x27;s Inlets&quot;. Neither name stuck, and the location was not permanently occupied by Europeans until English settlers reached Monomoit in 1664. The town was incorporated on June 11, 1712, at which point it was renamed after Chatham, Kent, England. Its territory expanded with the annexation of Strong Island and its vicinity on February 7, 1797.

Located at the &quot;elbow&quot; of Cape Cod, Chatham became a shipping, fishing, and whaling center. It has a considerable number of 18th-century buildings, whose charm helped it develop into a popular summer resort.

Chatham is home to the Chatham Lighthouse, which was established by President Thomas Jefferson in 1808 to protect the ships circling the Cape. The 1808 towers were replaced in 1841 by twin brick towers that were eventually lost to erosion. They were rebuilt in 1877 out of cast iron, across the street from their original location. The northern of the two was moved to Eastham to become the Nauset Light in 1923. Today, the keeper&#x27;s house is home to a Coast Guard station which patrols the waters of the Atlantic and Nantucket Sound from Wellfleet to West Yarmouth. 

The first reforesting project in America took place on Great Hill in 1821 when Selectmen had pine trees and beach grass planted to prevent erosion and to keep sand from blowing over the village.

Although urban sprawl has invaded the Cape, the town of Chatham still boasts a quaint and walkable Main Street, home to numerous family-owned and -operated shops, restaurants, and businesses. During the summer, concerts are held in a gazebo in Late Gould Park on Main Street. The town also hosts the Chatham Anglers baseball team as part of the Cape Cod Baseball League on the peninsula. The League is for collegiate-age players.

Chatham, like much of Cape Cod, suffers from an exodus of young people and young families due to high housing prices and a lack of social and professional opportunities. The majority of homes in Chatham sit empty in the winter months until the summer when second-home owners come to use their summer/vacation homes. Some are used as weekly rentals for tourists. As of June 1, 2023, the average listing price for a home in Chatham was over $1.1 million US dollars.

In summer, Chatham grows to a population of an estimated 30,000, making facilities overcrowded, and there is limited parking in the Main Street Business District. Parking for the beaches is also limited, and the town&#x27;s most popular beach, Lighthouse Beach, has only off-street parking.

==Geography==
The town occupies the southeast corner (the &quot;elbow&quot;) of Cape Cod. The town&#x27;s villages include Chatham proper, Chatham Port, North Chatham, West Chatham, and South Chatham (west of West Chatham). Chatham is bordered by Harwich to the west, Pleasant Bay and Orleans to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and Nantucket Sound to the south. The town is south of Provincetown and east of the Sagamore Bridge, east of Barnstable, and southeast of Boston.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 33.88%, is water.

The mainland portion of the town is typical of Cape Cod, with several ponds, brooks, rivers, harbors, and inlets around the town. The town includes two narrow strips of land that serve as a barrier between the Atlantic and the mainland; the northern of these is the southern part of the Cape Cod National Seashore. There are several islands, including Strong Island, Tern Island (which is a sanctuary), Morris Island, Stage Island, and Monomoy Island, a island south of the corner of the town which is home to the Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge. Erosion has changed the region over the years—for example, an island named Slut&#x27;s Bush once existed until it vanished underwater by the mid-19th century.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Chatham, Massachusetts has a warm-summer, wet year-round, humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;). Dfb climates are characterized by at least one month having an average mean temperature ≤ 32.0 °F (≤ 0.0 °C), at least four months with an average mean temperature ≥ 50.0 °F (≥ 10.0 °C), all months with an average mean temperature ≤ 71.6 °F (≤ 22.0 °C), and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. The average seasonal (Nov-Apr) snowfall total is approximately 30 inches (76 cm). The average snowiest month is February, which corresponds with the annual peak in nor&#x27;easter activity. The plant hardiness zone is 7b, with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 5.2 °F (–14.9 °C).

==Ecology==

The area surrounding Chatham is home to diverse flora and fauna, including many species that rely on the wetlands for survival. The salt marshes and lakes that exist in the region due to glacial action from the last ice age are essential habitats for many species, such as ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) and striped bass (Morone saxatilis). These wetlands not only promote biodiversity but also act as natural filters, retaining particulates and purifying the water that flows into nearby estuaries and bays. However, Chatham&#x27;s beaches have experienced significant vegetation loss in recent decades due to both natural and human causes. Despite this, the beaches remain important nesting sites for various species of sea turtles and shorebirds, such as the Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus), while the waters off the coast are rich in marine life, including seals (Halichoerus grypus), whales, and sharks, such as the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). In fact, the prevalence of sharks in the waters surrounding Chatham has resulted in its reputation as a hub of great white activity and shark attacks. To help protect and preserve the local flora and fauna, several conservation areas and nature preserves have been established in Chatham, including Monomoy Island, which provides an important breeding ground for the Piping Plover.

According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. Potential natural vegetation Types, Chatham, Massachusetts would primarily contain a Northeastern Oak/Pine (&quot;110&quot;) vegetation type with a Southern Mixed Forest (&quot;26&quot;) vegetation form.

==Transportation==
All five roads that exit Chatham cross into Harwich. The two state routes that pass through the town are Route 28 and the southern end of Route 137. Route 28 circles through the center of town before exiting and heading north toward Route 6A, joining that route until the roads end at the Orleans Rotary.

Rail service no longer extends to the town; the former rail bed is a bicycling path and is called the Old Colony Rail Trail. The Old Colony Rail Trail crosses into Chatham and runs through South Chatham and then into West Chatham before ending at Crowell Road near downtown. In addition, another bicycle route passes through the town, starting at the end of the Rail Trail, and providing views of Chatham Fish Pier, Chatham Bars, and Chatham Light.

The town is the home to the Chatham Municipal Airport, which provides local service to other small airports on the Cape and islands. The nearest national and international air service can be reached at Logan International Airport in Boston.

<text>Falmouth ( ) is a town in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 32,517 at the 2020 census, making Falmouth the second-largest municipality on Cape Cod after Barnstable. The terminal for the Steamship Authority ferries to Martha&#x27;s Vineyard is located in the village of Woods Hole in Falmouth. Woods Hole also contains several scientific organizations such as the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), the Woodwell Climate Research Center, NOAA&#x27;s Woods Hole Science Aquarium, and the scientific institutions&#x27; various museums.

For geographic and demographic information on specific parts of the town of Falmouth, please see the articles on East Falmouth, Falmouth Village, North Falmouth, Teaticket, West Falmouth, and Woods Hole. Falmouth also encompasses the villages of Hatchville and Waquoit, which are not census-designated places and fall within the village of East Falmouth based on postal service.

==History==

Falmouth was first settled by English colonists in 1660 and was officially incorporated in 1686. Bartholomew Gosnold named the settlement for Falmouth, Cornwall, England, his home port. Early principal activities were farming, salt works, shipping, whaling, and sheep husbandry, which was very popular due to the introduction of Merino sheep and the beginnings of water-powered mills that could process the wool. In 1837, Falmouth averaged about 50 sheep per square mile.

Falmouth saw brief action in the War of 1812, when the area around Falmouth Heights, on its southern coast, was bombarded by several British frigates and ships of the line, and Massachusetts militia hastily entrenched themselves on the beaches to repulse a possible British landing which never came. By 1872, the train had come to Falmouth and Woods Hole, and some of the first summer homes were established. By the late 19th century, cranberries were being cultivated and strawberries were being raised for the Boston market. Large-scale dairying was tried in the early 20th century in interior regions. After the improvement in highways, and due in part to the heavy use of neighboring Camp Edwards (now part of Joint Base Cape Cod) during World War II, population growth increased significantly. Large homebuilding booms occurred in the 1970s, followed by others in the 1980s and 1990s.

In the late 1800s, after railroad service was established between Boston and Cape Cod, James Madison Beebe bought over and built Highfield Hall, which is now a museum, and much of the land is preserved as Beebe Woods. In 1965, Robert Manry sailed from Falmouth aboard his sailboat and reached Falmouth, Great Britain, 78 days later.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 19.04%, is water. Most of Falmouth, like the rest of Cape Cod, sits on glacial sands composed of glacial outwash deposits. However, the soil in the southwestern part of the town, consisting of moraine deposits, is more rocky and dense, like the rest of New England, and many glacial erratics are scattered about, having been dropped by the retreating glaciers. The climate is temperate marine. There is no exposed bedrock. Rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year and averages per month.

Falmouth lies on the southwestern tip of Cape Cod. It is bordered by Bourne and Sandwich to the north, Mashpee to the east, Vineyard Sound to the south, and Buzzards Bay to the west. At its closest point, Falmouth is approximately from Nonamesset Island, the easternmost island of the town of Gosnold and the Elizabeth Islands. It is approximately north-northwest of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, the closest land to the island. Falmouth is approximately south of the Bourne Bridge, west of Barnstable, and south-southeast of Boston.

Falmouth&#x27;s topography is similar to the rest of Cape Cod&#x27;s, with many small ponds, creeks, and inlets surrounded by the pines and oaks of the Cape and often rocky beachfront. Falmouth&#x27;s southern shore is notable for a series of ponds and rivers spaced very closely together, all of which travel some distance into the town. These include, from west to east, Falmouth Inner Harbor, Little Pond, Great Pond (which leads to the Dexter and Coonamesset rivers), Green Pond, Bourne&#x27;s Pond, Eel Pond (which leads to the Childs River), and Waquoit Bay, which lies along the Mashpee town line. The Buzzards Bay side of the town is primarily bays divided by necks, peninsulas connected to land by isthmi. The largest inlet is Megansett Cove along the Bourne town line. The Buzzards Bay shore of Falmouth is punctuated by a number of hamlets, including, from north to south, Megansett, New Silver Beach, Old Silver, Chappaquoit, Sippewisset, Quissett, and Woods Hole.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Falmouth, Massachusetts has a warm-summer, wet year round, humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;). Dfb climates are characterized by at least one month having an average mean temperature ≤ 32.0 °F (≤ 0.0 °C), at least four months with an average mean temperature ≥ 50.0 °F (≥ 10.0 °C), all months with an average mean temperature ≤ 71.6 °F (≤ 22.0 °C), and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. The average seasonal (Nov–Apr) snowfall total is approximately . The average snowiest month is February, which corresponds with the annual peak in nor&#x27;easter activity. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the plant hardiness zone is 7a, with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of .

==Ecology==

According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. Potential natural vegetation Types, Falmouth, Massachusetts would primarily contain a Northeastern Oak/Pine (&quot;110&quot;) vegetation type with a Southern Mixed Forest (&quot;26&quot;) vegetation form.

==Transportation==
Falmouth&#x27;s main road is Massachusetts Route 28, which runs south from Bourne as a divided highway, then becomes a surface road and heads east through downtown as Main Street, then turns northeast through East Falmouth before crossing into Mashpee. As one of two major east–west routes on the Cape, Route 28 is regularly congested, and there is minimal room for widening opportunities. Route 151 runs east–west through the northern section of the town, connecting North Falmouth and Hatchville with Mashpee.

Falmouth is home to The Woods Hole, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority. Daily ferry service brings tourists, residents and supplies from Woods Hole to Nantucket and Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. It is the main ferry line between the Vineyard and the mainland (as Nantucket is further east, its main line leaves Hyannis). A seasonal ferry, the &quot;Island Queen&quot;, runs from Falmouth Harbor to Martha&#x27;s Vineyard.

The Massachusetts Coastal Railroad provides rail freight service to North Falmouth, where a spur runs into Otis Air Base to serve a trash transfer station. Also, as of a June 25, 2009, capecodonline.com article, the company plans to re-extend passenger railroad service to the town, complete with dinner and tourist trains, though this will also be only to North Falmouth, due to the fact that the other of railroad track had been replaced with the current Shining Sea Bikeway. On November 21, 2009, North Falmouth saw its first passenger train in at least 12 years. The nearest inter-city (Amtrak) passenger rail stations are Providence and Boston&#x27;s South Station. The Middleborough/Lakeville and Kingston/Route 3 stations of the MBTA&#x27;s commuter rail system provide the closest service to Boston.

There is a private air park in East Falmouth, and the nearest national and international air service is at Logan International Airport in Boston and T. F. Green Airport near Providence, both being about equidistant from Falmouth. There is a regional airport in nearby Hyannis.

Falmouth is also served by the Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority bus routes.

== Military installations ==

The installation is of economic and environmental importance.

== Groundwater pollution ==

During the 1970s and 1980s, it was discovered that the groundwater in some areas of Falmouth had been contaminated by toxic chemicals linked to the disposal of jet fuel, solvents, industrial chemicals, and other substances on the Massachusetts Military Reservation, now known as Joint Base Cape Cod. Plumes of groundwater pollution that reached into Falmouth contaminated household well water in some neighborhoods and forced the town to shut down a public well in 1975 that accounted for 25% of the town&#x27;s public water supply. A major report was released on the contamination in 1986. In 1996, the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (now known as the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment) assumed responsibility for the cleanup, treating soils at several sites and installing pumping wells in an effort to contain the plumes of groundwater contamination.

In 2010, the Silent Spring Institute tested about 20 public water supplies, 40 percent of which had detectable levels of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs). In 2015, the Air Force started testing private wells in the Currier Road area after water treatment plant samples showed elevated levels of 1,4-dioxane. Since May 2016, four houses in the Currier Road neighborhood have been receiving bottled water for elevated levels of PFCs after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established a national standard for PFCs, such as PFOS and PFOAs.

It was named in honor of Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans in recognition of France&#x27;s support for the Thirteen Colonies during the American Revolution and because the town did not want an English name, as they had been captured twice by the British during the war.

The town&#x27;s early history revolved around fishing, whaling, and agriculture. As the fishing industry grew, salt works sprang up to help preserve the catches. However, the town&#x27;s growth depleted it of lumber, a situation that did not begin to be remedied until the railroad came and brought lumber from the mainland in the 19th century. The railroad also brought tourism to the town. In 1898, the French Cable Company built a transatlantic telegraph cable to Orleans, which operated from the French Cable Station.

Orleans was shelled by a German submarine in July 1918, during World War I. The town&#x27;s tourism industry was helped in 1961 with the creation of the Cape Cod National Seashore by President John F. Kennedy.

<text>Hans Joachim Pabst von Ohain (14 December 191113 March 1998) was a German physicist, engineer, and the designer of the first aircraft to use a turbojet engine. 
Together with Frank Whittle and Anselm Franz, he has been described as the co-inventor of the turbojet engine. However, the historical timelines show that von Ohain was still a university student when, in January 1930, Whittle filed his first patent for a turbojet engine and successfully tested his first engine in April 1937, some 6 months before von Ohain. Additionally, prior to building his engine and filing his own patent in 1935, von Ohain had read and critiqued Whittle&#x27;s patents. Von Ohain stated in his biography that &quot;My interest in jet propulsion began in the fall of 1933 when I was in my seventh semester at Göttingen University. I didn&#x27;t know that many people before me had the same thought.&quot; Unlike Whittle, von Ohain had the significant advantage of being supported by an aircraft manufacturer, Heinkel, who funded his work.

When in 1935 von Ohain designed his overall engine layout, he based it for compactness on a centrifugal impeller (centrifugal or radial compressor) and a radial inflow turbine.

Ultimately, this configuration had too many shortcomings to be put into production; however, aided by the enormous resources of the Heinkel Aircraft Company, a developed version was sufficient to power the He-178, and on 27 August 1939 von Ohain entered history as the designer of the world&#x27;s first gas turbine to power an aircraft.

Von Ohain stayed with centrifugal designs, contributing his research to Heinkel&#x27;s other projects such as the combined centrifugal/axial HeS8 and 011, but ultimately none of his designs was put into production. Other competing German designers at Junkers and BMW, following the axial design layout, saw their engines brought into production, although they never solved some of the basic power and durability problems. Von Ohain nevertheless started the world&#x27;s first jet engine industry in his homeland of Germany, with many prototypes and series productions built until 1945.

Von Ohain, having entered turbojet design some time later than Whittle, began working on his first turbojet engine designs during the same period that Whittle was building his WU engine in Britain. Their turbojet designs have been said by some to be an example of simultaneous invention. However, von Ohain explains in his biography that, in 1935, while his own patent was being prepared (and before he had begun construction of an engine), his lawyer gave him a copy of Whittle&#x27;s patent, which he read and critiqued. As a result, he was forced to modify his own application so as not to infringe on Whittle&#x27;s design.

The core of Ohain&#x27;s first jet engine, the Heinkel HeS 1, which he described as his &quot;hydrogen test engine,&quot; was run &quot;in March or early April&quot; according to Ohain (although Ernst Heinkel&#x27;s diaries record it as September 1937). 

Work on the hydrogen test engine continued, but the engine required modifications to fix overtemperature problems and to fit a fuel system to enable it to run self-contained on liquid fuel, which was achieved in September 1937. With the heavy backing of Heinkel, Ohain&#x27;s jet engine was the first to power an aircraft, the Heinkel He 178 aircraft in 1939, which was followed by Whittle&#x27;s engine within the Gloster E.28/39 in 1941. 
Turbojet powered fighter aircraft from both Germany and Britain entered operational use virtually simultaneously in July 1944: the Me 262 on July 26 and the Gloster Meteor on July 27 of 1944. The Me 262 was the first operational fighter jet and saw flight combat with hundreds of machines, while the few dozen Meteors saw limited action.

Although Von Ohain and Whittle both knew about axial flow compressors, they remained dedicated to improving centrifugal compressor engines to power respectively the Heinkel He 178 and the Gloster E.28/39 until the end of the Second World War. Axial flow compressor jet engines were instead developed in parallel by Anselm Franz (Junkers) and Hermann Oestrich (BMW) to design the similar Jumo 004 and BMW 003 engines, designs that were eventually adopted by most manufacturers by the 1950s.

After the war the two men met, became friends and received the Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering &quot;for their independent development of the turbojet engine.&quot;

==Early life and jet development==
Born in Dessau, Germany, Ohain finished high school in 1930 at the Arndt-Gymnasium in Dahlem and earned a PhD in physics in 1935 at the University of Göttingen, with his thesis entitled An Interference Light Relay for White Light on an optical microphone to record sound directly to film, which led to his first patent. The University of Göttingen was then one of the major centers for aeronautical research, with Ohain having attended lectures by Ludwig Prandtl. In 1933, while still a student, he conceived what he called &quot;an engine that did not require a propeller&quot;.

After receiving his PhD in 1935, Ohain became the junior assistant of Robert Wichard Pohl, then director of the Physical Institute of the university. In 1936, while working for Pohl, Ohain registered a patent on his version of a jet engine, &quot;Process and Apparatus for Producing Airstreams for Propelling Airplanes&quot;. Unlike Frank Whittle&#x27;s Power Jets WU design with its axial flow turbine, Ohain used a radial in-flow turbine to go with a centrifugal compressor, placing them back-to-back with an annular combustion space wrapped around the rotor.

While working at the university, Ohain used to take his sports car to be serviced at a local garage, Bartles and Becker. There he met an automotive mechanic, Max Hahn, and eventually arranged for him to build a demonstration model of his engine for . The completed model was larger in diameter than Whittle&#x27;s fully working engine of 1937, although much shorter. Ohain took the model to the university for testing but ran into problems with combustion of the petrol fuel, which took place mostly after the turbine, sending flames shooting out from the exhaust duct. The lack of combustion before the turbine contributed to the engine being unable to run without the assistance of the electric motor which subsequently overheated.

According to von Ohain, &quot;My interest in jet engines began in about 1933. I found that the elegance of flying was spoiled by the enormous vibrations and noise from the piston engine/propeller combination. I came to the conclusion that a constant work process, i.e. constant compression, combustion, expansion, would have great advantages. Thus I chose a quite simple engine, a radial compressor with a radial turbine.&quot;

However, the model he and Max Hahn built and tested in the courtyard of the Institute showed the combustion chamber needed further development. As a consequence, Pohl and von Ohain decided to approach Heinkel as someone who &quot;doesn&#x27;t back away from new ideas&quot;.

==Heinkel==
In February 1936, Pohl wrote to Ernst Heinkel, telling him about Ohain&#x27;s design and its possibilities. Heinkel arranged a meeting between his engineers and Ohain, during which he argued that the current &quot;garage engine&quot; would never work, but that the concept upon which it was based was sound. The engineers were convinced, and in April Ohain and Hahn began working for Heinkel at the Marienehe airfield outside Rostock, in Warnemuende.

Working with Engineer Gundermann and Hahn in Special Development, von Ohain states: &quot;Under pressure of aiming to bring a combustion chamber of unknown endurance to flight readiness, I came upon the idea of separating the turbine problem from the combustion chamber problem by using hydrogen fuel. As a physicist, I knew of course that the diffusion and combustion speed of gaseous hydrogen was substantially greater than that of petrol.&quot;

A study of the model&#x27;s airflow resulted in several improvements over a two-month period. Encouraged by these findings, Ohain produced a new prototype that would run on hydrogen gas supplied by an external pressurised source. The resulting Heinkel-Strahltriebwerk 1 (HeS 1), German for Heinkel Jet Engine 1, was built by hand-picking some of the best machinists in the company, much to the chagrin of the shop-floor supervisors. Hahn, meanwhile, worked on the combustion problem, an area in which he had some experience.

The engine was extremely simple, made largely of sheet metal. Construction, by the blacksmith in his village, started late in the summer of 1936 and was completed in March 1937. Two weeks later the engine was running on hydrogen, but the high temperature exhaust led to considerable &quot;burning&quot; of the metal. The tests were otherwise successful, and in September the combustor was replaced and the engine was run on gasoline for the first time. Running on gasoline caused the combustor to clog up. Although the engine was never intended to be a flight-quality design, it proved beyond a doubt that the basic concept was workable, and Ohain had at last caught up with Whittle. With vastly more funding and industry support, Ohain would soon overtake Whittle and forge ahead.

===Unaware of Whittle?===

It has often been claimed that Ohain was unaware of Whittle&#x27;s work. While in a very strict sense this may be true (in that he was unaware of Whittle&#x27;s experiments at Lutterworth where the RAF engineer ran the world&#x27;s first jet engine on the 12th of April 1937), nevertheless Ohain had been given a copy of Whittle&#x27;s patents by his lawyer, while his own patent application being prepared and before he had begun construction of an engine.

In his biography, Ohain frankly critiqued Whittle&#x27;s design:

&quot;When I saw Whittle&#x27;s patent I was almost convinced that it had something to do with boundary layer suction combinations. It had a two-flow, dual entrance flow radial flow compressor that looked monstrous from an engine point of view. Its flow reversal looked to us to be an undesirable thing, but it turned out that it wasn&#x27;t so bad after although it gave some minor instability problems ... Our patent claims had to be narrowed in comparison to Whittle&#x27;s because Whittle showed certain things.&quot; He then somewhat understandably justified their knowledge of Whittle&#x27;s work by saying: &quot;We felt that it looked like a patent of an idea ... We thought that it was not seriously being worked on.&quot;
===Developing the engine===

In February 1937, the turbine section was running on a test stand. According to von Ohain, &quot;We were now working on a machine capable of powering an aircraft, the forerunner of the He-S3B. I had intended to put the combustion chamber between the compressor and the turbine, as we had done with the hydrogen unit, but Hahn suggested putting it ahead of them, which was an excellent idea.&quot; The He-S3 turbine was test flown by Erich Warsitz and Walter Künzel in a Heinkel He 118, providing additional throttled thrust to the conventional engine.

While work on the HeS 1 continued, the Pohl-Ohain team had already moved on to the design of a flight-quality engine, the HeS 3. The major differences were the use of machined compressor and turbine stages, replacing the bent and folded sheet metal, and a re-arrangement of the layout to reduce the cross-sectional area of the engine by placing the annular combustor in an extended gap between the compressor and turbine. The original turbine was too small to work efficiently.

In the beginning of 1939, the He-S3A was fitted into the He 178 airframe for a standing display at Roggentin on 3 July 1939. Yet this turbine was still not powerful enough for flight. According to von Ohain, &quot;We experimented with various combinations to modify the compressor diffuser and turbine nozzle vanes to increase thrust sufficiently to qualify the aircraft for the first flight demonstration. We found that a small diffuser behind the engine with a collar and splitter to divert flows functioned better than a high speed flow through the entire tube. The final result of the changes was the He-S3B.&quot;

A new design, the HeS 3b was proposed, which lengthened the combustor by placing the forward part of it in front of the compressor outer rim. While not as small as the original HeS 3 design, the 3b was nevertheless fairly compact. The 3b first ran in July 1939 (some references say in May), and was air-tested under the Heinkel He 118 dive bomber prototype. The original 3b engine soon burned out, but a second one was nearing completion at about the same time as a new test airframe, the Heinkel He 178, which first flew on 27 August 1939, the first jet-powered aircraft to fly by test pilot Erich Warsitz. Heinkel had applied, May 31, 1939, for a patent: US2256198 Espacenet - Original document, an &#x27;Aircraft power plant&#x27;, inventor Max Hahn. First application for this patent in Germany was May, 1938.


Work started immediately on larger versions, first the HeS 6 which was simply a larger HeS 3b, and then on a new design known as the HeS 8 which once again re-arranged the overall layout. The compressor and turbine were connected with a large-diameter drum long-enough to fit an annular combustion chamber between them. It was intended to install the engine on the Heinkel He 280 fighter, but the airframe development progressed much more smoothly than the engine, and had to be used in gliding tests while work on the engine continued. A flight-quality HeS 8 was installed in late March 1941, followed by the first flight on 2 April. Three days later the aircraft was demonstrated for a party of Nazi and RLM officials, all of whom were impressed. Full development funds soon followed.

By this point there were a number of turbojet developments taking place in Germany. Heinkel was so impressed by the concept that he arranged the transfer to the project of Adolph Müller from Junkers, who was developing an axial compressor-powered design, renamed as the Heinkel HeS 30. Müller left Junkers after they purchased the Junkers Motoren company, who had their own project under way, which by this time was known as the Junkers Jumo 004. Meanwhile, BMW was making good progress with its own design, the BMW 003.

By early 1942 the HeS 8, officially the 109-001 (HeS 001), was still not progressing well. Meanwhile, Müller&#x27;s HeS 30, officially the 109-006 (HeS 006), was developing much more quickly. Both engines were still some time from being ready for production, however, while the 003 and 004 appeared to be ready to go. In early 1942 the director of jet development at the RLM, Helmut Schelp, refused further funding for both designs, and ordered Heinkel to work on a new &quot;pet project&quot; of his own, eventually becoming the Heinkel HeS 011. Although this was the first of Schelp&#x27;s &quot;Class II&quot; engines to start working well, production had still not started when the war ended. Work continued on the HeS 8 for some time, but it was eventually abandoned in the spring of 1943.

===Ultimate outcome===

Part of the challenge for von Ohain was his approach to designing a practical turbojet that could be developed. His primary design comprised a centrifugal compressor with a radial inflow turbine, a design that proved to be impractical and as a result, despite much effort, was never put into production.

By comparison, Whittle&#x27;s centrifugal flow engines, in both straight-through and reverse flow configuration (developed further by Rolls Royce), powered all Allied World War II jets and the majority of immediate post-war fighters. They were built under licence in numerous countries including Australia, France and the US and were copied by the Soviets and Chinese to power the MiG-15 and MiG-17. Whittle&#x27;s basic reverse flow design remains the most common gas turbine configuration in production today with over 80,000 built in the form of the Allison (RR) 250/300 and Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6 series of engines.

However, in his invention of HE S011, von Ohain introduced a standard concept which combined axial and radial designs for most business jets today, along with turboprops and helicopters.

==Post-World War II==
In 1947, Ohain was brought to the United States by Operation Paperclip and went to work for the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. In 1956 he was made the Director of the Air Force Aeronautical Research Laboratory and by 1975 he was the Chief Scientist of the Aero Propulsion Laboratory there.

During his work at Wright-Patterson, Ohain continued his own personal work on various topics. In the early 1960s he did a fair amount of work on the design of gas core reactor rockets which would retain the nuclear fuel while allowing the working mass to be used as exhaust. The engineering needed for this role was also used for a variety of other &quot;down to earth&quot; purposes, including centrifuges and pumps. Ohain would later use the basic mass-flow techniques of these designs to create a fascinating jet engine with no moving parts, in which the airflow through the engine created a stable vortex that acted as the compressor and turbine.

This interest in mass-flow led Ohain to research magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for power generation, noting that the hot gases from a coal-fired plant could be used to extract power from their &quot;speed&quot; when exiting the combustion chamber, remaining hot enough to then power a conventional steam turbine. Thus an MHD generator could extract further power from the coal, and lead to greater efficiencies. Unfortunately this design has proven difficult to build due to a lack of proper materials, namely high-temperature non-magnetic materials that are also able to withstand the chemically active exhaust. Ohain also investigated other power related concepts.

He also invented the idea of the &quot;jet wing&quot;, in which air from the compressor of a jet engine is bled off to large &quot;augmented&quot; vents in the wings to provide lift for VTOL aircraft. A small amount of high-pressure air is blown into a venturi, which in turn sucks a much larger volume of air along with it, thus leading to &quot;thrust augmentation&quot;. The concept was used in the Rockwell XFV-12 experimental aircraft, although the market interest in VTOL aircraft was short-lived. He participated in several other patents.

Ohain was the influence in shifting the mind of Paul Bevilaqua, one of his students at WP-AFB, from math to engineering, which later enabled Bevilaqua to invent the Rolls-Royce LiftSystem for the JSF F35B STOVL: &quot;in school I learned how to move the pieces, and Hans taught me how to play chess&quot;. Ohain also showed Bevilaqua &quot;what those TS-diagrams actually mean&quot;.

Ohain retired from Wright-Patterson in 1979 and took up an associate professor position teaching propulsion and thermodynamics at the nearby University of Dayton, spending winter sessions from 1981 to 1983 teaching the same subjects at the University of Florida. Ohain continued at the University of Dayton until 1992, when concerns about his health prompted a move with his wife, Hanny, to Melbourne, Florida.

==Awards==
During his career, Ohain won many engineering and management awards, including (among others) the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Goddard Astronautics Award, the United States Air Force Exceptional Civilian Service Award, Systems Command Award for Exceptional Civilian Service, the Eugene M. Zuckert Management Award, the Air Force Special Achievement Award, and just before he retired, the Citation of Honor. In 1984–85, Ohain served as the Charles A. Lindbergh Chair in Aerospace History, a competitive senior fellowship at the National Air and Space Museum. In 1991 Ohain and Whittle were jointly awarded the Charles Stark Draper Prize for their work on turbojet engines. Ohain was elected a member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering (NAE).

Ohain was awarded the Ludwig-Prandtl-Ring from the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics) for &quot;outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering&quot; in 1992.

In 1982, Ohain was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

In 1990, Ohain was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame.

==Death==
Ohain died in Melbourne, Florida, in 1998, aged 86. He was survived by his wife and four children. One of his sons, Christopher von Ohain, joined the United States Marine Corps (USMC). Christopher’s son, Hans Christopher von Ohain, also joined the USMC; he was killed in a car accident in 2022.

<text>Sandwich is a town in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, United States and is the oldest town on Cape Cod. The town motto is &quot;Post tot Naufracia Portus&quot;, &quot;after so many shipwrecks, a haven&quot;. The population was 20,259 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Cape Cod was inhabited by American Indians prior to European colonization. Sandwich was occupied by the Eastern Algonquian speaking Wampanoag tribe who aided the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony in the 1620s. The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe still live on Cape Cod and are making efforts to revive the Wampanoag language.

A group of settlers from Saugus, Massachusetts colonized Sandwich in 1637 with the permission of the Plymouth Colony. It is named for the seaport of Sandwich, Kent in England. It was incorporated in 1639 and is the oldest town on Cape Cod, together with Yarmouth. The western portion of the town was separated from the original Town of Sandwich and became the town of Bourne in 1884.


Sandwich was the site of an early Quaker settlement and today hosts the oldest continuous Quaker Meeting in the U.S.

Early industry revolved around agriculture, with fishing and trading also providing for the town. Later, the town grew a small industrial component along the Scusset River and Old Harbor Creek and its tributaries. Today, most of its economy is centered on tourism.
Deming Jarves founded the Boston &amp; Sandwich Glass Factory in 1825. Sandwich had proximity to a shallow harbor, was a possible canal site, and had local supplies of timber to fuel the furnaces. The glass works primarily made lead glass and was known for its use of color. Jarves received several patents for his improvements in glass mold designs and pressing techniques. The factory declined after the Civil War due to competition from Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia companies that produced less expensive pressed soda-lime glass tableware.

The Cape Cod Canal was constructed through the town starting in 1909, opening for travel in 1914. The Canal Generating Plant went online in 1968.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.32%, is water. Sandwich is bordered by Cape Cod Bay to the north, Barnstable to the east, Mashpee and Falmouth to the south, and Bourne to the west. It is approximately south-southeast of Boston.
Sandwich is the site of the Cape Cod Bay entrance to the Cape Cod Canal. The northern point of Sandwich, where Sagamore Hill and Scusset Beach State Reservation lie, is divided from the rest of the town by the canal. The town is also the location of the Shawme-Crowell State Forest and the Massachusetts State Game Farm. The town is home to six beaches along the shores of Cape Cod Bay. The rest of the town&#x27;s geography is typical of the rest of the Cape, with many small ponds and hills, with most of the trees being pine or oak. Sandwich is also the site of Old Harbor Creek, a large inlet with several other small creeks feeding it, which once served to provide a safe harbor for ships.

It is a popular tourist attraction and was elected by National Geographic in July 2010 as one of the top ten boardwalks in the United States. It is 1,350 feet long, from Scorton Creek to the Cape Cod Canal, and crossing the Creek Mill and the marsh. It was created in 1875 by Gustavus Howland, the son of Ellis Howland who built the town hall. In 1991, it was almost completely destroyed by Hurricane Bob. It was rebuilt in 1992, financed through the sale of 1,700 personalized planks with engravings. It was damaged by blizzards in March 2018, but was rebuilt and reopened in June 2018.

<text>Lee is a town in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, United States. It is part of the Pittsfield, Massachusetts, metropolitan statistical area. The population was 5,788 at the 2020 census. Lee, which includes the villages of South and East Lee, is part of the Berkshires resort area.

==History==

Lee occupies land that was originally territory of Mahican Indians. The first non-native settlement in the area was known as Dodgetown as early as 1760. Dodgetown was named after its founding settler, Asahel Dodge, who immigrated to the area from Cape Cod. Lee was incorporated in 1777 from parts of Great Barrington and Washington. It is named after Revolutionary War General Charles Lee. Lee is a former mill town.

In the autumn of 1786 during Shays&#x27; Rebellion, about 250 followers of Daniel Shays encountered state troops commanded by General John Paterson near East Lee. The Shaysites paraded a fake cannon crafted from a yarn beam, and the troops fled.

Early industries included agriculture, lumbering, and lime making. Abundant streams and rivers provided water power for mills that produced textiles and wire. Papermaking became the principal industry in 1806 with the construction of the Willow Mill by Samuel Church in South Lee. The Columbia Mill in central Lee was established in 1827, and eventually became the first to supply 100% groundwood newsprint to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. By 1857, there were 25 paper mills in Lee. The Smith Paper Company discovered how to manufacture paper solely from wood pulp in 1867, and through the 1870s was the country&#x27;s largest producer of paper. The mills previously owned by Smith Paper Company were closed in 2008. Today, Lee has only a single papermaking facility.

The town&#x27;s marble is famous for its quality. The first quarry was established in 1852. In 1867, almost of marble was excavated and shipped on the Housatonic Railroad. Buildings constructed of Lee marble include a wing of the Capitol in Washington, 250 sculptures adorning Philadelphia City Hall, as well as the General Grant National Memorial, and St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral (both in New York City).

The town&#x27;s 19th-century prosperity is still evident in its architecture, including its town hall, library, several churches and private homes. South Lee includes a historic district listed on the &quot;National Register&quot;.

Lee has become a popular tourist destination, noted both for its New England charm and its bed and breakfast establishments. It is known as the &quot;Gateway to The Berkshires&quot; because it provides one of only two exits on the Massachusetts Turnpike that serve the county, and the only one going eastbound.

Arlo Guthrie&#x27;s court appearance before the blind judge and his seeing-eye dog for dumping garbage as described in the song &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; took place in the courtroom at the Lee Town Hall.

Lee was a filming location for &quot;Before and After&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; (1999).

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.22%, is water. Lee is bordered by Lenox to the northwest, Washington to the northeast, Becket to the east, Tyringham in the southeast, Great Barrington to the southwest, and Stockbridge to the west. Lee is south of Pittsfield, west-northwest of Springfield, and west of Boston. 

Lee is in the southern section of the Berkshires, in a valley along the Housatonic River. It is west of October Mountain State Forest, with two sections of the forest in Lee. In the southwestern corner of town lies a portion of Beartown State Forest, where Burgoyne Pass crosses the northern end of the mountain. Hop Brook, a marshy brook which flows from Tyringham, flows into the Housatonic in the south; other bodies of water include Laurel Lake to the north and Goose Pond to the southeast. The Appalachian Trail skirts the eastern part of town, passing through Tyringham, Becket and Washington.

Lee is on Interstate 90 (the Massachusetts Turnpike), and is home to Exit 10, the westernmost full exit on the turnpike (Exit 1, in West Stockbridge, is only a turnaround exit) as well as the first service area along the Pike. Lee is also on U.S. Route 20, the &quot;old Mass Pike&quot;, which was the main route to New York until the interstate. A small section of U.S. Route 7 crosses through the northwestern corner of town before meeting Route 20 in Lenox. Massachusetts Route 102&#x27;s eastern terminus is at Route 20, at the Exit 2 toll plaza.

Lee lies along the Housatonic Railroad line, which travels from Pittsfield to Great Barrington and Sheffield, terminating near at New Milford, Connecticut, near Danbury. The line is still the area&#x27;s primary rail link to New York City&#x27;s metropolitan area, Boston, and Albany. As of 2013 negotiations are underway to restore rail commuter service between the Berkshires and New York City along this route. The town is covered by the Berkshire Regional Transit Authority (BRTA) bus line, which runs between Pittsfield and Great Barrington. Regional bus services make regular daily stops, and maintain year-round schedules through Lee. Peter Pan and Bonanza Bus Lines each make scheduled stops at Town Hall.

Regional air service can be reached at Pittsfield Municipal Airport. The nearest national and international air services can be reached at Albany International Airport in Albany, New York, about away. Bradley International Airport, near Hartford, Connecticut, approximately from Lee, is also a popular option.

== Goose Pond and Laurel Lake ==

Goose Pond and Laurel Lake are two significant bodies of water located in Lee, Massachusetts. Both are popular recreational areas, offering opportunities for boating, fishing, and swimming.

=== Goose Pond ===

Goose Pond is a 263-acre enlarged Great Pond. It is a glacially formed body of water that is long and narrow, stretching over two miles in length but only a quarter-mile at its widest point. The pond is known for its clear, clean water and is home to various species of fish. The pond&#x27;s ability to carry trout from year to year has led to its designation as special brown trout water.

The pond is divided into two parts: the lower larger pond, surrounded by summer homes, and the upper pond, which maintains a more wilderness-like atmosphere. The upper pond lies in the 112-acre Goose Pond Reservation, where it intersects the Appalachian Trail and an Appalachian Mountain Club shelter for hikers is situated on its shore. Goose Pond Reservation is managed by the Massachusetts Trustees of Reservations. The town of Tyringham maintains a boat ramp close by, which serves as the only public access point.

In recent years, Goose Pond has been the site of several notable incidents. In July 2021, a woman drove her car into the pond after taking a wrong turn while following her GPS. The woman escaped unharmed, and the car was later towed from the water. In another incident, a fugitive from Maine was found hiding in the hikers&#x27; shelter near Goose Pond after fleeing from a car accident on Route 90. The man was apprehended without incident after a multi-agency search.

=== Laurel Lake ===

Laurel Lake is a 170-acre body of water that straddles the border between Lee and Lenox. The lake is a popular destination for boating, fishing, and swimming. It is stocked annually with trout by the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife.

Laurel Lake has been facing challenges with invasive species, particularly Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels. Efforts to manage and control these invasive species have been ongoing. The Laurel Lake Association, in partnership with the Town of Lee, has been actively involved in the prevention and management of these invasive species. These efforts include the use of benthic barriers to smother the milfoil and prevent its growth, as well as public education, boat inspections, and boat washing, to prevent the spread of zebra mussels.
