The first settler was Derrick Teunis van Vechten, who built a house here in 1680. The town was established on March 7, 1788, as part of Albany County. When Greene County was formed on March 25, 1800, Catskill became part of the new county. The town was increased by an addition from the town of Woodstock in 1800, but was later decreased upon the formation of the towns of Cairo (1803) and Athens (1815). Catskill is the location of the story &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; by Washington Irving.

On July 23, 2003, an F2 tornado ripped across the town. The worst of the damage occurred at the Kiskatom flats. The tornado crossed over New York Route 32 and went past the Friar Tuck Inn, causing two mobile homes to flip over.

<doc id="259816" wikidata="Q3460728" url="?curid=259816" title="Coxsackie (village), New York">
<text>Coxsackie is a village in Greene County, New York, United States. The population was 2,746 at the 2020 census.

The village name comes from the native word &quot;mak-kachs-hack-ing&quot;. When the land was purchased by the Dutch settlers, the name was written as &quot;Koxhackung&quot;. It is generally translated as &quot;Hoot-owl place&quot; or &quot;place of many owls&quot; from an Algonquin word believed to mean &quot;Place of Owls&quot; or &quot;Owl&#x27;s Hoot&quot;.

The village is in the eastern part of the town of Coxsackie along the Hudson River. The &quot;downstreet,&quot; or downtown area, along Reed Street is home to a Post Office branch, a town Library (Heermance Memorial Library), the main offices of the State Telephone Company (internet and telephone services), National Bank of Coxsackie&#x27;s main branch office, and a growing group of active, small businesses. Reed Street is two blocks long and ends at Riverside Park with panoramic views of the Hudson River. A local developer has recently bought the decaying but historic buildings and warehouses along the river in order to re-develop them for new use.

==History==
The original plot of land was sold by American Indians to Pieter Bronck in 1661 for 150 guilders in beaver pelts.

The lower part of the village was once called &quot;Reeds Landing&quot;. In the late 19th century, this area contained several factories and a steamboat landing, now replaced by a waterfront park. The district was built up around industries that serviced, by way of the Hudson River, New York City to the South and points North. There were several ice houses that harvested ice from the river as well as brick foundries, iron foundries, carriage makers and lumber treating. Warehousing and transport from local farms was also an important industry.

The remains of the steam freighter &quot;Storm King&quot; still rest here, in the river just north of the park, where she sank at her moorings in the 1930s. She is still visible except at the highest tide or during flooding. Near this area in the early 20th century was a popular sandy beach that drew thousands of visitors on summer weekends. The beach eroded away after channelization of the Hudson during the 1930s, when deep water navigation was extended up to Albany.

A ferry service connected the village to Newtons Hook across the river in Columbia County until June 12, 1938.

In 1947, the Coxsackievirus was isolated from an outbreak in upstate New York, and was named after the village, being the location where the outbreak first began.

==Geography==
Coxsackie is located in eastern Greene County on the west bank of the Hudson River. The Hudson is an estuary. Although Coxsackie is from the ocean, tides here range about (the river flows both ways depending on time of day).

New York State Route 385 passes through the village, leading south (downriver) to Athens and to Catskill, and northwest to its terminus at U.S. Route 9W just outside the village limits. US 9W leads north to an interchange with Interstate 87 (the New York State Thruway); via the Thruway it is north to Albany, the state capital, and south to New York City.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and , or 16.31%, is water.

== Historic District ==
Reed Street Historic District is a national historic district located at Coxsackie in Greene County, New York. The district contains 30 contributing buildings. They are a collection of mid-19th century, two and three story commercial buildings. The district displays a uniformity of style in its Italianate style brick facades with ornate brackets and overhanging eaves. Recently, new, independently-owned businesses have opened on Reed Street bringing Coxsackie&#x27;s historic &quot;downstreet&quot; back to life.

<text>Coxsackie ( ) is a town in Greene County, New York, United States. The population in the 2020 census was 8,382, a decrease from the 2010 census. It is the second-largest town in Greene County after Catskill. The name of the town is said to be derived from a Native American term, but it has various translations (&quot;owl&#x27;s hoot&quot; is locally common).

Within the area governed as a town, there is also a village called Coxsackie. The town is in the northeastern part of the county.

The town of Coxsackie is notable for being the namesake of the Coxsackievirus (a type of enterovirus), which was first isolated in this town.

== History ==

The settlement of Coxsackie began in the seventeenth century, in approximately 1652, as part of the development of New Netherland. The government of the area became established as a district in 1772, and Coxsackie was founded in 1788 with a town form of government. Part of Coxsackie was lost when the town of Durham was formed in 1790. Further land was lost in the formation of the newer towns of Cairo and Greenville (1803), New Baltimore (1811), and Athens (1815).

One of the first settlers in Coxsackie was Pieter Bronck, of the same family for which the Bronx is named. In 1663, he built the Pieter Bronck House in West Coxsackie, which is open as a museum. The nearby family burial ground includes a separate plot with marked graves for slaves of the family.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 38.4 square miles (99.4 km2), of which 36.9 square miles (95.6 km2) is land and 1.5 square miles (3.8 km2, or 3.86%) is water.

The eastern town line is defined by the Hudson River and is the border of Columbia County.

The New York State Thruway (Interstate 87) and U.S. Route 9W pass through the town. State Route 385, running north-south through the town, serves the older villages and other areas near the Hudson River. This road earlier served as the majority of the Coxsackie Turnpike.

The first European settlers in this area were German Palatines who came to the colony as religious refugees in 1723. During the French and Indian War, this area suffered fierce attacks by the French with their Indian allies, and the settlers abandoned much of the area. The area of the early town was resettled before 1794, by the granting of land patents.
After the Revolutionary War, the town of Frankfort was established from part of the town of German Flatts. In 1798, the northwest part of Frankfort was taken away to form part of the town of Deerfield.

The Balloon Farm in Frankfort was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.

<doc id="259827" wikidata="Q3134036" url="?curid=259827" title="Herkimer (village), New York">
<text>Herkimer is a village on the north side of the Mohawk River and the county seat of Herkimer County, New York, United States, about southeast of Utica. As of the 2020 Census, it had a population of 7,234, and a predicted population of 7,283 on July 1, 2022. It was part of the Burnetsfield Patent and the first colonial settlement this far west in the Mohawk Valley.

The village takes its name from the Herkimer family, Palatine German immigrants who settled in the area in 1723. The most notable family member was Nicholas Herkimer, a general of the Tryon County militia, who died from wounds received at the Battle of Oriskany in the American Revolutionary War.

The village is located within the town of Herkimer and Herkimer County; together, they are referred to as &quot;the Herkimers&quot;. The citizens of the village are served by three levels of government of the same name - the village, the town, and the county of Herkimer. (Only the residents of the village of Madison and New York County, also in New York, share a similar distinction.)

Herkimer County Community College, located in the northwest part of the village, was founded in 1966 by the Herkimer County Board of Supervisors.

== History ==
=== Colonial era ===
The region had been part of the territory of the Iroquois Mohawk Native American people for centuries. Their villages were linked by winding paths through the wilderness and along the Mohawk River. By the early 18th century, they had two main villages in the Mohawk River Valley, Teantontalago to the east, known by the English as the Lower Mohawk Castle, and Canajoharie to the west, known as the Upper Mohawk Castle. The English built Fort Hunter near the Lower Mohawk Castle.

Palatine Germans first arrived in New York in August 1708, with most arriving in the summer of 1710. Refugees from religious wars in Europe, they had agreed to exchange work for passage to the New York Colony. This was arranged by Queen Anne&#x27;s government, and in 1710, nearly 2,800 Germans arrived in 10 ships at present-day Manhattan. They were at first quarantined on Nutten Island (now known as Governors Island) until the ship fevers ran their course. In exchange, they worked for some time in camps along the Hudson River to manufacture British naval supplies. As early as 1712, some went on upriver to settle along Schoharie Creek in the Mohawk Valley.

In 1722, in response to a request by the German Palatine leaders Joseph Petrie and Conrad Rickert, Governor William Burnet granted the Palatines a lease to purchase land from the Mohawk Nation in the vicinity of the confluence of West Canada Creek and the Mohawk River. After a survey of the land was completed in 1723, many more settlers arrived in the area between 1723 and 1725. They settled on both the north and south sides of the Mohawk River. The area was originally known as &quot;Burnetsfield&quot;, named in honor of the governor. The Burnetsfield Patent, granted April 13, 1725, assigned lots to about 90 heads of family. The area was also referred to at times as &quot;Stone Ridge&quot;, &quot;The Flats&quot;, &quot;The Falls&quot;, and most commonly, due to the mostly German immigrant population and the flat floodplain topography, as German Flatts. This was the first colonial settlement this far west in the Mohawk Valley.

Shortly after 1722, a blockhouse and a church were erected in the village on the north side of the river. This site was later developed as the present Reformed Church. The first known minister was the Reverend George Michael Weiss, who served from 1735 to 1742. A schoolhouse was erected in 1745. Weiss was followed in 1751 by the Elder Rosencrantz, who was succeeded by his son, the Reverend Abraham Rosencrantz, the latter serving until his death in 1796.
During the French and Indian War, the town was twice attacked by the French and their native American allies, in November 1757 (cf. Attack on German Flatts (1757)) and again in April 1758, when the settlement on the south side of the river and Fort Herkimer were attacked, and about 30 settlers were killed. Captain Nicholas Herkimer held the command of the fort, assembling all of the settlers he could within it.

During the Revolutionary War, the town was attacked multiple times by Loyalists and Iroquois allies, as were other German settlements in the valley. One of these raids was by Butler&#x27;s Rangers in September 1778. (&quot;See Attack on German Flatts (1778).&quot;) The village was defended by Fort Dayton.

Fort Herkimer and the settlement on the south side of the river were also attacked. George, Catherine, and Nicholas Demuth were among children captured by the Onondaga during a raid in 1779, while they were playing outside the fort. After the war, during prisoner exchange, George and Catherine returned to the Demuth family. Nicholas, the youngest, had been adopted by an Onondaga chief and become assimilated. He chose to stay with the tribe for the rest of his life. Although he maintained contact with his birth family, he accompanied the Onondaga and lived with them on a reservation outside Syracuse. He married into the tribe and worked as an interpreter and negotiator.

The village of Herkimer was attacked for the last time during the war on July 15, 1782, by about 500 Tories and Iroquois. Two residents were killed, Johann Christian Schell and his son, Denis Augustinius Schell. The rest managed to reach the safety of the fort. About 50 horses were taken and 15 were killed, 180 cattle were taken and 13 killed, and 13 houses and two barns were burned.

=== Village of Herkimer ===

In 1788, the township of Herkimer was organized, and the town had come to be known generally as the &quot;Village of Herkimer&quot;. In 1791, when Herkimer County was organized, the village of Herkimer was established as the county seat. By 1797, the village had a courthouse, a jail, and a Reformed Dutch Church, with about 40 houses and a population around 250. The village was incorporated in 1807. Its charter was amended in 1832 to enlarge the village. In 1875, the village dispensed with its special charter and organized the village under the state law of the time.

In the early 19th century, Herkimer boasted of several whiskey distilleries and an ashery for the making of potash. By the mid- to late 19th century, the village was served by the New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, a branch of which (the Mohawk and Malone Railway) extended north through the Adirondacks to Malone. An inter-urban electric trolley traveled on railways among villages and Little Falls, Syracuse, Richfield Springs, Cooperstown, and Oneonta. The Erie Canal, built from 1817 to 1825, also served villages and towns in the valley, carrying increased traffic and trade between the Great Lakes and the Hudson River and port of New York.

Herkimer native Francis E. Spinner was treasurer of the United States during the Lincoln administration. 
Myers Park now contains a statue of him.

By the late 19th century, the village had a public library. The Folts Mission Institute opened in 1893 as a training school for young women under the auspices of the Women&#x27;s Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1907, a monument was erected by the village to honor General Herkimer.

The Herkimer County shootings took place partially in Herkimer on March 13, 2013.

The Herkimer County Courthouse, Herkimer County Jail, Herkimer County Historical Society, The Reformed Church, Palatine German Frame House, and United States Post Office are all listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2000, the United States Congress designated the historic route of the Erie Canal, which runs through Herkimer village, as the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor. The villages, towns and landscape are all included in this designation as elements contributing to its significance.
==Geography==

The village of Herkimer is located at coordinates (43.026207, -74.990304), in central New York state, roughly halfway between Syracuse and Albany and southeast of Utica. It is served by exit 30 on the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90). New York State Route 5 (State Street) and New York State Route 28 (Don Reile Boulevard/South Caroline Street/Mohawk Street) intersect and combine for a short distance within the village. The village is in the southern part of the town of Herkimer and has a total area of , of which , or 4.27%, is covered by water.

Herkimer is at the confluence of the Mohawk River and its tributary, West Canada Creek. The Plantation Island State Wildlife Management Area, consisting of round of Mohawk River floodplain, lies on the opposite shore of West Canada Creek just southeast of the village. A smaller wildlife management area, providing access and parking for fishing on the creek, is just northeast of the village, along Shells Bush Road, across the Donald J. Mitchell Bridge from State Route 28.

=== Geological information ===
The Herkimer/Middleville area is a favorite collecting area for rockhounds due to its vast deposits of large, low-inclusion quartz crystals known as &quot;Herkimer diamonds&quot;, similar to &quot;Cape May diamonds&quot;. Although the minerals are not true diamonds, they are sometimes used as gemstones and incorporated into jewelry. The minerals formed in Cambrian-age limestone and dolomite, probably from groundwater action after the original formation of the rock in an ancient sea. According to locals, recovering a crystal still partly embedded in a chunk of its host rock is considered lucky.

Several commercial mines cater to tourists. They can break up rock or screen soil weathered from it to find the quartz. The quartz itself is resistant to weathering.

Johan Jost Herchheimer, a farmer who also engaged in trade and transport on the Mohawk River, settled in the German Flatts District of Albany County in 1725, on the south side of the Mohawk River, within the present-day town of German Flatts, incorporated in 1788. He owned of the land, including a strategic portage around Little Falls on the Mohawk, where his eldest son Nicholas Herkimer established a farmstead. In 1788, the town of Herkimer, on the north side of the river, was incorporated and named after him.

During the French and Indian War, the Mohawk Valley was ravaged by raids of the French and their native allies. By 1770, Nicholas had established great wealth through farming and trade during the wars, and had also gained military experience as a captain of a militia. He would later fight in the Battle of Oriskany.

<text>Little Falls is a city in Herkimer County, New York, United States. The population was 4,605 at the time of the 2020 census, which is the second-smallest city population in the state, ahead of only the city of Sherrill. The city is built on both sides of the Mohawk River, at a point at which rapids had impeded travel upriver. Transportation through the valley was improved by construction of the Erie Canal, completed in 1825 and connecting the Great Lakes with the Hudson River.

The city is located at the northeastern corner of the town of Little Falls and is east of Utica.

Little Falls has a picturesque location on the slope of a narrow and rocky defile, through which the Mohawk River falls in less than a mile (1.6 km), forming a number of cascades.

==History==
Little Falls was first settled by Europeans around 1723, when German Palatines were granted land under the Burnetsfield Patent. It was then the westernmost European settlement in the colony of New York. The need to portage around the falls promoted a trading location on the site of the future city. It was the first settlement in the town. The settlers were attacked during the French and Indian War, but rebuilt their farms.

The small settlement here was destroyed by Iroquois Indians, mostly Mohawk, and Tories in June 1782. The village was not resettled until 1790, and it was known at times as &quot;Rockton&quot; and &quot;Rock City.&quot; Little Falls was incorporated as a village in 1811, and reincorporated in 1827. The City of Little Falls was chartered in 1895.
The Western Inland Canal (early attempt of the Erie Canal) was constructed in 1792 and helped the local economy. The Erie Canal, completed in 1825, passes through the city. Lock 17 of the New York State Erie Canal replaced the three locks of the original 1825 Erie Canal and is in height.

With dairy farms located throughout the town, Little Falls was a major center for the manufacturing of cheese in the third quarter of the 19th century. Its products were shipped to market in New York City and other major cities. In the 20th century it attracted immigrants from eastern and southern Europe, who worked in factories for textiles, gloves and other products.

In 1900, 10,381 people lived in Little Falls. It had its peak of population in 1920 with 13,029. Increasing urbanization of larger cities and the decline of manufacturing in the Mohawk Valley in mid-century have led to a decline in population.

In 1903, a westbound New York Central special newspaper train derailed due to excessive speed on a sharp curve killing the engine crew. In 1940, a much more serious crash at the same location of a fifteen car luxury passenger train killed 31.

In October 1912, workers at two textile mills in the city went on strike following a decrease in pay. The strike, led by the Industrial Workers of the World, lasted into the following year and saw a violent confrontation between strikers and police.

<text>Cape Vincent is a village in Jefferson County, New York, United States. The population was 726 at the 2010 census. The village is in the west-central part of the town of Cape Vincent and is northwest of Watertown.

== History ==
The area was formerly controlled by the Onondaga people. French missionaries and explorers passed through the area in the middle of the 17th century.

The town of Cape Vincent was originally part of the town of Lyme. In 1849 the town of Cape Vincent separated from Lyme. The village of Cape Vincent was incorporated in 1853. At the time of its incorporation the village had a population of 1,218.

By the end of the 19th century, the area was becoming a vacation land due to the nearby Thousand Islands.

The Levi Anthony Building, Aubertine Building, John Borland House, Broadway Historic District, James Buckley House, E. K. Burnham House, Duvillard Mill, First Presbyterian Society of Cape Vincent, Fort Haldimand Site, Jean Philippe Galband du Fort House, Glen Building, Vincent LeRay House, Lewis House, Roxy Hotel, Cornelius Sacket House, General Sacket House, St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, St. Vincent of Paul Catholic Church, and Otis Starkey House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Cape Vincent has a total area of , of which , or 3.31%, are water. The village is on the south bank of the St. Lawrence River. A seasonal ferry connects the village to Point Alexandria on Wolfe Island in Ontario, Canada, from Cape Vincent across the southern channel of the St. Lawrence.

New York State Route 12E passes through the village center, leading northeast (downstream) along the St. Lawrence to Clayton and southeast to Watertown, the Jefferson county seat.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 760 people, 348 households, and 209 families residing in the village. There is one local bank (Citizens&#x27; Bank of Cape Vincent), a small museum, a post office (ZIP 13618), an independent telephone exchange and a few small stores.

The population density was . There were 502 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 98.68% White, 0.13% Black or African American, 0.13% Asian, and 1.05% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.53% of the population.

There were 348 households, out of which 24.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 43.7% were married couples living together, 12.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 39.7% were non-families. 35.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 20.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.16 and the average family size was 2.77.

In the village, the population was spread out, with 22.2% under the age of 18, 5.8% from 18 to 24, 23.7% from 25 to 44, 24.1% from 45 to 64, and 24.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43 years. For every 100 females, there were 83.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 81.8 males.

The median income for a household in the village was $31,833, and the median income for a family was $38,571. Males had a median income of $31,538 versus $23,125 for females. The per capita income for the village was $17,492. About 12.7% of families and 16.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.3% of those under age 18 and 14.1% of those age 65 or over.

== Transportation ==
New York State Route 12E passes through the village.
The privately owned Horne&#x27;s Ferry, the only international ferry in the region, runs from May to October to Cape Vincent from &quot;Horne&#x27;s Point&quot; (Point Alexandria) on Wolfe Island, Ontario, Canada, in the Thousand Islands. The capacity is about twelve cars. The family-owned ferry has been running since 1802 when they were first licensed to operate between Wolfe Island and Cape Vincent (as well as Wolfe Island and Kingston, Ontario). The cost was US$15 for one car and driver.

Another ferry on the opposite side of Wolfe Island runs year-round free of charge and completed the crossing between Marysville and Kingston. The total time for both ferry crossings was a little over an hour.

Beginning in April 1852, the Cape Vincent branch of the Rome, Watertown &amp; Ogdensburg Railroad (RW&amp;O) conveyed both passengers and freight between the waterfront and Watertown (and on to Rome) via Chaumont and Brownville. The Watertown-Cape Vincent branch was a vital link from the southern part of the state to the ferry terminal to Canada. However, its importance was reduced with the company&#x27;s acquisition of the Utica &amp; Black River Railroad (with its depot in Clayton) in 1886. By 1891 the railroad became a subsidiary of the New York Central Railroad. In 1895, a storm blew down the Cape Vincent station building, killing two inside.

From the early part of the 20th century onward, traffic decreased until the New York Central ended its passenger service to the village in March 1936, after which, Clayton, to the east, became the main launch point for rail to ferry connections. Freight operations closed in the early 1950s. The second and final station building, having served its original purpose for over 40 years, still stands on the waterfront; it now functions as the offices of Anchor Marina.

==Education==
The school district is the Thousand Islands Central School District.

==History==
The area was originally inhabited by Algonquian tribes, but they were driven out by the Iroquois. Radiocarbon dating of a nearby dig site indicated Clayton was once home to a 2-3 long house, 180 person palisade ringed habitation, &quot;circa&quot; 1470.

The community was formerly called &quot;French Creek&quot; and &quot;Cornelia&quot;. By 1853, the population was 426. Clayton incorporated as a village, by vote of its citizens, in 1872. The arrival of the railroad in 1873 marked a major turning point in the local tourist industry.

The Clayton Historic District and Capt. Simon Johnston House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

To the west is French Creek Bay where French Creek enters the St. Lawrence. Opposite the village in the St. Lawrence is Grindstone Island, one of the large islands of the Thousand Islands.

New York State Route 12 intersects New York State Route 12E in the village. NY-12 leads south to Watertown, the Jefferson county seat, and northeast parallel to the St. Lawrence River to Alexandria Bay. NY-12E leads southwest along the St. Lawrence to Cape Vincent.

==Demographics==

==Transportation==

Clayton is accessible by automobile via New York State Route 12, which turns east from its northward course in the village. The northern terminus of Route 12E is in the same location. From Interstate 81, it can be reached by taking Exit 50S to Route 12.

Beginning in 1873, the village was served by the Clayton Division of the Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad (RW&amp;O), which later became a part of the New York Central network. At its peak, multiple express trains per day ran from Niagara Falls and Grand Central Terminal to bring passengers and freight to Clayton&#x27;s ferry terminal, which was the gateway to the Thousand Islands region. Facilities included a train yard and locomotive shed. The New York Central passenger trains included direct sleeping car service.

Passenger service to Utica ceased in 1950, with bus service to Watertown remaining. Freight service continued until 1972, after which the tracks were torn out.

The station and ferry terminal were converted into Frink Park, a public venue for performances and mooring for visiting ships, while the rail yards were incorporated into the property of the Frink-America snowplow factory, which was demolished in 2010. The property has since been redeveloped into a hotel, which was finished in 2013. The remainder of the right-of-way within the village is maintained as the Sissy Danforth Rivergate Trail, a multi-use recreational trail maintained by the Thousand Islands Land Trust and the Rivergate Wheelers ATV club.

==Education==
The school district is the Thousand Islands Central School District.

<text>Ellisburg is an incorporated town in Jefferson County, New York. The population was 3,352 at the time of the 2020 census. The town is in the southwestern corner of the county and is south of Watertown. Ellisburg is named after early European-American landowners. Among the villages in the town is Ellisburg.

== History ==
This was long the territory of various cultures of indigenous peoples. Prehistoric remains show evidence of indigenous occupation for thousands of years prior to European encounter. The St. Lawrence Iroquoians had villages along the upper St. Lawrence River from the 1300s into the late 1500s. Along the southern areas of the Great Lakes, the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy controlled territory from present-day New York into Pennsylvania and Ohio and south into Virginia. In historic times the Onondaga people were concentrated in this area. The Five Nations together identified as the &quot;Haudenosaunee.&quot;

In the mid-19th century, E.G. Squier conducted a survey of ancient Native American works for the Smithsonian Institution, publishing drawings, plans, and maps. He found evidence of Iroquois longhouses and burial grounds in this area, as well as numerous artifacts and remnants of what were believed to be defensive Iroquois fortifications along Sandy Creek from the early eighteenth century, for protection against French colonists and First Nations.

Samuel de Champlain and other French explorers and missionaries visited the area of the present-day town in the 17th century. After the French established a colony in New France (Quebec), their traders did business with numerous Iroquois villages, primarily those of the Onondaga and especially the Mohawk peoples. Later these peoples primarily traded with Dutch and English colonists in present-day New York, from Albany west along the Mohawk River. Most of the Iroquois nations allied with the British during the American Revolutionary War. As a result of Great Britain&#x27;s defeat in the American Revolutionary War and cession of its territories in the Thirteen Colonies, the United States forced the Iroquois to cede most of their territory in present-day New York. The Crown compensated the nations by setting up land reserves in Upper Canada (now Ontario). There were already Mohawk-dominated villages along the St. Lawrence River in Quebec, near Montreal and upriver, which had started near Jesuit missions.

Following the war, New York State made five million acres of former Iroquois land available for public purchase; land speculators bought large tracts of land for development. They envisioned the rise of villages and farms. As part of such postwar land speculation, Alexander Macomb bought thousands of acres in Macomb&#x27;s Purchase. Thousands of migrants from New England flooded into upstate and western New York in the postwar years, and the area also attracted immigrants from the British Isles and France. Marvel and Lyman Ellis purchased the town land from Macomb&#x27;s Purchase and first settled around 1797 near what became Ellisburg village. Originally the name was spelled &quot;Ellisburgh&quot;.

The town was organized in 1803 from the town of Mexico (now in Oswego County) before the formation of Jefferson County.

When President Thomas Jefferson established an embargo against trade with Great Britain in 1807 prior to the War of 1812, it adversely affected the thriving trade among the towns in upstate New York and Canada. In the tiny village of nearby Sackets Harbor on Lake Ontario, the US Navy built and operated a major shipyard employing 3,000 workers during the war; they completed 12 warships to be used for the battles on the Great Lakes and were critical to the US being able to fight against the British there. Thousands more military assigned to the Army and Navy were stationed at Sackets Harbor. By the fall of 1814, the village had become the third-largest population center in the entire state, after Albany and New York. In 1814 during the War of 1812, Americans defeated a British invasion force at the Battle of Big Sandy Creek in Ellisburg.

Settlers and developers had expected upstate New York to thrive due to trade with Canada, but this was severely interrupted by the war. Following the war, major changes followed the construction and opening of the Erie Canal in 1824 through the Mohawk River Valley and it drew development westward. It opened transportation and connection with the Midwest and Great Lakes communities, which could send their produce and commodities to New York City. Towns of Jefferson County generally were bypassed by such western development, resulting in many of their young people migrating west to Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin from the mid-nineteenth century.

Watertown, New York, however, developed as a major industrial city at the turn of the twentieth century. Its paper and other factories were powered by the Black River. The industrial wealth generated by such manufacturing resulted in the city having one of the highest numbers of millionaires per capita in the early 20th century.

The community of Belleville incorporated as a village in 1860. The community of Mannsville was incorporated as a village in 1879. Ellisburg village was incorporated in 1895. In 1930, Belleville abandoned its status as a village.

<text>Theresa is a town in Jefferson County, New York, United States. The population was 2,648 at the 2020 census, down from 2,905 in 2010. The town is named after Theresa La Ray, the daughter of an original landowner.

The town of Theresa contains a village also named Theresa. The town and village are in the northern part of the county, north-northeast of Watertown.

== History ==
The history of Theresa begins with the Native American cultures who lived in the area as early as 841 B.C. The first of the Native tribes to inhabit the town of Theresa was a group called the Meadowood Phase, who were early Woodland Indians according to the categorization of Dr. William A. Ritchie. This tribe is believed to be part of the early Adena culture and subsisted on hunting and gathering. Evidence of the tribe existing in the area was found at Muskellunge and Red lakes with finds of weapon points, nets, sinkers, and other various tools from needles to a beaver tooth wood scraper. Later, the Iroquois used the Theresa area as a hunting and fishing ground. Evidence supports that at one point the Iroquois had villages in the surrounding area and used the waterways of Theresa for trade and travel.

The first Europeans to stay in the town were not settlers, but smugglers using the waterways for business. The Indian River was a highway for trade and boat traffic, the obstruction of the high falls notwithstanding. The falls made it necessary for travelers to unload and carry merchandise from the upper to lower level. Smugglers, normally having no time to spare, required the use of two flat-bottom boats. Travelers in less of a hurry also carried their boats to the lower level, but smugglers used a second boat and abandoned the first boat. Many early pioneers found and had free use of the abandoned boats in the early settlement of the town.

The settling of Theresa began January 4, 1800, when David Nelson bought of land from the Antwerp Land Company. LeRay then subdivided the land for the purposes of settlement and development. By 1810-11 LeRay had erected mills at the falls and brought cattle to graze, but settlement was stunted by the War of 1812. After the war, development continued, and in 1814 LeRay had a bridge built across the river. A year later a dam and mill were built just under the bridge. In 1817, the Shurtliff and Ball families were the first to purchase lots in the town. A year previous to this President Monroe had the Military Road built for frontier protection that connected Theresa and most of the surrounding towns, which helped lead to more settlers coming to the North Country. Following the building of the road the first taverns were built at West Corners and Chaufty&#x27;s Corners. LeRay had a gristmill and a tavern built to stimulate the sale of land.

The improvements made by LeRay and others did much to stimulate the growth of the town. Over the next few years new businesses started to arrive. Within two years of the improvements made by LeRay, Theresa had its first blacksmith shop, brick maker, merchant, and physician. The first school house was built on Sand Hill in 1821. The school was used for a meeting hall more than a school, and a few of the denominations of Christianity used it for a temporary church. The first cemetery was a piece of land donated and laid out by LeRay. The first mail route was a weekly mail delivered on horseback beginning some time in the 1820s. In 1831, a tri-weekly mail run was established. Eighteen years later the first telegraph office was set up, mostly through the efforts of David Berup.

In 1841, the town of Theresa was organized into a separate township from the town of Alexandria, which it had been previously part of. The village of Theresa was incorporated in 1871. In 1859, the first of Theresa&#x27;s great fires took place. The fire destroyed two houses (one was the first house built in Theresa), three sawmills, one wood-working shop, one iron-working machine shop, and a gristmill. The bridge was also destroyed. Despite the fire in 1859, the town of Theresa was one of the most popular manufacturing and trading hubs in the North Country, even without a railway. The first railway to run through Theresa was the Black River and Morristown Railroad in 1872. In the 1880s, Theresa continued its growth with a population increase of around 1,200 people, and with this new and higher population the businesses grew larger. By this time ordinary precautions were taken to prevent disaster, but nothing was being done to guard against fire. In 1890, the second of the great fires took place. This fire swept through the business district of the town, destroying almost every business in Theresa. The total loss of property was 150,000 dollars with only about 100,000 in insurance. The fire destroyed 40 buildings, but this was somewhat good because it led to the building of more modern and attractive buildings. The fire also gave cause to build a town hall with businesses in the bottom and the upper floor being used for meetings and entertainment. The revenue from the businesses provided enough money for the town to build a village and fire hall and a fire department with some of the best equipment of the day.

In later years the town started to focus on infrastructure, political, and recreational needs. In 1896, the Theresa Town Board appointed William Cheeseman the first attendance officer for schools outside the village because of the education laws of 1894. The first library in Theresa was created in 1900. The Town Board rented some lower rooms in the town hall to the Theresa Library Association for one dollar a year. In 1901 the town ordered the building of an iron bridge at Hanson Crossing to replace the failing bridge at the site. Theresa established the Board of Town Fire Commissioners in 1931 and established the Town Fire District, which encompassed the entire town. Six years later the first U.S. Standard Voting Machines were purchased for the town and the election districts redrawn. As of 1980, both the voting machines and the districts were still being used by the town. In 1975, Theresa received a grant from the E.J. Noble Foundation for a little less than $31,000 and was the first town in the state to receive such a grant. Then in 1976, a skating rink and warming house were built using funds from the Comprehensive Employment Training Act, Theresa Rotary Club, and the Village and Town of Theresa. Two years later the town purchased of land to construct a park which would contain the skating rink and then include a tennis and basketball court and other &quot;unforeseen&quot; facilities.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 6.96%, are water.

== Notable people of Theresa==
One of the most notable people of Theresa was the famous highwayman Black Bart. He was born near Moon Lake as either Charles E. Boles or C.E. Bolton. When he was able to strike out on his own he moved to Illinois to join the Union Army during the Civil War. From there he set off to Hannibal, Missouri, where he allegedly left behind a wife and then from there to San Francisco to make a name for himself. While in California Bart began to dine with stagecoach drivers and learned all the movements they made. For eight years he was the &quot;Scourge of Wells Fargo&quot; and committed twenty-seven successful robberies. Bart&#x27;s downfall was a botched robbery November 3, 1883, when in the commotion he lost a magnifying glass, fieldglass case and a handkerchief that would ultimately lead to his arrest. Bart spent the next four years in San Quentin State Prison for robbery and was released January 23, 1888. After being released Bart vanished and was never seen again. Some people believe that he was paid off by Wells Fargo to stop him from hitting any more coaches, but his disappearance is a mystery.

Another notable figure from the town was a man named Jim Biggers who was a town character and local mystery man. Not much is known about the origin of Biggers. He was a wandering man sleeping where he could find a cave, barn, or tree big enough to support him. The people of town generally liked Biggers and would give him handouts of food and clothing, which he would take gratefully. In the winter he would be seen with multiple pairs of pants and shirts to help him keep warm. Biggers was very wise in the ways of mathematics. He would help anyone with any problem they had and seemed to know the answers by heart. Biggers generally knew the news from the town and world, so shopkeepers would keep an open chair for him to get the information of the day. Biggers also always knew when the big shows were coming to Watertown and would walk all day to see the performances. In his declining years he was taken to a country home until his death.

Roswell P. Flower, born in Theresa in 1835, graduated from Theresa High School and went on to serve as assistant postmaster of Watertown, N.Y. 1854-1860, a Congressman representing New York in the 47th, 51st and 52nd Congresses, and Governor of New York from 1891 until 1895. The Presbyterian Church in Theresa has a plaque and dedication for the Flower family.

Nicholas Doxtater Yost, related by marriage to Governor Flower, traveled from Johnstown, New York, to the Parker Settlement, now called Theresa in 1837, purchased land and settled down. Nicholas&#x27; son George, who become a prominent citizen, built a house that survived the great fires of Theresa. The most prominent Yost descendant was United Nations Ambassador Charles W. Yost.

Born in Theresa, Roscoe Drummond (1902–1983) was a political journalist known for his long association with &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; and a widely syndicated column, &quot;State of the Nation&quot;, that he wrote for more than 50 years,

<text>Watertown is a town in Jefferson County, New York, United States. The population was 5,913 at the 2020 census. The town is located in the central part of the county and borders the city of Watertown to the south, east, and west. As the city has a population of 24,685, or four times the town&#x27;s population, references to &quot;Watertown, New York&quot;, usually apply to the city rather than the town.

==History==

Numerous sites of aboriginal habitation were found by early surveyors of this region. The region was later part of Macomb&#x27;s Purchase.

Watertown was established as a town on March 14, 1800, from Mexico before the formation of Jefferson County, while still in Oneida County. The towns of Rutland (1802) and Hounsfield (1806) were soon formed from parts of Watertown.

The town was first settled in 1800 around the time of the first permanent US military presence in the region, which was established at nearby Sackets Harbor to guard the international border and to fight smuggling in the St. Lawrence region.

In 1816, the community of Watertown set itself off from the town by incorporating as a village. It became a city in 1869.

The John Losee House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

Interstate 81 passes through the western part of the town. U.S. Route 11 is a north–south highway running parallel to I-81 through the town. New York State Route 3, New York State Route 12, New York State Route 12F, New York State Route 126, and New York State Route 232 are east–west highways through Watertown. Many of these highways converge in the city of Watertown.

<text>Watertown is a city in and the county seat of Jefferson County, New York, United States. It is approximately south of the Thousand Islands, along the Black River, about east of where it flows into Lake Ontario. The city is bordered by the town of Watertown to the south, east, and west, and is served by the Watertown International Airport and the &quot;Watertown Daily Times&quot; newspaper. In the middle of Watertown lies the Public Square Historic District, which was built in 1805 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1984. Watertown is located southwest of the U.S. Army base at Fort Drum; it is the service and shopping destination for personnel there and their families. As of the 2020 United States census, the city has 24,685 residents, making it the largest city in the North Country.

The area was first surveyed in 1795, and was settled in March 1800 due to the abundant hydropower the Black River provided. The city was designated as the county seat of Jefferson County when it was split off from Oneida County in 1805. Watertown was incorporated as a village in 1816, and became a city in 1869. By then, it was booming as an industrial center for Upstate New York. By the early 20th century the city was said to have more millionaires per capita than any other city in the nation. During the mid 1960s, Chicago attracted many of the younger residents from the area along with their businesses, leading to the demolition of many historic buildings and a steady decline in population. By 2000, the city had lost over 7,000 residents.

The city serves as the commercial and financial center for the North Country. Located from the Canadian border, shopping by Canadian visitors is important to Watertown&#x27;s economy. The city also receives numerous tourists and summer residents. Watertown, South Dakota, was named in the city&#x27;s honor.
== History ==
=== Etymology ===
Watertown got its name from straddling the Black River. It is unknown which settler chose it, but it is commonly believed to have been a consensus choice in order to attract mills. By 1850, mills manufacturing different products, powered by the Black river, were being built throughout Watertown.

=== Precolonial and colonial eras ===

In 1791, New York City resident Alexander Macomb purchased the land of Jefferson, Lewis, St. Lawrence and Oswego county. He sent out multiple surveyors to sell the land to passing settlers. The area of Watertown was first surveyed in 1796 by Benjamin Wright, who was employed by Macomb to survey the northern and central portions of New York State. Wright made the following statement about the land after returning:

In 1798, pioneers Hart Massey, Henry Coffeen, and Zachariah Butterfield built cabins in what is now the Public Square area as part of a large migration into New York from New England after the Revolutionary War. The land was very uneven territory and was leveled out in one of the first landfill projects in the United States. The area was taken from the nearby town of Mexico in 1800.

Coffeen then moved his family into Watertown. He and the other pioneers chose the area due to the Black River, which flowed west into Lake Ontario about away. Their vision was for an industrial center that would draw power from the river. In 1805, settlers cleared the center of town to create Public Square. During the 19th century, several significant buildings were built around it. The area has been designated as a historic district, listed on the . Watertown was designated as the seat of Jefferson County after it was split from Oneida County. At that time, Watertown was one of the least populated places in the county.

Watertown was incorporated as a village in 1816. In 1869, it reincorporated as a city.

Due to its proximity to Lake Ontario, Watertown became a popular location for transporting supplies into Canada, which helped its economy. As industry and businesses flourished, successful residents built substantial retail buildings, churches, and private residences close to the square. After the Embargo Act of 1807 was passed which prohibited trade with Britain and France, which at the time included Canada. The economy suffered as a result and eventually led to smuggling materials into Canada, leading to the War of 1812. During the Civil War, the 35th New York Infantry Regiment began in Watertown.

The Paddock Arcade, built in 1850 according to European and US models, is the oldest continuously operating enclosed mall in the United States. It is also listed on the National Register, as are several mansions and churches, such as the Emma Flower Taylor Mansion and the Trinity Episcopal Church. The drops in the Black at Watertown&#x27;s location— in the center of town, and over —provided abundant water power for early industry.

By the mid-19th century, entrepreneurs had built paper mills and major industries, including one to manufacture the first portable steam engine in 1847. In the late 1840s Watertown saw an influx in population from Irish migration into the area during the famine. In 1849 a fire began in the public square that destroyed most of the surrounding buildings. In 1851, the city was joined to Albany, Syracuse, and Rochester as well as other major cities of the state with the Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad. Other mills were added to the business base, generating revenue to support the city&#x27;s early public works projects, such as the water system and illuminating gas works in 1853, and a telephone system in 1879.

Watertown claims that Rodman native Frank W. Woolworth conceived the idea of his eponymous mercantile chain while working here in 1878. Woolworth, then employed as a clerk in Moore&#x27;s Store, set up a successful clearance display of low-priced items. This led to his idea of a store specializing in fixed-price, cut-rate merchandise. Woolworth left Watertown and opened his first store in 1879 in Utica. Among the many manufacturing businesses was the Davis Sewing Machine Company, which originated in Watertown. It was the predecessor to George P. Huffman&#x27;s Huffy Corporation, now a maker of bicycles and other sporting goods.

In the late 1890s, many new factories and industries were established, increasing the population by over 17,000 in the span of 30 years. The city gained a reputation for gambling and prostitution. Watertown also developed an educated professional class of doctors and lawyers. The economic center of the country kept moving west following the development of the frontier and a shift of population into the Midwest. In 1920, the city adopted a city manager-style of government.

After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, many stores shut down and laid off a considerable amount of their workforce, leading to economic hardships until World War II, when Watertown&#x27;s industries switched from consumer products to war materiel, revitalizing the economy.

=== Contemporary history ===
Little Trees were developed in Watertown in 1951; the Car-Freshner Corporation headquarters and manufacturing plant is located in the city. In the 1960s and 1970s, Watertown began a large de-industrialization which destroyed many historic buildings, such as the Hotel Woodruff and old courthouse. Watertown suffered economic and population declines. As Chicago boomed, it attracted many of the younger people from upstate New York for its business and professional opportunities. By the 1980s, unemployment in the area was up 20 percent.

In the 21st century, the city serves as a hub for a large rural area. In 2006, the city began a $7.4 million project that restored multiple buildings as well as fixing roads and walkways. The city completed this project in 2008, although more fixes are planned. In early 2019, Watertown was named &quot;The Least Politically Prejudiced Place in America&quot; by Amanda Ripley.

== Geography ==
Watertown is around north of Syracuse, south of the Thousand Islands and northwest of New York City. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and (3.45 percent) is water. Before the area was settled, all the land was rough and forested. Elevation was also a problem. The Black River, flowing westward through the city toward Lake Ontario, is a world-renowned kayaking destination. Competition-level kayaking events, such as the Blackwater Challenge, have been held on the river.

=== Climate ===
Watertown has a humid continental climate or hemiboreal climate(Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;), with cold, snowy winters and an atypical autumn maximum precipitation regime, this being far more common in areas on the west coasts of landmasses (this may be the result of Lake Ontario located to the west of Watertown, thus providing a &quot;west coast&quot;). Unless otherwise noted, all figures cited below are from the GHCN station located closer to downtown.

Winters can be very cold: temperatures remain at or below the freezing mark on an average of 54 days annually, and fall to or below on an average 20 nights. Moreover, Watertown is located in plant hardiness zone 4b, which means that the temperature is likely to drop below at least once a year.
Summers are mild to warm, and temperatures of or above on average occur on only 3.1 days annually. Record temperatures range from a low of on December 29, 1933, up to highs of on July 20 and 27, 1894, although those at the airport have dropped as low as on January 16, 1994.

Precipitation averages , and is distributed fairly uniformly throughout the year, with slightly more during autumn and slightly less during spring and late winter. Since Watertown is situated near the eastern edge of Lake Ontario, it receives much lake-effect snow, averaging of snowfall in the winter.

Because the city is located from the Canada–United States border via the Thousand Islands Bridge, shopping by Canadian visitors is an important part of the local economy. In the 1980s, unemployment in the area was up 20 percent, and property values rapidly decreased. After Fort Drum was established, Watertown&#x27;s industry shifted from industrial to consumer products.

=== Industry ===
The city contains Factory Square, of factories that were once powered by the Black River. In the 1880s and 1890s, many new factories were established, which began an economic boom. In 1900 3,760 workers were employed in the factories. Immediately adjacent to the factories and river was a prominent saloon district, which became a common location for scams, and the &quot;Watertown Daily Times&quot; often referenced workers being scammed by &quot;tinhorn gamblers and short-card men&quot;.

In fall 2019, the city began a revitalization program for Sewall&#x27;s Island and Factory Square in hopes of attracting new investments, businesses, and identifying transformational projects in the area. The city was awarded a Strategic Planning and Feasibility Studies grant from the New York Department of State to pay for the plan.

These extended to the formation of a fire department, the construction of water works and regulation of streets. In 1816, the first village election was held, at which Timothy Burr was chosen President. Sixteen years later, the village trustees were empowered by an act of the Legislature to borrow up to $2,000 ($ in modern dollars) to improve the fire department. In 1835 legislation authorized the construction of a market. In 1852, the boundaries of the village were extended and two wards added, making seven total.

=== Transportation ===
Watertown was the nexus of the Rome, Watertown &amp; Ogdensburg Railroad, which was later absorbed into the New York Central Railroad (NYC) network. Watertown sat at the junction of five different lines, as trains from Syracuse, Rome, Oswego, and Utica passed through Watertown on their way to points along the St. Lawrence River (principally, Ogdensburg and Massena) and to Canada. The Watertown passenger station, situated along the Black River behind Public Square at what is now J.B. Wise Place, was described as among the finest in the system. With the decline in travel by rail after World War II, however, the last named passenger train with a sleeper section to the town was the &quot;Iroquois&quot; in 1961; the train carrying sleepers south from Watertown was the &quot;Fifth Avenue / Cleveland Limited,&quot; also ending in 1961. Passenger service to Watertown finally ended in 1964. The station itself was demolished and replaced with a parking lot. Although the rail network is greatly attenuated compared to its peak in the early 20th century, CSX Transportation still transports freight by rail through Watertown.

Interstate 81 runs through the Watertown area. It is a north-south route that runs from near Dandridge, Tennessee north to Hill Island, Ontario, connecting via the Thousand Islands Bridge and a short connecting road to Highway 401 across the Canada–US border.

NY 3 heads east into Watertown, overlapping with both US 11 and NY 12 through downtown prior to leaving the city to the northeast to head through the Adirondacks to Plattsburgh.

New York State Route 12 is a north-south route through the city, extending northward to Clayton then following the St. Lawrence Seaway to Morristown. A spur, NY 12E, takes a slightly-longer path through Cape Vincent before rejoining NY 12.

New York State Route 12F is a spur connecting NY 12 in downtown Watertown to New York State Route 180 near the Watertown International Airport in Dexter.

Adirondack Trailways serves both Syracuse, to the south, and Potsdam, to the east, on its U.S. Route 11 run. CitiBus also serves Watertown.

<text>Croghan is a village in Lewis County, New York, United States. Its population was 618 at the 2010 census.

The village is situated mainly in the southern part of the town of Croghan, with a small part in New Bremen. The town and the village were both named after George Croghan, a soldier in the War of 1812.

The village slogan, which reflects Croghan&#x27;s proximity to the Adirondack Mountains, is &quot;In the Foothills of the Adirondacks&quot;.

==History==

The village was once a booming region for the lumber industry. During the late 19th century, one particularly influential member of the local community was millionaire lumber baron Theodore B. Basselin, whose estate sat on the corner of Main Street and Bank Street. His mansion remains there to this day. Basselin is buried in a private family plot along Main Street, next to the village library, which once served as the opera house.

Croghan survived two major fires in the early 1900s, the first of which claimed the lives of two small children. The fire started next to where Stumps Tavern now sits along Main and Mechanic and engulfed most of the village, even burning down the massive Catholic church and divinity school.

The village was a center of the pure maple syrup industry before a microburst in the mid-1990s which brought extremely high winds, destroying many of the older, larger trees.

Croghan is popular with avid outdoorsmen from throughout the country who visit the area in the summer for fishing and camping, in the fall for hunting, and in the winter for sledding.

<text>Croghan is a town in Lewis County, New York, United States. The population was 3,093 at the 2010 census. The town is in the northern part of the county and located northeast of the county seat, Lowville. The town contains a village also named Croghan, a small part of which is located in the adjacent town of New Bremen. Both the village and town are locally pronounced \Krō-gun\ (with a hard g and silent h, emphasis on the first syllable).

== History ==
The southwestern part of the town was the locale of an ill-fated colony of refugees from the French Revolution. The settlements were disbanded by 1814. Modern settlement began &quot;circa&quot; 1830.

The town was formed in 1841 from the towns of Watson and Diana. In 1848, part of the town was used to help form New Bremen.

Theodore B. Basselin played a large part in Croghan&#x27;s history. Mr. Basselin came to America and settled in Croghan, where he became the town&#x27;s first millionaire due to his successful logging business. He was one of the town&#x27;s top employers in his day.

The beautiful Basselin mansion still stands in downtown Croghan. Basselin was responsible for a few other landmarks in the town. The Croghan Library that was once the Basselin Opera House stands down the road from the Basselin mansion.

Also next to the library is the Basselin Cemetery. The American Maple Museum, which is located next to St. Stephen&#x27;s church, was originally the Father Leo Memorial School. The school was built from the funds of the Basselin estate.

The Croghan Island Mill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.

== 1912 fire ==
The second great Croghan fire occurred on May 1, 1912. The fire caused considerable damage to the downtown business district of the village. 32 buildings were destroyed by the flames, with the total damage estimated to have been about $600,000.

Two children, who lived in the building where the fire started, died. The fire was so large that assistance had to be provided by the Lowville Fire Department, who sent a train into town with supplies and men.

The fire had its origin in a backyard bonfire which accidentally made its way into the Grounert Café building where two children of the family were trapped in the smoke-filled building. The children were eventually rescued from the blaze, but both died almost immediately afterwards.

The firefighters, who were excited by the rescue, underestimated the danger of the fire to spread to nearby structures. Most of the buildings at the time were wooden structures, which allowed the fire to spread quickly from building to building. The spreading happened so quickly that firefighters were driven from the hydrants with no time to shut them off. This weakened the water pressure significantly, which later handicapped the effort to stop the blaze.

The fire had crossed the street, setting both sides ablaze. 32 buildings were destroyed, including the post office, a general store, Peter Shinbourne&#x27;s Shoe factory, William Ritz&#x27;s Café, Raymond Lee&#x27;s five and ten cent store, Norman Martin&#x27;s hotel and many people&#x27;s homes.

On the other side of the street, Monett&#x27;s store, many more homes, the Town Hall, Honsicker&#x27;s Meat Market, S.E. Simon&#x27;s Drug Store, and Marilley&#x27;s General Store were also destroyed. Marilley&#x27;s Store alone lost an estimated $50,000 in damages. The Town Hall and Opera House had both been recently remodeled at large expense.

The local fire department realized that they needed assistance and made a call for help to Lowville. A train was sent with a chemical engine, of hose and a company of fifteen firemen. Much of the hose was lost because it could not be disconnected from the hydrants in time.

The Farney &amp; Steiner and Virkler feed and grist mills were destroyed along with much value in machinery. One of the mill owners lost about $200,000. The fire was eventually stopped after firefighters concentrated their efforts.

The fire ended just short of St. Stephen&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church. The Franciscan monastery with the large school building connected with it was also saved. On the opposite side of the street the blaze stopped at the Basselin Mansion, both of which still stand there today.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 182.1 square miles (471.5 km2), of which 179.4 square miles (464.7 km2) are land and 2.7 square miles (6.9 km2) (1.46%) are water.

The western town line consists partly of the border of Jefferson County, and the eastern town line is the border of Herkimer County.

The Black River defines the western town line. The Indian River flows from the northwestern part of the town. The Beaver River flows through the southern part of Croghan.

<text>Lowville is a town in Lewis County, New York, United States. The population was 4,888 at the 2020 census, down from 4,982 in 2010. The town is near the center of the county and is southeast of the city of Watertown. The town of Lowville contains a village also named Lowville, which is the county seat. The town is named after Nicholas Low, an early landowner. Low was of Dutch descent, and had emigrated with his wife and three small children from a rural village outside Amsterdam in 1778. Despite popular folk etymology, the name Lowville has nothing to do with its low elevation or the lowing cattle of the many nearby dairy farms.

==History==
Settled in 1798 by a company from Westfield, Massachusetts, the town was formed in 1800 from the town of Mexico in Oswego County. In 1803, part of Lowville was used to form the town of Harrisburg. The village of Lowville was incorporated in 1854 and was designated the county seat in 1864, succeeding Martinsburg.
Daniel Kelley, along with his six sons, settled in Lowville in 1798, moving from Middletown, Connecticut. With the help of others, Daniel put up a sawmill and a two-story house. One son, Datus, worked in the mill. In 1867, Datus&#x27; daughter Emeline (Kelley) Huntington wrote: &quot;By a little brook which comes down from the long hills which rise almost like mountains on either side of the Black River, stands the same old mill where Father ground the wheat and corn for the country people. Its wheel is dripping and clattering still, doing duty as faithfully as of old. While the old miller who &#x27;picked the stones and calked the gate&#x27; when the mill was new, has laid away his earthly casket in the little burying ground far away from the roar of the water which is constantly pouring over the mill dam.&quot;

In 1810 Datus married Sara Dean and moved to Rockport, Ohio. Datus and Sara then bought Kelleys Island in Lake Erie (Ohio) and founded the community called Kelley&#x27;s Island.

Agriculture and dairy farming flourished in the Lowville area because of the rich soil on the Black River Flats. With the opening of the Black River Canal in 1851, the Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad in 1867, and the Lowville and Beaver Railroad in 1906, industries flourished, including QubicaAMF (largest manufacturer of bowling pins in the world) and Kraft (the largest cream cheese plant in the country).

Dedicated in 2006, the Maple Ridge Wind Farm is one of the largest wind farms in the United States. The site has 195 wind turbines, with a total capacity of 320MW (equivalent to a mid-sized power plant). Maple Ridge (formerly Flat Rock Wind Farm) provides about $10 million in benefit to the local community, with about $2 million in annual payments to 75 landowners, and $8 million in tax revenues to the region. This site has increased New York&#x27;s renewable energy generation by sixfold. The project is jointly owned by Iberdrola Renewables and EDP Renewables North America (formerly Horizon Wind Energy).

<doc id="259858" wikidata="Q3461311" url="?curid=259858" title="Avon (village), New York">
<text>Avon is a village in the town of Avon, Livingston County, New York, United States. The village population was 3,394 at the 2010 census, out of 7,146 people in the entire town. The village and town are named after the River Avon in England.

== History ==
Avon was founded by European Americans along the Genesee River, across from the historic Seneca village known as Conawagus (in a transliterated spelling; also spelled as Ca-noh-wa-gas, Conewaugus, or Canawaugus, and as &quot;Ga:non&#x27;wagês&quot; in the Seneca language). The Seneca were among the original Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy and had occupied this territory for many hundreds of years prior to European encounter.

The Seneca village was located on the east side of the Genesee River, &quot;about a mile above the ford&quot;. &quot;Ga:non&#x27;wagês&quot; was an important village to the Seneca during the eighteenth century. Their religious leader Handsome Lake was born here about 1735. One of his nephews, later known as Governor Blacksnake, moved here with his family shortly after his birth. He was an important war chief who allied with the British during the Revolutionary War; later he became one of the first Native Americans to publish his memoirs, aided by a fellow Seneca who translated them into English. An edited version of this memoir was published in 2005, with explanations of material about his people. The leader Cornplanter, a maternal uncle of Chainbreaker, was born in this village around 1750.

European-American (white) settlers did not reach any number until about 1785, after the Americans had gained independence in the Revolutionary War and forced the Iroquois nations who had been allied with the British to cede their lands in the region. Many of these new settlers were from New England and eastern New York. They organized the town in 1789 as &quot;Hartford&quot;, and changed the name in 1808 to &quot;Avon&quot;.

In the early 19th century, the village was noted as a spa and resort destination because of its nearby mineral springs. The village was incorporated in 1858. The Avon station on the Erie Railroad opened in 1865; railroads had superseded the Erie and related canals as the chief means of transportation of freight and passengers in the state. Avon was known historically in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for harness racing at the Avon Driving Park.

The Aaron Barber Memorial Building, Avon Inn, First Methodist Episcopal Church of Avon, Hall&#x27;s Opera Block, and J. Francis Kellogg House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Avon () is a town in Livingston County, New York, United States. It is south of Rochester. The town population was 7,146 at the 2010 census. 
The town was named after Avon, Connecticut, a town in Hartford County.
The village of Avon is in the northwest part of the town.

== History ==
The area around and including what would become Avon village was inhabited for millennia by Paleo-Indians and later by the Seneca people, the westernmost tribe of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois). After the Iroquois title to the land was extinguished in 1788 with the Phelps and Gorham Purchase, white and Black settlement of the area began. In 1789, Dr. Timothy Hosmer, Maj. Isaiah Thompson, William Wadsworth, and others from Hartford, Connecticut, purchased a tract east of the Genesee River and named it &quot;Hartford&quot; after their homeland. The town was organized in 1797. The town&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Avon&quot; in 1808 to avoid confusion with another Hartford in Washington County, New York. In 1818, part of the town was removed to form the new town of Rush. County lines shifted as well, Avon and Rush both being part of Ontario County until the formation of Livingston County and Monroe County in 1821.

The first permanent white settlers of Avon village were Gilbert and Maria (Wemple) Berry in 1789, who operated a tavern and a rope ferry on the east bank of the Genesee River. When Gilbert died in 1797, Maria Berry continued serving travelers in the inn until about 1812. The town&#x27;s first gristmill was built by Capt. John Ganson in northwest Avon in 1789 and the first sawmill in 1797 on the Conesus Outlet built by Dr. Hosmer.

Mineral springs were an important resource of the early town. Beginning in the 1820s, people became interested in water as a therapy for all sorts of maladies, and mineral waters in particular for their reputed health benefits and even as cures. Avon, redolent in natural springs, soon became extremely popular with the afflicted. The wealthy, too, seeking relaxation and leisure, flocked to the town from far and wide. Numerous hotels and spas sprang up to take advantage of this fad, and bottling companies packaged the mineral water for sale. By the late 1890s to early 1900s, most of the hotels that had not closed due to the decline of the spa era had succumbed to fire or were soon razed. The Avon Inn is the only spa structure still standing in the town.

Points of historic interest in Avon include:

* The Avon Five Arch Bridge, a remnant of a railroad bridge over the Conesus Outlet at Littleville. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.
* The Avon Inn, added to the National Register in 1991.
*The Avon Erie Railroad Station, now a restaurant
* The Barber–Mulligan Farm, added to the National Register in 1980.
*Charlton Farm, a residence designed by J. Foster Warner and now a bed and breakfast
*Erie-Lackawanna Railroad bridge over the Genesee River, which connects Avon to the Genesee Valley Greenway, a rail trail.
*First Presbyterian Church of Avon, constructed in 1812 and added to the National Register in 2005.
* Tom Wahl&#x27;s, a fast food restaurant chain which has its origin in Avon as a tiny ice cream shop called the Twin Kiss.

<text>Caledonia is a town in Livingston County, New York, United States. The population was 4,154 at the 2020 census. The town contains the village of Caledonia. The town is in the northwestern part of the county and is southwest of Rochester. It is part of the Rochester metropolitan area.

== History ==
The Seneca people long occupied much of present-day western New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio. They had a village in this area called &quot;Canawaugus&quot; (or Conawagus); it was located on the west side of the Genesee River. The site has since been absorbed by the town of Caledonia. Chief Cornplanter was born here around 1750 into the Wolf clan of his Seneca mother. His father was a Dutch fur trader, John Abeel, whose family had been established in Albany. Cornplanter was known as a statesman as well as a war chief, and he was influential in inviting Quakers to teach Seneca children on his land.

The first European-American settlements did not take place until around the 1790s, after the Revolutionary War. The Seneca, as allies of the defeated British, were forced to give up most of their land to the United States. The first known permanent white settlement began in 1797. The town of Caledonia was established in 1803 as the &quot;Town of Southampton,&quot; having previously been known as &quot;Northampton.&quot; Settlers from Scotland renamed it &quot;Caledonia&quot;, the Latin name for Scotland, in 1806.

Part of the territory of the town was used to form the town of Bellona in 1812; its name was changed to Le Roy (Genesee County) in 1813. As the population increased, in 1819, another part of Caledonia was removed to form part of the town of York. The town of Wheatland (Monroe County) was formed from Caledonia in 1821.

<text>Lima is a village in the town of Lima, Livingston County, New York, United States. The population of Lima village was 2,139 at the 2010 census, out of 4,305 in the entire town.

== History ==

The village was founded in 1788 by Paul Davison and Jonathan Gould, veterans of the Sullivan Campaign, who had seen the area during the American Revolution. The village of Lima was organized in 1797 as the &quot;Village of Charleston&quot;, but in 1808 the name was changed to &quot;Lima&quot;, after Old Lyme, Connecticut. (For that reason, the name of the village is currently pronounced like the name of the bean, not like the name of the city in Peru).

The Genesee Wesleyan Seminary (1830) / Genesee College (1849) was one of the first co-educational schools in the country when it opened in 1822. Eventually, determined by a Methodist-Episcopal convention in 1870, the college was shut in favor of the newly developed Syracuse University (1871), over the protests of the residents of Lima.

<text>Livonia is a village in the town of Livonia, Livingston County, New York, United States. U.S. Route 20A and Route 15 intersect in the village. The population was 1,409 at the 2010 census, out of 7,809 in the entire town.

==Geography==
Livonia is located in northeastern Livingston County at (42.820009, -77.668176), slightly west of the geographic center of the town of Livonia. Unincorporated Livonia Center is to the east, and Lakeville, another unincorporated hamlet in the town, is to the west on Route 20A. Geneseo, the Livingston county seat, is to the west, and Rochester is to the north.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land. Wilkins Creek, a tributary of Conesus Lake to the west, flows across the southwestern part of the village, and Little Conesus Creek rises in the northern part of the village. The entire village is within the Genesee River watershed.

== History ==
The region was the territory for centuries of the Seneca people, one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois confederacy. They named the lake &quot;Ga-ne-a-sos&quot;, meaning &quot;Berry Place&quot;. It was transliterated into English as &quot;Conesus.&quot;

Solomon Woodruff, a native of Connecticut, settled here in 1789 as the first European American in the area, following the American Revolutionary War. The British ceded their territory to the United States without consulting with the Iroquois nations. Many of the Iroquois Native Americans were forced violently from the state, and settled primarily on a major reserve in Ontario.

The Seneca had to contend with Yankee settlers encroaching on their lands. Woodruff built a rough cabin, cleared a field, and planted his first crop of potatoes before returning to Connecticut for his family. He returned by oxcart with his wife to find that the Seneca had burned the cabin to the ground. (Their son died on the journey and was buried on a hilltop in Bristol, New York.) Woodruff rebuilt the cabin, and some of his descendants still reside in the area. He was buried in the Union cemetery.

The town developed between Conesus and Hemlock lakes, and was largely settled in the mid-19th century by ethnic European Americans from New England and New York. The construction of a railway line in the 1850s to Lakeville increased business opportunities and travel through the region.

The Livonia Baptist Church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

<text>Livonia is a town in Livingston County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town population was 7,809. The town contains a village also named Livonia. The town is on the eastern border of the county.

In the 19th century numerous migrants moved from here to the Midwest. A group settled in Michigan, naming their community Livonia.

==History==

The region was historically occupied by the Seneca people, one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois confederacy. The Seneca inhabited the area well into the 19th century, although many were forced out after the British ceded this territory to the United States following the Revolutionary War. Pioneer Samuel Brownstone conducted violence against the Seneca and other Iroquois peoples in western New York. The Seneca had named the major lake as &quot;Ga-ne-a-sos&quot;, meaning &quot;Berry Place&quot;. It was transliterated into English and is known as Conesus Lake.

The town developed between Conesus and Hemlock lakes. The first European-American settler was Solomon Woodruff in 1789. The area is known for abundant native berries. The town of Livonia was established in 1808 from the town of Richmond (then the &quot;Town of Pittstown&quot; in Ontario County). In 1819, part of Livonia was taken to form the new town of Conesus.

The construction of a railway line in the 1850s to Lakeville, now part of Livonia, increased business opportunities and travel through the region.

The city of Livonia, Michigan is named for Livonia, New York.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 6.85%, are water.

The east town line is the border of Ontario County. Most of Conesus Lake is in the western part of town; Hemlock Lake is in the south part of the town, both lakes being part of the Finger Lakes. The outlets of the lakes are at their north ends. Conesus Lake drains out via Conesus Creek at the hamlet of Lakeville, while Hemlock Lake drains via Hemlock Creek, which flows north past the hamlet of Hemlock then turns northeast to join Honeoye Creek in Ontario County. Both lakes are part of the Genesee River watershed.

U.S. Route 20A crosses the town from east to west. New York State Route 15 and New York State Route 15A are important north-south highways.

<text>Mount Morris is a village in the town of Mount Morris in Livingston County, New York, United States. The village population was 2,986 at the 2010 census, out of 4,465 in the entire town. The village and town are named after Robert Morris.

The village is at the northeastern entrance to Letchworth State Park, which contains a scenic gorge and triple waterfall on the Genesee River.

== History ==
The community was first called &quot;Allen Hill&quot; and &quot;Richmond Hill&quot; by early settler Ebenezer &quot;Indian&quot; Allen. The village of Mount Morris was incorporated in 1835. It was named after Robert Morris, a financier of the American Revolution, and later owner of the Morris Reserve, from which the lands around Mount Morris were sold to settlers.

The main trade route in the town&#x27;s early days was the Genesee Valley Canal which ran south from the Erie Canal at Rochester to Olean. The canal was abandoned in the 1870s and later used as a railroad right of way for a succession of railroads, which eventually consolidated into the Pennsylvania Railroad. The Friends of the Genesee Valley Greenway have built hiking trails along some of the canal route.

Mount Morris Academy was an important early school, but it closed in 1867.

Just upstream (west) from the village on the Genesee River is the Mount Morris Dam ( long, high), which was built between 1948 and 1952 for flood control of the lower Genesee Valley. An earlier and much smaller dam, still extant in the village, was used for mills; now it is a small hydroelectric generating station.

In the early 21st century, Greg O&#x27;Connell, a retired New York City detective and developer of properties in Red Hook, Brooklyn, bought 19 buildings along the town&#x27;s Main Street in an effort to revive the downtown area.

A 1910 study reported an average annual total of of precipitation, making Mount Morris the driest place in New York. More recent data puts the annual precipitation at .

== Transport ==
Mount Morris is on the Rochester-to-Dansville line of the Rochester &amp; Southern Railroad. The R&amp;S Rochester-to-Dansville line through Mount Morris was originally part of the New York (Hoboken) to Buffalo Main Line of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&amp;W). This through route, made redundant by the 1960 Erie Lackawanna merger, was downgraded in 1963 with the abandonment of a portion of the line between nearby Groveland and Wayland, over torturous Dansville Hill. The Erie Lackawanna Railway thereafter operated over the far easier grades of the former Erie Railroad, via Hornell, to Binghamton and Hoboken.

In addition to the DL&amp;W, Mount Morris was served by three other railroads: 1) It was served by the Rochester-Avon-Mount Morris line of the Erie Railroad from c. 1860 to 1940. From 1907 to 1934 this offered frequent electric railway service from Mount Morris to Rochester. The Erie line to Mount Morris was abandoned in 1940. 2) The Dansville and Mount Morris Railroad (and predecessor Erie &amp; Genesee Valley RR) linked its namesake communities from c. 1871 to 1940. The Mount Morris segment of the railroad was abandoned with the loss of its connection to the Erie in 1940. 3) The Pennsylvania Railroad (and predecessors) served Mount Morris from c. 1882 to c. 1963 on its Olean-Hinsdale-Rochester branch line. The PRR through Mount Morris was abandoned in 1963, and the right-of-way now forms the basis of the Genesee Valley Greenway.

Mount Morris is now the location of the junction with the R&amp;S&#x27;s branch to the Hampton Corners salt mine. The Hampton Corners line was built in the 1990s and is one of the newest railroad lines in New York state.

<text>Cazenovia is a village in the town of Cazenovia in Madison County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the village had a population of 2,767. The village lies at the south end of Cazenovia Lake and is within a half hour of Syracuse. The village is located on US Route 20 and New York State Route 13, and was home to Cazenovia College.

== History ==

Cazenovia was established in 1794 by John Lincklaen, a young Dutch naval officer who purchased the town under the auspices of the Holland Land Company. Some of the first buildings established in Cazenovia were what is now the Presbyterian Church and the company store. The town is named after Theophilus Cazenove, an agent with the land company.

The village was incorporated in 1810 and was the first county seat (until 1817). Many of the village&#x27;s historic buildings are encompassed by the Albany Street Historic District and Cazenovia Village Historic District. Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places is the Lehigh Valley Railroad Depot.

The most famous event in Cazenovia&#x27;s history was the 1850 Fugitive Slave Convention, organized by abolitionist Gerrit Smith and chaired by former slave Frederick Douglass to consider how to react to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which passed days later.

The Lorenzo State Historic Site was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in July 1970. This land, located off Route 13 (Rippleton Road), now belongs to the NY State Historic Trust after being bought from the previous owner, George Ledyard, upon his death. There is a school house, mansion, farmhouse, and a landscaped garden that guests can tour throughout the year by appointment or during regular hours.

In 2005, the Cazenovia High School Academic Decathlon team won the school&#x27;s first state title, sending the team to the national competition in Chicago. The team retained its state title the following four years, traveling to national competitions in San Antonio, Texas, in 2006, Honolulu, Hawaii, in 2007, Anaheim, California, in 2008, and Memphis, Tennessee, in 2009.

On March 31, 2021, New York State legalized recreational cannabis. Villages cannot limit a resident&#x27;s right to possess or consume cannabis, but villages can prohibit retail outlets from selling it. On July 1, 2021, the village board voted unanimously to opt out of allowing retail cannabis sales in the village. It was one of the first villages in the state to opt out.

In 1890, Robert J. Hubbard purchased and donated a house for the library&#x27;s use. It had been built in 1830 in the Greek Revival style for John Williams. The ground floor of the house served as the main library building until a modern extension was built in 1996. Hubbard also donated his collection of souvenirs from his 1894 Grand Tour of Europe. One of the most notable artifacts he brought back was an ancient Egyptian mummy.

<text>Cazenovia is an incorporated town in Madison County, New York, United States. The population was 6,740 at the time of the 2020 census. The town is named after Theophile Cazenove, the &#x27;Agent General of the Holland Land Company. The village of Cazenovia is located in the center of the town.

The village of Cazenovia was home to Cazenovia College, a small liberal arts college in the greater Syracuse area. It was founded in 1824, known then as the Genesee Seminary.

== History ==
The town of Cazenovia was established in 1793 from the towns of Whitestown and Paris (both in Oneida County) before the creation of Madison County. Subsequently, other towns in the county were formed from partitions of its territory. Cazenovia was part of a region called &quot;The Gore&quot;, based on a surveying error.

It was founded by John Lincklaen, an agent of the Holland Land Company, and was named after Theophile Cazenove, Lincklaen&#x27;s supervisor.

==Geography==
The town is situated along the western edge of Madison County and is bordered to the west by Onondaga County. U.S. Route 20, also known as Albany Street, crosses the town, leading east toward Albany and west toward Auburn.

<text>DeRuyter is a village in the town of DeRuyter in Madison County, New York, United States. The population was 408 at the 2020 census, down from 558 in 2010. The village and town are named after Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter, a famous admiral in the Dutch navy.

== History ==
DeRuyter was originally part of the ancient town of Whitestown, a component of the famous &quot;Lincklaen purchase&quot;. It became part of Cazenovia when that town was formed in 1795, and Col.

Lincklaen named it &quot;DeRuyter&quot;, after his illustrious countryman.

The village of DeRuyter was incorporated in 1833. The location of the village at the confluence of four valleys made DeRuyter an early center of trade. The railroad forming a part of the &quot;old Midland&quot;, running east and west, and the Cazenovia branch running north and south and now forming part of the Lehigh Valley system, furnished excellent facilities for trade and travel.

The building stock dates predominantly from the early to late Victorian period, the peak population and commercial era in DeRuyter&#x27;s history.

DeRuyter was one of five towns formed before Madison County was created. It was established by a partition of the town of Cazenovia in 1798. The town is part of a region called &quot;The Gore&quot;, a territory created by a surveying error.

Previous to 1795, DeRuyter was included in the town of Whitestown and was part of the &quot;Lincklaen Purchase&quot;. &quot;Tromp Township&quot; was the original name given by John Lincklaen, an agent of the Holland Land Company, in honor of a fellow countryman, Admiral Maarten Tromp. The new town of DeRuyter was formed on March 15, 1798. Jan Lincklaen once again named it in honor of a fellow countryman, Admiral Michiel DeRuyter.
The Village of DeRuyter was incorporated in 1833.
Sig Sautelle&#x27;s Circus wintered and trained in DeRuyter from 1896 to the early 1900s.
The first Four-County Fair (Cortland, Madison, Chenango and Onondaga) was held in DeRuyter in 1908. The first DeRuyter Fireman&#x27;s Fair was held in 1927.

<text>Hamilton is a village located within the town of Hamilton in Madison County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the village had a population of 4,107. It is the location of Colgate University.

==History==
The area that became the town and village of Hamilton was originally inhabited by members of the Iroquois League, and some of the territory is still considered to be sacred by the Oneida Indian Nation. Following the American Revolution, the area was ceded to the State of New York. Until 1878, Hamilton was an original outpost of the Chenango Canal.

The town of Hamilton was founded near what is now Earlville, and gradually expanded into a wide area populated by farms and settlements.

The family of the brothers Samuel and Elisha Payne had been prominent in Connecticut since before the Revolutionary War, in which they had served, possibly at Fort Stanwix, near what is now Rome, New York. At the close of the Revolutionary War, the pair moved from Lebanon, Connecticut, to the town of Whitestone (now Whitesboro, New York), a few miles from Utica.

In 1794, Samuel Payne moved southwest from Whitestone into the town of Hamilton, where he started a farm on the hill that is today&#x27;s location of Colgate University.

In 1795, a year after his brother moved into the town of Hamilton, Elisha Payne did so as well. He and others from Whitestone and Connecticut moved to an unsettled area just north of his brother, and that settlement grew to become today&#x27;s village of Hamilton. Because of Elisha Payne&#x27;s interest and ability in developing the settlement, it became known as &quot;Payne&#x27;s Settlement&quot;. He built a barn, the first framed building in the village, and in 1802 he opened a tavern at the intersection of Broad and Lebanon streets, taking the place of an existing tavern that had opened in 1800. This became the Park House (hotel), which in 1925 was replaced by the present-day Colgate Inn. By 1800, Payne&#x27;s Settlement had, in addition to log cabins, five framed buildings and a nearby sawmill. By 1806 much of the land surrounding the settlement had been cleared and replaced by orchards and farms. Salt was the accepted form of currency in the settlement.

Payne&#x27;s Settlement experienced a financial boom from 1800 through the War of 1812 due to extensive crop exports to Europe and to the high prices obtained for provisions in New York during the war. Serving as the trading center, the settlement naturally prospered when farmers received higher prices. In addition, the 1808 opening of the Skaneateles Turnpike, which connected the village to western New York, probably contributed to the favorable economic climate.

From the beginning, Payne&#x27;s Settlement and the other settlements within the town of Hamilton strongly competed to be the principal location for development. Due to the advantages of its location, the balance of power shifted toward Payne&#x27;s Settlement, and in 1812 the settlement obtained a charter incorporating the Village of Hamilton.

Early commerce in the village included groceries, blacksmiths, book sellers, furniture and carriage makers, feed stores, quarries and lumber mills. The village&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Hamilton Recorder&quot;, was started in 1817. The Chenango Canal (1834–1878) passed through the west side of the village alongside what is now the Barge Canal Cafe, providing another connection between the Erie Canal, Midwest grain farms and East Coast markets. Agriculture in the surrounding area initially emphasized hops, which gave way after the Civil War to dairy farming.

Colgate University was founded in the village in 1819. Today, Colgate&#x27;s campus is located on what was Samuel Payne&#x27;s farm. In 1827, the farm, valued at $4,000 , covering , was donated by Payne and his wife to the Baptist Theological Society as the new location of the Society&#x27;s Theological Institution, known as the Hamilton Literary and Theological Institution, which later became Colgate. In 1846, the name of Hamilton Literary and Theological Institution was changed to Madison University. The year 1890 brought about the change in the university&#x27;s name to Colgate University, in honor of the involvement and financial support of the Colgate family over many years.

In 1903, John Vincent Atanasoff, creator of the first digital electronic computer, was born in Hamilton.

Much of the historic core of the village is part of the Hamilton Village Historic District, which became listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Many of the buildings in today&#x27;s village date from 1895, the year of &quot;the great fire&quot; which destroyed much of the village. Many of those buildings were rebuilt in the same year, with &quot;1895&quot; on their facades.

The 2017 movie &quot;Pottersville&quot; starring Michael Shannon and Judy Greer was filmed here.

Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places are the Old Biology Hall (today called Hascall Hall) on Colgate University&#x27;s campus, Adon Smith House, and United States Post Office.

==Geography and climate==
The village, located at (42.825646, −75.544673), lies in the Chenango Valley, just south of the headwaters of the Chenango River, part of the Susquehanna River watershed. Most of the village is in the northwest corner of the town of Hamilton, but the village limits extend north into the towns of Madison and Eaton. New York State Route 12B passes through the village on Broad Street and Utica Street, leading north to the village of Madison and south to Sherburne. The village is approximately southeast of Syracuse and southwest of Utica.

Northeast of Hamilton is Payne Brook, which starts at Lake Moraine and travels through the village before converging with the Chenango River. The elevation of the village&#x27;s municipal airport (Hamilton Municipal Airport) is approximately above sea level.

Snowfall is the most notable aspect of the area&#x27;s climate, which is typical of central Upstate New York in the vicinity of Syracuse. Snowfall produced by lake-effect snow from Lake Erie and Lake Ontario usually extends into the Mohawk Valley and often inland as far as the southern Finger Lakes and the nearby southern tier of counties; with snowfall, at a minimum, in the range of per season. Heavy snow falls frequently occur, generating from of snow and occasionally or more. The village&#x27;s average seasonal snowfall is approximately .

==Government==
The village is governed by a board of trustees. It consists of the mayor, who is presiding officer, and four trustees. The mayor and trustees are elected at the annual village election in June for staggered terms of two-years.

The mayor exercises the executive function and is assisted by the Village Administrator, the Clerk/Treasurer, and the Director of Utilities and Public Works. The board of trustees is the legislative body. It enacts local laws, adopts the budget, and exercises oversight over the Village departments, boards, commissions and committees. Trustees are assigned by the mayor specific oversight and liaison responsibilities. The mayor appoints all public officers and volunteer members of boards, commissions and committees with the approval of the board of trustees. In addition to the elected officials and professional officers, the governance of the village rests in the hands of about fifty volunteers who serve by appointment on ten boards, commissions, and committees. The mayor is an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of every village body. Every trustee serves a liaison on one or more of the bodies.

The 2009–2010 annual budget of the village is approximately 5.7 million dollars.

The Village Court is independent of village government. The Village Judge is elected by the voters for a four-year term.

The village and all of Madison County are within the NY 22nd Congressional District.

Colgate is the largest economic influence in the village: with a population of over 4,000, the village&#x27;s population is just slightly larger than the size of Colgate&#x27;s student body, which is just under 3,000. Approximately 85 percent of the university&#x27;s faculty members live within 10 minutes of campus.

The village, the town of Hamilton, and Colgate have formed the Partnership for Community Development which develops an active network of professional consultants, foundations, municipalities and not-for-profit organizations located throughout the Central New York region to assist area residents, businesses and visitors, including efforts to stimulate and support local business through small business development and the revitalization of historic buildings. To strengthen the relationship between the village and the university, and to add to the economic development of downtown, Colgate relocated its campus bookstore to the downtown area of the village.

<text>Madison is a village in Madison County, New York, United States. The population was 311 at the 2020 census. The village and its town are named after President James Madison.

The village is in the central part of the town of Madison on US Route 20.

== History ==

The village was incorporated in 1816. Located on the Third Great Western Turnpike, the village was on a busy thoroughfare for east-west travelers and featured a hotel and resort on Madison Lake. Much of Madison was owned by businessman G.W. Hinman. Many visitors came from the nearby hamlet of Solsville, where the Chenango Canal and the railroad both had stations.

Madison is most famous for the Madison-Bouckville Antique Show, which takes place in August annually and sees over 1,000 antique dealers and tens of thousands of buyers traveling to Madison to find rare and unique items.

In 2000, Solsville, a half-mile north of Madison, became part of the town of Madison. Solsville is known for its historic Solsville Hotel, which was at one point the town post office, saloon, and ballroom, as well as the old canal house.

<text>Greece is a town in Monroe County, New York, United States. A contiguous suburb of Rochester, it is the largest town by population in Monroe County and the second-largest municipality by population in the county, behind only the city of Rochester. As of the 2020 census, the town had a population of 96,926.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
Indigenous tribes had settled the area surrounding the Finger Lakes and moved northward to Lake Ontario, the Genesee River, Irondequoit Bay, and the ponds of Greece as early as 1300 AD. These people were Iroquoian tribes, early cousins of the Seneca, who traded with the Algonquin and Huron tribes. By about 1550 AD the Seneca, Mohawk, Oneida, Cayuga and Onondaga combined to form the Iroquois Confederacy. (The Tuscarora would later migrate from the Carolinas and join the Confederacy.) They remained the dominant inhabitants of the region for the next 200 years. 

=== European contact ===
The first European to visit the area was the French explorer La Salle, who visited in 1669. French and British soldiers passed through on multiple occasions during this time period as the two colonial powers struggled for control of the region. European settlers began to arrive in the area in the late 1790s, after the land was formally purchased from the Seneca people.

=== Early settlement ===
Following the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War in 1783, the new government was keen to enable its citizens to make use of the new vast regions to the west. In 1792, the first settlers in what would become the town of Greece arrived. William Hincher (a Revolutionary War veteran and a participant in Shays&#x27; Rebellion), his wife Mehitable, and their eight children built a cabin on the west bank of the Genesee River and purchased of land in present-day Charlotte in 1794. Following William&#x27;s death in 1817, a deed was created between Mehitable and the United States government for the establishment of the Charlotte–Genesee Lighthouse on the property, which was constructed in 1822. 

In 1797, Kings Landing—the first European settlement and port west of the Genesee River—was established by the King and Granger families (natives of Suffield, Connecticut) on the bank of the Genesee in what is the present-day neighborhood of Charlotte in Rochester. The Grangers were related patrilineally to Gideon Granger, whose home in nearby Canandaigua is a museum. The Kings Landing settlement survived until it was decimated by malaria, then known as &quot;Genesee Fever&quot;. In 1807 the settlement was revived by the seven Hanford brothers (and renamed &quot;Hanford&#x27;s Landing&quot;), who constructed a mill, hotel and shipping center on the land.

In 1805, James and Sarah Latta (natives of Big Flats) purchased large plots of land in Charlotte for their family. The following year, their son Samuel built a home and warehouse on the property and was appointed customs agent for the Port of Charlotte by the President of the United States. The home built by Samuel Latta still stands at the intersection of Lake Ave and Latta Road.

=== Greece in the War of 1812 ===
On October 1, 1812, the British warship H.M.S. &quot;Royal George&quot; waded at the mouth of the Genesee River. Seventy British marines entered the harbor and seized a United States revenue cutter, a vessel named the &quot;Lady Murray&quot;, and a privately owned schooner. The following day the British returned as the riggings for the &quot;Lady Murray&quot; were kept in a storehouse at the Commercial Hotel operated by Erastus Spaulding (on a site near the present-day intersection of Stutson Street and River Street in Charlotte) and seized the missing equipment along with two gallons of whiskey. 

On June 15, 1813, after learning that provisions for American troops were being stored at Charlotte, a fleet of eight British vessels under the command of Commodore James Yeo entered the Genesee River. 150 British sailors came ashore and seized the provisions along with a sloop which belonged to Erastus Spaulding. To prevent the people of Charlotte from alerting the militia, the British troops rounded them up and locked them overnight in a building owned by Frederick Bushnell and the Samuel Latta Home. A couple of men who managed to evade capture alerted the militia which was gathered at the Steamboat Hotel in Hanford&#x27;s Landing (a distance of about ). Under the command of Colonel Caleb Hopkins the militia marched to Charlotte and arrived just in time to see the British vessels sailing away.

On September 11, 1813, the American fleet under the command of Commodore Isaac Chauncey caught up with the British fleet at Braddock Bay, in the northwest corner of present-day Greece. At 2:30 pm offshore of Charlotte, the American fleet began closing in and came within three-quarters of a mile of the enemy ships, putting them within long gun range. The USS &quot;Pike&quot; and the USS &quot;Sylph&quot; bombarded the British fleet with cannon fire for 90 minutes, but due to the poor maneuverability of the American ships the British were able to escape.

On May 15, 1814, British ships anchored off the shore of Charlotte were spotted by Colonel Isaac Stone. Thirty-three men from Greece, Gates, Rochester and Brighton gathered at the Hanford Inn and marched through the night, arriving at the mouth of the Genesee River at dawn. Due to heavy fog the British believed a much larger force was gathered on the shore. Stone refused initial demands of truce, which were to surrender the provisions being stored at Charlotte. In response the British dispatched a gunboat to the harbor. Stone wanted to capture the boat, but his militia prematurely fired their cannon. The British fired 15-20 shots in return, striking a warehouse. That afternoon, General Peter Porter and the militias under the commands of Colonel Caleb Hopkins, Colonel John Atchinson and Captain Frederick Rose (600-800 men in total) arrived in Charlotte. The British sent a second truce and threatened to land an army and 400 warriors from Tecumseh&#x27;s confederacy if they did not comply. General Porter again refused the demands and warned that if the British landed &quot;they would be taken care of&quot;. Not knowing how many men were defending Charlotte, Yeo and his ships sailed away on the morning of May 16, 1814. 

=== Establishment of the Town of Greece ===
During the late 18th century, counties were established to provide support to the western frontier of New York state. By 1789 Ontario and Genesee counties had been established, and in 1797 a region called Northampton had been designated in the eastern portion of Genesee County on land that had been acquired through the Phelps &amp; Gorham land purchase. Northampton encompassed the area of present-day Parma, Riga, Gates, Ogden, Chili, and Greece.

In 1808, Northampton was divided into four towns. The area that is present-day Gates and Greece maintained the name Northampton until the town of Gates was formally established in 1813. In 1821, Monroe County was created from land of both Ontario and Genesee counties. On March 22, 1822, the state government passed legislation which, effective April 1, 1822, divided Gates into the modern towns of Gates and Greece. The town of Greece received a larger percentage of the land because it was believed that most of the northern portion of the town was unusable swamp land. The name Greece was selected in support of the contemporary Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire. 

=== 1822-present ===
The portion of the Erie Canal which passes through the town of Greece was completed by 1822. The hamlet of &quot;South Greece&quot; (present-day Henpeck Park at the intersection of Ridgeway Avenue and Elmgrove Road) was established to facilitate the needs of travelers and workers on the canal. Some of the stone masons who came from Europe to help build the canal remained in the area and are thought to be responsible for the construction of cobblestone homes which are somewhat unique to the Central and Western New York region. Three such structures remain in the town as of 2024, including the Covert-Brodie-Pollok House on North Greece Road.

Throughout the 19th century Greece was primarily a farming community with a population that hovered around 5,000 people, and additional hamlets such as North Greece, West Greece, Greece Center, Barnard Crossing and Paddy Hill were formed. Much of the economic activity in the town centered on the port of Charlotte, which was incorporated as a village within the town of Greece in 1869, and facilitated up to 100 ships in the port and along the Genesee River in a day. 

The town’s proximity to Lake Ontario made it a famous vacation destination in the latter portion of the 19th century. The Ontario Beach Amusement Park (operating from 1884-1919), located on the site of the present-day Ontario Beach Park, was known as the &quot;Coney Island of the West&quot;. Another amusement park at Manitou Beach (operating from the 1890s to the 1920s) was connected to Charlotte via the Grand View Beach Railway, and grand resort hotels such as the Manitou Hotel, Crescent Beach Hotel and the Odenbach Hotel sprang up along the route to accommodate visitors. The Dentzel Menagerie Carousel, a reminder of the amusement parks&#x27; heyday, still operates at Ontario Beach Park.

It was around this same time that the economy of Greece began to shift from agriculture to industry. In 1891, George Eastman opened the first Kodak plant in the southeast area of town (at the intersection of Mount Read Boulevard and West Ridge Road) that would eventually become known as Kodak Park. Kodak would eventually become the largest employer in the greater Rochester region, and its success is directly responsible for the town&#x27;s growth. As the city of Rochester expanded, it annexed large portions of the town. Charlotte was annexed in 1916 (creating the city&#x27;s 23rd Ward), and the industrial district of Kodak Park was annexed in 1918.

This economic shift continued steadily throughout the interwar period. It was during this time that weather extremes, such as a severe freeze in 1934 which destroyed many of the town&#x27;s orchards, resulted in a devastating loss of crops that many farmers were not able to recover from. As a result, much of the farm land was sold for real estate development. Due to its proximity to Kodak Park, the town transformed as residential construction to support soldiers returning from World War II attracted large numbers of factory workers and their families to Greece. The population grew rapidly during this time, from roughly 15,000 people in 1940 to almost 50,000 by 1960, and by 1967 the population was approaching 75,000.

==Geography==

===The Ridge===
At the end of the last ice age, around 11,000 BCE, much of the land making up the town of Greece was covered by a prehistoric lake which was created by glacial ice sheets that prevented the lake from draining via the St Lawrence River as it does today. This lake, known as Lake Iroquois, was in essence an enlargement of present-day Lake Ontario. As the glaciers receded, the waters of Lake Iroquois began to drop to modern levels, leaving behind a ridge of land roughly from the current shoreline and rising to about above sea level, roughly above Lake Ontario. The soil deposited in these receded regions was rich and fertile for agricultural purposes. This ridge had long been used by Native Americans as a footpath and to this day it is the main thoroughfare of the town, known to locals colloquially as &quot;the Ridge&quot;. 

Sometime between 1801 and 1804, anticipating that the Ridge would become a major thoroughfare, Abel Rowe opened a tavern on Ridge Road. For some time it was one of only two buildings on the Ridge between the Genesee River and Lewiston (on the Niagara River). During the War of 1812 the Ridge served as an important route for transporting troops and supplies across Western New York, and in 1813 New York State appropriated $5,000 for improvements to the roadway. In 1816, stagecoaches began traveling on Ridge Road and would continue to be a major mode of transportation for decades. More taverns and general stores sprang up, often near the hamlets that formed at various points along the Ridge.

By the middle of the 19th century, Ridge Road was lined with prosperous farms and mansions such as the Todd Mansion (at the intersection of West Ridge Road and North Ave) and the Upton Mansion (present day Ridgemont Country Club). In the 1860s a portion of Ridge Road between Long Pond Road and Elmgrove Road was planked, similar to a boardwalk. However, the majority of the Ridge remained a dirt road until the beginning of the 20th century. 

In 1900, Ridge Road became New York State Route 104, and money was appropriated for its improvement. As automobiles gained popularity there was less need for many of the taverns and hotels along the Ridge. Blacksmiths and carriage makers made way for gas stations and repair shops. Route 104 was rebuilt in 1926 to better accommodate travel by motorcar. By the 1940s thousands of Greece residents were traveling along the Ridge daily to work at Kodak, often causing it to become congested. The Ridge was widened in 1956 (four lanes), again in 1978 (six lanes), and again in 2008 (six to eight lanes, plus medians). The last of the early taverns on the Ridge, Streb&#x27;s Steak House, was torn down in 2013. Today shopping plazas, chain restaurants and car dealerships line both sides of Ridge Road.

===Present day===
The town is located west of the Genesee River in central Monroe County, and is bordered by the city of Rochester to the east, the town of Gates to the south, the towns of Parma and Ogden to the west, and Lake Ontario to the north. New York State Route 104 (Ridge Road) crosses the southern part of the town, passing through the town center and leading east into Rochester and west to Clarkson. State Route 18 (Latta Road) passes through North Greece, leading east and then south into Rochester and northwest to Hilton. The Lake Ontario State Parkway runs through the northern part of town, about a mile inland from the shore of the lake. Interstate 390 runs north-south through the eastern part of town.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town of Greece has a total area of , of which are land and , or 7.57%, are water. Wetlands and numerous ponds such as Cranberry Pond, Long Pond and Braddock Bay cover the northernmost portion of the town of Greece along the shoreline of Lake Ontario. This area has the lowest elevation in the town, sitting above sea level. The highest elevation in the town of Greece is south of Ridgeway Avenue along Interstate 390, the current location of BJ&#x27;s Wholesale Club, sitting above sea level.

==Demographics==

As of the census[17] of 2020, there were 96,926 people, 43,885 households, and 25,748 families residing in the town. The population density was 2,040.54 inhabitants per square mile. There were 45,948 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 75.4% White (Non-Hispanic), 8.7% Black or African American, 3.5% Asian, 0.5% from other races, 4.4% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 7.5% of the population.
There were 43,885 households; 54.9% were married couples living together, 13.9% had a female householder with no husband present and 25.1% of households were non-families. The average household size was 2.2 people. The median value of owner-occupied housing units was $185,100.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 17.1% under the age of 18, 6.7% from 18 to 24, 25.5% from 25 to 44, 26.8% from 45 to 64, and 23.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 46.2 years. Males comprised 48.9% of the population versus 51.1% for females.

The median income for a household in the town was $64,867, the median income for a family was $90,950 and the median income for married families was $101,340. The median income for non-family households was $39,086. The median income for full-time working males was $61,166 versus $52,666 for females. The median income for all males working part-time or full-time was $46,504 versus $33,147 for females. The per capita income for the town was $39,510. About 10.39% of the population were below the poverty line, including 9.1% of those under age 18 and 8.1% of those age 65 or over.

==Government==
The town is governed by a town board consisting of a supervisor and four council members. The supervisor is elected by all registered voters in the town, while council members are elected by and represent one of four wards. Supervisors are elected for four-year terms, and by town law may not serve for more than twelve years consecutively, after which the individual is ineligible to serve for four years. Councilpersons are elected for two-year terms, and may serve for a maximum of ten consecutive years in that position.

The town board&#x27;s practice of opening each meeting with a prayer, which started in 1999, was legally challenged in 2008, on the grounds that all prayers offered to open the meetings had, until that point, been Christian ones. The United States District Court, Western District of New York, ruled in favor of the town in 2010, and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision in 2012, setting the stage for a 2014 decision by the Supreme Court of the United States which ruled in favor of the town (see &quot;Town of Greece v. Galloway&quot;).

The town is also represented in congress by three different representatives, the State Assembly Representative, State Senatorial Representative and the Congressional Representative.

The town&#x27;s New York State Assembly Representative is Josh Jensen who represents the towns of Greece, Ogden and Parma.

The town&#x27;s New York State Senatorial Representative is Jeremy Cooney who represents the Towns of Brighton, Clarkson, Gates, Greece, Hamlin, Parma, as well as parts of the City of Rochester, including Charlotte, Historic Maplewood and the University of Rochester.

The town&#x27;s United States Congressional Representative is Joseph Morelle who was elected on November 6, 2018 replacing the late Representative Louise Slaughter, who had served as the United States representative for the 25th congressional district of New York from 1987 until her death in early 2018. He represents all of Monroe County except for the towns of Mendon, Rush, Hamlin, Wheatland, and one election district in the town of Clarkson.

Six of the 29 districts of the Monroe County Legislature include portions of Greece.

==Education==
Education in the Town of Greece dates back to at least 1798 when the residents of then Northampton elected the first school commissioner. In 1823, a year after its founding, the Town of Greece was divided into Common School Districts. By the end of the 19th century the town had seventeen Common School Districts, as well as two Joint School Districts on the Greece / Parma town border. During this time the districts were repeatedly renumbered and restructured as the population of students in the town grew. Common School District #15 - Barnard School is the only building still functioning as a school. It is currently occupied by Derech HaTorah, a private Jewish school.

Centralization of the Common School Districts began in 1928 with the consolidation of districts 3, 11 and 16 which were combined to form Greece Central School District #1 - Hoover Drive. Greece was the first centralized school district in Monroe County and the thirteenth centralized school district in New York State.

As the population expanded rapidly following World War II, the Greece Central School district grew to accommodate its growing number of students. The first secondary school in town following the annexation of Charlotte was Olympia High School which opened in 1959. Prior to the construction of Olympia the only secondary schools serving residents of the Town of Greece were Charlotte High School and John Marshall High School in the City of Rochester. Over the next 10 years two more secondary schools would follow; Arcadia High School (1963), and Athena High School (1969). The Hoover Drive School was eventually transformed to the Odyssey Academy before relocating to the site of the former Cardinal Mooney High School in 2012 following the consolidation of Apollo Middle School — which had previously occupied the Cardinal Mooney building — and Olympia High School.

Today there are three school districts serving the Town of Greece: the Greece Central School District, the Hilton Central School District and the Spencerport Central School District. The schools of the Greece Central School District educate approximately 11,000 students. Excluding New York City, the Greece Central School District is the seventh largest school district in the State of New York. The post-elementary schools have Classical Greek names and mascots. Private sources of education within the Town of Greece include the Greece Montessori School, Rochester Academy Charter High School, Dorech HaTorah Jewish School and St. Lawrence Catholic School.

<text>Pittsford is a village in Monroe County, New York, United States. The population was 1,419 at the 2020 census. It is named after Pittsford, Vermont, the native town of a founding father. It is the oldest village in New York, incorporated in 1827. The village, an Erie Canal community, is in the town of Pittsford and is a suburb of Rochester.

==History ==
Pittsford is the oldest of Monroe County&#x27;s ten incorporated villages. The village was the site of a spring-fed pond which attracted the first European Americans. Israel Stone, the village&#x27;s first settler, built the village&#x27;s first structure, a log house next to the pond, in 1789.

The town of Pittsford surrounding the village was established in 1789 and was originally named &quot;Northfield&quot;. Pittsford&#x27;s original hamlet settlement was located a mile south of the current village. In the second decade of the nineteenth century the opening of a new east–west highway (now NYS Route 31) and the surveying of the proposed Erie Canal route caused settlement to migrate northward to the Four Corners area.

Early Pittsford served as the governmental seat for the town of Northfield, comprising most of what is now eastern Monroe County. The settlement contained the county&#x27;s first school (1794), the first library (1803), the first permanent church (1807), the first post office (1811), and the first newspaper (1815). In 1813, after the surrounding towns were organized, reducing Northfield&#x27;s territory, the name Pittsford was adopted to honor the Vermont birthplace of Colonel Caleb Hopkins, a farmer, community leader and hero from the War of 1812. Pittsford&#x27;s first church began meeting in 1803. The congregation survives today as the First Presbyterian Church on Church Street.

Pittsford prospered as a local trading center due to its location at the intersection of the primary road between the mills at the Genesee Falls in Rochesterville and Canandaigua, the region&#x27;s oldest and largest town and the new east–west road (now New York State Route 31). In 1816, Samuel Hildreth established the area&#x27;s first stage coach line, eventually putting Pittsford at the center of a large stage network covering much of western New York.

Pittsford grew rapidly after the opening of the Erie Canal in 1822 and was incorporated as a village on July 4, 1827. Local entrepreneurs profited from both canal construction and other businesses which benefited from the canal trade. Pittsford&#x27;s excellent agricultural soil led to the early and successful development of commercial agriculture. However, because of its superior waterpower, Rochester soon eclipsed Pittsford as Monroe County&#x27;s dominant economic and population center. Pittsford grew slowly through the middle of the nineteenth century. One result of Pittsford&#x27;s mid-century decline was that unlike other local towns, many of Pittsford&#x27;s earliest buildings have survived. Boosted by the arrival of the Rochester &amp; Auburn railroad in 1834, Pittsford remained an important shipping center for local grains and produce until the late twentieth century. Village industries included a flour mill, lumberyards, produce warehouses, a malt house and several fruit dry houses. The present charm of the village&#x27;s waterfront is due to the survival of historic canal warehouses, mills, and silos, which in recent years have been rehabilitated for offices, boutiques, and restaurants.

Beginning in the 1870s, the village and town of Pittsford once again began to grow. In the second half of the nineteenth century wealthy Rochesterians began to establish country estates in and around the village. These estates were the first step in Pittsford&#x27;s evolution from a farming community into a suburb of Rochester.

Three of these grand homes remain within the village. Pittsford Farms, the oldest of the three village estates, was established in the 1860s by Jarvis Lord, a canal contractor. The property has retained its historic appearance and remains today a working farm, owned by descendants of the Zornow family. The farm&#x27;s dairy plant continues to bottle milk in returnable glass containers. The Town of Pittsford has purchased the development rights to this farm and seven others to ensure their open space remains for generations to come.

During the first quarter of the twentieth century, the construction of the Rochester &amp; Eastern Trolley line and growing automobile ownership placed Pittsford within easy commuting distance of Rochester. During the early twentieth century, a number of infrastructure improvements were completed in the village, including a water system, paved streets, storm and sanitary sewers, and electric street lights. These decades also witnessed the development of new village neighborhoods of four-square, Craftsman and Colonial Revival homes. The establishment of four country clubs and two colleges just outside the village contributed to the village&#x27;s desirability as a premium suburban residential community.

By the 1950s Pittsford began to experience significant population growth from suburban residential development. As the area surrounding the village continued to grow, residents became increasingly concerned about the effects of this growth on the village. Increasing traffic, demolition of historic buildings, commercial encroachment into historic neighborhoods, and the loss of open space led to the beginning of grass roots preservation efforts. Over the last fifty years, residents, business people, and government officials have worked cooperatively to preserve, enhance and revitalize Pittsford Village. Among the community&#x27;s accomplishments are the restoration of numerous village buildings, the establishment of a historic preservation district, the redevelopment of the village&#x27;s Erie Canal waterfront for commercial and recreational use, and the preservation of farmland through the town&#x27;s purchase of development rights. Today the village of Pittsford is widely admired for the preservation of its historic character and its charming walkable business district.

The Hildreth-Lord-Hawley Farm, Hopkins Farm, Adolph Lomb House, Phoenix Building, Pittsford Village Historic District, Spring House, and Thomas Youngs House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Pittsford is an incorporated town in Monroe County, New York. A suburb of Rochester, its population was 30,617 at the time of the 2020 census. Formerly part of the town of Northfield, Pittsford was settled in 1789 and incorporated in 1796. The village of Pittsford was incorporated in 1827. It was named by Colonel Caleb Hopkins, War of 1812 hero and subsequently Pittsford town supervisor, for the town of his birth, Pittsford, Vermont.

The Erie Canal passes through the town.

== History ==
The town is situated within the region subject to the Marquis de Denonville&#x27;s expedition of 1,600 French soldiers, 400 Canadian colonials, and 983 Native American allies in 1687, for the purpose of punishing the Seneca tribe, the foremost nation of the Iroquois Indian Confederacy, for their connection with the English and their interference in the lucrative French fur trade.

In 1788, Massachusetts abandoned its claim to this region in favor of New York. Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham of Connecticut settled with the state of Massachusetts for a title of land in western New York. On July 8, 1788, Oliver and Nathaniel met with the Senecas and signed the Treaty of Buffalo Creek at Geneseo in Livingston County where the Indians gave up their title. The District of Northfield was formed in Ontario County in 1792. This became the town of Northfield in 1796. What is now the village of Pittsford was settled the same year. As Northfield, which was renamed Boyle in 1808 and again to Smallwood in 1813, was subdivided in the following years, a final split formed the towns of Pittsford and Brighton in 1814.

The completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 led to increased development of the various towns in western New York along its route. Proximity to Rochester via canal and the Genesee River proved beneficial to the village of Pittsford too.

The Auburn and Rochester Railroad arrived in 1840, providing faster passenger service than the canal. This line soon became part of the New York Central operation and was in use until 1960. The enlarged Erie Canal continued to provide cheap transportation to the mills of Rochester though. By 1918, the modern barge canal was in service, following the same route as older canals, but widened and deepened.

The Adsit Cobblestone Farmhouse, Cole Cobblestone Farmhouse, Gates-Livermore Cobblestone Farmhouse, Mendon Cobblestone Academy, Mendon Presbyterian Church, Miller–Horton–Barben Farm, Sheldon Cobblestone House, Stewart Cobblestone Farmhouse, and Whitcomb Cobblestone Farmhouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Greenprint ==
In 1996 the &quot;Greenprint Plan&quot; was adopted to preserve open space from the encroaching development that had taken so much of the town&#x27;s countryside since the 1960s. The Greenprint involved the town&#x27;s purchase of development rights to what was then two-thirds of Pittsford&#x27;s remaining farmland. Initiated and successfully carried through by Supervisor William A. Carpenter, with passage of the Greenprint, Pittsford became the first town in the State of New York to save open space by purchasing development rights. In the years since, Pittsford&#x27;s Greenprint has been recognized nationally and remains a frequently-cited example of successful open space preservation.

== Education ==
Public schools are administered by the Pittsford Central School District.

The district has received the New York State Governor&#x27;s Excelsior Award for quality. It costs $13,900 per year to educate a Pittsford student. Barker Road Middle School and Calkins Road Middle School have also received an award in 2006 and 2009 as one of the national &quot;Schools to Watch&quot;.

The district has two high schools, Pittsford Sutherland and Pittsford Mendon. Sutherland plays its athletics as the Knights while Mendon students are known as the Vikings. In sports for in which the two high schools combine to form a single team, such as football and lacrosse, they are known as the Panthers. The two schools have a long-standing rivalry in basketball, culminating with the annual Rainbow Classic game held at the University of Rochester. The Rainbow Classic is an annual fundraiser to support Golisano Children&#x27;s Hospital. The Rainbow Classic was created in memory of Katelyn Pasley, who was treated at the Golisano Children&#x27;s Hospital before she died. In addition, when Ryan McCluski died in 2004 after treatment at the hospital, the Pasley and McCluski families joined together to turn the tragedies into something positive for the community. The event has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Golisano Children&#x27;s Hospital. Adding to the many successful sports teams in Pittsford, NY, the Pittsford Mendon Vikings soccer team has a strong tradition, holding the New York State record of seven state championships. Pittsford&#x27;s swimming program is ranked overall 22nd in the nation, with girls being ranked 12th and having won 14 straight sectional championships, and boys being ranked 22nd, having won 13 straight titles.

<doc id="259888" wikidata="Q7978889" url="?curid=259888" title="Webster (village), New York">
<text>Webster is a village in Monroe County, New York, United States. The population was 5,651 at the time of the 2020 census. The village and town are named after orator and statesman Daniel Webster. The village was incorporated in 1905.

==History==
The village of Webster has historically served as the core of the town of Webster. The commercial section of the village dates back to 1812, when the first two buildings were constructed near the present four corners. One of these buildings was a store and the other a tavern. From this modest beginning, the community and its center began to grow, becoming the commercial, social, and educational center of the town.

The history of the village center reflects the changing economy of the community. The village core was originally an agricultural center and distribution point for the town. The junction of Ridge Road and Webster Nine-Mile Point Road, which connected shipping points on the Erie Canal and the New York Central Railroad with a small port on Lake Ontario, was referred to as &quot;the Village&quot; because of a concentration of population and businesses. The railroad at the north end of the village attracted dried or evaporated apple businesses and small wood-working industries. The village continued to be the shipping center for the area&#x27;s dried apple industry until well after World War I. The village also had the world&#x27;s largest basket factory and was the center for the canning industry in Monroe County.

At the beginning of the 1900s, several events significantly influenced the development of the village and its downtown core. The first bank since the Civil War era was established in the core area, and the Rochester-Sodus Bay Trolley connected Webster to Rochester, leading to a major expansion of the village residential area. In 1905, the village was incorporated, followed by municipal infrastructure improvements and services including fire protection, water service and sewage disposal.

As the primary commercial hub of the area, the village of Webster became the focus of the community&#x27;s social life. The presence of the post office, library, banks, and government offices all served to bring people into the area. Further, commercial buildings had several functions, providing retail space on the ground floor and offices or residential apartments on the upper floors. These tenants provided sufficient rental income for property owners to make a profit and properly maintain their buildings.

After World War II, there were striking changes that transformed Webster&#x27;s character. First, the agricultural nature of the area has seen major encroachment by suburban growth moving outward from Rochester. The town of Webster became one of the major suburban residential areas in Monroe County, with its population more than doubling between 1950 and 1960. Substantial residential development has continued to the present. As a consequence, the agricultural industry that made the village center a market point and an administrative, social, and institutional center has diminished. Secondly, decisions made in the 1950s and 1960s by the former Haloid Company, now Xerox, to invest in major office, research and manufacturing facilities to be located in the village and the town of Webster brought about extensive changes in population growth trends in the area. The construction of Route 104 also contributed greatly to the area&#x27;s growth as access to the metropolitan area was vastly improved. Along with population growth, there has been significant commercial expansion in the village.

The Jayne and Mason Bank Building, William C. Jayne House, George G. Mason House, and Webster Baptist Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

==Homicides==
On December 7, 2011, 15-year-old Michael Pilato poured gasoline over his house in Webster and set it on fire, killing his father and two brothers (16 and 12 years old) as his mother and teenage sister escaped with injuries. In June 2013, Pilato was convicted of second-degree murder, attempted murder, murder by arson, and arson; he was subsequently sentenced to life in prison.

During the predawn hours of December 24, 2012, 62-year-old William Spengler ambushed volunteer firefighters from the West Webster Fire Department, shooting and killing two and seriously wounding two others as they arrived to put out a car fire on Lake Road. Investigators later determined the fire was started by Spengler. Ultimately seven homes were destroyed because fire fighters were unable to extinguish the flames until the scene was made safe by law enforcement. Volunteer fire fighters Mike Chiapperini (also a lieutenant with the Webster Police Department) and Tomasz Kaczowka died at the scene. Theodore Scardino and Joseph Hofstetter remained hospitalized with serious injuries. John Ritter, a policeman from nearby Greece, New York, happened to be in the area, and was injured by shrapnel.

Spengler had armed himself with three guns: a .38-caliber revolver, a 12-gauge shotgun, and a .223-caliber Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle outfitted with a flash suppressor. Spengler had served 17 years in jail for manslaughter, having been convicted in 1981 of beating his 92-year-old grandmother to death with a hammer in 1980. He shot and killed himself as a SWAT team approached. Later, human remains believed to be those of his elder sister, with whom he had feuded, were found in his house. On December 28, 2012, 24 year-old Dawn Nguyen of Rochester, New York, was arrested and charged in connection with furnishing Spengler with certain weapons in his arsenal which were used in the ambush. In September 2014, she was convicted and sentenced to 8 years in prison. The New York State Senate subsequently included a &quot;Webster provision&quot; in a gun control law passed in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, mandating life without parole for murderers of emergency personnel.

<text>Amsterdam is a town in Montgomery County, New York, United States. The population was 5,566 at the 2010 census. The town is named after Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands.

The town is adjacent to and borders the city of Amsterdam on three sides. The town is on the county&#x27;s northeastern border. The Mohawk River, which is part of the Erie Canal, passes along the southern border of the town.

==History==
The region was controlled by the powerful Iroquois Confederation&#x27;s member tribe, the Mohawk, prior to the entry of Europeans into the area.

The town was first settled around 1715, but most settlement did not take place until Sir William Johnson established his first seat of power in the region at Fort Johnson (earlier known as Mount Johnson), prior to founding the city of Johnstown.

The town was formed in 1793 from part of the town of Caughnawaga.

The village of Amsterdam was incorporated in 1838 in the south part of the town. As the village grew toward becoming the city of Amsterdam, it took in more territory inside the town. The town of Perth (also in Fulton County) was removed in 1838.

In 1865, the population of Amsterdam was 5,135.

The Hurricana Stock Farm and Samuel and Johanna Jones Farm are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Amsterdam () is a city in Montgomery County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 18,219. The city is named after Amsterdam in the Netherlands.

The City of Amsterdam is surrounded on the northern, eastern and western sides by the town of Amsterdam. The city developed on both sides of the Mohawk River, with the majority located on the north bank. The Port Jackson area on the south side is also part of the city.

==History==
Prior to settlement by Europeans, the region which includes Amsterdam was inhabited for centuries by the Mohawk tribe of the Iroquois Confederacy, which dominated most of the Mohawk Valley. They had pushed the Algonquin Mohican tribe to the east of the Hudson River.

Dutch settlers began to arrive in the area in the 1660s, founding Schenectady in 1664. They had previously been based in Albany, along the Hudson River to the east. They reached what would later be Amsterdam c.1710. They called the community Veeders Mills and Veedersburgh after Albert Veeder, an early mill owner. By the second decade of the 1700s, Scotch-Irish and German Palatinate immigrants began to arrive in the Mohawk Valley region, but few settled in Amsterdam. The governor of the colony granted a group of 100 Palatine German households land in the area that developed as Little Falls, New York to the west, where the English planned they could serve as a buffer to French and Native American incursions.

The American Revolutionary War had little effect on the Amsterdam region. No major battles were fought there or in the surrounding region. The Battle of Johnstown was essentially the repelling of a raid by British forces and their Native American, mostly Iroquois, allies.

Amsterdam grew slowly after the war, primarily providing the services needed for the farming communities which surrounded it. It was located in the now-defunct Town of Caughnawaga. When the Town of Amsterdam was created, the city changed its name to Amsterdam in 1803, possibly to encourage its selection as the seat of the town&#x27;s government.

After the War, Loyalists such as the powerful Johnson family fled to Canada. Sir William Johnson had long been the British agent of Indian Affairs for this region. Many new land-hungry settlers came from New England as the state sold off former Iroquois lands for development. The settlement was incorporated as a village on April 20, 1830, from a section of the Town of Amsterdam.

This was a period of rapid growth for the village, influenced by major transportation developments. In turn, the Mohawk Turnpike, the Erie Canal, and construction of the railroad across the valley improved trade. The steeply descending creeks in the region, which flowed from the foothills of the Adirondacks, were used to power an increasing number of mills. These manufactured goods that were shipped from the region by land, canal and rail. Products such as linseed oil, brooms, knit ware, buttons, and iron goods were produced in the growing village, which became an important manufacturing center. It was best known, however, for its carpets, eventually becoming the carpet and rug manufacturing center of the U.S.

Through the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Amsterdam was a destination for immigrants from Europe: Irish, Italian, Polish, and Lithuanian peoples, among others, who found work in the factories.

In 1865, the population of Amsterdam was 5,135. New charters in 1854, 1865, and 1875 increased the size of the village. In 1885, Amsterdam incorporated as a city; it expanded by annexing Rockton to the north, and the former village of Port Jackson on the south side of the Mohawk River was annexed to become the fifth ward of the city. By 1920, the city&#x27;s population was 33,524.

In the Great Depression, the mills slowed down their output, but did not close. The city survived the two world wars without significant effect. Shortly after World War II, however, manufacturing in general began to move to the southern United States, where labor costs and taxes were lower. The mills of Amsterdam also shifted their jobs to the South. After a period in the South, that region lost industrial jobs to overseas locations. 

Additionally, the second and third generations of the city&#x27;s immigrant families often left to go to college and did not return, as there were few jobs to attract college-educated citizens. The city attempted to re-create its industrial base, but these efforts were not particularly successful.

Subsequent city and State projects intended for improved commuting and urban renewal resulted in eroding the local character of the city. As the city&#x27;s website expresses it: 
In an attempt to draw people and business back to Amsterdam, the City and State began a program of urban renewal and arterial roadway construction, destroying much of the original fabric of downtown. Now, not only is there less to go downtown for, it&#x27;s harder to get there. Once again, Amsterdam is somewhere to be bypassed on the way to somewhere else.

In the early 21st century, post-industrial Amsterdam is still trying to re-invent itself. The city suffered serious flood damage in late August 2011, in the aftermath of Hurricane Irene. The flooding threatened properties at the river&#x27;s edge due to erosion and water damage.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 6.3 square miles (16.3 km), of which 5.9 square miles (15.4 km) is land and 0.3 square miles (0.9 km) is water, with the total area being 5.41% water. The city developed on both sides of the Mohawk River and Erie Canal, and both North Chuctanunda Creek and South Chuctanunda Creek flow into the Mohawk at Amsterdam.

New York State Route 30, a north-south highway called Market Street in part, crosses the Mohawk River to link the main part of Amsterdam to the New York State Thruway. NY-30 also intersects east-west highways New York State Route 5 and New York State Route 67 in the city. New York State Route 5S passes along the south side of the Mohawk River.

Amsterdam is currently within New York&#x27;s 20th congressional district.

==Economy==
In the 19th century, the city of Amsterdam was known for carpet, textile, and pearl button, manufacturing. It continued to be a center for carpet-making in the 20th century, when the Bigelow-Sanford and Mohawk Mills Carpet companies both were located in Amsterdam, but these companies have relocated to other regions. Amsterdam was also the home of Coleco, makers of the ColecoVision, Cabbage Patch Kids and the Coleco Adam. Founded in 1932 as the Connecticut Leather Company, Coleco went bankrupt in 1988 after a failed attempt to enter the electronics market, and pulled out of Amsterdam, as well as its other North American manufacturing sites.

The enclosed shopping center is named the Amsterdam Riverfront Center. Once filled with clothing shops, the mall complex has been adapted for offices of doctors, public assistance services, community organizations, a radio station, and an off-track betting site.
Media in Amsterdam includes one print newspaper, &quot;The Recorder&quot;, which is owned by the Schenectady-based Daily Gazette, an online newspaper, &quot;The Mohawk Valley Compass&quot;, and two AM radio stations, WVTL and WCSS.

In the early 2000s, distribution centers began being constructed in the Florida Business Park in the Town of Florida, which is located just outside the City of Amsterdam. The park currently holds Target, Hill &amp; Marks, Alpin Haus, and most recently, Dollar General. In 2019, Vida Blend broke ground on a new distribution center in the park. Some thousands of city and adjacent county residents are now employed by these businesses.

* The Maple Leaf, operating between Toronto Union Station, and New York Penn Station
* Two Empire Service trains, operating between Niagara Falls and New York Penn Station

In 2022, CDTA began providing bus services with two inner-city routes, a Thruway Express route, and an Amsterdam-Schenectady route.

The City of Amsterdam has two Level 3 DC Fast Chargers for electric vehicles provided by New York Power Authority&#x27;s Evolve NY program. These chargers are located at the city owned parking lot in downtown near the Amsterdam Free Library. Other chargers are located throughout the city at various parks.

==Sports==
*Amsterdam&#x27;s municipal golf course was designed by Robert Trent Jones.
*The city is home to the Amsterdam Mohawks baseball team of the Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League. The team plays at Shuttleworth Park.

==Places of interest==
*The Mohawk Valley Gateway Overlook pedestrian bridge spans the Mohawk River and connects the city&#x27;s Bridge Street downtown area on the south shore and Riverlink Park on the north. It was built from 2014 to 2016.
*Lock E11 was built to facilitate water traffic on the Mohawk River/Erie Canal; it is one of 8 locks which include a truss structure which spans the river and which has multiple steel gates which can be opened and closed by the use of electric winches in order to dam the river or let it flow freely.
*The Sanford Clock Tower, also known as the Sanford Mills, the Hasbro Plant, the Coleco Industries Plant – where Cabbage Patch Dolls and ColecoVision were manufactured in the 1970s and 1980s – and, currently, the Clock Tower Complex, was built in 1922 for carpet magnate Stephen Sanford as the headquarters and mill of the Sanford-Bigelow Carpet Company. The current owners, who bought the property in 2001, hope to attract small businesses and professional as well as manufacturing and warehousing businesses to the building.

Although ill-considered urban renewal highway projects did significant damage to the city&#x27;s historic downtown, a few historic buildings and sites, mostly from the 19th and 20th centuries, remain in the city, and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP):

*Amsterdam (46th Separate Company) Armory was built in 1895 as an armory for the New York Army National Guard and was decommissioned in 1994. It is now a bed and breakfast inn called the Amsterdam Castle;

<text>Canajoharie () is a village in the Town of Canajoharie in Montgomery County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census, the village had a population of 2,229. The name is said to be a Mohawk language term meaning &quot;the pot that washes itself,&quot; referring to the &quot;Canajoharie Boiling Pot,&quot; a circular gorge in the Canajoharie Creek, just south of the village.

The village of Canajoharie is at the north border of the Town of Canajoharie; it is west of Amsterdam and east of Utica. The village and town name also refer to Canajoharie, a historic Mohawk town that was located west of here, referred to by the English colonists as the &quot;Upper Castle.&quot; A church stands at that site from the pre-revolutionary era; the Mohawk Upper Castle Historic District is a National Historic Landmark.

The village of Canajoharie was home to one of a handful of operating &quot;dummy lights&quot; in the United States, located downtown at the intersection of Church, Mohawk and Montgomery Streets (also known as Wagner Square). It is a traffic signal on a pedestal located in the middle of an intersection; the light was first installed in 1926. After a couple of serious motor vehicle accidents which occurred in 2021, the dummy light was removed from Wagner Square and hasn&#x27;t been back since due to possible legal risks. Two others are currently located in New York State, in Beacon and Croton-on-Hudson.

The Erie Canal passes the north side of the village.

The village was the headquarters for the manufacturing operations of the Beech-Nut baby food company from its founding in 1891 until the plant was closed in March 2011 with production moving to the town of Florida in the same county, on the south side of the river.

In 2015 most of the village (and a small area to its south) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Canajoharie Historic District, due to its importance as a transportation hub over its existence and the well-preserved architecture from different eras. In addition, the Bragdon-Lipe House, the Van Alstyne Homestead, the West Hill School, and the United States Post Office are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
The current village is located east of the historic &quot;Canajoharie&quot;, one of two major towns of the Mohawk nation in the late 17th and 18th centuries. The Mohawk Upper Castle Historic District in the former area contains the Upper Castle Church (1769) and archeological sites related to Mohawk and Iroquois history; it is a National Historic Landmark.

Palatine German settlers, Protestant refugees from religious wars in Europe, were allowed to establish a community in this area in the 1730s. They had earlier lived in work camps along the Hudson River in Dutchess County, to pay off their passage from England, which was paid by Queen Anne&#x27;s government. Their community was called &quot;Roofville&quot; (according to anglicized spelling) after early inhabitant Johannes Rueff. The village was incorporated in 1829.

During the middle of the 19th century, three fires almost destroyed the village. It was renamed Canajoharie. Because of the losses due to the fires, the village passed an ordinance prohibiting houses to be constructed of wood. Many of the older houses in the town are made of brick or locally quarried stone.

After the Revolutionary War, George Washington visited Canajoharie. He had been in the region to survey damage done to nearby Cherry Valley from a destructive raid by Joseph Brant, a noted Mohawk chief allied with the British, and his forces. Washington stayed the night at Van Alstyne Homestead (sometimes referred to as Fort Rensselaer), a common meeting place.

==Geography==

The village is on the south bank of the Mohawk River.

The New York State Thruway, New York State Route 5S (Erie Boulevard/East Main Street), and New York State Route 10 (Rock Street/Reed Street) pass through the village. On the opposite bank of the Mohawk is the community of Palatine Bridge in the Town of Palatine; both names refer to the colonial German settlers.

Wintergreen Park is one mile from the village downtown and offers views of the Canajoharie Gorge and the Canajoharie Falls.

<text>Canajoharie () is a town in Montgomery County, New York, United States. The population was 3,730 in 2010. Canajoharie is located south of the Mohawk River on the southern border of the county. The Erie Canal passes along the northern town line. There is also a village of Canajoharie in the town. Both are east of Utica and west of Amsterdam.

These were settled as European-American jurisdictions, named for the historic Mohawk village of the same name, which was also known as the Mohawk Upper Castle.

== History ==
The town is near the former site of Canajoharie, an important village of the Mohawk nation that also became known as the Upper Castle. The Mohawk had as their territory most of the central area of present-day New York, from the Hudson River west to where Oneida territory started. They also used the St. Lawrence River valley as hunting grounds after 1601. They dominated the fur trade with the French based in central Quebec, and with Dutch and later English in eastern New York. French, Dutch and later English trappers and traders came to this Mohawk village to trade. Both the French and Dutch married or had unions with Mohawk women, increasing their ties with the people. Their mixed-race children married into the Dutch and later English communities. Many of their sons also became interpreters or traders.

Anglo-Europeans began settling in the area c.1737, and the Mohawk gradually adopted certain English customs in their village. Because the Mohawk and three other Iroquois nations were allied with the British during the Revolutionary War, they were forced to cede most of their lands in New York after the United States&#x27; victory. The state sold millions of acres of land to speculators and private owners.

The town of Canajoharie was consumed by fire twice, causing an ordinance to be passed prohibiting homes to be constructed of wood. Therefore, many of the older homes in the town are made of brick or locally quarried stone.

After the Revolutionary War, George Washington visited Canajoharie after surveying the damage to nearby Cherry Valley. He stayed the night at the Van Alstyne home, a common meeting place. The Van Alstyne house has long been referred to by some as Ft. Rensselaer; the actual Ft. Rensselaer (destroyed sometime before the French-Indian War) was in nearby Fort Plain.

The modern town was formed in 1788, but was reduced in size to create the towns of Minden (1797) and Root (in part, 1822). While the Mohawk Valley developed with the completion of the Erie Canal, the project also enabled considerable migration from New York to the Midwest. The population of the town in 1865 was 4,248.

Beech-Nut, the baby food producer, was founded in Canajoharie in 1890 during the period of early industrialization in the river valley. It served as the largest employer in the town for more than a century. In March 2011, the Beech-Nut factory moved out of Canajoharie, relocating to a new factory in the nearby town of Florida, near Amsterdam on the south side of the river, still in Montgomery County.

<doc id="259894" wikidata="Q2228903" url="?curid=259894" title="St. Johnsville (village), New York">
<text>St. Johnsville is a village in Montgomery County, New York, United States. The population was 1,732 at the 2010 census. Accounts vary as to the etymology of the name, but most of these credit Alexander St. John, an early surveyor and commissioner, while still others credit an early name for the area, St. John&#x27;s Church.

The Village of St. Johnsville is in the southern part of the Town of St. Johnsville and lies between Utica and Amsterdam. In 2019, almost the entire village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the St. Johnsville Historic District.

== History ==
The area was within the territory of the Mohawk tribe when Europeans first entered the Mohawk Valley. Palatine Germans began settling the area in the early 18th century.

The community was first settled &quot;circa&quot; 1775.

A small battle was fought during the American Revolution in 1780 near Fort Klock, which lies to the east of St. Johnsville.

St. Johnsville village was incorporated in 1857.

On October 12, 1914, former President Theodore Roosevelt arrived from the west by auto caravan at Allter’s corner in St. Johnsville (where Stewart’s is today). He spoke from an auto on behalf of the candidacy of Progressive Party candidate for governor, Frederick Davenport. Local residents surrounded his car on all sides. Roosevelt’s theme was that people should be wary of the old political parties and get rid of Albany party bosses Barnes and Murphy, who were in collusion with one another. The Enterprise said that Davenport was the more impressive speaker as Roosevelt “is evidently unable to cope with outdoor activities at the present time.” The auto caravan moved on, heading for Albany. Davenport lost in November, Roosevelt chose not to run for President in 1916, and the Progressive Party faded away. Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt stopped his car there (the old store had been razed by then) in the fall of 1930 and made a brief address about farm relief and the need for a $50 million bond issue for prisons and to care for the insane. Future Governor Herbert Lehman also spoke to the crowd. Future Governor Thomas Dewey stopped at the Shell station in June 1941, and then visited Pietrocini’s barber shop.

On June 28, 2006, St. Johnsville faced its worst flood in one hundred years.

<text>St. Johnsville is a town in Montgomery County, New York, United States. The population was 2,631 at the 2010 census. Accounts vary as to the etymology of St. Johnsville, but most of them state that the town and its village are named after an early surveyor and commissioner, Alexander St. John. Still others credit the naming of St. Johnsville to a former name for the area, St. John&#x27;s Church.

The Town of St. Johnsville is in the northwestern part of the county. The town contains a village, also called St. Johnsville. Both town and village are approximately halfway between Utica and Amsterdam.

The Erie Canal, as part of the Mohawk River, is at the town&#x27;s southern border.

== History ==

The town was first settled around 1725. The territory was part of the Palatine District.

In 1769, Sir William Johnson built a church in the town for the benefit of his Indian allies.

A brief skirmish was fought in the town in 1780 near Fort Klock, a fortified house.

The Town of St. Johnsville was formed in 1838 from the Town of Oppenheim ( which then became part of the newly created Fulton County ).

In 1857, the community of St. Johnsville set itself off from the town by incorporating as a village.

According to the &quot;Enterprise and News&quot;, November 17, 1937, by 1934, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph H. Reaney had given 120 acres of land to the Village of Saint Johnsville. This land was named Klock Park after Dr. Charles M. Klock, a highly regarded local physician. Today the H.C Smith Benefit Club utilizes the building to host many community events.

The First Methodist Episcopal Church of St. Johnsville, Fort Klock, Enlarged Double Lock No. 33 Old Erie Canal, Nellis Tavern, and Margaret Reaney Memorial Library are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Hempstead is a village located in the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 59,169 at the 2020 census, making it the most populous village in New York.

The Incorporated Village of Hempstead is the site of the seventeenth-century &quot;town spot&quot; from which English and Dutch settlers developed the Town of Hempstead, the Town of North Hempstead, and ultimately Nassau County. It is the largest community by population in both the Town of Hempstead and Nassau County.

Hofstra University is partially located in Hempstead.

== Etymology ==
Hempstead may have been named after Hemel Hempstead in the English county of Hertfordshire, where village founder John Carman was born. Another theory regarding the origin of the village&#x27;s name is that it is derived from the town of Heemstede in the Netherlands, as this was an area from which many Dutch settlers of New Netherland originated.

In 1664, the new settlement adopted the Duke&#x27;s Laws, an austere set of laws that became the basis upon which the laws of many colonies were to be founded. For a time, Hempstead became known as &quot;Old Blue,&quot; as a result of the blue laws.

== History ==
===Foundation===

The land on which the Village of Hempstead stands was under Dutch control from the early 1620s. In the fall of 1643, two followers of the Presbyterian minister Richard Denton, Robert Fordham and John Carman, crossed Long Island Sound by rowboat to negotiate with the local Native Americans for a tract of land upon which to establish a new community. Representatives of the Marsapeague (Massapequa), Mericock (Merrick), Matinecock and Rekowake (Rockaway) tribes met with the two men at a site slightly west of the current Denton Green in Hempstead Village. Tackapousha, who was the sachem (chief spokesman) of the Marsapeague, was the acknowledged spokesman for conducting the transaction. The Indians sold approximately 64,000 acres (260 km2), the present day towns of Hempstead and North Hempstead, for an unknown quantity of items; a 1657 revisit of this agreement names large and small cattle, stockings, wampum, hatchets, knives, trading cloth, powder, and lead given as payment by the English. Some items may have been valuable to the Native Americans in terms of the contemporary markets for European &quot;trinkets,&quot; which may have held symbolic and spiritual importance to Native America peoples in the Northeast.

In the spring of 1644, thirty to forty families left Stamford, Connecticut, crossed Long Island Sound, landed in Hempstead Harbor and eventually made their way to the present site of the village of Hempstead where they began their English settlement within Dutch-controlled New Netherland. The settling of Hempstead marked the beginnings of the oldest English settlement in what is now Nassau County. Subsequent trips across the Sound brought more settlers who prepared a fort here for their mutual protection. These original Hempstead settlers were Puritans in search of a place where they could more freely express their particular brand of Protestantism. They established a Presbyterian church that is the oldest continually active Presbyterian congregation in the nation. In 1843, Benjamin F. Thompson wrote and published a history of the village, and an account of contemporary Hempstead Village. Thompson reported that there were 200 dwellings, and 1,400 residents; that the village was connected to New York City by a turnpike and a railroad; that it had dry soil, excellent water, and pure air; and that it was the principal place of mercantile, and mechanical business, in the county. The village of Hempstead was incorporated on May 6, 1853, becoming the first community in Queens County (Nassau County did not exist as a separate county until 1899) to do so.

===Rise===
As the years passed, the population of Hempstead increased, as did its importance and prestige. Between 1703 and 1705, the newly formed St. George&#x27;s Church received a silver communion service from England&#x27;s Queen Anne.

During the American Revolution, Hempstead was a center of British sympathizers. The British attempted to occupy Hempstead after the Battle of Long Island, and used St. George&#x27;s as a headquarters as well as a place to worship. Judge Thomas Jones faulted a lax peace treaty for forcing the evacuation of the loyalists.

In the 19th century, Hempstead became increasingly important as a trading center for Long Island. In 1853 it became the first self-governing incorporated village. Many prominent families such as the Vanderbilts and the Belmonts built homes here, making Hempstead a center of Long Island society. Hempstead merchants established routes out to outlying farms and served as a distribution point for many firms. Wagons would leave Hempstead loaded with tobacco, candy, and cigarettes and return in a week to restock. Bakeries covered routes from Baldwin to Far Rockaway daily. Butchers ran routes to Seaford, Elmont, Valley Stream, Wantagh, East Meadow, Creedmoor, East Rockaway and Christian Hook. Drugs, medicines, perfumes, extracts, aprons, children&#x27;s coats and dresses and men&#x27;s clothes were peddled about the country by Hempstead merchants. People came from all sections of Queens to purchase stoves, and there were few places outside Hempstead where stoves could be purchased. Hempstead was the shopping center for Nassau County and the eastern portion of Queens, those settlements east of Jamaica before 1900 when Nassau County was established, following the creation of the City of Greater New York in 1898. Hempstead has historically been the center of commercial activity for the eastern counties of Long Island. In Nassau County, all major county roads emanate from this village. During the 18th and 19th centuries, all stagecoaches en route to eastern Long Island from Brooklyn passed through Hempstead. Today, seventeen bus routes and three interstate buses leave from the village every day. In addition, the Hempstead Branch of the Long Island Rail Road has its terminal here. At one time, there were three railroad companies with terminals within the village.

In March 1898, Camp Black was formed on the Hempstead Plains (roughly the shared location of Hempstead and Garden City), in support of the impending Spanish–American War. Camp Black was bounded on the north by Old Country Road, on the west by Clinton Road, and on the south by the Central Line rail. Camp Black was opened on April 29, 1898, as a training facility and a point of embarkation for troops.

Early Long Islanders made their living in agriculture or from the sea. Hempstead, with its central location, became the marketplace for the outlying rural farming communities. It was a natural progression, as the surrounding areas developed from small farms into today&#x27;s suburbia, that Hempstead Village would remain as the marketplace. Chain department stores such as Arnold Constable and Abraham &amp; Straus called Hempstead home for many years. Hempstead&#x27;s Abraham &amp; Straus was the largest grossing suburban department store in the country during the late 1960s. Hempstead was Nassau&#x27;s retail center during the 1940s through the 1960s. The advent of regional shopping malls such as the one at nearby Roosevelt Field, the demise of nearby Mitchel Air Force Base in 1961 as well as the changing demographics put the retail trade in the village into a downward spiral that it was unable to recover from during the recessions of the 1970s and 1980s. A plethora of businesses left the village in the 1980s and early 1990s, including Abraham &amp; Straus.

===Recent years===

In the course of the 1990s the village saw redevelopment as a government center as well as business center. There are more government employees from all levels of government in the village than there are in Mineola, the county seat. According to James York, the municipal historian, writing in 1998, the population during the day might rise to nearly 200,000, from a normal census of 50,000. Retailers&#x27; interest in the village was rekindled, due to the aggressive revitalization efforts of former Mayor James Garner, who served from 1989 to 2005, and former Community Development Agency Commissioner, Glen Spiritis, who served under Garner&#x27;s administration. Specifically, two large tracts of retail property have recently undergone redevelopment. The former Times Squares Stores (or TSS) property on Peninsula Boulevard and Franklin Street has been redeveloped as Hempstead Village Commons, a retail center. The former Abraham &amp; Straus department store on has recently undergone demolition and been replaced by a large retail development and many other smaller establishments. A considerable infusion of state and federal funding as well as private investment have enabled the replacement of blighted storefronts, complete commercial building rehabilitations and the development of affordable housing for the local population. The replacement of the 1913 Long Island Rail Road Hempstead Terminal with a modern facility was completed in 2002, and a four-story, 112-unit building for senior housing, with retail on the ground level was completed at Main and West Columbia Streets in January 1998. Thirty-two units of affordable townhouses known as Patterson Mews at Henry Street and Baldwin Road was completed and fully occupied in 1997.

In 1989, Hempstead residents elected James A. Garner as their mayor. He was the first Black or African-American mayor ever elected to office on Long Island, and he served for four consecutive terms. Subsequently, Wayne Hall, a former Village of Hempstead trustee who is also African American, served as mayor for three terms, from 2005 to 2017.

The first African-American male judge, Lance Clarke, was elected in 2001. Cynthia Diaz-Wilson was the first female justice in the Village of Hempstead and first African American village justice in the state of New York.

In recent years, there has been concern regarding ongoing gang activity in certain neighborhoods, notably the &quot;Heights&quot;, in addition to the issue of illegal rentals (homes/apartments that are illegally-subdivided by slumlords) and racial steering. Hempstead was also one of the first Long Island communities to contend with the Salvadoran gang, MS-13. The continual intra-violence this gang has exhibited has led to the formation of their arch-rivals, &quot;SWP&quot; or &quot;Salvadorans with Pride&quot;. These issues have contributed to Hempstead&#x27;s high crime rate as compared to other communities in the area.

A 2019 investigation by &quot;Newsday&quot; revealed widespread racial discrimination by real estate agents on Long Island, including in Hempstead.
