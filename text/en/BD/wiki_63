<text>Alaska Airlines is a major American airline headquartered in SeaTac, Washington, within the Seattle metropolitan area. It is the sixth-largest airline in North America when measured by scheduled passengers carried, as of 2023. Alaska, together with its regional partners Horizon Air and SkyWest Airlines operates a route network primarily focused on connecting cities along the West Coast of the United States to over 100 destinations in Alaska, Hawaii, the contiguous United States, the Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Mexico.

The airline operates out of five hubs. Its primary hub is Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. Alaska Airlines is a member of Oneworld, the third-largest airline alliance in the world. As of 2020, the airline employs over 16,000 people and has been ranked by J. D. Power as having the highest customer satisfaction of the traditional airlines for twelve consecutive years. In December 2023, Alaska Airlines announced plans to buy Hawaiian Airlines in a $1.9 billion deal. On August 19, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice completed its regulatory review of the proposed merger and declined to file a lawsuit to block it. The merger received the approval of the U.S. Department of Transportation on September 17, 2024, and was completed the following day.

==History==
===Early years (1932–1945)===

McGee Airways, a precursor to Alaska Airlines, was established by Linious &quot;Mac&quot; McGee and flew its first service between Anchorage and Bristol Bay. Service was unscheduled, with flights taking off when passengers, a load of cargo, or mail needed passage.

The airline struggled financially during the Great Depression. Too many airlines were in Anchorage at the time, with not enough demand to support them. As a result, the airline underwent multiple mergers. The first of these mergers was in 1934, when McGee sold his namesake airline for to Star Air Service, an airline also located in Anchorage. This allowed McGee to enter the mining industry. With a fleet of 15 aircraft, Star Air Service was a dominant airline in Alaska, but the airline continued to struggle financially because of high maintenance costs for its wood-and-fabric planes.

In 1937, McGee came back to the airline and opened a liquor store, and the airline began flying liquor to remote Alaskan communities. That year, Star Air Service purchased Alaska Interior Airlines and was incorporated as Star Air Lines. Star was again sold later that year to a group of miners.

In 1938, federal regulation began when Congress created the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), which awarded the airline most of the routes that it wanted in Alaska, but the coveted route between Seattle and Fairbanks was awarded to Pan American Airways.

In 1941, Star Air Service was purchased by Raymond Marshall, a businessman from New York City. In 1942, the airline purchased three other airlines in Alaska, including Lavery Air Service, Mirow Air Service, and Pollack Flying Service. They also purchased a hangar at the Anchorage airport. In 1942, the airline&#x27;s name was changed to Alaska Star Airlines.

When the United States entered World War II in December 1941, Alaska Airlines faced a shortage of pilots. During the war, the airline lacked funds and equipment, and pilots were often forced to buy fuel for their planes out of their own pockets. The company, which was frequently subjected to lawsuits, also went through many different presidents during this time. In 1943, Alaska Airlines purchased the Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar, its first multi-engine aircraft. That same year, the company&#x27;s stock was traded for the first time on the American Stock Exchange.

The name Alaska Airlines was adopted on May 2, 1944, having narrowly beaten a competitor who was applying for the name. In the 1940s, Alaska&#x27;s headquarters were in Anchorage.

===Expansion after World War II (1945–1949)===

In 1945, Alaska Airlines hired its first stewardesses. In 1947, James Wooten became president of the airline and began an effort to expand the company. Under his leadership, the airline purchased many surplus military aircraft from the government that had been used during World War II. The airline purchased Douglas DC-3s, Douglas DC-4s, and Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commandos. Alaska Airlines was the first carrier certified to operate DC-3s on skis.

Alaska Airlines&#x27; large charter business made it profitable, and the airline moved its base of operations to Paine Field, an airport, in Everett, Washington, north of Seattle. It kept a branch office in Anchorage. Despite its success, Alaska Airlines&#x27; worldwide charter business was short-lived. In 1949, the CAB tightened its regulations and placed heavy fines on the airline, shutting down the charter service completely for safety violations, and president James Wooten left the company. Also in 1949, Alaska Air began operating five Bell 47B helicopters to support oil exploration on the North Slope thus becoming the first airline in Alaska to operate rotary-wing aircraft.

In 1949, the airline was a major participant in an effort by the newly established state of Israel to airlift Jews out of Yemen to Israel in what became known as Operation Magic Carpet. C-46 or DC-4 aircraft were used for the nearly 3,000-mile flight, made necessary to avoid overflying Arab nations. Planes flew from Eritrea to Aden, then along the Gulf of Aqaba to Tel Aviv. After unloading the refugees, crews then immediately continued to Cyprus, afraid to stay on the ground in Tel Aviv for fear of being bombed. Some 49,000 Yemenite Jews were airlifted by Alaska Airlines and other carriers without a single loss of life.

===New leadership (1950s)===
Alaska Airlines started the 1950s without its worldwide charter business and operations restricted to the state of Alaska. In 1950, it purchased two smaller Alaskan airlines, Collins Air Service and Al Jones Airways.

Though the airline had grown much under the ownership of Raymond Marshall, the CAB forced him out in 1951 due to continuing financial troubles. Marshall had owned Alaska Airlines with the intent of getting money for himself and he was not concerned about the long-term stability of the company. In 1951, the CAB awarded Alaska Airlines with a temporary certificate allowing them to operate on routes from the Alaskan cities of Anchorage and Fairbanks to Seattle and Portland in the contiguous United States. This award became permanent in 1957.

In 1952, the CAB appointed Nelson David as president, and he began to improve the financial stability of the airline. By 1957, with the carrier in a better financial situation, David left and Charles Willis Jr., became the company&#x27;s new president and CEO. A pilot during World War II, Willis introduced several marketing gimmicks that set the airline apart from other ones of the day; namely, under his leadership, Alaska Airlines became the first to show inflight movies. The company began service with the Douglas DC-6, the airline&#x27;s first pressurized plane, enabling flights above clouds and weather disturbances. On these DC-6s, the airline introduced &quot;Golden Nugget&quot; service, which included an on-board saloon and piano.

===Jet age (1960s)===

In 1961, competitors began introducing jets on routes Alaska Airlines flew. To counter this competition, Willis negotiated with aircraft manufacturer Convair to purchase a Convair 880 jetliner with no money down, for use on routes between Alaska and the contiguous United States. The company introduced the new jet aircraft in 1961. In 1966 the company received its first Boeing 727-100 jets. They removed the Convair 880 from the fleet as a financing condition by Boeing concerning the purchase of the 727 jetliners. Several of Alaska&#x27;s first 727s were series 100C models, which could be operated as all-cargo freighters, an all-passenger configuration or as mixed passenger/freight combi aircraft.

In the spring of 1967, greatly increased passenger loads required a quick addition of fleet aircraft. Alaska purchased a Convair 990 jetliner, formerly operated by Brazilian air carrier Varig as PP-VJE, which then became Alaska Airlines N987AS. This aircraft remained in service along with an increased fleet of Boeing 727-100s. They were joined by stretched Boeing 727-200s which became Alaska Airlines&#x27; signature aircraft for the next 25 years. It became the first carrier to fly the Lockheed L-100 Hercules L382 model, the civil version of the military C-130 cargo turboprop, which was used to transport oil drilling rigs to Alaska&#x27;s North Slope and later to Ecuador.

Alaska also owned Lockheed Constellation propliners including two Lockheed L-1649A Starliners from 1962 to 1968, and three L-1049&#x27;s which were used for Military Air Transport Service operations. Smaller prop and turboprop aircraft were operated, including the Convair 240, de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and Super Catalina amphibian aircraft as well as two versions of the Grumman Goose amphibian aircraft, one with piston engines and the other model is a conversion to turboprop engines which the airline called the &quot;Turbo-Goose&quot;. The Catalina and Grumman amphibian seaplane aircraft joined the fleet when the airline acquired local southeast Alaska operator Alaska Coastal Airlines in 1968.

During this time, Alaska Air faced some tough competition from other airlines, such as Northwest Airlines, Pan Am, and Pacific Northern Airlines, an Alaska-based air carrier operating Boeing 720 jetliners that was acquired by and merged into Western Airlines in 1967. Northwest and Pan Am at different times operated Boeing 747 wide-body jetliners on their services to Alaska with Northwest flying Seattle–Anchorage nonstop with the jumbo jet and Pan Am flying Seattle–Fairbanks nonstop with the 747. To set itself apart from the competition, Alaska Air turned to some cheap but imaginative gimmicks such as having safety instructions read as rhymes, staging fashion shows in the aisles, and having bingo games on board while en route.

In December 1962, Air Guinée signed a contract with Alaska Airlines, which had Alaska Airlines providing management expertise, in addition to two Douglas DC-4s. The deal would have had Alaska Airlines contracting with the airline over seven years. The contract ended after six months, leading to the United States Agency for International Development paying a US$700,000 debt owed by the Guinean airline to Alaska Airlines.

In 1965, Alaska Airlines turned over some routes between small Alaskan communities, and some smaller aircraft, to Wien Air Alaska. This allowed Alaska to focus on more heavily travelled routes and allowed them to sell off smaller aircraft.

Throughout the 1960s, Alaska Airlines worked to promote tourism to Alaska by offering charter flights to the continental United States. In an attempt to increase the state&#x27;s appeal, Alaska Airlines conducted a promotional tour of Japan in 1963. In 1967, as the state of Alaska celebrated its centennial, Alaska Airlines introduced a promotional &quot;Gay Nineties&quot; theme with stewardesses dressed in Edwardian outfits. That year, Alaska Airlines expanded to southeast Alaska with the introduction of service to Sitka. This led to the purchase of two smaller airlines, Alaska Coastal Airlines and Cordova Airlines, in 1968.

===Economic hardship (1970s)===
In the beginning of the 1970s, Alaska Airlines began Boeing 707 charter flights to Siberia in the Soviet Union. This was the result of three years of secret negotiations between Alaska Airlines and Soviet authorities, in which the US Department of State reluctantly chose not to block the plan for fear of a potentially negative response from the Soviets. The airline gained permission to fly more than two dozen flights in 1970, 1971, and 1972. Alaska Airlines was also operating Boeing 707, Boeing 720, and Boeing 720B jetliners in scheduled passenger service between destinations in Alaska and Seattle during the early and mid 1970s.

Like much of the airline industry at the time, Alaska Airlines was hit with rising fuel and operating costs and was on the verge of bankruptcy. Additionally, revenues were significantly reduced when work on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System was delayed. The airline&#x27;s cargo aircraft had played a key role in building the pipeline, but now sat idle. The airline took another blow on September 4, 1971, when a Boeing 727-100 jetliner crashed on landing in Juneau, killing 111 people and resulting in America&#x27;s worst single-plane crash at the time. Because the airline was struggling financially, Alaska Airlines&#x27; board ousted president and CEO Charles Willis. Former board member Ronald Cosgrave succeeded him.

The airline was million in debt when Cosgrave took over, resulting in major cuts. The airline&#x27;s cargo business was dropped completely, as were many flights and employees. Cosgrave also sought to improve the airline&#x27;s tarnished image of &quot;Elastic Airlines&quot;, referring to its poor schedule keeping. The logo was changed to an image of a smiling Inuk man, which remains today. Although the exact identity of the man is unknown, some believe it to be the face of either Chester Seveck, a reindeer herder in Kotzebue, or Oliver Amouak, an Inupiat man. Both were Alaskan natives. As a result of these efforts, the airline made a profit in 1973 and continued to be profitable thereafter.

===Post-deregulation expansion (1978–1990)===
Alaska Airlines was one of only three US carriers that supported the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act, knowing that it would reap significant growth and other benefits from deregulation. After deregulation, the company&#x27;s real-estate division was spun off into its own company, with Cosgrave becoming its chairman. The leadership of the airline was passed to Bruce Kennedy, a close associate of Cosgrave. Cosgrave allied with Alaska Airlines to purchase competitor Wien Air Alaska. This ultimately failed and resulted in fines for Alaska Air and its leaders for improprieties during the attempted acquisition. Wien Air was liquidated in 1984, and never merged into Alaska Airlines.

At the time of deregulation, Alaska Airlines served ten cities in Alaska and one in the contiguous US—the city of Seattle—and it had only ten planes in its fleet. Immediately after deregulation, the airline began to expand, adding the cities of Portland and San Francisco to its network. Soon later, the airline resumed services to the Alaskan cities Nome and Kotzebue, and it introduced service to Palm Springs, California. Burbank and Ontario were added in 1981. In 1979, Alaska studied the possibility of acquiring and merging with Hughes Air West, but the plan never went through. By 1985, the airline had also added service to Oakland and San Jose in California, Spokane in Washington, Boise in Idaho, and Phoenix and Tucson in Arizona.

Deregulation also brought challenges to the airline. The airline was faced with increased competition and inflation that put tremendous pressure on costs, profits, and salaries. By 1979, competitors Northwest Airlines and Western Airlines were both flying wide-body McDonnell Douglas DC-10 jets on the core Anchorage–Seattle nonstop route. Additional competition came from Wien Air Alaska, which had begun flying nonstop jet service between Anchorage and Seattle. Northwest was operating nonstop DC-10 service on the Fairbanks–Seattle route at this time as well. There were tensions with unions, particularly mechanics and flight attendants. In 1985, the company had a three-month-long strike with its machinists. By June 1985, it was able to end the strike by promising to reduce labor costs and maintain peace with unions. In November 1985, the airline introduced a daily air-freight service called &quot;Gold Streak&quot;, with service to and from Alaska.

In the 1980s, Alaska Airlines began acquiring McDonnell Douglas MD-80s to replace its aging 727s. Alaska was the launch customer for the MD-83, taking delivery of its first MD-80s in 1985.

Also in 1985, the Alaska Air Group was formed as a holding company for Alaska Airlines. In 1986 Alaska Air Group acquired regional airline Horizon Air, which remained a separate brand from Alaska Airlines. Since then, both airlines have been subsidiaries of Alaska Air Group. In 1987, Alaska Airlines purchased Jet America Airlines. Alaska initially operated Jet America as a separate airline, but this proved economically unviable and Jet America&#x27;s operations were merged into Alaska&#x27;s. Alaska discontinued all flights to the Midwest and the East coast formerly operated by Jet America. Additional MD-80s entered the fleet via the acquisition of Jet America Airlines in 1987.

To compensate for a major seasonal imbalance in travel to Alaska (mostly taking place in the summer), the airline introduced service to Mexican resort cities, where most travel takes place in the winter. In 1988, the airline began servicing the Mexican resort cities of Mazatlán and Puerto Vallarta. By the end of the 1980s, 70 percent of Alaska Airlines&#x27; passengers flew south of Seattle and the airline served 30 cities in 6 states outside Alaska.

===New competition, new technologies (1990s)===

The airline began the 1990s with plans to lease 24 Boeing 737-400s from International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC). The first aircraft was delivered in April 1992.

In 1991, Alaska Airlines added several routes. In the Russian Far East, it added the cities of Magadan and Khabarovsk, as well as service to Toronto, its first Canadian city and the first city east of the Rocky Mountains. Toronto was later dropped in 1992 and the Russian destinations were discontinued in 1998.

As the airline marked its 19th consecutive year of profits in a turbulent industry and racked up many awards for customer service, Bruce Kennedy retired in May 1991 and was succeeded by Raymond J. Vecci.

During this time, Alaska Airlines faced increased competition from low-cost carriers, namely MarkAir. Since it began operating in 1984, competition had been reduced due to feeder agreements with Alaska Airlines. However, after Alaska Air declined to buy the airline in the fall of 1991, competition with Alaska intensified. MarkAir offered low-cost service on the Anchorage-Seattle route and other routes in Alaska, where Alaska Airlines earned almost one-third of its revenues. For the first time in 20 years, it posted a loss of million. 

To save money, the airline canceled two proposed maintenance facilities and deferred a large aircraft purchase worth billion. Deferred maintenance from this period of cost-cutting would ultimately cause the crash of Flight 261 in 2000, but at the time, this increased the usability of their fleet, and as a result, revenue. The deferred maintenance also cut labor costs, saving the airline money but increasing tensions between the airline and labor unions. The cost reductions produced quick results. In 1993, their losses decreased to million and they made a million profit the next year. Eight percent of these revenues were generated by record-setting cargo operations.

Alaska had more competition in 1993 when low-cost airline Southwest Airlines entered the Pacific Northwest by purchasing Morris Air. Alaska Airlines was able to keep its costs down, but it maintained its high level of customer service. The airline promoted itself as &quot;the last great airline&quot; and with the motto &quot;For the same price, you just get more&quot;. Analysts felt that Alaska Air needed deeper cost cuts. At the same time, the company had many strikes by the flight attendants&#x27; union. Ultimately, Vecci was dismissed in 1995 and replaced with John Kelly, the former Horizon Air CEO. The airline soon expanded West Coast routes to take advantage of an &quot;open skies&quot; agreement between the US and Canada.

Alaska continued to take delivery of new MD-83s during the 1990s, both to meet the demands of a growing route system and to replace its aging and fuel inefficient 727 fleets. Their last 727 was retired in March 1994. The airline&#x27;s MD-80 fleet peaked at 44 aircraft in 1996.

Alaska Airlines pioneered some new technologies through the 1990s. It added a heads-up guidance system in 1989 to operate better in foggy conditions, becoming the first airline to use this technology. In 1995, the airline became the first U.S. airline to sell tickets on the Internet. By 2000, all the airline&#x27;s planes carried automated external defibrillators, for use in in-flight emergencies. The airline installed self-service kiosks called &quot;Instant Travel Machines&quot; that printed boarding passes, allowing customers to bypass the traditional ticket counter. An X-ray device, an addition to the unit allowing passengers to check their own baggage was being tested in 1999 at Anchorage.

This concept, known as &quot;Airport of the Future&quot; by the airline, was first tested in Anchorage and was later brought to its Seattle hub, and it drew attention from other airlines. The airline was the first airline in the world to integrate GPS and Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) technology, adding a real-time, three-dimensional display of terrain. The system was operational in all the carrier&#x27;s Boeing 737-400s by April 1999.

The late 1990s saw the carrier recording much profitability. The airline added new training and maintenance facilities. The airline began buying new 737s, ordering three Boeing 737-700s and became the launch customer for the Boeing 737-900 when it placed an order for ten of the jets in November 1997.

===Introducing flights across the U.S. (2000s)===
With the delivery of Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft starting in 1999, Alaska began launching more medium-haul flights. In 2000, Alaska started service between Anchorage and Chicago.

In May 2001, the airline took delivery of its first 737-900. In 2001, the airline was granted slot exemptions by the Department of Transportation to operate a nonstop flight from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport to Seattle, but it was halted after only a week due to the September 11 attacks. The airline resumed service to Reagan Airport on December 4, 2001, to meet the demand.

In January 2002, William Ayer was named CEO of Alaska Airlines. Ayer had been serving as president under Kelly since 1997, having come to Alaska from Horizon two years earlier after spending 13 years with the smaller airline. Ayer took over as chairman and CEO of the Alaska in 2002 upon Kelly&#x27;s retirement. He led the company through a transformation called &quot;Alaska 2010&quot; that was intended to insulate the airline from the traditional boom-bust cycle of the airline industry.

In 2003, Alaska Airlines won the Technology Leadership Award from the magazine &quot;Air Transport World&quot; for its pioneering of new technologies both in the airport and within the airplane itself.

In 2005, due to the greater efficiency of the Boeing 737 Next Generation and rising costs for maintenance, fuel, and crew training, Alaska Airlines decided to phase out its remaining 26 MD-80s and trained its pilots to fly the newer Boeing 737-800s that were being ordered to replace them. According to the airline, the MD-80 burned of fuel per hour, while the 737-800 burned just per hour. The last MD-80 flights flew in August 2008, with one flight from San Jose to Seattle and another from Sacramento to Seattle. To mark its transition to an all-Boeing fleet, Alaska Airlines unveiled a 737-800 called &quot;Spirit of Seattle&quot; with Boeing&#x27;s house colors painted on the fuselage and the airline&#x27;s Inuit logo painted on the tail fin.

Also in 2005, Alaska Airlines contracted out many of its jobs, including ground crew positions, to Menzies Aviation. In some cases, this resulted in an almost 40% decline in wages. This agreement was found to be a violation of union agreements in 2008 and the new ground crews caused enough damage to aircraft in the first year to make the savings negligible. In addition, Menzies contractors gained a reputation of stealing from checked bags after a few incidents in 2007.

Starting in June 2006, Alaska Airlines introduced new cargo aircraft to the fleet: five 737-400C combi aircraft and one 737-400F freighter. The aircraft were originally purchased by Alaska as passenger aircraft in 1992, and converted by Pemco Air Services. The 737-400C &quot;combi&quot; aircraft were uniquely suited for the needs of Alaska, carrying a combination of four cargo pallets and 72 passengers, allowing goods and people to be transported to remote towns. 737-400 based aircraft had 20% more passenger and cargo capacity than the aging Boeing 737-200 cargo aircraft they replaced.

===2010s===

In March 2010, Alaska Airlines began service from San Jose, California, to Kahului and Kona, Hawaii, and also from Sacramento, California, to Kahului, Hawaii.

In September 2010, Alaska Airlines began service between Seattle and Lambert-St. Louis International Airport.

In 2011, Horizon Air no longer operated as a separate regional airline. Instead, it transitioned to a capacity purchase agreement (CPA) business model, which had by that time become the regional airline industry standard. Under the CPA, Horizon operates and maintains its aircraft, while Alaska Airlines is responsible for scheduling, marketing and pricing all flights. As part of the change to the new business model, the Horizon Air brand was retired and all Horizon planes were repainted with a co-branded &quot;&quot; livery.

Alaska Airlines entered into a similar capacity purchase agreement with the nation&#x27;s largest regional airline, SkyWest Airlines. Starting in May 2011, SkyWest started operating several routes for Alaska under the brand &quot;Alaska SkyWest&quot;.

In January 2011, Alaska Airlines placed an order for thirteen Boeing 737-900ERs to be delivered between 2012 and 2014, with two 737-800s also part of the order.
In 2011, Alaska Airlines partnered with Boeing and Fujitsu to be the first to use a new technology called Component Management Optimization to streamline maintenance checks. It allows mechanics to point a handheld device at little RFID tags attached to certain parts of the aircraft, which will display information about when parts were last replaced. This will allow mechanics to perform inspections quicker than conventional methods. The program is scheduled to launch in 2012.

In mid 2011, the airline issued iPads to its pilots to replace 25 pounds of paper flight manuals that pilots were required to carry on flights (Electronic flight bag). Alaska Airlines is the first major airline to use iPads on flights. All pilots had iPads by June 2011. This was the first part of the airline&#x27;s initiative to do away with the flight bag. The airline is considering using iPads for displaying aeronautical charts.

In November 2011, Alaska Airlines flew 75 commercial passenger flights in the U.S. powered by biofuel, using a 20 percent blend of sustainable biofuel made from used cooking oil that meets rigorous international safety and sustainability standards.

On February 16, 2012, Alaska Airlines&#x27; CEO, Bill Ayer, retired. Ayer became the airline&#x27;s CEO in 2002 and has been credited with reducing costs and keeping the airline profitable without going through bankruptcy. The airline&#x27;s president Brad Tilden became the new CEO on May 15, 2012.

In March 2012, Alaska Airlines began service from Seattle to Kansas City and in June 2012, began service to Philadelphia. Seattle-Tacoma-Miami International Airport flights ended in July 2012. Service to nearby Fort Lauderdale began on July 16. Service to San Antonio began in September 2012. Alaska Airlines began service from San Diego to Orlando in October 2012.

In , Alaska placed the largest order in its history, when it ordered a total of 50 Boeing 737s in a deal worth billion at list prices. The order consists of 20 737 MAX 8s, 17 737 MAX 9s and 13 737-900ERs.

Alaska Airlines announced a plan in June 2013 to begin replacing Boeing 737s on flights between Fairbanks and Anchorage, Alaska, with Bombardier Q400s operated by Horizon Air and based out of Anchorage beginning in March 2014. The plan was intended to reduce operating expenses and eventually lower fares. It was met with a great deal of skepticism by Fairbanks residents who expressed their frustration about the safety of the aircraft and outside boarding in the cold winter climate through social media. Alaska Airlines responded to the comments on Facebook attempting to reassure passengers of the safety of the Bombardier Q400s as well as promising to address the unusual aspects of flying in Alaska. The airline ended up modifying one of the jetways at Fairbanks International Airport so that passengers would not have to go outside to board. In November 2017, Alaska announced that it would revert to an all-jet service in the state of Alaska and that it would close its Horizon Airbase in Anchorage in March 2018. Horizon would re-establish its presence in the state of Alaska two years later, this time flying Embraer 175 aircraft.

New nonstop service from Seattle to Salt Lake City began in 2013 and from Seattle to Albuquerque, Baltimore, Detroit, New Orleans, Tampa, and Cancun all began in 2014. Several other routes were later added from Salt Lake City in a competitive move against Delta Air Lines when that carrier added many new routes from Seattle.

In 2015, Alaska Airlines announced three new nonstop destinations from Seattle, to Charleston, Nashville, and Raleigh-Durham. These, along with a flight between Los Angeles and Baltimore, began in late 2015 using their 737 aircraft.

In January 2016, for the first time in 25 years, Alaska Airlines unveiled a major update to its brand, which included a new logo and livery. In the new design, the Alaska wordmark was streamlined and the design of the Eskimo logo was simplified and the ruffs on the parka were made more colorful.

In 2017, Alaska Airlines expanded to Indianapolis, with non-stop service to Seattle in May and San Francisco in September. The San Francisco route was discontinued in September 2018.

In September 2018, Alaska Airlines added non-stop service from Seattle to Pittsburgh.

==== Virgin America acquisition and subsequent lawsuits ====
Virgin America, an airline based out of the San Francisco Bay Area, launched in 2005 and quickly drew a cult-like following. But as a growing startup airline, the airline would take several years to pay back start-up and expansion costs. Virgin&#x27;s original investors wanted fast returns on their investments, so they took the airline public, trading on Nasdaq in November 2014. As the airline saw growing profits year after year, a frenzy ensued, and the airline&#x27;s stock price climbed from $23 at time of IPO to nearly $30 per share within a just a year.

Not long after Virgin America&#x27;s successful IPO launch, JetBlue announced their intention to buy controlling interest in Virgin America. The two airlines had complimentary networks on opposite sides of the country and operated similar aircraft types in a similar market. Alaska viewed its acquisition of Virgin America as a start to expanding in California and the West Coast. After the acquisition was announced, Richard Branson, the head of the Virgin Group and one of the founders of Virgin America, described himself as &quot;sad&quot; and disappointed. Despite the protest from its most high-profile shareholder, the majority of Virgin America&#x27;s shareholders voted to approve the sale to Alaska Air Group because of the higher offer than that of JetBlue.

Alaska Air Group purchased Virgin America for $57 per share, a total valuation of $2.6 billion, with additional expenses bringing the cost to approximately $4 billion. The acquisition was completed on December 14, 2016.

The DOT issued a single operating certificate for the combined airlines in January 2018. The airlines merged into the same passenger service system in April 2018, meaning that most of the customer-facing portions of the company, including flight numbers, website, mobile apps, and airport check-in kiosks, have a single brand: Alaska Airlines. Virgin America&#x27;s final flight was in April 2018. The last Virgin America aircraft was repainted in June 2019.

The acquisition created one issue for the enlarged Group: Alaska operates an all-Boeing 737 fleet of aircraft, but Virgin America operated an all-Airbus fleet. Even though the 737 and A320 family jets are designed to operate in the same segment – short-to-medium-range segment of up to 200 passengers – the two jets are very different in terms of operation, and anyone wishing to change from a 737 to an Airbus A320 family jet (or vice versa) needs to go through a lengthy training course, a costly process for the airline. The first Airbus leases expired in 2019, with the rest expiring between 2021 and 2024. In April 2020, in response to route suspensions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, Alaska grounded 19 inherited Virgin America aircraft, with 12 permanently retired and the other 7 unlikely to return to service. The airline is using pandemic-related flight reductions as an opportunity to retrain many Airbus pilots to fly the Boeing 737 instead.

=== 2020s ===
Due to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Alaska Airlines announced that it would be reducing its number of employees by 30%. By the end of 2020, the firm cut out around 7,000 job positions out of its 23,000 total.

In February 2020, Alaska Airlines announced its intention to join the Oneworld airline alliance. On March 31, 2021, Alaska Airlines officially joined the Oneworld alliance, adding seven new airline partners, including Iberia, Malaysia Airlines, Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Royal Jordanian, S7 Airlines, and SriLankan Airlines.

In December 2020, Alaska Airlines agreed to buy 23 Boeing 737 MAX 9 jets.

In November 2021, Alaska Airlines launched seasonal service to Belize, making it the fourth foreign country served by the airline.

In August 2022, Alaska Airlines was reported to be an investor in Twelve, a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) start up and chemical technology company based in Berkeley, California, that aims to make fuel out of carbon dioxide instead of things like organic vegetable oils, which would supposedly be cheaper than existing SAF production. Twelve&#x27;s E-Jet fuel would have 90% lower emissions than conventional fuel but not require changing existing aircraft. At proper scale, it would be cost competitive with existing fuel and help allow Alaska Airlines to meet emissions goals.

In October 2022, Alaska Airlines announced an agreement with Boeing to purchase 52 additional Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, the airline&#x27;s largest aircraft order thus far.

In May 2022, Alaska Airlines removed their inflight magazine, &quot;Alaska Beyond,&quot; and moved to an airline blog due to COVID-19 cleaning procedures.

In January 2023, Alaska Airlines announced that it had officially dropped plastic cups from its inflight food and beverage services, becoming the first U.S. airline to do so. It said that the move is part of plans to replace its top five waste-producing items from onboard services by 2025.

In 2023, Alaska Airlines announced a partnership with Taiwan-based Starlux Airlines. Mokulele Airlines, a small commuter airline in Hawaii, and its parent company, Southern Airways Express, both became partner airlines in 2023. Porter Airlines, a Canadian airline, became a partner before starting service from Toronto to San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas. A partnership with Kenmore Air was resumed in 2023, first introduced in 2010. Flights from Everett to the San Juan Islands became bookable on Alaska Airlines&#x27; website.

Alaska Airlines announced nonstop service to Guatemala and the Bahamas in June and July 2023. Bahamasair was announced as a partner airline at the same time service to the Bahamas was revealed.

On April 17, 2024, the FAA announced a ground stop advisory for Alaska Airlines, stopping all of the airline&#x27;s flights. The FAA did not announce a reason for this.

=== Acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines ===

In December 2023, Alaska Airlines announced that it would merge with Hawaiian Airlines for $1.9 billion in cash along with an assumption of approximately $900 million in outstanding debt. Airline industry analysts had promoted the merger for years which would create a combined carrier focused on the western United States. The merger would provide Alaska, which is primarily a domestic carrier with narrow-body aircraft, with Hawaiian&#x27;s wide-body jets, pilots, and international networks.

The merger would retain both Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines as separate brands; Hawaiian Airlines would also become a Oneworld member. The two airlines intend to operate a combined frequent-flyer program, with Alaska&#x27;s Mileage Plan likely to replace HawaiianMiles unless the companies opt for an all-new program. The proposed merger was approved by shareholders of Hawaiian Airlines in April 2024, following earlier approval from both Alaska Air Group and Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.

Under President Biden, the U.S. Department of Justice has worked to prevent further consolidation in the airline industry but it was initially unclear whether the department would file suit against the merger, with analysts noting differences between the proposal and prior proposals opposed by the administration. The main area of regulatory concern is likely to be that the deal would put about 40% of the traffic between Hawaii and the mainland U.S. in one company&#x27;s hands. When the deal was announced, company executives expected approval from the Justice Department to take between a year and 18 months. On August 19, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice completed its regulatory antitrust review of the proposed acquisition and declined to attempt to block the merger in court. The merger next requires the approval of the U.S. Department of Transportation.

At the time, the companies overlapped on 12 nonstop routes which they described as minimal. Alaska Airlines emphasized its experience operating an intra-Alaska network including service to 16 destinations not reachable by road while pledging to maintain a robust interisland schedule in Hawaii to neighbor islands. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; speculated that consolidation would lead to higher prices for consumers on flights to Hawaii although this was disputed by the companies.

When the merger was announced, Gov. Josh Green (HI) promised that he and the attorney general Anne Lopez would monitor the merger &quot;very closely&quot; adding that both &quot;are very high-quality companies, but ultimately, I will be watching to make sure all of our state&#x27;s needs are met and all of our workers are cared for.&quot; As part of its effort to garner local support for the merger, Alaska Airlines made three key promises to Hawaii residents to maintain the Hawaiian airlines brand, keep all front-line union employees, and protect neighbor island flights. In February 2024, Richard Bissen (mayor of Maui County), Rick Blangiardi (mayor of the City and County of Honolulu), Derek Kawakami (mayor of Kauai County), and Mitch Roth (mayor of Hawaiʻi County) published an open letter in the &quot;Honolulu Star-Advertiser&quot; declaring their support for the merger as &quot;good for Hawaiʻi&quot; and enhancing service to neighbor islands.

Alaska Airlines has confirmed that miles held in Hawaiian&#x27;s HawaiianMiles frequent-flyer program would be converted to the Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan scheme at a 1:1 ratio.

In August 2024, the regulatory review period ended without issue, a week after Alaska had agreed to extend that review period. The news effectively gave Alaska DOJ approval for the deal. Alaska called it &quot;a significant milestone in the process to join our airlines.&quot; On September 17, 2024, the final regulatory hurtle for the merger was cleared when the United States Department of Transportation approved of the merger. The carriers stated they expected to close the deal in the days following this approval. On September 18, 2024, the merger was completed, following an agreement with the U.S. Department of Transportation. As part of the deal, both airlines committed to maintaining key routes in Hawaii and upholding consumer protections for the next six years.

==Destinations==


Alaska&#x27;s route system spans more than 115 destinations in the United States, Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Mexico. Some of the locations served in Alaska include Anchorage, Adak, Cordova, Fairbanks, Juneau, Ketchikan, Kodiak, Kotzebue, King Salmon, Nome, Prudhoe Bay, Sitka, and Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), several of which are inaccessible by road.

The airline began scheduled operations to the Russian Far East in 1991 following the breakup of the Soviet Union, but suspended the service in 1998 following the 1998 Russian financial crisis.

Alaska has historically been one of the largest carriers on the West Coast of the United States, with strong presences in Anchorage, Seattle, Portland, and San Diego, and serving four airports in the Bay Area and four airports in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

Some cities in Alaska&#x27;s network with less traffic are served by regional airline partners under a capacity purchase agreement. Under that agreement, the regional airline is paid to operate and maintain aircraft used on flights that are scheduled and marketed by Alaska Airlines. Alaska&#x27;s airline partners include wholly-owned regional subsidiary Horizon Air and carrier SkyWest Airlines.

On 11 December 2024, it was reported that Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines are teaming up to offer two new routes from Seattle to Tokyo and Seoul beginning 12 May 2025. This collaboration marks the first long-haul route using Hawaiian Airlines&#x27; wide-body jet, Airbus A330-200 since their US$1.9 billion merger in September 2024.

===In-flight services===
====Meals and beverages====

In 2006, the airline launched its buy on board meal program, on most flights over 2 ½ hours. As part of the program, the airline offers various &quot;Picnic Packs&quot; for a charge in Premium Class and Main Cabin. Picnic packs feature products from West Coast companies including Beecher&#x27;s Cheese, Tillamook Cheese, Tim&#x27;s Cascade potato chips and Alaskan Amber beer.

In February 2012, Alaska Airlines started serving coffee from fellow Seattle company Starbucks on all of its flights. Previously Starbucks coffee was only offered on Horizon Air flights. Horizon Air had offered Starbucks coffee since February 1990 and was the first airline in the world to serve Starbucks coffee onboard its flights. In 2023, Alaska changed to serving coffee from Portland-based Stumptown Coffee Roasters.

In July 2018, Alaska Airlines updated much of the First Class menu inspired by the airlines&#x27; West Coast presence. New items served included Oregon&#x27;s Salt and Straw Caramel Ribbon Ice Cream, brownies from Los Angeles-based Sweet Lady Jane, and pasta from Cucina Fresca, based in Seattle. New features included ordering food before flights to allow for meals ready upon seating.

====In-flight internet access====
All Alaska Airlines jets are equipped with an in-flight Wi-Fi and streaming entertainment system. It had been announced that soon internet access service will move to a flat $8 charge per flight, but that change only applies to the satellite WiFi-based aircraft. On the older systems, internet service is still fee-based for all passengers, depending on the length of the flight. Streaming entertainment and electronic messaging services are free.

Alaska launched trials of In-flight Wi-Fi Internet service in 2009. The airline tested both the Row44 satellite-based system, before picking the land-based Gogo Inflight Internet system in February 2010. In October 2010, flights between Anchorage and Fairbanks were the first to receive in-flight internet service. In the following months, the system was expanded to cover all routes, except for Hawaii. Alaska Airlines began switching to a satellite-based system in the third quarter of 2019, which is available on all flights, including flights over the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. As of February 2020, 126 of 241 aircraft have satellite WiFi installed.

==Reward programs==
===Mileage Plan===
The frequent-flyer program of Alaska Airlines and subsidiary Horizon Air is called Mileage Plan. The program&#x27;s airline partners include members of all three major airline alliances (Oneworld, SkyTeam, and Star Alliance), as well as several unaffiliated carriers. The Mileage Plan program has no membership fee and allows one-way redemption. Accumulated miles do not expire. The Plan has elite tiers (MVP, MVP Gold, MVP Gold 75K, and MVP Gold 100k) for frequent travelers, who are provided with increased travel benefits.

===Club 49===

In November 2011, Alaska Airlines began a new program, called Club 49, exclusively for Mileage Plan members who are residents of Alaska. Benefits include free checked bags and email notifications about fare sales and discounts. The program has no joining fee and memberships are valid for a year after joining before they need to be renewed.

===Alaska Lounge===
The airline operates nine Alaska Lounges. Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, Alaska&#x27;s largest hub, has three. Portland International Airport has two. Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, San Francisco International Airport, New York JFK, and Los Angeles International Airport have one each. In addition, Oneworld lounges are now also available for Alaska passengers.

==Corporate affairs==
===Alaska Air Cargo===

Alaska Air Cargo has regional operations in parts of the United States. It has the most extensive air cargo operations on the west coast of the U.S., larger than any other passenger airline. Alaska&#x27;s cargo operations are focused primarily on the northwestern contiguous states and Alaska, between Anchorage and Seattle. South of Alaska, primary cargo includes fresh Alaskan seafood. Cargo carried north from Seattle is primarily U.S. Postal Service mail. The airline carries goods for remote Alaskan communities and personal packages.

===Philanthropy===
The Alaska Airlines Foundation, headquartered on the grounds of Ted Stevens International Airport in Anchorage, gives grants to 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations that are classified as charities in Alaska and Washington.

===Worker relations===
Alaska&#x27;s pilot group is represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International. Its flight attendants are represented by the Association of Flight Attendants.

Since , the airline&#x27;s baggage-handling operations have been outsourced to Menzies Aviation. This was in response to the rejection of a contract between IAM, the union which represented the baggage handlers, and Alaska Airlines. It saved the airline an estimated $13 million a year. In late 2016, Alaska Airlines created a wholly owned subsidiary McGee Air Services, which competed with Menzies Aviation for ground handling contracts in select Alaska cities.

==Accidents and incidents==
Alaska Airlines has had 11 major aviation accidents in its history, nine of which resulted in deaths, with the other two resulting in the aircraft being written off but no deaths. A total of 226 passengers and crew along with two people on the ground have been killed.

*On November 30, 1947, Flight 009, a Douglas C-54A (NC91009), with routing Anchorage–Yakutat–Port Hardy–Seattle, crash-landed while attempting to make an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport in Seattle. The plane went off the runway, rolled down an embankment, struck a ditch, and continued into the intersection of the Des Moines Highway and South 188th Street where it struck an automobile, caught fire and spilled fuel over the area. Of the 28 occupants, eight died, plus the driver of the car. The crash was attributed to pilot error.
*On January 20, 1949, Flight 8, a Douglas C-47A (NC91006), was on routing Homer–Kenai, when the plane struck the side of Ptarmigan Head east of the center of the airway to Kenai. Of the six passengers on board, five died. The cause was determined to be the pilot straying off the designated airway.
*On August 8, 1954, an Alaska Airlines C-47A (N91008) operating the routing of McGrath, Alaska to Colorado Creek, Alaska, crashed into the side of a mountain about northwest of McGrath. Both pilots died.
*On March 2, 1957, Flight 100, a Douglas C-54B (N90449) on the routing of Seattle–Fairbanks–Seattle hit a mountain from Blyn while on approach to Seattle. All five occupants died. The cause of the crash was the pilot&#x27;s decision to enter an area of low overcast in mountainous terrain, as well as a navigation error.
*On July 21, 1961, Flight 779, a Douglas DC-6A (N6118C) operating Seattle-–Shemya crashed short of the runway, killing the six crew. The cause of the crash was that the power to the runway and approach lighting systems had been cut off two days earlier, and the control tower neglected to inform the pilots this as they made their approach in the dark.
*On April 17, 1967, An Alaska Airlines Lockheed L-1049H (N7777C) with 28 passengers and four crew members aboard landed with the landing gear retracted during heavy snowfall at Kotzebue Airport. Everyone on board survived but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
*On September 4, 1971, Flight 1866, a Boeing 727-193 operating Anchorage–Cordova–Yakutat–Juneau–Sitka crashed into a mountain in the Chilkat Mountain Range about from the airport while on approach to Juneau. All seven crew members and 104 passengers were killed. The cause of the crash was determined to be misleading navigational information given to the flight crew, the failure of the crew to use all navigational aids and not performing the required audio identification of the navigational facilities.
*On April 5, 1976, Flight 60, a Boeing 727-81 (N124AS) operating Juneau–Ketchikan overran the runway while landing in Ketchikan after the captain decided to attempt a go-around at the last moment. One passenger died in the accident. The cause of the crash was determined to be pilot error for initiating a go-around after commitment to landing and the pilot&#x27;s &quot;unprofessional decision&quot; to abandon the precision approach.
*On June 9, 1987, an Alaska Airlines Boeing 727-90C (N766AS) at Anchorage International Airport with two people on board struck a jetway while taxiing and caught fire, destroying the aircraft. The avionics technician inadvertently deactivated the brake pressurization system.
*On March 13, 1990, an Alaska Airlines Boeing 727 taking off from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport struck and killed a man who ran onto the runway. There were no injuries on the 727. Airport authorities determined that the man was a patient at a nearby mental hospital.
*On January 31, 2000, Flight 261, a McDonnell Douglas MD-83, crashed into the Pacific Ocean near Anacapa Island, in the California Channel Islands, while preparing to attempt an emergency landing at LAX en route from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco and Seattle, killing all 88 people on board. In its report, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined the cause of the accident to be the failure of acme nut threads, which were part of the jackscrew assembly for the horizontal stabilizer&#x27;s trim system. The failure happened because of insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly, which was the result of Alaska&#x27;s extended lubrication and inspection intervals and from the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s approval of those intervals. NTSB also found that the lack of a fail-safe mechanism for the failure of the acme nut threads on the MD-80 design contributed to the accident. This incident, along with an earlier ValuJet Flight 592 crash, led to closer FAA oversight of airline maintenance operations.
*On December 26, 2005, Alaska Airlines Flight 536, a McDonnell Douglas MD-83, aircraft traveling from Seattle to Burbank, faced a severe emergency when a one-foot hole developed in its fuselage at 26,000 feet, leading to explosive decompression. The pilots managed an emergency descent and landed safely back at Sea-Tac Airport without injuring the 140 passengers. Subsequent investigations indicated that the hole was probably caused by a collision with a baggage-handling vehicle operated by Menzies Aviation, which had gone unreported before takeoff. Earlier that year, Alaska Airlines had outsourced over 400 baggage-handling jobs to Menzies, raising concerns about the quality of their ground services. Following the incident, Alaska Airlines inspected all 110 of its aircraft&#x27;s pressurization systems, as there had been 11 other potential pressurization issues since January 1, though no common cause was identified. Factors such as electrical malfunctions and improperly closed doors were noted. Six passengers later sued Alaska Airlines and Menzies Aviation for negligence, citing both physical and emotional injuries. The lawsuit, handled by Kreindler &amp; Kreindler, showed that safety procedures were not followed, and ramp personnel were not trained properly. This raised questions about outsourcing critical operations. 
*On November 14, 2020, Flight 66, a Boeing 737-700, hit and killed a brown bear while landing at the Yakutat Airport in Alaska.
*On August 20, 2023, Flight 1288, a Boeing 737-800 (N516AS), suffered a hard landing at John Wayne Airport causing the left main landing gear to puncture the left wing of the aircraft; remnants of Hurricane Hilary were moving through the area at the time.
*On January 5, 2024, Flight 1282, a Boeing 737 MAX 9 (N704AL) experienced a rapid decompression when its plugged exit door separated from the airframe shortly after departure from Portland International Airport on its way to Ontario International Airport while climbing through . The flight diverted back to Portland. There were no fatalities, but minor injuries were reported. The airplane&#x27;s manufacturer (Boeing) took responsibility for the incident and as of January 12, 2024, the investigation is still ongoing.
*On November 12, 2024, Flight 307, a Boeing 737-990ER (N495AS) experienced a severe overspeed landing when its left engine&#x27;s throttle was unable to be lowered below 55%, likely due to heavy fog and rain. the 737 hit the runway at around 300mph. Flight 307 had taken off from Tampa International Airport on its way to Sea-Tac International Airport. The flight safely slowed after around 9,980 feet. There were no fatalities, but many minor injuries were reported. The airplane&#x27;s manufacturer (Boeing) took responsibility for the incident and as of January 29, 2025, the investigation is still ongoing. 

===Employee incidents===
*On September 2, 2019, an Alaska Airlines flight attendant called for an evacuation of Terminal A of the Newark Liberty International Airport, causing panic among Labor Day travelers. The flight attendant was subsequently detained by police who determined that the incident was a false alarm; the employee reportedly suffered from a mental health-related issue at the time.
*On October 22, 2023, an Alaska Airlines off-duty pilot reportedly attempted to shut down the engines of Horizon Air Flight 2059 operated by Alaska Airlines before being subdued by crew members. The aircraft made an emergency landing at Portland International Airport and landed safely. The off-duty pilot was charged with 83 counts of attempted murder. Passengers from the flight have initiated a class action lawsuit against Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, alleging emotional distress from the incident where an off-duty pilot, Joseph Emerson, interfered with the aircraft&#x27;s operation. The plaintiffs seek a thorough explanation and improved pre-flight screenings to prevent similar occurrences, emphasizing the need for vigilance regarding airline staff&#x27;s mental health. Alaska Airlines has recognized the lawsuit and commended the crew for their actions during the emergency.

<doc id="264799" wikidata="Q47842" url="?curid=264799" title="Empress Dowager Cixi">
<text>Empress Dowager Cixi ( ; 29 November 1835 – 15 November 1908) was a Manchu noblewoman of the Yehe Nara clan who effectively but periodically controlled the Chinese government in the late Qing dynasty as empress dowager and regent for almost 50 years, from 1861 until her death in 1908. Selected as a concubine of the Xianfeng Emperor in her adolescence, she gave birth to a son, Zaichun, in 1856. After the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s death in 1861, his five-year-old son became the Tongzhi Emperor, and Cixi assumed the role of co-empress dowager alongside Xianfeng&#x27;s widow, Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an. Cixi ousted a group of regents appointed by the late emperor and assumed the regency along with Ci&#x27;an. Cixi then consolidated control over the dynasty when she installed her nephew as the Guangxu Emperor at the death of the Tongzhi Emperor in 1875. Ci&#x27;an continued as co-regent until her death in 1881.

Cixi supervised the Tongzhi Restoration, a series of moderate reforms that helped the regime survive until 1911. Although Cixi refused to adopt Western models of government, she supported technological and military reforms and the Self-Strengthening Movement. She supported the principles of the Hundred Days&#x27; Reforms of 1898, but feared that sudden implementation, without bureaucratic support, would be disruptive and permit the Japanese and other foreign powers to take advantage of China. She placed the Guangxu Emperor under virtual house arrest for supporting radical reformers, publicly executing the main reformers. After the Boxer Rebellion led to invasion by Allied armies, Cixi initially backed the Boxer groups and declared war on the invaders. The ensuing defeat was a stunning humiliation, ending with the occupation of Beijing and the Qing regime on the brink of collapse. When Cixi returned from Xi&#x27;an, she backtracked and began to implement fiscal and institutional reforms aimed to turn China towards a constitutional monarchy. The deaths of both Cixi and Guangxu in November 1908 left the court in the hands of Manchu conservatives, the two year-old Puyi on the throne, and a restless, deeply divided society.

Historians both in China and abroad have debated Cixi&#x27;s legacy. Historians have argued that she was a ruthless despot whose reactionary policies – although successful in managing to prolong the ailing Qing dynasty – led to its humiliation and eventual downfall in the Wuchang Uprising. However, revisionist chroniclers have suggested that reformers and revolutionaries scapegoated her for deep-rooted problems which were beyond salvaging, and laud her penchant for moderate reform, including the founding of Peking University and Beiyang Army, and maintenance of political order in an era of destabilising European colonialism.

==Life==
===Birth===
Xingzhen of the Yehe Nara clan was born on the tenth day of the tenth lunar month in the 15th year of the Daoguang Emperor&#x27;s reign (29 November 1835). Her father was Huizheng (), a member of the Bordered Blue Banner who held the title of a third class duke (). Palace archives show that Huizheng was working in Beijing during the year of Xingzhen&#x27;s birth, an indication that she was born in Beijing. The file records the location of her childhood home: Pichai Hutong, Xisipailou, Beijing (). Lady Yehe Nara had a sister named Wanzhen and a brother named Guixiang.

===Xianfeng era===
In 1851, Lady Yehe Nara participated in the selection for wives to the Xianfeng Emperor alongside 60 other candidates. Lady Yehe Nara was one of the few candidates chosen to stay. Among the other chosen candidates were Noble Lady Li of the Tatara clan (who became Consort Li, eventually Imperial Noble Consort Zhuangjing) and Concubine Zhen of the Niohuru clan (who became empress consort, eventually Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an). On 26 June 1852, Lady Yehe Nara left her widowed mother&#x27;s residence at Xilahutong and entered the Forbidden City and was placed in the sixth rank of consorts, styled &quot;Noble Lady Lan&quot;.

On 28 February 1854, Noble Lady Lan was elevated to the fifth rank of consorts and granted the title &quot;Concubine Yi&quot;. In 1855, she became pregnant, and on 27 April 1856, she gave birth to Zaichun, Xianfeng&#x27;s first and only surviving son. On the same day, she was elevated to the fourth rank of consorts as &quot;Consort Yi&quot;. In 1857, when her son reached his first birthday, Consort Yi was elevated to the third rank of imperial consort as &quot;Noble Consort Yi&quot;. This rank placed her second only to Empress Niohuru among the women within Xianfeng&#x27;s harem.

Unlike many of the other Manchu women in the imperial household, Noble Consort Yi was known for her ability to read and write Chinese. This skill granted her numerous opportunities to help the ailing emperor in the governing of the Chinese state on a daily basis. On various occasions, the Xianfeng Emperor had Noble Consort Yi read palace memorials for him and leave instructions on the memorials according to his will. As a result, she became well-informed about state affairs and the art of governing.

===Tongzhi era===
In September 1860, during the closing stages of the Second Opium War, the British diplomatic envoy Harry Parkes was arrested along with other hostages, who were tortured and executed. In retaliation, British and French troops under the command of Lord Elgin attacked Beijing, and by the following month they had burned the Old Summer Palace to the ground. Xianfeng and his entourage, including Noble Consort Yi, fled Beijing to Rehe Province (around present-day Chengde, Hebei). On hearing the news of the destruction of the Old Summer Palace, Xianfeng, who was already showing signs of dementia, fell into a depression. He turned heavily to alcohol and other drugs and became seriously ill. He summoned eight of his most prestigious ministers, headed by Sushun, Zaiyuan and Duanhua, and named them the &quot;Eight Regent Ministers&quot; to direct and support the future emperor. Xianfeng died on 22 August 1861 at the Chengde Mountain Resort in Rehe Province.

Xianfeng&#x27;s heir was his five-year-old son with Noble Consort Yi. It is commonly assumed that on his deathbed, Xianfeng summoned his empress and Noble Consort Yi and gave each of them a stamp. He hoped that when his son ascended the throne, the two women would cooperate in harmony and help the young emperor to grow and mature together. This may also have been done as a check on the power of the eight regents. There is no evidence for this incident, however, and it is unlikely that the emperor ever would have intended Noble Consort Yi to wield political power. It is possible that the seal, allegedly given as a symbol for the child, was really just a present for Noble Consort Yi herself. Informal seals numbered in the thousands and were not considered political accoutrements, rather objects of art commissioned for pleasure by emperors to stamp on items such as paintings, or given as presents to the concubines. Upon the death of the Xianfeng Emperor, his empress was elevated to the status of empress dowager. Although her official title was &quot;Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an&quot;, she was popularly known as the &quot;East Empress Dowager&quot; because she lived in the eastern Zhongcui Palace. Noble Consort Yi was also elevated to &quot;Empress Dowager Cixi&quot;. She was popularly known as the &quot;West Empress Dowager&quot; (西太后) because she lived inside the western Chuxiu Palace.

====Xinyou Coup: Ousting Sushun====
By the time of Xianfeng&#x27;s death, Empress Dowager Cixi had become a political strategist. In Rehe Province, while waiting for an astrologically favourable time to transport the emperor&#x27;s coffin back to Beijing, Cixi conspired with court officials and imperial relatives to seize power. Cixi&#x27;s position as the lower-ranked empress dowager had no intrinsic political power attached to it. In addition, her son, the young emperor, was not a political force himself. As a result, it became necessary for her to ally herself with other powerful figures, including Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an. Cixi suggested that they become co-reigning empress dowagers, with powers exceeding the eight regents; the two had long been close friends since Cixi first came to the imperial household.

Tensions grew between the two empresses dowager and the eight regents, who were led by Sushun. The regents did not appreciate Cixi&#x27;s interference in political affairs, and their frequent confrontations with the empresses dowager left Ci&#x27;an frustrated. Ci&#x27;an often refused to come to court audiences, leaving Cixi to deal with the ministers alone. Secretly, Cixi had begun gathering the support of talented ministers, soldiers, and others who were ostracized by the eight regents for personal or political reasons. Among them were two of Xianfeng&#x27;s brothers: Prince Gong and Prince Chun. Prince Gong had been excluded from power, yet harboured great ambitions. While Cixi aligned herself with the two princes, a memorial came from Shandong asking for her to &quot;rule from behind the curtains&quot; or &quot;listen to politics behind the curtains&quot; (), i.e., to assume power as &quot;de facto&quot; ruler. The same memorial also asked Prince Gong to enter the political arena as a principal &quot;aide to the Emperor&quot;.

When Xianfeng&#x27;s funeral procession left for Beijing, Cixi took advantage of her alliances with Princes Gong and Chun. She and her son returned to the capital before the rest of the party, along with Zaiyuan and Duanhua, two of the eight regents, while Sushun was left to accompany the deceased emperor&#x27;s procession. Cixi&#x27;s early return to Beijing meant that she had more time to plan with Prince Gong and ensure that the power base of the eight regents was divided between Sushun and his allies, Zaiyuan and Duanhua. In order to remove them from power, history was rewritten: the regents were dismissed for having carried out incompetent negotiations with the &quot;barbarians&quot; that had caused Xianfeng to flee to Rehe Province &quot;greatly against his will&quot;, among other charges.

To display her high moral standards, Cixi executed only three of the eight regents. Prince Gong had suggested that Sushun and others be executed by the most painful method, known as slow slicing (&quot;death by a thousand cuts&quot;), but Cixi declined the suggestion and ordered that Sushun be beheaded, while the other two also marked for execution, Zaiyuan and Duanhua, were given pieces of white silk for them to hang themselves with. In addition, Cixi refused outright the idea of executing the family members of the regents, as would be done in accordance with imperial tradition of an alleged usurper. Ironically, Qing imperial tradition also dictated that women and princes were never to engage in politics. In breaking with tradition, Cixi became the only empress dowager in the Qing dynasty to assume the role of regent, ruling from behind the curtains.

This coup is historically known as the Xinyou Coup because it took place in the &quot;xinyou&quot; year, the name of the year 1861 in the Chinese sexagenary cycle.

====Ruling behind the curtain====
=====New era=====
In November 1861, a few days following the Xinyou Coup, Cixi was quick to reward Prince Gong for his help. He was appointed prince regent and his eldest daughter was made a first rank princess, a title usually bestowed only on the empress&#x27;s first-born daughter. However, Cixi avoided giving Prince Gong the absolute political power that princes such as Dorgon exercised during the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s reign. As one of the first acts of &quot;ruling behind the curtain&quot; from within the Hall of Mental Cultivation, the political and governmental hub during this era, Cixi, nominally along with Ci&#x27;an, issued two imperial edicts on behalf of the boy emperor. The first stated that the two empresses dowager were to be the sole decision-makers &quot;without interference,&quot; and the second changed the emperor&#x27;s regnal title from &quot;Qixiang&quot; (; &quot;auspicious&quot;) to &quot;Tongzhi&quot; (; &quot;collective stability&quot;).

Despite being designated as the sole decision-makers, both Ci&#x27;an and Cixi were forced to rely on the Grand Council and a complex series of procedures in order to deal with affairs of state. When state documents came in, they were to be first forwarded to the empresses dowager, then referred back to Prince Gong and the Grand Council. Having discussed the matters, Prince Gong and his colleagues would seek the instruction of the empresses dowager at audiences and imperial orders would be drawn up accordingly, with drafts having to be approved by the empresses dowager before edicts were issued. The most important role of the empresses dowager during the regency was to apply their seals to edicts, a merely mechanical role in a complex bureaucracy.

=====Cleaning up the bureaucracy=====

Cixi&#x27;s ascendancy came at a time of internal chaos and foreign challenges. The effects of the Second Opium War were still hovering over the country, and the Taiping Rebellion continued its seemingly unstoppable advance through China&#x27;s south, eating up the Qing Empire bit by bit. Internally, both the national bureaucracy and regional authorities were infested with corruption. 1861 happened to be the year of official examinations, whereby officials of all levels presented their political reports from the previous three years. Cixi decided that the time was ripe for a bureaucratic overhaul, and she personally sought audience with all officials above the level of provincial governor, who had to report to her personally. Cixi thus took on part of the role usually given to the &quot;Bureaucratic Affairs Department&quot; (吏部). Cixi had two prominent officials executed to serve as examples for others: Qingying, a military &quot;shilang&quot; who had tried to bribe his way out of demotion, and He Guiqing, then Viceroy of Liangjiang, who fled Changzhou in the wake of an incoming Taiping army instead of trying to defend the city. A number of reforms were implemented, such as the development of the Zongli Yamen, an official foreign ministry to deal with international affairs, the restoration of regional armies and regional strongmen, modernization of railroads, factories, and arsenals, an increase of industrial and commercial productivity, and the institution of a period of peace that allowed China time to modernize and develop.

Another significant challenge Cixi faced was the increasingly decrepit state of the Manchu elites. Since the beginning of Qing rule over China in 1644, most major positions at court had been held by Manchus. Cixi, again in a reversal of imperial tradition, entrusted the country&#x27;s most powerful military unit against the Taiping rebels into the hands of a Han Chinese, Zeng Guofan. Additionally, in the next three years, Cixi appointed Han Chinese officials as governors in all southern Chinese provinces, raising alarm bells in the court, traditionally protective of Manchu dominance.

Regarding the reforms of the Tongzhi Restoration, Mary C. Wright suggested that &quot;Not only a dynasty but also a civilization which appeared to have collapsed was revived to last for another sixty years by the extraordinary efforts of extraordinary men in the 1860s.&quot; John K. Fairbank wrote, &quot;That the Qing managed to survive both domestic and international attacks is due largely to the policy and leadership changes known as the Qing Restoration.&quot;

=====Taiping victory and Prince Gong=====
Under the command of Zeng Guofan, the victorious Xiang Army defeated the Taiping rebel army in a hard-fought battle at Tianjing (present-day Nanjing) in July 1864. Zeng was rewarded with the title of &quot;Marquess Yiyong, First Class&quot;, while his brother Zeng Guoquan, along with Li Hongzhang, Zuo Zongtang and other Han Chinese officers who fought against the Taiping rebels, were rewarded with auspicious decorations and titles. With the Taiping rebel threat receding, Cixi focused her attention on new internal threats to her power. Of special concern was the position of Prince Gong, who was Prince-Regent in the imperial court. Prince Gong gathered under his command the support of all outstanding Han Chinese armies. In addition, Prince Gong controlled daily court affairs as the head of the Grand Council and the Zongli Yamen (the &quot;de facto&quot; foreign affairs ministry). With his increasing stature, Prince Gong was considered a threat to Cixi and her power.

Although Prince Gong was rewarded for his conduct and recommendation of Zeng Guofan before the Taiping rebels&#x27; defeat, Cixi was quick to move after Cai Shouqi, a minor scribe-official, filed a memorial accusing Prince Gong of corruption and showing disrespect to the emperor. Having built up a powerful base and a network of allies at court, Prince Gong considered the accusations insignificant. Cixi, however, took the memorial as a stepping stone to Prince Gong&#x27;s removal. In April 1865, under the pretext that Prince Gong had &quot;improper court conduct before the two empresses,&quot; among a series of other charges, the prince was dismissed from all his offices and appointments, but was allowed to retain his status as a noble. The dismissal surprised the nobility and court officials and brought about numerous petitions for his return. Prince Gong&#x27;s brothers, Prince Dun and Prince Chun, both sought their brother&#x27;s reinstatement. Prince Gong himself, in an audience with Cixi and Ci&#x27;an, burst into tears. Bowing to popular pressure, Cixi allowed Prince Gong to return to his position as the head of the Zongli Yamen, but rid him of his title of prince regent. Prince Gong would never return to political prominence again, and neither would the liberal and pro-reform policies of his time. Prince Gong&#x27;s demotion revealed Cixi&#x27;s iron grip on politics, and her lack of willingness to give up absolute power to anyone – not even Prince Gong, her most important ally in the Xinyou Coup.

=====Foreign influence=====
China&#x27;s defeat in the Second Opium War of 1856–60 was a wake-up call. Military strategies were outdated, both on land and sea and in terms of weaponry. Sensing an immediate threat from foreigners and realising that China&#x27;s agricultural-based economy could not hope to compete with the industrial prowess of the West, Cixi decided that for the first time in Chinese history, China would learn from the Western powers and import their knowledge and technology. At the time, three prominent Han Chinese officials, Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang and Zuo Zongtang, had all begun industrial programs in the country&#x27;s southern regions. In supporting these programmes, Cixi also decreed the opening of the Tongwen Guan in 1862, a school for foreign languages in Beijing. The Tongwen Guan specialised in new-age topics such as astronomy and mathematics, as well as the English, French and Russian languages. Groups of young boys were also sent abroad to the United States for studies.

China&#x27;s &quot;learn from foreigners&quot; programme quickly met with impediments. The Chinese military institutions were in desperate need of reform. Cixi&#x27;s solution, under the advice of officials at court, was to purchase seven British warships. When the warships arrived in China, however, they were staffed with British sailors, all under British command. The Chinese were enraged at this &quot;international joke&quot;, negotiations broke down between the two parties, and China returned the warships to Britain, where they were to be auctioned off. Scholars sometimes attribute the failure of China&#x27;s foreign programmes to Cixi&#x27;s conservative attitude and old methods of thinking, and contend that Cixi would learn only so much from the foreigners, provided it did not infringe upon her own power. Under the pretext that a railway was too loud and would &quot;disturb the emperors&#x27; tombs&quot;, Cixi forbade its construction. When construction went ahead anyway in 1877 on Li Hongzhang&#x27;s recommendation, Cixi asked that they be pulled by horse-drawn carts. She also refused to be driven in a motorcar, as the driver would be unable to lower himself in front of her, as custom dictated. Cixi was especially alarmed at the liberal thinking of people who had studied abroad, and saw that it posed a new threat to her power. In 1881, she put a halt to the policy of sending children abroad to study and withdrew her formerly open attitude towards foreigners.

=====The Tongzhi Emperor&#x27;s marriage=====
In 1872, the Tongzhi Emperor turned 17. Under the guidance of Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an, he was married to Lady Arute. The new empress&#x27;s grandfather, Duanhua, Prince Zheng, was one of the eight regents ousted from power in the Xinyou Coup of 1861. He had been Cixi&#x27;s rival during the coup and was ordered to commit suicide after Cixi&#x27;s victory. As a consequence, there were tensions between Cixi and Arute, and this was often a source of irritation for Cixi. Moreover, Arute&#x27;s zodiac symbol of tiger was perceived as life-threatening by the superstitious Cixi, whose own zodiac symbol was a goat. According to Cixi&#x27;s belief, it was a warning from the gods that she would eventually fall prey to Arute.

Empress Arute was well received by both Tongzhi and Ci&#x27;an. Her personal consultants once warned her to be more agreeable and docile to Cixi, who was truly the one in power. Arute replied, &quot;I am a principal consort, having been carried through the front gate with pomp and circumstance, as mandated by our ancestors. Empress Dowager Cixi was a concubine, and entered our household through a side gate.&quot;

Since the very beginning of his marriage, Tongzhi proceeded to spend most of his time with his empress at the expense of his four concubines, including Imperial Noble Consort Shushen, who was Cixi&#x27;s preferred candidate for empress consort. As hostility grew between Arute and Cixi, Cixi suggested the emperor and empress spend more time on studies and spied on Tongzhi using palace eunuchs. After her warning was ignored, Cixi ordered the couple to separate, and Tongzhi purportedly spent several months following Cixi&#x27;s order in isolation at Qianqing Palace.

The young emperor, who could no longer cope with his grief and loneliness, grew more and more ill-tempered. He began to treat his servants with cruelty and punished them physically for minor offences. Under the joined influence of court eunuchs and Zaicheng, Prince Gong&#x27;s eldest son and Tongzhi&#x27;s best friend, the emperor managed to escape the palace in search of pleasure in the unrestricted parts of Beijing. For several evenings, Tongzhi disguised himself as a commoner and secretly spent the nights in the brothels of Beijing. His sexual habits became common talk among court officials and commoners, and there are many records of the emperor&#x27;s escapades.

=====The Tongzhi Emperor&#x27;s deficiencies in ruling=====
Tongzhi received a rigorous education from four famous teachers of Cixi&#x27;s own choosing: Li Hongzao, Qi Junzao, Weng Xincun, and Woren. This group was later joined by Weng Xincun&#x27;s son, Weng Tonghe; the emperor&#x27;s governor, also selected by Cixi, was Mianyu. The imperial teachers instructed the emperor in the classics and various old texts for which Tongzhi displayed little or no interest.

Despite, or perhaps because of, the pressure and stress put upon the young emperor, he despised learning for the majority of his life. According to Weng Tonghe&#x27;s diary, Tongzhi could not read a memorandum in full sentences by the age of 16. Worried about her son&#x27;s inability to learn, Cixi only pressured him more. When he was given personal rule in November 1873 at the age of 18 (four years behind the usual custom), Tongzhi proved to be an incompetent ruler.

Tongzhi made two important policy decisions during his short stint of rule, which lasted from 1873 to 1875. First, he decreed that the Summer Palace, destroyed by the English and French in the Second Opium War, would be completely rebuilt under the pretext that it was a gift to Cixi and Ci&#x27;an. Historians also suggest that it was an attempt to drive Cixi from the Forbidden City so that he could rule without interference in policy or his private affairs.

The imperial treasury was almost depleted at the time from internal strife and foreign wars, and as a result, Tongzhi asked the Board of Finance to forage for the necessary funds. In addition, he encouraged members of the nobility and high officials to donate funds from their personal resources. Once construction began, the emperor checked its progress on a monthly basis, and would often spend days away from court, indulging himself in pleasures outside of the Forbidden City.

Uneasy about Tongzhi&#x27;s neglect of national affairs, the emperor&#x27;s uncles Prince Gong and Prince Chun, along with other senior court officials, submitted a joint memorandum asking the emperor to cease the construction of the Summer Palace, among other recommendations. Tongzhi, unwilling to submit to criticism, issued an imperial edict in August 1874 to strip Prince Gong of his princely title and demote him to the status of a commoner. Two days later, Prince Dun, Prince Chun, Prince Fu, Jingshou, Prince Qing, Wenxiang, Baojun, and Grand Councillors Shen Guifen and Li Hongzao were all to be stripped of their respective titles and jobs.

Seeing the mayhem unfold from behind the scenes, Cixi and Ci&#x27;an made an unprecedented appearance at court directly criticising Tongzhi for his wrongful actions and asked him to withdraw the edict; Cixi said that &quot;without Prince Gong, the situation today would not exist for you and me.&quot;

Feeling a grand sense of loss at court and unable to assert his authority, Tongzhi returned to his former habits. It was rumoured that he caught syphilis and became visibly ill. The physicians spread a rumour that Tongzhi had smallpox, and proceeded to give medical treatment accordingly. Within a few weeks, on 13 January 1875, Tongzhi died. His wife followed suit in March. Judging from a modern medical perspective, the onset of syphilis comes in stages, thus the emperor&#x27;s quick death does not seem to reflect its symptoms. Therefore, most historians maintain that Tongzhi did, in fact, die from smallpox. Regardless, by 1875, Cixi was back onto the helm of imperial power.

===Guangxu era===
====New challenges and illness====

Tongzhi died without a male heir, a circumstance that created an unprecedented succession crisis in the dynastic line. Members of the generation above were considered unfit, as they could not, by definition, be the successor of their nephew. Therefore, the new emperor had to be from a generation below or the same generation as the Tongzhi. After considerable disagreement between the two empresses dowager, Zaitian, the four-year-old firstborn son of Prince Chun and Cixi&#x27;s sister, was to become the new emperor. 1875 was declared the first year of the &quot;Guangxu&quot; era; &quot;Guangxu&quot; was the new emperor&#x27;s regnal name and it means &quot;glorious succession&quot;. Zaitian was taken from home and for the remainder of his life would be cut completely off from his family. While addressing Ci&#x27;an conventionally as &quot;huang e&#x27;niang&quot; (&quot;Empress Mother&quot;), the Guangxu Emperor was forced to address Cixi as &quot;qin baba&quot; (&quot;Dear Father&quot;), in order to enforce an image that she was the fatherly figure in the household. Guangxu began his education when he was aged five, taught by the imperial tutor Weng Tonghe, with whom he would develop a lasting bond.

Shortly after Guangxu&#x27;s accession, Cixi fell severely ill. This rendered her largely inaccessible to her young nephew and had the result of leaving Ci&#x27;an to attend to most of the affairs of state.

The sudden death of Ci&#x27;an in April 1881 brought Cixi a new challenge. Ci&#x27;an had taken little interest in running state affairs, but was the decision-maker in most family affairs. As the empress of the Xianfeng Emperor, she took seniority over Cixi, despite being two years her junior. Some believe that rumours began circulating at court to the effect that Cixi had poisoned Ci&#x27;an, perhaps as a result of a possible conflict between Cixi and Ci&#x27;an over the execution of the eunuch An Dehai in 1869 or a possible will from the late Xianfeng Emperor that was issued exclusively to Ci&#x27;an. Because of a lack of evidence, however, historians are reluctant to believe that Cixi poisoned Ci&#x27;an, but instead choose to believe that the cause of death was a sudden stroke, as validated by traditional Chinese medicine.

In the years between 1881 and 1883, Cixi resorted to written communication only with her ministers. The young emperor reportedly was forced to conduct some audiences alone, without Cixi to assist him.

The once fierce and determined Prince Gong, frustrated by Cixi&#x27;s iron grip on power, did little to question Cixi on state affairs, and supported Manchu involvement in the Sino-French War of 1884–1885. Cixi used China&#x27;s loss in the war as a pretext for getting rid of Prince Gong and other important decision-makers in the Grand Council in 1885. She downgraded Prince Gong to &quot;advisor&quot; and elevated the more easily influenced Prince Chun, Guangxu&#x27;s father.

When it was first developed by Empress Dowager Cixi, the Beiyang Fleet was said to be the strongest navy in East Asia. Before her nephew Guangxu took over the throne in 1889, Cixi wrote out explicit orders that the navy should continue to develop and expand gradually. However, after Cixi went into retirement, all naval and military development came to a drastic halt. Japan&#x27;s victories over China has often been falsely rumored to be the fault of Cixi. Many believed that Cixi was the cause of the navy&#x27;s defeat by embezzling funds from the navy in order to build the Summer Palace in Beijing. The greatest symbol of this enduring belief is the Marble Boat that is part of the Summer Palace. However, extensive research by Chinese historians suggests that Cixi was not the cause of the Chinese navy&#x27;s decline. In actuality, China&#x27;s defeat was caused by Guangxu&#x27;s lack of interest in developing and maintaining the military. His close adviser, Grand Tutor Weng Tonghe, advised Guangxu to cut all funding to the navy and army, because he did not see Japan as a true threat, and there were several natural disasters during the early 1890s which the emperor thought to be more pressing to expend funds on.

====The Guangxu Emperor&#x27;s accession====

Guangxu technically gained the right to rule at the age of 16 in 1887 after Cixi issued an edict to arrange a ceremony to mark his accession. Because of her prestige and power, however, court officials voiced their opposition to Guangxu&#x27;s personal rule, citing the emperor&#x27;s youth as the main reason. Prince Chun and Weng Tonghe, each with a different motive, requested that Guangxu&#x27;s accession be postponed until a later date. Cixi, with her reputed reluctance, accepted the &quot;advice&quot; and legitimised her continued rule through a new legal document that allowed her to &quot;aid&quot; Guangxu in his rule indefinitely.

Guangxu slowly began to take on more responsibilities in spite of Cixi&#x27;s prolonged regency. In 1886, he attended his first field plowing ceremony and began commenting on imperial state documents. By 1887, he began to rule under Cixi&#x27;s supervision.

Guangxu married and took up the reins of power in 1889. By that year, the emperor was already 18, older than the conventional marriage age for emperors. Prior to his wedding, a large fire engulfed the Gate of Supreme Harmony at the Forbidden City. This event followed a trend of recent natural disasters that were considered alarming by many observers. According to traditional Chinese political theory, such incidents were taken as a warning of the imminent loss of the &quot;Mandate of Heaven&quot; by current rulers.

For Guangxu&#x27;s empress, Cixi chose her niece, and Guangxu&#x27;s cousin, Jingfen. Cixi in addition selected two concubines for the emperor who were sisters, Consorts Jin and Zhen. Guangxu eventually would prefer to spend more time with Consort Zhen, neglecting his empress, much to Cixi&#x27;s dismay. In 1894, Cixi degraded Consort Zhen, citing intervention in political affairs as the main reason. According to some reports, she even had her flogged. Consort Jin had also been implicated in Consort Zhen&#x27;s reported influence peddling and also apparently suffered a similar punishment. A cousin of theirs, Zhirui, was banished from the capital to a military outpost.

====&quot;Retirement&quot;====
On 5 March 1889, Cixi retired from her second regency, but nonetheless served as the effective head of the imperial family. Many officials felt and showed more loyalty to the empress dowager than they did to the emperor, owing in part to her seniority and in part to her personalised approach to cultivating court favourites, many of whom would be given gifts of her artwork and invitations to join her at the theater for opera and acrobatics.

In spite of her residence for a period of time at the Summer Palace, which had been constructed with the official intention of providing her a suitable place to live after retiring from political affairs, Cixi continued to influence the decisions and actions of the Guangxu Emperor even after he began his formal rule at age 19. Along with an entourage of court officials, Guangxu would pay visits to her every second or third day at which major political decisions would be made. Weng Tonghe observed that while the emperor dealt with day-to-day administration, the Grand Councillors gave their advice in more complex cases, and in the most complex cases of all, the advice of Cixi was sought.

In 1894, the First Sino-Japanese War broke out over Korea whose age-old allegiance to Beijing was wavering. After the decisive victory and ensuing Treaty of Shimonoseki, Japan annexed Taiwan from Qing China. During this period, Cixi was continuously called upon to arbitrate policy-making, and the emperor was sometimes even bypassed in decision-making processes. Cixi eventually was given copies of the secret palace memorials as well, a practice that was carried on until 1898, when it became unnecessary.

In November 1894, Cixi celebrated her 60th birthday. Borrowing from the plans used for the celebrations of the 70th and 80th birthdays of Empress Xiaoshengxian (the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s mother), plans included a triumphal progress along the decorated road between the Forbidden City and the Summer Palace, decorations for the Beijing city gates and monumental archways, free theatrical performances, remission of punishments and the restoration of degraded officials. However, the war between China and Japan forced the empress dowager to cancel the lavish celebrations she had planned and settle for a much smaller commemoration that was held in the Forbidden City.

====Hundred Days&#x27; Reform====
After coming to the throne, Guangxu became more reform-minded. After a humiliating defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894, during which the Chinese Beiyang Fleet was virtually destroyed by the Imperial Japanese Navy, the Qing government faced unprecedented challenges internally and abroad, with its very existence at stake. Under the influence of reformist-officials Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, Guangxu believed that by learning from constitutional monarchies such as Japan and Germany, China would become politically and economically powerful. In June 1898, Guangxu launched the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform aimed at sweeping political, legal and social changes and issued edicts for far-reaching modernising reforms.

These abrupt reforms, however, came without building support either at court or in the bureaucracy. Cixi, whether concerned that they would check her power or fearful that they would lead to disorder, stepped in to prevent them from going further. Some government and military officials warned Cixi that the &quot;ming-shi&quot; (reformation bureau) had been geared toward conspiracy. Allegations of treason against the emperor, as well as suspected Japanese influence within the reform movement, led Cixi to resume the role of regent and resume control at the court. The Manchu general Ronglu on 21 September 1898, took the emperor to Ocean Terrace, a small palace on an island in the middle of Zhongnanhai linked to the rest of the Forbidden City only by a controlled causeway. Cixi followed this action with an edict that proclaimed Guangxu&#x27;s total disgrace and unfitness to be emperor. Guangxu&#x27;s reign effectively came to an end.

According to research by Professor Lei Chia-sheng (雷家聖), during the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform, former Japanese prime minister Itō Hirobumi arrived in China on 11 September 1898. Almost at the same time, British missionary Timothy Richard was invited to Beijing by the reformist Kang Youwei. Richard suggested that China should hand over some political power to Itō in order to help push the reforms further. On 18 September, Richard convinced Kang to adopt a plan by which China would join a federation composed of China, Japan, the United States, and England. This suggestion did not reflect the policies of the countries concerned. It was Richard&#x27;s (and perhaps Itō&#x27;s) trick to convince China to hand over national rights. Kang nonetheless asked fellow reformers Yang Shenxiu (楊深秀) and Song Bolu (宋伯魯) to report this plan to Guangxu. On 20 September, Yang sent a memorial to this effect to the emperor. In another memorial written the next day, Song Bolu also advocated the formation of a federation and the sharing of the diplomatic, fiscal, and military powers of the four countries under a hundred-man committee.

Still according to Lei&#x27;s findings, on 13 October, British ambassador Claude MacDonald reported to his government about the Chinese situation, saying that Chinese reforms had been damaged by Kang Youwei and his friends&#x27; actions. British diplomat Frederick Bourne claimed in his own report that Kang was a dreamer who had been seduced by Timothy Richard&#x27;s sweet words. Bourne thought Richard was a plotter. The British and U.S. governments were unaware of the &quot;federation&quot; plot, which seems to have been Richard&#x27;s personal idea. Because Richard&#x27;s partner Itō Hirobumi had been prime minister of Japan, the Japanese government might have known about Richard&#x27;s plan, but there is no evidence to this effect.

A crisis over the issue of abdication emerged. Bowing to increasing pressure from the West and general civil discontent, Cixi did not forcibly remove Guangxu from the throne, although she attempted to have Pujun, a boy of 14 who was from a close branch of the imperial family, installed as crown prince. The Guangxu era nominally continued until his death in 1908, but the emperor lost all respect, power, and privileges, including his freedom of movement. Most of his supporters, including his political mentor Kang Youwei, fled into exile, and the six prominent reformers including Tan Sitong and Kang&#x27;s younger brother, were publicly beheaded. Kang continued to work for a constitutional monarchy while in exile, remaining loyal to Guangxu and hoping eventually to restore him to power. His efforts would prove to be in vain.

====Boxer Rebellion====
In 1900, the Boxer Rebellion broke out in northern China. Perhaps fearing further foreign intervention, Cixi threw her support to these anti-foreign bands by making an official announcement of her support for the movement and a formal declaration of war on the Western powers. The general Ronglu deliberately sabotaged the performance of the imperial army during the rebellion. Dong Fuxiang&#x27;s Muslim troops (the &quot;Kansu Braves&quot;) were able and eager to destroy the foreign military forces in the legations, but Ronglu stopped them from doing so. The Manchu prince Zaiyi was xenophobic and friendly with Dong Fuxiang. Zaiyi wanted artillery for Dong&#x27;s troops to destroy the legations. Ronglu blocked the transfer of artillery to Zaiyi and Dong, preventing them from destroying the legations. When artillery was finally supplied to the imperial army and Boxers, it was done in only limited amounts; Ronglu deliberately held back the rest of them. The Chinese forces defeated the small 2,000-man Western relief force at the Battle of Langfang, but lost several decisive battles, including the Battle of Beicang, and the entire imperial court was forced to retreat as the forces of the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded Beijing. Because moderates at the Qing imperial court tried to appease the foreigners by moving the Muslim Kansu Braves out of their way, the allied army was able to march into Beijing and seize the capital.

During the war, Cixi displayed concern about China&#x27;s situation and foreign aggression, saying, &quot;Perhaps their magic is not to be relied upon; but can we not rely on the hearts and minds of the people? Today China is extremely weak. We have only the people&#x27;s hearts and minds to depend upon. If we cast them aside and lose the people&#x27;s hearts, what can we use to sustain the country?&quot; The Chinese people were almost unanimous in their support for the Boxers due to the Western Allied invasion.

When Cixi received an ultimatum demanding that China surrender total control over all its military and financial affairs to foreigners, she defiantly stated before the Grand Council, &quot;Now they [the Powers] have started the aggression, and the extinction of our nation is imminent. If we just fold our arms and yield to them, I would have no face to see our ancestors after death. If we must perish, why not fight to the death?&quot; It was at this point that Cixi began to blockade the legations with the armies of the Peking Field Force, which began the siege.

Cixi stated that &quot;I have always been of the opinion, that the allied armies had been permitted to escape too easily in 1860. Only a united effort was then necessary to have given China the victory. Today, at last, the opportunity for revenge has come&quot;, and said that millions of Chinese would join the cause of fighting the foreigners since the Manchus had provided &quot;great benefits&quot; to China.

During the Battle of Beijing, the entire imperial court, including Cixi and Guangxu, fled Beijing and evacuated to Xi&#x27;an as the allied forces invaded the city. After the fall of Beijing, the Eight-Nation Alliance negotiated a treaty with the Qing government, sending messengers to the empress dowager in Xi&#x27;an. Included in the terms of the agreement was a guarantee that China would not have to give up any further territories to foreign powers. Many of Cixi&#x27;s advisers in the imperial court insisted that the war against the foreigners be continued. They recommended that Dong Fuxiang be given responsibility to continue the war effort. Cixi was practical, however, and decided that the terms were generous enough for her to acquiesce and stop the war, at least after she was assured of her continued reign when the war was concluded. The Western powers needed a government strong enough to suppress further anti-foreign movements, but too weak to act on its own; they supported the continuation of the Qing dynasty, rather than allowing it to be overthrown. Cixi turned once more to Li Hongzhang to negotiate. Li agreed to sign the Boxer Protocol, which stipulated the presence of an international military force in Beijing and the payment of £67 million (almost $333 million) in war reparations. The United States used its share of the war indemnity to fund the creation of China&#x27;s prestigious Tsinghua University. Guangxu and Cixi did not return to Beijing from Xi&#x27;an until roughly 18 months after their flight.

====Return to Beijing and reforms====

In January 1902, Cixi, Guangxu, the empress and the rest of the court made a ceremonious return to Beijing. At the railhead at Chengtingfu, Cixi and the court boarded a 21-car train to convey them the rest of the way to the capital. In Beijing, many of the legation women turned out to watch the procession from the Beijing railway station to the Forbidden City, and for the first time, commoners were permitted to watch as well.

Once back in the palace, Cixi implemented sweeping political reforms. High officials were dispatched to Japan and Europe to gather facts and draw up plans for sweeping administrative reforms in law, education, government structure, and social policy, many of which were modeled on the reforms of the Meiji Restoration. The abolition of the examination system in 1905 was only the most visible of these sweeping reforms. Ironically, Cixi sponsored the implementation of the New Policies, a reform program more radical than the one proposed by the reformers she had beheaded in 1898.

In an attempt to woo foreigners, Cixi also invited the wives of the diplomatic corps to a tea in the Forbidden City soon after her return, and in time, would hold summer garden parties for the foreign community at the Summer Palace. In 1903, she acquiesced to the request of Sarah Conger, wife of Edwin H. Conger, the U.S. Ambassador to China, to have her portrait painted by American artist Katharine Carl for the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair. Between 1903 and 1905, Cixi had a Western-educated lady-in-waiting by the name of Yu Deling, along with her sister and mother, serve at her court. Yu Deling, fluent in English and French, as well as Chinese, often served as translator at meetings with the wives of the diplomatic corps.

In 1903, Cixi allowed a young aristocratic photographer named Yu Xunling, a brother of Yu Deling, to take elaborately staged shots of her and her court. They were designed to convey imperial authority, aesthetic refinement, and religious piety. As the only photographic series taken of Cixi – the supreme leader of China for more than 45 years – it represents a unique convergence of Qing court pictorial traditions, modern photographic techniques, and Western standards of artistic portraiture. The rare glass plates have been blown up into full-size images, included in the exhibition &quot;The Empress Dowager&quot; at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.

===Xuantong era===
Cixi died in the Hall of Graceful Bird at the Middle Sea () of Zhongnanhai, Beijing, on 15 November 1908, after having installed Puyi as the new emperor on 14 November 1908. Her death came only a day after the death of Guangxu. Radicals greeted the news with scorn. The anarchist Wu Zhihui, who had leveled some of the most vitriol at Cixi in life, wrote from exile in Paris of the &quot;vixen empress and vermin emperor&quot; that &quot;their lingering stench makes me vomit.&quot;

On 4 November 2008, forensic tests concluded that Guangxu died from acute arsenic poisoning. &quot;China Daily&quot; quoted a historian, Dai Yi, who speculated that Cixi had known of her imminent death and worried that Guangxu would continue his reforms after her death. It was reported in November 2008 that the level of arsenic in his remains was 2,000 times higher than that of ordinary people.

Empress Dowager Cixi was interred amidst the Eastern Qing tombs, east of Beijing, in the Eastern Ding Mausoleum (), along with Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an. Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an lies in the Puxiangyu Eastern Ding Mausoleum (; lit. &quot;Tomb East of the Ding Mausoleum in the Broad Valley of Good Omen&quot;), while Empress Dowager Cixi built herself the much larger Putuoyu Eastern Ding Mausoleum (; lit. &quot;Tomb East of the Ding Mausoleum in the Putuo Valley&quot;). The Ding Mausoleum (lit. &quot;Tomb of Quietude&quot;), where the Xianfeng Emperor is buried, is located west of the Dingdongling. The Putuo Valley owes its name to Mount Putuo, one of the Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains of China.

Cixi, unsatisfied with her tomb, ordered its destruction and reconstruction in 1895. The new tomb was a complex of temples, gates, and pavilions, covered with gold leaf, and with gold and gilded-bronze ornaments hanging from the beams and the eaves. In July 1928, Cixi&#x27;s tomb was plundered by the warlord Sun Dianying and his army as part of the looting of the Eastern Mausoleum. They methodically stripped the complex of its precious ornaments, then dynamited the entrance to the burial chamber, opened Cixi&#x27;s coffin, threw her corpse (said to have been found intact) on the ground, and stole the jewels contained in the coffin. They also took the massive pearl that had been placed in the empress dowager&#x27;s mouth to protect her corpse from decomposing (in accordance with Chinese tradition). Sun Dianying claimed the desecration was revenge for the death of his ancestor Sun Chengzong in 1638. Puyi had Cixi&#x27;s remains reburied. The Eastern Mausoleum together with other Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties are now protected legally by central and local governments and a systems of protection and management put in place to improve the conservation and management of the tombs, which are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List 

==Legacy==

For many years, the mainstream view of Cixi was that she was a devious despot who contributed in no small part to China&#x27;s slide into corruption, chaos, and revolution. Cixi used her power to accumulate vast quantities of money, bullion, antiques and jewelry, using the revenues of the state as her own. The long-time China journalist Jasper Becker recalled that &quot;every visitor to the Summer Palace is shown the beautiful lakeside pavilion in the shape of an elegant marble pleasure boat and told how Cixi spent funds destined for the imperial navy on such extravagant fripperieswhich ultimately led to Japan&#x27;s victory over China in 1895 and the loss of Taiwan&quot;.

Yet even after the violent anti-foreign Boxer movement and equally violent foreign reprisal, the initial foreign accounts of Cixi emphasized her warmth and friendliness.

This was perhaps because Cixi took the initiative and invited several women to spend time with her in the Forbidden City. Katharine Carl, an American painter, was called to China in 1903 to paint Cixi&#x27;s portrait for the St. Louis Exposition. In her &quot;With the Empress Dowager&quot;, Carl portrays Cixi as a kind and considerate woman for her station. Cixi had great presence, charm, and graceful movements resulting in &quot;an unusually attractive personality&quot;. Carl wrote of the empress dowager&#x27;s love of dogs and of flowers, as well as boating, Chinese opera and her Chinese water pipes and European cigarettes. Cixi also commissioned the portraitist Hubert Vos to produce a series of oil portraits.

The publication of &quot;China Under The Empress Dowager&quot; (1910) by J. O. P. Bland and Edmund Backhouse contributed to Cixi&#x27;s reputation with its back-door gossip, much of which came from palace eunuchs. Their portrait included contradictory elements, writes one recent study, &quot;on the one hand... imperious, manipulative, and lascivious&quot; and on the other &quot;ingenuous, politically shrewd, and conscientious...&quot; Backhouse and Bland told their readers that &quot;to summarize her essence simply, she a woman and an Oriental&quot;. Backhouse was later found to have forged much of the source material used in this work. The vivid writing and lascivious details of their account provided material for many of the books over the following decades, including Chinese fiction and histories that drew on a 1914 translation.

In the People&#x27;s Republic after 1949, the image of the Manchu Empress was debated and changed several times. She was sometimes praised for her anti-imperialist role in the Boxer Uprising and sometimes she was reviled as a member of the &quot;feudalist regime&quot;. When Mao Zedong&#x27;s wife, Jiang Qing, was arrested in 1976 for abuse of power, an exhibit at the Palace Museum put Cixi&#x27;s luxurious goods on display to show that a female ruler weakened the nation.

By the mid-1970s, views among scholars began to change. Sue Fawn Chung&#x27;s doctoral dissertation at University of California, Berkeley, was the first study in English to use court documents rather than popular histories and hearsay. Despite this, writers such as Jung Chang have criticized this narrative and have written works such as Chang&#x27;s &quot;Empress Dowager Cixi: The Concubine Who Launched Modern China&quot; in order to offer an opposing view.

Several widely read popular biographies appeared. Sterling Seagrave&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Lady: The Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China&quot; portrays Cixi as a woman stuck between the xenophobic faction of Manchu nobility and more moderate influences.

In 2013, Jung Chang&#x27;s biography, &quot;Empress Dowager Cixi: The Concubine Who Launched Modern China&quot;, portrays Cixi as the most capable ruler and administrator that China could have had at the time. Pamela Kyle Crossley said in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; that Chang&#x27;s claims &quot;seem to be minted from her own musings, and have little to do with what we know was actually going in China&quot;. Although Crossley was sympathetic to restoring women&#x27;s place in Chinese history, she found &quot;rewriting Cixi as Catherine the Great or Margaret Thatcher is a poor bargain: the gain of an illusory icon at the expense of historical sense&quot;.

<text>Hampshire County Council (HCC) is the upper-tier local authority for the non-metropolitan county of Hampshire in England. The council was created in 1889. The county council provides county-level services to eleven of the thirteen districts geographically located within the ceremonial county of Hampshire. The county council acts as the upper tier of local government to approximately 1.4 million people. It is one of 21 county councils in England.

Whilst they form part of the ceremonial county of Hampshire, the two cities of Southampton and Portsmouth are unitary authorities, independent from Hampshire County Council. The county council comprises 78 elected councillors, who meet in the city of Winchester, which is the county town.

Since 1997, the council has been controlled by the Conservatives.

== History ==
Elected county councils were created in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888, taking over many administrative functions that had previously been performed by unelected magistrates at the Quarter Sessions. The boroughs of Portsmouth and Southampton were both considered large enough to provide their own county-level services, so they became county boroughs, independent from the county council. The county council was elected by and provided services to the remainder of the county outside those two boroughs, which area was termed the administrative county.

The first elections were held in January 1889, and the council formally came into being on 1 April 1889, on which day it held its first official meeting at Winchester Castle. George Sclater-Booth, Lord Basing, a Conservative peer and former Member of Parliament, was appointed the first chairman of the council.

The Isle of Wight was covered by Hampshire County Council when it was created in 1889, but soon after it was decided that the island should have its own county council, and so it was made a separate administrative county with effect from 1 April 1890. Bournemouth was made a county borough in 1900, removing it from the administrative county of Hampshire.

The council&#x27;s legal name until 1959 was the &quot;County Council of the County of Southampton&quot;, although the name &quot;Hampshire County Council&quot; was used informally from the council&#x27;s creation in 1889. The name was officially changed to Hampshire County Council with effect from 1 April 1959.

Local government was reformed in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, which made Hampshire a non-metropolitan county. As part of the 1974 reforms it ceded an area in the south-west of the county including Christchurch to Dorset, but the county council gained authority over Portsmouth and Southampton. The lower tier of local government was rearranged at the same time, with the county being divided into thirteen non-metropolitan districts.

The council was granted a coat of arms in 1992.

In 1997 Portsmouth and Southampton regained their independence from the county council when they were made unitary authorities following a review by Local Government Commission for England. They remain part of the ceremonial county of Hampshire for the purposes of lieutenancy. In 2015 the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Local Government Association unanimously agreed to support a &#x27;pan-Hampshire&#x27; combined authority, but the bid was eventually unsuccessful.

In November 2022, the county council warned it may face bankruptcy within 12 months due to austerity cuts, alongside similar warnings from Kent County Council.

==Governance==
Hampshire County Council provides county-level services. District-level services are provided by the area&#x27;s eleven district councils.
The ceremonial county is divided into thirteen districts, with the county council having responsibility for the eleven districts excluding the two unitary authorities of Portsmouth and Southampton, which area is formally called the non-metropolitan county.

===Political control===
The council has been under Conservative majority control since 1997.

Political control of the council since the 1974 reforms has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1976 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2021 election and changes of allegiance and by-elections up to December 2024, the composition of the council was:
Two of the independent councillors and the Whitehill and Bordon Community Party councillor sit together as the &quot;Independent Group&quot;. The other independent councillor does not belong to any group. The next election is due in 2025.

==Premises==
The council&#x27;s main offices and meeting place are at Winchester Castle, parts of which date back to 1067. The council&#x27;s part of the castle complex is known as Castle Hill and comprises more recent buildings added to the historic castle site, notably in 1895, 1912 and 1933. The council also has area offices in Basingstoke, Farnborough, Havant and Totton.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2017 the council has comprised 78 councillors, representing 76 electoral divisions, with two divisions electing two councillors and the rest electing one each. Elections are held every four years. In February 2025, the government postponed the elections that were due to take place in May 2025 for a year, to allow for alternative local government structures for the area to be considered.

<doc id="264804" wikidata="Q598029" url="?curid=264804" title="Winston Graham">
<text>Winston Mawdsley Graham OBE, born Winston Grime (30 June 1908 – 10 July 2003), was an English novelist best known for the &quot;Poldark&quot; series of historical novels set in Cornwall, though he also wrote numerous other works, including contemporary thrillers, period novels, short stories, non-fiction and plays. Graham was the author&#x27;s pseudonym until he changed his name by deed poll from Grime to Graham on 7 May 1947.

==Biography==
Graham was born in Victoria Park, Manchester, on 30 June 1908. As a child, Graham contracted pneumonia, and on medical advice was educated at a local day school rather than Manchester Grammar School which his father had in mind for him. Graham&#x27;s father, Albert Grime, was a prosperous tea importer and grocer, but became incapacitated by a stroke.

When he was 17 years old, Graham moved to Perranporth, Cornwall, where he lived for 34 years. He had wanted to be a writer from an early age and, following the death of his father, he was supported by his mother while he wrote novels at home in longhand and attempted to get them published.

During his youth, Graham was a keen tennis player and recorded in his diaries how many sets he played each day. He lived in Perranporth from October 1925 until January 1960, then briefly, during the summer of 1960, in the south of France before finally settling in East Sussex. He was a member of the Society of Authors from 1945, chairman of the Society&#x27;s Management Committee from 1967 to 1969 and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. In 1983, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.

In September 1939, Graham married Jean Williamson, having first met her in 1926 when she was 13 years old. She often helped Graham with ideas for his books, and the character of Demelza, in his &quot;Poldark&quot; series, was based in part on her. Graham&#x27;s daughter said, &quot;Father was the author but my mother helped with the details because she was very observant. She saw everything and remembered it all.&quot; Jean died in 1992. They had two children, economist Andrew Graham and Rosamund Barteau.

Graham died on 10 July 2003, aged 95, at his house, &#x27;Abbotswood&#x27; in Buxted, East Sussex. His autobiography, &quot;Memoirs of a Private Man&quot;, was published in September of that year.

==Remembrances and legacy==
The Royal Cornwall Museum in Truro, Cornwall had an exhibition devoted to his life and works (&quot;Poldark&#x27;s Cornwall: The Life and Times of Winston Graham&quot;) from mid-June to mid-September 2008 to celebrate the centenary of his birth, coinciding with re-publication of the &quot;Poldark&quot; novels by Pan Macmillan. Additionally, the Winston Graham Historical Prize was initiated as part of the Centenary Celebrations, funded by a legacy from the author and supported by Pan Macmillan. It is awarded for a work of unpublished fiction, preferably with an association with Cornwall. Details can be obtained from the Royal Cornwall Museum.

The majority of Winston Graham&#x27;s manuscripts and papers have been donated to the Royal Institution of Cornwall by his son Andrew Graham and daughter Rosamund Barteau. Further papers are housed at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University and elsewhere.

==Literary career==

Graham&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The House with the Stained Glass Windows,&quot; was published in 1934.

His first Poldark novel, &quot;Ross Poldark&quot;, was published in 1945 and was succeeded by 11 further titles, the last of which, &quot;Bella Poldark&quot;, was published in 2002. The series was set in Cornwall, especially in and near Perranporth where Graham lived for more than three decades (1925–1960).

In the 1941 spy thriller &quot;Night Journey&quot;, set mostly in Fascist Italy, the protagonist feels that Britain was likely to lose World War II, but is determined to go on fighting against all the odds. This was likely Graham&#x27;s own feeling at the time.

Graham was also an accomplished author of suspense novels and, during the course of his life, wrote 30 novels (in addition to the 12 Poldark books) as well as a volume of short stories (&quot;The Japanese Girl&quot;, 1971) and three non-fiction works. Other than the Poldark novels, Graham&#x27;s most successful works were &quot;Marnie&quot;, a suspense thriller published in 1961 and &quot;The Walking Stick&quot;, published in 1967. In 1955, Graham&#x27;s novel &quot;The Little Walls&quot; won the Crime Writers&#x27; Association&#x27;s first Crime Novel of the Year Award (then called The Crossed Red Herrings Award, later The Gold Dagger).

In 1972, Graham published &quot;The Spanish Armadas&quot;, a factual account of the sixteenth-century Anglo-Spanish conflict. (The plural &quot;Armadas&quot; refers to a lesser-known second attempt by Philip II of Spain to conquer England in 1597, which Graham argued was better planned and organised than the attempt in 1588, but was foiled by a fierce storm scattering the Spanish ships and sinking many of them.) The same is also the subject of a historical novel, &quot;The Grove of Eagles&quot;, set in Elizabethan Cornwall and also depicting the foundation and growth of Falmouth.

Graham wrote at least four plays in the 1930s: &quot;Seven Suspected&quot;, &quot;At Eight O&#x27;Clock Precisely&quot;, &quot;Values&quot; and &quot;Forsaking All Others&quot; and one – &quot;Shadow Play&quot; (renamed &quot;Circumstantial Evidence&quot;) – in the 1970s. The latter was produced professionally at Salisbury (as &quot;Shadow Play&quot;) in 1978 and at Guildford, Birmingham, Bath, Richmond and Brighton (as &quot;Circumstantial Evidence&quot;) in 1979. According to Graham, it &quot;missed London by a hair&quot;. &quot;Seven Suspected&quot; (three acts) was first performed in Perranporth on 30 May 1933 and &quot;At Eight O&#x27;Clock Precisely&quot; (two acts) in Redruth on 18 April 1934, in both cases with the author and his wife-to-be Jean in the cast, &quot;Values&quot; was a one-act play performed by seven members of Perranporth Women&#x27;s Institute at a Truro drama festival in 1936 and the full-length &quot;Forsaking All Others&quot; was not produced at all. (It was, however, revised into the author&#x27;s eighth novel, &quot;Strangers Meeting&quot;.)

Graham&#x27;s books have been translated into 31 languages. His autobiography &quot;Memoirs of a Private Man&quot; was published by Macmillan in September 2003, two months after his death.

==Television and film adaptations of works==
The first seven Poldark novels were adapted into two BBC television series broadcast in the UK between 1975 and 1977, which garnered audiences of about 14 million viewers. The series were so successful that some vicars rescheduled or cancelled church services rather than have them clash with the broadcast of &quot;Poldark&quot; episodes. Graham disliked early episodes of &quot;Poldark&quot; so much (because of the portrayal of Demelza as promiscuous and &#x27;loose&#x27;) that he tried to have the first series cancelled, but could do nothing about it.

The Poldark novels have been adapted for television on two other occasions.

Graham&#x27;s novel &quot;Marnie&quot; (1961), a thriller, was filmed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1964, with Tippi Hedren and Sean Connery in the lead roles.

&quot;Marnie&quot; (1961) was also adapted as a play by Sean O&#x27;Connor in 2001 and an opera written by Nico Muhly which premiered in November, 2017. Both the play and the opera retained the novel&#x27;s British setting and bleak ending.

Five of Graham&#x27;s other books have been filmed:
* &quot;Take My Life&quot; (1947 film co-scripted by Graham and subsequently novelised)
*&quot;Night Without Stars&quot; (1951 film, scripted by Graham, based on the 1950 novel),
*&quot;Fortune Is a Woman&quot; (1957 film released in the United States as &quot;She Played With Fire&quot;; based on the 1952 book &quot;Fortune Is a Woman&quot;),
*&quot;Sócio de Alcova&quot; (1962 Brazil) / &quot;Carnival of Crime&quot; (1964 US), based on the book &quot;The Sleeping Partner&quot; (1956).
* &quot;The Walking Stick&quot; (1970 film based on the 1967 novel).

<text>Harold Andrew Horwood, CM (November 2, 1923 – April 16, 2006) was a Newfoundland and Labrador novelist, non-fiction writer and politician. He was a Member of the Order of Canada.

==Early life==
The son of Andrew Horwood and Vina Maidment, Horwood was born in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. He experienced a love of literature from a young age and while still an adolescent had already decided on a literary career. He pursued this goal despite the objections of his parents, with whom he did not get along, drawing more inspiration from the life of his paternal grandfather, John Horwood, a sea captain.

He was educated at Prince of Wales Collegiate and worked at various labouring jobs for a number of years, which eventually led him to become a labour organizer. Around the same time, he and his brother Charlie founded a literary magazine called &quot;Protocol&quot;. Beginning in 1948 he worked closely with Joey Smallwood in the campaign to bring Newfoundland into Confederation. From 1949 to 1951, he was a member of the Newfoundland House of Assembly, sitting as the member for Labrador for Smallwood&#x27;s Liberals. After leaving politics he started writing a political column for the &quot;Evening Telegram&quot; newspaper. Though he supported Smallwood at first, by the mid-1950s he had become one of the premier&#x27;s harshest critics.

==Writing career==
His first book, &quot;Tomorrow Will be Sunday&quot;, was published in 1966. Though it was a novel, Horwood acknowledged its autobiographical elements. The novel &quot;White Eskimo&quot; (1972), arguably his best-known work, was inspired in part by Esau Gillingham. All told, he wrote more than 20 books, including novels, history, natural history, biography, and autobiography. His contribution to Newfoundland literature does not consist only of the works he produced, but also in the example he provided to young writers at a time when little literature had been produced in the province. However, as his political writing and some of his literature indicates, he did not always hold Newfoundland culture, particularly that of the &#x27;outports&#x27; or fishing villages, in high regard.

==Other activities==
During the 1960s he became an opponent of industrialization and began to interest himself in various &#x27;counter-cultural&#x27; concerns. For a year he ran an alternative school in St. John&#x27;s, known as &quot;Animal Farm&quot;.

Among Horwood&#x27;s other accomplishments were being a founding member and head of the Writers&#x27; Union of Canada, and holding the position of writer-in-residence at the University of Western Ontario and University of Waterloo.

==Later life==
In 1980, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada for his &quot;contributions to Canadian literature&quot;.

He lived his last twenty-five years in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia. He and his wife Cornelia (Corky), whom he married in 1972, had two children, Andrew and Leah. He died of cancer at the age of 82 in Halifax.

<text>Thomas Smyth (1740 – 14 January 1785) was an Irish politician.

==Life==
He was Mayor of Limerick twice (in 1764 and 1776) and Member of Parliament for Limerick City from 1776 until his death. He was appointed High Sheriff of County Limerick for 1770. He was also Colonel of the Limerick Militia. 

He was succeeded in the constituency and in militia by his brother John Prendergast Smyth. John had also inherited the estates of their uncle, Sir Thomas Prendergast, 2nd Baronet, even though Thomas was the oldest son. John was later ennobled as the first Viscount Gort.

==Family==
Smyth was the eldest son of Charles Smyth, MP for Limerick City, and Elizabeth Prendergast. His paternal grandparents were Thomas Smyth, Bishop of Limerick, and Dorothea Burgh (daughter of Ulysses Burgh), and his paternal uncles included the lawyer George Smyth and Arthur Smyth, Archbishop of Dublin. His maternal grandparents were Sir Thomas Prendergast, 1st Baronet, who was killed in action at the Battle of Malplaquet in 1709, and Penelope Cadogan, sister of William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan.

Smyth died unmarried at Bordeaux, but fathered four children, all of whom bore the surname Stuart, including the Indian army officer Charles &quot;Hindoo&quot; Stuart.

<text>Edwin Fuller Uhl (August 14, 1841 – May 17, 1901) was a prominent Michigan lawyer and politician. He served as Mayor of Grand Rapids, Michigan, Ambassador to Germany and United States Assistant Secretary of State.

==Biography==
Uhl was born in the township of Rush, New York, the son of David M. and Catherine (De Garmo) Uhl. The family moved to a farm near Ypsilanti, Michigan, in 1844. Uhl graduated from the University of Michigan in 1862 and received an M.A. degree from the same institution in 1863. He then studied law, gaining admission to the Michigan bar in January 1864, and began practice. He would practice law alone and in partnerships for the next thirty years.

On May 1, 1865, Uhl married Alice Follett, the daughter of Benjamin Follett, a prominent citizen and onetime mayor of Ypsilanti. They had four children: Lucy Follett, David Edwin, Alice Edwina and Marshall Mortimer.

In 1870 Uhl was elected Prosecuting Attorney of Washtenaw County and served in that office for two years. In 1876 the Uhl family moved to Grand Rapids. In 1881 he became president of the Grand Rapids National Bank; he remained in that position until 1893, then returned to it in 1897. At one time he served as President of the Bar Association of Grand Rapids. In 1890 he was elected Mayor of Grand Rapids, serving two years.

In 1893 Uhl was appointed Assistant Secretary of State and moved to Washington, D.C. From May 28 to June 9, 1895, he served as Acting Secretary of State by appointment of President Cleveland. In 1895 the federal government appointed him to inspect US consular offices throughout Europe and in 1896 he was appointed Ambassador to Germany, a post he held until 1897, when the Cleveland administration and its appointees were replaced. He returned to Grand Rapids and resumed his career there until his death four years later.

He is buried in Highland Cemetery in Ypsilanti, Michigan.

<text>The Little Engine That Could is an American folktale existing in the form of several illustrated children&#x27;s books and films. The story originated and evolved in the early 20th century, but became widely known in the United States after publication in 1930 by Platt &amp; Munk. The story is used to teach children the value of optimism and hard work. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot;.

==Background==
The story&#x27;s signature phrases such as &quot;I think I can&quot; first occurred in print in a 1902 article in a Swedish journal. An early published version of the story, &quot;&quot;, appeared in the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; on April 8, 1906, as part of a sermon by the Rev. Charles S. Wing.

A brief version of the tale appeared under the title &quot;&quot; in 1906, in &quot;Wellspring for Young People&quot;, a Sunday school publication. This version reappeared in a 1910 book, &quot;Foundation Stones of Success&quot;.

Another version was published under the name &quot;&quot; in the &quot;Kindergarten Review&quot; in 1910, written by Mary C. Jacobs. A different version with the same title appeared in a magazine for children in 1916 under the name of Mabel C. Bragg, a teacher. She introduced new events to the story, such as the train&#x27;s kid-friendly cargo, but she &quot;took no credit for originating the story&quot;.

The first version with the title &quot;The Little Engine That Could&quot; appeared in 1920 in the U.S., in Volume 1 of &quot;My Book House,&quot; a set of books sold door-to-door. This version began: &quot;Once there was a Train-of-Cars; she was flying across the country with a load of Christmas toys for the children who lived on the other side of the mountain&quot;. The story was labeled, as told by Olive Beaupré Miller, that the first edition gave credit to Bragg, but subsequent editions did not as Miller subsequently concluded that &quot;the story belonged to the realm of folk literature&quot;. Miller was the founding editor and publisher of The Book House for Children, a company based in Chicago. 
The best known incarnation of &quot;The Little Engine That Could&quot; was published in 1930 by &quot;Watty Piper,&quot; pen name of Arnold Munk, who was the owner of the publishing firm Platt &amp; Munk. The title page stated: &quot;Retold by Watty Piper from The Pony Engine by Mabel C. Bragg&#x27;s copyrighted by George H. Doran and Co.&quot; Munk used the name Watty Piper as both an author of children&#x27;s books and as the editor of many of the books that Platt &amp; Munk published. He personally hired Lois Lenski to illustrate the book. 

In 1954, Platt &amp; Munk published another version of &quot;The Little Engine That Could&quot; with slightly revised language and new, more colorful illustrations by George and Doris Hauman. Although there had been many previous editions of this classic story, &quot;it was the work of George and Doris Hauman that earned &quot;The Little Engine&quot; the title of being worthy to sit on the same shelf as &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland.&quot; A 1976 reworking that featured art by Ruth Sanderson received a lot of attention at the time of its release, in part because it prompted a discussion of gender stereotypes.

==Plot==
In the tale, a long train must be pulled over a high mountain after its locomotive breaks down. Larger locomotives, treated anthropomorphically, are asked to pull the train; for various reasons, they refuse because they think they are too important. The request is sent to a small engine, who agrees to try. Despite the steep climb and heavy load, the engine slowly succeeds in pulling the train over the mountain while repeating the motto: &quot;I think I can&quot;.

The story of the little engine has been told and retold many times. The underlying theme is the same—a stranded train is unable to find an engine willing to take it on over difficult terrain to its destination. Only the little engine is willing to try and, while repeating the mantra &quot;I think I can, I think I can&quot;, overcomes a seemingly impossible task.

An early version goes as follows:

A little railroad engine was employed about a station yard for such work as it was built for, pulling a few cars on and off the switches. One morning it was waiting for the next call when a long train of freight-cars asked a large engine in the roundhouse to take it over the hill. &quot;I can&#x27;t; that is too much a pull for me&quot;, said the great engine built for hard work. Then the train asked another engine, and another, only to hear excuses and be refused. In desperation, the train asked the little switch engine to draw it up the grade and down on the other side. &quot;I think I can&quot;, puffed the little locomotive, and put itself in front of the great heavy train. As it went on the little engine kept bravely puffing faster and faster, &quot;I think I can, I think I can, I think I can&quot;.

As it neared the top of the grade, which had so discouraged the larger engines, it went more slowly. However, it still kept saying, &quot;I think I can, I think I can&quot;. It reached the top by drawing on bravery and then went on down the grade, congratulating itself by saying, &quot;I thought I could, I thought I could&quot;.

A Disney version of the story was published in 1976:

The story begins with a toy-filled train pulled by a small red engine on its way to a town on the other side of a mountain but the engine shortly breaks down upon reaching the mountain. The toy clown flags down other engines to help them: a shiny yellow passenger engine and a big black freight engine. The shiny passenger engine and big freight engine both refuse to help. Finally, a little blue engine arrives. Although she is simply a switcher engine and has never been over the mountain, she agrees to help pull the train. In the end, she was able to successfully reach the top of the mountain before slowly heading down towards the town.

==Versions==
Later versions would revamp the story to have a more specific appeal for children – the stranded train is recast as a tank engine pulling good food and anthropomorphic toys for the children across the mountain, thus in saving the train the little engine seems to be working for the benefit of the child reader, making the successful deed all the more triumphant.

In these versions, another character appeared and remained a key part of the story hereafter – the clown ringleader of the toys who attempts to find help with several locomotives but is rebuffed. The number of engines in the story also eventually became standard across the telling: the happy locomotive on the toy train who breaks down and cannot go on, the pompous passenger engine who considers himself too grand for the task and the powerful freight engine who views himself as too important. At least one version includes an old-time engine that says he is &#x27;too tired&#x27; to help. The little blue engine always appears last and, although perhaps reluctant (some editions have the engine clarify her role as a switcher not suited for excursions), always rises to the occasion and saves the day for the children over the mountain.

Each engine is defined by its appearance or function and is not given a name or personality beyond its role on the railroad. It is only in the 1991 film adaption that the engines&#x27; personalities are expanded on, including the granting of names: &quot;Farnsworth&quot; (the express engine), &quot;Pete&quot; (the freight engine), &quot;Jebediah&quot; (the old-time engine), &quot;Georgia&quot; (the friendly engine of the toy train), and &quot;Tillie&quot;, the titular &quot;little engine that could&quot;. The clown was also named &quot;Rollo&quot; and a sixth engine character, &quot;Doc&quot;, appeared briefly to recover the broken-down Georgia and thus tie up the hanging story-thread of what happened to the failed engine of the toy train, which all other versions leave unaddressed. The 2011 adaptation expanded the storyline, this time with the little engine now working in Dreamland with Rusty (an old steam engine) alongside other Dream Haulers, trains that carried dreams to the real world while the original personalities of the previous locomotives are absent from this version.

==Films==
The tale with its easy-to-grasp moral has become a classic children&#x27;s story and was adapted in January 1991 as a 30-minute animated film produced in the United Kingdom and co-financed in the United Kingdom and the United States. The film named the famous little engine &quot;Tillie&quot; and expanded the narrative into a larger story of self-discovery.

In March 2011, the story was adapted as a 3-D film named &quot;The Little Engine That Could&quot;, produced by Universal Studios and featuring the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Jamie Lee Curtis, Alyson Stoner, and Corbin Bleu.

==Song==
Burl Ives recorded the story told as a song &quot;The Little Engine That Could&quot; written by Gerald Marks and Milton Pascal with an orchestra directed by Percy Faith. The song was released on the album &quot;Burl Ives Sings Little White Duck and Other Children&#x27;s Favorites&quot; in 1964.

== &quot;Little Engine&quot; toys and rail tours ==
From 2005 to 2008, a full-size replica of the Little Engine That Could made an annual circuit around the United States. Arranged through Rail Events, Inc., a number of tourist and museum railroad operations hosted the &quot;I Think I Can&quot; Rail Tour. The replica was constructed in 2005 by the Strasburg Rail Road in southeast Pennsylvania who also constructed the &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot; replicas that tour the United States. The last tour was in 2008. In 2009, the replica only appeared at the Texas State Railroad. In 2011, the website for the tour said that there would be dates announced for that year, but dates were never posted and the message was still present in 2012 until it went offline. The last time the train ever operated was on September 16, 2012. As of 2015, the replica is owned by the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad, and has since been repainted to remove all references to the Little Engine That Could. It is currently displayed at the depot. Reasons for why the tour stopped are unknown.

American toy company Whittle Shortline produces wooden toy trains of The Little Engine That Could as a domestic alternative to &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot;. Maxim Enterprise held the license prior to 2006.

=== In popular culture ===
* In the 1941 Disney film &quot;Dumbo&quot; (as well as the Disneyland theme park ride), when Casey Jr. the circus train puffs up a hill, he chants, &quot;I think I can!&quot; and &quot;I thought I could!&quot; when going down the hill.
* The story is incorporated into the 1977 special &quot;The Easter Bunny Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;, in which the engine is named &quot;Chugs&quot; and is commissioned by the Easter Bunny to deliver Easter candy.
* This book was chosen by &quot;Jumpstart Read for the Record&quot; to be read worldwide to tens of thousands of children on August 24, 2006.
* Shel Silverstein wrote the poem &quot;The Little Blue Engine&quot;, which referenced this story.
* A song version co-written by famed &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; writer Warren Foster was covered by John Denver, Burl Ives and Guy Lombardo.
* A custom version of the book is the first shipped to new members of Dolly Parton&#x27;s Imagination Library in the United States, Canada, and the Republic of Ireland.
* Variations of the story are also found in &quot;Choo-Choo, the Little Switch Engine&quot; by Wallace Wadsworth (published by Rand McNally) and in Peter Pan Records&#x27; &quot;Puff &#x27;N Toot&quot;. In these stories, the titular locomotives are tasked with carrying their trains over a nearby steep mountain. Choo-Choo must substitute for a passenger engine who has broken down. Puff &#x27;N Toot, carrying children to a summer campground, is unable to cross a damaged bridge, and must resort to using an old mountain track. The line &quot;I think I can&quot; is replaced with &quot;I gotta make it&quot; in this second story.

<doc id="264814" wikidata="Q1679819" url="?curid=264814" title="Jamaica Bay">
<text>Jamaica Bay (also known as Grassy Bay) is an estuary on the southern portion of the western tip of Long Island, in the U.S. state of New York. The estuary is partially man-made, and partially natural. The bay connects with Lower New York Bay to the west, through Rockaway Inlet, and is the westernmost of the coastal lagoons on the south shore of Long Island. Politically, it is primarily divided between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens in New York City, with a small part touching Nassau County.

The bay contains numerous marshy islands. It was known as &quot;Grassy Bay&quot; as late as the 1940s. Jamaica Bay is located adjacent to the confluence of the New York Bight and New York Bay, and is at the turning point of the primarily east-west oriented coastline of southern New England and Long Island and the north-south oriented coastline of the mid-Atlantic coast.

==Etymology==
The name derives from the nearby town of Jamaica, which in turn derives from &quot;Yameco&quot;, a corruption of a word for &quot;beaver&quot; in the Lenape language spoken by the Native Americans who lived in the area at the time of first European contact. The liquid &quot;y&quot; sound of English is spelled with a &quot;j&quot; in Dutch, the language of the first people to write about the area; the English retained this Dutch spelling, but, after repeated reading and speaking of &quot;Jamaica&quot;, slowly replaced the liquid sound with the hard &quot;j&quot; of the English pronunciation of the name today. (The name of the Caribbean island country Jamaica is unrelated, coming from the Taíno term &quot;Xaymaca&quot;, meaning &quot;land of wood and water&quot; or &quot;land of springs&quot;; the &quot;x&quot; spelling became a hard &quot;j&quot;.)

== Ecology ==
The location of Jamaica Bay, combined with its rich food resources, make it an important habitat for both plants and animals. This geographic location also provides valuable feeding habitat to marine and estuarine species migrating between the New York Bight and the Hudson River and Raritan River estuaries, and to a diverse community of migratory birds and insects that use the Bay for refueling during transit between summer breeding and overwintering grounds. While the resident wildlife of Jamaica Bay are poorly studied, survey data indicate that Jamaica Bay and the Rockaways support seasonal or year-round populations of at least 325 bird species, more than 100 species of fish, and more than 80 butterfly species.

==Geography==
Jamaica Bay is a saline to brackish, eutrophic (nutrient-rich) estuary covering about , with a mean depth of , a semidiurnal tidal range averaging , and a residence time of about three weeks. The bay communicates with Lower New York Bay and the Atlantic Ocean via Rockaway Inlet, a high current area that is wide at its narrowest point, with an average depth of . Measurements taken during recent surveys in Jamaica Bay indicate average yearly ranges for temperature of , salinity of 20.5 to 26 parts per thousand, dissolved oxygen of 3.5 to 18.5 milligrams/liter, and pH of 6.8 to 9. Loadings of nutrients and organic matter into the bay from sewage treatment plants and runoff result in phytoplankton blooms and high suspended-solid concentrations which, in turn, result in turbid water and low bottom dissolved oxygen concentrations.

Jamaica Bay is in the southern portion of the New York metropolitan area, and the uplands around the bay, as well as much of the Rockaway barrier beach, are dominated by urban residential, commercial, and industrial development. The bay itself has been disturbed by dredging, filling, and development. About of the original of wetlands in the bay have been filled in, mostly around the perimeter of the bay. Extensive areas of the bay have been dredged for navigation channels and to provide fill for the airports and other construction projects. This includes John F. Kennedy International Airport (commonly known as JFK Airport) on the northeastern side of the bay, as well as the historic and now-defunct Floyd Bennett Field on the western side.

The center of the bay is dominated by subtidal open water and extensive low-lying islands with areas of salt marsh, intertidal flats, and uplands important for colonial nesting waterbirds. The average mean low tide exposes of mudflat, of low salt marsh dominated by low marsh cordgrass (&quot;Spartina alterniflora&quot;), and of high marsh dominated by high marsh cordgrass (&quot;Spartina patens&quot;). The extensive intertidal areas are rich in food resources, including a variety of benthic invertebrates and macroalgae dominated by sea lettuce (&quot;Ulva latuca&quot;). These rich food resources attract a variety of fish, shorebirds, and waterfowl. In addition, two freshwater impoundments were created on Rulers Bar Hassock in the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge; the smaller freshwater West Pond is kept as open water, and the larger slightly brackish East Pond is controlled to expose mudflats. Some of the islands in the bay have upland communities, including grasslands consisting of little bluestem (&quot;Schizachyrium scoparium&quot;), switchgrass (&quot;Panicum virgatum&quot;), and seaside goldenrod (&quot;Solidago sempervirens&quot;); scrub-shrub containing bayberry (&quot;Myrica pensylvanica&quot;), beach plum (&quot;Prunus maritima&quot;), sumac (&quot;Rhus&quot; spp.), and poison ivy (&quot;Toxicodendron radicans&quot;); developing woodland consisting of hackberry (&quot;Celtis occidentalis&quot;), willow (&quot;Salix&quot; spp.), black cherry (&quot;Prunus serotina&quot;), and tree-of-heaven (&quot;Ailanthus altissima&quot;); and beachgrass (&quot;Ammophila breviligulata&quot;) dune. Species introduced in the refuge to attract wildlife include autumn olive (&quot;Elaeagnus umbellata&quot;), Japanese black pine (&quot;Pinus thunbergii&quot;), and Japanese barberry (&quot;Berberis thunbergii&quot;).

==History==
===Seaport proposals===
Some modifications to Jamaica Bay were conducted in the early 20th century as a result of a never-realized plan to develop Jamaica Bay as a seaport. As early as 1886, the U.S. Engineering Department (a part of the Army Corps of Engineers) had created plans to dredge Rockaway Inlet in preparation for constructing a large seaport in Jamaica Bay. These plans were scrapped because there was not enough commercial traffic to justify the construction. Over the next two decades, commercial activity in New York City increased. New proposals for the Jamaica Bay seaport emerged in the 1900s. By 1905, the value of the city&#x27;s manufacturing sector was assessed at $1.5 billion, a figure cited by supporters of the Jamaica Bay project.

In 1910, developers unveiled a plan to convert Jamaica Bay to a seaport district as part of the New York State Barge Canal project, which would connect Hudson River to the Great Lakes by way of a new canal in upstate New York. The new seaport would convert existing inland creeks into barge canals with lengths of up to , and the area of the bay was to be dredged. An aggregate of marshlands in the bay would be converted to land that could be built upon, while residential communities would be built on Long Island for port workers. Railroads would be built to collect cargo from piers, and a canal would extend northward across Long Island to the Long Island Sound.

The project began in 1911, despite doubts about the feasibility of the project. Some engineers believed that shifting sand dunes and the tides in Jamaica Bay might make it impossible to construct the seaport district. The next year, developers began dredging within Jamaica Bay in order to make it navigable for the large vessels that were supposed to use the bay. Significant progress on the dredging had been completed by 1918, and the city allowed the construction of several piers. However, only one pier was built near Barren Island. The pier, which was to receive landfill for the other proposed piers, stretched northeast and was wide. A total of six such piers were planned for this area. In June 1918, a municipally owned pier was opened at Mill Basin. At the time, there were proposals to fill in between Mill and Barren Islands so 14 more piers could be built. With the United States&#x27; entry into World War I, the project was abandoned.

The plans were revived by 1927. At the time, the docklands were expected to gain a connection to the Long Island Rail Road. Planners wanted to create a spur of the Bay Ridge Branch south to Flatlands, with two branches to Canarsie and Mill Basin. A connection to Staten Island would be built via the planned Staten Island Tunnel, which would in turn allow freight to be delivered and shipped to the rest of the continental United States. By 1928, the Barren Island Airport was being constructed on the bay&#x27;s west shore, and advocates for the seaport project were pushing the city to construct the docklands simultaneously. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey offered to build the new railroad link for $2 million and lease it to the city. In 1930, the city approved of a report recommending the acquisition of a right-of-way for a proposed LIRR branch to Paerdegat Basin. The railroad would connect to the New York Connecting Railroad, which would then connect to the national railroad system at large. Dredging Paerdegat Basin was a key part of the plan, as it would allow easier access for ships headed to Canarsie. As part of the updated proposal, two artificial islands for shipping operations would be built in Jamaica Bay.

In January 1931, the New York City Board of Estimate approved a plan to build railroads on both sides of Paerdegat Basin, connecting the LIRR to Canarsie Pier to the east and to Floyd Bennett Field to the west. By that time, the city had spent $10 million, and the federal government $2 million, toward improving the bay for a proposed seaport district. Supporters of the new proposal included Mayor Jimmy Walker, President of Aldermen Fiorello La Guardia, City Comptroller Charles Berry, and Brooklyn&#x27;s and Queens&#x27; borough presidents. New Jersey opposed the Jamaica Bay project, since it wanted to build the competing Port of Newark. There was enough federal money for both projects, though. However, Robert Moses, the New York City Parks Commissioner at the time, was critical of the seaport project. He instead proposed a series of parks and parkways around New York City, including Belt Parkway along the northern and western shores of Jamaica Bay. Under Moses&#x27;s leadership, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation moved to convert much of the Jamaica Bay area into a city park. In 1949, the New York City Board of Estimate approved Moses&#x27;s proposal, ending all plans for the seaport project. The only thing that was completed was the dredging of Paerdegat Basin to a depth. In the 1950s and 1960s, much of the city-owned land around the basin was sold off to private developers.

===Incidents===
On March 1, 1962, American Airlines Flight 1, a Boeing 707, crashed on takeoff from JFK Airport after its rudder jammed. It crashed into Pumpkin Patch Channel, a remote area of marshland on Jamaica Bay that is part of the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge. All 95 people on board were killed, including 87 passengers and 8 crew members.

On November 12, 2001, American Airlines Flight 587, an Airbus A300, crashed after takeoff from JFK Airport after its vertical stabilizer separated in-flight and landed in Jamaica Bay. The aircraft crashed into Belle Harbor, Queens. All 260 people on board were killed, as well as five more people on the ground.

==Environmental conditions==
The salt marshes of Jamaica Bay offer prime habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife. Most of the waters and marshes have been protected since 1972 as part of the Gateway National Recreation Area. Though much improved, pollution is still a problem, and after once enjoying a worldwide reputation for oysters and supporting a vigorous fishing industry the area has been closed to shellfishing since the early 20th century. The marshlands are also fast diminishing.

Within Jamaica Bay, of marshland disappeared between 1924 and 1974, of which was due to land filling and dredging. Another disappeared in 1974–1994, and was lost during 1994–1999. By 2007, the bay was losing wetlands at a rate of a year, nearly twice the rate in 2001. As of 2003, marshland is being lost at the rate of approximately per year. The reasons for this loss are still unclear, but one hypothesis is that the loss is the result of rising sea levels. To test this, in the hope of preventing further losses, the National Park Service plans to dredge a small area of the bay in order to build up the soil in about of marsh. Opponents are concerned that the dredging may be harmful, perhaps leading to greater loss of marshland than the area saved.

Other scientists suggest that the of nitrogen pouring into the bay every day, 92 percent from four sewage treatment plants ringing the bay, may be partly to blame. They hypothesize that the high levels of nitrogen may stimulate the growth of sea lettuce, smothering other plants. The excess energy may also cause smooth cordgrass to reallocate energy from its roots to its shoots, making it harder for marsh soil to hold together.

The loss of marshlands has also contributed to flooding in communities surrounding the bay. In 2020 alone, surrounding neighborhoods were flooded 15 times; dredging, the loss of marshland, and global sea-level rise contributed to the flooding in nearly all of these cases. In an effort to reduce the amount of nitrogen being discharged into Jamaica Bay, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection announced the installation of enhanced treatment measures. An innovative technology, called the Ammonia Recovery Process, is now being designed by ThermoEnergy Corporation, which will further reduce nitrogen discharges from the bay by 3,000 pounds per day by 2014.

==Ownership and protection status==

The majority of land and water within this complex is owned by the United States federal government, and the city of New York. Most of Jamaica Bay proper and portions of the uplands and barrier beach are part of the Gateway National Recreation Area&#x27;s Jamaica Bay Unit. Administered by the National Park Service, the Jamaica Bay Unit includes the of Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, as well as Breezy Point Tip, Fort Tilden, Jacob Riis Park and Floyd Bennett Field. There are two state parks at Jamaica Bay, Shirley Chisholm, and Bayswater Point.

There are several city parks within the bay complex, including Marine Park, Spring Creek Park and Rockaway Community Park, and numerous smaller parcels of city-owned land such as Tribute Park and Sunset Cove at Broad Channel. Portions of the wetlands and uplands are part of JFK Airport, owned by the city of New York and operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Occasionally the airport becomes a route of migration of some wildlife species disrupting the traffic. Small areas in the upland buffer around the bay and on the Rockaway Peninsula remain in private residential or commercial ownership.

Jamaica Bay has been designated and mapped as an otherwise protected beach unit pursuant to the federal Coastal Barrier Resources Act, prohibiting incompatible federal financial assistance or flood insurance within the unit. The New York State Natural Heritage Program, in conjunction with The Nature Conservancy, recognizes two Priority Sites for Biodiversity within the Jamaica Bay and Breezy Point habitat complex: Breezy Point (B2 – very high biodiversity significance) and Fountain Avenue Landfill (B3 – high biodiversity significance). Jamaica Bay and Breezy Point have been designated as Significant Coastal Fish and Wildlife Habitats by the New York State Department of State, and the bay up to the high tide line was designated as a Critical Environmental Area by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. Jamaica Bay was also designated as one of three special natural waterfront areas by the New York City Department of City Planning. A comprehensive watershed management plan for the bay was completed in 1993 by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection in order to better protect and restore habitats and improve water quality. Wetlands are regulated in New York under the state&#x27;s Freshwater Wetlands Act of 1975 and Tidal Wetlands Act of 1977. These statutes are in addition to federal regulation under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, and various Executive Orders.

== Science and Resilience Institute at Jamaica Bay ==
In 2012, the City of New York and the National Park Service signed an agreement to jointly manage Jamaica Bay and restore its parkland and greenspaces. Hurricane Sandy hit the city in force in October 2012, causing billions of dollars of damage, and inundating coastal regions, including Jamaica Bay, with a storm surge estimated at close to 2.5 meters. The impact of Hurricane Sandy revealed the vulnerability of the city&#x27;s coastal infrastructure to storm surges, and with projections suggesting that the frequency of such storms is likely to increase over the coming century, New York City released &quot;A Stronger, More Resilient New York&quot; in June 2013, an extensive report outlining a plan to reinforce and rebuild NYC infrastructure in order to create a city better able to withstand future storms. Later that year, Mayor Bloomberg, together with the then Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell, announced the establishment of the Jamaica Bay Science and Resilience Institute, a multidisciplinary consortium of academic, governmental and community partners coordinated by the City University of New York. The Institute, subsequently renamed the Science and Resilience Institute at Jamaica Bay (SRIJB), is currently housed at Brooklyn College, but will be relocating to a permanent home at Floyd Bennett Field within the next 3 years..

<text>Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge is a wildlife refuge in New York City managed by the National Park Service as part of Gateway National Recreation Area. It is composed of the open water and intertidal salt marshes and wetlands of Jamaica Bay. It lies entirely within the boundaries of New York City, divided between the boroughs of Brooklyn to the west and Queens to the east.

==Description==
Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge consists of several islands in Jamaica Bay, located in both Brooklyn and Queens. The Queens portion is located near John F. Kennedy International Airport, which was built upon a portion of the wetlands in Jamaica Bay. In April 1942, the City of New York started placing hydraulic fill over the marshy tidelands of the area. JFK International Airport is now the sixth busiest airport in the United States, and the aviation traffic may pose some serious noise pollutant threats to the surrounding environment.

The extent of the refuge is mostly open water, but includes upland shoreline and islands with salt marsh, dunes, brackish ponds, woodland and fields. It is the only &quot;wildlife refuge&quot; in the National Park System. Originally created and managed by New York City as a wildlife refuge, the term was retained by Gateway when the site was transferred in 1972. Usually, federal wildlife refuges are managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Features created under city ownership include two large freshwater ponds. A visitor center with a parking lot provides free permits to walk the trails. The two main trails go around the East Pond and the West Pond. The West Pond and its trail, however, were breached by Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

== Fauna ==
The refuge provides habitat for a wide variety of flora and fauna, both marine and terrestrial. With resident and migratory birds, it is a prime location for birding in New York City. Other animal activities include diamondback terrapin egg laying and horseshoe crab mating and egg laying. The primary diet of the diamondback terrapins include fish, snails, worms, clams, crabs and marsh plants, many of which are abundant in these particular marshlands. Ospreys, which were at one time endangered due to the pesticide DDT, have regularly nested in the refuge since 1991. They are currently being captured, tagged and studied in the Wildlife Refuge to help scientists better understand the birds&#x27; habits. Small mammals such as eastern gray squirrels and raccoons are also present in the area. The recently increased raccoon population, however, has developed a taste for diamondback terrapin eggs, and many nests are often destroyed only 24 hours after being laid.

==History==

Planning of the wildlife refuge started as early as 1938 by New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) commissioner Robert Moses, who wished to rezone the area around Jamaica Bay to prevent any more industries from being built around it. By 1941, Moses planned to convert Jamaica Bay into a recreation center. In 1945, he asked the New York City Board of Estimate to transfer control of Jamaica Bay to NYC Parks so he could convert the bay into what &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;a haven for wild life and a mecca for fishermen and boating enthusiasts&quot;. After about twelve years of planning, Moses broke ground on the park in 1950.

Moses is credited for introducing the idea of creating nonindigenous freshwater ponds on each side of the refuge. Having freshwater ponds in proximity of the bay&#x27;s saltwater marshland would attract more varieties of wildlife. About 84,000 workers were employed for the development of the park.

===Early years===
The first phase of the project was completed in 1953, and Herbert Johnson was appointed as the refuge&#x27;s first superintendent. The site quickly became a haven for waterfowl and other birds; 208 species of birds were identified in the park&#x27;s first five years. The refuge attracted species such as black skimmers and snowy egrets, which had not been seen in the New York City area in several decades. Other wildlife such as black bears, coyotes, elk, and even wolves could be found in the park during the early years. Many birdwatchers had begun visiting the park by the late 1950s.

Control of the site passed in 1972 to the National Park Service, which administers the refuge as part of the Gateway National Recreation Area.

=== 21st century ===

As a result of climate change, the Jamaica Bay area faces effects such as salt marsh erosion, rising sea levels, and flooding. In 2012, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar authorized the creation of the Jamaica Bay-Rockaway Parks Conservancy, Inc. (JBRPC). The public-private organization was officially established in 2013, partners with the National Park Service, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation and the New York State Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, and is &quot;dedicated to improving the 10,000 acres of public parkland throughout Jamaica Bay and the Rockaway peninsula for local residents and visitors alike.&quot; Other organizations dedicated to the preservation of the bay include Jamaica Bay Ecowatchers and The American Littoral Society. 

In 2016, David Segal and David Hendrick released the documentary &quot;Saving Jamaica Bay&quot;, narrated by actress Susan Sarandon. The film portrays the history of the national wildlife refuge and current efforts to preserve the natural landscape and wildlife.

In 2018, it was estimated that 365 species have been identified in the park. Out of 417 U.S. national parks, Jamaica Bay ranks second in bird population, higher than Yellowstone or Yosemite.

A $400 million restoration project was begun in 2018 to combat erosion and pollution, remove maritime debris, and clean up storm damage remaining from Hurricane Sandy. The West Pond Loop at the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge reopened in November 2021 after a restoration.

<doc id="264833" wikidata="Q3476695" url="?curid=264833" title="Seamus Mallon">
<text>Seamus Frederick Mallon ( ; 17 August 1936 – 24 January 2020) was an Irish politician who served as deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland from 1998 to 2001 and Deputy Leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) from 1979 to 2001. He also sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1986 to 2005.

==Background==
Seamus Mallon was born in the largely Protestant village of Markethill to Jane (née O&#x27;Flaherty) and Francis Mallon, and was educated at the Abbey Christian Brothers Grammar School in Newry and St Patrick&#x27;s Grammar School, Armagh. He came from a family of Republicans, and his father was a former IRA man who had fought in the Irish Civil War. His mother, Jane, also from a Republican family, was from Castlefin, a village in the east of County Donegal. 

He trained to be a teacher at St Mary&#x27;s University College, Belfast. As a career he (like his father) chose teaching, and became headmaster of St James&#x27;s Primary School in Markethill. Mallon was also involved in the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), playing Gaelic football for the Armagh county team. He first played club football for Middletown during the 1950s then with Keady Dwyers, Queen&#x27;s University and Crossmaglen Rangers.

He was also involved in amateur drama and wrote a play which won an All-Ireland amateur drama play award.

==Introduction to politics==
During the 1960s, Mallon was involved in the civil rights movement, especially in his native County Armagh. He first got involved in the 1960s when trying to help a man and his family secure a council house, but was told by a local unionist councillor that &quot;No Catholic pig or his litter will get a house here as long as I am here.&quot;

In 1979, when John Hume went from being deputy leader of the SDLP (under Gerry Fitt) to leader, Mallon became deputy leader. He was elected to the first power-sharing Assembly in 1973, and to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention in 1975 representing Armagh. Between May and December 1982 he was appointed by the then Taoiseach Charles Haughey to the Republic&#x27;s upper house, Seanad Éireann.

Mallon was a strong advocate of non-violent nationalism, and opposed political violence. In an interview with Eilis O&#x27;Hanlon he recalled seeing his own close friend&#x27;s dead body after being murdered by loyalists and having witnessed two RUC members bleeding to death after being murdered in an IRA ambush in Markethill.

==1982 Assembly and Westminster==
In 1982, Mallon was elected to the new Northern Ireland Assembly, set up as part of then-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Prior&#x27;s rolling devolution. However, due to his membership of the Seanad he was, following a challenge by Unionist politicians, disqualified. Under legislation of the time, no elected member of a British parliament or regional assembly could serve in a parliament outside the United Kingdom or Commonwealth without losing their British seat. That restriction was removed with regard to the Oireachtas by the Disqualifications Act 2000.

In 1986, he was elected to Westminster as an MP for Newry and Armagh, a seat he held until 2005. In a 1993 parliamentary debate on anti-terrorism legislation Mallon addressed the ineffectiveness of these types of legislation: &quot;From the very day and hour that the state was formed it has been sustained by draconian emergency legislation, military might, soldiers, not one police service but on certain occasions two and on others three, and by the inpouring of billions of pounds--according to the Secretary of State, £3.5 billion last year. There is a fundamental question to be asked outside of the legalities of the emergency provisions legislation, of the statistics and of the emotions that it engenders. Where a state or a statelet is formed with the weight of the British Government behind it in military and financial terms and in terms of the emergency provisions legislation, the Prevention of Terrorism Acts and the Special Powers Act and still the problem remains, is there not a fundamental question to ask? Is it not even more fundamental to ask why, after 72 years, all those measures have never brought peace, stability or unity of purpose to the north of Ireland?&quot; 

Mallon won the seat in a by-election to replace Jim Nicholson, who had resigned his seat in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement, along with all the other Northern Irish unionist MPs. Nicholson was the only MP to fail to be re-elected.

==Peace process and 1998 Assembly==
Mallon was elected to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in 1994. He was a member of the SDLP team at the all-party negotiations (the &#x27;Stormont talks&#x27;) that opened in Belfast in June 1996. He has frequently been quoted as saying that the Good Friday Agreement, which resulted from the talks in 1998, was &quot;Sunningdale for slow learners&quot;. The Good Friday Agreement led to the setting up of the Northern Ireland Assembly, which was elected in June 1998, with a power-sharing Executive. Mallon was elected as member for Newry and Armagh, and in December 1999 became Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, serving alongside Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble.

Mallon remained a strong opponent of IRA violence, and was also in favour of police reform in Northern Ireland.

==Retirement==
He retired in 2001, along with John Hume, from the leadership of the SDLP. Mark Durkan replaced both, Hume as leader and Mallon as Deputy First Minister, when the Northern Ireland Executive was re-established following a suspension.

Mallon did not contest his seat in the Stormont Assembly in the 2003 elections, and stood down at the 2005 Westminster election. Dominic Bradley was nominated to contest the seat Mallon vacated, but failed to re-capture the seat as Conor Murphy of Sinn Féin won.

Mallon was conferred with the Freedom of Drogheda in 2018.

His autobiography, &quot;A Shared Home Place&quot;, written with Andy Pollak, was published in 2019.

In retirement, Mallon spent much of his time in County Donegal, his mother&#x27;s native county.

==Personal life==
During his time in politics, Mallon lived in his hometown of Markethill, in a house with bulletproof windows installed.

He was a lifelong smoker and drinker who suffered from heart problems throughout his life, having his first heart attack in 1980.

His wife Gertrude (&quot;née&quot; Cush) died in October 2016. Their daughter Órla is married with one child.

Mallon had retired to his second home in County Donegal for a while, but when his wife&#x27;s health began to fail he moved back to Markethill to care for her, and continued to live in Markethill after her death.

Mallon died at his home in Markethill on 24 January 2020, aged 83. He had been treated for cancer before his death. SDLP Stormont leader, Nichola Mallon (no relation) paid tribute to Seamus Mallon in the Assembly; describing him as &quot;a man of peace&quot; and &quot;an Irish political giant&quot;. Many world leaders paid tribute to Mallon after his death. Former US president Bill Clinton paid tribute by saying &quot;Seamus never wavered from his vision for a shared future where neighbors of all faiths could live in dignity, or from the belief he shared with John Hume and the entire SDLP that nonviolence was the only way to reach that goal.&quot;

<text>Washington is a town in the Sunderland district, in Tyne and Wear, England. Historically part of County Durham, it is the ancestral settlement of the local Washington family, from which the first President of the United States George Washington descended. It has a population of 67,085.

It is located between Chester-le-Street, Gateshead and South Tyneside. Washington was designated a new town in 1964. It became part of Tyne and Wear in 1974. The town has expanded dramatically since its designation; new villages were created and areas were reassigned from Chester-le-Street, to offer housing and employment to those moving from adjoining areas and further afield. At the 2011 census, Washington had a population of 67,085, compared to 53,388 in 2001.

== History ==
===Toponymy===
Early references appear around 1096 in Old English as Wasindone. The etymological origin is disputed and there are several proposed theories for how the name &quot;Washington&quot; came about. Early interpretations included Wasindone (&quot;people of the hill by the stream&quot;, 1096), or Wassyngtona (&quot;settlement of Wassa&#x27;s people&quot;, 1183).

==== Hwæsa ====
The origins of the name &quot;Washington&quot; are not fully known. The most supported theory (especially amongst local historians) is that &quot;Washington&quot; is derived from Anglo-Saxon &quot;Hwæsingatūn&quot;, which roughly means &quot;estate of the descendants (family) of Hwæsa&quot;. &quot;Hwæsa&quot; (usually rendered &quot;Wassa&quot; or &quot;Wossa&quot; in modern English) is an Old English name meaning &quot;wheat sheaf&quot;.

Due to the evolution of English grammar, modern English lacks the Germanic grammatical features that permeated Anglo-Saxon English. This causes confusion for many in regard to the name &quot;Hwæsingatūn&quot;. It is essentially composed of three main (albeit grammatically altered) elements:
*&quot;Hwæsa&quot; – most likely the name of a local Anglo-Saxon chieftain or farmer.
*&quot;ing&quot; – a Germanic component that has lost its original context in English: &quot;ing&quot; means roughly &quot;[derived] of/from&quot;. In the name &quot;Hwæsingatūn&quot;, &quot;ing&quot; is conjugated to &quot;inga&quot; in accordance with the genitive plural declension of OE.
*&quot;tūn&quot; – root of the modern English &quot;town&quot;, and is a cognate of German &quot;Zaun&quot; (fence), Dutch &quot;tuin&quot; (garden) and Icelandic &quot;tún&quot; (paddock). The word means &quot;fenced off estate&quot; or more accurately &quot;estate with defined boundaries&quot;.

The combined elements (with all correct conjugations in place) therefore create the name &quot;Hwæsingatūn&quot; with a full and technical meaning of &quot;the estate of the descendants of Hwæsa&quot;.

However, there has been no evidence found of any chieftain/land owner/farmer in the area by the name of &quot;Hwæsa&quot;, although any such records from the time would likely have been long lost by now.

====Washing====
Another of the popular origin theories is that &quot;Washington&quot; is in fact derived from the Old English verb &quot;wascan&quot; and the noun &quot;dūn&quot; meaning &quot;hill&quot;; thus making the name &quot;Wascandūn&quot;, meaning &quot;washing hill&quot;. This theory likely originates from the proximity of the river Wear to the actual Anglo-Saxon hall at the time (most likely where Washington Old Hall stands today).

This idea is not backed by linguistic evidence. Combining the two Old English words &quot;wascan&quot; and &quot;dūn&quot; would actually have meant &quot; hill&quot; and not &quot; hill&quot;. Also, the Old English &quot;dūn&quot; meant a range of gently rolling hills, as evidenced by the naming of the North and South Downs in southern England.

=== Old Hall ===

The Old Hall may have been built by William de Hertburn, who moved to the area in 1183. As was the custom, he took the name of his new estates (Wessyngtonlands), and became William de Wessyngton. By 1539, when the family moved to Sulgrave Manor in Northamptonshire, the spelling &quot;Washington&quot; had been adopted.

The present Hall is an early 17th-century small English manor house of sandstone. Only the foundations and the arches between the Kitchen and the Great Hall remain of the original house.

=== George Washington connection ===
William de Wessyngton (originally William Bayard, later de Hertburne) was a forebear of George Washington, the first president of the United States, after whom the US capital, a state and many other places in the United States are named. Though George Washington&#x27;s great-grandfather John Washington left for Virginia from Northamptonshire in the East Midlands region of England, Washington Old Hall was the family home of George Washington&#x27;s ancestors. The present structure incorporates small parts of the medieval home in which they lived. American Independence Day is marked each year by a ceremony at Washington Old Hall.

===Dame Margaret&#x27;s Hall===

Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell and his wife Margaret, grandparents of Gertrude Bell, lived in Washington New Hall on The Avenue. After Margaret&#x27;s death in 1871, Sir Isaac set up an orphanage in the house, named Dame Margaret Home in his late wife&#x27;s honour. It later became a Dr Barnardo&#x27;s home until World War II. After the war, it was taken over by the National Coal Board as a training centre, and then a children&#x27;s home again. It is now a number of private apartments.

=== Building the &quot;New Town&quot; ===

Washington&#x27;s design was developed through the New Towns concept aiming to achieve sustainable socio-economic growth. The new town is divided into 18 residential &quot;villages&quot;. It was originally also divided into the 15 numbered districts, which confused many visitors to the area. The numbered districts were abolished in 1983 though survived for a while on road signs and in postal addresses.

Land in the south west of the area designated for the town was purchased from the Lambton family, the Earls of Durham. Their estate of the same name includes their ancestral home, Lambton Castle.
In 1970, Washington hosted the English Schools Athletic Association (ESAA) annual National Championships, attended by the then Lord Lieutenant of County Durham. On 15 November 1977, the very first SavaCentre hypermarket (a Sainsbury&#x27;s and British Home Stores joint venture) opened at The Galleries. By 2005, however, it had been rebranded as a traditional Sainsbury&#x27;s as the SavaCentre brand was phased out.
==Geography==
The town is made up of villages and includes the five ancient townships of Washington. Its villages are:
*Albany
*Ayton
*Barmston (an ancient township)
*Biddick (previously North Biddick, an ancient township)
*Blackfell
*Columbia (previously Washington Station)
*Concord (previously New Washington and Little Usworth)
*Donwell
*Fatfield
*Glebe
*Harraton
*Lambton
*Mount Pleasant (which is south of the River Wear and shares the DH4 Postcode with Houghton le Spring)
*Oxclose
*Rickleton
*Sulgrave
*Usworth (previously Great or High Usworth, an ancient township)
*Washington Village (the original township and location of the Old Hall).

The town also has ten industrial estates, some of which are named after famous northern engineers, such as Parsons, Armstrong, Stephenson, Phineas Crowther, Pattinson, Swan and Emerson.

==Community and culture==

The has a Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust nature reserve and The &quot;Washington &#x27;F&#x27; Pit mining museum&quot;. The Washington Arts Centre is a converted farm building. The Centre includes an exhibition gallery, community theatre, artist studios and a recording studio. The North East Land, Sea and Air Museums is just north of the old RAF Usworth base. The Nissan plant takes up much of the rest. The municipal airport previously run from the site was closed in 1984 to make way for the Nissan plant.

== Industry ==

Historically, Washington was heavily involved in the coal industry with a number of pits. One of these in the Albany district of Washington is preserved as the &#x27;F&#x27; Pit Museum (Washington colliery shafts alphabetically A to I e.g. the &#x27;F&#x27; Pit). A number of the old communities of Washington grew up around the pits (e.g. Little Usworth grew up around the Usworth Colliery before being renamed Sulgrave. In support of the mines, there was a series of wagonways and later railway lines to transport the coal. The wagonways took coal to Staithes on the River Wear, where it could be loaded onto barges to be taken to the seagoing vessels at Sunderland.

Washington was also involved in the chemical industry and the Washington Chemical Works was a major employer in the 19th century. This later became the Cape/Newalls Works, which produced insulation. The Pattinson Town area of Washington grew up around the chemical works. This area is now the Pattinson South industrial estate and the Teal Farm housing estate.

Currently, Washington&#x27;s main industries include electronics, car assembly, chemicals, electrical goods and government offices at the Town Centre and beside the Wetlands Centre. The Nissan automotive plant is the largest car assembler in Britain and the largest private-sector employer in the City of Sunderland.

Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, the American tyre production giant, opened a new factory in Washington in 1968, which later became Dunlop and Sumitomo Tyres. However, it closed on 5 July 2006 with the loss of 585 jobs. The site is now occupied by Rolls-Royce Holdings making aero engine blades, and British Aerospace.

== Transport ==
There is a major bus station situated at The Galleries, and another at Concord in the north of Washington. The primary provider of transport (buses) in the area is Go North East, with local services as well as connections to Newcastle upon Tyne, Sunderland, and many other towns and cities in the region.

Major roads run through Washington: the A182, the A1231 (Sunderland Highway) and the A195 all connect to the A1(M) motorway (which acts as the western boundary of Washington proper) or its feeder, the A194. Washington Services is situated between Junctions 64 and 65 of the A1(M), and incorporates a Travelodge.

The town&#x27;s closed to passengers in the 1960s due to the Beeching cuts and to freight in 1991. The now overgrown site is on the disused Leamside Line which connected and via the town to . The line was lifted and mothballed by Network Rail and partly is in use as an unmarked footpath. In June 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies called for a scheme funding the reopening of 33 stations (including the town&#x27;s station) on 14 lines closed by the Beeching Axe and seven new-build parkway stations. The first stage of a business case was published in 2022, this involved extending the Tyne and Wear Metro to Washington if Government funding was secured.

<text>Marnie is a 1964 American psychological thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock from a screenplay by Jay Presson Allen, based on the 1961 novel of the same name by Winston Graham. The film stars Tippi Hedren and Sean Connery.

&quot;Marnie&quot; became a milestone for several reasons. It was the last time a &quot;Hitchcock blonde&quot; would have a central role in one of his films. It also marked the end of Hitchcock&#x27;s collaborations with cinematographer Robert Burks, who died in 1968; editor George Tomasini, who died soon after &quot;Marnie&quot; release; and composer Bernard Herrmann, who was fired during Hitchcock&#x27;s next film, &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; (1966), when Hitchcock and Universal studio executives wanted a pop-and-jazz-influenced score for the film.

==Plot==
Margaret &quot;Marnie&quot; Edgar, posing under the identity Marion Holland, flees with nearly $10,000 that she stole from the company safe of her employer, Sidney Strutt. Strutt is the head of a tax consulting company, where she had been working after charming him into hiring her without references. Mark Rutland, a wealthy widower who owns a publishing company in Philadelphia, meets with Strutt on business; he learns about the theft and recalls Marnie from a previous visit.

Marnie travels to Virginia, where she stables a horse named Forio. She then visits her invalid mother, Bernice, whom she supports financially, in Baltimore. Marnie suffers from recurring nightmares and has an intense aversion to the color red, which triggers her hysteria.

Some months later, Marnie, posing as Mary Taylor, applies for a job at Mark&#x27;s company. Mark hires her after recognizing her, cryptically telling his co-worker why he is accepting an applicant without references that he is an &quot;interested spectator.&quot; While working weekend overtime with Mark, Marnie has a panic attack during a thunderstorm. Mark comforts, then kisses her. They begin dating.

Soon afterwards, Marnie steals money from Mark&#x27;s company and flees again. Mark tracks her to the stable where she keeps Forio. He blackmails her into marrying him, much to the chagrin of Lil, the sister of Mark&#x27;s late wife Estelle, who is in love with him. Lil grows suspicious when she discovers Mark has spent a considerable sum since marrying Marnie.

On their honeymoon cruise, Marnie resists Mark&#x27;s desire for physical intimacy, revealing that she finds sex repellent. Mark initially respects her wishes, and tries to woo her, but after a few nights, they quarrel over Marnie&#x27;s aloofness, and it is implied that he rapes her offscreen when he persists and she freezes without consent. The next morning, she attempts to drown herself in the ship&#x27;s swimming pool, but Mark saves her.

After overhearing Marnie on a phone call, Lil tips off Mark that Marnie&#x27;s mother is not dead, as Marnie claimed. Mark hires a private detective to investigate. Meanwhile, Lil overhears Mark telling Marnie he has &quot;paid off Strutt&quot; on her behalf. Lil mischievously invites Strutt and his wife to a party at the Rutland mansion. Strutt recognizes Marnie, but Mark pressures him into doing nothing. When Marnie later admits to additional robberies, Mark works to reimburse her victims to drop charges.

Mark brings Forio to their estate, pleasing Marnie. During a fox hunt, the red riding coat worn by one of the hunters triggers another of Marnie&#x27;s fits and Forio bolts, misses a jump, injures its legs, and is left lying on the ground screaming in pain. Marnie frantically runs to a nearby house, obtains a gun, and shoots her horse in an act of animal euthanasia. Overcome with grief, Marnie goes home, where she finds the key to Mark&#x27;s office. She goes to the office and opens the safe, but finds herself unable to take the money, even after Mark arrives and &quot;urges&quot; her to take it to test her new reluctance to theft.

Mark takes Marnie to Baltimore to confront her mother and uncover the truth about Marnie&#x27;s past. They arrive in a thunderstorm. As it is revealed that Bernice was a prostitute, Marnie&#x27;s long-suppressed memories resurface: when she was a small child, one of Bernice&#x27;s clients tried to calm a frightened Marnie during a thunderstorm. Seeing him touch Marnie and believing he was trying to molest her, Bernice attacked him. As the man fended her off, she fell and injured her leg, leaving her disabled. Marnie, frightened and attempting to protect her mother, fatally struck the man in the head with a fireplace poker. The sight of his blood caused her aversion to the color red, the thunderstorm that night caused her fear of them, and the connection of the deadly night to sex caused her revulsion at physical intimacy. In the aftermath, Bernice told police that she killed the man and prayed Marnie would forget the event. Understanding the reason behind her behavior, Marnie asks for Mark&#x27;s help. They leave holding each other closely.

==Production==
=== Development and writing ===
Alfred Hitchcock began developing the film adaptation of Winston Graham&#x27;s novel &quot;Marnie&quot; in 1961. He commissioned Joseph Stefano, the screenwriter of Hitchcock&#x27;s recently released &quot;Psycho&quot;, to work on the script. Stefano made extensive notes and wrote a 161-page treatment. The director&#x27;s first choice to play the title role, Grace Kelly, by then Princess Grace of Monaco, withdrew from the project when the citizens of Monaco objected to her appearing in a film, especially as a sexually disturbed thief. Also, when Kelly married Prince Rainier in 1956, she had not fulfilled her contract with MGM, which could have prevented her from working for another studio. As a consequence of Kelly&#x27;s departure from the film, Hitchcock put it aside to work on &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963).

After completing &quot;The Birds&quot;, Hitchcock returned to the Winston Graham adaptation. Stefano dropped out of the project due to his commitments to the ABC television series &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. Evan Hunter, who had written the screenplay for &quot;The Birds&quot;, developed &quot;Marnie&quot; with Hitchcock, and wrote several drafts. Hunter was unhappy with the rape scene in the original novel, as he felt the audience would lose sympathy for the male lead. The director, however, was enthusiastic about the scene, describing to Hunter how he intended to film it:

Hitch held up his hands the way directors do when they&#x27;re framing a shot. Palms out, fingers together, thumbs extended and touching to form a perfect square. Moving his hands toward my face, like a camera coming in for a close shot, he said, &quot;Evan, when he sticks it in her, I want that camera right on her &quot;face&quot;&quot;.

Hunter wrote a draft containing the rape scene but also wrote an additional, substitute sequence, which he pleaded with Hitchcock to use instead. Hunter was dismissed from the project on 1 May 1963. His replacement, Jay Presson Allen, later told him that &quot;you just got bothered by the scene that was his reason for making the movie. You just wrote your ticket back to New York&quot;. Just as Hunter had been unaware of Stefano&#x27;s earlier work on &quot;Marnie&quot;, Presson Allen was not informed that she was the third writer to work on the adaptation.

=== Casting ===
According to royal biographer Craig Brown, Hitchcock offered Princess Grace the title role in March 1962, and she accepted; but in Monaco, the reaction to the announcement was categorically negative. As he wrote: &quot;Monegasques did not like the idea of their princess being filmed kissing another man. Little did they know that Hitchcock also had plans for him to rape her&quot;. The film was also being developed during a tense period of France–Monaco relations in which France threatened to revoke Monaco&#x27;s special status, leaving the ruling Grimaldi dynasty anxious to preserve the country&#x27;s public image. Grace&#x27;s announcement that she would donate her $800,000 fee to Monaco charities did nothing to appease the critics, and she dropped out of the project in June 1962.

Following the news of Kelly&#x27;s unavailability, Marilyn Monroe sought the role of Marnie. Asked about this in an interview with &quot;Variety&quot; Army Archerd, Hitchcock replied evasively that it was &quot;an interesting idea&quot;. In his book &quot;Hitchcock and the Making of Marnie&quot;, Tony Lee Moral revealed that a studio executive at Paramount Pictures suggested actress Lee Remick to Hitchcock for the title role. Hitchcock also considered two other actresses who were, like Hedren, under his personal contract, Vera Miles and Claire Griswold, wife of director/actor Sydney Pollack. Eva Marie Saint, star of Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959), and Susan Hampshire unsuccessfully pursued the role as well. In the end, Hitchcock opted to use Tippi Hedren, a one-time model he had seen in a commercial for a diet drink in 1961, then cast successfully in &quot;The Birds&quot;. According to Hedren, he offered her the role of Marnie during filming of &quot;The Birds&quot;. Hedren told writer Moral that she was &quot;amazed&quot; that Hitchcock would offer her this &quot;incredible role&quot;, calling it a &quot;once-in-a-lifetime opportunity&quot;. In 2005, more than 40 years after the film&#x27;s release, Hedren declared in an interview that &quot;Marnie&quot; was her favorite of the two films that she made with Hitchcock, because of the intriguing, complex, challenging character that she played.

Male lead Sean Connery had been worried that being under contract to Eon Productions for both James Bond and non-Bond films would limit his career and turned down every non-Bond film that Eon offered him. When asked what he wanted to do, Connery replied that he wanted to work with Alfred Hitchcock, which Eon arranged through their contacts. Connery also shocked many people at the time by asking to see a script, something that Connery did because he was worried about being typecast as a spy and he did not want to do a variation of &quot;North by Northwest&quot; or &quot;Notorious&quot;, spy-themed movies directed by Hitchcock starring Cary Grant. When told by Hitchcock&#x27;s agent that Grant did not ask to see even one of Hitchcock&#x27;s scripts Connery replied, &quot;I&#x27;m not Cary Grant&quot;. Hitchcock and Connery got on well during filming. Connery also said that he was happy with the film &quot;with certain reservations&quot;.

Hedren has claimed that Hitchcock made sexual overtures to her during the making of &quot;The Birds&quot;, and that while making &quot;Marnie&quot;, he &quot;pressured her sexually all the more blatantly, crudely, and cruelly.&quot; Hedren did not yield to his advances. She asked to be released from her contract, but he refused.

=== Filming ===
In a making-of documentary for the DVD release, unit manager Hilton A. Green explains that shooting had been scheduled to begin on November 25, 1963, at Universal City Studios in California but had to be postponed because the nation was in mourning for John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated three days before. Filming concluded on March 14, 1964.

=== Music ===
Hitchcock had noticed a strong similarity between Herrmann&#x27;s score for &quot;Joy in the Morning&quot; and &quot;Marnie&quot; and believed that Herrmann was repeating himself. Herrmann&#x27;s music for &quot;Marnie&quot; included excerpts in his special album for Decca Records. Lyrics were written to Herrmann&#x27;s theme that were to be sung by Nat King Cole. Herrmann&#x27;s later score for Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;The Bride Wore Black&quot; (1968) also repeats the main theme in Marnie, although slightly altered in its harmony.

== Reception==
Contemporary reviews were mixed. Eugene Archer of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote a lukewarm assessment, calling it &quot;at once a fascinating study of a sexual relationship and the master&#x27;s most disappointing film in years&quot;. Archer&#x27;s main criticisms were &quot;an inexplicably amateurish script&quot; and the casting of &quot;relative newcomers&quot; Hedren and Connery in roles that &quot;cry for the talents of Grace Kelly and Cary Grant&quot;. A review in &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the opening was slow, but once it got going Hitchcock&#x27;s story &quot;generally keeps the action fairly fast-paced—provided audience can overlook certain puzzling aspects, such as why the lady became a thief—and gets strong performances from his two stars and other cast members&quot;. Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;As a story it seems naggingly improbable and, as drama, a nightmare from which the spectator constantly pulls away, struggling to wake up in a less disordered universe. No question, though, that it is at least fitfully effective&quot;. Edith Oliver of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the film &quot;an idiotic and trashy movie with two terrible performances in the leading roles, and I had quite a good time watching it. There is something bracing about Hitchcock at work, even when he is at his worst&quot;. &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that the film &quot;opens quite brilliantly&quot;, but that &quot;things get out of hand&quot; after the marriage, &quot;with both leading players floundering badly as Hitchcock piles up his demands on them&quot;. The review suggested that &quot;the trouble seems to be that the film falls between the two stools of straight suspense (what is Marnie&#x27;s secret?) and the full-dress character study that would only have been possible with a more experienced actress&quot;. The film ranked 3rd on Cahiers du Cinéma&#x27;s Top 10 Films of the Year List in 1964.

&quot;Marnie&quot;″s reputation would greatly improve years later. On Rotten Tomatoes it holds an 80% rating based on 44 reviews. The critical consensus reads: &quot;A coolly constructed mystery revolving around a character who&#x27;s inscrutable to a fault, &quot;Marnie&quot; finds Hitchcock luring audiences deeper into the dark&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;. Dave Kehr wrote in &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; that while the film was &quot;universally despised on its first release, &quot;Marnie&quot; remains one of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s greatest and darkest achievements&quot; as &quot;theme and technique meet on the highest level of film art&quot;. Richard Brody wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that he considered it &quot;Hitchcock&#x27;s best film&quot;. In her 2012 review of the film Emily Cleaver of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote: &quot;The opening shots of &quot;Marnie&quot; are Hitchcock&#x27;s ideal of visual storytelling at its purest, and the rest of the film is an underrated gem&quot;.

The film was a moderate box office success; it grossed $7 million in theatres on a budget of $3 million. In North America, it earned estimated rentals of $3,250,000. &quot;Marnie&quot; was the 22nd highest-grossing film of 1964.

In a making-of documentary on the DVD, Robin Wood, author of &quot;Hitchcock&#x27;s Films Revisited&quot;, discusses the special effects of the film as having their roots in German Expressionism:

[Hitchcock] worked in German studios at first, in the silent period. Very early on when he started making films, he saw Fritz Lang&#x27;s German silent films; he was enormously influenced by that, and &quot;Marnie&quot; is basically an expressionist film in many ways. Things like scarlet suffusions over the screen, back-projection and backdrops, artificial-looking thunderstorms—these are expressionist devices and one has to accept them. If one doesn&#x27;t accept them then one doesn&#x27;t understand and can&#x27;t possibly like Hitchcock.

In the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll of the greatest films ever made, &quot;Marnie&quot; received nine total votes—six (out of 846) from critics and three (out of 358) from directors. &quot;Marnie&quot; was ranked 47th in BBC&#x27;s 2015 list of the 100 greatest American films.

&quot;Marnie&quot; continues to have its admirers. Actress Catherine Deneuve indicated that she would have loved to have played Marnie. Actress Naomi Watts dressed up as Hedren&#x27;s Marnie (whose outfits were by Edith Head) for the March 2008 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine.

&quot;Marnie&quot; has been described as a neo-noir film by some authors.

The background to Hedren&#x27;s casting in the title role and some of the production challenges were explored in the 2012 made-for-television movie &quot;The Girl&quot; starring Sienna Miller as Hedren and Toby Jones as Hitchcock.

<text>Panhellenic Games is the collective term for four separate religious festivals held in ancient Greece that became especially well known for the athletic competitions they included. The four festivals were: the Olympic Games, which were held at Olympia in honor of Zeus; the Pythian Games, which took place in Delphi and honored Apollo; the Nemean Games, occurring at Nemea and also honoring Zeus; and, finally, the Isthmian Games set in Isthmia and held in honor of Poseidon. The places at which these games were held were considered to be &quot;the four great panhellenic sanctuaries.&quot; Each of these Games took place in turn every four years, starting with the Olympics. Along with the fame and notoriety of winning the ancient Games, the athletes earned different crowns of leaves from the different Games. From the Olympics, the victor won an olive wreath, from the Pythian Games a laurel wreath, from the Nemean Games a crown of wild celery leaves, and from the Isthmian Games a crown of pine.

==Description==

The Olympiad, the four year cycle starting with the Olympic Games, was one of the ways the Ancient Greeks measured time. The Games took place over a four-year cycle that began with the Olympic Games in the first year. The Nemean Games were held in year two, the Pythian Games in year three, and the Isthmian Games in year four. They were structured this way so that individual athletes could participate in all of the Games. The dial on the Antikythera mechanism, a mysterious artefact from ancient Greece that appears to have had calendar functions among other uses, was organized to track the Olympiad and suggests that four Games occurred on different years.

Participants could come from all over the Greek world, including the various Greek colonies from Asia Minor to Iberia. Substantial wealth was required to pay for training, transportation, lodging, and other expenses. However, competitors often were funded by their hometowns or private patrons, and many of them traveled together from one competition to another, winning cash awards as they went.

The main events at each of the Games were chariot racing, wrestling, boxing, pankration, &quot;stadion&quot; and various other foot races, and the pentathlon (made up of wrestling, &quot;stadion&quot;, long jump, javelin throw, and discus throw). Except for the chariot race, all the events were performed nude. Since the Olympic Games was the original and the pinnacle of all the games in the circuit, each festival might have had its own events but had to include all the events that took place at the Olympics, according to Young. This gave the athletes the opportunity to compete in the same core events at all the Games in the Panhellenic circuit.

The Games were hugely popular not only for their three-day sporting competitions but also because they brought many spectators from all over, according to classics historian Jason König. This allowed for people to partake in other activities like religious events, speeches, and even musical performances.

The Olympic Games were the oldest of the four, said to have begun in 776 BC. It is more likely though that they were founded sometime in the late 7th century BC. They lasted until the Roman Emperor Theodosius, a Christian, abolished them as heathen in AD 393. The Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian Games most likely began sometime in the first or second quarter of the 6th century BC.

The Olympic Games are also known as the Stephanitic Games (derived from &quot;stephanos,&quot; the Attic Greek word for crown), because winners received only a garland for victory. No financial or material prizes were awarded, unlike at other ancient Greek athletic or artistic contests, such as the Panathenaic Games, at which winners were awarded many amphorae of first-class Athenian olive-oil. Though victors received no material awards at the Games, they were often showered with gifts and honours on returning to their polis.

== The Four Games ==

=== Olympic Games ===

According to Pindar’s Olympian 1, the origin of the Ancient Olympic Games can be traced to Pelops, son of Tantalus. Pelops seeks to win the hand of Hippodameia in marriage. King Oenomaus, Hippodameia’s father, knows of a prophecy that declares his death to be at the hands of his son in law. King Oenomaus decides the only way for him to marry his daughter is to take part in a chariot race that has killed many other suitors. Pelops asks a favor of Poseidon to bestow upon him a chariot fast enough to bring him victory. Poseidon granted him a golden chariot and winged horses. With this chariot, Pelops won the race and was able to marry Hippodameia. It is also claimed that Pelops had Myrtilus sabotage King Oenomaus’ chariot which caused him to lose the race and die during the process. After his victory, Pelops organized a festival to take place at Olympia with chariot races and other Games in tribute to the gods and to honor King Oenomaus.

The Olympic Games took place every four years at the site of Olympia in Greece. It is thought that first recorded Games were in 776 BC but it is possible that they could have been around for many years before this according to scholar David C. Young. The Olympics were the first established Games for approximately 200 years before the remaining Panhellenic Games came into creation. Since the Games take place in Olympia, the festival held and sacrifices/offerings are in honor of Zeus, the winner of the Games receives an olive wreath. This comes from the myth (as told by Pausanias) that Heracles started the Olympic Games and planted an olive tree that became sacred to the Greeks and from which the Olympic victors&#x27; wreaths were cut.

In Pindar&#x27;s version of the Olympics, the chariot race was the first of the events at creation. In Pausanias&#x27; versions, the foot race is the only event until the fourteenth Olympic Festival. Then another race is added that is longer than the original race. Since the Olympic Games was the original and the pinnacle of all the games in the Circuit, each Festival may have its own events but it must include all the events that took place at the Olympics, according to Young. This gives the athletes the opportunity to compete in the event at all the Games in the Panhellenic circuit.

==== Origin Myths ====
Another origin story from Pausanias was that Heracles challenged his younger brothers to a foot race. The winner of the race would receive an olive branch as a reward since they were in such high supply. Pausanias attributes another origin myth to Zeus. It is thought he started the Olympic Games in honor of his victory defeating his father, Cronus.

=== Pythian Games ===

The Pythian Games were established in 582 BC in Delphi to honor the god Apollo. Originally, these games occurred every eight years and there was just one contest—the singing of a hymn to Apollo, accompanied on the cithara. The Pythian Games were the second most important of the Panhellenic Games and took place in late August of the third year of every Olympiad. However, there is some debate about the start of the Pythian Festival amongst historians. Some historians believe Pausanias who dates the first Pythian festival to 586 BC. This argument is because there are few references to the date in Pindar’s poems whereas Pausanias more clearly articulates numbered festivals. These Games include a mix of athletic events that took place at the previous Olympic Games, and musical events. The prize to the winner of the Pythian Games is a laurel wreath (also known as bay laurel, Laurus nobilis).

In Pausanias&#x27; &quot;Description of Greece&quot;, he lists Cleisthenes of Sicyon as the winner of the first Pythian Games chariot race. Cleisthenes is also credited with the creation of the Pythian Games. He sought after a suitor for to wed his daughter, Agariste. He organized a competition for those who thought of themselves as worthy to compete in athletic competitions. These competitions evolved into the Pythian Festival.

=== Nemean Games ===
The Nemean Games were established at the sanctuary of Zeus in Nemea in 573 BC. These Games are held every other year, every second and fourth year, in the same years that the Isthmian Games are held, though at different times during the years. The Nemean Games were held in July, whereas the Isthmian were held in April or May. 

The Nemean Games have two origination stories. Pausanias tells of the most recognized myth that the Games were originally funeral Games to honor the death of baby Opheltes, the infant son of Lykourgos and Eurydike. Lykourgos was told of a prophecy that his son could not touch the ground until he walked. Lykourgos appointed a slave to take care of his son and prevent him from being set down. One day the Seven Against Thebes came across the slave and baby Opheltes and asked for a drink. The slave set the babe on the ground amongst wild celery to assist the Seven. Opheltes was attacked by a snake and killed, thus fulfilling the prophecy. The Nemean Games were held in his honor with the prize to the victor being a wreath of wild celery.

The second origination is that of Heracles first of ten labors by King Eurystheus. He was tasked with bringing back the skin of the lion that stalked the hills of Nemea. Heracles came to a village, Cleonae where he met Molorchus. Molorchus agreed to make a sacrifice to Heracles if he did not return after 30 days, and Zeus if he did. Heracles found the lion and followed him to his cave. He blocked on entrances then went in after the lion and attacked. Heracles returned to Molorchus&#x27; home on the 30th day and they made a sacrifice to Zeus. The Games are said to be in honor of both Zeus and Heracles each year.

=== Isthmian Games ===
The Isthmian Games started near Corinth in 582 B.C., the same year as the Pythian Games began in Delphi. They are held every second and fourth year, just like the Nemean Games, but in the spring (April or May). The winner of the Isthmian Games originally received a pine crown, but in the Classical era dry celery was substituted.

Pausanias attributes the origin of the Games to King Sisyphus of Corinth. Sisyphus held the Games at a funeral in honor of Melikertes (later changed to Palaimon), a boy who drowned in the gulf. According to Pausanias, Palaimon was killed because Hera found out his parents were raising baby Dionysus which brought down her wrath.

Plutarch and Apollodorus credit the origin of the Isthmian Games with Theseus. Theseus was travelling to Athens when he heard of Sinis. Sinis was a conqueror and a thief. He would kill his victims by tying them to the top of fir trees that he pulled down, then letting them spring back which caused the victim to launched into the air and fall back down to the ground. Theseus killed Sinis in the same manner. He then held the funerary Games in honor of the deceased. Plutarch also credits Theseus with holding the Games in honor of Poseidon, since they were typically held in his sanctuary in Corinth.

== Athletes ==
According to archaeologist, H.W. Pleket, in the early days of the Olympic Games, before the formation of local or the remaining &quot;Big Four&quot; festivals, the athletes mostly came from the wealthy class of Greek male athletes. This is because the cost training and traveling would be too great for those of low birth to participate. Pleket and historian David Stone Potter describe a view from Alcibiades saying how he would rather breed horses for racing than take part in the gymnastic events because it was &quot;not to be pursued by one of low estate.&quot; However, as the games progressed, less wealthy athletes were able to eventually take part in the Festival by being sponsored by their home towns or wealthy backers. Many of the less wealthy had to work their way up through the local festivals in order to prove themselves.

Young describes how the men were divided into different class groups for the Games however, the division was different at different festivals. These groups consisted of boys, youths and men but sometimes may just be broken into men and boys. Edward Norman Gardiner makes the point that physical fitness and athletics is incredibly important in the Ancient Greek world because every male is required to take part in the Greek military. Because of the environment of warfare, physical fitness was essential to men&#x27;s life.

While the majority of those that participated in the Games is overwhelmingly free Greek men, there is evidence that there were female athletes as well that participated in the Panhellenic Games, often as chariot race horse owners. Historian, Georgia Tsouvala, gives three examples of inscriptions from lesser polis festivals that provide evidence of female athletes that were members of the gymnasia. Tsouvala also points out, while it&#x27;s not common for women to have been able to partake in any form of physical education in ancient Greece, there are some states where it&#x27;s encouraged like Sparta. In many ancient Greek works from Vergil, to Plutarch, to Ovid, there are reverences made to Spartan women taking part in traditionally male activities like boar hunting, pancration, and discus throwing to name a few.

Tsouvala points out that other than as chariot horse owners, it was likely that girls and women would take part in footraces in the festivals in honor of Artemis and Iphigeneia. There was also evidence discovered in Naples that held inscriptions detailing young women who participated in the &quot;stadion&quot; and &quot;dolichos&quot; foot races.

The male athletes that participated in the Panhellenic Games did so nude. This was common and not viewed as something shameful or indecent because Ancient Greeks did not have the same views on nudity as is common in Western Judeo-Christian views, according to David Young. Young also points out the etymology of the word &quot;gymnasium&quot; which breaks down to its core word &quot;gymnos&quot; which means naked, so literally &quot;to train naked.&quot; While Young points out that men believed there was nothing indecent about the nude form, women were not allowed to be nude because it led to promiscuity. However, in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Lycurgus,&quot; its discussed how Spartan women were encouraged to participate in all the activities they normally would naked except for some festivals that where singing and dancing with men was permitted.

<text>Sunderland () is a port city in Tyne and Wear, England. It is a port at the mouth of the River Wear on the North Sea, approximately south-east of Newcastle upon Tyne. The built-up area had a population of 168,277 at the 2021 census, making it the second largest settlement in North East England after Newcastle. It is the administrative centre of the metropolitan borough of the same name.

Sunderland was once known as &#x27;the largest shipbuilding town in the world&#x27; and once made a quarter of all of the world&#x27;s ships from its famous yards, which date back to 1346 on the River Wear.

The centre of the modern city is an amalgamation of three settlements founded in the Anglo-Saxon era: Monkwearmouth, on the north bank of the Wear, and Sunderland and Bishopwearmouth on the south bank. Monkwearmouth contains St Peter&#x27;s Church, which was founded in 674 and formed part of Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey, a significant centre of learning in the seventh and eighth centuries. Sunderland was a fishing settlement and later a port, being granted a town charter in 1179. The city traded in coal and salt, also developing shipbuilding industry in the fourteenth century and glassmaking industry in the seventeenth century. Following the decline of its traditional industries in the late 20th century, the area became an automotive building centre. In 1992, the borough of Sunderland was granted city status. Sunderland is historically part of County Durham, being incorporated to the ceremonial county of Tyne and Wear in 1974.

Locals are sometimes known as Mackems, a term which came into common use in the 1970s. Its use and acceptance by residents, particularly among the older generations, is not universal. The term is also applied to the Sunderland dialect, which shares similarities with the other North East England dialects.

==Toponymy==
In , King Ecgfrith granted Benedict Biscop a &quot;sunder-land&quot;. In 685 The Venerable Bede moved to the newly founded Jarrow monastery. He had started his monastic career at Monkwearmouth monastery and later wrote that he was &quot;ácenned on &quot;sundorlande&quot; þæs ylcan mynstres&quot; (born in a &quot;separate land&quot; of this same monastery). This can be taken as &quot;sundorlande&quot; (being Old English for &quot;separate land&quot;) or the settlement of Sunderland. The name may also be descriptive of the original settlement&#x27;s location, being almost cut off (sundered) from the rest of the mainland by creeks and gullies from both the sea and the River Wear.

==History==
===Early, ancient and Medieval===

The earliest inhabitants of the Sunderland area were Stone Age hunter-gatherers and artifacts from this era have been discovered, including microliths found during excavations at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Monkwearmouth. During the final phase of the Stone Age, the Neolithic period ( BC), Hastings Hill, on the western outskirts of Sunderland, was a focal point of activity and a place of burial and ritual significance. Evidence includes the former presence of a cursus monument.

It is believed the Brythonic-speaking Brigantes inhabited the area around the River Wear in pre-Roman Britain. There is a long-standing local legend that there was a Roman settlement on the south bank of the River Wear on what is the site of the former Vaux Brewery, although no archaeological investigation has taken place.

Roman artefacts have been recovered in the River Wear at North Hylton, including four stone anchors, which may support the theory that there was a Roman dam or port on the River Wear.
Recorded settlements at the mouth of the Wear date to , when an Anglo-Saxon nobleman, Benedict Biscop, was granted land by King Ecgfrith, founded the Wearmouth–Jarrow (&quot;St Peter&#x27;s&quot;) monastery on the north bank of the river—an area that became known as Monkwearmouth. Biscop&#x27;s monastery was the first built of stone in Northumbria. He employed glaziers from France and in doing he re-established glass making in Britain. In 686 the community was taken over by Ceolfrid, and Wearmouth–Jarrow became a major centre of learning and knowledge in Anglo-Saxon England with a library of around 300 volumes.

The Codex Amiatinus, described by biblical scholar Henry Julian White (1859–1934) as the &#x27;finest book in the world&#x27;, was created at the monastery and was likely worked on by Bede, who was born at Wearmouth in 673. This is one of the oldest monasteries still standing in England. While at the monastery, Bede completed the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; &quot;(The Ecclesiastical History of the English People)&quot; in 731, a feat which earned him the title &quot;The father of English history&quot;.

In the late 8th century the Vikings raided the coast, and by the middle of the 9th century the monastery had been abandoned. Lands on the south side of the river were granted to the Bishop of Durham by Athelstan of England in 930; these became known as Bishopwearmouth and included settlements such as Ryhope which fall within the modern boundary of Sunderland.

In 1100, Bishopwearmouth parish included a fishing village at the southern mouth of the river (now the East End) known as &#x27;Soender-land&#x27; (which evolved into &#x27;Sunderland&#x27;). This settlement was granted a charter in 1179 under the name of the borough of Wearmouth by Hugh Pudsey, then the Bishop of Durham (who had quasi-monarchical power within the County Palatine of Durham). The charter gave its merchants the same rights as those of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, but it nevertheless took time for Sunderland to develop as a port. Fishing was the main commercial activity at the time: mainly herring in the 13th century, then salmon in the 14th and 15th centuries. From 1346 ships were being built at Wearmouth, by a merchant named Thomas Menville, and by 1396 a small amount of coal was being exported.

===Jamies and Black Cats===
Rapid growth of the port was prompted by the salt trade. Salt exports from Sunderland are recorded from as early as the 13th century, by 1589 salt pans were laid at Bishopwearmouth Panns (the modern-day name of the area the pans occupied is Pann&#x27;s Bank, on the river bank between the city centre and the East End). Large vats of seawater were heated using coal; as the water evaporated, the salt remained. As coal was required to heat the salt pans, a coal mining community began to emerge. Only poor-quality coal was used in salt panning; better-quality coal was traded via the port, which subsequently began to grow.

Both salt and coal continued to be exported through the 17th century, with the coal trade growing significantly (2–3,000 tons of coal were exported from Sunderland in the year 1600; by 1680 this had increased to 180,000 tons). Difficulty for colliers trying to navigate the Wear’s shallow waters meant coal mined further inland was loaded onto keels (large, flat-bottomed boats) and taken downriver to the waiting colliers. A close-knit group of workers manned the Keels as &#x27;keelmen&#x27;. In 1634 a market and yearly fair charter was granted by Bishop Thomas Morton. Morton&#x27;s charter acknowledged that the borough had been called Wearmouth until then, but it incorporated the place under the name of Sunderland, by which it had become more generally known.

Before the civil war and with the exception of Kingston upon Hull, the North declared for the King. In 1644 the North was captured by the Roundheads (Parliamentarians), the area itself taken in March of that year. One artefact of the civil war in the area was the long trench; a tactic of later warfare. In the village of Offerton roughly three miles inland from the present city centre, skirmishes occurred. The Roundheads blockaded the River Tyne, crippling the Newcastle coal trade, which allowed a short period of flourishing coal trade on the Wear.

In 1669, after the Restoration, King Charles II granted letters patent to one Edward Andrew, Esq. to &#x27;build a pier and erect a lighthouse or lighthouses and cleanse the harbour of Sunderland&#x27;. There was a tonnage duty levy on shipping in order to raise the necessary funds. There was a growing number of shipbuilders or boatbuilders active on the River Wear in the late 17th century.

By the start of the 18th century the banks of the Wear were described as being studded with small shipyards, as far as the tide flowed. After 1717, measures having been taken to increase the depth of the river, Sunderland&#x27;s shipbuilding trade grew substantially (in parallel with its coal exports). A number of warships were built, alongside many commercial sailing ships. By the middle of the century the town was probably the premier shipbuilding centre in Britain. Ships built in Sunderland were known as &#x27;Jamies&#x27;. By 1788 Sunderland was Britain&#x27;s fourth largest port (by measure of tonnage) after London, Newcastle and Liverpool; among these it was the leading coal exporter (though it did not rival Newcastle in terms of home coal trade). Still further growth was driven across the region, towards the end of the century, by London&#x27;s insatiable demand for coal during the French Revolutionary Wars.
Until 1719 the borough of Sunderland formed part of the wider parish of Bishopwearmouth. Following the completion of Holy Trinity Church, Sunderland (today also known as Sunderland Old Parish Church) in 1719, the borough was made a separate parish called Sunderland. Later, in 1769, St John&#x27;s Church was built as a chapel of ease within Holy Trinity parish; built by a local coal fitter, John Thornhill, it stood in Prospect Row to the north-east of the parish church. (St John&#x27;s was demolished in 1972.) By 1720 the port area was completely built up, with large houses and gardens facing the Town Moor and the sea, and labourers&#x27; dwellings vying with manufactories alongside the river. The three original settlements Bishopwearmouth, Monkwearmouth and Sunderland had started to combine, driven by the success of the port of Sunderland, salt panning and shipbuilding along the banks of the river. Around this time, Sunderland was known as &#x27;Sunderland-near-the-Sea&#x27;.

Sunderland&#x27;s third-biggest export, after coal and salt, was glass. The town&#x27;s first modern glassworks were established in the 1690s and the industry grew through the 17th century. Its flourishing was aided by trading ships bringing good-quality sand (as ballast) from the Baltic and elsewhere which, together with locally available limestone (and coal to fire the furnaces) was a key ingredient in the glassmaking process. Other industries that developed alongside the river included lime burning and pottery making (the town&#x27;s first commercial pottery manufactory, the Garrison Pottery, had opened in old Sunderland in 1750).
By 1770 Sunderland had spread westwards along its High Street to join up with Bishopwearmouth. In 1796 Bishopwearmouth in turn gained a physical link with Monkwearmouth following the construction of a bridge, the Wearmouth Bridge, which was the world&#x27;s second iron bridge (after the famous span at Ironbridge). It was built at the instigation of Rowland Burdon, the Member of Parliament (MP) for County Durham, and described by Nikolaus Pevsner as being &#x27;a triumph of the new metallurgy and engineering ingenuity [...] of superb elegance&#x27;. Spanning the river in a single sweep of , it was over twice the length of the earlier bridge at Ironbridge but only three-quarters the weight. At the time of building, it was the biggest single-span bridge in the world; and because Sunderland had developed on a plateau above the river, it never suffered from the problem of interrupting the passage of high-masted vessels.

During the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear a pair of gun batteries were built (in 1742 and 1745) on the shoreline to the south of the South Pier, to defend the river from attack (a further battery was built on the cliff top in Roker, ten years later). One of the pair was washed away by the sea in 1780, but the other was expanded during the French Revolutionary Wars and became known as the Black Cat Battery. In 1794 Sunderland Barracks were built, behind the battery, close to what was then the tip of the headland.

The world&#x27;s first steam dredger was built in Sunderland in 1796-7 and put to work on the river the following year. Designed by Stout&#x27;s successor as Engineer, Jonathan Pickernell jr (in post from 1795 to 1804), it consisted of a set of &#x27;bag and spoon&#x27; dredgers driven by a tailor-made 4-horsepower Boulton &amp; Watt beam engine. It was designed to dredge to a maximum depth of below the waterline and remained in operation until 1804, when its constituent parts were sold as separate lots. Onshore, numerous small industries supported the business of the burgeoning port. In 1797 the world&#x27;s first patent ropery (producing machine-made rope, rather than using a ropewalk) was built in Sunderland, using a steam-powered hemp-spinning machine which had been devised by a local schoolmaster, Richard Fothergill, in 1793; the ropery building still stands, in the Deptford area of the city.

===&quot;The greatest shipbuilding port in the world&quot;===
Sunderland&#x27;s shipbuilding industry continued to grow through most of the 19th century, becoming the town&#x27;s dominant industry and a defining part of its identity. By 1815 it was &#x27;the leading shipbuilding port for wooden trading vessels&#x27; with 600 ships constructed that year across 31 different yards. By 1840 the town had 76 shipyards and between 1820 and 1850 the number of ships being built on the Wear increased fivefold. From 1846 to 1854 almost a third of the UK&#x27;s ships were built in Sunderland, and in 1850 the &quot;Sunderland Herald&quot; proclaimed the town to be the greatest shipbuilding port in the world.

The Durham &amp; Sunderland Railway Co. built a railway line across the Town Moor and established a passenger terminus there in 1836. In 1847 the line was bought by George Hudson&#x27;s York and Newcastle Railway. Hudson, nicknamed &#x27;The Railway King&#x27;, was Member of Parliament for Sunderland and was already involved in a scheme to build a dock in the area. In 1846 he had formed the Sunderland Dock Company, which received parliamentary approval for the construction of a dock between the South Pier and Hendon Bay.

Increasing industrialisation had prompted residential expansion away from the old port area in the suburban terraces of the Fawcett Estate and Mowbray Park. The area around Fawcett Street itself increasingly functioned as the civic and commercial town centre.

Marine engineering works were established from the 1820s onwards, initially providing engines for paddle steamers; in 1845 a ship named &quot;Experiment&quot; was the first of many to be converted to steam screw propulsion. Demand for steam-powered vessels increased during the Crimean War; nonetheless, sailing ships continued to be built, including fast fully-rigged composite-built clippers, including the &quot;City of Adelaide&quot; in 1864 and &quot;Torrens&quot; (the last such vessel ever built), in 1875.

By the middle of the century glassmaking was at its height on Wearside. James Hartley &amp; Co., established in Sunderland in 1836, grew to be the largest glassworks in the country and (having patented an innovative production technique for rolled plate glass) produced much of the glass used in the construction of the Crystal Palace in 1851. A third of all UK-manufactured plate glass was produced at Hartley&#x27;s by this time. Other manufacturers included the Cornhill Flint Glassworks (established at Southwick in 1865), which went on to specialise in pressed glass, as did the Wear Flint Glassworks (which had originally been established in 1697). In addition to the plate glass and pressed glass manufacturers there were 16 bottle works on the Wear in the 1850s, with the capacity to produce between 60 and 70,000 bottles a day.

In 1848 George Hudson&#x27;s York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway built a passenger terminus, Monkwearmouth Station, just north of Wearmouth Bridge; and south of the river another passenger terminus, in Fawcett Street, in 1853. Later, Thomas Elliot Harrison (chief engineer to the North Eastern Railway) made plans to carry the railway across the river; the Wearmouth Railway Bridge (reputedly &#x27;the largest Hog-Back iron girder bridge in the world&#x27;) opened in 1879.

In 1854 the Londonderry, Seaham &amp; Sunderland Railway opened linking collieries to a separate set of staiths at Hudson Dock South, it also provided a passenger service from Sunderland to Seaham Harbour.

In 1886–90 Sunderland Town Hall was built in Fawcett Street, just to the east of the railway station, to a design by Brightwen Binyon. By 1889 two million tons of coal per year was passing through Hudson Dock, while to the south of Hendon Dock, the Wear Fuel Works distilled coal tar to produce pitch, oil and other products.
The 20th century saw Sunderland A.F.C. established as the Wearside area&#x27;s greatest claim to sporting fame. Founded in 1879 as Sunderland and District Teachers A.F.C. by schoolmaster James Allan, Sunderland joined The Football League for the 1890–91 season.

===20th Century===

From 1900 to 1919, an electric tram system was built and was gradually replaced by buses during the 1940s before being ended in 1954. In 1909 the Queen Alexandra Bridge was built, linking Deptford and Southwick.

The First World War increased shipbuilding, leading to the town being a target in a 1916 Zeppelin raid. Monkwearmouth was struck on 1 April 1916 and 22 people died. Over 25,000 men from a population of 151,000 served in the armed forces during the war.

Through the Great Depression of the 1930s, shipbuilding dramatically declined: shipyards on the Wear went from 15 in 1921 to six in 1937. The small yards of J. Blumer &amp; Son (at North Dock) and the Sunderland Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. (at Hudson Dock) both closed in the 1920s, and other yards were closed down by National Shipbuilders Securities in the 1930s.

By 1936 Sunderland AFC had been league champions on six occasions. They won their first FA Cup in 1937.
With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Sunderland was a key target of the German Luftwaffe bombing. Luftwaffe raids resulted in the deaths of 267 people and destruction of local industry while 4,000 homes were also damaged or destroyed.

Many old buildings remain despite the bombing that occurred during World War II. Religious buildings include Holy Trinity Church, built in 1719 for an independent Sunderland, St Michael&#x27;s Church, built as Bishopwearmouth Parish Church and now known as Sunderland Minster and St Peter&#x27;s Church, Monkwearmouth, part of which dates from 674AD, and was the original monastery. St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Roker, known as the &quot;Cathedral of the Arts and Crafts Movement&quot;, contains work by William Morris, Ernest Gimson and Eric Gill. St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church is the earliest surviving Gothic revival church in the city. After the war, more housing was built and the town&#x27;s boundaries expanded in 1967 when neighbouring Ryhope, Silksworth, Herrington, South Hylton and Castletown were incorporated. Sunderland AFC won their only post-World War II major honour in 1973 when they won a second FA Cup.

Shipbuilding ended in 1988 and coal-mining in 1993 after a mid-1980s unemployment crisis with 20 per cent of the local workforce unemployed.

Electronic, chemical, paper and motor manufacturing as well as the service sector expanded during the 1980s and 1990s to fill unemployment from heavy industry. In 1986 Japanese car manufacturer Nissan opened its Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK factory in Washington, which has since become the UK&#x27;s largest car factory.

===City status ===
Sunderland received city status in 1992. Like many cities, Sunderland comprises a number of areas with their own distinct histories, Fulwell, Monkwearmouth, Roker, and Southwick on the northern side of the Wear, and Bishopwearmouth and Hendon to the south. From 1990, the Wear’s riverbanks were regenerated with new housing, retail parks and business centres on former shipbuilding sites; the National Glass Centre a new University of Sunderland campus on the St Peter&#x27;s site were also built. The former Vaux Breweries site on the north west fringe of the city centre was cleared for further development opportunities.

After 99 years at the historic Roker Park stadium, the city’s football club, Sunderland AFC moved to the 42,000-seat Stadium of Light on the banks of the River Wear in 1997. At the time, it was the largest stadium built by an English football club since the 1920s, and has since been expanded to hold nearly 50,000 seated spectators.

On 24 March 2004, the city adopted Benedict Biscop as its patron saint. In 2018 the city was ranked as the best to live and work in the UK by the finance firm OneFamily. In the same year, the city was ranked as one of the top 10 safest in the UK.

==Governance==

There is one main tier of local government covering Sunderland, at metropolitan borough level: Sunderland City Council. Most of the built-up area is an unparished area, although on its southern edge part of the built-up area falls within the parish of Burdon. The city council is based at City Hall on Plater Way (formerly the site of the Vaux Brewery), which opened in 2021. Prior to that the council was based at the Civic Centre on Burdon Road, which had been built in 1970.

Sunderland has the motto of &quot;Nil Desperandum Auspice Deo&quot; or &quot;Under God&#x27;s guidance we may never despair&quot;. The borough&#x27;s population (at the 2021 Census) was 274,200.

===Administrative history===
The original settlement of Sunderland was historically part of the ancient parish of Bishopwearmouth in County Durham. It was an ancient borough, having been granted a charter in 1179 under the name of &#x27;Wearmouth&#x27;. The original borough covered a relatively small area in the north-east corner of the old Bishopwearmouth parish, lying on the south side of the mouth of the River Wear. The borough was granted a further charter in 1634 which gave it the right to appoint a mayor and incorporated the town under the name of Sunderland rather than Wearmouth. The area of the borough was made a separate parish from Bishopwearmouth by an act of parliament in 1719.

The ancient borough&#x27;s powers were relatively modest. Unlike most such boroughs, it did not hold its own courts, nor did it have any meaningful municipal functions. A separate body of improvement commissioners was established in 1810 with responsibilities to pave, light and clean the streets, provide a watch, and improve the market. In 1832 a parliamentary borough (constitutency) of Sunderland was created, covering the parishes or townships of Sunderland, Bishopwearmouth, Bishopwearmouth Panns, Monkwearmouth, Monkwearmouth Shore and Southwick.

In 1836 Sunderland was reformed to become a municipal borough under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. The municipal boundaries were enlarged at the same time to match the constituency, although later that year the municipal boundaries were reduced to remove Southwick and the parts of Bishopwearmouth and Bishopwearmouth Panns which fell more than one mile from the centre of Wearmouth Bridge. The improvement commissioners were wound up in 1851 and their functions transferred to the council.

When elected county councils were established in 1889, Sunderland was considered large enough to provide its own county-level services, and so it was made a county borough, independent from the new Durham County Council. The borough boundaries were enlarged on several occasions, notably in 1867, 1928 (when it gained areas including Fulwell, Southwick and the remainder of the old Bishopwearmouth parish), 1936, 1951, and 1967 (when it gained North Hylton, South Hylton, Ryhope, Silksworth, and Tunstall).

In 1974 the county borough was replaced by a larger metropolitan borough within the new county of Tyne and Wear. The borough gained Hetton-le-Hole, Houghton-le-Spring, Washington, Burdon, and Warden Law.

From 1974 until 1986 the borough council was a lower-tier district authority, with Tyne and Wear County Council providing county-level services. The county council was abolished in 1986, with the borough council taking on county-level functions. Some functions are provided across Tyne and Wear by joint committees with the other districts. The county of Tyne and Wear continues to exist as a ceremonial county for the purposes of lieutenancy, but has had no administrative functions since 1986. The borough of Sunderland was awarded city status in 1992.

Sunderland became part of the North East Mayoral Combined Authority in May 2024.

=== Voting ===
For decades, Sunderland has been an electoral stronghold of the Labour Party. Sunderland is represented in the House of Commons in the Parliament of the United Kingdom by three Labour Members of Parliament; Bridget Phillipson since 2020, Lewis Atkinson since 2024 and Sharon Hodgson since 2005.
Sunderland voted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum on European Union membership by 61% of the vote; an unexpectedly high margin. The &quot;New Statesman&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; have described Sunderland as the poster city for Brexit.

==Geography==

Much of the city is located on a low range of hills running parallel to the coast. On average, it is around 80 metres above sea level. Sunderland is divided by the River Wear which passes through the middle of the city in a deeply incised valley, part of which is known as the Hylton gorge. Several smaller bodies of water, such as Hendon Burn and the Barnes Burn, run through the suburbs. The three road bridges connecting the north and south portions of the city are the Queen Alexandra Bridge at Pallion, the Wearmouth Bridge just to the north of the city centre and most recently the Northern Spire Bridge between Castletown and Pallion. To the west of the city, the Hylton Viaduct carries the A19 dual-carriageway over the Wear (see map below).

The city has a number of public parks. Several of these are historic, including Mowbray Park, Roker Park and Barnes Park. In the early 2000s, Herrington Country Park was opened opposite Penshaw Monument. The city&#x27;s parks have secured several awards for its commitment to preserving natural facilities, receiving the Britain in Bloom collective in 1993, 1997 and 2000.

Approximately 70% of the population of the built-up area lives on the south side of the river and 30% on the north side. The built-up area extends to the seafront at Hendon and Ryhope in the south and Seaburn in the north.

===Green belt===

The built-up area is surrounded by the Tyne and Wear Green Belt, with its portion in much of its surrounding rural area of the borough. It is a part of the local development plan, of which its stated aims are as follows:

In the Sunderland borough boundary, as well as the aforementioned areas, landscape features and facilities such as much of the River Don and Wear basins, the George Washington Hotel Golf and Spa complex, Sharpley Golf Course, Herrington Country Park, Houghton Quarry and Penshaw Hill are within the green belt area.

===Climate===
Sunderland has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;). Its location in the rain shadow of the Pennines, as well as other mountain ranges to the west, such as those of the Lake District and southwestern Scotland, make Sunderland one of the least rainy cities of Northern England. The climate is heavily moderated by the adjacent North Sea, giving it cool summers, and winters that are mild considering its latitude. The closest weather station is in Tynemouth, about north of Sunderland. As a result, Sunderland&#x27;s coastline is likely slightly milder given the more southerly position. Another relatively nearby weather station in Durham has warmer summer days and colder winter nights courtesy of its inland position.

==Demography==
=== 2021 census ===
At the 2021 census, the built-up area of Sunderland had a population of 168,315, and the wider borough had a population of 274,200. The 2011 census had defined a much larger Sunderland built-up area covering all the built-up areas in the borough and some areas beyond it, notably including Chester-le-Street.

The table below compares Sunderland&#x27;s ethnic make up to the North East England region.

The majority of the BAME population live in Sunderland East – more specifically Hendon and Millfield where there is a larger population of Bangladeshi/Bangladeshi British and Indian/Indian British than elsewhere. There is also a significant Chinese population in these areas. Sunderland West has a population of Indian, Pakistani and other Asian ethnicities. Sunderland North has a substantial Chinese population, notably in St.Peter’s. This is believed to be influenced by the student
population in which:
* 147 nationalities are represented
* 51.27% students are White, 13.92% Asian, 12.78% Asian Other and 5.12% Black African, with other ethnicities in much smaller numbers

While BAME populations are more concentrated in some areas within Sunderland, ethnic diversity is too low in the city to determine if any groups are particularly segregated.

===Religion===
The 2011 census recorded that 70.2% of the population identified as Christian, 1.32% as Muslim, 0.29% as Sikh, 0.22% as Hindu, 0.19% as Buddhist, 0.02% as Jewish, and 21.90% as having no religion.

The Stake Center for the Sunderland Stake of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is in Sunderland.

Jewish heritage in the city, once part of a thriving community, can be dated back to around 1750, when a number of Jewish merchants from across the UK and Europe settled in Sunderland, eventually forming a congregation in 1768. A rabbi from Holland was established in the city in 1790. After a rapid growth in numbers during the latter half of the nineteenth century, the Jewish community in Sunderland reached its height in the mid 1930s, when around 2,000 Jews were recorded to be living in the town. The community has been in slow decline since the mid-20th century. Many Sunderland Jews left for stronger Jewish communities in Britain, including Gateshead, or to Israel. The Jewish primary school, the Menorah School, closed in July 1983, and the yeshiva moved to Gateshead in June 1988. The synagogue on Ryhope Road, opened in 1928, closed at the end of March 2006. (See also History of the Jews in North East England.) The Jewish population of the Sunderland Metropolitan Borough is continually diminishing, as the Jewish population fell from 114 people in 2001, to 87 people in 2021.

In 1998, following the grant of city status to Sunderland, the erstwhile parish church of Bishopwearmouth (St Michael&#x27;s) was redesignated as Sunderland Minster with a city-wide role. It was believed to have been the first creation of a minster church in England since the Reformation.

====Pentecostalism====
The Reverend Alexander Boddy (1854–1930) was appointed vicar of All Saints&#x27; Church, Monkwearmouth in 1884. During his ministry at Monkwearmouth, Boddy was influenced by the 1904–1905 Welsh revival and also by the British-born Norwegian preacher Thomas Ball Barratt. In the early years of the 20th century All Saints, Monkwearmouth became an important centre for the development of the Pentecostal Movement in Britain.

==Economy==

Following the industrial decline of the 1970s to early 1980s and collapse of the local shipbuilding industry, Sunderland&#x27;s mid-1980s economic situation began to improve. Japanese car manufacturer Nissan opened the Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK factory in 1986, and the first Nissan Bluebird car was produced later that year. The factory and its supplier companies remain the largest employers in the region, with current cars produced there including the Nissan Qashqai, the Nissan Juke and the electric Nissan LEAF. As of 2012 over 500,000 cars are produced annually, and it is the UK&#x27;s largest car factory.

Also in the late 1980s, new service industries moved into sites such as the Doxford International Business Park in the south west of the city, attracting national and international companies. Sunderland was named in the shortlist of the top seven &quot;intelligent cities&quot; in the world for the use of information technology, in 2004 and 2005.

===Regeneration===
Since the mid-1980s Sunderland has undergone massive regeneration, particularly around the City Centre and the river corridor.

In 2000, the Bridges shopping centre was extended towards Crowtree Road and the former Central Bus Station, attracting national chain stores. This was followed by adjacent redevelopments on Park Lane.

The former shipyards along the Wear were transformed with a mixture of residential, commercial and leisure facilities including St Peter&#x27;s Campus of the University of Sunderland, University accommodation along the Fish Quay on the South side of the river, the North Haven housing and marina development, the National Glass Centre, the Stadium of Light and Hylton Riverside Retail Park. Also in 2007, the Echo 24 luxury apartments opened on Pann&#x27;s Bank overlooking the river. 

Sunderland Corporation&#x27;s massive post-war housing estate developments at Farringdon, Pennywell and Grindon have all passed into the ownership of Gentoo Group (previously &#x27;Sunderland Housing Group&#x27;), a private company and a Registered Social Landlord.

The Port of Sunderland, owned by the city council, has been allocated for medium-term redevelopment with a focus on mixed-use industry.

Sunderland City Council&#x27;s Unitary Development Plan (UDP) outlines a number of sites around the city for regeneration. The plans are supported by Sunderland Arc, an urban regeneration company funded by the City council, One NorthEast (defunct) and the Homes and Communities Agency.

; Sunniside

In 2004, redevelopment work began in the Sunniside area in the east-end of the city centre, including a multiplex cinema, a multi-storey car park, restaurants, a casino and tenpin bowling. Originally the River Quarter, the site was renamed Limelight in 2005, and renamed in 2008, when it became Sunniside Leisure. Sunniside Gardens were landscaped, and a number of new cafes, bars and restaurants were opened. Up-market residential apartments were developed, including the Echo 24 building.

;Vaux development and Keel Square

Following the closure of the Vaux brewery in 1999, a brownfield site lay dormant in the centre of Sunderland. The land was subject to dispute between supermarket chain Tesco, who bought the site in 2001, and Sunderland arc, who submitted plans for its redevelopment in 2002. During formal negotiations, Tesco stated they would be willing to sell the land to arc, if an alternative city centre site could be found. Possibilities include Holmeside Triangle, and the Sunderland Retail Park in Roker. Arc originally hoped to begin development in 2010. Arc&#x27;s plans for the site were approved by the Secretary of State in 2007, and included extensive office space, hotels, leisure and retail units, residential apartments and a new £50 m Crown and Magistrates&#x27; court, along with a central public arcade located under an expansive glass canopy. It was hoped an &quot;evening economy&quot; could be encouraged, to complement the city&#x27;s nightlife. In 2013 in the area opposite the Vaux site, Sunderland City Council announced the Keel Square project, a new public space designed to commemorate Sunderand&#x27;s maritime heritage, which was completed in May 2015. Construction commenced in 2014.

;Stadium Village

Sunderland A.F.C. has been a major symbol of the area and a contributor to the local economy since the late 19th century. The club was one of the most successful and best supported clubs in the English game during this era, with its home at Roker Park holding more than 70,000 spectators at its peak. However, the FA Cup triumph of 1973 would prove to be the club&#x27;s only postwar major trophy to date, and after its relegation in 1958 the club frequently bounced between the top two divisions of English football, and in 1987 and again in 2018 suffered relegation to the third tier of English football. The club played at Roker Park for 99 years until the completion of the new Stadium of Light at Monkwearmouth on the banks of the River Wear in 1997. The new stadium seated more than 42,000 on its completion, and has since been expanded to hold some 49,000 spectators. Sunderland&#x27;s relatively high attendances have been a major boost to the local economy – averaging at more than 30,000 even during the club&#x27;s most recent spell in the third tier of English football.

Redevelopment of the Monkwearmouth Colliery site, which sits on the north bank of the river Wear opposite the Vaux site, began in the mid-1990s with the creation of the Stadium of Light. In 2008 the Sunderland Aquatic Centre opened adjacent to the Stadium of Light, containing the only Olympic-size swimming pool between Leeds and Edinburgh. The Sheepfolds industrial estate occupies a large area of land between the Stadium and the Wearmouth Bridge. Sunderland Arc were in the process of purchasing land in the Sheepfolds, with a view to relocate the businesses and redevelop the site. The emphasis of development plans included further sporting facilities, in order to create a &quot;Sports Village&quot;. Other plans included a hotel, residential accommodation, and a footbridge linking the site with the Vaux development.

;Grove and Transport Corridor
The Sunderland Strategic Transport Corridor (SSTC) is a proposed transport link from the A19, through the city centre, to the port. A major phase of the plan was the creation of a new bridge, the Northern Spire Bridge, which links the A1231 Wessington Way on the north of the river with the Grove site in Pallion, on the south of the river. In 2008, Sunderland City Council offered the residents of Sunderland the opportunity to vote on the design of the bridge. The choices were a iconic cable-stayed bridge, which would result in a temporary increase in council tax, or a simple box structure which would be within the council&#x27;s budget. The results of the consultation were inconclusive, with residents keen to have an iconic bridge, but reluctant to have a subsequent increase in tax to fund it. Regardless of the ultimate design of the new bridge, the landing point will be the former Grove Cranes site in Pallion. Plans for this site focus around the creation of a new residential area, with homes, community buildings, commercial and retail space.

===Former===
====Major====
Once hailed as the &quot;Largest Shipbuilding Town in the World&quot;, ships were built on the Wear from at least 1346 onwards and by the mid-18th century Sunderland was one of the chief shipbuilding towns in the country. Sunderland Docks was the home of operations for the shipbuilding industry on Wearside. The Port of Sunderland was significantly expanded in the 1850s with the construction of Hudson Dock to designs by River Wear Commissioner&#x27;s Engineer John Murray, with consultancy by Robert Stephenson. One famous vessel was the &quot;Torrens&quot;, the clipper in which Joseph Conrad sailed, and on which he began his first novel. She was one of the most famous ships of her time and can claim to be the finest ship ever launched from a Sunderland yard. 

Between 1939 and 1945 the Wear yards launched 245 merchant ships totalling 1.5 million tons, a quarter of the merchant tonnage produced in the UK at this period. Competition from overseas caused a downturn in demand for Sunderland built ships toward the end of the 20th century. The last shipyard in Sunderland closed on 7 December 1988.

Sunderland, part of the Durham coalfield, has a coal-mining heritage that dates back centuries. At its peak in 1923, 170,000 miners were employed in County Durham alone, as labourers from all over Britain, including many from Scotland and Ireland, entered the region. As demand for coal slipped following World War II, mines began to close across the region, causing mass unemployment. The last coal mine closed in 1994. The site of the last coal mine, Wearmouth Colliery, is now occupied by the Stadium of Light, and a miner&#x27;s Davy lamp monument stands outside of the ground to honour the site&#x27;s mining heritage. Documentation relating to the region&#x27;s coalmining heritage are stored at the North East England Mining Archive and Resource Centre (NEEMARC).

====Minor====

As with the coal-mining and shipbuilding, overseas competition has forced the closure of all of Sunderland&#x27;s glass-making factories. Corning Glass Works, in Sunderland for 120 years, closed on 31 March 2007 and in January 2007, the Pyrex manufacturing site also closed, bringing to an end commercial glass-making in the city. However, there has been a modest rejuvenation with the opening of the National Glass Centre which, amongst other things, provides international glass makers with working facilities and a shop to showcase their work, predominantly in the artistic rather than functional field.

In 1855, John Candlish opened a bottleworks, producing glass bottles, with 6 sites at nearby Seaham and at Diamond Hall, Sunderland.

Vaux Breweries was established in the town centre in the 1880s and for 110 years was a major employer. Following a series of consolidations in the British Brewing industry, however, the brewery was finally closed in July 1999. Vaux in Sunderland and Wards in Sheffield had been part of the Vaux Group, but with the closure of both breweries it was re-branded The Swallow Group, concentrating on the hotel side of the business. This was subject to a successful take-over by Whitbread PLC in the autumn of 2000. It is now a brownfield site and this is a derelict site in an urban area.

==Education==
Sunderland Polytechnic was founded in 1969, becoming the University of Sunderland in 1992. The institution currently has over 17,000 students. The university is split into two campuses; the City Campus (site of the original Polytechnic) is just to the west of the city centre, as is the main university library and the main administrative buildings. The &#x27;Award-Winning&#x27; St Peter&#x27;s Riverside Campus is located on the north banks of the river Wear, next to the National Glass Centre and houses the School of Business, Law and Psychology, as well as Computing and Technology and The Media Centre. The University of Sunderland was named the top university in England for providing the best student experience by &quot;The Times Higher Education Supplement&quot; (THES) in 2006. Since 2001 Sunderland has been named the best new university in England by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Government performance indicators showed Sunderland as the best new university in England for the quality, range and quantity of its research.

Sunderland College is a further education establishment with campuses located at the Bede centre on Durham Road, Hylton, Doxford International Business Park and &#x27;Phoenix House&#x27; in the city centre. It has over 14,000 students, and based on exam results is one of the most successful colleges. St Peter&#x27;s Sixth Form College, next to St Peter&#x27;s Church and the University, opened in September 2008. The college is a partnership between the three Sunderland North schools and City of Sunderland College.

There are eighteen secondary schools in the Sunderland area, predominantly comprehensives. According to exam results, the most successful was St Robert of Newminster Catholic School, a coeducational secondary school and sixth form in Washington. However, comprehensive schools also thrive, notably the Roman Catholic single-sex schools St Anthony&#x27;s (for girls) and St Aidan&#x27;s (for boys). Both continue to attain high exam results.

There are seventy-six primary schools in Sunderland. According to the &#x27;Value Added&#x27; measure, the most successful is Mill Hill Primary School, in Doxford Park.

== Transport ==
===Heavy and light rail===
Sunderland station is served by four train operating companies:
* Grand Central operates five direct inter-city trains to London King&#x27;s Cross Monday-Saturday, with four on Sunday, taking about 3 hours 30 minutes.
* Northern Trains provides services between , , , and .
* London North Eastern Railway operates a daily inter-city return service to London King&#x27;s Cross, via Newcastle and 
* Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive owns and operates the Tyne &amp; Wear Metro, under the &quot;Nexus&quot; brand. The city has several stops on the Green line between and , including at , and before the city&#x27;s main station with the Park Lane Interchange, , and . Trains run every 12–15 minutes, depending on the time of day, at each of the nine stations.

 is a 30-minute Metro or train ride from Sunderland city centre, which facilitates connecting services to London King&#x27;s Cross every half hour that take approximately 2 hours 45 minutes. It also provides regular services to , , , Manchester Piccadilly, , and beyond.

Sunderland station opened in 1879 and completely redesigned for England&#x27;s 1966 World Cup footfall to get to Roker Park. It is underground and became part of the Tyne &amp; Wear Metro in 2002.

In March 2014, Metro owner Nexus proposed an extension of the network by an &#x27;on-street&#x27; tram link which would connect north to South Shields and Doxford Park to the west.

===Roads===

There are five main roads which connect the city:
*The city&#x27;s main road is the A19, which is a dual carriageway running north-to-south west of the city, crossing the River Wear at Hylton. The road goes links Doncaster with the north of Newcastle upon Tyne and the A1 to Edinburgh; it passes Hartlepool, Stockton-on-Tees, Middlesbrough and York to A168 and the A1M. The A19 originally ran through Sunderland city centre until a bypass was built in the 1970s, renaming the old route to the A1018.
*The A690 &quot;Durham Road&quot; terminates in the city centre and runs to Crook, County Durham, via the city of Durham.
*The A1231 (Sunderland Highway) begins in the city centre, crosses the Queen Alexandra Bridge and runs west through Washington to the A1. Most of this road is national speed limit dual carriageway.
*The A1018 and A183 roads both start in the centre of South Shields and enter Sunderland from the north, before merging to cross the Wearmouth Bridge. The A1018 follows a direct route from Shields to Sunderland, the A183 follows the coast. After crossing the bridge, the A1018 follows a relatively straight path to the south of Sunderland where it merges with the A19. The A183 becomes &quot;Chester Road&quot; and heads west out of the city to the A1 at Chester-le-Street. In Autumn 2007, the &quot;Southern Radial Route&quot; was opened. This is a bypass of the A1018 through Grangetown and Ryhope – a stretch that commonly suffered from congestion, especially during rush hour. The bypass starts just south of Ryhope and runs parallel to the cliff tops into Hendon, largely avoiding residential areas.

The Sunderland strategic transport corridor project is an ongoing investment to the city&#x27;s road infrastructure. The scheme improves transport links around the city, ensuring continuous dual carriageway between the A19 road and the port of Sunderland, as well as the Northern Spire bridge built over the Wear between Pallion (south) and Castletown (north).

===Buses===
The majority of bus services in Sunderland are provided by Stagecoach in Sunderland and Go North East, with a handful of services provided by Arriva North East. Cross-country and inter-city routes are operated mainly by National Express and Megabus.

A multimillion-pound transport interchange at Park Lane was opened on 2 May 1999 by the then &quot;Brookside&quot; actor Michael Starke. With 750,000 passengers per year, it is the busiest bus and coach station in Britain after Victoria Coach Station in Central London and has won several awards for innovative design.

A new Metro station was built underneath the bus concourse to provide a direct interchange as part of the extension to South Hylton in 2002.

===Cycling===
There are a number of cycle routes that run through and around Sunderland. The National Cycle Network National Route 1 runs from Ryhope in the south, through the centre of the city and then along the coast towards South Shields. Britain&#x27;s most popular long-distance cycle route – The &#x27;C2C&#x27; Sea to Sea Cycle Route – traditionally starts or ends when the cyclist dips their wheel in the sea on Roker beach. The &#x27;W2W&#x27; &#x27;Wear-to-Walney&#x27; route and the &#x27;Two-Rivers&#x27; (Tyne and Wear) route also terminate in Sunderland.

===Airports===

Newcastle Airport is a 55-minute Metro ride from Sunderland city centre; there is a Metro train connecting with the airport every 12–15minutes in both directions until about 11pm, Monday-Sunday.

Teesside International Airport can be reached in less than one hour by car.

Each year on the last weekend in July, the city hosted the Sunderland International Airshow. It took place primarily along the sea front at Roker and Seaburn.

===Port===
The Port of Sunderland is the second largest municipally-owned port in the United Kingdom. The port offers a total of 17 quays, which handle cargoes including forest products, non-ferrous metals, steel, aggregates and refined oil products, limestone, chemicals and maritime cranes. It also handles offshore supply vessels and has ship repair and drydocking facilities.

The river berths are deepwater and tidal, while the South Docks are entered via a lock with an beam restriction.

==Culture==

===Dialect and accent===

The dialect of Sunderland is known as Mackem, and contains a large amount of vocabulary and distinctive words and pronunciations not used in other parts of the United Kingdom. The Mackem dialect has much of its origins in the language spoken by the Anglo-Saxon population. Although the accent has much in common with Geordie, the dialect spoken in Newcastle, there are some distinctive differences.

A few Sunderland dialect words:
*Nee – No
*Bosh – Problem
*Marra – Mate
*Ha&#x27;way – Come on (Not to be confused with Geordie&#x27;s Howay)
*Knack – Hurt
*Git – Very (Used to emphasize something so &#x27;very good&#x27; becomes &#x27;git good&#x27;)
*Claes – Clothes

===Attractions and events===
Notable attractions for visitors to Sunderland include the 14th century Hylton Castle and the beaches of Roker and Seaburn. The National Glass Centre opened in 1998, reflecting Sunderland&#x27;s distinguished history of glass-making.

Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens, on Borough Road, was the first municipally funded museum in the country outside London. It houses a comprehensive collection of the locally produced Sunderland Lustreware pottery. The City Library Arts Centre, on Fawcett Street, housed the Northern Gallery for Contemporary Art until the library was closed in January 2017. The library service was relocated to the Museum and Winter Gardens and the Gallery for Contemporary Art transferred to Sunderland University.

Every year the city hosts a large Remembrance Day memorial service, the largest in the UK outside London in 2006.

Sunderland celebrates an annual Restaurant week, where city centre restaurants provide some of the best plates at low costs.

===Literature and art===

Lewis Carroll was a frequent visitor to the area. He wrote most of &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; at Whitburn as well as &quot;The Walrus and the Carpenter&quot;. Some parts of the area are also widely believed to be the inspiration for his Alice in Wonderland stories, such as Hylton Castle and Backhouse Park. There is a statue to Carroll in Whitburn library. Lewis Carroll was also a visitor to the Rectory of Holy Trinity Church, Southwick; then a township independent of Sunderland. Carroll&#x27;s connection with Sunderland, and the area&#x27;s history, is documented in Bryan Talbot&#x27;s 2007 graphic novel &quot;Alice in Sunderland&quot;. More recently, Sunderland-born Terry Deary, writer of the series of &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; books, has achieved fame and success, and many others such as thriller writer Sheila Quigley, are following his lead.

The Salford-born painter L. S. Lowry was a frequent visitor, staying in the Seaburn Hotel in Sunderland. Many of his paintings of seascapes and shipbuilding are based on Wearside scenes. The Northern Gallery for Contemporary Art on Fawcett Street and Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens showcase exhibitions and installations from up-and-coming and established artists alike, with the latter holding an extensive collection of Lowry. The National Glass Centre on Liberty Way also exhibits a number of glass sculptures.

===Media, film and television===
Sunderland has a local newspapers: the daily evening tabloid &quot;The Sunderland Echo&quot;, founded in 1873.

It also has its own commercial station, Nation Radio North East, formerly known as Sun FM, an independent station but now owned by Nation Broadcasting who acquired the station from the UKRD Group, a student-led community radio station, Spark, and a hospital radio station – Radio Sunderland for Hospitals, and can receive other north-eastern independent radio stations Hits Radio North East, Greatest Hits Radio North East, Capital North East, Smooth North East and Heart North East. The regional BBC radio station is BBC Radio Newcastle. The city is covered by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV&#x27;s Tyne Tees franchise, which has a regional office in the university&#x27;s media centre.

Sunderland&#x27;s inaugural film festival took place in December 2003 at the Bonded Warehouse building on Sunderland riverside, in spite of the lack of any cinema facilities in the city at that time, featuring the films of local and aspiring directors as well as re-showings of acclaimed works, such as Alan Bleasdale&#x27;s &quot;The Monocled Mutineer&quot;, accompanied by analysis. By the time of the second festival commencing on 21 January 2005, a new cinema multiplex had opened in Sunderland to provide a venue which allowed the festival to showcase over twenty films.

===Music, dance and kites===

Sunderland musicians that have gone on to reach international fame include Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics and all four members of Kenickie, whose vocalist Lauren Laverne later became known as a TV presenter. In recent years, the underground music scene in Sunderland has helped promote the likes of Frankie &amp; the Heartstrings, the Futureheads, the Golden Virgins and Field Music.

Other Mackem musicians include punk rockers the Toy Dolls (&quot;Nellie the Elephant&quot;, December 1984); oi! punk band Red Alert; melodic hardcore punk band Leatherface; the lead singer of dance outfit Olive, Ruth Ann Boyle (&quot;You&#x27;re Not Alone&quot;, May 1997); and A Tribe of Toffs (&quot;John Kettley is a Weatherman&quot;, December 1988).

In May 2005, Sunderland played host to BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend concert at Herrington Country Park, attended by 30,000 visitors and which featured Foo Fighters, Kasabian, KT Tunstall, Chemical Brothers and the Black Eyed Peas.

The Sunderland Stadium of Light, home to Sunderland AFC, is recognised internationally as a major stadium concert venue. Headlining acts have included Oasis, Take That, Pink, Kings of Leon, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Coldplay, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, Bon Jovi, Rihanna, One Direction, Foo Fighters and Beyoncé. The Empire Theatre sometimes plays host to music acts. Independent, a city-centre nightclub/music venue, satisfies underground music lovers.

The Manor Quay&#x27; the students&#x27; union nightclub on St Peter&#x27;s Riverside at the University of Sunderland, has also hosted the Arctic Monkeys, Maxïmo Park, 911, the Levellers and Girls Aloud. In 2009, the club was taken into private ownership under the name Campus and hosted N-Dubz, Ocean Colour Scene, Little Boots, Gary Numan and Showaddywaddy but has since been returned to the university. The former students&#x27; union Wearmouth Hall hosted Voice of the Beehive, Manic Street Preachers, The Primitives and Radiohead before closing in 1992.

Since 2009, Sunderland: Live in the City has played host to a series of free and ticketed live music events throughout venues in the city centre.

In 2013, local band Frankie and The Heartstrings opened a temporary pop up record store in the city, Pop Recs Ltd. Initially only intended to remain open for a fortnight, the store remains open and has hosted live performances from acts including the Cribs, the Vaccines and the Charlatans.

Sunderland also hosts the free International Festival of Kites, Music and Dance, which attracts kite-makers from around the world to Northumbria Playing Fields, Washington.

===Theatres and performance venues===

The Sunderland Empire Theatre opened in 1907 on High Street West in the city centre. It is the largest theatre in between Edinburgh and London, and completed a comprehensive refurbishment in 2004. Operated by international entertainment group Live Nation, the Empire is the only theatre between Glasgow and Leeds with sufficient capacity to accommodate large West End productions. It is where British comic actor Sid James died of a heart attack whilst on stage in 1976.

The Bunker is the only venue in Sunderland where you can rehearse, record, learn and perform, all in one location. Born as a youth project in 1980, finally settling in its current home in 1983, new music talent can practice and perform in the same building that has hosted gigs by The Clash, Bjork, Chumbawamba and Billy Bragg. The Bunker has a history synonymous with the development of music making in the North East.

Independent is popular grass roots music venue in Sunderland, nurturing young talent, supporting bands and giving people a stage to play their first ever show. Open since the early 2000s it has played host to not only a range of up-and coming talent, but acts such as The Zutons, Jamie T, Klaxons or local heroes such as The Futureheads and Field Music.

The Fire Station is a live music and performance auditorium that complements its Edwardian neighbour, the Empire Theatre. It is operated by Sunderland Culture. In 2017 the Sunderland MAC Trust restored Sunderland’s 1908 Central Fire Station, vacant since 1992, and converted it into a cultural hub with dance and literacy studios, teaching rooms and a bar/restaurant. The Fire Station auditorium is a 500 seat/800 standing venue attached to the restored building which opened in December 2021.

The Royalty Theatre on Chester Road is the home to the amateur Royalty Theatre Group who also put on a number of low-budget productions throughout the year. Film producer David Parfitt belonged to this company and is now a patron of the theatre.

The Sunniside area plays host to a number of smaller theatrical workshops and production houses.

===Twin towns and sister cities===

Sunderland is twinned with:
*Harbin, China
*Saint-Nazaire, France
*Washington, D.C., United States
*Essen, Germany

Sunderland is the only non-capital city that is twinned with Washington, D.C., as it includes the town of Washington, the ancestral home of George Washington&#x27;s family.

<text>The Bata Corporation (known as Bata, and in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, known as Baťa, ) is a multinational footwear, apparel and fashion accessories manufacturer and retailer of Moravian (Czech) origin, headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland.

The corporation is one of the world&#x27;s leading shoemakers by volume with 150 million pairs of shoes sold annually. It has a retail presence of over 5,300 shops in more than 70 countries across five continents and 21 production facilities in 18 countries. Bata is an employer to over 32,000 people globally.

A family-owned business for over 125 years, the company is organized into three business units: Bata, Bata Industrials (safety shoes) and AW Lab (sports style). Bata is a portfolio company with more than 20 brands and labels, such as Bata, North Star, Power, Bubblegummers, sprint, Weinbrenner, Sandak, and Toughees.

==Origins and history==
===Foundation===
The T. &amp; A. Baťa Shoe Company was founded on 21 September 1894 in the Moravian town of Zlín, Austria-Hungary (today in the Czech Republic), by Tomáš Baťa, his brother Antonín and his sister Anna, whose family had been cobblers for generations. The company employed 10 full-time employees with a fixed work schedule and a regular weekly wage.

In the summer of 1895, Tomáš was facing financial difficulties. To overcome these setbacks, he decided to sew shoes from canvas instead of leather. This type of shoe became very popular and helped the company grow to 50 employees. Four years later, Baťa installed its first steam-driven machines, beginning a period of rapid modernisation. In 1904, Tomáš read a newspaper article about machines being made in the United States such as Jan Ernst Matzeliger&#x27;s automatic laster. Therefore, he took three workers and journeyed to Lynn, a city outside Boston that was then the center of the world footwear industry, in order to study and understand the American system of mass production. After six months he returned to Zlín and he introduced mechanized production techniques that allowed the Baťa Shoe Company to become one of the first mass producers of shoes in Europe. Its first mass product, the &quot;Baťovky,&quot; was a leather and textile shoe for working people that was notable for its simplicity, style, light weight and affordable price. Its success helped fuel the company&#x27;s growth, and after Antonín&#x27;s death in 1908, Tomáš brought two of his younger brothers, Jan and Bohuš, into the business. Initial export sales and the first ever sales agencies began in Germany in 1909, followed by the Balkans and the Middle East. Baťa shoes were considered to be excellent quality, and were available in more styles than had ever been offered before. By 1912, Baťa was employing 1500 full-time workers, plus another several hundred who worked out of their homes in neighbouring villages.

===World War I===
In 1914, with the outbreak of World War I, the company had a significant development due to military orders. From 1914 to 1918 the number of Baťa&#x27;s employees increased ten times. The company opened its own stores in Zlín, Prague, Liberec, Vienna and Plzeň, among other towns.

In the global economic slump that followed World War I, the newly created country of Czechoslovakia was particularly hard hit. With its currency devalued by 75%, demand for products dropped, production was cut back, and unemployment was at an all-time high. Tomáš Baťa responded to the crisis by cutting the price of Bata shoes in half. The company&#x27;s workers agreed to a temporary 40 percent reduction in wages; in turn, Baťa provided food, clothing, and other necessities at half-price. He also introduced one of the first profit-sharing initiatives, transforming all employees into associates with a shared interest in the company&#x27;s success (today&#x27;s equivalent of performance-based incentives and stock options).

===Shoemaker to the world===
Consumer response to the price drop was dramatic. While most competitors were forced to close because of the crisis in demand between 1923 and 1925, Baťa was expanding as demand for the inexpensive shoes grew rapidly. The Baťa Shoe Company increased production and hired more workers. Zlín became a veritable factory town, a &quot;Baťaville&quot; covering several hectares. On the site were grouped tanneries, a brickyard, a chemical factory, a mechanical equipment plant and repair shop, workshops for the production of rubber, a paper pulp and cardboard factory (for production of packaging), a fabric factory (for lining for shoes and socks), a shoe-shine factory, a power plant and farming activities to cover food and energy needs. Workers, &quot;Baťamen&quot;, and their families had at their disposal all the necessary everyday life services, including housing, shops, schools, and hospital.

Baťa combined the automated efficiency of the factory with social welfare; the early experiments in collectivism and profit-sharing laid the groundwork for a reinvention of industrial management. Not only did the company build employee housing, schools, shops and a hospital, but it also offered recreational amenities — everything from a cinema, library, department store, dance halls, and espresso bars to a swimming pool and airfield, all courtesy of Bata Shoes. In Baťa&#x27;s own words, &quot;I have only found that a large plant can best be built when an entrepreneur aims to serve customers and employees, because that is the only way to ensure that customers and employees serve him and his ideas.&quot; (from the book &quot;Reflections and speeches&quot;, page 208).

===Diversification and foreign growth===

Baťa also began to build towns and factories outside of Czechoslovakia (Poland, Latvia, Romania, Switzerland, France) and to diversify into such industries as tanning (1915), the energy industry and agriculture (1917), forestry, newspaper publishing and brick manufacturing (1918), wood processing (1919), the rubber industry (1923), construction industry, railway, and air transport (1924), book publishing (1926), the film industry and food processing (1927), chemical production (1928), tyre manufacturing and insurance (1930), textile production (1931), motor and sea transport, and coal mining (1932), airplane manufacturing (1934), synthetic fibre production (1935), and river transport (1938). In 1923 the company boasted 112 branches.

In 1924, Tomáš Baťa displayed his business acumen by calculating how much turnover he needed to make with his annual plan, weekly plans and daily plans. Baťa utilized four types of wages – fixed rate, individual order based rate, collective task rate and profit contribution rate. He also set what became known as Baťa prices: numbers ending with a nine rather than with a whole number. His business skyrocketed. Soon Baťa found himself the fourth richest person in Czechoslovakia. From 1926 to 1928 the business blossomed as productivity rose 75 percent and the number of employees increased by 35 percent. In 1927 production lines were installed, and the company had its own hospital. By the end of 1928, the company&#x27;s head factory was composed of 30 buildings. Bat&#x27;a then created educational organizations such as the Baťa School of Work and introduced the five-day work week.

In 1932, at the age of 56, Tomáš Baťa died in a plane crash during take off under bad weather conditions at Zlín Airport Control of the company was passed to his half-brother, Jan Antonín Baťa, and his son, Thomas John Baťa, who would go on to lead the company for much of the twentieth century guided by the founder&#x27;s moral testament: the Baťa Shoe company was to be treated not as a source of private wealth, but as a public trust, a means of improving living standards within the community and providing customers with good value for their money. Promise was made to pursue the entrepreneurial, social and humanitarian ideals of their father.

The Baťa company was apparently the first big enterprise to systematically utilise aircraft for company purposes, including rapid transport of personnel on businesslike delivery of maintenance men and spares to a location where needed, originating the practice of business flying.

===Jan Antonín Baťa and international expansion===
At the time of Tomáš&#x27;s death, the Baťa company employed 16,560 people, maintained 1,645 shops and 25 enterprises. Jan Antonín Baťa, following the plans laid down by Tomáš Baťa before his death, expanded the company more than six times its original size throughout Czechoslovakia and the world. Plants in Britain, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia, Brazil, Kenya, Canada and the United States followed in the decade. In India, Batanagar was settled near Calcutta and accounted from the late 1930s nearly 7500 Baťamen. The Baťa model fitted anywhere, creating, for example, canteens for vegetarians in India. In exchange, the demands on workers were the same as in Europe: &quot;Be courageous. The best in the world is not good enough for us. Loyalty gives us prosperity &amp; happiness. Work is a moral necessity!&quot; Bata India was incorporated as Bata Shoe Company Pvt. Ltd in 1931 and went on to become Bata India Ltd. in 1973. The Batanagar factory was the first Indian shoe manufacturing unit to receive the ISO 9001 certification in 1993.

As of 1934, the firm owned 300 stores in North America (after World War II, many of theses stores were rebranded with the &quot;Barrett Shoes&quot; trademark), a thousand in Asia, more than 4,000 in Europe. In 1938, the Group employed just over 65,000 people worldwide, including 36% outside Czechoslovakia and had stakes in the tanning, agriculture, newspaper publishing, railway and air transport, textile production, coal mining and aviation realms.

===Bata-villes===
Company policy initiated under Tomáš Baťa was to set up villages around the factories for the workers and to supply schools and welfare. These villages include Batadorp in the Netherlands, Baťovany (present-day Partizánske) and Svit in Slovakia, Baťov (now Bahňák, part of Otrokovice) in the Czech Republic, Borovo-Bata (now Borovo Naselje, part of Vukovar in Croatia then in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia), Bata Park in Möhlin, Switzerland, in Lorraine, France, Batawa (Ontario) in Canada, Batatuba (São Paulo), Batayporã and Bataguassu (Mato Grosso do Sul) in Brazil, East Tilbury in Essex, England, Batapur in Pakistan and Batanagar and Bataganj in India. There was also a factory in Belcamp, Maryland, USA, northeast of Baltimore on U.S. Route 40 in Harford County.

The British &quot;Bata-ville&quot; in East Tilbury inspired the documentary film &quot;Bata-ville: We Are Not Afraid of the Future&quot;.

===World War II===
Just before the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, Baťa helped re-post his Jewish employees to branches of his firm all over the world. Germany occupied the remaining part of pre-war Czechoslovakia on 15 March 1939; Jan Antonín Baťa then spent a short time in jail but was then able to leave the country with his family. Jan Antonín Baťa stayed in the United States from 1939–1940, but when the USA entered the war, he felt it would be safer for his co-workers and their families back in occupied Czechoslovakia if he left the United States. He was put on British and US black lists for doing business with the Axis powers, and in 1941 he emigrated to Brazil.
After the war ended, the Czechoslovak authorities tried Baťa as a traitor, saying he had failed to support the anti-Nazi resistance. In 1947 he was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; to 15 years in prison. The company&#x27;s Czechoslovak assets were also seized by the state – several months before the communists came to power. He tried to save as much as possible of the business, submitting to the plans of Germany as well as financially supporting the Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile led by Edvard Beneš.

In occupied Europe, a Bata shoe factory was connected to the concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau. The first slave labour efforts in Auschwitz involved the Bata shoe factory. In 1942 a small camp was established to support the former Bata shoe factory (now under German administration and renamed &quot;Schlesische Schuh-Werke Ottmuth, A.G&quot;) at Chełmek with Jewish slave labourers. The prisoners, mostly from France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, were tasked to clean the ponds from which the plant drew the water it needed. Also slave workers from the ghetto of Radom were forced to work at the Bata factory for a soup a day.

The Baťa factory was bombed by the 15th AF, 455th BG at 1235 hrs using 254 x 500 RDX bombs (63.50 tons). The strikes fell south in the workers dwellings and carried across eastern half of plant layout. Numerous hits in this section included warehouses, machine shops and footwear production buildings.

===Post-war: rebuilding===
Tomáš&#x27;s son Thomas J. Bata, manager of the buying department of the British Bata Company, was unable to return until after the war. He was sent to Canada by his uncle Jan, to become the Vice President of the Bata Import and Export Company of Canada, which was founded in a company town named Batawa, opened in 1939. Foreign subsidiaries were separated from the parent company, and ownership of plants in Bohemia and Moravia was transferred to another member of the family.

After World War II, governments in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Poland and Yugoslavia confiscated and nationalized Bata factories, stripping Bata of its Eastern European assets.

In 1945, the decision was taken that Bata Development Limited in Great Britain would become the service headquarters of the Bata Shoe Organisation. Now based in the West, Thomas J. Bata, along with many Czechoslovakian expatriates, began to rebuild the business.

From its new base, the company gradually rebuilt itself, expanding into new markets throughout Asia, the Middle East, Australia, Africa and Latin America. Rather than organizing these new operations in a highly centralized structure, Bata established a confederation of autonomous units that could be more responsive to new markets in developing countries.

Between 1946 and 1960, 25 new factories were built and 1,700 company shops were opened. In 1962, the company had production and sales activities in 79 countries.

In 1964, Bata moved their headquarters to Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In 1965 they were moved again, into an ultra-modern building, the Bata International Centre. The building, located on Wynford Drive, in suburban North York, Ontario, Canada, was designed by architect John B. Parkin.

In 1979, the Bata family established the Bata Shoe Museum Foundation to operate an international centre for footwear research and house of a collection that was started by Sonja Bata, Thomas&#x27; wife, in the 1940s. As she travelled the world on business with her husband, she gradually built up a collection of traditional footwear from the areas she was visiting. The Bata Shoe Museum is in Toronto.

In 1980, Bata-sponsored Eliseo Salazar won the Aurora Formula One Championship. Bata was one of the official sponsors of the 1986 FIFA World Cup held in Mexico, and Bata Power shoes were the official footwear for the 1987 ICC Cricket World Cup. Bata also sponsored 2014 Electronic Sports World Cup.

===Czechoslovakia after 1989===
Thomas J. Baťa returned in December 1989, soon after the Velvet Revolution in November. The Czechoslovak government offered him the opportunity to invest in the ailing government-owned Svit shoe company. Since companies nationalised before 1948 were not returned to their original owners, the state continued to own Svit and privatised it during voucher privatisation in Czechoslovakia. Svit&#x27;s failure to compete in the free market led to its decline, and in 2000 Svit went bankrupt.

===Present===
After the global economic changes of the 1990s, the company closed a number of its factories in developed countries and focused on expanding retail business. Bata moved out of Canada in several steps. In 2000, it closed its Batawa factory, then in 2001, it closed its Bata retail stores, retaining its &quot;Athletes World&quot; retail chain.

In 2004, the Bata headquarters were moved to Lausanne, Switzerland and leadership was transferred to Thomas (Tomáš) G. Bata, grandson of the founder. The notable Bata headquarters building in Toronto was vacated and eventually demolished to much controversy. In 2007, the Athletes World chain was sold, ending Bata retail operations in Canada. Bata maintains the headquarters for its &quot;Power&quot; brand of footwear in Toronto. The Bata Shoe Museum, founded by Sonja Bata, and operated by a charitable foundation, is also located in Toronto.

Although no longer chairman of the company, the elder Bata remained active in its operations and carried business cards listing his title as &quot;chief shoe salesman.&quot; On 1 September 2008 Thomas John Bata (Thomáš Jan Baťa) died at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto at the age of 93.

Bata estimates that it serves more than 1 million customers per day, employing over 32,000 people, operates more than 5,300 shops, manages 21 production facilities and a retail presence in over 70 countries across the five continents. Bata has a strong presence in countries including India where it has been present since 1931.

Bata India has four factories. The Batanagar Industrial Township in Kolkata (1930) is the largest shoe-maker in Asia.

The business is organised in five regions: Africa (with regional office based in Limuru, Kenya), APAC (with regional office based in Singapore), Latin America (with regional office based in Santiago de Chile, Chile), India (with regional office based in New Delhi) and Europe (with regional office based in Padua, Italy).

In 2017 Selänne was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history. On June 26, 2017, Selänne was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as the second Finn after Jari Kurri.

Selänne was a first-round selection of the Jets, tenth overall, at the 1988 NHL Entry Draft, but initially remained in Finland. He led the SM-liiga in scoring as part of Jokerit&#x27;s Kanada-malja winning team in 1991–92 before moving to North America. He broke into the NHL by scoring 76 goals and 132 points in the 1992–93. It remains the league record for most goals and points by a rookie and earned him the Calder Memorial Trophy as the top first-year player in the NHL. He has scored 50 goals in a season three times and topped 100 points on four occasions. He played in 10 NHL All-Star Games, was named to four post-season All-Star teams and won the inaugural Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy in 1998–99 as the league&#x27;s leading goal scorer. He was named recipient of the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy in 2005–06 for perseverance and dedication to the game and was a member of the Ducks&#x27; 2007 Stanley Cup championship team.

Internationally, Selänne was a long-time member of the Finland national team. He played in five World Championships, winning a silver and bronze medal, and in three Canada Cup/World Cup of Hockey tournaments. A six-time Olympian, Selänne helped Finland win three bronze medals and, in 2006, a silver medal. He is the all-time leader in scoring at the Olympic Men’s ice hockey tournament with 43 points. A national star in his native country, Selänne is the subject of a top-grossing biographical documentary in Finland. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2017.

==Early life==
Selänne was born on July 3, 1970, in Helsinki, Finland. He has a twin brother, Paavo and another brother, Panu. He was raised by his mother Liisa Viitanen (died 2018) and father Ilmari Selänne until they divorced in the late 1980s. The family lived for a time in Rauma before settling in Espoo around the time Teemu was 5 years old.

Selänne played three sports as a youth: hockey, bandy and association football. He played hockey and football with and against Paavo, though his brother ultimately gave up on both sports in favour of field hockey, where he was a member of numerous Finnish and European championship teams. Teemu was small as a youth, creating in him a competitive spirit and drive to improve his skills. Focusing on hockey, he eventually joined the junior squad of Jokerit in Helsinki.

As a young adult, Selänne attended business school for two years and served a mandatory one-year stint with the Finnish Defence Forces. During his tenure with Jokerit, he also spent three years as a kindergarten teacher. His experiences visiting kids at Helsinki&#x27;s children&#x27;s hospital led to him co-founding the Godfathers&#x27; Foundation, an organization that raises money for ill children.

==Playing career==

===Jokerit (1989–1992)=== 

Selänne played three years of junior hockey in Jokerit&#x27;s development program, culminating in 1987–88 with a 43-goal, 66 point season in 33 games and a Finnish Junior A championship. His performance prompted the National Hockey League (NHL)&#x27;s Winnipeg Jets to select him with their first-round pick, tenth overall, at the 1988 NHL Entry Draft. Selänne attended training camp with the Jets, but returned to Finland owing to his military service.

After graduating from junior hockey, Selänne joined Jokerit&#x27;s senior team in the 1. Divisioona in 1988–89 and scored 69 points in 35 games. Jokerit moved up to the SM-liiga in 1989–90, and while Selänne missed the majority of the season due to a leg injury, he scored 12 points in 11 games played. Playing a full season in 1990–91, Selänne scored 33 goals and 58 points in 42 games. He was named the recipient of the Raimo Kilpiö trophy as the league&#x27;s most gentlemanly player. Selänne&#x27;s best season in the SM-liiga came in 1991–92 when he recorded 62 points in 44 games. With 39 goals, he won the Aarne Honkavaara trophy as top goal scorer. He added 17 points in ten playoff games, and scored the winning goal as Jokerit won the Kanada-malja as SM-liiga playoff champion.

===Winnipeg Jets (1992–1996)===

The Jets&#x27; organizational philosophy at the time was to allow their European draft picks to develop in their native countries, but by 1991, the franchise was working to bring him to Winnipeg. As Selänne had not yet signed a contract when he chose to play in North America for the 1992–93 season, he was considered a restricted free agent. The Calgary Flames signed him to an offer sheet on a three-year contract worth $2.7 million, $1.5 million higher than what the Jets had been offering. Though concerned about paying such a high salary, Winnipeg exercised its right to match the offer. Selänne made his NHL debut on October 6, 1992, and recorded two assists in a 4–1 Jets victory over the Detroit Red Wings. He scored his first career NHL goal two nights later against goaltender Jeff Hackett of the San Jose Sharks.

Selänne scored his first career hat trick in his fifth contest and had 11 goals in his first 12 NHL games. He finished the season with 16 multi-goal games, including four hat-tricks and a four-goal game, en route to breaking the NHL record for goals by a rookie. He surpassed Mike Bossy&#x27;s record of 53 goals on March 2, 1993, against the Quebec Nordiques and on March 23, scored his 110th point, against the Toronto Maple Leafs, to break Peter Šťastný&#x27;s rookie points record. Selänne finished the season tied for fifth in scoring with 132 points, and his 76 goals tied with Alexander Mogilny for the League lead. His offensive exploits helped pull the Jets into the 1993 Stanley Cup playoffs, where they lost a first-round matchup to the Vancouver Canucks. In recognition of his season, Selänne was voted the recipient of the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year, was named to the first All-Star team and played in his first of ten career NHL All-Star Games.

Unable to maintain a similar pace in 1993–94—indeed, his rookie totals in goals and points would both prove his career-high by more than 20—Selänne&#x27;s offensive production declined by 30 percent midway through the season. He scored his 100th career goal on January 12, 1994, against the Buffalo Sabres, reaching the milestone in his 130th game, the second-fastest in NHL history and only one game later than Bossy. Selänne finished the season with 54 points in 51 games, but missed the final 33 games of the season after suffering a severed Achilles tendon in a January 26 game against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The 1994–95 NHL lockout resulted in Selänne splitting the season between Jokerit and the Jets. While playing in Finland, Selänne was named to the tournament all-star team as Jokerit won the 1994 European Cup.

Selänne&#x27;s future in Winnipeg, a small, often cash-strapped market came into question several times during this career, to the extent that pundits reported at the 1995 NHL entry draft that he may be traded out of Winnipeg around the time of the draft (at which point he was unsigned). While a trade in the offseason never materialized, Selänne&#x27;s career in Winnipeg came to an end midway through the following 1995–96 season. He was leading the Jets with 72 points when, on February 6, 1996, he was traded to Anaheim. The Mighty Ducks sent first-round draft picks Chad Kilger and Oleg Tverdovsky, along with a third-round selection at the 1996 NHL Entry Draft, in exchange for Selänne, Marc Chouinard and a fourth-round draft pick. Selänne was upset when notified of the deal during practice and left the Winnipeg Arena without speaking to anyone.

===Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (1996–2001)===
Following a period of adjustment, Selänne gained an appreciation for his new team; he quickly came to call the deal the best thing that ever happened to him. He was paired with Paul Kariya, whom he met at the 1996 NHL All-Star Game, and the duo were counted on to lead the young franchise to a postseason berth for the first time. Selänne scored 36 points in 28 games with the Ducks, and combined with his Jets totals, finished the 1995–96 season with 108 points. He followed it up with a third 100-point season in 1996–97, finishing with 109, including 51 goals. He was named to the first All-Star team for a second time, while he and Kariya led the Mighty Ducks into the franchise&#x27;s first playoff appearance in 1997. Despite being criticized as being a &quot;one-line team&quot;, Anaheim defeated the Phoenix Coyotes in the first round before being eliminated by the Detroit Red Wings.
The 1998 All-Star Game was Selänne&#x27;s fifth, and after scoring a hat-trick, he became the first European player to be named the MVP in the All-Star Game&#x27;s 46-year history. He finished the 1997–98 season with his third career 50-goal season; his total of 52 tied Peter Bondra for the NHL lead, and he scored his 500th career point on January 12, 1998, with an assist against the Los Angeles Kings. He was a finalist for both the Hart Memorial Trophy as the League&#x27;s MVP (finishing third) and the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for gentlemanly conduct (as the runner-up), and was named to the second All-Star team. The NHL created the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy in 1998–99 to be presented to the League&#x27;s leading goal scorer; Selänne became its inaugural winner following a 47-goal season.

===San Jose Sharks (2001–2003)===
An 85-point season followed in 1999–2000, and he was the Mighty Ducks&#x27; leading scorer with 59 points through 61 games in 2000–01. Anaheim, however, sat in last place in the Western Conference, and on March 5, 2001, chose to make a trade. Selänne was sent to San Jose in exchange for Jeff Friesen, Steve Shields and a second-round selection in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. Selänne&#x27;s debut with the Sharks was delayed by two weeks as he underwent minor surgery to remove loose cartilage in his knee the following day. After finishing the season with 13 points in 12 games with San Jose, Selänne led the Sharks with 29 goals in 2001–02. He also led the team in both goals (28; tied) and points (64) in 2002–03. As the Sharks fell out of the playoff race, they looked to make changes; the New Jersey Devils sought to acquire Selänne, but he exercised a no-trade clause in his contract and blocked the deal.

===Colorado Avalanche (2003–2004)===
Selänne then declined an option in his contract that would have paid $6.5 million in 2003–04 and instead opted to sign a one-year, $5.8 million contract with the Colorado Avalanche, where he was joined by former Anaheim teammate Paul Kariya. The pair chose to sign with the Avalanche together in the belief it was their best chance at winning the Stanley Cup. Their hope failed to materialize, however, as Selänne endured a disastrous season in which he scored only 16 goals and 32 points—the lowest totals of his career to that date—and was ultimately relegated to Colorado&#x27;s fourth line, but was also held out of the lineup as a healthy scratch during a playoff game. He struggled throughout the year with knee problems that ultimately required surgery, his third such procedure, and with the 2004–05 season canceled by a labour dispute, took the time off to recover.

===Return to Anaheim (2005–2014)===
A free agent when the NHL resumed play in 2005–06, Selänne returned to Anaheim by signing a one-year, $1 million contract with the Mighty Ducks. As his usual number 8 was being worn by defenseman Sandis Ozoliņš, Selänne returned to wearing number 13, the number he had originally worn during his first two NHL seasons with the Winnipeg Jets. During a resurgent season, he scored his 1,000th career point on January 30, 2006, with a goal in a 4–3 victory over Los Angeles. Selänne completed the season with 40 goals and 90 points, both of which led the Mighty Ducks, and he was named the recipient of the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for dedication and perseverance.

After reaching the Western Conference Final in the 2006 playoffs, the newly renamed Anaheim Ducks entered the 2006–07 season with high expectations; the team brought Selänne back with a one-year, $3.75 million contract. He reached several milestones during the season: Selänne became the 36th player in NHL history, and second Finn after Jari Kurri, to score 500 goals, on November 22, 2006, against Colorado. On December 31, he played his 1,000th NHL game. As part of a season in which he again led Anaheim in goals (48) and points (94), Selänne played in his tenth All-Star Game in 2007, and scored his first hat-trick in six years (the 19th of his career) on January 12, 2007. It was the same day he spoke with a friend in Finland with terminal cancer who asked to be sent the game puck if Selänne had a three-goal game. Finally, he scored his 301st goal as a Duck on February 18, 2007, to break Paul Kariya&#x27;s franchise record.
Early in the 2007 playoffs, Selänne became Anaheim&#x27;s all-time leading playoff scorer when he recorded his 30th point as a Duck with an assist on April 13 against the Minnesota Wild. The Ducks defeated the Wild, Vancouver Canucks and Detroit Red Wings to reach the Stanley Cup Finals; it was the first time in Selänne&#x27;s career that he played in the NHL&#x27;s championship series. As the sentimental favourite to win the Stanley Cup, his teammates motivated themselves to win the title for his benefit; Ducks goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère noted, &quot;We don&#x27;t have any better teammate. He&#x27;s a guy who always has fun. He deserves this and if we can help him along the way, that would be great. I&#x27;d just love to see Teemu win this thing.&quot; Selänne finished the playoffs with 15 points in 21 games, and after 14 NHL seasons, the 36-year-old Selänne raised the Stanley Cup with his teammates after defeating the Ottawa Senators in five games.

Following the Cup win, Selänne contemplated retirement. He remained undecided on a return—and as a free agent, out of the Ducks lineup to begin the 2007–08 season—until he finally chose to return and signed a one-year contract with Anaheim on January 28, 2008. He made his return on February 5 against the New York Islanders, and the Ducks posted the League&#x27;s best record from that point to the end of the regular season by winning 20 of 26 games. In his third game back, Selänne scored his 670th point as a member of the Ducks with an assist in a 4–2 victory over the Calgary Flames. With it, he broke Kariya&#x27;s franchise record of 669.

Selänne returned to the Ducks in 2008–09 and signed a two-year contract. He missed several weeks of the season due to a quad muscle injury suffered when he was cut by his own skate following a hit by Denis Grebeshkov of the Edmonton Oilers, but appeared in 65 games and scored 54 points. He played his 1,100th game during the season, became the sixth European player to score 1,200 career points and appeared in his 100th career playoff game. Selänne reached additional milestones in 2009–10, as he became the 18th player in NHL history to score 600 goals, accomplishing the feat on March 21, 2010, against the Colorado Avalanche and upon scoring his 602nd goal on April 2 against the Vancouver Canucks, surpassing his childhood idol, Jari Kurri.

Selänne finished eighth in NHL scoring in 2010–11 with 31 goals and 49 assists in 73 games. His 80 points was the third-highest in NHL history by a player over the age of 40 (Gordie Howe, 103 and Johnny Bucyk, 83). He also scored his 1,300th point, achieving the mark with a two-goal performance on January 16, 2011, against Edmonton. Questions about whether Selänne would return for another NHL season had become an annual topic of discussion, and his decision to return for 2011–12 was delayed by a knee operation that left him uncertain if he would be capable of playing. Nonetheless, Selänne appeared in every game for the Ducks and became the oldest player in NHL history to play an entire 82-game season while leading the team with 66 points. 15 years after the original Jets relocated, a new Winnipeg Jets franchise joined the NHL, and fans in the Manitoba capital continued to view Selänne as a local hero. In his first return to Winnipeg, he was cheered by exuberant fans who booed every other Ducks player. Selänne was named to the Western Conference roster for the 2012 NHL All-Star Game, but declined his invitation and asked the League to instead send his teammate Corey Perry.

Following a 24-point effort in the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, Selänne announced that 2013–14 would be the 21st and final season of his NHL career. He missed several games early in the season after he was struck in the face by an errant stick that knocked out several teeth and required 40 stitches to close cuts. Selänne recorded 27 points in 64 games for the Ducks; his final regular-season game, a 3–2 victory over Colorado, was a celebration of his career. He wore the captain&#x27;s &quot;C&quot; in place of Ryan Getzlaf for the game and as it neared conclusion, received standing ovations from the Anaheim crowd each time he took a shift. Selänne was named the game&#x27;s first, second and third star following the game and took a celebratory lap with Colorado goaltender and former Anaheim teammate Jean-Sébastien Giguère, who was also contemplating retirement.

Selänne made his final post-season appearance during the 2014 playoffs. He had six points in 12 games, but was also held out of the lineup for one game against the Dallas Stars, a decision that angered Ducks fans. He played his final game on May 16, 2014, as the Ducks were eliminated by Los Angeles. Following the contest, Selänne was saluted by fans, teammates and opponents alike, and took a final lap around the rink.

===International===






Selänne&#x27;s international debut came with the Finland national junior team. He recorded 16 points in six games at the 1988 European Junior Championship and was named to the tournament all-star team. After participating in the 1989 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships for the sixth place Finns, Selänne made his debut with the senior team at the 1991 World Championship where he finished third in tournament scoring with 11 points for the fifth-place finishers. After playing in the 1991 Canada Cup, he made his Olympic debut at the 1992 Albertville Games. Selänne tied for the tournament scoring lead with seven goals, and was tied for fourth in overall scoring at 11 points.

It was four years before Selänne returned to international play; he appeared in the 1996 World Championship and the 1996 World Cup of Hockey and averaged over one point per game in both tournaments as Finland finished fifth each time. At the 1998 Winter Olympics, Selänne finished with ten points in five games. He was the tournament&#x27;s leading scorer on a Finnish team that he described in 2003 as the best he ever played on and the best in the tournament, but lost the semifinal, 7–4 to Russia. He suffered an abdominal muscle injury that prevented him from playing in the third place game, which Finland won 3–2 over Canada; Selänne and his teammates ended the tournament as the bronze medal winners.

The Finns finished one position higher at the 1999 World Championship; The tournament&#x27;s medal round was conducted in a two-game series format followed by a ten-minute sudden victory overtime if the each team wins one game. Finland and Sweden split their semifinal, but the Finns advanced to the final in the overtime period after Selänne set up Marko Tuomainen&#x27;s winning goal. The Czech Republic defeated Finland to capture the gold medal, also in a sudden victory period. Selänne finished the tournament with 11 points, was named to the all-star team and was voted the most valuable player of the World Championship.

Selänne served as the Finnish captain at the 2002 Winter Olympics and led his nation to an important preliminary round victory over Russia, however he had only three goals and no assists in four games as the Finns finished in sixth place. The World Championship was held in Finland, and the hosts were hailed as the favourite to win the title. Though Selänne led the tournament with eight goals, Finland lost their quarterfinal match against Sweden and finished fifth overall.

The 2004 World Cup of Hockey was played after Selänne&#x27;s difficult NHL season with Colorado. For Selänne, the tournament was about recovering his joy at playing hockey. The Finns went undefeated to reach the final, but Selänne and his teammates had to settle for second place after losing the championship game to Canada, 3–2. Returning to the national team for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Selänne joined Jere Lehtinen and Saku Koivu on what &quot;The Hockey News&quot; called the best team Finland has ever produced. The Finns outscored their opposition 19–2 in the group stage, then defeated the United States and shut-out Russia in the semi-final. The Finns, however, were overcome in the final by Sweden, 3–2, and were relegated to the silver medal. Selänne scored six goals and 11 points in the tournament, was named to the all-star team and received the Directorate Award as top forward.

Selänne stated he would retire from international competition after a bronze medal-winning performance followed at the 2008 IIHF World Championship. However, he returned to play in his fifth Olympic tournament at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. Selänne became the all-time leading scorer in Olympic hockey history on February 19, 2010, as he recorded his 37th point in competition in a game against Germany. The Finns won the bronze medal with a 5–3 victory over Slovakia in the third-place game.

Selänne was named to the Finnish team for the 2014 Sochi Olympics, which marked his sixth appearance at the tournament. In the quarterfinals, Selänne scored a goal and an assist as the Finns ousted the host Russians from the tournament, then added two goals in the bronze medal match in a 5–0 victory over the United States. The 43-year-old Selänne became the oldest player to win a medal in Olympic hockey, a record later broken by compatriot Riikka Sallinen in 2018. He was named most valuable player of the Olympic tournament as selected by the media, and added six points to his Olympic record career total of 43.

==Playing style==
Selänne&#x27;s primary attribute is his skating speed. Nicknamed the &quot;Finnish Flash&quot;, he uses his speed to evade opposition defenders. According to defenceman Nicklas Lidström, &quot;He&#x27;s one of those snipers that can put the puck on net because he finds openings and he knows where to be on the ice. Former teammate Jean-Sébastien Giguère added, &quot;He&#x27;s just a very elegant player. He&#x27;s got a very nice stride to his skating, he plays with a lot of energy, a lot of enthusiasm ... with the skill he has, it just makes for a heck of a great player.&quot;

An elite offensive player, Selänne is the highest scoring Finnish-born player in NHL history. He ended his career with 684 goals, 12th all-time in NHL history, and 1,457 points, 15th best. His 110 game-winning goals tied him with Brett Hull for fourth all-time. Selänne is one of eight players to score 70 or more goals in one season, and he is the most recent player to do. He holds numerous records, including most goals, 76, and points, 132, by a rookie. Both totals are also single-season records for the Winnipeg Jets/Phoenix Coyotes franchise. The holder of most major franchise records for the Ducks, Selänne leads the team at 457 goals, 531 assists, 988 points and 966 games played. He also holds single season records with 52 goals and 109 points. Even before his playing career had ended, the Ducks announced that Selänne&#x27;s number 8 would be the first number retired by the franchise. The team formally retired his number on January 11, 2015, prior to a game against the Jets.

==Personal life==
Selänne was born in Turku but his legal birthplace is Helsinki.
Selänne is known for his fun-loving personality and is known to make an effort to sign autographs and shake hands. He is well-respected in the NHL players, coaches, and fans, including those of opposing teams. Selänne considers Paul Kariya and Joe Sakic to be the best friends he earned in the NHL, and both attended his final regular-season game against the Avalanche.

An avid car collector, Selänne has entered the World Rally Championship (WRC) twice, finishing the Rally Finland 33rd overall in 1997 and 24th in 1998. He raced under the pseudonym &quot;Teukka Salama&quot; (&quot;Teddy Flash&quot; in English). In 1999 Selänne was involved in a crash while practicing for a rally race in his native Finland, an incident that was national news in the country. The vehicle he crashed into was driven by Finnish Ice Hockey Association president Kalervo Kummola, which put the latter into a wheelchair for four months. Due to Finnish laws that set fines based on an offender&#x27;s salary, Selänne received a $50,000 fine for the incident.

A popular figure in Finland, Selänne&#x27;s success in the NHL has been credited with aiding the growth of hockey in the country. He was once named the sexiest man in Finland by fashion magazine &quot;Eeva&quot;, and is the subject of the 2013 documentary film &quot;Selänne&quot;, directed by JP Siili, and which chronicles his life. The film became the highest grossing documentary in Finnish history within a month of its September 27 release, and was the third highest grossing locally produced film of the year.

After retiring from professional ice hockey, Selänne has become an active political commentator on Twitter. Selänne has said that he got interested in politics in 2015 after Donald Trump started his political campaign. Selänne supported Trump for president in the 2016 United States presidential election, but has later stated that he has been falsely labeled a Trump supporter. In 2023, he mentioned Mike Pence and Ron DeSantis as politicians he prefers over Trump. In Finnish politics, Selänne has supported the centre-right National Coalition Party. In 2024, Selänne self-identified as a Republican and again endorsed Donald Trump in the 2024 United States presidential election. It was the first American presidential election where he could vote.

Selänne opened a popular, Michelin-starred steakhouse in nearby Laguna Beach with longtime friend Jim Shumate, a longtime Orange County restaurant operator who finally found the Laguna Beach property after a 5-year search throughout Orange County.

In November 2019, Selänne released his authorized biography in North America titled &quot;Teemu Selänne: My Life.&quot; In March 2024, Selänne and his wife Sirpa gained citizenship of the United States. They have lived in Southern California since 1996.

Selänne starred in the August 1, 2024 movie &quot;Minor Leaguer&quot;, alongside hockey legend Brett Hull.

<doc id="264869" wikidata="Q1170179" url="?curid=264869" title="Lifeboat (1944 film)">
<text>Lifeboat is a 1944 American survival film directed by Alfred Hitchcock from a story by John Steinbeck. It stars Tallulah Bankhead and William Bendix, alongside Walter Slezak, Mary Anderson, John Hodiak, Henry Hull, Heather Angel, Hume Cronyn and Canada Lee. The film is set entirely on a lifeboat launched from a freighter torpedoed and sunk by a Nazi U-boat.

The first in Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;limited-setting&quot; films, the others being &quot;Rope&quot; (1948), &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; and &quot;Rear Window&quot; (both 1954), it is the only film Hitchcock made for 20th Century Fox. The film received three Oscar nominations for Best Director, Best Original Story and Best CinematographyBlack and White. Bankhead won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.

Though dispararaged at the time of its release by a couple of influential film critics for its supposedly sympathetic depiction of a German U-boat captain, &quot;Lifeboat&quot; is now viewed more favorably and has been listed by several modern critics as one of Hitchcock&#x27;s most underrated films.

==Plot==
Eight British and American civilians, service members and United States Merchant Mariners are adrift in a lifeboat after their ship and a German U-boat sink each other in combat. Willi, a German survivor of the U-boat, is pulled aboard. During an animated debate, engine room crewman Kovac demands the German be thrown out to drown. However, the others object, with radioman Stanley, wealthy industrialist Rittenhouse and columnist Connie Porter succeeding in arguing that he be allowed to stay. Porter is thrilled at having photographed the battle, but her photo camera is the first of her many possessions to be lost overboard in a succession of incidents.

Mrs. Higley, a young British woman whose infant child is dead when they are pulled from the water, must be tied down to stop her from hurting herself. She jumps off the boat in Porter&#x27;s mink coat, while the other passengers sleep. Willi is revealed to be the U-boat captain, rather than a mere crewman.

The inhabitants attempt to organize their rations, set a course for Bermuda, and coexist as they try to survive. The passengers also cooperate through this stress, such as when they must amputate the leg of one of their boatmates, the injured Gus Smith.

Kovac takes charge, rationing the little food and water they have, but Willi, who has been consulting a concealed compass and reveals that he speaks English, wrests control away from him in a storm.

Gus Smith, who has been drinking seawater and is hallucinating, catches Willi drinking water from a hidden flask. Gus tries to tell Stanley but Stanley doesn&#x27;t believe him. While the others sleep, Willi pushes him over the side. Gus&#x27;s calls for help rouse Stanley and the others, but it is too late.

When the inhabitants realize that Willi does actually have a flask of water, Joe pulls it from Willi&#x27;s shirt, but it breaks. Willi explains that like everyone on a U-boat he had food tablets and energy pills, saying that to survive, one must have a plan. In anger, all the other survivors except Joe descend upon Willi, beat him and toss him from the boat to his death.

Later, Rittenhouse says that he will never understand Willi&#x27;s ingratitude, musing, &quot;What do you do with people like that?&quot; No one answers. Stanley proposes to Alice, and she accepts, although they have little hope of surviving. Connie chastises everyone for giving up, then offers her Cartier diamond bracelet as bait for fishing. A fish bites, but Joe sights a ship, and in the rush for the oars, the line goes overboard and the bracelet is lost.

The ship they have spotted is the German supply ship towards which Willi had been steering them. Before a launch can pick them up, both it and the supply ship are sunk by gunfire from a US warship and a brief battle is waged between the two which nearly destroys the lifeboat. After the battle ends, Kovac estimates that the Allied vessel will be there in twenty minutes. Connie panics over her appearance. Joe hopes his wife isn&#x27;t worried. Rittenhouse admires a picture of Joe&#x27;s family, though he persists in calling him &quot;George&quot;.

A frightened, wounded young German seaman is pulled aboard the lifeboat. Rittenhouse is now all for killing him, and the others, including Kovac, have to hold him back. The German sailor pulls a gun, but is disarmed by Joe. The seaman asks in German, &quot;Aren&#x27;t you going to kill me?&quot; Kovac muses, &quot;&#x27;Aren&#x27;t you going to kill me?&#x27; What are you going to do with people like that?&quot; Stanley says &quot;I don&#x27;t know, I was thinking of Mrs. Higley and her baby, and Gus.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; Connie says, &quot;maybe they can answer that.&quot; The film ends there, implying that the characters were then rescued and returned to American society.

Cast notes
* William Yetter Jr. appeared on screen in a speaking role as the German sailor but was not listed in the film&#x27;s credits.
* Except for a cameo appearance in &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot; (1943), Bankhead had not appeared in a film since &quot;Faithless&quot; in 1932. She was paid $75,000 ($ in ) for her work in &quot;Lifeboat&quot;.

==Production==
At the time that &quot;Lifeboat&quot; went into production, Alfred Hitchcock was under contract to David O. Selznick. 20th Century Fox obtained the director&#x27;s services in exchange for that of several actors and technicians, as well as the rights to three stories that Fox owned. Hitchcock was to direct two films for the studio, but the second was never made, apparently because Fox was unhappy with the length of time taken to finish production on &quot;Lifeboat&quot;.

It was Hitchcock who came up with the idea for the film. He approached A.J. Cronin, James Hilton, and Ernest Hemingway to help write the script before giving the project to John Steinbeck, who had previously written the screenplay for the 1941 documentary &quot;The Forgotten Village&quot;, but had not written a fictional story for the screen. It was Steinbeck&#x27;s intention to write and publish a novel and sell the rights to the studio, but the story was never published because his literary agents considered it &quot;inferior&quot;. Steinbeck received $50,000 ($ in ) for the rights to his story. Steinbeck was unhappy with the film because it presented what he considered to be &quot;slurs against organized labor&quot; and a &quot;stock comedy Negro&quot; when his story had a &quot;Negro of dignity, purpose and personality&quot;. He requested, unsuccessfully, that his name be removed from the credits. A short story version of Hitchcock&#x27;s idea appeared in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine on November 13, 1943. It was written by Harry Sylvester and Hitchcock, with Steinbeck credited with the &quot;original screen story&quot;. Jo Swerling wrote the bulk of the screenplay. Other writers who worked on various drafts of the script include Hitchcock&#x27;s wife Alma Reville, as well as MacKinlay Kantor, Patricia Collinge, Albert Mannheimer, and Marian Spitzer. Hitchcock also brought in Ben Hecht to rewrite the ending.

In the 1940s, African-American actor and playwright Sidney Easton sued 20th Century Fox, for having used his play, &quot;Lifeboat #13&quot;, as the basis for the film. Easton settled out of court four years later for a few thousand dollars, and relinquished the copyright to the play.

&quot;Lifeboat&quot; was originally planned to be filmed in Technicolor with an all-male cast, many of whom were going to be unknowns. Canada Lee, who was primarily a stage actor with only one film credit at the time, was the first actor cast in the film.

Hitchcock planned the camera angles for the film using a miniature lifeboat and figurines. Four lifeboats were used during shooting. Rehearsals took place in one, separate boats were used for close-ups and long shots, and another was in the studio&#x27;s large-scale tank, where water shots were made. Except for background footage shot by the second unit around Miami, in the Florida Keys, and on San Miguel Island in California, the film was shot in the 20th Century Fox studio on Pico Boulevard in what is now Century City.

&quot;Lifeboat&quot; was in production from August 3 through November 17, 1943. Scenes were shot in sequence to aid character development. Illnesses were a constant part of the production from the beginning. Before shooting began, William Bendix replaced actor Murray Alper when Alper became ill. After two weeks of shooting, director of photography Arthur Miller was replaced by Glen MacWilliams because of illness. Tallulah Bankhead came down with pneumonia twice during shooting, while Mary Anderson became seriously ill during production, causing several days of production time to be lost. Hume Cronyn suffered two cracked ribs and nearly drowned when he was caught under a water-activator making waves for a storm scene. He was saved by a lifeguard.

The film has no musical score during the narrative (apart from the singing of the U-boat captain and of Gus, accompanied by flute); the Fox studio orchestra was used only for the opening and closing credits. Hitchcock dismissed the idea of having music in a film about people stranded at sea by asking, &quot;Where would the orchestra come from?&quot;, to which musical director Hugo Friedhofer is said to have asked in reply, &quot;Where would the cameras come from?&quot;

===Cameo===

Director Alfred Hitchcock made cameo appearances in most of his films. He once commented to François Truffaut – in &quot;Hitchcock/Truffaut&quot; (Simon and Schuster, 1967) – that this particular cameo was difficult to achieve, as there are no passers-by in the film. Although he originally considered posing as a body floating past the lifeboat – an approach he later considered for his cameo in &quot;Frenzy&quot; – Hitchcock was inspired by his own success with weight loss and decided to pose for &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; photos in an advertisement for a fictional weight-loss drug, &quot;Reduco&quot;, shown in a newspaper that was in the boat. Hitchcock said that he was besieged by letters from people asking about Reduco. Hitchcock used the product again in &quot;Rope&quot;, where his profile and “Reduco” appear on a red neon sign. The &quot;Lifeboat&quot; cameo appears 25 minutes into the film.

==Reception==
&quot;Variety&quot; praised the film upon its release, saying, &quot;John Steinbeck‘s devastating indictment of the nature of Nazi bestiality, at times an almost clinical, dissecting room analysis, emerges as powerful adult motion picture fare. . . . Hitchcock pilots the piece skillfully, ingeniously developing suspense and action. Despite that it’s a slow starter, the picture, from the beginning, leaves a strong impact and, before too long, develops into the type of suspenseful product with which Hitchcock has always been identified.&quot;

Film critic Manny Farber wrote in February 14, 1944&#x27;s &quot;The New Republic&quot;: &quot;&quot;Lifeboat&quot; is eminently theatrical, but not because it is dialogue-heavy and confined to a single set. Its theatricality lies in the fact that it is entirely an arrangement in which the audience does not, as it should, seem outside of the event, but is the main person in the boat … The event that is supposed to be taking place falls away from conviction at every point and for this reason: it simply is not taking place in a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean but right in front of you on a stage … The characters are no longer driven and provoked by the situation but by the audience.&quot;

While most critics applauded the film, two influential reviewers and columnists, including Dorothy Thompson and Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, saw the film as denigrating the American and British characters while glorifying the German. Crowther wrote that &quot;the Nazis, with some cutting here and there, could turn &quot;Lifeboat&quot; into a whiplash against the &#x27;decadent democracies.&#x27; And it is questionable whether such a picture, with such a theme, is judicious at this time.&quot; In Truffaut&#x27;s 1967 book-length interview &quot;Hitchcock/Truffaut&quot;, Hitchcock paraphrased Thompson&#x27;s criticism as &quot;Dorothy Thompson gave the film ten days to get out of town.&quot;

Such commentary caused Steinbeck, who had previously been criticized because of his handling of German characters in &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot;, to publicly dissociate himself from the film, to denounce Hitchcock and Swerling&#x27;s treatment of his material, and to request that his name not be used by Fox in connection with the presentation of the film. Crowther responded by detailing the differences between Steinbeck&#x27;s novella and the film as released, accusing the film&#x27;s creators of &quot;pre-empting&quot; Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;creative authority&quot;.

Hitchcock responded to the criticism by explaining that the film&#x27;s moral was that the Allies needed to stop bickering and work together to win the war, and he defended the portrayal of the German character, saying, &quot;I always respect my villain, build[ing] him into a redoubtable character that will make my hero or thesis more admirable in defeating him or it.&quot; Bankhead backed him up in an interview in which she said that the director &quot;wanted to teach an important lesson. He wanted to say that you can&#x27;t trust the enemy... in &quot;Lifeboat&quot; you see clearly that you can&#x27;t trust a Nazi, no matter how nice he seems to be.&quot; She also called the criticism leveled at the film that it was too pro-Axis &quot;moronic&quot;.

Criticism was also leveled at the script for its portrayal of the African-American character Joe as &quot;too stereotypical&quot;. Actor Canada Lee testified that he had attempted to round out the character by revising dialogue, primarily eliminating repeated &quot;yessir&quot;s and &quot;nossir&quot;s that sounded subservient, and cutting some actions. The overseas section of the Office of War Information&#x27;s Bureau of Motion Pictures reviewed the picture and for these and other racial characterizations recommended that &quot;Lifeboat&quot; not be distributed overseas. An NAACP critique of the film condemned Lee&#x27;s role unequivocally although praising his performance. However the &quot;Baltimore Afro-American&quot;&#x27;s review, while commenting on shortcomings regarding the character, praised both the performance and its role depiction. Historian Rebecca Sklaroff, while writing that Joe&#x27;s role was more &quot;tokenistic&quot; than black roles in the wartime films &quot;Sahara&quot; and &quot;Bataan&quot;, noted that Joe was also depicted as compassionate, dependable, and heroic, the only cast member stepping forward to disarm the second German sailor rescued.

Critics praised the film&#x27;s acting, directing, and cinematography and noted with appreciation the lack of background music once the film proper begins. Still, studio executives, under pressure because of the controversies, decided to give the film a limited release instead of the wide release most of Hitchcock&#x27;s films received. Advertising for the film was also reduced, which resulted in the film&#x27;s poor box office showing when it was released in 1944.

===Awards and honors===
==Adaptations==
NBC broadcast a one-hour radio adaptation of the film on &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot; on November 16, 1950. Hitchcock directed, and Bankhead reprised her role from the film. The cast also featured Jeff Chandler and Sheldon Leonard.

In 1993, &quot;Lifeboat&quot; was remade as a science fiction TV movie under the title &quot;Lifepod&quot;. Moving the action from a lifeboat to a spaceship&#x27;s escape capsule in the year 2169, the remake starred Ron Silver, who also directed, Robert Loggia, and CCH Pounder. The film was aired on the Fox channel in the United States. The film credited Hitchcock and Harry Sylvester for the story.

<doc id="264872" wikidata="Q13658" url="?curid=264872" title="Mimaropa">
<text>Mimaropa (officially stylized in all caps), officially the Southwestern Tagalog Region (), is an administrative region in the Philippines. The name is an acronym combination of its constituent provinces: Mindoro (divided into Occidental Mindoro and Oriental Mindoro), Marinduque, Romblon, and Palawan. It is the only region in the country outside the Visayas that has no land border with another region. 

The region was part of the now-defunct Southern Tagalog region until May 17, 2002. On May 23, 2005, Palawan and the highly urbanized city of Puerto Princesa were moved to the region of Western Visayas by Executive Order No. 429. However, on August 19, 2005, President Arroyo issued Administrative Order No. 129 to put in abeyance Executive Order No. 429 pending a review. On July 17, 2016, Republic Act No. 10879 formally established the Southwestern Tagalog Region to be known as Mimaropa, discontinuing the Region IV-B designation; however, no boundary changes were involved.

Calapan is Mimaropa&#x27;s regional center while the highly-urbanized city of Puerto Princesa is the most populous in the region. However, most regional government offices such as the Department of Public Works and Highways and the Department of Budget and Management are in Quezon City, Metro Manila, because Quezon City was the regional capital of Southern Tagalog.

== History ==
Mimaropa, together with Calabarzon, were officially created with the partitioning of Southern Tagalog (Region IV) into the two regions on May 17, 2002, with the issuance of &quot;Executive Order No. 103&quot; by then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo; for the purpose of promoting efficiency in the government, accelerating social and economic development and improving public services in the provinces covered. Region IV-B was designated as Mimaropa, which stands for the island provinces belonging to the Southern Tagalog region—Mindoro (Oriental and Occidental), Marinduque, Romblon and Palawan. Region IV-A was designated as Calabarzon. Marinduque was a sub-province of Quezon, at that time known as Tayabas; it became independent province in 1920. Quezon is now part of Calabarzon. Romblon was a sub-province of Capiz &amp; was part of Western Visayas. When President Ferdinand Marcos enacted &quot;Presidential Decree No. 1&quot;, which organized the provinces into 11 regions as part of Marcos&#x27; Integrated Reorganization Plan, Romblon was transferred from Western Visayas to Southern Tagalog.

On May 23, 2005, &quot;Executive Order 429&quot; was issued, moving the province of Palawan to the region of Western Visayas, designating Region IV-B as &quot;Mimaro&quot;. However, Palawan residents criticized the move, citing a lack of consultation, with most residents in Puerto Princesa and nearly all municipalities preferring to stay with Region IV-B. Consequently, &quot;Administrative Order No. 129&quot; was issued on August 19, 2005, to address this backlash. This order directed the abeyance of &quot;Executive Order 429&quot; pending the approval of an implementation plan for the orderly transfer of Palawan from Mimaropa to Region VI.

The 2010 Philippine Census of Population reported the region&#x27;s name as &quot;Mimaropa&quot; and included Palawan as part of the region. , it is not clear whether the transfer of Palawan to Western Visayas is still considered pending by the Philippine government. , the National Statistical Coordinating Board of the Philippines continued to list Palawan province as part of the Mimaropa region.

On July 17, 2016, &quot;Republic Act No. 10879&quot; formally established the &quot;Southwestern Tagalog Region&quot; to be known as the Mimaropa Region. This involved no boundary changes but was in effect merely a renaming and discontinuation of the &quot;Region IV-B&quot; designation.

== Economy ==

Poverty Incidence of 
In 2007, Mimaropa&#x27;s economy surged by 9.4%, making it the fastest growing region in the country in that year. It was aided by robust growth in the industrial sector which grew by 19.1% from -6.1% in 2006. Mimaropa experienced a big slowdown in 2006, posting a decelerated growth of 2.3% from a 6.4% increase in 2005. This resulted mainly from the slump in the industry sector, which shrunk by 5.4% in 2006 from its 10.8% increase in 2005.

The agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector, which contributed 42.1% to the total regional economy, grew by 9.1% in 2006, accelerating from 3.2% the previous year. The higher production of rice, maize, other crops, livestock and fishery resulted in the accelerated growth in the total agriculture and fishery sector.

The industry sector, which contributed 38.3% to the region&#x27;s total economy, was the second largest contributor next to agriculture. Its decline of 5.4% was largely attributed to the decrease in the mining and quarrying sub-sector, which went down by 15.4% due to the reduced production of natural gas in Palawan. Mining and quarrying contributed 16.6% to the total regional economy. The positive growth in the electricity and water, construction and manufacturing sub-sectors were not able to compensate to the drop in the mining and quarrying sub-sector.

The service sector, on the other hand, posted an accelerated growth of 5.1%, which was attributed to the increase in the TCS, finance, private services, government services and trade sub-sectors, which managed to post accelerated growths of 6.0%, 5.5%, 5.1%, 5.1% and 4.7%, respectively. The other sub-sector, however, had a decelerated growth due to the slowdown in the ownership of dwelling.

== Tourism ==
There are many scenic spots in Mimaropa. Some of them are the Bathala Cave, Balanacan Bay, and Tres Reyes Islands in the province of Marinduque; White Island in Mindoro; Fort San Andres, Mount Guiting-Guiting, and Bonbon Beach in Romblon; and the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park and El Nido Marine Reserve Park in Palawan.

<doc id="264874" wikidata="Q527006" url="?curid=264874" title="Nemean Games">
<text>The Nemean Games ( or Νέμεια) were one of the four Panhellenic Games of Ancient Greece, and were held at Nemea every two years (or every third).

With the Isthmian Games, the Nemean Games were held both the year before and the year after the Ancient Olympic Games and the Pythian Games in the third year of the Olympiad cycle. Like the Olympic Games, they were held in honour of Zeus. They were said to have been founded by Heracles after he defeated the Nemean lion; another myth said that they originated as the funeral games of a child named Opheltes. However, they are known to have existed only since the 6th century BC (from 573 BC, or earlier). The winners received a wreath of wild celery leaves from the city of Argos.

==History==
The various legends concerning its origin are related in the &quot;argumenta&quot; of the scholiasts to the &quot;Nemea&quot; of Pindar, with which may be compared Pausanias, and Apollodorus. All these legends, however, agree in stating that the Nemean Games were originally instituted by the Seven against Thebes in commemoration of the death of Opheltes, later called Archemorus. When the Seven arrived at Nemea and were very thirsty, they met Hypsipile, who was carrying Opheltes (Greek: Ὀφέλτης), the child of the priest of Zeus and of a queen named Eurydice. While his nurse Hypsipyle showed the heroes the way to the nearest well, she left the child behind lying in a meadow, which during her absence was killed by a dragon. When the Seven on their return saw the accident, they slew the dragon and instituted funeral games to be held every third year. Other legends attribute the institution of the Nemean Games to Heracles, after he had slain the Nemean lion. The alternative tradition was that he had either revived the ancient games, or at least introduced the alteration by which they were from this time celebrated in honor of Zeus.

Pindar stated that the games were afterwards celebrated in honor of Zeus. Initially, the games were warlike in character and only warriors and their sons were allowed to take part in them. Later on, however, they were thrown open to all the Greeks. The games took place in a grove between Cleonae and Phlius. The various events, according to Apollodorus, were horse-racing, running in armour in the stadium, wrestling, chariot racing and discus, boxing, spear-throwing and archery, as well as musical contests. The prize given to the victors was originally a wreath of olive branches, but afterwards a wreath of green celery. The location of the Nemean Games varied at different times among Cleonae, Corinth, and Argos. They were sometimes called the Cleonaean Games after the first location. The judges who awarded the prizes were dressed in black robes, and an instance of their justice, when the Argives presided, is recorded by Pausanias.

Regarding the time of year the Nemean Games were celebrated, the scholiast on Pindar merely states that they were held on the 12th of the month of Panemos, though in another passage he makes a statement which contradicts this assertion. Pausanias speaks of winter Nemean Games, and distinguishes them from others which were held in summer. It seems that for a time the celebration of the Nemean Games was neglected, and that they were revived in Olympiad 51.4 (573 BC), from which time Eusebius dates the first Nemead. Henceforth, they were for a long time celebrated regularly twice in every Olympiad, both at the start of every second Olympic year in the winter, and soon after the start of every fourth Olympic year in the summer. About the time of the Battle of Marathon it became customary in Argolis to reckon according to Nemeads.

The Hellenistic Stadion (with a vaulted entrance tunnel dated to about 320 BC, according to Stephen G. Miller, 2001, pp. 90–93) has recently been discovered. The Games, under Macedonian control, returned to Nemea at the end of the 4th century BC. In 208 BC, Philip of Macedonia was honored by the Argives with the presidency at the Nemean games, and Quintius Flamininus proclaimed at the Nemean Games the freedom of the Argives. The emperor Hadrian restored the horse-racing of boys at the Nemean Games, which had fallen into disuse. But after his time they do not seem to have been much longer celebrated, as they are no longer mentioned by any of the writers of the subsequent period.

==The program of the Nemean Games==

=== The Gymnic Part ===

The participants to these parts competed in the nude.
* The Stadion – A foot race which was about 178 meters at Nemea.
* The Diaulos – Twice the Stadion foot race, about 355 meters at Nemea.
* The Hippios – Twice the Diaulos foot race, about 710 meters at Nemea.
* The Dolichos – A long distance running race. The exact length of this race is uncertain; it could have been 7, 10, 20 or 24 times round the stadium.
* The Hoplitodromos – A Diaulos foot race with the competitors wearing helmets, a bronze covered aspis and initially metal greaves.
* The Pyx – A boxing-like contest. In order to protect themselves and to do more damage the opponents bound their hands and wrists with long leather strips. The first to be knocked out or to acknowledge defeat would lose.
* The Pankration – A blend of boxing and wrestling with very few rules. Again, the first to be knocked out or to acknowledge defeat would lose.
* The Pale – Wrestling from an upright position. The goal was to throw the opponent on the ground three times.
* The Pentathlon – This pentathlon consisted of the stadion, a game of wrestling or pale, javelin-throwing, discus-throwing and long-jump.

===The equestrian part===

Taking place in a hippodrome, these were the only events where women could take part, not because they were allowed to ride, but because it was the owner of a horse or chariot rather than the rider or charioteer who was considered the victor. This even allowed cities to participate by funding equestrian teams.

So far no ancient hippodrome has been recovered, so the given lengths are assumptions.

* The Tethrippon chariots, with four horses racing a distance of 8400 meters or 5.25 miles.
* The Synoris chariots, with two horses racing a distance of 5600 meters or 3.5 miles.
* The Kélēs, a horseback race over a distance of 4200 meters or 2.5 miles.

==Modern Nemean Games re-enactment==
The Society for the Revival of the Nemean Games was founded in 1994, after more than 20 years of archaeological excavation at Nemea. The contemporary games are more of a re-enactment than an actual sporting event, held every four years since 1996, are a form of popular education in history, as well as a counter to the commercialism of the modern Olympics. Races are organized according to age and gender, open to international participation. No medals are awarded, only crowns of palm branches and wild celery.

In 2008, some 600 people clad in tunics raced barefoot in the ruins of the ancient stadium on 21 June. Two races were staged for the runners aged from 10 to 80, one of and the other of . The most striking feature of this attempt was the revival of the Hoplitodromos race.

The last Nemead was held on 11 and 12 June 2016.

<doc id="264875" wikidata="Q1925730" url="?curid=264875" title="1979 oil crisis">
<text>A drop in oil production in the wake of the Iranian revolution led to an energy crisis in 1979. Although the global oil supply only decreased by approximately four percent, the oil markets&#x27; reaction raised the price of crude oil drastically over the next 12 months, more than doubling it to . The sudden increase in price was connected with fuel shortages similar to the 1973 oil crisis.

In 1980, following the onset of the Iran–Iraq War, oil production in Iran fell drastically. Iraq&#x27;s oil production also dropped significantly, triggering economic recessions worldwide. Oil prices did not return to pre-crisis levels until the mid-1980s.

Oil prices after 1980 began a steady decline over the next 20 years, except for a brief uptick during the Gulf War, which then reached a 60% fall-off in the 1990s. Mexico, Nigeria, and Venezuela&#x27;s major oil exporters expanded their production during this time. The Soviet Union became the largest oil producer in the world, and oil from the North Sea and Alaska flooded the market.

==Iran==
In November 1978, a strike consisting of 37,000 workers at Iran&#x27;s nationalized oil refineries reduced production from per day to about . Foreign workers left the country. However, by bringing navy personnel into crude oil production operations, the government fixed short-term disruptions and by end of November the output came back to almost normal level. 

On January 16, 1979, the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his wife, Farah Pahlavi, left Iran at the behest of Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar, who sought to calm the situation. After the departure of the Shah, Ayatollah Khomeini became the new leader of Iran.

==Effects==
===Other OPEC members===
The rise in oil prices benefited a few members of the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC), which made record profits. Under the new Iranian government, oil exports later resumed but production was inconsistent and at a lower volume, further raising prices. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations, under the presidency of Mana Al Otaiba, increased production to offset most of the decline, and by early 1979 the overall loss in worldwide production was roughly four percent.

The war between Iran and Iraq in 1980 caused a further 7 percent drop in worldwide production and OPEC production was surpassed by other exporters such as the United States as its member nations were divided amongst themselves. Saudi Arabia, a &quot;swing producer&quot;, tried to gain back the market share after 1985, increasing production and causing downward pressure on prices, making high-cost oil production facilities less profitable.

===United States===
The oil crisis had a mixed impact on the United States. Richard Nixon had imposed price controls on domestic oil as a result of the 1973 oil crisis. Since then, gasoline price controls had been repealed, but those on domestic oil remained.

The Jimmy Carter administration began a phased deregulation of oil prices on April 5, 1979, when the average price of crude oil was US. Starting with the Iranian revolution, the price of crude oil rose to over the next 12 months (its all-time highest real price until March 3, 2008). Deregulating domestic oil price controls allowed U.S. oil output to rise sharply from the large Prudhoe Bay fields, while oil imports fell sharply.

Although not directly related, the near-disaster at Three Mile Island on March 28, 1979, also increased anxiety about energy policy and availability. Due to memories of the oil shortage in 1973, motorists soon began panic buying, and long lines appeared at gas stations, as they had six years earlier. The average vehicle of the time consumed between two and three liters (about 0.5–0.8 gallons) of gasoline an hour while idling, and it was estimated that Americans wasted up to of oil per day idling their engines in the lines at gas stations.

The amount of oil sold in the United States in 1979 was only 3.5 percent less than the record set for oil sold the previous year. A telephone poll of 1,600 American adults conducted by the Associated Press and NBC News and released in early May 1979 found that only 37 percent of Americans thought the energy shortages were real, nine percent were not sure, and 54 percent thought the energy shortages were a hoax.

Many politicians proposed gas rationing. One such proponent was Harry Hughes, Governor of Maryland, who proposed odd-even rationing (only people with an odd-numbered license plate could purchase gas on an odd-numbered day), as was used during the 1973 Oil Crisis. Several states implemented odd-even gas rationing, including California, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, and Texas. Coupons for gasoline rationing were printed but were never actually used during the 1979 crisis.

On July 15, 1979, President Carter outlined his plans to reduce oil imports and improve energy efficiency in his &quot;Crisis of Confidence&quot; speech (sometimes known as the &quot;malaise&quot; speech). In the speech, Carter encouraged citizens to do what they could to reduce their use of energy. He had already installed water tank heating solar panels on the roof of the White House and a wood-burning stove in the living quarters. However, the panels were removed in 1986, reportedly for roof maintenance, during the administration of his successor, Ronald Reagan.

A speech Carter gave in April 1977 argued the oil crisis was &quot;the moral equivalent of war&quot;. In November 1979, Iranian revolutionaries seized the American Embassy, and Carter imposed an embargo on Iranian oil. In January 1980, he issued the Carter Doctrine, declaring: &quot;An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States&quot;. Additionally, as part of his administration&#x27;s efforts at deregulation, Carter proposed removing price controls that had been imposed by the Richard Nixon administration before the 1973 crisis. Carter agreed to remove price controls in phases. They were finally fully dismantled in 1981 under Reagan. Carter also said he would impose a windfall profit tax on oil companies. While the regulated price of domestic oil was kept to $6 a barrel, the world market price was $30.

In 1980, the U.S. government established the Synthetic Fuels Corporation to produce an alternative to imported fossil fuels.

When the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil increased 250 percent between 1978 and 1980, the oil-producing areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Colorado, Wyoming, and Alaska began experiencing an economic boom and population inflows.

According to one study, individuals who were between the ages of 15 and 18 during the 1979 oil crisis were substantially less likely to use cars once they were in their mid-30s.

===Other oil-consuming nations===

In response to the high oil prices of the 1970s, industrial nations took steps to reduce their dependence on the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil. Electric utilities worldwide switched from oil to coal, natural gas, or nuclear power. National governments initiated multibillion-dollar research programs to develop alternatives to oil and commercial exploration developed major non-OPEC oilfields in Siberia, Alaska, North Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. By 1986, daily worldwide demand for oil dropped by 5 million barrels but, non-OPEC production rose by an even-larger amount. Consequently, OPEC&#x27;s market share reduced from 50 percent in 1979 to 29 percent in 1985.

===Automobile fuel economy===

At the time, Detroit&#x27;s &quot;Big Three&quot; automakers (Ford, Chrysler, GM) were marketing downsized full-sized automobiles like the Chevrolet Caprice, the Ford LTD Crown Victoria and the Dodge St. Regis which met the CAFE fuel economy mandates passed in 1978. Detroit&#x27;s response to the growing popularity of imported compacts like the Toyota Corolla and the Volkswagen Rabbit was the Chevrolet Citation and the Ford Fairmont. Ford replaced the Ford Pinto with the Ford Escort and Chrysler, on the verge of bankruptcy, introduced the Dodge Aries K. GM was having unfavorable market reactions to the Citation and introduced the Chevrolet Corsica and Chevrolet Beretta in 1987 which sold better. GM also replaced the Chevrolet Monza, introducing the 1982 Chevrolet Cavalier which was better received. Ford experienced a similar market rejection of the Fairmont and introduced the front-wheel-drive Ford Tempo in 1984.

Detroit was not well prepared for the sudden rise in fuel prices, and imported brands (primarily the Asian models, which were mass-marketed and had a lower manufacturing cost as opposed to British and West German brands). Moreover, the rising value of the Deutsche mark and British pound resulted in the transition to the rise of Japanese manufacturers as they were able to export their product from Japan at a lower cost, resulting in profitable gains (despite accusations of price dumping), and were now more widely available in North America and developing a loyal customer base. 

A year after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Japanese manufacturers surpassed Detroit&#x27;s production totals, becoming first in the world. Indeed, the share of Japanese cars in U.S. auto purchases rose from 9 percent in 1976 to 21 percent in 1980. Japanese exports would later displace the automotive market once dominated by lower-tier European manufacturers (Renault, Fiat, Opel, Peugeot, MG, Triumph, Citroen). Some would declare bankruptcy (e.g. Triumph, Simca) or withdraw from the U.S. market, especially in the wake of grey market automobiles or the inability of the vehicle to meet DOT requirements (from emission requirements to automotive lighting). Many imported brands utilized fuel-saving technologies such as fuel injection and multi-valve engines over the common use of carburetors. The overall fuel economy of cars in the United States increased from about in 1979 to by 1985 and by 1990. This was one factor leading to the subsequent 1980s oil glut.

<text>Southern Tagalog (), designated as Region IV, was an administrative region in the Philippines that comprised the current regions of Calabarzon and Mimaropa, the province of Aurora in Central Luzon, and most of the National Capital Region. It was the largest region in the Philippines in terms of both land area and population. After its partition on May 17, 2002, Southern Tagalog continues to exist as a cultural-geographical region.

The region was bordered by Manila Bay and the South China Sea to the west, Lamon Bay and the Bicol Region to the east, the Tayabas Bay, Sibuyan Sea, and Balabac Strait, where it shared a maritime border with Sabah, Malaysia, to the south, and Central Luzon to the north.

== History ==
Southern Tagalog was the largest region in the Philippines in terms of both land area and population. The &quot;2000 Census of Population and Housin&quot;g showed the region having a total of 11,793,655 people, which comprised 15.42 percent of the 76.5 million population of the country at that time.

Quezon City was the designated regional center of Southern Tagalog, but Lucena was the former Government Center of Southern Tagalog, and is still host to most of the branches of governmental agencies, businesses, banks, and service facilities in the region.

The former region covered the area where many reside; the two other majority-Tagalophone regions are the National Capital Region and Central Luzon.

On September 7, 1946, &quot;Republic Act No. 14&quot; changed the name &quot;Tayabas&quot; to &quot;Quezon&quot;; both Quezon City &amp; Quezon Province were named in honor of Manuel L. Quezon, the Commonwealth president who was born in Baler, which was one of the province&#x27;s towns.

In June 1951, the northern area of Quezon (specifically, the towns of Baler, Casiguran, Dilasag, Dingalan, Dinalungan, Dipaculao, Maria Aurora and San Luis) was made into the sub-province of Aurora; during that time, only Baler, Casiguran, Dipaculao, and Maria Aurora existed yet, wherein the 2 latter towns were separated from Baler. Aurora was named of the president&#x27;s wife, Aurora Quezon, also a native of Baler. One obvious reason for creating the sub-province was the area&#x27;s isolation from the rest of Quezon Province: there were no direct links to the rest of the province and much of the terrain was mountainous and heavily forested, which made the area relatively isolated, and its distance from Quezon&#x27;s capital Lucena. Aurora was finally separated from Quezon as an independent province in 1979, and added to Southern Tagalog.

=== Partitioning ===
Southern Tagalog was divided into Calabarzon and Mimaropa, upon the issuance of Executive Order No. 103, dated May 17, 2002, by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Additionally, the province of Aurora was moved to Region III (Central Luzon), the physical location of the province. The complete separation of Aurora from Quezon and its transfer to Central Luzon fulfilled the long-held wishes and prayers of the residents of the original municipalities of Baler and Casiguran, allowing them to be truly independent from Quezon Province for the first time and to restore the original La Pampanga from the Spanish era. Many residents and government leaders of Aurora, however, rejected the executive order that transferred Aurora to Central Luzon, as Aurora maintains strong historical and cultural connections to the rest of Southern Tagalog, particularly Quezon Province, thus also of the memory of Manuel Quezon, and with that, Aurora residents self-identified with Quezon; but Aurora&#x27;s transfer to Central Luzon means that geographically, the province is more accessible by land from Nueva Ecija and of course, San Fernando, Pampanga, the regional capital of Central Luzon.

== Administrative divisions ==
=== Provinces ===
Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur, which are under Bicol Region, are sometimes considered part of Southern Tagalog recently, as there has been a language shift in recent years to Tagalog, which is more common native language, from being historically Bikol-speaking provinces.

=== Cities ===
Southern Tagalog region had 13 chartered cities prior to its partition.
* Antipolo
* Batangas City
* Calapan
* Calamba
* Cavite City
* Lipa
* Lucena
* Puerto Princesa
* Quezon City
* San Pablo
* Tagaytay
* Tanauan
* Trece Martires
Cities that were recently added after the partition (all of these are located in Southern Tagalog mainland or Calabarzon):
*Bacoor
*Biñan
*Cabuyao
*Calaca
*Carmona

<text>Hartley William Shawcross, Baron Shawcross, (4 February 1902 – 10 July 2003), known from 1945 to 1959 as Sir Hartley Shawcross, was an English barrister and Labour politician who served as the lead British prosecutor at the Nuremberg War Crimes tribunal. He also served as Britain&#x27;s principal delegate to the United Nations immediately after the Second World War and as Attorney General for England.

== Early life ==
Hartley William Shawcross was born in Giessen, Germany, elder son of British parents, John Shawcross, MA (Oxon) (1871–1966) and Hilda Constance (died 1942), daughter of G. Asser. At this time, his father was teaching English at Giessen University. His younger brother, Christopher (1905–1973), was a barrister and Labour party politician. Shawcross attended Dulwich College, the London School of Economics and the University of Geneva and read for the Bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn, where he won first-class honours.

==Career==
During his initial career as a barrister, Shawcross was part of the legal team hired by the colliery owners at the inquiry into the Gresford Colliery disaster in 1934, Stafford Cripps in counterpart representing the miners&#x27; union.

He joined the Labour Party and was Member of Parliament for St Helens, Lancashire, from 1945 to 1958, being appointed to be Attorney General in 1945 until 1951. In 1946, when debating the repeal of laws against trade unions in the House of Commons, Shawcross allegedly said &quot;We are the masters now&quot;, a phrase that came to haunt him.

He was knighted in 1945 upon his appointment as Attorney-General and named Chief Prosecutor for the United Kingdom at the Nuremberg trials.

=== Nuremberg Trials ===
Shawcross&#x27;s advocacy before the Nuremberg Trial was passionate. His most famous line was: &quot;There comes a point when a man must refuse to answer to his leader if he is also to answer to his own conscience&quot;.

He avoided the crusading style of American, Soviet, and French prosecutors. Shawcross&#x27;s opening speech, which lasted two days, 26 and 27 July 1946, sought to undermine any belief that the Nuremberg Trials were &quot;victor&#x27;s justice&quot; in the sense of being revenge exacted against defeated foes. He focused on the rule of law and demonstrated that the laws that the defendants had broken, expressed in international treaties and agreements, were those to which prewar Germany had been a party. In his closing speech, he ridiculed any notion that any of the defendants could have remained ignorant of Aktion T4, extermination of thousands of Germans because they were old or mentally ill. He used the same argument in respect of millions of other people &quot;annihilated in the gas chambers or by shooting&quot; and maintained that each of the 22 defendants was a party to &quot;common murder in its most ruthless forms&quot;.

===Attorney-General and UN Factotum===
As Attorney-General, he prosecuted William Joyce (&quot;Lord Haw-Haw&quot;) and John Amery for treason, Klaus Fuchs and Alan Nunn May for giving atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, and John George Haigh, &#x27;the acid bath murderer&#x27;.

From 1945 to 1949, he was Britain&#x27;s principal delegate to the United Nations and was involved in the official adoption of the Flag of the United Nations in 1946, but he was recalled in 1948 to lead for the government&#x27;s interest at the Lynskey tribunal. In 1951, he briefly served as President of the Board of Trade until the Labour government&#x27;s defeat in the election of that year.

Shawcross lent his name to a Parliamentary principle, in a defence of his conduct regarding an illegal strike, that the Attorney-General &quot;is not to be put, and is not put, under pressure by his colleagues in the matter&quot; of whether or not to establish criminal proceedings.

In 1951, he replaced Harold Wilson as President of the Board of Trade after Wilson and the Bevanite members of the Cabinet resigned in protest of the introduction of prescription charges for the National Health Service by Chancellor of the Exchequer Hugh Gaitskell.

===Return to opposition===
Shawcross ended his law career in 1951, the same year as the defeat of the second Attlee ministry. He was expected to become a Conservative, earning him the nickname &quot;Sir Shortly Floorcross&quot;, but instead he remained true to his Labour roots.

During the committal hearing for the suspected serial killer doctor John Bodkin Adams in January 1957, he was seen dining with the defendant&#x27;s suspected lover, Sir Roland Gwynne (Mayor of Eastbourne from 1929–31), and Lord Goddard, the Lord Chief Justice, at a hotel in Lewes. The meeting added to concerns that the Adams trial was the subject of concerted judicial and political interference.

Shawcross resigned from Parliament in 1958, saying he was tired of party politics.

===Elevation===
Shawcross was made one of Britain&#x27;s first life peers on 14 February 1959 as Baron Shawcross, of Friston in the County of Sussex, and sat in the House of Lords as a crossbencher.

=== Defending press freedom ===
In 1961, he was appointed the chairman of the second Royal Commission on the Press. In 1967 he became one of the directors of &quot;The Times&quot; responsible for ensuring its editorial independence. He resigned on being appointed chairman of the Press Council in 1974. 

From 1974 to 1978, he was chairman of the Press Council and is described as &quot;forthright in his condemnation both of journalists who committed excesses and of proprietors who profited from them&quot; and as a &quot;doughty defender of press freedom&quot;. In October 1974, he poured scorn on a Labour Party pamphlet that recommended the application of &quot;internal democracy&quot; to editorial policy, saying &quot;This means that... there would be some sort of committee consisting at the best of a mixture of van drivers, press operators, electricians and the rest, with no doubt a few journalists, but more probably composed of trade union officials, to deal with editorial policy.&quot;

In 1983, Shawcross chaired a Tribunal of Enquiry to handle a protest over the outcome of the 1983 British Saloon Car Championship.

=== Chancellor of the University of Sussex ===
From 1965 to 1985 Shawcross was Chancellor of the University of Sussex.

==Later years==
In the 1974 New Year Honours, Lord Shawcross was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE).

Shawcross held a number of company directorships including with EMI, Rank Hovis MacDougall, Caffyns Motors Ltd, Morgan et Cie SA, and Times Newspapers, and chairman of Upjohn &amp; Co Ltd. He had served as chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s Commission on Unethical Practices and of Morgan Guaranty Trust Company&#x27;s Internal Advisory Council.

In the 1980s, Shawcross was sympathetic towards Margaret Thatcher and the Social Democratic Party, but never joined another political party.

==Philanthropy and awards==
In 1957, he was among a group of eminent British lawyers who founded JUSTICE, the human rights and law reform organisation and he became its first chairman, a position he held until 1972. He was instrumental in the foundation of the University of Sussex and served as chancellor of the university from 1965–85.

He was the President of the charity Attend (then National Association of Leagues of Hospital Friends) from 1962–72.

== Personal life ==

Lord Shawcross was married three times. His first wife, Alberta Rosita Shyvers (m. 24 May 1924), suffered from multiple sclerosis and died by suicide on 30 December 1943.

His second wife, Joan Winifred Mather (m. 21 September 1944), died in a riding accident on the Sussex Downs on 26 January 1974. They had three children: the author and historian William Shawcross, Hume Shawcross and Dr Joanna Shawcross.

At the age of 95, he married Susanne Monique (née Jansen), formerly wife of Gerald B. Huiskamp, on 18 April 1997 in Gibraltar. Lady Shawcross died on 2 March 2013. His family opposed the marriage out of concern for Shawcross&#x27; declining abilities in old age; they had him placed under the supervision of the Court of Protection.

Shawcross was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron and the Royal Cornwall Yacht Club. From 1947 to 1960 he was the owner of &quot;Vanity V&quot;, a 12-metre class racing yacht designed by William Fife to the Third International Rule, built in 1936, which he kept at his home in Cornwall. A later skipper of the boat, John Crill, recalls being told that Lord Shawcross, &quot;when the election was due in about 1951, had &quot;Vanity V&quot; repainted with a vast &#x27;Vote Labour&#x27; banner all the way along her topsides&quot;.

Lord Shawcross died on 10 July 2003 at home at Cowbeech, East Sussex, at the age of 101 and is buried in the churchyard of St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Jevington, East Sussex.

<text>Isthmian Games or Isthmia (Ancient Greek: Ἴσθμια) were one of the Panhellenic Games of Ancient Greece, and were named after the Isthmus of Corinth, where they were held. As with the Nemean Games, the Isthmian Games were held both the year before and the year after the Olympic Games (the second and fourth years of an Olympiad), while the Pythian Games were held in the third year of the Olympiad cycle.

== Origin ==
The Games were reputed to have originated as funeral games for Melicertes (also known as Palaemon), instituted by Sisyphus, legendary founder and king of Corinth, who discovered the dead body and buried it subsequently on the Isthmus. In Roman times, Melicertes was worshipped in the region. Another likely later myth held that Theseus, legendary king of Athens, expanded Melicertes&#x27; funeral games from a closed nightly rite into fully-fledged athletic-games event which was dedicated to Poseidon, open to all Greeks, and was at a suitable level of advancement and popularity to rival those in Olympia, which were founded by Heracles. Theseus arranged with the Corinthians for any Athenian visitors to the Isthmian games to be granted the privilege of front seats (&quot;prohedria&quot;, Ancient Greek προεδρία). Another version states that Kypselos, tyrant of Corinth in the 7th century BC, returned to the Games their old splendour.

==Organization==
The first Isthmian Games were held in 582 BC.

The festival included athletic and musical competitions to honor the god Poseidon, and was held in the spring of the second and fourth years of each Olympiad at Poseidon&#x27;s rural sanctuary on the Isthmus of Corinth, the small neck of land that connects the Peloponnesian peninsula with Central Greece. Since it was easy to reach both from land and sea, the Isthmia was a natural meeting place.

This festival was open to all Greeks and the Isthmian games were especially popular with Athenians, though the Eleans boycotted them. The Isthmian games were used by many as a forum for political propaganda.

These were stephanitic games (i.e., with a crown as prize) and at least until the 5th century BC (Pindar&#x27;s time) the winners of the Isthmian games received a wreath of celery; 
later, the wreath was altered such that it consisted of pine leaves
 and called Isthmian pine (Ἰσθμικὴ πίτυς). Victors could also be honored with a statue or an ode. Besides these prizes of honor, the city of Athens awarded victorious Athenians with 100 drachmas.

From 228 BC or 229 BC onwards the Romans were allowed to take part in the games. In 196 BC Titus Quinctius Flamininus used the occasion of the games to proclaim the freedom of the Greek states from Macedonian hegemony. According to Appian&#x27;s account: 

Since the games&#x27; inception, Corinth had always been in control of them. When Corinth was destroyed by the Romans in 146 BC, the Isthmian games continued, but were now administered by Sicyon. Corinth was rebuilt by Caesar in 44 BC, and recovered ownership of the Games shortly thereafter, but they were then held in Corinth. They did not return to the Isthmus until AD 42 or 43. Libanius mentions the continuation of cultic activities at the Isthmus into the middle of the 4th century, and the games probably continued at least until the end of that century. The circumstances of their demise are unknown. Imperial pressure against pagan rituals was heightened at the end of the 4th century, but some polytheistic cult practices certainly continued at Corinth into the 6th century.

==Contests==
The games were the same as those in Olympia including wrestling, pancration, and horse racing. Among other competitions were:
* Chariot races, men only
* Pankration, men only
* Wrestling, men only
* Musical and poetical contests, in which women were allowed to compete.
* Boxing, men only.

The commentator Papagalos also records the first instance of οισοληνειν (oisoleven), an early form of snooker played with painted pottery balls

==Famous victors==

* Kleitomachos of Thebes won wrestling, boxing and pankration on the same day.
* Plato is said to have competed at the games in wrestling.

==Isthmian truce==
Before the Games began, a truce was declared by Corinth to grant athletes safe passage through Greece. In 412 BC, even though Athens and Corinth were at war, the Athenians were invited to the games as usual.

<text>A pentathlon is a contest featuring five events. The name is derived from Greek: combining the words &quot;pente&quot; (five) and -&quot;athlon&quot; (competition) (). The first pentathlon was documented in Ancient Greece and was part of the Ancient Olympic Games. Five events were contested over one day for the Ancient Olympic pentathlon, starting with the long jump, javelin throwing, and discus throwing, followed by the &quot;stadion&quot; (a short foot race) and wrestling. Pentathletes were considered to be among the most skilled athletes, and their training was often part of military service—each of the five events in the pentathlon was thought to be useful in war or battle.

With the revival of the Olympic Games in the modern era, the pentathlon returned in two formats. The athletics pentathlon was a modern variation on the original events, with a competition over five track and field events. The modern pentathlon, invented by Pierre de Coubertin (father of the Modern Olympics), was a variation on the military aspect of the Ancient pentathlon. It focused on the skills required by a late-19th-century soldier, with competitions in shooting, swimming, fencing, equestrianism, and cross country running. A prominent aspect of modern pentathlons is the point system, whereby each competitor is awarded a certain number of points based on their performance in each specific event. The overall winner is the competitor with the highest point total at the end of the five pentathlon events.

==History==

===Ancient Olympics===
The first documented pentathlon occurred in 708 BC in Ancient Greece at the Ancient Olympic Games, and was also held at the other Panhellenic Games. The name derives from Greek words for &quot;five competitions&quot;. The event proved popular and lent itself to illustrations on ancient Greek pottery. It also featured in Greek mythology; the mythical hero Perseus fulfilled an oracle&#x27;s prophecy by accidentally killing Acrisius with a discus while competing in the pentathlon. In mythology, Jason is credited with inventing the pentathlon, and he declared his friend Peleus the first winner of the event, after his victory in the wrestling. The wide variety of skills needed to compete meant that pentathletes were held in high esteem as physical specimens: in &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, Aristotle remarked &quot;a body capable of enduring all efforts, either of the racecourse or of bodily strength ... This is why the athletes in the pentathlon are most beautiful&quot;. 1912 Olympic gold medal winner Ferdinand Bie referenced that story after completing the events.

By the 77th Olympics, the athletic event was usually ordered into the &quot;triagmos&quot; (long jump, javelin throw, and discus throw), followed by the &quot;stadion&quot; foot race, and wrestling as the final event. Unlike modern athletics, the first three events did not appear as individual events outside the pentathlon format. Other variations on the format included boxing or pankration instead of the stadion race.

===Modern Olympics===

The pentathlon made its return as an Olympic event at the 1906 Games in Athens, consisting of a standing long jump, discus throw (ancient style), javelin throw, 192-metre run, and a Greco-Roman wrestling match.

The 1912 Summer Olympics saw the introduction of two new types of the pentathlon. The first was the classic pentathlon, an athletics competition which was a variation on the Ancient Olympic pentathlon, comprising the long jump, javelin throw, 200 metres, discus throw, and a 1500 metres race. The competition featured at the 1920 and 1924 Summer Olympics but was discontinued thereafter.

The second type of pentathlon introduced at the 1912 Olympics was the modern pentathlon, a sport invented by Pierre de Coubertin and modeled on the Ancient Olympic ideal of testing skills required by a soldier. Working from the template of a 19th-century soldier fighting behind enemy lines, the contest comprises épée fencing, pistol shooting, freestyle swimming, show jumping on the back of an unfamiliar horse allocated in a draw, and a cross country run. Competitors score points based on their performance in each event and the winner is the one with the highest total points at the end of the fifth competition. The men&#x27;s individual competition has been held at every Olympic Games since 1912, and a women&#x27;s competition was introduced in the 2000 Summer Olympics. Also, a men&#x27;s team event was held between 1952 and 1992.

An athletics pentathlon event for women was introduced at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, featuring the 80 metres hurdles, shot put and high jump on the first day, with long jump, and 200 metres on the second day. The 1976 and 1980 Summer Olympics versions changed the format from 80 to 100 metres hurdles, and 200 to 800 metres. The event was discontinued in 1984, when it was replaced by the heptathlon.

==Styles==

===Ancient pentathlon===


The format for the Ancient Olympic pentathlon varied in schedule and events. The &quot;stadion&quot; event was occasionally replaced by boxing or pankration. The discus throw was competed in the Greek style—the athletes would throw the discus from a raised platform. The long jump was aided by the use of &quot;halteres&quot;; stone weights which athletes would hold and swing to help propel themselves further. The &quot;stadion&quot; race was generally around 190 metres long, the length of the Stadium at Olympia.
===Modern pentathlon===


The sport is governed by the International Modern Pentathlon Union (UIPM) and, in addition to the contests held at the Olympics, a world championships is held in non-Olympic years.

For much of its history, the modern pentathlon remained largely unchanged from the original events featured at the 1912 Olympics. However, in the 2000 Summer Olympics the 300 m freestyle swimming race was reduced to 200 m, and the 4000 m cross country race was reduced to 3000 m.

The fencing (épée) event is the only one in which competitors face off directly against each other, with each competitor having to fence each of the opponents once. The épée duel lasts up to one minute; the winner is the first to land a hit, but the bout is drawn if the minute elapses with both opponents unscathed. The riding discipline involves show jumping over a 350–450 m course with 12 to 15 obstacles. Competitors are paired with horses in a draw 20 minutes before the start of the event. The shooting discipline involves using a 4.5 mm air pistol in the standing position from 10 metres distance at a stationary target.

However, in 2009 the UIPM proposed that the running and shooting events should be combined into a single event, similar to the biathlon. Some commentators have suggested that the sport should be renamed as a &quot;tetrathlon&quot;, given the number of competitions, but the sporting body emphasizes that five distinct skills are still applied in the course of the competition. The &#x27;combined&#x27; event is the last event of the pentathlon program, and consists of a continuous shoot-run race. Competitors are ordered at the start line by their cumulative point standing from the three previous event, making the race a chase event for overall placing. As of 2012, the format of the combined event is a 4x800 run loop, with a 10m air pistol component at the beginning of each loop. Competitors have to hit the target 5 times before continuing on to the next run loop. In 2011, the UIPM introduced laser shooting in the combined event to replace traditional pellets.

===Athletics pentathlons===

Given that there are a large number of track and field events, there have been numerous pentathlons featuring a variety of events.

====Classic pentathlon====

The Classic pentathlon was contested in Olympic Games from 1906 through 1924. In the 1912 Olympic Games, Jim Thorpe won both the pentathlon and decathlon titles, only to have them later taken away for professionalism. His titles were restored some 70 years later by the International Olympic Committee.

In the United States, this version of the pentathlon was contested as an Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) championship event until 1978. With the breakup of the AAU, as a result of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978, track and field came under separate leadership. The Athletics Congress (TAC) (now USA Track &amp; Field), chose to drop the pentathlon, as well as several other multi-event contests, as national championship events at the senior level, although it is recognised at the 11–12 and 13–14 age groups as national championship events. The last National AAU Pentathlon Championships was held in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1978.

Pentathlons are used at high school athletics and in other one-day meetings for time constraints. The events are separated by age and sex, but the five events are the same for both – sprint hurdles, long jump, shot put, high jump, and middle distance run. At the U12 level, the sprint hurdles are 80 metres (30&quot;), the shot put weighs six pounds, and the middle-distance run being 1500 metres for boys and 800 metres for girls. At the U14 level, the sprint hurdles are 100 metres (33&quot; for boys, 30&quot; for girls), and the shot put is 4 kg (about three pounds heavier) for boys.

====Indoor pentathlon====
For each event, points are given based on a standard. These points can be calculated at the USATF website. The indoor pentathlon is held over a one-day period. Each athlete completes one event at the same time, then there is a 30-minute break until the next event.

 Currently, Nafissatou Thiam holds the world record of 5055 points, which occurred on March 3, 2023 in Istanbul, Turkey.

The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the world governing body for athletics, has a women&#x27;s pentathlon contest at the World Indoor Championships in Athletics. The athletes competing in the format are usually heptathlon specialists, as the events are very similar to that combined event. Until 2000, men also contested the indoor pentathlon. 

The men&#x27;s pentathlon was added to the IAAF list of indoor world records in 1990, at the same time as the men&#x27;s heptathlon.

====Paralympic pentathlon====


The events contested at the Summer Paralympics varied according to whether the athletes were visually impaired, amputees or spinal disorders. The events shown on the right are taken from the schedule for the 2004 Summer Paralympics. No pentathlon events were held in the 2012 Summer Paralympics.

===Military events===
====Military and naval pentathlon====
By the middle of the 20th century, many of the skills in the modern pentathlon were becoming less relevant to the modern soldier (such as fencing and horse riding). A French army officer, Captain Henri Debrus, adapted a military training method into a five event competition. The five events are: shooting, obstacle running, obstacle swimming, throwing, and cross country running.

The sport is governed by the International Military Sports Council (CISM) and an annual world championships has been held since 1950.

====Aeronautical pentathlon====

Aeronautical pentathlon is a sporting event at some multi-sport events, such as the Military World Games. Despite the name, the sport has six events: shooting, fencing, orienteering, basketball skills, obstacle course, and swimming. The idea is to prepare athletes for evading enemy soldiers. It is generally only participated by military Air Forces, and its first appearance at the Military World Games was in 2010.

<text>Stadion or stade () was an ancient running event and also the building in which it took place, as part of Panhellenic Games including the Ancient Olympic Games. The event was one of the five major Pentathlon events and the premier event of the &quot;gymnikos agon&quot; (γυμνικὸς ἀγών &quot;nude competition&quot;).

From the years 776 to 724 BC, the &quot;stadion&quot; was the only event at the Olympic Games. The victor (the first of whom was Coroebus of Elis) gave his name to the entire four-year Olympiad, allowing modern knowledge of nearly all of them.

The &quot;stadion&quot; was named after the building in which it took place. This word became &quot;stadium&quot; in Latin, which became the English &quot;stadium&quot;. The race also gave its name to the unit of length, the stadion. There were other types of running events, but the &quot;stadion&quot; was the most prestigious; the winner was often considered to be the winner of an entire Games. Though a separate event, the &quot;stadion&quot; was also part of the ancient Pentathlon.

At the Olympic Games, the &quot;stadion&quot; (building) was big enough for 20 competitors, and the race was a sprint, but the original stadion track in Olympia measures approximately . The race began with a trumpet blow, with officials (the ἀγωνοθέται &quot;agonothetai&quot;) at the start to make sure there were no false starts. There were also officials at the end to decide on a winner and to make sure no one had cheated. If the officials decided there was a tie, the race would be re-run. Runners started the race from a standing position, probably with their arms stretched out in front of them, instead of starting in a crouch like modern runners. They ran naked on a packed earth track. By the fifth century, the track was marked by a stone-starting line, the &quot;balbis&quot;. Advancements in this stone starting block led to it having a set of double grooves ( apart) in which the runner placed his toes. The design of these grooves were intended to give the runner leverage for his start.

<doc id="264917" wikidata="Q11829" url="?curid=264917" title="Hansel and Gretel">
<text>&quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; (; ) is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm and published in 1812 as part of &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot; (KHM 15). 

Hansel and Gretel are siblings who are abandoned in a forest and fall into the hands of a witch who lives in a house made of bread, cake, and sugar. The witch, who has cannibalistic intentions, intends to fatten Hansel before eventually eating him. However, Gretel saves her brother by pushing the witch into her own oven, killing her, and escaping with the witch&#x27;s treasure.

Set in medieval Germany, &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; has been adapted into various media, including the opera by Engelbert Humperdinck, which was first performed in 1893.

== Origin ==
=== Sources ===
Although Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm credited &quot;various tales from Hesse&quot; (the region where they lived) as their source, scholars have argued that the brothers heard the story in 1809 from the family of Wilhelm&#x27;s friend and future wife, Dortchen Wild, and partly from other sources. A handwritten note in the Grimms&#x27; personal copy of the first edition reveals that in 1813 Wild contributed to the children&#x27;s verse answer to the witch, &quot;The wind, the wind,/ The heavenly child,&quot; which rhymes in German: &quot;Der Wind, der Wind,/ Das himmlische Kind.&quot;

According to folklorist Jack Zipes, the tale emerged in the Late Middle Ages Germany (1250–1500). Shortly after this period, close written variants like Martin Montanus&#x27; &quot;Garten Gesellschaft&quot; (1590) began to appear. Scholar Christine Goldberg argues that the episode of the paths marked with stones and crumbs, already found in the French &quot;Finette Cendron&quot; and &quot;Hop-o&#x27;-My-Thumb&quot; (1697), represents &quot;an elaboration of the motif of the thread that Ariadne gives Theseus to use to get out of the Minoan labyrinth&quot;. A house made of confectionery is also found in a 14th-century manuscript about the Land of Cockayne.

=== Editions ===

From the pre-publication manuscript of 1810 (&quot;Das Brüderchen und das Schwesterchen&quot;) to the sixth edition of &quot;Kinder- und Hausmärchen&quot; (&quot;Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tales&quot;) in 1850, the Brothers Grimm made several alterations to the story, which progressively gained in length, psychological motivation, and visual imagery, but also became more Christian in tone, shifting the blame for abandonment from a mother to a stepmother associated with the witch.

In the original edition of the tale, the woodcutter&#x27;s wife is the children&#x27;s biological mother, but she was also called &quot;stepmother&quot; from the 4th edition (1840). The Brothers Grimm indeed introduced the word &quot;stepmother&quot;, but retained &quot;mother&quot; in some passages. Even their final version in the 7th edition (1857) remains unclear about her role, for it refers to the woodcutter&#x27;s wife twice as &quot;the mother&quot; and once as &quot;the stepmother&quot;.

The sequence where the duck helps them across the river is also a later addition. In some later versions, the mother died from unknown causes, left the family, or remained with the husband at the end of the story. In the 1810 pre-publication manuscript, the children were called &quot;Little Brother&quot; and &quot;Little Sister&quot;, then named Hänsel and Gretel in the first edition (1812). Wilhelm Grimm also adulterated the text with Alsatian dialects, &quot;re-appropriated&quot; from August Stöber&#x27;s Alsatian version (1842) in order to give the tale a more &quot;folksy&quot; tone.

Goldberg notes that although &quot;there is no doubt that the Grimms&#x27; &quot;Hänsel und Gretel&quot; was pieced together, it was, however, pieced together from traditional elements,&quot; and its previous narrators themselves had been &quot;piecing this little tale together with other traditional motifs for centuries.&quot; For instance, the duck helping the children cross the river may be the remnant of an old traditional motif in the folktale complex that was reintroduced by the Grimms in later editions.

==Plot==
 Hansel and Gretel are the young children of a poor woodcutter. When a famine settles over the land, the woodcutter&#x27;s second wife tells him to take the children into the woods and leave them there to fend for themselves. The woodcutter opposes the plan, but his wife repeats her demands until he reluctantly agrees. They are unaware that in the children&#x27;s bedroom, Hansel and Gretel have overheard them. After the parents have gone to bed, Hansel sneaks out of the house and gathers as many shiny white pebbles as he can, then returns to his room, reassuring Gretel that God will not forsake them.

The next day, the children&#x27;s stepmother gives them small pieces of bread before she and their father take them into the woods. As the family walks deeper, Hansel leaves a trail of white pebbles. After their parents abandon them, the children stay in the woods until night falls and the moonlight reveals the white pebbles shining in the dark. The children then safely follow the trail back home, much to their stepmother&#x27;s rage. Once again, provisions become scarce and the stepmother angrily orders her husband to take the children further into the woods and leave them there. Hansel attempts to gather more pebbles, but finds his stepmother has locked the door.
The following morning, the children&#x27;s stepmother gives them smaller pieces of bread, before she and their father take them back into the woods. As the family treks, Hansel leaves a trail of bread crumbs for him and Gretel to follow back home. However, after they are once again abandoned, the children find that the birds have eaten the crumbs and they are lost in the woods. After three days of wandering, the children follow a dove to a clearing in the woods, and discover a cottage with bread walls, a cake roof, and sugar windows. Hungry and tired, the children begin to eat the house, when the door opens and the elderly woman that lives there emerges and takes the children inside, giving them delicious food to eat and soft beds to sleep in. What the children do not know is that their kind hostess is an evil witch who had built the bread house to lure them inside so she can cook and eat them.

The next morning, the witch locks Hansel in a stable and enslaves Gretel. The witch feeds Hansel regularly to fatten him up, but serves Gretel nothing but crab shells. The witch then tries to touch Hansel&#x27;s finger to see how fat he has become, but he cleverly offers a thin bone he found in the cage. As the witch&#x27;s eyes are too weak to notice the deception, she is fooled into thinking Hansel is still too thin for her to eat. After four weeks of this, the witch grows impatient and decides to eat Hansel anyway.

She prepares the oven for Hansel, but decides she is hungry enough to eat Gretel, too. She coaxes Gretel to the open oven and asks her to lean over in front of it to see if the fire is hot enough. Gretel, sensing the witch&#x27;s intent, pretends she does not understand what the witch means. Frustrated, the witch demonstrates, and Gretel instantly shoves her into the hot oven, slams and bolts the door shut, leaving the witch to burn to death. Gretel frees Hansel from the stable and the pair discover boxes full of pearls and precious stones. Putting the jewels into their pockets, the children set off for home. A white duck (or swan in some versions) ferries them across an expanse of water, and at home they find only their father; his wife had died from an unknown cause. The children&#x27;s father had spent all his days missing them, and is delighted to see them safe and sound.

With the witch&#x27;s wealth, the children and their father all live happily ever after.

== Variants ==

Folklorists Iona and Peter Opie indicate that &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; belongs to a group of European tales especially popular in the Baltic regions, about children outwitting ogres into whose hands they have involuntarily fallen.

=== ATU 327A tales ===
&quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; is the prototype for the fairy tales of the type Aarne–Thompson–Uther (ATU) 327A. In particular, Gretel&#x27;s pretence of not understanding how to test the oven (&quot;Show Me How&quot;) is characteristic of 327A, although it also appears traditionally in other sub-types of ATU 327. As argued by Stith Thompson, the simplicity of the tale may explain its spread into several traditions all over the world.

A closely similar version is &quot;Finette Cendron&quot;, published by Marie-Catherine d&#x27;Aulnoy in 1697, which depicts an impoverished king and queen deliberately losing their three daughters three times in the wilderness. The cleverest of the girls, Finette, initially manages to bring them home following a line of thread she unwound as they travelled. On the second journey she leaves a trail of ashes, and on the third, a trail of peas, but these are eaten by pigeons. The little girls then go to the mansion of a hag, who lives with her husband the ogre. Finette heats the oven and asks the ogre to test it with his tongue, so that he falls in and is incinerated. Thereafter, Finette cuts off the hag&#x27;s head. The sisters remain in the ogre&#x27;s house, and the rest of the tale relates the story of &quot;Cinderella&quot;.

In the Russian &quot;Vasilisa the Beautiful&quot;, the stepmother likewise sends her hated stepdaughter into the forest to borrow a light from her sister, who turns out to be Baba Yaga, a cannibalistic witch. Besides highlighting the endangerment of children (as well as their own cleverness), the tales have in common a preoccupation with eating and with hurting children: the mother or stepmother wants to avoid hunger, and the witch lures children to eat her house of candy so that she can then eat them.

In a variant from Flanders, &quot;The Sugar-Candy House&quot;, siblings Jan and Jannette get lost in the woods and sight a hut made of confectionery in the distance. When they approach, a giant wolf named Garon jumps out of the window and chases them to a river bank. Sister and brother ask a pair of ducks to help them cross the river and escape the wolf. Garon threatens the ducks to carry him over, to no avail; he then tries to cross by swimming. He sinks and surfaces three times, but disappears in the water on the fourth try. The story seems to contain the &quot;child/wind&quot; rhyming scheme of the German tale.

In a French fairy tale, &quot;La Cabane au Toit de Fromage&quot; (&quot;The Hut with the Roof made of Cheese&quot;), the brother is the hero who deceives the witch and locks her up in the oven.

In the first Puerto Rican variant of &quot;The Orphaned Children&quot;, the brother pushes the witch into the oven.

Other folk tales of ATU 327A type include the French &quot;The Lost Children&quot;, published by Antoinette Bon in 1887, or the Moravian &quot;Old Gruel&quot;, edited by Maria Kosch in 1899.

=== The Children and the Ogre (ATU 327) ===
Structural comparisons can also be made with other tales of ATU 327 type (&quot;The Children and the Ogre&quot;), which is not a simple fairy tale type but rather a &quot;folktale complex with interconnected subdivisions&quot; depicting a child (or children) falling under the power of an ogre, then escaping by their clever tricks.

In ATU 327B (&quot;The Brothers and the Ogre&quot;), a group of siblings come to the house of an ogre, who intends to kill them in their beds but the youngest of the children exchanges the visitors with the ogre&#x27;s offspring, and the villain kills his own children by mistake. They are chased by the ogre, but the siblings eventually manage to come back home safely. Stith Thompson points out the great similarity of the tales types ATU 327A and ATU 327B and concludes that &quot;it is quite impossible to disentangle the two tales&quot;.

ATU 327C (&quot;The Devil [Witch] Carries the Hero Home in a Sack&quot;) depicts a witch or an ogre catching a boy in a sack. As the villain&#x27;s daughter is preparing to kill him, the boy asks her to show him how he should arrange himself; when she does so, he kills her. Later on, he kills the witch and goes back home with her treasure. In ATU 327D (&quot;The Kiddlekaddlekar&quot;), children are discovered by an ogre in his house. He intends to hang them, but the girl pretends not to understand how to do it, so the ogre hangs himself to show her. He promises his kiddlekaddlekar (a magic cart) and treasure in exchange for his liberation; they set him free but the ogre chases them. The children eventually manage to kill him and escape safely. In ATU 327F (&quot;The Witch and the Fisher Boy&quot;), a witch lures a boy and catches him. When the witch&#x27;s daughter tries to bake the child, he pushes her into the oven. The witch then returns home and eats her own daughter. She eventually tries to fell the tree in which the boy is hiding, but birds fly away with him.

=== Further comparisons ===
The initial episode, which depicts children deliberately lost in the forest by their unloving parents, can be compared with many previous stories: Montanus&#x27;s &quot;The Little Earth-Cow&quot; (1557), Basile&#x27;s &quot;Ninnillo and Nennella&quot; (1635), Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy&#x27;s &quot;Finette Cendron&quot; (1697), or Perrault&#x27;s &quot;Hop-o&#x27;-My-Thumb&quot; (1697). The motif of the trail that fails to lead the protagonists back home is also common to &quot;Ninnillo and Nennella&quot;, &quot;Finette Cendron&quot; and &quot;Hop-o&#x27;-My-Thumb&quot;, and the Brothers Grimm identified the latter as a parallel story.

Finally, ATU 327 tales share a similar structure with ATU 313 (&quot;Sweetheart Roland&quot;, &quot;Foundling-Bird&quot;, &quot;Okerlo&quot;) in that one or more protagonists (specifically children in ATU 327) come into the domain of a malevolent supernatural figure and escape from it. Folklorist Joseph Jacobs, commenting on his reconstructed proto-form of the tale (&quot;Johnnie and Grizzle&quot;), noticed the &quot;contamination&quot; of the tale with the story of &quot;The Master Maid&quot;, later classified as ATU 313. ATU 327A tales are also often combined with stories of ATU 450 (&quot;Little Brother and Sister&quot;), in which children run away from an abusive stepmother.

== Analysis ==
According to folklorist Jack Zipes, the tale celebrates the symbolic order of the patriarchal home, seen as a haven protected from the dangerous characters that threaten the lives of children outside, while it systematically denigrates the adult female characters, which are seemingly intertwined between each other. The death of the mother or stepmother soon after the children kill the witch suggests that they may be metaphorically the same woman. Zipes also argues that the importance of the tale in the European oral and literary tradition may be explained by the theme of child abandonment and abuse. Due to famines and lack of birth control, it was common in medieval Europe to abandon unwanted children in front of churches or in the forest. The death of the mother during childbirth sometimes led to tensions after remarriage, and Zipes proposes that it may have played a role in the emergence of the motif of the wicked stepmother.

Linguist and folklorist Edward Vajda has proposed that these stories represent the remnant of a coming-of-age, rite of passage tale extant in Proto-Indo-European society. Psychologist Bruno Bettelheim argues that the main motif revolves around dependence, oral greed, and destructive desires that children must learn to overcome, after they arrive home &quot;purged of their oral fixations&quot;. Others have stressed the satisfying psychological effects of the children vanquishing the witch or realizing the death of their wicked stepmother.

== Cultural legacy ==
===Stage and musical theatre===
The fairy tale has spawned a multitude of adaptations for the stage, with one of the most notable being Engelbert Humperdinck&#x27;s opera &quot;Hänsel und Gretel&quot;. It is primarily based upon the Grimm&#x27;s version, although it omits the deliberate abandonment of the children, and is notable for kickstarting the adaptations depicting the witch&#x27;s house as being made of gingerbread and confectionary instead of plain bread.

A contemporary reimagining of the story, Mátti Kovler&#x27;s musical fairytale Ami &amp; Tami, was produced in Israel and the United States and subsequently released as a symphonic album.

=== Literature ===
Several writers have drawn inspiration from the tale, such as Robert Coover in &quot;The Gingerbread House&quot; (&quot;Pricksongs and Descants&quot;, 1969), Anne Sexton in &quot;Transformations&quot; (1971), Garrison Keillor in &quot;My Stepmother, Myself&quot; in &quot;Happy to Be Here&quot; (1982), and Emma Donoghue in &quot;A Tale of the Cottage&quot; (&quot;Kissing the Witch&quot;, 1997). Adam Gidwitz&#x27;s 2010 children&#x27;s book &quot;A Tale Dark &amp; Grimm&quot; and its sequels &quot;In a Glass Grimmly&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Grimm Conclusion&quot; (2013) are loosely based on the tale and show the siblings meeting characters from other fairy tales.
Terry Pratchett mentions gingerbread cottages in several of his books, mainly where a witch had turned wicked and &#x27;started to cackle&#x27;, with the gingerbread house being a stage in a person&#x27;s increasing levels of insanity. In &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;, the wizard Rincewind and Twoflower are led by a gnome into one such building after the death of the witch and warned to be careful of the doormat, as it is made of candy floss. In 2014, Neil Gaiman wrote an expanded retelling of &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, with illustrations by Lorenzo Mattotti.

<text>The Crassulaceae (, from Latin &quot;crassus&quot;, thick), also known as the crassulas, the stonecrops or the orpine family, are a diverse family of dicotyledon angiosperms primarily characterized by succulent leaves and a form of photosynthesis known as crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), in which plants photosynthesize in the daytime and exchange gases during the cooler temperatures of the night. The blossoms of crassulas generally have five floral parts. Crassulaceae are usually herbaceous, though there are some subshrubs, and relatively few trees or aquatic plants. 

The Crassulaceae is a medium-sized, monophyletic family in the core eudicots clade, along with the order Saxifragales, whose diversity has made infrafamilial classification very difficult. The family includes approximately 1,400 species and 34–35 genera—depending on the circumscription of the genus &quot;Sedum&quot;—distributed over three subfamilies. Members of the Crassulaceae are found worldwide, though are mostly concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Africa (where the most species are found). They are adapted to thrive in typically dry, arid (hot or cold) areas where water may be scarce, and richer, organic substrates may be at a minimum or nonexistent. The &quot;Sempervivum&quot; (houseleeks) of Central and Southern Europe, or the &quot;Orostachys&quot; (dunce-caps) of Asia, for example, grow in rocky crevices at higher elevations, where soil is at a minimum but precipitation, sun exposure, and winds may be intense; these plants have thus adapted to absorb water by having succulent leaves, despite living often on slopes or near-vertical cliff faces, from which water typically drains quickly. Their roots are adhesive and grip to any rock, dirt, wood or other surface they come into contact with, while also gleaning minerals from said material. Seedlings that may sprout near more permanent sources of water, such as pooling rainwater or seeps, may experience rot or discoloration over time, and not survive.

Crassulaceae are mainly perennial, and have huge global economic importance as collectible specimens, and as indoor and outdoor garden plants. Many species in the family, especially of the African genera, have highly unusual (for plants) and otherworldly appearances, often with interesting textures (fuzzy, hairy, spiky, scaly) or curious nodules or growths, all of which are typically the result of environmental adaptations, such as &quot;fuzzy&quot; &quot;Kalanchoe tomentosa&quot; utilizing its hairs as a sunscreen. Apart from some sensitive species, most are quite hardy, typically needing only minimal care. For every alien-looking species, there are just as many others with a more &quot;conventional&quot;, rosette growth habit, something reflected in many common names, such as &#x27;Black Rose&#x27;, another name for the common &quot;Aeonium arboreum&quot; var. &#x27;Swartzkopf&#x27;. 

Well-known genera and species include the many forms of &quot;Crassula ovata&quot; (&#x27;Jade&#x27;, &#x27;Money Plant&#x27; or &#x27;Friendship Tree&#x27;), &quot;Kalanchoe blossfeldiana&quot; (florists&#x27; or supermarket-kalanchoe); &quot;Cotyledon&quot;, such as &#x27;Chalk Fingers&#x27; and &#x27;Pig&#x27;s Ear&#x27;, &quot;Sempervivum&quot; such as cobweb houseleek (or hen-and-chicks) and &quot;S. calcareum&quot;, and &quot;Aeonium&quot; such as &quot;A. haworthii&quot; (and its popular variegate &#x27;Kiwi&#x27;), &quot;A. arboreum, canariense, urbicum&quot;; &quot;Monanthes&quot;, &quot;Umbilicus&quot; (pennywort), &quot;Bryophyllum&quot;, &quot;Echeveria&quot;, &quot;Sedum&quot; and &quot;Dudleya&quot;.
== Description ==

General: Crassulaceae is a family of morphologically diverse terrestrial perennial, rarely annual or hapaxanthic (flowering once in a lifetime), flowering plants that demonstrate xerophytic adaptations, with thick succulent leaves, a thick waxy cuticle and Crassulacean acid metabolism. Crassulaceae are generally herbaceous but there are some subshrubs, and relatively few treelike, epiphytic (growing on surface of plants), scandent (vine like) or aquatic plants. Most species are herbaceous leaf succulents, with regular 5 part (pentamerous or fivemerous) flowers, isomerous free carpels and one or two whorls of stamens.

Vegetative: Stems are sometimes succulent, as may also be the underground caudices (rootstock), and may form rhizomes or corms. Bulbils may form along the stem or leaf margins. The leaf arrangement is opposite and decussate or alternate and spiral, and they are frequently aggregated into rosettes. The leaf shape is simple (rarely pinnate) and usually entire, or crenate to broadly lobed, sometimes dentate or more deeply incised, glabrous (smooth) or tomentose. In cross section the leaf blades are flat or round. They may be sessile or petiolate. Stipules are absent. New plants often form easily from vegetative parts that fall off the parent plant.

Reproductive: The inflorescence is usually terminal to lateral with many-flowered thyrses of cymes, less commonly spikes, racemes or panicles, rarely few to single flowered and axillary. The inflorescence is often many-branched and bracteate. The flower clusters are red, yellow, or white.

The flowers are often apopetalous (separate corolla segments), pentamerous (five-parted), actinomorphic (radially symmetrical), except for the zygomorphic &quot;Tylecodon grandiflorus&quot;, with one to two whorls of 4–20 sepals that are usually as many as or twice as many as the number of petals and two whorls of stamens, five in each whorl (i.e. as many as or twice the number of petals), with their filaments either free or fused to the petals at the base and sometimes unequal. Anthers are basifixed and open lengthwise. The flowers are bisexual, less commonly unisexual (more or less dioecious). Ovaries superior to partially inferior, with carpels equal to the number of petals, each forming a single locule, superior, free or almost so, basally with a small to conspicuous basal nectary scale, gradually tapering to a short to long style with few to many ovules. The fruit is usually capsular with dehiscent follicles, opening along the carpal suture and many seeded. The seeds are small (1.5–3 mm), smooth, elongate, papillate to longitudinally ridged, and generally brownish.

However, a number of genera (e.g. Sempervivum, Aeonium) are polymerous (3-32), have basally fused or partially fused corolla segments, where the petals may form a corolla tube of varying length (e.g. &quot;Kalanchoe&quot;, &quot;Cotyledon&quot;), or have only a single whorl of 5 stamens (e.g. &quot;Crassula&quot;, &quot;Tillaea&quot;), while &quot;Sedum&quot; includes much of the morphological diversity within the family as a whole. Although the typical number of floral parts is four or five, a number of genera, such as &quot;Sempervivum&quot; and &quot;Jovibarba&quot;, demonstrate polymery (at least ten or greater parts).

=== Genome ===

The genome of &quot;Kalanchoë fedtschenkoi&quot; has been sequenced as a model to study the evolution of Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM).

Chromosome numbers are highly variable. The original base chromosome number is x=8, decreasing to 7 in Crassula. In Sedoideae, the base number increases to 9 in the Kalanchoe clade, but &quot;Kalanchoe&quot; have x=17 or 18 (or a multiple), and is probably of polyploid origin, derived from a tetraploid &quot;Cotyledon&quot; like taxon. In the Telephium &quot;sensu&quot; Hart clade the base number has increased to 12 and higher. Of the subclades within Telephium, the first (Hylotelephium &quot;sensu&quot; Thiede &amp; Eggli: &quot;Hylotelphium&quot;, &quot;Orostachys&quot; and &quot;Sinocrassula&quot;) has x=12, and of the Rhodiola clade &quot;Phedimus&quot; has x=16 and &quot;Umbilcus&quot; x=24, representing another episode of polyploidy. Within Sempervivum, &quot;Sedum&quot; series &quot;Rupestre&quot; (&quot;Petrosedum&quot;) has x=28. Within the Leucosedum, most taxa are diploid, with 2x=12, 14 but includes two subclades, one with x=6 or 7, the other x=6, but a few have 14 or 16. Acre includes a wide variety of chromosome numbers from x=6 to 270, and occasionally larger and displays widespread polyploidy. Aeonium includes some &quot;Sedum&quot; species with x=8, while the remaining taxa are x=18. The core of this clade is probably polyploid from an ancestor with x=8.

=== Phytochemistry ===

Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM photosynthesis) is named after the family, because the pathway was first discovered in crassulacean plants. It is one of the few families that still has CAM as an active, photosynthetic pathway, and is unique in which all its members are known to possess CAM.

== Taxonomy ==

Originally described by Saint-Hilaire (1805) as Crassuleae, and therefore has his name as the botanical authority. Authority has also, at times, been given to De Candolle (DC), who first used the term &quot;Crassulaceae&quot; in 1815. He later placed the family among the Dicotyledons.

One of the most complete treatments was Alwin Berger&#x27;s revision in 1930. At that time the family comprised about 1,500 species, distributed over six subfamilies and 33 genera. Circumscription of the family has remained relatively stable, with the exception of the placement of the genus &quot;Penthorum&quot; and &quot;Tetracarpaea&quot;, which has at times been placed either in their own monogeneric family, Penthoraceae and Tetracarpaeaceae, or in the Saxifragaceae. When Penthorum and Tetracarpaea were separated from Crassulaceae, they became a natural monophyletic group. Some later authors, such as Cronquist, included only 900 species. Thiede and Eggli (2007), in their treatment of the family, describe 34 genera with about 1,410 species. The size of the genera varies considerably, from &quot;Sedum&quot;, the largest with 300–500 species, to the smallest, which are monotypic. Estimates of the number of species has varied between 1500 (Berger 1930) and 900 (Cronquist 1981).

Molecular phylogenetics has shown that morphological characters and chromosome numbers are so labile in the family, with rampant polyploidy and aneuploidy, that they cannot be used reliably to infer evolution, even at low taxonomic levels, with few exceptions. For instance &quot;Prometheum&quot; and &quot;Rosularia&quot; have been segregated from &quot;Sedum&quot; by their basic chromosome numbers.

Crassulaceae is a medium size monophyletic grouping within the core eudicots. Originally considered a primitive member of the Rosidae, in the order Saxifragales, it is now placed, with that order as a superrosid under the classification system of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. There, the Saxifragales are a sister group to the rosids. Classification within the family is difficult and complex because many of the species hybridize readily, both in the wild and in cultivation, and the family is morphologically, cytologically and geographically diverse. As a result, generic boundaries have been considered unclear with frequent intergradation of characteristics between taxa, which may represent recurrent adaptation to xeric habitats.

=== Phylogeny ===

Crassulaceae has been considered a part of the order Saxifragales by most modern authors, including Cronquist (1981), Takhtajan (1987), and Thorne (1992), based on phenotypic features, but subsequently confirmed by molecular methods. The place of Crassulaceae within Saxifragales has varied over time, as molecular data accumulates. The number of families within Saxifragales varies depending on the delimitation of individual families. Here, 14 families are shown in a cladogram, according to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website, situating Crassulaceae as sister to the Haloragaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;, and thus forming one of two subclades of the core Saxifragales.

==== Biogeography and evolution ====

Crassulaceae evolved approximately 100–60 million years ago in southern Africa with the two most basal phylogenetic branches (Crassula, Kalanchoe) representing the predominantly southern African members. Other sources suggest that Crassulaceae evolved approximately 70 million years ago together with Haloragaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot; (Penthoraceae, Haloragaceae). The family is considered to have had a gradual evolution, with a basal split between Crassuloideae and the rest of the family (Kalanchoideae, Sempervivoideae). The Sempervivoideae subsequently dispersed north to the Mediterranean region, and from there to Eastern Europe and Asia (Sempervivum and Leucosedum clades), with multiple groups spreading over the three continents of the Northern Hemisphere. Two lineages from the European Crassulaceae eventually dispersed to North America and underwent subsequent diversification. The Aeonium clade dispersed from northern Africa to adjacent Macaronesia.

Distinct centers of speciation developed in Macaronesia (Aeonium clade), Mexico (&quot;Sedum&quot; and Echeverioideae in clade 7), and southeastern Asia (&quot;Sedum sarmentosum&quot;, and &quot;S. morissonensis&quot; in Acre clade). On arrival in the Northern hemisphere the Sempervivoideae reached its greatest diversity. Conversely, few representatives of the Crassulaceae occur in South America and Australia. &quot;Sedum&quot; species are found in most of these regions, generally grouped with genera endemic to that region. For instance the North African &quot;S. jaccardianum&quot; and &quot;S. modestum&quot; (Aeonium) are a sister group to the endemic Macaronesian species in that clade.
The Macaronesian archipelago appears to have been reached by Crassulaceae at least three times. Once by the ancestor
of &quot;Aeonium&quot; and &quot;Monanthes&quot;, most likely from the Western Mediterranean region, with the closest extant relatives of these two genera (&quot;Sedum caeruleum&quot;, &quot;S. pubescens&quot;), coming from this region (Aeonium clade). The second migration was by an ancestor of a clade of three &quot;Sedum&quot; species (&quot;S. nudum&quot;, &quot;S. lancerotense&quot; and &quot;S. fusiforme&quot; (Acre clade)), which appear to have originated in Mexico. The third occurrence likely involved the ancestor of a lineage within the genus &quot;Umbilicus&quot; (Rhodiola clade). The Macronesian flora include three genera from the Sempervivoideae, &quot;Aeonium&quot;, &quot;Aichryson&quot; and &quot;Monanthes&quot; (Aeonium clade), together with several &quot;Sedum&quot; spp. and one species of &quot;Umbilicus&quot; (Rhodiola). North America was reached at least twice, once by an ancestor of &quot;Parvisedum&quot; and &quot;Dudleya&quot;, and once by a subclade of Acre. For a mapping of morphological features and biogeography on the phylogenetic tree, see Fig. 3.

Chromosome numbers have played a limited role in elucidating evolution, but suggest a core of x=8, with subsequent polyploidy. For a mapping of chromosome numbers on the phylogenetic tree, see Fig. 4.

==== History ====

When Carl Linnaeus published his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753 only a few genera, included in the modern circumscription of Crassulaceae were described; the type genus &quot;Crassula&quot; (10 species), &quot;Tillaea&quot; (3), &quot;Cotyledon&quot; (6), &quot;Sempervivum&quot; (6), &quot;Rhodiola&quot; (1) and &quot;Sedum&quot; (15). By 1777, &quot;Rhodiola&quot; had been submerged into &quot;Sedum&quot;, only to be separated again in the twentieth century.

While the family can fairly easily be recognised, identifying its constituent genera has been far more problematic. For an extensive history of subfamily Sedoideae, see . Saint-Hilaire&#x27;s original description in 1805 included seven genera, as did De Candolle (1815). In a much more extensive treatment in 1828, he divided the Crassulaceae into the two groups, Isostemonae and Diplostemonae (i.e. haplostemony vs. obdiplostemony) on the basis of the number of staminal whorls. The former corresponded to the modern Crassuloideae. 
Two lineages, six subfamilies, and 33 genera of Crassulaceae were described by Berger in 1930: 
Lineages, subfamilies, biogeography, No. genera, &quot;type genus&quot; (No. species in genus)
* Crassula (Southern hemisphere)
** Crassuloideae S Africa 5 &quot;Crassula&quot; (300)
*** (&quot;Crassula&quot;, &quot;Dinacria&quot;, &quot;Rochea&quot;, &quot;Vauanthes&quot;, &quot;Pagella&quot;)
** Kalanchiodeae S Africa, Madagascar 3 &quot;Kalanchoe&quot; (200) 
*** (&quot;Kalanchöe&quot;, &quot;Bryophyllum&quot;, &quot;Kitchingia&quot;)
** Cotyledonoideae S Africa, Mediterranean 6 &quot;Cotyledon&quot; (30)
*** (&quot;Cotyledon&quot;, &quot;Adromischus&quot;, &quot;Umbilicus&quot;, &quot;Chiastophyllum&quot;, &quot;Pistorina&quot;, &quot;Mucizonia&quot;)
* Sedum (Northern hemisphere)
** Echeveroideae Mexico 5 &quot;Echeveria&quot; (150) 
*** (&quot;Echeveria&quot;, &quot;Villadia&quot;, &quot;Altamiranoa&quot;, &quot;Pachyphytum&quot;, &quot;Lenophyllum&quot;)
** Sempervivoideae Mediterranea, Macaronesia 5 &quot;Sempervivum&quot; (25)
*** (&quot;Sempervivum&quot;, &quot;Aeonium&quot;, &quot;Greenovia&quot;, &quot;Monanthes&quot;, &quot;Aichryson&quot;)
** Sedoideae N hemisphere, S America, N &amp; E Africa 11 &quot;Sedum&quot; (500)
*** (&quot;Sedum&quot; (since including &quot;Diamorpha&quot;), &quot;Rosularia&quot;, &quot;Orostachys&quot;, &quot;Pseudosedum&quot;, &quot;Hypagophytum&quot;, &quot;Afrovivella&quot;, &quot;Sempervivella&quot;, &quot;Sinocrassula&quot;)

Each of these contained one of the largest genera. Though various revisions since have proposed simpler schemes, such as Borisova (1939, revised 1969). Berger&#x27;s classification has proven practical and been the most widely used, although some of the subfamilies are polyphyletic. Berger&#x27;s classification depended on biogeography and a number of morphological characteristics (primarily the number and arrangement of floral parts (haplostemonous androecia, polymery), the degree of sympetaly, and phyllotaxis) which are now recognized as being of limited value due to extensive homoplasy, having evolved independently many times, and hence provides little useful information, only two of the subfamilies proving monophyletic. Berger used sympetaly to define the group of Kalanchiodeae, Cotyledonoideae and Echeveroideae, but it also occurs in taxa within Crassuloideae and Sedoideae. Berger also placed all species with polymery into his Sempervivoideae, but it occurs in two different clades, Sempervivum and Aeonium. Although five of his six subfamilies appeared to be morphologically and geographically defined, the Sedoideae were problematic, being an artificial construction containing all taxa which could not be fitted into the other subfamilies (catch-all).

Sedoideae contained three centres of diversity, East Asia, the Mediterranean region and North America, with the greatest in E. Asia. Only a few taxa, such as &quot;Rhodiola&quot; and &quot;Hylotelephium&quot;, occurring in all three regions. About 120 species were found in Europe and adjacent parts of North Africa and West Asia, and 400 in Eastern and central Asia.

Within Sedoideae, the large cosmopolitan typical genus &quot;Sedum&quot; (ca. 500 species), accounts for much of these issues, together with several smaller genera. &quot;Sedum&quot; refers to herbaceous, predominantly perennial species with alternate and entire leaves, a single subaxial hydathode and pentamerous obdiplostemous flowers with free petals. Most systematic treatments of the genus have resulted in conflicting classifications and evolutionary relationships within the Sedoideae. Attempts to resolve this have followed two opposing positions, lumping and splitting. Either accepting one artificial large catch-all polyphyletic genus, &quot;sensu lato&quot; (&quot;Sedum s.l.&quot;), or splitting it into many smaller genera, &quot;sensu stricto&quot; (&quot;Sedum s.l.&quot;). In the 1930s, Berger represented the splitting school of thought segregating genera such as &quot;Orostachys&quot;, &quot;Rosularia&quot;, &quot;Pseudosedum&quot; and &quot;Sempervivella&quot;. In contrast, Fröderströmm favoured retaining a broader construct of &quot;Sedum&quot;, recognising only &quot;Pseudosedum&quot;. In more recent times Ohba (1978) proposed the narrower view, segregating &quot;Rhodiola&quot;, &quot;Hylotelephium&quot; and &quot;Prometheum&quot;, among other genera. Ohba then subdivided the old world taxa of his now reduced &quot;Sedum&quot; into five subgenera: 
* subgenus &quot;Aizoon&quot;
* subgenus &quot;Balfouria&quot;
* subgenus &quot;Spathulata&quot;
* subgenus &quot;Sedum&quot;
* subgenus &quot;Telmissa&quot;

Grulich (1984) continued this process, proposing &quot;Aizopsis&quot; (subgenus &quot;Aizoon&quot;), &quot;Asterosedum&quot; (subgenus &quot;Spathulata&quot;), &quot;Petrosedum&quot; (subgenus &quot;Sedum&quot; series &quot;Rupestria&quot;) and &quot;Oreosedum&quot; (subgenus &quot;Sedum&quot; series &quot;Alba&quot;) as separate genera. As many as 32 segregate genera have been published, and most Eurasian crassulacean species were originally included in &quot;Sedum&quot;, but subsequently segregated (&quot;see&quot; Sempervivoideae).

Subsequently, various revisions have proposed fewer subfamilies. Takhtajan (1987) initially submerged Sempervivoideae in Sedoideae and Cotyledonoideae in Kalanchiodeae to produce four, but later (1997) only three, Crassuloideae, Kalanchoideae and Sedoideae. Thorne (1992) also proposed three (Sedoidea, Cotyledonoidea, Crassuloidea), and then two (2000), Crassuloideae and Sempervivoideae.

==== Molecular phylogenetics ====

Prior to the use of molecular methods of classification, attempts to replace Berger&#x27;s system were largely unsuccessful. Subsequently, Hart and colleagues (1995) proposed two subfamilies, based on molecular phylogenetic data with chloroplast DNA, based on 49 species in 26 genera, which identified seven clades, named for constituent genera or species. Hart utilized a hierarchical system of subfamilies, tribes and subtribes, based on molecular, geographical and morphological criteria, including embryology, pollen morphology and phytochemistry. 
* Subfamily Crassuloideae Type: &quot;Crassula&quot; 2 South African genera (250 species)
* Subfamily Sedoideae Type: &quot;Sedum&quot; 
** Tribe Kalanchoeae Type: &quot;Kalanchoe&quot; 5 S African genera (250 spp.)
** Tribe Sedeae Type: &quot;Sedum&quot; 
*** Subtribe Telephiinae Type: &quot;Hylotelephium&quot; 8 Asian genera (150 spp.)
*** Subtribe Sedinae Type: &quot;Sedum&quot; 18 Northern hemisphere genera (700 spp.)
The basal split at subfamily level, separates the haplostemonous (single series of stamens, equal in number to petals) African Crassuloideae with opposite leaves, from the Sedeae without these characteristics (obdiplostemonous, two whorls of stamens, twice as many as petals).

These clades were (1–7):
# Crassula/Crassuloideae, the basal divergence, corresponds to Berger&#x27;s subfamily of that name and are haplostemonous, but this feature is homoplasious. Confined to southern Africa, except for aquatic species, which are cosmopolitan. 
# Kalanchoe/Kalanchoeae, the second divergence, corresponds to Berger&#x27;s Kalanchoideae (&quot;Kalanchoe&quot;, &quot;Bryophyllum&quot;, &quot;Kitchingia&quot;) and the 2 S. African members of Cotyledonoideae (&quot;Adromischus&quot;, &quot;Cotyledon&quot;), together with &quot;Tylecodon&quot; which was segregated from &quot;Cotyledon&quot; in 1978. It was characterized by 4- or 5-merous flowers, connate petals and seeds, together with leaves that are flat, crenate or dentate (toothed), often petiolate and decussate. Chromosome number x=9. Within the clade, &quot;Adromischus&quot; forms the basal divergence, followed by &quot;Cotyledon&quot;/&quot;Tylecodon&quot; as sister to &quot;Kalanchoe&quot;. 
# Telephium/Telephiinae include members of Cotyledonoideae (&quot;Umbilicus&quot;), together with some Sedoideae genera (including &quot;Hylotelephium&quot;) and two of Ohba&#x27;s five subgenera of &quot;Sedum&quot; (&quot;Aizoon&quot; and &quot;Spathulata&quot;) and are usually obdiplostemonous, 5-merous flowers with free petals, flat and often crenate or dentate leaves (&quot;flat leaved Asian &quot;Sedum&quot;&quot;) and have tubers, tuberous roots or woody or thickened rhizomes (monopodial or sympodial). In this respect many species share leaf features with the Kalanchoeae and Hart considered that the Telephiinae &quot;bridge the gap&quot; between the African Kalanchoeae and the Northern hemisphere Sedinae. Distribution predominantly East Asia, with &quot;Umbilicus&quot; being Mediterranean. 
# Sempervivum includes the montane/alpine Eurasian &quot;Sempervivum&quot;, its nominative genus, together with &quot;Sedum&quot; from the same region, including &quot;Sedum&quot; series &quot;Rupestria&quot;. &quot;Sempervivum&quot; is closely related to &quot;Jovibarba&quot;, which some authors place within the former genus. 
# Leucosedum, i.e. &quot;White Sedum&quot;, from &quot;Sedum album&quot;, is polygeneric and includes additional Cotyledonoideae and Eurasian Sedoideae, including &quot;Sedum album&quot; and other species of &quot;Sedum&quot; subgenus &quot;Gormania&quot;. The other genera are thought to have evolved from the Sedum lineage in this clade, including &quot;Dudleya&quot; and &quot;Sedella&quot; (N America) and &quot;Rosularia&quot;, &quot;Prometheum&quot; and &quot;Pistorina&quot; (Eurasia). This grouping of 5–7 genera accounts for about 200 species. Some &quot;Sedum&quot; subgenus &quot;Sedum&quot; species also place here. Leucosedum species are found throughout the arid southwest United States and Mexico, as well as Eurasia.
# Aeonium is predominantly Macaronesian Sempervivoideae (&quot;Aeonium&quot;, &quot;Aichryson&quot;, &quot;Greenovia&quot; and &quot;Monanthes&quot;), from a N African ancestor, and N. African &quot;Sedum&quot;. Berger grouped the genera of that subfamily on the basis of polymerous flowers, but this is not restricted to this clade. 
# Acre, with about 7 genera and 500 species is the most taxon rich clade in the Crasulaceae. It includes the American subfamily Echeveroideae and &quot;Sedum&quot; from Asia, Europe and Macaronesia, Mexico and Africa, including &quot;Sedum acre&quot; and &quot;Sedum&quot; subgenus &quot;Sedum&quot;. The strong representation of &quot;Sedum&quot; in this large clade accounts for it comprising a third of the diversity of the family. Two subclades consist of the N American and Macaronesian taxa, the other Eurasian.

The last subtribe, the Sedinae, represents the last four clades (4–7) and contained half of the genera and species of Crassulaceae, including &quot;Sedum&quot;, which is represented in all four clades, and the bulk of clades 5 and 7. In addition to &quot;Sedum&quot;, 16 other genera are recognised. Aeonium is basal divergence, followed by Sempervivum, with Leucosedum and Acre as sister groups. The Sedinae were very diverse, making phenotypic circumscription impossible. A similar problem exists for each of its subclades. Given the realisation that &quot;Sedum&quot; &quot;s.l.&quot; was a highly artificial construction, there was support for reducing it by describing a number of segregate genera. Ohba (1995) proposed that &quot;Sedum&quot; &quot;s.s.&quot; should be restricted to clade 7, or at most clades 5–7, continuing some of the premolecular work in this direction, newly describing a number of Asian genera in addition to this reduced &quot;Sedum&quot;.:

* &quot;Hylotelephium&quot;
* &quot;Orostachys&quot;
* &quot;Aizopsis&quot;
* &quot;Phedimus&quot;
* &quot;Rhodiola&quot;
* &quot;Prometheum&quot;
* &quot;Rosularia&quot;
* &quot;Balfouria&quot;
* &quot;Sinocrassula&quot;
* &quot;Meterostachys&quot;
* &quot;Pseudosedum&quot;
The general phylogenetic topology described by &#x27;t Hart et al. (1995) was confirmed in a larger study of 112 species of Crassulaceae sampled from 33 genera, and all six recognized subfamilies, using the chloroplast gene &quot;matK&quot;. The Telephium clade, which had only been weakly supported, was seen as probably containing several subclades. A similar conclusion was seen in a further but more focussed study of East Asian Sedoideae that examined the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomes of 74 taxa. This region includes about 300 species of Sedoideae, and most genera segregated from &quot;Sedum&quot;. However the Telephium clade of Ham was recognised as actually consisting of four separate clades, of which the two largest were named Hylotelephium and Rhodiola. The former are distinguished by being autumn flowering, while the remaining Sedeae bloom in spring and early summer. This analysis also confirmed the separate identity of most of the genera previously segregated from &quot;Sedum&quot;. A second ITS study of 69 taxa in ten Asian genera resolved Telephium into just these two larger clades.

Hart&#x27;s taxonomic classification was revised by Thiede and Eggli (2007) to define three molecularly defined subfamilies, corresponding to the major clades, Crassuloideae, Kalanchoöideae and Sempervivoideae, and 34 genera. Although some authors prefer the older term Sedoideae for Sempervivoideae, Sempervivoideae has taxonomic priority. The earliest branching subfamily is the Crassuloideae (2 genera), followed by the Kalanchoöideae (4 genera). Both of these represent the genera of southern Africa. The remaining six clades are segregated into the five tribes of the large temperate climate subfamily Sempervivoideae, with about thirty genera. These are Telephiae, Umbilicicae, Semperviveae, Aeonieae and Sedeae. Sedeae is the largest of these and contains two sister clades, Leucosedum and Acre. The Sempervivoideae contain many familiar horticultural plants, such as &quot;Sedum&quot;. The phylogenetic relationships between the subfamilies are shown in the cladogram.

==== Subfamilies ====
===== Crassuloideae =====

Crassuloideae is the smallest subfamily, representing a single monophyletic clade (Crassula), defined by androecia (characterized by a single whorl of stamens, the number of which equals the number of sepals, petals and carpels, and alternating with the petals). Although cosmopolitan in distribution, the center of diversity is southern Africa, with only the aquatic species being found more widely. It consists of two genera and about 250–300 species (Berger&#x27;s other four genera (&quot;Dinacria&quot;, &quot;Pagella&quot;, &quot;Rochea&quot;, &quot;Vauanthes&quot;) having been subsumed into a larger &quot;Crassula&quot; &quot;s.l.&quot;). Crassula is morphologically diverse and up to 20 sections based on phenotypic features have been described. One of these, &quot;Tillaea&quot;, has at times been considered a separate genus. &quot;Hypagophytum&quot; is a monotypic genus, alternatively considered under Sempervivoideae.
* &quot;Crassula&quot; (including &quot;Tillaea&quot; ) c. 200 spp.
* &quot;Hypagophytum&quot; 1 sp.

===== Kalanchoöideae =====

Kalanchoöideae is the next smallest subfamily, characterised by flower parts in fours. It represents Berger&#x27;s Kalanchiodeae and Cotyledonoideae, in part. It is distributed in Madagascar and tropical Africa, with four genera and about between 130–240 species. It is characterised by fused corollas, chromosome number x=9 and mostly southern African distribution. The boundaries between &quot;Kalanchoe&quot;, &quot;Bryophyllum&quot; and &quot;Kitchingia&quot; have remained unclear, and the latter two genera are more commonly treated as sections of &quot;Kalanchoe&quot;:
* &quot;Adromischus&quot; 
* &quot;Cotyledon&quot; 
* &quot;Kalanchoe&quot; (including &quot;Bryophyllum&quot; , &quot;Kitchingia&quot; )
* &quot;Tylecodon&quot; 

===== Sempervivoideae =====

Sempervivoideae is the largest and taxonomically most complex subfamily, distributed in temperate climates, with about 20–30 genera, and divided into five tribes, of which Sedeae contains two distinct clades, Leucosedum and Acre:
* Telephieae
* Umbiliceae
* Semperviveae
* Aeonieae
* Sedeae 
== Distribution and habitat ==

The family Crassulaceae has a cosmopolitan distribution, particularly &quot;Crassula&quot;, though rare in South America and Australia, predominantly in the temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern hemisphere and Africa. The main centers of diversity being Mexico and south-western USA (about 300 species), Southern Africa (about 250 species), the Mediterranean region (about 177 species) and adjacent Macaronesia archipelago (200 species), and south-eastern Asia (about 200 species), especially the Himalayas. The Mediterranean region includes 12 genera. The greatest diversity is in southern Africa and Madagascar where the Crassula and Kalanchoe clades are confined.

=== Habitat ===

Crassulaceae are found predominantly in semi-arid rocky habitats with monsoonal patterns of precipitation and high humidity, while some genera (e.g. &quot;Sempervivum&quot;) occur primarily in arid mountainous habitats and higher altitudes. Although their succulent leaves and Crassulacean acid metabolism allow them to adapt to a variable water supply, they are not found in true desert areas. Some lineages have adapted to semi-aquatic and seasonally aquatic areas (&quot;Crassula,&quot; &quot;Tillaea&quot;, &quot;Sedella&quot;) while Echeveria and Aichryson are found in moist, cool forest areas.

== Ecology ==

While most Crassulaceae are perennial, &quot;Tillaea&quot; are annuals, and annual species are also found among &quot;Aichryson&quot;, &quot;Crassula&quot;, &quot;Sedum&quot; and &quot;Monanthes&quot;.

== Cultivation ==

Many Crassulaceae species are cultivated as pot plants or in rock gardens and borders.

== Toxicity ==

Some species are toxic to animals, such as those of &quot;Cotyledon&quot; and &quot;Tylecodon&quot;, e.g. &quot;Tylecodon wallichii&quot;. All species of &quot;Kalanchoe&quot; are toxic, particularly to livestock in Australia and South Africa, where alternative forage is scarce, with the flowers containing the highest concentration of cardiotoxins, the active ingredient being bufadienolides (named for their digoxin-like effect on &quot;Bufo&quot; toads). Illness in domestic pets has also been reported, &quot;Kalanchoe blossfeldiana&quot; being a popular Christmas time decorative household plant.

== Uses ==

Although no species have a role as crops, they are popular horticultural commodities as ornamental plants e.g. &quot;Kalanchoe&quot;, while others (e.g. &quot;Crassula helmsii&quot;) may also have a nuisance role as weeds.

<doc id="264922" wikidata="Q336497" url="?curid=264922" title="James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce">
<text>James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce, (10 May 1838 – 22 January 1922), was a British academic, jurist, historian, and Liberal politician. According to Keith Robbins, he was a widely traveled authority on law, government, and history whose expertise led to high political offices culminating with his successful role as ambassador to the United States, 1907–13. In that era, he represented the interests of the vast British Empire to the United States. His intellectual influence was greatest in &quot;The American Commonwealth&quot; (1888), an in-depth study of American politics that shaped the understanding of America in Britain and in the United States as well. In 1895, he chaired the Royal Commission on Secondary Education.

==Background and education==
Bryce was born in Arthur Street in Belfast, County Antrim, in Ulster, the son of Margaret, daughter of James Young of Whiteabbey, and James Bryce, LLD, from near Coleraine, County Londonderry. The first eight years of his life were spent residing at his grandfather&#x27;s Whiteabbey residence, often playing for hours on the tranquil picturesque shoreline. Annan Bryce was his younger brother. He was educated under his uncle Reuben John Bryce at the Belfast Academy, Glasgow High School, the University of Glasgow, the University of Heidelberg and Trinity College, Oxford.

He was elected a fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, in 1862 and was called to the Bar, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, in 1867. His days as a student at the University of Heidelberg gave him a long-life admiration of German historical and legal scholarship. He became a believer in &quot;Teutonic freedom&quot;, an ill-defined concept that was held to bind Germany, Britain and the United States together. For him, the United States, the British Empire and Germany were &quot;natural friends&quot;.

==Academic career==
Bryce was admitted to the Bar and practised law in London for a few years but was soon called back to Oxford to become Regius Professor of Civil Law, a position he held from 1870 to 1893. From 1870 to 1875 he was also Professor of Jurisprudence at Owens College, Manchester. His reputation as a historian had been made as early as 1864 by his work on the Holy Roman Empire.

In 1872 Bryce travelled to Iceland to see the land of the Icelandic sagas, as he was a great admirer of &quot;Njáls saga&quot;. In 1876 he ventured through Russia to Mount Ararat, climbed above the tree line and found a piece of hand-hewn timber, long and thick. He agreed that the evidence fit the Armenian Church&#x27;s belief that it was from Noah&#x27;s Ark and offered no other explanations.

In 1872 Bryce, a proponent of higher education, particularly for women, joined the Central Committee of the National Union for Improving the Education of Women of All Classes (NUIEWC).

==Member of Parliament==
In 1880 Bryce, an ardent Liberal in politics, was elected to the House of Commons as member for the constituency of Tower Hamlets in London. In 1885 he was returned for South Aberdeen and he was re-elected there on succeeding occasions. He remained a Member of Parliament until 1907.

Bryce&#x27;s intellectual distinction and political industry made him a valuable member of the Liberal Party. As early as the late 1860s he served as Chairman of the Royal Commission on Secondary Education. In 1885 he was made Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs under William Ewart Gladstone but had to leave office after the Liberals were defeated in the general election later that year. In 1892 he joined Gladstone&#x27;s last cabinet as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and was sworn of the Privy Council at the same time.

In 1894 Bryce was appointed President of the Board of Trade in the new cabinet of Lord Rosebery, but had to leave this office, along with the whole Liberal cabinet, the following year. The Liberals remained out of office for the next ten years.

In 1897, after a visit to South Africa, Bryce published a volume of &quot;Impressions&quot; of that country that had considerable influence in Liberal circles when the Second Boer War was being discussed. He devoted significant sections of the book to the recent history of South Africa, various social and economic details about the country, and his experiences while travelling with his party. 

In 1900 he introduced a Private Member&#x27;s Bill to secure access for the public to the mountains and moorlands in Scotland.

The &quot;still radical&quot; Bryce was made Chief Secretary for Ireland in Prime Minister Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s cabinet in 1905 and remained in office throughout 1906. Bryce was critical of many of the social reforms proposed by this Liberal Government, including old-age pensions, the Trade Disputes Act and the redistributive &quot;People&#x27;s Budget,&quot; which he regarded as making unwarranted concessions to socialism.

== &quot;The American Commonwealth&quot; (1888) ==
Bryce had become well known in America for his book &quot;The American Commonwealth&quot; (1888), a thorough examination of the institutions of the United States from the point of view of a historian and constitutional lawyer. Bryce painstakingly reproduced the travels of Alexis de Tocqueville, who wrote &quot;Democracy in America&quot; (1835–1840). Tocqueville had emphasised the egalitarianism of early-19th-century America, but Bryce was dismayed to find vast inequality: &quot;Sixty years ago, there were no great fortunes in America, few large fortunes, no poverty. Now there is some poverty ... and a greater number of gigantic fortunes than in any other country of the world&quot; and &quot;As respects education ... the profusion of…elementary schools tends to raise the mass to a higher point than in Europe ... [but] there is an increasing class that has studied at the best universities. It appears that equality has diminished [in this regard] and will diminish further.&quot; The work was heavily used in academia, partly as a result of Bryce&#x27;s close friendships with men such as James B. Angell, President of the University of Michigan and successively Charles W. Eliot and Abbott Lawrence Lowell at Harvard. The work also became a key text for American writers seeking to popularise a view of American history as distinctively Anglo-Saxon. &quot;The American Commonwealth&quot; contains Bryce&#x27;s observation that &quot;the enormous majority&quot; of American women opposed their own right to vote.

==Ambassador to the United States==
In February 1907 Bryce was appointed Ambassador to the United States. He held this office until 1913, and was very efficient in strengthening Anglo-American ties and friendship. The appointment, criticised at the time as withdrawing from the regular diplomatic corps one of its most coveted posts, proved a great success. The United States had been in the habit of sending, as minister or ambassador to the Court of St James&#x27;s, one of its leading citizens: a statesman, a man of letters, or a lawyer whose name and reputation were already well known in Great Britain. For the first time Great Britain responded in kind. Bryce, already favourably regarded in America as the author of &quot;The American Commonwealth&quot;, made himself thoroughly at home in the country; and, after the fashion of American ministers or ambassadors in England, he took up with eagerness and success the role of public orator on matters outside party politics, so far as his diplomatic duties permitted.

He made many personal friends among American politicians, such as President Theodore Roosevelt. The German ambassador in Washington, Graf Heinrich von Bernstorff, later stated how relieved he felt that Bryce was not his competitor for American sympathies during the First World War, even though Bernstorff helped to keep the United States from declaring war until 1917.
Most of the questions with which he had to deal related to the relations between the United States and Canada, and in this connection he paid several visits to Canada to confer with the Governor General and his ministers. At the close of his embassy he told the Canadians that probably three-fourths of the business of the British embassy at Washington was Canadian, and of the eleven or twelve treaties he had signed nine had been treaties relating to the affairs of Canada. &quot;By those nine treaties,&quot; he said, &quot;we have, I hope, dealt with all the questions that are likely to arise between the United States and Canada questions relating to boundary; questions relating to the disposal and the use of boundary waters; questions relating to the fisheries in the international waters where the two countries adjoin one another; questions relating to the interests which we have in sealing in the Behring Sea, and many other matters.&quot; He could boast that he left the relations between the United States and Canada on an excellent footing.

==Peerage==
In 1914, after his retirement as Ambassador and his return to Britain, Bryce was raised to the peerage as Viscount Bryce, &quot;of Dechmount in the County of Lanark&quot;. Thus he became a member of the House of Lords, the powers of which had been curtailed by the Parliament Act 1911.

==First World War==
Along with other English scholars, who had ties of close association with German learning, he was reluctant in the last days of July 1914 to contemplate the possibility of war with Germany, but the violation of Belgian neutrality and the stories of outrages committed in Belgium by German troops brought him speedily into line with national feeling.
Following the outbreak of the First World War Bryce was commissioned by Prime Minister H. H. Asquith to write what became known as &quot;The Bryce Report&quot; in which he described German atrocities in Belgium. The report was published in 1915 and was damning of German behaviour against civilians. Bryce&#x27;s account was confirmed by Vernon Lyman Kellogg, the Director of the American Commission for Relief in Belgium, who told the &quot;New York Times&quot; that the German military had enslaved hundreds of thousands of Belgian workers, and abused and maimed many of them in the process.

Bryce strongly condemned the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire mainly in 1915. Bryce was the first person to speak on the subject in the House of Lords, in July 1915. Later, with the assistance of the historian Arnold J. Toynbee, he produced a documentary record of the massacres that was published as a Blue Book by the British government in 1916. In 1921 Bryce wrote that the Armenian genocide had also claimed half of the population of the Assyrians in the Ottoman Empire and that similar cruelties had been perpetrated upon them.

==Beliefs ==
According to Moton Keller: Bryce believed in Liberalism, the classic 19th century Liberalism of John Bright and William Gladstone, of free trade, free speech and press, personal liberty, and responsible leadership. This notably genial gregarious man had his hates, chief among them illiberal regimes: the Turkish oppressors of Bulgars and Armenians, and, later the Kaiser&#x27;s Reich in World War I.

Bryce had a distrust of current democratic practices seen as late as his &quot;Modern Democracy&quot; (1921), which was a comparative study of a certain number of popular governments in their actual working. On the other hand, he was a leader in promoting international organizations. During the last years of his life Bryce served as a judge at the International Court in The Hague, and promoted the establishment of the League of Nations.

==Honours and other public appointments==

Bryce received numerous academic honours from home and foreign universities. In September 1901, he received the degree of Doctor of Laws from Dartmouth College, and in October 1902 he received an honorary degree (LLD) from the University of St Andrews, and in 1914 he received an honorary degree from Oxford.
He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1894.

In earlier life, he was a notable mountain climber, ascending Mount Ararat in 1876, and published a volume on Transcaucasia and Ararat in 1877; in 1899 to 1901, he was the president of the Alpine Club. From his Caucasian journey, he brought back a deep distrust of Ottoman rule in Asia Minor and a distinct sympathy for the Armenian people.

In 1882, Bryce established the National Liberal Club, whose members, in its first three decades, included fellow founder Prime Minister Gladstone, George Bernard Shaw, David Lloyd George, H. H. Asquith and many other prominent Liberal candidates and MP&#x27;s such as Winston Churchill and Bertrand Russell. In April 1882 Bryce was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society. He was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1893 and an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1895.

In 1907 he was made a Member of the Order of Merit by King Edward VII, At the King&#x27;s death, Bryce arranged his Washington Memorial Service. At the time of Bryce&#x27;s memorial service at Westminster Abbey, his wife, Elizabeth, received condolences from King George V, who &quot;regarded Lord Bryce as an old friend and trusted counsellor to whom I could always turn.&quot; Queen Victoria had said that Bryce was &quot;one of the best informed men on all subjects I have ever met&quot;. In 1918 he was appointed GCVO.

Bryce was president of the American Political Science Association from 1907 to 1908. He was the fourth person to hold this office. He was president of the British Academy from 1913 to 1917. In 1919 he delivered the British Academy&#x27;s inaugural Raleigh Lecture on History, on &quot;World History&quot;.

Bryce chaired the Conference on the Reform of the Second Chamber in 1917–1918.

==Personal life==

Bryce married Elizabeth Marion, daughter of Thomas Ashton and sister of Thomas Ashton, 1st Baron Ashton of Hyde, in 1889. Lord and Lady Bryce had no children.

Bryce died while on holiday on 22 January 1922, aged 83, of heart failure in his sleep at The Victoria Hotel, Sidmouth, Devon, on the last of his lifelong travels. The viscountcy died with him. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, following which his ashes were buried near to his parents at Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh.

Lady Bryce is recalled in the memoirs of Captain Peter Middleton, grandfather of Catherine, Princess of Wales who wrote, &quot;Nor will I forget my terror of Lady Bryce&quot;, who was the aunt of his mother&#x27;s first cousins, sisters Elinor and Elizabeth Lupton.

Lady Bryce died in 1939. Her papers are held at the Bodleian Library.

==Memorials==

There is a large monument to Viscount Bryce in the southwest section of the Grange Cemetery in Edinburgh, facing north at the west end of the central east–west avenue. His ashes are buried there.

There is a bust of Viscount Bryce in Trinity Church on Broadway, near Wall Street in New York. A similar bust is in the U.S. Capitol Building and there is a commemorative Bryce Park in Washington DC.

In 1965 the James Bryce Chair of Government was endowed at the University of Glasgow. &quot;Government&quot; was changed to &quot;Politics&quot; in 1970.

In 2013 the Ulster History Circle unveiled a blue plaque dedicated to him, near his birthplace in Belfast.

On the occasion of the 160th anniversary of Bryce&#x27;s birth, a small street off of Baghramyan Avenue in Yerevan, Armenia was named &quot;James Bryce Street&quot; in 1998.

<text>Crocodylinae is a subfamily of true crocodiles within the family Crocodylidae, and is the sister taxon to Osteolaeminae (dwarf crocodiles and slender-snouted crocodiles).

==Taxonomy==
Crocodylinae was cladistically defined by Christopher Brochu in 1999 as &quot;Crocodylus niloticus&quot; (the Nile crocodile) and all crocodylians more closely related to it than to &quot;Osteolaemus tetraspis&quot; (the Dwarf crocodile). This is a stem-based definition, and is the sister taxon to Osteolaeminae.

Crocodylinae contains the extant genus &quot;Crocodylus&quot;. It is disputed as to whether is also includes &quot;Mecistops&quot; (slender-snouted crocodiles), or the extinct genus Voay.

===Phylogeny===
Some morphological studies have recovered &quot;Mecistops&quot; as a basal member of Crocodylinae, more closely related to &quot;Crocodylus&quot; than to &quot;Osteolaemus&quot; and the other members of Osteolaeminae, as shown in the cladogram below.
The below cladogram is based on a 2021 study using paleogenomics that extracted DNA from the extinct &quot;Voay&quot;, recovering it as a member of Crocodylinae.
===Species list===
Crocodylinae contains 13-14 extant species and 6 extinct species.

<text>A server farm or server cluster is a collection of computer servers, usually maintained by an organization to supply server functionality far beyond the capability of a single machine. They often consist of thousands of computers which require a large amount of power to run and to keep cool. At the optimum performance level, a server farm has enormous financial and environmental costs.
They often include backup servers that can take over the functions of primary servers that may fail. Server farms are typically collocated with the network switches and/or routers that enable communication between different parts of the cluster and the cluster&#x27;s users. Server &quot;farmers&quot; typically mount computers, routers, power supplies and related electronics on 19-inch racks in a server room or data center.

==Applications==
Server farms are commonly used for cluster computing. Many modern supercomputers comprise giant server farms of high-speed processors connected by either Ethernet or custom interconnects such as Infiniband or Myrinet. Web hosting is a common use of a server farm; such a system is sometimes collectively referred to as a &quot;web farm&quot;. Other uses of server farms include scientific simulations (such as computational fluid dynamics) and the rendering of 3D computer generated imagery (see render farm).

Server farms are increasingly being used instead of or in addition to mainframe computers by large enterprises. In large server farms, the failure of an individual machine is a commonplace event: large server farms provide redundancy, automatic failover, and rapid reconfiguration of the server cluster.

==Performance==
The performance of the largest server farms (thousands of processors and up) is typically limited by the performance of the data center&#x27;s cooling systems and the total electricity cost rather than by the processors&#x27; performance. Computers in server farms run 24/7 and consume large amounts of electricity. For this reason, the critical design parameter for both large and continuous systems tends to be performance per watt rather than cost of peak performance or (peak performance / (unit * initial cost)). Also, for high availability systems that must run 24/7 (unlike supercomputers that can be power-cycled to demand, and also tend to run at much higher utilizations), there is more attention to power-saving features such as variable clock-speed and the ability to turn off both computer parts, processor parts, and entire computers (WoL and virtualization) according to demand without bringing down services. The network connecting the servers in a server farm is also an essential factor in overall performance, especially when running applications that process massive volumes of data.

===Performance per watt===
The EEMBC EnergyBench, SPECpower, and the Transaction Processing Performance Council TPC-Energy are benchmarks designed to predict performance per watt in a server farm. The power used by each rack of equipment can be measured at the power distribution unit.
Some servers include power tracking hardware so the people running the server farm can measure the power used by each server. The power used by the entire server farm may be reported in terms of power usage effectiveness or data center infrastructure efficiency.

According to some estimates, for every 100 watts spent on running the servers, roughly another 50 watts is needed to cool them. For this reason, the siting of a server farm can be as important as processor selection in achieving power efficiency. Iceland, which has a cold climate all year as well as cheap and carbon-neutral geothermal electricity supply, is building its first major server farm hosting site. Fibre optic cables are being laid from Iceland to North America and Europe to enable companies there to locate their servers in Iceland. Other countries with favorable conditions, such as Canada, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland, are trying to attract cloud computing data centers. In these countries, heat from the servers can be cheaply vented or used to help heat buildings, thus reducing the energy consumption of conventional heaters.

<doc id="264934" wikidata="Q951886" url="?curid=264934" title="Stephen Glass">
<text>Stephen Randall Glass (born September 15, 1972) is an American former journalist. He worked for &quot;The New Republic&quot; from 1995 to 1998 until it was revealed many of his published articles were fabrications. An internal investigation by &quot;The New Republic&quot; determined the majority of stories he wrote either contained false information or were fictitious.

Following the journalism scandal, Glass pursued a career in law. Although he earned a Juris Doctor from Georgetown University Law Center and passed the bar exam in New York and California, he was unable to become a licensed attorney in either state over concerns derived from his scandal. Glass instead found work as a paralegal at the law firm Carpenter, Zuckerman &amp; Rowley, serving as the director of special projects and trial-team coordinator.

Glass made a brief return to writing when he fictionalized his story in his 2003 novel &quot;The Fabulist&quot;. The same year, the scandal was dramatized in the film &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;, which is based on a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article of the same name and stars Hayden Christensen as Glass.

== Journalism career ==
Glass grew up in a Jewish family in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, and attended Highland Park High School. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania as a University Scholar and was an executive editor of the student newspaper, &quot;The Daily Pennsylvanian&quot;. After his graduation, Glass worked for the conservative &quot;Policy Review&quot; before being hired by &quot;The New Republic&quot; in 1995 as an editorial assistant. Soon after, the 23-year-old Glass advanced to writing features. While employed full-time at &quot;TNR&quot;, he also wrote for other magazines including &quot;George&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;; he also contributed to Public Radio International&#x27;s (PRI) &quot;This American Life&quot;.

=== &quot;New Republic&quot; work ===
Glass generally enjoyed loyalty from &quot;The New Republic&quot; staff. But his articles often relied on unnamed or partially identified sources, and several of his pieces prompted denials from their subjects.

In December 1996, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) was the target of a hostile article by Glass titled &quot;Hazardous to Your Mental Health&quot;. CSPI wrote a letter to the editor and issued a press release pointing out numerous inaccuracies and distortions and hinting at possible plagiarism. The organization Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) accused Glass of falsehoods in his March 1997 article &quot;Don&#x27;t You D.A.R.E&quot;. In May 1997, Joe Galli of the College Republican National Committee accused Glass of fabrications in &quot;Spring Breakdown&quot;, his lurid tale of drinking and debauchery at the 1997 Conservative Political Action Conference. A June 1997 article called &quot;Peddling Poppy&quot; about a Hofstra University conference on George H. W. Bush drew a letter from Hofstra reciting errors in the story.

Through these allegations, &quot;The New Republic&quot; generally defended Glass; editor Michael Kelly even demanded CSPI apologize to Glass. Still, the magazine&#x27;s majority owner and editor-in-chief, Martin Peretz, later said that his wife had told him that she did not find Glass&#x27;s stories credible and had stopped reading them.

==== Exposure ====
In the May 18, 1998, issue, &quot;The New Republic&quot; published a story by Glass (by then an associate editor) entitled &quot;Hack Heaven&quot;, purportedly telling the story of a 15-year-old hacker who had penetrated a company&#x27;s computer network, then been hired by that company as a security consultant. The article opened as follows,

Adam Penenberg, a reporter with &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, endeavored to fact check the piece, in part to explain how &quot;Forbes Digital had been scooped by a weekly political publication.&quot; Beyond Glass&#x27;s story, Penenberg found no search results for &quot;Jukt Micronics&quot;, and, when he made an inquiry to the California Franchise Tax Board, the tax board reported back that no such company had ever paid taxes. Penenberg also found that several other claims Glass made in the article appeared to be false: Glass claimed that law-enforcement officials in Nevada ran articles pleading with companies not to hire hackers, but Bob Harmon, Public Information Officer for the Nevada State Attorney General&#x27;s Office, said no such ads ran. Glass claimed that 21 states were considering a &quot;Uniform Computer Security Act&quot;, which would &quot;criminalize immunity deals between hackers and companies,&quot; but law enforcement officials and the National Conference of Commissions on Uniform State Laws were unaware of any such proposed legislation. Glass claimed that there had been a computer-hacker conference in Bethesda, Maryland, sponsored by the &quot;National Assembly of Hackers&quot;, but the &quot;Forbes&quot; team &quot;could not unearth a single hacker who had even heard of this outfit, let alone attended the conference.&quot;

On Friday, May 8, 1998, &quot;Forbes&quot; presented its full findings to Charles Lane, the lead editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot;. Lane had, to that point, been unaware of potential issues with the article. Lane had Glass take him to a Hyatt Regency Hotel in Bethesda, Maryland, where Glass had claimed the computer-hacker convention occurred. He found that the hotel&#x27;s layout did not match the story&#x27;s description, the building in which the piece said the event took place had not been open on the supposed day of the conference, and the restaurant where the hackers supposedly had a dinner banquet afterwards closed in the mid afternoon. Lane dialed a Palo Alto number provided by Glass and spoke with a man who identified himself as a Jukt executive; when he realized that the &quot;executive&quot; was actually Glass&#x27;s brother, he fired Glass.

Lane later said:
==== Aftermath ====
&quot;The New Republic&quot; subsequently determined that at least 27 of the 41 articles Glass wrote for the magazine contained fabricated material. Some of the 27, such as &quot;Don&#x27;t You D.A.R.E.&quot;, contained real reporting interwoven with fabricated quotations and incidents, while others, including &quot;Hack Heaven&quot;, were completely made up. In the process of creating the &quot;Hack Heaven&quot; article, Glass had gone to especially elaborate lengths to thwart the discovery of his deception by &quot;TNR&quot; fact checkers: creating a website and voice mail account for Jukt Micronics; fabricating notes of story gathering; having fake business cards printed; and even composing editions of a fake computer hacker community newsletter.

As for the balance of the 41 stories, Lane, in an interview given for the 2005 DVD edition of &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;, said, &quot;In fact, I&#x27;d bet lots of the stuff in those other 14 is fake too. ... It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re vouching for those 14, that they&#x27;re true. They&#x27;re probably not either&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;George&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; also re-examined his contributions. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; found the material generally accurate yet maintained they had no way of verifying information because Glass had cited anonymous sources. &quot;George&quot; discovered that at least three of the stories Glass wrote for it contained fabrications. Glass fabricated quotations in a profile piece and apologized to the article&#x27;s subject, Vernon Jordan, an adviser to Bill Clinton when he was president. A court filing for Glass&#x27;s application to the California bar gave an updated count on his journalism career: 36 of his stories at &quot;The New Republic&quot; were said to be fabricated in part or in whole, along with three articles for &quot;George&quot;, two articles for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and one for &quot;Policy Review&quot;. Glass also later wrote a letter admitting he fabricated the article he wrote for &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; and the company retracted the story (the publication&#x27;s first retraction in 165 years).

Glass had contributed a story to an October 1997 episode of the NPR program &quot;This American Life&quot; about an internship at George Washington&#x27;s former plantation and another to a December 1997 episode about time he spent as a telephone psychic. The program subsequently removed both segments from the Archives section of its website &quot;because of questions about [their] truthfulness&quot;.

In 2003, Glass briefly returned to journalism, writing an article about Canadian marijuana laws for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. On November 7, 2003, Glass participated in a panel discussion on journalistic ethics at George Washington University, along with the editor who had hired him at &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Andrew Sullivan, who accused Glass of being a &quot;serial liar&quot; who was using &quot;contrition as a career move&quot;.

==== Depiction in other media ====
In 2003, Glass published a fictionalized account of his time at the New Republic, the &quot;biographical novel&quot;, &quot;The Fabulist&quot;. Glass sat for an interview with the weekly news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; timed to coincide with the release of his book. &quot;The New Republic&quot; literary editor, Leon Wieseltier, complained, &quot;The creep is doing it again. Even when it comes to reckoning with his own sins, he is still incapable of nonfiction. The careerism of his repentance is repulsively consistent with the careerism of his crimes&quot;. One reviewer of &quot;The Fabulist&quot; commented, &quot;The irony—we must have irony in a tale this tawdry—is that Mr. Glass is abundantly talented. He&#x27;s funny and fluent and daring. In a parallel universe, I could imagine him becoming a perfectly respectable novelist—a prize-winner, perhaps, with a bit of luck&quot;.

A film about the scandal, &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;, was released in October 2003 and depicted a stylized view of Glass&#x27;s rise and fall at &quot;The New Republic&quot;. Written and directed by Billy Ray, it stars Hayden Christensen as Glass, Peter Sarsgaard as Charles Lane, Hank Azaria as Michael Kelly and Steve Zahn as Adam Penenberg. The film, appearing shortly after &quot;The New York Times&quot; suffered a similar plagiarism scandal with the discovery of Jayson Blair&#x27;s fabrications, occasioned critiques of journalism by nationally prominent journalists such as Frank Rich and Mark Bowden.

=== Restitution efforts ===
In 2015, Glass sent &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; a check for $10,000 – what he was paid for the false articles – writing in the attached letter that he wanted &quot;to make right that part of my many transgressions...I recognize that repaying Harper&#x27;s will not remedy my wrongdoing, make us even, or undo what I did wrong. That said, I did not deserve the money that Harper&#x27;s paid me and it should be returned&quot;. Glass has stated he has repaid $200,000 to &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; and the publisher of &quot;Policy Review&quot;.

== Legal career ==
In 2000, Glass graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Georgetown University Law Center with a Juris Doctor degree and was named a John M. Olin Fellow in law and economics. He then passed the New York State bar examination in 2000, but the Committee of Bar Examiners refused to certify him on its moral-fitness test, citing ethics concerns related to his journalistic malpractice. He later abandoned his efforts to be admitted to the bar in New York.

Glass clerked for D.C. Superior Court Judge A. Franklin Burgess, Jr. and interned for district-court judge Ricardo M. Urbina. In 2004, he was hired by Carpenter &amp; Zuckerman, a personal injury law firm in West Hollywood, California. When joining the firm, a senior partner told Glass that being exposed as a serial fabricator &quot;is the best thing that ever happened to you. Now that you&#x27;ve fallen on your face, you can actually be a useful human being.&quot; Also remarking later, &quot;brilliance that has overcome failure can be truly useful to your fellow man.&quot; Glass is not licensed to practice law. At the firm he is listed as director of special projects.

=== Unsuccessful California Bar application ===

Glass passed the California Bar Exam in 2006 or 2007. In 2009, Glass applied to join the State Bar of California. The Committee of Bar Examiners refused to certify him, finding that he did not satisfy California&#x27;s moral fitness test because of his history of journalistic deception. Insisting that he had reformed, Glass then petitioned the State Bar Court&#x27;s hearing department, which found that Glass possessed the necessary &quot;good moral character&quot; to be admitted as an attorney.

The Committee of Bar Examiners sought review in the State Bar&#x27;s Review Department and filed a Writ of Review, thereby petitioning the California Supreme Court to review the decision. On November 16, 2011, the Supreme Court granted the petition, the first time in 11 years the court had granted review in a moral character case. On January 3, 2012, Glass&#x27;s attorneys filed papers with the Court arguing that his behavior had been beyond reproach for more than 13 years and this was proof that he had reformed.

On November 6, 2013, the California Supreme Court heard arguments in Glass&#x27;s case and ruled unanimously against him in an opinion issued January 27, 2014. The lengthy opinion describes the applicant&#x27;s history in minute detail, and rejected Glass&#x27;s claim to have acted honestly since his deceptions as a journalist were revealed, instead finding &quot;instances of dishonesty and disingenuousness persisting throughout that period&quot;. The court was particularly troubled by &quot;hypocrisy and evasiveness in Glass&#x27;s testimony at the [2010] California State Bar hearing&quot;, and further noted that he did not admit the full extent of his fabrications until the California State Bar moral character proceedings in 2007. Accordingly, Glass was denied admission to the California bar.

== Personal life ==
In 1998, Glass met lawyer Julie Hilden in connection with his legal issues. They began dating in 2000, and married in 2014 after she was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer&#x27;s. Glass tended to her in their home in Venice, Los Angeles and hired a housekeeper and aides to stay with her while he was at work. Hilden died in 2018.
