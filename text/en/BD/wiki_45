<text>Prosthetic makeup also known as special makeup effects or FX prosthesis, is the process of using prosthetic sculpting, molding and casting techniques to create advanced cosmetic effects. Prosthetics are used on stage and screen to create fantasy creatures, simulated injuries, or likenesses of other people. 

Prosthetic makeup draws a straight lineage from the stagecraft of theater and can be observed at the birth of science fiction cinema with &quot;Le Voyage dans La Lune&quot;, a 1902 French adventure short film directed by pioneer of special effects Georges Méliès. 

The work of makeup artist Jack Pierce furthered pioneered early Hollywood prosthetic work and is best remembered for creating the iconic makeup worn by Boris Karloff in &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, his makeup for Lon Chaney Jr. in &quot;The Wolfman&quot;.

Modern prosthetic makeup was revolutionized by Christopher Tucker whose work on &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; was considered so ground breaking that when it failed to win any recognition at the 53rd Academy Awards letters of protests argued for it to receive an honorary award – this was ignored but did lead to the creation of the Academy Award for Best Makeup the following year.

== History ==
Before sculpted prosthetic appliances became standard, special effects makeup artists would have to build up forms on the actor&#x27;s face before shooting began, which often took several hours and would have to be done from scratch at the start of each day. The Frankenstein makeup by Jack Pierce consisted of spirit gum, cotton, collodion, and wax, taking around 3 hours to apply in the morning, and another 1-2 hours to remove at the end of the day. 

Rubber began to be used to make appliances in the late 30s, with Pierce making rubber head forms and broken neck appliances for Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi respectively. A rubber snout was made for Lon Chaney Jr. to wear in The Wolfman, though application of the hair for the titular character could take up to 16 hours.

Foam latex was first used by makeup artist Jack Dawn for The Wizard of Oz in 1939 to create the makeup for the Cowardly Lion and Scarecrow. It wasn&#x27;t until John Chambers&#x27;s work on Planet of the Apes in 1968 that prosthetics transitioned from full face appliances to smaller, overlapping pieces which afforded the actors more expression and movement.

In 1965, William Tuttle won an Academy Honorary Award for his makeup work on 7 Faces of Dr. Lao at the 37th Academy Awards, making him the first artist to win an award for makeup before the Best Makeup category was introduced in 1981.

==Technique==

The process of creating a makeup prosthetic appliance typically begins with concept art, created by the artist or production. Once the actor has been chosen, the effects artist will prepare the actor for the process of taking a mold of the actor&#x27;s face, head or body part. This process is called lifecasting. Lifecast molds are made from prosthetic alginate or more recently, from skin-safe platinum silicone rubber. This initial mold can be relatively weak but flexible. A hard mother mold, also known as a jacket or matrix, is typically made of plaster bandage which is created over the outside of the initial flexible mold to provide support. This mold is used to cast a copy of that part of the actor, in a hard resin or plaster type material to eventually use as a base for sculpting the prosthetic. This is considered a &quot;positive&quot; or life-cast. 

Before sculpting the clay prosthetic over the positive, The positive must be prepared by adding &quot;keys&quot; or mold points along the edges of it, which are often added using clay or more plaster or carved into the life-cast, to make sure that the two pieces of the mold will fit together correctly. Often the life-cast will be given an additional border in clay or plaster in order to have an area free of detail and undercuts to add these keys. The entire life-cast with borders and keys included is then molded. This ensures a stable area with built in keys to sculpt the prosthetic over. This also provides the artist an easily duplicated copy, if needed. Multiple copies are typically used to make variations or stages of prosthetics or different prosthetics for the same actor. 

Life-casts of full bodies and body parts are also used and reused as the basis for making fake body parts, severed limbs, and various &quot;gore&quot; type effects used in horror films or films where body parts are required. 

The prosthetic required will be sculpted over the life-cast of that body part to become the design intended. For example, if the desired look is a pig nosed person, then the artist would sculpt the pig nose over the actor&#x27;s real nose on the life-cast or positive copy. The edges of the clay should be made as thin as possible, for the clay is a stand-in for what will eventually be the prosthetic piece. Once sculpted, the new addition of the clay sculpted prosthetic part must be molded. Since the positive has been prepared with the additional border and keys, it actually becomes part of the prosthetic mold itself. Once molded, and clay removed, new mold cleaned out, the positive is one part of the mold and the new mold is the other side which has the negative of the newly sculpted prosthetic. This gives two or more pieces of a mold - a positive of the face or body part, and one (or more for complex molds) &quot;negative&quot; mold pieces with prosthetic sculpted in. 

To make the new prosthetic, material is cast into the mold cavity (where the clay used to be). The prosthetic material can be foam latex, gelatin, silicone or other similar materials. The prosthetic is cured within the two-part mold, and then carefully removed and prepared for painting and or application to the actor.

==Conflict with CGI==
As the film/television industry continues to grow, so do the capabilities of the technologies behind it. Since the debut of newer technologies, many have feared that CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) will put practical SFX makeup out of business. CGI can be used to accomplish effects that simply aren&#x27;t possible when working in practical effects. 

Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis, two experienced SFX artists from Amalgamated Dynamics near L.A., share what they see as the middle ground on the subject. In an interview, they explain that most movies use (out of necessity) a combination of practical effects and CGI. They see CGI as a tool that can be utilized in a positive or negative way, just like practical effects. Tom Savini (an SFX artist known for his work in &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Creepshow&quot;) states: &quot;They still use the make-up guys to design the creatures and that’s what they work from. I don’t think you’ll see make-up effects guys hanging out on corners with signs that say: &quot;WILL DO EFFECTS FOR FOOD.&quot;&quot;

In the 2000s, CGI and practical effects began being used in tandem, with CGI often used to enhance prosthetic makeup in a way that would have been impossible to do practically such as erasing body parts or creating hollow points in the face. For Hugo Weaving&#x27;s role as Red Skull in &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot;, Weaving wore a full head silicone prosthetic makeup, which was covered in CGI tracking markers for his nose to be erased by VFX.

==Real-world use==
Moulage is a process in which makeup is used to simulate different wounds and trauma in order to prepare medical, emergency, and military personnel for what they could experience in the field and lessen psychological trauma.

Craniofacial prosthetics are used in medical fields for cosmetic purposes to disguise deformations of the face, either those caused by trauma or birth defects as an alternative to reconstructive surgery. They can be used for smaller applications such as ears or noses, or full face masks. These prosthetics can provide both medical benefits such as improved speech and hearing as well as psychological benefits to the wearer.

<doc id="262233" wikidata="Q80880" url="?curid=262233" title="1997 Asian financial crisis">
<text>The 1997 Asian financial crisis was a period of financial crisis that gripped much of East and Southeast Asia during the late 1990s. The crisis began in Thailand in July 1997 before spreading to several other countries with a ripple effect, raising fears of a worldwide economic meltdown due to financial contagion. However, the recovery in 1998–1999 was rapid, and worries of a meltdown quickly subsided.

Originating in Thailand, where it was known as the &quot;Tom Yum Kung crisis&quot; () on 2 July, it followed the financial collapse of the Thai baht after the Thai government was forced to float the baht due to lack of foreign currency to support its currency peg to the U.S. dollar. Capital flight ensued almost immediately, beginning an international chain reaction. At the time, Thailand had acquired a burden of foreign debt. As the crisis spread, other Southeast Asian countries and later Japan and South Korea saw slumping currencies, devalued stock markets and other asset prices, and a precipitous rise in private debt. Foreign debt-to-GDP ratios rose from 100% to 167% in the four large Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economies in 1993–96, then shot up beyond 180% during the worst of the crisis. In South Korea, the ratios rose from 13% to 21% and then as high as 40%, while the other northern newly industrialized countries fared much better. Only in Thailand and South Korea did debt service-to-exports ratios rise.

South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand were the countries most affected by the crisis. Hong Kong, Laos, Malaysia and the Philippines were also hurt by the slump. Brunei, mainland China, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam were less affected, although all suffered from a general loss of demand and confidence throughout the region. Although most of the governments of Asia had seemingly sound fiscal policies, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stepped in to initiate a $40 billion program to stabilize the currencies of South Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia, economies particularly hard hit by the crisis.

However, the efforts to stem a global economic crisis did little to stabilize the domestic situation in Indonesia. After 30 years in power, Indonesian dictator Suharto was forced to step down on 21 May 1998 in the wake of widespread rioting that followed sharp price increases caused by a drastic devaluation of the rupiah. The effects of the crisis lingered through 1998, where many important stocks fell in Wall Street as a result of a dip in the values of the currencies of Russia and Latin American countries that weakened those countries&#x27; &quot;demand for U.S. exports.&quot; In 1998, growth in the Philippines dropped to virtually zero. Only Singapore proved relatively insulated from the shock, but nevertheless suffered serious hits in passing, mainly due to its status as a major financial hub and its geographical proximity to Malaysia and Indonesia. By 1999, however, analysts saw signs that the economies of Asia were beginning to recover. After the crisis, economies in East and Southeast Asia worked together toward financial stability and better financial supervision.

==Credit bubbles and fixed currency exchange rates==

The causes of the debacle are many and disputed. Thailand&#x27;s economy developed into an economic bubble fueled by hot money. More and more was required as the size of the bubble grew. The same type of situation happened in Malaysia and Indonesia, which had the added complication of what was called &quot;crony capitalism&quot;. The short-term capital flow was expensive and often highly conditioned for quick profit. Development money went in a largely uncontrolled manner to certain people only – not necessarily the best suited or most efficient, but those closest to the centers of power. Weak corporate governance also led to inefficient investment and declining profitability.

Until 1999, Asia attracted almost half of the total capital inflow into developing countries. The economies of Southeast Asia in particular maintained high interest rates attractive to foreign investors looking for a high rate of return. As a result, the region&#x27;s economies received a large inflow of money and experienced a dramatic run-up in asset prices. At the same time, the regional economies of Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and South Korea experienced high growth rates, of 8–12% GDP, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This achievement was widely acclaimed by financial institutions including IMF and World Bank, and was known as part of the &quot;Asian economic miracle&quot;.

In the mid-1990s, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea had large private current account deficits, and the maintenance of fixed exchange rates encouraged external borrowing and led to excessive exposure to foreign exchange risk in both the financial and corporate sectors.

In the mid-1990s, a series of external shocks began to change the economic environment. The devaluation of the Chinese renminbi and the Japanese yen, subsequent to the latter&#x27;s strengthening due to the Plaza Accord of 1985, the raising of U.S. interest rates which led to a strong U.S. dollar, and the sharp decline in semiconductor prices, all adversely affected their growth. As the U.S. economy recovered from a recession in the early 1990s, the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank under Alan Greenspan began to raise U.S. interest rates to head off inflation.

This made the United States a more attractive investment destination relative to Southeast Asia, which had been attracting hot money flows through high short-term interest rates, and raised the value of the U.S. dollar. For the Southeast Asian nations which had currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar, the higher U.S. dollar caused their own exports to become more expensive and less competitive in the global markets. At the same time, Southeast Asia&#x27;s export growth slowed dramatically in the spring of 1996, deteriorating their current account position.

Some economists have advanced the growing exports of China as a factor contributing to ASEAN nations&#x27; export growth slowdown, though these economists maintain the main cause of their crises was excessive real estate speculation. China had begun to compete effectively with other Asian exporters particularly in the 1990s after the implementation of a number of export-oriented reforms. Other economists dispute China&#x27;s impact, noting that both ASEAN and China experienced simultaneous rapid export growth in the early 1990s.

Many economists believe that the Asian crisis was created not by market psychology or technology, but by policies that distorted incentives within the lender–borrower relationship. The resulting large quantities of credit that became available generated a highly leveraged economic climate, and pushed up asset prices to an unsustainable level, particularly those in non-productive sectors of the economy such as real-estate. These asset prices eventually began to collapse, causing individuals and companies to default on debt obligations.

==Panic among lenders and withdrawal of credit==
The resulting panic among lenders led to a large withdrawal of credit from the crisis countries, causing a credit crunch and further bankruptcies. In addition, as foreign investors attempted to withdraw their money, the exchange market was flooded with the currencies of the crisis countries, putting depreciative pressure on their exchange rates. To prevent currency values collapsing, these countries&#x27; governments raised domestic interest rates to exceedingly high levels (to help diminish flight of capital by making lending more attractive to investors) and intervened in the exchange market, buying up any excess domestic currency at the fixed exchange rate with foreign reserves. Neither of these policy responses could be sustained for long, as several countries had insufficient levels of foreign exchange reserves.
Very high interest rates, which can be extremely damaging to a healthy economy, wreaked further havoc on economies in an already fragile state, while the central banks were hemorrhaging foreign reserves, of which they had finite amounts. When it became clear that the tide of capital fleeing these countries was not to be stopped, the authorities ceased defending their fixed exchange rates and allowed their currencies to float. The resulting depreciated value of those currencies meant that foreign currency-denominated liabilities grew substantially in domestic currency terms, causing more bankruptcies and further deepening the crisis.

Other economists, including Joseph Stiglitz and Jeffrey Sachs, have downplayed the role of the real economy in the crisis compared to the financial markets. The rapidity with which the crisis happened has prompted Sachs and others to compare it to a classic bank run prompted by a sudden risk shock. Sachs pointed to strict monetary and contractionary fiscal policies implemented by the governments on the advice of the IMF in the wake of the crisis, while Frederic Mishkin points to the role of asymmetric information in the financial markets that led to a &quot;herd mentality&quot; among investors that magnified a small risk in the real economy. The crisis has thus attracted attention from behavioral economists interested in market psychology.

Another possible cause of the sudden risk shock may also be attributable to the handover of Hong Kong sovereignty on 1 July 1997. During the 1990s, hot money flew into the Southeast Asia region through financial hubs, especially Hong Kong. The investors were often ignorant of the actual fundamentals or risk profiles of the respective economies, and once the crisis gripped the region, the political uncertainty regarding the future of Hong Kong as an Asian financial centre led some investors to withdraw from Asia altogether. This shrink in investments only worsened the financial conditions in Asia (subsequently leading to the depreciation of the Thai baht on 2 July 1997).

Several case studies on the topic of the application of network analysis of a financial system help to explain the interconnectivity of financial markets, as well as the significance of the robustness of hubs (or main nodes). Any negative externalities in the hubs creates a ripple effect through the financial system and the economy (as well as any connected economies) as a whole.

The foreign ministers of the 10 ASEAN countries believed that the well co-ordinated manipulation of their currencies was a deliberate attempt to destabilize the ASEAN economies. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad accused George Soros and other currency traders of ruining Malaysia&#x27;s economy with currency speculation. Soros claims to have been a buyer of the ringgit during its fall, having sold it short in 1997.

At the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting held in Subang Jaya, Malaysia, the foreign ministers issued a joint declaration on 25 July 1997 expressing serious concern and called for further intensification of ASEAN&#x27;s cooperation to safeguard and promote ASEAN&#x27;s interest in this regard. Coincidentally, on that same day, the central bankers of most of the affected countries were at the EMEAP (Executive Meeting of East Asia Pacific) meeting in Shanghai, and they failed to make the &quot;New Arrangement to Borrow&quot; operational. A year earlier, the finance ministers of these same countries had attended the 3rd APEC finance ministers meeting in Kyoto, Japan, on 17 March 1996, and according to that joint declaration, they had been unable to double the amounts available under the &quot;General Agreement to Borrow&quot; and the &quot;Emergency Finance Mechanism&quot;.

==IMF role==
The scope and the severity of the collapses led to an urgent need for outside intervention. Since the countries melting down were among the richest in their region, and in the world, and since hundreds of billions of dollars were at stake, any response to the crisis was likely to be cooperative and international. The International Monetary Fund created a series of bailouts (&quot;rescue packages&quot;) for the most-affected economies to enable them to avoid default, tying the packages to currency, banking and financial system reforms. Due to IMF&#x27;s involvement in the financial crisis, the term IMF Crisis became a way to refer to the Asian Financial Crisis in countries that were affected.

===Economic reforms===
The IMF&#x27;s support was conditional on a series of economic reforms, the &quot;structural adjustment package&quot; (SAP). The SAPs called on crisis-struck nations to reduce government spending and deficits, allow insolvent banks and financial institutions to fail, and aggressively raise interest rates. The reasoning was that these steps would restore confidence in the nations&#x27; fiscal solvency, penalize insolvent companies, and protect currency values. Above all, it was stipulated that IMF-funded capital had to be administered rationally in the future, with no favored parties receiving funds by preference. In at least one of the affected countries the restrictions on foreign ownership were greatly reduced.

There were to be adequate government controls set up to supervise all financial activities, ones that were to be independent, in theory, of private interest. Insolvent institutions had to be closed, and insolvency itself had to be clearly defined. In addition, financial systems were to become &quot;transparent&quot;, that is, provide the kind of financial information used in the West to make financial decisions.

As countries fell into crisis, many local businesses and governments that had taken out loans in US dollars, which suddenly became much more expensive relative to the local currency which formed their earned income, found themselves unable to pay their creditors. The dynamics of the situation were similar to that of the Latin American debt crisis. The effects of the SAPs were mixed and their impact controversial. Critics, however, noted the contractionary nature of these policies, arguing that in a recession, the traditional Keynesian response was to increase government spending, prop up major companies, and lower interest rates.

The reasoning was that by stimulating the economy and staving off recession, governments could restore confidence while preventing economic loss. They pointed out that the U.S. government had pursued expansionary policies, such as lowering interest rates, increasing government spending, and cutting taxes, when the United States itself entered a recession in 2001, and arguably the same in the fiscal and monetary policies during the 2008–2009 Global Financial Crisis.

Many commentators in retrospect criticized the IMF for encouraging the developing economies of Asia down the path of &quot;fast-track capitalism&quot;, meaning liberalization of the financial sector (elimination of restrictions on capital flows), maintenance of high domestic interest rates to attract portfolio investment and bank capital, and pegging of the national currency to the dollar to reassure foreign investors against currency risk.

===IMF and high interest rates===
The conventional high-interest-rate economic strategy is normally employed by monetary authorities to attain the chain objectives of tightened money supply, discouraged currency speculation, stabilized exchange rate, curbed currency depreciation, and ultimately contained inflation.

In the Asian meltdown, highest IMF officials rationalized their prescribed high interest rates as follows:

From then IMF First Deputy managing director, Stanley Fischer in 1998:

When their governments &quot;approached the IMF, the reserves of Thailand and South Korea were perilously low, and the Indonesian Rupiah was excessively depreciated. Thus, the first order of business was... to restore confidence in the currency. To achieve this, countries have to make it more attractive to hold domestic currency, which in turn, requires increasing interest rates temporarily, even if higher interest costs complicate the situation of weak banks and corporations...

Why not operate with lower interest rates and a greater devaluation? This is a relevant tradeoff, but there can be no question that the degree of devaluation in the Asian countries is excessive, both from the viewpoint of the individual countries, and from the viewpoint of the international system. Looking first to the individual country, companies with substantial foreign currency debts, as so many companies in these countries have, stood to suffer far more from… currency (depreciation) than from a temporary rise in domestic interest rates…. Thus, on macroeconomics… monetary policy has to be kept tight to restore confidence in the currency...

From the then IMF managing director Michel Camdessus:

To reverse (currency depreciation), countries have to make it more attractive to hold domestic currency, and that means temporarily raising interest rates, even if this (hurts) weak banks and corporations.

==Countries/Regions affected==
===Thailand===
From 1985 to 1996, Thailand&#x27;s economy grew at an average of over 9% per year, the highest economic growth rate of any country at the time. Inflation was kept reasonably low within a range of 3.4–5.7%. The baht was pegged at 25 to the U.S. dollar.

On 14 and 15 May 1997, the Thai baht was hit by massive speculative attacks. On 30 June 1997, Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh said that he would not devalue the baht. However, Thailand lacked the foreign reserves to support the USD–Baht currency peg, and the Thai government was eventually forced to float the Baht, on 2 July 1997, allowing the value of the Baht to be set by the currency market. This caused a chain reaction of events, eventually culminating into a region-wide crisis.

Thailand&#x27;s booming economy came to a halt amid massive layoffs in finance, real estate, and construction that resulted in huge numbers of workers returning to their villages in the countryside and 600,000 foreign workers being sent back to their home countries. The baht devalued swiftly and lost more than half of its value. The baht reached its lowest point of 56 units to the U.S. dollar in January 1998. The Thai stock market dropped 75%. Finance One, the largest Thai finance company until then, collapsed.

On 11 August 1997, the IMF unveiled a rescue package for Thailand with more than $17 billion, subject to conditions such as passing laws relating to bankruptcy (reorganizing and restructuring) procedures and establishing strong regulation frameworks for banks and other financial institutions. The IMF approved on 20 August 1997, another bailout package of $2.9 billion.

Poverty and inequality increased while employment, wages and social welfare all declined as a result of the crisis.

Following the 1997 Asian financial crisis, income in the northeast, the poorest part of the country, rose by 46 percent from 1998 to 2006. Nationwide poverty fell from 21.3 to 11.3 percent. Thailand&#x27;s Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, fell from .525 in 2000 to .499 in 2004 (it had risen from 1996 to 2000) versus 1997 Asian financial crisis.

By 2001, Thailand&#x27;s economy had recovered. The increasing tax revenues allowed the country to balance its budget and repay its debts to the IMF in 2003, four years ahead of schedule. The Thai baht continued to appreciate to 29 Baht to the U.S. dollar in October 2010.

===Indonesia===

In June 1997, Indonesia seemed far from crisis. Unlike Thailand, Indonesia had low inflation, a trade surplus of more than $900 million, huge foreign exchange reserves of more than $20 billion, and a good banking sector. However, a large number of Indonesian corporations had been borrowing in U.S. dollars. This practice had worked well for these corporations during the preceding years, as the rupiah had strengthened respective to the dollar; their effective levels of debt and financing costs had decreased as the local currency&#x27;s value rose.

In July 1997, when Thailand floated the baht, Indonesia&#x27;s monetary authorities widened the rupiah currency trading band from 8% to 12%. As a result, the rupiah suddenly came under severe attack in August. Therefore, on the 14th of the month, the managed floating exchange regime was replaced by a free-floating exchange rate arrangement. The rupiah dropped further due to the shift. The IMF came forward with a rescue package of $23 billion, but the rupiah was sinking further amid fears over corporate debts, massive selling of rupiah, and strong demand for dollars. The rupiah and the Jakarta Stock Exchange touched a historic low in September. Moody&#x27;s eventually downgraded Indonesia&#x27;s long-term debt to &quot;junk bond&quot;.

Although the rupiah crisis began in July and August 1997, it intensified in November when the effects of that summer devaluation showed up on corporate balance sheets. Companies that had borrowed in dollars had to face the higher costs imposed upon them by the rupiah&#x27;s decline, and many reacted by buying dollars through selling rupiah, undermining the value of the latter further. Before the crisis, the exchange rate between the rupiah and the dollar was roughly 2,600 rupiah to 1 U.S. dollar. The rate plunged to over 11,000 rupiah to 1 U.S. dollar on 9 January 1998, with spot rates over 14,000 during 23–26 January and trading again over 14,000 for about six weeks during June–July 1998. On 31 December 1998, the rate was almost exactly 8,000 to 1 U.S. dollar. Indonesia lost 13.5% of its GDP that year.

In February 1998, President Suharto sacked the incumbent Bank Indonesia governor, J. Soedradjad Djiwandono, but this proved insufficient. Amidst widespread rioting in May 1998, Suharto resigned under public pressure and Vice President B. J. Habibie replaced him.

As a result of the financial crisis that hit the country, many factors arising from all aspects, including sports broadcasting on Indonesian television, including:

*ANTV lost their television rights to broadcast the 1998 Formula One World Championship despite their Formula One broadcasting rights contract in Indonesia lasting until 1999; as a result, the 1998 season was not aired on Indonesian television. RCTI finally re-secured the broadcast rights for the to season.
*ANTV also stopped the coverage of 1997–98 Serie A, 1997–98 Bundesliga, and the 1997–98 La Liga, before the end of their respective seasons. However, it did not affect the 1997–98 FA Premier League, as they had already broadcast it up to the end of the season.
*All television stations had limited broadcast schedules, with an average closedown at 11:30 pm or 12:00 am.

Additionally, the Indonesian motorcycle Grand Prix, which was held at Sentul, was dropped from the 1998 Superbike and MotoGP calendars. World Rally Championship also dropped the Rally Indonesia from their 1998 calendar.

===South Korea===
The banking sector was burdened with non-performing loans as its large corporations were funding aggressive expansions. During that time, there was a haste to build great conglomerates to compete on the world stage. Many businesses ultimately failed to ensure returns and profitability. The chaebol, South Korean conglomerates, simply absorbed more and more capital investment. Eventually, excess debt led to major failures and takeovers.
Amongst other stimuli, the crisis resulted in the bankruptcy of major Korean companies, provoking not only corporations, but also government officials towards corruption. The Hanbo scandal of early 1997 exposed South Korea&#x27;s economic weaknesses and corruption problems to the international financial community. Later that year, in July, South Korea&#x27;s third-largest car maker, Kia Motors, asked for emergency loans. The domino effect of collapsing large South Korean companies drove the interest rates up and international investors away.

In the wake of the Asian market downturn, Moody&#x27;s lowered the credit rating of South Korea from A1 to A3, on 28 November 1997, and downgraded again to B2 on 11 December. That contributed to a further decline in South Korean shares since stock markets were already bearish in November. The Seoul stock exchange fell by 4% on 7 November 1997. On 8 November, it plunged by 7%, its biggest one-day drop to that date. And on 24 November, stocks fell a further 7.2% on fears that the IMF would demand tough reforms. In 1998, Hyundai Motor Company took over Kia Motors. Samsung Motors&#x27; $5 billion venture was dissolved due to the crisis, and eventually Daewoo Motors was sold to the American company General Motors (GM).

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided US$58.4 billion as a bailout package. In return, Korea was required to take restructuring measures. The ceiling on foreign investment in Korean companies was raised from 26 percent to 100 percent. In addition, the Korean government started financial sector reform program. Under the program, 787 insolvent financial institutions were closed or merged by June 2003. The number of financial institutions in which foreign investors invested has increased rapidly. Examples include New Bridge Capital&#x27;s takeover of Korea First Bank.

The South Korean won, meanwhile, weakened to more than 1,700 per U.S. dollar from around 800, but later managed to recover. However, like the chaebol, South Korea&#x27;s government did not escape unscathed. Its national debt-to-GDP ratio more than doubled (approximately 13% to 30%) as a result of the crisis.

===Philippines===
In May 1997, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the country&#x27;s central bank, raised interest rates by 1.75 percentage points and again by 2 points on 19 June. Thailand triggered the crisis on 2 July and on 3 July, the Bangko Sentral intervened to defend the peso, raising the overnight rate from 15% to 32% at the onset of the Asian crisis in mid-July 1997. The peso dropped from 26 pesos per dollar at the start of the crisis to 46.50 pesos in early 1998 to 53 pesos as in July 2001.

The Philippine GDP contracted by 0.6% during the worst part of the crisis, but grew by 3% by 2001, despite scandals of the administration of Joseph Estrada in 2001, most notably the &quot;jueteng&quot; scandal, causing the PSE Composite Index, the main index of the Philippine Stock Exchange, to fall to 1,000 points from a high of 3,448 points in 1997. The peso&#x27;s value declined to around 55.75 pesos to the U.S. dollar. Later that year, Estrada was on the verge of impeachment but his allies in the senate voted against continuing the proceedings.

This led to popular protests culminating in the &quot;EDSA II Revolution&quot;, which effected his resignation and elevated Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to the presidency. During her presidency, the crisis in the country lessened. The Philippine peso rose to about 50 pesos by the year&#x27;s end and traded at around 41 pesos to a dollar in late 2007. The stock market also reached an all-time high in 2007 (surpassed by February 2018) and the economy was growing by more than 7 percent, its highest in nearly two decades.

===China===
China&#x27;s nonconvertible capital account and its foreign exchange control were decisive in limiting the impact of the crisis.

The Chinese currency, the renminbi (RMB), had been pegged in 1994 to the U.S. dollar at a ratio of 8.3 RMB to the dollar. Having largely kept itself above the fray throughout 1997–1998, there was heavy speculation in the Western press that China would soon be forced to devalue its currency to protect the competitiveness of its exports vis-a-vis those of the ASEAN nations, whose exports became cheaper relative to China&#x27;s. However, the RMB&#x27;s non-convertibility protected its value from currency speculators, and the decision was made to maintain the peg of the currency, thereby improving the country&#x27;s standing within Asia. The currency peg was partly scrapped in July 2005, rising 2.3% against the dollar, reflecting pressure from the United States.

Unlike investments of many of the Southeast Asian nations, almost all of China&#x27;s foreign investment took the form of factories on the ground rather than securities, which insulated the country from rapid capital flight. While China was unaffected by the crisis compared to Southeast Asia and South Korea, GDP growth slowed sharply in 1998 and 1999, calling attention to structural problems within its economy. In particular, the Asian financial crisis convinced the Chinese government of the need to resolve the issues of its enormous financial weaknesses, such as having too many non-performing loans within its banking system, and relying heavily on trade with the United States.

Other Asian countries harshly affected by the crisis sought the United States or Japan to bail them out of the difficult economic conditions. As the United States and Japan moved slowly, China made a highly regarded symbolic gesture by refusing to devalue its own currency (which presumably would have touched off a series of competitive devaluations with serious consequences for the region). Instead, China contributed $4 billion to neighboring countries via a combination of bilateral bailouts and contributing to IMF bailout packages.

In 1999, as a result of these actions, the World Bank described China as a &quot;source of stability for the region&quot; in one of its reports.

The Asian Financial Crisis helped solidify Chinese policymakers&#x27; views that China should not move towards a liberal market economy, and that its reform and opening up should focus on tightening financial regulations and resisting foreign pressures to open the country&#x27;s financial markets prematurely.Lessons learned by policymakers following the financial crisis also became an important factor in China&#x27;s evolving approach to managing state-owned assets, particularly its foreign exchange reserves, and its creation of sovereign funds beginning with Central Huijin.

===Hong Kong===
In October 1997, the Hong Kong dollar, which had been pegged at 7.8 to the U.S. dollar since 1983, came under speculative pressure because Hong Kong&#x27;s inflation rate had been significantly higher than the United States&#x27; for years. Monetary authorities spent more than $1 billion to defend the local currency. Since Hong Kong had more than $80 billion in foreign reserves, which is equivalent to 700% of its M1 money supply and 45% of its M3 money supply, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA, effectively the region&#x27;s central bank) managed to maintain the peg.

Stock markets became more and more volatile; between 20 and 23 October the Hang Seng Index dropped 23%. The HKMA then promised to protect the currency. On 23 October 1997, it raised overnight interest rates from 8% to 23%, and at one point to 280%. The HKMA had recognized that speculators were taking advantage of the city&#x27;s unique currency-board system, in which overnight rates (HIBOR) automatically increase in proportion to large net sales of the local currency. The rate hike, however, increased downward pressure on the stock market, allowing speculators to profit by short selling shares. The HKMA started buying component shares of the Hang Seng Index in mid-August 1998.

The HKMA and Donald Tsang, the then Financial Secretary, declared war on speculators. The Government ended up buying approximately HK$120 billion (US$15 billion) worth of shares in various companies, and became the largest shareholder of some of those companies (e.g., the government owned 10% of HSBC) at the end of August, when hostilities ended with the closing of the August Hang Seng Index futures contract. In 1999, the Government started selling those shares by launching the Tracker Fund of Hong Kong, making a profit of about HK$30 billion (US$4 billion).

===Malaysia===
In July 1997, within days of the Thai baht devaluation, the Malaysian ringgit was heavily traded by speculators. The overnight rate jumped from under 8% to over 40%. This led to rating downgrades and a general sell off on the stock and currency markets. By end of 1997, ratings had fallen many notches from investment grade to junk, the KLSE had lost more than 50% from above 1,200 to under 600, and the ringgit had lost 50% of its value, falling from above 2.50 to under 4.57 on (23 January 1998) to the dollar. The then prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad imposed strict capital controls and introduced a 3.80 peg against the U.S. dollar.

Malaysian moves involved fixing the local currency to the U.S. dollar, stopping the overseas trade in ringgit currency and other ringgit assets therefore making offshore use of the ringgit invalid, restricting the amount of currency and investments that residents can take abroad, and imposed for foreign portfolio funds, a minimum one-year &quot;stay period&quot; which since has been converted to an exit tax. The decision to make ringgit held abroad invalid has also dried up sources of ringgit held abroad that speculators borrow from to manipulate the ringgit, for example by &quot;selling short&quot;. Those who did, had to repurchase the limited ringgit at higher prices, making it unattractive to them. It also fully suspended the trading of CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) counters, indefinitely freezing approximately $4.47 billion worth of shares and affecting 172,000 investors, most of them Singaporeans, which became a political issue between the two countries.

In 1998, the output of the real economy declined plunging the country into its first recession for many years. The construction sector contracted 23.5%, manufacturing shrunk 9% and the agriculture sector 5.9%. Overall, the country&#x27;s gross domestic product plunged 6.2% in 1998. During that year, the ringgit plunged below 4.7 and the KLSE fell below 270 points. In September that year, various defensive measures were announced to overcome the crisis.

The principal measure taken were to move the ringgit from a free float to a fixed exchange rate regime. Bank Negara fixed the ringgit at 3.8 to the dollar. Capital controls were imposed while aid offered from the IMF was refused. Various task force agencies were formed. The Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee dealt with corporate loans. Danaharta discounted and bought bad loans from banks to facilitate orderly asset realization. Danamodal recapitalized banks.

Growth then settled at a slower but more sustainable pace. The massive current account deficit became a fairly substantial surplus. Banks were better capitalized and NPLs were realised in an orderly way. Small banks were bought out by strong ones. A large number of PLCs were unable to regulate their financial affairs and were delisted. Compared to the 1997 current account, by 2005, Malaysia was estimated to have a $14.06 billion surplus. Asset values however, have not returned to their pre-crisis highs. Foreign investor confidence was still low, partially due to the lack of transparency shown in how the CLOB counters had been dealt with.

In 2005 the last of the crisis measures were removed as taken off the fixed exchange system. But unlike the pre-crisis days, it did not appear to be a free float, but a managed float, like the Singapore dollar.

===Mongolia===
Mongolia was adversely affected by the crisis and suffered a further loss of income as a result of the Russian crisis in 1999. Economic growth picked up in 1997–99 after stalling in 1996 due to a series of natural disasters and increases in world prices of copper and cashmere. Public revenues and exports collapsed in 1998 and 1999 due to the repercussions of the Asian financial crisis. In August and September 1999, the economy suffered from a temporary Russian ban on exports of oil and oil products. Mongolia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1997. The international donor community pledged over $300 million per year at the last Consultative Group Meeting, held in Ulaanbaatar in June 1999.

===Singapore===
As the financial crisis spread, the economy of Singapore dipped into a short recession. The short duration and milder effect on its economy was credited to the active management by the government. For example, the Monetary Authority of Singapore allowed for a gradual 20% depreciation of the Singapore dollar to cushion and guide the economy to a soft landing. The timing of government programs such as the Interim Upgrading Program and other construction related projects were brought forward.

Instead of allowing the labor markets to work, the National Wage Council pre-emptively agreed to Central Provident Fund cuts to lower labor costs, with limited impact on disposable income and local demand. Unlike in Hong Kong, no attempt was made to directly intervene in the capital markets and the &quot;Straits Times&quot; Index was allowed to drop 60%. In less than a year, the Singaporean economy fully recovered and continued on its growth trajectory.

=== Japan===
The crisis had also put pressure on Japan, whose economy is particularly prominent in the region. Asian countries usually ran a trade deficit with Japan. The Japanese yen fell to 147 as mass selling began, but Japan was the world&#x27;s largest holder of currency reserves at the time, so it was easily defended, and quickly bounced back. A run on the banks was narrowly averted on 26 November 1997 when TV networks decided not to report on long queues that had formed outside banks, before the central bank had ordered that they be let in. The real GDP growth rate slowed dramatically in 1997, from 5% to 1.6%, and even sank into recession in 1998 due to intense competition from cheapened rivals; also in 1998 the government had to bail out several banks. The Asian financial crisis also led to more bankruptcies in Japan. In addition, with South Korea&#x27;s devalued currency and China&#x27;s steady gains, many companies complained outright that they could not compete.

According to Van Sant et al., in August 1997, Japan proposed the establishment of an Asian Monetary Fund (AMF) to address the Asian currency crisis. Japan aimed to reduce its dependence on the United States and increase its autonomy in economic, security, and diplomatic matters. However, the AMF proposal was abandoned due to strong objections from the United States and indifference from China. Instead, Japan announced plans for cooperation loans with international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. In October 1998, Japan proposed providing $30 billion to support Asia, and in December 1998, it proposed a total of $600 billion in special yen credits over the next three years.

A longer-term result was the changing relationship between the United States and Japan, with the United States no longer openly supporting the highly artificial trade environment and exchange rates that governed economic relations between the two countries for almost five decades after World War II.

=== United States ===
The U.S. Treasury was deeply involved with the IMF in finding solutions. The American markets were severely hit. On 27 October 1997, the Dow Jones industrial plunged 554 points or 7.2%, amid ongoing worries about the Asian economies. During the crisis, it fell 12%. The crisis led to a drop in consumer and spending confidence (see 27 October 1997 mini-crash). Nevertheless, the economy grew at a very robust 4.5% for the entire year, and did very well in 1998 as well.

==Consequences==
===Asia===
The crisis had significant macroeconomic-level effects, including sharp reductions in values of currencies, stock markets, and other asset prices of several Asian countries. The nominal U.S. dollar GDP of ASEAN fell by $9.2 billion in 1997 and $218.2 billion (31.7%) in 1998. In South Korea, the $170.9 billion fall in 1998 was equal to 33.1% of the 1997 GDP. Many businesses collapsed, and as a consequence, millions of people fell below the poverty line in 1997–1998. Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand were the countries most affected by the crisis.


The above tabulation shows that despite the prompt raising of interest rates to 32% in the Philippines upon the onset of crisis in mid-July 1997, and to 65% in Indonesia upon the intensification of crisis in 1998, their local currencies depreciated just the same and did not perform better than those of South Korea, Thailand, and Malaysia, which countries had their high interest rates set at generally lower than 20% during the Asian crisis. This created grave doubts on the credibility of IMF and the validity of its high-interest-rate prescription to economic crisis.

The economic crisis also led to a political upheaval, most notably culminating in the resignations of President Suharto in Indonesia and Prime Minister General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh in Thailand. There was a general rise in anti-Western sentiment, with George Soros and the IMF in particular singled out as targets of criticisms. Heavy U.S. investment in Thailand ended, replaced by mostly European investment, though Japanese investment was sustained. Islamic and other separatist movements intensified in Southeast Asia as central authorities weakened.

New regulations weakened the influence of the bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese family-owned businesses that dominate the private sector of Southeast Asia. After the crisis, business relationships were more frequently based on contracts, rather than the trust and family ties of the traditional bamboo network.

More long-term consequences included reversal of some gains made in the boom years just preceding the crisis. Nominal U.S. dollar GNP per capita fell 42.3% in Indonesia in 1997, 21.2% in Thailand, 19% in Malaysia, 18.5% in South Korea and 12.5% in the Philippines. Falls in income per capita with purchasing power parity were much smaller: in Indonesia by 15%, Thailand 12%, Malaysia 10%, South Korea 6%, Philippines 3%. In most countries recovery was fast. Between 1999 and 2005 average per capita annual growth was 8.2%, investment growth nearly 9%, foreign direct investment 17.5%. Precrisis levels of income per capita with purchasing power parity were exceeded in 1999 in South Korea, in 2000 in Philippines, in 2002 in Malaysia and Thailand, in 2005 in Indonesia. Within East Asia, the bulk of investment and a significant amount of economic weight shifted from Japan and ASEAN to China and India.

The crisis has been intensively analyzed by economists for its breadth, speed, and dynamism; it affected dozens of countries, had a direct impact on the livelihood of millions, happened within the course of a mere few months, and at each stage of the crisis leading economists, in particular the international institutions, seemed a step behind. Perhaps more interesting to economists was the speed with which it ended, leaving most of the developed economies unharmed. These curiosities have prompted an explosion of literature about financial economics and a litany of explanations why the crisis occurred. A number of critiques have been leveled against the conduct of the IMF in the crisis, including one by former World Bank economist Joseph Stiglitz. Politically there were some benefits. In several countries, particularly South Korea and Indonesia, there was renewed push for improved corporate governance. Rampaging inflation weakened the authority of the Suharto regime and led to its toppling in 1998, as well as accelerating East Timor&#x27;s independence.

It is believed that 10,400 people committed suicide in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea as a result of the crisis.

In August 2001, the International Labour Organization arranged the Thirteenth Asian Regional Meeting with 39 member states as a result of the financial crisis. It focused on providing social protection, rights at work and creating new jobs.

===Outside Asia===

After the Asian crisis, international investors were reluctant to lend to developing countries, leading to economic slowdowns in developing countries in many parts of the world. The powerful negative shock also sharply reduced the price of oil, which reached a low of about $11 per barrel towards the end of 1998, causing a financial pinch in OPEC nations and other oil exporters. In response to a severe fall in oil prices, the supermajors that emerged in the late-1990s, undertook some major mergers and acquisitions between 1998 and 2002 – often in an effort to improve economies of scale, hedge against oil price volatility, and reduce large cash reserves through reinvestment.

The reduction in oil revenue also contributed to the 1998 Russian financial crisis, which in turn caused Long-Term Capital Management in the United States to collapse after losing $4.6 billion in 4 months. A wider collapse in the financial markets was avoided when Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a $3.625 billion bailout. Major emerging economies Brazil and Argentina also fell into crisis in the late 1990s (see 1998–2002 Argentine great depression). The September 11 attacks contributed to major shockwave in developed and developing economies (see Stock market downturn of 2002)

The crisis in general was part of a global backlash against the Washington Consensus and institutions such as the IMF and World Bank, which simultaneously became unpopular in developed countries following the rise of the anti-globalization movement in 1999. It was a major cause for the beginning of the current anti-globalism movement and many nationalist movements. Four major rounds of world trade talks since the crisis, in Seattle, Doha, Cancún, and Hong Kong, have failed to produce a significant agreement as developing countries have become more assertive, and nations are increasingly turning toward regional or bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) as an alternative to global institutions.

Many nations learned from this, and quickly built up foreign exchange reserves as a hedge against attacks, including Japan, China, South Korea. Pan Asian currency swaps were introduced in the event of another crisis. China, in particular, bought up the government debt of the United States to protect itself. However, nations such as Brazil, Russia, and India as well as most of East Asia began copying the Japanese model of weakening their currencies, and restructuring their economies so as to create a current account surplus to build large foreign currency reserves. This has led to ever-increasing funding for U.S. treasury bonds, allowing or aiding housing (in 2001–2005) and stock asset bubbles (in 1996–2000) to develop in the United States, setting the factors that led to the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

<text>Pierre-Esprit Radisson (1636/1640–1710) was a French coureur des bois and explorer in New France. He is often linked to his brother-in-law Médard des Groseilliers. The decision of Radisson and Groseilliers to enter the English service led to the formation of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. His career was particularly notable for its repeated transitions between serving Britain and France.

There is no image of him other than that provided in his writings and those of the people who encountered him in New France, in Paris on the fringes of the court, on remote Hudson Bay, and in late Stuart London. Radisson should be considered in multiple contexts; for his achievement as a narrator of his own life, the range of his explorations, his experiences among the Indigenous peoples, and his social formation, both as a man of the early modern period for whom personal honour was an important value and as a working trader participating in the mercantile projects of the era. Radisson&#x27;s life and writings have been interpreted from many different perspectives. Many French Canadians until the twentieth century accepted the verdict of his French contemporaries that he was a traitor to France.

==Early life==

===Birth and emigration to New France===

Pierre-Esprit Radisson&#x27;s birthplace is unclear, but was likely in France&#x27;s lower Rhône region near the town Avignon. In a 1697 affidavit and a 1698 petition he reported his age as 61 and 62, respectively, suggesting birth in 1636. Yet a 1681 census in New France, Canada, reported his age as 41, suggesting birth in 1640. This coheres with baptismal records from Carpentras, a city near Avignon, that concern Radisson&#x27;s father, Pierre-Esprit Radisson Sr.

Radisson would trace his family, the Hayet-Radissons, to the town St. Malo, whereas records suggest either Paris or Avignon. According to Radisson, he emigrated from France to Canada on 24 May 1651. He may have arrived with his two sisters, Élisabeth and Françoise. They may also have been accompanied by their maternal half-sister Marguerite Hayet, who would eventually marry Radisson&#x27;s later fur-trading partner, Médard Chouart des Groseilliers. By sometime in 1651, these three women were living together in Trois-Rivières.

===Capture, adoption, and torture by Mohawk===
In 1651 or 1652, while hunting fowl near his Trois-Rivières home, Radisson became separated from his hunting group. After discovering its several men killed by a Mohawk raiding party, he was captured by the warriors. Perhaps because of his youth, he received fairly mild treatment and, as he showed interest in Mohawk language and culture, was adopted and assimilated. In the Mohawk custom of adopting young captives, whether indigenous or European, to replace relatives lost to disease or warfare, Radisson joined a local Mohawk family near modern-day Schenectady in New York.

Not long after Radisson&#x27;s integration, which took about six weeks, while out hunting with three Mohawk, he met an Algonquin man who convinced him to defect and return to Trois-Rivières. Together, they killed Radisson&#x27;s Mohawk companions, traveled 14 days, and sighted the town, but were captured by patrolling Mohawk. The Mohawk killed the Algonquin and subjected Radisson, along with some 20 prisoners, to ritual torture. His adoptive, Mohawk family advocated for him and materially compensated the bereaved families to spare him execution and temper his torture.

As the Iroquois despised cowardice and punished it with death, Radisson&#x27;s adoptive parents advised him to be brave and yet not too brave, since the Iroquois also sometimes ate the hearts of exceptionally brave men to acquire their courage. Radisson&#x27;s fingernails were pulled out while he was forced to sing, one finger was cut to the bone, and he watched ten Huron Indians get tortured to death. The next day, an old man burned Radisson, tied to a scaffold, and a young man drove a red-hot dagger through his foot. After three days of similar treatment, the Mohawk brought out Huron prisoners and, using tomahawks, bashed in the heads of some, whereas the rest were adopted by individual families.

Once eventually released, the overwhelmed Radisson found that, as he would recall, &quot;all my pains and griefs ceased, not feeling the least pain. [My father] bids me be merry, makes me sing, to which I consented with all my heart.&quot; He felt deep gratitude to his adoptive parents, whom he described as very loving, for saving his life. By Iroquois standards, Radisson&#x27;s torture had been moderate. Radisson recounts witnessing other torture: &quot;They burned a Frenchwoman; they pulled out her breasts, and took a child out of her belly, with they broyled [broiled] and made the mother eat it, so in short she died&quot;. Sometime after his own wounds healed, Radisson spent some five months on a war-party expedition.

===Departure from Iroquois and missionary work===

With other Mohawk warriors, Radisson traveled to a trading post at Fort Orange, then controlled by the Dutch, located in present-day Albany, New York. There, a governor recognized him as a Frenchman and offered to pay for his freedom. But Radisson returned to his Mohawk village. He escaped on 29 October 1653, &quot;at 8 of the clock in the morning&quot;. Reaching Fort Orange, he was hidden at a farm, then met a Jesuit priest Joseph Antoine Poncet, who made him &quot;a great offer&quot;, whereby he returned to Holland in early 1654 under an agreement now unclear but perhaps involving missionary work.

Later that year, 1654, Radisson returned to Trois-Rivières in New France. Over the next three years, he would embark on several missionary expeditions. His writings largely ignored this period, so little is known about his whereabouts during it, apart from a documented a deed of sale that he signed in November 1655. In 1657, Radisson accompanied a joint Franco–Iroquois expedition into Onondaga territory to aid a Jesuit priest named Simon Le Moyne operate his mission and to promote further fur trading. In 1658, under rising tensions with local Iroquois, the French left, ending the expedition. Radisson soon returned to Québec.

==Career==
Radisson&#x27;s biggest influence in Canadian history dates from the period of 1658 to 1684, when he was an active coureur-des-bois, fur trader, and explorer. In August 1659, Radisson persuaded his brother-in-law, Médard Chouart des Groseilliers, to hire him for his journey around Lake Superior. The year-long trip was planned to collect furs, in order to participate in the ever-lucrative fur trade.

In the winter of 1659–1660, Radisson and Des Groseilliers lived just south of Lake Superior in what is now Wisconsin, associating with groups of Huron, Ottawa, Ojibwa and Sioux (Dakota) Indians. When Radisson arrived at an Ojibwa village on the shores of Lake Superior, where he spent much of the winter, he later reported giving three types of presents: to the men, women and children of the village. He gave each of the men &quot;...a kettle, two hatchets [tomahawks], and six knives and a blade for a sword&quot;; the women &quot;...2 and 20 awls, 50 needles, 2 graters [scrapers] of castors, 2 ivory combs and 2 wooden ones, with red painte [vermilion], 6 looking-glasses of tin&quot;; and to the children &quot;...brasse rings, of small bells, and rasades [beads] of divers colors...&quot;. American historian Bruce White wrote that Radission and Des Groseilliers did not entirely understand Ojibwa society, as the kettles were typically used much more by the women for cooking than by the men. Giving paint and make-up only to women overlooked the fact that Ojibwa men used make-up and painted their faces just as much as Ojibwa women did. But Radisson may have learned that kettles were used prominently by the Huron in their Feast of the Dead, and thought that the Ojibwa men might use them in their own version of that feast.

On the other hand, White notes that the two Frenchmen clearly understood some aspects of Ojibwa gender roles very well: the gift of tomahawks for the men acknowledged that Ojibwa men were hunters and warriors, while the gift of awls for the women reflected that Ojibwa women gathered rice, gardened, cooked, fished, built bark houses, and wove mats. Ojibwa women also played important roles in the fur trade. Some married winter partners or traders, establishing relations that gave advantages to their bands. Others used their sexuality as a way of establishing informal relations with the French in order to ensure the continued supply of European goods and prevent the French from trading with other Indians.

Radisson reported on visiting one Ojibwa village in the spring of 1660, where there was a welcoming ceremony: &quot;The women throw themselves backward on the ground, thinking to give us tokens of friendship and wellcome [welcome]&quot;. Radisson was confused at first by what the action meant, but as the women started to engage in more overtly sexual behavior, he quickly realized what they were offering. Several tribal elders informed Radisson that they did not want him trading with their enemies, the Dakota [Sioux], and that he and Des Groseilliers were free to sleep with the unmarried women of the village on condition that they did not trade with the Dakota. As Radisson&#x27;s account was written for an English audience, he was vague as to whether he and Des Groseilliers took up this offer. 

When Radisson and Groseilliers returned to Québec on August 24, 1660, with many furs, the merchants waiting for them were delighted to be able to sail with the pelts to Europe, but the Governor was jealous of their success. In 1659 Groseilliers had met with Governor Pierre de Voyer d&#x27;Argenson to gain a year-long permit to explore New France; the governor granted it. Seeing the success of the trip and the number of furs they had brought back, d&#x27;Argenson levied high taxes on the men, ostensibly because they had exceeded the terms of their year-long permit by a couple of days.

After seeking unsuccessfully in the courts to regain what had been confiscated by the Governor, Radisson and Groseilliers decided to go to Boston in the English Thirteen Colonies for their next explorations. They would seek English financing there to support their expedition.

===Trade and journeys to Hudson Bay===

Throughout their 1659–1660 voyage, the French explorers had heard references to a &quot;salt sea&quot; as an area with an abundance of good furs. They determined the reference must be to Hudson Bay and began to seek financing and sea-going ships for their new explorations. They could reach this destination by travel on waters outside the continent, instead of through a number of internal rivers. The first voyage to Hudson Bay was unsuccessful since the winter of that year came early, and they judged their rations on board insufficient to survive it. The pair were forced to return to Boston but were promised two ships and crew for a second attempt the following year.

This second attempt was cancelled after one of the ships was destroyed in a storm. The two men were invited to England to meet King Charles II in 1665. There they passed the winter. In the spring, they left for the New World with ship&#x27;s crew that the king had promised them. The vessel &quot;Eaglet&quot;, which was carrying Radisson to Hudson&#x27;s Bay, nearly sank in an Atlantic storm and was forced to turn back to Plymouth, England. In September 1668, landed in the Rupert River region on the shores of James Bay, where Des Groseilliers used his knowledge of frontier living to build dwellings for the crew for wintering over. About 300 Cree Indians came up in the spring of 1669 to trade furs in exchange for European goods.

Radisson sought the support of a royal patron to secure a crown monopoly on trade within the Hudson&#x27;s Bay region. Prince Rupert of the Rhine, the king&#x27;s first cousin and a war hero on the royalist side during the English Civil War, became that patron. Prince Rupert was not considered to be a good businessman and was not one of the king&#x27;s closest friends, but he was the only member of the royal family prepared to champion the Radisson–Des Groseilliers project of fur trading at Hudson&#x27;s Bay, and critical to their getting a royal charter from Charles II. While soliciting financing from the City of London, Radisson and des Groseilliers had the advantages of being the only men who knew how to survive in the North, and who also knew the local languages and customs of the Indians, and the geography.

===Foundation of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company===

In 1670, Radisson was back in England and on 2 May received a royal charter giving him and his partners the exclusive rights to the land surrounding Hudson Bay; with this they founded the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC). During the next few years, they made a number of highly profitable trips between England and the Bay region. With the founding of the HBC, Radisson became forced to deal with a European context; there he had to struggle for survival among rival monarchs, competing courtiers, and the changing political and economic world in which they operated.

King Charles II in his charter for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company also founded a proprietary colony named Rupert&#x27;s Land, declaring that the lands adjacent to Hudson&#x27;s Bay or rivers flowing into Hudson&#x27;s Bay now belonged to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. In theory, much of modern Canada then belonged to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, as Rupert&#x27;s Land was a vast region. In practice, the company maintained a few trading forts on the sea coasts of northern Ontario and northern Québec, to which they later added forts on the sea coast of northern Manitoba. It was not until the late 18th century that the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company showed any interest in moving inland and making good its claims to control Rupert&#x27;s Land.

Both Radisson and Groseilliers operated within the HBC with the support of Prince Rupert and the company&#x27;s director Sir John Robinson. Radisson and Groseilliers were successful in having the HBC receive much capital from the City of London in order to fund its operations. In 1672, Radisson married Mary Kirke, the daughter of Sir John Kirke, one of the City investors in the HBC.

As anti-French and anti-Catholic sentiment increased in England following discontent expressed in events such as the Bawdy House Riots of 1668, both Prince Rupert and Sir John decreased their support for the men. Although Radisson&#x27;s reasons for doing so are not fully clear, he left London in 1675 with Grosseiliers to reenter the service of France, leaving his wife behind in England.

===In French service===

After leaving Britain, Radisson was unpopular in the royal court. In 1677 he decided to join the navy and to fund Marshal of France, Jean II d&#x27;Estrées&#x27;s expedition in the Franco-Dutch War to conquer the island of Tobago, winning the man&#x27;s favor. Following his involvement in the war, he borrowed 100 Louis d&#x27;or from the Marshal in a failed attempt to pay to arrange his wife&#x27;s passage from Britain. He also failed to regain a position in the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, as a further result of anti-French prejudice.

In 1681 Radisson headed out to found a fort on the Nelson River under a French flag, albeit against the wishes of the French state. He did so as a means of capturing the market, fearing the construction of a British fort on the same river and thus further dominance of the bay by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. He recruited Grosseilliers the following year to build a more permanent base.

In the winter of 1683 he and Groseilliers went to France to deal with their legal problems. (They had seized two English parties in time of peace and paid Québec tax on furs from Hudson Bay from their Nelson River fort, which may not have been part of New France.) Here they found themselves pawns in the events that led up to the Glorious Revolution. The English ambassador, Lord Preston, asked that they be punished. Compromise plans were made to send Radisson back to the Bay to pick up the remaining furs and divide the profits fairly. Lord Preston recruited Radisson back into the English service and Groseilliers returned to Québec.

===Working for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company===

In 1684 Radisson sailed for the Hayes River in the vessel &quot;Happy Return&quot;, where he found Groseilliers&#x27; son Jean-Baptiste conducting a brisk trade with the Indians. He recruited Jean-Baptiste into joining HBC service and left for England in September, leaving John Abraham in charge of the fort. (Eight days later two ships belonging to Charles Aubert de La Chesnaye arrived from Québec. Although there was conflict, no blood was shed. The French wintered near the English and returned to Québec with a moderate load of furs.) Radisson&#x27;s differences with various Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company underlings in the 1680s suggests that he was not admired by the English seamen who had to work with him, because of their rooted detestation of the French.

In 1685 Radisson was made &quot;Superintendent and Chief Director of the Trade at Port Nelson&quot;, where he seems to have accomplished little. In 1687 he made serious charges against the superintendent of York Factory. The HBC rejected the charges and Radisson was removed. Thereafter he lived in England on an HBC pension, which was irregularly paid. He died in 1710. In 1729 the company voted to pay ten pounds to his third wife, &quot;she being ill and in great want.&quot;

==Legacy and honors==
On October 3 1989, the Canadian Armed Forces named after him.

The towns of Radisson, Quebec; Radisson, Saskatchewan and Radisson, Wisconsin; a street and Metro station in Montreal; and the Radisson provincial electoral district in Manitoba, are all named after him.

The Radisson Hotels group, starting with the Radisson Hotel in Minneapolis in 1909, is also named after him.

The Canadian Coast Guard named after him.

==Representation in other media==
American writer Sinclair Lewis wrote several novels about Grand Republic, the seat of the fictitious Radisson County, Minnesota.

Sterling North dramatized Radisson&#x27;s life and adventures in his young adult novel &quot;Captured by the Mohawks&quot;.

Radisson was portrayed by Paul Muni in the 1941 film &quot;Hudson&#x27;s Bay&quot;.

The CBC Television series &quot;Radisson&quot; (1957–1958) was based on the explorer&#x27;s life. Jacques Godin played the character of Radisson.

Historian Martin Fournier has written both an academic biography of Radisson, &quot;Pierre-Esprit Radisson 1636-1710. Aventurier et commerçant&quot; (2001), and a series of historical young adult novels, &quot;The Adventures of Radisson&quot;.

<text>General Sir John Coape Sherbrooke, (29 April 1764 – 14 February 1830) was a British soldier and colonial administrator. After serving in the British army in Nova Scotia, the Netherlands, India, the Mediterranean (including Sicily), and Spain, he was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia in 1811. During the War of 1812, his policies and victory in the conquest of present-day Maine, renaming it the colony of New Ireland, led to significant prosperity in Nova Scotia.

==Early life==
John Coape Sherbrooke was born in Oxton, Nottinghamshire, on 29 April 1764, the third son of the wealthy country squire William Coape and his wife Sarah Sherbrooke. The comes from Shirebrook, Derbyshire. Upon his marriage Sherbrooke&#x27;s father had taken his wife&#x27;s surname as his own.

==Army career==

===Early career===
Sherbrooke joined the British Army as an ensign in the 4th Regiment of Foot on 7 December 1780. He was promoted to lieutenant on 22 December 1781 and then transferred to the 85th Regiment of Foot when he became a captain on 6 March 1783. The end of the American Revolutionary War brought a number of reductions to the army and this included the disbanding of the 85th, and so on 23 June 1785 Sherbrooke transferred to the 33rd Regiment of Foot which was at the time serving in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He returned to England in 1786. When the French Revolutionary War began in 1793 Sherbrooke was still a captain but was quickly promoted twice so that by the end of May 1794 he was a lieutenant colonel in the 33rd and second in command to Colonel Arthur Wellesley. Under Wellesley he fought in the Flanders Campaign between March 1793 and April 1795, as a part of which he fought at the Battle of Boxtel on 13 September 1794 before participating in the retreat towards north-west Germany at the end of the year.

After an attempt to join the West Indies Campaign in October 1795 was aborted due to large storms in the English Channel Sherbrooke and the 33rd were instead sent to serve in India, arriving at Calcutta in February 1797. Sherbrooke was promoted to colonel on 1 January 1798 and as such fought in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, participating in the final defeat of Tipu Sultan at the Siege of Seringapatam on 4 May 1799. His service in India was cut short when he fell ill with malaria which forced him to return to England, doing so in 1800. Sherbrooke&#x27;s break in service was exacerbated by the Peace of Amiens in 1802, at which point he went on half pay.

The Peace ended in May 1803 with the start of the Napoleonic Wars and Sherbrooke accordingly resumed active service, being given command of the 4th Battalion of the Army of Reserve, a home defence force created to prepare for a French invasion, based at Norman Cross. He was promoted to major general on 1 January 1805 and served under Wellesley in the Hanover Expedition between 8 November and 15 February. In June he was transferred to Sicily where he served as a subordinate to Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore and commanded at Messina; most of the troops (and Moore) were withdrawn from Sicily in October 1807, leaving Sherbrooke in command of British interests on the island. In February he had also became colonel of the Royal Sicilian Regiment. While the court of King Ferdinand urged Sherbrooke to make offensive manoeuvres towards mainland Italy with his troops, he instead began to improve Sicily&#x27;s defences and prepare for a possible French invasion. He left the island in June 1808, having been superseded by Lieutenant-General Sir John Stuart.

===Peninsular War===

Sherbrooke was next given command of 4,000 men to assist Spanish patriots in Cadiz as part of the Peninsular War, in February 1809. The patriots did not want the British to interfere and so his force was redirected to Lisbon where he joined the main British army commanded by Wellesley, soon to become Lord Wellington. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 12 April and was the second-most senior general in the army behind Wellington. He fought at the Second Battle of Porto on 12 May with a formation of men that on 18 June was designated the 1st Division. The same month as the Second Battle of Porto, Sherbrooke became colonel of the 68th Regiment of Foot. With his division Sherbrooke fought at the Battle of Talavera in July where he successfully fought off the attacks of the French infantry but then lost control of three of his brigades in the subsequent charge, leaving a dangerous gap in the British line.

At Talavera, Sherbrooke&#x27;s 1st Division included four brigades: Henry Frederick Campbell&#x27;s British Guards - 2,045 men, Alan Cameron of Erracht&#x27;s British regulars - 1,364, Ernst Langwerth&#x27;s King&#x27;s German Legion (KGL) - 1,388, and Sigismund von Löw&#x27;s KGL - 1,167. Early on 28 July 1809, the numerically superior French artillery took the British positions under fire. While in one sector, British units were withdrawn out of sight from the French guns, Sherbrooke&#x27;s division occupied an exposed position and suffered casualties before gunsmoke hid its position. The main French attack occurred at 3:00 pm when the French divisions of Pierre Belon Lapisse and Horace Sebastiani advanced against the 1st Division. Sherbrooke ordered his infantry not to fire until the French came within and then to charge. These orders were carried out to the letter, causing tremendous casualties and compelling the French to hastily retreat. Apparently, Sherbrooke forgot to warn his officers not to advance too far and all the brigades except Cameron&#x27;s recklessly rushed after their fleeing enemies. When the disordered Guards and the KGL came up against the intact French second line, it was their turn to take to their heels as the fresh French foot soldiers counterattacked. The day was saved by the appearance of John Randoll Mackenzie&#x27;s reserve brigade and the 1st Battalion of the 48th Foot. Sherbrooke&#x27;s routed troops quickly rallied behind the reinforcements and, after an extended exchange of musketry, the French counterattack was defeated. Losses were ghastly on both sides. Sebastiani&#x27;s division suffered 2,100 casualties out of 8,000 while Lapisse&#x27;s division lost 1,700 men out of 6,800, including Lapisse killed. In Sherbrooke&#x27;s division, Langwerth was killed and his brigade reduced to 650 men, Löw&#x27;s brigade lost 350 men, Cameron&#x27;s brigade lost 500 men, and the Guards sustained 611 casualties. Mackenzie was killed and his brigade lost 632 men.

Sherbrooke commanded the 1st Division through the retreat to Portugal, where he threatened to hang his commissary officer if he did not provide the required food for his division, and for his service at Porto and Talavera was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in September. A recurrence of Sherbrooke&#x27;s malaria forced him to resign his command on 26 April 1810 and he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia on 19 August 1811.

===War of 1812===
Sherbrooke arrived at Halifax on 16 October 1811, as military commander of &quot;the Provinces of Nova-Scotia, New-Brunswick, and their Dependencies, including the Islands of Newfoundland, Cape Breton, Prince Edward and Bermuda&quot;. The area of command was referred to as the Halifax Command or Nova Scotia Command.

When the War of 1812 began Sherbrooke initially fought a phoney war, allowing trade to continue with Maine to the benefit of British merchants. Having complained at the lack of defences available to protect the colony and that the extant fortifications were dilapidated, he mounted guns at harbour entrances across the colony and placed the militias in a state of readiness to repel attacks. Sherbrooke&#x27;s tactic of informally continuing trade with the neighbouring American states while still making sure that his own territory was amply protected provided an opportunity for the Atlantic-facing provinces of Canada to enhance their place in international trade; they were able to flourish at a time when other areas were stifled by war.

When the Napoleonic Wars ended in April 1814 more troops were made available for North America; Sherbrooke used this opportunity to attack the disputed area of Maine between Passamaquoddy Bay and the Penobscot River, landing an expeditionary force of 2,000 men at Castine that August and proceeding to subdue the area between the Penobscot and St Croix rivers. He renamed the region the royal colony of New Ireland. Sherbrooke was able to collect customs dues while he occupied Castine, and these funds were in later years used to finance the Cambridge Military Library in Halifax and to create Dalhousie College. New Ireland remained under the control of Britain until April 1815, although Sherbrooke himself only stayed there for four weeks, when the Treaty of Ghent restored it to the United States. For his service during the war he was elevated to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.

While the majority of Sherbrooke&#x27;s tenure as Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia was spent concentrating on the war, he also made a significant effort to increase support for the Church of England, as most of the population were dissenters. While largescale changes were voted down by the Nova Scotia House of Assembly, he provided small sums of money for the Church via taxation and allotted undeveloped land to it for the construction of religious buildings. At the same time Sherbrooke was aware that his support of the Church was not popular and so he held a careful balance between the two religious factions, ensuring for example that religious appointments were taken up by moderates and not zealots.

===British North America===
His active defence of the colony during the War of 1812 combined with his proven ability to work competently with the civilian population led to his appointment as Governor General of British North America (fully &quot;Captain General and Governor in Chief in and over the Provinces of Lower-Canada, Upper-Canada, Nova Scotia, New-Brunswick, and their several dependencies, Vice-Admiral of the same, Lieutenant-General and Commander of all His Majesty’s Forces in the said Provinces of Lower-Canada &amp; Upper-Canada, Nova-Scotia and New-Brunswick, and their several dependencies, and in the Islands of Newfoundland, Prince Edward, Cape Breton, and Bermuda, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c&quot;) in 1816. His talent as a mediator helped settle disputes between the Francophone and English political factions; he formed a good relationship with the leader of the Francophone faction, Bishop Joseph-Octave Plessis, but at the same time cemented the position of the Chief Justice of Lower Canada Jonathan Sewell although Plessis&#x27; faction had impeached him. Similarly, he won the confidence of Louis-Joseph Papineau by providing him with a permanent salary but made sure to not show favour by doing the same for Sewell.

==Retirement and death==
Sherbrooke continued to work actively into 1817, concentrating on reforming the colony&#x27;s public finances, but once again was set back by his failing health. He found that the cold Canadian winters helped bring on recurrences of his malaria, and also suffered a paralytic stroke on 6 February 1818. He handed over his duties to Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond on 30 July and sailed for home. He reached England in September and spent much time recuperating at the spas of Bath and Cheltenham while living at Calverton in Nottinghamshire. He was promoted to general on 27 May 1825 and died at Calverton on 14 February 1830.

==Family==
Sherbrooke married Katherina (died 15 May 1856), the daughter of Reginald Pyndar, rector of Madresfield, on 24 August 1811 at Areley Kings. They had no children of their own, but had adopted a boy in 1813.

==Personality and legacy==
Sherbrooke was well-known for his short temper and abrasive language, with Wellington noting that he was the most passionate man he had ever met. Henry Edward Bunbury said of him that:

While he resided in Nova Scotia, his home was at Birch Cove on Bedford Basin, near Halifax. Named Sherwood, it eventually lent its name to the neighbourhoods of Sherwood Park and Sherwood Heights. The community of Sherbrooke, Nova Scotia also bears his name. Other honorific eponyms are listed below:

<text>In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, the (binary) cycle space of an undirected graph is the set of its even-degree subgraphs.

This set of subgraphs can be described algebraically as a vector space over the two-element finite field. The dimension of this space is the circuit rank of the graph. The same space can also be described in terms from algebraic topology as the first homology group of the graph. Using homology theory, the binary cycle space may be generalized to cycle spaces over arbitrary rings.

==Definitions==
The cycle space of a graph can be described with increasing levels of mathematical sophistication as a set of subgraphs, as a binary vector space, or as a homology group.

===Graph theory===
A spanning subgraph of a given graph &quot;G&quot; may be defined from any subset &quot;S&quot; of the edges of &quot;G&quot;. The subgraph has the same set of vertices as &quot;G&quot; itself (this is the meaning of the word &quot;spanning&quot;) but has the elements of &quot;S&quot; as its edges. Thus, a graph &quot;G&quot; with &quot;m&quot; edges has 2&quot;m&quot; spanning subgraphs, including &quot;G&quot; itself as well as the empty graph on the same set of vertices as &quot;G&quot;. The collection of all spanning subgraphs of a graph &quot;G&quot; forms the edge space of &quot;G&quot;.

A graph &quot;G&quot;, or one of its subgraphs, is said to be Eulerian if each of its vertices has an even number of incident edges (this number is called the degree of the vertex). This property is named after Leonhard Euler who proved in 1736, in his work on the Seven Bridges of Königsberg, that a connected graph has a tour that visits each edge exactly once if and only if it is Eulerian. However, for the purposes of defining cycle spaces, an Eulerian subgraph does not need to be connected; for instance, the empty graph, in which all vertices are disconnected from each other, is Eulerian in this sense. The cycle space of a graph is the collection of its Eulerian spanning subgraphs.

===Algebra===
If one applies any set operation such as union or intersection of sets to two spanning subgraphs of a given graph, the result will again be a subgraph. In this way, the edge space of an arbitrary graph can be interpreted as a Boolean algebra.
The cycle space, also, has an algebraic structure, but a more restrictive one. The union or intersection of two Eulerian subgraphs may fail to be Eulerian. However, the symmetric difference of two Eulerian subgraphs
(the graph consisting of the edges that belong to exactly one of the two given graphs) is again Eulerian. This follows from the fact that the symmetric difference of two sets with an even number of elements is also even. Applying this fact separately to the neighbourhoods of each vertex shows that the symmetric difference operator preserves the property of being Eulerian.

A family of sets closed under the symmetric difference operation can be described algebraically as a vector space over the two-element finite field formula_1. This field has two elements, 0 and 1, and its addition and multiplication operations can be described as the familiar addition and multiplication of integers, taken modulo 2. A vector space consists of a set of elements together with an addition and scalar multiplication operation satisfying certain properties generalizing the properties of the familiar real vector spaces. For the cycle space, the elements of the vector space are the Eulerian subgraphs, the addition operation is symmetric differencing, multiplication by the scalar 1 is the identity operation, and multiplication by the scalar 0 takes every element to the empty graph, which forms the additive identity element for the cycle space.

The edge space is also a vector space over formula_1 with the symmetric difference as addition. As vector spaces, the cycle space and the cut space of the graph (the family of edge sets that span the cuts of the graph) are the orthogonal complements of each other within the edge space. This means that a set formula_3 of edges in a graph forms a cut if and only if every Eulerian subgraph has an even number of edges in common with formula_3, and formula_3 forms an Eulerian subgraph if and only if every cut has an even number of edges in common with formula_3. Although these two spaces are orthogonal complements, some graphs have nonempty subgraphs that belong to both of them. Such a subgraph (an Eulerian cut) exists as part of a graph formula_7 if and only if formula_7 has an even number of spanning forests.

===Topology===
An undirected graph may be viewed as a simplicial complex with its vertices as zero-dimensional simplices and the edges as one-dimensional simplices. The chain complex of this topological space consists of its edge space and vertex space (the Boolean algebra of sets of vertices), connected by a boundary operator that maps any spanning subgraph (an element of the edge space) to its set of odd-degree vertices (an element of the vertex space). The homology group
:formula_9
consists of the elements of the edge space that map to the zero element of the vertex space; these are exactly the Eulerian subgraphs. Its group operation is the symmetric difference operation on Eulerian subgraphs.

Replacing formula_1 in this construction by an arbitrary ring allows the definition of cycle spaces to be extended to cycle spaces with coefficients in the given ring, that form modules over the ring.
In particular, the integral cycle space is the space
:formula_11
It can be defined in graph-theoretic terms by choosing an arbitrary orientation of the graph, and defining an integral cycle of a graph formula_7 to be an assignment of integers to the edges of formula_7 (an element of the free abelian group over the edges) with the property that, at each vertex, the sum of the numbers assigned to incoming edges equals the sum of the numbers assigned to outgoing edges.

A member of formula_14 or of formula_15 (the cycle space modulo formula_16) with the additional property that all of the numbers assigned to the edges are nonzero is called a nowhere-zero flow or a nowhere-zero formula_16-flow respectively.

==Circuit rank==

As a vector space, the dimension of the cycle space of a graph with formula_18 vertices, formula_19 edges, and formula_20 connected components is formula_21. This number can be interpreted topologically as the first Betti number of the graph. In graph theory, it is known as the circuit rank, cyclomatic number, or nullity of the graph.

Combining this formula for the rank with the fact that the cycle space is a vector space over the two-element field shows that the total number of elements in the cycle space is exactly formula_22.

==Cycle bases==

A basis of a vector space is a minimal subset of the elements with the property that all other elements can be written as a linear combination of basis elements. Every basis of a finite-dimensional space has the same number of elements, which equals the dimension of the space. In the case of the cycle space, a basis is a family of exactly formula_21 Eulerian subgraphs, with the property that every Eulerian subgraph can be written as the symmetric difference of a family of basis elements.

===Existence===
By Veblen&#x27;s theorem, every Eulerian subgraph of a given graph can be decomposed into simple cycles, subgraphs in which all vertices have degree zero or two and in which the degree-two vertices form a connected set. Therefore, it is always possible to find a basis in which the basis elements are themselves all simple cycles. Such a basis is called a cycle basis of the given graph. More strongly, it is always possible to find a basis in which the basis elements are induced cycles or even (in a 3-vertex-connected graph) non-separating induced cycles.

===Fundamental and weakly fundamental bases===
One way of constructing a cycle basis is to form a maximal forest of the graph, and then for each edge formula_24 that does not belong to the forest, form a cycle formula_25 consisting of formula_24 together with the path in the forest connecting the endpoints of formula_24. The cycles formula_25 formed in this way are linearly independent (each one contains an edge formula_24 that does not belong to any of the other cycles) and has the correct size formula_21 to be a basis, so it necessarily is a basis. A basis formed in this way is called a fundamental cycle basis (with respect to the chosen forest). 

If there exists a linear ordering of the cycles in a cycle basis such that each cycle includes at least one edge that is not part of any previous cycle, then the cycle basis is called weakly fundamental. Every fundamental cycle basis is weakly fundamental (for all linear orderings) but not necessarily vice versa. There exist graphs, and cycle bases for those graphs, that are not weakly fundamental.

===Minimum weight bases===
If the edges of a graph are given real number weights, the weight of a subgraph may be computed as the sum of the weights of its edges. The minimum weight basis of the cycle space is necessarily a cycle basis, and can be constructed in polynomial time. The minimum weight basis is not always weakly fundamental, and when it is not it is NP-hard to find the weakly fundamental basis with the minimum possible weight.

==Planar graphs==
===Homology===
If a planar graph is embedded into the plane, its chain complex of edges and vertices may be embedded into a higher dimensional chain complex that also includes the sets of faces of the graph. The boundary map of this chain complex takes any 2-chain (a set of faces) to the set of edges that belong to an odd number of faces in the 2-chain.
The boundary of a 2-chain is necessarily an Eulerian subgraph, and every Eulerian subgraph can be generated in this way from exactly two different 2-chains (each of which is the complement of the other). It follows from this that the set of bounded faces of the embedding forms a cycle basis for the planar graph: removing the unbounded face from this set of cycles reduces the number of ways each Eulerian subgraph can be generated from two to exactly one.

===Mac Lane&#x27;s planarity criterion===

Mac Lane&#x27;s planarity criterion, named after Saunders Mac Lane, characterizes planar graphs in terms of their cycle spaces and cycle bases. It states that a finite undirected graph is planar if and only if the graph has a cycle basis in which each edge of the graph participates in at most two basis cycles. In a planar graph, a cycle basis formed by the set of bounded faces of an embedding necessarily has this property: each edge participates only in the basis cycles for the two faces it separates. Conversely, if a cycle basis has at most two cycles per edge, then its cycles can be used as the set of bounded faces of a planar embedding of its graph.

===Duality===
The cycle space of a planar graph is the cut space of its dual graph, and vice versa.
The minimum weight cycle basis for a planar graph is not necessarily the same as the basis formed by its bounded faces: it can include cycles that are not faces, and some faces may not be included as cycles in the minimum weight cycle basis. There exists a minimum weight cycle basis in which no two cycles cross each other: for every two cycles in the basis, either the cycles enclose disjoint subsets of the bounded faces, or one of the two cycles encloses the other one. Following the duality between cycle spaces and cut spaces, this basis for a planar graph corresponds to a Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph, a minimum weight basis for its cut space.

=== Nowhere-zero flows ===
In planar graphs, colorings with formula_16 distinct colors are dual to nowhere-zero flows over the ring formula_32 of integers modulo formula_16. In this duality, the difference between the colors of two adjacent regions is represented by a flow value across the edge separating the regions. In particular, the existence of nowhere-zero 4-flows is equivalent to the four color theorem. The snark theorem generalizes this result to nonplanar graphs.

<text>Georges-Philias Vanier (23 April 1888 – 5 March 1967) was a Canadian military officer, diplomat, and statesman who served as the 19th governor general of Canada from 1959 to 1967, the first Quebecer and second Canadian-born person to hold the position.

Vanier was born and educated in Quebec. In 1906, he was valedictorian when he graduated with a BA from Loyola College. After earning a university degree in law, he served in the Canadian army during the First World War; on the European battlefields, he lost a leg and was commended for his actions with a number of decorations from King George V.

Subsequently, Vanier returned to Canada and remained in the military until the early 1930s, when he was posted to diplomatic missions in Europe. With the outbreak of the Second World War, Vanier once again became active in the military, commanding troops on the home front until the cessation of hostilities in 1945, whereupon he returned to diplomatic circles.

Vanier was appointed to replace Vincent Massey as governor general in 1959 by Queen Elizabeth II, on the recommendation of Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, and he occupied the post until his death in 1967. Vanier proved to be a popular governor general, with his war record earning respect from the majority of Canadians; however, as a Quebecer, he was met with hostility by Quebec separatists.

==Early life==

Vanier was born in the Little Burgundy neighbourhood of Montreal to an Irish mother, Margaret (Maloney), and a French-Norman father, Philias Vanier, who raised Vanier to be bilingual. Vanier was descended from Guillaume Vanier of Honfleur who moved to Quebec City around 1670 and in 1672 married Magdeleine Bailly, a &quot;fille du roi&quot; from Paris. The Vanier family resided in Quebec City at first and in the 18th century moved up the St. Lawrence river to Montreal, the biggest and wealthiest city in New France. Vanier&#x27;s maternal grandparents were John Maloney and his wife Elizabeth (née Fitzgibbons), Irish immigrants who arrived in Montreal in search of a better life. Vanier&#x27;s father was a successful businessman and was one of the first people in Montreal to own an automobile, which he never learned how to drive, instead hiring a chauffeur. Vanier&#x27;s father was wealthy enough to own two cottages, one on Lake Memphremagog and another on the St. Lawrence.

He attended the Jesuit-run Loyola College (a &quot;collège classique&quot;), receiving in 1906 a Bachelor of Arts degree in church devotional fellowship. At Loyola, Vanier received the typical &quot;collège classique&quot; education with a strong emphasis on Catholic theology, Latin, Greek, philosophy, the classics, literature and math with the only difference being that his education was in English instead of French, as was usually the case with the &quot;collège classiques&quot;. Vanier was considered to be a very good student who excelled both academically and at sports such as boxing and especially hockey.

At Loyola, inspired by his literacy heroes, John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley, he entertained the ambition of being a poet. Under the pseudonym Georges Raymound, Vanier had several of his flowery English language poems published in &quot;The Siemens Magazine&quot; of Toronto. Through Vanier later admitted that his efforts at poetry were somewhat embarrassing, his favorite English poets remained Keats and Shelly for the duration of his life. As a student, he was quiet and reserved with his passions reserved for hockey as he later recalled that his happiest moment at Loyola was scoring the winning goal for his school&#x27;s hockey team with just a minute left in the game. The most important intellectual influence on Vanier at Loyola was a French Jesuit, Father Pierre Gaume, who taught French at the school. Inspired by Father Gaume, Vanier hired a tutor, a Frenchman living in Montreal, Camille Martin, who introduced him to French literature and culture in general. Martin was a mysterious character who had left France for unknown reasons and ran his tutoring services for the French-Canadian &quot;haut bourgeois&quot; out of his house on Mackay street, known locally as &quot;The Hermitage&quot;. Martin was an inspiring teacher and his influence on the teenage Vanier was described as &quot;enormous&quot;. In 1906, Vanier was the class valedictorian when he graduated from Loyola.

In 1908, Father Gaume, who continued to correspond with Vanier, criticized him for his reserve, leading Vanier to reply: &quot;Intimate feelings of joy, sadness, desires, aren&#x27;t something to write about. They can be spoken about, and in fact are more often understood, with gestures, looks and tones of voice&quot;. In another letter, Father Gaume criticized Vanier for his fondness for Molière, warning him that Molière had written &quot;abominable things&quot; about the Catholic Church, and should only be read in censored versions of his works. Through several of Vanier&#x27;s Jesuit teachers had suggested that he pursue a career as a priest, the rigid worldview of his teachers such as Father Gaume who tried to steer him away from writers such as Molière seems to have persuaded him against a career as a priest. In May 1908, Vanier wrote to Father Gaume to say that after much thought, he had decided that he lacked the calling to be a priest.

Vanier then went on to earn his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1911 from the Montreal campus of the Université Laval. Vanier was called to the Quebec bar that year and, though he took up the practice of law, he considered entering the Catholic priesthood. Through educated in English at Loyola College, Vanier had an intense love of French literature and poetry that was to last for the rest of his life. Like many other middle-class French-Canadians of his generation, France was his ideal, and his favorite city was Paris. Vanier considered Montreal to be a somewhat provincial city that lacked the glamour of Paris, and as a young man, he was a member of a group of intellectuals called &quot;École littéraire de Montreal&quot; that were sought to bring French-Canadian literature up as they saw it the standards of French literature. In January 1912, Vanier first visited Paris, where he attended a number of literacy salons to hear the readings of the latest in French poetry.

==Soldier==
With the outbreak of the First World War, he decided that offering his service to his country should take priority and thereafter enlisted in the Canadian Army. In response to the German invasion of Belgium, Britain as one of the co-guarantors of Belgian neutrality issued an ultimatum demanding that German forces leave Belgium at once; upon its rejection, Britain declared war on the &quot;Reich&quot; shortly before midnight on 4 August 1914. As a member of the British empire, Canada was automatically at war as well. Vanier took on a prominent role in recruiting others, eventually helping to organise in 1915 the French Canadian 22nd Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, of which he was commissioned as an officer, and which later, in 1920, became the Royal 22e Régiment.

Through many French-Canadians were opposed to or at least lukewarm in their support of the war, for Vanier, France was the center of western civilization, and he felt compelled to volunteer to assist France with repelling the German invasion. In addition, Vanier was greatly offended by the German invasion of neutral Belgium, all the more so because Germany was one of the co-guarantors of Belgian neutrality, which led him to see the invasion of Belgium together with the atrocities against Belgian civilians as especially brutal acts. In a letter to his sister Frances, Vanier wrote: &quot;I could not read the harrowing account if Belgian sufferings without feeling a deep compassion and an active desire to right, as so far as it is within my power, the heinous wrong done [to Belgium]&quot;. On 14 October 1914, Vanier attended the rally in Montreal&#x27;s Parc Sohmer organized by a Canadian militia doctor, Arthur Mignault, where the lead speaker was the former prime minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, that led to the formation of the 22nd Battalion.

On 15 February 1915, Vanier passed the officers&#x27; exam and was commissioned as a lieutenant. On 20 May 1915, Vanier boarded in Halifax the ship HMT &quot;Saxonia&quot; that took him and the rest of the battalion across the Atlantic to Plymouth. In Britain, the battalion went to the East Sandling Camp in Kent for more training together with visits by King George V, the prime minister Sir Robert Borden, and the minister of national defense, Sam Hughes. On 13 September 1915, the battalion arrived in Le Havre and then boarded a train that took them to the front. On 2 January 1916, Vanier led a trench raid at night that took out a heavily fortified German machine-gun post as Vanier led his men across no-man&#x27;s land, captured the post, blew it up, and then led his men back to the Canadian trenches. The success of the raid was widely reported in Montreal and even in the neutral United States where the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; covered the raid with the headline &quot;Canadian Exploits in Flanders Region&quot;. During a visit to Paris in January 1916, Vanier noted in a letter to his family the most disturbing aspect of Paris in wartime was the disproportionate number of women wearing black in morning for their husbands, boyfriends and sons who had been killed in the war. In the same letter, he expressed his love of France as he wrote: &quot;Ah, the sheer joy of it-to visit Paris on leave from the trenches where we are all trying to do our bit for the triumph of civilization&quot;. Vanier sent his family a postcard where he wrote: &quot;Affectionate greetings from Paris, the center of civilization&quot;. On 12 April 1916, Vanier made a will that began with: &quot;I believe in God and the Holy Catholic Church. I believe in eternal rest and divine mercy. I confide my soul without fear to our Lord Jesus Christ. I renew all promises made at my baptism and confirmation. I believe in the sanctity of our cause and the triumph of justice. I believe in the future of French-Canada&quot;.

Vanier for his efforts, received the Military Cross (MC) on 3 June 1916, he continued fighting in the trenches. On 10 June 1916, Vanier was wounded by the explosion of a German shell, which led him to being assigned to a Trappist monastery that had converted into a hospital to recover. In his letters to his family, he spoke of his sense of peace as he heard the Trappist monks chant while he rested in the monastery&#x27;s garden; in his diary, he wrote about feeling depressed at the sight of so much death and suffering that it made difficult for him to sleep at night. While on a visit to London later in June 1916, Vanier again collapsed from shell-shock and was sent to the Perkins Bull Hospital for Convalescent Canadian Officers in Putney Heath. Despite the efforts of his parents who had wanted to declare him medically unfit to continue fighting, Vanier chose to return to the front in July 1916, telling his parents: &quot;I can&#x27;t go back to Canada now with the boys fighting in France&quot;. In a letter to his brother Anthony, Vanier sent a post-card showing the execution of Edith Cavell in October 1915 that featured a cruel-looking German officer shooting the noble-looking Cavell with the comment &quot;To Dear Antony, this is the sort of thing that makes one glad that he enlisted&quot;. Vanier saw the war as a &quot;holy war&quot; and a &quot;sacred war&quot; to defend freedom from tyranny with himself and the other Canadian soldiers as &quot;knights&quot; who had to perform the hard and gruesome, but very necessary task of winning the war. Vanier sent his brother an article from &quot;The Spectator&quot; claiming there was a straight line of continuity from the mythical heroes of the Trojan war such as Achilles and Odysseus to the medieval knights to the Allied soldiers currently fighting in the war. Vanier endorsed the claims made in the article, telling his brother that the article perfectly explained why he had chosen to fight in the war. For Vanier, the knightly ideal of a man who has to be courageous and honorable in upholding what is right and just in the world no matter what the cost was to be his lifelong ideal, and was to greatly influence his actions throughout his life. In September 1916, Vanier visited Windsor Castle where the king personally awarded him the Military Cross.

Vanier took part in the action that saw the Canadian Corps take Vimy Ridge on 9 April 1917. The ridge, which towered above the Douai Plain, allowed any force that occupied it to dominate the plain and had been held by the Germans since October 1914. Vimy Ridge had become one of the most heavily fortified places on the Western Front, and French attempts to capture Vimy ridge in 1915 together with British attempts in 1916 had been repulsed with heavy losses, turning Vimy Ridge into a symbol of German power. Vanier was elated by the fall of Vimy and in a letter to his mother wrote: &quot;You know of course that things are going with a tremendous swing, and that we are pursuing the Boche. The morale of our troops is magnificent. We cannot lose-what is more we are winning quickly and the war will be over in six months&quot;.

In July 1917, he was appointed a knight (&quot;chevalier&quot;) of the French Legion of Honour. In late 1918, he led an attack at Chérisy and was shot in the chest and both legs, resulting in the loss of his right leg due to a shell blast. His recovery was lengthy, though he spent it in France, refusing to be evacuated while his fellow soldiers remained fighting. With the cessations of hostilities, Vanier was mentioned in despatches and was awarded a Bar to his Military Cross for his bravery during this action:

He was further appointed to the Distinguished Service Order (DSO):

Thereafter, Vanier returned to Montreal and once more found employment practicing law. On 1 April 1920, he received a regular commission as a major in the Canadian Militia. On 29 September 1921, he married Pauline Archer and the couple had five children, including Thérèse Vanier and Jean Vanier.

For four years beginning in 1921, Vanier acted as aide-de-camp to Governor General the Viscount Byng of Vimy, leaving this post when he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and took command of the Royal 22e Régiment at La Citadelle. Vanier occupied that position for only one year before again becoming aide-de-camp for Byng&#x27;s viceregal successor, the Marquess of Willingdon. Vanier was very close to Lord Byng, who had commanded the Canadian Corps in 1916–1917. During the King-Byng affair of 1926, Vanier felt that the charges of William Lyon Mackenzie King that Byng had acted illegally in not dissolving the House of Commons for a new election as Mackenzie King had asked to do were absurd. He then went to England where he attended the Staff College, Camberley from 1923 to 1924, where Harry Crerar, later Chief of the General Staff and commander of the First Canadian Army during World War II, was a fellow student and J. F. C. Fuller was an instructor.

==Diplomatic career==
In 1928, Vanier was appointed to Canada&#x27;s military delegation for disarmament to the League of Nations and in 1930, he was named secretary to the High Commission of Canada in London, remaining at that post for nearly a decade, approximately half of which he spent serving the man who would eventually immediately precede him as governor general of Canada, Vincent Massey. Vanier&#x27;s relations with Massey were described as &quot;cordial&quot;, through never close as Vanier found Massey to be a snob who was inordinately proud of the fact he was a scion of the famous Massey family and that he attended Balliol College at Oxford. In 1935, when Byng died, Vanier wrote a tribute for him that appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; of London that praised him as the victor of Vimy and as the governor-general of Canada.

In the tumultuous year of 1936, King George V died; and his son, Prince Edward, Prince of Wales, acceded and then abdicated in favour of his younger brother, Prince Albert, Duke of York. On 12 May 1937, Vanier, along with his son, Jean, watched from the roof of Canada House the coronation parade of their new king, George VI. In the procession below, Vanier would have seen one of the future governors general of Canada, Harold Alexander, who was then the personal aide-de-camp to the King.

In January 1939, Vanier was elevated to the position of the King&#x27;s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to France. In April 1939, he wrote to Mackenzie King: &quot;if the British guarantee to Poland puts an end to German expansion through the threat of force, it also puts an end to the policy of non-inference and carries with it the definite risk of precipitating war&quot;. As the Danzig crisis gathered steam during the summer of 1939, Vanier sent his wife Pauline and their children to take their summer vacation in Varengeville in Normandy, saying it was far too dangerous to take a vacation in Paris, which might be bombed should the crisis turn to war. On 26 August 1939, Vanier sent a dispatch to Ottawa simply saying &quot;it looks like war&quot; was inevitable.

With the outbreak of Second World War, Vanier was surprised by the Phoney War. On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded France, but Vanier expected the offensive to be halted. On 16 May 1940, Vanier was informed by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs that he should burn all of the secret documents at the Canadian Legation as there was a real possibility that the Wehrmacht might take Paris at any moment, leading Vanier to toss all of the secret papers into the basement furnace of the legation later that day. When he walked over the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, he was astonished by the sight of the huge bonfire in the Foreign Ministry&#x27;s courtyard. Vanier had the staff of the legation prepared to leave Paris at any moment. At the same time, he found the legation surrounded by thousands of refugees asking for papers to depart for Canada. Many of the people waiting outside of the legation were Jewish refugees from Germany who had settled in France and on 24 May 1940, Vanier wrote to Mackenzie King that &quot;there is a wonderful opportunity for Canada&quot; to take action by providing financial assistance and asylum for the refugees. In a cabinet discussion of Vanier&#x27;s appeal, Mackenzie King dismissed it under the grounds that Vanier&#x27;s dispatch was &quot;very muddled in thought and expression...far too wide and undertook far too in the way of government obligation&quot;. On the next day, 25 May 1940, Mackenzie King agreed to accept 10, 000 refugee children provided they were British, French, Belgian or Dutch. Vanier was informed by Mackenzie King that &quot;it would possible to take in a certain number of children of French descent&quot; became &quot;some thousands&quot; of French children could be settled in Quebec without causing any controversy in &quot;la belle province&quot;.

On 9 June 1940, Vanier met with General Maxime Weygand who told him that Paris would probably fall within the next week. On 10 June 1940, it was announced that the French government was relocating to Tours, and as such Vanier ordered the legation staff to leave Paris. Vanier&#x27;s last act in Paris was to see the American ambassador to France, William Christian Bullitt Jr., to hand over the papers giving him the legal power to represent Canada in occupied France. Vanier attached a poster to the front door of the legation saying &quot;All Canadian government services have been evacuated from Paris&quot;, and then boarded the automobile that was to take him to Pernay, where he decided the legation would be relocated.

The drive from Paris to Pernay, which normally took 3 hours, instead took 17 hours as the roads were overwhelmed with refugees. On 14 June 1940, Vanier learned that the Wehrmacht had taken Paris and had almost reached Tours, leading him to tell his wife Pauline to take herself and their children to Bordeaux. On 15 June, Vanier went to the village of Margaux outside of Bordeaux, where he was reunited with his family. The Vaniers stayed in the village of Cantenac, where the family was forced to sleep on the floor of the &quot;maire&quot; for the next two nights owing to a lack of housing. On 17 June, Paul Reynaud resigned as premier and was replaced by Marshal Philippe Pétain, whose first act was to announce that his government would seek an armistice with Germany. The Vanier family boarded a boat at Le Verdon-sur-Mer that took them to Britain.

With the Nazi occupation of France in 1940, Vanier and his wife fled to the United Kingdom and then back to Canada in 1941, where he was commissioned as commander of the military district of Quebec and began an early policy of bilingualism in the army. The next year Vanier was promoted to the rank of major general and then made the Canadian Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the governments of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Yugoslavia, as well as the representative of the Canadian government to the Free French and later the &quot;Conseil National de la Résistance&quot;, all of which were governments in exile. Both Georges and Pauline Vanier pressed for Canada to accept refugees during the war. To the frustration of the Vaniers, these efforts were met predominantly with indifference and even anger, and Vanier&#x27;s letters to Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, failed to induce a change in Canada&#x27;s immigration policies.
A major issue in Franco-Canadian relations were that the Canada continued to recognize the Vichy government as the legitimate government of France and only broke diplomatic relations with Vichy on 9 November 1942. Vanier was in disagreement with Mackenzie King&#x27;s policy of recognizing Vichy and several times suggested that Canada should recognize the Free French movement led by Charles de Gaulle. In the summer of 1940, Vanier became friendly with the Free French general Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, who told him that de Gaulle was planning to conquer the French colony of Cameroon held by a governor loyal to the Vichy regime in order to booster his claim to be the legitimate French leader and in the process acquire a source of manpower to continue the war. The Vanier family was so close to Leclerc that the Vanier children took to calling him &quot;Uncle Philippe&quot;.

Vanier commented that President Edvard Beneš of Czechoslovakia &quot;had the genius for being everywhere&quot; as Beneš was very active in various committees for planning a post-war Europe. Vanier found that Beneš was a deeply embittered and angry man obsessed with the &quot;betrayal&quot; of the Munich Agreement. Through Beneš expressed much hatred of Neville Chamberlain, whom he blamed the most for the Munich Agreement, he also spoke about the &quot;collective guilt&quot; of the Sudeten Germans whose loyalty to Czechoslovakia had proved to be wanting in 1938. Beneš spoke frankly to Vanier about his desire to expel all of the Sudeten Germans after the war, saying that it was possible for Canada to be shared by different peoples, but not in Czechoslovakia. In common with many other diplomats whom found Beneš somewhat stiff and stubborn, Vanier preferred the company of the Czechoslovak foreign minister Jan Masaryk who was friendly and outgoing, through he sometimes found Masaryk&#x27;s sense of humor too vulgar for his tastes. Vanier had a strong liking for the romantic young King Petar II of Yugoslavia, whose restoration he supported, through he also felt the Yugoslav prime minister, Božidar Purić, was not a leader. Vanier saw parallels between Yugoslavia and its various peoples with Canada, and thought the King Petar could serve as a rallying figure to hold his nation together. Vanier tended to sympathize with the Polish prime minister, General Władysław Sikorski against what he called the &quot;red hand of Stalin&quot;. Vanier found the Greek cabinet, which was torn by endless in-fighting between Royalists and Venezilists, to be tiresome and troubling.

Vanier was a friend and admirer of Charles de Gaulle, whose cause he championed over the opposition of Mackenzie King, who made little effort to hide his dislike and distrust of de Gaulle. Mackenzie King had a deep love of the United States and especially admired President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose lead he tended to follow. Roosevelt had a strong aversion to de Gaulle and throughout the Second World War, American officials had an &quot;anybody but de Gaulle&quot; attitude towards the question of future leaders of France. In May 1943, the United States was conspicuously absent among the Allies in refusing to recognize de Gaulle&#x27;s government-in-exile based in Algiers as the legitimate government of France. Vanier often pressed Mackenzie King to support the Free French and not to worry so much about American objections. After René Massigli, the French foreign minister, told him that not to recognize de Gaulle&#x27;s government-in-exile was tantamount to handing France over to the Communists after the war, Vanier pressed Mackenzie King very strongly for Canadian recognition of the &quot;Conseil National de la Résistance&quot;. Mackenzie King told Vanier that he would only recognize de Gaulle&#x27;s government if the United States did so first, much to Vanier&#x27;s vexation who warned that de Gaulle was a proud man who would not forgive such a slight.

In a dispatch to Ottawa, Vanier wrote: &quot;Ever since I came to Algiers I have been endeavoring to prove to the department that the only reasonable course for us to follow was to acknowledge the Committee as the future and later &quot;de facto&quot; administrator of France after the Liberation&quot;. Together with Alfred Duff Cooper, the British ambassador in Algiers, Vanier pressed very strongly for a greater French role in Operation Overlord, wanting a French division under the command of Leclerc to take part. Vanier wrote: &quot;The absence of an important body of French troops in the northern area will be to the French people a crowning humiliation that will be neither understood nor forgotten irrespective of all reasons or excuses which may be put forward. I submit that the Canadian government would render a great service to France by making every effort to obtain the inclusion of at least one French division in the north&quot;. Despite the best efforts of Duff Cooper and Vanier, it was decided that it would be impossible to have a French division land in Normandy as part of the first wave of Allied troops, but that the 1er Bataillon de Fusiliers Marins Commandos would take part in the first wave and that an armored division under Leclerc would join the Normandy campaign at a later day after the first landings. Vanier was in Algiers when he heard the news that Operation Overlord had begun on 6 June 1944 with the Allies successfully landing in Normandy. Vanier reported a mixture of feelings at the news with relief that the liberation of France had finally begun together with a feeling of sadness as the old soldier Vanier knew the Normandy campaign would bring death and suffering to both soldiers and civilians as indeed it did.

In the summer of 1944, Vanier made two trips to Italy, both to see his old regiment, the Royal 22nd, which had fighting in Italy as part of the 1st Canadian Division. During his second visit, Vanier had an audience with Pope Pius XII in Rome. On 24 August 1944, Leclerc&#x27;s division entered Paris to accept the surrender of the German commander, General Dietrich von Choltiz. The swastika flag that had flying over the Eiffel Tower since 1940 had been taken down, to be replaced with the &quot;Tricolour&quot;. Pauline Vanier in a letter to her children that both she and their father &quot;had behaved like lunatics&quot; at the news. Pauline Vanier ended her letter: &quot;This morning we hear that Leclerc&#x27;s division has entered Paris, that Romania has capitulated, that Marseille has been liberated, that Grenoble has been taken, that we are marching on Lyon, that Lisieux is taken, that we are nearing Le Havre, that another column is going up towards Lille. Oh me! It is nearly too much emotion at once!&quot;. On 2 September 1944, Vanier left Algiers for a brief visit to London and then returned to Paris, a city that he had not seen since 1940. Both the Vaniers were shocked to see how famished the ordinary people of France were as under the occupation it was official policy to ensure that people in Germany were amply supplied with French food with the French being told to live on whatever was left, though Vanier noted with disgust that the French upper classes had been able to stay well fed via the black market. One of Vanier&#x27;s first acts upon arriving in France was to go to Dieppe to pay his respects to the Canadian soldiers buried there, having been killed in a disastrous raid on Dieppe that took place on 19 August 1942. Both the Vaniers broke down in tears when &quot;The Last Post&quot; was played while laying flowers upon the graves of the fallen soldiers. Likewise, the Vaniers were moved to tears when they visited the ruins of Caen, which had almost completely destroyed during the Battle of Caen, but where the ordinary people greeted them with cries of &quot;Vive le Canada!&quot; (&quot;Long Live Canada!&quot;). Vanier&#x27;s attempts to contact the man who worked as his chauffeur during his first time in Paris in 1939-1940 were unsuccessful as his chauffeur was Jewish and Vanier learned that he and his family had been deported for &quot;resettlement in the East&quot;, which was the last that anybody had heard of them.

Following the fall of Vichy France in 1944 to the Allied forces, Vanier was posted as Canada&#x27;s first ambassador to France. While serving in that role, as well as acting as Canada&#x27;s representative to the United Nations, he toured in April 1945 the recently liberated Buchenwald concentration camp. Vanier had been sent to Buchenwald to investigate reports that three Canadians serving with the Special Operations Executive (SOE) had been executed there, but reported to Ottawa that he saw &quot;naked bodies piled like so much cord wood and on which lime was thrown&quot;. Vanier reported that the survivors were emaciated &quot;walking skeletons&quot; whose bones that protruded through their skin made it impossible for them to stay in one position for very long and that he could see &quot;how their knee and ankle joints held together&quot;. Vanier talked to a number Polish Jewish child survivors and in his report stated: &quot;Some had been in the prison camp for years. Those of ten and over worked as slave laborers on munitions. Not one as far I know, had any idea of where his parents were; in view of the barbarous treatment inflicted on the Poles and Jews by the Germans, it is quite possible that they have all been done to death&quot;. As for the three missing SOE agents, Vanier discovered that Frank Pickersgill of Winnipeg, John Macalister of Guelph and Guy Sabourin of Montreal had all been tortured and executed at Buchenwald in September 1944.

On a return trip to Canada, he delivered via the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation a speech expressing his shame over Canada&#x27;s inaction, saying: &quot;How deaf we were then, to cruelty and the cries of pain which came to our ears, grim forerunners of the mass torture and murders which were to follow.&quot; Back in Paris, he and his wife continued to help the refugees who arrived at the embassy, arranging for them food and temporary shelter. The couple, with the assistance of numerous others, eventually pushed the government of Canada to revise the regulations of immigration and more than 186,000 European refugees settled in Canada between 1947 and 1953. In the aftermath of the occupation, many people in France were on the brink of starvation and the Vaniers were very active in ensuring that food was sent from Canada to France to prevent a famine.

As ambassador to France, Vanier supported the French policy in Vietnam, through in common with other Canadian diplomats he felt it better that the French provide independence to Vietnam instead of trying to force Vietnam to accept being a French colony. Like other Canadian diplomats, Vanier saw the Commonwealth as the model solution, believing in the same way the Dominions were independent, but united by having the British monarch as their head of state that a similar system was needed for the French empire. As there were no Canadian diplomats stationed in Indochina, most of what the Canadian government knew what was happening in Vietnam came from Vanier&#x27;s reports in Paris. In January 1949, Vanier reported it was impossible for the French to negotiate with Ho Chi Minh and the Emperor Bảo Đại was &quot;the only political figure whom the French could negotiate with&quot;. In 1949, an agreement was struck under which the United States would pay most of the costs associated with the war in Indochina in exchange for the French granting a nominal independence to Vietnam under the Emperor Bao Dao. In November 1949, Vanier reported to Canadian External Affairs minister Lester B. Pearson: &quot;Although the Bao Dao experiment has not obtained much success thus far, I am inclined to endorse the efforts of the French government to establish some prestige for the Bao Dao government. The French assertion that there is no suitable alternative policy at the present seems to be true&quot;. Vanier strongly supported Canadian recognition of the State of Vietnam, arguing that recognizing Bao&#x27;s government would assist the French with obtaining funds from &quot;a U.S. military aid bill&quot; that was being debated in Congress.

It was in 1953 that Vanier retired from diplomatic service and returned to Montreal, though he and his wife continued social work there. Vanier sat as a director of the Bank of Montreal, the Credit Foncier Franco-Canadien, and the Standard Life Assurance Company, and served on the Canada Council for the Arts.

==Governor General of Canada==
Vanier was the first Quebec-born governor general of Canada, his bilingualism proving to be an asset to his mandate of fostering Canadian unity. Following on that of Vincent Massey, an anglophone, the appointment of Vanier established the tradition of alternating between French and English speaking persons. Although Vanier&#x27;s bilingual upbringing made him as much of an anglophone as he was a francophone, his appointment was considered francophone representation. Vanier&#x27;s tenure was marked by economic problems plaguing the country and a succession of minority governments, but the greatest threats to Confederation came from the rise of the Quiet Revolution, Quebec nationalism, and the Quebec sovereignty movement, including the terrorist actions of the Front de libération du Québec; indeed, as a Québécois representing the Canadian monarch and someone who promoted federalism, he was perceived by many Quebec separatists to be a traitor to his people. Amongst most other circles in the country, however, he was lauded as a distinguished viceroy.

===As governor general-designate===
The appointment of Vanier as governor general was announced on 1 August 1959, at Halifax, Nova Scotia, during a meeting of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada at which Queen Elizabeth II was present and, by commission under the royal sign-manual and Great Seal of Canada, approved of Vanier as her representative. In spite of the challenges of poor health and political unrest in Canada, the Major-General said of his commission to represent the Queen: &quot;If God wants me to do this job, He will give me the strength to do it.&quot;

Though Vanier&#x27;s name had been raised as a candidate for the viceregal role as early as William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s time as prime minister and it was suspected King&#x27;s successor, Lester Pearson, was considering Vanier to replace Massey, the Liberal Party lost the 1957 and 1958 elections, leading to the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, John Diefenbaker, to be appointed and then remain premier; it was then thought unlikely that Vanier would be made governor general, especially as he was a staunch Liberal Party supporter. The announcement of the Major-General&#x27;s appointment thus surprised Ottawa insiders and the media. Diefenbaker, however, felt that more Francophone representation was needed in Canada&#x27;s government; in his memoirs, he wrote he had considered a non-English-Canadian for the post and attributed his decision to put forward Vanier for appointment to a chance meeting with the Major-General. There was some objection to the appointment of a devout Roman Catholic. The Queen&#x27;s private secretary at the time, Alan Lascelles, predicted Vanier would be &quot;the best governor general in Canadian history.&quot;

===In office===
He was sworn in the Senate Chamber on 15 September 1959 in the presence of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. He had presided over a farewell dinner for his predecessor the previous evening. During the ceremony, the commission by the Queen that was signed during her royal visit the prior month for Vanier&#x27;s appointment was read aloud in the chamber. He was given a royal salute following the proceedings, provided by the 1st Battalion, Canadian Guards and the Band of the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps. Vanier had a fiercely protective attitude towards Queen Elizabeth II, whom he called &quot;our little queen&quot;, seeing it as his duty to serve and look after. Vanier&#x27;s attitude was in large part based on the fact that Elizabeth was the third generation of the House of Windsor that he had served, as he previously served George VI (the queen&#x27;s father) and George V (the queen&#x27;s grandfather), leading to see himself as an elderly &quot;knight&quot; whose duty was to offer the monarch all of the expertise he had acquired during his life. Vanier used as his guide the 1867 book &quot;The English Constitution&quot; by Walter Bagehot as to what were the powers of the governor-general as the representative of the monarch in Canada.

Upon taking up residence at Rideau Hall, Vanier asked that a bilingual sign be placed at the main gates to the royal and viceroyal residence and that a chapel for offering Mass be constructed somewhere on the property, two requests that reflected two dominant forces in Vanier&#x27;s life: religion and Canadian unity. When he was in residence, Vanier would pray twice daily in the chapel that was eventually fit into the palace&#x27;s second floor and, at a time when the Canadian federation was under threat from separatists factions in Quebec, Vanier delivered numerous speeches, in both French and English, and infused with words praising the co-habitation of Anglophone and Francophone Canadians; in one of the last orations he gave, he said: &quot;The road of unity is the road of love: love of one&#x27;s country and faith in its future will give new direction and purpose to our lives, lift us above our domestic quarrels, and unite us in dedication to the common good... I pray God that we may all go forward hand in hand. We can&#x27;t run the risk of this great country falling into pieces.&quot; Words like these, though, earned Vanier the ire of Quebec nationalists, as demonstrated when, on Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day in 1964, he found himself the target of such people in Montreal, who held placards reading &quot;Vanier vendu&quot; (&quot;Vanier traitor&quot; or 
&quot;Vanier sellout&quot;) and &quot;Vanier fou de la Reine&quot; (&quot;Vanier Queen&#x27;s jester&quot;).

Despite his poor health (Vanier had a heart condition), and his doctor&#x27;s warnings about strain, Vanier travelled across Canada, gaining the affection of Canadians. As part of his official duties, Vanier, along with the Queen, attended the inauguration of the Saint Lawrence Seaway on 26 June 1959 and, in June 1965, the same year he inaugurated the new national flag, was made Chief Big Eagle of the Blackfoot tribe in Calgary. He was also active in encouraging children to achieve, using his role as The Boy Scouts Association Canadian branch&#x27;s Chief Scout of Canada to this end. His and his wife&#x27;s concern for family life drew them to founding in 1964 the Canadian Conference of the Family, which eventually became the Vanier Institute of the Family. As the representative of the head of state, Vanier hosted a list of official guests, including United States president John Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy; the Emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie; David Ben-Gurion, Prime Minister of Israel; the Shah of Iran; and General Charles de Gaulle, President of France. His assistant private secretary from 1960 to 1962 was Lord Hylton.

===Death===
By 1966, though his itinerary remained unreduced, Vanier&#x27;s strength was failing. On 4 March 1967, before watching a Montreal Canadiens game on television at Rideau Hall, Vanier had conversed with his prime minister at the time, Lester B. Pearson, and had expressed to him that he was willing to continue on as governor general until the end of the centennial year. Given Vanier&#x27;s physical state, Pearson was hesitant to advise the Queen to act along those lines, but his worry was short lived, as the following day, after hearing the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and receiving Holy Communion in the chapel, the Governor General died. With Robert Taschereau, Chief Justice of Canada, acting as Administrator of the Government, more than 15,000 messages of sympathy were received at Rideau Hall.

Following a state funeral at the Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica on 8 March 1967, the Major-General was buried at La Citadelle&#x27;s commemorative chapel on 5 May of the same year. Though Vanier had earlier hosted the French president at Government House, neither de Gaulle nor any representative was sent to attend the funeral, which was read by Canadian diplomatic officials as a hint that there had been a change in Canada–France relations and instigated the chain of events that would culminate in de Gaulle&#x27;s &quot;Vive le Québec libre&quot; speech in Montreal later that year.

==Legacy==
When, in 1999, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; compiled a list of the 100 most influential Canadians of all time, Vanier was placed by the editors at position number one. His time in the Office of the Governor General saw the creation of a number of awards that reflected the Major-General&#x27;s interests. He was an avid fan of sport and, though his favourite was hockey and specifically the Montreal Canadiens, Vanier instigated in 1965 the Governor General&#x27;s Fencing Award and the Vanier Cup for the university football championship in the Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union. To recognise excellence in more bureaucratic endeavours, Vanier initiated in 1962 the Vanier Medal of the Institute of Public Administration of Canada and, in 1967, the Vanier Awards for Outstanding Young Canadians, awarded to deserving individuals in the Canadian Junior Chamber of Commerce.

Vanier and his wife, Pauline are seen by many Canadian Catholics as potential candidates for sainthood in the Catholic Church because of their piety and love for humanity, and the Newman Center at the University of Toronto has stained glass windows depicting the Vanier couple.

Jon Kay noted that &quot; Jeremy Kinsman argues that it was the francophone Georges Vanier—not his well-heeled anglophone nemesis, Vincent Massey—who fought for the Canadian admission of Jewish refugees in the aftermath of World War II, and who forged in the crucible of wartime suffering a humanist creed that foreshadowed modern Canadian multiculturalism.&quot;

<doc id="262245" wikidata="Q952474" url="?curid=262245" title="Lunar meteorite">
<text>A lunar meteorite is a meteorite that is known to have originated on the Moon. A meteorite hitting the Moon is normally classified as a transient lunar phenomenon.

==Discovery==
In January 1982, John Schutt, leading an expedition in Antarctica for the ANSMET program, found a meteorite that he recognized to be unusual. Shortly thereafter, the meteorite now called Allan Hills 81005 was sent to Washington, DC, where Smithsonian Institution geochemist Brian Mason recognized that the sample was unlike any other known meteorite and resembled some rocks brought back from the Moon by the Apollo program. Several years later, Japanese scientists recognized that they had also collected a lunar meteorite, Yamato 791197, during the 1979 field season in Antarctica. , 371 lunar meteorites have been discovered, perhaps representing more than 30 separate meteorite falls (i.e., many of the stones are &quot;paired&quot; fragments of the same meteoroid). The total mass is more than . All lunar meteorites have been found in deserts; most have been found in Antarctica, northern Africa, and the Sultanate of Oman. None have yet been found in North America, South America, or Europe.

Lunar origin is established by comparing the mineralogy, the chemical composition, and the isotopic composition between meteorites and samples from the Moon collected by Apollo missions.

==Transfer to Earth==
Most lunar meteorites are launched from the Moon by impacts making lunar craters of a few kilometers in diameter or less. No source crater of lunar meteorites has been positively identified, although there is speculation that the highly anomalous lunar meteorite Sayh al Uhaymir 169 derives from the Lalande impact crater on the lunar nearside.

Cosmic-ray exposure history established with noble-gas measurements have shown that all lunar meteorites were ejected from the Moon in the past 20 million years. Most left the Moon in the past 100,000 years. After leaving the Moon, most lunar meteoroids go into orbit around Earth and eventually succumb to Earth&#x27;s gravity. Some meteoroids ejected from the Moon get launched into orbits around the Sun. These meteoroids remain in space longer, but eventually intersect the Earth&#x27;s orbit and land.

==Scientific relevance==
All six of the Apollo missions on which samples were collected landed in the central nearside of the Moon, an area that has subsequently been shown to be geochemically anomalous by the Lunar Prospector mission. In contrast, the numerous lunar meteorites are random samples of the Moon and consequently provide a more representative sampling of the lunar surface than the Apollo samples. Half the lunar meteorites, for example, likely sample material from the farside of the Moon.

At the time the first meteorite from the Moon was discovered in 1982, there was speculation that some other unusual meteorites that had been found originated from Mars. The positive identification of lunar meteorites on Earth supported the hypothesis that meteoroid impacts on Mars could eject rocks from that planet. There are also speculations about the possibility of finding &quot;Earth meteorites&quot; on the surface of the Moon. This would be very interesting because in this case stones from Earth older than 3.9 billion years, which are destroyed on Earth by various geological processes, may have survived on the Moon. Thus some scientists propose new missions to the Moon to search for ancient rocks from Earth.

==Observation history==
About one in every thousand newly discovered meteorites is a lunar meteorite, whereas the vast majority of meteorites are from the asteroid belt. In the early 19th century most scientists believed that all meteorites falling towards the Earth were from the Moon. Although today supported only by a minority of researchers, there are also theories that tektites are from the Moon and should therefore also be regarded as lunar meteorites. However, most scientists regard such theories as outdated. 

==Private ownership==

Lunar meteorites collected in Africa and Oman are, for all practical purposes, the only source of Moon rocks available for private ownership. This is because all rocks collected during the Apollo Moon-landing program are property of the United States government or of other nations to which the U.S. conveyed them as gifts. Similarly, all lunar meteorites collected by the U.S. and Japanese Antarctic programs are, by treaty, held by those governments for research and education purposes only. Although there is no U.S. law specifically against the ownership of Apollo Moon rocks, none has ever been (or is likely to ever be) given or sold by the U.S. government to private citizens. Even in the cases of plaques containing genuine Apollo Moon rocks given in 2004 to astronauts and Walter Cronkite, NASA retained ownership of the rocks themselves. Most of the moonrocks collected by the Luna 16 probe are also unavailable for private ownership, although three tiny samples were sold at auction for $442,500 in 1993.

<doc id="262246" wikidata="Q677316" url="?curid=262246" title="Social War (91–87 BC)">
<text>The Social War (from Latin , &quot;war of the allies&quot;), also called the Italian War or the Marsic War, was fought largely from 91 to 88 BC between the Roman Republic and several of its autonomous allies () in Italy. Some of the allies held out until 87 BC.

The war started in late 91 BC, with the rebellion of Asculum. Other Italian towns quickly declared for the rebels and the Roman response was initially confused. By the new year, the Romans had levied huge armies to crush the rebels but found initial headway difficult; by the end of the year, however, they were able to cut the Italian rebels into two, isolating them into northern and southern sectors. The Italian rebels attempted to invade Etruria and Umbria at the start of 89 BC but were defeated. In the south, they were defeated by Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who for his victories would win a consulship the next year. The Romans retained the initiative and by 88 BC, the conflict was largely over and Roman attention had been captured by the ongoing First Mithridatic War. The few Italian rebels on the field by 87 BC eventually reached a negotiated settlement during a short civil war that year. At various stages of the war, Romans brought legislation allowing Italian towns to elect Roman citizenship if they had not revolted or would otherwise put down arms, draining support from the rebels. 

Views differ as to the causes of the war, primarily on whether Roman citizenship was already a coveted status whose extension was the goal of the Social War or not. The main ancient source for the period is the relatively late Appian, who wrote in the imperial period during the 2nd century AD, and whose narrative is largely one based on demands of the allies for Roman citizenship. Other historians, most especially Henrik Mouritsen, have focused instead on a perceived alternative tradition which has the Italian allies rebelling against Roman hegemony and encroachment on allied lands.

The massive expansion of the citizenship that followed the Social War remained a politically-charged topic, especially in terms of how they would be allocated into voting blocks. Disputes over enfranchisement played a role in Sulla&#x27;s march on Rome in 88 BC to depose plebeian tribune Publius Sulpicius Rufus. Fears of Sulla rolling back hard-won Italian rights contributed to resistance during Sulla&#x27;s civil war. The conflict also blurred the distinction between Romans and their enemies; the presence of large armies in Italy during the war also provided opportunities for generals to seize power extralegally. For these reasons and others, some historians believe the conflict played an important role in setting up the collapse of the republic.

== Name ==

The name Social war is an improper English translation of &quot;bellum sociale&quot;, which means &quot;war of the allies&quot; (from Latin , meaning &quot;ally&quot;). Today, the name is used more generally in classics scholarship to refer to any war between allies. The name &quot;bellum sociale&quot; was first used in the second century AD by the historian Florus, and only became common during the imperial period. The Romans of the time called it the Marsic war named for the Marsi, an Italian tribe located east of Rome who during the war killed two Roman consuls, or otherwise called it the Italian war. The focus on the Marsi may also have to do with Quintus Poppaedius Silo, who was one of the Italian leaders. 

Usage in the late republican and early imperial period treated the names Marsic and Italian war as largely interchangeable. Cicero&#x27;s works refer to it as or (though he also uses ); Sallust, according to Aulus Gellius, calls it the Marsic war; Velleius Paterculus, Asconius Pedianus, and Julius Obsequens call it the . An official senatus consultum dated to 22 May 78 BC calls it and the Augustan-era &quot;fasti consulares&quot; call it .

== Background ==

=== Italy in the second century BC ===

The Italian peninsula during the second century BC was dominated by the Roman Republic, which was allied in a collection of bilateral treaties with the many city-states on the peninsula. In general, those cities received guarantees of territorial integrity and internal self-government in exchange for supporting Rome with men during its many wars. Allied contingents made up an increasing portion of Roman manpower: by 295 BC, the allied contingents of Roman-led armies as a whole outnumbered the Romans on the field and, by 218 BC, there were three allies on the field for every two Romans. This made allied manpower indispensable for Roman military superiority. 

Cities cooperated with Rome for various reasons. They received shares of the war spoils and land assignments. Rome also supported allied elites against popular revolts (eg at Arretium, Lucania, and Volsinii in 302, 296, and 264 BC, respectively). While some of the cities defected during the Second Punic war after the Battle of Cannae in 216 BC, the defectors were defeated and harsh terms applied. Over time, the Romans started to interfere in the internal affairs of their allies, though historians differ as to its extent. For example, when the senate acted to suppress the Bacchanalia in 186 BC, historians differ as to whether this applied only to Roman land or was extended extraterritorially to the allies.

By the time of the Social War, the allies were mainly located in the following regions: two northern ones (Etruria and Umbria) and more further south (Lucania, Apulia, and Magna Graecia). As far back as the fifth century, the Oscan and Umbrian-speaking communities in southern Italy had formed a flexible confederal league; the most powerful of these were the Samnites and Lucanians. The Romans had fought with the Samnites a number of wars during the conquest of Italy; even afterwards, these allies retained their cohesiveness, having defected from Rome as a single bloc during the Second Punic war. Romanisation through to the second century proceeded with considerable heterogeneity: in Apulia and Samnium, Latin influence was largely absent in both the archaeological and literary sources, while in Marsic lands inscriptions indicate adoption of the Latin alphabet. On the whole, Italian tribes and peoples on the eve of the Social war still held themselves distinct from Rome, just as they had in previous centuries.

Also importantly, before the 1st century AD, it was not possible for a person to hold more than one citizenship. Nor, before the empire, were allied soldiers granted Roman citizenship at the close of their service. For example, Cicero deliberately contrasts Italic single citizenship against Greek multiple citizenship in his speech for Lucius Cornelius Balbus, a provincial who had been granted citizenship by Pompey. Citizenship was linked to territories: a person who received Roman citizenship gave up their local citizenship; losing local citizenship and living outside of Roman territory meant a local reduction in socio-economic status.

=== Italian demands ===

The &quot;Italian question&quot; refers to the relationship between Rome and her Italian allies. It is still not entirely clear what the Italian allies were fighting for. There are two threads in the ancient accounts: one depicting the struggle as one for Roman citizenship and another as one against Roman domination. 

Edward Bispham, writing in the 2016 &quot;Companion to Roman Italy&quot;, concludes that &quot;it seems certain that the Social War is best understood as a revolt from Rome&quot; but synthesises the approaches in that the desires for citizenship and independence are themselves expressions of an underlying desire for equality and freedom, inside or outside the Roman political system.

==== Desire for citizenship ====

Appian&#x27;s &quot;Civil Wars&quot; is the main source for much of this period. It provides three themes for the Italians: support for agrarian reform, votes for land, and demands for political equality. According to Appian, the agrarian reforms of Tiberius Gracchus were meant to support the Italians. However, there is no good evidence to verify this claim and most historians reject it as a political tactic either to distinguish between free and slave or as an anachronism interjected by his brother Gaius to legitimate Gaius&#x27; reform agenda some ten years later. Attempts to actually grant citizenship started in 125 BC with a proposal by Marcus Fulvius Flaccus. Gaius Gracchus is said to have brought similar proposals. These attempts were largely brought because Roman tribunes and magistrates believed that granting citizenship could be traded for Italian elites acquiescing over occupied public lands. 

Appian similarly frames the war as a reaction to the failed reform proposals of the plebeian tribune of 91 BC, Marcus Livius Drusus. As part of a complex scheme to change criminal court jury composition, Drusus allegedly would have to seduce the people with free land, which required public lands, which required pushing Italians off that land, which required a sweetener of citizenship to quell objections. When the proposals failed, the Italians went to war to secure the citizenship and legal equality denied to them in peace.

The most convincing theme which Appian presents, however, is an Italian desire for political equality: he says the Italians aspired to be &quot;partners in rule rather than subjects&quot;. However, it is likely that poor and rich Italians sought different goals: poorer Italians were likely seeking freedom from unfair treatment by Roman magistrates; it would have been their richer compatriots that would benefit from direct access to Roman politics.

More modern versions of the citizenship thesis have been advanced by Emilio Gabba, arguing that Italian commercial classes (the &quot;publicani&quot;) drove romanisation in an attempt to share in the rewards of empire. The exalted position of Italian businessmen in the provinces may have absolved their status inferiority at home; combined with a desire to influence Roman provincial policy, they may have sought to secure their business rights by becoming Roman citizens. This thesis, however, is not widely accepted since the Italians who were most exposed to the Greek East were not those who led the revolt and had to be coerced into joining it. Similarly, A N Sherwin-White believed that the Italians wanted Roman citizenship to secure legal equality. Less convincingly, D B Nagle argued that economic factors could explain the start of the war.

==== Rebellion ====

Henrik Mouritsen, in the influential 1998 book &quot;Italian Unification &quot;, argues that Appian&#x27;s citizenship narrative is highly anachronistic. For writers in the imperial period, Roman citizenship was highly desirable. Those writers then retrojected that desirability onto the Italians who lived centuries before their time. His analysis of the evidence also concludes that before the Social War, there was little agitation for citizenship, multiple citizenships still being invalid, which would have been incompatible with local autonomy. As to the possibility of votes for land, he writes &quot;Flaccus&#x27; citizenship bill [and bills similar to it] would have been infinitely more far-reaching in its implications than the reform promoted... it would lead to a total upheaval of the traditional alliance system on which Roman domination in Italy had been based for centuries... as an attempt to restart the land distribution process the bill would probably have been of scant value&quot;. The extent of the upheaval of the alliance system similarly leads Mouritsen to reject granting citizenship as part of Drusus&#x27; attempt to change jury composition as means far in excess of the ends sought.

Instead, Mouritsen focuses on Italian discontent with Roman public land reform. Rome&#x27;s public lands had been won centuries prior to the 90s BC when the nascent republic had subjugated the Italian peninsula. Newer lands had also been forcibly taken from southern Italian cities that had sided with Hannibal during the Second Punic War. With each victory, the Romans demanded and received from the Italians a latent title to lands the Italians still occupied. For centuries, Roman claims on those lands were unenforced. After the start of the land reform process in 133 BC with Tiberius Gracchus&#x27;s &quot;lex Sempronia&quot;, Italians started to complain about Roman magistrates illegally encroaching on their land holdings; in 129 BC, the senate acted and deprived the land redistribution commission of its survey jurisdiction, putting a pause on land distributions. The commission, before the pause in 129 BC, likely quickly surveyed and parceled out the unoccupied and recently surveyed Hannibalic war-era lands. The older holdings elsewhere, however, were impossible to disentangle from private lands. Never surveyed and with unclear borders, Italians objected to the land commission&#x27;s infringements on their property, which was guaranteed by treaty. The objections brought the redistributive process quickly to a halt.

Mouritsen proposed instead the following reconstruction for the start of the war in the late 90s BC. Drusus, seeking to placate the plebs in exchange for a change in the jury courts, proposed a law to do more widespread land distributions against the allies&#x27; protests. Their anger increased when the law passed over their objections and Rome started seizing allied lands; the allies therefore started preparations for an insurrection by late summer 91 BC. Amid this distrust, Drusus was blamed for breaking down relations with the allies, which led to a confrontation between Drusus and the consul, Lucius Marcius Philippus, in the senate some time in September. Rome responded to these rumours of Italian unrest by sending garrison forces into Italy, which explains their capture at the start of the war. Drusus may have then attempted to rescue his standing and placate the allies by trying to pass a law to give the allies citizenship. After this attempt failed amid Drusus&#x27; declining popularity, the attempts of the Latins – who actually were agitating for citizenship – to assassinate the consuls, who opposed Latin citizenship, at the Latin Festival became known. With the prospect of the Latins deserting Rome, the balance of military power would shift into the Italians&#x27; favour. After secret negotiations, the Italians then launched their bid to throw off Roman hegemony.

== Outbreak ==

=== Preparations ===

As evidenced by the destruction of Fregellae after an attempted revolt in 125 BC, it was an enormous risk to rebel against Rome. The Italians, in planning their war, would have to form reliable alliances secured with hostages. Appian describes a long series of secret negotiations between the Italian states, of which Rome was ignorant.

The Romans were likely aware of some kind of unrest, even if they did not know of its scope. This is evidenced by Roman garrisons being captured at the start of the war in unfriendly cities. It is likely those garrisons had been dispatched before the start of the war to strategically important locations. Already by late 91 BC, the Romans had sent praetors with levied troops around the peninsula to investigate rumours of a plot. But by the time the investigations completed (or as a result of those investigations), the war had started. Regardless, preparations for a revolt likely were brewing &quot;before&quot; Drusus&#x27; tribunate in 91 BC.

=== Military command ===

At the outbreak of the war, the Italians levied forces and formed up armies to oppose the Romans. To have done this so quickly, agreements must have been reached on power-sharing and command before the outbreak of the war. 

According to Photius&#x27; summary of Diodorus Siculus, which is accepted by most modern scholars, the Italians established at Corfinium a new capital with a forum and five-hundred-man senate. The senate then appointed two consuls and twelve praetors, dividing them evenly between northern and southern fronts (with Italian consuls Quintus Poppaedius Silo and Gaius Papius Mutilus assigned to the north and south, respectively). Reconstructions have differed over the Italian state&#x27;s organisation. Theodor Mommsen in 1854 proposed that the Italians self-organised basically along the same lines as the Romans. Alfred von Domaszewski in 1924 suggested that Silo and Mutilus were merely leaders of two major factions in the Italian forces and that the twelve &quot;praetors&quot; reflected twelve tribal divisions arranged in a federal structure; this position was accepted in the first edition of the &quot;Cambridge Ancient History&quot; in 1932. Later reconstructions have interjected popular elements à la the Roman &quot;comitia centuriata&quot;. But others, such as Mouritsen, have taken a more critical eye at the evidence and viewed the Italian magistrates and senate as a more formally federal structure without direct popular involvement.

Mouritsen reads from Livy&#x27;s description of the Latin War (when Rome&#x27;s Latin allies rebelled ) possible hints for the lost portions of Livy&#x27;s narrative on the Social War. Because much of Livy&#x27;s work on early history has long been recognised to be anachronistic, Mouritsen believes that the narrative on the Latin War may anachronistically reflect Social War-era realities. In the Livian Latin War, the Latin allies demanded a real power-sharing arrangement where magistracies and senatorial seats were to be set aside for the Latins in proportion to military contributions. If the Italians had similar aims in 91 BC, they would have been incompatible with a centralised Roman state and the supremacy of Rome&#x27;s urban elite.

However, beyond Diodorus&#x27; summarised description of the Italian government, there few other sources which describe the Italian coalition&#x27;s internal politics or offices. Instead, they refer to various tribal and ethnic leaders without distinction of office. Florus, for example, mentions no Italian senate or magistrates, but instead says that the Italians served each under their own standards. Coinage, along with Livy, seem to refer to a number of &quot;imperatores&quot; (Oscan &quot;embratur&quot;), which may have been appointed by each ethnic group. They did not seem to have been replaced after death in battle, implying the lack of any Italian elections. Christopher Dart suggests that the Italians converted the victory title &quot;imperator&quot; into an official magisterial title, in the same way &quot;imperator&quot; later turned into the title of the Roman emperor in the Flavian era.

=== Inciting incident ===

In late 91 or early 90 BC, a rumour was heard that Asculum was exchanging hostages with another city. Such an exchange was customary in the preparations for war to prevent allied cities from defecting. A Roman praetor by the name of Quintus Servilius, possibly the quaestor of 103 BC, rushed to the city and threatened violence if Asculum did not desist. The inhabitants, however, fearful of Roman discovery, responded by killing the praetor and his legate Fonteius. They then killed all the Romans in the city and ransacked their goods. Violence having been committed against the Romans openly, the Italians revolted as one.
This sequence is at odds with Appian&#x27;s account, which paints Asculum as rioting in late 91 BC in response to Marcus Livius Drusus&#x27; assassination in Rome and Roman prosecution of Italian allies. In this narrative, Drusus, whose political star was waning since the death of his influential supporter Lucius Licinius Crassus, had his legislation invalidated by the senate. He was shortly thereafter killed by an unknown assassin. Around this time, the Italians send a delegation to Rome but the Romans refuse to negotiate. Appian asserts that after Drusus&#x27; death but before the start of the war, the &quot;equites&quot; set up the &quot;quaestio Varia&quot; (the Varian court) to prosecute those who aided the Italians in securing citizenship. After the double blow of Drusus&#x27; death and the prosecution of their allies at Rome, Appian then has the Italians form their conspiracy and revolt. However, as the Italians could not have had enough time between Drusus&#x27; death and the start of the war to organise, Appian&#x27;s timing cannot be correct.

== Course ==

While the inciting incident of the war is clear, its end is not. One could argue various dates, ranging from 89 BC, when most of the fighting was practically complete, down to November 82 BC and the Battle of the Colline Gate when an identifiably Italian group of rebels was at last defeated. This article presents events down to the nominal pacification of the Samnites and Lucanians in 87 BC.

The main sources for the course of the war are relatively confused. Appian&#x27;s account present events roughly geographically, producing a confusing non-chronological account. Livy&#x27;s summaries indicate that Livy wrote chronologically, but the details of the original Livian volumes are lost. Other sources such as Diodorus (via Photius), Florus, and Velleius Paterclus recount events non-chronologically. There were two main theatres of the war, with one in the north and one in the south. There also was an abortive attempt to incite rebellion in Etruria and Umbria, but the Romans moved quickly and brutally to suppress it. The northern theatre was centred on Asculum (in the lands of the Piceni and Marsi) with the southern theatre in Samnium, Lucania, Apulia, and Campania.

The immediate reaction in Rome to the rebellion was one of confusion. After the war&#x27;s start, Quintus Varius Hybrida, then a plebeian tribune, set up a permanent court searching around for conspirators who incited the Italians to war. Mouritsen writes of the court, &quot;such stab-in-the-back theories are plausible only when no other explanation is at hand; apparently the Romans did not see any direct connection between the franchise question and the outbreak of the war&quot;. It is possible that in the early winter of 90 BC there was an abortive attempt to negotiate a peace before fighting started; if it occurred, the senate refused to negotiate.

=== 90 BC ===

Appian reports that the Italians at the start of the war mobilised some 100,000 men. Rome&#x27;s Latin allies remained loyal. Rome also continued to control Capua and central Campania, which proved logistically vital. The consuls of the year, elected in a time of relative peace, were Lucius Julius Caesar and Publius Rutilius Lupus. The two men had access to experienced legates: Gaius Marius and Lucius Cornelius Sulla. 

==== Initial offensive ====
The Romans levied a massive force over the winter, allowing the consuls of 90 BC to depart for war immediately. All consuls and praetors that year were assigned to Italy; the provincial governors at the start of the war had their terms continuously prorogued. According to the summary of Livy, Livy included tables of the Latin and foreign communities that sent auxiliaries to join the Romans. Modern estimates of Roman manpower exceed 140,000, split between fourteen legions (two for each consul and one each for ten legates). Rome also conscripted ships and mercenaries from its overseas allies; two triremes, for example, were taken from Heraclea Pontica on the Black Sea and returned eleven years later. 

The initial Italian offensive struck in late 91 and early 90 BC. It was clearly planned with full knowledge of typical Roman strategy and operations. There was a policy of mercy toward pro-Roman combatants in the southern theatre commanded by Gaius Papius Mutilus; the war also assumed a &quot;distinctive character&quot; in the extent to which Roman soldiers defected to the Italians. For example, when Nola was captured, the Italians were able to induce the defection of most of the Roman soldiers (the officers refused and were starved to death).

In the initial offensive, the colony of Aesernia was put under prolonged siege: the consul Lucius Julius Caesar moved to break it but was unsuccessful; the Romans suffered further reverses, losing Venafrum, Grumentum in Lucania, and suffering defeat near Alba Fucens. The most important victories for the Italians were in Campania and Picenum. In Campania, Mutilus took Nola, Herculaneum, and Salernum, before being stopped at Acerrae from advancing on Capua. In Picenum, Gaius Vidacilius, Titus Lafrenius, and one Publius Ventidius defeated Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo and forced him into Firmum. Vidacilius took the opportunity then to advance into down the eastern Italian coast into Apulia, taking Canusium. Aesernia fell later in the year after repeated failures by Lucius Julius Caesar to relieve the town; turning south, Caesar attempted to stop Mutilius from forcing the fortress at Acerrae, but both sides found themselves in a series of indecisive engagements.

==== Roman breakout ====
While attempting to lead his men across a river in the northern theatre on 11 June, the consul Publius Rutilius Lupus fell in the Battle of the Tolenus River while fighting against the Marsi when his undertrained men were routed during the crossing. After this battle, when the huge number of bodies returned to Rome caused a panic, the senate decreed that war dead should in the future be buried on the field. In this same engagement, Gaius Marius, another of Rutilius&#x27; legates and hero of the Cimbric wars, was able to pull off a decisive victory by forcing the river when alerted to the disaster by the bodies that flowed downstream; he eventually assumed command after Rutilius&#x27; replacement was assassinated at false surrender negotiations. Marius, assisted by a flanking manoeuvre by Lucius Cornelius Sulla, then inflicted a victory over the Marsi near the Fucine lake, which split the Italians in two.

Sextus Julius Caesar, consul in 91 BC and promagistrate this year, moved to relieve Firmum some time in October. Between Sextus&#x27; army and Pompey Strabo&#x27;s forces, Labrenius&#x27; forces were routed and forced into Asculum, which was then besieged by Strabo. Sextus&#x27; forces then forced back Vidacilius into Apulia and placed it too under siege in December. The northern front of the war largely collapsed after these victories. Attempts to incite rebellion in Etruria and Umbria could have opened a third front against Rome, but were quickly suppressed; Appian notes also that the senate acceded to garrisoning Cumae with freedmen, recruited into the army for the first time.

With a collapsing northern front and the division of the Italians into two, Italian defeat became largely inevitable. The Italians attempted opening negotiations, inviting Mithridates VI Eupator of Pontus to invade, but Mithridates responded equivocally. As Rome started to gain the upper hand, the senate decreed some time around October that consul Lucius Julius Caesar should bring legislation allowing any Italian community that had not revolted or otherwise promptly laid down their arms to elect Roman citizenship. This was passed and became the &quot;lex Julia de civitate&quot;; it also removed one of the main causes of the war – be it demands for citizenship or for security of land holdings – and provided that new tribes would be created for new citizens. Between the citizenship law and the costs of the war, only the Italian hard-liners remained in the field.

=== 89 BC ===

The new consuls for 89 BC were Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo and Lucius Porcius Cato. In January, the Marsi attempted to support the rebellions in Etruria and Umbria. The two consuls moved to intercept the Marsi, who were commanded by Titus Vettius Scato. Strabo defeated the Marsi near Asculum, forcing them into retreat across the snowy mountains. Cato, taking command from Marius, defeated the Marsi near the Fucine lake, but was himself killed in battle. It is likely that Cato was killed early in the year, leaving only Strabo as consul for the remainder of 89.

The Romans continued on the offensive against the Marsi, under the command of legates Lucius Cornelius Cinna and Marcus Caecilius Cornutus, and forced the Marsi to petition for peace. These victories allowed the Romans a free hand in the siege of Asculum and freedom to attack into southern theatre from the north. Corfinium was also taken, forcing the Italians to transfer their capital to Bovianum. The Romans also subjugated the Vestini and the Marrucini. By summer, the Romans had pacified the northern theatre, except for Asculum, which was still under siege.

Rome also took the offensive in the south. Sulla, commanding an army and supported by a fleet, besieged Nola and took Pompeii, defeating an attempt to relieve the cities by Lucius Cluentius. After the capture of Pompeii, Sulla quickly took Stabiae and Herculaneum by June. Sulla then moved into Samnium, subjugating the Hirpini and giving gentle terms, before taking Bovianum by September after a bitter struggle, forcing the Italians to move their capital again to Aesernia (now under their full control). That year, Sulla stood for and won the consulship of 88 BC, with Quintus Pompeius Rufus as his colleague.

Asculum surrendered in November 89 BC after its commander, Vidacilius, committed suicide. For this victory, Pompey Strabo celebrated a triumph on 25 December over Asculum and Picenum. Strabo, however, infamously refused to give any of the plunder to the state, even though the public treasury was empty. Further legislation was enacted to extend the citizenship with the passage of the &quot;lex Plautia Papiria&quot; (though the Samnites and Lucanians, still under arms, were excepted). New legislation was also brought by Pompey Strabo to incorporate new colonies in Transpadane Gaul with Latin rights. The reorganisation of Italy also required the formation of new &quot;municipia&quot; as well as surveying of their lands and establishment of their charters. This longer process would continue until the age of Caesar.

=== 88 and 87 BC ===
By 88 BC, the war was largely over, except for some isolated holdouts. Elections for the consulship of 88 were delayed by Pompey Strabo&#x27;s late return to the city, but eventually returned Lucius Cornelius Sulla and Quintus Pompeius Rufus. The senate, troubled by news of Mithridates VI Eupator&#x27;s invasion of Asia in the east, assigned neither consul to commands against the Italians; Sulla by lot was assigned the command against Mithridates.

Early in the year, Pompey Strabo&#x27;s command in the northern theatre was prorogued and he quickly accepted the surrender of multiple Italian towns and communities, putting an effective end to the war in the north. The remaining northern insurgents fled south to Samnium and Apulia, where the Italians still controlled large tracts of territory. The Italians reorganised around Quintus Poppaedius Silo and designated him supreme commander; according to Diodorus, Silo commanded a force of some 50,000 men, which would have been wildly insufficient to defeat the Romans. Regardless, Silo was able to reverse Roman advances in Samnium and also recapture Bovianum. He then crossed the Apennines and engaged Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius in Apulia, where his forces were badly defeated and Silo was killed.

Following Silo&#x27;s death, Italian organised resistance collapsed. For Livy and Appian, his death marks the end of the Social war. However, a remnant of Samnite and Lucanian rebels fought on in Bruttium and even sent appeals to Mithridates of Pontus for an intervention in Italy. Faced with death or slavery, they refused to surrender. Late in 88 or in 87, after Sulla&#x27;s departure for the east, this rebel force unsuccessfully attacked Isiae and Rhegium near the Strait of Messina. The outbreak of a short civil war at Rome in 87 BC allowed them to nonetheless reach a negotiated settlement with the weakened Roman government; the rebels sided with the faction of Lucius Cornelius Cinna and Gaius Marius after being promised citizenship, the return of hostages and deserters, and the return of all loot taken by the Romans.

== Impact ==

Even in ancient times the conflict was perplexing and the final outcome of the war or its immediate impacts were not entirely clear. One can interpret the terms under which the various Italian communities at different times reached with the Roman state as victory for either Italians or Romans or alternatively as a negotiated stalemate.

=== Economic and legal ===
The war was a &quot;supreme effort&quot; on both sides. For example, Appian reports the need for soldiers was so great that freedmen were for the first time inducted into the army. Edward Bispham, in a &quot;Companion to Roman Italy&quot;, notes that the republic &quot;never minted more silver &quot;denarii&quot; than during the conflict&quot;, indicating the financial strain imposed on the Roman state in supplying and paying for an unprecedented number of troops. Devastation of the war in the central and southern portions of Italy was &quot;profound&quot;. Archaeological evidence points towards the Social war, along with the following Sullan civil war, devastating the central Apennines. The literary sources indicate that after these conflicts much of the Italian countryside was both lawless, as men strove to take advantage of the breakdown in order, and miserable.

The extension of citizenship to the allies also redrew the political and legal maps of Italy. In place of the former sovereign and autonomous Italian communities, there was a sea of Roman citizen . Municipal constitutions dating from time immemorial over the next decades were replaced by laws and charters passed under the auspices of the &quot;comitia&quot; in Rome. The varying magistrates of the Italian city-states were largely replaced by a relatively uniform &quot;quattorvirate&quot; of city magistrates and more rarely with a &quot;duovirate&quot;. The dating of this municipalisation process is not entirely straightforward: the formation of the quattorvirates likely dates to the &quot;Cinnanum tempus&quot;; a uniform and generalised &quot;lex municipalis&quot; came only during the time of Caesar and Augustus.

=== Enrolment of new citizens === 
One of the main issues in 88 BC (the consulship of Lucius Cornelius Sulla) was how the newly enfranchised Italian citizens would be enrolled into the Roman tribes. The thirty-five tribes made up the &quot;comitia tributa&quot;, a Roman popular legislative and electoral assembly. With each tribe getting one vote irrespective of population and with tribal status being hereditary, how the enormous multitude of Italian citizens were tribally organised would sway politics for generations.

The first proposals, emerging during the Social war itself, were merely to expand the number of tribes and to allot the Italians to those new tribes. This solution was also elegantly traditional: Rome&#x27;s tribes had in the past been adduced to represent citizens living in new territories, though the last time this had been done was in 242 BC. Plans were made to create possibly two or eight new tribes, pursuant to the &quot;lex Julia&quot;, which would deprive the overwhelming number of new citizens of much of their political influence. Appian further posits this number may have been ten. During Sulla&#x27;s consulship, one of the tribunes of the plebs, Publius Sulpicius Rufus, challenged this plan. He brought and passed legislation, possibly by force, which would have the new citizens inscribed in the existing thirty-five tribes instead; he could only bring that proposal successfully with the support of Marius, whom he won over with the promise of the Mithridatic command. But his legislation was abrogated after Sulla – at the time continuing the siege at Nola – marched on Rome in response to the Mithridatic reassignment.

After Lucius Cornelius Cinna took control of the city, espousing the cause of Italian suffrage, he settled the matter in favour of distributing the new citizens among the old tribes, which was confirmed during and after Sulla&#x27;s civil war both by the victor and the senate. This process started only in 70 BC with the election of new censors, who very likely stepped down before the census was complete. This was not helped by the irregular election of censors after the Social war: only two pairs completed their tasks (those of 86 and 70 BC). The process of registering those new citizens, however, took many years – probably delayed by Rome&#x27;s purposeful inaction – and was completed only in the Augustan era.

The new citizens that were enrolled after the Social war also were distributed across the whole of the Italian peninsula. Only a few had the means to travel to Rome and vote in person. Those nearer the city likely had little connection to Rome&#x27;s oligarchic political system. This new electorate was therefore &quot;de facto&quot; more concentrated into those who had vested personal interests in the elections. Moreover, because no censuses were held to reclassify citizens on their wealth, those grandfathered into the upper &quot;centuriae&quot; who had fallen on harder times sold their votes to the highest bidders. The distribution of the tribes across the whole of Italy also empowered magnates close to Rome, whose votes were few and the focus of much political and financial attention.

The impact of these new Italian citizens was felt, for example, in the legislation recalling Cicero from exile in 58 BC. It passed due to the support of the Italian landowners who had been enfranchised by the conflict, using Italian enfranchisement to support Italian political champions.

=== Destabilisation of the republic ===

The immediate aftermath of the war proved grounds for continued conflict. Beyond the unrest associated with Sulpicius&#x27; tribunate and Sulla&#x27;s overturning of Sulpicius&#x27; laws, the continuing dispute over enfranchisement was one of the factors which motivated men to support Lucius Cornelius Cinna, who posed as a champion for the Italians to gain their support during the &quot;bellum Octavianum&quot;. Both Cinna and Gnaeus Papirius Carbo, during preparations for civil war against Sulla, stoked fears that Sulla might – if victorious – strip some Italians of their hard-won citizenship rights by abrogating Cinna-era legislation.

Longer-term impacts also were triggered by the war&#x27;s change in political norms. In the immediate sense, of domestic politics in the period 91–88 BC, nothing at all can be said with certainty. But the war&#x27;s extensive militarisation of Italy triggered an opening for generals to grab political power:

The war also politicised the Roman army and broke down civil-military norms. Defections, lax discipline, and mutinies were tolerated as commanders could not afford to lose the support of the men. Conflict with the Italians also blurred the distinction between Romans and foreign enemies: for Andrew Lintott, &quot;Roman armies were only to be used for civil war after their scruples had been drowned in a blood-bath of fighting with their own Italian allies... it may as well be argued that civil war created the self-seeking unprincipled soldier as the converse&quot;.

Harriet Flower, in the influential 2010 book &quot;Roman republics&quot;, further speculates that the conflict may have driven a wedge between the common soldiery and the voters at Rome, reducing their loyalty to the state. Combined, these factors made the republic&#x27;s victory in the Social war &quot;a Pyrrhic one at best&quot;, creating &quot;both Sulla the consul and Sulla&#x27;s own particular kind of client army that was willing to march on Rome at his bidding, for the first time in Roman history&quot;.

== Historiography ==

Views on the Social war have changed over the years. For many years, scholars accepted the Appianic account of demands for Roman citizenship. More recently, however, a &quot;much debated&quot; re-evaluation emerged with the publication of Henrik Mouritsen&#x27;s &quot;Italian Unification&quot; in 1998, which read the war not as a struggle for citizenship and political equality, as depicted in imperial accounts, but rather as an attempt by certain Italian allies to throw off the Roman yoke. Archaeological evidence also has continued to show substantial heterogeneity prior to Roman assumption of direct rule over the peninsula. These field surveys have brought up new work in reassessing the extent of Italian regionalism in economic, military, and social terms.

=== Ancient accounts ===

Most of the ancient accounts attributed the war to allied demands for citizenship. However, these accounts were written in the aftermath of the war, which extended that citizenship, and largely fail to justify how citizenship became an Italian demand. The core surviving source is Appian; other literary accounts – such as those of Lucius Cornelius Sisenna, Lucullus, Sulla, Diodorus Siculus, and Livy (who wrote more on the Social war than the Second Punic War) – are fragmentary or lost. No Italian perspectives survive, except that which can be gleamed from the few Italian coins.

The earliest accounts of the Social war emerge before the fall of the republic. The first is an excerpt of what is believed to be Posidonius&#x27; history of Rome preserved by Diodorus Siculus via Photius. It was written some time between 70 and 65 BC and describes two Italian motives: demands for citizenship which were refused and rebellion against Roman hegemony (&quot;The Italians, who so many times before had fought with distinction on behalf of Rome&#x27;s &quot;hegemonia&quot;, were now risking life and limb to secure their own&quot;).

The sources also attribute to the allies demands for , a broad term describing legal protections against unjust punishment, the vote, the right to appeal, and the rule of law. Sources voicing demands for include &quot;Rhetorica ad Herennium&quot;, in which a speech is putatively being given before the &quot;quaestio Varia&quot; in which the Italians are painted as rebelling against Roman rule. The later poet Ovid also sings of the Paeligni, which Ovid claims had been &quot;compelled to honest arms&quot; by their &quot;love of liberty&quot; (either from Roman hegemony or the burdens of their alliances). An explicit statement to this effect comes also from Strabo, where the Italians rose up seeking liberty, citizenship, and equality with the Romans. Similarly, Eutropius attributes the insurgents as fighting for &quot;equal freedom&quot;.

=== Modern accounts ===

The first coherent study of the Social war was that of Prosper Mérimée in 1841. The first modern narrative history was that of Adolf Kiene in 1844, which established the narrative separation between northern and southern fronts and cast the consuls of 90 BC as engaging in a personalistic feud with their Italian counterparts. Kiene also was the first to recognise the impact and occurrence of delays in the registration of the new citizens.

Theodor Mommsen was the first to break from the ancient accounts, arguing that the Italian goals shifted during the war from citizenship before the war to independence during it, viewing this as a consequence of the Italian&#x27;s parallel political institutions established at Corfinium and their christening of a new state called &quot;Italia&quot;. Other historians also hold this view, including Gaetano De Sanctis (drawing parallels between the Social war-era Italians and 19th century risorgimento) and, most influentially and radically, Henrik Mouritsen.

Mouritsen&#x27;s account, in the 1998 book &quot;Italian Unification&quot;, paints the dominant Appianic narrative as being coloured by his second century AD imperialist world view and thereby creating an anachronistic and inaccurate interpretation of first century Italian war goals. He identifies two separate traditions, one for citizenship and one for independence. Mouritsen&#x27;s account has been extremely influential in recent research, both in terms of a more convincing reconstruction of the war&#x27;s start, especially in a non-teleological manner, but also in triggering scholarly re-evaluation of Romanisation in Italy and Italian war goals more generally. It has not, however, won universal acceptance. Other scholars have also connected the burdens of allied service in the Roman army with resentment against segregation and mistreatment.

<text>Arthur Adamov (23 August 1908 – 15 March 1970) was a playwright, one of the foremost exponents of the Theatre of the Absurd.

==Early life==
Adamov (originally Adamian) was born in Kislovodsk in the Terek Oblast of the Russian Empire to a wealthy Armenian family.:92 At the outbreak of the First World War, the family was at risk of being interned as &quot;enemy citizens&quot;, and only &quot;through the special intervention of the King of Wurttemberg&quot; were they able to escape to Geneva, Switzerland.:93 Adamov was educated in Switzerland and Germany,:93 with French as his primary language. In 1924, when he was sixteen years old, he moved to Paris, France.:93 There he met artists associated with the Surrealist Movement and edited the surrealist journal &quot;Discontinuité&quot;.:93

== Postwar career ==
He began to write plays at the end of World War II.:98 &quot;La Parodie&quot; (1947) was his first play, which Martin Esslin has identified as &quot;an attempt to come to terms with neurosis, to make psychological states visible in concrete terms&quot;.:98 His work influenced by August Strindberg,:98 is often dream-like and later works in particular have a political element influenced by Bertolt Brecht. The title character of one of his best known works, &quot;Le Professeur Taranne&quot; (1953), is accused of various things (public nudity, littering, plagiarism), all of which he strenuously denies, only to have his denials turned against him into more evidence of misdemeanours. This particular play was directly influenced by a dream Adamov had.

Lesser known to the public is his prose work with short stories such as &quot;Fin Août&quot; (in &quot;Je... Ils...&quot;, 1969). Their themes revolve around topics including masochism, which the author regarded as &quot;immunisation against death&quot;. Adamov translated a number of works by German authors (Rilke, Büchner) and Russian classics (Gogol, Chekhov) into French.

The Algerian war radicalised his political views and in the 1960s he became a Communist.

During his later years, he began to drink and use drugs.

Adamov&#x27;s death in 1970 was due to an overdose of barbiturates.

<doc id="262252" wikidata="Q176848" url="?curid=262252" title="Pyrolysis">
<text>Pyrolysis is the process of thermal decomposition of materials at elevated temperatures, often in an inert atmosphere without access to oxygen.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;pyrolysis&quot; is coined from the Greek-derived elements &quot;pyro-&quot; (from Ancient Greek πῦρ : pûr - &quot;fire, heat, fever&quot;) and &quot;lysis&quot; (λύσις : lúsis - &quot;separation, loosening&quot;).

==Applications==
Pyrolysis is most commonly used in the treatment of organic materials. It is one of the processes involved in the charring of wood or pyrolysis of biomass. In general, pyrolysis of organic substances produces volatile products and leaves char, a carbon-rich solid residue. Extreme pyrolysis, which leaves mostly carbon as the residue, is called carbonization. Pyrolysis is considered one of the steps in the processes of gasification or combustion. Laypeople often confuse pyrolysis gas with syngas. Pyrolysis gas has a high percentage of heavy tar fractions, which condense at relatively high temperatures, preventing its direct use in gas burners and internal combustion engines, unlike syngas. 

The process is used heavily in the chemical industry, for example, to produce ethylene, many forms of carbon, and other chemicals from petroleum, coal, and even wood, or to produce coke from coal. It is used also in the conversion of natural gas (primarily methane) into hydrogen gas and solid carbon char, recently introduced on an industrial scale. Aspirational applications of pyrolysis would convert biomass into syngas and biochar, waste plastics back into usable oil, or waste into safely disposable substances.

==Terminology==
Pyrolysis is one of the various types of chemical degradation processes that occur at higher temperatures (above the boiling point of water or other solvents). It differs from other processes like combustion and hydrolysis in that it usually does not involve the addition of other reagents such as oxygen (O2, in combustion) or water (in hydrolysis). Pyrolysis produces solids (char), condensable liquids, (light and heavy oils and tar), and non-condensable gasses.

Pyrolysis is different from gasification. In the chemical process industry, pyrolysis refers to a partial thermal degradation of carbonaceous materials that takes place in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere and produces both gases, liquids and solids. The pyrolysis can be extended to full gasification that produces mainly gaseous output, often with the addition of e.g. water steam to gasify residual carbonic solids, see Steam reforming.

===Types===
Specific types of pyrolysis include: 
* Carbonization, the complete pyrolysis of organic matter, which usually leaves a solid residue that consists mostly of elemental carbon.
* Methane pyrolysis, the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen fuel and separable solid carbon, sometimes using molten metal catalysts.
* Hydrous pyrolysis, in the presence of superheated water or steam, producing hydrogen and substantial atmospheric carbon dioxide.
* Dry distillation, as in the original production of sulfuric acid from sulfates.
* Destructive distillation, as in the manufacture of charcoal, coke and activated carbon.
** Charcoal burning, the production of charcoal.
** Tar production by destructive distillation of wood in tar kilns.
* Caramelization of sugars.
* High-temperature cooking processes such as roasting, frying, toasting, and grilling.
* Cracking of heavier hydrocarbons into lighter ones, as in oil refining.
* Thermal depolymerization, which breaks down plastics and other polymers into monomers and oligomers.
* Ceramization involving the formation of polymer derived ceramics from preceramic polymers under an inert atmosphere.
* Catagenesis, the natural conversion of buried organic matter to fossil fuels.
* Flash vacuum pyrolysis, used in organic synthesis.
Other pyrolysis types come from a different classification that focuses on the pyrolysis operating conditions and heating system used, which have an impact on the yield of the pyrolysis products. 
== History ==

Pyrolysis has been used for turning wood into charcoal since ancient times. The ancient Egyptians used the liquid fraction obtained from the pyrolysis of cedar wood, in their embalming process.

The dry distillation of wood remained the major source of methanol into the early 20th century.
Pyrolysis was instrumental in the discovery of many chemical substances, such as phosphorus from ammonium sodium hydrogen phosphate in concentrated urine, oxygen from mercuric oxide, and various nitrates.

== General processes and mechanisms ==
Pyrolysis generally consists in heating the material above its decomposition temperature, breaking chemical bonds in its molecules. The fragments usually become smaller molecules, but may combine to produce residues with larger molecular mass, even amorphous covalent solids.

In many settings, some amounts of oxygen, water, or other substances may be present, so that combustion, hydrolysis, or other chemical processes may occur besides pyrolysis proper. Sometimes those chemicals are added intentionally, as in the burning of firewood, in the traditional manufacture of charcoal, and in the steam cracking of crude oil.

Conversely, the starting material may be heated in a vacuum or in an inert atmosphere to avoid chemical side reactions (such as combustion or hydrolysis). Pyrolysis in a vacuum also lowers the boiling point of the byproducts, improving their recovery.

When organic matter is heated at increasing temperatures in open containers, the following processes generally occur, in successive or overlapping stages:

* Below about 100 °C, volatiles, including some water, evaporate. Heat-sensitive substances, such as vitamin C and proteins, may partially change or decompose already at this stage.
* At about 100 °C or slightly higher, any remaining water that is merely absorbed in the material is driven off. This process consumes a lot of energy, so the temperature may stop rising until all water has evaporated. Water trapped in crystal structure of hydrates may come off at somewhat higher temperatures.
* Some solid substances, like fats, waxes, and sugars, may melt and separate.
* Between 100 and 500 °C, many common organic molecules break down. Most sugars start decomposing at 160–180 °C. Cellulose, a major component of wood, paper, and cotton fabrics, decomposes at about 350 °C. Lignin, another major wood component, starts decomposing at about 350 °C, but continues releasing volatile products up to 500 °C. The decomposition products usually include water, carbon monoxide and/or carbon dioxide , as well as a large number of organic compounds. Gases and volatile products leave the sample, and some of them may condense again as smoke. Generally, this process also absorbs energy. Some volatiles may ignite and burn, creating a visible flame. The non-volatile residues typically become richer in carbon and form large disordered molecules, with colors ranging between brown and black. At this point the matter is said to have been &quot;charred&quot; or &quot;carbonized&quot;.
* At 200–300 °C, if oxygen has not been excluded, the carbonaceous residue may start to burn, in a highly exothermic reaction, often with no or little visible flame. Once carbon combustion starts, the temperature rises spontaneously, turning the residue into a glowing ember and releasing carbon dioxide and/or monoxide. At this stage, some of the nitrogen still remaining in the residue may be oxidized into nitrogen oxides like and . Sulfur and other elements like chlorine and arsenic may be oxidized and volatilized at this stage.
* Once combustion of the carbonaceous residue is complete, a powdery or solid mineral residue (ash) is often left behind, consisting of inorganic oxidized materials of high melting point. Some of the ash may have left during combustion, entrained by the gases as fly ash or particulate emissions. Metals present in the original matter usually remain in the ash as oxides or carbonates, such as potash. Phosphorus, from materials such as bone, phospholipids, and nucleic acids, usually remains as phosphates.

==Safety challenges==
Because pyrolysis takes place at high temperatures which exceed the autoignition temperature of the produced gases, an explosion risk exists if oxygen is present. To control the temperature of pyrolysis systems careful temperature control is needed and can be accomplished with an open source pyrolysis controller. Pyrolysis also produces various toxic gases, mainly carbon monoxide. The greatest risk of fire, explosion and release of toxic gases comes when the system is starting up and shutting down, operating intermittently, or during operational upsets.

Inert gas purging is essential to manage inherent explosion risks. The procedure is not trivial and failure to keep oxygen out has led to accidents.

== Occurrence and uses ==

===Clandestine chemistry===
Conversion of CBD to THC can be brought about by pyrolysis.

===Cooking===
Pyrolysis has many applications in food preparation. Caramelization is the pyrolysis of sugars in food (often after the sugars have been produced by the breakdown of polysaccharides). The food goes brown and changes flavor. The distinctive flavors are used in many dishes; for instance, caramelized onion is used in French onion soup. The temperatures needed for caramelization lie above the boiling point of water. Frying oil can easily rise above the boiling point. Putting a lid on the frying pan keeps the water in, and some of it re-condenses, keeping the temperature too cool to brown for longer time.

Pyrolysis of food can also be undesirable, as in the charring of burnt food (at temperatures too low for the oxidative combustion of carbon to produce flames and burn the food to ash).

=== Coke, carbon, charcoals, and chars ===
Carbon and carbon-rich materials have desirable properties but are nonvolatile, even at high temperatures. Consequently, pyrolysis is used to produce many kinds of carbon; these can be used for fuel, as reagents in steelmaking (coke), and as structural materials.

Charcoal is a less smoky fuel than pyrolyzed wood. Some cities ban, or used to ban, wood fires; when residents only use charcoal (and similarly treated rock coal, called &quot;coke&quot;) air pollution is significantly reduced. In cities where people do not generally cook or heat with fires, this is not needed. In the mid-20th century, &quot;smokeless&quot; legislation in Europe required cleaner-burning techniques, such as coke fuel and smoke-burning incinerators as an effective measure to reduce air pollution


The coke-making or &quot;coking&quot; process consists of heating the material in &quot;coking ovens&quot; to very high temperatures (up to ) so that the molecules are broken down into lighter volatile substances, which leave the vessel, and a porous but hard residue that is mostly carbon and inorganic ash. The amount of volatiles varies with the source material, but is typically 25–30% of it by weight. High temperature pyrolysis is used on an industrial scale to convert coal into coke. This is useful in metallurgy, where the higher temperatures are necessary for many processes, such as steelmaking. Volatile by-products of this process are also often useful, including benzene and pyridine. Coke can also be produced from the solid residue left from petroleum refining.

The original vascular structure of the wood and the pores created by escaping gases combine to produce a light and porous material. By starting with a dense wood-like material, such as nutshells or peach stones, one obtains a form of charcoal with particularly fine pores (and hence a much larger pore surface area), called activated carbon, which is used as an adsorbent for a wide range of chemical substances.

Biochar is the residue of incomplete organic pyrolysis, e.g., from cooking fires. It is a key component of the terra preta soils associated with ancient indigenous communities of the Amazon basin. Terra preta is much sought by local farmers for its superior fertility and capacity to promote and retain an enhanced suite of beneficial microbiota, compared to the typical red soil of the region. Efforts are underway to recreate these soils through biochar, the solid residue of pyrolysis of various materials, mostly organic waste.

Carbon fibers are filaments of carbon that can be used to make very strong yarns and textiles. Carbon fiber items are often produced by spinning and weaving the desired item from fibers of a suitable polymer, and then pyrolyzing the material at a high temperature (from ). The first carbon fibers were made from rayon, but polyacrylonitrile has become the most common starting material. For their first workable electric lamps, Joseph Wilson Swan and Thomas Edison used carbon filaments made by pyrolysis of cotton yarns and bamboo splinters, respectively.

Pyrolysis is the reaction used to coat a preformed substrate with a layer of pyrolytic carbon. This is typically done in a fluidized bed reactor heated to . Pyrolytic carbon coatings are used in many applications, including artificial heart valves.

=== Liquid and gaseous biofuels ===

Pyrolysis is the basis of several methods for producing fuel from biomass, i.e. lignocellulosic biomass. Crops studied as biomass feedstock for pyrolysis include native North American prairie grasses such as &quot;switchgrass&quot; and bred versions of other grasses such as &quot;Miscantheus giganteus&quot;. Other sources of organic matter as feedstock for pyrolysis include greenwaste, sawdust, waste wood, leaves, vegetables, nut shells, straw, cotton trash, rice hulls, and orange peels. Animal waste including poultry litter, dairy manure, and potentially other manures are also under evaluation. Some industrial byproducts are also suitable feedstock including paper sludge, distillers grain, and sewage sludge.

In the biomass components, the pyrolysis of hemicellulose happens between 210 and 310 °C. The pyrolysis of cellulose starts from 300 to 315 °C and ends at 360–380 °C, with a peak at 342–354 °C. Lignin starts to decompose at about 200 °C and continues until 1000 °C.

Synthetic diesel fuel by pyrolysis of organic materials is not yet economically competitive. Higher efficiency is sometimes achieved by flash pyrolysis, in which finely divided feedstock is quickly heated to between for less than two seconds.

Syngas is usually produced by pyrolysis.

The low quality of oils produced through pyrolysis can be improved by physical and chemical processes, which might drive up production costs, but may make sense economically as circumstances change.

There is also the possibility of integrating with other processes such as mechanical biological treatment and anaerobic digestion. Fast pyrolysis is also investigated for biomass conversion. Fuel bio-oil can also be produced by hydrous pyrolysis.

===Methane pyrolysis for hydrogen===

Methane pyrolysis is an industrial process for &quot;turquoise&quot; hydrogen production from methane by removing solid carbon from natural gas. This one-step process produces hydrogen in high volume at low cost (less than steam reforming with carbon sequestration). No greenhouse gas is released. No deep well injection of carbon dioxide is needed. Only water is released when hydrogen is used as the fuel for fuel-cell electric heavy truck transportation,
 gas turbine electric power generation, and hydrogen for industrial processes including producing ammonia fertilizer and cement. Methane pyrolysis is the process operating around 1065 °C for producing hydrogen from natural gas that allows removal of carbon easily (solid carbon is a byproduct of the process). The industrial quality solid carbon can then be sold or landfilled and is not released into the atmosphere, avoiding emission of greenhouse gas (GHG) or ground water pollution from a landfill. In 2015, a company called Monolith Materials built a pilot plant in Redwood City, CA to study scaling Methane Pyrolysis using renewable power in the process.  A successful pilot project then led to a larger commercial-scale demonstration plant in Hallam, Nebraska in 2016.  As of 2020, this plant is operational and can produce around 14 metric tons of hydrogen per day.  In 2021, the US Department of Energy backed Monolith Materials&#x27; plans for major expansion with a $1B loan guarantee.  The funding will help produce a plant capable of generating 164 metric tons of hydrogen per day by 2024. Pilots with gas utilities and biogas plants are underway with companies like Modern Hydrogen. Volume production is also being evaluated in the BASF &quot;methane pyrolysis at scale&quot; pilot plant, the chemical engineering team at University of California - Santa Barbara and in such research laboratories as Karlsruhe Liquid-metal Laboratory (KALLA). Power for process heat consumed is only one-seventh of the power consumed in the water electrolysis method for producing hydrogen.

The Australian company Hazer Group was founded in 2010 to commercialise technology originally developed at the University of Western Australia.  The company was listed on the ASX in December 2015. It is completing a commercial demonstration project to produce renewable hydrogen and graphite from wastewater and iron ore as a process catalyst use technology created by the University of Western Australia (UWA). The Commercial Demonstration Plant project is an Australian first, and expected to produce around 100 tonnes of fuel-grade hydrogen and 380 tonnes of graphite each year starting in 2023. It was scheduled to commence in 2022. &quot;10 December 2021: Hazer Group (ASX: HZR) regret to advise that there has been a delay to the completion of the fabrication of the reactor for the Hazer Commercial Demonstration Project (CDP). This is expected to delay the planned commissioning of the Hazer CDP, with commissioning now expected to occur after our current target date of 1Q 2022.&quot; The Hazer Group has collaboration agreements with Engie for a facility in France in May 2023, A Memorandum of Understanding with Chubu Electric &amp; Chiyoda in Japan April 2023 and an agreement with Suncor Energy and FortisBC to develop 2,500 tonnes per Annum Burrard-Hazer Hydrogen Production Plant in Canada April 2022

The American company C-Zero&#x27;s technology converts natural gas into hydrogen and solid carbon. The hydrogen provides clean, low-cost energy on demand, while the carbon can be permanently sequestered. C-Zero announced in June 2022 that it closed a $34 million financing round led by SK Gas, a subsidiary of South Korea&#x27;s second-largest conglomerate, the SK Group. SK Gas was joined by two other new investors, Engie New Ventures and Trafigura, one of the world&#x27;s largest physical commodities trading companies, in addition to participation from existing investors including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Eni Next, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and AP Ventures. Funding was for C-Zero&#x27;s first pilot plant, which was expected to be online in Q1 2023. The plant may be capable of producing up to 400 kg of hydrogen per day from natural gas with no CO2 emissions.
One of the world&#x27;s largest chemical companies, BASF, has been researching hydrogen pyrolysis for more than 10 years.

===Ethylene===
Pyrolysis is used to produce ethylene, the chemical compound produced on the largest scale industrially (&gt;110 million tons/year in 2005). In this process, hydrocarbons from petroleum are heated to around in the presence of steam; this is called steam cracking. The resulting ethylene is used to make antifreeze (ethylene glycol), PVC (via vinyl chloride), and many other polymers, such as polyethylene and polystyrene.

=== Semiconductors ===

The process of metalorganic vapour-phase epitaxy (MOCVD) entails pyrolysis of volatile organometallic compounds to give semiconductors, hard coatings, and other applicable materials. The reactions entail thermal degradation of precursors, with deposition of the inorganic component and release of the hydrocarbons as gaseous waste. Since it is an atom-by-atom deposition, these atoms organize themselves into crystals to form the bulk semiconductor. Raw polycrystalline silicon is produced by the chemical vapor deposition of silane gases:
Gallium arsenide, another semiconductor, forms upon co-pyrolysis of trimethylgallium and arsine.

=== Waste management===

Pyrolysis can also be used to treat municipal solid waste and plastic waste. The main advantage is the reduction in volume of the waste. In principle, pyrolysis will regenerate the monomers (precursors) to the polymers that are treated, but in practice the process is neither a clean nor an economically competitive source of monomers.

In tire waste management, tire pyrolysis is a well-developed technology.
Other products from car tire pyrolysis include steel wires, carbon black and bitumen. The area faces legislative, economic, and marketing obstacles. Oil derived from tire rubber pyrolysis has a high sulfur content, which gives it high potential as a pollutant; consequently it should be desulfurized.

Alkaline pyrolysis of sewage sludge at low temperature of 500 °C can enhance H2 production with in-situ carbon capture. The use of NaOH (sodium hydroxide) has the potential to produce H2-rich gas that can be used for fuels cells directly.

In early November 2021, the U.S. State of Georgia announced a joint effort with Igneo Technologies to build an $85 million large electronics recycling plant in the Port of Savannah. The project will focus on lower-value, plastics-heavy devices in the waste stream using multiple shredders and furnaces using pyrolysis technology.

==== One-stepwise pyrolysis and Two-stepwise pyrolysis for Tobacco Waste ====
Pyrolysis has also been used for trying to mitigate tobacco waste. One method was done where tobacco waste was separated into two categories TLW (Tobacco Leaf Waste) and TSW (Tobacco Stick Waste). TLW was determined to be any waste from cigarettes and TSW was determined to be any waste from electronic cigarettes. Both TLW and TSW were dried at 80 °C for 24 hours and stored in a desiccator. Samples were grounded so that the contents were uniform. Tobacco Waste (TW) also contains inorganic (metal) contents, which was determined using an inductively coupled plasma-optical spectrometer. Thermo-gravimetric analysis was used to thermally degrade four samples (TLW, TSW, glycerol, and guar gum) and monitored under specific dynamic temperature conditions. About one gram of both TLW and TSW were used in the pyrolysis tests. During these analysis tests, CO2 and N2 were used as atmospheres inside of a tubular reactor that was built using quartz tubing. For both CO2 and N2 atmospheres the flow rate was 100 mL min−1. External heating was created via a tubular furnace. The pyrogenic products were classified into three phases. The first phase was biochar, a solid residue produced by the reactor at 650 °C. The second phase liquid hydrocarbons were collected by a cold solvent trap and sorted by using chromatography. The third and final phase was analyzed using an online micro GC unit and those pyrolysates were gases.

Two different types of experiments were conducted: one-stepwise pyrolysis and two-stepwise pyrolysis. One-stepwise pyrolysis consisted of a constant heating rate (10 °C min−1) from 30 to 720 °C. In the second step of the two-stepwise pyrolysis test the pyrolysates from the one-stepwise pyrolysis were pyrolyzed in the second heating zone which was controlled isothermally at 650 °C. The two-stepwise pyrolysis was used to focus primarily on how well CO2 affects carbon redistribution when adding heat through the second heating zone.

First noted was the thermolytic behaviors of TLW and TSW in both the CO2 and N2 environments. For both TLW and TSW the thermolytic behaviors were identical at less than or equal to 660 °C in the CO2 and N2 environments. The differences between the environments start to occur when temperatures increase above 660 °C and the residual mass percentages significantly decrease in the CO2 environment compared to that in the N2 environment. This observation is likely due to the Boudouard reaction, where we see spontaneous gasification happening when temperatures exceed 710 °C. Although these observations were seen at temperatures lower than 710 °C it is most likely due to the catalytic capabilities of inorganics in TLW. It was further investigated by doing ICP-OES measurements and found that a fifth of the residual mass percentage was Ca species. CaCO3 is used in cigarette papers and filter material, leading to the explanation that degradation of CaCO3 causes pure CO2 reacting with CaO in a dynamic equilibrium state. This being the reason for seeing mass decay between 660 °C and 710 °C. Differences in differential thermogram (DTG) peaks for TLW were compared to TSW. TLW had four distinctive peaks at 87, 195, 265, and 306 °C whereas TSW had two major drop offs at 200 and 306 °C with one spike in between. The four peaks indicated that TLW contains more diverse types of additives than TSW. The residual mass percentage between TLW and TSW was further compared, where the residual mass in TSW was less than that of TLW for both CO2 and N2 environments concluding that TSW has higher quantities of additives than TLW. 
The one-stepwise pyrolysis experiment showed different results for the CO2 and N2 environments. During this process the evolution of 5 different notable gases were observed. Hydrogen, Methane, Ethane, Carbon Dioxide, and Ethylene all are produced when the thermolytic rate of TLW began to be retarded at greater than or equal to 500 °C. Thermolytic rate begins at the same temperatures for both the CO2 and N2 environment but there is higher concentration of the production of Hydrogen, Ethane, Ethylene, and Methane in the N2 environment than that in the CO2 environment. The concentration of CO in the CO2 environment is significantly greater as temperatures increase past 600 °C and this is due to CO2 being liberated from CaCO3 in TLW. This significant increase in CO concentration is why there is lower concentrations of other gases produced in the CO2 environment due to a dilution effect. Since pyrolysis is the re-distribution of carbons in carbon substrates into three pyrogenic products. The CO2 environment is going to be more effective because the CO2 reduction into CO allows for the oxidation of pyrolysates to form CO. In conclusion the CO2 environment allows a higher yield of gases than oil and biochar. When the same process is done for TSW the trends are almost identical therefore the same explanations can be applied to the pyrolysis of TSW.

Harmful chemicals were reduced in the CO2 environment due to CO formation causing tar to be reduced. One-stepwise pyrolysis was not that effective on activating CO2 on carbon rearrangement due to the high quantities of liquid pyrolysates (tar). Two-stepwise pyrolysis for the CO2 environment allowed for greater concentrations of gases due to the second heating zone. The second heating zone was at a consistent temperature of 650 °C isothermally. More reactions between CO2 and gaseous pyrolysates with longer residence time meant that CO2 could further convert pyrolysates into CO. The results showed that the two-stepwise pyrolysis was an effective way to decrease tar content and increase gas concentration by about 10 wt.% for both TLW (64.20 wt.%) and TSW (73.71%).

=== Thermal cleaning ===

Pyrolysis is also used for &quot;thermal cleaning&quot;, an industrial application to remove organic substances such as polymers, plastics and coatings from parts, products or production components like extruder screws, spinnerets and static mixers. During the thermal cleaning process, at temperatures from , organic material is converted by pyrolysis and oxidation into volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons and carbonized gas. Inorganic elements remain.

Several types of thermal cleaning systems use pyrolysis:
* &quot;Molten Salt Baths&quot; belong to the oldest thermal cleaning systems; cleaning with a molten salt bath is very fast but implies the risk of dangerous splatters, or other potential hazards connected with the use of salt baths, like explosions or highly toxic hydrogen cyanide gas.
* &quot;Fluidized Bed Systems&quot; use sand or aluminium oxide as heating medium; these systems also clean very fast but the medium does not melt or boil, nor emit any vapors or odors; the cleaning process takes one to two hours.
* &quot;Vacuum Ovens&quot; use pyrolysis in a vacuum avoiding uncontrolled combustion inside the cleaning chamber; the cleaning process takes 8 to 30 hours.
* &quot;Burn-Off Ovens&quot;, also known as &quot;Heat-Cleaning Ovens&quot;, are gas-fired and used in the painting, coatings, electric motors and plastics industries for removing organics from heavy and large metal parts.

===Fine chemical synthesis===
Pyrolysis is used in the production of chemical compounds, mainly, but not only, in the research laboratory.

The area of boron-hydride clusters started with the study of the pyrolysis of diborane (B2H6) at ca. 200 °C. Products include the clusters pentaborane and decaborane. These pyrolyses involve not only cracking (to give H2), but also recondensation.

The synthesis of nanoparticles, zirconia and oxides utilizing an ultrasonic nozzle in a process called ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP).

===Other uses and occurrences===
* Pyrolysis is used to turn organic materials into carbon for the purpose of carbon-14 dating.
* Pyrolysis liquids from slow pyrolysis of bark and hemp have been tested for their antifungal activity against wood decaying fungi, showing potential to substitute the current wood preservatives while further tests are still required. However, their ecotoxicity is very variable and while some are less toxic than current wood preservatives, other pyrolysis liquids have shown high ecotoxicity, what may cause detrimental effects in the environment.
* Pyrolysis of tobacco, paper, and additives, in cigarettes and other products, generates many volatile products (including nicotine, carbon monoxide, and tar) that are responsible for the aroma and negative health effects of smoking. Similar considerations apply to the smoking of marijuana and the burning of incense products and mosquito coils.
* Pyrolysis occurs during the incineration of trash, potentially generating volatiles that are toxic or contribute to air pollution if not completely burned.
* Laboratory or industrial equipment sometimes gets fouled by carbonaceous residues that result from coking, the pyrolysis of organic products that come into contact with hot surfaces.

== PAHs generation ==
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can be generated from the pyrolysis of different solid waste fractions, such as hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, pectin, starch, polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PS, PVC, and lignin generate significant amount of PAHs. Naphthalene is the most abundant PAH among all the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

When the temperature is increased from 500 to 900 °C, most PAHs increase. With increasing temperature, the percentage of light PAHs decreases and the percentage of heavy PAHs increases.

== Study tools ==

=== Thermogravimetric analysis ===
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is one of the most common techniques to investigate pyrolysis with no limitations of heat and mass transfer. The results can be used to determine mass loss kinetics. Activation energies can be calculated using the Kissinger method or peak analysis-least square method (PA-LSM).

TGA can couple with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and mass spectrometry. As the temperature increases, the volatiles generated from pyrolysis can be measured.

=== Macro-TGA ===
In TGA, the sample is loaded first before the increase of temperature, and the heating rate is low (less than 100 °C min−1). Macro-TGA can use gram-scale samples to investigate the effects of pyrolysis with mass and heat transfer.

=== Pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry ===
Pyrolysis mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) is an important laboratory procedure to determine the structure of compounds.

===Machine learning===
In recent years, machine learning has attracted significant research interest in predicting yields, optimizing parameters, and monitoring pyrolytic processes.

<text>Joseph Rudolph &quot;Philly Joe&quot; Jones (July 15, 1923 – August 30, 1985) was an American jazz drummer.

==Biography==
===Early career===
As a child, Jones appeared as a featured tap dancer on &quot;The Kiddie Show&quot; on the Philadelphia radio station WIP. He was in the US Army during World War II.

In 1947 he became the house drummer at Café Society in New York City, where he played with the leading bebop players of the day, including Tadd Dameron. From 1955 to 1958, Jones toured and recorded with the Miles Davis Quintet – a band that became known as &quot;the Quintet&quot; (along with Red Garland on piano, John Coltrane on sax, and Paul Chambers on bass). Davis acknowledged that Jones was his favorite drummer, and stated in his autobiography that he would always listen for Jones in other drummers.

From 1958, Jones worked as a leader, but continued to work as a sideman with other musicians, including Bill Evans and Hank Mobley. Evans, like Davis, also openly stated that Jones was his all-time favorite drummer.

===Europe===

Between late 1967 and 1972 Jones lived in London and Paris, performing and recording with musicians including Archie Shepp, Mal Waldron and Hank Mobley. For two years (1967–1969) Jones taught at a specially organized school in Hampstead, London, but was prevented from otherwise working in the UK by the Musicians&#x27; Union. His 1968 album &quot;Mo&#x27; Joe&quot; (also released as &quot;Trailways Express&quot;) was recorded in London with local musicians (including Peter King, Harold McNair, Chris Pyne, Kenny Wheeler and others).

===Later years===
Jones toured with Bill Evans in 1976 and 1978, recorded for Galaxy in 1977–1979, and made studio and live recordings with Red Garland in 1977. In 1981, Jones helped to found the group Dameronia, dedicated to the music of the composer Tadd Dameron, and led it until Jones&#x27; death from a heart attack in 1985.

<text>Gasification is a process that converts biomass- or fossil fuel-based carbonaceous materials into gases, including as the largest fractions: nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2), and carbon dioxide (). This is achieved by reacting the feedstock material at high temperatures (typically &gt;700 °C), without combustion, via controlling the amount of oxygen and/or steam present in the reaction. The resulting gas mixture is called syngas (from synthesis gas) or producer gas and is itself a fuel due to the flammability of the H2 and CO of which the gas is largely composed. Power can be derived from the subsequent combustion of the resultant gas, and is considered to be a source of renewable energy if the gasified compounds were obtained from biomass feedstock.

An advantage of gasification is that syngas can be more efficient than direct combustion of the original feedstock material because it can be combusted at higher temperatures so that the thermodynamic upper limit to the efficiency defined by Carnot&#x27;s rule is higher. Syngas may also be used as the hydrogen source in fuel cells, however the syngas produced by most gasification systems requires additional processing and reforming to remove the contaminants and other gases such as CO and to be suitable for low-temperature fuel cell use, but high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells are capable of directly accepting mixtures of H2, CO, CO2, steam, and methane.

Syngas is most commonly burned directly in gas engines, used to produce methanol and hydrogen, or converted via the Fischer–Tropsch process into synthetic fuel. For some materials gasification can be an alternative to landfilling and incineration, resulting in lowered emissions of atmospheric pollutants such as methane and particulates. Some gasification processes aim at refining out corrosive ash elements such as chloride and potassium, allowing clean gas production from otherwise problematic feedstock material. Gasification of fossil fuels is currently widely used on industrial scales to generate electricity. Gasification can generate lower amounts of some pollutants as SOx and than combustion.

==History==
Energy has been produced at industrial scale via gasification since the early 19th century. Initially coal and peat were gasified to produce town gas for lighting and cooking, with the first public street lighting installed in Pall
Mall, London on January 28, 1807, spreading shortly to supply commercial gas lighting to most industrialized cities until the end of the 19th century when it was replaced with electrical lighting. Gasification and syngas continued to be used in blast furnaces and more significantly in the production of synthetic chemicals where it has been in use since the 1920s. The thousands of sites left toxic residue. Some sites have been remediated, while others are still polluted.

During both world wars, especially the World War II, the need for fuel produced by gasification reemerged due to the shortage of petroleum. Wood gas generators, called Gasogene or Gazogène, were used to power motor vehicles in Europe. By 1945 there were trucks, buses and agricultural machines that were powered by gasification. It is estimated that there were close to 9,000,000 vehicles running on producer gas all over the world.

Another example, the Xe than (literally, &quot;coal car&quot; in Vietnamese) was a minibus that has been converted to run on coal instead of gasoline. This modification regained popularity in Vietnam during the subsidy period, when gasoline was in short supply. became much less common during the Đổi Mới period, when gasoline became widely accessible again.

==Chemical reactions==
In a gasifier, the carbonaceous material undergoes several different processes:
# The dehydration or drying process occurs at around 100 °C. Typically the resulting steam is mixed into the gas flow and may be involved with subsequent chemical reactions, notably the water-gas reaction if the temperature is sufficiently high (see step #5).
# The &quot;pyrolysis&quot; (or devolatilization) process occurs at around 200–300 °C. Volatiles are released and char is produced, resulting in up to 70% weight loss for coal. The process is dependent on the properties of the carbonaceous material and determines the structure and composition of the char, which will then undergo gasification reactions.
# The &quot;combustion&quot; process occurs as the volatile products and some of the char react with oxygen to primarily form carbon dioxide and small amounts of carbon monoxide, which provides heat for the subsequent gasification reactions. Letting C represent a carbon-containing organic compound, the basic reaction here is C + O2 → CO2.
# The &quot;gasification&quot; process occurs as the char reacts with steam and carbon dioxide to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen, via the reactions C + H2O → H2 + CO and C + CO2 → 2CO.
# In addition, the reversible gas phase water-gas shift reaction reaches equilibrium very fast at the temperatures in a gasifier. This balances the concentrations of carbon monoxide, steam, carbon dioxide and hydrogen: CO + H2O ⇌ CO2 + H2.

In essence, a limited amount of oxygen or air is introduced into the reactor to allow some of the organic material to be &quot;burned&quot; to produce carbon dioxide and energy, which drives a second reaction that converts further organic material to hydrogen and additional carbon dioxide. Further reactions occur when the formed carbon monoxide and residual water from the organic material react to form methane and excess carbon dioxide (4CO + 2H2O → CH4 + 3CO2). This third reaction occurs more abundantly in reactors that increase the residence time of the reactive gases and organic materials, as well as heat and pressure. Catalysts are used in more sophisticated reactors to improve reaction rates, thus moving the system closer to the reaction equilibrium for a fixed residence time.

==Processes==

Several types of gasifiers are currently available for commercial use: counter-current fixed bed, co-current fixed bed, fluidized bed, entrained flow, plasma, and free radical.

===Counter-current fixed bed (&quot;up draft&quot;) gasifier===
A fixed bed of carbonaceous fuel (e.g. coal or biomass) through which the &quot;gasification agent&quot; (steam, oxygen and/or air) flows in counter-current configuration. The ash is either removed in the dry condition or as a slag. The slagging gasifiers have a lower ratio of steam to carbon, achieving temperatures higher than the ash fusion temperature. The nature of the gasifier means that the fuel must have high mechanical strength and must ideally be non-caking so that it will form a permeable bed, although recent developments have reduced these restrictions to some extent. The throughput for this type of gasifier is relatively low. Thermal efficiency is high as the temperatures in the gas exit are relatively low. However, this means that tar and methane production is significant at typical operation temperatures, so product gas must be extensively cleaned before use. The tar can be recycled to the reactor.

In the gasification of fine, undensified biomass such as rice hulls, it is necessary to blow air into the reactor by means of a fan. This creates very high gasification temperature, as high as 1000 C. Above the gasification zone, a bed of fine and hot char is formed, and as the gas is blow forced through this bed, most complex hydrocarbons are broken down into simple components of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

===Co-current fixed bed (&quot;down draft&quot;) gasifier===
Similar to the counter-current type, but the gasification agent gas flows in co-current configuration with the fuel (downwards, hence the name &quot;down draft gasifier&quot;). Heat needs to be added to the upper part of the bed, either by combusting small amounts of the fuel or from external heat sources. The produced gas leaves the gasifier at a high temperature, and most of this heat is often transferred to the gasification agent added in the top of the bed, resulting in an energy efficiency on level with the counter-current type. Since all tars must pass through a hot bed of char in this configuration, tar levels are much lower than the counter-current type.

===Fluidized bed reactor===
The fuel is fluidized in oxygen and steam or air. The ash is removed dry or as heavy agglomerates that defluidize. The temperatures are relatively low in dry ash gasifiers, so the fuel must be highly reactive; low-grade coals are particularly suitable. The agglomerating gasifiers have slightly higher temperatures, and are suitable for higher rank coals. Fuel throughput is higher than for the fixed bed, but not as high as for the entrained flow gasifier. The conversion efficiency can be rather low due to elutriation of carbonaceous material. Recycle or subsequent combustion of solids can be used to increase conversion. Fluidized bed gasifiers are most useful for fuels that form highly corrosive ash that would damage the walls of slagging gasifiers. Biomass fuels generally contain high levels of corrosive ash.

Fluidized bed gasifiers uses inert bed material at a fluidized state which enhance the heat and biomass distribution inside a gasifier. At a fluidized state, the superficial fluid velocity is greater than the minimum fluidization velocity required to lift the bed material against the weight of the bed. Fluidized bed gasifiers are divided into Bubbling Fluidized Bed (BFB), Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) and Dual Fluidized Bed (DFB) gasifiers.

===Entrained flow gasifier===
A dry pulverized solid, an atomized liquid fuel or a fuel slurry is gasified with oxygen (much less frequent: air) in co-current flow. The gasification reactions take place in a dense cloud of very fine particles. Most coals are suitable for this type of gasifier because of the high operating temperatures and because the coal particles are well separated from one another.

The high temperatures and pressures also mean that a higher throughput can be achieved, however thermal efficiency is somewhat lower as the gas must be cooled before it can be cleaned with existing technology. The high temperatures also mean that tar and methane are not present in the product gas; however the oxygen requirement is higher than for the other types of gasifiers. All entrained flow gasifiers remove the major part of the ash as a slag as the operating temperature is well above the ash fusion temperature.

A smaller fraction of the ash is produced either as a very fine dry fly ash or as a black colored fly ash slurry. Some fuels, in particular certain types of biomasses, can form slag that is corrosive for ceramic inner walls that serve to protect the gasifier outer wall. However some entrained flow type of gasifiers do not possess a ceramic inner wall but have an inner water or steam cooled wall covered with partially solidified slag. These types of gasifiers do not suffer from corrosive slags.

Some fuels have ashes with very high ash fusion temperatures. In this case mostly limestone is mixed with the fuel prior to gasification. Addition of a little limestone will usually suffice for the lowering the fusion temperatures. The fuel particles must be much smaller than for other types of gasifiers. This means the fuel must be pulverized, which requires somewhat more energy than for the other types of gasifiers. By far the most energy consumption related to entrained flow gasification is not the milling of the fuel but the production of oxygen used for the gasification.

===Plasma gasifier===
In a plasma gasifier a high-voltage current is fed to a torch, creating a high-temperature arc. The inorganic residue is retrieved as a glass like substance.

==Feedstock==
There are a large number of different feedstock types for use in a gasifier, each with different characteristics, including size, shape, bulk density, moisture content, energy content, chemical composition, ash fusion characteristics, and homogeneity of all these properties. Coal and petroleum coke are used as primary feedstocks for many large gasification plants worldwide. Additionally, a variety of biomass and waste-derived feedstocks can be gasified, with wood pellets and chips, waste wood, plastics and aluminium, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), Refuse-derived fuel (RDF), agricultural and industrial wastes, sewage sludge, switch grass, discarded seed corn, corn stover and other crop residues all being used.

Chemrec has developed a process for gasification of black liquor.

===Waste disposal===
Waste gasification has several advantages over incineration:
* The necessary extensive flue gas cleaning may be performed on the syngas instead of the much larger volume of flue gas after combustion.
* Electric power may be generated in engines and gas turbines, which are much cheaper and more efficient than the steam cycle used in incineration. Even fuel cells may potentially be used, but these have rather severe requirements regarding the purity of the gas.
* Chemical processing (Gas to liquids) of the syngas may produce other synthetic fuels instead of electricity.
* Some gasification processes treat ash containing heavy metals at very high temperatures so that it is released in a glassy and chemically stable form.

A major challenge for waste gasification technologies is to reach an acceptable (positive) gross electric efficiency. The high efficiency of converting syngas to electric power is counteracted by significant power consumption in the waste preprocessing, the consumption of large amounts of pure oxygen (which is often used as gasification agent), and gas cleaning. Another challenge becoming apparent when implementing the processes in real life is to obtain long service intervals in the plants, so that it is not necessary to close down the plant every few months for cleaning the reactor.

Environmental advocates have called gasification &quot;incineration in disguise&quot; and argue that the technology is still dangerous to air quality and public health. &quot;Since 2003 numerous proposals for waste treatment facilities hoping to use... gasification technologies failed to receive final approval to operate when the claims of project proponents did not withstand public and governmental scrutiny of key claims,&quot; according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives. One facility which operated from 2009–2011 in Ottawa had 29 &quot;emissions incidents&quot; and 13 &quot;spills&quot; over those three years. It was also only able to operate roughly 25% of the time.

Several waste gasification processes have been proposed, but few have yet been built and tested, and only a handful have been implemented as plants processing real waste, and most of the time in combination with fossil fuels.

One plant (in Chiba, Japan, using the Thermoselect process) has been processing industrial waste with natural gas and purified oxygen since year 2000, but has not yet documented positive net energy production from the process.

In 2007 Ze-gen erected a waste gasification demonstration facility in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The facility was designed to demonstrate gasification of specific non-MSW waste streams using &quot;liquid metal gasification&quot;. This facility came after widespread public opposition shelved plans for a similar plant in Attleboro, Massachusetts. Today Ze-gen appears to be defunct, and the company website was taken down in 2014.

Also in the US, in 2011 a plasma system delivered by PyroGenesis Canada Inc. was tested to gasify municipal solid waste, hazardous waste and biomedical waste at the Hurlburt Field Florida Special Operations Command Air Force base. The plant, which cost $7.4 million to construct, was closed and sold at a government liquidation auction in May 2013. The opening bid was $25. The winning bid was sealed.

In December 2022, the Sierra BioFuels Plant opened in Reno, Nevada, converting landfill waste to synthetic crude oil. 

==Current applications==
Syngas can be used for heat production and for generation of mechanical and electrical power. Like other gaseous fuels, producer gas gives greater control over power levels when compared to solid fuels, leading to more efficient and cleaner operation.

Syngas can also be used for further processing to liquid fuels or chemicals.

===Heat===
Gasifiers offer a flexible option for thermal applications, as they can be retrofitted into existing gas fueled devices such as ovens, furnaces, boilers, etc., where syngas may replace fossil fuels. Heating values of syngas are generally around 4–10 MJ/m3.

===Electricity===
Currently Industrial-scale gasification is primarily used to produce electricity from fossil fuels such as coal, where the syngas is burned in a gas turbine. Gasification is also used industrially in the production of electricity, ammonia and liquid fuels (oil) using Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles (IGCC), with the possibility of producing methane and hydrogen for fuel cells. IGCC is also a more efficient method of CO2 capture as compared to conventional technologies. IGCC demonstration plants have been operating since the early 1970s and some of the plants constructed in the 1990s are now entering commercial service.

===Combined heat and power===
In small business and building applications, where the wood source is sustainable, 250–1000 kWe and new zero carbon biomass gasification plants have been installed in Europe that produce tar free syngas from wood and burn it in reciprocating engines connected to a generator with heat recovery. This type of plant is often referred to as a wood biomass CHP unit but is a plant with seven different processes: biomass processing, fuel delivery, gasification, gas cleaning, waste disposal, electricity generation and heat recovery.

===Transport fuel===
Diesel engines can be operated on dual fuel mode using producer gas. Diesel substitution of over 80% at high loads and 70–80% under normal load variations can easily be achieved. Spark ignition engines and solid oxide fuel cells can operate on 100% gasification gas. Mechanical energy from the engines may be used for e.g. driving water pumps for irrigation or for coupling with an alternator for electrical power generation.

While small scale gasifiers have existed for well over 100 years, there have been few sources to obtain a ready-to-use machine. Small scale devices are typically DIY projects. However, currently in the United States, several companies offer gasifiers to operate small engines.

===Renewable energy and fuels===

In principle, gasification can proceed from just about any organic material, including biomass and plastic waste. The resulting syngas can be combusted. Alternatively, if the syngas is clean enough, it may be used for power production in gas engines, gas turbines or even fuel cells, or converted efficiently to dimethyl ether (DME) by methanol dehydration, methane via the Sabatier reaction, or diesel-like synthetic fuel via the Fischer–Tropsch process. In many gasification processes most of the inorganic components of the input material, such as metals and minerals, are retained in the ash. In some gasification processes (slagging gasification) this ash has the form of a glassy solid with low leaching properties, but the net power production in slagging gasification is low (sometimes negative) and costs are higher.

Regardless of the final fuel form, gasification itself and subsequent processing neither directly emits nor traps greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Power consumption in the gasification and syngas conversion processes may be significant though, and may indirectly cause CO2 emissions; in slagging and plasma gasification, the electricity consumption may even exceed any power production from the syngas.

Combustion of syngas or derived fuels emits exactly the same amount of carbon dioxide as would have been emitted from direct combustion of the initial fuel. Biomass gasification and combustion could play a significant role in a renewable energy economy, because biomass production removes the same amount of CO2 from the atmosphere as is emitted from gasification and combustion. While other biofuel technologies such as biogas and biodiesel are carbon neutral, gasification in principle may run on a wider variety of input materials and can be used to produce a wider variety of output fuels.

There are at present a few industrial scale biomass gasification plants. Since 2008 in Svenljunga, Sweden, a biomass gasification plant generates up to 14 MWth, supplying industries and citizens of Svenljunga with process steam and district heating, respectively. The gasifier uses biomass fuels such as CCA or creosote impregnated waste wood and other kinds of recycled wood to produces syngas that is combusted on site.

Examples of demonstration projects include:
* The 32 MW dual fluidized bed gasification of the GoBiGas project in Gothenburg, Sweden, produced around 20 MW of substitute natural gas from forest residues and fed it into the natural gas grid since December 2014. The plant was permanently closed due to technical and economical problems in April 2018. Göteborg Energi had invested 175 million euro in the plant and intensive attempts to sell the plant to new investors had failed for a year.
* Those of the Renewable Energy Network Austria, including a plant using dual fluidized bed gasification that has supplied the town of Güssing with 2 MW of electricity, produced utilising GE Jenbacher reciprocating gas engines and 4 MW of heat, generated from wood chips, since 2001. The plant was decommissioned in 2015.
* Go Green Gas&#x27; pilot plant in Swindon, UK has demonstrated methane production from waste feedstocks at 50 kW. The project has prompted the construction of a £25million commercial facility that aims to generate 22GWh per annum of grid-quality natural gas from waste wood and refuse derived fuel, due for completion in 2018.
* Chemrec&#x27;s pilot plant in Piteå that produced 3 MW of clean syngas from entrained flow gasification of black liquor. The plant was closed down permanently due to financial problems in 2016
* The High Temperature Winkler (HTW), a pressurized circulating fluidized bed gasification process. During the 1990s HTW was tested with a variety of different feedstocks, including low-rank coals and various forms of biomass; wood, refuse derived fuel (RDF) and municipal solid waste (MSW). The last HTW facility closed permanently in 2002. Since 2015 tests of the process continues at a 0.1 t/h pilot unit at Darmstadt University, while redesigned full-scale units are proposed in Amsterdam and Rotterdam

<text>Tadley Ewing Peake Dameron (February 21, 1917 – March 8, 1965) was an American jazz composer, arranger, and pianist.

==Biography==

Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Dameron was the most influential arranger of the bebop era, but also wrote charts for swing and hard bop players. The bands he arranged for included those of Count Basie, Artie Shaw, Jimmie Lunceford, Dizzy Gillespie, Billy Eckstine, and Sarah Vaughan. In 1940–41, Dameron was the piano player and arranger for the Kansas City band Harlan Leonard and his Rockets. He and lyricist Carl Sigman wrote &quot;If You Could See Me Now&quot; for Sarah Vaughan and it became one of her first signature songs. According to the composer, his greatest influences were George Gershwin and Duke Ellington.

In the late 1940s, Dameron wrote arrangements for the big band of Dizzy Gillespie, who gave the première of his large-scale orchestral piece &quot;Soulphony in Three Hearts&quot; at Carnegie Hall in 1948. Also in 1948, Dameron led his own group in New York, which included Fats Navarro; the following year, Dameron was at the Paris Jazz Festival with Miles Davis. From 1961, he scored for recordings by Milt Jackson, Sonny Stitt, and Blue Mitchell.

Dameron additionally arranged and played for rhythm and blues musician Bull Moose Jackson. Playing for Jackson at that same time was Benny Golson, who was to become a jazz composer in his own right. Golson has said that Dameron was the most important influence on his writing.

Dameron composed several bop and swing standards, including &quot;Hot House&quot;, &quot;If You Could See Me Now&quot;, &quot;Our Delight&quot;, &quot;Good Bait&quot; (composed for Count Basie) and &quot;Lady Bird&quot;. Dameron&#x27;s bands from the late 1940s and early 1950s featured leading players such as Fats Navarro, Miles Davis, Dexter Gordon, Sonny Rollins, Wardell Gray, and Clifford Brown. In 1956, he led two sessions based on his compositions, released as the 1956 album &quot;Fontainebleau&quot; and the 1957 album &quot;Mating Call&quot;. The latter featured John Coltrane. Dameron developed an addiction to narcotics toward the end of his career. He was arrested on drug charges in 1957 and 1958, and served time (1959–60) in a federal prison hospital in Lexington, Kentucky. After his release, Dameron recorded a single notable project as a leader, The Magic Touch, but was sidelined by health problems; he had several heart attacks before dying of cancer in 1965, at the age of 48. He was buried at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.

<text>IEEE 802.6 is a standard governed by the ANSI for Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN). It is an improvement of an older standard (also created by ANSI) which used the Fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) network structure. The FDDI-based standard failed due to its expensive implementation and lack of compatibility with current LAN standards. The IEEE 802.6 standard uses the Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) network form. This form supports 150 Mbit/s transfer rates. It consists of two unconnected unidirectional buses. DQDB is rated for a maximum of 160 km before significant signal degradation over fiberoptic cable with an optical wavelength of 1310 nm.

This standard has also failed, mostly for the same reasons that the FDDI standard failed. MANs are traditionally designed using Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) or Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). Recent designs use native Ethernet or MPLS.

<doc id="262260" wikidata="Q193397" url="?curid=262260" title="Steve Vai">
<text>Steven Siro Vai ( ; born June 6, 1960) is an American guitarist, songwriter, and producer. A three-time Grammy Award winner and fifteen-time nominee, Vai started his music career in 1978 at the age of eighteen as a transcriptionist for Frank Zappa, and played in Zappa&#x27;s band from 1980 to 1983. He embarked on a solo career in 1983 and has released 11 solo albums to date. He has recorded and toured with Alcatrazz, David Lee Roth, and Whitesnake, as well as recording with artists such as Public Image Ltd, Mary J. Blige, Spinal Tap, Alice Cooper, Motörhead, and Polyphia. Additionally, Vai has toured with live-only acts G3, Zappa Plays Zappa, Beat (playing 1980s era King Crimson) and the Experience Hendrix Tour, as well as headlining international tours.

Vai has been described as a &quot;highly individualistic player&quot; and part of a generation of &quot;heavy rock and metal virtuosi who came to the fore in the 1980s&quot;. He released his first solo album &quot;Flex-Able&quot; in 1984, while his most successful release, &quot;Passion and Warfare&quot; (1990), was described as &quot;the richest and best hard rock guitar-virtuoso album of the &#x27;80s&quot;. He was voted the &quot;10th Greatest Guitarist&quot; by &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine’s readers, and has sold over 15 million records.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Steve Vai, a descendant of Italian immigrants, was born in Carle Place, New York on June 6, 1960. He is the fourth son of John and Theresa Vai. Vai was raised Roman Catholic. He described his first experiences with music as, &quot;at the age of five I walked up to [a] piano, hit a note, and noticed that to the right the notes go higher and to the left the notes go lower. In that very moment, I had a full-on epiphany. I was flooded with the instinctual realization of how music was created and how it worked from a theoretical standpoint—the whole language of music was very obvious. I also understood immediately, instinctually, and unequivocally something that has only deepened through the years: that the creation of music is an infinite personal expression. I realized that I could do this, I could make music, and it could be whatever I want.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;http://facebook.com/MakeWeirdMusic&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a year later, at the age of six, that Vai experienced his first introduction to the guitar, remembering that, &quot;I saw this nine-year-old boy playing the guitar in my grade school auditorium, and that was another epiphany that I had. It was my first recognition of the instrument. When I saw that guitar and I saw this kid playing it, I knew instinctually that I was going to play the guitar someday, and that it would be my instrument. Don&#x27;t ask me how I knew, I just knew. It was the coolest thing I had ever seen.&quot;

As a young child, Vai was influenced by the music his parents had listened to. One album in particular that he cites as his &quot;musical awakening&quot; was the original motion picture soundtrack to the 1961 film &quot;West Side Story&quot;. At age eleven, Vai was introduced to the contemporary rock and progressive music of the era, and after hearing the guitar solo to Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; at age twelve, decided to begin playing the guitar.

In 1973, Vai began to take guitar lessons from fellow New York native Joe Satriani, and played in local bands (The Ohio Express, Circus, and Rayge) throughout his high school years. He spoke of when his friend John Sergio gave him Joe Satriani&#x27;s number to Steve for him and his friend Frankie Munn to get guitar lessons. In 1978, to further pursue his interest in music composition and theory, Vai attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts after graduating from Carle Place High School. While at Berklee, Vai began working for Frank Zappa as a transcriptionist, and in the middle of his fourth semester, moved to California to start his career as a session and touring artist for Zappa. Also while at Berklee, Vai met his future spouse Pia Maiocco. They have been together since they met and have two children. In 2003, Vai was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee.

===Early music career (1978–1986)===

In 1978, Vai sent both a notated transcription of Frank Zappa&#x27;s &quot;The Black Page&quot;, and a recording of his college band, Morning Thunder, to Zappa. Impressed by this, Zappa responded by putting Vai on salary to transcribe his work, which included pieces from the &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; and &quot;Shut Up &#x27;n Play Yer Guitar&quot; albums. After leaving Berklee College of Music and moving to California, Vai auditioned for and became a full-time member of Zappa&#x27;s band, going on his first tour with Zappa in late 1980. Zappa often referred to Vai as his &quot;little Italian virtuoso&quot;, and Vai is frequently listed in the liner notes of Zappa&#x27;s albums as having performed &quot;stunt&quot; or &quot;impossible&quot; guitar parts.

Vai was a featured artist on the 1993 release &quot;Zappa&#x27;s Universe&quot;, and in 2006, Vai appeared as a special guest on Dweezil Zappa&#x27;s Zappa Plays Zappa tour; both projects won Vai a Grammy Award.

After moving on from Zappa&#x27;s employ in 1983, Vai bought a house in Sylmar, Los Angeles, where he built his first professional studio. During this period, Vai formed two bands (The Classified and 777) as well as writing and recording a large amount of music that was not originally intended for release. Out of this material, Vai compiled his first studio album &quot;Flex-Able&quot;. He created his own record label, Akashic Records (later Light Without Heat Records), which he used to take &quot;Flex-Able&quot; directly to distribution channels. &quot;Flex-Able&quot; was released in January 1984.

Vai began his rise to public acclaim in 1983 when, shortly before the release of &quot;Flex-Able&quot;, his composition &quot;The Attitude Song&quot; was published in &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine. The song centered itself on a main guitar riff in the time signature 7/16, played over a rhythm section centered in 4/4. Each following section of the song showcased a number of specialized techniques (such as two-handed tapping, whammy bar acrobatics, sweep picking, alternate picking, multi-part harmonies, and odd phrasing) used in angular and exaggerated ways that were unique to the song at the time. Interest from the public grew even greater when Vai&#x27;s song &quot;Blue Powder&quot; (a demonstration for the Carvin X100b amplifier) was published in &quot;Guitar Player&quot; as well, which showed the virtuoso side of Vai&#x27;s compositional process. Also in 1986, Vai was cast in the film &quot;Crossroads&quot; as the Devil&#x27;s guitar player &quot;Jack Butler&quot;. In the famous &quot;duel scene&quot; between Vai and Ralph Macchio&#x27;s character, Vai wrote and performed all guitar parts with the exception of the slide guitar, which was performed by Ry Cooder.

In between solo work, Vai replaced Yngwie Malmsteen in June 1984 as the lead guitarist of Alcatrazz, with whom he recorded the album &quot;Disturbing the Peace&quot;. Vai left shortly after the subsequent tour to join David Lee Roth&#x27;s band.

===With David Lee Roth (1985–1989)===
In 1985, Vai joined David Lee Roth&#x27;s post-Van Halen band as lead guitarist, together with former Talas bassist Billy Sheehan on bass; and former Maynard Ferguson drummer Gregg Bissonette on drums. The quartet’s debut album &quot;Eat &#x27;Em and Smile&quot;, released on July 7, 1986, was both a critical and commercial success, reaching number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart and selling over two million copies. &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine editor Brad Tolinski commented on Vai&#x27;s playing at the time, saying that &quot;Steve Vai&#x27;s guitar wizardry is so profound that in earlier times he would have been burned as a witch.&quot; Retrospectively, &quot;Eat &#x27;Em and Smile&quot; is frequently evaluated as one of the greatest rock albums of the 1980s. The group&#x27;s Eat &#x27;Em and Smile Tour began in August 1986 and continued through February 1987.

Roth&#x27;s subsequent album &quot;Skyscraper&quot;, released in 1988, was produced by both Roth and Vai. Like its predecessor, the album was a commercial success, reaching number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. In 1989, following the successful Skyscraper Tour, Vai departed from the band. He was replaced by Cacophony guitarist Jason Becker.

In 1985, after having joined Roth&#x27;s band, Vai designed the JEM guitar, a unique instrument that incorporated a series of groundbreaking designs that have since become staples in feature throughout the guitar industry, such as the inclusion of 24 frets on a guitar with humbuckers, single-coil middle pickup and a locking tremolo system. Vai began working with Ibanez in 1986 to develop the guitar, and the first production Ibanez JEM 777 guitars were released in 1987.

===1990s===
From 1985 to 1990, Vai recorded &quot;Passion and Warfare&quot; at his home studio, his second studio solo album. After leaving Roth&#x27;s band in 1989, Vai bought out of his Capitol Records contract and signed on with Relativity Records for the release of &quot;Passion and Warfare&quot;, which was completed shortly after he began recording the guitar parts for Whitesnake&#x27;s &quot;Slip of the Tongue&quot; album, where he replaced the injured Adrian Vandenberg.

Upon its release in November 1989, &quot;Slip of the Tongue&quot; sold over three million copies worldwide, reaching number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 while Vai joined the band on their thirteen-month world tour.

In May 1990, Vai released &quot;Passion and Warfare&quot; through Relativity Records, and following its release, the album had reached number 18 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling over a million and a half copies worldwide. &quot;Passion and Warfare&quot; won Vai a number of awards such as &quot;Guitar World&quot; and &quot;Guitar Player&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Best Album&quot; and &quot;Best Rock Guitarist&quot; awards. &quot;Passion and Warfare&quot; has been cited as one of the most pertinent instrumental albums released.

1990 also saw the release of the Ibanez Universe seven-string guitar co-designed by Vai in conjunction with Ibanez. Vai left Whitesnake in 1990 to pursue his own musical avenues and formed a band that included Devin Townsend on vocals, T. M. Stevens on bass, and Terry Bozzio on drums. The group released &quot;Sex &amp; Religion&quot; on July 23, 1993, that was described as visceral in nature, combining a compositional and progressive metal rhythm section with Devin Townsend&#x27;s vocal arrangements. After the following tour in support of the album, the group disbanded. Vai began working with Ozzy Osbourne in 1994, with whom he wrote and recorded the &quot;Ozzmosis&quot; album. Due to conflicts, the album was re-written and recorded with Zakk Wylde on guitar. In 1994, Vai won a Grammy award for his performance of &quot;Sofa&quot;, from &quot;Zappa&#x27;s Universe&quot;.

While recording his fourth studio album &quot;Fire Garden&quot;, Vai took time to record and release the stripped down EP &quot;Alien Love Secrets&quot;. A departure from the often highly compositional and heavily produced style of his previous projects, the seven-track EP was recorded in four weeks and released through Relativity/Epic Records on March 21, 1995. Vai cites this record as one of his favorites, saying &quot;The recording and release of &quot;Alien Love Secrets&quot; marked another turning point in my personal evolution. I was more concerned with making the record that I wanted to make, and not worry about what some others thought I should be doing.&quot;

On September 17, 1996, Vai released &quot;Fire Garden&quot;, 19-track double album, through Epic, with the first half being primarily instrumental while the second half featured Vai on vocals. After the release of &quot;Fire Garden&quot;, Vai joined his former teacher Joe Satriani, along with guitarist Eric Johnson, for the second installment of the ongoing G3 concert tours. On each G3 tour, three guitar-centric headlining acts are chosen to perform their own sets, and then collectively jam to fan favorite songs at the end of the show. &quot;G3: Live in Concert&quot;, a video of the 1996 tour was filmed in Columbus, Ohio and released on June 3, 1997.

In 1998, Vai independently released a performance footage DVD of &quot;Alien Love Secrets&quot;. Also in 1998, Vai started the Make a Noise Foundation with his then-manager Ruta Sepetys. The goal of the foundation was to provide funding for musical education to those otherwise unable to attain it. Today, Vai often auctions items in his possession with proceeds going to the foundation.

At the close of the decade, Vai provided guitar for Joe Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 1&quot;, released in 1999 and winner of the 2001 Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Album.

===2000s===

In December 2001, Vai recorded two performances at The Astoria in London, with his band The Breed (composed of former David Lee Roth bandmate Billy Sheehan, guitarist/pianist Tony MacAlpine, guitarist Dave Weiner, and drummer Virgil Donati). This live show was released independently in DVD format as &quot;Steve Vai: Live at the Astoria, London&quot; in 2003, and was Vai&#x27;s first of many successful live concert DVD projects. In 2004, Vai released twelve tracks from the DVD in an online only release.

2001 saw the limited release of &quot;The Secret Jewel Box&quot;, a conceptual ten-CD box set containing unique material from various eras of Vai&#x27;s career. Four compilation albums (&quot;The Elusive Light and Sound Vol. 1&quot;; &quot;Mystery Tracks – Archives Vol. 3&quot;; &quot;Various Artists – Archives Vol. 4&quot;; and &quot;&quot;) included as part of the box set, were released to the public both in 2001 and the years following. Also in 2001, Vai&#x27;s record label Favored Nations released &quot;No Substitutions: Live in Osaka&quot;. The release, which Vai himself produced and engineered, won him his second Grammy award for Best Pop Instrumental Album in February 2002.
While most widely recognized for his stature as a rock guitar player, Vai is also a musical composer fluent in the composition and arranging of orchestral music. In May 2004, Vai premiered &quot;The Aching Hunger&quot;, a project commissioned by the Netherlands Programme Service and performed with the Netherlands&#x27; Metropole Orchestra. &quot;The Aching Hunger&quot; performances consisted of two parts: the first showcasing Vai&#x27;s original contemporary orchestral compositions, and the second consisting of Vai (on guitar) playing newly arranged material from his catalog with the orchestra. This project yielded both the &quot;Visual Sound Theories&quot; DVD and the &quot;Sound Theories Vol. I &amp; II&quot; album, which were recorded in 2005 during multiple &quot;Aching Hunger&quot; performances and released in June 2007. While &quot;The Aching Hunger&quot; and its following releases started Vai&#x27;s public career as an orchestral composer, Vai had been composing since he began a music theory class (taught by Bill Westcott) in high school. While reflecting on his time with Westcott, Vai said &quot;He taught me how to write, compose and appreciate music. There was no greater musical influence in my life.&quot;

In 2005, Vai released &quot;Real Illusions: Reflections&quot;, the first installment in an ongoing three-part trilogy concept album. Each of the three installments to the series contain material (songs, lyrics, and both spoken and written narration) with particular relationships to the storyline, purposefully left out of order. Upon the release of the third installment, Vai intends to complete a fourth album of material, which will then be released with the previous three installments and completed storyline in order. In speaking of the storyline, Vai says &quot;It&#x27;s a human interest story, about the human condition. ... It&#x27;s a story about this man who has a traumatic experience in his life, and it drives him insane. We see the story through his eyes. It also involves the town he lives in and this stranger that enters the town who&#x27;s like a shaman; he builds this giant edifice, like a reflecting pond, and when people come to it they see aspects of their personalities and identities and discover things about themselves. There&#x27;s some comedy involved, too, but it&#x27;s pretty esoteric. It&#x27;s about a lot of lofty principles, so it&#x27;s not a bad idea to dish this all out slowly.&quot; The installments to the series will be released over periods of time, with the second, &quot;The Story of Light&quot;, having been released in 2012.

In 2006, Vai joined the Zappa Plays Zappa tour as a special guest, alongside additional Zappa band alumni Terry Bozzio and Napoleon Murphy Brock. In 2008, for his performance of &quot;Peaches en Regalia&quot; from the Zappa Plays Zappa tour, Vai won his third Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. Having always enjoyed the aspect of teaching and sharing his experiences in life and in the music business, Vai began a series of &quot;Alien Guitar Secrets&quot; masterclasses in 2006- a touring masterclass in which Vai holds open forum discussion about his own experiences in the music industry, explains the key principles to understanding success, plays to backing tracks (often inviting class attendees to jam with him), answers questions, articulates key points of guitar technique, and more importantly goes beyond the technique and into the more profound esoteric principles at play (see Notable contributions for more on this).

In support of &quot;Sound Theories Vol. I &amp; II&quot; and &quot;Visual Sound Theories&quot;, Vai put together a new band for a five-month world tour of the United States, Europe, South America, and Australia. While evaluating unique options for the band (which included ideas for a horn section or percussion section), Vai began auditioning violin players to complement the new lineup. This new band, known as the String Theories band, featured previous The Breed members Jeremy Colson (drums) and Dave Weiner (guitar and sitar), along with new members Bryan Beller (bass), Alex DePue (violin), and Ann Marie Calhoun (violin). During a month of twelve- to fifteen-hour a day rehearsals, Vai and the band perfected the performance (which consisted of pieces from Vai&#x27;s catalog, arranged by Vai to include the two violins). The tour began in June 2007 and ended in December the same year.

Midway through the String Theories tour in 2007, Vai recorded a performance at the State Theatre in Minneapolis, which yielded the acclaimed 2009 live concert DVD and Blu-ray release of &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;. Certified gold in the United States and Canada, &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; showcased the diverse musical range of the String Theories band, with pieces such as the visceral Grammy-nominated &quot;Now We Run&quot;, to the dynamic ballad &quot;Angel Food&quot;.

2007 also marked the 20th anniversary of the production of the Ibanez JEM guitar, a milestone which was commemorated with the 20th anniversary JEM model. Made of an acrylic body with three-dimensional &quot;swirl painted&quot; interior, this guitar can be seen in the beginning of the &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; DVD. In 2008, Vai announced the release of his signature Ibanez Jemini distortion pedal, a twin distortion pedal with both a custom overdrive and lead distortion section.

===2010s===

2010 marked the twentieth anniversary of the production of the Ibanez Universe guitar, which was commemorated with a twentieth anniversary Universe model. A reissue of the early 1990s Universe 77 MC (multi-color swirl), the model included a new five-piece maple/bubinga Universe neck and original swirl-paint job by Darren Johansen (the painter of the original Universe 77 MC guitars).

In February 2010, Vai announced the introduction of &quot;VaiTunes&quot;, a platform used to release digital-only singles via iTunes and other digital media outlets. In April, Vai performed with Mary J. Blige, Orianthi, Randy Jackson, and Travis Barker for a rendition of the Led Zeppelin classic &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, on the hit television show &quot;American Idol&quot;.

October 2010 saw more movement from Vai as a composer, with the premiere of two original symphonies at the Steve Vai Festival in Groningen, the Netherlands, and performed by the North Netherlands Orchestra. Shortly after the festival, Vai embarked on the Experience Hendrix tour (along with Eric Johnson, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Susan Tedeschi, Billy Cox, Vernon Reid, Robert Randolph, Jonny Lang, Brad Whitford, and others) for a nationwide tour of the United States.

In March 2011, Vai (in conjunction with the online education division of Berklee College of Music) set a Guinness World Record for the world&#x27;s largest online guitar lesson. The lesson was held as a promotion for Berklee&#x27;s online &quot;Steve Vai Guitar Techniques&quot; course, which Vai helped to construct. In April 2011, Vai (along with music and technology entrepreneur Andy Alt) announced the launch of GuitarTV, an online streaming website dedicated to bringing free guitar-related content to the community of guitar players around the world.

Vai&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;The Story of Light&quot;, was released in August 2012 as the second installment in the &quot;Real Illusions&quot; concept album trilogy. &quot;The Story of Light&quot; tour, which began on the month of the album&#x27;s release, spanned 254 engagements in 52 countries, ending in September 2014. This tour yielded the 2015 release of Vai&#x27;s fourth live DVD project &quot;Stillness in Motion&quot;, filmed in October 2012 during his &quot;Story of Light&quot; tour at the Club Nokia in Los Angeles. Released on April 7, the double-disc set contained a copy of the &quot;Stillness in Motion&quot; concert footage and a special bonus feature disc called &quot;The Space Between the Notes&quot;. The latter is a complete chronological timeline of the &quot;Story of Light&quot; tour, with a video or picture representation of each show of all of the 254 engagements attended.

2014 saw the announcement of a new, intensive guitar camp called the &quot;Vai Academy&quot;, which was an evolution of the Alien Guitar Secrets masterclass. Each year the camp is held, Vai creates a syllabus with a particular theme and invites special guests to help him teach it. During the day, Vai and the special guests (some of whom have been Guthrie Govan, Jeff Baxter, Vernon Reid, Eric Johnson, Sonny Landreth, and others) hold classes in which they add their insight and perspective to the theme. Each evening, Vai and the special guests jam with the campers. The themes have included 2014&#x27;s Vai Academy- Song Evolution Camp, and 2015&#x27;s Vai Academy: All About the Guitar.

Vai has announced an upcoming 2016 release commemorating the 25th anniversary of &quot;Passion and Warfare&quot;. This release contains remastered songs from the album, as well as the inclusion of a new album of material written from the time between the recording of &quot;Passion and Warfare&quot; and his first solo album &quot;Flex-Able&quot;. After the release, Vai held a world tour in which he played the entire &quot;Passion and Warfare&quot; album, along with material from the new release. The tour would continue during the first half of 2017.

In 2014, Steve Vai with Roman Miroshnichenko&#x27;s rock-band and the 80-piece Russian Philharmonic performed in Russia. Next year, double disc DVD “Stillness in Motion: Vai Live in L.A.Stillness In Motion&quot; was released with a bonus disc premiering “The Space Between the Notes&quot;, a revelatory video diary consisting of more than three and a half hours of footage, lensed around the world on-stage, off-stage and behind-the-scenes, rehearsal and the show moments of Steve&#x27;s joint performance with Roman Miroshnichenko and orchestra during Vai’s &quot;Story of Light&quot; World Tour.

In 2016, Vai played an uncredited guitar solo on the track &quot;Go!,&quot; from the album &quot;Junk&quot; by French electronic band M83. In April and May of the same year, Vai took part in the Generation Axe tour, alongside Tosin Abasi, Nuno Bettencourt, Yngwie Malmsteen, and Zakk Wylde. Starting in June, Vai embarked on the &quot;Passion and Warfare&quot; 25th Anniversary World Tour, where he played the album in its entirety for the first time.

Vai is a featured artist on the track &quot;Do You Feel Love&quot; from Jacob Collier&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;Djesse Vol. 2&quot;.

===2020–present===
On December 1, 2021, Steve Vai announced the release of his tenth studio album, entitled &quot;Inviolate&quot;, alongside its lead single &quot;Little Pretty&quot;. The album was released on January 28, 2022. Upon release, it debuted at No. 1 on the Current Hard Rock Albums chart (his first No. 1 album), No. 8 on Top Hard Rock Albums, and No. 40 on Top Album Sales. To support the album, Vai embarked upon a 54-date American tour of the same name. In 2021, Vai was also featured on a track called &quot;Lost Children of the Universe&quot; on the latest album by Star One, a project led by Arjen Anthony Lucassen. 

In 2022, Vai was featured on Polyphia&#x27;s track &quot;Ego Death&quot;. 

On November 10, 2022, Vai announced his latest album, &quot;Vai/Gash&quot;, alongside its lead single &quot;In The Wind&quot;. Vai and singer Johnny &quot;Gash&quot; Sombrotto had recorded the album in 1991, but it remained unpublished after Sombrotto&#x27;s death in a motorcycle accident on September 7, 1998. Vai and Sombrotto had bonded over a shared love of motorcycles. The album cover features a photo of Sombretto, showing the extensive burn scars he sustained in a 1977 motorcycle crash. The album released on January 27, 2023.

Having previously covered her composition, &quot;Mullach a tSí&quot; for &quot;The Story of Light&quot; in 2012 and performing together in Vicar Street in Dublin, Vai collaborated with Pádraigín Ní Uallacháin for the title track of her 2023 album, &quot;Seven Daughters of the Sea&quot;.

In early 2024, Vai, Satriani, and Eric Johnson embarked on a limited-run &quot;Reunion&quot; tour of the original G3 lineup. Subsequently, Vai and Satriani continued touring as a double-bill. After more than 50 years of professional and personal friendship, the pair wrote and recorded their first single &quot;The Sea Of Emotion, Pt.1&quot;, released on March 29, 2024.

In September 2024, Vai joined Adrian Belew, Tony Levin and Tool drummer Danny Carey on a three-month tour of North America called &quot;Beat&quot;. A reinterpretation of the 1980s King Crimson albums &quot;Discipline&quot;, &quot;Beat&quot; and &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot;.

In 2025, Vai announced a European tour with Joe Satriani, scheduled for the summer. In an interview, he discussed preparations for the tour, as well as his latest projects. 

==Media appearances==
===&quot;Steve Vai – His First 30 Years: The Documentary&quot;===
In 2022, a 77 minutes long documentary was released to honor his first 30 years. This is the first documentary covering Vai&#x27;s life from 1960 to 1990. It was co-written by Steve Vai. The video covers his life growing up, attending Berklee College of Music, playing with several artists like Frank Zappa, Alcatrazz, the David Lee Roth band, and Whitesnake, the recording of both his solo albums Flex-Able and Passion and Warfare, plus Vai&#x27;s role in the movie &quot;Crossroads&quot;, and how he helped create the Ibanez JEM guitar.

===Video games===
&quot;Juice&quot;, from &quot;Alien Love Secrets&quot;, was featured on the 1996 video game &quot;Formula One&quot; for the PlayStation. Vai&#x27;s guitar work also appeared in the 2002 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;. David Lee Roth&#x27;s &quot;Yankee Rose&quot; was featured on &quot;Vice City&quot;&#x27;s soundtrack, as well as &quot;God Blessed Video&quot; by Alcatrazz, as part of the Lazlow-led, 1980s rock/metal radio station &quot;V-Rock.&quot; In 2004, Vai was featured on the soundtrack to the Xbox video game &quot;Halo 2&quot;, performing a heavy rock guitar rendition of the &quot;Halo theme&quot;, known as &quot;Halo Theme (MJOLNIR Mix)&quot;. He also performed on the track &quot;Never Surrender&quot;. He later featured in the second volume of the soundtrack, where he performed on the track &quot;Reclaimer&quot;. Vai returned to re-record his &quot;Halo&quot; work for the &quot;&quot;, which was released in 2014 and included as part of the anniversary edition of &quot;Halo 2&quot;. In an interview shot during the development of &quot;Halo 2 Anniversary&quot;, Vai reveals that his part in the &quot;MJOLNIR Mix&quot; was a last-minute inclusion in the song.

In 2008, Vai&#x27;s song &quot;For the Love of God&quot; and &quot;Halo Theme (MJOLNIR Mix)&quot; were featured as downloadable tracks for the game &quot;Guitar Hero 3&quot;. A live version of &quot;For the Love of God&quot; was also available on the Rock Band Network service, as well as the song &quot;Get the Hell Out of Here&quot; from his 2002 compilation album &quot;The Elusive Light and Sound Vol. 1&quot; on March 4, 2010. &quot;The Attitude Song&quot; and a live version of &quot;The Crying Machine&quot; were both also added to the Rock Band Network. A re-recording of &quot;Speeding&quot; is featured in the 2010 video game &quot;Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock&quot; for Xbox 360, Wii and PlayStation 3.

===Films===
In 1986, Vai was cast in director Walter Hill&#x27;s film &quot;Crossroads&quot; as the Devil&#x27;s guitar player &quot;Jack Butler.&quot; In the &quot;cutting heads&quot; scene between Vai&#x27;s Jack Butler and Ralph Macchio&#x27;s Eugene &quot;Lightning&quot; Martone, Vai wrote and performed all guitar parts with the exception of the slide guitar (which was performed by Ry Cooder). The main body of the final piece performed in the duel scene (the fast-paced neoclassical track &quot;Eugene&#x27;s Trick Bag&quot;) was based heavily on Niccolò Paganini&#x27;s Capriccio number 5. The &quot;Crossroads&quot; duel appeared on the 2002 album &quot;The Elusive Light and Sound Vol. 1&quot;.

In 1987, Vai performed &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; in the film &quot;Dudes&quot;. In 1991, Vai performed on the film &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot;, as well as on 1992&#x27;s &quot;Encino Man&quot;, &quot;PCU&quot; (1994), and John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; (where he played on the tracks &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; and &quot;Ghost Poppin&#x27;&quot;).

In 2010, Vai&#x27;s record label Favored Nations produced and released the award-winning original motion picture &quot;Crazy&quot;. An independent film, &quot;Crazy&quot; was inspired by the life and music of the guitarist Hank Garland.

==Style and influence==
At the age of thirteen, after having purchased his first guitar and begun taking his first lessons from fellow New York native Joe Satriani, Vai became obsessed with the discipline of practice. Vai&#x27;s practice routine, consisting of a rigid and structured regimen of ten-to-fifteen hour-a-day practice schedules, became the basis of his work ethic for the rest of his career. During his employment by Frank Zappa, Vai transcribed and played very rhythmically complex music, believing that if started slow and perfected, any piece of music could be played.

Vai&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Flex-Able&quot;, began his career as a solo artist in 1984. During the period of time that the album was recorded, Vai was heavily influenced by his previous tenure in Frank Zappa&#x27;s band. Originally not intended for release, &quot;Flex-Able&quot; expressed a certain creative &quot;quirky&quot; and &quot;angular&quot; freedom in the eclectic nature of Vai&#x27;s writing style. &quot;Passion and Warfare&quot;, Vai&#x27;s second solo album, expressed a more mature and evolved &quot;signature&quot; style but retained a certain freedom of unfettered inspiration that would continue to influence Vai&#x27;s future releases. In speaking of his inspiration, Vai has said that it comes to him in many forms (even from the flowers pushed up against a fence outside of his studio, which he transcribed and used in the ninth track &quot;Weeping China Doll&quot;, from &quot;The Story of Light&quot;. While expressing that he is not continuously inspired, Vai uses a concept he calls &quot;musical meditation&quot; to enter a state of consciousness that he calls &quot;The Ultra Zone&quot;. When inside this un-critical frame of mind, Vai is able to achieve inspiration in the form of musical ideas (often in forms of melody or rhythm). For these moments of inspiration, Vai created what he calls the &quot;Infinity Shelf&quot;, a drive of thousands of snippets of song ideas that he has collected over his entire career. These esoteric principles are taught by Vai during his Alien Guitar Secrets masterclasses, among a host of other information.

Vai&#x27;s playing style utilizes specialized guitar techniques (such as two-handed tapping, alternate picking, legato, hybrid picking, sweep picking, whammy bar acrobatics, and circular vibrato) in his music, as well as a wide range of recording techniques.

Vai cites artists such as Jimmy Page, Brian May, Ritchie Blackmore, Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix, as well as jazz fusion guitarists Allan Holdsworth and Al Di Meola as some of his major influences.

==Notable contributions==
===Work with Frank Zappa===
As a transcriptionist for Frank Zappa, Vai transcribed some of Zappa&#x27;s most rhythmically complex music, using a range of conceptualizations for the notation of rhythmic music. Vai says &quot;While transcribing the material, I was often confronted with situations that led me to reach into the intuitional areas of my imagination to come up with various notational devices and constructions that I had never seen before. I soon discovered that many contemporary composers were then (and are still) using these notations&quot;. These concepts can be seen throughout the &quot;Frank Zappa Guitar Book&quot;, which were composed of Vai&#x27;s guitar and drum transcriptions from various Zappa albums. Vai toured with Zappa from 1980 to 1983, performing selections of this technically demanding music with Zappa&#x27;s band at the time.

===JEM, PIA, and Universe guitars===
Vai designed the Ibanez JEM guitar, a unique instrument that incorporated a series of groundbreaking designs that have since become staples in feature throughout the guitar industry, in 1985. In speaking of the development of the guitar, Vai says, &quot;Stratocasters had whammy bars—which were fantastic—but they were very limited, were always going out of tune, and had single-coil pickups. Les Pauls had humbuckers—which gave you that real scream in the bridge position—but no whammy bar, and I didn&#x27;t like the way they sat. Neither guitar had twenty-four frets. So I went to a guitar shop in Hollywood, where I had these elements implemented into a guitar (what would have been considered a Superstrat at the time). The guitar was designed with a sharper body shape, a large cutaway around the neck, twenty-four frets, a fully floating tremolo system, a specially wired five-way pickup selector switch, and an output jack angled on the side of the body (so that when you step on the cable, it doesn&#x27;t pull out of your guitar). I knew of course that these features would eventually be taken and used in other guitars, so I did something completely preposterous: I said, &#x27;Put a handle in it!&#x27; That way, during videos and photoshoots I could swing the guitar around.&quot;

Vai had several custom prototypes of these guitars built (which were used on the &quot;Eat &#x27;Em and Smile&quot; tour) by Joe &quot;Jem&quot; Despagni, a custom guitar luthier and friend of Vai&#x27;s. Due to Vai&#x27;s highly coveted position in Roth&#x27;s band, many guitar companies were eager to propose endorsement opportunities. In response to these offers, Vai sent out the specifications of the JEM guitar, detailing that the company that returned the best guitar would be given the endorsement. Dissatisfied with the guitars returned and unwilling to compromise, Vai held out on a guitar endorsement until Ibanez approached him, sending him an instrument superior to that of the other companies and willing to follow his instructions. After the pre-production prototypes were perfected, the first production Ibanez JEM 777 guitars were unveiled at the NAMM Show in 1987. Since its original 1987 release, the JEM has become one of the longest-running and most successful signature series guitars in history, with its sister guitar, the Ibanez RG, being the second highest-selling guitar (behind the Fender Stratocaster) on the market.

Another design by Vai was the Ibanez Universe, the first production seven-string guitar, which was released in 1989. The Universe incorporated many of the aspects that made the JEM a unique instrument (2 octave fretboard, full floating tremolo, humbucker/single coil/humbucker pickup configuration, angled output jack and deeper body cutaways), with an added low &#x27;B&#x27; string, allowing for new low-range sonic possibilities. Used by Vai on much of &quot;Passion and Warfare&quot; and all of Whitesnake&#x27;s &quot;Slip of the Tongue&quot;, the Universe was a large stepping stone for the burgeoning Nu-metal genre (with bands such as Korn, Limp Bizkit, Fear Factory and Meshuggah having adopted the instrument and incorporating it into their signature sound).

On April 4 of 2020 the Ibanez PIA was introduced, which Vai says is the modernisation and maturing of his original JEM. The PIA model (named after his wife Pia Maiocco), features an alder body and a 5-piece maple / walnut neck with 24 frets, rosewood fretboard with the usual floral inlays. The neck is styled in the classic Ibanez wizard III neck - 430mmR neck radius. The primary way model differs from the JEM for its softer body curves and a Petal Grip handle replacing the original Monkey Grip cutout. It also sports DiMarzio UtoPIA pickups in an HSH configuration, gold hardware and a Prestige locking vibrato unit.

===Alien Guitar Secrets masterclasses===
Having always enjoyed the aspect of teaching and sharing his experiences in life and in the music business, Vai began a series of &quot;Alien Guitar Secrets&quot; masterclasses in 2006- a touring masterclass in which Vai holds open forum discussion about his own experiences in the music industry, explains the key principles to understanding success, plays to backing tracks (often inviting class attendees to jam with him), answers questions, articulates key points of guitar technique, and more importantly goes beyond the technique and into the more profound esoteric principles at play. Vai details certain concepts he has discovered that have helped him in all areas of his life and career, both in playing guitar/ musically as well as spiritually. Vai accessibly shares these concepts with masterclass participants using examples from his own experiences, delving into the ongoing process of identifying the self-critical nature of one&#x27;s own thoughts. Vai explains the techniques and exercises he uses to circumnavigate one&#x27;s own insecurities and thoughts of self-doubt, and encourages masterclass participants to use these tools in their own lives. Often embarking on masterclass tours through Europe, South America, and Russia, Vai considers this ongoing series of classes as one of his most important contributions.

===Eventide H3000 Ultra-Harmonizer===
Guitar effects manufacturer Eventide approached Vai in the mid-1980s to contribute unique ideas for their H3000 effects unit. Vai suggested many specific concepts, such as diatonic pitch change and multi-voice harmony, that were used in the unit and have since become standard algorithms in guitar effects processors.

===DiMarzio pickups===
In 1993, Vai&#x27;s signature series high-output &quot;Evolution&quot; humbucker pickup set was released by DiMarzio. The Evolution pickups use DiMarzio&#x27;s patented &quot;Dual-Resonance&quot; design. The &quot;EVO 2&quot; humbucker, a lower output model, was released in 2004.

===Carvin Legacy amplifier===
In 1997, Vai had begun working with the Carvin Corporation to design a signature series of Legacy amplifiers, which were used on his 1999 Epic Records release &quot;The Ultra Zone&quot;. The original Legacy I model was released in 1999, with the most recent Legacy III being released in 2012.

===Touring===
In the 1990s, Vai began touring in European and Asian countries (such as Russia and China) as well as South America, often having been the first American rock act in history to have performed in these areas. In 2014, Vai performed on the Chinese television station BTV&#x27;s &quot;Spring Festival Global Gala,&quot; a program broadcast to over two billion viewers. With the broadcasting of this event on January 26, 2014, Vai became the first rock artist ever broadcast on a Chinese television program.

==Equipment==
Vai&#x27;s personal studio, &quot;The Harmony Hut&quot;, is a large edifice located in his backyard equipped with a full control room and performance room. The studio, built in 2011, is where Vai currently produces, records, and mixes his new material.
Vai has two main signature series Ibanez JEM six-string guitars (dubbed &quot;EVO&quot; and &quot;FLO III&quot;) that he uses live and in the studio. &quot;EVO&quot;, a prototype Ibanez JEM 7VWH, was received in 1993 while developing Vai&#x27;s signature DiMarzio Evolution pickups (hence the name of the guitar), and &quot;FLO III&quot; is a basswood Ibanez Los Angeles Custom Shop JEM 7VWH equipped with a Fernandes Sustainer system. The bridge pickup of FLO III used to be a DiMarzio PAF Pro pickup, but it has been exchanged with a DiMarzio Evolution in recent years. Since early 2022, Vai has been frequently using the 2nd prototype of the Onyx Black Ibanez PIA along with &quot;EVO&quot; and &quot;FLO III&quot;, which he nicknamed &quot;ONYX&quot;. &quot;ONYX&quot; has a lightly scalloped neck and used to be outfitted with a Sustaniac system which was recently changed with a Fernandes sustainer system.

His other favourite guitars include &quot;BO&quot;, a JEM77BRMR prototype, also equipped with Fernandes Sustainer system and blue LED dot inlays, which was stolen in 2015, but later recovered; the original &quot;FLO&quot; guitar, a transformed original 77FP JEM to 7VWH specifications, also equipped with Fernandes Sustainer System and EVO 2 bridge pickup; &quot;Bruno&quot; aka &quot;For the Love of God&quot; Ibanez Universe UV77MC seven-string guitar with burnt finish and mirror pickguard (this guitar was used in the &quot;For the Love of God&quot; music video); &quot;NILE&quot;, 1st Onyx Black PIA prototype used heavily on &quot;Inviolate&quot; album; and &quot;XAVIA&quot;, a customised 2007 JEM 7VWH with heavily scalloped neck and Fernandes Sustainer system usually used as a backup for or in place of &quot;FLO III&quot;. Vai uses his signature Carvin Legacy amplifier, as well as Morley Pedals, with whom he has his signature Bad Horsie and Bad Horsie II wah pedals, and Little Alligator volume pedal. Vai uses the Ibanez Jemini distortion pedal, a signature twin distortion pedal with separate overdrive and distortion sections.

Before his endorsement with Ibanez, Vai was endorsed by Charvel guitars, most notably using a green and black San Dimas model. In addition, over the course of his career, Vai has used guitars made by various other companies, including Jackson, Fender, and Gavtone.

Vai&#x27;s preferred string gauge has usually been 9-42 Ernie Ball Strings.

===Guitar rig and signal flow===
Vai&#x27;s 2016 live guitar rig utilizes his signature Carvin Legacy amplifier (now on its third version), the Fractal Audio Axe-Fx II XL, and an MFC-101 foot controller.

Depending on the location and venue, Vai will use either his Legacy I or Legacy III heads, and Carvin Legacy 4x12 speaker cabinets loaded with Celestion Vintage 30 speakers. Vai uses EL-34 tubes by Groove Tubes in his Legacy amps.

Vai uses the Fractal Audio Axe-Fx II XL as the only modulation effects unit in his guitar rig. Generally for live use he utilizes the unit for stereo effects such as delay, chorus, and phase, with a separate preset for the parameters of each different song in his setlist. The Axe-Fx MFC-101 foot controller is set up in conjunction with the unit, allowing Vai to switch effects on and off in a fashion reminiscent to that of standard stompboxes.

Vai&#x27;s pedalboard consists of a wah-wah pedal (either his Morley Bad Horsie signature pedal, or a Dunlop Cry Baby 95q), an Ibanez Jemini twin distortion pedal, and DigiTech Whammy DT pitch shifting pedal. The centerpiece of the pedalboard is the Axe-Fx MFC-101 foot controller for the Axe-Fx II XL, which, as previously mentioned, controls the effects in a manner similar to switching on and off stompboxes. There are two expression pedals used for the Axe-Fx, one to act as a volume pedal, and the other to control the harmonizer built into the Axe-Fx unit.

The signal from the guitar (usually one of the main guitars &quot;EVO&quot;, &quot;FLO III&quot; or more recently, &quot;ONYX&quot;) goes into either the Morley Bad Horsie or Dunlop 95q wah pedal. From there, it goes directly into the Ibanez Jemini twin distortion pedal, and then to the Digitech Whammy DT. From the output of the Whammy, the signal heads into the input of the Carvin Legacy amplifier head. Out of the effects loop of the Legacy, the signal heads directly into the Axe-Fx II XL, where it is split into stereo and the effects are applied (and controlled via the MFC-101 foot controller). Out of the output of the Axe-Fx, one signal is sent back to the original Legacy head return, and a second is sent to a second Carvin Legacy head return, bypassing the preamp stage completely and acting as a slave power amp. Vai utilizes his stereo setup on effects like delay, where he sets up two separate delay times (one slower and one faster) and allows them to alternate back and forth. The signal is then sent from the amp to the 4x12 Carvin Legacy speaker cabinets loaded with Celestion Vintage 30 speakers. Vai uses AKG microphones to mic his amps, and uses a separate Carvin power amp to power a direct guitar monitor cabinet instead of relying on the PA.

Detailed gear diagrams of both Vai&#x27;s 1999 and 2007 guitar rigs are well-documented.

==Personal life==

Since the late 1990s, Vai has resided in Encino, Los Angeles with his family. Vai is married to Pia Maiocco, former bassist of the band Vixen (who can be seen in the 1984 film &quot;Hardbodies&quot;), with whom he has two children, Julian and Fire Vai. Vai is also a vegetarian and a beekeeper, regularly tending to the beehives kept on his Encino property.

<text>Benjamin Clarence &quot;Bull Moose&quot; Jackson (April 22, 1919 – July 31, 1989) was an American blues and rhythm-and-blues singer and saxophonist, who was most successful in the late 1940s. He is considered a performer of dirty blues because of the suggestive nature of some of his songs, such as &quot;I Want a Bowlegged Woman&quot; and &quot;Big Ten Inch Record&quot;.

==Career==
Jackson was born Benjamin Joseph Jackson in Cleveland, Ohio. He played violin as a child but quickly became drawn to the saxophone and started his first band, the Harlem Hotshots, while he was still in high school. In 1943, he was recruited as a saxophonist by the bandleader Lucky Millinder, and the musicians in Millinder&#x27;s band gave him the nickname &quot;Bull Moose&quot; for his appearance. He began singing when he was required to stand in for Wynonie Harris at a show in Lubbock, Texas.

Millinder encouraged Jackson to sign a solo contract with Syd Nathan of King Records to play rhythm and blues. The first recording in his own right was &quot;I Know Who Threw the Whiskey&quot;, in 1946, an answer song to Millinder&#x27;s &quot;Who Threw the Whiskey in the Well&quot;. The following year, his recording of &quot;I Love You, Yes I Do&quot; reputedly became the first R&amp;B single to sell a million copies, holding the number 1 spot on the R&amp;B chart for three weeks and crossing over to the pop chart, where it reached number 24.

He formed his own group, the Buffalo Bearcats, and over the next five years recorded in a wide variety of musical styles, including both romantic crooning and bawdy jump blues. His big hits in 1948 included the double-sided hit &quot;All My Love Belongs to You&quot; / &quot;I Want a Bowlegged Woman&quot;, and his biggest R&amp;B chart hit, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Go on Without You&quot;, which stayed at number 1 on the R&amp;B chart for eight weeks. He also made an appearance in the 1948 film &quot;Boarding House Blues&quot;, with Millinder.

In 1949, Jackson covered &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Haul Off and Love Me&quot;, a song that been successful for Wayne Raney and also for several country-and-western performers.
In May 1951 he recorded &quot;Wonder When My Baby&#x27;s Coming Home&quot; with his Bearcats.

Jackson toured throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s. Around 1951, his band included the bebop composer and arranger Tadd Dameron on piano and Benny Golson, another jazz musician, on saxophone.

Some of Jackson&#x27;s later risqué material, including &quot;Big Ten Inch Record&quot; and &quot;Nosey Joe&quot; (written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller), caused a sensation during live performances but were too suggestive for the radio, and few of the records were sold. However, his band faithfully played &quot;Big Ten Inch Record&quot; at every show.

By the mid-1950s, Jackson was tired of touring and retired from music to work for a catering firm in Washington, D.C., although he occasionally still performed at private parties. In 1961, he re-recorded &quot;I Love You, Yes I Do&quot; with modern high-fidelity equipment and had a minor hit.

Twenty years later, the Flashcats, a blues band that performed in western Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, regularly included &quot;Big Ten Inch Record&quot; in their performances. A local DJ reputedly told the Flashcats that he knew Bull Moose Jackson, and the band&#x27;s frontman, Carl Grefensette, found him catering at Howard University. Grefensette convinced Jackson to perform with them, and they quickly became a sensation in western Pennsylvania. Jackson then made the Flashcats his backing band and began a revival of his career. He also recorded a comeback album, &quot;Moosemania!&quot; (1985).

During the 1980s, Jackson, then in his 60s, had an extremely successful run performing in the United States and internationally. However, he fell ill with lung cancer in 1987 and retired from the touring circuit in the spring of 1988. An old girlfriend of his came back to care for him during his final illness. He died in Cleveland on July 31, 1989.

<text>Ansgar Elde (27 November 1933 – 4 December 2000) was a Swedish artist famous for his work in ceramics.

Elde was a member of the Situationist International (SI). On March 15, 1962, Elde was excluded from the SI along with Jørgen Nash. Both had been on the central committee and were accused of conspiring with certain art collectors. In fact, they had defended Ervin Eisch, Lothar Fischer, Dieter Kunzelmann, Renee Nele, Heimrad Prem, Gretel Stadler, Helmut Sturm and Hand-Peter Zimmer who had been excluded on February 10, 1962.

He went on, with Jørgen Nash and others, to work on the Second Situationist International.

Elde collaborated with Asger Jorn on the large ceramic work made in Albisola, Italy, transported to Aarhus, Denmark by train.

In 1964 in Chicago he received the Copley Foundation Award.

In the early nineties Heike Arndt met Ansgar and accepted his invitation to Savona, Italy, where she developed her work.

The highest know price for an item made by Elde at auction is 4,446 USD for &quot;Senza titolo&quot; that was sold by the Il Ponte Auction House, Via Pontaccio in 2018.

<doc id="262264" wikidata="Q217317" url="?curid=262264" title="Andrea Gabrieli">
<text>Andrea Gabrieli (1532/1533 – August 30, 1585) was an Italian composer and organist of the late Renaissance. The uncle of the somewhat more famous Giovanni Gabrieli, he was the first internationally renowned member of the Venetian School of composers, and was extremely influential in spreading the Venetian style in Italy as well as in Germany.

==Life==
Details on Gabrieli&#x27;s early life are uncertain. He was probably a native of Venice, most likely the parish of S. Geremia. He may have been a pupil of Adrian Willaert at St. Mark&#x27;s in Venice at an early age. There is some evidence that he spent time in Verona in the early 1550s, due to a connection with Vincenzo Ruffo, who worked there as &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; – Ruffo published one of Gabrieli&#x27;s madrigals in 1554, and Gabrieli also wrote some music for a Veronese academy. Gabrieli is known to have been organist in Cannaregio between 1555 and 1557, at which time he competed unsuccessfully for the post of organist at St. Mark&#x27;s.

In 1562 he went to Germany, where he visited Frankfurt am Main and Munich; while there he met and became friends with Orlande de Lassus, one of the most wide-ranging composers of the entire Renaissance, who wrote secular songs in French, Italian, and German, as well as abundant Latin sacred music. This musical relationship proved immensely fruitful for both composers: while Lassus certainly learned from the Venetian, Gabrieli took back to Venice numerous ideas he learned while visiting Lassus in Bavaria, and within a short time was composing in most of the current idioms, including one which Lassus entirely avoided: purely instrumental music.

In 1566 Gabrieli was chosen for the post of organist at St. Mark&#x27;s, one of the most prestigious musical posts in northern Italy; he retained this position for the rest of his life. Around this time he acquired, and maintained, a reputation as one of the finest current composers. Working in the unique acoustical space of St. Mark&#x27;s, he was able to develop his unique, grand ceremonial style, which was enormously influential in the development of the polychoral style and the concertato idiom, which partially defined the beginning of the Baroque era in music.

His duties at St. Mark&#x27;s clearly included composition, for he wrote a great deal of music for ceremonial affairs, some of considerable historical interest. He provided the music for the festivities accompanying the celebration of the victory over the Turks in the Battle of Lepanto (1571); he also composed music for the visit of several princes from Japan (1585).

Late in his career he also became famous as a teacher. Prominent among his students were his nephew Giovanni Gabrieli; the music theorist Lodovico Zacconi; Hans Leo Hassler, who carried the concertato style to Germany; and many others.

The date and circumstances of his death were not known until the 1980s, when the register containing his death date was found. Dated August 30, 1585, it includes the notation that he was &quot;about 52 years old&quot;; his approximate birth date has been inferred from this. His position at St. Mark&#x27;s was not filled until the end of 1586, and a large amount of his music was published posthumously in 1587.

==Works==
Gabrieli was a prolific and versatile composer, and wrote a large amount of music, including sacred and secular vocal music, music for mixed groups of voices and instruments, and purely instrumental music, much of it for the huge, resonant space of St. Mark&#x27;s. His works include over a hundred motets and madrigals, as well as a smaller number of instrumental works.

His early style is indebted to Cipriano de Rore, and his madrigals are representative of mid-century trends. Even in his earliest music, however, he had a liking for homophonic textures at climaxes, foreshadowing the grand style of his later years. After his meeting with Lassus in 1562, his style changed considerably, and the Netherlander became the strongest influence on him.

Once Gabrieli was working at St. Mark&#x27;s, he began to turn away from the Franco-Flemish contrapuntal style which had dominated the music of the 16th century, instead exploiting the sonorous grandeur of mixed instrumental and vocal groups playing antiphonally in the great basilica. His music of this time uses repetition of phrases with different combinations of voices at different pitch levels; although instrumentation is not &quot;specifically&quot; indicated, it can be inferred; he carefully contrasts texture and sonority to shape sections of music in a way which was unique, and which defined the Venetian style for the next generation.

Not everything Gabrieli wrote was for St. Mark&#x27;s, though. He provided the music for one of the earliest revivals of an ancient Greek drama in Italian translation: &quot;Oedipus tyrannus&quot;, by Sophocles, for which he wrote the music for the choruses, setting separate lines for different groupings of voices. It was produced at the inauguration of the Teatro Olimpico, Vicenza, 1585.

Evidently Andrea Gabrieli was reluctant to publish much of his own music, and his nephew Giovanni Gabrieli published much of it after his uncle&#x27;s death.

<text>Pirachai Saenkham (, born May 15, 1959), known professionally as Kaokor Galaxy, also written as Khaokor Galaxy (Thai: เขาค้อ แกแล็คซี่) is a Thai former professional boxer who competed from 1985 to 1989. He held the WBA bantamweight title twice between 1988 and 1989. Khaokor and his twin brother Khaosai Galaxy became the first twins to win a boxing world title.

==Personal life==
Khaokor Galaxy was born as &quot;Surote Saenkham&quot; (Thai: สุโรจน์ แสนคำ, nicknamed: Rote)to and raised in Ban Chaliang Lab, Tambon Na Pha, Mueang Phetchabun, Phetchabun, Thailand. Although he was born after Khaosai, he was still considered by the Thai as the older brother because of their ancient belief regarding twins.

Khaokor graduated at Phetchabun Technical College same as Khaosai. Khaokor and Khaosai always liked boxing and fighting since they were children. Their parents bought them their first Muay Thai gloves. Their parents eventually took them to meet their first Muay Thai trainers, Prakan Vornsiri and Mana Lhawpradit.

Khaokor was ring named as Denja Mueangsritep (Thai: เด่นจ๋า เมืองศรีเทพ) for a Muay Thai competition, which is related to Khaosai&#x27;s ring name, Dawden Mueangsritep (Thai: ดาวเด่น เมืองศรีเทพ). Both of them competed around Phetchabun and the nearby provinces. Khaokor started joining competitions before Khaosai and would use his twin brother&#x27;s name. Niwat Lhawsuwanwat (Thai: นิวัฒน์ เหล่าสุวรรณวัฒน์) would take them to Bangkok for a professional training program and later, joined many competitions in Bangkok.

==Professional career ==
Like his brother, he started his career in Muay Thai and would later switch to boxing. In fact, he had been fighting Muay Thai for many years before Khaosai. After becoming a star in Thailand, he followed a long-standing Thai custom of adopting an attention-getting ringname and thus he became known as Khaokor Galaxy () after Khaokor, a renowned natural tourist attraction at his birthplace. His transition to boxing came after he became a sparring partner and mentor to Khaosai. At that time, he had been out of Muay Thai for seven years and had no intention of going back to fighting, whether it was Muay Thai or boxing. However, Niwat Laosuwannawat, Khaosai&#x27;s manager and promoter, saw his potential and invited him to try boxing, hoping to make them the world&#x27;s first twin world champions. Khaokor Galaxy made his professional boxing début in 1985, winning his first seven fights before capturing the Thailand bantamweight title in July 1986. 

On 9 May 1988, he won against Wilfredo Vazquez to take the WBA bantamweight title. With this victory, the Galaxy brothers became the first twins to be world champions. Khaokor would also be the first Thai bantamweight champion.

After Khaokor and Khaosai won their titles, Tam Pai Doo, a variety TV show on Channel 9, organized an exhibition bout that pitted the twins against each other, the contest was produced at Rajadamnern Stadium, Bangkok. Khaosai beat Khaokor by points in three rounds.

Khaokor lost the title three months later in his first defense against Korean Sung-Kil Moon, when an accidental clash of heads caused a sixth-round stoppage with Khaokor behind on points. He bounced back with five straight wins to earn a rematch with Moon on 9 July 1989. Khaokor won the rematch easily, winning in all 12 rounds on two scorecards and 11 on the third scorecard. Once again though, Khaokor lost the title in his first defence three months later, against Luisito Espinosa. Surprisingly, he retired at that point with a record of 24 wins and 2 losses. The defeat to Espinosa was unexpected, but Khaokor was caught with a left hook, and about 20 seconds later just collapsed out of thin air. At that time, this matter was a huge sensation in society, it was called &quot;Rok-wubb&quot; (โรควูบ, &quot;fainting syndrome&quot;). There was a lot of discussion about it, some people thought that he was being attacked by black magic from his ex-girlfriend. After retirement, Khaokor revealed that it was because he had lost a lot of weight at that time, coupled with stress, that caused it to happen.

==Boxing style==
Even though they are twins, his fighting style was completely different from Khaosai. Kaokor was a boxer who uses a defensive style and watches his opponent&#x27;s moves, also technically known as boxing style, different from Khaosai who uses a fierce fighting, also known as fighting style. In terms of training and discipline, Kaokhor admitted that he was lazy to train, while Khaosai was more determined and diligent in training.

== Retirement ==
Two months after Khaokor lost his title, the twins had a fan meeting event in Phetchabun. While driving home, they had a car accident which was driven by Khaosai. Khaokor was sent to the ICU for 21 days while, Khaosai only suffered minor injuries and would later be back to professional boxing.

Khaokor decided to retire after his recovery from the car accident but still helped Khaosai in his trainings. When Khaosai decided to retire, Khaokor went back to look after his business full-time, a snooker club.

In his retirement, he got a film job as a main actor for a low-budget Thai movie titled &quot;My name is..Mahingsa&quot; (Thai: ข้าชื่อ..มหิงสา). He was also a boxing trainer for Siriporn Thaweesuk (Thai: ศิริพร ทวีสุข), the first female Thai professional boxing champion. Khaokor had many businesses such as a snooker club, selling car roof accessories, and a restaurant in Bangkok. He also used to work as a recreation attendant for the Phetchabun Government and also worked in a pawnshop.

He would later be broke after poor financial activities such as spending a lot of money with his ex-girlfriends. Although he got broke, he still got many opportunities in getting jobs and eventually settled in. Currently, Khaokor married Tak Jirapwan (Thai: แต๊ก จีรวรรณ) and have two sons, with four years age difference.

<doc id="262270" wikidata="Q7975302" url="?curid=262270" title="Wave drag">
<text>In aeronautics, wave drag is a component of the aerodynamic drag on aircraft wings and fuselage, propeller blade tips and projectiles moving at transonic and supersonic speeds, due to the presence of shock waves. Wave drag is independent of viscous effects, and tends to present itself as a sudden and dramatic increase in drag as the vehicle increases speed to the critical Mach number. It is the sudden and dramatic rise of wave drag that leads to the concept of a sound barrier.

== Overview ==

Wave drag is a component of pressure drag due to compressibility effects. It is caused by the formation of shock waves around a body. Shock waves create a considerable amount of drag, which can result in extreme drag on the body. Although shock waves are typically associated with supersonic flow, they can form at aircraft speeds on areas of the body where local airflow accelerates to supersonic speed. The effect is typically seen on aircraft at transonic speeds (about Mach 0.8), but it is possible to notice the problem at any speed over that of the critical Mach of that aircraft. It is so pronounced that, prior to 1947, it was thought that aircraft engines would not be powerful enough to overcome the enhanced drag, or that the forces would be so great that aircraft would be at risk of breaking up in midflight. It led to the concept of a &quot;sound barrier&quot;.

== Research ==

In 1947, studies into wave drag led to the development of &quot;perfect&quot; shapes to reduce wave drag as much as theoretically possible. For a fuselage the resulting shape was the Sears–Haack body, which suggested a perfect cross-sectional shape for any given internal volume. The von Kármán ogive was a similar shape for bodies with a blunt end, like a missile. Both were based on long narrow shapes with pointed ends, the main difference being that the ogive was pointed on only one end.

=== Reduction of drag ===

A number of new techniques developed during and just after World War II were able to dramatically reduce the magnitude of wave drag, and by the early 1950s the latest fighter aircraft could reach supersonic speeds.

These techniques were quickly put to use by aircraft designers. One common solution to the problem of wave drag was to use a swept wing, which had actually been developed before World War II and used on some German wartime designs. Sweeping the wing makes it appear thinner and longer in the direction of the airflow, making a conventional teardrop wing shape closer to that of the von Kármán ogive, while still remaining useful at lower speeds where curvature and thickness are important.

The wing need not be swept when it is possible to build a wing that is extremely thin. This solution was used on a number of designs, beginning with the Bell X-1, the first manned aircraft to fly at the speed of sound. The downside to this approach is that the wing is so thin it is no longer possible to use it for storage of fuel or landing gear. Such wings are very common on missiles, although, in that field, they are often referred to as &quot;fins&quot;.

Fuselage shaping was similarly changed with the introduction of the Whitcomb area rule. Whitcomb had been working on testing various airframe shapes for transonic drag when, after watching a presentation by Adolf Busemann in 1952, he realized that the Sears-Haack body had to apply to the entire aircraft, not just the fuselage. This meant that the fuselage needed to be made narrower where it joined the wings, so that the cross-section of the entire aircraft matched the Sears-Haack body.
Application of the area rule can also be seen in the use of anti-shock bodies on transonic aircraft, including some jet airliners. Anti-shock bodies, which are pods along the trailing edges of the wings, serve the same role as the narrow waist fuselage design of other transonic aircraft.

== Other drag reduction methods ==

Several other attempts to reduce wave drag have been introduced over the years. The supercritical airfoil is a type that results in reasonable low speed lift like a normal airfoil, but has a profile considerably closer to that of the von Kármán ogive. All modern civil airliners use forms of supercritical aerofoil and have substantial supersonic flow over the wing upper surface.

== Mathematical formula ==

=== For flat plate aerofoil ===
formula_1

=== For double-wedge aerofoil ===
formula_2

Where:

formula_3 - Coefficient of drag from wave drag

α - Angle of attack

formula_4 - Thickness to Chord ratio

M - Freestream Mach number
These equations are applicable at low angles of attack (α &lt; 5°)

<text>Jørgen Nash (March 16, 1920 – May 17, 2004) was a Danish artist, writer and central proponent of Situationism.

== Life ==

He was born in Vejrum, Jutland, Denmark, baptized Jørgen Axel Jørgensen, the brother of Asger Jorn. He later changed his family name from Jørgensen to Nash. He was married three times and had six children. His last marriage was with the painter Lis Zwick and would last until his death in 2004. The last forty years of his life he lived in the artist collective &quot;Drakabygget&quot; outside Örkelljunga, Sweden.

From 1948 to 1951 he was involved with CoBrA. He went on to join the Situationist International.

In 1959 he produced Stavrim, Sonetter a book of poetry illustrated by Jorn.

In 1960 he founded the Situationist Bauhaus based at the farm Drakabygget with Jorn.

He was the editor of &quot;Drakabygget&quot;, a journal about art and social philosophy.

In 1963 became an honorary artist of the Royal Danish Academy of Art.

== Exclusion from the SI ==
On 10 February 1962, Nash voted with the majority of the Central Council of the Situationist International, for the exclusion of the Spur group. The majority was 5 to 1, with Dieter Kunzelmann be the only opposer. Nash rebuked those responsible for Spur, was initially in favor of them publishing a retraction, but stopped short of demanding an exclusion. After a debate on this subject, however, Nash decided on the option of exclusion. Kunzelmann too, the only opposing vote, and himself part of Spur, expressed his approval of all the Central Council&#x27;s critiques towards the other Spur members.

In Sweden, in March 1962, Jörgen Nash suddenly attacked the SI in the name of the Scandinavian section, with the tract &quot;Danger! Do Not Lean Out&quot;, and planned to convert the section in another Swedish &quot;Bauhaus&quot;. Reckoning on the considerable geographical dispersion of the Scandinavian situationists, Nash had not even consulted with all of them before his putsch. Surprised at not being unanimously followed and at finding himself countered on the spot by the partisans of the SI majority — Jeppesen Victor Martin, who immediately circulated a definitive repudiation of his imposture — Nash at first feigned astonishment that things had gone to the point of a complete break with the situationists; as if the fact of launching a public surprise attack full of lies was compatible with carrying on a dialogue, on the basis of some sort of Nashist Scandinavian autonomy.

According to the SI, Nash&#x27;s main goal was to use the seal of &quot;situationism&quot; to attract a few highly profitable art dealers. The SI stated that this was confirmed by the fact that Nash&#x27;s new Swedish &quot;Bauhaus&quot;, which consisted of two or three Scandinavian ex-situationists plus &quot;a mass of unknowns flocking to the feast&quot;, immediately plunged into &quot;the most shopworn forms of artistic production&quot;. According to the SI, the development of this conspiracy was no doubt precipitated by the recent elimination of the SI&#x27;s right wing, the Spur group, on whose support the Nashists had relied.

In the tract &quot;Danger! Do Not Lean Out&quot;, Nash, with Ansgar Elde and Jacqueline de Jong, stated that although there may be grounds to criticise the Spur group (Ervin Eisch, Lothar Fischer, Dieter Kunzelmann, Renee Nele, Heimrad Prem, Gretel Stadler, Helmut Sturm and Hand-Peter Zimmer), the way they had been expelled, and the SI itself, were totalitarian. However, the decision followed a debate and was voted by the majority 5 to 1, with Nash also voting in favor of it. Nash also implied that Ansgar Elde was present at the Council and that Jacqueline de Jong was part of if, which was false. The SI, at the behest of Jeppesen Victor Martin, described those they had expelled as &quot;nashists&quot;.

On 24 April 1964 Nash with other members of Bauhaus Situationniste decapitated the statue of The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen harbour. This &quot;manifestation&quot; was part of the movements campaign against consumerist society.

Following his exclusion he became involved in the Second Situationist International and the creation in 1974 of the Situationist Antinational.

<text>Bernard John Taupin (born 22 May 1950) is an English lyricist and visual artist. He is best known for his songwriting partnership with Elton John, recognised as one of the most successful partnerships of its kind in history. Taupin co-wrote the majority of John&#x27;s songs, dating back to the 1960s.

In 1967, Taupin answered an advertisement in the music paper &quot;New Musical Express&quot; placed by Liberty Records, a company that was seeking new songwriters. John responded to the same advertisement and they were brought together, collaborating on many albums since. Taupin and John were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992.

In 2020, Taupin and John received the Oscar for Best Original Song for &quot;(I&#x27;m Gonna) Love Me Again&quot; from the film &quot;Rocketman&quot;. Taupin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the Musical Excellence Award category in 2023. In 2024, Taupin and John were awarded the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. Also in 2024, Taupin won the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.

== Birth and childhood ==
Taupin was born at Flatters House, a farmhouse located between the village of Anwick and the town of Sleaford in Lincolnshire, the son of Robert Taupin and Daphne (). His paternal grandparents were French, the Taupin family having come to London at the turn of the 20th century to set up a wine-importing business.

Taupin&#x27;s father was educated in Dijon and was employed as a stockman by a large farm estate near the town of Market Rasen, Lincolnshire. Taupin&#x27;s mother spent most of the Second World War living in Switzerland. On her return to London, she worked as a governess for the Taupin family, in which connection she met Robert Taupin, whom she married in 1947. The family later moved to Rowston Manor, where they lived rent-free because of Robert&#x27;s promotion to farm manager. This was a significant step up from Flatters farmhouse, which had no electricity.

In 1959, Taupin&#x27;s father decided to try independent farming, and the family moved to the north Lincolnshire village of Owmby-by-Spital, where they lived at the run-down 10-acre Maltkiln Farm, the income from which derived from battery-farming chickens for eggs. The house lacked heating and up-to-date plumbing. Taupin&#x27;s 11-year-younger brother, Kit, was born there.

Unlike his older brother, Tony, who attended a grammar school and later went to university, Taupin was not a diligent student, although he showed an early flair for writing. At 15, he left school and started work as a trainee in the print room of the local newspaper, the &quot;Lincolnshire Standard&quot;, with aspirations of becoming a journalist. Taupin soon left that job, and spent the rest of his teenage years hanging out with friends, hitchhiking the country roads to attend youth club dances in the surrounding villages, playing snooker in the Aston Arms pub in Market Rasen, and drinking. Taupin had worked at several part-time jobs when, at 17, he answered the advertisement that eventually led to his collaboration with Elton John.

== Early influences ==
Taupin&#x27;s mother had studied French literature, and his maternal grandfather John Leonard Patchett &quot;Poppy&quot; Cort, a classics teacher and graduate of the University of Cambridge, instilled in him an appreciation for nature and literature and narrative poetry, both of which influenced his early lyrics.

== Collaborative career ==
=== Collaboration with Elton John (1967–present) ===

In 1967, Taupin answered an advertisement for talent that was placed in the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; by Liberty Records A&amp;R man Ray Williams. Elton John answered the same advert. Neither Taupin nor John passed the audition for Liberty Records. Elton told the man behind the desk that he could not write lyrics, so the man handed Elton a sealed envelope from the pile of people submitting lyrics, which he opened on the London Underground ride home. The envelope contained poems by Taupin.

The duo have collaborated on more than thirty albums since. The team took some time off from each other for a while between 1977 and 1979, while Taupin worked with other songwriters, including Alice Cooper, and John worked with other lyricists, including Gary Osborne and Tom Robinson. (The 1978 single-only A side &quot;Ego&quot; was their only collaboration of note during the period, although John/Taupin B-sides such as &quot;Lovesick&quot; and &quot;I Cry at Night&quot; were issued with the respective singles &quot;Song for Guy&quot; and &quot;Part-time Love&quot; from the album &quot;A Single Man&quot;.)

John and Taupin resumed writing together on an occasional basis in 1980, with Taupin contributing lyrics to several songs on albums such as &quot;21 at 33&quot;, &quot;The Fox&quot;, and &quot;Jump Up!&quot;. However, by 1983&#x27;s &quot;Too Low for Zero&quot;, the two renewed their partnership on a full-time basis and from that point forward Taupin was again John&#x27;s primary lyricist for his solo releases. John often works with other lyricists on specific theatrical or film projects such as 1994&#x27;s &quot;The Lion King&quot; and 2000&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;, both of which featured lyrics by Tim Rice, and 2005&#x27;s &quot;Billy Elliot&quot;, which has script and lyrics by the original film&#x27;s screenwriter, Lee Hall. Hall also wrote the screenplay for the Elton John biopic &quot;Rocketman&quot;, in which Taupin features as a major character.

Taupin wrote the lyrics for &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, &quot;Levon&quot;, &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot;, &quot;Honky Cat&quot;, &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot;, &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Alright for Fighting&quot;, &quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;, &quot;Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot;, &quot;The Bitch is Back&quot;, &quot;Daniel&quot;, and 1970&#x27;s &quot;Your Song&quot;, their first hit. Hits in the 1980s include &quot;I&#x27;m Still Standing&quot;, &quot;I Guess That&#x27;s Why They Call It The Blues&quot;, &quot;Sad Songs&quot;, and &quot;Nikita&quot;. In the 1990s, Taupin and John had more hits, including &quot;The One&quot;, &quot;Simple Life&quot;, &quot;The Last Song&quot;, &quot;Club at the End of the Street&quot; and &quot;Believe&quot;. In September 1997, Taupin rewrote the lyrics of &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; for &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot;, a tribute to the late Diana, Princess of Wales.

The 1991 film documentary &quot;Two Rooms&quot; described the John/Taupin writing style, which involves Taupin writing the lyrics on his own and John then putting them to music, with no further interaction between the two. The process is still fundamentally the same, with John composing to Taupin&#x27;s words, but the two interact on songs far more today, with Taupin joining John in the studio as the songs are written and occasionally during recording sessions.

Taupin and John had their first Broadway musical open in March 2006 with &quot;&quot;. Taupin wrote lyrics for 10 songs (and an 11th completed non-album track &quot;Across the River Thames&quot;) for John&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;The Captain &amp; The Kid&quot; (sequel to &quot;Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy&quot;) and appeared on the cover with him for the first time marking their 40th anniversary of working together. (&quot;Across the River Thames&quot; was issued as an Internet-only download as a bonus with certain editions of &quot;The Captain &amp; the Kid&quot;.)

On 25 March 2007, Taupin made a surprise appearance at John&#x27;s 60th birthday celebration at Madison Square Garden, briefly discussing their 40-year songwriting partnership. Of Taupin&#x27;s importance to their careers, as recorded on the &quot;Elton 60 – Live at Madison Square Garden&quot; DVD, John told the audience that without Taupin there probably would not be an &#x27;Elton John&#x27; as the public has come to know him. Taupin and John also composed several songs for &quot;The Union&quot;, a collaboration album between Elton and his longtime hero Leon Russell released in October 2010. They also collaborated on five original songs for the 2011 Miramax movie &quot;Gnomeo and Juliet&quot;, including the Golden Globe-nominated &quot;Hello Hello&quot;. Taupin and John&#x27;s most-recent album collaboration is &quot;Wonderful Crazy Night&quot;, released in 2016.

In 2018, Taupin and John collaborated on two original songs for the animated film &quot;Sherlock Gnomes&quot;. In 2019, the movie &quot;Rocketman&quot; was released, containing an original song written by Taupin and John for the film, &quot;(I&#x27;m Gonna) Love Me Again&quot;, which plays over the closing credits. The film depicts the personal friendship of Taupin (played by Jamie Bell) and John (played by Taron Egerton) during the 1970s and 1980s. They won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for &quot;(I&#x27;m Gonna) Love Me Again&quot;.

=== Collaboration with other artists ===
In addition to writing for Elton John, Taupin has also written lyrics for use by other composers, with notable successes including &quot;We Built This City&quot;, which was recorded by Starship, and &quot;These Dreams&quot;, recorded by Heart (both of which were collaborations with English composer/musician Martin Page). In 1978, he co-wrote the album &quot;From the Inside&quot; with Alice Cooper.

Taupin also produced &quot;American Gothic&quot; for singer-songwriter David Ackles. Released in 1972, it did not enjoy big sales, but the album was highly acclaimed by music critics in the US and UK. The influential British music critic Derek Jewell of the UK &quot;Sunday Times&quot; described the album as being &quot;the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; of folk.&quot; Of Ackles&#x27;s four albums, it was the only one recorded in England rather than in the United States. Taupin and Ackles had become acquainted when Ackles was selected to be the co-headlining act for Elton John&#x27;s 1970 American debut at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. Taupin was mentioned specifically as being one of the reasons &quot;American Gothic&quot; was selected by the writers and editors for inclusion in the book, &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. He also collaborated on the book &quot;Burning Cold&quot; with photographer Gary Bernstein. In the late 1980s and early 1990s Taupin also collaborated with French American musician, Josquin Des Pres on at least 13 songs in his collection that have been performed and recorded by artists worldwide.

In 2002, Willie Nelson and Kid Rock recorded &quot;Last Stand in Open Country&quot; for Nelson&#x27;s album &quot;The Great Divide&quot;. The song was the title track of the first album from Taupin&#x27;s band Farm Dogs (see below). Nelson&#x27;s album included two other Taupin songs, &quot;This Face&quot; and &quot;Mendocino County Line&quot;. The latter, a duet between Nelson and Lee Ann Womack, was made into a video and released as the album&#x27;s first single. The song won the 2003 Grammy for best vocal collaboration in country music. In 2004, he co-wrote Courtney Love&#x27;s song &quot;Uncool&quot;, from her 2004 debut solo album &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot;. In 2005, he co-wrote the title track to &quot;What I Really Want For Christmas&quot; with Brian Wilson for his first seasonal album. In 2006, he won a Golden Globe Award for his lyrics to the song &quot;A Love That Will Never Grow Old&quot; from the film &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;. The music of the song was composed by Argentine producer and songwriter Gustavo Santaolalla.

== Works as a performer ==
In 1971, Taupin recorded a spoken-word album titled &quot;Taupin&quot;, in which he recites some of his early poems against a background of impromptu, sitar-heavy music created by some members of Elton&#x27;s band, including Davey Johnstone and Caleb Quaye. Side one, &quot;Child&quot;, contains poems about his early childhood in southern Lincolnshire. The first poem, &quot;The Greatest Discovery&quot;, which looks at his birth from the perspective of his older brother Tony, was also set to music by Elton John and included on John&#x27;s second album, &quot;Elton John&quot;. There are poems about Taupin&#x27;s first two childhood homes, Flatters and Rowston Manor, and others about his relationship with his brother and grandfather. Side Two includes a variety of poems of varying obscurity, from a marionette telling her own story to a rat catcher who falls victim to his prey. Taupin stated in interviews that he was not pleased with the album.

In 1980, Taupin recorded his first album as a singer, &quot;He Who Rides the Tiger&quot;. The album failed to make a dent in the charts. Taupin later suggested in interviews that he did not have the creative control he would have liked over the album. In 1987, he recorded another album, &quot;Tribe&quot;. The songs were co-written with Martin Page. &quot;Citizen Jane&quot; and &quot;Friend of the Flag&quot; were released as singles. Videos of both singles featured Rene Russo, the sister of Taupin&#x27;s then wife Toni.

In 1996, Taupin formed a band called Farm Dogs, whose two albums were conscious (and successful) throwbacks to the grittier, earthier sound of &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot;. While Taupin wrote the lyrics, the music was a collaborative effort among the band members. Their first album, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Last Stand in Open Country&quot;, received critical praise but little airplay. The title track was later recorded by Willie Nelson and Kid Rock for Nelson&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;The Great Divide&quot;. In 1998, Farm Dogs released its second and final album, &quot;Immigrant Sons&quot;. The album was unsuccessful despite a tour of small clubs across America.

== Non-musical projects ==
In 1973, Taupin collected all his lyrics up through the &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; album into a book, &quot;Bernie Taupin: The One Who Writes the Words for Elton John&quot;. In addition to the lyrics from the albums, this book contained the lyrics to all the single B-sides, various rarities, and Taupin&#x27;s 1970 spoken-word album. The songs are illustrated by various artists, friends, and celebrity guests such as John Lennon and Joni Mitchell. The book is in black &amp; white except for the cover.

In 1977, Taupin collaborated with rock photographer David Nutter on &quot;It&#x27;s A Little Bit Funny&quot;, adding text and helping chronicle Elton John&#x27;s year-long Louder Than Concorde Tour. The now-collectible book was published in hard and soft cover editions by Penguin Books. It collects the better part of one year&#x27;s worth of personal adventures and memories of Elton and the band, aboard his private plane, on the beaches of Barbados, at backstage gatherings and in some quieter off-stage moments with friends (including some famous faces that Elton and Bernie met and palled around with in their travels).

In 1978, Taupin also appeared in an episode of &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot;, &quot;The Hardy Boys &amp; Nancy Drew Meet Dracula&quot;, singing backup to Shaun Cassidy. In 1988, Taupin published an autobiography of his childhood, &quot;A Cradle of Haloes: Sketches of a Childhood&quot;. The book was released only in the UK. It tells the tale of a childhood fuelled by fantasy in rural Lincolnshire in the 1950s and 1960s, ending in 1969 as Taupin gets on the train to seek his fortune in London.

In 1991, Taupin self-published a book of poems called &quot;The Devil at High Noon&quot;. In 1994, Taupin&#x27;s lyrics up through the &quot;Made in England&quot; album were collected into a hardcover book, &quot;Elton John &amp; Bernie Taupin: The Complete Lyrics&quot;, published by Hyperion. However, it does not appear that Taupin was intimately involved in this project, as it contains multiple misspellings and outright misrenderings of the lyrics. It is also missing some of the rarities and B-sides found in the earlier collection. As with the 1973 collection, the songs are illustrated by various artists, this time in full colour throughout.

In 1992, Taupin was asked to produce a benefit for AIDS Project Los Angeles. The event featured no songs written by the writer, instead opening with an acoustic set of performances of material chosen by the performers followed by selections from the musical &quot;West Side Story&quot;, chosen for its &quot;timeless message of tolerance that is relevant to every decade.&quot;

=== Visual art career ===
In addition to his music, much of his time is spent creating his visual art. Attributing his passion for art to his mother, Daphne, Taupin began displaying and selling his original artwork in 2010. Consisting of large, mixed media, contemporary assemblages, the art has been shown and collected across the United States and Canada.

Taupin&#x27;s artwork has been seen at Art Miami, Art Southampton, the LA Art Fair, and in various galleries. His artwork often incorporates the American flag.

== Personal life ==

Taupin has been married four times. His first three marriages ended in divorce. His wives were: Maxine Feibelman (1971–77); Toni Lynn Russo (1979–91), sister of actress Rene Russo; Stephanie Haymes Roven (1993–98), daughter of entertainers Dick Haymes and Fran Jeffries; and Heather Kidd (March 2004–present), with whom he has two daughters.

Taupin moved to the United States from England in the mid-1970s. In 1990, he became a U.S. citizen and lives in Santa Barbara County, California.

Taupin was part-owner of the American bucking bull Little Yellow Jacket, who competed in the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) circuit and was PBR Bull of the Year from 2002 through 2004.

Taupin was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2022 New Year Honours for services to music.

<doc id="262283" wikidata="Q2427809" url="?curid=262283" title="Thomas Tusser">
<text>Thomas Tusser (c. 15243 May 1580) was an English poet and farmer, best known for his instructional poem &quot;Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry&quot;, an expanded version of his original title, &quot;A Hundreth Good Pointes of Husbandrie&quot;, first published in 1557. For Tusser the garden was the domain of the housewife, and the 1562 text expands on this theme. Scholars also consider it a text of interest for its defence of enclosures. It was among the best selling poetry books of the Elizabethan age.

==Early life==
Tusser was born in Rivenhall, Essex, about 1524, the son of William and Isabella Tusser. At a very early age he became a chorister in St Nicholas&#x27; Collegiate Chapel in Wallingford Castle, Wallingford, Oxfordshire. He appears to have been pressed for service in the King&#x27;s Chapel, the choristers of which were usually afterwards placed by the King in one of the Royal Foundations at Oxford or Cambridge but Tusser entered the choir of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, and from there went to Eton College. He has left a quaint account of his privations at Wallingford, and of the severities of Nicholas Udall at Eton.

He was elected to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1543, a date which sets the earliest limit of his birth-year, as he would have been ineligible at nineteen. From King&#x27;s College he moved to Trinity Hall, Cambridge. On leaving Cambridge, he went to court in the service of William Paget, 1st Baron Paget of Beaudesart, as a musician. After ten years of life at court, he married and settled as a farmer at Cattawade, Suffolk, near the River Stour.

==Literary career==
There he wrote &quot;A Hundreth Good Pointes of Husbandrie&quot;, a long poem in rhyming couplets recording the country year. This work was first printed in London in 1557 by the publisher Richard Tottel, and was frequently reprinted. Tottel published an enlarged edition &quot;Five Hundreth Pointes of Good Husbandrie&quot; in 1573. Tusser includes a homely mix of instructions and observations about farming and country customs which offer insight into life in Tudor England, and his work records many terms and proverbs in print for the first time. In this work, he also famously presents ten characteristics the perfect cheese must have:

Not like Gehazi, i.e., dead white, like a leper
Not like Lot&#x27;s wife, all salt
Not like Argus, full of eyes
Not like Tom Piper, &quot;hoven and puffed&quot;
Not like Crispin, leathery
Not like Lazarus, poor
Not like Esau, hairy
Not like Mary Magdalene, full of whey or maudlin
Not like the Gentiles, full of maggots
Not like a Bishop, made of burnt milk
He never remained long in one place. For the sake of his wife&#x27;s health he removed to Ipswich. 
After her death he married again and farmed for some time at West Dereham in Norfolk. He then became a singing man in Norwich Cathedral, where he found a good patron in the Dean, John Salisbury.

===Samples===
&quot;Five Hundred Points&quot; contains these rhyming couplets:

&quot;Swéete April showers,&quot;
&quot;Doo spring Maie flowers.&quot;
as well as
&quot;At Christmas play and make good cheere,&quot;
&quot;for Christmas comes but once a yeere.&quot;
and
&quot;A foole and his monie be soone at debate,&quot;
&quot;which after with sorrow repents him too late.&quot;
The latter is an early version of the proverb &quot;A fool and his money are soon parted.&quot;

==Later life==
After another experiment in farming at Fairstead, Essex, he moved once again to London, whence he was driven by the plague of 1572–1573 to find refuge at Trinity Hall, being matriculated as a servant of the college in 1573. At the time of his death he was in possession of a small estate at Chesterton, near Cambridge, and his will proves that he was not, as has sometimes been stated, in poverty of any kind, but had in some measure the thrift he preached. Thomas Fuller says he &quot;traded at large in oxen, sheep, dairies, grain of all kinds, to no profit&quot;; that he &quot;spread his bread with all sorts of butter, yet none would stick thereon.&quot;

==Death==
Tusser died on 3 May 1580 at the age of about 55. An erroneous inscription at Manningtree, Essex, asserts that he was 65 years old.

According to John Stow&#x27;s &quot;Survey of London&quot;, Cheape Ward, Thomas Tusser was buried in the now lost church of St Mildred in the Poultry. The inscription on his tomb there was as follows:

&quot;Here Thomas Tusser, clad in earth, doth lie,
That sometime made the pointes of Husbandrie;
By him then learne thou maiest; here learne we must,
When all is done, we sleepe, and turne to dust:
And yet, through Christ, to Heaven we hope to goe;
Who reades his bookes, shall find his faith was so.&quot;

Stow&#x27;s editor adds the following epigram on Tusser from a volume called &quot;The More the Merrier&quot; (1608), by &#x27;H. P.&#x27;:

&quot;Ad Tusserum&quot;
&quot;Tusser, they tell me, when thou wert alive,
Thou, teaching thrift, thyselfe couldst never thrive.
So, like the whetstone, many men are wont
To sharpen others, when themselves are blunt.&quot;

<text>In mathematics, the symmetric difference of two sets, also known as the disjunctive union and set sum, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. For example, the symmetric difference of the sets formula_1 and formula_2 is formula_3.

The symmetric difference of the sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; is commonly denoted by formula_4 (alternatively, formula_5), formula_6, or formula_7.
It can be viewed as a form of addition modulo 2.

The power set of any set becomes an abelian group under the operation of symmetric difference, with the empty set as the neutral element of the group and every element in this group being its own inverse. The power set of any set becomes a Boolean ring, with symmetric difference as the addition of the ring and intersection as the multiplication of the ring.

== Properties ==
The symmetric difference is equivalent to the union of both relative complements, that is:

:formula_8

The symmetric difference can also be expressed using the XOR operation ⊕ on the predicates describing the two sets in set-builder notation:

:formula_9

The same fact can be stated as the indicator function (denoted here by formula_10) of the symmetric difference, being the XOR (or addition mod 2) of the indicator functions of its two arguments: formula_11 or using the Iverson bracket notation formula_12.

The symmetric difference can also be expressed as the union of the two sets, minus their intersection:

:formula_13

In particular, formula_14; the equality in this non-strict inclusion occurs if and only if formula_15 and formula_16 are disjoint sets. Furthermore, denoting formula_17 and formula_18, then formula_19 and formula_20 are always disjoint, so formula_19 and formula_20 partition formula_23. Consequently, assuming intersection and symmetric difference as primitive operations, the union of two sets can be well &quot;defined&quot; in terms of symmetric difference by the right-hand side of the equality

:formula_24.

The symmetric difference is commutative and associative:

:formula_25

The empty set is neutral, and every set is its own inverse:
:formula_26

Thus, the power set of any set &quot;X&quot; becomes an abelian group under the symmetric difference operation. (More generally, any field of sets forms a group with the symmetric difference as operation.) A group in which every element is its own inverse (or, equivalently, in which every element has order 2) is sometimes called a Boolean group; the symmetric difference provides a prototypical example of such groups. Sometimes the Boolean group is actually defined as the symmetric difference operation on a set. In the case where &quot;X&quot; has only two elements, the group thus obtained is the Klein four-group.

Equivalently, a Boolean group is an elementary abelian 2-group. Consequently, the group induced by the symmetric difference is in fact a vector space over the field with 2 elements Z2. If &quot;X&quot; is finite, then the singletons form a basis of this vector space, and its dimension is therefore equal to the number of elements of &quot;X&quot;. This construction is used in graph theory, to define the cycle space of a graph.

From the property of the inverses in a Boolean group, it follows that the symmetric difference of two repeated symmetric differences is equivalent to the repeated symmetric difference of the join of the two multisets, where for each double set both can be removed. In particular:

:formula_27

This implies triangle inequality: the symmetric difference of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; is contained in the union of the symmetric difference of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and that of &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;.

Intersection distributes over symmetric difference:
:formula_28

and this shows that the power set of &quot;X&quot; becomes a ring, with symmetric difference as addition and intersection as multiplication. This is the prototypical example of a Boolean ring.

Further properties of the symmetric difference include:

* formula_29 if and only if formula_30.
* formula_31, where formula_32, formula_33 is formula_15&#x27;s complement, formula_16&#x27;s complement, respectively, relative to any (fixed) set that contains both.
* formula_36, where formula_37 is an arbitrary non-empty index set.
* If formula_38 is any function and formula_39 are any sets in formula_40&#x27;s codomain, then formula_41

The symmetric difference can be defined in any Boolean algebra, by writing
:formula_42

This operation has the same properties as the symmetric difference of sets.

==&quot;n&quot;-ary symmetric difference==
Repeated symmetric difference is in a sense equivalent to an operation on a multitude of sets (possibly with multiple appearances of the same set) giving the set of elements which are in an odd number of sets.

The symmetric difference of a collection of sets contains just elements which are in an odd number of the sets in the collection:
formula_43

Evidently, this is well-defined only when each element of the union formula_44 is contributed by a finite number of elements of formula_45.

Suppose formula_46 is a multiset and formula_47. Then there is a formula for formula_48, the number of elements in formula_49, given solely in terms of intersections of elements of formula_45:
formula_51

==Symmetric difference on measure spaces==
As long as there is a notion of &quot;how big&quot; a set is, the symmetric difference between two sets can be considered a measure of how &quot;far apart&quot; they are.

First consider a finite set &quot;S&quot; and the counting measure on subsets given by their size. Now consider two subsets of &quot;S&quot; and set their distance apart as the size of their symmetric difference. This distance is in fact a metric, which makes the power set on &quot;S&quot; a metric space. If &quot;S&quot; has &quot;n&quot; elements, then the distance from the empty set to &quot;S&quot; is &quot;n&quot;, and this is the maximum distance for any pair of subsets.

Using the ideas of measure theory, the separation of measurable sets can be defined to be the measure of their symmetric difference. If μ is a σ-finite measure defined on a σ-algebra Σ, the function
:formula_52

is a pseudometric on Σ. &quot;dμ&quot; becomes a metric if Σ is considered modulo the equivalence relation &quot;X&quot; ~ &quot;Y&quot; if and only if formula_53. It is sometimes called Fréchet-Nikodym metric. The resulting metric space is separable if and only if L2(μ) is separable.

If formula_54, we have: formula_55. Indeed,
:formula_56

If formula_57 is a measure space and formula_58 are measurable sets, then their symmetric difference is also measurable: formula_59. One may define an equivalence relation on measurable sets by letting formula_60 and formula_61 
be related if formula_62. This relation is denoted formula_63.

Given formula_64, one writes formula_65 if to each formula_66 there&#x27;s some formula_67 such that formula_68. The relation &quot;formula_69&quot; is a partial order on the family of subsets of formula_70.

We write formula_71 if formula_65 and formula_73. The relation &quot;formula_74&quot; is an equivalence relationship between the subsets of formula_70.

The &quot;symmetric closure&quot; of formula_76 is the collection of all formula_70-measurable sets that are formula_74 to some formula_79. The symmetric closure of formula_76 contains formula_76. If formula_76 is a sub-formula_83-algebra of formula_70, so is the symmetric closure of formula_76.

formula_63 iff formula_87 formula_88 almost everywhere.

== Hausdorff distance vs. symmetric difference ==

The Hausdorff distance and the (area of the) symmetric difference are both pseudo-metrics on the set of measurable geometric shapes. However, they behave quite differently. The figure at the right shows two sequences of shapes, &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Red ∪ Green&quot;. When the Hausdorff distance between them becomes smaller, the area of the symmetric difference between them becomes larger, and vice versa. By continuing these sequences in both directions, it is possible to get two sequences such that the Hausdorff distance between them converges to 0 and the symmetric distance between them diverges, or vice versa.

<text>Faro is a town in central Yukon, Canada, the home of the now abandoned Faro Mine. It was the largest open-pit lead–zinc mine in the world as well as a significant producer of silver and other natural resources. The mine was built by the Ralph M. Parsons Construction Company of the United States with General Enterprises Ltd. of Whitehorse being the main subcontractor. As of 2021, the population is 440, down from its peak population of 1,652 in 1981. Faro was named after the card game of the same name. 

As these industries have declined over the past decade, Faro is attempting to attract ecotourism to the region to view such animals as Dall and Stone sheep. Both species of sheep are almost unique to the surrounding area. Several viewing platforms have been constructed in and around the town.

One unusual feature of Faro is that it has a golf course running through the main part of town.

== History ==
The area was prospected in the 1950s and 1960s by Al Kulan, credited with discovering several significant deposits of lead and zinc ore and playing a major role in the discovery of the Faro Mine, which became Canada&#x27;s largest lead-zinc mine. The Cyprus Anvil Mining Corporation established the first operations to mine the deposits, and established the town of Faro. A new highway was built between Carmacks and Ross River to serve the Faro area – initially numbered Highway 9, it is today part of the Robert Campbell Highway, Yukon Highway 4. A forest fire in 1969 destroyed the newly built homes, which had to be re-built.

On 26 October 2021, two people were killed and another critically injured in an active shooter situation in Faro. A suspect, identified as a local resident, was taken into custody by police and charged with two counts each of first-degree murder, attempted murder, and aggravated assault. Flags were lowered to half-mast in Whitehorse and Dawson City in response to the killings.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Faro had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Economy ==

=== Faro Mine ===
The mine was opened by the Cyprus Anvil Mining Corporation in 1969, which was formed to mine the deposit. From the late 1960s until 1982 the mine was one of the largest lead-zinc mines in the world. At one time it was the largest open-pit mine in the world. During its history, 320 million tonnes of waste rock was removed to reach the ore. The mine remained in more-or-less constant production until 1982. Trucks carried the ore concentrate from the mill by highway to Whitehorse, where the buckets were lifted from the trucks and lowered onto cars of the White Pass and Yukon Route railway. The trains took the buckets another to Skagway, Alaska, where the contents were poured out into the holds of ships.

During those years, Cyprus Anvil was purchased by Dome Petroleum. World prices for metals fell in 1982, and the mine owners announced in May a two-month halt to production starting in June, 1982. In July, the mine owners extended the shutdown to four months. In September, the owners announced that the shutdown would be indefinite. The shock to the Yukon economy, where the mine produced approximately 40% of territorial GDP, was enormous. With government assistance an 18-month waste-rock stripping program was operated in 1983 and 1984. Curragh Resources purchased the property in 1985 and production resumed in 1986. This time, ore was trucked in ore pots from Faro directly to Skagway, bypassing the railway. This operation ended in 1993, not long after Curragh Resources suffered a coal mining disaster at the Westray Mine in Plymouth, Pictou County, Nova Scotia. A third operation, by the Anvil Range Mining Corporation, opened in 1995 and ceased production in January 1998, followed by the bankruptcy of Anvil Range. Much of the heavy mining and milling equipment was sold and removed from the Yukon.

Any prospect for further mining of the lead-zinc resource would now require significant investment to bring in mining equipment, and it would need to come entirely by road unless a British Columbia-Alaska railway is built or the White Pass route is reopened to freight traffic to Whitehorse. Cost of clean-up is estimated at close to a billion dollars.

When the mine closed it left 70 million tonnes of tailings and 320 million tonnes of waste rock that require remediation to protect the health of humans, land, water, and wildlife. With the bankruptcy of Anvil Range the clean up bill for the mine and tailings pond fell to the federal government. Early estimates put the cost at $450–590 million over 40 years. In 2016 the federal treasury reported that between $250 million and $350 million had been spent maintaining the mine site, without starting clean-up. The $40 million annual costs are to run pumps to prevent the tailings from breaching the dams and the construction and operations of three water treatment plants. The clean-up itself could cost a further $1-billion.

In a report by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 2017, the Canadian government stated that they were prepared to embark on the remediation process of the Faro Mine. The concerns listed by federal officials include the leaching of toxic metals into the Pelly and Yukon rivers as the acidic rock drainage worsens over time. The remediation work will include rerouting regional creeks to avoid tailings and waste rock areas, treating contaminated water, and avoiding clean water from becoming contaminated.

== Infrastructure ==
The town is served by the Faro Airport and the Robert Campbell Highway passes through just south of Faro.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Faro has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) with mild summers and severely cold winters. Extreme seasonal swings are common, although less severe than farther east in Canada due to the warm spells in summers and occasional mild spells in winter.

==People connected with Faro==
* Lorne Greene, famous for his work in &quot;Bonanza&quot; and &quot;Lorne Greene&#x27;s New Wilderness&quot;, once narrated a film about Faro called &quot;A New World in the Yukon&quot;.
* The digital artist Astra Zero grew up in Faro

<text>A public company is a company whose ownership is organized via shares of stock which are intended to be freely traded on a stock exchange or in over-the-counter markets. A public (publicly traded) company can be listed on a stock exchange (listed company), which facilitates the trade of shares, or not (unlisted public company). In some jurisdictions, public companies over a certain size must be listed on an exchange. In most cases, public companies are &quot;private&quot; enterprises in the &quot;private&quot; sector, and &quot;public&quot; emphasizes their reporting and trading on the public markets.

Public companies are formed within the legal systems of particular states and so have associations and formal designations, which are distinct and separate in the polity in which they reside. In the United States, for example, a public company is usually a type of corporation, though a corporation need not be a public company. In the United Kingdom, it is usually a public limited company (PLC). In France, it is a (SA). In Germany, it is an (AG). While the general idea of a public company may be similar, differences are meaningful and are at the core of international law disputes with regard to industry and trade.

== Securities ==
Usually, the securities of a publicly traded company are owned by many investors while the shares of a privately held company are owned by relatively few shareholders. A company with many shareholders is not necessarily a publicly traded company. Conversely, a publicly traded company typically (but not necessarily) has many shareholders. In the United States, companies with over 500 shareholders in some instances are required to report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; companies that report under the 1934 Act are generally deemed public companies.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
=== Advantages ===
A public company possess some advantages over privately held businesses.

* Publicly traded companies are able to raise funds and capital through the sale (in the primary or secondary market) of shares of stock. That is the reason publicly traded corporations are important since prior to their existence, it was very difficult to obtain large amounts of capital for private enterprises, as significant capital could come only from a smaller set of wealthy investors or banks willing to risk typically large investments. The profit on stock is gained in form of dividend or capital gain to the holders.
* The financial media, analysts, and the public are able to access additional information about the business, since the business is commonly legally bound, and naturally motivated (so as to secure further capital), to disseminate public information regarding the financial status and future of the company to its many shareholders and the government.
* Because many people have a vested interest in the company&#x27;s success, the company may be more popular or recognizable than a private company.
* The initial shareholders of the company are able to share risk by selling shares to the public. For example, the founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, owned 29.3% of the company&#x27;s class A shares in 2013, which gave him enough voting power to control the business and allowed Facebook to raise capital from and to distribute risk to the remaining shareholders. Facebook had been a privately held company prior to its initial public offering in 2012.
* If some shares are given to managers or other employees, potential conflicts of interest between employees and shareholders (an instance of principal–agent problem) will be remitted. As an example, in many tech companies, entry-level software engineers are given stock in the company upon being hired and so they become shareholders. Therefore, the engineers have a vested interest in the company succeeding financially and are incentivized to work harder and more diligently to ensure that success.
* Public companies have fiduciary duty to their shareholders, in addition to the directors&#x27; fiduciary duty to the company itself.

=== Disadvantages ===
Many stock exchanges require that publicly traded companies have their accounts regularly audited by outside auditors and then publish the accounts to their shareholders. Besides the cost, that may make useful information available to competitors. Various other annual and quarterly reports are also required by law. In the United States, the Sarbanes–Oxley Act imposes additional requirements. The requirement for audited books is not imposed by the exchange known as OTC Pink. The shares may be maliciously held by outside shareholders and the original founders or owners may lose benefits and control. The principal–agent problem, or the agency problem is a key weakness of public companies. The separation of a company&#x27;s ownership and control is especially prevalent in such countries as the United Kingdom and the United States.

== Stockholders ==
In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires firms whose stock is traded publicly to report their major shareholders each year. The reports identify all institutional shareholders (primarily firms that own stock in other companies), all company officials who own shares in their firm, and all individuals or institutions owning more than 5% of the firm&#x27;s stock.

== General trend ==
For many years, newly created companies were privately held but held initial public offering to become publicly traded company or to be acquired by another company if they became larger and more profitable or had promising prospects. More infrequently, some companies such as the investment banking firm Goldman Sachs and the logistics services provider United Parcel Service (UPS) chose to remain privately held for a long period of time after maturity into a profitable company.

However, from 1997 to 2012, the number of corporations publicly traded on US stock exchanges dropped 45%. According to one observer (Gerald F. Davis), &quot;public corporations have become less concentrated, less integrated, less interconnected at the top, shorter lived, less remunerative for average investors, and less prevalent since the turn of the 21st century&quot;.

== Privatization ==
In corporate privatization, more often called &quot;going private,&quot; a group of private investors or another company that is privately held can buy out the shareholders of a public company, taking the company off the public markets. That is typically done through a leveraged buyout and occurs when the buyers believe the securities have been undervalued by investors. In some cases, public companies that are in severe financial distress may also approach a private company or companies to take over ownership and management of the company. One way of doing so would be to make a rights issue designed to enable the new investor to acquire a supermajority. With a supermajority, the company could then be relisted, or privatized.

Alternatively, a publicly traded company may be purchased by one or more other publicly traded companies, with the target company becoming either a subsidiary or joint venture of the purchaser(s), or ceasing to exist as a separate entity, its former shareholders receiving compensation in the form of either cash, shares in the purchasing company or a combination of both. When the compensation is primarily shares then the deal is often considered a merger. Subsidiaries and joint ventures can also be created &quot;&quot;. That often happens in the financial sector. Subsidiaries and joint ventures of publicly traded companies are not generally considered to be privately held companies (even though they themselves are not publicly traded) and are generally subject to the same reporting requirements as publicly traded companies. Finally, shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures can be (re)-offered to the public at any time. Firms that are sold in this manner are called spin-outs.

Most industrialized jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations that detail the steps that prospective owners (public or private) must undertake if they wish to take over a publicly traded corporation. That often entails the would-be buyer(s) making a formal offer for each share of the company to shareholders.

== Trading and valuation ==

The shares of a publicly traded company are often traded on a stock exchange. The value or &quot;size&quot; of a company is called its market capitalization, a term which is often shortened to &quot;market cap&quot;. This is calculated as the number of shares outstanding (as opposed to authorized but not necessarily issued) times the price per share. For example, a company with two million shares outstanding and a price per share of US$40 has a market capitalization of US$80 million. However, a company&#x27;s market capitalization should not be confused with the fair market value of the company as a whole since the price per share are influenced by other factors such as the volume of shares traded. Low trading volume can cause artificially low prices for securities, due to investors being apprehensive of investing in a company they perceive as possibly lacking liquidity.

For example, if all shareholders were to simultaneously try to sell their shares in the open market, this would immediately create downward pressure on the price for which the share is traded unless there were an equal number of buyers willing to purchase the security at the price the sellers demand. So, sellers would have to either reduce their price or choose not to sell. Thus, the number of trades in a given period of time, commonly referred to as the &quot;volume&quot; is important when determining how well a company&#x27;s market capitalization reflects true fair market value of the company as a whole. The higher the volume, the more the fair market value of the company is likely to be reflected by its market capitalization.

Another example of the impact of volume on the accuracy of market capitalization is when a company has little or no trading activity and the market price is simply the price at which the most recent trade took place, which could be days or weeks ago. This occurs when there are no buyers willing to purchase the securities at the price being offered by the sellers and there are no sellers willing to sell at the price the buyers are willing to pay. While this is rare when the company is traded on a major stock exchange, it is not uncommon when shares are traded over-the-counter (OTC). Since individual buyers and sellers need to incorporate news about the company into their purchasing decisions, a security with an imbalance of buyers or sellers may not feel the full effect of recent news.

<text>A secondary chord is an analytical label for a specific harmonic device that is prevalent in the tonal idiom of Western music beginning in the common practice period: the use of diatonic functions for tonicization.

Secondary chords are a type of altered or borrowed chord, chords that are not part of the music piece&#x27;s key. They are the most common sort of altered chord in tonal music. Secondary chords are referred to by the function they have and the key or chord in which they function. Conventionally, they are written with the notation &quot;&quot;function&quot;/&quot;key&quot;&quot;. Thus, one of the most common secondary chords, the dominant of the dominant, is written &quot;V/V&quot; and read as &quot;five of five&quot; or &quot;the dominant of the dominant&quot;. The major or minor triad on any diatonic scale degree may have any secondary function applied to it; secondary functions may even be applied to diminished triads in some special circumstances.

Secondary chords were not used until the Baroque period and are found more frequently and freely in the Classical period, even more so in the Romantic period. Composers began to use them less frequently with the breakdown of conventional harmony in modern classical music—but secondary dominants are a cornerstone of popular music and jazz in the 20th century.

==Secondary dominant==

A secondary dominant (also applied dominant, artificial dominant, or borrowed dominant) is a major triad or dominant seventh chord built and set to resolve to a scale degree other than the tonic. The dominant (seventh) of the dominant (written as V7/V or V7 of V) is the most frequently encountered. The chord that the secondary dominant is the dominant of is said to be a temporarily &quot;tonicized chord&quot;. The secondary dominant is normally, though not always, followed by the tonicized chord. Tonicizations that last longer than a phrase are generally regarded as modulations to a new key (or new tonic).

According to music theorists David Beach and Ryan C. McClelland, &quot;[t]he purpose of the secondary dominant is to place emphasis on a chord within the diatonic progression.&quot; The secondary-dominant terminology is still usually applied even if the chord resolution is nonfunctional. For example, the V/ii label is still used even if the V/ii chord is not followed by ii.

===Definition===

The major scale contains seven basic chords, which are named with Roman numeral analysis in ascending order. Because tonic triads are either major or minor, one would not expect to find diminished chords (either the vii in major or the ii in minor) tonicized by a secondary dominant. It would also not make sense for the tonic of the key itself to be tonicized.

In the key of C major, the five remaining chords are:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\relative c&#x27; {
 &lt;d f a&gt;1_\markup { \translate #&#x27;(-4 . 0) { &quot;C: ii&quot; \hspace #7 &quot;iii&quot; \hspace #6.5 &quot;IV&quot; \hspace #6.5 &quot;V&quot; \hspace #6.8 &quot;vi&quot; } }_\markup { \translate #&#x27;(-2 . 0) &quot;d minor&quot; \hspace #1 &quot;e minor&quot; \hspace #1 &quot;F major&quot; \hspace #1 &quot;G major&quot; \hspace #1 &quot;a minor&quot; }
 &lt;e g b&gt; 
 &lt;f a c&gt;
 &lt;g b d&gt;
 &lt;a c e&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

Of these chords, the V chord (G major) is said to be the dominant of C major. However, each of the chords from ii to vi also has its own dominant. For example, V (G major) has a D major triad as its dominant. These extra dominant chords are not part of the key of C major as such because they include notes that are not part of the C major scale. Instead, they are secondary dominants.

The notation below shows the secondary-dominant chords for C major. Each chord is accompanied by its standard number in harmonic notation. In this notation, a secondary dominant is usually labeled with the formula &quot;V of ...&quot; (dominant chord of); thus &quot;V of ii&quot; stands for the dominant of the ii chord, &quot;V of iii&quot; for the dominant of iii, and so on. A shorter notation, used below, is &quot;V/ii&quot;, &quot;V/iii&quot;, etc.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\relative c&#x27; {
 &lt;a cis e&gt;2_\markup { \translate #&#x27;(-4 . 0) { &quot;C: V/ii ii&quot; \hspace #4.5 &quot;V/iii iii&quot; \hspace #1.8 &quot;V/IV IV&quot; \hspace #2.2 &quot;V/V V&quot; \hspace #2.8 &quot;V/vi vi&quot; } }_\markup { &quot;A Dm&quot; \hspace #4.5 &quot;B Em&quot; \hspace #2.5 &quot;C F&quot; \hspace #4.2 &quot;D G&quot; \hspace #4.3 &quot;E Am&quot; }
 &lt;d f a&gt;
 &lt;e g b&gt;
 &lt;c e g&gt; &lt;f a c&gt;
 &lt;d fis a&gt; &lt;g b d&gt;
 &lt;e gis b&gt; &lt;a c e&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

Like most chords, secondary dominants may be seventh chords or chords with other upper extensions. Dominant seventh chords are commonly used as secondary dominants. The notation below shows the same secondary dominants as above but with dominant seventh chords.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\relative c&#x27; {
 &lt;a cis e g&gt;2_\markup { \concat { \translate #&#x27;(-4 . 0) { &quot;C: V&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;7&quot; &quot;/ii ii&quot; \hspace #4.2 &quot;V&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;7&quot; &quot;/iii iii&quot; \hspace #2.3 &quot;V&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;7&quot; &quot;/IV IV&quot; \hspace #2.0 &quot;V&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;7&quot; &quot;/V V&quot; \hspace #2.3 &quot;V&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;7&quot; &quot;/vi vi&quot; } } }_\markup { \concat { &quot;A&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;7&quot; &quot; Dm&quot; \hspace #4 &quot;B&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;7&quot; &quot; Em&quot; \hspace #3.5 &quot;C&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;7&quot; &quot; F&quot; \hspace #4 &quot;D&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;7&quot; &quot; G&quot; \hspace #3.8 &quot;E&quot; \raise #1 \small &quot;7&quot; &quot; Am&quot; } }
 &lt;d f a&gt;
 &lt;e g b&gt;
 &lt;c e g bes&gt; &lt;f a c&gt;
 &lt;d fis a c&gt; &lt;g b d&gt;
 &lt;e gis b d&gt; &lt;a c e&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

Note that the triad V/IV is the same as the I triad. When a seventh is added (V7/IV), it becomes an altered chord because the seventh is not a diatonic pitch. Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 begins with a V7/IV chord:

&lt;/score&gt;

According to the principles exposed above, in fact, V7/IV, which means the C7 chord, i.e. the dominant seventh chord on the F major scale (C–E–G–B♭), does not represent the tonic because it contains a B♭, which isn&#x27;t included in the main key, as Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 is written in the key of C major. The chord then resolves on the natural IV (F major) and in the following bar the V7, i.e. G7 (dominant seventh chord on the C major key), is presented.

Chromatic mediants, for example VI is also a secondary dominant of ii (V/ii) and III is V/vi, are distinguished from secondary dominants with context and analysis revealing the distinction.

=== History ===

Before the 20th century, in the music of J.S. Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Brahms, a secondary dominant, along with its chord of resolution, was considered a modulation. Since this was a rather self-contradictory description, theorists in the early 1900s, such as Hugo Riemann (who used the term &quot;Zwischendominante&quot;—&quot;intermediary dominant&quot;, still the usual German term for a secondary dominant), searched for a better description of the phenomenon.

Walter Piston first used the analysis &quot;V7 of IV&quot; in a monograph entitled &quot;Principles of Harmonic Analysis&quot;. In his 1941 book &quot;Harmony&quot;, Piston used the term &quot;secondary dominant&quot;. At around the same time (1946–48), Arnold Schoenberg created the expression &quot;artificial dominant&quot; to describe the same phenomenon, in his posthumously published book &quot;Structural Functions of Harmony&quot;.

In the fifth edition of Walter Piston&#x27;s &quot;Harmony&quot;, a passage from the last movement of Mozart&#x27;s Piano Sonata K. 283 in G major serves as one illustration of secondary dominants. This passage has three secondary dominants. The final four chords form a circle of fifths progression, ending in a standard dominant-tonic cadence, which concludes the phrase.

===In jazz and popular music===

In jazz harmony, a secondary dominant is any dominant seventh chord on a weak beat and resolves downward by a perfect fifth. Thus, a chord is a secondary dominant when it functions as the dominant of some harmonic element other than the key&#x27;s tonic and resolves to that element. This is slightly different from the traditional use of the term, where a secondary dominant does not have to be a seventh chord, occur on a weak beat, or resolve downward. If a non-diatonic dominant chord is used on a strong beat, it is considered an extended dominant. If it doesn&#x27;t resolve downward, it may be a borrowed chord.

Secondary dominants are used in jazz harmony in the bebop blues and other blues progression variations, as are substitute dominants and turnarounds. In some jazz tunes, all or almost all of the chords that are used are dominant chords. For example, in the standard jazz chord progression ii–V–I, which would normally be Dm–G7–C in the key of C major, some tunes will use D7–G7–C7. Since jazz tunes are often based on the circle of fifths, this creates long sequences of secondary dominants.

Secondary dominants are also used in popular music. Examples include II7 (V7/V) in Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Think Twice, It&#x27;s All Right&quot; and III7 (V7/vi) in Betty Everett&#x27;s &quot;The Shoop Shoop Song (It&#x27;s in His Kiss)&quot;. &quot;Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue&quot; features chains of secondary dominants. &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot; opens with V/V/V–V/V–V–I. 

===Extended dominant===

An extended dominant chord is a secondary dominant seventh chord that resolves down by a fifth to another dominant seventh chord. A series of extended dominant chords continues to resolve downwards by the circle of fifths until it reaches the tonic chord. The most common extended dominant chord is the tertiary dominant, which resolves to a secondary dominant. For example, V/V/V (in C major, A(7)) resolves to V/V (D(7)), which resolves to V (G(7)), which resolves to I. Note that V/V/V is the same chord as V/ii, but differs in its resolution to a major dominant rather than a minor chord.

Quaternary dominants are rarer, but an example is the bridge section of the rhythm changes, which starts from V/V/V/V (in C major, E(7)). The example below from Chopin&#x27;s Polonaises, Op. 26, No. 1 (1835) has a quaternary dominant in the second beat (V/ii = V/V/V, V/vi = V/V/V/V).

== Secondary leading-tone ==

In music theory, a secondary leading-tone chord is a secondary chord that is rooted on a tone that is a leading-tone of (in short, has a strong affinity to resolve to) a tone just 1 semitone from that root (typically 1 semitone above, though can be below). Like the secondary &quot;dominant&quot; it can be used as tonicization of only one subsequent chord (which will be rooted in the resolution tone), or the music can continue with other chords/notes in the key of that chord&#x27;s root for a phrase, or even longer to be considered a modulation to that key. This one-semitone-apart resolution of the secondary &quot;leading-tone&quot; is in contrast to the secondary &quot;dominant&quot; which resolves through a wider distance of perfect fifth below or perfect fourth above the chord&#x27;s root (as per the two distances between dominant and tonic).

While the root of a secondary leading-tone chord needs to be the leading-tone, the other notes may vary and form with it one of: the triad or one of the diminished sevenths (as in seventh scale degree or leading-tone, not necessarily seventh chord) where the type of the diminished seventh is typically related to the type of tonicized triad:
# If the tonicized triad is minor, the leading-tone chord is fully diminished seventh chord.
# If it is major, the leading-tone chord may be either half-diminished or fully diminished, though fully diminished chords are used more often.

Because of their symmetry, secondary leading-tone diminished seventh chords are also useful for modulation; all four notes may be considered the root of any diminished seventh chord. They may resolve to these major or minor diatonic triads:

:In major keys: ii, iii, IV, V, vi
:In minor keys: III, iv, V, VI

Especially in four-part writing, the seventh should resolve downwards by step and if possible the lower tritone should resolve appropriately, inwards if a diminished fifth and outwards if an augmented fourth, as the example below shows.

Secondary leading-tone chords were not used until the Baroque period and are found more frequently and less conventionally in the Classical period. They are found even more frequently and freely in the Romantic period, but they began to be used less frequently with the breakdown of conventional harmony.

The chord progression vii/V–V–I is quite common in ragtime music.

== Secondary supertonic ==
The secondary supertonic chord, or secondary second, is a secondary chord that is on the supertonic scale degree. Rather than tonicizing a degree other than the tonic, as does a secondary dominant, it creates a temporary dominant. Examples include ii7/III (Fmin.7, in C major), ii7/II (Amin.7, in F major), ii7/V (Emin.7, in G major), and ii7/IV (Bmin.7, in E major).
== Secondary subdominant ==
The secondary subdominant is the subdominant (IV) of the tonicized chord. For example, in G major, the supertonic chord is A minor and the IV of ii chord is D major.

==Others==
The other secondary functions are the secondary mediant, the secondary submediant, and the secondary subtonic.

In probability theory and statistics, the Rayleigh distribution is a continuous probability distribution for nonnegative-valued random variables. Up to rescaling, it coincides with the chi distribution with two degrees of freedom.
The distribution is named after Lord Rayleigh ().

A Rayleigh distribution is often observed when the overall magnitude of a vector in the plane is related to its directional components. One example where the Rayleigh distribution naturally arises is when wind velocity is analyzed in two dimensions.
Assuming that each component is uncorrelated, normally distributed with equal variance, and zero mean, which is infrequent, then the overall wind speed (vector magnitude) will be characterized by a Rayleigh distribution. 
A second example of the distribution arises in the case of random complex numbers whose real and imaginary components are independently and identically distributed Gaussian with equal variance and zero mean. In that case, the absolute value of the complex number is Rayleigh-distributed.

==Definition==

The probability density function of the Rayleigh distribution is

:formula_9

where formula_2 is the scale parameter of the distribution. The cumulative distribution function is

:formula_11

for formula_12

==Relation to random vector length==

Consider the two-dimensional vector formula_13 which has components that are bivariate normally distributed, centered at zero, with equal variances formula_14, and independent. Then formula_15 and formula_16 have density functions

:formula_17

Let formula_18 be the length of formula_19. That is, formula_20 Then formula_18 has cumulative distribution function

:formula_22

where formula_23 is the disk

:formula_24

Writing the double integral in polar coordinates, it becomes

:formula_25

Finally, the probability density function for formula_18 is the derivative of its cumulative distribution function, which by the fundamental theorem of calculus is

:formula_27

which is the Rayleigh distribution. It is straightforward to generalize to vectors of dimension other than 2. 
There are also generalizations when the components have unequal variance or correlations (Hoyt distribution), or when the vector &quot;Y&quot; follows a bivariate Student &quot;t&quot;-distribution (see also: Hotelling&#x27;s T-squared distribution).

Suppose formula_19 is a random vector with components formula_29 that follows a multivariate t-distribution. If the components both have mean zero, equal variance and are independent, the bivariate Student&#x27;s-t distribution takes the form:

:formula_30

Let formula_31 be the magnitude of formula_19. Then the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the magnitude is:

:formula_33

where formula_34 is the disk defined by:

:formula_35

Converting to polar coordinates leads to the CDF becoming:

:formula_36

Finally, the probability density function (PDF) of the magnitude may be derived:

:formula_37

In the limit as formula_38, the Rayleigh distribution is recovered because:

:formula_39

==Properties==
The raw moments are given by:
: formula_40 
where formula_41 is the gamma function.

The mean of a Rayleigh random variable is thus :
:formula_42

The standard deviation of a Rayleigh random variable is:

:formula_43

The variance of a Rayleigh random variable is :

:formula_44

The mode is formula_45 and the maximum pdf is

:formula_46

The skewness is given by:

:formula_47

The excess kurtosis is given by:

:formula_48

The characteristic function is given by:

:formula_49

where formula_50 is the imaginary error function. The moment generating function is given by

:formula_51

where formula_52 is the error function.

===Differential entropy===

The differential entropy is given by

:formula_53

where formula_54 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant.

== Parameter estimation ==

Given a sample of &quot;N&quot; independent and identically distributed Rayleigh random variables formula_55 with parameter formula_2,

: formula_57 is the maximum likelihood estimate and also is unbiased.

:formula_58 is a biased estimator that can be corrected via the formula

:formula_59 formula_60, where c4 is the correction factor used to unbias estimates of standard deviation for normal random variables.

=== Confidence intervals ===
To find the (1 − &quot;α&quot;) confidence interval, first find the bounds formula_61 where:
:  formula_62
then the scale parameter will fall within the bounds
:  formula_63

== Generating random variates ==

Given a random variate &quot;U&quot; drawn from the uniform distribution in the interval (0, 1), then the variate

:formula_64

has a Rayleigh distribution with parameter formula_2. This is obtained by applying the inverse transform sampling-method.

==Related distributions==

* formula_66 is Rayleigh distributed if formula_67, where formula_68 and formula_69 are independent normal random variables. This gives motivation to the use of the symbol formula_2 in the above parametrization of the Rayleigh density.
* The magnitude formula_71 of a standard complex normally distributed variable &quot;z&quot; is Rayleigh distributed.
* The chi distribution with &quot;v&quot; = 2 is equivalent to the Rayleigh Distribution with &quot;σ&quot; = 1: formula_72 
* If formula_73, then formula_74 has a chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom: formula_75
* If formula_66, then formula_77 has a gamma distribution with integer scale parameter formula_78 and rate parameter formula_79
*: formula_80 with integer shape parameter &quot;N&quot; and rate parameter formula_81
*: formula_82 with integer shape parameter &quot;N&quot; and scale parameter formula_83
* The Rice distribution is a noncentral generalization of the Rayleigh distribution: formula_84.
* The Weibull distribution with the shape parameter &quot;k&quot; = 2 yields a Rayleigh distribution. Then the Rayleigh distribution parameter formula_2 is related to the Weibull scale parameter according to formula_86
* If formula_18 has an exponential distribution formula_88, then formula_89
* The half-normal distribution is the one-dimensional equivalent of the Rayleigh distribution.
* The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution is the three-dimensional equivalent of the Rayleigh distribution.

== Applications ==

An application of the estimation of σ can be found in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As MRI images are recorded as complex images but most often viewed as magnitude images, the background data is Rayleigh distributed. Hence, the above formula can be used to estimate the noise variance in an MRI image from background data.

The Rayleigh distribution was also employed in the field of nutrition for linking dietary nutrient levels and human and animal responses. In this way, the parameter σ may be used to calculate nutrient response relationship.

In the field of ballistics, the Rayleigh distribution is used for calculating the circular error probable—a measure of a gun&#x27;s precision.

In physical oceanography, the distribution of significant wave height approximately follows a Rayleigh distribution.

<text>A nonchord tone (NCT), nonharmonic tone, or embellishing tone is a note in a piece of music or song that is not part of the implied or expressed chord set out by the harmonic framework. In contrast, a chord tone is a note that is a part of the functional chord. Nonchord tones are most often discussed in the context of the common practice period of classical music, but the term can also be used in the analysis of other types of tonal music, such as Western popular music.

Nonchord tones are often categorized as &quot;accented non-chord tones&quot; and &quot;unaccented non-chord tones&quot; depending on whether the dissonance occurs on an accented or unaccented beat (or part of a beat).

Over time, some musical styles assimilated chord types outside of the common-practice style. In these chords, tones that might normally be considered nonchord tones are viewed as chord tones, such as the seventh of a minor seventh chord. For example, in 1940s-era bebop jazz, an F played with a C chord would be considered a chord tone if the chord were analyzed as C7(11). In European classical music, &quot;[t]he greater use of dissonance from period to period as a result of the dialectic of linear/vertical forces led to gradual normalization of ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chords [in analysis and theory]; each additional non-chord tone above the foundational triad became frozen into the chordal mass.&quot;

== Theory ==

Chord and nonchord tones are defined by their membership (or lack of membership) in a chord: &quot;The pitches which make up a chord are called &quot;chord-tones&quot;: any other pitches are called &quot;non-chord-tones&quot;.&quot; They are also defined by the time at which they sound: &quot;&quot;Nonharmonic tones&quot; are pitches that sound along with a chord but are not chord pitches.&quot; For example, if an excerpt from a piece of music implies or uses a C-major chord, then the notes C, E and G are members of that chord, while any other note played at that time (e.g., notes such as F) is a nonchord tone. Such tones are most obvious in homophonic music but occur at least as frequently in contrapuntal music.

According to &quot;Music in Theory and Practice,&quot; &quot;Most nonharmonic tones are dissonant and create intervals of a second, fourth or seventh&quot;, which are required to resolve to a chord tone in conventional ways. If the note fails to resolve until the next change of harmony, it may instead create a seventh chord or extended chord. While theoretically in a three-note chord, there are nine possible nonchord tones in equal temperament, in practice nonchord tones are usually in the prevailing key. Augmented and diminished intervals are also considered dissonant, and all nonharmonic tones are measured from the bass note, or lowest note sounding in the chord except in the case of nonharmonic bass tones.

Nonharmonic tones generally occur in a pattern of three pitches, of which the nonharmonic tone is the center:

Nonchord tones are categorized by how they are used. The most important distinction is whether they occur on a strong or weak beat and are thus either accented or unaccented nonchord tones. They are also distinguished by their direction of approach and departure and the voice or voices in which they occur and the number of notes they contain.

==Unaccented==
===Anticipation===
An &quot;anticipation&quot; (ANT) occurs when this note is approached by step and then remains the same. It is basically a note of the second chord played early. In the example below, the dissonant B in bar 1 is approached by step and resolves when that same pitch becomes a chord tone in bar 2.

A &quot;portamento&quot; is the late Renaissance precursor to the anticipation, though today it refers to a glissando.

 »
&lt;/score&gt;

=== Neighbor tone ===
A &quot;neighbor tone&quot; (NT) or &quot;auxiliary note&quot; (AUX) is a nonchord tone that passes stepwise from a chord tone directly above or below it (which frequently causes the NT to create dissonance with the chord) and resolves to the same chord tone:

 &lt;c g&#x27;&gt;2 &lt;c g&#x27;&gt; \bar &quot;||&quot;
 »
&lt;/score&gt;

In practice and analysis, neighboring tones are sometimes differentiated depending upon whether or not they are lower or higher than the chord tones surrounding them. A neighboring tone that is a step higher than the surrounding chord tones is called an &quot;upper neighboring tone&quot; or an &quot;upper auxiliary note&quot; while a neighboring tone that is a step lower than the surrounding chord tones is a &quot;lower neighboring tone&quot; or &quot;lower auxiliary note&quot;. However, following Heinrich Schenker&#x27;s usage in &quot;Free Composition&quot;, some authors reserve the term &quot;neighbor note&quot; to the lower neighbor a half step below the main note.

The German term &quot;Nebennote&quot; is a somewhat broader category, including all nonchord tones approached from the main note by step.

===Escape tone===
An &quot;escape tone&quot; (ET) or &quot;echappée&quot; is a particular type of unaccented incomplete neighbor tone that is approached stepwise from a chord tone and resolved by a skip in the opposite direction back to the harmony.

===Passing tone===
A &quot;passing tone&quot; (PT) or &quot;passing note&quot; is a nonchord tone prepared by a chord tone a step above or below it and resolved by continuing in the same direction stepwise to the next chord tone (which is either part of the same chord or of the next chord in the harmonic progression).

Where two nonchord tones are before the resolution they are &quot;double passing tones&quot; or &quot;double passing notes&quot;.

==Accented non-chord tones==

===Passing tone===
A tone that sits between two chord tones and is between them.

===Neighbor tone===
A neighbour tone is where there is a step up or down from a note (or chord tone) and then move back to the original note.

&lt;/score&gt;

===Suspension and retardation===
A &quot;suspension&quot; (SUS) (sometimes referred to as a &quot;syncope&quot;) occurs when the harmony shifts from one chord to another, but one or more notes of the first chord (the preparation) are either temporarily held over into or are played again against the following chord (against which they are nonchord tones called the &quot;suspension&quot;) before resolving downwards to a chord tone by step (the resolution). The whole process is called a &quot;suspension&quot; as well as the specific nonchord tone(s).

Suspensions may be further described with two numbers: (1) the interval between the suspended note and the bass note and (2) the interval between the resolution and the bass note. The most common suspensions are 4–3 suspension, 7–6 suspension, or 9–8 suspension. Note that except for the 9–8 suspensions, the numbers are typically referred to using the simple intervals, so for instance, if the intervals are actually an 11th and a 10th (the first example below), one would typically call it a &quot;4–3 suspension&quot;. If the bass note is suspended, then the interval is calculated between the bass and the part that is most dissonant with it, often resulting in a 2–3 suspension.

Suspensions must resolve downwards. If a tied note is prepared like a suspension but resolves upwards, it is called a &quot;retardation&quot;. Common retardations include 2–3 and 7–8 retardations.

Decorated suspensions are common and consist of portamentos or double eighth notes, the second being a lower neighbor tone.

===Appoggiatura===
An &quot;appoggiatura&quot; (APP) is a type of accented incomplete neighbor tone approached skip-wise from one chord tone and resolved stepwise to another chord tone (&quot;overshooting&quot; the chord tone).

===Nonharmonic bass===
&quot;Nonharmonic bass&quot; notes are bass notes that are not a member of the chord below which they are written. Examples include the Elektra chord. An example of a nonharmonic bass from the third movement of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Symphony of Psalms&quot;.

==Involving more than three notes==

===Changing tones===
&quot;Changing tones&quot; (CT) are two successive nonharmonic tones. A chord tone steps to a nonchord tone which skips to another nonchord tone which leads by step to a chord tone, often the same chord tone. They may imply neighboring tones with a missing or implied note in the middle. Also called &quot;double neighboring tones&quot; or &quot;neighbor group&quot;.

&lt;/score&gt;

===Pedal point===
Another form of nonchord tone is a &quot;pedal point&quot; or &quot;pedal tone&quot; (PD) or &quot;note&quot;, almost always the tonic or dominant, which is held through a series of chord changes. The pedal point is almost always in the lowest voice (the term originates from organ playing), but it may be in an upper voice; then it may be called an &quot;inverted pedal&quot;. It may also be between the upper and lower voices, in which case it is called an &quot;internal pedal&quot;.

==Chromatic nonharmonic tone==
A &quot;chromatic nonharmonic tone&quot; is a nonharmonic tone that is chromatic, or outside of the key and creates half-step motion. The use of which, especially &quot;chromatic appoggiaturas&quot; and &quot;chromatic passing tones&quot;, increased in the Romantic Period. The example below shows chromatic nonharmonic tones (in red) in the first four measures of Chopin&#x27;s Prelude No. 21, op. 28.

<text>The University of Tübingen, officially the Eberhard Karl University of Tübingen (; ), is a public research university located in the city of Tübingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

The University of Tübingen is one of eleven German Excellence Universities. The University of Tübingen is especially known as a centre for the study of plant biology, medicine, law, archeology, ancient cultures, philosophy, theology, religious studies, humanities, and more recently as a center of excellence for artificial intelligence. The university&#x27;s noted alumni and faculty include presidents, a pope, EU Commissioners, judges of the Federal Constitutional Court, and Johannes Kepler, a renowned astronomer of the 17th-century Scientific Revolution. The university is associated with eleven Nobel laureates, especially in the fields of medicine and chemistry. 
==History==

The University of Tübingen was founded in 1477 by Count Eberhard V (Eberhard im Bart, 1445–1496), later the first Duke of Württemberg, a civic and ecclesiastic reformer who established the school after becoming absorbed in the Renaissance revival of learning during his travels to Italy. Its first rector was Johannes Nauclerus.

Its present name was conferred on it in 1769 by Duke Karl Eugen who appended his first name to that of the founder. The university later became the principal university of the kingdom of Württemberg. Today, it is one of nine state universities funded by the German federal state of Baden-Württemberg.
The University of Tübingen has a history of innovative thought, particularly in theology, in which the university and the Tübinger Stift are famous to this day. Philipp Melanchthon (1497–1560), the prime mover in building the German school system and a chief figure in the Protestant Reformation, helped establish its direction. Among Tübingen&#x27;s eminent students (and/or professors) have been the astronomer Johannes Kepler; the economist Horst Köhler (President of Germany); Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI), poet Friedrich Hölderlin, and the philosophers Friedrich Schelling and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. &quot;The Tübingen Three&quot; refers to Hölderlin, Hegel and Schelling, who were roommates at the Tübinger Stift. Theologian Helmut Thielicke revived postwar Tübingen when he took over a professorship at the reopened theological faculty in 1947, being made administrative head of the university and President of the Chancellor&#x27;s Conference in 1951. Philosopher and theologian Ernst Bloch is another prominent figure associated with Tübingen&#x27;s postwar revival.

The university rose to the height of its prominence in the middle of the 19th century with the teachings of poet and civic leader Ludwig Uhland and the Protestant theologian Ferdinand Christian Baur, whose circle, colleagues and students became known as the &quot;Tübingen School&quot;, which pioneered the historical-critical analysis of biblical and early Christian texts, an approach generally referred to as &quot;higher criticism&quot;. The University of Tübingen also was the first German university to establish a faculty of natural sciences, in 1863. DNA was discovered in 1868 at the University of Tübingen by Friedrich Miescher. Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard, the first female Nobel Prize winner in medicine in Germany, also works at Tübingen. The faculty for economics and business was founded in 1817 as the &quot;Staatswissenschaftliche Fakultät&quot; and was the first of its kind in Germany.

Starting in the late 1990s at Tübingen, fundamental research on mRNA-based substances (e.g. for cancer treatment and vaccines) was conducted by groups led by H. G. Rammensee and G. Jung. This work contributed to the Ph.D. and later research of Ingmar Hoerr and by extension to the COVID-19 vaccine programs by BioNTech, Moderna and Curevac.

===Nazi period===

The university played a leading role in efforts to legitimize the policies of the Third Reich as &quot;scientific&quot;. Even before the victory of the Nazi Party in the general election in March 1933, there were hardly any Jewish faculty and a few Jewish students. Physicist Hans Bethe was dismissed on 20 April 1933 because of &quot;non-Aryan&quot; origin. Religion professor Traugott Konstantin Oesterreich and the mathematician Erich Kamke were forced to take early retirement, probably in both cases the &quot;non-Aryan&quot; origin of their wives. At least 1,158 people were sterilized at the University Hospital.

===After the war===
In 1966, Joseph Ratzinger, who would later become Pope Benedict XVI, was appointed to a chair in dogmatic theology in the Faculty of Catholic Theology at Tübingen, where he was a colleague of Hans Küng.In 1967, Jürgen Moltmann (b. 1926), one of the most influential Protestant theologians of the 20th century, was appointed Professor of Systematic Theology in the Faculty of Protestant Theology. Drafted in 1944 by Nazi Germany, he was an Allied prisoner of war 1945–1948. He was influenced by his Tübingen colleague and friend Ernst Bloch, the Marxist philosopher.

In 1970, the university was restructured into a series of faculties as independent departments of study and research after the manner of French universities.

The university made the headlines in November 2009 when a group of left-leaning students occupied one of the main lecture halls, the Kupferbau, for several days. The students&#x27; goal was to protest tuition fees and maintain that education should be free for everyone.

In May 2010, Tübingen joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Dartmouth College (US), Durham University (UK), Queen&#x27;s University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of Western Australia (Australia) and Uppsala University (Sweden).

On 27 April 2022, for the first time, a woman was elected Rector in the person of Karla Pollmann.

==Research focus==

The University of Tübingen undertakes a broad range of research projects in various fields. Among the more prominent ones in the natural sciences are the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research, which focuses on general, cognitive and cellular neurology as well as neurodegeneration, and the Centre for Interdisciplinary Clinical Research, which deals primarily with cell biology in diagnostics and therapy of organ system diseases. In the liberal arts, the University of Tübingen is noteworthy for having the only faculty of rhetoric in Germany – the department was founded by Walter Jens, an important intellectual and literary critic. The university also boasts continued pre-eminence in its centuries-old traditions of research in the fields of philosophy, theology and philology. Since at least the nineteenth century, Tübingen has been the home of world-class research in prehistoric studies and the study of antiquity, including the study of the ancient Near East; a particular focus of the research in these areas at the University of Tübingen has been Anatolia, e.g., through the continued excavations of the university at Troy. The University of Tübingen is also host to a number of Collaborative Research Centres, producing fundamental interdisciplinary research.

The Coin Collection of the Institute of Classical Archaeology at the University of Tübingen [Münzsammlung des Instituts für Klassische Archäologie der Universität Tübingen] is one of the largest coin collections in Germany. The current Director is Prof Dr Stefan Krmnicek.

==Campus==

The University of Tübingen is not a campus university, but is spread throughout the town: Tübingen is one of five classical &quot;university towns&quot; in Germany. The other four are Marburg, Göttingen, Freiburg and Heidelberg. In Tübingen there are four areas with a major concentration of university institutions.
*The university uses a number of buildings in the old town of Tübingen, some of which date back to the foundation of the university. Today, these are mainly used by smaller humanities departments, as is the adjacent medieval castle, &quot;Schloss Hohentübingen&quot;.
*Northeast of the old town, the &quot;Wilhelmstraße&quot; area surrounding the street of the same name is home to larger humanities departments as well as the university&#x27;s administration. The main university library and main refectory are also in this area.
* A new campus for the sciences was built in the 1970s at &quot;Morgenstelle&quot;, a hill north of the historic centre of Tübingen. Facilities include a large refectory.
* The university&#x27;s teaching hospitals are located between the Wilhelmstraße area and the Morgenstelle campus in an area collectively known as the &quot;Klinikum&quot;. The 17 hospitals in Tübingen affiliated with the university&#x27;s faculty of medicine have 1,500 patient beds, and cater to 66,000 in-patients and 200,000 out-patients on an annual basis.

Accommodation provided by the Tübingen Studentenwerk is in several locations throughout the town. The largest of the eleven halls of residence are in the city&#x27;s northern neighbourhood of &quot;Waldhäuser Ost&quot; (1,700 rooms) and in the city&#x27;s southeasternmost neighbourhood, &quot;Französisches Viertel&quot; (500 rooms).

== Museum ==
Since 2006, the Museum of the University of Tübingen (MUT) has made it its task to professionalize the 65 sometimes very old and singular teaching, show and research collections of the university from all faculties in terms of collection, curatorial and organizational aspects. In interdisciplinary exhibitions, both the broader public should be provided with insights into the history of science as well as researched in the field of science itself.

In addition, the master&#x27;s degree program &quot;Museum &amp; Collections&quot; of the MUT, with the participation of six humanities and cultural studies subjects, offers the training of students in the field of exhibitions.

Eight scientific teaching collections – Origins of Art, Pile Dwellings + Celts, Cuneiform, Gods + Tombs, Ancient Art, Ancient Coins, Ancient Sculptures – are open to the public in the Museum Alte Kulturen and in the permanent exhibition WeltKulturen in Hohentübingen Castle. In addition, there are other, partially accessible scientific teaching collections on Hohentübingen: Cradle of Biochemistry (Schlosslabor), BildBestand, Everyday Culture, AntikenBilder, Professor Gallery (partial), Castle Church and TonSteineScherben.

The MUT – and thus the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen – is the only university institution in the world to house artefacts with world heritage status, such as the oldest surviving figurative works of art and musical instruments of humanity, mammoth ivory figures and fragments of bone flutes. These come from the Vogelherdhöhle (Swabian Alb), which has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage &quot;Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura&quot; since 2017.

==Libraries==

The University Library of Tübingen is not just available to those affiliated with the university, but also to the general public. The library provides more than three million individual volumes and more than 7,600 journals. Apart from the main library, more than 80 departmental libraries containing an additional three million volumes are also associated with the university.

The main lending library is located on Wilhelmstraße and consists of several different parts which are connected through corridors and walkways:
*The Bonatzbau, the library&#x27;s oldest building, was built in 1912 and currently houses the historical reading room (Historischer Lesesaal), the university archive, along with a number of manuscript collections.
*The library&#x27;s main building, constructed in 1963, contains the information desk and research stations to access electronic catalogues and databases.
*The Ammerbau is the most recent addition to the library complex. Built in 2002, it offers users direct access to over 300,000 volumes and latest issues of newspapers, magazines and journals. It also contains numerous work places and separate individual rooms for group work.

==Organisation==

===Faculties===

The university is made up of seven faculties, some of which are subdivided into further departments.
*Protestant Theology
*Catholic Theology
*Law
*Medicine
*Humanities
*Economics and Social Sciences
*Science

===Governance===
The university is governed by three separate bodies sharing different functions and duties. However, some persons serve in more than one body.

The Rectorate is the executive component of the university&#x27;s governing body. The current rector, Professor Karla Pollmann, is supported by four deputies consisting of three prorectors and one provost. All are also permanent members of the university senate.

The Senate forms the legislative section of governance. Apart from the members of the rectorate, it includes the equal opportunities commissioner, the deans and 20 elected members representing the professors, lecturers, students and non-academic staff. Two advisors represent the university&#x27;s teaching hospitals.

The University Council (&quot;Hochschulrat&quot; or &quot;Universitätsrat&quot;) has 13 members, including its president and vice-president as well as five further internal and six external members.

==Rankings and reputation==
As of the 2024 edition of the &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot;, the University of Tübingen ranks 213th globally, which places it at 11th position nationally within Germany. The university&#x27;s rank appears significantly higher in the 2024 &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot;, standing at an 95th position globally and 8th nationally. The &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot;, also known as the Shanghai Ranking, for the year 2023 places the University of Tübingen in the 151–200 bracket globally, and within the 6–9 bracket in the national ranking.



Since 2012, the University of Tübingen has been regarded as one of eleven German Excellence Universities that have been successful in the competition of the German Universities Excellence Initiative. The award brings additional research funds for five years. With three successful research Clusters of Excellence approved by the German Universities Excellence Initiative in 2018, Tübingen is one of the three universities with the highest research output in Germany and leading among universities in South Germany.

According to the funding report of the German Research Foundation (DFG) 2018, which breaks down the grants awarded to German universities from 2014 to 2016, the University of Tübingen was ranked 8th overall, 4th in humanities and social sciences, and 6th in life sciences including medicine. This ranking is based on a selection of best research projects nationwide and thus regarded as an indicator of the quality of research.

US News Best Global Universities and also ranked Tübingen amongst the top ten universities in Germany overall in 2021.

Traditionally, Tübingen has been particularly strong in the fields of humanities, especially in theology and religious studies, medicine, and law. The Tübingen Law School was ranked second nationwide by the Wirtschaftswoche University Ranking. Also according to international rankings, Tübingen regularly ranks among the top ten law schools in Germany.

===Controversies===
Since 2018, the university has been part of a wider artificial intelligence research initiative named Cyber Valley. Cyber Valley has seen investments from multinational companies poured into establishing research centers, research groups, and professorships in the city. The investing organisations and corporations include Google, Amazon, BMW, IAV, Daimler, Porsche, and Bosch. The Cyber Valley initiative has attracted criticism from student groups and activist groups alike, with many protest actions, including building occupations and demonstrations, having taken place decrying both the commercialisation of university research and the involvement of the university with organisations that are engaged in military research.

==Student life==

The university&#x27;s students make up roughly a third of the total population of Tübingen and the town&#x27;s culture can seem to be largely dominated by them. As a result there is a slump of activity during university holidays, particularly over the summer when a large number of otherwise regular events are not happening.

Around 30 &quot;Studentenverbindungen&quot;, the German type of fraternities, are associated with the university. While famous for their parties, public academic lectures and the yearly &quot;Stocherkahn-Rennen&quot; punting-boat race on the Neckar river, some of them are the subject of ongoing controversy surrounding alleged rightwing policial views, leading to strong criticism from leftist groups. The university itself takes a neutral stance on this issue. However, all of Tübingen&#x27;s fraternities distance themselves from the fraternities of the Deutsche Burschenschaft, which have been widely criticized as adhering to far-right principles.

Also closely linked to the university are a number of student societies representing mainly the arts and political parties. Most notable are a number of choirs as well as student theatre groups affiliated with the faculty of Modern Languages, some of which perform in foreign languages. &quot;Radio Uniwelle Tübingen&quot; is the university&#x27;s radio station, airing seven hours of programmes a week produced by students under the supervision of staff employed by the university.

The university also offers gym and sports classes called &quot;Hochschulsport&quot;. Since Tübingen has a department of sports science with a broad range of facilities, students of other subjects have the possibility to participate in various kinds of sports courses in teams or as individuals. Furthermore, even exotic sports, such as parachuting or martial arts, are offered. Students may attend courses either for free or at reduced rates. The sports department is located close to the &quot;Wilhelmstraße&quot; area of university buildings and is served by a number of frequent bus routes.
Unlike in some major cities, student discounts are not widely available in Tübingen. Cinemas and the town council&#x27;s public library in particular do not offer discounts for students, and there are only a handful of restaurants which have reduced lunch deals. However, students may benefit from the &quot;Semesterticket&quot;, a heavily discounted public transport season pass offering six months of unlimited travel on trains and buses in the naldo &quot;Verkehrsverbund&quot; transport association for approximately €62.50. The Landestheater Tübingen theatre and all public swimming pools also have discounts for students.

Nightlife in Tübingen is centered on the numerous pubs in the old town along with a number of clubs, most of which dedicate themselves to non-mainstream music. During the semester, the Studentenwerk-owned &quot;Clubhaus&quot; at the centre of the Wilhelmstraße university area hosts the weekly &quot;Clubhausfest&quot; on Thursday nights. This popular, free-entry club night is organized and promoted by student societies and &quot;Fachschaft&quot; student representative bodies and all proceeds go towards their activities in support of students.

== Notable academic staff ==

* Eberhard Jüngel (1934–2021), German Lutheran theologian
* Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard (born 1942), German developmental biologist and 1995 Nobel Prize-winner
* Hildegard Temporini-Gräfin Vitzthum, (1939–2004), German ancient historian

== Notable alumni ==


The University of Tübingen has a long list of notable alumni and staff. As of 2023, eleven Nobel Laureates, 18 Leibniz Laureates and five Alexander von Humboldt Professorships are affiliated with the university.

Besides several Federal Ministers of Germany and Minister Presidents of German States, politicians associated with the University of Tübingen include six founding fathers of the Federal Republic of Germany, a Chancellor of Germany, two Presidents of Germany, and several European Commissioners.

As Tübingen has traditionally been home to one of the most prestigious law schools in Germany, alumni in the legal profession include at least 19 judges of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, the first female German judge at the European Court of Justice, an Advocate General at the European Court of Justice, as well as several judges at the Federal Court of Justice, the Federal Fiscal Court, and the Federal Labour Court. Notable legal scholars associated with Tübingen include Dieter Medicus, Klaus Hopt and Wolfgang Ernst.

Affiliates in the field of religious studies include many of the most influential theologians of the last centuries such as Pope Benedict XVI, Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Eduard Mörike, Miroslav Volv, Paul Tillich, David Strauss and Philip Melanchthon. The field of religious studies in Tübingen has also been the educational center for the philosophers Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, Friedrich Hölderlin und Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Tübingen is therefore sometimes considered as the home of German idealism, a philosophical movement which had a severe impact on modern western thinking.

<text>Zamora () is a city and municipality of Spain located in the autonomous community of Castile and León. It is the capital of the province of Zamora. The city straddles the Duero river. With its 24 characteristic Romanesque style churches of the 12th and 13th centuries it has been called a &quot;museum of Romanesque art&quot;. Zamora is the city with the most Romanesque churches in all of Europe. The most important celebration in Zamora is Holy Week.

Zamora is part of the natural &quot;comarca&quot; of Tierra del Pan and it is the head of the judicial district of Zamora.

==History==
The city was founded early in the Bronze Age and was later occupied during the Iron Age by the Celtic people of the Vacceos who called it Ocalam.

After the Roman victory over the Lusitanian hero Viriathus the settlement was named by the Romans &quot;Occelum Durii&quot; or &quot;Ocellodurum&quot; (literally, &quot;Eye of the Duero&quot;). During Roman rule it was in the hands of the Vaccaei, and was incorporated into the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis. It was on the road from Emerita (modern Mérida) to Asturica Augusta (modern Astorga). (Ant. Itin. pp. 434, 439).

Two coins from the reign of the Visigothic king Sisebuto, show that it was known at the time as &quot;Semure&quot;.

Following the campaigns of Musa ibn Nusayr in the 710s in the context of the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the town was conquered and a Berber garrison was left in the there, but following the Arab-Berber strifes, the territory was reportedly seized by Alfonso I of Asturias. Not much attention was paid however to the place in the chronicles from this period, as Asturian human resources at the time were mostly targeted at the Cantabrian coast and little is known about the inhabitants of the Duero Valley.

According to the chronicle of Al-Andalus by , Alfonso III of Asturias determined the Christian repopulation of the place in 280 AH (893–894 AD) (although the dates of 881, 899 and 910 AD have been also reported). A diocese and a bishop were established in the town in the early 10th century. Mozarab builders came from Toledo. The city became one of the most thriving Christian cities in Iberia in the early 10th century, possibly even passing León.

Zamora became the target of Ibn al-Qitt, who unsuccessfully tried to invade the city in 901 with help from Berbers. It was also attacked several times during the Caliphal era, and Almanzor eventually seized the city in 966. The place returned to Christian control during the reign of Alfonso V of León.

Since the early 11th century, with the repopulation works by Raymond of Burgundy, the place saw planned repopulating efforts. A new perimeter of city walls was also erected in the 11th century. The population &quot;intramuros&quot; included the nobles and regal officers, the clergy, Frank settlers from Gascogne, Poitou and Provence who had installed in the city during the time of Raymond of Burgundy, settlers of Asturian, Leonese and Galician origin, as well as some Mozarabs. Zamora was granted a &quot;fuero&quot; in 1208.

The most notable historic episode in Zamora was the assassination outside the city walls of the king Sancho II of Castile in 1072. Some decades before, king Ferdinand I of León had divided his kingdoms between his three sons. To his daughter, Doña Urraca, he had bequeathed the &quot;well fortified city of Zamora&quot; (or &quot;la bien cercada&quot; in Spanish). All three sons warred among themselves, till the ultimate winner, Sancho, was left victorious. Zamora, under his sister who was allied with Leonese nobles, resisted. Sancho II of Castile, assisted by El Cid, laid siege to Zamora. King Sancho II was murdered by a duplicitous noble of Zamora, Bellido Dolfos, who tricked the king into a private meeting. After the death of Sancho, Castile reverted to his deposed brother Alfonso VI of León. The event was commemorated by the Portillo de la Traición (Treason Gate).

In the late middle ages, Zamora was one of the 17 cities (18 after the inclusion of Granada) that enjoyed a vote at the Cortes of the Crown of Castile, actually speaking on behalf of all of Galicia since the early 15th century (Galicia did not have any city with representation until the 17th century).

Zamora was also the scene of fierce fighting in the 15th century, during the conflict between the supporters of Isabella the Catholic and Juana la Beltraneja. The Spanish proverb, &quot;No se ganó Zamora en una hora&quot;, literally, &quot;Zamora wasn&#x27;t won in an hour&quot;, is a reference to these battles. It is the Spanish equivalent of the English proverb &quot;Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day.&quot;

During the 12th century, the city was extraordinarily important for its strategic position in the wars between the Kingdom of León and the Almoravids and Almohads. As a result, the city preserves many churches and buildings from that time. In the 1140s and 1150s it was ruled by Prince Ponce Giraldo de Cabrera, who has a street named after him in the city today.

Henry IV granted Zamora the epithet of &quot;most noble and most loyal city&quot;.

The city leaned towards support to the Revolt of the Comuneros in the northern hemisphere Fall of 1520. By September 1520, the &quot;corregidor&quot; appointed by the Crown was ousted and replaced by an &quot;alcalde&quot; designated by the community. However, the hopes of the rebels across the Crown of Castile were handed a crushing blow at the Battle of Villalar on 23 April 1521.

In the Early Modern Period, the city lost its political and economic relevance and suffered emigration, especially to South America (where many other cities called Zamora were founded).

According to the Godoy Census, the city had a population of 10,171 in 1797.

During the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), the savagery of the repression against leftists and liberals is captured in Ramón Sender Barayón&#x27;s &#x27;A Death in Zamora&#x27;, which tells of the extrajudicial murder of his mother, Amparo Barayon, the wife of the famous novelist Ramon Sender.

<text>The Atlantic City Expressway, officially numbered, but unsigned, as Route 446 and abbreviated A.C. Expressway, ACE, or ACX, and known locally as the Expressway, is a controlled-access toll road in the U.S. state of New Jersey, managed and operated by the South Jersey Transportation Authority. It runs from Route 42 from Turnersville southeast to Atlantic City. The Atlantic City Expressway is signed as east–west, though the mileage and exits decrease as if one is travelling north–south. It connects Philadelphia and the surrounding Philadelphia metro area with Atlantic City and other Jersey Shore resorts, and also serves other South Jersey communities, including Hammonton and Mays Landing. The expressway intersects many major roads, including Route 73 in Winslow Township, Route 54 in Hammonton, Route 50 in Hamilton Township, the Garden State Parkway in Egg Harbor Township, US 9 in Pleasantville, and the Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector near the eastern terminus in Atlantic City.

The Atlantic City Expressway uses a barrier toll system, with two mainline toll plazas (Egg Harbor in Hamilton Township and Pleasantville) and ramp tolls at seven interchanges. Tolls can be paid using cash or the E-ZPass electronic toll collection system. The total cost to travel the length of the Atlantic City Expressway for passenger vehicles is currently $5.90. The expressway features one service plaza, the Frank S. Farley Service Plaza, in Hamilton Township a short distance west of the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza, as well as a gas station and mini-mart in Pleasantville.

Plans for the highway began in the 1930s when a parkway was proposed between Camden and Atlantic City that was never built. Plans resurfaced for the road in the 1950s when a group of officials led by State Senator Frank S. Farley pushed for a road to help the area economy. The New Jersey Expressway Authority was created in 1962, tasked with building an expressway. The Atlantic City Expressway was built between 1962 and 1965 at a total cost of $48.2 million. The South Jersey Transportation Authority assumed control of the road in 1991 from the New Jersey Expressway Authority.

==Route description==
The Atlantic City Expressway begins at an interchange with Route 42 in Turnersville in Washington Township, Gloucester County, where the freeway right-of-way continues north as the North–South Freeway, a part of Route 42. Here, Route 42 continues south on the Black Horse Pike and Route 168 continues north on the Black Horse Pike. A westbound exit provides a connection to County House Road (CR 705) and northbound Route 168. The expressway then heads southeast as a four-lane road, straddling between Washington Township and Gloucester Township, Camden County. On the border between Gloucester Township and Winslow Township, the Atlantic City Expressway features a diamond interchange with Berlin-Cross Keys Road (CR 689). Past this interchange, there is a diamond interchange with Williamstown Road (CR 536 Spur). The expressway passes under Malaga Road (CR 536) and then features a partial interchange with Fleming Pike (CR 723), with an eastbound exit and a westbound entrance. It meets Route 73 at another partial interchange, with a westbound exit and an eastbound entrance, where the roadway widens to six lanes. Past this interchange, the highway passes over the Southern Railroad of New Jersey&#x27;s Southern Running Track line.
The expressway crosses into Hammonton in Atlantic County. Continuing to the southeast, it passes over the Beesleys Point Secondary railroad line operated by the Cape May Seashore Lines railroad before it encounters Route 54 at a partial cloverleaf interchange. It enters Hamilton Township and passes under Weymouth Road (CR 559). The lanes of the Atlantic City Expressway in both directions split for the Frank S. Farley Service Plaza, which is located in the median of the expressway and accessible from both directions. Named for New Jersey State Senator Frank S. Farley and run by Applegreen, it has a building containing multiple fast-food restaurants, a Sunoco gas station, a mini-mart and gift shop with New Jersey Lottery sales, a seasonal farm market, an ATM, tourist information, and an electric vehicle charging station. The service plaza is also the site of the South Jersey Transportation Authority administrative offices and a New Jersey State Police barracks. Past the service plaza, the Atlantic City Expressway meets the mainline Egg Harbor Toll Plaza. It then features a partial cloverleaf interchange with Route 50, with the westbound exit and eastbound entrance being E-ZPass only. It meets Leipzig Avenue (CR 670), with another partial interchange featuring an eastbound off-ramp and a westbound on-ramp. Next, it has an eastbound exit and westbound entrance for Wrangleboro Road (CR 575), which provides access to Black Horse Pike (US 40/US 322) and the Hamilton Mall near Mays Landing. To and from the east, a ramp runs from the Atlantic City Expressway to the US 40/US 322 split.

The expressway then enters Egg Harbor Township. It has an interchange with Delilah Road (CR 646), which provides access to the Atlantic City International Airport, and passes under Tilton Road (CR 563). It features a cloverleaf interchange with the Garden State Parkway and crosses into Pleasantville. In Pleasantville, the expressway meets US 9 at a diamond interchange. It passes under Main Street (CR 585) and features a partial interchange with Franklin Boulevard, with a westbound exit and eastbound entrance.
The expressway then continues to the Pleasantville Toll Plaza. Past the toll plaza, the travel lanes separate and a park and ride lot, used by Atlantic City casino employees, lies within the median of the expressway. It then encounters the former Atlantic City Visitor Welcome Center and a Sunoco gas station/7-Eleven mini-mart in the median before it enters the city of Atlantic City. Upon entering Atlantic City, the expressway passes under the Southern Railroad of New Jersey&#x27;s Pleasantville Industrial Track line and features an eastbound exit and westbound entrance with US 40/US 322. It then continues southeast, crossing the Beach Thorofare, and soon after encounters an eastbound exit and westbound entrance for the Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector, which provides access to the Atlantic City Convention Center, the Marina district, and Brigantine. The Atlantic City Expressway ends at a traffic light at the intersection with Baltic Avenue/Fairmount Avenue near Tanger Outlets Atlantic City, where the road becomes the one-way pair of Missouri Avenue eastbound (also known as Christopher Columbus Boulevard) and Arkansas Avenue westbound.

In 2019, the Atlantic City Expressway counted over 54 million toll-paying vehicles. The speed limit on the Atlantic City Expressway is for most of the route. The Emergency Services Patrol provides motorist assistance along the expressway. Motorists needing assistance can dial #ACE or 609-965-7200 on their mobile phones. The entire length of the highway is part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==Tolls==

The Atlantic City Expressway uses a barrier toll system, with mainline toll plazas and ramp tolls. As of January 1, 2024, all passenger vehicles currently must pay a $4.70 toll at the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza, which is located east of the Farley Service Plaza at milepost 17.5, and a $1.40 toll near Pleasantville. Both mainline toll plazas have Express E-ZPass lanes through the center of the plaza. Tolls are also collected at seven entrances and exits. A $1.40 toll for cars is charged at the eastbound exits and westbound entrances at exits 5, 28, and 33, the westbound exit and eastbound entrance at exit 12, and all ramps at exit 9; in addition, a $0.75 toll for cars is charged at the eastbound exits and westbound entrances at exits 38 and 41.

Every year since 2013, with the exception of 2020 and 2021, eastbound tolls are waived at the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza for one hour in the late afternoon on the Friday before Memorial Day to promote the unofficial beginning of the summer tourist season at the Jersey Shore. Chickie&#x27;s &amp; Pete&#x27;s, a local sports bar chain, pays for the tolls collected during this hour. In October 2014, eastbound tolls were waived at the Egg Harbor and Pleasantville toll plazas on Tuesdays between noon and midnight to encourage midweek tourism to Atlantic City.

==History==

The road was planned as a parkway in 1932, running from the Ben Franklin Bridge in Camden southeast to Atlantic City, but it never materialized. The idea for a limited-access road between the Philadelphia area and Atlantic City resurfaced in the 1950s when South Jersey officials, led by State Senator Frank S. Farley, pushed for an expressway between the two areas to help the economy of Southern New Jersey. The New Jersey State Highway Department authorized traffic studies for a toll road between Turnersville and Atlantic City in 1958 and 1959, and the New Jersey Expressway Authority Act in 1962 called for a five-member agency (the New Jersey Expressway Authority) with representatives from four Southern New Jersey counties to be responsible for issuing bonds to build and maintain the Atlantic City Expressway.

Construction of the Atlantic City Expressway started in the middle of 1962. The design was to feature a 300- to 400-foot-wide roadway with 12-foot-wide travel lanes and right shoulders as well as 3-foot-wide left shoulders. The part between Route 42 in Turnersville and the Garden State Parkway in Egg Harbor Township was completed on July 31, 1964, and the part between the Garden State Parkway and Atlantic City was finished in July 1965. Construction of the Atlantic City Expressway cost a total of $48.2 million. With the completion of the road, it was anticipated that it would increase tourism to Atlantic City. However, the opening of the expressway did not initially increase tourism to Atlantic City, and toll projections were below expectations. The opening of the Atlantic City Expressway, along with the connecting Garden State Parkway, provided a shorter route to Jersey Shore resort towns in Cape May County and Long Beach Island; travel times to Cape May County were reduced by 30 to 45 minutes. Prior to the completion of the expressway, traffic had to use Black Horse Pike or White Horse Pike to reach the Jersey Shore. With the legalization of casino gambling in Atlantic City in 1978, traffic along the Atlantic City Expressway increased. The construction of the expressway also led to development near the interchange serving Mays Landing, including the Hamilton Mall.
Tolls on the Atlantic City Expressway initially cost $0.75 at the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza and $0.15 at the Pleasantville Toll Plaza. In 1969, tolls increased to $1.00 at the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza and to $0.25 at the Pleasantville Toll Plaza.

In April 1977, whats now the service area was renamed in honor of Frank S Farley, who died shortly after.

In the late 1980s, a third eastbound lane was added between the interchange with Route 73 and the Pleasantville Toll Plaza, while the number of lanes was increased at both the Egg Harbor and Pleasantville toll plazas.

In 1991, the SJTA was created by the New Jersey Legislature to operate the Atlantic City Expressway, the Atlantic City International Airport, and operations of the Atlantic County Transportation Authority.

On November 11, 1998, the Atlantic City Expressway started accepting E-ZPass for the payment of tolls; the expressway was the first toll road in New Jersey to use the electronic toll collection system. Tolls along the expressway increased on November 30, 1998, in order to fund a capital improvements plan, with the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza increasing to $2.00.

In 2000, the Atlantic City Visitor Welcome Center opened in the median of the expressway near Atlantic City. Construction of the welcome center cost $3.5 million. The welcome center offered amenities including tourist information, T-shirts, restrooms, and E-ZPass sales. THat same year, a new interchange with Berlin-Cross Keys Road (CR 689) on the border of Gloucester Township and Winslow Township was completed for $5 million. The completion of this interchange led to the increase of adjacent retail development.

The Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector was completed on July 31, 2001, to connect the Atlantic City Expressway to the Marina District and Brigantine.

Exit 5 was built into a full interchange as part of a project completed in 2002.

Traffic along the expressway peaked in 2008 with over 66.9 million vehicles; however, traffic volumes started to decline as Atlantic City was affected by the Great Recession and increased competition following the legalization of casino gambling in Pennsylvania. Tolls along the Atlantic City Expressway increased in 2009, with the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza toll increasing to $3.00.
On November 21, 2008, work began on the reconstruction of exit 17, with completion on June 18, 2010. As a result of reconstructing this interchange, the SJTA approved raising the interchange toll to $3.00. This new rate is charged to motorists heading to or from the east along the Atlantic City Expressway at Route 50. The proposal drew opposition from area officials who felt the proposed rate was too high. The westbound exit and eastbound entrance at exit 17 were designed to be E-ZPass only, the first such interchange on the Atlantic City Expressway.

In 2007, it was announced that the Atlantic City Expressway from milepost 7.0–31.0 would be widened in the westbound direction to accommodate a third lane from north of the Garden State Parkway to Route 73. exit 17 (Route 50) would be reconstructed to form a full movement interchange (completed June 18, 2010), and the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza would receive Express E-ZPass lanes to allow traffic to maintain highway speed. Construction on these three projects was financed by a $25 million bond. The first phase was completed in the middle of 2010 and the Express E-ZPass was completed in May 2011. The work under the widening project also included improvements to bridges, lighting, and guide signs. Also, intelligent transportation system technology, such as traffic cameras and variable-message signs, were added to the Atlantic City Expressway to enhance safety and aid in monitoring traffic. The first phase widened the road from the Garden State Parkway to the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza. The second phase widened the road from the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza to milepost 24.5. The third phase widened the road west to Route 73. The ITS components were installed along these sections of the roadway through the course of each phase. The widening work was completed in May 2014 and the third lane opened in its entirety by Memorial Day 2014. The fourth phase added ITS technology to the parts of the road that are not being widened.

The Atlantic City Visitor Welcome Center closed on May 1, 2019, due to a lack of visitors.

On March 24, 2020, the South Jersey Transportation Authority suspended cash tolls along the Atlantic City Expressway due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with all tolls collected either electronically or by using coins in exact change lanes. Collection of cash tolls along the expressway resumed on May 19, 2020. On September 13, 2020, tolls at the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza increased from $3.00 to $4.25 and the $0.75 tolls at the Pleasantville Toll Plaza and several interchanges increased to $1.25. On January 1, 2022, tolls along the Atlantic City Expressway increased 3 percent, with the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza increasing to $4.40 and the Pleasantville Toll Plaza and several interchanges increasing to $1.30. Another toll hike occurred on January 1, 2023, which increased tolls to $4.55 at the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza and to $1.35 at the Pleasantville Toll Plaza and several interchanges. On January 1, 2024, tolls increased to $4.70 at the Egg Harbor Toll Plaza and to $1.40 at the Pleasantville Toll Plaza and several interchanges.

==Future==

The SJTA revealed plans for a major road improvement project that would link the Atlantic City International Airport to the Atlantic City Expressway, with construction beginning as early as 2013. The plan includes new ramps with two overpasses over the expressway. The road would connect Amelia Earhart Boulevard with an overpass above Airport Circle. Plans also call for building a service road with another overpass that would provide access to Delilah Road. Another project involves the installation of an overpass at the end of Amelia Earhart Boulevard next to the entrance to the FAA Tech Center. The proposed roadway would intrude upon a small section of a mobile home park and land owned by Egg Harbor Township. In 2020, the interchange&#x27;s cost was projected at $60 million.

The 2019 Statewide Transportation Improvement Plan included a project that would add a flyover ramp from the Garden State Parkway northbound to the Atlantic City Expressway westbound. Construction was estimated to cost $20 million.

In April 2020, as part of a plan to raise tolls by 37% on the Atlantic City Expressway, the South Jersey Transportation Authority announced a $150 million plan to widen the expressway to three lanes in each direction from exit 31 to the western terminus with Route 42. The project would also replace the current tolling system with an all-electronic tolling system using E-ZPass or toll-by-plate, a tolling system which mails an invoice to license plates without E-ZPass. In 2022, a request for bids was issued to implement all-electronic tolling along the Atlantic City Expressway, which would serve as a pilot program for all-electronic tolling on toll roads in New Jersey. Groundbreaking for the all-electronic toll system took place on October 30, 2023. The system is planned to be implemented along the roadway by May 2025. The widening of the Atlantic City Expressway to six lanes between exit 31 and the western terminus, which will build new bridges and reconstruct the interchange with Route 42, is expected to begin in 2024 with completion in 2025.

<doc id="262326" wikidata="Q645435" url="?curid=262326" title="Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)">
<text>Heartbreaker is the debut solo studio album by American singer-songwriter Ryan Adams, released on September 5, 2000, by Bloodshot Records. The album was recorded over fourteen days at Woodland Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. It was nominated for the 2001 Shortlist Music Prize. The album is said to be inspired by Adams&#x27; break-up with music industry publicist Amy Lombardi.

According to Adams, the album&#x27;s title originates from a poster of Mariah Carey: &quot;My manager called and said, &#x27;You have 15 seconds to name this record,&#x27; &quot;My eyes focused on this poster of Mariah wearing a T-shirt that said &quot;HEARTBREAKER&quot;. I just shouted, &#x27;Heartbreaker!&#x27;&quot;

A Deluxe Edition, featuring bonus recording session takes and pre-album demos, was released on May 6, 2016 on PAX-AM records.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Heartbreaker&quot; was considered by critics to be a fresh start for Ryan Adams after the demise of his previous band Whiskeytown. AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Derning wrote that the album &quot;is loose, open, and heartfelt in a way Whiskeytown&#x27;s admittedly fine albums never were, and makes as strong a case for Adams&#x27; gifts as anything his band ever released&quot;, concluding that &quot;the strength of the material and the performances suggest Adams is finally gaining some much-needed maturity, and his music is all the better for it.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Keith Phipps wrote: &quot;Adams has recorded an intimate, largely quiet record that indisputably establishes his identity as an independent singer-songwriter&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Steven Byrd called it &quot;an album of astonishing musical proficiency, complete honesty and severe beauty.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Anthony DeCurtis was less enthusiastic, stating that Adams&#x27; songs &quot;too often fail to rise above their plain-spoken details to take on the symbolic power he yearns for&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; selected &quot;To Be Young (Is to Be Sad, Is to Be High)&quot; as a &quot;choice cut&quot;, indicating a &quot;good song on an album that isn&#x27;t worth your time or money.&quot;

The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; and was placed at #23 on Paste Magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 50 Best Albums of the Decade&quot; list.

The tour, according to a press release, &quot;is set to offer up an intimate, acoustic set that highlights his massive career.&quot; The tour began in Australia on October 4, 2024 and will run until November 27, 2024 on New York. It will resume in March 2025 in Norway and will conclude on June 28, 2025 in Charles Town, WV.

==Other information==
&quot;Shakedown on 9th Street&quot; was covered on the Red Dirt band No Justice&#x27;s Live at Billy Bob&#x27;s album in 2007.

&quot;Oh My Sweet Carolina&quot; has been covered at least twice. The song can be heard on the deluxe edition of Zac Brown Band&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;You Get What You Give&quot;, as well as on the 2008 Portastatic release &quot;Some Small History&quot;. Contestant Paul McDonald sang &quot;Come Pick Me Up&quot; on American Idol.

English DJ Mark Ronson remixed the song &quot;Amy&quot; for his 2007 album &quot;Version&quot;, of which singer Kenna provides vocals. The song &quot;To Be Young (Is To Be Sad, Is To Be High)&quot; is featured in the 2006 film &quot;Accepted&quot;, the 2002 film &quot;The Slaughter Rule&quot;, and the 2003 film &quot;Old School&quot;. A version of this song was also released in 2009 by David Rawlings on the Dave Rawlings Machine album &quot;A Friend of a Friend&quot;. &quot;Come Pick Me Up&quot; is featured in the film &quot;Elizabethtown&quot; (which also featured two other Ryan Adams songs) and in a Series 2 episode of &quot;Skins&quot;. It was also named #285 on Pitchfork Media&#x27;s &quot;Top 500 songs of the 2000s&quot;. Joan Baez would cover &quot;In My Time of Need&quot; in 2003.

Elton John has famously credited the &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; album as helping to regenerate his career and in 2002 he performed songs from it with Ryan Adams and did a joint interview with him where he thanked Ryan.

<doc id="262327" wikidata="Q916453" url="?curid=262327" title="Gold (Ryan Adams album)">
<text>Gold is the second studio album by American musician Ryan Adams. It was released September 25, 2001, by Lost Highway Records. The album remains Adams&#x27; best-selling album, certifying gold in the UK and going on to sell 364,000 copies in the U.S. and 812,000 worldwide. Adams noted that &quot;with &quot;Gold&quot;, I was trying to prove something to myself. I wanted to invent a modern classic.&quot;

Adams intended for the album to be a double album, but his record label, Lost Highway, condensed the album into a single disc. According to Adams, the label &quot;took the last five songs, made it a bonus disc and put it on the first hundred and fifty thousand copies. Fucking my fans over and making them pay extra for a record I wanted to be a double album. They counted that as one record.&quot; This bonus disc is known as &quot;Side Four&quot;; the disc&#x27;s title reflects the fact that the bonus material makes up the fourth side of the double LP edition of the album.

The album includes &quot;When the Stars Go Blue&quot;, which has been covered by artists such as The Corrs and Bono, Tyler Hilton, Bethany Joy Galeotti, Tim McGraw and as a duo by Kurt Nilsen featuring Venke Knutson. &quot;New York, New York&quot; became a notable MTV and VH1 favorite following the September 11 attacks. &quot;The Rescue Blues&quot; was featured in the end credits of the 2001 film &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot;.

Adams&#x27; friend and former roommate Adam Duritz (lead singer of Counting Crows) lends background vocals to several tracks.

Adams received three Grammy Award nominations in 2002: Best Rock Album, Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for &quot;New York, New York&quot;, and Best Male Country Vocal Performance for &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot;, a song recorded for the Hank Williams tribute album, &quot;Timeless&quot;.

Stephen King&#x27;s 2006 book &quot;Lisey&#x27;s Story&quot; includes part of the lyrics to &quot;When the Stars Go Blue&quot;. Also, the song &quot;The Rescue Blues&quot; was featured in an episode of &quot;Scrubs&quot;. In 2011, &quot;Answering Bell&quot; was featured in the film and on the soundtrack to &quot;Bridesmaids&quot;. &quot;La Cienega Just Smiled&quot; was featured in the &quot;Angel&quot; episode &quot;Unleashed&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Q&quot; listed &quot;Gold&quot; as one of the best 50 albums of 2001.
&quot;Kludge&quot; included it on their list of the 25 best albums of 2001.
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Gold&quot; the 81st best record of the 2000s. &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Gold&quot; at number 193 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

<doc id="262328" wikidata="Q25047378" url="?curid=262328" title="Supreme command of the armed forces in the People's Republic of China">
<text>In the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), supreme command of the armed forces is exercised by the Central Military Commission (CMC) of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). A parallel state CMC (PRC CMC) exists. Legally the two CMCs have separate responsibilities, but the distinction is practically irrelevant because the bodies typically have the same members. Since the 2000s, the CCP General Secretary chairs the CMC, and represents the armed forces in the Politburo Standing Committee, the country&#x27;s ruling body.

==History==
When the PRC was founded in 1949, command of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) was transferred to the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Military Council, a state body, with the CCP leading the coalition government. The CCP CMC was abolished. The 1954 PRC constitution designated the president as the supreme commander, and also as the chair of the National Defense Council (NDC). At the same time, the CCP CMC was reestablished and became the primary policy-making body for the armed forces. The separation of command and policy-making between the state and the party was bridged by the shared memberships of the state and party bodies; for example, Mao Zedong was president and CMC chairman. In the late-1970s and the end of the Cultural Revolution, revisions to the PRC and CCP constitutions made the CCP chairman the supreme commander.

Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s political reforms again divided responsibilities for the armed forces between the party and the state. The 1982 PRC constitution created the PRC CMC to formally exercise supreme command, with the National People&#x27;s Congress selecting the chairman, and handle all matters except political work. The CCP CMC — as defined in the 1982 CCP constitution — was responsible for political work. Again, conflicts between the CMCs were eliminated by shared membership.

The relationship between the CMCs and various state and party bodies can make the exercise of supreme command legally ambiguous. The ambiguity may have caused the CCP&#x27;s regular demands for loyalty from the armed forces since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre.

<text>Demolition is the third studio album by alt-country singer-songwriter Ryan Adams, released on September 24, 2002, on Lost Highway. The album comprises tracks from Adams&#x27; unreleased studio albums, &quot;The Suicide Handbook&quot;, &quot;The Pinkheart Sessions&quot; and &quot;48 Hours&quot;, as well as &quot;You Will Always Be The Same&quot; from &quot;The Stockholm Sessions&quot;. In 2009, Adams stated: &quot;I don’t much care for this record. The rock songs are plodding and the quiet songs belonged to better records [...] to make &quot;Gold&quot; as a compromise then to have to watch those records get broken up for &quot;Demolition&quot; was heartbreaking.&quot;

<text>David Edward Kelley (born April 4, 1956) is an American television writer, producer, and former attorney. He has created and/or produced a number of television series including &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Picket Fences&quot;, &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;, &quot;The Practice&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, &quot;Boston Public&quot;, &quot;Goliath&quot;, &quot;Big Little Lies&quot;, and &quot;Big Sky&quot;. Kelley is one of very few screenwriters to have created shows that have aired on all four top commercial American television networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC) as well as cable giant HBO.

==Early life==
David Edward Kelley was born on April 4, 1956 in Waterville, Maine, raised in Belmont, Massachusetts, and attended the Belmont Hill School. His father is Jack Kelley, a member of the United States Ice Hockey Hall of Fame. Kelley was a stick boy for the New England Whalers of the World Hockey Association in their inaugural season of 1972–1973 when his father coached the team. Kelley was captain of the Princeton Tigers men&#x27;s ice hockey team at Princeton University, where he graduated in 1979 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science.

Demonstrating early on a creative and quirky bent, in his junior year at Princeton, Kelley submitted a paper for a political science class about John F. Kennedy&#x27;s plot to kill Fidel Castro, written as a poem. For his senior thesis, he turned the Bill of Rights into a play. &quot;I made each amendment into a character&quot;, he said. &quot;The First Amendment is a loudmouth guy who won&#x27;t shut up. The Second Amendment guy, all he wanted to talk about was his gun collection. Then the 10th Amendment, the one where they say leave the rest for the states to decide, he was a guy with no self-esteem.&quot; Also while at Princeton, he was a member of the Princeton Triangle Club.

Kelley received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from Boston University School of Law, where he wrote for the Legal Follies, a sketch comedy group composed of Boston University law students which still holds annual performances. He began working for a Boston law firm, mostly dealing with real estate and minor criminal cases.

In 1983, while considering it only a hobby, Kelley began writing a screenplay, a legal thriller, which was optioned in 1986 and later became the Judd Nelson feature film &quot;From the Hip&quot; in 1987.

==Television work==

===&quot;L.A. Law&quot; (1986–1994)===

In 1986, Steven Bochco was searching for writers with a law background for his new NBC legal series, &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. His agent sent him Kelley&#x27;s movie script for &quot;From the Hip&quot;. Enthusiastic, Bochco made him a writer and story editor for the show. During this first year, Kelley kept his law office in Boston as a hedge. However, his involvement in the show only expanded. In the second year, he became executive story editor and co-producer. Finally, in 1989, Bochco stepped away from the series, making Kelley the executive producer. While executive producer, Kelley received two Emmys for Outstanding Writing in a Dramatic Series and the show received the award for Outstanding Drama Series for both years. For the first five seasons that he was involved with the show, he wrote or co-wrote two out of three episodes. Kelley left after the fifth season in 1991 and ratings began to fall. As &quot;Newsday&quot;&#x27;s TV critic wrote, &quot;The difference between good and bad &quot;L.A. Law&quot; ... was David Kelley.&quot; Midway through the sixth season, both Bochco and Kelley were brought in as creative consultants after the show received bad press about its decline in quality.
===&quot;Picket Fences&quot; (1992–1996)===

In 1992, after co-creating &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot; with his mentor Steven Bochco, Kelley formed his own production company, David E. Kelley Productions, making a three-series deal with CBS. Its first creation, &quot;Picket Fences&quot;, airing in 1992 and influenced by &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, focused on the police department in the fictional quirky town of Rome, Wisconsin. Kelley wrote most of the episodes for the first three years. The show was critically acclaimed but never found a sizable audience. &quot;Picket Fences&quot; went on for four years, receiving a total of 14 Emmy awards including consecutive Emmys for Outstanding Drama Series for its first and second seasons.

In 1995, the fourth and final season, Kelley wrote only two episodes. &quot;We had almost 10 writers try to come in and take over for this one man&quot;, said &quot;Picket Fences&quot; actress Holly Marie Combs. &quot;The quality was not nearly what it was.&quot;
===&quot;Chicago Hope&quot; (1994–2000)===

Under pressure from CBS to develop a second series even though he didn&#x27;t feel ready to produce two shows simultaneously, Kelley launched the medical drama &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;, starring Mandy Patinkin and Adam Arkin, which premiered in 1994. Airing at the same time as the season&#x27;s other new medical drama, NBC&#x27;s &quot;ER&quot;, the ultimate ratings leader, &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; plotted &quot;upscale medicine in a high-tech world run by high-priced doctors&quot;. During its six-year run, it won seven Emmys and generally high critical praise, but only middling ratings.

Originally intending to write only the first several episodes in order to return full-time to &quot;Picket Fences&quot;, Kelley eventually wrote most of the material for both shows, a total of roughly 40 scripts. Expressing a desire to focus more on his production company and upcoming projects, Kelley ceased day-to-day involvement with both series in 1995, allowing others to write and produce. Towards the end of the fifth season in 1999, facing cancellation, Kelley fired most of the cast members added since he had left the show, brought back Mandy Patinkin and began writing episodes again.
===&quot;The Practice&quot; (1997–2004)===

In 1995, Kelley entered into a five-year deal with 20th Century Fox Television to produce shows for both the ABC and FOX television networks, each agreeing to take two series. If one network passed on a project, the other got first refusal. Kelley retained full creative control. &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; on FOX and &quot;The Practice&quot; on ABC were the first two projects to come from this deal.

Premiering as a midseason replacement for the 1996–1997 season, &quot;The Practice&quot; was Kelley&#x27;s chance to write another courtroom drama but one focusing on the less-glamorous realities of a small law firm. &quot;The Practice&quot; would be the first of four successful series by Kelley that were set in Boston, proximal to his hometown of Belmont, Massachusetts. Receiving critical applause (along with two Emmys for Outstanding Drama Series) but low ratings in its starting seasons, it eventually became a popular top 10 program. The New York Times described the show as &quot;the profoundly realistic, unending battle between soul-searching and ambition&quot;. Full-time writers on the first season of &quot;The Practice&quot; included David Shore, later the creator of &quot;House&quot;, Stephen Gaghan, a future Oscar winner for &quot;Traffic&quot;, Michael R. Perry, the creator of the 2011–12 series &quot;The River&quot;, and Ed Redlich, co-creator of the 2011–12 series &quot;Unforgettable&quot;. Later the writing staff would grow to 10, most with law degrees. By the fifth season, he would usually only edit the final script and was generally not on the set during filming.

In 2003, due to sagging ratings, ABC cut Kelley&#x27;s budget in half for the eighth and final season. He responded by firing most of the cast and hiring James Spader for the role of Alan Shore, whom &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;a lecherous, twisted antitrust lawyer with a breezy disregard for ethics.&quot; The final episodes of &quot;The Practice&quot; were focused on introducing the new characters from his next show, &quot;Boston Legal&quot;.
===&quot;Ally McBeal&quot; (1997–2002)===

When &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; premiered in 1997 on FOX, Kelley was also shepherding his other two shows, &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; and &quot;The Practice,&quot; although he was not actively participating in &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; at the time. The title character Ally is a young, attractive, impulsive, Harvard-educated lawyer described by a &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist as &quot;stylish, sexy, smart, opinionated, and an emotional wreck.&quot; In contrast to &quot;The Practice&quot; and its idealistic lawyers, the law firm in &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; was founded only to make money.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that the show uniquely emphasised &quot;character and caricature&quot;. The show lasted five seasons, seven Emmys (one for Outstanding Comedy Series for its second season), mostly positive reviews and a barrage of criticism for its portrayal of women, with many journalists saying that the character Ally was a giant step backwards.

Parallel to &quot;The Practice&quot;, Kelley penned all the scripts for the first season, then brought in other writers in subsequent years, although he continued to write many episodes himself.
====Portrayal of the Ally McBeal character====
When the program &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; first ran, many women lauded its portrayal of the lead character. Sharon Waxman, writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, commented that Kelley had a keen insight into the human nature of both men and women. She quoted Dyan Cannon: &quot;This man understands the way a woman thinks, ... the complex ways we&#x27;ve found to hide our fears.&quot; A &quot;New York Times&quot; writer used the character as an example of a strong television woman&#x27;s role, another saw herself, at times, in the character&#x27;s portrayal of self-absorption and reflection, her crafted neuroses, her vulnerabilities.

Later, however, much press coverage was spent on the controversial nature of women in &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; featured a cover story about the decline of feminism with a picture of Ally (among a pantheon of feminist heroines) on the cover. In the article, Ginia Bellafante used the McBeal character as a modern exemplar proving that &quot;[M]uch of feminism has devolved into the silly.&quot; In response, author Erica Jong felt that the &quot;Time&quot; journalist diminished her argument by using only pop-cultural references and ignoring the majority of real-world women who have made significant progress.

Writing in Salon.com, Joyce Millman disputed that &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; should even be described as a &quot;women&#x27;s show&quot;—that its representations of women were, in fact, a male fantasy. She felt that Kelley treated his female characters &quot;sadistically&quot; in general, beginning all the way back to &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, saving only &quot;The Practice&quot; for positive remarks.

Kelley&#x27;s &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; was hugely successful in attracting the 18-to-34-year-old women audience demographic. &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist, Maureen Dowd, quoted two young, professional women saying they liked shows with female characters like themselves, single, even obsessed. Dowd quoted the executive producer of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, Dick Wolf, &quot;I think there is a wish-fulfillment factor when you put an attractive woman in a situation where she is doing real, adult stuff.&quot;

===&quot;Boston Public&quot; (2000–2004)===
In 2000, 20th Century Fox Television extended its arrangement with Kelley. The deal, which ran for six years, reportedly made Kelley the highest-paid producer in TV history—up to $40 million a year—in return for a first-look at his projects.

Premiering on FOX in 2000, &quot;Boston Public&quot;, which follows the lives of teachers and administrators at a Boston inner-city high school, joined &quot;The Practice&quot; and &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; for the season, meaning Kelley was responsible for writing or overseeing 67 episodes.

The program was initially considered a modest hit but received less than glowing reviews. The previous season, Kelley stumbled with both the short-lived &quot;Snoops&quot;, his first attempt at delegating most of the responsibilities to others, and with &quot;Ally&quot;, the experiment with 30-minute shortened episodes of &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. The TV critic from the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; opined that these failures and the weaknesses he saw in &quot;Boston Public&quot; were a sign that Kelley had lost the Midas touch. The show lasted four seasons, garnering one minor Emmy.
===&quot;Boston Legal&quot; (2004–2008)===
In addition to &quot;Snoops&quot;, Kelley continued to have a string of unsuccessful series: &quot;Girls Club&quot; in 2002, &quot;The Brotherhood of Poland, New Hampshire&quot; in 2003 and the reality show &quot;The Law Firm&quot; in 2005. All the while, he continued overseeing &quot;Boston Public&quot; and &quot;The Practice&quot;.

&quot;Boston Legal&quot; on ABC, premiering in 2004, gave continuity and success to the Kelley franchise. It was a spin-off of his long-running legal drama &quot;The Practice&quot;, and followed attorney Alan Shore (a character who became the star of &quot;The Practice&quot; in its final season, played by James Spader) to his new law firm, Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt. It also starred veteran television actors Candice Bergen and William Shatner. Critically popular with less than spectacular ratings (ranked 27th for the first season, 46th for the second), the show was an &quot;Emmy darling&quot; during its run, winning seven times and being nominated over 25 times. The show won the Peabody Award in 2005 for its signature political commentaries.
In 2007, &quot;Boston Legal&quot; began to see a rise of viewership as a result of its following ABC&#x27;s popular &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; series, mostly ranking either first or second most-watched program of the evening in its ten o&#x27;clock time period, beating out CBS and NBC&#x27;s shows.

The fifth and final season began in 2008 with Kelley writing most of the episodes. The season only aired thirteen episodes, making a series run of 101 episodes. The two-hour series finale drew 11 million viewers. Still, the show drew over 15 million viewers much of its first season—and Kelley felt ABC&#x27;s treatment of the show over the years ultimately killed it, saying to &quot;TV Guide&quot; that ABC always treated the show like its &quot;bastard child&quot;. &quot;Boston Legal&quot; aired on four different nights (Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Monday) in its five-season run, with the ratings slipping after each move. In the second-to-last episode of the series, Kelley blatantly wrote a show questioning the legitimacy of the Nielsen ratings and the network&#x27;s treatment of the show by including a plot about a lawsuit against an unnamed television network.

In 2007, Kelley received the Justice in the Arts Award from Death Penalty Focus, an organization dedicated to the abolition of the death penalty. He previously received an award from this organization in 2000 for his work on the show &quot;The Practice&quot;.

=== 2007–present ===
Kelley&#x27;s &quot;The Wedding Bells&quot; premiered in fall 2007 and was canceled after seven episodes. Additionally, Kelley worked on an Americanized version of the BBC show &quot;Life on Mars&quot; for the 2007–2008 season on ABC and also worked on an adaptation of Joseph Wambaugh&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood Station&quot;. He later handed production to another creative crew.

In May 2008, Kelley signed a deal with Warner Bros. Television and later penned a spec script for another legal drama entitled &quot;Legally Mad&quot; in a comic vein. NBC ultimately rejected the series. NBC would pay a two million dollar penalty to Warner Bros. for Kelley&#x27;s scripts. Kelley was the creator and executive producer of &quot;Harry&#x27;s Law&quot;, which premiered on NBC on January 17, 2011. The series starred Kathy Bates in the titular role. The show was cancelled in 2012 even though it was the network&#x27;s second most-watched drama, because its audience skewed too old as the more desirable 18–49 demographic viewership was very low.

In 2011, Kelley wrote a script for the pilot episode of a new &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; TV series for Warner Bros. Television, but the pilot was rejected by NBC for its fall 2011 lineup.

A new medical series, &quot;Monday Mornings&quot;, co-created with Sanjay Gupta, premiered February 2013 on TNT, the cable television channel owned by Time Warner. Set in Portland, Oregon, the show stars Ving Rhames, Alfred Molina and Jamie Bamber. In May 2013, the show was canceled by TNT.

A new comedy series created by Kelley, &quot;The Crazy Ones&quot;, starring Robin Williams and Sarah Michelle Gellar, premiered on CBS on September 26, 2013. The show was cancelled after a season due to lukewarm reception.

In 2015, Kelley created the Amazon Studios series &quot;Goliath&quot;.

In 2017, Kelley spearheaded a new HBO series, &quot;Big Little Lies&quot;, which won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series. He was also a showrunner on the TV adaptation of the Stephen King novel &quot;Mr. Mercedes&quot;.

In March 2018, it was announced that HBO had given a series order for &quot;The Undoing&quot;, a miniseries based on the 2014 novel &quot;You Should Have Known&quot; by Jean Hanff Korelitz. The series was written by Kelley, who also served as executive producer with Nicole Kidman (who starred alongside Hugh Grant and Donald Sutherland), Per Saari, and Bruna Papandrea. Susanne Bier directed the miniseries. It premiered in October 2020, and was the most-watched show on HBO that year.

In June 2019, Kelley wrote a script for a CBS crime drama series, &quot;The Lincoln Lawyer&quot;, based from the 2005 novel of the same name by Michael Connelly. On May 2, 2020, CBS announced that the pilot would not be moving forward. However, on January 11, 2021, the series was picked up by Netflix.

Kelley was announced as the writer and showrunner on the ABC crime drama series &quot;Big Sky&quot;, based on the book &quot;The Highway&quot; by C. J. Box.

Kelley served as writer, executive producer and showrunner on &quot;The Calling&quot;, an American adaptation of Israeli television series &quot;Missing File&quot; on Peacock.

==Methods==

===Writing===
Kelley writes his first drafts longhand using a Bic ballpoint and yellow legal pad. He typically writes scripts in two to four days, initially working without collaboration, finding it faster and easier than trying to explain what he wants to others.

Kelley has been criticised for not delegating. A &quot;Picket Fences&quot; writer described his time on the show as &quot;the most boring period of my life—you&#x27;d write a scene... [and Kelley would] rewrite it completely. Or he just cut you out completely—you learned nothing. Having a writing staff was a needless expense for the network.&quot; Kelley gradually became more comfortable bringing in writers for ideas and taking over writing responsibilities. Kelley described this as a natural evolution:

===Story elements===
Kelley structures his episodes with multiple storylines. An episode may include a self-contained subplot plus other story arcs that either began in a previous episode or will continue subsequently—some will continue the entire season. The viewer is thereby rarely sure whether what appears as a simple incident will blossom into a major plot point.

Kelley seeds his plots with political and social &quot;hot-button&quot; issues. One method is by introducing provocative legal cases. Episodes have covered the gamut of contemporary issues from the culpability of tobacco companies and gun makers to assisted-suicide crusaders. Another way is by undergirding the character&#x27;s social interrelationships with serious explorations such as feminism, sexuality and divorce. Instead of lessons, Kelley strives to &quot;raise moral and ethical questions without easy answers.&quot; He avoids a didactic narrative by not losing sight of the audience&#x27;s desire to be entertained. He states:

Instead of taking clear stands on issues, Kelley creates scenarios meant to challenge audience preconceptions. For example, an episode of &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; dealt with a female employee who sued for sexual harassment because she noticed that other prettier women were being promoted. There was deliberately no clear point of view.

Kelley uses humor and the surreal and mixes tragedy with farce. He describes his strategy as follows:

In &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, Kelley utilized two techniques: a voiceover providing an interior monologue for the title character, and Walter Mitty fantasy sequences (ala &quot;Dream On&quot; as critics have noted) giving a humorous and often deeply honest (but sometimes ironic) explanation of the character&#x27;s inner thoughts.

===Crossover episodes===
Kelley frequently crossed the cast of different shows. One crossover program event (which crossed networks also) involved characters from Kelley&#x27;s &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; on the Fox network appearing on his ABC show, &quot;The Practice&quot;, and, in turn, &quot;The Practice&quot; characters appeared on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. This was done in spite of the two shows&#x27; different tones (one a comedy, the other a drama). This crossover was partially credited for raising ratings for &quot;The Practice&quot;, which it sustained after those episodes.

Kelley repeated this maneuver with his &quot;Boston Public,&quot; &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, and &quot;Boston Legal&quot; shows. Thereafter, many other crossovers occurred including shows not created by Kelley.

Kelley&#x27;s most elaborate crossover was only partially successful. He sought to crossover an episode of his &quot;Picket Fences&quot; with Chris Carter&#x27;s &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Both shows aired Friday nights, but on different networks. The intent was to begin the story on one show, then hope viewers would switch channels to watch the conclusion on another network. CBS balked, and both scripts were rewritten, with &quot;The X-Files&quot;&#x27; Fox Mulder no longer set to appear on &quot;Picket Fences&quot;. Yet, both episodes deal with Wisconsin and cows, with &quot;Fences&quot; referencing an FBI investigation in a neighboring town. CBS blurred the connection further by postponing the &quot;Fences&quot; episode by one week.

===Casting===
Kelley often uses regular actors from older shows in newer shows. For example, Anthony Heald and René Auberjonois both played judges on &quot;The Practice&quot;, and both went on to be regular cast members in later shows (Heald on &quot;Boston Public&quot; as a vice-principal and Auberjonois on &quot;Boston Legal&quot; as a partner at a law firm). Both Kathy Baker and Justin Shenkarow (&quot;Picket Fences&quot;) have been used in &quot;Boston Public&quot;. Kathy Baker as Meredith &quot;The Hook Lady&quot; Peters and Justin Shenkarow as the student Warren Dickson. In addition many actors who either had the main roles or major roles in Kelley&#x27;s previous shows would make at least one guest appearance in &quot;Boston Legal&quot;.

After the HBO series &quot;Big Little Lies&quot;, Kelley started a working relationship with Academy Award-winning actress Nicole Kidman. The pair have collaborated on several shows together, including &quot;Big Little Lies&quot;, &quot;The Undoing&quot; and &quot;Nine Perfect Strangers&quot;.

==Portrayal of real life==
===Legal profession===
&quot;The Practice&quot; was considered more accurate in its portrayal of the law than &quot;L.A. Law&quot; or &quot;Ally McBeal &quot;. The importance of legal strategy, sometimes at the expense of the truth, rang true. One attorney said, &quot;[I]t&#x27;s really about the tactics and the mistakes that opposing counsel makes.&quot; Judges were represented as complex, less-than-perfect human beings, sometimes with emotional problems. Plots demonstrated how a defendant&#x27;s personality would impact the adjudication of a case. Stuart Levine of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine said, &quot;[The Practice] isn&#x27;t afraid to paint the firm&#x27;s clients as the dregs of society.&quot; Kelley said,

Other aspects of the legal profession in Kelley&#x27;s shows have been criticized as unrealistic. Attorneys have complained that:
* &quot;Ex parte&quot; meetings (where lawyers meet in a judge&#x27;s chambers without opposing counsel present) do not happen.
* Judges would not allow attorneys to badger or attack witnesses.
* Shows overplayed prosecutorial and law enforcement misconduct.
* Time required to select and empanel a jury is not shown or in the story&#x27;s timeline.
* Many of the cases would never have made it to trial.

===Public education===
Samuel G. Freedman, a professor of journalism at Columbia University, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praises Kelley&#x27;s series &quot;Boston Public&quot; as an attempt to both reflect and change public opinion about public education, particularly the urban, overcrowded, underfinanced variety. He liked the realism of the setting, the mixed ethnicity of the faculty and (oftentimes antipathetic) student body and the bureaucratic struggles. He criticized Kelley, though, for pandering to stereotypes of teachers and students and for failing to show successful teaching strategies.

===Medicine===
In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, felt that medical dramas such as Kelley&#x27;s &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; do a good job of addressing bioethical issues such as who should receive a liver transplant or when should a patient be allowed to die. However, there is a lack of discussion concerning the primary money issue: &quot;How do people pay for this?&quot; The show has been criticized for presenting a one-sided view of managed care, portraying HMOs as dramatically evil while glossing over the complexities. Doctors are too often shown as selfless patient advocates ready to battle whatever the financial cost.

===Catholicism===
Kelley has incorporated religious subject matter from the beginning, including issues involving Protestantism, Judaism, Scientology and Catholicism among others. With the widespread media coverage of child sexual abuse cases in the Roman Catholic Church during the mid-to-late 1990s, Kelley began to introduce this controversy into his scripts. For instance, the character Bobby Donnell on &quot;The Practice&quot;, a Catholic, became personally estranged from the Church over the issue of sexually abusive priests. While the Catholic League did not object to this episode, they frequently complained of anti-Catholic bias in Kelley&#x27;s shows because of his references to this subject.

==Feature films==
Besides his first film, &quot;From the Hip&quot;, which received poor reviews, Kelley wrote and produced three other films. 1996&#x27;s &quot;To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday&quot;, a romance, co-starring his wife, Michelle Pfeiffer, received tepid critical and box office reception. In 1999, came two films: &quot;Lake Placid&quot;, a combination of suspense, horror and comedy, and &quot;Mystery, Alaska&quot;, about a fictional small-town ice hockey team that plays a game against the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League

==Personal life==

Although he is sometimes assumed to be a Catholic because his programs address Catholic issues, Kelley was raised a Protestant.

In January 1993, Kelley was set up on a blind date with actress Michelle Pfeiffer; he took her to see &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; the following week and they began dating seriously.

Pfeiffer had entered into private adoption proceedings before she met Kelley. In March 1993, she adopted a newborn daughter Claudia Rose. They married on November 13, 1993, and christened Claudia the same day. In August 1994, Pfeiffer gave birth to a son, John Henry.

David&#x27;s brother, Mark Kelley, is the former Director of Amateur Scouting for the Chicago Blackhawks.

David was drafted in the tenth round of the WHA World Hockey Association draft by the Cincinnati Stingers in 1977.
