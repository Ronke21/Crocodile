<text>Angelica is a town in the middle of Allegany County, New York, United States. The population was 1,284 at the 2020 census. The town is named after Angelica Schuyler Church, the sister of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, activist, scholar, devoted sister and mother, daughter of General Philip Schuyler, sister-in-law of Founding Father Alexander Hamilton and wife of John Barker Church. The town was named by Philip Schuyler Church, who was one of the original European settlers of the area, and the son of Angelica and John Barker Church. The village of Angelica is located within this town.

==History==

The area was first settled around 1802 at Angelica village. The town of Angelica was formed in 1805 from the town of Leicester in Livingston County, before Allegany County was formed. Angelica is the oldest town in Allegany County. The town hall is housed in the Old Allegany County Courthouse, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Belvidere was also listed in 1972, and the Moses Van Campen House was listed in 2004.
Angelica Schuyler Church was an American woman who encouraged other women to fight for their voices, and a witty, society-loving sister of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, who, when young, was much less suited to society than Angelica, preferring to run wild and, when older, tend to the injured soldiers. As a young woman, Angelica eloped with John Church, who was using the pseudonym “Jack Carter”. In 1797, the young United States paid back its war debt to Church in the form of 100,000 acres of land in Western New York. Angelica’s son Philip Schuyler Church travelled to what is now Allegheny and Genesee Counties to take possession of the land, with his surveyor Moses Van Campen. A planned village was laid out with the plots and design to be reminiscent of Paris, France (a circular drive in the center, streets coming to that drive to form a star, and five churches situated around the circle). In the center of the circular drive is the village park. Philip named his planned village &quot;Angelica&quot;, after his mother.

The historian John S. Minard wrote of the town&#x27;s establishment in &quot;Allegany County and Its People&quot; (1896):&quot;The town was formed by an act of the Legislature, passed Feb. 25, 1805, and described as &quot;being in width twelve miles,&quot; just that of the Morris Reserve, and in length &quot;from south to north extending thirty-four miles from the Pennsylvania line,&quot; taking in about two-thirds of the towns of Granger and Grove. It was taken from Leicester, and when erected was a part of Genesee county. (The village had been founded three or four years before, and named by Capt. Philip Church for his mother, Angelica, the eldest daughter of Gen. Philip Schuyler.[2]&quot;Philip left to marry Anna Matilda Stewart, daughter of General Walter Stewart in Philadelphia. For their honeymoon, they traveled first by boat, then by raft as far west as Bath, New York, then on horseback to the banks of the Genesee River. They constructed a small house, soon to be whitewashed and known as the &quot;white house&quot;. In 1804, they had their mansion built (known as &quot;Belvidere&quot;). It still stands on the banks of the Genesee near Angelica, New York.

<text>Bolivar is a village in Allegany County, New York, United States. The village is in the northwest part of the town of Bolivar and is east of Olean. The population of the village was 1,047 at the 2010 census. It is named after Simón Bolívar.

== History ==

The first building on the future site of the village, a log cabin, was erected around 1820. The village of Bolivar was incorporated in 1882.
As &quot;the heart of the Allegany Oil Field&quot;, the Bolivar-Richburg area rose to significance during the oil boom era of the late 1800s. During the brief initial oil boom of the 1880s it was purportedly the wealthiest locale, per capita, in the United States. By the early 1900s the initial boom, with its economic and population impacts, had significantly faded, but secondary oil recovery techniques applied to the oil fields (starting around 1920) drastically rejuvenated the industry in the area. By the early 1930s Bolivar village boasted an imposing new school, well-paved streets, a modern sewage treatment facility, and a thriving Main Street economy.

The village and town of Bolivar adopted the description &quot;Land of the Deer and the Derrick&quot; in the mid-1900s.

The village is home to the high school of the Bolivar-Richburg Central School District, which merged in the fall of 1994.

The Bolivar Free Library was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

==Geography==
Bolivar is located at (42.067324, -78.166622).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land. Root Hollow Creek enters the village from the east, joining with Little Genesee Creek flowing north–south through the west edge of the village, leading to the Allegheny River.

Bolivar is at the junction of state routes 275 and 417.

Bolivar was served (1881–1947) by the Pittsburg, Shawmut &amp; Northern Railroad (PS&amp;N) and predecessors (1881–1893), by the Bradford, Eldred &amp; Cuba Railroad System (BE&amp;C), and (1903–1926) by the Olean, Bradford &amp; Salamanca Railway (OB&amp;S) and predecessors. The early PS&amp;N predecessors and the BE&amp;C were 36&quot; narrow-gauge railroads while the PS&amp;N and OB&amp;S were standard-gauge railroads, the latter being electric-powered.

Notable People:

Frank Gannett, founder of the Gannett News Service, and presidential hopeful, graduated from Bolivar High School in 1893.

Bob Torrey, an NFL running back who played college football for Penn State, and for the Giants, Dolphins and Eagles, graduated from Bolivar High School in 1974.

Richard Dougherty, Bolivar Class of 1938, served as press secretary for Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern during his 1972 campaign. Dougherty went on to serve as the public relations director for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

Patsy Dougherty, Patrick Henry &quot;Patsy&quot; Dougherty, Bolivar High School Class of 1893, was a professional baseball player from 1902 to 1911. Playing first for the Boston Americans (now Red Sox), in the first modern World Series (1903), Patsy was the first member of the team to hit a World Series home run, the first player ever to hit two home runs in one World Series game, and was the only person to hit a lead-off inside-the-park home run in a World Series game until that feat was finally duplicated 112 years later, in 2015. He was also the first player to play for two different teams when they won the World Series, playing in 1906 for the Chicago White Sox.

===Adjacent towns===
Cuba is north of the town of Clarksville and south of the town of New Hudson. It is east of the town of Ischua in Cattaraugus County and west of the town of Friendship.

===Etymology===
John S. Minard&#x27;s &quot;Civic History of Cuba,&quot; published in 1910, states:
&quot;Cuba is a Roman word and means Goddess or Protector of the Young. So in all probability, the Legislators of 1822, when they set aside the township from the town of Friendship, by accident, stumbled upon the word and appropriated the name, the significance of which is pleasant to think of.&quot;
Simeon DeWitt, the surveyor general for New York State in the early 19th century, was an avid student of ancient Roman mythology and is credited with suggesting the name.

Though it may seem that the town was named after the island of Cuba, this is not the case. A common reason for this perception is the prevalence of other towns in the area with names of Spanish cities or towns, such as Salamanca, Panama, and Bolivar.

==Demographics==

The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.4 males.

==History==
The Town of Cuba was formed in 1822 from part of the town of Friendship. In 1830, Cuba was reduced by the formation of the town of Genesee. In 1835, Cuba was partitioned again to form the town of Clarksville.

Formerly known as Township 3 Range 2 of the Holland Land Purchase, the settlement of Cuba began in 1817, and the town was separated in 1822, and a village incorporated in 1850. Between 1810 and the late 1820s the place saw a boom in both settlement and population as many of the town&#x27;s first businesses, churches and schools were established.

== Business ==

===Cheese===
Starting in the 1870s, Cuba was a notable cheese producing town in New York. Part of the reason for why Cuba was so important in the cheese trade was its location on railroads making access from New York City easy. In the early 20th century, Cuba was known as the &quot;Cheese Capital of the World&quot;.

==Points of interest==

===Cuba Lake===

Cuba Lake is a man-made lake located about north of the village at above sea level. It is the highest reservoir in Allegany County and the sixth-highest in western New York State. It was constructed in 1858 at a cost of $150,000, as a reservoir to feed the Genesee Valley Canal. At the time of its construction, Cuba Lake was the largest man-made lake in the world. The lake contains many game fish including bass, walleye, and northern pike.

Today, the lake mainly serves as a source of recreation for locals. It is surrounded by over 300 homes, many of which are year-round dwellings. The road surrounding the lake is about in length and very narrow.

===The Seneca Oil Spring===
The Seneca Oil Spring is located near the spillway end of Cuba Lake on the Oil Springs Reservation in Allegany County. This is the site of a famed spring described by the Franciscan Missionary Joseph de La Roche Daillon in 1627, the first recorded mention of oil on the North American Continent. In 1927, the New York State Oil Producers Association sponsored the dedication of a monument at the site describing the history of the oil industry in North America. The site is now under the supervision of Allegany County and a picnic area is available for those visiting there.

===McKinney Stables===

Cuba is also home to the McKinney Stables of Empire City Farms, which the locals call the Block Barn, on Route 305 south of the Historic District. Constructed in 1909, this structure, which is made almost entirely of cement, is nearly long and is completely fireproof. It was built to house William Simpson&#x27;s &quot;McKinney&quot; horses. It has been a popular stable and the Czar of Russia sent a mare there to be mated with &quot;Mckinney&quot;. It was once considered by the Anheuser Busch company as a spot to house its famous Clydesdales. Each year in September it hosts the Cuba Garlic Festival.

The stables were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.

==Education==

=== Local schools ===
The main high school in Cuba is Cuba-Rushford Middle High School, which formed after a merger of the Cuba and Rushford school districts. The Middle High School sits north of the town on Route 305 and teaches grades 6-12. What is known as the &quot;Old&quot; High School on Elm Street now teaches grades K-5; the &quot;Old&quot; Elementary School across the street is now the Elm Street Academy, part of a BOCES program. The mascot of Cuba was the Greyhounds until the merger in the mid-1990s when the mascot was renamed to the Rebels. The Rebel&#x27;s mascot resembles Yosemite Sam, with slight variations in the character design in order to avoid copyright issues.

=== Higher education ===
West of Cuba, between the village of Allegany and the city of Olean, is St. Bonaventure University (SBU); SBU&#x27;s campus is located on the Olean/Allegany border. Some of SBU&#x27;s teams, such as the basketball and baseball teams, play in the Atlantic 10 Conference of NCAA Division 1.

<text>Wellsville is a village in Allegany County, New York, United States. Located in south-central wooded and rural Allegany County, it is the largest population and business center in a radius. The population was 4,679 at the 2010 census. The village&#x27;s name is not, as some suppose, derived from the oil wells that became an important economic part of the area, but rather for Gardiner Wells, a local businessman.

The village of Wellsville is circumscribed by the town of Wellsville, adding another approximately 3,000 people to the population (approx. 7,000 combined village and town). Alfred State College maintains a branch by the south end of the village. Wellsville Airport, Tarantine Field, located to the west of the village, provides general aviation and charter services.

== History ==
Wellsville was the location of encampments for thousands of years, including the Lamoka and Brewerton cultures. The latest native people, the Seneca, named Wellsville &quot;Gistaguat&quot;, according to a map produced in 1771 by Guy Johnson, as the official map of New York state at the time, for then-Governor William Tryon. The Seneca referred to the Wellsville area as &quot;the Pigeon Woods&quot; and held annual festivals and encampments there to take advantage of the passenger pigeon (see memoirs of Captain Horatio Jones). At the time, passenger pigeons filled the skies by the millions, and the tribes and bands came to the Wellsville area from all over western New York and northern Pennsylvania to Gistaquat to harvest the pigeons by the thousands.

European settlers moved into the area before 1800. Nathaniel Dyke, a native of Connecticut, and a captain in the Revolutionary War, serving under both General George Washington and General Warren of Bunker Hill fame, was the first of these in Allegany County. He married a Native American woman (Esther) and moved his family to the Wellsville area by 1795, while it was still owned by the Seneca Nation (two years before the Big Tree Treaty of 1797). He began running a gristmill, a sawmill, and a tannery on a stream now known as Dyke&#x27;s Creek, by 1803. Dyke is buried in Elm Valley, just east of town. His tombstone has the official memorial that was placed there by the Catherine Schuyler Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

Historically, the economy of Wellsville has undergone many changes in its 200 years. Wellsville&#x27;s first industry was tanning, utilizing the bark of the hemlock tree for its tannins. Wellsville was the site of three large tannery operations during the early 19th century. Next came the lumbermen and the railroad. The New York and Erie Railroad came through what would become Wellsville (then the outskirts of Scio) in 1851. That was the quickest way west from New York City, crossing New York state. This proved that Nathaniel Dyke&#x27;s choice of location was the quickest, easiest and most practical way across Allegany County. The trains gave the lumbermen a new and more efficient means to get their product to market. Previous to this, the logs had been floated on the rivers and canals. Logging moved on to more densely forested areas in the latter part of the 19th century. The cleared ground quickly produced excellent grazing for a tremendous dairy industry which followed. Oil captured the economic center stage in the last two decades of the 19th century, and the Sinclair Refinery was built in Wellsville at the beginning of the 20th century, not closing down until 1957 after two major fires and falling oil prices.

As many wonder about this, Wellsville was not named for its oil &quot;wells&quot;. Oil was not discovered in Wellsville until 1879 by O.P. Taylor in his famous &quot;Triangle No. 1&quot; well in Petrolia, west of Wellsville. The town was created as it split from Scio in 1856. The village of Wellsville was incorporated the following year, in 1857, 22 years before oil was discovered.

The area that is now Wellsville was part of Scio through the first half of the 19th century. It was incorporated as Wellsville and set apart from Scio in 1857. For a brief time during the early 1870s, Wellsville changed its name to &quot;Genesee&quot;. On April 4, 1871, the New York State Legislature officially changed Wellsville&#x27;s name to Genesee. After much political wrangling, by a special act of the legislature, the name Wellsville was again designated as the official name of the town, June 8, 1873. The village of Wellsville was first incorporated in 1857 and then again in 1873.

Eponymously, Wellsville was actually named for a man named Gardiner Wells, who was, according to local history, the one person who didn&#x27;t show up for the meeting when the residents were naming the town. Wells was the major landowner of the real estate pieces, now the downtown Main Street section of Wellsville. The first oil boom came later in Wellsville&#x27;s history, several decades after the founding of the town and village. A second boom occurred with the discovery of &quot;Secondary Recovery&quot;, led by Bradley Producing, based in Wellsville. The method uses water, so abundant in Wellsville, to force the oil from the &quot;oil sands&quot;.

Wellsville is known for being the junction of many foothill streams including Dyke&#x27;s Creek feeding the Genesee River from the east. The water from Hurricane Agnes in 1972 exceeded the capacity and banks of Dyke&#x27;s Creek, producing a rapid and huge pool of water at the center of the village. The extent of the damaged area continued downstream through Scio and Amity until the valley widened to accept the large flow of water in the lesser populated area. Erosion of topsoil during this flood eliminated many small farms.

In 1989, the US Post Office-Wellsville was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Wellsville Erie Depot was listed in 1987.

Lastly, in March 2006, a referendum to dissolve the village was defeated by the residents. At present, local officials are attempting to obtain a charter for the community to reorganize both municipalities into one entity, a city.

==Geography and climate==
Land in Wellsville totals , according to the United States Census Bureau.

Relative to both New York and Pennsylvania, Wellsville is on the mainline of the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad. The Genesee River flows through the village. New York State Route 19, running north and south, intersects New York State Route 417 north and south of the center of town, with the two highways running together between the two intersections, parallel to Main Street. Route 417 from the east comes upstream having followed the tributaries of the Susquehanna River, the Chemung and the Canisteo. After passing through Wellsville, Route 417 quickly begins a downhill descent to the west on the Allegheny River, through its tributary in Bolivar, Dodge Creek.

Wellsville is located in the region of the Eastern Triple Divide, the cusp of the three major watersheds in the eastern United States. The Genesee River flows through the center of the village and the town of Wellsville, north to Rochester and Lake Ontario, then on to the St. Lawrence River and the Atlantic Ocean. In the Wellsville school district, in Alma, southwest of Wellsville, Honeoye Creek flows west to Oswayo Creek and then the Allegheny River, then to the Ohio and the Mississippi River, eventually to the Gulf of Mexico. And just over Jericho Hill to the northeast of Wellsville in the town of Alfred, the water flows to the east down the Canacadea Creek valley to the Canisteo River, eventually to the Susquehanna River and on to the Atlantic.

Rivetingly, the actual Triple Divide is a point south of Wellsville at , just south of the village of Gold, Pennsylvania. There, at the exact point, a bucket of water can be dumped and the water will flow three ways, theoretically unimpeded: north, southeast and southwest.

International and regional weather reports are often misleading when Wellsville&#x27;s weather is reported. Meteorologists including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) gather their weather data of the Wellsville area from meteorological devices located at the airport, at an elevation of above sea level. The village of Wellsville is at , lower and protected from the winds in the Genesee River Valley. Wind speeds and temperature, as well as precipitation often differ greatly, especially in the spring and the fall, between the village and the top of the mountain where the airport is located (northeast leg of Niles Hill). Sometimes the temperature varies 10 °F (5 °C) between the village and the tops of the surrounding hills.

<text>Wellsville is a town and largest community in Allegany County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town had a population of 7,099.

Wellsville is centrally located in the south half of the county, north of the Pennsylvania border. Wellsville is also the name of the main village within this town. The village and the town have two separate, paid governments. Alfred State College maintains a branch campus in the town, with the main campus in Alfred east.

==History==

Originally an encampment for native peoples, Wellsville&#x27;s settlement was driven, first, by the tanning and lumber industries and, later, the discovery of oil and natural gas.

Wellsville was the location of encampments for thousands of years, including the Lamoka and Brewerton cultures. The latest native people, the Seneca, named Wellsville &quot;Gistaguat&quot;, according to a map produced in 1771 by Guy Johnson, as the official map of New York state at the time, for then-Governor William Tryon. The Seneca referred to the Wellsville area as &quot;the Pigeon Woods&quot; and held annual festivals and encampments there to take advantage of the passenger pigeon (see memoirs of Captain Horatio Jones). At the time, passenger pigeons filled the skies by the millions, and the tribes and bands came to the Wellsville area from all over western New York and northern Pennsylvania to Gistaquat to harvest the pigeons by the thousands.

European settlers moved into the area before 1800. Nathaniel Dyke, a native of Connecticut, and a captain in the Revolutionary War, serving under both General George Washington and General Warren of Bunker Hill fame, was the first of these in Allegany County. He married a Native American woman (Esther) and moved his family to the Wellsville area by 1795, while it was still owned by the Seneca Nation (two years before the Big Tree Treaty of 1797). He began running a gristmill, a sawmill, and a tannery on a stream now known as Dykes Creek, by 1803. Dyke is buried in Elm Valley, just east of town. His tombstone has the official memorial placed there by the Catherine Schuyler Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

Wellsville&#x27;s first industry was tanning, utilizing the bark of the hemlock tree for its tannins. Three large tanneries operated in Wellsville during the early 19th century. Next came the lumbermen and the railroad. The New York and Erie Railroad came through what would become Wellsville (then the outskirts of Scio) in 1851 as the quickest way west from New York City, crossing New York state. This proved that Nathaniel Dyke&#x27;s choice of location was the quickest, easiest and most practical way across Allegany County. The trains gave the lumbermen a new and more efficient means to get their product to market. Prior to this, the logs had been floated on the rivers and canals. Logging moved on to more densely forested areas in the latter part of the 19th century but the cleared ground quickly produced excellent grazing for a tremendous dairy industry which followed.

Wellsville was named after a man named Gardiner Wells, who was, according to local history, the one person who didn&#x27;t show up for the meeting when the residents were naming the town. Wells was the major landowner of the real estate pieces, now the downtown Main Street section of Wellsville. The first oil boom came later in Wellsville&#x27;s history, several decades after the founding of the town and village when oil was discovered in Wellsville in 1879 by O.P. Taylor in his famous &quot;Triangle No. 1&quot; well in Petrolia, west of Wellsville. A second boom occurred with the discovery of &quot;Secondary Recovery&quot;, led by Bradley Producing, based in Wellsville. The method uses water, so abundant in Wellsville, to force the oil from the &quot;oil sands&quot;. The Sinclair Refinery was built in Wellsville at the beginning of the 20th century, not closing down until 1957 after two major fires and falling oil prices.

Since World War II, Wellsville&#x27;s economy has been dominated by skilled engineering and manufacturing with a cluster of multinational companies in the energy sector. It also has a cluster of ceramic artists and artisans fed by its proximity to Alfred University&#x27;s ceramics school.

The area that is now Wellsville was part of Scio through the first half of the 19th century. It was incorporated as Wellsville and set apart from Scio in 1857. For a brief time during the early 1870s, Wellsville changed its name to &quot;Genesee&quot;. On April 4, 1871, the New York State Legislature officially changed Wellsville&#x27;s name to Genesee. After much political wrangling, by a special act of the legislature, the name Wellsville was again designated as the official name of the town, June 8, 1873. The village of Wellsville was first incorporated in 1857 and then again in 1873.
Wellsville is the junction of many foothill streams including Dyke Creek feeding the Genesee River from the east. The water from Hurricane Agnes in 1972 exceeded the capacity and banks of Dyke Creek, producing a rapid and huge pool of water at the center of the village. The extent of the damaged area continued downstream through Scio and Amity until the valley widened to accept the large flow of water in the lesser populated area. Erosion of topsoil during this flood eliminated many small farms.

The US Post Office-Wellsville, built by the Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression in the art deco style, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.[5]
The Wellsville Erie Depot is a historic train station located at Wellsville in Allegany County, New York. It was constructed in 1911, for the Erie Railroad. It is a one-story, 132-foot (40 m) by 33-foot (10 m) structure displaying elements of the Queen Anne and Romanesque Revival styles popular in the late 19th and early 20th century. It is located across the street from the US Post Office-Wellsville. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

In March 2006, a referendum to dissolve the village was defeated by the residents. At present, local officials are attempting to obtain a charter for the community to reorganize both municipalities into one entity, a city.

<doc id="259642" wikidata="Q3460770" url="?curid=259642" title="Lisle (village), New York">
<text>Lisle is a village in Broome County, New York, United States. The population was 348 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Binghamton Metropolitan Statistical Area. The village was named after a community in France. It was once called Onondaga.

The village of Lisle is in the southeast part of the town of Lisle and is north of Binghamton.

==History==

In 1791, the region which would become Lisle was settled by American Revolutionary Army veterans from Massachusetts. The settlers were members of the Boston Purchase (Boston Ten Townships) that bought 240,000 acres in what is now Broome County, from the State of Massachusetts, at a penny an acre. As part of this arrangement, settlers also had to pay the local Indian tribes another penny an acre. The first permanent settler was Ebenezer Tracy in 1793, who built his home near the present-day Lisle cemetery.

In its earliest days as a settlement, it is said of the land that &quot;the hills were covered with forests, the rivers were well-fed, and much of the land swampy. On the eastern side of the river&#x27;s edge one spring bubbled forth near the river&#x27;s edge and flooded the surroundings to a condition of soft mud&quot;. The water from this spring carried various salts in solution, which tended to crystalize on the surrounding mud. Deer would be spotted coming to lick the salt crystals, which earned the village its first name of &quot;Mud Lick&quot;. The settlers did not like the name, and set out to find a new one. Officers and veterans who had served under General Lafayette in the Revolutionary War decided to honor their general by renaming &quot;Mud Lick&quot; after his home town in France, Lisle 

Some of the first settlers were Major Solomon Owens and the families of &quot;Squire, Howland, Edwards, Edminsters, Freeman, French, Burghardt, Osborns, Lewis, Orton, McDowell, Collier, Hubbards, Sparrows, Benedict, Johnson, Clark, and Franklin&quot;. Early Lisle was a place of great activity, with grist mills, tanneries, lumber companies, blacksmith shops, a gun factory, cigar factory, and a shoe factory being established. Soon, Grocery stores, drug stores, creameries, millinery stores, and a crude school sprang up in the village. It is said of early Lisle that &quot;one could get in the village all needed articles&quot;. The new settlers established a Library and a congregational church by 1795, which is locally claimed to be the &quot;first church west of the Catskills&quot;. The church had great authority over its members, who were severely reprimanded if they disobeyed its laws. Lisle&#x27;s population grew rapidly, progressing to 600 inhabitants by 1800. Lisle&#x27;s first post office was established in 1802, with Simeon Rogers acting as its post-master.

In 1866, the village of Lisle is officially incorporated.

The original school built by the settlers shortly after they arrived was replaced by the &quot;Lisle Academy&quot; in 1868. The new school became known in the area, with many of its students coming in from neighboring regions and boarding with local families while attending.

In May 1871 Gilbert A. Dodge founded the &quot;Lisle Gleaner&quot;, the first newspaper published in the village.

In 1914, the Lisle Village Improvement Society was founded. The Lisle Village Improvement society ran a public library throughout the early 1900&#x27;s, which replaced the original Library that closed in 1839 due to no taxes being paid towards it. In 1925, the Village Improvement Society handed over their collection of books to the newly constructed &quot;Lisle Free Library.&quot; The library was built and donated by Herbert H. Franklin, manufacturer of the Franklin Motorcar, in honor of his father, Charles Risden Franklin.

In 1915, Richard Edwards and his wife, Anne, in memory of their daughter, Elizabeth Ann Edwards, founded the Happy Valley Home for boys and girls. The home would later be sold to the Lisle Christian Conference Center in 1945, who owned it until 1977. The home is currently a private residence.

On January 5, 1918, Florence B. Chauncey became the first woman in New York State to vote, at the Lisle Village Hall. A historical marker commemorating this event was erected at the village hall in 2018. The vote considered whether or not to allow alcohol to be continued to be sold in the town. Among its opponents were tavern owners like O. A. Burtis, the owner of local Dudley Hotel and Bar who said &quot;I challenge the vote of every woman in here&quot;. Opponents such as him antagonized women&#x27;s suffrage because they expected the women to vote against the sale of alcohol. Chauncey had placed her historic vote at 6:10 AM that day, followed shortly by 244 other women. All 255 votes were in support of outlawing alcohol sales. The President of the Village Improvement Society R. H. Edwards was one of the women who cast a vote that day, saying: &quot;we, as representative women of the town of Lisle, are willing and eager to express our satisfaction in being the first of our sex to cast the ballot in New York State&quot;.
In 1926, the village bank was looted, but the robbers were caught.

Lisle was known to have always been prone to flooding, with several bridges and sidewalks allegedly being washed away from 1793-1934. In 1935 a major flood ravaged Lisle, which prompted the development of flood protection for the village. This involved the demolition of bridges, addition of streets, and the construction of dikes around danger spots.

Lisle&#x27;s progress calmed down by 1965, with many of its businesses and factories closing down. Much of Lisle&#x27;s infrastructure, including its passenger train service and telegram station, shut down permanently around this time. Despite this, Lisle&#x27;s Library remained open, which provided it a great advantage over other New York State villages.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

Lisle is known for its hills, which vary in height from 400 to 700 feet.

The Tioughnioga River (called the Onondaga on some maps) forms the eastern boundary of the village. It is a tributary of the Susquehanna River.

The village is on New York State Route 79 west of U.S. Route 11 and Interstate 81, and is located one mile north of the larger village of Whitney Point.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 302 people, 116 households, and 75 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 135 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 98.34% White, 0.66% Black or African American, 0.99% from other races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.99% of the population.

The per capita income for the village was $14,685. About 10.7% of families and 12.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 18.5% of those under the age of eighteen and 5.4% of those 65 or over.

<text>Lisle is a town in Broome County, New York, United States. The population was 2,751 at the 2010 census.

The town is in the northwestern part of the county and is north of Binghamton. The town includes a village also named Lisle.

== History ==

The area that is now the town of Lisle was first settled around 1791. The town was formed from the town of Union in 1801. Later, parts of Lisle were used to form new towns in the county: in 1831, a division of Lisle into four parts created three new towns: Barker, Nanticoke, and Triangle.

John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s birthplace is located northeast of Lisle by a few miles in Richford, New York and his relatives lived in Lisle. Rockefeller&#x27;s father lived outside the morals of the Lisle community since he had two wives.

One reported original settlement, the Torry Lot, was located approximately within a one-mile radius of the hill on Hotaling&#x27;s property (the first owner of a piece of the Boston Purchase). There apparently were some disputes with the local Indians, and Hotaling&#x27;s son was killed by Indians. The original &quot;Torry Lot&quot; settlers burned their possessions and moved because their livestock died, and they deemed the area uninhabitable.

The first white settlers around 1791 included Josiah Patterson, Ebenezer Tracy, Edward Edwards, David Manning, Eliphalet Parsons and Whittlesey Gleason. By 1830, Lisle was &quot;congested&quot; and had a population of 4,393 - more than any other town in Broome County. Lisle was a shopping mecca, and the wares produced at the numerous mills were being sold in the thriving &quot;Center Lisle&quot; (originally called Yorkshire). Lisle in 1835 had considerable distinction as a manufacturing town, at that time having in operation three gristmills, twenty sawmills, one oil cloth mill, three fulling mills, three carding mills, one trip hammer or forging mill, three tanneries and two places where potash was made.

46 years later (1876), Lisle&#x27;s population had fallen dramatically to 400, likely because of a flood, but the exact reason for this decline is unknown.

In January 1918, Florence B. Chauncey became the first woman in New York State to vote, at the Lisle Village Hall. A historical marker commemorating this event was erected at the Village Hall in 2018.

In 1915 a home for children, &quot;Happy Valley Homes&quot;, was established in the town.

The flood of 1935 destroyed a large part of the town, and often items from the 1935 flood are still being discovered, and displayed at the Maple Festival (Marathon) every year. Within and near the village of Lisle, this type of turmoil is unlikely to happen again because of dike-building and other flood control work along the Tioughnioga River and tributaries, which was accomplished in conjunction with construction of the Whitney Point dam on the separate Otselic River watershed (authorized under the Flood Control Act of June 22, 1936).

The history of Lisle is marked by population decreases: the abandonment of the Torry Lot, the fall of the Lisle mills, the flood of 1935.

Today however, with the rediscovery of gas, the population is slightly increasing again.

<text>Windsor is a town in Broome County, New York, United States. The population was 5,804 at the 2020 census.

The town is on the southern border of the county and is east of Binghamton. The town includes the village of Windsor, located on the Susquehanna River.

==History==
This area along the Susquehanna had long been settled by varying cultures of indigenous peoples, including those of the historic Iroquois Confederacy, who used the river for transportation, water and fishing. Around 1712 remnants of the Tuscarora tribe settled in the northern part of the town. Also an Iroquoian-speaking people, they had migrated from North Carolina, which they left because of warfare with English colonists and other tribes. In 1722, the Tuscarora were accepted by the Iroquois as the Sixth Nation of their political confederacy.
Their fortified village, &quot;Onaquaga&quot;, was an outpost of the British Colonies. A mission had been established there by the Indian Superintendent, Sir William Johnson. Mohawk and other allies of the British also became established there. Joseph Brant used it as a base for his Volunteers, which fought with the British during the American Revolutionary War. In retaliation for joint British and Iroquois raids on frontier communities, the Continental Army attacked and destroyed Onaquaga in October 1778.

It was 1785 before the region was settled again by new migrants, many of whom were Yankees from New England and veterans of the war. They formed the town of Windsor in 1807, the year following the formation of Broome County, from the town of Chenango. The town was reduced in size by the creation of two other new towns in 1821: Sanford and Colesville. In 1851, a small part of Windsor was used to help form the town of Conklin. For years the economy was based on agriculture.

<text>Ellicottville is a village in Cattaraugus County, New York, United States. The population was 284 at the 2020 census. The village is named after Joseph Ellicott, principal land agent of the Holland Land Company. It lies in the southwest part of the town of Ellicottville and is north of the city of Salamanca.

== History ==
The native name for this location was &quot;De-as-hen-da-qua&quot;, or &quot;place for holding court&quot;.

The Holland Land Company opened an office in 1818. The community was the original county seat of Cattaraugus County in 1808, and public buildings were subsequently constructed.

The village of Ellicottville was incorporated in 1837. In 1868, the county seat was moved to the village of Little Valley.

The Ellicottville Historic District, Ellicottville Town Hall, and Jefferson Street Cemetery are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Commerce ==
=== Ski slopes and tourism ===
The Holiday Valley ski resort is south of the village, and the Nannen Arboretum is north. Ellicottville is also home to the HoliMont Ski Club, the largest private ski club in North America. Because of the proximity to these two popular skiing destinations, Ellicottville is Cattaraugus County&#x27;s primary tourist destination. Property values in the town and village of Ellicottville have gentrified rapidly and are, as a result, much higher than the rest of the county.

A major &quot;Fall Festival&quot; is held each year, coinciding with Canadian Thanksgiving weekend (most of Ellicottville&#x27;s tourists come from Canada) and the peak of the leaf peeping season. Ellicottville has a large number of festivals throughout the year, including Mardi Gras (which, ironically, is always held during Lent), a &quot;Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Oldies Weekend&quot;, a &quot;Jazz and Blues Festival,&quot; and a &quot;Taste of Ellicottville&quot;.

=== Other commerce ===
The village of Ellicottville has strict zoning regulations prohibiting most chain franchises from operating in the village; its central business district is occupied mostly by taverns, boutiques and various similar small businesses. 

Two weekly newspapers are based in Ellicottville, &quot;Ellicottville Now&quot; and &quot;The Villager&quot;. The &quot;Villager&quot; dates to the mid-2000s. In addition to the weekly papers, a monthly tourism tabloid also originates in the village, which operates as &quot;Ellicottville Snowed-In&quot; during the winter and &quot;The Summer Local&quot; the rest of the year (its publisher also launched &quot;Ellicottville Now&quot; in 2020; that weekly paper is a spiritual successor to the &quot;Ellicottville Times&quot; and before that &quot;Special E-Fects&quot;, which dated as far back as 1992).

Louisville Slugger baseball bats were manufactured in Ellicottville for a number of years; after that company&#x27;s departure, the factory building was converted into a bowling alley. Fitzpatrick &amp; Weller, a wood products manufacturer, is the only currently operating factory in the village.

== Education ==
Public school students attend Ellicottville Central School, the campus of which is in neighboring Great Valley.

== Religion ==
Several churches operate in Ellicottville, including Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Episcopal denominations. The local Free Presbyterian and United Methodist Churches merged into the &quot;United Church of Ellicottville&quot; in 1976.

== Notable people ==
*Charles Henry Bryan, former justice of the Supreme Court of California

<text>Ellicottville is a town in Cattaraugus County, New York, United States. The population was 1,317 at the 2020 census. The town is named after Joseph Ellicott, principal land agent of the Holland Land Company.

The town of Ellicottville includes a village also called Ellicottville. The town is in the north-central part of the county, north of the city of Salamanca.

== History ==
The town was first settled &quot;circa&quot; 1815.

The Town of Ellicottville was established in 1820 from the town of Franklinville (then known as Ischua). The town lost some of its territory when the town of Ashford was formed in 1824. In 1858, a small part of the town was taken to aid the formation of the town of East Otto.

The Village of Ellicottville was formerly the county seat for Cattaraugus County. The county seat moved to Little Valley in May 1868.

The John J. Aiken House and Bryant Hill Cemetery are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Gentrification ==

Since the establishments of the Holimont and Holiday Valley ski resorts in the town, Ellicottville has seen massive gentrification as mostly Canadian ski enthusiasts have taken up part-time residences in the town. Property values in the town are significantly higher than in the rest of the county. Because the village has restrictive zoning laws that discourage national franchises from entering the village, these types of restaurants have located just outside the village limits. Also in Ellicottville is an unnamed dual-purpose venue that hosts the Ellicottville Championship Rodeo each Independence Day weekend and the Nightmare Hayrides in October.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.21%, is water.

Great Valley Creek, a tributary of the Allegheny River, flows through the town.

New York State Route 242 runs east–west through the town, intersecting US 219 in the village of Ellicottville. New York State Route 240 ends at NY 242 in the hamlet of Ashford, in the northeast part of the town.

<doc id="259652" wikidata="Q3111105" url="?curid=259652" title="Little Valley (village), New York">
<text>Little Valley is a village and the county seat of Cattaraugus County, New York, United States. It is the location of the county fair (held in August in the fairgrounds north of the village). The village is in the northwest corner of the town of Little Valley, which is north of Salamanca. The village population was 1,084 at the 2020 census, out of a population of 1,740 within the entire town.

The village&#x27;s name is a relative comparison of two tributaries (the other being the neighboring Great Valley) of the Allegheny River.

== History ==
Prior to 1868, the village of Ellicottville was the county seat, but the presence of a railroad line in Little Valley prompted a move. The village of Little Valley was incorporated in 1876. The railroad line shut down around 1990.

The Little Valley post office is the only village structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building is one of the newer buildings in the town, constructed in 1941 as project of the Works Progress Administration. Several other buildings (such as the Civil War Memorial Building in 1911 and the former Little Valley Central School building in 1921, as well as many of the houses) are significantly older than the post office.

Ira Joe Fisher, a daytime television personality and weather reporter, spent most of his childhood in Little Valley.

==Politics and government==
The village is operated by a village board that consists of a mayor, a deputy mayor, and three trustees. All serve four-year terms, and most of the board is up for re-election in the same year, meaning that two to three years can pass without any village board seats up for election.

The mayor of Little Valley is Jim Bowen, an independent. Bowen upset Norman Marsh, the longtime incumbent Republican mayor, in an election in March 2019; Bowen&#x27;s term as mayor runs through March 2023. The village board consists of a deputy mayor and three other trustees, all elected at-large.

===Public services===
Fire service is provided through a local volunteer fire department, in operation since 1888. As of 2016, ambulance services are typically outsourced. Police services are provided directly by the Cattaraugus County Sheriff&#x27;s Office.

Little Valley offers its own municipal electric service, through an affiliation with National Grid (formerly Niagara Mohawk), as well as municipal water, sewer, and streets departments.

==Culture==
===Local commerce===
Little Valley&#x27;s main attraction is the Cattaraugus County Fairgrounds, the site of the annual county fair each August. It has historically hosted an annual &quot;Freedom Daze&quot; Fourth of July festival, horse shows and other miscellaneous events, and from 1997 to the late 2010s, operated as Little Valley Speedway, a motorsports stadium.

In 2001, the Little Valley Area Chamber of Commerce was founded. They host events such &quot;Cheers to Little Valley&quot; and sponsor &quot;Christmas on Main Street&quot;. A Friends of Little Valley committee, also operating as Little Valley Happenings, formed in the early 2020s promoting community events in the village.

No national chain franchises operate in the village of Little Valley. Its storefront businesses as of 2024 include a convenience store, hardware store, two taverns, a laundromat, a regional bank, a credit union, a Chrysler/Dodge automobile dealership, an auto repair and collision shop, an insurance agency, and two hair salons. The local grocery store, originally an A&amp;P in the 1960s and locally operated as Brooks Market from 1972 to 2017, went out of business during the retail apocalypse in January 2018; it was replaced by a grocery/convenience store relocating from Salamanca later that year, which closed in August 2019.
===Media===
One radio station, weather radio WWG32 (162.425), is licensed to the village. WWG32 is based at the National Weather Service offices at Buffalo Niagara International Airport in Cheektowaga. It has been off-air for an unknown length of time.

WGWE operated from 2010 to 2021, and intermittently in 2022, from a tower south of the village. The license, now with call sign WCGS, has operated as a repeater for Family Life Network since 2023.

Little Valley is part of the Buffalo television market. Due to the hilly terrain, strong rooftop directional antennae are required to receive over-the-air television since the digital transition in 2009. Breezeline is the local cable provider, with wireline high-speed internet available through them or Armstrong, which began servicing Little Valley in the early 2020s through an existing but abandoned fiber-optic cable, thereby ending Breezeline and its predecessors&#x27; long monopoly over broadband in the village.

===Historical business===
The cutlery industry was a major driver of the village of Little Valley&#x27;s early economy. Cattaraugus Cutlery Company was the last surviving knife manufacturer in the village; it remained there until closing its doors in 1963, with its factory remaining standing and vacant until its destruction in a 2015 fire. W. R. Case &amp; Sons Cutlery Co. was spun off from Cattaraugus in 1905, and that company remains in business, now based in Bradford, Pennsylvania.

Three weekly newspapers have operated out of Little Valley; the first was the &quot;Cattaraugus Republican&quot; (founded 1867, originally based in Ellicottville, but later acquired by the Salamanca Press), the second was &quot;The Little Valley Hub&quot; (operated from 1881 to 1968), and the most recent was the &quot;County Chronicle&quot;, which printed from 1992 to 2007, with some of the earlier years being based in Salamanca.

The Crosby&#x27;s convenience store chain was founded in Little Valley in 1966, where its first store opened. The store was sold to a Lockport-based company in 2006, which used the Crosby&#x27;s name for all of its stores after the purchase. Crosby&#x27;s continues to have a store in Little Valley; its original location, a Quonset hut, has since been decommissioned.

Bush Industries operated a factory in the village until it closed in 2007.

===Religion===
Four churches operate within the village bounds: a Wesleyan Church, a congregational church, an independent Methodist church (Bridge of Hope, which separated from the United Methodist Church circa 2023), and a King James Only Independent Baptist church (Grace Bible Baptist). The village is also served by various churches surrounding the village in the towns of Little Valley and Mansfield.

The local Catholic Church, St. Mary&#x27;s, closed in the late 2000s as part of the church&#x27;s overall U.S. downsizing effort, and all of its congregation was directed to the identically named St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in Cattaraugus. The Lutherans also had a church in the village that was closed shortly after the closure of St. Mary&#x27;s; its church building is now owned by Grace Bible Baptist.

===Education===
Public school students attend Cattaraugus-Little Valley Central School in Cattaraugus. Little Valley Central School operated in the village until 2000, shortly after voters approved a merger with Cattaraugus Central School. The district continued to operate an elementary school in the village until 2012 when it was controversially closed. The former school building is currently used by the county for offices it cannot accommodate at the county center; the former school&#x27;s alumni association maintains a small museum in one of the rooms.

Grace Christian Academy, which is affiliated with Grace Bible Baptist, operates a small private Christian school in the village.

===Sports and recreation===
Little Valley features teams in Little League Baseball and softball, as well as youth soccer. The Valley Thunder baseball club represented the village in Town Team Baseball in 2014, playing its games in Cattaraugus due to the lack of a regulation field in the village or town of Little Valley. The Thunder folded in 2015; that year and the next, a slow-pitch softball team represented the village in a local league also based in Cattaraugus.

The village supported the Little Valley Panthers youth football squad. Through 2014, the team played and practiced in Little Valley; in 2015, it was forced to move its games to Cattaraugus, and in 2016, the team was merged with Cattaraugus&#x27;s.

The village has three public parks: a small unnamed park in the center of the village, Bicentennial Park on the village&#x27;s west side adjacent to the County Center, and Eric Peters Memorial Park on the east side of the village. Memorial Park encompasses a public swimming pool, a walking trail, beach volleyball court and Little League Baseball diamond. An additional state-owned park and pavilion is located on the Pat McGee Trail. The Lyle Underwood Memorial facility includes a weight room and, when weather permits, an ice skating pond; the weight room was dismantled after a private investor opened up a commercial gym elsewhere in the village in 2023.

<text>Little Valley is a town in Cattaraugus County, New York, United States. The population was 1,672 at the 2020 census. The town is named after its local geographical setting, a relative comparison of two tributaries (the other being the neighboring Great Valley) of the Allegheny River.

The town of Little Valley is centrally located in the county, north of the city of Salamanca. The town contains a village also named Little Valley, which is the county seat.

== History ==

The first settlement was made &quot;circa&quot; 1807, but was vacated due to frontier warfare in the War of 1812; settlement resumed in 1816, after the war ended. The town of Little Valley was formed in 1818 by splitting the town of Perry, which at the time covered the entire western half of the county. The northwest quadrant of the county became Perrysburg, while the southwest quadrant became Little Valley (also known as the town of Elkdale); at the same time, the town of Great Valley was split off from Olean, and the two towns&#x27; proximity and comparable topography gave the towns their names. Little Valley was once an important rail station on the Erie Railroad and notable for its cheese and dairy industry. The location of the railroad resulted in moving the county seat to the village of Little Valley, which was also later connected to Salamanca by a streetcar line.

The towns of Conewango (1823), Napoli (1823), Mansfield (1830), New Albion (1830), and Bucktooth (1855, renamed Salamanca in 1864) were all formed from Little Valley.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which , or 0.02%, is water.

New York State Route 242 and New York State Route 353 are major truck roads through the town. They converge at Killborn Corners just east of the village of Little Valley. County Routes 88 (Baker Road) and 96 (Killborn Corners Road) act as bypasses. County Route 15 (Dublin Road), which picks up where Route 88 leaves off, continues northeast parallel to Route 242 between Little Valley and Ellicottville. County Routes 5 and 14 start in the northwest corner of the town and head toward New Albion and East Otto, respectively.

The Pat McGee Trail, a hiking and snowmobile rail trail that follows the path of the now-removed railroad, runs through the town parallel to Route 353. The Conservation Trail, a subset of the Finger Lakes Trail (itself a subset of the North Country Trail), passes through the town connecting the state forests therein; the two trails share a roughly one-mile wrong-way concurrency in the town.

Little Valley Creek flows through the town, as does a small tributary named Lees Hollow in the west central part of town. Whig Street Creek runs northeast-to-southwest across the town.

=== Adjacent towns and areas ===
Little Valley is north of the town of Salamanca and south of the town of Mansfield. The town is east of the town of Napoli and west of the town of Great Valley; a series of hills separate Little Valley and Great Valley, and they can only be traveled between each other directly through one seasonal highway (Mutton Hollow Road) or by a network of pedestrian, bicycle and horse trails. (Otherwise, major highways run through either Salamanca or Ellicottville.)

<text>Olean ( ) is a town in Cattaraugus County, New York, United States. The name is derived from the Latin word &quot;oleum&quot; due to the discovery of crude oil in nearby Ischua.

The town of Olean is in the southeast corner of the county. The city of Olean, originally the village of Olean, is bordered by the town on three sides.

== History ==
The area of Olean was first settled &quot;circa&quot; 1805. The town of Olean was established in 1808 from Batavia as the first town in the county. The northern part of the county was spun off as the town of Hebe in 1812; the western part became the town of Perry (later Perrysburg) in 1814, Great Valley was formed in 1818, Hinsdale in 1820, and Portville in 1837.

The village of Olean was originally named &quot;Hamilton&quot;, after Alexander Hamilton. The United States Postal Service imposed the name Olean in 1817 to prevent confusion with Hamilton, Madison County, New York; no municipal law was ever passed changing the name. The name &quot;Olean&quot; was suggested for the area due to the oil found in the vicinity. The famed Wenro Oil Spring, discovered by the Franciscan missionary Joseph de La Roche Daillon in 1627, was located approximately upstream (northeast) of Olean Point. The original town hall burned in 1884, prompting a law that forbade wooden structures in parts of the town.

Notable inhabitants of the town have included Claude Allen, an Olympic athlete, and Catharine Young, a New York state senator.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.43%, is water.

The Allegheny River flows west through the town. The south town line is the border of Pennsylvania. The Southern Tier Expressway (Interstate 86 and New York State Route 17), New York State Route 16, and New York State Route 417 pass through the town.

<text>Olean ( ) is a city in Cattaraugus County, New York, United States. Olean is the largest city in Cattaraugus County and serves as its financial, business, transportation and entertainment center. It is one of the principal cities of the Southern Tier region of Western New York.

The city is surrounded by the town of Olean and is located in the southeastern part of Cattaraugus County.

==History==
The first European in the area was possibly Joseph de La Roche Daillon, a missionary and explorer from Canada. La Roche reported on the presence of oil near Cuba, the first petroleum sighting in North America. At that time the area was a part of the territory of the Wenrohronon or Wenro Indians, an Iroquois speaking people. In 1643, the Wenro tribes became the first victims of a series of brutal conflicts known as the Second Beaver War.

The area was first settled by Europeans around 1765, called by the Indian name &quot;Ischua&quot;. Officially, this was illegal, as the British had declared the land in the Allegheny River watershed to be part of the Indian Reserve after conquering the territory in the French and Indian War two years prior. The surface is a hilly upland, separated into two distinct parts by the valley of the Allegheny. The highest points are above the valley. During the American Revolutionary War, the 1779 Sullivan Expedition established the first road to what would become Olean, blazing a trail to what is now Kittanning, Pennsylvania along the path of what is now New York State Route 16.

Originally the entire territory of the county of Cattaraugus was called the Town of Olean, formed March 11, 1808. As population allowed, the county was split in half and the top half was called &quot;Hebe&quot;, and was taken off in 1812, a part of Perrysburgh in 1814, then Great Valley in 1818. Hinsdale formed in 1820, and Portville in 1837, leaving the current boundary of Olean that lies upon the south line of the county, near the southeast corner. The area remained sparsely populated until 1804, when Major Adam Hoops acquired the land and gave it its modern name. Hoops was a surveyor and Revolutionary War veteran, and was politically connected with Robert Morris, the financier of the Revolution. Along with Morris, Hoops became involved with the Holland Land Company, which was settling western New York.

This was a time of great western expansion into places such as Ohio and Indiana. Since neither canals nor railroads had become widespread by this point, the main means of travel was either by cart or small-boat travel. The Allegheny River was a major transportation route. Hoops believed that a great city could be created at the confluence of the Allegheny and one of its tributaries and went looking for the right spot. In 1804 he found a spot where Olean Creek meets the river; the confluence was important as it was the farthest point downstream in the state before hitting the Seneca Reservation that surrounded most of New York&#x27;s piece of the river. Hoops received title to from the Holland Land Company in 1804. Hoops&#x27; brother Robert came to the site and built the first permanent structure near today&#x27;s Forness Park, calling the area &quot;Hamilton&quot; in honor of Alexander Hamilton.

In a letter to Joseph Ellicott in 1804, Hoops discusses the name &quot;Olean&quot; from the local Oil Springs and the Latin word &quot;oleum&quot;:

Canandaigua, N.Y., April 15, 1804
&quot;To Joseph ELLICOTT, Esq., Batavia, New York.
Dear Sir,―It was proposed to me at New York to drop the Indian name of Ischue or Ischua (it is also spelt other ways). Confusion might arise from the various spellings, of which to obviate all risk I have concluded so to do as proposed. The neighborhood of the oil spring suggests a name different in sound, though perhaps not different in meaning, which I wish to adopt,―it is &quot;Olean.&quot; You will do me a favor by assisting me to establish this name. It may easily be done now by your concurrence. The purpose will be most effectually answered by employing the term, when occasion requires, without saying anything of an intended change of name. To begin, you will greatly oblige me by addressing the first letter you may have occasion to write to me, after I receive the survey, to the Mouth of Olean. The bearer being properly instructed, there will be thereafter no difficulty. Your co-operation in the matter (the effect of which, though not important in itself, may be so on account of precision) will oblige. Your servant, A. HOOPS

The Post Office recognized the new town as &quot;Olean Point&quot;. The site was surveyed by 1808, and a map from that year shows a basic street pattern that still survives, along with most of the modern street names. In 1823, the city is called Olean, without the &quot;Point&quot;, on county maps.

In 1854 Olean was formally incorporated by the New York State Legislature, and the trustees elected at the first subsequent town meeting were Lambert Thithney, C.B.B. Barse, Charles Thing, and John K. Comstock. Enos C. Brooks was appointed clerk of Olean.

===Timber and railroads===
Adam Hoops&#x27;s dream of creating a major transportation hub on the Allegheny River, on the scale of a Buffalo or a Pittsburgh, was never realized and he himself died in poverty. Nonetheless, Olean prospered and was soon the central town of the region. Olean grew quickly as a transportation hub for migrants taking the Allegheny River into Ohio. For much of this era Olean was larger and better known than its northern competitor Buffalo. This period ended with the creation of the great canals, especially the Erie Canal in 1825. The Allegheny River was usually too shallow for the larger steamboats to navigate, except in the spring, and only two steamboats—the &quot;Allegheny&quot; in 1830 and the &quot;New Castle&quot; of 1837—reached the city. A Genesee Valley Canal was extended to Olean and the Allegheny River in 1862, but the Allegheny&#x27;s shallowness and the rise of the railroads rendered it obsolete before it even opened.

Timber was a major industry in New York and Pennsylvania between 1830 and 1850, and Olean was the chief timber town in the region during those times. After river travel declined Olean became the regional railroad hub. The town was the crossroads of several railroads, a situation which endures into today with the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad.

Olean was the home of several corporations. During the late-19th century, Olean had a few mills, a bicycle company, a manufacturer of mechanical pumps and a glass works, among other factories. St. Bonaventure University was founded just outside town in 1858. Olean was incorporated as a village in 1854, and as a city in 1893. Olean was a rival of the comparably-populated, but much newer, city of Salamanca, New York at the turn of the 20th century, but the decline of the timber industry in southwestern Cattaraugus County and complications with Salamanca being situated on borrowed Seneca Nation land allowed Olean to continue growing while Salamanca declined.

===Oil and rum-running===
Oil was first discovered in the region by a French explorer in 1632, but it was rediscovered for commercial use during the Pennsylvania oil rush. Oil became the city&#x27;s claim to fame for fifty years.

Olean was the railroad and pipeline hub for the surrounding oil region. The operations HQ of Standard Oil&#x27;s New York affiliate, Socony, was based in the city. Oil produced on both sides of the state line (e.g. in Bradford, Pennsylvania) would be transported to Olean for rail travel. For a short time, Olean was the world&#x27;s largest oil depot, complete with a &quot;tank city&quot; on the edge of town. A pipeline was also built linking the city to Standard Oil refineries in Bayonne, New Jersey. The oil industry maintained a presence in the city until 1954, the same year in which Olean&#x27;s population peaked.

Oil also produced Olean&#x27;s highest-ranking politician. Oil executive Frank W. Higgins was governor of New York in 1905–1907. Higgins&#x27; family owned grocery stores in the area, and Higgins also ran this business before his political career. To this day, Olean is one of the few smaller cities in New York State to be home to a governor.

Olean garnered notoriety as a major stop on bootlegging routes during Prohibition through the 1920s until 1933. Dempsey, the Chief of Police, did not condone these thugs or their illegal activities. He did not aggressively pursue arrests, however, unless he had evidence that the violator was responsible for a crime committed in his jurisdiction. As long as you kept your nose clean in the Olean City limits, it was a &quot;safe haven&quot;. Local stories relating to this period are numerous. Some are documented and some are legends. Olean, located on a back-road route between Chicago and New York City, was often frequented by famous mobsters of the era. Al Capone of Chicago, probably the most famous gang leader of the time, visited Olean in pursuance of his illegal endeavors. Olean was nicknamed &quot;Little Chicago&quot; in the press, due to its connection with mobsters and bootleggers, and Capone was a frequent visitor.

In September 1968, Olean was the first city in the United States to install video cameras along its main business street in an effort to fight crime.

<text>Perrysburg is a hamlet, census-designated place, and former village in Cattaraugus County, New York, United States. The population was 401 at the 2010 census. It is named after Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry. The community is in the south-central part of the town of Perrysburg. The hamlet is west of Gowanda.

== History ==
A settlement has been located in the general area of the current village since the early 19th century. Early settlers included veterans of the War for American Independence and the War of 1812, who had used their pensions to buy farmland through the Holland Land Company. The village of Perrysburg was incorporated in 1916. Both the village and the town have been spelled &quot;Perrysburgh&quot; in the past.

By 1880, the population of the village of Perrysburg was about 400, with many more living in the surrounding town. It was also a station stop on the New York &amp; Erie Railroad.

In 1910, the city of Buffalo, beset by the public scourge of tuberculosis, purchased almost of land adjacent to the village using proceeds from Mayor James Noble Adam&#x27;s personal fortune, for the purpose of establishing the Buffalo Municipal Hospital for Incipient Tuberculosis. The facility opened in 1912 and later became the J. N. Adam Memorial Hospital. The presence of the hospital led to a dramatic increase in the local population with the arrival of medical professionals, hospital workers and people visiting patients at the facility.

Since the hospital closed its doors, a popular local legend holds that a stained glass dome in the Hall Rotunda was salvaged from the Temple of Music at Buffalo&#x27;s Pan-American Exposition. However, a visual comparison between the surviving dome and this rendering shows no resemblance between the two.

On March 16, 2010, voters approved, by a 60-9 margin, a referendum to dissolve the village into the town of Perrysburg. The dissolution took effect at the end of 2011. Perrysburg joined Randolph, East Randolph and Limestone among Cattaraugus County villages that voted to dissolve within a six-month span, with all but Limestone having approved their dissolutions on March 16.

<text>Perrysburg is a town in Cattaraugus County, New York, United States. The population was 1,515 at the 2020 census. The town is named after Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry and is located in the northwest corner of the county. The town contains the census-designated place also named Perrysburg, formerly an incorporated village.

== History ==

The town of Perrysburg was formed in 1814 as the &quot;town of Perry&quot; from the towns of Hebe and Olean. It originally consisted of the entire western half of the county and was created because the county did not yet have a centralized government; Hebe and Olean were administered as part of Allegany County. Perry was governed as part of Niagara County (which at the time also covered the entirety of what is now Erie County) until Cattaraugus County achieved self-government in 1817.

In 1818, the same year Little Valley and Great Valley were split off to govern the southwest part of the county, the town changed its name to &quot;Perrysburgh&quot;. Eventually, likely at the behest of the United States Board on Geographic Names during the Benjamin Harrison administration in the 1890s, the spelling became &quot;Perrysburg.&quot; Over the course of the 19th century, the town was divided to form what are now all of the towns in northwestern Cattaraugus County: Dayton, Persia, Otto, East Otto, Mansfield, New Albion, and Leon.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.44%, is water.

The northern border is Cattaraugus Creek with Erie County on the opposite bank. The western border is Chautauqua County.

The town&#x27;s geographic location results in frequent and heavy lake-effect snow events during the fall and winter. It is often the site for maximum snowfall accumulations. A hill rising to over on the southern edge of the town contributes to orographic enhancement, intensifying snowfall. From December 10 through December 17, 2013, nearly () of snow fell on the town, with the majority of it being lake-effect snow. Some locals have named Perrysburg the snow capital of Western New York.

New York State Route 39 is an east-west highway through the town.

=== Adjacent towns and areas ===
To the west is the town of Hanover in Chautauqua County. The southern border is formed with the town of Dayton. The eastern border is the town of Persia and the village of Gowanda. The northern border is formed with the Cattaraugus Reservation and the town of Brant in Erie County.

<text>Salamanca is a town in Cattaraugus County, New York, United States. The population was 470 at the 2020 census. The name is from José de Salamanca y Mayol, Marquis of Salamanca, a major Spanish investor in the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad, a local railroad.

The town of Salamanca is in the south part of the county. The city of Salamanca, located within the Allegany Indian Reservation of the Seneca Nation of Indians, bisects the town.

== History ==
This was historically the territory of the Native American Wenrohronon and Eriehronon, who were driven out by the Seneca Nation in the Beaver Wars of the 1650s. The Seneca controlled much of the territory of western New York as one of the nations of the powerful Iroquois Confederacy. The area was not settled by European Americans until after the American Revolution around 1815, when the Seneca had been forced to cede their lands to the United States and New York as allies of the defeated British. Many of the early arrivals were whites who settled on Native American land with the informal permission and toleration of tribal members.

The area was a sparsely populated, rural, farming and lumber industry region until four railroads were constructed into the area. They leased a portion of land, then mostly swamp, from the Seneca Nation to make their hub at what was developed as Salamanca.

The town of Salamanca was formed in 1854 from part of the town of Little Valley. At that time it was called the &quot;town of Bucktooth&quot;, named after a notable Seneca who lived in the area. At least two roads leading to the town still bear the name &quot;Bucktooth Run&quot;. In 1869, the town of Red House was created, taking away the south part of the town of Salamanca. In 1870 the community of Salamanca began to define itself, first as a village, and later as a city.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

New York State Route 353 is a north-south highway in the town. The Southern Tier Expressway (Interstate 86) runs through the Seneca reservation in the middle of the town. New York State Route 417 closely parallels the expressway. Route 951T (Old Route 17) serves the southwestern portion of the town.

== Adjacent towns and areas ==
The town of Salamanca is divided into two parts by the Allegany Reservation, which is a sovereign part of the Seneca Nation. This division parallels the Allegheny River. The city of Salamanca is also located in the split between the two portions of the town. North of the town is Little Valley, and south is the town of Red House.

<text>Salamanca (Seneca: &quot;Onë&#x27;dagö:h&quot;) is a city in Cattaraugus County, New York, United States, inside the Allegany Indian Reservation, one of two governed by the Seneca Nation of New York. The population was 5,929 at the 2020 census. It was named after José de Salamanca, a Spanish nobleman and cabinet minister of the mid-19th century. Salamanca invested in railroads around the globe, including the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad in New York State, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and , or 3.88%, is water.

Salamanca is within the Allegany Indian Reservation of the Seneca Nation of New York (one of the six tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy). The city population of about 5,900 is about 19% Native American; this does not include Seneca people living in the nearby hamlets of Jimerson Town (one of the two capitals of the nation) and Kill Buck. The city lies along the Allegheny River and is adjacent to Allegany State Park.

Salamanca is one of the two cities in Cattaraugus County, the other being Olean.

==Climate==
== History ==
What is now known as the city of Salamanca was originally two separate communities, one on Little Valley Creek and the other on Great Valley Creek; the westernmost one of the two was called &quot;Hemlock&quot;, a name derived from the numerous hemlock trees throughout the surrounding mountains. The eastern community (from modern-day Conrath Avenue eastward) was Kill Buck&#x27;s Town; the eastern half of what is now Kill Buck remains an unincorporated hamlet independent of the city of Salamanca. Hemlock was later renamed &quot;West Salamanca&quot; and (although it was marked on road signs as late as the 1990s) was eventually incorporated into the single city of Salamanca. The city was incorporated in 1913. 

At one time the city was a thriving railroad hub, with the Erie Railroad (later Conrail), Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway (BR&amp;P) (later Baltimore and Ohio Railroad) both having facilities there. Generations of Salamanca residents worked for the railroads, and much of the housing was originally built for them by the railroads. The city also benefited from the then-thriving lumber industry that dominated much of southwestern Cattaraugus County at the turn of the century, as boomtowns along the Allegheny River such as Elko, South Valley and Red House (all much-less populated ghost towns today) all used the railroads to ship their goods upstream. At the time of the city&#x27;s incorporation, it peaked at under 10,000 residents, not far behind Olean, 19 miles to the east, the major hub of the county; Olean, however, would continue to grow rapidly into the 1950s, while Salamanca&#x27;s population would begin falling behind almost immediately. The Salamanca Rail Museum was opened in the former BR&amp;P depot in 1984 to house its archives.

The majority of the city, with the exception of a northeastern spur along Great Valley Creek, was constructed on the Allegany Indian Reservation held by the Seneca Nation of New York, as established in various treaties. Under the nation&#x27;s policy, non-Seneca residents are barred from owning real property on the reservation, and non-Senecas can only lease the property from the Seneca Nation. As arranged by the railroads, the previous leases had nominal payments and covered only the land; improvements (i.e., buildings and houses) were considered to be owned by the non-native citizens.

When the leases expired in the early 1990s, the nation tried to gain more from its leases, raising their costs and asserting not only the land, but the improvements were also subject to the native leases. Numerous people living in the city did not agree on the amount of lease payments or the legitimacy of the Senecas&#x27; absolute ownership claim. The controversy aroused bitterness, lawsuits, and appeals to government officials. Congress passed a law explicitly placing the improvements under Seneca jurisdiction, the new leases were put into effect, and fifteen houses were seized and their owners evicted for refusing to sign the leases. The current leases are in effect until 2030, with an option to extend until 2070; proceeds from the lease payments are distributed quarterly to enrolled Seneca Nation members, providing a basic income guarantee.

Despite the lack of ownership, leased land held by non-Senecas is subject to property tax, which the lessee must pay to the city, Cattaraugus County and the Salamanca City Central School District. Seneca-owned land is exempt under the Treaty of Buffalo Creek. Once a Seneca acquires the land, it is taken off the tax rolls; for this reason, the city of Salamanca does not auction-off abandoned properties on the reservation in a property-tax auction, for fear Seneca individuals will buy the land, removing it from the tax rolls.

==Government==
The city has a council-mayor system, with the mayor elected at-large and five trustees selected from wards, generally numbered from west to east.

&quot;Between 2004-05 and 2009-10, State aid for the City, including casino revenues, increased by an average annual rate of nearly 50 percent (starting at $0.8 million in 2004-05 and peaking at $7.3 million in 2008-09). Salamanca’s average annual expenditure increases on debt service, general government, transportation, utilities and public safety between 2004-05 and 2009-10 were all in the double digits.&quot; This was attributable to revenues from the Seneca Allegany Casino.

===Casino revenues===
The Seneca Nation opened a gambling casino in Salamanca in May 2004. About 1,000 new jobs were created by the casino operation, resulting in a housing shortage in the small town as new workers entered the city. Under the arrangement with the state, a 25% share of the casino&#x27;s revenue goes to the city and county, which they can use for needed projects. Revenues for the city increased dramatically (see above).

Significant change did not quickly take place in the city, with new construction in only a few select areas. Main Street and US Route 219 (which runs through the city) remain largely untouched. Redevelopment was delayed when the Nation stopped casino payments in late 2010, in a dispute with the state over its opening racinos elsewhere in the state; payments were resumed in 2013. The state provided the city with emergency funds to help support it until the dispute was settled. The Senecas again announced it would halt payments to the state in 2017, stating that a clause in the gaming compact had expired and its obligation to continue paying the state was no longer in effect. The Seneca Nation and the state of New York agreed to a settlement in January 2022, with the Senecas agreeing to pay the money owed, ahead of negotiations for a renewal of the compact in 2023.

Because of the contentious relations between Seneca and non-Seneca residents, columnist Selena Zito described Salamanca as a &quot;failed American city&quot; in 2011, in a column that soon drew the rebuke of city officials.

==Economy==
Retail shops include several Seneca-owned cigarette, tobacco, coffee shops, and gas stations; there are several empty storefronts, especially in the city&#x27;s central business district on and near Main Street. The Seneca Nation has made efforts to diversify, establishing a tribal holding company in 2009 and an economic development corporation in 2011. In 2021, many of the city&#x27;s vacant buildings and former smoke shops were converted into cannabis dispensaries, leading to a glut of retailers for the recently legalized product.

The city&#x27;s only shopping mall, Salamanca Mall, hosts a regional hardware chain, a local antique shop, and a small taqueria called &quot;Rock&#x27;n Taco&quot;. Three hotels operate in the city.

A number of industrial factories, among them McHone Industries (a metal fabricating company) and Salamanca Lumber, operate in the center part of the city.

==Transportation==

=== Ground ===
The Southern Tier Expressway (Interstate 86 and New York State Route 17) passes south of the city. Running through the city are U.S. Route 219 and New York State Routes 417 and 353, the last two of which terminate within a mile of each other on Salamanca&#x27;s west end.

Salamanca serves as a hub for the area&#x27;s public bus service. Coach USA, Fullington Trailways, the Seneca Transit System, and the Olean Area Transit System all converge on the city. The city&#x27;s only active (freight) rail depot is on the east side of the city, serviced by the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad.

In the past, the Erie Railroad and then, starting in 1960, the Erie Lackawanna Railway had operated passenger trains through Salamanca. Into the 1960s, the &quot;Erie Limited&quot; and the &quot;Atlantic Express&quot;/&quot;Pacific Express&quot; made stops there. The last passenger train making stops there was the &quot;Lake Cities&quot; which was discontinued on January 6, 1970. The New York and Lake Erie Railroad operated between Salamanca and Gowanda until 1990. Today, the station houses the Salamanca Rail Museum. Two miles to the east, the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway had an &quot;East Salamanca&quot; station. The successor railroad, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad last had passenger trains at the latter in the mid-1950s. Into the early 1940s, the Pennsylvania Railroad ran passenger trains into a third station for trains between Olean and Oil City, Pennsylvania.

Two of the former rail rights-of-way are now rail trails: the NY&amp;LE right-of-way is now the state-owned Pat McGee Trail (which officially ends at the city line before entering the city) and the Pennsylvania Railroad path is now the Pennsy Trail. The Finger Lakes Trail also cuts across the city, mainly using city roads.

=== Air ===
Salamanca has no local major airports. Although Great Valley Airport is nearby, this airport is mostly used for general aviation, and no commercial passenger service operates out of it. The nearest public airports are Buffalo Niagara International Airport and Bradford Regional Airport.

==Religion==
The Catholic Church, Southern Baptist Convention (House of Prayer), Seventh-day Adventists, Free Methodist Church, and Lighthouse Baptist Church all have branches in the city bounds. At least two other independent churches also operate; the local United Methodist Church disaffiliated in the late 2010s.

==Media==
Radio stations WQRS (on the FM band at 98.3) and WGGO (on the AM band at 1590) are licensed to Salamanca. WQRS (The Goat, historically known as 98 Rocks) carries a classic rock format run by Seven Mountains Media out of Olean; WGGO is an owned and operated station of The Station of the Cross, a regional Catholic radio network, with its nominal studio in Kill Buck. W288EK (FM 105.5) is also licensed to Salamanca and simulcasts WOLY (Big Oly), another Seven Mountains station out of Olean.

From 2010 to 2021, WGWE (FM 105.9) was operated out of Salamanca. The station, licensed to Little Valley, shut down and sold its assets to a broadcaster who plans to operate the station elsewhere.

The &quot;Salamanca Press&quot; is the local newspaper. A daily paper (publishing Monday through Saturday) for most of the 20th century, the paper reverted to a weekly publication in 2009.

There is no direct television broadcasting in Salamanca; the city is ostensibly part of the Buffalo media market, and local cable and satellite providers carry those stations (as well as some from Erie, Pennsylvania and Toronto, Ontario), but the hilly terrain around the city makes television reception problematic. Two low-powered stations based in Olean can occasionally be received over the air. Breezeline is the local cable provider.

<text>Cato is a village in Cayuga County, New York, United States. The population was 532 at the 2010 census. The name was assigned by the surveyors of the Military Tract, and is one of many towns and villages bearing classical place names. The village of Cato is half within the town of Cato and half within the town of Ira. It is west of Syracuse.

== History ==
The village was part of the Central New York Military Tract, land set aside in 1782 for veterans of the American Revolution. Prior native occupants were compelled to live on reservations established at that time. The first permanent settler arrived around 1805, and the new community was called &quot;Jakway&#x27;s Corners&quot;.

Railroad service came to the village in 1869, aiding its prosperity, but rail service ended in 1953.

Cato is home to the 1993 Section 3 Class D state football champions. Modern Cato is partly a bedroom community, with many residents commuting to surrounding cities.

The village is at the junction of NY-34 and NY-370. Locating places within the village is extremely simple, since virtually all locations which may be visited by a non-resident are located on these two highways.

==Water tower==
The Cato water tower stands over the village of Cato, to the northeast of the village center. The light blue structure had been a landmark for 75 years or more but was to be torn down as of June 2012. The new water tower was to be dark blue on top and still say &quot;Cato&quot; on both sides.

<text>Dunkirk is a city in Chautauqua County, New York, United States. It was settled around 1805 and incorporated in 1880. The population was 12,743 as of the 2020 census. Dunkirk is bordered on the north by Lake Erie. It shares a border with the village of Fredonia to the south, and with the town of Dunkirk to the east and west. Dunkirk is the westernmost city in the state of New York.

==History==
The Iroquoian languages-speaking Erie people occupied this area of the forested lakefront along the southern shore of Lake Erie well into the 1600s, when Europeans, mostly French, started trading around the Great Lakes. They were pushed out by the Seneca people, one of the Five Nations of the powerful Iroquois League, based here and further east in New York.
The European-American demarcation and settlement of Chadwick Bay began in 1826. and later the town was named after Dunkirk in France


The Dunkirk Lighthouse at Point Gratiot was built soon after and still stands. Dunkirk served as a minor railroad hub and steamship port on Lake Erie into the early 1900s. Both freight and passenger ships traveled the lakes.

The Chautauqua County Fair, which had been held sporadically over the years starting in 1821, was first held regularly in Dunkirk in 1881 on land acquired for its permanent use.

A major employer in Dunkirk in the second half of the 19th century was Brooks Locomotive Works, founded in 1869 by Horatio G. Brooks. The Brooks plant built almost 4,000 steam locomotives, for which they won several awards at international exhibitions, and a few of their locomotives were hailed as the fastest and largest locomotives in the world. Brooks Locomotive Works was merged into American Locomotive Company in 1901. The homestead of Horatio G. Brooks became the Brooks Memorial Hospital following a donation by Brooks&#x27;s daughter in 1898.

The city thrived as a steel town for Roebling and others through the 1950s. In addition, it was a manufacturing leader with Plymouth Tube and Ralston Purina. Its coal-burning Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation plant provided power for the region. The plant was mothballed in 2016, negatively impacting Dunkirk&#x27;s tax base. NRG Energy acquired the plant and proceeded with plans to convert it from coal-burning to run on natural gas. Since the 1970s, population has declined following a regional drop in manufacturing as the steel industry and other restructured. Overall employment has declined in the area.

Dunkirk gained international recognition in 1946 for the Dunkirk-to-Dunkerque campaign. It was a humanitarian assistance program for its namesake and sister city, Dunkerque, France, which had been devastated in World War II. Dunkirk-to-Dunkerque became the model for similar relief efforts in cities elsewhere in the United States.

Beginning in the 1980s, the city refocused its economic efforts on revitalizing its pier and fishing, to improve the quality of life for residents and attract more tourists. In addition, in 2016 it attracted a high-tech drug manufacturing project as part of business related to the state project of area investment called the &quot;Buffalo Billion.&quot;

In 2016, Willie Rosas, a former law enforcement officer, became the first Hispanic to be elected mayor in the State of New York.

Nickel Plate and Pennsylvania Railroad trains stopped at another station. As recently as 1968 the New York Central operated a Buffalo-Chicago daytime train, #51, the former &quot;Empire State Express,&quot; that made a stop westbound in Dunkirk. Two other daily trains eastbound stopped in Dunkirk, #64 and #90, the former &quot;Chicagoan.&quot; In the late 1990s Amtrak considered adding the city as a stop between Buffalo and Erie. Dunkirk was listed as a stop with service &quot;to commence on a date to be announced&quot; on several timetables, but the stop was never added.

<text>Westfield is a village in Chautauqua County, New York, United States. The population was 2993 at the 2020 census. The village lies within the town of Westfield in the northern part of the county.

The village is known as the &quot;grape juice capital of the world&quot; because it lies roughly in the geographical center of of vineyards, most of which are the Concord grapes from which grape juice is produced, for years was corporate headquarters for the Welch&#x27;s Grape Juice company, and is still home to a Welch&#x27;s processing plant and other grape-related manufacturers.

Significant institutions in the village include the McClurg Mansion, Westfield Memorial Hospital, Westfield Academy and Central School (no longer an &quot;academy&quot; in any formal, 19th cenyury sense), and the Patterson Library.

== History ==

The community was settled in 1802 and was formerly known as &quot;Crossroads&quot;. The village of Westfield was incorporated in 1833. The discovery of a pasteurization method for grape juice made by the Welch family promoted the production of grapes for this purpose in this region.

It was here in 1861 that Abraham Lincoln met a little girl named Grace Bedell, who, during the preceding year&#x27;s presidential campaign, urged Lincoln by letter to grow his beard out fully as an attempt to improve his chances at being elected. Lincoln responded by brief letter thanking Grace for the suggestion. He made no promises but shortly afterwards allowed his beard to grow, and by the time he began his inaugural journey by train from Illinois to Washington, D.C., he had a full beard. The trip took him through New York State, and included a stop in Westfield, where thousands gathered to meet the President-Elect. Lincoln asked by name to meet Grace Bedell.

The February 19, 1861, edition of the &quot;New York World&quot; recounted the meeting as follows: 
&quot;At Westfield an interesting incident occurred. Shortly after his nomination Mr. Lincoln had received from that place a letter from a little girl, who urged him, as a means of improving his personal appearance, to wear whiskers. Mr. Lincoln at the time replied, stating that although he was obliged by the suggestion, he feared his habits of life were too fixed to admit of even so slight a change as that which letting his beard grow involved. To-day, on reaching the place, he related the incident, and said that if that young lady was in the crowd he should be glad to see her. There was a momentary commotion, in the midst of which an old man, struggling through the crowd, approached, leading his daughter, a girl of apparently twelve or thirteen years of age, whom he introduced to Mr. Lincoln as his Westfield correspondent. Mr. Lincoln stooped down and kissed the child, and talked with her for some minutes. Her advice had not been thrown away upon the rugged chieftain. A beard of several months&#x27; growth covers (perhaps adorns) the lower part of his face. The young girl&#x27;s peachy cheek must have been tickled with a stiff whisker, for the growth of which she was herself responsible.&quot;
Today there is a small park in Westfield commemorating this meeting, on the former site of the Grand Theatre movie house.

The celebrated author of juvenile adventure novels, Charles Austin Fosdick, better known by his pen name, Harry Castlemon, lived in Westfield for most of his adult life and is buried in the Westfield Cemetery. He was the most-read author for boys in the post-Civil War era.

<text>Westfield is a town in the western part of Chautauqua County, New York, United States. The population was 4,513 at the 2020 census. Westfield is also the name of a village within the town, containing 65% of the town&#x27;s population. This unique town is accompanied by vineyards, gorges and historical buildings.

== History ==
The area was first settled in 1802 by James McMahan, formerly of Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. McMahan established a mill near the mouth of Chautauqua Creek, where it empties into Lake Erie. The mill was later dismantled in advance of the War of 1812 to prevent it falling into the hands of the British. Today some of the millstones from McMahan&#x27;s mill rest outside the Patterson Library in Westfield village.

The town of Westfield was established in 1828 from parts of the towns of Portland and Ripley.

The Barcelona Lighthouse was constructed in 1829 to overlook Barcelona Harbor and aided sailors on Lake Erie until being deactivated in 1859. It was the first lighthouse in the world to be powered by natural gas.

In 1897, the founder of Welch&#x27;s Grape Juice, Charles E. Welch, moved his company to Westfield from New Jersey to take advantage of the ideal climate for the cultivation of grapes, particularly of Concord grapes. The region soon became noted for the growing of grapes for both wine and grape juice.

An unusually large number of buildings, twenty in all, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, with all but one (the Barcelona Lighthouse, listed in 1972) being listed on the register in fall 1983.

<text>Elmira () is a city in and the county seat of Chemung County, New York, United States. It is the principal city of the Elmira, New York, metropolitan statistical area, which encompasses Chemung County. The population was 26,523 at the 2020 census, down from 29,200 at the 2010 census, a decline of more than 7 percent.

The City of Elmira is in the south-central part of the county, surrounded on three sides by the Town of Elmira. It is in the Southern Tier of New York, a short distance north of the Pennsylvania state line.

The city was the site of the Elmira Prison, a prisoner-of-war camp that held over 12,000 captured Confederate soldiers during the American Civil War. Elmira College is located within the city.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The region of Elmira was inhabited by the Cayuga nation (also known as the Kanawaholla) of the Haudenosaunee prior to European colonization. Cayuga residing in the region maintained relations with European settlers, primarily related to the fur trade, but were otherwise relatively isolated from encroaching colonial settlements.

During the American Revolutionary War, the Sullivan Expedition of 1779 was mounted by the Continental Army against the four Haudenosaunee nations which had allied with the British. The expeditionary force fought a combined British-Haudenosaunee force at the Battle of Newtown, south of the current city, in which the Continental Army was victorious. After the conclusion of the war, the Haudenosaunee and the United States signed a treaty at Elmira in 1791 to settle territorial disputes in the region. Most of the Cayuga emigrated under pressure from encroaching American settlements with the other nations of the Haudenosaunee to Canada, where they resettled on land provided by the British Crown.

The first European-American settler in Elmira was Abraham Miller, who served as a captain in the Continental Army. Miller constructed a cabin after resigning just before the end of the Revolutionary War. Miller&#x27;s Pond and Miller Street are named after him and are near the location of his house.

=== Elmira&#x27;s formation ===
The New York legislature established the Township of Chemung, now Chemung County, in 1788. The settlement of Newtown was soon established at the intersection of Newtown Creek and the Chemung River. In 1792, the settlement at Newtown joined with the Wisnerburg and DeWittsburg settlements to form the village of Newtown. In 1808, the village officially changed its name to the Town of Elmira, at a town meeting held at Teal&#x27;s Tavern. It is said the town was named after tavern owner Nathan Teal&#x27;s young daughter, but that story has never been confirmed. According to Amos Bugbee Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Carpenter Memorial&quot; family history book printed in 1898, Elmira is named after Major General Matthew Carpenter&#x27;s daughter. This naming occurred, according to this book, in 1821 at the constitutional convention to which Matthew was a delegate. In any case, the City of Elmira, nicknamed &quot;The Queen City,&quot; was incorporated in 1864 from part of the town of Elmira and the village of Elmira. The remaining part of the town of Elmira exists still, surrounding the city on the west, north and east. The city and town share an intricately entwined history.

It appears that Amos Carpenter in his 1898 book was referencing an 1879 book.

Elmira served as a transportation hub for New York&#x27;s Southern Tier in the 1800s, connecting commercial centers in Rochester and Buffalo with Albany and New York City, via the canal system and railroads. The city was the southern terminus of the Chemung Canal completed in 1833; later, the Junction Canal was constructed to connect Elmira with Corning, facilitating transport of coal from the Pennsylvania mines via the Northern branch of the Susquehanna Canal system. In 1849, the New York and Erie Railroad was built through Elmira, giving the area a New York City to Buffalo route. In 1850, the Elmira and Jefferson Railroad gave the area a route north and, in 1854, the Elmira and Williamsport Railroad a route south. These railroads and their connections made the city a prime location for an Army training and muster point early in the Civil War.

In 1872 construction began on the Utica, Ithaca and Elmira Railroad, eventually creating a route to Cortland and Syracuse via Horseheads, Breesport and Van Etten. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, completed in 1884, competed with the Erie&#x27;s New York City to Buffalo line.

===Prisoner-of-war camp===

A great deal of the Union installation, known as Camp Rathbun, fell into disuse as the Civil War progressed, and the camp&#x27;s &quot;Barracks #3&quot; were converted into a Civil War prisoner of war camp in the summer of 1864. The camp, in use from June 6, 1864, until autumn 1865, was dubbed &quot;Hellmira&quot; by its inmates. Towner&#x27;s history of 1892 and maps from the period indicate the camp occupied a somewhat irregular parallelogram, running about west and approximately the same distance south of a location several hundred feet west of Hoffman Street (Foster Avenue) and Winsor Avenue, bordered on the south by Foster&#x27;s Pond, on the north bank of the Chemung River.

In the months the site was used as a camp, 12,123 Confederate soldiers were incarcerated; of these, 2,963 died during their stay from a combination of malnutrition, prolonged exposure to brutal winter weather and disease directly attributable to the dismal sanitary conditions on Foster&#x27;s Pond and lack of medical care. The camp&#x27;s dead were prepared for burial and laid to rest by the sexton at Woodlawn National Cemetery, ex-slave John W. Jones. At the end of the war, each prisoner was given a loyalty oath and given a train ticket back home; the last prisoner left the camp on September 27, 1865. The camp was closed, demolished and converted to farmland. Woodlawn Cemetery, about north of the original prison camp site (bounded by West Hill, Bancroft, Davis and Mary Streets), was designated a &quot;National Cemetery&quot; in 1877. The prison camp site is today a residential area.

===Reformatory and correctional facility===

The state legislature authorized the building of a state prison for first offenders in 1866. It opened in 1876 as the Elmira Reformatory, under the direction of Zebulon Brockway, serving offenders aged sixteen to thirty. It was the first institution of its kind, and a model for others to follow. In 1970 the complex was renamed the Elmira Correctional and Reception Center.

=== Elmira economy ===
In 1950, the Elmira&#x27;s population peaked at about 50,000, which represented 57 percent of Chemung County&#x27;s total population at the time. Today, the city has approximately 25,000 residents, which represents 34 percent of Chemung County&#x27;s population. This population decline is due to the national decline in railroads and manufacturing as well as a population shift to the outer suburbs around Elmira. The Elmira Metro area has nearly 100,000 people.

The population decline began during the recession of the early 1970s during which several large employers (Ann Page, American Bridge, General Electric, American LaFrance, Westinghouse and Remington Rand) either closed their factories or moved to other states. The decline was exacerbated by the flood of 1972, during which many of the downtown businesses and single-family homes were destroyed or replaced by subsequent Urban Renewal projects in the Chemung River flood plain.

==== Current manufacturing employers ====

Trayer Products, established in 1929, manufactures parts mostly for the heavy truck industry; primarily truck chassis parts such as king pins and shackles.

=== Hurricane Agnes and the 1972 flood ===

During the summer of 1972, Hurricane Agnes struck the eastern seaboard of the United States, causing significant damage stretching from Florida into New England. Elmira was particularly hit hard by the flood, with over an estimated $291 million in damage. Over 15,000 people had to flee the city, and approximately 5,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. Coordinated efforts between local churches and regional businesses helped with the cleanup. Operating in secrecy, Rochester, NY-based Eastman Kodak sent crews as part of Operation Rebuild. Their efforts rebuilt 78 homes and assisted in the repairs of countless others.

Elmira city leaders approached the New York State Urban Development Corporation (UDC) to lead the redevelopment of the city post-flood. With a select group of businessmen and city officials attempting to minimize public input, the UDC implemented the &quot;New Elmira Plan&quot;. This entailed the removal of buildings along the river to create Riverside Park, and razing other buildings in the business district for two parking garages. Altogether, forty percent of Elmira&#x27;s commercial space was eliminated as part of the plan. Local citizens lamented the loss of character and vibrancy of downtown Elmira.

=== &quot;Storm of the Century&quot; – 1993 snow blizzard ===
In March 1993, the city of Elmira was hit hard by a snow blizzard, nicknamed &quot;Storm of the Century&quot;, that added 17 inches of snow to Elmira in a single day.

===2012 tornado===

Moderate damage was seen after the storm passed and hundreds of trees and power lines were blown down. No one was injured. The tornado was wide and took the city by surprise as this area has not been prone to tornadic activity.

<text>Horseheads is a village in Chemung County, New York, United States. The population was 6,606 at the 2020 census. The name is derived from the number of bleached skulls of pack horses left behind by the Sullivan Expedition.

The village of Horseheads is located within the town of Horseheads. It is north of the city of Elmira and is part of the Elmira Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==

In September 1779, forces under General John Sullivan marched north from Easton, Pennsylvania, over to Wyoming, Pennsylvania, and on up the Susquehanna River to Newtown (Elmira), then continued north through what is now known as Horseheads to the Finger Lakes region and west to Genesee, on a scorched-earth mission against Loyalists and more significantly against their Iroquois allies. They returned about three weeks later, largely on the same route.

The journey had been particularly severe and wearing upon the animals, and their food supply was found insufficient. Arriving about north of Fort Reid on September 24, 1779, they were obliged to dispose of a large number of sick and disabled horses. The number of horses was so great that they were quite noticeable, and the surviving Iroquois collected the skulls and arranged them in a line along the trail. From that time forward, that spot was referred to as the &quot;Valley of the Horses&#x27; Heads&quot; and is still known by the name given to it by the Iroquois. Today this area is part of the heartland of Upstate New York, across which thirty-five monoliths mark the path of Sullivan&#x27;s troops and the locations of the Iroquois villages they razed dotting the region, erected by the New York State Education Department in 1929 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the expedition.

The settlement of the village area began around 1830. The village was officially incorporated in 1839 as the &quot;Village of Fairport,&quot; due to its location on the Chemung Canal, but changed its name back to &quot;Horseheads&quot; in 1845. In 1885, it was renamed &quot;North Elmira&quot; but the village resumed the original name, &quot;Horseheads&quot; in 1886.

The village was once a port on the Chemung Canal.

The Chemung Railway Depot-Horseheads, Hanover Square Historic District, Horseheads 1855 Extension Historic District, Teal Park, and Zimmerman House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The village is where high speed rail cars will be built for the Brightline West train from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. Siemens Mobility has been selected to build the rail cars, and is building its factory there, announced in September 2024. A $60 million facility of about will be built in Horseheads, and the rail line is planned to be in service by 2028, with rail cars from this plant. This constitutes the start of a new industry in the US.

==Geography==

<text>Horseheads is a town in Chemung County, New York, United States. The population was 19,412 at the 2020 census. The name of the town is derived from the number of bleached horses&#x27; skulls once found there.

Horseheads is north of the city of Elmira, upon which it borders. There is a village named Horseheads within the town. It is part of the Elmira Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
On September 1, 1779, General George Washington and Nickolas Steven Webb ordered the forces of General John Sullivan to march north on a journey through a wooded wilderness from Easton, Pennsylvania, over to Wyoming, Pennsylvania, and on up the Susquehanna River to Newtown (Elmira) to mount a raid on Iroquois, then allied with the British. They continued north through what is now known as Horseheads to the Finger Lakes region and west to Geneseo. Devastating the already weakened Iroquois, Sullivan&#x27;s troops retreated back along the same route.

The journey had been particularly severe and wearing upon the animals, and their food supply was found insufficient. Arriving about north of Fort Reid on September 24, 1779, they were obliged to dispose of a large number of sick and disabled horses. The number of horses was so great that they were quite noticeable, and the native Iroquois collected the skulls and arranged them in a line along the trail. From that time forward, that spot was referred to as the &quot;valley of the horses&#x27; heads&quot; and is still known by the name.

Around 1787, the first settlers arrived, making the area one of the first in the county to be populated. The town of Horseheads was formed from the towns of Elmira and Chemung in 1835. Fairport, the current village of Horseheads, set itself off from the town by becoming an incorporated village in 1837.

=== Fire of 1862 ===
A fire destroyed much of the business district of Horseheads in August 1862.

===The Holding Point===
Located in the northern portion of Horseheads, The Holding Point was used by the Federal government for the war effort. Originally called The Holding Point and Reconsignment Point, it was a storage and collection point for military equipment. At the cost of over $8 million, the 700+-acre plot of land was managed by 30 soldiers from the Army Transportation Corp and aided by 500 civilians. In the summer of 1944, German POWs were brought to the Holding Point as labor from nearby former CCC camps in Van Ettan. The German POWs only served at the Holding Point for a limited time, before they were replaced by approximately 400 Italians from two Allied-loyal Italian Service Units.

Just north of Southport, the PRR shared track with the Erie Railroad through downtown Elmira. The yard also served the New York Central Railroad, which had trackage rights on the PRR north of Elmira. It was a major crew terminal for the PRR especially, and was quite large, with extensive facilities. It covered most of Southport. The Elmira Branch was one of the last holdouts of steam locomotives on the PRR, and they could be seen here almost until the end of PRR steam in 1957.

Hayes added the Pillard Porticho to the Landers home, and the structure continues to stand and is known as the Jericho Farm today. In 1983, the Main Street Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The cold and snow had been so severe, the townspeople of what is now Bainbridge refused to help. When spring came, hard feelings were had by the rural residents, and the town of Jericho split into two. Afton was named from a line in a poem cherished by the town, and also named with an &quot;A&quot; because it came first alphabetically, so that it came before &quot;Bainbridge&quot; on state registers.

== History ==
The first settlement of the village site took place &quot;circa&quot; 1789. The village was incorporated in 1821. It was once the home for production of Elmer&#x27;s Glue. In 1982, many of its historic buildings were included in the Bainbridge Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. The Charles C. Hovey House and Strong Leather Company Mill was listed in 1996.

In June 2006, a weather system stalled over most of the Southern Tier in New York state, causing river levels to rise dramatically. The Susquehanna River, which runs through the eastern part of the village of Bainbridge, rose to , which was over the river&#x27;s flood stage. Major flooding took place in the village, including the northern parts of North Main Street and the area near the town baseball field. The river stretched far up East Main Street, passing the village garage and post office. Flood waters also reached the exit and entrance to the westbound side of Interstate 88.

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.17% of the population.

There were 578 households, out of which 31.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47.6% were married couples living together, 10.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 38.6% were non-families. 32.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.35 and the average family size was 2.99.

In the village, the population was spread out, with 26.4% under the age of 18, 8.8% from 18 to 24, 26.2% from 25 to 44, 23.5% from 45 to 64, and 15.1% who were 65 years of age or older.

==Economy==
The village of Bainbridge is small. Its proximity to other villages and towns, such as Oxford, Guilford, Afton, and Unadilla, and to the small cities of Sidney and Norwich, help to expand business and employment opportunities. In addition, its location on New York State Route 7 and on Interstate 88, between the regionally-important cities of Albany and Binghamton, also helps to inject a degree of stimulus into the local economy.

The village has a industrial park called the Bainbridge Business park. The park is broken up into seven lots, each . An outpatient clinic for the Veterans Health Administration is among the occupants. The old Elmer&#x27;s Glue plant was once a foundation of the local economy, but in its absence other businesses have had to fill the vacuum. Bainbridge is home to the executive headquarters of Conklin Fashions, one of the largest wholesale suppliers of costume jewelry and fashion accessories in the United States and an employer of several dozen local citizens.

<text>Bainbridge is a town in Chenango County, New York, United States. The population was 3,308 at the 2010 census. The town is at the eastern border of Chenango County, halfway between Binghamton and Oneonta.

== History ==


Bainbridge was originally settled by Native Americans of the Iroquois nations. During the American Revolution, these tribes became allies of the British and commenced raids on American settlements. In 1779, George Washington ordered the Sullivan Expedition into what is today Upstate New York. When General James Clinton reached the Bainbridge area, the tribes had fled to sanctuary in Upper Canada. Clinton&#x27;s forces destroyed their homes and crops, including their winter stores.
The town was first settled by European Americans &quot;circa&quot; 1788, first by a group called the &quot;Vermont Sufferers&quot;. These were people from land in Eastern New York, who had lost their claims due to land sales by Vermont for the same claims.

The town was formed in 1791 as the &quot;Town of Jericho&quot; in Tioga County before the formation of Chenango County. The name Bainbridge was adopted in 1814 in honor of United States Navy Commodore William Bainbridge. Subsequently, the town was reduced by the creation of new towns in the county: In 1793, part of Bainbridge was used to form the parts of the towns of Norwich and Oxford; more of Bainbridge was used for the towns of Greene (1798 and 1799) and Afton (1857).

<text>Greene is a town in Chenango County, New York, United States. The population was 5,604 at the 2010 census. The town is named after General Nathanael Greene. It is located in the southwestern corner of the county and contains a village, also named Greene. The town and village are northeast of Binghamton. Greene was founded in 1792, but commenced in 1798 (though this is hotly disputed).

== History ==

Part of modern Greene was from land purchased in 1785 from the Oneida and Tuscarora people, but many of the Oneida remained in the area until &quot;circa&quot; 1812. In 1792, the first outside settler arrived and established himself at Greene village.
The town was originally known as Hornby, but was changed to Greene in honor of General Nathanael Greene, a hero of the American Revolution.

The town was formed from the towns of Bainbridge and Union (Broome County) in 1798. More was added to Greene from Bainbridge (then &quot;Jericho&quot;) in 1799. The town was later reduced by the formation of new towns: Coventry (1806) and Smithville (1808). More of Greene was taken to form part of the town of Barker in 1840, and another part of Greene was added to Coventry in 1843.

In 1842, the village of Greene was incorporated within the town.
About two dozen men from Greene enlisted during the Civil War.

The former Chenango Canal (1837) helped build the town&#x27;s commerce until replaced by the railroad, which was in turn replaced by Route 12 and State Highway 206.

In 1945 the Gross Flat flying field was purchased by Robert Barrows and the Greene Airport was established. The airport is still in operation and is located on 173 Airport Road. Boasting one of the longest and widest grass strips in the area, it is frequented by pilots in training. It is open to the public and has a local CFII instructor and a certified A&amp;P. The Greene Airport also has a live updating weather station that sends data to the National Weather Service.

The Chenango River Theatre was founded in Greene in 2006 by a committee dedicated to the concept of establishing a professional, non-profit theatre to help attract tourists to Greene and Chenango County. That committee evolved into a Board of Directors, who selected Bill Lelbach as the company&#x27;s initial Artistic and Managing Director. They are now in their 15th season (2021), with Zach Curtis taking over for 2022 as Producing Artistic Director from the retiring Lelbach. They are still one of the relatively few Equity theatres in the country able to survive in a strictly rural environment.

The landmark Sherwood Hotel, now closed, is haunted, due to the ever-present ghost of Viola, a wartime widow who hung herself with rope from the upper balcony. In 1910, then 20-year-old Viola, daughter of a local cattle rancher, had married the son of the wealthy Juliand family, Donovan. The couple had thirteen children together, until, in 1917, Donovan Juliand shipped out for the European theater of World War One. Though Donovan allegedly wrote Viola each day for every day of 1917, always proclaiming his longing to return to her and their children, he never made it home, and Viola, heartbroken and lovesick, eventually took her own life by hanging herself where she worked.

<text>Norwich is a city and county seat of Chenango County, New York, United States. Surrounded on all sides by the Town of Norwich, the city&#x27;s name is taken from Norwich, England. Its population was 7,190 at the 2010 census.

Lt. Warren Eaton Airport (OIC), serving the area, is located north of the city in the town of North Norwich.

== History ==

The first log cabin was built in 1788 by Col. William Monroe, who served as a drummer boy during the Revolutionary War. The town of Norwich was formed in 1793 from the towns of Union (now in Broome County) and Bainbridge. Afterwards, Norwich, as a &quot;mother town&quot; of the county, lost substantial territory in the formation of new towns. In 1806, Norwich gave up territory to form the towns of Pharsalia, Plymouth and Preston. More of Norwich was lost in 1807 to form parts of the towns of New Berlin and Columbus. In 1808 and 1820, Norwich exchanged territory with the town of Preston.

The central community of Norwich set itself off from the town in 1816 by incorporating as a village, and later becoming the city of Norwich in 1914.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Unlike many upstate cities, there are few, if any, defined neighborhoods or districts. Although the city is divided into six wards for political purposes, neighborhoods are seldom referred to in this manner.

Downtown is the main commercial district of Norwich, consisting of North and South Broad streets, East and West Main streets, and lesser side streets, including American Avenue, Lackawanna Avenue, and parts of Mechanic, Fair, and Hayes streets. The downtown district is bordered on the north by Cortland and Mitchell streets, and to the south by Front Street and Eaton Avenue.

Norwich is located in upstate New York, in the Chenango River valley. The river, a tributary of the Susquehanna, winds south along the eastern edge of the city. Along the western border, Canasawacta Creek flows south, until it unites with the Chenango River at the southern city limits.

=== Location ===
Norwich lies near the center of the triangle that can be drawn connecting the cities of Syracuse, Albany, and Binghamton, along Interstates 90, 88, and 81, respectively. The city is located at the intersection of New York State Route 12 and New York State Route 23. On Route 12, Utica and access to Interstate 90 is to the north, while Binghamton (and the Triple Cities) and access to Interstate 81 and Interstate 86 (currently New York State Route 17, known as the Southern Tier Expressway), is to the south. State Highway 23, which cuts laterally through the northern side of the city, leads east to the city of Oneonta and access to Interstate 88, while to the west NY 23 leads in the direction of Cortland and Interstate 81, away.

===Climate===
==Economy==

For nearly a century, the city had important manufacturing firms. It was the corporate headquarters of the Norwich Pharmacal Company. Formed in 1887 as a partnership between Reverend Lafayette Moore and Oscar G. Bell, a drug store employee, the company grew to become a major developer and manufacturer of medicines and veterinary products, known for its Unguentine antiseptic dressing (introduced in 1893) and Pepto-Bismol, an upset-stomach and anti-diarrhea medication (introduced in 1901 under a different name).

The company merged with Morton International, Inc. in 1969 and later became a subsidiary of Procter &amp; Gamble in 1982. Under corporate restructuring, Procter &amp; Gamble divided the company into several units, each of which was subsequently sold. This caused the loss of many jobs in Norwich, resulting in the city struggling to figure out a new economic model.

In 1996, a new plant of Dan Wesson Firearms was built in Norwich and the company moved there from Massachusetts; It became a subsidiary of CZ-USA in 2005 and therefore a Colt CZ Group subsidiary since 2022.

From 1845 until 1961, Norwich was also the home of the Maydole Hammer Factory. The founder, David Maydole, was an enterprising blacksmith who set out to create a hammer with a safely attached head. His hammers proved so successful that Maydole had become the largest hammer manufacturer in the United States by the time of its founder&#x27;s death in 1892.

The Chenango Canal, the New York, Ontario and Western Railway, and the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (later Erie-Lackawanna) once served most of the city&#x27;s transportation needs. Norwich was the NYO&amp;W&#x27;s Northern Division point until operations ceased on March 29, 1957. Until June 2006, the community was served by the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad, which operated trains on the old DL&amp;W line between Binghamton and Utica. That service ended as a result of flood damage in 2011 to the portion of the line between Sangerfield and Chenango Forks. Following a major renovation, the line resumed freight service in May, 2017.


A new $8 million campus was constructed for the city&#x27;s small extension of Morrisville State College. Due to loss of jobs in the area, population has declined, affecting both admissions and attendance at the college in recent years.

NBT Bancorp and Chobani are both headquartered in Norwich.

Route 12 bisects the city on a north-south axis, becoming North and South Broad Street within city limits. A community of downtown businesses is found along it. On the north side of town lies the North Plaza, desolate since the departure of anchor tenant Jamesway, and a commercial strip of gas stations and fast food outlets. To the south are three plazas just outside city limits, featuring supermarkets, gas stations, fast food, Lowe&#x27;s and Walmart.

Norwich residents usually travel to the larger nearby cities of Oneonta, Binghamton, Utica, sometimes Cortland, and occasionally the much larger metropolitan areas of Syracuse and Albany, for goods and services unobtainable locally.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 7,355 people, 3,131 households, and 1,671 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 3,500 housing units at an average density of .

The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 78.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 75.0 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $28,485, and the median income for a family was $39,808. Males had a median income of $33,537 versus $24,430 for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,339. About 14.7% of families and 18.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 28.5% of those under age 18 and 9.2% of those age 65 or over.

==Culture==
The Chenango Arts Council serves as a year-round arts and entertainment hub for the Norwich community and surrounding counties. Located in the former Norwich High School building on the city&#x27;s west side, the Council includes a unique two-level art gallery, art instruction classrooms and the circa 1922 515-seat Martin Kappel Theater. The broadroom-style auditorium was listed in the League of Historic Theaters in 1989, and underwent an extensive renovation in 1995 after years of abandonment with contributions from local government, corporate donors and hundreds of former alumni of the high school. Each year, the stage hosts the Chenango Arts Council&#x27;s Annual Performance Series, regular performances by the Norwich Theater Company and serves as a venue for many community organizations and businesses. The Martin Kappel Theater hosted the Twin Tiers International Film Festival in September 2018.

The Chenango Arts Council serves as a New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA) multi-county DEC site, administering and re-granting more than $100,000 of funding annually directly to artists and community arts initiatives in Broome, Chenango and Otsego counties.

Numerous festivals and events mark the Norwich calendar, with residents looking forward to several annual cultural traditions. These include the Colorscape Chenango Arts Festival, a two-day event in early September that features regional musicians and artists, and the Chenango Blues Festival, held at the Chenango County Fairgrounds each August-attracting thousands and featured nationally renowned artists such as Koko Taylor, Luther Allison, and The Fabulous Thunderbirds. Since the early 1990s, the nationally known Gus Macker organization has hosted a 3-on-3 basketball tournament in early July, with hundreds of teams participating each year.

Museums include the Chenango County Historical Society and the Northeast Classic Car Museum, which houses over 160 classic cars, including the world&#x27;s largest collection of Franklin automobiles.

<text>Sherburne is a town in Chenango County, New York, United States. The population was 4,048 at the 2010 census. The town contains two villages, Sherburne and Earlville. The town is at the northern border of Chenango County.

== History ==

The area that became Sherburne, part of the Chenango River valley, was originally inhabited by the Oneida people, until the late 1780s when the state of New York purchased the land from them. These parcels were later sold at auction in New York City.

The settlement of Sherburne occurred around 1792 near the present-day Sherburne village. The town was named after the tune &quot;Sherburne&quot;, written by Daniel Read in 1783. The early inhabitants had a habit of frequently singing the tune, which was a great favorite with them. Most of the earliest inhabitants and settlers of Sherburne were originally from the town of Kent, Litchfield County, Connecticut. Sometime around 1785 or 1786, two years after the Treaty of Paris and Treaties of Versailles were signed on September 3, 1783, ending the American Revolutionary War, the future proprietors and pioneers of Sherburne left Kent and emigrated to Duanesburgh, Schenectady County, New York. After a few years there they had been unable to secure title to the lands on which they settled. It was at that point that they resolved to move again as a body to the Chenango Valley, which had just begun to open lands in the Twenty Townships.

In June 1791, Deacon and Judge Nathaniel Gray, Elisha Gray, Joel Hatch, Abram Raymond, Newcomb Raymond, and James Raymond visited these lands in the interest of the company as an exploring party, accompanied by Josiah Throop, chief of the corps who had surveyed the tract that and the preceding years. On their arrival they found that a family consisting of five men, one woman and some small children from Paris in Oneida County had squatted a few hours previously on Handsome Brook, and were occupying a bark cabin. There they found hospitable welcome through the night and in the morning were regaled by their hostess with new bread and beer, both her own making. This family remained but a short time, for they had left before the return of the exploring party.

The exploratory party examined the southwest quarter of the 9th township, containing , which they and their associates eventually bought of Colonel William S. Smith, to whom the township was patented by the state of New York for $1.25 per acre. The exploratory party returned to Duanesburgh with a good report sometime prior to October 9, 1791, for on that date, James Raymond married Melissa Burritt, the second daughter and child of Rev. Blackleach Burritt, the spiritual leader of the company, and of Martha Welles.

In the summer of 1792, the exploratory party returned, which was mainly composed of the original proprietors, and settled in a cabin near Handsome Brook. During the later summer and fall, the exploratory party had accomplished the work they had set out to do, and they returned to their families in Duanesburgh, except Abram Raymond and his wife, Betsey Gray Raymond, the daughter of John Gray and Elizabeth Skeel and sister of Nathaniel Gray.

Within a year, the first settlers of Sherburne established themselves on their newly acquired plots. And it was not confined alone to the proprietors and their families, most of whom arrived that time, but many of their friends and neighbors from Duanesburgh joined with them. The advance company arrived on a Saturday night in March 1793. Their first organization of the town was that of the Congregational Church of Sherburne, founded on July 6, 1794.

The town of Sherburne was created in 1795 from the town of Paris (now in Oneida County). The town of Smyrna was formed from part of Sherburne in 1808, and the size of Sherburne was increased by annexing part of the town of New Berlin in 1852.

The opening of the Chenango Canal in 1837 between Utica and Binghamton, which ran right down the middle of Sherburne, greatly reduced the cost and time of receiving goods and supplies. During the Civil War, Union soldiers set up camp on the banks of the canal, on what is now the home of Westlake Village. The railroad, like elsewhere around New York, replaced the canal in 1867, and two trains came through town on a daily basis.

They are believed to have been pushed out and defeated later in that century by the Mohawk, one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy.

The first European-American settler arrived &quot;circa&quot; 1800, after the American Revolution, when New York attracted migrants from New England. In 1857, the town was formed from part of the Town of Chazy. The early economy was based on natural resources: mining, logging, and tanning.

<text>Champlain is a town in Clinton County, New York, United States. The population was 5,754 at the 2010 census. The town is located on the western shore of Lake Champlain, near the northern end of Lake Champlain and is on the U.S./Canadian border.

The town occupies the northeastern corner of Clinton County and the state of New York. Within the town are two villages: Champlain and Rouses Point.

== History ==

Nearby Lake Champlain was an important military and trade route during the colonial period. The lake and the town were named in honor of Samuel de Champlain, who first surveyed the area in 1609. It was part of Canada until 1763 and became part of the United States in 1783.

The town was formed in 1788, the same year the county was established. In 1799, the town was reduced by the formation of the town of Chateaugay (now in Franklin County). The founding of the towns of Chazy and Mooers, in 1804, further reduced Champlain.

Champlain is on the border with Canada and contains three border crossings: Champlain, Overton Corners, and Rouses Point. The Champlain Port of Entry on Interstate 87 is one of the four most important commercial gateways on the northern border, connecting New York City to the south with Montreal to the north, via Quebec Autoroute 15.

==Geography==
Champlain is approximately south of Montreal. According to the 2010 United States census, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 12.90%, is water.

Lake Champlain and the Richelieu River are on the eastern edge of the town, which shares a border with Grand Isle County, Vermont. The town line to the north is the international border with Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, Quebec, Canada.

The Adirondack Northway (I-87) is a major north-south highway that begins at the Canadian border at Champlain and travels south to Albany, connecting to the New York State Thruway. US 9 parallels I-87, and U.S. Route 11 runs north-south across the town. US 2 intersects US-11 by Rouses Point. New York State Route 9B intersects US-11 in the northeast and US-9 in the southern part of Champlain, providing a highway closer to Lake Champlain. New York State Route 276 partly runs along the international border.

<text>Dannemora is a village located in the towns of Dannemora and Saranac in Clinton County, New York, United States. It is best known as the location for Clinton Correctional Facility, also known colloquially as Dannemora. The population was 3,936 (approximately 2,800 to 3,000 of this number are prison inmates) at the 2010 census. The village is named after Dannemora, Sweden, an iron-making town from where early settlers of this area had emigrated.

The northern half of the village is in the town of Dannemora, while the southern half is in the town of Saranac. The ZIP code is 12929.

Primary and secondary education is provided by the Saranac Central School District.

== History ==

The village of Dannemora was incorporated in 1901. Permanent settlement had begun in 1838. The early economy was based on mining and smelting iron, but this industry did not become significant until approximately 1843.

Clinton Prison (now known as the Clinton Correctional Facility) was opened in 1845 to employ convicts to work in the iron industry. In the 21st century, it is classified as a maximum security facility. It houses long-term prisoners and is one of the largest prisons in the state. It is located in the northern portion of the village.

From 1900 to 1972, Dannemora also contained the Dannemora Hospital for the Criminally Insane (also known by other names). After being closed for the mentally ill, this facility was used for a variety of prison programs by the Department of Corrections. As a result, Dannemora has become a synonym among many in the state for the place where many of its criminally insane are confined.

==Geography==
Dannemora is located at (44.720878, -73.718904).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

The entire village of Dannemora is located within the boundary of Adirondack Park. However, the town of Dannemora is excluded from the park by statute. This means that the portion of the village lying within the town of Dannemora, including the Clinton Correctional Facility, is outside Adirondack Park, while the portion inside the town of Saranac is included in the park.

New York State Route 374, an east-west highway, passes through the village as Cook Street.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 4,129 people, 469 households, and 326 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 516 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 49.07% White, 37.95% Black or African American, 0.56% Native American, 0.97% Asian, 10.49% from other races, and 0.97% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 18.65% of the population.

There were 469 households, out of which 35.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 48.6% were married couples living together, 15.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.3% were non-families. 23.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.62 and the average family size was 3.03.

In the village, the population was spread out, with 8.9% under the age of 18, 12.6% from 18 to 24, 58.2% from 25 to 44, 16.1% from 45 to 64, and 4.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 525.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 682.1 males.

The median income for a household in the village was $42,500, and the median income for a family was $47,019. Males had a median income of $24,753 versus $24,286 for females. The per capita income for the village was $18,872. About 13.5% of families and 14.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 28.1% of those under age 18 and 4.1% of those age 65 or over.

Note: The census counts prisoners as part of the jurisdictions where they are incarcerated. With the all-male state prison in Dannemora, the ethnicity and gender data for the village is different from that of the general village population and the population of neighboring non-prison towns, because a disproportionate percentage of the prison population is male and black or Hispanic. Household and family statistics, however, do not include the prison population.

The age distribution was 10.3% under the age of 18, 11.7% from 18 to 24, 53.6% from 25 to 44, 18.0% from 45 to 64, and 6.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 367.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 446.6 males.

Note: The census counts prisoners based on where they are incarcerated. With the all-male state prison in Dannemora, the data listed above, except for household and family data, is likely to be skewed in comparison with the remainder of the town population and the population of neighboring non-prison towns, particularly with regard to ethnicity and the female:male ratio, because a disproportionate percentage of the prison population is male and black or Hispanic.

<text>Plattsburgh is a city in and the county seat of Clinton County, New York, United States, situated on the north-western shore of Lake Champlain. The population was 19,841 at the 2020 census. The population of the surrounding (and separately incorporated) Town of Plattsburgh was 11,886 as of the 2020 census, making the combined population of Plattsburgh to be 31,727. Plattsburgh lies just to the northeast of Adirondack Park, immediately outside of the park boundaries. It is the second largest community in the North Country region (after Watertown), and serves as the main commercial hub for the sparsely populated northern Adirondack Mountains. The land around what is referred to as Plattsburgh was previously inhabited by the Iroquois, Western Abenaki, Mohican, and Mohawk people. Samuel de Champlain was the first ever recorded European that sailed into Champlain Valley and later claimed the region as a part of New France in 1609.

Plattsburgh was the site of the amphibious Battle of Plattsburgh in the War of 1812, a key American victory that marked the end of hostilities in the Northern United States. It has been an important military outpost for much of its history, from hosting one of the largest Citizens&#x27; Military Training Camps prior to World War I, and Plattsburgh Air Force Base, the east coast center of operations for the Strategic Air Command during much of the Cold War period. The conversion of the base to a civilian airport in the 1990s resulted from the Base Realignment and Closure process during the wind down of the Cold War, and today it serves as a hub for economic development for the region. The city was named one of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; Top 10 Micro Cities of the Future several times.

== Micropolitan statistical area ==
The city of Plattsburgh is the population center and county seat at the heart of the Plattsburgh micropolitan statistical area (μSA) with a population of 82,128 according to the 2010 Census. A statistical area representing the greater Plattsburgh region (as defined by the U.S. government), the Plattsburgh μSA includes all communities in the immediate Clinton County area.

== History ==

=== Plattsburgh&#x27;s founding under American rule ===
Plattsburgh was founded by Zephaniah Platt in 1785 after he was granted the land by George Clinton. Platt, who was from Poughkeepsie, New York, established the new city of Plattsburgh to buffer emerging American interests in the Saint Lawrence River valley and Lake Champlain valley after the American victory in the American Revolutionary War. The centralized American authority proclaimed Plattsburgh in 1785.

=== Split from the Town of Plattsburgh ===
On March 3, 1815, an act was passed by the New York State legislature incorporating the Village of Plattsburgh out of an area that was formerly the eastern part of the town. The first village elections were held on May 2 of that year.

The village incorporated as a city in 1903. The actual boundaries are unknown. The last expedition to survey the boundaries ended in disaster; all following endeavors for an accurate survey of the borders of the Town of Plattsburgh and the City of Plattsburgh were relinquished to fate and luck.

===Notable historic events===

With its significant location on a major water thoroughfare and proximity to the Canada–U.S. border, Plattsburgh has been the site of a number of historic events including the Revolutionary War&#x27;s Battle of Valcour Island and the War of 1812&#x27;s Battle of Plattsburgh; the city has a War of 1812 museum. The Battle of Plattsburgh is significant, as it was the final battle of the war between the British/Canadian forces and those of the Americans.

Plattsburgh Normal School was founded in 1889. It burned in 1929, and relocated to City Hall for three years. In 1932 the college moved into the current Hawkins Hall which became the base of the modern campus. In 1948 it became State University of New York at Plattsburgh.

Plattsburgh was home to minor league baseball. The Plattsburgh Brewers team was based in Plattsburgh between 1895 and 1907. Plattsburgh teams played as members of the Eastern International League (1895), International League (1896), Northern New York League (1901–1905), Independent Northern League (1906), New Hampshire State League (1907) and Vermont State League (1907). Baseball Hall of Fame member Eddie Collins played for Plattsburgh in 1906.

In 1915, the Preparedness Movement established the first and best-known of its training camps for prospective military volunteers at Plattsburgh. The &quot;Plattsburgh camps&quot; trained about 40,000 potential United States Army commissioned officers in the summers of 1915 and 1916.

During the Cold War, military functions took a prominent role in Plattsburgh, which was home to Plattsburgh Air Force Base (PAFB) and was the location of the Strategic Air Command&#x27;s primary wing on the East Coast due to its geographic desirability. The base&#x27;s location in the Champlain Valley (protected by the rain shadow of the Adirondack Mountains) ensured consistent, year-round weather that was safe for take-offs and landings. The 380th Bombardment, Aerospace, and Refueling Wings, all stationed at PAFB, included B-52 Bombers, air-refueling &quot;tankers&quot;, and FB-111s. The base had a great deal of land surface and was one of only four military bases in the United States with a landing strip large enough for a Space Shuttle landing.

On September 1, 1961, the 556 Strategic Missile Squadron was activated at Plattsburgh AFB. The Squadron consisted of 12 Atlas &quot;F&quot; Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, stored in underground silos at twelve sites surrounding the city of Plattsburgh. Ten of the silos were in New York, while two were across Lake Champlain in Vermont. The squadron played an active role in the 1962 Cuban Missile crisis, giving President Kennedy a powerful negotiating tool in dealing with Nikita Khrushchev. The 556 SMS&#x27;s life was relatively short lived since the Atlas was a liquid fuel system that was expensive and difficult to maintain. As the solid fuel Minuteman ICBM began to come on line, the liquid fueled missiles such as the Atlas and Titan were retired. The 556 SMS began deactivating in the spring of 1965, completing that task later that year.

Despite its numerous awards for performance excellence, PAFB was closed on September 29, 1995, in a round of national base closures in the early 1990s as the Air Force began to pare down its post-Cold War missions. The base property is now managed by the Plattsburgh Airbase Redevelopment Corporation (PARC) and is used by a number of industrial manufacturers and commercial airlines.

Plattsburgh remains a favorite tourist location for vacationers from Montreal and southern Quebec. Bilingual signs, in English and French, are found in various parts of the city. Today, the city relies largely in part on new industries with a predominantly Canadian and Québécois influence expanding on the former airbase as well as established manufacturing plants, such as Bombardier, Nova Bus, and others.

==Spelling==
Plattsburgh is sometimes historically spelled as &quot;Plattsburg&quot;, leaving off the &quot;h&quot;. Many historic documents relating to the famous naval engagement between the United States and Britain in 1814 refer to the Battle of &quot;Plattsburg&quot;. As a result, some history has been written using the latter spelling. For example, historian and former president of the Society of the War of 1812 in Illinois, John Meloy Stahl, published in 1918 &quot;The Battle of Plattsburg: A Study in and of The War of 1812.&quot;

In 1950, the editor of the New York State Legislative Manual, seeking to simplify the organization of that year&#x27;s manual, requested a listing of state post offices from the United States Postal Service. Upon review of the listing, the difference in spelling was noted. The city was contacted and an investigation was begun by postal authorities.

United States Postal Service records show that the name of the post office was originally &quot;Plattsburg&quot; but was changed to &quot;Plattsburgh&quot; by 1828. In 1891, the Postmaster General ordered that post offices follow the standards set by the newly created United States Board on Geographic Names, which decided that the &quot;h&quot; should be dropped from place names ending in &quot;burgh&quot;. Subsequently, local postal officials changed the name of the village post office back to &quot;Plattsburg&quot;. As a result of the 1951 investigation, the name of the city post office was changed back again to &quot;Plattsburgh&quot;. At no time was the name of the city itself ever changed.

To this day, some signs (including U.S. and Canadian highway signs, and a sign at the Plattsburgh Amtrak Station, among others) point the way to &quot;Plattsburg&quot;. There is also a former bank building with &quot;&quot; inscribed at the top.

Plattsburgh is part of a media market shared with Burlington, Vermont, which includes WCAX-TV (CBS, channel 3), WVNY-TV (ABC, channel 22), WNNE (CW, channel 31) and WFFF-TV (Fox, channel 44). Residents are also in the range of Montreal, Quebec, and other Canadian television stations. Some of these Canadian stations, including CBFT-DT, CBMT-DT and CFCF-DT, are available on Charter Communications, the cable franchise serving Plattsburgh.

==Transportation==
The city is about a 60-minute drive from Montreal, Canada&#x27;s second most populous city, which is also the largest city in Quebec. Many people commute across the Canada–U.S. border, and the City of Plattsburgh advertises itself as &quot;Montreal&#x27;s U.S. suburb&quot;. New York state is Quebec&#x27;s largest trade partner, with about $6 billion in trade annually. The proximity leads to Plattsburgh&#x27;s prominence as a large trade center for a city its size.

===Highway===
* Interstate 87 bypasses Plattsburgh to the west, connecting Montreal with Albany and points south. Three main exits serve the city of Plattsburgh, with a fourth serving the Cumberland Head district of the town.
* U.S. Route 9 is a north–south highway crossing through the city on the east side.
* New York State Route 3 is an east–west state highway that enters the city from the west as Cornelia Street, intersects Route 22 and then ends at Route 9.
* New York State Route 22 is a north–south state highway that enters the city from the southwest, then turns north to run parallel to the west of Route 9. Part of Route 22 in downtown is a divided highway.
* New York State Route 314 is a short east–west highway on the northern town line with the town of Plattsburgh connecting Interstate 87 with the Grand Isle–Plattsburgh Ferry to Vermont.

===Rail===

Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Plattsburgh, operating its &quot;Adirondack&quot; daily in both directions between Montreal and New York City.

===Ferry===
The closest American city larger than Plattsburgh is Burlington, Vermont, which is reachable by a ferry or a bridge located further north at Rouses Point. Ferry service is provided at Cumberland Head, and heads to Grand Isle by the Lake Champlain Transportation Company. The seasonal ferry between Port Kent and Burlington has ceased operations and is unlikely to reopen. 

===Air===
Plattsburgh International Airport uses the runway of the former Plattsburgh Air Force Base, which closed in 1995. The airport terminal was completed in February 2007 with the building being dedicated on April 27, 2007.

Direct flights from Plattsburgh include flights to Philadelphia International Airport, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, St. Petersburg, Florida, and others. Airlines flying out of Plattsburgh include Contour Airlines (which code shares with American Airlines), Breeze Airways, and Allegiant Air.

Plattsburgh flight demand is driven by the increased traffic from Montreal, Quebec. At approximately 80% to 85% of total yearly demand, Plattsburgh&#x27;s airport markets itself as Montreal&#x27;s American Airport, given it is closer to Montreal&#x27;s South Shore Residents than Montreal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, even with a 10 (workdays/Canadian side) to 20-minute (weekend/Canadian side) average border wait time.

Cargo flights are offered by FedEx Feeder which delivers goods to more major airports aboard Cessna Caravans to be shipped on long haul flights and UPS which does similar service using Embrear 110 turboprop aircraft.

===Bus===

The county-wide bus service offers passengers city and county-wide bus routes, allowing passengers from surrounding communities to travel to and from Plattsburgh. These routes operate five days a week, with a city-wide shopping shuttle offered on Saturdays. There is no bus service on Sundays or major holidays.

The North Country Express (NCE for short) runs every day between Plattsburgh and Potsdam, and every day except Sunday between Plattsburgh and Malone making several stops in between. There is no service on major holidays.

For those going longer distances, Greyhound and Adirondack Trailways offers multiple daily trips towards Montreal and Albany.

==Economy==
The largest employers in Clinton County are C.V.P.H. Medical Center, SUNY Plattsburgh, Clinton County Government, Wal-Mart, Sam&#x27;s Club, Advocacy and Resource Center, City of Plattsburgh, and Swarovski Lighting. SUNY Plattsburgh contributes approximately $300 million to the regional economy each fiscal year.

Other large companies in the area include: ALSTOM Transportation, which builds rail-cars in a plant; Norsk Titanium, which opened its U.S. branch in Plattsburgh to make parts for the aerospace industry through the use of titanium rapid plasma deposition; and Nova Bus and Prevost which manufactures busses for the American market.

Previous to the NYSDOT renovations, cars driving in the traffic circle on Main Street yielded to cars entering the circle, which is an unusual traffic pattern. This pattern was changed to be in compliance with NY state traffic laws in 2008. NYSDOT supplied funding to rebuild Main Street including installing a new water main, drainage structures, granite curbing and concrete sidewalk. Main Street was closed to vehicular traffic during this period. After Main Street&#x27;s existing pavement was excavated, the road was filled with crushed stone, providing pedestrian access to shops along the street. Various side streets were repaved with asphalt and new curbing and sidewalk was installed as well. A new retaining wall with H-pile was built on Hudson Avenue. This work was carried out in 2008 and 2009. The prime contractor was A. Colarusso &amp; Son Inc., based in Hudson, New York. During construction, NYS Senator Stephen M. Saland showed up briefly to witness progress.

The village was a hub of the New York Central, Boston and Albany, and Rutland railroads, with three wyes and one roundhouse.

<text>Germantown is a town in Columbia County, New York, United States. The population was 1,936 at the 2020 census, down slightly from 1,954 in 2010. Germantown is located in the south-western part of the county along the east side of the Hudson River.

==History==

=== Early indigenous history ===
The area currently known as Germantown was originally occupied by the Mohican people. In the early eighteenth century, Hendrick Aupaumut recorded the movement of his people who had settled along the rivers that would later be named the Delaware and Hudson. Those who had continued north settled in the valley of the river they named the Mahicannituck (today&#x27;s Hudson River), meaning &#x27;the Waters That Are Never Still&#x27;. They named themselves the &#x27;Muh-he-con-neok&#x27; after the river, a name that eventually evolved to the present day Mohican or Mahican.

The Mohicans settled in the valley, building wigwams and longhouses. The river and woodlands were abundant with life and food, which they supplemented with the corn, beans, and squash they grew. Mohican women were usually in charge of this agriculture, along with the homes and children, while men traveled to fish, hunt, or serve as warriors.

=== Colonization and European-Mohican relations ===
In September 1609, Henry Hudson, a trader for the Dutch, sailed up the Mahicannituck. The valley was rich with beavers and otters, whose fur the Dutch coveted, and in 1614 a trading post was established. As the fur trade expanded, making desired furs harder to find, tensions arose between the Mohicans and the Mohawk, who each sought to maintain their share in the fur trade and relations with European allies. Wars and their effects contributed to the loss of Mohican land to the point where territory in the Hudson Valley dwindled almost completely by the end of the seventeenth century. Mohicans were especially affected by European wars such as King Philip’s War where soldiers from Massachusetts and Connecticut attacked Mohicans. In general after war, Mohicans sold land to the Dutch in exchange for needed resources lost in the destruction of indigenous farming and preserved resources. As more and more Europeans arrived and settled on the land, the Mohicans’ self-reliance and reliance on the land was eroded by increased dependency on the settlers and their provisions. Settlers began dividing the land, establishing fences and boundary lines. Eventually, the Mohicans were driven from their territory west of the Mahicannituck and continued to move further east in the early 1700s.

Robert Livingston, a Scottish immigrant, bought thousands of acres from the Native Americans. In 1683, Mohicans sold the first land parcel along the Roeliff Jansen Kill to Livingstone in exchange for goods as well as rights to hunting and fishing in the area. Livingstone received a Mohican deed to the Tachkanick settlement in 1685, where he built a house in 1689. These exchanges were the beginning of a trade relationship that lasted through 1768. He owned a total of at what became Livingston Manor.

=== Moravian-Mohican relations ===
In the summer of 1740, the first Moravian mission was established in the Mohican village of Shekomeko. Before that, Moravian missionary Christian Henry Rauch approached two Mohican leaders, Maumauntissekun (AKA Shabash) and Wassamapah, who were sojourning in New York City. Rauch wanted them to help bring Christianity to Mohican settlements. Maumauntissekun had a vision in 1739 where he and his Indian brethren laid dead in the woods. Because they suffered from alcoholism, he believed in the need for religion and temperance. Maumauntissekun agreed to bring Rauch to his town, Shekomeko. Initially, many Mohicans were skeptical of Rauch&#x27;s presence because Mohican land had been bought in such great quantities by Europeans. Nevertheless, Maumauntissekun was among the first three Shekomeko residents to be baptized on February 11, 1742. Maumauntissekun then became known as Abraham of Shekomeko.

The Moravians lived among Mohicans in Dutchess County and Connecticut&#x27;s Housatonic Valley. Many Moravians missionaries learned Mohican languages, while often in areas of strong English and German influence, they did not. Children of Mohican converts learned to read and write in Moravian schools. By the mid-eighteenth century, much of Mohican territory was divided by colonial powers, with the private property of others having displaced traditional communal lands. Although many Mohicans were divided on the new way of life, some adapted to it by converting to Christianity. Families often sent their children to be baptized and raised at Moravian headquarters in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, due to the high mortality rates of children from European diseases and war.

In the 1740s, there were regional Indian raids on European settlements in New York and Massachusetts. Settlers believed that the French in Canada supplied Indians with weapons. Moravian missionaries were perceived as both allies of Canada and Indians, and were accused of disloyalty for fomenting the uprisings. When Moravian missionaries refused to enter colonial militias in early 1744, the New York colonial government issued a September 1744 order that discontinued Moravian missionary activities in the province.

=== Mohican-settler land disputes ===
In the 1720s, white settlers began to survey Dutchess County land that they claimed according to exchanges originating from the Great Nine Partners Patent. The latter was a landholding of between 8 and 10 miles in width from east of the Hudson almost to Connecticut at the Oblong. It was granted to white settlers in May 1697 and the result of negotiations with Indians in eight grants from the Little Nine Partners Patent signed in April 1706.

Abraham of Shekomeko (formerly known as Maumauntissekun or Shabash) protested the claims but was still willing to sell some land. His grievance was based on Mohican tradition which provides that land that was not used is open for his people to continue hunting and fishing in the area. The Dutchess County territory being surveyed was unoccupied by white settlers for over four decades, making European claims &quot;de jure&quot;. The Mohicans, on the other hand, had been hunting and farming on the land for over two decades. According to a missionary memorandum recorded in 1743, Abraham went to New York City in 1724 where the governor promised to pay for Mohican land and leave them with a square mile for Mohican settlement. In September 1743 that square mile was divided by white settlers. In response, Abraham wrote to the governor disputing the unlawful claims. He tried to prove Mohican ownership by producing witnesses to the Little Nine Partners and even sent a petition around Shekomeko. In the end, the land was divided, and Abraham moved from the village site while Shekomeko was claimed by a proprietor.

=== Founding of Germantown ===
In 1710, Robert Livingston sold of his property to Anne, Queen of Great Britain, for use as work camps and resettlement of Palatine German refugees. Some 1,200 persons were settled at work camps to manufacture naval stores and pay off their passage as indentured labor. Known as &quot;East Camp&quot;, the colony had four villages: Hunterstown, Queensbury, Annsbury, and Haysbury. The area was later renamed &quot;Germantown&quot;. In 1775 Germantown was formed as a &quot;district&quot;. Germantown was one of the seven original towns of Columbia County established by an act passed March 7, 1788, alongside Kinderhook, Canaan, Claverack, Hillsdale, Clermont, and Livingston.

In March 1845, a boat-load of people from East Camp, who had been to Hudson to make purchases, was run over first by a scow, and then by the steamboat &quot;South America&quot;. All nine individuals were lost.

=== Removal ===
During the American Revolution, the Mohicans supported the colonists. After the war concluded, however, they were not welcomed in the area&#x27;s villages. The Oneida offered them a portion of land and in the mid-1780s they began to move to the prayer town of New Stockbridge. Although the community thrived and the population grew steadily, land companies, hoping to make a profit from the land inhabited by Indigenous communities, proposed that New York State remove all Native Americans from within its borders. In 1822 agents from New York, missionaries, and commissioners from the War Department negotiated with the Menominee and Ho-Chunk communities of Wisconsin for a tract of land on which to relocate the indigenous tribes of New York. In the following years, members of the community were relocated to Shawano County, Wisconsin, and settled on the reservation land. The modern Stockbridge-Munsee Community comprises the descendants of these and other bands and tribes relocated people.

==Points of interest==

===Germantown Library===

The library was first founded in 1948 by the Germantown Garden Club and Emily Finger Lappe in the town hall across from the current post office. It was run by volunteers for two years. In 1950, the town hired their first librarian, Bessie Muller-Babcock, and she was paid $100 per year. When the town hall moved in 1980, the library moved with it until it became apparent that the library had outgrown the space.

In February 2008, the library moved to its new permanent space. This building included dedicated spaces for children, young adults, media, and adults. At the same time, the Hover Room opened to the public for library programs, classes, and town meetings. In 2015, a maker space area was added to the library, the first of its kind in Columbia County. Three years later, the maker space expanded to meet patron interest and needs. It moved to the lower level, where it occupies half of the floor.

At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the library was forced to close its doors and all of its programs went online. Patrons were able to apply for and instantly receive a library card online in order to access materials. Hoopla was added to the range of services the library offered to give patrons more online choices. In addition to Hoopla, the library also offers Kanopy, Overdrive, Libby, Mango Languages, RB Digital Magazines, and online newspapers. Free Wi-Fi can be accessed 24/7 and special senior citizen hours are available on Tuesdays and Fridays.
