<text>Antoine Carraby (born December 11, 1961), better known by his stage name DJ Yella, is an American DJ, record producer, and film director from Compton, California.

DJ Yella began his career as a member of the World Class Wreckin&#x27; Cru along with Dr. Dre. He later joined the pioneering gangsta rap group N.W.A (originally composed of Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Arabian Prince and Eazy-E) and became the least vocal but longest-lasting member of the group. His first and only studio album &quot;One Mo Nigga ta Go&quot; was released in 1996 through Street Life Records and was dedicated to Eazy-E. After the release of the album he left the music industry to direct pornographic films until 2011, when he started working on a new album called &quot;West Coastin&quot;.

== Early life ==
Antoine Carraby was born in Compton, California, on December 11, 1961, and raised in Los Angeles.

The second youngest of nine children, Carraby grew up poor and considered himself something of a loner. His parents divorced when he was four years old, and he lived primarily with his mother.

He was passionate about music from a young age. He grew up listening to funk music and learned to play the drums. As a teenager, he performed at various clubs of Los Angeles by the name of Yella which was inspired by Tom Tom Club&#x27;s Mr. Yellow. After watching Run-D.M.C. perform in California for the first time, him and Dre both were amazed to see them on-stage with nothing more than a DJ scratching. They attempted to make a few records themselves in the nightclub Eve After Dark, owned by Alonzo Williams.

== Career ==

Yella began DJ&#x27;ing as a teenager in a local club called Eve After Dark. At the club he met aspiring DJ Dr. J, later to become member Dr. Dre of N.W.A. Eve After Dark had a back room with a small four-track studio. In this studio, Yella and Dre recorded several demos. In their first recording session, they recorded a song entitled &quot;Surgery&quot;.
Influenced by Grandmaster Flash, Yella and Dre formed the World Class Wreckin&#x27; Cru in the early &#x27;80s, which released its debut album under the Kru-Cut label in 1985. The group would become stars of the electro-hop scene that dominated early-mid 1980s West Coast hip hop. &quot;Surgery&quot;, recorded and released prior to the group&#x27;s official formation, was their first hit, selling 50,000 copies in Compton alone. DJ Yella and Dr. Dre also performed mixes for local radio station KDAY, boosting ratings for its afternoon rush-hour show The Traffic Jam.

Along with Dre, Yella helped produce Eazy-E&#x27;s debut album &quot;Eazy-Duz-It&quot; and the two N.W.A albums, along with the 100 Miles and Runnin&#x27; EP. Along with Dr. Dre and Arabian Prince, Yella co-produced J.J. Fad&#x27;s gold certified debut (&quot;Super Sonic&quot;) and also Michel&#x27;le&#x27;s (self-titled) album and contributed to The D.O.C.&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;No One Can Do It Better&quot; (also produced by Dre). Jerry Heller, in his 2006 memoir &quot;Ruthless&quot;, witnessed Dre and Yella&#x27;s work together, writing that the two had an &quot;almost eerie understanding&quot;, as they crafted high quality beats and productions with almost no words or full sentences needing to be spoken.

Yella remained close to Eazy and stayed on production duties at Ruthless Records after the acrimonious breakup of N.W.A. He produced J.J. Fad&#x27;s second album &quot;Not Just a Fad&quot; (1990), Yomo &amp; Maulkie&#x27;s album &quot;Are U Xperienced?&quot; (1991), two tracks from Eazy-E&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa&quot; (1993), the gold-selling hit single &quot;Foe tha Love of $&quot; from Bone Thugs-N-Harmony&#x27;s &quot;Creepin on ah Come Up&quot; EP, Menajahtwa&#x27;s album &quot;Cha-licious&quot;, and tracks from H.W.A.&#x27;s &quot;Az Much Ass Azz U Want&quot; E.P. (all three from 1994). He also helped produce Eazy&#x27;s final album &quot;Str8 off tha Streetz of Muthaphukkin Compton&quot;, released about a year after his sudden death in 1995 from AIDS-related complications.

Yella released his 1996 debut solo album &quot;One Mo Nigga ta Go&quot; on Street Life Records as a tribute to Eazy-E, featuring members of the Ruthless &quot;family tree&quot; Kokane, B.G. Knocc Out, and Dresta, rhyming over his productions. The album peaked at number 82 on the Billboard 200 albums chart and at number 23 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart in the US.

After this record he retired from music to embark on a 12-year career directing and producing pornographic films. Yella says he produced more than 300 adult films.

Yella was played by Neil Brown Jr. in the 2015 N.W.A biopic, &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;. He is portrayed as very interested in sex and women, and also as less aggressive than the other members and unwilling to engage in conflict with Ice Cube.

In April 2016, Yella reunited with the former members of N.W.A at Coachella.

==Awards and honors==
In 2016, Yella was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of N.W.A. In 2024, Yella and the other members of N.W.A. received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He showed up to accept the award along with Ice Cube, MC Ren, The D.O.C and Lil Eazy E.

<doc id="261109" wikidata="Q524059" url="?curid=261109" title="Fork bomb">
<text>In computing, a fork bomb (also called rabbit virus) is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack wherein a process continually replicates itself to deplete available system resources, slowing down or crashing the system due to resource starvation.

== History ==
Around 1978, an early variant of a fork bomb called wabbit was reported to run on a System/360. It may have descended from a similar attack called RABBITS reported from 1969 on a Burroughs 5500 at the University of Washington.

== Implementation ==

Fork bombs operate both by consuming CPU time in the process of forking, and by saturating the operating system&#x27;s process table. A basic implementation of a fork bomb is an infinite loop that repeatedly launches new copies of itself.

In Unix-like operating systems, fork bombs are generally written to use the fork system call. As forked processes are also copies of the first program, once they resume execution from the next address at the frame pointer, they continue forking endlessly within their own copy of the same infinite loop. this has the effect of causing an exponential growth in processes. As modern Unix systems generally use a copy-on-write resource management technique when forking new processes, a fork bomb generally will not saturate such a system&#x27;s memory.

Microsoft Windows operating systems do not have an equivalent functionality to the Unix fork system call; a fork bomb on such an operating system must therefore create a new process instead of forking from an existing one, such as with batch codice_1. In this batch script, codice_2 is written to codice_3, which is then executed by codice_4.

A classic example of a fork bomb is one written in Unix shell codice_5, possibly dating back to 1999, which can be more easily understood as

fork() {
 fork | fork &amp;
fork

In it, a function is defined (codice_6) as calling itself (codice_7), then piping (codice_8) its result into itself, all in a background job (codice_9).

The code using a colon codice_10 as the function name is not valid in a shell as defined by POSIX, which only permits alphanumeric characters and underscores in function names. However, its usage is allowed in GNU Bash as an extension.

== Prevention ==
As a fork bomb&#x27;s mode of operation is entirely encapsulated by creating new processes, one way of preventing a fork bomb from severely affecting the entire system is to limit the maximum number of processes that a single user may own. On Linux, this can be achieved by using the &quot;ulimit&quot; utility; for example, the command codice_11 would limit the affected user to a maximum of thirty owned processes.
On PAM-enabled systems, this limit can also be set in codice_12,
and on *BSD, the system administrator can put limits in codice_13.
Modern Linux systems also allow finer-grained fork bomb prevention through cgroups and process number (PID) controllers.

<doc id="261111" wikidata="Q320810" url="?curid=261111" title="George Chalmers (antiquarian)">
<text>George Chalmers (December 1742 – 31 May 1825) was a Scottish antiquarian and political writer.
==Biography==
Chalmers was born at Fochabers, Moray, the second son of the local postmaster, James Chalmers (who was a grandson of George Chalmers of Pittensear in Lhanbryde) and his wife Isabella. After completing a course at King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen, he studied law at the University of Edinburgh for several years.

Two uncles on the father&#x27;s side had settled in British North America, and Chalmers visited Maryland in 1763, apparently to assist in recovering a tract of land about which a dispute had arisen. He began practising as a lawyer at Baltimore. As a Loyalist, however, at the outbreak of the American War of Independence, he abandoned his professional prospects and returned to Great Britain. Several years then passed before he found adequate employment.

In August 1786, Chalmers was appointed chief clerk to the committee of Privy Council on matters relating to trade, following its re-establishment. He retained this position for the rest of his life. It left him time to write.

Chalmers was a fellow of the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries of London, an honorary member of the Antiquarian Society of Scotland, and a member of other learned societies. His library was left to his nephew, at whose death in 1841 it was sold and dispersed.

==Controversialist==
A dogmatic writer, Chalmers became involved in numerous literary controversies. Among his avowed opponents were Edmond Malone and George Steevens, the Shakespeare editors; Thomas James Mathias, the author of the &quot;Pursuits of Literature&quot;; Dr John Jamieson, the Scottish lexicographer; John Pinkerton, the historian; David Irving, the biographer of the Scottish poets; and James Currie of Liverpool.

==Works==

===&quot;Caledonia&quot;===
Chalmers&#x27;s major work was his &quot;Caledonia&quot;, which he left incomplete. The first volume appeared in 1807, and is introductory to the others. It is divided into four books, treating successively of the Roman, the Pictish, the Scottish and the Scoto-Saxon periods, from 80 to 1306 AD. The books present, in a condensed form, with an account of the people, the language and the civil and ecclesiastical history, as well as the agricultural and commercial state of Scotland during the first thirteen centuries of the Common Era. The chapters on the Roman period are marred by the author&#x27;s having accepted as genuine Charles Bertram&#x27;s forgery &quot;De Situ Britanniae&quot;.

The second volume, published in 1810, gives an account of the seven southeastern counties of Scotland – Roxburgh, Berwick, East Lothian (&quot;Haddington&quot;), Edinburgh/Midlothian (all as &quot;Edinburgh&quot;), West Lothian (&quot;Linlithgow&quot;), Peebles and Selkirk – each covered by name, situation and extent, natural objects, antiquities, establishment as shires, civil history, agriculture, manufactures and trade, and ecclesiastical history.

In 1824 the third volume appeared, giving, under the same headings, a description of the seven south-western counties – Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, Wigtown, Ayr, Lanark, Renfrew and Dumbarton. In the preface to this volume the author stated that the materials for the history of the central and northern counties were collected.

===Early works (1776–1786)===
Before his Privy Council appointment, Chalmers applied himself to investigating the history and establishment of the English colonies in North America, based on his access to the state papers and other documents of what were then termed the plantation records. His work, &quot;Political Annals of the present United Colonies from their Settlement to the Peace of 1763&quot;, (1780), was to have formed two volumes; but the second, for the period between 1688 and 1763, never appeared. The first volume traces the original settlement of the different American colonies, and the changes in their constitutions and forms of government, as affected by British politics.

Chalmers next wrote &quot;An Estimate of the Comparative Strength of Britain during the Present and Four Preceding Reigns&quot; (1782), which passed through several editions.

===Mature works (1786–1824)===
Chalmers wrote biographical sketches of Daniel Defoe, Sir John Davies, Allan Ramsay, Sir David Lyndsay, Thomas Churchyard and others, for editions of their works. The British government also paid Chalmers £500 to write a hostile biography of Thomas Paine; he published it under the assumed name of Francis Oldys, A.M., of the University of Pennsylvania. A life of Thomas Ruddiman, whom he admired, combined praise for the subject with an attack on the reputation of his contemporary James Anderson.

In 1818 Chalmers published a life of Mary, Queen of Scots, based on a manuscript left by John Whitaker, but rewritten. Mary&#x27;s history occupied much of his attention, and his last work, &quot;A Detection of the Love Letters lately attributed in Hugh Campbell&#x27;s work to Mary Queen of Scots&quot;, is an exposure of an attempt to represent as genuine some fictitious letters said to have passed between Mary and Bothwell. He had also prepared for the press a detailed history of the life and reign of David I of Scotland. In his later researches he was assisted by his nephew James, son of Alexander Chalmers, writer in Elgin.

&quot;Apology for the Believers in the Shakespeare Papers which were exhibited in Norfolk Street&quot;, appeared in 1797, followed by other tracts by Chalmers on the same subject, relating to the Ireland Shakespeare forgeries. He also took part in the controversy on the identity of Junius, and in &quot;The Author of Junius Ascertained, from a Concatenation of Circumstances amounting to Moral Demonstration&quot; (1817) asserted that the Junius letters were written by Hugh Boyd. In 1824 he published &quot;The Poetical Remains of some of the Scottish Kings&quot;, now first collected; and in the same year he edited, for the Bannatyne Club, &quot;Robene and Makyne and the Testament of Cresseid&quot;, by Robert Henryson.

Political writings by Chalmers included:

*&quot;Collection of Treaties between Great Britain and other Powers&quot; (1790); 
*&quot;Vindication of the Privileges of the People in respect to the Constitutional Right of Free Discussion, etc.&quot; (1796), published anonymously; 
*&quot;A Chronological Account of Commerce and Coinage in Great Britain from the Restoration till 1850&quot; (1810); 
*&quot;Opinions of Eminent Lawyers on various points of English Jurisprudence, chiefly concerning the Colonies, Fisheries, and Commerce of Great Britain&quot; (1814); 
*&quot;Comparative Views of the State of Great Britain before and since the War&quot; (1817).

<text>Đorđe Petrović (; ;  – ), known by the sobriquet Karađorđe (; ), was a Serbian revolutionary leader who led a struggle against the Ottoman Empire during the First Serbian Uprising. He held the title of Grand Vožd of Serbia from 14 February 1804 to 3 October 1813. He is also known for being the founder of Serbia&#x27;s last Royal House of Karađorđević.

Born into an impoverished family in the Šumadija region of Ottoman Serbia, Karađorđe distinguished himself during the Austro-Turkish War of 1788–1791 as a member of the Serbian Free Corps, a militia of Habsburg and Ottoman Serbs, armed and trained by the Austrians. Fearing retribution following the Austrians&#x27; and Serb rebels&#x27; defeat in 1791, he and his family fled to the Austrian Empire, where they lived until 1794, when a general amnesty was declared. Karađorđe subsequently returned to Šumadija and became a livestock merchant. In 1796, the rogue governor of the Sanjak of Vidin, Osman Pazvantoğlu, invaded the Pashalik of Belgrade, and Karađorđe fought alongside the Ottomans to quash the incursion.

In early 1804, following a massacre of Serb chieftains by renegade Ottoman janissaries known as Dahis, the Serbs of the Pashalik rebelled. Karađorđe was unanimously elected to lead the uprising against the Dahis at an assembly of surviving chiefs in February 1804. Within six months, most of the Dahi leaders had been captured and executed by Karađorđe&#x27;s forces, and by 1805, the final remnants of Dahi resistance had been crushed. Karađorđe and his followers demanded far-reaching autonomy, which Sultan Selim III interpreted as but the first step towards complete independence. Selim promptly declared &quot;jihad&quot; against the rebels and ordered an army to march into the Pashalik. The Ottomans suffered a string of defeats at the hands of Karađorđe&#x27;s forces. By 1806, the rebels had captured all the major towns in the Pashalik, including Belgrade and Smederevo, and expelled their Muslim inhabitants. Burdened by the demands of the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812, Selim offered the Serbs extensive autonomy. However, Karađorđe refused in light of Russia&#x27;s avowal to aid the rebels should they continue fighting.

Frequent infighting, together with Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia in 1812, weakened the rebels, and the Ottomans were able to reverse many of their gains. Karađorđe was forced to flee Serbia in October 1813 and Belgrade fell later that month, bringing the First Serbian Uprising to a close. He and his followers sought refuge in the Austrian Empire, but were arrested and detained. Despite Ottoman requests for extradition, the Austrians handed Karađorđe over to the Russians, who offered him refuge in Bessarabia. There, he joined the Greek secret society known as &quot;Filiki Eteria&quot;, which planned to launch a pan-Balkan uprising against the Ottomans. Karađorđe returned to Serbia in secret in July 1817, but was killed shortly thereafter by agents of Miloš Obrenović, a rival rebel leader, who was concerned that Karađorđe&#x27;s reappearance would cause the Ottomans to renege on the concessions they had agreed to following the Second Serbian Uprising of 1815. Karađorđe is considered the founder of the house of Karađorđević, which ruled Serbia in several intervals during the 19th and 20th centuries. His murder resulted in a violent, decades-long feud between his descendants and those of Obrenović, with the Serbian throne changing hands several times.

==Origins==
Đorđe Petrović was born into an impoverished family in the village of Viševac, in the Šumadija region of Ottoman Serbia, on . He was the oldest of his parents&#x27; five children. His father, Petar Jovanović, was a highwayman (or &quot;hajduk&quot;) in his youth, but had since become a peasant farmer. His mother, Marica ( Živković), was a homemaker. Petrović&#x27;s surname was derived from his father&#x27;s given name, in line with contemporary Serbian naming conventions. Like most of his contemporaries, Petrović was illiterate. His family celebrated the feast day of Saint Clement. They are said to have been descended from the Vasojevići tribe of Montenegro&#x27;s Lim River valley. His ancestors are thought to have migrated from Montenegro to Šumadija in the late 1730s or early 1740s. Petrović&#x27;s childhood was strenuous and difficult. His parents were forced to move around often in search of a livelihood. His father worked as a day labourer and servant for a &quot;sipahi&quot; (), an Ottoman cavalryman. Petrović himself spent his adolescence working as a shepherd. In 1785, he married Jelena Jovanović, daughter of Nikola Jovanović, Obor-knez of Jasenica, whose family hailed from the village of Masloševo. The couple had seven children, six of whom reached adulthood.

Petrović worked for several landlords across Šumadija until 1787, when he and his family left the region and settled in the Austrian Empire, fearing persecution at the hands of the Ottoman janissaries. It is said that as they were preparing to cross the Danube into Austria, Petrović&#x27;s father began to have second thoughts about leaving Šumadija. Knowing that the entire family would be put in jeopardy if his father stayed behind, Petrović either took his father&#x27;s life or arranged for someone to kill him instead.

==Early military exploits==

Following the outbreak of the Austro-Turkish War of 1788–1791, Petrović joined the Serbian Free Corps (), and took part in fighting the Ottomans in western Serbia. The Free Corps was a volunteer militia made up of both Ottoman and Habsburg Serbs that was armed and trained by the Austrians. It was led by a Habsburg Serb officer, Major Mihailo Mihaljević. Petrović&#x27;s participation in the war brought him invaluable military experience, as well as insight into the Austrians&#x27; military techniques. He distinguished himself in combat and was decorated for bravery, reaching the rank of sergeant (). In this capacity, he was given command over a squad of 25 men.

The Austrians and Serb rebels briefly succeeded in liberating a strip of land east and south of Belgrade, which in Serbian historiography came to be known as Koča&#x27;s Frontier (), after one of the senior rebel leaders, Koča Anđelković. In 1791, the Austrians and Ottomans signed the Treaty of Sistova. The Austrians agreed to return all the territory that they and the Serbs had captured south of the Danube in exchange for minor territorial concessions in northern Bosnia, effectively abandoning the Serbs and leaving them to resist the Ottomans on their own. The rebels were crushed by 1792 and most of their leaders executed. Unwilling to surrender, Petrović became a &quot;hajduk&quot; and briefly fought the Ottomans as an outlaw. He and his family once again sought refuge in the Austrian Empire, this time finding sanctuary in the Krušedol Monastery, at the foot of Fruška Gora, where Petrović worked as a forester.

In 1793, Hadji Mustafa Pasha was appointed governor of the Pashalik of Belgrade. He declared a general amnesty for former rebels and announced that Muslims would no longer serve as tax-collectors in areas where Christians formed a majority of the population. These changes were part of a plan devised by Sultan Selim aimed at improving relations with the Pashalik&#x27;s Christian population. Sensing that it was safe, Petrović returned to Šumadija in 1794, together with his family. He settled in Topola, where he became a livestock merchant and traded with the Austrians. His business dealings led him to establish connections with many Habsburg Serbs. In 1796, Osman Pazvantoğlu, the renegade governor of the Sanjak of Vidin, who had rejected the authority of the Sublime Porte, launched an invasion of the Pashalik of Belgrade. Overwhelmed, Mustafa Pasha formed a Serbian national militia to help stop the incursion. Petrović joined the militia and became a &quot;boluk-bashi&quot; (), leading a company of 100 men.

In return for their service, the Serbs of the Pashalik were granted a number of privileges. They were allowed to bear arms and raise autonomous military units. After the Serb militias joined the war on Mustafa Pasha&#x27;s side, Pazvantoğlu suffered a string of defeats. He retreated to Vidin, which was subsequently besieged. The war against Pazvantoğlu marked the first time that Petrović distinguished himself in the eyes of the Ottomans, who bestowed him with the sobriquet &quot;Black George&quot; (; ), partly because of his dark hair and partly because of his sinister reputation. Karađorđe&#x27;s service in the Serbian militia resulted in him becoming well acquainted with Ottoman military doctrine.

==First Serbian Uprising (1804–1813)==
===Revolt against the Dahis===

In 1798, Napoleon invaded Egypt, forcing the Porte to redeploy thousands of regulars from the Balkans in order to resist the French. The janissaries in the Pashalik of Belgrade, known as Dahis (), who had been expelled from the region on Selim&#x27;s orders nearly a decade earlier, were pardoned and allowed to return to Belgrade on the condition that they obey Mustafa Pasha. The détente between the aging governor and the Dahis did not last long. In 1801, Mustafa Pasha was killed by a Dahi assassin.

The power vacuum caused by Mustafa Pasha&#x27;s murder resulted in a period of infighting between the Dahis that would last until 1802. By this time, four senior Dahi commanders emerged triumphant and agreed to share power within the Pashalik. The Serbs were stripped of the privileges that they had been granted under Mustafa Pasha. Dahi bands roamed the countryside, killing peasants, looting property and setting homes on fire. Thousands of villagers were displaced and forced to flee into the mountains, where over the next several years, the able-bodied men formed &quot;ad hoc&quot; guerrilla bands.

In mid-July 1803, Karađorđe obtained arms and munitions from Habsburg Serb merchants in Zemun. Later that month, he dispatched couriers through Šumadija calling for a meeting of Serbian notables to devise a strategy for resisting the Dahis. The flow of arms from the Austrian Empire into the Pashalik, combined with their inability to crush the guerrillas in the countryside, made the Dahi leadership increasingly uneasy. In January and February 1804, the Dahis launched a pre-emptive assault against the Pashalik&#x27;s Serbian chieftains (known as &quot;knezovi&quot;, or &quot;princes&quot;), killing between 70 and 150 of them. The killings outraged the Serbian &quot;rayah&quot;, the Pashalik&#x27;s tax-paying lower class. By this time, Karađorđe was a well known and well respected figure in Šumadija. He narrowly escaped being killed in the two-month massacre, which came to be known as the Slaughter of the Knezes (). Upon killing the chieftains, the Dahis impaled their severed heads on wooden stakes and put them on public display.

On Candlemas, , the surviving chieftains assembled in the village of Orašac, near Aranđelovac, to decide on a course of action. They agreed to launch a rebellion against the Dahis and Karađorđe was elected without opposition to lead it. It is said that he twice refused to lead the uprising, arguing that his violent temper would make him unsuitable for the role. Karađorđe&#x27;s initial refusal only reinforced the chieftains&#x27; convictions that he was the only suitable candidate, and eventually, he agreed to lead the rebels. This event marked the beginning of the First Serbian Uprising, the opening phase of what would come to be known as the Serbian Revolution.

By the start of the revolt, the Pashalik of Belgrade had a population of about 400,000, 10 percent of which was Muslim. Its Serb population was roughly 250,000. At first, the rebels numbered around 30,000 men. In this initial stage, they were joined by a significant amount of the Pashalik&#x27;s Muslim population, whom the rebels dubbed the &quot;Good Turks&quot;. Karađorđe and his followers appealed to Sultan Selim for assistance against the Dahis, who had since rejected the authority of the Porte. Austria sent weapons and supplies to the rebels, while Russia lobbied on their behalf, encouraging the Porte to grant the Serbs further autonomy following the Dahis&#x27; removal. In May, Selim ordered a 7,000-strong army under of the command of Bekir Pasha, the governor of Bosnia, to march into the Pashalik. The Serbs welcomed Bekir Pasha and his men as liberators, and the Dahis were soon defeated through the joint efforts of Bekir Pasha&#x27;s army and the rebels. By late August, the most prominent Dahi leaders had been captured by Karađorđe&#x27;s men, beheaded, and their severed heads sent to the Sultan as trophies.

The Dahis resisted for another year before they were completely defeated. Karađorđe and his followers then demanded that Serbia be granted autonomous status similar to that enjoyed by neighbouring Wallachia. Selim suspected that Karađorđe&#x27;s demands for autonomy were but the first step towards complete independence. He responded by declaring a jihad against the rebels. Hafiz Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Niš, was then ordered to march into Šumadija and destroy Karađorđe&#x27;s army.

===Rebellion against the Porte===
====Initial successes====

The rebels first clashed with Ottoman regulars at the Battle of Ivankovac in August 1805, scoring a decisive victory. Belgrade was soon besieged by about 16,000 rebel fighters. The rebel leaders used anti-Muslim rhetoric to mobilize the peasantry, calling upon them to rise up and drive the Ottomans &quot;across the blue sea&quot;. In order to further galvanize the population, Karađorđe appealed to memories of the Battle of Kosovo of June 1389, which paved the way for the Ottoman conquest of Serbia and the rest of the western Balkans, declaring that Serbia&#x27;s defeat in the battle needed to be avenged. He sought to further cement his authority by harkening back to symbols of Medieval Serbia, such as the relics of Stefan the First-Crowned, and placing old heraldic symbols on flags and seals to establish continuity between the Serbian Empire and himself. Portraits of Dušan the Mighty, the founder of the Serbian Empire, are said to have hung from the walls of the rebels&#x27; headquarters.

Karađorđe was feared by enemies and allies alike because of his volatile temper. He considered executions to be the only way in which military infractions could be rectified, and according to the military historian Brendon A. Rehm, personally killed 125 people. In 1806, he ordered that his brother Marinko be hanged. According to one account, Marinko had been accused of raping a peasant girl. Another suggests that he had been attempting to seduce young women whose husbands were away at the front. Whatever the case, Karađorđe entertained senior rebel leaders in his home while his brother&#x27;s lifeless body dangled from the front gate—a warning to others to refrain from the behaviour in which Marinko had been engaging. Muslims, combatants and non-combatants alike, were killed unremittingly, as illustrated in this contemporary account describing the capture of the village of Čučuge, near Ub, in April 1806:


Serbs who neglected to join the uprising were brutalized in equal measure. Males who could not produce an adequate excuse for why they were not fighting were killed and their houses torched. While most of the rebels were Serbs, the Pashalik&#x27;s Romani (Gypsy) residents, the majority of whom were Muslim, also fought on the rebel side. Some Albanians also pledged allegiance to Karađorđe and fought on his behalf.

In 1806, the rebels twice dispatched the diplomat Petar Ičko to Constantinople to negotiate with the Porte. The two parties eventually reached an understanding, which came to be known as Ičko&#x27;s Peace, in which the Ottomans agreed to grant the rebels extensive autonomy. Due to the Balkans&#x27; poor communications and transport infrastructure, it took several months for news of the Porte&#x27;s offer to reach the rebels. In August 1806, the rebels defeated the Ottomans at the Battle of Mišar. Later that month, they scored another victory at the Battle of Deligrad. Smederevo was captured in November and made the capital of Karađorđe&#x27;s revolutionary state. Belgrade, with the exception of its imposing fortress, fell in early December. The outbreak of the Russo-Ottoman War that month, compounded by Russia&#x27;s avowal to provide extensive materiel and financial support to the rebels should they continue fighting, convinced Karađorđe not to accept anything short of complete independence. He promptly refused to accept the terms of the agreement negotiated by Ičko.
In March 1807, Karađorđe issued a promise to Suleiman Pasha, the Governor of Belgrade, that he and his garrison would be granted safe passage if they vacated the city&#x27;s besieged fortress. When Suleiman and his garrison emerged from the fortress, they were ambushed. Adult men were killed on the spot, women and girls were forcibly converted to Orthodox Christianity and made to marry their captors, and young children were placed in the care of Orthodox Christian families. One contemporary account suggests that as many as 3,000 non-Christians – mostly Muslims, but also Jews – were forced to convert to Orthodox Christianity. Jews that resisted conversion were either killed or expelled. Belgrade&#x27;s mosques were either destroyed or turned into churches.

====Losses mount====
As the revolution progressed, rebel strength peaked at around 50,000 fighters. Despite their initial successes, the rebel leaders were seldom on good terms, and constant infighting plagued their camp. In the western part of the country, Jakov Nenadović was the principal figure. In the east, Milenko Stojković and Petar Dobrnjac held sway. The latter two opposed Karađorđe&#x27;s attempts to create a centralized state, fearing that this would result in their own power being diminished. Others, such as Nenadović, complained that Karađorđe was becoming too authoritarian. Nenadović suggested that the rebels establish a central council to rein in Karađorđe&#x27;s power and write a constitution based on the rule of law. Karađorđe balked at the possibility. &quot;It&#x27;s easy for this sovereign law of yours to rule in a warm room, behind this table&quot;, he responded, &quot;but let us see tomorrow, when the Turks strike, who will meet them and beat them.&quot;
In May 1809, the rebels captured Sjenica. They repulsed an Ottoman attack on the village of Suvodol in early June, and seized Novi Pazar later that month, but failed to take its fortress. Minor clashes also took place in the north of Kosovo. Lacking numbers and adequate military training, the rebels failed to establish a corridor to Montenegro and gain access to the Adriatic Sea, which Karađorđe had described as one of his key aims. The rebels experienced further setbacks in Niš, where 3,000 were surrounded at Čegar Hill in May–June 1809. Knowing that he and his men would be impaled if captured, rebel commander Stevan Sinđelić fired at his entrenchment&#x27;s gun powder magazine, setting off a massive explosion that killed him and everyone else in the vicinity. On the site of the battle, the Ottoman commander Hurshid Pasha built a stone tower with the skulls of Sinđelić and his fighters embedded in its walls as a warning to others who wished to rebel.

The fall of Čegar allowed the Ottomans to establish a land corridor extending along the Morava River valley from Niš to the Danube. Their advance was brought to a halt after the Russians crossed the Danube in September 1809 and attacked the Ottomans in northern Bulgaria, offering the rebels temporary respite. The rebels soon recaptured all the land they had lost but were exhausted by the fighting. Henceforth, they were continuously on the defensive. The rebel leaders quarrelled amongst themselves, blaming each other for the recent defeats. Karađorđe blamed the Russians for not intervening earlier on the rebels&#x27; behalf. He subsequently wrote Napoleon seeking military assistance, and in 1810, dispatched an emissary to France. Nothing came of these requests, as the French did not believe that the rebels had the military capacity to dislodge the Ottomans from the Balkans. As his battlefield setbacks mounted, Karađorđe&#x27;s behaviour became more volatile. In late 1809, he shot and wounded one of his commanders, Petar Jokić, for making a poor military decision in the vicinity of Ćuprija.

In 1810, Dobrnjac mutinied against Karađorđe and nearly succeeded in dislodging him. He was joined in his revolt by Milenko Stojković. In June 1810, Russian troops entered Serbia for a second time, distributing weapons and supplies to Karađorđe and his followers. Field Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov took part in planning joint actions against both the Ottomans and the mutineers. By the following year, Dobrnjac and Stojković were defeated. Karađorđe attempted to placate the mutineers. In January 1811, he established the People&#x27;s Governing Council (), a cabinet consisting of members who supported Karađorđe as well as those who opposed him. It consisted of twelve members, one for each of the &quot;nahije&quot; (districts) of rebel Serbia. Karađorđe appointed Stojković as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nenadović as the Minister of the Interior, and Dobrnjac as the Minister of Justice. Also inducted into Karađorđe&#x27;s cabinet were Mladen Milovanović, as the Minister of War; Dositej Obradović, as the Minister of Education; and Sima Marković, as the Minister of Finance. Dobrnjac and Stojković refused to accept the posts that were offered to them, fearing that their acceptance would legitimize Karađorđe and undermine their own position. Karađorđe accused them of insubordination and exiled them to Wallachia, replacing them with loyalists. The Governing Council soon recognized Karađorđe as Serbia&#x27;s hereditary leader and pledged allegiance to his &quot;lawful heirs&quot;.

====Defeat====
In mid-1812, Russia and the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Bucharest, bringing the Russo-Ottoman War to a close. For his efforts, Karađorđe received the Order of Saint Anna from the Russians. The Governing Council scrambled to take an oath of loyalty to Russia in the hope that this would garner them further protection, to no avail. The Russian Emperor, Alexander, was aware of Napoleon&#x27;s plans to invade Russia and desperately sought to return as many Russian soldiers as possible in order to repel the attack. As part of the Treaty of Bucharest, the Russians and Ottomans agreed that Serbian fortifications built after 1804 were to be destroyed, while cities and forts from which the Ottomans had been expelled over the course of the uprising were to be reoccupied and garrisoned by Ottoman troops. In exchange, the Ottomans agreed to declare a general amnesty for former rebels, as well as to grant the Serbs of the Pashalik of Belgrade some degree of autonomy. As part of the agreement, the Russians agreed to withdraw their forces from Serbia, as well as from Wallachia and Moldavia. The Russians encouraged Karađorđe and his followers to negotiate directly with the Porte regarding the minutiae of the handover of cities and fortifications to the Ottomans. Trepidation filled the rebel camp once it became clear that there was nothing to prevent the Ottomans from exacting reprisals against the Pashalik&#x27;s Serb population after the Russians withdrew. Karađorđe thus refused to abide by the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest and fighting continued.

Deprived of foreign assistance, the rebels were quickly routed by the Ottomans, whose units were manned primarily by Albanians and Bosnian Muslims. In early October, Karađorđe fled to the Austrian Empire. He was joined by around 100,000 other Serbs fleeing the Ottoman advance, including 50,000 from Belgrade and its environs alone. Belgrade fell later that month. The city&#x27;s fall marked the end of the First Serbian Uprising. The Ottomans singled out men and boys over the age of 15 for execution, and sold women and children into slavery. Torture was used extensively and executions were particularly brutal. &quot;Men were roasted alive, hanged by their feet over smoking straw until they asphyxiated, castrated, crushed with stones, and bastinadoed,&quot; one eyewitness wrote. &quot;Their women and children were raped and sometimes taken by force to harems. Outside Stambul Gate in Belgrade, there were always on view the corpses of impaled Serbs being gnawed by packs of dogs.&quot; Another account relays how infants and toddlers were boiled alive. In one day alone, 1,800 women and children were sold into slavery at a Belgrade market. Churches across the city were destroyed and mosques that had been converted into churches following the city&#x27;s capture in 1806 were returned to their original use. Others were deliberately torched by the Ottomans for the purpose of inflicting suffering on the city&#x27;s inhabitants. In one instance, several dozen Serb refugees seeking shelter in a mosque were burned alive inside.

In late October 1813, Hurshid Pasha declared a general amnesty for the rebels that had survived, though Karađorđe and some senior Orthodox clerics were specifically exempted. Many rebel leaders agreed to lay down their arms, the most notable of these being Miloš Obrenović, the rebel commander in Užice. A large number of Serb refugees subsequently returned to their homes, as did many of the Muslims that had been displaced in the fighting.

==Exile, return to Serbia and assassination==

Upon crossing the Danube, Karađorđe and his followers were arrested by the Austrian authorities. They were initially detained at the Petrovaradin Fortress in Novi Sad and later transferred to a prison in Graz. The Ottomans demanded that Karađorđe and the other rebel leaders be extradited to face punishment. The Austrians refused and instead turned them over to the Russians. Karađorđe spent a year in Austrian custody before being allowed to go to Russia. Like many of the other rebel leaders, he settled in Bessarabia. He attempted to adjust to civilian life, commissioning a portrait of himself by the painter Vladimir Borovikovsky. In April 1815, Obrenović orchestrated another anti-Ottoman rebellion in Serbia, which came to be known as the Second Serbian Uprising. Unlike Karađorđe&#x27;s revolt, the Second Serbian Uprising ended relatively quickly and resulted in a rebel victory. In November 1815, the Ottomans accepted Obrenović&#x27;s demands for wide-ranging autonomy. The terms that they agreed to were identical to those rejected by Karađorđe in 1807. 
The Russians prohibited Karađorđe from returning to the Balkans to take part in the Second Serbian Uprising. Karađorđe objected and traveled to Saint Petersburg to plead his case, but was arrested and detained. Upon his release, he joined the &quot;Filiki Eteria&quot;, a Greek nationalist secret society that intended to launch a pan-Balkan uprising against the Ottomans. The &quot;Filiki Eteria&quot; promised Karađorđe a position of military leadership in the planned uprising and offered to smuggle him into the Pashalik of Belgrade. Karađorđe secretly entered the Pashalik on , crossing the Danube together with his servant, Naum Krnar. He then contacted his &quot;kum&quot;, Vujica Vulićević, who offered him an abode in the oak forest of Radovanje Grove, near Velika Plana. Unbeknownst to Karađorđe, Vulićević was on Obrenović&#x27;s payroll. After escorting Karađorđe and his servant to a tent in the forest, Vulićević informed Obrenović of Karađorđe&#x27;s whereabouts through a courier. Shortly thereafter, he received a letter from Obrenović telling him that Karađorde was to be killed. Vulićević enlisted one of his close confidantes, Nikola Novaković, to take Karađorđe&#x27;s life. The following morning, just before sunrise, Novaković snuck into Karađorđe&#x27;s tent and axed him to death while he slept. He then went to the riverside and shot Krnar with a rifle as he was gathering water. Karađorđe&#x27;s lifeless body was beheaded. His severed head was taken to Belgrade and presented to Marashli Ali Pasha, who had been appointed the governor of the Pashalik two years prior. Ali Pasha had the head flayed, stuffed and sent to the Sultan himself. 

Obrenović feared that Karađorđe&#x27;s return would prompt the Ottomans to renege on the agreement reached by the Porte and Obrenović&#x27;s followers in November 1815. By extension, Karađorđe&#x27;s murder precluded the Serbs of the Pashalik from taking part in the Balkan-wide rebellion that the &quot;Filiki Eteria&quot; had been planning. In Constantinople, Karađorđe&#x27;s head was impaled on a stake and left on public display for a week. His body was buried on Serbian soil, but his skull ended up in the hands of a Constantinople museum. It was stolen some years later and buried in Greece.

==Legacy==
Karađorđe&#x27;s descendants adopted the surname Karađorđević in his honour. His murder resulted in a violent, decades-long feud between his descendants and those of Obrenović, with the Serbian throne changing hands several times. The feud came to an abrupt end in June 1903, when rebellious Royal Serbian Army officers killed the Obrenović king, Alexander, and his wife, Queen Draga, thereby rendering the Obrenović line extinct. Karađorđe&#x27;s grandson, Peter Karađorđević, then ascended the throne.

In order to tie himself to his grandfather&#x27;s legacy, Peter commissioned a bronze crown cast from a piece of Karađorđe&#x27;s first cannon. In addition, the Order of Karađorđe&#x27;s Star was introduced as Serbia&#x27;s highest state decoration. The first feature-length film to emerge from Serbia and the Balkans, whose plot revolves around Karađorđe and his actions before, during and after the First Serbian Uprising, was released in 1911. Work soon began on the construction of the Church of Saint George, a Karađorđević dynasty mausoleum at Oplenac, near Topola. In 1913, a monument to Karađorđe was unveiled at Kalemegdan Park. During the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Serbia, the monument was torn down by the Austro-Hungarian Army and destroyed.

In November 1918, Peter ascended the throne of the newly established Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was later renamed Yugoslavia. Karađorđe&#x27;s head was repatriated from Greece in 1923 and reunited with the rest of his body. His remains were buried in a white marble sarcophagus within the church in 1930. The Karađorđević dynasty ruled Yugoslavia until 1941, when its members were forced into exile by Germany&#x27;s invasion and occupation of the country. The monarchy was abolished by Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s communist government in 1945.

Misha Glenny, a journalist specializing in the Balkans, believes that the First Serbian Uprising &quot;marked the beginning of modern history on the Balkan peninsula.&quot; The uprising kindled the flame of ethno-religious nationalism among the Christians of Southeastern Europe and inspired the subsequent Greek War of Independence. Karađorđe&#x27;s struggle against the Ottomans also had an important influence on the Bosnian Muslim revolutionary Husein Gradaščević, who instigated the Great Bosnian Uprising. Karađorđe is viewed in a negative light by some modern Bosniaks. In 2011, the chief Mufti of the Islamic Community of Serbia, Muamer Zukorlić, filed a petition to rename a street in Sjenica named after Karađorđe. Zukorlić alleged that Karađorđe and his followers had indiscriminately targeted the town&#x27;s residents in 1809, a notion disputed by Serbian historians. The historian Ivo Banac surmises that &quot;there would be no Bosnian Muslims today&quot; had Karađorđe extended his uprising west of the Drina.
Karađorđe&#x27;s exploits were popularized across Europe by the linguist and folklorist Vuk Karadžić, who recorded and published the ballads of the blind &quot;gusle&quot; player and epic poet Filip Višnjić, many of which pertained to the First Serbian Uprising. Karađorđe is referenced in a number of works of 19th-century fiction. While he was still alive, the Hungarian dramatist wrote a stage play about him, titled &quot;Black George&quot;, which premiered in August 1812. Several years later, the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin penned a ballad about Karađorđe titled &quot;The Song of George the Black&quot;. The Irish poet George Croly also wrote a ballad about him. Karađorđe is mentioned in Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s 1842 novel &quot;A Start in Life&quot;, as the grandfather of one of the book&#x27;s main characters. The Montenegrin prince-bishop and poet Petar II Petrović-Njegoš dedicated his 1847 epic poem &quot;The Mountain Wreath&quot; to &quot;the ashes of the Father of Serbia&quot;, a reference to Karađorđe. The surname Karamazov, used in the Russian writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s 1880 novel &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, is believed to have partially been inspired by Karađorđe, whose exploits popularized the use of the prefix &quot;kara&quot; to mean &quot;black&quot; within Russia.

Karađorđe&#x27;s likeness was featured on the obverse of five-million dinar banknotes issued by the National Bank of Yugoslavia in 1993 and 1994. The anniversary of the First Serbian Uprising&#x27;s commencement, 15 February, is celebrated annually in Serbia as Statehood Day. A monument to Karađorđe stands in front of Belgrade&#x27;s Church of Saint Sava, within the eponymous Karađorđe&#x27;s Park.

<text>Bloom&#x27;s taxonomy is a framework for categorizing educational goals, developed by a committee of educators chaired by Benjamin Bloom in 1956. It was first introduced in the publication &quot;Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals&quot;. The taxonomy divides learning objectives into three broad domains: cognitive (knowledge-based), affective (emotion-based), and psychomotor (action-based), each with a hierarchy of skills and abilities. These domains are used by educators to structure curricula, assessments, and teaching methods to foster different types of learning.

The cognitive domain, the most widely recognized component of the taxonomy, was originally divided into six levels: Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation. In 2001, this taxonomy was revised, renaming and reordering the levels as Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. This domain focuses on intellectual skills and the development of critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.

The affective domain addresses attitudes, emotions, and feelings, moving from basic awareness and responsiveness to more complex values and beliefs. This domain outlines five levels: Receiving, Responding, Valuing, Organizing, and Characterizing.

The psychomotor domain, less elaborated by Bloom&#x27;s original team, pertains to physical skills and the use of motor functions. Subsequent educators, such as Elizabeth Simpson, further developed this domain, outlining levels of skill acquisition from simple perceptions to the origination of new movements.

Bloom&#x27;s taxonomy has become a widely adopted tool in education, influencing instructional design, assessment strategies, and learning outcomes across various disciplines. Despite its broad application, the taxonomy has also faced criticism, particularly regarding the hierarchical structure of cognitive skills and its implications for teaching and assessment practices.

==History==
The publication of &quot;Taxonomy of Educational Objectives&quot; followed a series of conferences from 1949 to 1953, which were designed to improve communication between educators on the design of curricula and examinations. The models were named after Benjamin Bloom, who chaired the committee of educators that devised the taxonomy. He also edited the first volume of the standard text, &quot;Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals&quot;.

The first volume of the taxonomy, &quot;Handbook I: Cognitive&quot; was published in 1956, and in 1964 the second volume &quot;Handbook II: Affective&quot; was published. A revised version of the taxonomy for the cognitive domain was created in 2001.

== Domains ==

=== Cognitive (knowledge-based) ===

In the 1956 original version of the taxonomy, the cognitive domain is divided into six levels of objectives. In the 2001 revised edition of Bloom&#x27;s taxonomy, the levels were renamed and reordered: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create.

* Knowledge: Recognizing or recalling facts, terms, basic concepts, or answers without necessarily understanding their meaning.
* Comprehension: Demonstrating an understanding of facts and ideas by organizing and summarizing information.
* Application: Using acquired knowledge to solve problems in new or unfamiliar situations.
* Analysis: Breaking down information into parts to understand relationships, motives, or causes.
* Synthesis: Building a new whole by combining elements or creating new meaning.
* Evaluation: Making judgments about information, based on set criteria or standards.

=== Affective (emotion-based) ===

Skills in the affective domain describe the way people react emotionally and their ability to feel other living things&#x27; pain or joy. Affective objectives typically target the awareness and growth in attitudes, emotion, and feelings.

There are five levels in the affective domain, moving through the lowest-order processes to the highest:

* Receiving: The lowest level; the student passively pays attention. Without this level, no learning can occur. Receiving is about the student&#x27;s memory and recognition as well.
* Responding: The student actively participates in the learning process. Not only attends to a stimulus, but the student also reacts in some way.
* Valuing: The student attaches a value to an object, phenomenon, or piece of information. The student associates a value or some values to the knowledge they acquired.
* Organizing: The student can put together different values, information, and ideas and accommodate them within their own schema. The student is comparing, relating, and elaborating on what has been learned.
* Characterizing: At this level, the student tries to build abstract knowledge.

=== Psychomotor (action-based) ===

Skills in the psychomotor domain describe the ability to physically manipulate tools or instruments, such as using a hand or a hammer. Objectives in this domain often focus on the development and change of physical skills or behavior.

Although Bloom and his colleagues did not create subcategories for the psychomotor domain, later educators, such as Elizabeth Simpson, proposed a taxonomy for psychomotor skills. Simpson’s taxonomy, introduced in 1972, categorizes psychomotor learning into seven levels, each describing progressively complex physical skills and behaviors. These levels include:

* Perception: Using sensory cues to guide motor activity (e.g., detecting non-verbal communication or adjusting tools based on sensory feedback).
* Set: Readiness to act, including mental, physical, and emotional preparedness.
* Guided response: The early stages of skill acquisition, involving imitation and trial and error.
* Mechanism: Intermediate skill proficiency, where movements become habitual.
* Complex overt response: The skillful and accurate performance of complex tasks.
* Adaptation: The ability to modify movements to fit specific circumstances.
* Origination: Creating new movement patterns to address novel problems or situations.

This taxonomy helps educators frame psychomotor objectives in contexts such as vocational training, sports, and performing arts, where physical dexterity is central to learning outcomes.

==Significance==

=== Theory of knowledge ===
In the appendix to &quot;Handbook I&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot; is defined as involving the recall of specifics, methods, and structures. This definition is a cornerstone of the taxonomy of educational goals, widely applied beyond education, notably in knowledge management. Knowledge is categorized into specific domains: the recall of terminology and facts, understanding methods and conventions, and recognizing patterns and principles in various fields. This framework highlights the complexity of knowledge, spanning from concrete specifics to abstract theories.

=== Criticism of the taxonomy ===
Richard W. Morshead criticized the original taxonomy, noting that it was not a properly constructed taxonomy as it lacked a systematic rationale of construction. This was later acknowledged in the 2001 revision, where the taxonomy was restructured on more systematic lines.

Some critiques of the taxonomy&#x27;s cognitive domain accept the six categories but question the existence of a sequential, hierarchical link. Often, educators may see the taxonomy as a hierarchy and mistakenly dismiss the lower levels as less important for teaching. In response, others have argued that the learning of lower levels supports the development of skills at higher levels, and in certain fields, the most critical skills may reside in the lower levels, such as species identification in natural history. Instructional scaffolding from lower-level to higher-level skills is an application of Vygotskian constructivism.

While some consider the three lower levels hierarchically ordered and the three higher levels parallel, others argue that it can be beneficial to move to application before introducing concepts, particularly in problem-based learning environments where real-world contexts precede theoretical understanding.

The distinction between categories can be seen as artificial, since cognitive tasks often involve multiple processes. Categorizing mental processes into distinct classifications may undermine the interconnected nature of cognition, a critique commonly directed at taxonomies of mental processes. Despite this, the taxonomy is widely used in educational settings to structure learning outcomes, though a 2020 study revealed inconsistencies between institutions in the mapping of action verbs to the taxonomy&#x27;s levels.

=== Implications ===
Bloom&#x27;s taxonomy serves as the backbone of many teaching philosophies, in particular, those that lean more towards skills rather than content. These educators view content as a vessel for teaching skills. The emphasis on higher-order thinking inherent in such philosophies is based on the top levels of the taxonomy including application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Bloom&#x27;s taxonomy can be used as a teaching tool to help balance evaluative and assessment-based questions in assignments, texts, and class engagements to ensure that all orders of thinking are exercised in students&#x27; learning, including aspects of information searching.

=== Connections between disciplines ===
Bloom&#x27;s taxonomy is a source of inspiration for educational philosophy and for developing new teaching strategies, particularly in light of trends in developing global focus on multiple literacies and modalities in learning and the emerging field of integrated disciplines. For example, ability to interface with and create media draws upon skills from both higher and lower-order thinking skills.

<doc id="261132" wikidata="Q1784797" url="?curid=261132" title="RFA Sir Bedivere">
<text>RFA &quot;Sir Bedivere&quot; (L3004) was a Landing Ship Logistic of the Round Table class. She saw service in the Falklands War, the Persian Gulf and Sierra Leone. In 2009, she was commissioned into the Brazilian Navy and renamed NDCC &quot;Almirante Saboia&quot; (G25), where she saw service in Haiti.

==Background==
The ship was originally built for army service, and was taken over by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary in 1970. Round Table class ships were exclusively crewed by Hong Kong Chinese sailors from their introduction in 1963 until 1989, when &quot;Sir Lancelot&quot; was the last RFA to be crewed in this way.

She was commissioned in 1967 and saw extensive service in many of Britain&#x27;s naval operations since. Her home port was Marchwood, Hampshire, which is a major military port.

==Operational history==
===Falklands War===
&quot;Sir Bedivere&quot; first saw combat in the Falklands War of 1982, when along with all of the Royal Navy&#x27;s other amphibious ships, she was sent to recapture the Falkland Islands from an Argentine occupation force. At the start of the war, the ship was at Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, but started back to Marchwood immediately. After loading at Marchwood, she left for Ascension Island where she picked up the sappers of 11 Field Squadron Royal Engineers. The ship suffered slight damage on 24 May whilst lying in San Carlos Water, when an Argentine Skyhawk dropped a bomb that glanced off the ship. The sappers disembarked for Port San Carlos on the evening of 25 May.

On 16 November 1982, she returned from the Falklands with the bodies of 64 members of the British Forces (52 soldiers, 11 Royal Marines, and a Chinese laundryman) whose families had wanted their remains returned.

===1983-2007===
The ship deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1991 in support of Operation Granby.

In 1994, the ship was modernised in a service life extension programme to give it an extra 15 years. The ship was lengthened by 12 metres, had its superstructure altered to a more modern design, the engines were replaced, and the ship&#x27;s bow thrusters were changed for more powerful models.

After returning to service in 1998, the ship was sent to Sierra Leone in 2000 when the U.K. intervened there. The ship operated as the command vessel for British and American mine countermeasures ships during Operation Telic in 2003.

&quot;Sir Bedivere&quot; left the U.K. in September 2002 for the Mediterranean and operation Argonaut in 2002.She was then diverted to the Persian Gulf accompanied by four British minesweepers. After minesweeping operations were complete, the vessel operated as a troop support ship for the Royal Marines. The ship returned to the U.K. on 29 May 2003, carrying the boats and men of 539 Assault Squadron Royal Marines.

In 2006, &quot;Sir Bedivere&quot; returned from Sierra Leone and its part in Operation Vela.

===Decommissioning===
Although originally intended to be used until 2011, &quot;Sir Bedivere&quot; was decommissioned on 18 February 2008.

===Brazilian Navy===
In December 2008, &quot;Sir Bedivere&quot; was sold to Brazil, joining her sister ship . &quot;Sir Bedivere&quot; was handed over to the Brazilian Navy on 21 May 2009, after a major refit by A&amp;P Group at the Company&#x27;s ship repair facility in Falmouth, Cornwall. She was commissioned into service with the Brazilian Navy, and renamed &quot;Navio de Desembarque de Carros de Combate&quot; (Landing Ship, Tank) NDCC &quot;Almirante Saboia&quot; (G-25), after &quot;Almirante de esquadra&quot; Henrique Sabóia, minister of the Navy from 1985 to 1990 under the José Sarney administration. Admiral Saboia&#x27;s widow and other members of the family were present at the handover ceremony.

As &quot;Almirante Saboia&quot;, she undertook several voyages between Port-au-Prince and Rio de Janeiro in support of Brazilian Army and Marine Corps troops in United Nations service during MINUSTAH. In 12 January 2010, she joined the task force that took part in the Brazilian Navy&#x27;s ASPIRANTEX yearly training exercise, which included the frigates Niterói, Constituição and Independência, the tanker Almirante Gastão Motta, as well as the submarines Tupi and Tikuna, sailing under the command of &quot;Contra-Almirante&quot; César Sidonio Daiha Moreira de Souza. During the course of ASPIRANTEX 2010, Almirante Saboia visited the ports of Salvador, Recife, Cabedelo and Natal. However, she was requisitioned after the earthquake, leaving Rio de Janeiro on 1 February with 700 tons of supplies, including both humanitarian aid as well as military supplies for the Brazilian MINUSTAH contingent. She arrived on 17 February, spending the next 30 days in the Caribbean country.

She later took part in the Haiti XIV commission between 21 May and 2 August 2012, carrying 260 tons of Marine Corps and Army supplies to MINUSTAH, and returning to Rio with roughly 300 tons of damaged vehicles and equipment for maintenance.

<text>Cookware and bakeware is food preparation equipment, such as cooking pots, pans, baking sheets etc. used in kitchens. Cookware is used on a stove or range cooktop, while bakeware is used in an oven. Some utensils are considered both cookware and bakeware.

There is a great variety of cookware and bakeware in shape, material, and inside surface. Some materials conduct heat well; some retain heat well. Some surfaces are non-stick; some require seasoning.

Some pots and their lids have handles or knobs made of low thermal conductance materials such as bakelite, plastic or wood, which make them easy to pick up without oven gloves.

A good cooking pot design has an &quot;overcook edge&quot; which is what the lid lies on. The lid has a dripping edge that prevents condensation fluid from dripping off when handling the lid (taking it off and holding it 45°) or putting it down.

==History==


The history of cooking vessels before the development of pottery is minimal due to the limited archaeological evidence. The earliest pottery vessels, dating from , were discovered in Xianrendong Cave, Jiangxi, China. The pottery may have been used as cookware, manufactured by hunter-gatherers. It is also possible to extrapolate likely developments based on methods used by latter peoples. Among the first of the techniques believed to be used by Stone Age civilizations were improvements to basic roasting. In addition to exposing food to direct heat from either an open fire or hot embers, it is possible to cover the food with clay or large leaves before roasting to preserve moisture in the cooked result. Examples of similar techniques are still in use in many modern cuisines.

Of greater difficulty was finding a method to boil water. For people without access to natural heated water sources, such as hot springs, heated stones (&quot;pot boilers&quot;) could be placed in a water-filled vessel to raise its temperature (for example, a leaf-lined pit or the stomach from animals killed by hunters). In many locations the shells of turtles or large mollusks provided a source for waterproof cooking vessels. Bamboo tubes sealed at the end with clay provided a usable container in Asia, while the inhabitants of the Tehuacan Valley began carving large stone bowls that were permanently set into a hearth as early as 7,000 BC.

According to Frank Hamilton Cushing, Native American cooking baskets used by the Zuni (Zuñi) developed from mesh casings woven to stabilize gourd water vessels. He reported witnessing cooking basket use by Havasupai in 1881. Roasting baskets covered with clay would be filled with wood coals and the product to be roasted. When the thus-fired clay separated from the basket, it would become a usable clay roasting pan in itself. This indicates a steady progression from use of woven gourd casings to waterproof cooking baskets to pottery. Other than in many other cultures, Native Americans used and still use the heat source inside the cookware. Cooking baskets are filled with hot stones and roasting pans with wood coals. Native Americans would form a basket from large leaves to boil water, according to historian and novelist Louis L&#x27;Amour. As long as the flames did not reach above the level of water in the basket, the leaves would not burn through.

The development of pottery allowed for the creation of fireproof cooking vessels in a variety of shapes and sizes. Coating the earthenware with some type of plant gum, and later glazes, converted the porous container into a waterproof vessel. The earthenware cookware could then be suspended over a fire through use of a tripod or other apparatus, or even be placed directly into a low fire or coal bed as in the case of the pipkin. Ceramics conduct heat poorly, however, so ceramic pots must cook over relatively low heats and over long periods of time. However, most ceramic pots will crack if used on the stovetop, and are only intended for the oven.

The development of bronze and iron metalworking skills allowed for cookware made from metal to be manufactured, although adoption of the new cookware was slow due to the much higher cost. After the development of metal cookware there was little new development in cookware, with the standard Medieval kitchen utilizing a cauldron and a shallow earthenware pan for most cooking tasks, with a spit employed for roasting.

By the 17th century, it was common for a Western kitchen to contain a number of skillets, baking pans, a kettle and several pots, along with a variety of pot hooks and trivets. Brass or copper vessels were common in Asia and Europe, whilst iron pots were common in the American colonies. Improvements in metallurgy during the 19th and 20th centuries allowed for pots and pans from metals such as steel, stainless steel and aluminium to be economically produced.

At the 1968 Miss America protest, protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a &quot;Freedom Trash Can&quot;, which included pots and pans.

==Cookware materials==
===Metal===
Metal pots are made from a narrow range of metals because pots and pans need to conduct heat well, but also need to be chemically unreactive so that they do not alter the flavor of the food. Most materials that are conductive enough to heat evenly are too reactive to use in food preparation. In some cases (copper pots, for example), a pot may be made out of a more reactive metal, and then tinned or clad with another. While metal pots take heat very well, they usually react poorly to rapid cooling, such as being plunged into water while hot, this will usually warp the piece over time.

====Aluminium====

Aluminium is a lightweight metal with very good thermal conductivity. It is resistant to many forms of corrosion. Aluminium is commonly available in sheet, cast, or anodized forms, and may be physically combined with other metals (see below).

Sheet aluminium is spun or stamped into form. Due to the softness of the metal, it may be alloyed with magnesium, copper, or bronze to increase its strength. Sheet aluminium is commonly used for baking sheets, pie plates, and cake or muffin pans. Deep or shallow pots may be formed from sheet aluminium.

Cast aluminium can produce a thicker product than sheet aluminium, and is appropriate for irregular shapes and thicknesses. Due to the microscopic pores caused by the casting process, cast aluminium has a lower thermal conductivity than sheet aluminium. It is also more expensive. Accordingly, cast aluminium cookware has become less common. It is used, for example, to make Dutch ovens lightweight and bundt pans heavy duty, and used in ladles and handles and woks to keep the sides at a lower temperature than the center.

Anodized aluminium has had the naturally occurring layer of aluminium oxide thickened by an electrolytic process to create a surface that is hard and non-reactive. It is used for sauté pans, stockpots, roasters, and Dutch ovens.

Uncoated and un-anodized aluminium can react with acidic foods to change the taste of the food. Sauces containing egg yolks, or vegetables such as asparagus or artichokes may cause oxidation of non-anodized aluminium.

Aluminium exposure has been suggested as a risk factor for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Of one of which its proponents is Prof. Christopher Exley, who has published his findings. However, the Alzheimer&#x27;s Association states that &quot;studies have failed to confirm any role for aluminum in causing Alzheimer&#x27;s.&quot; The link remains controversial.

====Copper====
Copper provides the highest thermal conductivity among non-noble metals and is therefore fast heating with unparalleled heat distribution &quot;(see: Copper in heat exchangers).&quot; Pots and pans are cold-formed from copper sheets of various thicknesses, with those in excess of 2.5 mm considered commercial (or &quot;extra-fort&quot;) grade. Between 1 mm and 2.5 mm wall thickness is considered utility (&quot;fort&quot;) grade, with thicknesses below 1.5 mm often requiring tube beading or edge rolling for reinforcement. Less than 1mm wall thickness is generally considered decorative, with exception made for the case of .75–1 mm planished copper, which is hardened by hammering and therefore expresses performance and strength characteristic of thicker material.

Copper thickness of less than .25 mm is, in the case of cookware, referred to as foil and must be formed to a more structurally rigid metal to produce a serviceable vessel. Such applications of copper are purely aesthetic and do not materially contribute to cookware performance.

Copper is reactive with acidic foods which can result in corrosion, the byproducts of which can foment copper toxicity. In certain circumstances, however, unlined copper is recommended and safe, for instance in the preparation of meringue, where copper ions prompt proteins to denature (unfold) and enable stronger protein bonds across the sulfur contained in egg whites. Unlined copper is also used in the making of preserves, jams and jellies. Copper does not store (&quot;bank&quot;) heat, and so thermal flows reverse almost immediately upon removal from heat. This allows precise control of consistency and texture while cooking sugar and pectin-thickened preparations. Alone, fruit acid would be sufficient to cause leaching of copper byproducts, but naturally occurring fruit sugars and added preserving sugars buffer copper reactivity. Unlined pans have thereby been used safely in such applications for centuries.

Lining copper pots and pans prevents copper from contact with acidic foods. The most popular lining types are tin, stainless steel, nickel and silver.

The use of tin dates back many centuries and is the original lining for copper cookware. Although the patent for canning in sheet tin was secured in 1810 in England, legendary French chef Auguste Escoffier experimented with a solution for provisioning the French army while in the field by adapting the tin lining techniques used for his cookware to more robust steel containers (then only lately introduced for canning) which protected the cans from corrosion and soldiers from lead solder and botulism poisoning.

Tin linings sufficiently robust for cooking are wiped onto copper by hand, producing a .35–45-mm-thick lining. Decorative copper cookware, i.e., a pot or pan less than 1 mm thick and therefore unsuited to cooking, will often be electroplate lined with tin. Should a wiped tin lining be damaged or wear out the cookware can be re-tinned, usually for much less cost than the purchase price of the pan. Tin presents a smooth crystalline structure and is therefore relatively non-stick in cooking applications. As a relatively soft metal abrasive cleansers or cleaning techniques can accelerate wear of tin linings. Wood, silicone or plastic implements are to preferred over harder stainless steel types.

For a period following the Second World War, copper cookware was electroplated with a nickel lining. Nickel is harder and more thermally efficient than tin, with a higher melting point. Despite its hardness, it wore out as fast as tin, as the plating was 20 microns thick or less, as nickel tends to plate somewhat irregularly, and requires milling to produce an even cooking surface. Nickel is also stickier than tin or silver. Copper cookware with aged or damaged nickel linings can be retinned, or possibly replating with nickel, although this is no longer widely available. Nickel linings began to fall out of favor in the 1980s owing to the isolation of nickel as an allergen.

Silver is also applied to copper by means of electroplating, and provides an interior finish that is at once smooth, more durable than either tin or nickel, relatively non-stick and extremely thermally efficient. Copper and silver bond extremely well owing to their shared high electro-conductivity. Lining thickness varies widely by maker, but averages between 7 and 10 microns. The disadvantages of silver are expense and the tendency of sulfurous foods, especially brassicas, to discolor. Worn silver linings on copper cookware can be restored by stripping and re-electroplating.

Copper cookware lined with a thin layer of stainless steel is available from most modern European manufacturers. Stainless steel is 25 times less thermally conductive than copper, and is sometimes critiqued for compromising the efficacy of the copper with which it is bonded. Among the advantages of stainless steel are its durability and corrosion resistance, and although relatively sticky and subject to food residue adhesions, stainless steel is tolerant of most abrasive cleaning techniques and metal implements. Stainless steel forms a pan&#x27;s structural element when bonded to copper and is irreparable in the event of wear or damage.

Using modern metal bonding techniques, such as cladding, copper is frequently incorporated into cookware constructed of primarily dissimilar metal, such as stainless steel, often as an enclosed diffusion layer (see &quot;coated and composite cookware&quot; below).

====Cast iron====

Cast-iron cookware is slow to heat, but once at temperature provides even heating. Cast iron can also withstand very high temperatures, making cast iron pans ideal for searing. Being a reactive material, cast iron can have chemical reactions with high acid foods such as wine or tomatoes. In addition, some foods (such as spinach) cooked on bare cast iron will turn black.

Cast iron is a somewhat brittle, porous material that rusts easily. As a result, it should not be dropped or heated unevenly and it typically requires seasoning before use. Seasoning creates a thin layer of oxidized fat over the iron that coats and protects the surface from corrosion, and prevents sticking.

Enameled cast-iron cookware was developed in the 1920s. In 1934, the French company Cousances designed the enameled cast iron Doufeu to reduce excessive evaporation and scorching in cast iron Dutch ovens. Modeled on old braising pans in which glowing charcoal was heaped on the lids (to mimic two-fire ovens), the Doufeu has a deep recess in its lid which instead is filled with ice cubes. This keeps the lid at a lower temperature than the pot bottom. Further, little notches on the inside of the lid allow the moisture to collect and drop back into the food during the cooking. Although the Doufeu (literally, &quot;gentlefire&quot;) can be used in an oven (without the ice, as a casserole pan), it is chiefly designed for stove top use. Enameled cast-iron cookware, unlike uncoated cast-iron, is minimally reactive thus can be used with acidic food.

====Stainless steel====
Stainless steel is an iron alloy containing a minimum of 11.5% chromium. Blends containing 18% chromium with either 8% nickel, called 18/8, or with 10% nickel, called 18/10, are commonly used for kitchen cookware. Stainless steel&#x27;s virtues are resistance to corrosion, non-reactivity with either alkaline or acidic foods, and resistance to scratching and denting. Stainless steel&#x27;s drawbacks for cooking use include its relatively poor thermal conductivity. Since the material does not adequately spread the heat itself, stainless steel cookware is generally made as a cladding of stainless steel on both sides of an aluminum or copper core to conduct the heat across all sides, thereby reducing &quot;hot spots&quot;, or with a disk of copper or aluminum on just the base to conduct the heat across the base, with possible &quot;hot spots&quot; at the sides. Typical 18/10 stainless steel also has a relatively low magnetic permeability, making it incompatible with induction cooktops. Recent developments have allowed the production of ferromagnetic 18/10 alloys with a higher permeability. In so-called &quot;tri-ply&quot; cookware, the central aluminum layer is paramagnetic, and the interior 18/10 layer may also, but the exterior layer at the base must be ferromagnetic to be compatible with induction cooktops. Stainless steel does not require seasoning to protect the surface from rust, but may be seasoned to provide a non-stick surface.

====Carbon steel====
Carbon-steel cookware can be rolled or hammered into relatively thin sheets of dense material, which provides robust strength and improved heat distribution. Carbon steel accommodates high, dry heat for such operations as dry searing. Carbon steel does not conduct heat efficiently, but this may be an advantage for larger vessels, such as woks and paella pans, where one portion of the pan is intentionally kept at a different temperature than the rest. Like cast iron, carbon steel must be seasoned before use, usually by rubbing a fat or oil on the cooking surface and heating the cookware on the stovetop or in the oven. With proper use and care, seasoning oils polymerize on carbon steel to form a low-tack surface, well-suited to browning, Maillard reactions and easy release of fried foods. Carbon steel will easily rust if not seasoned and thoroughly dried after cleaning, and should be stored seasoned to avoid rusting. Carbon steel is traditionally used for crêpe and fry pans, as well as woks.

====Clad aluminium or copper====
Cladding is a technique for fabricating pans with a layer of efficient heat conducting material, such as copper or aluminum, covered on the cooking surface by a non-reactive material such as stainless steel, and often covered on the exterior aspect of the pan (&quot;dual-clad&quot;) as well. Some pans feature a copper or aluminum interface layer that extends over the entire pan rather than just a heat-distributing disk on the base. Generally, the thicker the interface layer, especially in the base of the pan, the more improved the heat distribution. Claims of thermal efficiency improvements are, however, controversial, owing in particular to the limiting and heat-banking effect of stainless steel on thermal flows.

Aluminum is typically clad on both the inside and the exterior pan surfaces, providing both a stainless cooking surface and a stainless surface to contact the cooktop. Copper of various thicknesses is often clad on its interior surface only, leaving the more attractive copper exposed on the outside of the pan (see Copper above).

Some cookware use a dual-clad process, with a thin stainless layer on the cooking surface, a thick core of aluminum to provide structure and improved heat diffusion, and a foil layer of copper on the exterior to provide the &quot;look&quot; of a copper pot at a lower price.

===Coating===
====Enamel over steel====
Enameled cast iron cooking vessels are made of cast iron covered with a porcelain surface. This creates a piece that has the heat distribution and retention properties of cast iron combined with a non-reactive, low-stick surface. Such pots are much lighter than most other pots of similar size, are cheaper to make than stainless steel pots, and do not have the rust and reactivity issues of cast iron or carbon steel. Enamel over steel is ideal for large stockpots and for other large pans used mostly for water-based cooking. Because of its light weight and easy cleanup, enamel over steel is also popular for cookware used while camping.
====Seasoning====

Seasoning is the process of treating the surface of a cooking vessel with a dry, hard, smooth, hydrophobic coating formed from polymerized fat or oil. When seasoned surfaces are used for cookery in conjunction with oil or fat a stick-resistant effect is produced.

Some form of post-manufacturing treatment or end-user seasoning is mandatory on cast-iron cookware, which rusts rapidly when heated in the presence of available oxygen, notably from water, even small quantities such as drippings from dry meat. Food tends to stick to unseasoned iron and carbon steel cookware, both of which are seasoned for this reason as well.

Other cookware surfaces such as stainless steel or cast aluminium do not require as much protection from corrosion but seasoning is still very often employed by professional chefs to avoid sticking.

Seasoning of other cookware surfaces is generally discouraged. Non-stick enamels often crack under heat stress, and non-stick polymers (such as Teflon) degrade at high heat so neither type of surface should be seasoned.

==== PTFE non-stick ====


Steel or aluminum cooking pans can be coated with a substance such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, often referred to with the genericized trademark Teflon) in order to minimize food sticking to the pan surface. There are advantages and disadvantages to such a coating. Coated pans are easier to clean than most non-coated pans, and require little or no additional oil or fat to prevent sticking, a property that helps to produce lower fat food. On the other hand, some sticking is required to cause sucs to form, so a non-stick pan cannot be used where a pan sauce is desired. Non-stick coatings tend to degrade over time and are susceptible to damage. Using metal implements, harsh scouring pads, or chemical abrasives can damage or destroy cooking surface.

Non-stick pans must not be overheated. The coating is stable at normal cooking temperatures, even at the smoke point of most oils. However, if a non-stick pan is heated while empty its temperature may quickly exceed , above which the non-stick coating may begin to deteriorate, changing color and losing its non-stick properties.

====Diamond over carbon steel====
Vacuum-brazed diamond cookware is produced by bonding diamond particles to a carbon steel base using a high-temperature (approximately 850–950 °C) vacuum brazing process. This technique is intended to minimize oxidation while creating a durable, scratch-resistant surface. Diamond’s high thermal conductivity (900–2320 W/mK) promotes rapid and even heat distribution, which can be advantageous for high-heat cooking methods such as searing and stir-frying. Hydrogen termination of the diamond particles may further enhance non-stick properties by increasing surface hydrophobicity, and in some designs, silicone resin fillers are used to improve coating integrity. Although it is marketed as a robust alternative to conventional non-stick finishes, its long-term durability remains under study.

===Non-metallic cookware===
Non-metallic cookware can be used in both conventional and microwave ovens. Non-metallic cookware typically can not be used on the stovetop, with the exception of glass-ceramic cookware. Rigid non metallic cookware tends to shatter on sudden cooling or uneven heating, although low expansion materials such as borosilicate glass and glass-ceramics have significant immunity.

====Pottery====
Pottery has been used to make cookware from before dated history. Pots and pans made with this material are durable (some could last a lifetime or more) and are inert and non-reactive. Heat is also conducted evenly in this material. They can be used for both cooking in a fire pit surrounded with coals and for baking in the oven.

====Ceramics====
Glazed ceramics, such as porcelain, provide a nonstick cooking surface. Historically some glazes used on ceramic articles contained levels of lead, which can possess health risks; although this is not a concern with the vast majority of modern ware. Some pottery can be placed on fire directly.

====Glass====
Borosilicate glass is safe at oven temperatures. The clear glass also allows for the food to be seen during the cooking process. However, it cannot be used on a stovetop, as it cannot cope with stovetop temperatures.

====Glass-ceramic====
Glass ceramic is used to make products such as Corningware and Pyroflam, which have many of the best properties of both glass and ceramic cookware. While Pyrex can shatter if taken between extremes of temperature too rapidly, glass-ceramics can be taken directly from deep freeze to the stove top. Their very low coefficient of thermal expansion makes them less prone to thermal shock.

====Stone====
A natural stone can be used to diffuse heat for indirect grilling or baking, as in a baking stone or pizza stone, or the French &quot;pierrade&quot;.

====Silicone====

Silicone bakeware is light, flexible and able to withstand sustained temperatures of 220 °C (428 °F). It melts around 500 °C (930 °F), depending upon the fillers used. Its flexibility is advantageous in removing baked goods from the pan. This rubbery material should not be confused with the silicone resin used to make hard, shatterproof children&#x27;s dishware, which is not suitable for baking.

==Types of cookware and bakeware==

The size and shape of a cooking vessel is typically determined by how it will be used. Intention, application, technique and configuration also have a bearing on whether a cooking vessel is referred to as a pot or a pan. Generally within the classic &quot;batterie de cuisine&quot; a vessel designated &quot;pot&quot; is round, has &quot;ear&quot; handles in diametric opposition, with a relatively high height to cooking surface ratio, and is intended for liquid cooking such as stewing, stocking, brewing or boiling. Vessels with a long handle or ear handles, a relatively low height to cooking surface ratio, used for frying, searing, reductions, braising and oven work take the designation &quot;pan&quot;. Additionally, while pots are round, pans may be round, oval, squared, or irregularly shaped.

===Cookware===

* Braising pans and roasting pans (also known as &quot;braisers&quot;, &quot;roasters&quot; or rondeau pans) are large, wide and shallow, to provide space to cook a roast (chicken, beef or pork). They typically have two loop or tab handles, and may have a cover. Roasters are usually made of heavy-gauge metal so that they may be used safely on a cooktop following roasting in an oven. Unlike most other cooking vessels, roasters are usually rectangular or oval. There is no sharp boundary between braisers and roasters – the same pan, with or without a cover, can be used for both functions. In Europe, clay roasters remain popular because they allows roasting without adding grease or liquids. This helps preserve flavor and nutrients. Having to soak the pot in water for 15 minutes before use is a notable drawback.
* Casserole pots (for making casseroles) resemble roasters and Dutch ovens, and many recipes can be used interchangeably between them. Depending on their material, casseroles can be used in ovens or on stovetops. Casseroles are often made of metal, but are popular in glazed ceramic or other vitreous material as well.
* Dilipots are long thin pots created to sanitize with boiling water.
* Dutch ovens are heavy, relatively deep pots with heavy lids, designed to re-create oven conditions on stovetops or campfires. They can be used for stews, braised meats, soups and a large variety of other dishes that benefit from low-heat, slow cooking. Dutch ovens are typically made from cast iron or natural clay and are sized by volume.
* A wonder pot, an Israeli invention, acts as a Dutch oven but is made of aluminium. It consists of three parts: an aluminium pot shaped like a Bundt pan, a hooded cover perforated with venting holes, and a thick, round, metal disc with a centre hole that is placed between the wonder pot and the flame to disperse heat.
* Frying pans, frypans or skillets provide a large flat heating surface and shallow, sloped sides, and are best for pan frying. Frypans with shallow, rolling slopes are sometimes called omelette pans. Grill pans are frypans that are ribbed, to let fat drain away from the food being cooked. Frypans and grill pans are generally sized by diameter (20–30 cm).
* Spiders are skillets with three thin legs to keep them above an open fire. Ordinary flat-bottomed skillets are also sometimes called spiders, though the term has fallen out of general use.
* Griddles are flat plates of metal used for frying, grilling and making pan breads such as pancakes, injera, tortillas, chapatis and crepes. Traditional iron griddles are circular, with a semicircular hoop fixed to opposite edges of the plate and rising above it to form a central handle. Rectangular griddles that cover two stove burners are now also common, as are griddles that have a ribbed area that can be used like a grill pan. Some have multiple square metal grooves enabling the contents to have a defined pattern, similar to a waffle maker. Like frypans, round griddles are generally measured by diameter (20–30 cm).
** In Scotland, griddles are referred to as &quot;girdles&quot;. In some Spanish-speaking countries, a similar pan is referred to as a &quot;comal&quot;. Crepe pans are similar to griddles, but are usually smaller, and made of a thinner metal.
* Both griddles and frypans can be found in electric versions. These may be permanently attached to a heat source, similar to a hot plate.
* Saucepans are round, vertical-walled vessels used for simmering or boiling. Saucepans generally have one long handle. Larger pans of similar shape with two ear handles are sometimes called &quot;sauce-pots&quot; or &quot;soup pots&quot; (3–12 litres). Saucepans and saucepots are denominated by volume (usually 1–8 L). While saucepots often resemble Dutch ovens in shape, they are generally lighter. Very small saucepans used for heating milk are referred to as &quot;milk pans&quot; - such saucepans usually have a lip for pouring heated milk.
** A variation on the saucepan with sloping sides is called a &quot;Windsor&quot;, &quot;&quot;evasee&quot; or &quot;fait-tout&quot;, and is used for evaporative reducing. Saucepans with rounded sides are called &quot;sauciers&quot;&quot; which also provide more efficient evaporation and generate a return wave when shaken. Both flared saucepan variations tend to dry or cake preparations on their walls, and are less suited to starch-thickened sauces than standard saucepans.
* Sauté pans, used for sautéing, have a large surface-area and relatively low sides to permit rapid evaporation and to allow the cook to toss the food. The word &quot;sauté&quot; comes from the French verb &quot;sauter&quot;, meaning &quot;to jump&quot;. Sauté pans often have straight vertical sides, but may also have flared or rounded sides.
* Stockpots are large pots with sides at least as tall as their diameters. This allows stock to simmer for extended periods of time without major reducing. Stockpots are typically measured in volume (6–36 L). Stock pots come in a large variety of sizes to meet any need from cooking for a family to preparing food for a banquet. A specific type of stockpot exists for lobsters, and Hispanic cultures use an all-metal stockpot, usually called a &quot;caldero&quot;, to cook rice.
* Woks are wide, roughly bowl-shaped vessels, with one or two handles at or near the rim. This shape allows a small pool of cooking oil in the centre of the wok to be heated to a high temperature using relatively little fuel, while the outer areas of the wok are used to keep food warm after it has been fried in the oil. In the Western world, woks are typically used only for stir-frying, but they can be used for anything from steaming to deep frying.

===Bakeware===
Bakeware is designed for use in the oven (for baking), and encompasses a variety of different styles of baking pans as cake pans, pie pans, and bread pans.

* Cake tins (or cake pans in the US) include square pans, round pans, and speciality pans such as angel food cake pans and springform pans often used for baking cheesecake. Another type of cake pan is a muffin tin, which can hold multiple smaller cakes.
* Sheet pans, cookie sheets, and Swiss roll tins are bakeware with large flat bottoms.
* Pie pans are flat-bottomed flare-sided tins specifically designed for baking pies.

<doc id="261145" wikidata="Q242803" url="?curid=261145" title="Yasukuni Shrine">
<text>is a Shinto shrine located in Chiyoda, Tokyo. It was founded by Emperor Meiji in June 1869 and commemorates those who died in service of Japan, from the Boshin War of 1868–1869, to the two Sino-Japanese Wars, 1894–1895 and 1937–1945 respectively, and the First Indochina War of 1946–1954, including war criminals. The shrine&#x27;s purpose has been expanded over the years to include those who died in the wars involving Japan spanning from the entire Meiji and Taishō periods, and the earlier part of the Shōwa period. 

The shrine lists the names, origins, birthdates and places of death of 2,466,532 men. Among those are 1,066 convicted war criminals from the Pacific War, twelve of whom were charged with Class A crimes (the planning, preparation, initiation, or waging of the war). Eleven were convicted on those charges with the twelfth found not guilty on all such charges though he was found guilty of Class B war crimes. The names of two more men charged with Class A war crimes are on the list but one died during trial and one before trial so they were never convicted. 

This has led to many controversies surrounding the shrine. Another memorial at the honden (main hall) building commemorates anyone who died on behalf of Japan and so includes Koreans and Taiwanese who served Japan at the time. The Chinreisha (&quot;Spirit Pacifying Shrine&quot;) building is a shrine built to inter the souls of all the people who died during World War II, regardless of their nationality. It is located directly south of the Yasukuni Honden.

Japanese soldiers fought World War II in the name of Emperor Shōwa, who visited the shrine 8 times between the end of the war and 1975. However, he boycotted the shrine due to his displeasure over the enshrinement of top convicted Japanese war criminals. His successors, Akihito and Naruhito, have never visited the shrine.

==History==

===Foundation for the dead in the Boshin War and Meiji Restoration===

The site for the Yasukuni Shrine, originally named , was chosen by order of the Meiji Emperor. The shrine was established in 1869, in the wake of the Boshin War, in order to honor the souls of those who died fighting for the Emperor. It initially served as the &quot;apex&quot; of a network of similar shrines throughout Japan that had originally been established for the souls of various feudal lords&#x27; retainers, and which continued to enshrine local individuals who died in the Emperor&#x27;s service.

Following the 1877 Satsuma Rebellion, the Emperor had 6,959 souls of war dead enshrined at Tōkyō Shōkonsha. In 1879, the shrine was renamed &quot;Yasukuni Jinja.&quot; The name &quot;Yasukuni&quot;, quoted from the phrase「 in the classical-era Chinese text &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; (Scroll 6, 23rd Year of Duke Xi), literally means &quot;Pacifying the Nation&quot; and was chosen by the Meiji Emperor. The name is formally written as , using the &quot;kyūjitai&quot; character forms common before the end of the Pacific War.
* Among the enshrined are Yoshida Shōin, Sakamoto Ryōma, Takasugi Shinsaku, Nakaoka Shintarō, Takechi Hanpeita, Sanai Hashimoto, and Ōmura Masujirō, who contributed to the Tokugawa shogunate&#x27;s overthrow and the Meiji Restoration during the Bakumatsu period in Japan. In contrast, the shrine does not enshrine the war dead of shogunate retainers such as the soldiers of the former Shogunate forces, the Ouetsu Reppan Domei, the Shinsengumi and the Shogitai.
* Although Saigō Takamori, Eto Shinpei and Maebara Issei made a contribution to the Meiji Restoration, they were not enshrined because they revolted against the Meiji government after that.

===From First Sino-Japanese War to Second Sino-Japanese War===
The enshrinement of war dead at Yasukuni was transferred to military control in 1887. As the Empire of Japan expanded, Okinawans, Ainu and Koreans were enshrined at Yasukuni alongside ethnic Japanese. Emperor Meiji refused to allow the enshrinement of Taiwanese due to the organized resistance that followed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, but Taiwanese were later admitted due to the need to conscript them during World War II.
In 1932, two Sophia University (Jōchi Daigaku) Catholic students refused visit to Yasukuni Shrine on the grounds that it was contrary to their religious convictions. 

In 1936, the Society for the Propagation of the Faith (Propaganda Fide) of the Roman Curia issued the Instruction Pluries Instanterque, and approved visits to Yasukuni Shrine as an expression of patriotic motive. This response allowed the Jesuit university to avoid potential repercussions, though it aligned the institution with the prevailing national policy. 

===During World War II and the GHQ control period===

By the 1930s, the military government sought centralized state control over memorialization of the war dead, giving Yasukuni a more central role. Enshrinements at Yasukuni were originally announced in the government&#x27;s official gazette so that the souls could be treated as national heroes. In April 1944, this practice ended and the identities of the spirits were concealed from the general public. 

The shrine was used as a focal point for fostering military and civilian morale during the war era, often emphasizing dedication to the Emperor. Enshrinement at Yasukuni signified meaning and nobility to those who died for their country. During the final days of the war, it was common for soldiers sent on &quot;kamikaze&quot; suicide missions to say that they would &quot;meet again at Yasukuni&quot; following their death. Some wartime military songs referenced Yasukuni, such as Doki no Sakura(同期の桜) and Calming the country(国の鎮め). At that time, however, the coalition saw that Japan, which was in a tight corner, was using Yasukuni for propaganda purposes. During wartime, Yasukuni Shrine was used as a symbolic motivator for soldiers, with some references in military rhetoric linking enshrinement to notions of sacrifice.

After World War II, the US-led Occupation Authorities (known as GHQ for &quot;General Headquarters&quot;) issued the Shinto Directive, which ordered the separation of church and state and forced Yasukuni Shrine to become either a secular government institution or a religious institution independent from the Japanese government. Yasukuni Shrine has been privately funded and operated since 1946, when it was elected to become an individual religious corporation, independent of the Association of Shinto Shrines. 

Some reports suggest that GHQ considered repurposing the Yasukuni Shrine grounds, but the plan was never implemented. However, Father Bruno Bitter of the Roman Curia and Father Patrick Byrne of Maryknoll insisted to the GHQ that honoring their war dead is the right and duty of citizens everywhere, and the GHQ decided not to destroy the Yasukuni shrine. In 1951, the Roman Curia reaffirmed the 1936 ruling that Catholic visits to Yasukuni Shrine could be acceptable as a patriotic gesture rather than a religious act.

===Post-war issues and controversies===

==== Enshrinement of war criminals ====
In 1956, the shrine authorities and the Ministry of Health and Welfare established a system for the government to share information with the shrine regarding deceased war veterans. By April 1959, most of Japan&#x27;s war dead who were not already enshrined at Yasukuni were enshrined in this manner. War criminals prosecuted by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East were initially excluded from enshrinement after the war. In 1951, government authorities began considering their enshrinement, along with providing veterans&#x27; benefits to their survivors, following the signature of the Treaty of San Francisco. In 1954, government directed some local memorial shrines to accept the enshrinement of war criminals from their area. 

No convicted war criminals were enshrined at Yasukuni until after the parole of the last remaining incarcerated war criminals in 1958. In 1959, the Health and Welfare Ministry began forwarding information on Class B and Class C war criminals (those not involved in the planning, preparation, initiation, or waging of the war) to Yasukuni Shrine. These individuals were gradually enshrined between 1959 and 1967, often without permission from surviving family members. 

In 1966, information on fourteen men who had been charged with Class A war crimes was forwarded to the shrine. Eleven were convicted on these charges, one was convicted of Class B war crimes, and two died before completing trial. This group included the prime ministers and top generals from the war era. In 1970, the shrine passed a resolution to enshrine these individuals. The timing for their enshrinement was left to the discretion of head priest Fujimaro Tsukuba, who delayed the enshrinement through his death in March 1978.

In 1978, his successor Nagayoshi Matsudaira, who rejected the Tokyo war crimes tribunal&#x27;s verdicts, enshrined these fourteen convicted or alleged war criminals in a secret ceremony. Records indicate that after the enshrinement of convicted war criminals in 1978, no Japanese emperor has visited the shrine. In 1979, the details of the enshrinement of war criminals became public, but there was minimal controversy about the issue for several years. No Emperor of Japan has visited Yasukuni since 1975. 

The head-priest Junna Nakata at Honzen-ji Temple (of the Shingon sect &quot;Daigo-ha&quot;) requested the pontiff Pope Paul VI to say a Mass for the repose of the souls of all people in Yasukuni, which would include the 1,618 men condemned as Class A, B and C war criminals, and he promised to do so. In 1980, Pope John Paul II complied, and a Mass was held in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica for all the fallen civilians and fallen dead worshiped in the shrine.

==== Statements by the shrine museum ====
The museum and website of the Yasukuni Shrine have made statements criticizing the United States for &quot;convincing&quot; the Empire of Japan to launch the attack on Pearl Harbor in order to justify the Pacific War, as well as claiming that Japan went to war with the intention of creating a &quot;Co-Prosperity Sphere&quot; for all Asians.

** August 13: Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who ran against Ryutaro Hashimoto for the presidency of the Liberal Democratic Party in 2001, made a campaign pledge to visit the shrine on an annual basis regardless of the criticism it would cause, which won him support among nationalists and helped him become prime minister from 2001 to 2006. He paid his respect at the Yasukuni shrine on August 13, 2001, as a Prime Minister for the first time in 5 years since the last Hashimoto&#x27;s visit. This and following Koizumi&#x27;s annual visits drew extensive criticism from other East-Asian countries, particularly the People&#x27;s Republic of China, where the visits stoked anti-Japanese sentiment and influenced power struggles between pro-Japanese and anti-Japanese leaders within the Chinese Communist Party. The Japanese government officially viewed the visits by Koizumi as private visits in an individual capacity to express respect and gratitude to the many people who lost their lives in the war, and not for the sake of war criminals or to challenge the findings of the Tokyo war crimes tribunal.

The US embassy in Tokyo said it was disappointed with Abe&#x27;s actions and that his visit would exacerbate tensions with Japan&#x27;s neighbours. The United States urged Japan to improve strained relations with neighboring countries in the aftermath of Abe&#x27;s controversial visit to Yasukuni Shrine. South Korea&#x27;s culture minister, Yoo Jin-ryong, criticized Abe by saying that his visit &quot;hurts not only the ties between South Korea and Japan, but also fundamentally damages the stability and co-operation in north-east Asia.&quot; In an official statement, Abe explained that he wished to &quot;report before the souls of the war dead how my administration has worked for one year and to renew the pledge that Japan must never wage a war again. It is not my intention at all to hurt the feelings of the Chinese and Korean people.&quot;

* 2014

==Enshrined deities==
There are over 2,466,000 enshrined &quot;kami&quot; (deities) listed in the Yasukuni&#x27;s &quot;Symbolic Registry of Divinities&quot;. This list includes soldiers, as well as women and students who were involved in relief operations in the battlefield or worked in factories for the war effort. There are neither ashes nor spirit tablets in the shrine. Enshrinement is not exclusive to people of Japanese descent. Yasukuni has enshrined 27,863 Taiwanese and 21,181 Koreans. Many more &quot;kami&quot; – those who fought in opposition to imperial Japan, as well as all war dead regardless of nationality – are enshrined at Chinreisha.

===Eligible categories===
As a general rule, the enshrined are limited to military personnel who were killed while serving Japan during armed conflicts. Civilians who were killed during a war are not included, apart from a handful of exceptions. A deceased must fall into one of the following categories for enshrinement in the &quot;honden&quot;:

# Military personnel, and civilians serving for the military, who were:
#* killed in action, or died as a result of wounds or illnesses sustained while on duty outside the Home Islands (and within the Home Islands after September 1931)
#* missing and presumed to have died as a result of wounds or illnesses sustained while on duty
#* died as a result of war crime tribunals which have been ratified by the San Francisco Peace Treaty
# Civilians who participated in combat under the military and died from resulting wounds or illnesses (includes residents of Okinawa)
# Civilians who died, or are presumed to have died, in Soviet labor camps during and after the war
# Civilians who were officially mobilized or volunteered (such as factory workers, mobilized students, Japanese Red Cross nurses and anti air-raid volunteers) who were killed while on duty
# Crew who were killed aboard Merchant Navy vessels
# Crew who were killed due to the sinking of exchange ships (&quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;Awa Maru&quot;)
# Okinawan schoolchildren evacuees who were killed (&quot;e.g.&quot; the sinking of &quot;Tsushima Maru&quot;)
# Officials of the governing bodies of Karafuto Prefecture, Kwantung Leased Territory, Governor-General of Korea and Governor-General of Taiwan

Although new names of soldiers killed during World War II are added to the shrine list every year, no one who was killed due to conflicts after Japan signed the San Francisco Peace Treaty that formally ended World War II in 1951 has been qualified for enshrinement. Therefore, Yasukuni Shrine enshrines individuals who died in service before Japan’s postwar Self-Defense Forces were established, meaning no post-1951 personnel are included.

Enshrinement is carried out unilaterally by the shrine without consultation of surviving family members and in some cases against the stated wishes of the family members. Some families, particularly from South Korea, have petitioned for the removal of their relatives&#x27; names, arguing that enshrinement contradicts their loved ones&#x27; beliefs. 

===Conflicts===
Japan has participated in 16 other conflicts since the Boshin War in 1869. The following table chronologically lists the number of people enshrined as kami at the &quot;honden&quot; (as of October 17, 2004) from each of these conflicts.

The shrine enshrines those who fought on behalf of the imperial government but does not include members of the Tokugawa shogunate forces or rebel factions from the Boshin War and Satsuma Rebellion. They are enshrined at Chinreisha.

==Precinct==

There are a multitude of facilities within the 6.25 hectare grounds of the shrine, as well as several structures along the 4 hectare causeway. Though other shrines in Japan also occupy large areas, Yasukuni is different because of its recent historical connections. The Yūshūkan museum is just the feature that differentiate Yasukuni from other Shinto shrines. The following lists describe many of these facilities and structures.

===Shrine structures===
On the shrine grounds, there are several important religious structures. The shrine&#x27;s &quot;haiden&quot;, Yasukuni&#x27;s main prayer hall where worshipers come to pray, was originally built in 1901 in styles of &quot;Irimoya-zukuri&quot;, &quot;Hirairi&quot;, and &quot;Doubanbuki&quot; (copper roofing) in order to allow patrons to pay their respects and make offerings. This building&#x27;s roof was renovated in 1989. The white screens hanging off the ceiling are changed to purple ones on ceremonial occasions.

The &quot;honden&quot; is the main shrine where Yasukuni&#x27;s enshrined deities reside. Built in 1872 and refurbished in 1989, it is where the shrine&#x27;s priests perform Shinto rituals. The building is generally closed to the public.

The building located on the right side of &quot;haiden&quot; is the (Assembly Hall), which was rebuilt in 2004. Reception and waiting rooms are available for individuals and groups who wish to worship in the Main Shrine.

The building located directly behind the &quot;Sanshuden&quot; is the (Reception Hall).

The building located directly behind the &quot;honden&quot; is known as the (Repository for the Symbolic Registers of Divinities) built in styles of &quot;Kirizuma-zukuri&quot;, &quot;Hirairi&quot;, and &quot;Doubanbuki&quot;. It houses the —a handmade Japanese paper document that lists the names of all the &quot;kami&quot; enshrined and worshiped at Yasukuni Shrine. It was built of quakeproof concrete in 1972 with a private donation from Emperor Shōwa.

In addition to Yasukuni&#x27;s main shrine buildings, there are also two peripheral shrines located on the precinct. is a small shrine that was first established in Kyoto by sympathizers of the imperial loyalists that were killed during the early weeks of the civil war that erupted during the Meiji Restoration. Seventy years later, in 1931, it was moved directly south of Yasukuni Shrine&#x27;s &quot;honden&quot;. Its name, &quot;Motomiya&quot; (&quot;Original Shrine&quot;), references the fact that it was essentially a prototype for the current Yasukuni Shrine. The second peripheral shrine is the &quot;Chinreisha&quot;. This small shrine was constructed in 1965, directly south of the &quot;Motomiya&quot;. It is dedicated to those not enshrined in the &quot;honden&quot;—those killed by wars or incidents worldwide, regardless of nationality. It has a festival on July 13.

===&quot;Torii&quot; and &quot;Mon&quot; (gates)===
There are several different &quot;torii&quot; and gates located on both the causeway and shrine grounds. When moving through the grounds from east to west, the first &quot;torii&quot; visitors encounter is the &quot;Daiichi Torii&quot; (&quot;Ōtorii&quot;). This large steel structure was the largest &quot;torii&quot; in Japan when it was first erected in 1921 to mark the main entrance to the shrine. It stands approximately 25 meters tall and 34 meters wide and is the first &quot;torii&quot;. The current iteration of this &quot;torii&quot; was erected in 1974 after the original was removed in 1943 due to weather damage. This torii was recently repainted.

The &quot;Daini Torii&quot; (&quot;Seidō Ōtorii&quot;) is the second &quot;torii&quot; encountered on the westward walk to the shrine. It was erected in 1887 to replace a wooden one which had been erected earlier. This is the largest bronze &quot;torii&quot; in Japan. Immediately following the &quot;Daini Torii&quot; is the . A 6-meter tall hinoki cypress gate, it was first built in 1934 and restored in 1994. Each of its two doors bears a Chrysanthemum Crest measuring 1.5 meters in diameter. West of this gate is the (Third Shrine Gate), the last &quot;torii&quot; visitors must pass underneath before reaching Yasukuni&#x27;s &quot;haiden&quot;. It was recently rebuilt of cypress harvested in Saitama Prefecture in 2006.

In addition to the three &quot;torii&quot; and one gate that lead to the main shrine complex, there are a few others that mark other entrances to the shrine grounds. The &quot;Ishi Torii&quot; is a large stone &quot;torii&quot; located on the south end of the main causeway. It was erected in 1932 and marks the entrance to the parking lots. The &quot;Kitamon&quot; and &quot;Minamimon&quot; are two areas that mark the north and south entrances, respectively, into the Yasukuni Shrine complex. The &quot;Minamimon&quot; is marked by a small wooden gateway.

===Memorials===
* Irei no Izumi (Soul-Comforting Spring): This modern looking monument is a spring dedicated to those who suffered from or died of thirst in battle.
* Statue of War Widow with Children: This statue honors the mothers who raised children in the absence of fathers lost at war. It was donated to the shrine in 1974 by these mothers&#x27; children.
* Statue of Kamikaze Pilot: A bronze statue representing a kamikaze pilot stands to the left of the Yūshūkan&#x27;s entrance. A small plaque to the left of the statue was donated by the Tokkōtai Commemoration Peace Memorial Association in 2005. It lists the 5,843 men who died while executing suicide attacks against Allied naval vessels in World War II.
* Statue of Ōmura Masujirō: Created by Okuma Ujihiro in 1893, this statue is Japan&#x27;s first Western-style bronze statue. It honors Ōmura Masujirō, a man who is known as the &quot;Father of the Modern Japanese Army.&quot;

* Monument of Justice Radha Binod Pal: This newer monument was erected at Yasukuni Shrine in 2005. It honours Indian Bengali judge Radha Binod Pal, the lone justice on the International Military Tribunal for the Far East&#x27;s trials of Japanese war crimes committed during World War II to find all the defendants not guilty. On April 29, 2005, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told his counterpart Koizumi Junichiro that &quot;the dissenting judgement of Justice Radha Binod Pal is well known to the Japanese people and will always symbolise the affection and regard our people have for your country.&quot;
* Statues honoring horses, carrier pigeons and dogs killed in war service: These three life-sized bronze statues were all donated at different times during the second half of the 20th century. The first of the three that was donated, the horse statue was placed at the Yasukuni Shrine in 1958 to honor the memory of the horses that were utilized by the Japanese military. Presented in 1982, the statue depicting a pigeon atop a globe honors the homing pigeons of the military. The last statue, donated in March 1992, depicts a German shepherd and commemorates the soldiers&#x27; canine comrades. Opened, full bottles of water are often left at these statues.

The museum is a facility to stores and exhibit relics, and it also houses the weaponry of the Imperial Japanese Navy, notably including a Zero Fighter plane and Kaiten suicide torpedo.

<doc id="261148" wikidata="Q754424" url="?curid=261148" title="Apnea">
<text>Apnea (also spelled apnoea in British English) is the temporary cessation of breathing. During apnea, there is no movement of the muscles of inhalation, and the volume of the lungs initially remains unchanged. Depending on how blocked the airways are (), there may or may not be a flow of gas between the lungs and the environment. If there is sufficient flow, gas exchange within the lungs and cellular respiration would not be severely affected. Voluntarily doing this is called holding one&#x27;s breath.
Apnea may first be diagnosed in childhood, and it is recommended to consult an ENT specialist, allergist or sleep physician to discuss symptoms when noticed; malformation and/or malfunctioning of the upper airways may be observed by an orthodontist.

==Cause==
Apnea can be involuntary—for example, drug-induced (such as by opiate toxicity), mechanically / physiologically induced (for example, by strangulation or choking), or a consequence of neurological disease or trauma. During sleep, people with severe sleep apnea can have over thirty episodes of intermittent apnea per hour every night.

Apnea can also be observed during periods of heightened emotion, such as during crying or accompanied by the Valsalva maneuver when a person laughs. Apnea is a common feature of sobbing while crying, characterized by slow but deep and erratic breathing followed by brief periods of breath holding.

Another example of apnea are breath-holding spells; these are sometimes emotional in cause and are usually observed in children as a result of frustration, emotional stress and other psychological extremes.

Voluntary apnea can be achieved by closing the vocal cords, simultaneously keeping the mouth closed and blocking the nasal vestibule, or constantly activating expiratory muscles, not allowing any inspiration.

==Complications==
Under normal conditions, humans cannot store much oxygen in the body. Prolonged apnea leads to severe lack of oxygen in the blood circulation, leading to dysfunction of organ systems. Permanent brain damage can occur after as little as three minutes and death will inevitably ensue after a few more minutes unless ventilation is restored. However, under special circumstances such as hypothermia, hyperbaric oxygenation, apneic oxygenation (see below), or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, much longer periods of apnea may be tolerated without severe detrimental consequences.

Untrained humans usually cannot sustain voluntary apnea for more than one or two minutes, since the urge to breathe becomes unbearable. The reason for the time limit of voluntary apnea is that the rate of breathing and the volume of each breath are tightly regulated to maintain constant values of CO2 tension and pH of the blood more than oxygen levels. In apnea, CO2 is not removed through the lungs and accumulates in the blood. The consequent rise in CO2 tension and drop in pH result in stimulation of the respiratory centre in the brain which eventually cannot be overcome voluntarily. The accumulation of carbon dioxide in the lungs will eventually irritate and trigger impulses from the respiratory center part of the brain and the phrenic nerve. Rising levels of carbon dioxide signal the body to breathe and resume unconscious respiration forcibly. The lungs start to feel as if they are burning, and the signals the body receives from the brain when CO2 levels are too high include strong, painful, and involuntary contractions or spasms of the diaphragm and the muscles in between the ribs. At some point, the spasms become so frequent, intense and unbearable that continued holding of the breath is nearly impossible.

When a person is immersed in water, physiological changes due to the mammalian diving reflex enable somewhat longer tolerance of apnea even in untrained persons as breathing is not possible underwater. Tolerance can in addition be trained. The ancient technique of free-diving requires breath-holding, and world-class free-divers can hold their breath underwater up to depths of and for more than four minutes. Apneists, in this context, are people who can hold their breath for a long time.

==Hyperventilation==
Voluntary hyperventilation before beginning voluntary apnea is commonly believed to allow the person involved to safely hold their breath for a longer period. In reality, it will give the impression that one does not need to breathe, while the body is actually experiencing a blood-oxygen level that would normally, and indirectly, invoke a strong dyspnea and eventually involuntary breathing. Some have incorrectly attributed the effect of hyperventilation to increased oxygen in the blood, not realizing that it is actually due to a decrease in in the blood and lungs. Blood leaving the lungs is normally fully saturated with oxygen, so hyperventilation of normal air cannot increase the amount of oxygen available, as oxygen in blood is the direct factor. Lowering the concentration increases the pH of the blood, thus increasing the time before blood becomes acidic enough so the respiratory center becomes stimulated, as described above. While hyperventilation will yield slightly longer breath-holding times, any small time increase is at the expense of possible hypoxia, though it might not be felt as easily. One using this method can suddenly lose consciousness unnoticed—a shallow water blackout—as a result. If a person loses consciousness underwater, there is considerable danger that they will drown. An alert diving partner or nearby lifeguard would be in the best position to rescue such a person. Static apnea blackout occurs at the surface when a motionless diver holds their breath long enough for the circulating oxygen in blood to fall below that required for the brain to maintain consciousness. It involves no pressure changes in the body and is usually performed to enhance breath-hold time. It should never be practiced alone, but under strict safety protocols with a safety guard or equipment beside the diver.

==Apneic oxygenation==
Because the exchange of gases between the blood and airspace of the lungs is independent of the movement of gas to and from the lungs, enough oxygen can be delivered to the circulation even if a person is apneic, and even if the diaphragm does not move. With the onset of apnea, low pressure develops in the airspace of the lungs because more oxygen is absorbed than CO2 is released. With the airways closed or obstructed, this will lead to a gradual collapse of the lungs and suffocation. However, if the airways are open, any gas supplied to the upper airways will follow the pressure gradient and flow into the lungs to replace the oxygen consumed. If pure oxygen is supplied, this process will serve to replenish the oxygen stored in the lungs and resume sufficient ventilation. The uptake of oxygen into the blood will then remain at the usual level, and the normal functioning of the organs will not be affected. A consequence of this hyperoxygenation is the occurrence of &quot;nitrogen washout&quot;, which can lead to atelectasis.

However, no CO2 is removed during apnea. The partial pressure of CO2 in the airspace of the lungs will quickly equilibrate with that of the blood. As the blood is loaded with CO2 from the metabolism without a way to remove it, more and more CO2 will accumulate and eventually displace oxygen and other gases from the airspace. CO2 will also accumulate in the tissues of the body, resulting in respiratory acidosis.

Under ideal conditions (i.e., if pure oxygen is breathed before onset of apnea to remove all nitrogen from the lungs, and pure supplemental oxygen is insufflated), apneic oxygenation could theoretically be sufficient to provide enough oxygen for survival of more than one hour&#x27;s duration in a healthy adult. However, accumulation of carbon dioxide (described above) would remain the limiting factor.

Apneic oxygenation is more than a physiologic curiosity. It can be employed to provide a sufficient amount of oxygen in thoracic surgery when apnea cannot be avoided, and during manipulations of the airways such as bronchoscopy, intubation, and surgery of the upper airways. However, because of the limitations described above, apneic oxygenation is inferior to extracorporal circulation using a heart-lung machine and is therefore used only in emergencies, short procedures, or where extracorporal circulation cannot be accessed. Use of PEEP valves is also an accepted alternative (5 cm H2O in average weight patients and 10 cm H2O significantly improved lung and chest wall compliance in morbidly obese patients).

In 1959, Frumin described the use of apneic oxygenation during anesthesia and surgery. Of the eight test subjects in this landmark study, the highest recorded PaCO2 was 250 millimeters of mercury, and the lowest arterial pH was 6.72 after 53 minutes of apnea.

== Apnea scientific studies ==
Studies found spleen volume is slightly reduced during short breath-hold apnea in healthy adults.

==Apnea test in determining brain death==
A recommended practice for the clinical diagnosis of brain death formulated by the American Academy of Neurology hinges on the conjunction of three diagnostic criteria: a coma, absence of brainstem reflexes, and apnea (defined as the inability of the patient to breathe unaided: that is, with no life support systems like ventilators). The apnea test follows a delineated protocol. Apnea testing is not suitable in patients who are hemodynamically unstable with increasing vasopressor needs, metabolic acidosis, or require high levels of ventilatory support. Apnea testing carries the risk of arrhythmias, worsening hemodynamic instability, or metabolic acidosis beyond the level of recovery and can potentially make the patient unsuitable for organ donation (see above). In this situation a confirmatory test is warranted as it is unsafe to perform the apnea test to the patient.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word &quot;apnea&quot; (or &quot;apnoea&quot;) uses combining forms of &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, from , from ἀ-, privative, πνέειν, to breathe. See pronunciation information at &quot;dyspnea&quot;.

<text>Kwon Bo-ah (; born November 5, 1986), known professionally as BoA, is a South Korean singer, songwriter, and actress often called the &quot;Queen of K-pop&quot;.

Born and raised in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea, BoA was discovered by SM Entertainment talent agents when she accompanied her older brother, a music video director, to a talent search in 1998. She was trained for two years and made her debut with &quot;ID; Peace B&quot; (2000). BoA has since released twenty studio albums, including ten in Korean, nine in Japanese, and one in English. On television, she appeared as a judge on the reality competition show &quot;K-pop Star&quot; (2011–2013), as an actress on the television drama &quot;Listen to Love&quot; (2016), as a host for the second season of &quot;Produce 101&quot; (2017), and as a coach for the third season of &quot;The Voice of Korea&quot; (2020).

With the release of her debut Japanese studio album, &quot;Listen to My Heart&quot; (2002), BoA became the first South Korean pop star to break through in Japan following the fall of barriers that had restricted the import and export of entertainment between the countries since the end of World War II. Her Japanese albums &quot;Valenti&quot; (2003) and &quot;Best of Soul&quot; (2005) went on to sell over one million copies each according to Oricon; the latter of which remained the last album to do so by a non-Japanese artist for 16 years. Her self-titled English album (2009) became the first record by a K-pop artist to appear on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, debuting at number 127.

BoA has sold over ten million albums throughout her career and is one of only three female artists with six consecutive number-one studio albums on the Oricon Albums Chart since her debut, alongside Japanese singers Ayumi Hamasaki and Hikaru Utada. She is the recipient of numerous awards in South Korea and Japan, including eight MAMA Awards, six SBS Music Awards, five Japan Record Awards, and five Japan Gold Disc Awards. In 2013, Mnet included her in their Legend 100 Artists list of the most influential artists in South Korea.

==Life and career==
===2000–2003: Debut and commercial success in South Korea and Japan===
Kwon Bo-ah was born on November 5, 1986. At the age of eleven, BoA accompanied her older brother to an SM Entertainment talent search. Though her brother was the one who auditioned as a break-dancer, SM talent scouts instead took notice of BoA and offered her a contract on the same night as the auditions. Her parents initially opposed the notion of BoA leaving school to enter the entertainment business but eventually consented at her older brothers&#x27; persuasion. She has said that her early influence as a singer was Seo Taiji.

BoA underwent two years of training (involving vocal, dance, English, and Japanese lessons), and at the age of thirteen she released her debut album &quot;ID; Peace B&quot; in South Korea on August 25, 2000. The album was moderately successful; it entered the Top 10 of the South Korean charts and sold around 156,000 units. Meanwhile, her Korean record label, SM Entertainment, made arrangements with Japanese label Avex Trax to launch her music career in Japan. She was forced to quit school to prepare and in early 2001, BoA released her first mini-album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Start Now&quot;; it sold around 90,000 units. After its release, she took a hiatus from the Korean music industry to focus on the Japanese market at which time she worked to solidify her skills in Japanese.

BoA began her Japanese music career singing at the Avex-owned club Velfarre. Her debut Japanese album, &quot;Listen to My Heart&quot;, was released on March 13, 2002. The album was a breakthrough in BoA&#x27;s career, becoming an RIAJ-certified million-seller and debuted atop the Oricon, the first album by a Korean artist to do so. It was promoted with several singles: the Top 20 hit &quot;ID; Peace B&quot; (originally from the eponymous album), &quot;Amazing Kiss&quot;, &quot;Kimochi wa Tsutawaru&quot;, the Top 5 hit &quot;Listen to My Heart&quot;, and the Top 10 &quot;Every Heart: Minna no Kimochi&quot;. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, BoA recorded the charity single &quot;The Meaning of Peace&quot; with Kumi Koda as part of Avex&#x27;s Song Nation project to raise funds for charity. From 2001 to 2007, BoA hosted &quot;Beat it BoA&#x27;s World&quot;, a radio program on the Japan FM Network.

After the release of &quot;Listen to My Heart&quot;, BoA released her second Korean studio album, &quot;No. 1&quot;, a month later on April 12, 2002. The album sold around 544,853 units and became the fourth-best-selling record of the year in South Korea. &quot;Jumping into the World&quot; (a Japanese re-release of the mini-album &quot;Don&#x27;t Start Now&quot;) and the Japanese single &quot;Don&#x27;t Start Now&quot; were released a month later on the same day. At the end of the year, BoA released her second Korean mini-album &quot;Miracle&quot;.

BoA&#x27;s second Japanese studio album, &quot;Valenti&quot; (January 2003), became her best-selling album, with over 1,249,000 copies sold. Three singles preceded its release: &quot;Valenti&quot;, which peaked at the number-two position on the Oricon chart, &quot;Kiseki / No.1&quot; and &quot;Jewel Song / Beside You: Boku o Yobu Koe&quot;, both which also peaked at the number-three position. In support of the album, BoA launched &quot;BoA 1st Live Tour Valenti&quot;, her first Japanese concert tour. Later in the same year, BoA released her third Korean-language studio album, &quot;Atlantis Princess&quot; on May 30, 2003, and then released a mini-album &quot;Shine We Are!&quot; on December 4, 2003. The former was the fifth-best-selling South Korean record of the year with around 345,000 units sold; the latter sold around 58,000 units.

===2004–2008: New image, foray into China, and creative control===
Her third Japanese studio album, &quot;Love &amp; Honesty&quot; (January 2004) was a musical &quot;change in direction&quot;: it contained a rock-dance song (&quot;Rock with You&quot;) and &quot;harder&quot; R&amp;B. Though the album failed to match &quot;Valenti&quot; in sales, it topped the Oricon chart for two weeks and became RIAJ-certified triple-platinum. In support of the album, BoA held a tour, &quot;Live Concert Tour 2004: Love &amp; Honesty&quot;, spanning nine performances and attracted approximately 105,000 attendants. In contrast with &quot;1st Live Tour&quot;, which &quot;emphasized exotic Asian design&quot;, the &quot;Love &amp; Honesty&quot; tour had an &quot;outer-space, sci-fi&quot; theme; among the props were a three-storey-high space ship and the robot Asimo. Her first compilation album, &quot;Best of Soul&quot; (February 2005), however, sold over a million copies, making BoA the first non-Japanese Asian singer to have two million-selling albums in Japan. It remained the last album by a foreign artist to have sold over a million copies in Japan for 16 years, until BTS in 2021.

BoA reinvented her image for her fourth and fifth Korean albums, &quot;My Name&quot; (June 2004) and &quot;Girls on Top&quot; (June 2005), shedding the &quot;cute&quot; and &quot;youthful&quot; style that had characterized previous years and adopted a more &quot;sexy&quot; and &quot;sultry&quot; look. The sales of BoA&#x27;s Korean albums began to decline: &quot;My Name&quot; sold 191,000 units and became the eleventh-best-selling South Korean album in 2004 while &quot;Girls on Top&quot; ranked fourteenth in 2005 with 113,000 units sold. In September 2004, BoA instigated controversy in Japan when she donated ₩50 million to a memorial project for Korean independence activist and nationalist An Jung-geun.

Her fourth Japanese studio album, &quot;Outgrow&quot;, (February 2006) reached the number-one spot on the Oricon chart for its first week of release, making it her fourth consecutive original Japanese album to do so. With 220,000 copies sold, it became her lowest-selling first-week debut for a studio album at that point. &quot;Do the Motion&quot;, the first single from the album, reached the top spot, making her the fourth non-Japanese Asian to have a number-one single on the Oricon charts. &quot;Merry Christmas from BoA&quot; (2005), the album&#x27;s last single, was the singer&#x27;s first digital single. That May, BoA renewed her contract with SM Entertainment until 2012. At the time it was noted that she had a shareholding in the company of 100,000 (Approximately worth $1m USD). She performed &quot;Everlasting&quot;, the image song for Roman Polanski&#x27;s Oliver Twist (2005 film). She also voiced Heather the possum in the Korean and Japanese version of the animated film &quot;Over the Hedge&quot;. On September 21, 2006, she released her first digital single in Korea, a Korean version of &quot;Key of Heart&quot;. In support of &quot;Outgrow&quot;, BoA launched a special Zepp tour, B0A The Live, on September 29, 2006, which lasted until October 29. She staged her first Christmas concert on December 7, 2006.

Three singles preceded BoA&#x27;s fifth Japanese studio album, &quot;Made in Twenty&quot; (January 2007): the Top 3 &quot;Nanairo no Ashita (Brand New Beat)/Your Color,&quot; the Top 10 &quot;Key of Heart&quot;, and the No. 2 hit &quot;Winter Love&quot;. The album, which contained R&amp;B and dance songs as well as ballads, debuted at the top of the weekly Oricon charts, making the album her sixth in a row to do so (including one compilation). Having previously compose the song &quot;No More Make Me Sick&quot; for &quot;Made in Twenty&quot;, BoA assumed creative control over her sixth Japanese album, &quot;The Face&quot; (February 2008). The album debuted at the top of the weekly Oricon charts, making BoA one of only two artists in Japan to have six consecutive studio albums top the Oricon weekly charts (the other is Ayumi Hamasaki, who has eight consecutive number-one albums). On June 9, 2008, BoA and nine other artists from around the world recorded an English cover of Wei Wei&#x27;s &quot;Dedication of Love&quot;. Produced by Roald Hoffmann and Brian Alan, the single was used to raise funds for victims of the Sichuan earthquake. But due to a tight schedule, BoA was pulled back from this project. Korean jewelry brand Ramee also released, &quot;Ramee by BoA&quot;, a line of jewelry designed by the singer herself.

===2008–2012: American expansion and return to Asia===

On September 2, 2008, it was announced that BoA would make her American debut under a new subsidiary label, SM Entertainment USA. Hoping to become a &quot;world-renowned entertainer&quot; in the vein of Janet Jackson, BoA&#x27;s debut American single &quot;Eat You Up&quot;, was produced by Thomas Troelsen, and released on October 21, 2008. It charted at No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart. To promote the single, BoA performed &quot;Eat You Up&quot; as well as other songs at YouTube&#x27;s Tokyo Live concert, and performed in New York City on December 3, 2008, as well as the Jingle Ball at the Anaheim Honda Center on December 6, 2008. The following year, she released &quot;Eien/Universe/Believe in Love&quot; and was also featured in Ravex&#x27;s single &quot;Believe in Love&quot;.

BoA&#x27;s self-titled English album was released in the U.S. on March 17 and featured tracks by producers Bloodshy and Avant as well as a duet with Sean Garrett. Her second Japanese compilation album, &quot;Best &amp; USA&quot; was released on March 18 tying together a compilation of recent hits in Japan with her English-language debut. Though she stated that &quot;[i]t has always been my dream to debut in America,&quot; she found English tougher to learn than Japanese and despite living in West Beverly Hills, found it difficult to make friends. BoA later headlined the San Francisco Pride Festival on June 28, 2009, alongside Solange Knowles and The Cliks, where she also performed the song &quot;Energetic&quot; for the first time in public, in addition to &quot;Eat You Up&quot; and &quot;I Did It for Love&quot;. On August 31, SM USA released &quot;BoA Deluxe&quot;, a repackaged version of her debut English album. The album contained two new tracks and the radio edit version of &quot;Energetic&quot;.
With her U.S. career struggling to gain traction, BoA returned to East Asia to release her seventh Japanese album, &quot;Identity&quot; (February 2010). Promoted by the singles &quot;Bump Bump!&quot; featuring Verbal from M-Flo and &quot;&quot; (December 2009), the album only charted at No. 4, selling 37,606 copies in its first week. With little promotion from her label, it ended her run of six consecutive No. 1 albums, suggesting that it would be impossible for her to sustain her career in three territories simultaneously. Her first Korean album in five years, &quot;Hurricane Venus,&quot; was released on August 5, 2010, and sold 55,776 units making it the 22nd best selling album in South Korea for 2010. She also represented South Korea and performed at the 7th Asia Song Festival, organized by &quot;Korea Foundation for International Culture Exchange&quot;, at the Seoul Olympic Stadium.

BoA made her Hollywood movie debut in the dance film &quot;Make Your Move 3D&quot;, playing the character Aya opposite Derek Hough. Although production ended in 2011, the film was released in 2013. The movie received mixed reviews, with Inkoo Kang of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praising the choreography but stating that &quot;[w]henever actor Derek Hough and BoA stop leaping and twirling, [it] is an underwritten mess.&quot; To celebrate the 10th anniversary of her Japanese debut, BoA released &quot;Milestone&quot;, which ranked at No. 4 on the Oricon Weekly Music-DVD charts. She also held her 10th anniversary concert from December 10 to 11 at Tokyo International Forum.

Following the concert, BoA shifted her activities to her native county, joining the judging panel on SBS&#x27;s audition program &quot;K-pop Star&quot; as a representative of S.M. Entertainment, alongside Yang Hyun-suk from YG Entertainment and Park Jin-young from JYP Entertainment. BoA received praise for her ability as a judge with her insightful comments and discerning eyes, and also sang the theme song &quot;One Dream&quot;. For her seventh Korean album, &quot;Only One&quot; (July 2012), BoA wrote and composed its title track, while its dance steps choreographed by NappyTabs, who has previously worked with BoA in &quot;Cobu&quot;. Upon its release, &quot;Only One&quot; achieved an all-kill on several music charts. She followed this up with the second &quot;The Shadow&quot;, was released August 18, 2012. Additionally, she recorded the song &quot;Lookin&#x27;&quot; featuring The Quiett for Hyundai&#x27;s &#x27;Premium Younique Lifestyle&#x27; campaign.

===2013–2015: Music production, television role, and 15th anniversary===

BoA launched her first Korean tour with BoA Special Live 2013: Here I Am tour at the Olympic Hall, and released the song &quot;Disturbance&quot;, which she wrote and composed, to commemorate her first concert tour in South Korea. In September 2013, BoA starred in KBS&#x27; two-episode drama special &quot;Expect to Date&quot; alongside Choi Daniel and Im Si-wan, her full first role in a drama, following a string of cameo appearances. She received praise for her acting performance. She also participated in &quot;Infinity Challenge&#x27;s&quot; bi-annual song festival and was paired with Leessang&#x27;s Gil, with the two co-produced the song &quot;G.A.B&quot;. In March 2014, BoA was appointed as a de facto creative director in S.M. Entertainment, alongside labelmate Kangta; she was placed in charge of mental care of artists who debut at a young age.

The singles for BoA&#x27;s eighth Japanese album, &quot;Who&#x27;s Back?&quot; (September 2014), were released over a span of four years prior to the album&#x27;s release:&quot;Woo Weekend&quot; and &quot;I See Me&quot; in 2010, &quot;Milestone&quot; in 2011, Only One&quot;, &quot;Tail of Hope&quot; and &quot;Message / Call My Name&quot; in 2013, and &quot;Shout It Out&quot; and &quot;Masayume Chasing&quot; in 2014. To promote the album, she embarked on her BoA Live Tour 2014 Who&#x27;s Back? tour in September, her first Japanese tour in four years. After the tour concluded, BoA starred in her first Korean film, &quot;Big Match&quot; alongside Lee Jung-jae and Shin Ha-kyun though a Japanese single &quot;Fly&quot; was released on December 3, 2014.

Her eighth Korean album &quot;Kiss My Lips&quot; (May 2015) became her first entirely self-written, self-produced album, working alongside American producers The Underdogs and Stereotypes. The single &quot;Who Are You&quot; (feat. Gaeko) was released prior to the album&#x27;s unveiling, along with its accompanying music video, which starred EXO&#x27;s Sehun as the male lead. The rest of the album was unveiled on May 12 along with an official music video of the eponymous title track. &quot;Billboard&quot; called the singer a promising songwriter despite moments of musical blandness.

In July, she performed at the BoA Special Live 2015: Nowness to commemorate her 15th anniversary. The concert took place on August 22 and 23 at the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts in South Korea, making BoA the first female idol to hold a solo concert at the venue. This was followed by BoA Special Live 2015: Nowness in Japan which took place on December 11, 2015, at Tokyo International Forum Hall-A. Her 15th anniversary in Japan the following year was celebrated in a similar fashion, including the release of the song &quot;Lookbook&quot;, and a 15th anniversary edition of BoA&#x27;s Japanese Winter hit, &quot;Meri Kuri&quot;. As part of S.M. Entertainment&#x27;s special winter project, &quot;Winter Garden,&quot; BoA released a digital single entitled &quot;Christmas Paradise&quot;.

===2016–present: Musical projects, television production, and acting debut===
On January 12, 2016, BoA released an English-language single &quot;Make Me Complete&quot;, which serves as the theme song for the Fuji TV special drama &quot;Ooku&quot;, starring Sawajiri Erika and Watanabe Mayu. In June, she collaborated with Korean rapper Beenzino for S.M. Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;SM Station&quot; project. The duo released the single &quot;No Matter What&quot;, which ranked atop five domestic charts. BoA worked with BeatBurger for another &quot;SM Station&quot; single titled &quot;Music Is Wonderful&quot;, where she participated in the composing and writing of the track. From October to November 2016, BoA starred in JTBC&#x27;s romance melodrama &quot;Listen to Love&quot;, returning to the small screen after three years.

The following year, BoA became one of the producers for Mnet&#x27;s boy group survival reality show, &quot;Produce 101 Season 2&quot;, which aired from April 7 to June 16. BoA later released another song for &quot;SM Station&quot;, &quot;Spring Rain&quot;, an R&amp;B number produced by Kenzie. In May, BoA embarked on her BoA The live in &quot;Billboard&quot; Live Tour, held in Tokyo and Osaka. She also released the single &quot;Camo,&quot; a dance song with a heavy emphasis on bass and synthesizer sounds, which was a change in sound from her previous materials and produced by The Underdogs. In July, she released the Japanese single &quot;Right Here, Right Everywhere&quot; for the soundtrack of drama &quot;Yaneura no Koibito&quot;. She later starred in the film &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; alongside Lee Hak-joo, playing a terminally ill patient.
In 2018, BoA returned to Japan and released her ninth Japanese album &quot;Watashi Konomama de Iinokana&quot; on February 14, 2018, followed by EP &quot;Unchained&quot; in March. To accompany the release of the EP, she embarked on the BoA The Live 2018: Unchained Tour from March 15 to April 4. People who attend the concerts received a copy of &quot;Unchained&quot;. On January 31, she released &quot;Nega Dola&quot;, which served as a single for BoA&#x27;s then-upcoming first extended play. The EP, &quot;One Shot, Two Shot&quot;, was released on February 20, alongside its titular lead single and the song&#x27;s music video. The EP peaked at number six at the South Korean Gaon Album Chart and number seven at the &quot;Billboard&quot; World Albums Chart. On October 24, she released her ninth Korean album &quot;Woman&quot; alongside a lead single of the same name. The album peaked at number six at the Gaon Album Chart, number eleven at the &quot;Billboard&quot; World Albums Chart.

On June 4, 2019, she released the single &quot;Feedback&quot;, which features rapper Nucksal, alongside the song&#x27;s music video. BoA embarked on her #Mood Tour, which had six dates in Japan and two dates in Seoul, from September to October 2019. On October 23, she released a new Japanese single, &quot;Wishing Well&quot;, which she earlier debuted on the tour. On December 11, 2019, she released her second extended play &quot;Starry Night&quot;.

In May 2020, BoA was featured as one of the coaches for the third season of The Voice of Korea, alongside Dynamic Duo, Sung Si-kyung, and Kim Jong-kook. On December 1, 2020, she released her tenth Korean album &quot;Better&quot;. SpoTV News shared BoA to join as a judge for Mnet Dance program &quot;Street Woman Fighter&quot;. It is a female dance crew competition premiering in August 2021. On November 5, 2021, BoA released the Japanese single, &quot;My Dear&quot;, to commemorate her 20th anniversary.

BoA was revealed as a member of the supergroup Got the Beat on December 27, 2021. The group debuted on January 3, 2022. To celebrate her 20th anniversary, BoA released the Japanese compilation album &quot;The Greatest&quot; on May 30, 2022. On November 8, 2022, BoA announced her third EP &quot;Forgive Me&quot; along with the title track on the same name on November 22, 2022. In 2024, BoA appeared in the drama &quot;Marry My Husband&quot;, where she played Oh Yu-ra. Her performance in the drama was met with negative reviews.

==Image and artistry==

BoA lists hip hop as her main musical influence, though she also enjoys R&amp;B. Her favorite musicians are Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Justin Timberlake, and Ne-Yo; as a result, much of BoA&#x27;s music is either dance-pop or R&amp;B. Because she also sings ballads, she is often compared to Japanese singers Namie Amuro and Ayumi Hamasaki. Her debut album, &quot;ID; Peace B&quot;, contained urban pop, &quot;slickly produced&quot; ballads, and &quot;upbeat dance tunes&quot;. As her career went on, she began experimenting with different styles: &quot;Valenti&quot; contained mostly ballads; &quot;Love and Honesty&quot; was an experiment with &quot;harder&quot; R&amp;B and rock music.

Though her earlier releases were marked by a &quot;cute&quot; and &quot;youthful&quot; style, BoA began to present a more &quot;mature&quot; image starting from the album &quot;My Name&quot;. In a &quot;Talk Asia&quot; interview, Anjali Rao noted that some felt that &quot;My Name&quot; marked the beginning of BoA&#x27;s decline in popularity and asked if the public would always see the singer as &quot;Little Baby BoA&quot;; BoA replied, &quot;So while I apologize to those people who still want the baby BoA, in fact, what can I do? I just keep growing up! I can&#x27;t stop that from happening.&quot;

&quot;The Face&quot; was influenced by electropop and included &quot;happy spring&quot; songs (&quot;Sweet Impact&quot; and &quot;Bad Drive&quot;), a guitar-driven &quot;groovy dance&quot; song (&quot;Lose Your Mind&quot;), and ballads. Because the composition and writing of BoA&#x27;s songs is handled mostly by her staff, BoA has been criticized as being a &quot;manufactured pop star&quot;. In response to such criticism, BoA said that &quot;if one person were to force their own will on something, then things that should have gone right could easily go wrong&quot; and that she is &quot;not all that unhappy with the expression that [she is] a manufactured star. In a way, that is true. Because SM Entertainment created the environment and all the surrounding conditions, [she is] able to be successful in the way [she is] now.&quot; She later assumed creative control with &quot;The Face,&quot; while &quot;Kiss My Lips&quot; became her first entirely self-written, self-produced album.

BoA has collaborated with high-profile artists. Among the Japanese artists she has performed with are the hip hop group M-Flo (for the single &quot;The Love Bug&quot;), pop singer Kumi Koda, and house DJ Mondo Grosso. She has performed with Western artists: the song &quot;Flying Without Wings&quot; from her album &quot;Next World&quot; was a collaboration with Irish band Westlife covering the original song; the Bratz single &quot;Show Me What You Got&quot; was performed with Howie D of the American band Backstreet Boys. She also worked with Akon, singing the song &quot;Beautiful&quot;, which was featured on the Japanese release of his third album, &quot;Freedom&quot;. Other artists she has collaborated with are Soul&#x27;d Out, Dabo, Verbal (of M-Flo), Rah-D, Seamo, TVXQ, Yutaka Furakawa (of the band Doping Panda), and Crystal Kay (for her single &quot;After Love: First Boyfriend/Girlfriend&quot;). American rock band Weezer covered &quot;Meri Kuri&quot; on the Japanese version of their album &quot;Weezer&quot;.

==Cultural impact and legacy==
BoA is regarded as one of South Korea&#x27;s most influential and prominent singers and is widely referred to as the &quot;Queen of K-pop&quot;, in recognition of her contributions in spearheading the Korean wave into Japan. BoA&#x27;s success in the Japanese market has been deemed a catalyst in the Japanese interest in Korean pop music beginning in the early 2000s, when the two countries began promoting cultural exchanges since the end of World War II. Music critics have recognized BoA for improving &quot;civil relations between the Korean and Japanese public through her music and appearances in Japanese radio and television&quot;, with Oxford Political Review noting &quot;BoA&#x27;s role in strengthening Japan-South Korea ties as a cultural envoy&quot;. In Alisa Freedman&#x27;s &quot;Introducing Japanese Pop Culture&quot;, BoA was noted for &quot;herald[ing] a new phase of Japanese engagement with Korean singers&quot;, registering &quot;remarkable success during the first half of the 2000s in Japan&quot;. She highlighted that the timing of her success coincided with several political and cultural developments; these of which include the implementation of Korea&#x27;s Open-Door Policy, the Korea Japan 2002 FIFA World Cup, and the popularity of the drama series &quot;Winter Sonata&quot;. Freedman evaluated BoA&#x27;s career path and localization strategies in Japan for having set &quot;the first trend&quot; of the Korean wave into the country.

Vox hailed BoA as &quot;one of South Korea&#x27;s best-known exports&quot; in the years after her debut while &quot;The Korea Times&quot; called BoA &quot;the forerunner of the new generation of idols who popularized K-pop in Japan and elsewhere.&quot; In 2004, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism honored BoA with the Asian Cultural Exchange Merit Award for her contributions in raising the status of K-pop throughout Asia. &quot;The Diplomat&quot; stated that BoA &quot;paved the way&quot; for future K-pop artists &quot;to later captivate Japanese fans despite souring relations between Seoul and Tokyo.&quot; Music critic Lim Jin-mo wrote that BoA &quot;opened many doors for pop acts from her country in the second largest music market in the world&quot;, acting &quot;as a figurehead for breakthroughs in Japan for South Korean acts&quot; and became &quot;a pivotal figure in K-pop&#x27;s history&quot;. Yim Hyun-su from &quot;The Korea Herald&quot; viewed her for &quot;forever changing the landscape of South Korea&#x27;s music industry&quot;. In 2016, she was honored with the Presidential Commendation at the Korean Popular Culture and Arts Awards for her contributions to the spread of the Korean wave, and for laying &quot;the foundation for the revival of K-pop&quot;.

In 2013, 50 music experts, professors and critics organized by Mnet named BoA one of the 100 most influential artists in South Korean music. &quot;No. 1&quot; was ranked number 27 in a 2006 Gallup Korea survey of 100 all-time favorite Korean songs and was included in Mnet&#x27;s Legend 100 list of popular Korean songs since the 1960s. In 2021, a panel of 35 music experts organized by Melon and &quot;Seoul Shinmun&quot; ranked &quot;No. 1&quot; and &quot;Atlantis Princess&quot; number 1 and number 93 in their list of the greatest K-pop songs of all time. Critic Rhian Daly for &quot;The Forty-Five&quot; ranked &quot;Atlantis Princess&quot; number 1 in her list of the best K-pop songs of all-time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;No. 1&quot; at number 18 in their list of the greatest songs in the history of K-pop, writing it represents &quot;her most emblematic crossover hit&quot;.

BoA has been cited by many artists in the South Korean music industry as an influence and role model, including Aespa, Girls&#x27; Generation&#x27;s Taeyeon, Sunny, Tiffany, Hyoyeon, Seohyun, Shinee&#x27;s Key, Exo&#x27;s Sehun, Red Velvet&#x27;s Irene, Ailee, Chungha, Yukika Teramoto, Kwon Eun-bi, Baek A-yeon, Mamamoo&#x27;s Solar, f(x)&#x27;s Luna, Kiss of Life&#x27;s Natty, Lovelyz&#x27;s Kei, and Billlie&#x27;s Tsuki. Aespa&#x27;s Giselle said in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview that &quot;Everyone knows her. She&#x27;s not just famous — she&#x27;s a legend&quot;.

== Other ventures ==

===Endorsements===
Because of her wide appeal, BoA has appeared in advertisements for many brands. Among the brands she has promoted are Olympus, Lotte, Nike, L&#x27;Oréal, Japanese cosmetic company Kosé, Skechers, Audio-Technica, GM Daewoo and L&#x27;Occitane. Several of her songs have been used in affiliation with television shows. &quot;Every Heart: Minna no Kimochi&quot; was used as the ending theme for the anime &quot;InuYasha&quot;; &quot;Beside You: Boku o Yobu Koe&quot; was used as the opening theme for the anime &quot;Monkey Typhoon&quot;; &quot;Key of Heart&quot; is the theme song for the Japanese release of &quot;Over the Hedge&quot;; &quot;Your Color&quot; is the theme song of the video game &quot;Ninety-Nine Nights&quot;; &quot;Mamoritai: White Wishes&quot; is the theme song of the video game &quot;Tales of Graces&quot;. &quot;Tail of Hope&quot; was used as the theme for the Japanese drama &quot;Hakui no Namida,&quot; and &quot;Masayume Chasing&quot; was used as the 15th opening theme song for the anime &quot;Fairy Tail.&quot;

In 2007, Anycall (a Samsung brand) signed BoA, Xiah (of TVXQ), Tablo (of Epik High), and jazz pianist Jin Bora onto &quot;Anyband&quot;, a band created specifically to promote Anycall. The band released only one single, &quot;AnyBand&quot;. In December 2010, she recorded &quot;I See Me&quot; for to promote Audio Technica headphones in Japan. The song &quot;Woo Weekend&quot; was used to promote Disney on Ice&#x27;s 25th Anniversary in Japan while &quot;Lookbook&quot; served as the ending theme for the NTV Kei program &quot;Tokui to Goto to Uruwashi no Shelley ga Konya Kurabete Mimashita.&quot; BoA served as ambassador for Asia Youth Day in 2014. In August 2017, it was announced that BoA was chosen as promotional ambassador for Jeju Biennale, an inaugural international art event on the resort island of Jeju. Her widespread popularity has also made her a &quot;cultural ambassador&quot;; she has represented South Korea in inter-Asian musical events and has appeared in an Oxford University Press-published English-language textbook.

<doc id="261151" wikidata="Q849263" url="?curid=261151" title="XML pipeline">
<text>In software, an XML pipeline is formed when XML (Extensible Markup Language) processes, especially XML transformations and XML validations, are connected.

For instance, given two transformations T1 and T2, the two can be connected so that an input XML document is transformed by T1 and then the output of T1 is fed as input document to T2. Simple pipelines like the one described above are called &quot;linear&quot;; a single input document always goes through the same sequence of transformations to produce a single output document.

== Linear operations ==
Linear operations can be divided in at least two parts

=== Micro-operations ===
They operate at the inner document level
* Rename - renames elements or attributes without modifying the content
* Replace - replaces elements or attributes
* Insert - adds a new data element to the output stream at a specified point
* Delete - removes an element or attribute (also known as pruning the input tree)
* Wrap - wraps elements with additional elements
* Reorder - changes the order of elements

=== Document operations ===
They take the input document as a whole
* Identity transform - makes a verbatim copy of its input to the output
* Compare - it takes two documents and compare them
* Transform - execute a transform on the input file using a specified XSLT file. Version 1.0 or 2.0 should be specified.
* Split - take a single XML document and split it into distinct documents

=== Sequence operations ===
They are mainly introduced in XProc and help to handle the sequence of document as a whole
* Count - it takes a sequence of documents and counts them
* Identity transform - makes a verbatim copy of its input sequence of documents to the output
* split-sequence - takes a sequence of documents as input and routes them to different outputs depending on matching rules
* wrap-sequence - takes a sequence of documents as input and wraps them into one or more documents

== Non-linear ==

Non-linear operations on pipelines may include:

* Conditionals — where a given transformation is executed if a condition is met while another transformation is executed otherwise
* Loops — where a transformation is executed on each node of a node set selected from a document or a transformation is executed until a condition evaluates to false
* Tees — where a document is fed to multiple transformations potentially happening in parallel
* Aggregations — where multiple documents are aggregated into a single document
* Exception Handling — where failures in processing can result in an alternate pipeline being processed

Some standards also categorize transformation as macro (changes impacting an entire file) or micro (impacting only an element or attribute)

== XML pipeline languages ==

XML pipeline languages are used to define pipelines. A program written with an XML pipeline language is implemented by software known as an XML pipeline engine, which creates processes, connects them together and finally executes the pipeline. Existing XML pipeline languages include:

=== Standards ===
* XProc: An XML Pipeline Language is a W3C Recommendation for defining linear and non-linear XML pipelines.

=== Product-specific ===
* W3C XML Pipeline Definition Language is specified in a W3C Note.
* W3C XML Pipeline Language (XPL) Version 1.0 (Draft) is specified in a W3C Submission and a component of Orbeon Presentation Server OPS (now called Orbeon Forms). This specification provides an implementation of an earlier version of the language. XPL allows the declaration of complex pipelines with conditionals, loops, tees, aggregations, and sub-pipelines. XProc is roughly a superset of XPL.
* Cocoon sitemaps allow, among other functionality, the declaration of XML pipelines. Cocoon sitemaps are one of the earliest implementations of the concept of XML pipeline.
* smallx XML Pipelines are used by the smallx project.
* ServingXML defines a vocabulary for expressing flat-XML, XML-flat, flat-flat, and XML-XML transformations in pipelines.
* PolarLake Circuit Markup Language used by PolarLake&#x27;s runtime to define XML pipelines. Circuits are collections of paths through which fragments of XML stream (usually as SAX or DOM events). Components are placed on paths to interact with the stream (and/or the outside world) in a low latency process.
* xmlsh is a scripting language based on the unix shells which natively supports xml and text pipelines 
* Stylus Studio XML Pipeline is a visual grammar which defines the following operations: Input, Output, XQuery, XSLT, Validate, XSL-FO to PDF, Convert To XML, Convert From XML, Choose, Warning, Stop.

== Pipe granularity ==
Different XML Pipeline implementations support different granularity of flow.

* Document: Whole documents flow through the pipe as atomic units. A document can only be in one place at a time. Though usually multiple documents may be in the pipe at once.
* Event: Element/Text nodes events may flow through different paths. A document may be concurrently flowing through many components at the same time.

== Standardization ==

Until May 2010, there was no widely used standard for XML pipeline languages. However, with the introduction of the W3C XProc standard as a W3C Recommendation as of May 2010, widespread adoption can be expected.

== History ==

* 1972 Douglas McIlroy of Bell Laboratories adds the pipe operator to the UNIX command shell. This allows the output from one shell program to go directly into input of another shell program without going to disk. This allowed programs such as the UNIX awk and sed to be specialized yet work together . For more details see Pipeline (Unix).
* 1993 Sean McGrath developed a C++ toolkit for SGML processing.
* 1998 Stefano Mazzocchi releases the first version of Apache Cocoon, one of the first software programs to use XML pipelines.
* 1998 PolarLake build XML Operating System, which includes XML Pipelining.
* 2002 Notes submitted by Norman Walsh and Eve Maler from Sun Microsystems, as well as a W3C Submission submitted in 2005 by Erik Bruchez and Alessandro Vernet from Orbeon, were important steps toward spawning an actual standardization effort. While neither submission directly became a W3C recommendation, they were considered key sources of inspiration for the W3C XML Processing Working Group.
* September 2005 W3C XML Processing Working Group started. The task of this working group was to create a specification for an XML pipelining language.
* August 2008, xmlsh, an XML pipeline language was announced at Balisage 2008

<doc id="261156" wikidata="Q614889" url="?curid=261156" title="Fred Flintstone">
<text>Fred Flintstone is the main character of the animated sitcom &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, which aired during prime-time on ABC during the original series&#x27; run from 1960 to 1966. Fred is the husband of Wilma Flintstone and father of Pebbles Flintstone and together the family live in their homely cave in the town of Bedrock. His best friend is his next door neighbor, Barney, who has a wife named Betty.

Fred lives in the fictional prehistoric town of Bedrock, a world where dinosaurs coexist with modernized cavepeople and the cavepeople enjoy &quot;primitive&quot; versions of modern conveniences such as telephones, automobiles, and washing machines. Fred&#x27;s trademark catchphrase yell is &quot;yabba dabba doo!&quot;, a phrase that was originally his club&#x27;s cheer, and later adopted as part of the theme song from the third season on and used in the 1994 live-action &quot;Flintstones&quot; film.

Since the original series&#x27; run, Fred has appeared in various other cartoon spinoffs, live action adaptations, music videos, video games, and commercials.

==Biography==
While the mid-1980s spin-off series &quot;The Flintstone Kids&quot; depicts Fred as a child, the series may be apocryphal due to its presenting Wilma as a childhood friend of Fred and Barney; the original series asserts that they first met as young adults. Still, the series&#x27; depiction of Fred as the only child of Ed (a handyman) and Edna (homemaker) Flintstone might be canon. (Pops Flintstone was in a comic strip.)

As young adults, Fred and Barney worked as bellhops at a resort. There, they met and fell in love with Wilma and Betty, who were working there as cigarette girls. Fred met Wilma&#x27;s mother, Pearl Slaghoople, and the two took an instant dislike to each other. An unspecified amount of time later, Fred married Wilma.

Fred is a typical blue-collar worker, who works as a &quot;bronto crane operator&quot; at Slate Rock and Gravel Company (also known as Rockhead and Quarry Cave Construction Company in earlier episodes). Fred&#x27;s job title in the second-season episode &quot;Divided We Sail&quot; is &quot;geological engineer&quot;.

During the original series&#x27; third season, Wilma gives birth to the couple&#x27;s daughter, Pebbles. Years later, when Pebbles is a teenager, Fred and Barney join the Bedrock police force for a time as part-time police officers. Eventually, Fred becomes a grandfather to the adult Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm&#x27;s twins, Chip and Roxy. Fred&#x27;s family grew again in &quot;A Flintstone Family Christmas&quot;, when he and Wilma adopted an orphaned caveboy named Stony, and despite a rough start, Fred and his new son bonded well.

==Relatives==
The Flintstone family&#x27;s paternal side originally came from the prehistoric state of Arkanstone in Camp Mastodon, where they had been engaged in a feud similar to the Hatfield–McCoy feud. The feud was originally started by an ancestor of Fred&#x27;s making a joke about a Hatrock family portrait (&quot;I don&#x27;t know what the artist got for doing that painting, but he should&#x27;ve gotten life!&quot;). In the fourth-season episode &quot;Bedrock Hillbillies&quot;, the feud is ended when Fred helps rescue Pebbles and a Hatrock baby, only to start up again when Fred makes the same joke as his ancestor. The Hatrocks later appear in the follow-up fifth-season episode &quot;The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes&quot;, where they visit Bedrock. The last of the Camp Mastodon Arkanstone Flintstones was Fred&#x27;s great-great-granduncle Zeke Flintstone who lived to 102.

Other relatives of Fred include: Rocco Rockbottom &quot;Rocky/Stony&quot; Flintstone, Fred&#x27;s grandfather, who was a Camp Mastodon veteran of Air Force Stone World War One; Uncle Giggles Flintstone, a rich, eccentric practical joker whose jokes drive Fred into a mad rage; James Hardrock, Edna&#x27;s father; Uncle Tex Hardrock, Fred&#x27;s rich Texan uncle; Tumbleweed and Mary Lou Jim, Fred&#x27;s rich Texan cousins.
==Personality==
Fred&#x27;s personality was based on those of early television&#x27;s Ralph Kramden of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; and Chester A. Riley of &quot;The Life of Riley&quot;, both roles held at various times by Jackie Gleason. (Riley was more closely associated with William Bendix, who originated the role, though Gleason replaced Bendix due to a contract dispute for &quot;The Life of Riley&#x27;s&quot; first season on television.) Much like Ralph, Fred tends to be loud-mouthed, aggressive, temperamental and constantly scheming ways to improve his family&#x27;s working class lot in life, often with unintended results. Also like Ralph, despite his harshness, he is friendly, and has a loving heart, who is very devoted to his family and cares a lot about his best friend and next door neighbor Barney Rubble. Fred loses his temper easily and is very impatient, but he seems free of malice and never holds a grudge. Although his loudness irritates the people around him, Fred proves friendly, often going out of his way to help others. Also, although Fred often annoys Wilma with his immaturity, he is known to go to great lengths to please his family and apologize when he goes too far. Other known characters from other programs may also be known to have personalities based on Fred Flintstone including Archie Bunker from &quot;All in the Family&quot; and &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; (both played by Carroll O&#x27;Connor), George Jefferson from &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; (played by Sherman Hemsley), Mel Sharples from &quot;Alice&quot; (played by Vic Tayback) and Frank DeFazio from &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; (played by Phil Foster).

Fred&#x27;s interests include bowling, playing pool, golf, poker and lounging around the house. Fred has won championships with his bowling skills; in one episode, he goes so far as to take ballet lessons in order to improve his game (hence his trademark bowling delivery). The nickname of &quot;Twinkletoes&quot; stuck with him when Fred attended a local university and became eligible to play on their football team, and it became his call sign. Fred is also an excellent golfer. Fred is a member of the Loyal Order of Water Buffalos Lodge (named &quot;the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs&quot; in an early episode). Fred also has a serious gambling problem; the mere mention of the word &quot;bet&quot; causes Fred to stammer &quot;bet&quot; over and over again (sounding like a clucking chicken) and go on gambling binges. Fred is also an avid driver. In the fifth-season episode &quot;Indianrockolis 500&quot;, Fred entered the famed prehistoric auto race under the pseudonym &quot;Goggles Paisano&quot;.

Fred&#x27;s catchphrase is &quot;Yabba-Dabba-Doo!&quot;; Alan Reed, voice actor who provided Fred&#x27;s voice from 1960 to 1977, reportedly said the inspiration for the phrase came from his mother, who used to say, &quot;A little dab&#x27;ll do ya,&quot; probably borrowed from a Brylcreem commercial. When the script called for a simple &quot;yahoo&quot;, Alan either asked if he could alter the phrase or he ad-libbed. It inspired, in the 1970s a short-lived fruit drink called &quot;Yabba Dabba Dew&quot; and may or may not have also inspired George Jetson&#x27;s similar-sounding catchphrase, &quot;Hooba-dooba-dooba&quot; (or &quot;Hooba-Dooba&quot;). It does, however, become the subject of a song by Hoagy Carmichael which the singer-songwriter performs in one episode of &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. Fred&#x27;s ability to carry a tune was quite good in his younger years. One early episode sees Fred (with Barney, who is a skilled drummer) perform at a nightclub with his musician friend &quot;Hot Lips Hannigan&quot; where his singing caused teenage girls to swoon over him; on this occasion, he was nicknamed the &quot;Golden Smog&quot;. In another first-season episode, &quot;Girls&#x27; Night Out&quot;, Fred recorded a demo record at a carnival of the song &quot;Listen to the Rocking Bird&quot;, which ended up making him a teenage singing idol named &quot;Hi Fye&quot;. As the series progressed, however, his voice became worse and worse (even during his success as a singer, Wilma was never impressed by Fred&#x27;s voice), eventually to the point that a temporary maid the Flintstones hired quit rather than having to hear Fred sing. (Alan Reed himself was not a good singer; in instances where he was expected to sing well, a stand-in—usually Henry Corden from 1965 onward—would be used.)

Due to his impulsive and short-tempered behavior and stubborn and somewhat selfish nature, Fred seems to be accident-prone. Even his most innocent and mundane actions often cause widespread confusion. At the end of the closing credits, Fred puts the Flintstones housecat &quot;Baby Puss&quot; outside; the cat however jumps back inside and puts Fred out who begins to knock on the door of his house and starts yelling &quot;Wilma&quot;, to open the door.

According to the original series&#x27; third-season episode &quot;The Birthday Party&quot; (originally aired April 5, 1963), Fred&#x27;s birthday is February 2. Fred&#x27;s address has varied through the series&#x27; run, with addresses given for the Flintstone residence including, 201 Cobblestone Lane (October 21, 1960 - &quot;No Help Wanted&quot; episode), 345 Cave Stone Road, 39 Stone Canyon Way, and 1313 Cobblestone Way. Fred&#x27;s address was cited as &quot;35 Cobblestone Rd&quot; in the 1961 episode &quot;The X-Ray Story&quot;.

==Portrayal==
George O&#x27;Hanlon originally auditioned for the role of Fred Flintstone. He later went on to voice George Jetson, another Hanna-Barbera character in the animated sitcom &quot;The Jetsons&quot;. Alan Reed was the original voice artist of Fred (minus the original short pilot where he was voiced by Daws Butler, who also voiced him on a 1973 record) until Reed&#x27;s death in 1977.

Henry Corden occasionally voiced Fred on records throughout the 1960s, and also provided the singing voice for Fred in &quot;The Man Called Flintstone&quot;. Following Reed&#x27;s death, Corden officially took over the role until his retirement in 2000, although he continued to voice him in Post Pebbles commercials until his death in 2005. Corden voiced Fred&#x27;s father and mother in &quot;The Flintstone Kids&quot;, while young Fred was voiced by both Lennie Weinrib and Scott Menville at different points.

Australian voice actor Keith Scott provided Fred&#x27;s voice in various commercials throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s and the live show &quot;Hanna-Barbera Gala Celebrity Nite&quot; at the Wonderland Sydney amusement park in Australia.

Jeff Bergman voiced Fred in the fourth episode of &quot;The New Show&quot; and &quot;Flintstones/Jetsons: Timewarp&quot; and performed the character throughout the 1990s and 2000s for various Cartoon Network and Boomerang commercials and bumpers, and voiced him in &quot;The Flintstones: On the Rocks&quot;, his guest appearance in &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, some episodes of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, and &quot;The Flintstones &amp; WWE: Stone Age SmackDown!&quot;. James Arnold Taylor voiced Fred in commercials following Corden&#x27;s death, up until 2011, as well as his guest appearance in &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot;. Taylor returned to voice Fred in 2016 for a Columbus Zoo commercial. He has also been voiced in recent years by Scott Innes (in a Toshiba commercial).

Other voices include Maurice LaMarche (in &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;), Stephen Stanton (in &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;), Dave Coulier (in &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;), Fred Tatasciore (in &quot;MAD&quot;), Seth Green (in &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;), and Rick Zieff (in &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve 2021&quot;). In various Italian dubs, Fred&#x27;s voice was provided by Italian voice actor Carlo Bonomi. Stephen Root was planned to voice Fred Flintstone in the scrapped FOX series &quot;Bedrock&quot;.

===Live action portrayal===
In the first live-action film, &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, Fred was played by John Goodman, who also provided his voice for the film&#x27;s pinball adaptation. In the prequel film, &quot;The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas&quot;, in which Fred is portrayed as younger than he was in the original, he was played by British actor Mark Addy.

==In other media==
===Commercials===
Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble were pitchmen for Winston cigarettes, the show&#x27;s sponsor at the time. In one ad, Fred and Barney saw the men working hard at the quarry and decided to retire out of sight for a smoke break. After extolling the virtues of their favorite brand, Fred lit up and delivered the catch phrase: &quot;Winston tastes good like a cigarette should.&quot; A similar ad featured Wilma and Betty as well. By the original series&#x27; third season, Winston had been dropped in favor of Welch&#x27;s.

== Reception ==
Fred Flintstone was ranked 3rd on the 10 Best Hanna-Barbara Characters Ranked List

<text>Lyman Hall (April 12, 1724 – October 19, 1790) was an American Founding Father, physician, clergyman, and statesman who signed the United States Declaration of Independence as a representative of Georgia. Hall County is named after him. He was one of four physicians to sign the Declaration, along with Benjamin Rush, Josiah Bartlett, and Matthew Thornton.

== Early life and family ==

Hall was born on April 12, 1724, in Wallingford, Connecticut. He was the son of John Hall, a minister, and Mary (née Street) Hall, daughter of Rev. Samuel Street. He studied with his uncle Samuel Hall and graduated from Yale College in 1747, a tradition in his family. He was a nephew of Anne Law, daughter of Gov. Jonathan Law, cousin of Dr. William Brenton Hall, and a grandnephew of Capt. Theophilus Yale of the Yale family. In 1749, he was called to the pulpit of Stratfield Parish (now Bridgeport, Connecticut). His pastorate was a stormy one: an outspoken group of parishioners opposed his ordination; in 1751, he was dismissed after charges against his moral character which, according to one biography, &quot;Were supported by proof and also by his own confession.&quot; He continued to preach for two more years, filling vacant pulpits, while he studied medicine and taught school.

In 1752, he married Abigail Burr of Fairfield, Connecticut; she died the following year. In 1757, he married Mary Osborne. He migrated to South Carolina and established himself as a physician at Dorchester, South Carolina, near Charleston, a community settled by Congregationalist migrants from Dorchester, Massachusetts, decades earlier. When these settlers moved to the Midway Districtnow Liberty Countyin Georgia, Hall accompanied them. Hall soon became one of the leading citizens of the newly founded town of Sunbury.

== Revolutionary War ==
On the eve of the American Revolution, St. John&#x27;s Parish, in which Sunbury was located, was a hotbed of radical sentiment in a predominantly Loyalist colony. Though Georgia was not initially represented in the First Continental Congress, through Hall&#x27;s influence the parish was persuaded to send a delegate to Philadelphia to the Second Continental Congress. Hall was delegated and was admitted to a seat in the Congress in 1775. He was one of the three Georgians and one of four doctors to sign the document of Independence.

In January 1779, Sunbury was burned by the British. Hall&#x27;s family fled to the North, where they remained until the British evacuation in 1782. Hall then returned to Georgia, settling in Savannah. In January 1783, he was elected governor of the statea position that he held for one year. While governor, Hall advocated the chartering of a state university, believing that education, particularly religious education, would result in a more virtuous citizenry. His efforts led to the chartering of the University of Georgia in 1785. At the expiration of his term as governor, he resumed his medical practice.

== Death and legacy ==
In 1790, Hall moved to a plantation in Burke County, Georgia, on the South Carolina border, where he died on October 19 at the age of 66. Hall&#x27;s widow died in November 1793.

Lyman Hall is memorialized in Georgia where Hall County, Georgia, bears his name; and in Connecticut, his native state, where the town of Wallingford honored him by naming a high school after its distinguished native son. Elementary schools in Liberty County, Georgia, and in Hall County, Georgia, are also named for him. Signers Monument, a granite obelisk in front of the courthouse in Augusta, Georgia, memorializes Hall along with Button Gwinnett and George Walton as Georgians who signed the Declaration of Independence. His remains were re-interred there in 1848 after being exhumed from his original grave on his plantation in Burke County.

<doc id="261158" wikidata="Q1367952" url="?curid=261158" title="John Hart (New Jersey politician)">
<text>John Hart (c. 1713 – May 11, 1779) was an American Founding Father and politician in colonial New Jersey. As a delegate to the Continental Congress, Hart signed the Declaration of Independence. He died several years before the end of the Revolutionary War while still active in patriotic efforts.

==Ancestry==
Sources disagree as to the year and place of Hart&#x27;s birth. His official U.S. Congress biography cites 1713 as a likely birth year and Stonington, Connecticut as his birthplace, though his family relocated to Hopewell Township, New Jersey at some point thereafter. Hart was baptized at the Maidenhead Meetinghouse (now the Presbyterian Church of Lawrenceville) on December 31, 1713. He was the son of Captain Edward Hart, a farmer, public assessor, justice of the peace, and leader of a local militia unit during the French and Indian War. Hart was the grandson of John Hart, a carpenter who came to Hopewell from Newtown, Long Island.

==Early life==
In 1741, Hart married Deborah Scudder (1721–1776). The couple had thirteen children: Sarah, Jesse, Martha, Nathaniel, John, Susanna, Mary, Abigail, Edward, Scudder, an infant daughter, Daniel, and Deborah. His wife, died on October 28, 1776. In 1747, he donated a piece of land in his front meadow to local Baptists who had been seeking a place to build a church. The location was known for some time thereafter as the Hopewell Old School Baptist Meeting House.

==Political career==

Hart was elected to the Hunterdon County Board of Chosen Freeholders in 1750. He was first elected to the New Jersey Colonial Assembly in 1761 and served there until 1771. He was appointed to the local Committee of safety and the Committee of correspondence, and became a judge on the Court of Common Pleas. He was often called &quot;Honest John.&quot;

When New Jersey formed a revolutionary assembly (or provincial congress) in 1776, he was elected to it and served as its vice president. Prior to June 1776, the New Jersey delegation in the First Continental Congress was opposed to independence. As a result, the entire delegation was replaced, and Hart was one of those selected for the Second Continental Congress. He joined in time to vote for and sign the Declaration of Independence. He served until August of that year, then was elected speaker of the newly formed New Jersey General Assembly. He later took on additional duties as Treasurer of the Council of safety (which was given &quot;extraordinary and summary powers&quot; to carry out affairs of the state during emergencies), president of the joint meetings of the New Jersey Congress, and commissioner of the State Loan Office.

==Revolutionary War==
In December 1776, the British advance into New Jersey reached Hunterdon County. A marked man because of his status as speaker of the Assembly, Hart was obliged to escape and hide for a short time in the nearby Sourland Mountains. His farm was raided by British and Hessian troops, who damaged but did not destroy the property. The Continentals&#x27; capture of Trenton on December 26 allowed Hart to return home. Prior to the Battle of Monmouth, Hart invited General George Washington and the Continental Army to make camp on his farm, and his offer was accepted. From June 22 to 24, 1778, 12,000 men occupied his fields, and on at least one occasion Washington dined with Hart.

==Death and legacy==

On November 7, 1778, Hart returned to Hopewell from the Assembly in Trenton. Two days later, he indicated that he was too ill with &quot;gravel&quot; (kidney stones) to return. He continued to suffer from the painful affliction for more than six months until his death on May 11, 1779, at age 65. He is buried at the Old School Baptist Meeting House, to which he had donated land.

The following obituary for John Hart appeared on May 19, 1779:

Hart&#x27;s home stands in present-day Hopewell, New Jersey.

Hart is the ancestor of Congressman John Hart Brewer and former House majority leader Steny Hoyer. Roadways named after Hart include Hart Boulevard in Flemington, New Jersey; Hart Avenue in Hopewell, New Jersey; and Hart Lane in Ringoes, New Jersey.

<doc id="261160" wikidata="Q1666382" url="?curid=261160" title="Joseph Hewes">
<text>Joseph Hewes (July 9, 1730– November 10, 1779) was an American Founding Father and a signer of the Continental Association and U.S. Declaration of Independence. Hewes was a native of Princeton, New Jersey, where he was born in 1730. His parents were members of the Society of Friends, commonly known as Quakers. Early biographies of Hewes falsely claim that his parents came from Connecticut. Hewes may have attended the College of New Jersey, known today as Princeton University but there is no record of his attendance. He did, in all probability, attend the grammar school set up by the Stonybrook Quaker Meeting near Princeton.

==Mercantile business==
About 1749 or 1750 he moved to Philadelphia and joined Joseph Ogden&#x27;s mercantile business at Chestnut and 2nd Street as an apprentice. Ogden was married to Hewes&#x27;s first cousin Jimima Hewes. Part of his apprenticeship had him traveling by cargo ship either with Ogden or one of his assistants known as a supercargo as they visited Boston, New York, Edenton (North Carolina), Charleston and Tortola in the British Virgin Islands to buy and sell goods to other traders in those port cities. During this time in Philadelphia, Hewes attended Quaker meetings at the Arch Street meeting house.

Completing his apprenticeship he determined that opportunities in the port in North Carolina at Edenton, a prospering well protected port town on a small bay on the north side of Albemarle Sound he had visited while still apprenticed to Ogden, offered the best chance for his success. Hewes moved there in late 1754 and with Charles Blount formed &quot;Blount, Hewes and Co.&quot; and he soon became Edenton&#x27;s leading merchant. In a 1772 letter to a friend, James Iredell said of Hewes &quot;there is a Gentleman in this Town, who is a very particular favourite of mine, as indeed he is of everybody, for he is one of the best and most agreeable Men in the World. His name is Mr. Hewes. He is a Merchant here and our Member for the Town; indeed the Patron and greatest honour of it. About 6 or 7 years ago he was within a very few days of being married to one of Mr. [Johnston&#x27;s] sisters who died rather suddenly; and this unhappy Circumstance for a long time embittered every Satisfaction in Life to him. He has continued ever since unmarried...&quot;In 1763, &quot;Blount, Hewes and Co.&quot;, was dissolved. Hewes joined with a local attorney, Robert Smith, to form &quot;Hewes and Smith.&quot; In addition to the store at the NE corner of Main and King the firm possessed &quot;offices, three warehouses, a wharf and five ships, three sloops and two brigs.&quot; Hewes was also the personal owner of a ship repair and ship building yard at the mouth of Pembroke Creek. In 1777 Hewes created a rope walk—a factory for braiding ropes, twine, hawsers and cables to be used in the rigging of ships. It became one of the main suppliers of high quality ropes and lines to the American shipping industry during the next decade.

In 1757 Hewes was appointed justice of the peace for Edenton. In 1760 he was elected to the North Carolina Assembly, where he served on important committees involving finance and treasury. He remained in the Assembly until 1775.

The Quaker historian Charles Francis Jenkins argued that Hewes remained a Quaker his entire life: &quot;As to Joseph Hewes, who had thrown off most of the outward observances of a member of Meeting in good standing, the time has come to say whether he was or was not a Friend. The answer is that he was a birthright member of Chesterfield, N.J. Monthly Meeting, that he never resigned or was disowned, that he never formally connected himself with any other religious organization and that when he died his death was recorded in his old home meeting showing that they, at least, regarded him as one among them.&quot;

The claim that he never formally connected himself with another religious organization is contradicted by the records of St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church in Edenton where he served as a vestryman. There is some evidence that Hewes was a deist—someone who believes in the existence of a supreme being, specifically of a creator who does not intervene in the universe. The term is used chiefly of an intellectual movement of the 17th and 18th centuries that accepted the existence of a creator on the basis of reason but rejected belief in a supernatural deity who interacts with humankind.

Iredell wrote in his diary: I took a Walk with Mr. Hewes to his Wharf, &amp; spent a happy Afternoon with him afterwards at his own House - This Gentleman I greatly love &amp; respect; &amp; I feel much Concern that he has imbibed some Prejudices which cannot stand the Test of a fair Inquiry, &amp; which , if justly founded, would destroy the strongest ties of Moral &amp; Social Virtue, - would render doubtful every rule of Evidence that has been hitherto held certain, -&amp; would leave unconquerable Difficulties in the room of those which only seem such for want of due attention or a competent Knowledge of the Subject.-As a Man &amp; Gentleman,-possessed of an excellent Understanding, -Blest with a good heart, - Mr. Hewes is deserving all the honor &amp; respect universally shewn him. How happy am I in being intimately connected with that Family which is admired by all the World for their improved Minds, exemplary Conduct, &amp; agreeable Deportment!

==First Continental Congress (September 5, 1774 – October 22, 1774)==
The British Parliament responded to the December, 1773, Boston Tea Party by passing in 1774 the Coercive Acts (known as the Intolerable Acts In the American colonies) closing the Boston harbor and restricting town meetings in Massachusetts to one per year. While the act applied only to Massachusetts, the other colonies feared their rights would soon be in jeopardy as well. Through the Committees of Correspondence a proposal was circulated for an inter-colonial congress to meet in Philadelphia in September 1774. In response to that call the North Carolina Committee of Correspondence consisting of John Harvey (the Speaker of the Assembly) Wiliam Hooper, Richard Caswell, Joseph Hewes and four others called for the Assembly to meet to select delegates to send to the Philadelphia congress. Members of the North Carolina Assembly met as an extra-legal body at New Bern on Aug 25, 1774.

The first order of business, of this First North Carolina Provincial Congress, was Joseph Hewes reading some of the letters from the Committees of Correspondence from other colonies. After this reading, it was decided to send three delegates to the Philadelphia congress. The second order of business was to pass a resolution affirming loyalty to the British crown and the British Constitution and declaring that they sought only their rights as Englishmen. The hope was that reconciliation and compromise with England would resolve all disputes. On 27 October William Hopper, Joseph Hewes and Richard Caswell were named to attend the Philadelphia Congress. The three delegates shared the belief that reconciliation was unlikely, but they also believed that only when the evidence was abundantly clear that reconciliation was unobtainable should independence become an option. The Provincial Congress gave the delegates two instructions: (1) to contend for their rights as Englishmen, and (2) to agree with the colonies to prohibit all imports and exports to Great Britain. They had no authorization to advocate or even debate a call for independence.

The Congress reconvened in Philadelphia on September 5, 1774. Hewes and Hooper arrived on the 12th and presented their credentials on 14 September. Caswell arrived three days later.

On September 18 Congress passed the Suffolk Resolves calling for the termination of trade with Great Britain. On October 15 the Congress adopted a Declaration of Rights and Grievances and on 18 October the Continental Association establishing the end of all imports from England effective on December 1, 1774, and an end to all exports to England, Ireland, and the West Indies effective September 1, 1775. The North Carolina delegation voted in favor of both measures. Congress adjourned October 22, calling for a new congress to meet on May 10, 1775, if Britain did not adequately respond to redress American grievances and restore their rights. Hooper and Caswell returned to North Carolina. Hewes stayed on until 24 November 1775.

Hewes had family in the area. His mother lived about 40 miles (64.37 km) away in New Jersey. She may have come to Philadelphia to stay with her daughter Sarah, who was married to the Philadelphia merchant Joseph Ogden. Or, she may have stayed with Hewes&#x27;s younger brother Josiah, also a merchant, a member of the Philadelphia committee of correspondence, a manager of the Pennsylvania Hospital and a director of the Library Company. Hewes also had relatives just a couple of miles south of Philadelphia in Chester County.

==Second Continental Congress first session (May 10, 1775 – August 1, 1775)==

The 2nd North Carolina Provincial Congress convened in New Bern on April 3, 1775. Hewes, Hooper and Caswell were reappointed to serve as delegates from North Carolina to the 2nd Continental Congress. Their instructions remained as they were. The delegates were not authorized to seek independence but were to seek redress of grievances. On April 29 Hewes and Caswell left together for Philadelphia. As they crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, they met the Virginia delegation led by George Washington. From then on to Philadelphia they were met at each county line by various companies of troops who marched with them to the next county line. It looked to Hewes that in comparison North Carolina lacked patriotic fervor and was far behind in military readiness. On May 11 he wrote to Samuel Johnston urging him to promote the training of the militia.

Congress convened on the 10th. Hewes was appointed to three committees: the finance committee, the committee writing the rules and regulations for the army and a committee to inquire into the ore and lead resources of the colonies. For the first three months of the Congress, the focus of attention was on the prospects for reconciliation and organizing a defensive military force These were the two messages that Hewes emphasized in his letters. One June 19, Hooper, Hewes, and Caswell sent an address to the all the county committees of safety in North Carolina urging them quickly get ready to &quot;stem Tyranny in its commencement.&quot;

On August 1, 1775, The Continental Congress adjourned, scheduling to reassemble on September 5.

At the 3rd North Carolina Provincial Congress (Aug 20, 1775 - Sept 10, 1775)
Hooper, Hewes, and Caswell were again selected to represent North Carolina as members of the Continental Congress. The Provincial Congress considered and rejected a Draft of Articles of Confederation proposed by several of the colonies . The North Carolina delegation was instructed &quot;not to consent to any plan of Confederation&quot; in that any such &quot;Confederacy ought only be adopted in Case of the last necessity&quot;. The creation of a confederation was considered one step too far, turning resistance into a move toward independence.

On September 8 Caswell resigned as a delegate to the Continental Congress. John Penn was named in his place.

==Second Continental Congress, second session (August 13, 1775)==

Congress reconvened August 13, 1775. In November, it was learned that at the end of August, the king had officially declared the colonists rebels. Late in 1775 Hewes was appointed to the Naval Board and to the Marine Committee. These committees drafted the regulations that would govern the navy and began the process of acquiring ships and the officers and men who would operate them. These acts laid the foundations for the American Navy. Hewes kept the accounts of the Naval Board, conducted the bulk of its correspondence and was responsible for getting John Paul Jones his commission in the Navy.

During the winter of 1775, Congress turned slowly towards independence. In February a resolution was proposed rejecting independence. Congress rejected the resolution. By March Hewes was beginning to think that independence was inevitable. Writing to Samuel Johnston on March 20 he said &quot;I see no prospect of a reconciliation. Nothing is left but to fight it out.&quot;

As a practical matter, independence was declared on March 23, 1776, when Congress opened American ports to all countries except those under British control and in its declaration that British commercial shipping would be subject to attacks by American privateers and the American Navy. On April 12 North Carolina authorized its delegation to &quot;concur...in declaring Independency...&quot; Richard Henry Lee of Virginia offered a resolution on June 7 for independence &quot;that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States.&quot; The Lee Resolution was deferred for three weeks until July 1. On June 20 Hewes wrote to James Iredell &quot;...On Monday the great question of independency and total separation from all political intercourse with Great Britain will come on. It will be carried, I expect, by a great majority, and then, I suppose we shall take upon us a new name...&quot;

The Continental Congress voted to politically separate from Britain on July 2, 1776. On July 4 the wording of the Declaration of Independence was ratified. An engrossed copy to be penned by a skilled calligrapher was ordered on July 19 and most of the signatures were appended to this copy on August 2 including that of Joseph Hewes.

Between July 8 and August 2 Hewes visited his mother near Princeton, New Jersey. In a letter from Philadelphia of July 8, 1776, Hewes wrote &quot;I had the weight of North Carolina on my shoulders within a day or two of three months. The service was too severe. I have sat some days from Six in the morning till five, and sometimes Six in the afternoon without eating or drinking. My health is bad, such close attention made it worse. ...Duty, inclination and self preservation call on me now to make a little excursion in the County to see my mother. This is a duty which I have not allowed myself to perform during almost nine months that I have been here.&quot; Towards the end of September Hewes returned to Edenton for rest and recuperation.
==John Adams and his comments on Joseph Hewes==

In 1813 John Adams wrote of the struggles that Hewes experienced as he set about serving in the Continental Congress: &quot;For many days the majority depended on Mr. Hewes of North Carolina. While a member one day was speaking and reading documents from all the colonies to prove that public opinion, the general sense of all, was in favor of the measure, when he came to North Carolina and produced letters and public proceedings that the majority in that colony was in favor of it, Mr. Hewes, who had hitherto constantly voted against it, started suddenly upright and lifting both hands to heaven as if he had been in a trance, cried out, &quot;It is done and I will abide by it.&quot; I would give more for the perfect painting of the terror and horror upon the face of the old majority at that critical moment than for the best piece of Raphael. The question, however, was eluded by an immediate motion for adjournment&quot;.

Because these comments were written about 37 years after the event, there is reason to doubt the accuracy of Adams&#x27; memory. First, he is simply wrong about the vote for independence depending on Hewes&#x27; vote. Secondly, there is no evidence that Hewes changed his mind suddenly on the matter of independence.

John Adams divided the Congress into two distinct factions: the militants who strongly supported independence from the beginning of the First Congress and those who did not support independence. The Adams view oversimplifies the situation. There were actually three camps: (1) a small group of militants who early on supported independence, (2) a small group of anti-independents who never gave up hope for reconciliation and (3) the majority who gradually realized that reconciliation was impossible and so gradually came to see that a defense of their rights necessitated military operations which placed them in a state of rebellion. Hewes belonged firmly in this group, in the majority. Hewes experienced no sudden change of mind.

Hewes did not take independence lightly. There would be a human cost in pain and suffering. Yet, independence gradually came to be accepted as an inevitable consequence of their defense of American rights. Defense of these rights was of primary interest to Hewes. In April 1775, more than a year before independence was declared, Hewes was promoting more training for the North Carolina militia. His work in the organization of the navy began well before the vote on independence indicating again his willingness to support a militant defense of American rights.

==Naval affairs==
At the end of October 1775, the Continental Congress created a seven member committee to begin fitting out two vessels one with no more than 20 guns and the other with no more than 26 guns. Hewes was appointed to this committee and to two others that became the Naval Committee which later evolved into the Marine Committee. Hewes was selected for these committees not only because of his marine experience but also for his business and accounting acumen. The following month two more vessels were ordered and the Naval Committee began adopting regulations for the conduct of Naval officers and seamen. The Naval Committee met from six in the evening sometimes to around midnight in a house they acquired for its meetings. Stephen Hopkins chaired the committee and Joseph Hewes kept its accounts as well as handling a good portion of it correspondence.

On February 14, 1776, Hewes leased one of the firm&#x27;s brigantines to the Secret Marine Committee of the Continental Congress for the sum of 400 Spanish dollars per month. Hewes agreed that the &quot;said Brigt shall be Tight, stiff, Strong &amp; Staunch, well &amp; sufficiently fitted, found, Victualed &amp; Manned for this Voyage...&quot; At the time the ship was located on the York River in Virginia where It was to load tobacco and other Virginia Produce and then sail to ports in Europe to sell the Cargo and &quot;shall receive on board any...Goods, Wares, Merchandize arms, &amp; ammunition that the Agent or Factors of the said Secret Committee [may order and then] proceed with all Care &amp; dilligence [sic]..into some Safe Port or place between Connecticut and North Carolina...&quot; The committee agreed to pay all port charges. For insurance purposes, the value of the brigantine was placed at 4 thousand 600 Spanish milled dollars. The committee insured the owners for this amount &quot;against any Capture or seizure...by any Enemies of the said united Colonies.&quot;

== 5th North Carolina Provincial Congress ==
In November 1776 Hewes was again chosen along with Hopper and Thomas Bourke to represent North Carolina in the 2nd Continental Congress. This Provincial Congress wrote a new constitution for the province and called for the new Bicameral legislature to meet in April 1777 in New Bern. After the Provincial Congress, Hewes did not return to Philadelphia but returned to Edenton staying there through April 1777 until the General Assembly gathered on April 7.

==First North Carolina General Assembly==

On April 7, 1777, the first First North Carolina General Assembly met in New Bern. On April 18, Joseph Hewes, John Penn, William Hooper and Thomas Burke were nominated to serve as delegates from North Carolina to the Continental Congress. John Penn was eager to obtain one of the three delegate positions for himself. He claimed that if Joseph Hewes were elected as a delegate to the Continental Congress it would be in violation of the new North Carolina Constitution. The Constitution prohibited a person from holding two offices. Hewes served on the Marine Committee so according to Penn&#x27;s argument, Hewes was not eligible to serve in the Continental Congress. Penn also suggested that Hewes had amassed a fortune from his work on the Marine Committee and that he was frequently absent from meetings of the Congress. On May 4, John Penn, Thomas Burke and Cornelius Harnett were elected as delegates to the Continental Congress.

== Reelected to the Continental Congress ==
In January 1779 Joseph Hewes was elected to represent Edenton in the lower house of the North Carolina Assembly. In 1779 the legislature increased the size of their delegation to the Continental Congress to five members and after a two year absence from Congress, on February 4, 1779, Hewes was reelected by the Assembly to represent North Carolina to the Continental Congress. Still not feeling well, he took his seat in Philadelphia on July 22, 1779. On August 17 he wrote to Richard Caswell that &quot;I have been much distressed with a continual head ach attended with a kind of stupor which renders me unfit for business of any kind and altho I do attend Congress yet I cannot pay that attention to business which the urgency of our affairs seem to require.&quot;

On October 25, 1779, his resignation from Congress was received by the North Carolina Assembly.

== Death ==
Joseph Hewes died on November 10, 1779, eight months short of his fiftieth birthday. The funeral was held the following day.

Dunlap and Claypoole&#x27;s &quot;American Daily Advertiser&quot; printed an account of the funeral in the November 16th issue on page two:On the 10th of November instant, Congress being informed that Mr. JOSEPH HEWES, one of the Delegates for the State of North-Carolina, died that morning and that it was proposed to inter him to morrow evening, Resolved that Congress would in a body attend the funeral to morrow evening at three o&#x27;clock, as mourners, with a crape round the left arm, and would continue in mourning for the space of one month. They further resolved, that Mr. Harnett, Mr. Sharpe and Mr. Griffin, be a Committee to superintend the funeral; and that the Rev. Mr. White, the attending Chaplin should be notified to officiate on the occasion. They also directed the committee to invite the General Assembly, the President and Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania, the Minister Plenipotentiary of France, and other persons of distinction in town, to attend the funeral.

Accordingly at three o&#x27;clock that evening the corpse was carried in procession to Christ Church; Mr. Carleton, Mr. Troup, Mr. Deane, Mr. Brown, Mr. Pennel and Col. Adams supported the pall. Beside the President and members of Congress as mourners, the General Assembly, a number of officers both civil and military, and a large number of inhabitants and strangers of distinction attended the funeral.

A divine service had been performed by the Rev. Mr. White, Rector of the Episcopal Churches in this city and one of the Chaplins of Congress, the corpse was interred in the cemetery adjoining that of Mr. Drayton.

Mr. Hewes, having at an early period demonstrated his zealous attachment to the cause of American Freedom, he was appointed by the voice of his fellow citizens a Delegate to the First Congress, and from that time to his death enjoyed the fullest confidence of his country. Endued with strong decisive genius and a spirit of industry, his mind was constantly employed in the business of his exalted station, until his health, much impaired by intense application, sunk beneath it. His private life was mild and amicable as his public life was honorable and useful. Adorned with all the social virtues, esteemed by his acquaintance, beloved by his friends and resigned to his fate, unregretting, tho&#x27; deeply regretted, his last debt to nature was paid in the service of his country.Hewes was a member of Unanimity Lodge No. 7, visited in 1776, and was buried with Masonic funeral honors in the Christ Church Burial Ground, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

<text>A graphic organizer, also known as a knowledge map, concept map, story map, cognitive organizer, advance organizer, or concept diagram, is a pedagogical tool that uses visual symbols to express knowledge and concepts through relationships between them.
The main purpose of a graphic organizer is to provide a visual aid to facilitate learning and instruction.

== History ==
Graphic organizers have a history extending to the early 1960s. David Paul Ausubel was an American psychologist who coined the phrase &quot;advance organizers&quot; to refer to tools which bridge &quot;the gap between what learners already know and what they have to learn at any given moment in their educational careers.&quot; Ausubel&#x27;s advance organizers originally took the form of prose to merge the familiar—what students know—with the new or unfamiliar—what they have discovered or are learning. The advance organizer intended to help learners more easily retain verbal information but was written in a higher level of language. Later the advance organizers were represented as paradigms, schematic representations, and diagrams as they took on more geometric shapes.

In 1969, Richard F. Barron came up with a tree diagram that was referred to as a &quot;structured overview.&quot; The diagram introduced new vocabulary and used spatial characteristics and language written at the same level as the material being learned. In the classroom, this hierarchical organization was used by the teacher as a pre-reading strategy to show relationships among vocabulary. Its use later expanded for not only pre-reading strategies but for supplementary and post-reading activities. It was not until the 1980s that the term graphic organizer was used.

== Theories ==
Various theories have been put forth to undergird the assimilation of knowledge through the use of graphic organizers. According to Ausubel&#x27;s Subsumption Theory, when a learner connects new information to their own preexisting ideas, they absorb new information. By relating new information to prior knowledge, learners reorganize their cognitive structures rather than build an entirely new one from scratch. Educational psychologist Richard E. Mayer reinterpreted Ausubel&#x27;s subsumption theory within his own theory of assimilation encoding. In applying the use of organizers to the assimilation theory, advance organizers facilitate prior knowledge to working memory as well as its active integration of received information. However, he warned that advance organizers are not beneficial if the tools do not ask the learner to actively incorporate new information or if the preceding teaching methods and materials already are well-defined and well-structured.

Others find a basis for graphic organizers on schema theory developed by Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. In psychology, schema refers to a cognitive framework or concept that helps to organize and interpret information. The brain uses these patterns of thinking and behavior that are held in long-term memory to help people interpret the world around them. Piaget&#x27;s theory is that a scheme is both a category of knowledge and the process of acquiring new knowledge. He believed that as people continually adapt to their environments, they take in new information and acquire additional knowledge. Culbert, et al. (1998) posits that by using graphic organizers, prior knowledge is activated, and learners can add new information to their schema and thus improve comprehension of the material.

== Application ==

=== Pre-writing tool for students with learning disabilities ===
In one study of 21 students on Individualized Education Plans, graphic organizers were used during the pre-writing process to gauge student achievement on the persuasive essay in a 10th grade writing classroom. Explicit instruction on how to fill out the organizer along with color coding sections and sufficient class time to fill these out resulted in an 89 percent of students saying they felt graphic organizers were helpful in a post-assignment survey.

=== Metacognition tool for second-language (L2) learners ===
One yearlong study of 3rd and 5th grade California dual language classrooms found that through the use of graphic organizers, students increased higher-order thinking skills, enhanced vocabulary acquisition, and developed the academic language of science.

==Types of organizers==
Graphic organizers take many forms:

*Relational organizers
** Storyboard
** Fishbone - Ishikawa diagram
*** Cause and effect web
** Chart
*** T-Chart
* Category/classification organizers
** Concept mapping
** KWL tables
** Mind mapping
*Sequence organizers
**Chain
** Ladder - Story map
** Stairs - Topic map
*Compare contrast organizers&quot;
** Dashboard
** Venn diagrams
** Double bubble map
*Concept development organizers
** Story web
**Word web
** Circle chart
** Flow chart
** Cluster diagram
** Lotus diagram
** Star diagram
*Options and control device organizers
** Mechanical control panel
** Graphical user interface

== Enhancing students&#x27; skills==
A review study concluded that using graphic organizers improves student performance in the following areas:

; Retention
: Students remember information better and can better recall it when it is represented and learned both visually and verbally.

; Reading comprehension
: The use of graphic organizers helps improving the reading comprehension of students.

; Student achievement
: Students with and without learning disabilities improve achievement across content areas and grade levels.

; Thinking and learning skills; critical thinking
: When students develop and use a graphic organizer their higher order thinking and critical thinking skills are enhanced.

== Criticism ==
In four studies on the effects of advance organizers on learning tasks, no significant difference was found from the control group who did not use organizers to learn as presented in a paper Richard F. Barron delivered to the Annual Meeting of the National Reading Conference in 1980. In that same study, Richard F. Barron did find that student-constructed postorganizers showed more benefits. Graphic postorganizers focus on learners finding the relationships of vocabulary terms by manipulating them in a diagram or schematic way after they have already learned these terms.

<text>Thomas Heyward Jr. (July 28, 1746 – March 6, 1809) was an American Founding Father, lawyer, jurist, and politician. Heyward was active politically during the Revolutionary Era. As a member of the Continental Congress representing South Carolina, he signed the Declaration of Independence and Articles of Confederation. Heyward&#x27;s imprisonment in Florida by the British for nearly a year and the loss of a considerable number of slaves led to his being proclaimed a martyr of the revolution.

==Life==
Heyward was born in St. Luke&#x27;s Parish (now known as Jasper County), South Carolina, the son of Mary (Miles) and Daniel Heyward. He was educated at home, then traveled to England to study law where he was a member of the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple. He was elected to the Continental Congress in 1775 and the following year was the last delegate to sign the Declaration of Independence.

Heyward returned to South Carolina in 1778 to serve as a judge. In 1778, he presided over a trial in which several persons were tried for treason; they were convicted and executed within view of the British lines. In command of a militia force, he was taken prisoner by the British during the siege of Charleston. On August 27, 1780, British troops took him from his Charleston home (presently owned by the Charleston Museum) at 87 Church Street and detained him in the Old Exchange Building. They confiscated all of his slaves, and although he later reclaimed some of them, 130 were permanently confiscated and transported to sugar plantations in Jamaica, a loss of $50,000 in property. It was this loss of slaves that resulted him being later proclaimed by the press as a martyr of the revolution. Hours after being arrested, he and 28 other &quot;ringleaders of the rebellion&quot; were relocated to a guard ship in the harbor. On September 4, they were transported to St. Augustine, Florida, and remained there for about 11 months until they were freed in a prisoner exchange. While in prison, Heyward transposed a popular English song, &quot;God Save the King&quot; into &quot;God Save the States&quot;.

In 1784, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. He continued to serve as a judge after the war, retiring from the bench in 1798. He is buried at Old House Plantation near Ridgeland, South Carolina. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

In 1970, when the Supreme Court ordered that public schools must be integrated, a group associated with the White Citizen&#x27;s Council opened a school named Thomas Heyward Academy in Ridgeland, South Carolina.

==Marriage and family==

Heyward was married twice, at age 26 and at age 40, and each wife was named Elizabeth. His first wife, born in 1753, was the daughter of Colonel John and Sarah Gibbes Mathews and the sister of South Carolina governor John Mathews. She died in childbirth in 1782 in Philadelphia, where she had gone to be with Heyward upon his release as a prisoner of war. She is buried there in St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church yard. They had six children, but only one son, Daniel, survived childhood.

His second wife was the daughter of Colonel Thomas and Mary Elliott Savage of Charleston. They had three children who lived to adulthood: Thomas, William and Elizabeth. Notable descendants include DuBose Heyward, whose novel and later stage play &quot;Porgy&quot; portrayed Black African-Americans and was transformed by George Gerswhin into &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, an American opera that achieved both credit as a musical masterpiece and criticism for pervasive racism.
In addition to his wives, he impregnated at least one of the women he enslaved, making him the grandfather of Thomas E. Miller, one of only five African Americans elected to Congress from the South in the 1890s. At one time, the Heyward family had the largest slaveholding in the United States.

<text>William Hooper (June 28, 1742 October 14, 1790) was an American Founding Father, lawyer, and politician. As a member of the Continental Congress representing North Carolina, Hooper signed the Continental Association and the Declaration of Independence.

==Early life==

Hooper was the first child of five, born in Boston, Massachusetts, on June 28, 1742. His father, William Hooper, was a Scottish minister who studied at the University of Edinburgh prior to immigrating to Boston. His mother, Mary Dennie, was the daughter of John Dennie, a well-respected merchant from Massachusetts. Hooper&#x27;s father had hoped that William would follow in his footsteps as an Episcopal priest and placed his son at the age of seven in Boston Latin School headed by Mr. John Lovell, a highly distinguished educator. In 1757, at age 16, Hooper entered Harvard University where he was highly regarded as an industrious student. In 1760, Hooper graduated from Harvard with honors, obtaining a Bachelor of Arts. However, after graduating, Hooper did not wish to pursue a career in the clergy as his father had hoped. Instead, he decided on a career in law, studying under James Otis, a popular Boston attorney who was regarded as a radical. Hooper studied under Otis until 1764 and once completing his bar exam decided to leave Massachusetts in part because of the city&#x27;s abundance of attorneys.

==Life in North Carolina==
In 1764, Hooper moved temporarily to Wilmington, North Carolina, where he began to practice law and became the circuit court lawyer for Cape Fear. Hooper began to build a highly respected reputation in North Carolina among the wealthy farmers as well as fellow lawyers. Hooper increased his influence by representing the colonial government in several court cases. In 1767, Hooper married Anne Clark, the daughter of a wealthy early settler to the region and sheriff of New Hanover County. They had three children: William (b. 1768), Elizabeth (b. 1770), and Thomas (b. 1772). Hooper moved quickly up the ranks, first in 1769 when he was appointed as deputy attorney of the Salisbury District, and then in 1770 when he was appointed deputy Attorney General of North Carolina.

Initially, Hooper supported the British colonial government of North Carolina. As deputy attorney general, in 1768 Hooper worked with Colonial Governor William Tryon to suppress a rebellious group known as the Regulators who participated in the War of the Regulation. The Regulators had been operating in North Carolina for some time, and in 1770 it was reported that the group dragged Hooper through the streets in Hillsborough during a riot. Hooper advised that Governor Tryon use as much force as was necessary to stamp out the rebels and even accompanied the troops at the Battle of Alamance in 1771. He served in the Province of North Carolina House of Burgesses in 1775.

==American Revolution involvement==
Hooper&#x27;s support of the colonial governments began to erode, causing problems for him because of his past support of Governor Tryon. Hooper had been labeled a Loyalist and therefore he was not immediately accepted by Patriots. Hooper eventually was elected to the North Carolina General Assembly in 1773, where he became an opponent to colonial attempts to pass laws that would regulate the provincial courts. This in turn helped to sour his reputation among Loyalists. Hooper recognized that independence was likely to occur and mentioned this in a letter to his friend James Iredell, saying that the colonies were &quot;striding fast to independence, and ere long will build an empire upon the ruins of Great Britain.&quot;

During his time in the assembly Hooper slowly became a supporter of the American Revolution and independence. After the governor disbanded the assembly, Hooper helped to organize a new colonial assembly. Hooper was also appointed to the Committee of Correspondence and Inquiry. In 1774, Hooper was appointed a delegate to the First Continental Congress, where he served on numerous committees. Hooper was again elected to the Second Continental Congress, but much of his time was split between the congress and work in North Carolina, where he was assisting in forming a new government. This caused him to miss the vote approving the Declaration of Independence; however, he arrived in time to sign it on August 2, 1776.

In 1777, because of continued financial concerns, Hooper resigned from Congress and returned to North Carolina to resume his law career. Throughout the Revolution the British attempted to capture Hooper, and with his country home in Finian vulnerable to British attacks, Hooper moved his family to Wilmington. In 1781, the British captured Wilmington, to where Cornwallis and his forces fell back after the Battle of Guilford Court House, and Hooper found himself separated from his family. In addition, the British burned his estates in both Finian and Wilmington, so Hooper was forced to rely on friends for food and shelter during this time, as well as nursing him back to health when he contracted malaria. Finally, after nearly a year of separation, Hooper was reunited with his family, and they settled in Hillsborough, North Carolina, where Hooper continued to work for the North Carolina assembly until 1783.

==Post-Revolution years==
After the Revolution Hooper returned to his career in law, but he lost favor with the public because of his political stance. Hooper fell in line with the Federalist Party because of his influential connections, his mistrust of the lower class, and his widely criticized soft dealings with Loyalists, toward whom he was generally forgiving. This kind and fair treatment made some even label him a Loyalist. Hooper was again called to public service in 1786, when he was appointed a federal judge in a border dispute between New York and Massachusetts, though the case was settled out of court. In 1787 and 1788, Hooper campaigned heavily for North Carolina to ratify the new United States Constitution, but by this time Hooper had become quite ill, and he died on October 14, 1790, at the age of 48. He was laid to rest in the Presbyterian Churchyard in Hillsborough, North Carolina. His remains were later reinterred at Guilford Courthouse National Military Park.

His home at Hillsborough, the Nash-Hooper House, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1971. It is located in the Hillsborough Historic District.

<doc id="261168" wikidata="Q709825" url="?curid=261168" title="Francis Lightfoot Lee">
<text>Francis Lightfoot Lee (October 14, 1734 – January 11, 1797) was a Founding Father of the United States and a member of the House of Burgesses in the Colony of Virginia. As an active protester regarding issues such as the Stamp Act of 1765, Lee helped move the colony in the direction of independence from Britain. Lee was a delegate to the Virginia Conventions and the Continental Congress. He was a signer of the Declaration of Independence and Articles of Confederation as a representative of Virginia. In addition to his career in politics, Lee owned a tobacco plantation as well as many slaves. He was a member of the Lee family, a prominent Virginian dynasty.

==Family, education and early life==

Lee was born on October 14, 1734, at Stratford Hall Plantation, in Westmoreland County, Virginia. Lee was the fourth son of Thomas Lee and Hannah Harrison Ludwell. His middle name &quot;Lightfoot&quot; came from Francis Lightfoot, the best man at his father&#x27;s wedding. He was of English descent and was born into one of the First Families of Virginia. He grew up at Stratford Hall, a large tobacco plantation, which his father completed in 1738. He was educated at home, where Lee pursued classical studies under Dr. Craig.

In 1772, Lee married his cousin, Rebecca Plater Tayloe. They were 2nd cousins, once removed. They had no children. Lee lived his entire life in the region of Virginia between the Rappahannock River and the Chesapeake Bay (known as the Northern Neck).

Lee was the grandson of Col. Richard Lee II and a great-grandson of Col. Richard Lee I. Senator Richard Henry Lee and diplomats William Lee and Dr. Arthur Lee were his brothers. Another brother, Thomas Ludwell Lee, was appointed to a committee, along with Thomas Jefferson, to re-write the laws of Virginia. His namesake Francis Lightfoot Lee II was the son of his brother Richard Henry Lee, and men of the same name descend from him.

==Political career==
In 1774, Lee was among those who called for a general congress and the first of the Virginia Conventions, which he attended. He served in the Virginia State Senate from 1778 to 1782 and was a delegate to the First Continental Congress held in Philadelphia, serving until 1779. As a congressional representative of Virginia, he signed both the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1768. In 1793, he ran to represent Virginia&#x27;s 19th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives.

==Death and legacy==
Lee died of pleurisy at his residence (named &quot;Menokin&quot;) in Richmond County, Virginia, on January 11, 1797, following his wife&#x27;s death four days prior. He is buried in the Tayloe family burial ground at Mount Airy Plantation, near Warsaw, Virginia.

The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

<doc id="261169" wikidata="Q1334924" url="?curid=261169" title="Treaty of Brétigny">
<text>The Treaty of Brétigny was a treaty, drafted on 8 May 1360 and ratified on 24 October 1360, between Kings Edward III of England and John II of France. In retrospect, it is seen as having marked the end of the first phase of the Hundred Years&#x27; War (1337–1453) as well as the height of English power on the European continent.

It was signed at Brétigny, a village near Chartres, and was later ratified as the Treaty of Calais on 24 October 1360.

==Background==
King John II of France, taken as a prisoner of war at the Battle of Poitiers (19 September 1356), worked with King Edward III of England to write out the Treaty of London. The treaty was condemned by the French Estates-General, who advised the Dauphin Charles to reject it.

In response, Edward, who wished to yield few of the advantages claimed in the abortive Treaty of London the year before, besieged Rheims. The siege lasted until January and with supplies running low, Edward withdrew to Burgundy. After the English army attempted a futile siege of Paris, Edward marched to Chartres, and discussion of terms began in early April.

==Terms==

The Treaty of Brétigny was ratified on 10 May 1360, by Dauphin Charles and six English knights at the Hôtel de Sens. On 14 June 1360, John II, a prisoner in England, ratified the treaty at a banquet attended by Edward III, Prince of Wales, and the other French prisoners from the Battle of Poitiers. The finalization of the treaty would occur in Calais on 24 October 1360.

By the terms of this treaty, Edward III obtained Guyenne, Gascony, Poitou, Saintonge and Aunis, Agenais, Périgord, Limousin, Quercy, Bigorre, the countship of Gauré, Angoumois, Rouergue, Montreuil-sur-Mer, Ponthieu, Calais, Sangatte, Ham and the countship of Guînes. The king of England was to hold these free and clear, without doing homage for them. Furthermore, the treaty established that title to &#x27;all the islands that the king of England now holds&#x27; would no longer be under the suzerainty of the king of France. The title duke of Aquitaine was abandoned in favour of lord of Aquitaine.

For his part, the king of England renounced all claims to the French throne. The terms of Brétigny were meant to untangle the feudal responsibilities that had caused so much conflict, and, as far as the English were concerned, would concentrate English territories in an expanded version of Aquitaine. England also restored the rights of the bishop of Coutances to Alderney, which had been removed by the king of England in 1228.

John II had to pay three million écus for his ransom, and would be released after he paid one million. The occasion was the first minting of the franc, equivalent to one livre tournois (twenty sous). As a guarantee for the payment of his ransom, John gave as hostages two of his sons, Dukes Louis I of Anjou and John of Berry, several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France.

==Breakdown==
While the hostages were held, John returned to France to try to raise funds to pay the ransom. In 1362, John&#x27;s son, Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity. Thus, with his stand-in hostage gone, John felt honor-bound to return to captivity in England. He died in captivity in 1364 and was succeeded by his son, Charles V. In 1369, on the pretext that Edward III had failed to observe the terms of the treaty, the king of France declared war once again.

By the time of the death of the Black Prince in 1376 and the death of Edward III in 1377, English forces had been pushed back into their territories in the southwest, around Bordeaux.

==Legacy==
The treaty did not lead to lasting peace, but procured nine years&#x27; respite from the Hundred Years&#x27; War. In the following years, French forces were involved in battles against the Anglo-Navarrese (Bertrand du Guesclin&#x27;s victory at Cocherel on 16 May 1364) and the Bretons.

<doc id="261170" wikidata="Q223235" url="?curid=261170" title="Francis Lewis">
<text>Francis Lewis (March 21, 1713 – December 31, 1802) was an American merchant and a Founding Father of the United States. He was a signatory of the United States Declaration of Independence and Articles of Confederation as a representative of New York in the Continental Congress.

==Early life==
Lewis was born in Llandaff, Wales, on March 21, 1713. He was the son of Morgan Lewis and Anne Lewis (née Pettingale) of Newport. Lewis was educated at Westminster School in London.

==Career==
Lewis entered a mercantile house in London until he turned 21 and inherited some properties left by his father. Lewis sold the properties and used the proceeds to acquire merchandise, set sail for New York City, arriving there in 1734 or 1735. He left some of the goods in New York to be sold by Edward Annesley, his business partner, and brought the rest to Philadelphia. After two years in Philadelphia, he returned to New York.

Lewis made several trans-Atlantic trips, visiting several northern European ports, Saint Petersburg, northern Scotland, and Africa. He was taken prisoner while he served as a British mercantile agent in 1756 and sent to France for imprisonment. On his release and his return home, he became active in politics.

Lewis was a member of the Committee of Sixty, a member of the New York Provincial Congress, and a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1775 to 1779. In 1776 he signed the United States Declaration of Independence, and in 1778 he signed the United States Articles of Confederation. In 1779, he served as the chairman of the Continental Board of Admiralty.

He helped his son Francis Lewis Jr. open a dry goods business named Francis Lewis and Son. His son Morgan served in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War and later held many offices in New York State, including governor.

==Personal life==

In 1745, Lewis married to Elizabeth Annesley (died 1779), a sister of his business partner, Thomas Annesley. Together, they were the parents of seven children, three of whom survived to adulthood:

* Ann Lewis (1748–1802), who married Captain George Robertson (1742–1791) of the Royal Navy.
* Francis Lewis Jr. (1749–1814), who served as churchwarden of St George&#x27;s Parish in Flushing, New York, from 1791 to 1794. He married Elizabeth Ludlow (d. 1831), daughter of Gabriel Ludlow, Esq.
* Morgan Lewis (1754–1844), who married Gertrude Livingston, the daughter of Judge Robert Livingston of Clermont. He was a governor and attorney general of New York.

In 1775, Lewis acquired and relocated his family to an estate located in Whitestone, in present-day Queens. The home was later destroyed after the Battle of Long Island by British forces, who also arrested his wife Elizabeth. She was eventually released in a prisoner exchange for the wives of two wealthy Loyalists from Philadelphia, though the hardships Elizabeth endured in captivity ruined her health and led to her death in 1779.

Through his eldest surviving daughter Ann, he was a grandfather to Marianne Robertson (1779–1829), who married John Bird Sumner, the Archbishop of Canterbury and brother of Charles Richard Sumner, bishop of Winchester. Through his son Morgan, he was a grandfather of Margret Lewis (1780–1860), who married New York lawyer and politician Maturin Livingston and became parents to twelve children. Through his son Francis Jr., he was a grandfather of Gabriel Ludlow Lewis.

==Death and legacy==

Lewis died on December 31, 1802, although his memorial in Trinity Church Cemetery gives his year of death as 1803.

In Queens, New York, Francis Lewis High School and P.S. 79 &quot;The Francis Lewis School&quot; are named after Lewis. Francis Lewis Boulevard, which locals sometimes refer to as &quot;Franny Lew&quot; or &quot;Franny Lewie,&quot; stretches almost the entire north/south length of the borough. Francis Lewis Park is located under the Queens approach of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge. A society of the Children of the American Revolution located in Queens, NY, is named for him. A masonic lodge, Francis Lewis #273, is located in Whitestone.

<doc id="261172" wikidata="Q537583" url="?curid=261172" title="Thomas Lynch Jr.">
<text>Thomas Lynch Jr. (August 5, 1749 – December 17, 1779) was a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence as a representative of South Carolina and a Founding Father of the United States. His father Thomas Lynch was a member of the Continental Congress and had signed the 1774 Continental Association. When he had to step down because of illness, Thomas Lynch Jr. was selected to fill his post.

==Early life ==

Lynch Jr. was born at Hopsewee Plantation in Prince George Parish, Winyah, in what is now Georgetown, South Carolina. He was the third child and first son of Thomas Lynch and his wife, Elizabeth (née Allston) Lynch. He had two older sisters, named Sabina and Esther, who were born in 1747 and 1748, respectively.

Their mother was the daughter of William Allston and his wife,Esther LaBrosse de Marboeuf .

Thomas Lynch was introduce to Elizabeth Allston during a ball held at the childhood home of John Drayton Sr., Magnolia Plantation and Gardens in Charleston, South Carolina. Also in attendance were prominent families such as the Middletons, Randolphs, and Rutledge. 

Lynch&#x27;s grandfather was Jonas Lynch from the County Galway ancestral line. The Lynch family were expelled from Ireland following their defeat in the Irish wars of William of Orange. 

Lynch Sr. had emigrated from Kent, England, to South Carolina. He served as a prominent figure in South Carolina politics, which contributed to his descendants&#x27; access to higher education and wealth.
===Education===
Lynch Jr. was schooled at the Indigo Society School in Georgetown, South Carolina. His parents sent him to England for higher studies. He received honors at Eton College and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. 

Lynch Jr. studied law and political philosophy at the Middle Temple in London. His father admired English education and encouraged him to remain in Great Britain to study law and the principles of the British constitution. 

After eight years away from America, Lynch Jr. returned to South Carolina in 1772. Although his father had dreamed of his being in law, Lynch Jr. decided to end his pursuit of that profession. 

===Marriage and family===
Lynch Jr. married Elizabeth Shubrick on May 14, 1772. 

Following their marriage, the couple lived at Peach Tree Plantation, which was located near his homeland plantation. He enjoyed managing the cultivation of crops at the plantation, which was dependent on the labor of numerous enslaved African Americans. Lynch Jr. remained active in political affairs in his community.

His father died from a stroke in December 1776. His widowed mother later married South Carolina Governor William Moultrie, another influential political figure. 

His sister Sabina Hope Lynch married James Hamilton, also of the planter class. One of their sons was James Hamilton Jr., who was elected as governor of South Carolina in 1830.

==Career==

Lynch was elected a member of the Provincial Congress on February 11, 1775. This committee was formed to prepare a plan of government and represent the people of South Carolina. Lynch served alongside Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, John Rutledge, Charles Pinckney, Henry Laurens, Christopher Gadsden, Rawlins Lowndes, Arthur Middleton, Henry Middleton, Thomas Bee, and Thomas Heyward Jr. in the Provincial Congress. This group formed the South Carolina constitution. Many people objected to this document including the Continental Congress. It stood as a temporary constitution as many believed there would be reconciliation with Great Britain.

Lynch became a company commander in the First South Carolina regiment on June 12, 1775. He was commissioned by the Provincial Congress. After being appointed, he gathered men and led a march into Charlestown, South Carolina. Amid the march, he became very sick with a bilious fever which prevented him from continuing. When he recovered, he was unable to fulfill his position. During his recovery, he received news about his father&#x27;s declining health. In hope that he could manage his father&#x27;s illness, Lynch asked his commanding officer, Colonel Christopher Gadsden, if he could travel to Philadelphia. His request was denied at first, but after receiving news of his election to the Continental Congress, he was allowed to travel to his father.

On March 23, 1776, the General Assembly of South Carolina named Lynch Jr. to the Continental Congress as a sixth delegate. Although he was ill, Lynch Jr. traveled to Philadelphia to sign the Declaration of Independence. Thomas Lynch Sr. and Thomas Lynch Jr. were the only father and son to serve successively in the Continental Congress. 

Lynch Jr. was the second youngest delegate in the Continental Congress and filled in his father&#x27;s place due to illness. The youngest signer, South Carolinian Edward Rutledge, was younger by three months.

Less than a month after signing the Declaration of Independence, Lynch Jr. threatened that South Carolina would secede from the United States; his threat expressed the interests of his constituents, the elite planter class. &quot;If it is debated, whether their Slaves are their Property, there is an End of the Confederation.&quot;

After signing the Declaration of Independence, an ill Thomas Lynch Jr. set out for home with his ailing father. On the way to South Carolina, his father suffered a second stroke. He died in Annapolis, Maryland, in December 1776. Thomas Lynch Jr. retired in early 1777.

==Death==
Lynch suffered for two more years of illness in South Carolina, where he resided with his wife at Peachtree Plantation on the South Santee River. Friends suggested that he travel to Europe in search for a different atmosphere. He and his wife sailed for respite on the brigantine &quot;Polly&quot; to St. Eustatius in the West Indies on December 17, 1779. The ship is known to have disappeared shortly after. He and his wife were considered to have been lost at sea. At age 30, Lynch was the youngest signer of the Declaration of Independence to die.

==Family estate==
His will required that the heirs of his female relatives change their last name to Lynch in order to inherit a share of his family estate. At the time of his death, Thomas Lynch Jr. owned three plantations and held more than 250 enslaved African Americans, who were valued as personal property and part of the estate. 

His sister, Sabina, responded by changing her name and that of her descendants in order to inherit the estate. She and her husband owned and managed Peachtree Plantation until their son was of age. 

Their son, John Bowman Lynch, and his wife had three sons. Henry C. Lynch (1828-1843) died before reaching adulthood. Thomas B. Lynch (1821-1864) died in the American Civil War. James (N.M.) Lynch (1822-1887) lived the longest. 

After Sabina Lynch died, the family estate passed to her youngest sister, Aimeé Constance Dé&#x27;Illiard Drayton. Thomas Lynch Jr. had specified that the estate should remain in the family.

==Legacy==
Lynch&#x27;s birthplace was the Hopsewee Plantation. It is on the National Register of Historic Places and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1971.

In his 1856 book, &quot;Lives of the Signers to the Declaration of Independence&quot;, Rev. Charles A Goodrich lauds Lynch &quot;as a man of exalted views and exalted moral worth&quot;. Goodrich continues: &quot;In all the relations of life, whether as a husband, a friend, a patriot, or the master of the slave, he appeared conscious of his obligations, and found his pleasure in discharging them.&quot;

Autographs by Thomas Lynch Jr. are among the rarest by signers of the Declaration of Independence. His time in Congress lasted less than a year, and for much of this time he was in poor health. Only a single letter has survived, along with a few signatures on historical documents. Many of his autographs have scattered, and others were lost in a fire. Today, Lynch&#x27;s autograph sells for as much as $250,000.

==In popular culture==
Lynch Jr. is played by Richard Bond in the 1938 film &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot;.

<doc id="261175" wikidata="Q880222" url="?curid=261175" title="Thomas Nelson Jr.">
<text>Thomas Nelson Jr. (December 26, 1738 – January 4, 1789) was a Founding Father of the United States, general in the Revolutionary War, member of the Continental Congress, and a Virginia planter. In addition to serving many terms in the Virginia General Assembly, he twice represented Virginia in the Congress, where he signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Fellow Virginia legislators elected him to serve as the commonwealth&#x27;s governor in 1781, the same year he fought as a brigadier general in the siege of Yorktown, the final battle of the war.

==Early and family life==
Nelson was the grandson of Thomas &quot;Scotch Tom&quot; Nelson, an immigrant from Cumberland, England, who was an early pioneer at Yorktown. Nelson Jr. was born in 1738 in Yorktown; his parents were Elizabeth Carter Burwell (daughter of Robert &quot;King&quot; Carter and widow of Nathaniel Burwell) and William Nelson, who was a leader of the colony and briefly served as governor. Through his paternal great-great-grandfather, George Reade, Nelson was a third cousin of first U.S. President and fellow Founding Father George Washington, though it is unknown if either of them knew they were related.

Like many Virginians of the planter class, Nelson was sent to England for his education. He attended Newcome&#x27;s School before entering Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1758. He graduated in 1760 and returned to Virginia the following year. Nelson was an ancestor of Thomas Nelson Page and William Nelson Page.

==Planter==
Upon returning to Virginia, Nelson assisted his father in the operation of his several plantations, which depended on the labor of enslaved African Americans. Following his marriage to young widow Lucy Grymes Burwell, he also managed the estates left to her sons from her first marriage. These included Carter&#x27;s Grove left to her son Nathaniel Burwell.

During the American Revolutionary War, Nelson bought 5,400 acres of land and 400 enslaved people in Prince William County from financially strapped Lewis Burwell (who died in 1779).

==Political career==
York County voters elected Nelson to the Virginia House of Burgesses as a young man in 1761; he succeeded Robert Carter Nicholas in this part-time position. He served his first six terms alongside veteran delegate Dudley Digges.

As Virginians became dissatisfied with colonial governance, Digges and Nelson were elected to represent York County during the five Virginia conventions that preceded statehood: the First Virginia Convention (which met in Williamsburg in 1774), the Second Virginia Convention (which met at St. John&#x27;s Church in Richmond in March 1775), the Third Virginia Convention (which met in Richmond in the summer of 1775), the Fourth Virginia Convention (which met in the winter of 1775–1776 in Richmond and Williamsburg, which Nelson was unable to attend), and the Fifth Virginia Convention, which met in Williamsburg in the summer of 1776 (Nelson left this convention in May to attend the Continental Congress).

William Digges (who had represented York County during the last Virginia Revolutionary Convention) also represented York County alongside Corbin Griffin at the first non-colonial session of the Virginia House of Delegates in the fall of 1776. But Nelson won the 1777 and 1778 elections to represent York County in the House of Delegates, where he served alongside Joseph Prentis. Prentis relinquished his seat in 1778 to serve on the Council of State and was replaced by Nelson on September 21, 1778. In 1779, 1780, and 1781, Nelson served alongside William Reynolds and relinquished his legislative seat upon being elected governor of Virginia in June 1781.

Nelson&#x27;s first term in Congress continued until 1776 when a bout of illness forced his resignation for the 1778–1779 term. After his recovery, he was again elected and served another year. During his first stint as a member of Congress, Nelson also returned to Virginia to play a key role in its Constitutional Convention in the spring of 1776. He returned to Congress to sign the Declaration of Independence that summer.

Thomas Nelson was one of the thirteen committee members appointed in the Continental Congress on June 12, 1776, to &quot;prepare and digest the form of confederation&quot; they drafted the Articles of Confederation.

He was a brigadier general of the Lower Virginia Militia and succeeded Thomas Jefferson as governor of Virginia (after William Fleming&#x27;s nine days as acting governor). Nelson was engaged in the final siege of Yorktown.

According to legend, he urged General George Washington (or, in some versions, Marquis de Lafayette) to fire on his own home, the Nelson House, where General Cornwallis had his headquarters, offering five guineas to the first man to hit his house.

Following his term as Virginia&#x27;s governor, Nelson again won election to the Virginia House of Delegates. He represented York County alongside Joseph Prentis in the assemblies of 1782 and 1783 but was replaced by Nathaniel Nelson in the assembly of 1784–1785. He and Prentis won the next election and again served in the sessions of 1786–1787 and 1787–1788. Robert Shield and William Nelson replaced them in the assembly of 1788.

==Death and remembrance==

Nelson died at his son&#x27;s home in Hanover County, Virginia, nine days after his fiftieth birthday. He is buried in the Grace Churchyard at Yorktown. Nelson was a member of Grace Church.

Colonel Innes made this tribute:

The illustrious General Thomas Nelson is no more! He paid the last great debt to nature, on Sunday, the fourth of the present month, at his estate in Hanover. He who undertakes barely to recite the exalted virtues which adorned the life of this great and good man, will unavoidably pronounce a panegyric on human nature. As a man, a citizen, a legislator, and a patriot, he exhibited a conduct untarnished and undebased by sordid or selfish interest, and strongly marked with the genuine characteristics of true religion, sound benevolence, and liberal policy. Entertaining the most ardent love for civil and religious liberty, he was among the first of that glorious band of patriots whose exertions dashed and defeated the machinations of British tyranny, and gave United America freedom and independent empire. At a most important crisis, during the late struggle for American liberty, when this state appeared to be designated as the theatre of action for the contending armies, he was selected by the unanimous suffrage of the legislature to command the virtuous yeomanry of his country; in this honourable employment he remained until the end of the war; as a soldier, he was indefatigably active and coolly intrepid; resolute and undejected in misfortunes, he towered above distress, and struggled with the manifold difficulties to which his situation exposed him, with constancy and courage. In the memorable year 1781, when the whole force of the southern British army was directed to the immediate subjugation of this state, he was called to the helm of government; this was a juncture which indeed &#x27;tried men&#x27;s souls.&#x27; He did not avail himself of this opportunity to retire in the rear of danger; but on the contrary, took the field at the head of his countrymen; and at the hazard of his life, his fame, and individual fortune, by his decision and magnanimity, he saved not only his country, but all America, from disgrace, if not from total ruin. Of this truly patriotic and heroic conduct, the renowned commander in chief, with all the gallant officers of the combined armies employed at the siege of York, will bear ample testimony; this part of his conduct even contemporary jealousy, envy, and malignity were forced to approve, and this, more impartial posterity, if it can believe, will almost adore. If, after contemplating the splendid and heroic parts of his character, we shall inquire for the milder virtues of humanity, and seek for the man, we shall find the refined, beneficent, and social qualities of private life, through all its forms and combinations, so happily modified and united in him, that in the words of the darling poet of nature, it may be said: His life was gentle: and the elements so mixed in him, that nature might stand up And say to all the world—this was a man.

==Legacy and honors==
* Nelson County, Virginia, and Nelson County, Kentucky, were named in his honor. 
* The Virginia State Council for Higher Education named Thomas Nelson Community College in Thomas Nelson Jr&#x27;s honor in 1967. The college was renamed in 2022, removing his name altogether.
* The Thomas Nelson High School was opened in 2012 in Nelson County, Kentucky.
* The circa 1730 Nelson House built by &quot;Scotch Tom&quot; Nelson in Yorktown, Virginia, was occupied by Thomas Nelson Jr. during the Revolutionary War. It was designated as a National Historical Landmark. It is maintained as part of the Colonial National Historical Park by the U.S. National Park Service.

<doc id="261177" wikidata="Q2207288" url="?curid=261177" title="Craft">
<text>A craft or trade is a pastime or an occupation that requires particular skills and knowledge of skilled work. In a historical sense, particularly the Middle Ages and earlier, the term is usually applied to people occupied in small scale production of goods, or their maintenance, for example by tinkers. The traditional term &quot;craftsman&quot; is nowadays often replaced by &quot;artisan&quot; and by &quot;craftsperson&quot;.

Historically, the more specialized crafts with high-value products tended to concentrate in urban centers and their practitioners formed guilds. The skill required by their professions and the need to be permanently involved in the exchange of goods often demanded a higher level of education, and craftspeople were usually in a more privileged position than the peasantry in societal hierarchy. The households of artisans were not as self-sufficient as those of people engaged in agricultural work, and therefore had to rely on the exchange of goods. Some crafts, especially in areas such as pottery, woodworking, and various stages of textile production, could be practiced on a part-time basis by those also working in agriculture, and often formed part of village life.

When an apprentice finished their apprenticeship, they became a journeyman searching for a place to set up their own shop and make a living. After setting up their own shop, they could then call themselves a master of their craft.

This stepwise approach to mastery of a craft, which includes the attainment of some education and skill, has survived in some countries to the present day. But crafts have undergone deep structural changes since and during the era of the Industrial Revolution. The mass production of goods by large-scale industry has limited crafts to market segments in which industry&#x27;s modes of functioning or its mass-produced goods do not satisfy the preferences of potential buyers. As an outcome of these changes, craftspeople today increasingly make use of semi-finished components or materials and adapt these to their customers&#x27; requirements or demands. Thus, they participate in a certain division of labour between industry and craft.

== Nature of craft skill ==
The nature of craft skill and the process of its development are continually debated by philosophers, anthropologists, and cognitive scientists. Some scholars note that craft skill is marked by particular ways of experiencing tools and materials, whether by allowing tools to recede from focal awareness, perceiving tools and materials in terms of their practical interrelationships, or seeing aspects of work that are invisible to the untrained observer. Other scholars working on craft skill focus on observational learning and mimicry, exploring how learners visually parse the movements of experts. Certain researchers even de-emphasize the role of the individual craftsperson, noting the collective nature of craft understanding or emphasizing the role of materials as collaborators in the process of production.

== Classification ==
There are three aspects to human creativity: art, crafts, and science. Roughly, art relies upon intuitive sensing, vision, and expression; crafts upon sophisticated technique; and science upon knowledge.

=== Handicraft ===

Handicraft is the &quot;traditional&quot; main sector of the crafts. It is a type of work where useful and decorative devices are made completely by hand or by using only simple tools. The term is usually applied to traditional means of making goods. The individual artisanship of the items is a paramount criterion, an such items often have cultural and/or religious significance. Items made by mass production or machines are not handicraft goods.

The beginning of crafts in areas like the Ottoman Empire involved the governing bodies requiring members of the city who were skilled at creating goods to open shops in the center of town. These people slowly stopped acting as subsistence farmers (who created goods in their own homes to trade with neighbors) and began to represent what we think of as &quot;craftspeople&quot; today.

Besides traditional goods, handicraft contributes to the field of computing by combining craft practices with technology. For example, in 1968, the &quot;Apollo 8&quot; spacecraft&#x27;s core memory consisted of wires that were woven around and through electromagnetic cores by hand. The core rope memory they created contained information used to successfully complete the mission.

Crafts and craftspeople have become a subject of academic study. For example, Stephanie Bunn was an artist before she became an anthropologist, and she went on to develop an academic interest in the process of craft. She argues that what happens to an object before it becomes a &quot;product&quot; is an area worthy of study.

=== The Arts and Crafts Movement ===
The term &quot;crafts&quot; is used to describe artistic practices within the family of decorative arts that traditionally are defined by their relationship to functional or utilitarian products (such as sculptural forms in the vessel tradition) or by their use of such natural media as wood, clay, ceramics, glass, textiles, and metal.

The Arts and Crafts Movement originated in Britain during the late 19th century and was characterized by a style of decoration reminiscent of medieval times. The primary artist associated with the movement is William Morris, whose work was reinforced with writings from John Ruskin. The movement placed a high importance on the quality of craftsmanship, while emphasizing the importance for the arts to contribute to economic reform.

=== Studio crafts ===

Crafts practiced by independent artists working alone or in small groups are referred to as studio craft. Studio craft includes studio pottery, metalwork, weaving, woodturning, paper and other forms of woodworking, glassblowing, and glass art.

These crafts emphasize individuality, creativity, and the artist’s direct engagement with materials and techniques. Unlike mass-produced or factory-made goods, studio craft pieces are often one-of-a-kind or produced in limited editions, showcasing the maker’s personal style and artistic vision. Many studio craft artists blend traditional craftsmanship with contemporary design, pushing the boundaries of their chosen medium. The movement gained momentum in the 20th century as artists sought to elevate craft to the status of fine art, often exhibiting their works in galleries and museums. Today, studio craft continues to thrive, supported by craft schools, residencies, and a growing appreciation for handmade, artisanal objects.

=== Craft fairs ===

A craft fair is an organized event to display and sell crafts. There are also craft stores where such goods are sold and craft communities, such as Craftster, where expertise is shared.

Craft fairs can range in size from small local gatherings to large-scale events that attract artisans and visitors from across the country. These fairs often feature handmade items such as jewelry, pottery, textiles, woodwork, and home décor, highlighting the creativity and craftsmanship of independent artisans. Many craft fairs also include live demonstrations, workshops, and interactive booths where attendees can learn traditional and modern crafting techniques. Seasonal and holiday-themed craft fairs are particularly popular, offering unique, handcrafted gifts. Additionally, some craft fairs emphasize sustainability by promoting eco-friendly materials and upcycled goods, aligning with the growing interest in ethical consumerism.

=== Tradesperson ===

A tradesperson is a skilled manual worker in a particular trade or craft, with a high degree of both practical and theoretical knowledge of their trade. In cultures where professional careers are highly prized, there can be a shortage of skilled manual workers, leading to lucrative niche markets in the trades.

<text>Robert Treat Paine (March 11, 1731May 11, 1814) was a lawyer, politician and Founding Father of the United States who signed the Continental Association and Declaration of Independence as a representative of Massachusetts. He served as the state&#x27;s first attorney general and as an associate justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, the state&#x27;s highest court.

==Early life and ancestors==

Robert Treat Paine was born in Boston, Province of Massachusetts Bay, in British America, on March 11, 1731. He was one of five children of the Rev. Thomas Paine and Eunice (Treat) Paine. His father was pastor of Franklin Road Baptist Church in Weymouth but moved his family to Boston in 1730 and subsequently became a merchant there. His mother was the daughter of Rev. Samuel Treat, whose father Maj. Robert Treat was one of the principal founders of Newark, New Jersey, and later a governor of Connecticut. Robert Treat Paine&#x27;s Treat family had a long history in the British colonies and his Paine family, in particular, can trace a lineage back to the &quot;Mayflower&quot;.

==Education==
Paine attended the Boston Latin School and then entered Harvard College at age 14; he graduated in 1749 at age 18. He then taught school for several years, first back at Boston Latin and later in Lunenburg, Massachusetts. Paine also attempted a merchant career, with journeys to the Carolinas, the Azores, and Spain as well as a whaling voyage to Greenland. He began the study of law in 1755 with his mother&#x27;s cousin in Lancaster, Massachusetts.

Paine served as a chaplain in the Crown Point Expedition in 1755 during the French and Indian War. Upon returning to civilian life, he did some occasional preaching and returned to his legal studies. In 1756, he returned to Boston to continue his legal preparations with Samuel Prat, and he was admitted to the bar in 1757. He first considered establishing his law practice at Portland (then part of Massachusetts but now in Maine), but instead in 1761 moved to Taunton, Massachusetts, then back to Boston in 1780.

==Legal career==
In 1768, he was a delegate to a provincial convention called to meet in Boston. Paine, along with the Solicitor General of Massachusetts Samuel Quincy, conducted the prosecution of Captain Thomas Preston and eight soldiers under his command following the Boston Massacre of March 5, 1770. John Adams was opposing counsel, and Adams&#x27; arguments won the jury&#x27;s sway, and most of the troops were let off.

Paine served in the Massachusetts General Court from 1773 to 1774, in the Provincial Congress from 1774 to 1775, as well as represented Massachusetts at the Continental Congress from 1774 through 1776. In that Congress, he signed the final appeal to the king (the Olive Branch Petition of 1775) and helped frame the rules of debate and acquire gunpowder for the coming war, and in 1776 was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.

He returned to Massachusetts at the end of December 1776 and was speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1777, a member of the executive council in 1779, a member of the committee that drafted the state constitution in 1780. He was Massachusetts Attorney General from 1777 to 1790 and prosecuted the treason trials following Shays&#x27; Rebellion. From 1777 to 1785, his acting Attorney General was Benjamin Kent. In 1780, he was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He last served as a justice of the State Supreme Court from 1790 to 1804 when he retired.

==Death and legacy==

Paine died at age 83 in 1814 and was buried in Boston&#x27;s Granary Burying Ground. Many of his papers, including correspondence and legal notes, are now held by the Massachusetts Historical Society. Paine was a Congregationalist and a devout Christian. When his church, the First Church in Boston, moved into Unitarianism, Paine followed that path. A statue of Paine by Richard E. Brooks was erected at Taunton&#x27;s Church Green in 1904. Paine is an honoree of the Washington, D.C., Memorial to the 56 Signers of the Declaration of Independence.

Paine married Sally Cobb, the daughter of Thomas and Lydia (née Leonard) Cobb and a sister of General David Cobb, on March 15, 1770. She was born May 15, 1744, and died June 6, 1816. They were the parents of eight children:
* Robert Paine (May 14, 1770 – July 28, 1798), died unmarried, graduate of Harvard College.
* Sally Paine (March 7, 1772 – January 26, 1823), died unmarried.
* Robert Treat Paine Jr. (December 9, 1773 – November 13, 1811), graduate of Harvard College. 
* Charles Paine (August 30, 1775 – February 15, 1810), graduate of Harvard College, married Sarah Sumner Cushing (niece of both U.S. Supreme Court associate Justice William Cushing and Massachusetts Governor Increase Sumner).
* Henry Paine (October 20, 1777 – June 8, 1814), married Olive Lyman, daughter of Theodore Lyman.
* Mary Paine (February 9, 1780 – February 27, 1842), married Rev. Elisha Clap, graduate of Harvard College. 
* Maria Antoinetta Paine (December 2, 1782 – March 26, 1842), married Deacon Samuel Greele.
* Lucretia Paine (April 30, 1785 – August 27, 1823), died unmarried.

Some of his notable descendants include:
* Charles Jackson Paine
* John Paine
* Robert Treat Paine Storer
* Robert Treat Paine, owner of The Robert Treat Paine Estate, known as Stonehurst
* Lyman Paine. He married, in 1926, Ruth Forbes of the distinguished Forbes family and a great-granddaughter of Ralph Waldo Emerson
* Sumner Paine
* Michael Paine, husband of Ruth Paine
* Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Treat Paine III, zoologist
* Treat Williams, actor

Penn was born near Port Royal in Caroline County, Virginia, the son of Moses Penn and Catherine (Taylor) Penn. He attended at common school for two years as his father did not consider education to be important. At age 18, after his father&#x27;s death, Penn privately read law with his uncle, Edmund Pendleton. He became a lawyer in Virginia in 1762.

On July 28, 1763, Penn married Susannah Lyne. The couple had three children. Their daughter, Lucy, married John Taylor of Caroline, a political leader from Virginia.

In 1774, Penn moved to the Stovall, North Carolina. There, he was a representative at the colony&#x27;s Third Provincial Congress in August 1775. In 1775 Penn was elected to the Continental Congress. He was re-elected in 1777, 1778 and 1779 and is said to have served with distinction. During his tenure, he signed the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation.

In 1780 Penn was appointed to the North Carolina board of war. Following his appointment to the Congress, he practiced law until his death in 1788.

==Legacy==
The naval ship USS &quot;John Penn&quot; was named in his honor. A historical highway marker honoring Penn was erected in near his home in Stovall in 1936; it was the first such marker erected by the state of North Carolina.

<doc id="261180" wikidata="Q471303" url="?curid=261180" title="George Read (American politician, born 1733)">
<text>George Read (September 18, 1733 – September 21, 1798) was an American politician from New Castle in New Castle County, Delaware. He was a Continental Congressman from Delaware, a delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787, president of Delaware, and a member of the Federalist Party. In addition, Read served as U.S. Senator from Delaware and chief justice of Delaware.

Read was a Founding Father of the United States, one of only two statesmen who signed four of the great state papers on which the country&#x27;s founding is based: Petition to the King and Continental Association, both passed by the Congress of 1774, as well as the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and Constitution of the United States in 1787.

==Father==

Read was the son of John and Mary (Howell) Read. John Read was born in Dublin, Ireland, the son of an Englishman of large fortune belonging to the family of Read of Berkshire, Hertfordshire, and Oxfordshire. The death of his beloved having left him bereft, John Read came to the American colonies and, with a view of diverting his mind, entered into extensive enterprises in Maryland and Delaware.

Soon after his arrival in America, John Read purchased a large estate in Cecil County, Maryland, and founded with six associates the city of Charlestown on the headwaters of Chesapeake Bay, with the intention of creating a new market for the northern trade. They developed northern Maryland and built up the neighboring iron works of the Principio Company, in which the older generations of the Washington family, and at a later period General George Washington, were also largely interested.

As an original proprietor of Charlestown, John Read was appointed by the colonial legislature of Maryland one of the commissioners to lay it out and govern it. He held various military offices during his life, and in his later years resided on his plantation in New Castle County.

==Early life==
George Read was born at Cecil County, Maryland, on September 18, 1733. When he was an infant, the family moved to New Castle County, Delaware, settling near the village of Christiana. As he grew up, Read joined Thomas McKean at the Rev. Francis Allison&#x27;s Academy at New London, Pennsylvania, and then studied law in Philadelphia with John Moland. He was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar in 1753, and a year later he returned home to establish a practice at New Castle.

In 1763 he married Gertrude Ross Till, daughter of the Rev. George Ross, the Anglican rector of Immanuel Church in New Castle and widowed sister of George Ross, also a future signer of the Declaration of Independence. They had four children, John, George Jr., William, and Mary, who married Matthew Pearce (she is often confused with her paternal aunt, Mary Read, who in 1769 married Gunning Bedford, Sr., a future Governor of Delaware). They lived on The Strand in New Castle, and their house was in what is now the garden of the present Read House and Gardens, owned by the Delaware Historical Society. They were members of Immanuel Episcopal Church.

In 1763 John Penn, the proprietary governor, appointed Read crown attorney general for the three Delaware counties, and he served in that position until leaving for the Continental Congress in 1774. He also served in the Colonial Assembly of the lower Delaware counties for twelve sessions, from 1764/65 through 1775/76.

==American Revolution==

Eighteenth-century Delaware was politically divided into loose factions known as the &quot;Court Party&quot; and the &quot;Country Party.&quot; The majority Court Party was generally Anglican, strongest in Kent and Sussex Counties, worked well with the colonial proprietary government and was in favor of reconciliation with the British government. The minority Country Party was largely Ulster-Scot, centered in New Castle County, and quickly advocated independence from the British. Read was often the leader of the Court party faction, and as such he generally worked in opposition to Caesar Rodney and his friend and neighbor Thomas McKean.

Read, like most other people in Delaware, was in favor of trying to reconcile differences with Great Britain. He opposed the Stamp Act and similar measures of Parliament but supported anti-importation measures and dignified protests. He was quite reluctant to pursue the option of outright independence. Nevertheless, from 1764 he led the Delaware Committee of Correspondence and was elected to serve along with the more radical McKean and Rodney in the First and Second Continental Congress from 1774 to 1777. He was frequently absent, and when the Congress voted on American Independence on July 2, 1776, Read surprised many by voting against it. That meant that Rodney had to ride overnight to Philadelphia to break the deadlock in Delaware&#x27;s delegation for independence. However, when the Declaration of Independence was finally adopted, Read signed it despite his caution.

==Government of Delaware==
Anticipating the Declaration of Independence, the General Assembly of the lower counties declared its separation from the British government on June 15, 1776, in the New Castle Court House. Once the Declaration of Independence was actually adopted, the General Assembly called for elections to a Delaware constitutional convention to draft a constitution for the new state. Read was elected to this convention, became its president, and guided the passage of the McKean-drafted document, which became the Delaware Constitution of 1776.

Read was elected to the first Legislative Council of the Delaware General Assembly and was selected as the speaker in both the 1776/77 and 1777/78 sessions. At the time of the capture of President John McKinly, Read was in Philadelphia attending Congress; after narrowly escaping capture himself while he was returning home, he became president on October 20, 1777, serving until March 31, 1778. The British occupied Philadelphia and were in control of the Delaware River. Read tried, mostly in vain, to recruit additional soldiers and to protect the state from raiders from Philadelphia and off ships in the Delaware River. The Delaware General Assembly session of 1777/78 had to be moved to Dover, Delaware, for safety, and the Sussex County General Assembly delegation was never seated because disruptions at the polls had negated the election results.

After Rodney was elected to replace him as president, Read continued to serve in the Legislative Council until the 1778–79 session. After a one-year rest nursing ill health, he was elected to the House of Assembly for the 1780/81 and 1781/82 sessions. He returned to the Legislative Council in the 1782/83 session and served two terms until the 1787/88 session. On December 5, 1782, he was elected judge of the Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture.


==Federalist==

Read was again called to national service in 1786 when he represented Delaware at the Annapolis Convention. Because so few states were represented, this meeting produced only a report calling for a broader convention to be held in Philadelphia the next year. At what became the Constitutional Convention, Read again represented Delaware. Quoting from Wright &amp; Morris in their &quot;Soldier-Statesmen of the Constitution&quot;,

Read immediately argued for a new national government under a new Constitution, saying &#x27;to amend the Articles was simply putting old cloth on a new garment.&#x27; He was a leader in the fight for a strong central government, advocating, at one time, the abolition of the states altogether and the consolidation of the country under one powerful national government. &#x27;Let no one fear the states, the people are with us;&#x27; he declared to a Convention shocked by this radical proposal. With no one to support his motion, he settled for protecting the rights of the small states against the infringements of their larger, more populous neighbors who, he feared, would &#x27;probably combine to swallow up the smaller ones by addition, division or impoverishment.&#x27; He warned that Delaware &#x27;would become at once a cipher in the union&#x27; if the principle of equal representation embodied in the New Jersey (small-state) Plan was not adopted and if the method of amendment in the Articles was not retained. He favored giving Congress the power to veto state laws, making the federal legislature immune to popular whims by having senators hold office for nine years or during good behavior, and granting the U.S. President broad appointive powers. Outspoken, he threatened to lead the Delaware delegation out of the Convention if the rights of the small states were not specifically guaranteed in the new Constitution.

Once the rights were assured, he led the ratification movement in Delaware, which, partly as a result of his efforts, became the first state to ratify and did so unanimously.

==Senator==
Following the adoption of the U.S. Constitution, the Delaware General Assembly elected Read as one of its two U.S. Senators. His term began on March 4, 1789, and he was reelected in 1791 but resigned on September 18, 1793. Read served with the Pro-Administration Party majority in the First and Second Congress, under President Washington. He supported the assumption of state debts, establishment of a national bank, and the imposition of excise taxes. He resigned to accept an appointment as chief justice of the Delaware Supreme Court and served in that capacity until his death.

Read&#x27;s resignation from the Senate was before the first session of the Third Congress assembled, but it was not until February 7, 1795, four weeks before it adjourned, that Henry Latimer was elected to replace him. One of Delaware&#x27;s Senate seats was, therefore, vacant from September 18, 1793, until February 7, 1795.

==Death and legacy==
Read died at New Castle on September 21, 1798, from heart problems and is buried there in the Immanuel Episcopal Church Cemetery.

William T. Read in his &quot;Life and Correspondence&quot; describes Read as &quot;tall, slightly and gracefully formed, with pleasing features and lustrous brown eyes. His manners were dignified, bordering upon austerity, but courteous, and at times captivating. He commanded entire confidence, not only from his profound legal knowledge, sound judgment, and impartial decisions but from his severe integrity and the purity of his private character.&quot; However, a fellow delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 noted that &quot;his legal abilities are said to be very great, but his powers of oratory are fatiguing and tiresome to the last degree; his voice is feeble and his articulation so bad that few can have patience to attend him.&quot; Historians like John Monroe have generally recognized that all in all, Read was the dominating figure in Delaware politics during his career, directly or indirectly providing consistent and reliable leadership to the new state.

His home, Stonum, is a historic landmark. There is a school in New Castle and a dorm at the University of Delaware named for Read.

==In popular culture==
In the Broadway musical &quot;1776&quot;, Read is portrayed in a minor role as a proper, conservative, somewhat effete, and wealthy planter who has difficulty getting along with the other two members of the Delaware contingent who are for Independence. Duane Bodin played the character in the original Broadway cast and Leo Leyden appeared in the film version.

==Family==
Read&#x27;s brother Thomas was an officer in the Continental Navy during the war. Another brother, James, was an officer in the Continental Army and was later active in managing the navy under the Articles of Confederation. Read&#x27;s son George Read Jr. served as the first U.S. Attorney for Delaware, and his grandson George Read III served as the second. Another son, John Read, was a noted lawyer and banker of Philadelphia. Read&#x27;s great-granddaughter, Louisa, married Major Benjamin Kendrick Pierce, the brother of future President Franklin Pierce.

==Positions held==
Elections for the Delaware General Assembly were held on October 1, and members took office on October 20 or the following weekday. The colonial attorney general was appointed by the Crown. The Legislative Council was created in 1776, and its councilmen had a three-year term. State assemblymen had a one-year term. The whole General Assembly chose the Continental Congressmen for a one-year term and the state president for a three-year term. Read served as interim state president, filling the vacancy created by the resignation of McKean. The chief justice of the state Supreme Court was also selected by the General Assembly for the life of the person appointed. The General Assembly chose the U.S. Senators, who took office March 4 for a six-year term. However, Read&#x27;s first term was only two years to establish a rotation.

<text>Caesar Rodney (October 7, 1728 – June 26, 1784) was an American Founding Father, lawyer, and politician from St. Jones Neck in Dover Hundred, Kent County, Delaware. He was an officer of the Delaware militia during the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War, a Continental Congressman from Delaware, a signer of the Continental Association and Declaration of Independence, and president of Delaware during most of the American Revolution.

==Rodney family and early years==
Rodney was born on October 7, 1728, on his family&#x27;s plantation, &quot;Byfield&quot;, on St. Jones Neck in East Dover Hundred, Kent County, Delaware. Caesar was the eldest son of 2 children of Caesar and Elizabeth Crawford Rodney and grandson of William Rodney. William Rodney emigrated to the American colonies in 1681–1682, along with William Penn, and was speaker of the Colonial Assembly of the Delaware Counties in 1704. Rodney&#x27;s mother was the daughter of the Rev. Thomas Crawford, Anglican rector of Christ Church at Dover. Among the Rodney family ancestors were the prominent Adelmare family in Treviso, Italy, as attested by genealogy studies.

Byfield was an 849-acre farm worked by enslaved labor. The Rodneys were, by the standards of the day, prosperous members of the local gentry. The farm earned sufficient income from the sale of wheat and barley to the Philadelphia and West Indies markets to provide enough cash and leisure to allow members of the family to participate in the social and political life of Kent County. At Rodney&#x27;s death, he enslaved 18 people. His will manumitted three of advanced age upon his death, and held the others to a manumission schedule he devised. 

Caesar was educated when he was 13 or 14 years old. He attended The Latin School, part of the academy and the College of Philadelphia (now known as University of Pennsylvania) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania until his father&#x27;s death. Caesar was the only one of the Rodney children to receive anything approaching a formal education. Caesar Rodney&#x27;s father died in 1746, and Caesar&#x27;s guardianship was entrusted to Delaware Supreme Court Justice Nicholas Ridgely by the Delaware Orphan&#x27;s Court.

==Professional and political career==
Thomas Rodney described his brother at this time as having a &quot;great fund of wit and humor of the pleasing kind, so that his conversation was always bright and strong and conducted by wisdom...&quot; He lived as a bachelor, was generally esteemed and was indeed very popular. He had professed his love and affection for several Delaware ladies at various times but was never a successful suitor. Accordingly, he easily moved into the political world formerly occupied by his father and guardian.

At age twenty-seven in 1755, he was elected sheriff of Kent County and served the maximum three years allowed. This was a powerful and financially rewarding position, in that it supervised elections and chose the grand jurors who set the county tax rate. After serving his three years, he was appointed to a series of positions including Register of Wills, Recorder of Deeds, Clerk of the Orphan&#x27;s Court, Justice of the Peace, and judge in the lower courts. During the French and Indian War, he was commissioned captain of the Dover Hundred company in Col. John Vining&#x27;s regiment of the Delaware militia. They never saw active service. From 1769 through 1777, he was an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the Lower Counties.

Eighteenth-century Delaware was politically divided into loose factions known as the &quot;Court Party&quot; and the &quot;Country Party.&quot; The majority Court Party was generally Anglican, strongest in Kent and Sussex Counties, worked well with the colonial proprietary government, and was in favor of reconciliation with the British government. The minority Country Party was largely Ulster-Scot, centered in New Castle County, and quickly advocated independence from the British. In spite of being members of the Anglican Kent County gentry, Rodney and his brother Thomas increasingly aligned themselves with the Country Party, a distinct minority in Kent County. As such, he generally worked in partnership with Thomas McKean from New Castle County and in opposition to George Read.

==American Revolution==
Rodney joined McKean as a delegate to the Stamp Act Congress in 1765 and was a leader of the Delaware Committee of Correspondence. He began his service in the Assembly of Delaware in the 1761/1762 session and continued in office through the 1775/1776 session. Several times he served as speaker, including the momentous day of June 15, 1776, when &quot;with Rodney in the chair and Thomas McKean leading the debate on the floor,&quot; the Assembly of Delaware voted to sever all ties with the British Parliament and King.


Rodney served in the Continental Congress along with McKean and Read from 1774 through 1776. Rodney was in Dover tending to Loyalist activity in Sussex County when he received word from McKean that he and Read were deadlocked on the vote for independence. To break the deadlock, Rodney rode 70 miles through a thunderstorm on the night of July 1, 1776, arriving in Philadelphia &quot;in his boots and spurs&quot; on July 2, just as the voting had begun. He voted with McKean and thereby allowed Delaware to join eleven other states in voting in favor of the resolution of independence. The wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved two days later; Rodney signed it on August 2. Backlash in Delaware led to Rodney&#x27;s electoral defeat in Kent County for a seat in the upcoming Delaware Constitutional Convention and the new Delaware General Assembly.
Upon learning of the death of his friend John Haslet at the Battle of Princeton, Rodney rushed to the Continental Army to try to fill his place. Haslet was succeeded as colonel by David Hall as General George Washington returned Rodney home to be Delaware&#x27;s wartime governor and major-general of Delaware militia. The regiment Haslet had built was virtually destroyed at the Battle of Camden in 1780. Rodney, as major-general of the Delaware militia, protected the state from British military intrusions and controlled continued Loyalist activity, particularly in Sussex County, site of the 1780 Black Camp Rebellion.

Amidst the catastrophic events following the Battle of Brandywine and the British occupation of Wilmington and Philadelphia, a new General Assembly was elected in October 1777. First, it promptly put Rodney and McKean back into the Continental Congress. Then, with state President John McKinly in captivity and President George Read completely exhausted, they elected Rodney as President of Delaware on March 31, 1778. The office did not have the authority of a modern governor in the United States, so Rodney&#x27;s success came from his popularity with the General Assembly, where the real authority lay, and from the loyalty of the Delaware militia, which was the only means of enforcing that authority. Via his distant Italian heritage, one source has identified Rodney as the first Italian-American governor of a U.S. state.

Meanwhile, Rodney scoured the state for money, supplies and soldiers to support the national war effort. Delaware Continentals had fought well in many battles from the Battle of Long Island to the Battle of Monmouth, but in 1780 the army suffered its worst defeat at the Battle of Camden in South Carolina. The regiment was nearly destroyed and the remnant was so reduced it could only fight with a Maryland regiment for the remainder of the war. Rodney had done much to stabilize the situation, but his health was worsening, and he resigned his office on November 6, 1781, just after the conclusive Battle of Yorktown.

Rodney was elected by the Delaware General Assembly to the United States Congress under the Articles of Confederation in 1782 and 1783 but was unable to attend because of ill health. However, two years after leaving the state presidency he was elected to the 1783/84 session of the Legislative Council and, as a final gesture of respect, the council selected him to be their speaker. His health was now in rapid decline and even though the Legislative Council met at his home for a short time, he died before the session ended.

== Death and legacy ==
Rodney was tormented throughout his life by asthma, and his adult years were plagued by a facial cancer. He experienced expensive, painful, and futile medical treatments for the cancer. Caesar wore a green scarf to hide his disfigured face. He died from the disease after eight years. His body is buried at an unmarked grave on his beloved farm, &quot;Poplar Grove&quot; (known as &quot;Byfield&quot; today). While there is a marker that appears to be a gravestone for Caesar Rodney at Christ Episcopal Church, this is merely a monument. Many sources cite that he is buried there; however, most Delaware historians believe that the remains of one of Rodney&#x27;s unidentified relatives is buried there instead. Rodney actually is buried in an unmarked grave in his family&#x27;s unmarked plot on their former 800-acre farm east of Dover Air Force Base.

The Caesar Rodney School District in Delaware is named after him.

== Positions held ==

Elections were held October 1 and members of the General Assembly took office on October 20 or the following weekday. The State Legislative Council was created in 1776 and its Legislative Councilmen had a three-year term. State Assemblymen had a one-year term. The whole General Assembly chose the Continental Congressmen for a one-year term and the State President for a three-year term. The county sheriff also had a three-year term. Associate Justices of the state Supreme Court were also selected by the General Assembly for the life of the person appointed.


==In popular culture==
Caesar Rodney appears in the Broadway musical &quot;1776&quot; and its film adaptation. He is portrayed as an elderly man suffering severely from facial cancer, and he has to be taken home by fellow Delaware delegate Thomas McKean. Later, John Adams sends McKean back to Delaware to bring back Rodney to break the deadlock over independence between pro-independence McKean and anti-independence George Read. He is portrayed in the musical by Robert Gaus and in the film by William Hansen.

<doc id="261182" wikidata="Q655575" url="?curid=261182" title="George Ross (American politician)">
<text>George Ross Jr (May 10, 1730 – July 14, 1779) was a Founding Father of the United States who signed the Continental Association and the United States Declaration of Independence as a representative of Pennsylvania. He was also the uncle of the man who married Betsy Griscom in 1773, more famous under her married name, Betsy Ross. In 1952, Ross, George Washington, and Robert Morris appeared on a three-cent stamp commemorating Betsy Ross.

==Early life and family==

Ross was born on May 10, 1730, in New Castle, Delaware. He was educated at home and later studied law with his brother, before being admitted to the bar in Philadelphia.

His father was Rev. George Ross (1679–1754), who had 2 wives and 16 children, and was an Anglican clergyman who had emigrated from Scotland. Their paternal line goes back to Farquhar Ó Beólláin (1173–1251) whom King Alexander II of Scotland named 1st Earl of Ross in 1226 after great victories in battle.

George&#x27;s sister Gertrude married Thomas Till, the son of William Till, a prominent Sussex County judge and politician; after his death, she married George Read, another signer of the Declaration of Independence.

== Career ==
Ross was a member of the committee of safety and was elected to the Continental Congress. He was a colonel in the Pennsylvania militia (1775–1776) and vice-president of the first constitutional convention for Pennsylvania. Ross was the last of the Pennsylvania delegation to affix his signature to the Declaration of Independence. He had been loyal to the king, but he became disgusted with Tory politics and began to support the cause of the Patriots.
In 1750, he was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar (member of Pennsylvania) when he was 20 years old, and he established his own practice in Lancaster, where he married Ann Lawler in 1751. Together they had two sons and a daughter.

Initially a Tory, he served as Crown prosecutor for 12 years from 1768 to 1776. His sympathies began to change, and he became a strong supporter of the colonial assemblies in their disputes with Parliament. In 1768 he was elected to the provincial legislature of Pennsylvania. He was elected to Continental Congress in 1774, 1776, and 1777. He was a colonel in the Continental Army in 1776. In 1776, he undertook negotiations with the northwestern Indians on behalf of his colony, and that year he acted as vice president of the state constitutional convention, so then that led to helping draft a declaration of rights. He was re-elected to the Continental Congress in January 1777 but resigned that same year because of poor health. He was vice president of the Pennsylvania constitutional convention and was the Judge of the Admiralty Court of Pennsylvania in 1779. In 1778, while he was acting as admiralty judge, a congressional court of appeals overruled his decision in a case involving a dispute between a citizen of Connecticut and the state of Pennsylvania. He refused to acknowledge the authority of the higher court to counter state decisions, which initiated a dispute between manifestation of the states&#x27; rights controversy and did not subside until 1809.

He resigned from the Continental Congress in 1777 because of poor health and was appointed to the Pennsylvania Court of Admiralty where he died in 1779 at age 49. He was buried at Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia.

<doc id="261184" wikidata="Q721842" url="?curid=261184" title="Thomas Stone">
<text>Thomas Stone (1743 – October 5, 1787) was an American Founding Father, planter, politician, and lawyer who signed the United States Declaration of Independence as a delegate for Maryland. He later worked on the committee that formed the Articles of Confederation in 1777. He acted as president of Congress for a short time in 1784. Stone was a member of the Maryland Senate from 1777 to 1780 and again from 1781 to 1787.

==Early life and education==

Stone was born into a prominent family at Poynton Manor in Charles County, Maryland. He was the second son in the large family of David (1709–1773) and Elizabeth Jenifer Stone. His brothers, Michael Jenifer Stone and John Hoskins Stone, were also prominent in politics. His uncle was Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer. Thomas read law at the office of Thomas Johnson in Annapolis, was admitted to the bar in 1764, and opened a practice in Frederick, Maryland. The Jenifer family was of Swedish origin.

== Career ==
As the American Revolution neared, Stone joined the committee of correspondence for Charles County. From 1774 to 1776, he was a member of Maryland&#x27;s Annapolis Convention. In 1775, the convention sent Stone as a delegate to the Continental Congress. He was re-elected and attended regularly for several years. On May 15, 1776, he voted in favor of drafting a declaration of independence, in spite of restrictions from the Maryland convention that prevented their delegates from supporting it. In June the restriction was lifted, so Maryland&#x27;s delegates were free to vote for Independence. Previously, Stone had been in favor of opening diplomatic relations with Great Britain and not going to war, as he was not only a pacifist but a conservative reluctant to start a gruesome war.

That same year Stone was assigned to the committee that drafted the Articles of Confederation, and he was struck with a personal tragedy. His wife Margaret visited him in Philadelphia, which was in the midst of a smallpox epidemic. She was inoculated for the disease, but an adverse reaction to the treatment made her ill. Her health continued to decline for the rest of her life. After Stone signed the Declaration of Independence, he took his wife home and declined future appointment to the Congress, except for part of 1784, when the meetings were at Annapolis.

Stone accepted election to the Maryland Senate from 1779 until 1785, at first in order to promote the Articles of Confederation, which Maryland was the last state to approve. But he gave up the practice of law to care for his wife and children. As her health continued to decline, he gradually withdrew from public life. When Margaret died in 1787, he became depressed and died less than four months later in Alexandria, Virginia, reportedly of a &quot;broken heart&quot;.
Stone was buried at his plantation home, which still stands. After his death, the plantation remained in the family for five generations until 1936 when it sold privately. In 1977 the main structure was severely damaged by fire. The National Park Service purchased the property and restored it to its original plans. &quot;Habredeventure&quot; today is the centerpiece of the Thomas Stone National Historic Site and is operated as a museum by the National Park Service.

== Personal life ==
In 1768, Stone married Margaret Brown (1751–1787), the younger sister of Gustavus R. Brown (see Rose Hill), thought to be the richest man in the county. Soon after, Stone purchased his first 400 acres (1.6 km2) and began the construction of his estate named Habre de Venture. The family made their home there, and they had three children: Margaret (1771–1809), Mildred (1773–1837) and Fredrik (1774–1793). Stone&#x27;s law practice kept him away from home, so he brought in his younger brother Michael to manage development of the plantation, which utilized slaves for generations.

<doc id="261185" wikidata="Q1369216" url="?curid=261185" title="George Taylor (Pennsylvania politician)">
<text>George Taylor (c. 1716 – February 23, 1781) was an American ironmaster and politician who was a Founding Father of the United States and a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence as a representative of Pennsylvania. His former home, the George Taylor House in Catasauqua, Pennsylvania, was named a National Historic Landmark in 1971.

==Early life and education==
Taylor was born in the North of Ireland (now Northern Ireland), possibly Ulster, in 1716. He emigrated to the American colonies at age 20, landing in Philadelphia in 1736. According to early 18th century biographies of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, he is believed to have been the son of a Protestant clergyman. To pay for his passage, Taylor was indentured to Samuel Savage Jr., who was ironmaster at the French Creek Iron Works in Coventry in Chester County northwest of Philadelphia.

==Career==
===Iron worker===
Taylor started as a laborer at the ironworks, but when it was discovered he had a certain degree of education, he was promoted by 1739 to a position in the offices as a clerk.

In 1738, Savage, his brother-in-law Samuel Nutt Jr., and his mother Anna Savage Nutt built Warwick Furnace, a cold blast, charcoal furnace to the west, which they named Warwick. Savage died in 1742, and the following year, Taylor married Savage&#x27;s widow, Ann, whose maiden name was also Taylor. In 1745, under iron master John Potts, Taylor was made manager of the works, which consisted of the furnace and Coventry Forge. When Ann&#x27;s son Samuel III reached legal age in 1752, the son assumed ownership of the mills by the terms of his father&#x27;s will.

The Taylors continued to live at Warwick Furnace until 1755, when Taylor formed a partnership to lease the Durham Furnace in Upper Bucks County, north of Philadelphia. The ironworks, built in 1727, was started by a group of investors who were among Pennsylvania&#x27;s wealthiest and most influential men, including James Logan, proprietor of the Pennsylvania colony for the Penn family, and William Allen, later the colony&#x27;s chief justice and founder of Allentown (then called Northampton Town).

===Political career===

Shortly after becoming ironmaster at Durham, Taylor entered public life for the first time, serving as a justice of the peace in Bucks County, Pennsylvania from 1757 to 1763. When the lease for the Durham mill expired, the Taylors relocated to Easton, the county seat of Northampton County, where they purchased a stone house near the center of town and built a stable nearby. Continuing his interest in public affairs, Taylor was commissioned as a justice of the peace in Northampton County and was elected to the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly. He also helped build a new county courthouse in Easton&#x27;s center square.

In 1767, Taylor purchased near Allentown at Biery&#x27;s Port, which is now part of Catasauqua, Pennsylvania. The house was completed in 1768, but Taylor&#x27;s wife Ann died shortly after the Taylors moved in. Taylor continued living there for the next several years and, for a time, leased half of the property for farming. In 1776, two years after moving back to Durham, he sold the estate. Two centuries later, on July 17, 1971, the George Taylor House was designated as a National Historical Landmark.

While still at Biery&#x27;s Port, Taylor arranged another lease to operate the Durham ironworks in 1774. The ironworks had just been acquired by Joseph Galloway, a Philadelphia attorney and speaker of the Pennsylvania General Assembly (1766–1774). After failing to gain support in the First Continental Congress for his plan to avert a break with England, Galloway resigned as speaker and refused to attend the Second Continental Congress in 1775. Taylor, meanwhile, was re-elected to the Assembly in 1775 and attended the Provincial Convention on January 23. In July, as colonial forces prepared for war, he was commissioned as a colonel in the third battalion of the Pennsylvania militia.

Two weeks later, on August 2, Taylor secured a contract with Pennsylvania&#x27;s Committee of Safety for cannon shot. On August 25, with a shipment of 258 round balls weighing from 18 to 32 pounds each, Durham Furnace became the first ironworks in Pennsylvania to supply munitions to the Continental Army.

===Founding father and signer of the Declaration of Independence===
In 1776, the Continental Congress voted for independence on July 2 and adopted the Declaration of Independence two days later, on July 4. Before the vote for independence, five of Pennsylvania&#x27;s delegates, all Loyalists, were forced to resign. On July 20, Taylor was among the replacements appointed by the Assembly. One of his first duties as a member of Congress was to affix his signature to the Declaration of Independence, which he did on August 2, along with most delegates. Of the 56 signers, he was one of only eight who were foreign-born, the only one to have been indentured, and the only one to hold the position of ironmaster. Of the 56 signers of the Declaration, Taylor was one of the 41 who owned slaves.

===Durham Furnace===
Taylor&#x27;s service in Congress was brief, lasting under seven months. On February 17, 1777, when the Assembly appointed a new Pennsylvania delegation, Taylor was one of seven signers from Pennsylvania who were not among those renominated. In March 1777, he was appointed to Pennsylvania&#x27;s Supreme Executive Council, which was formed to govern the commonwealth under its new constitution. Taylor attended all of the council&#x27;s daily meetings from March 4 through April 5 but fell ill and was bedridden for more than a month. He subsequently retired from the council, ending his public career.

Taylor continued overseeing cannon shot and shells production at Durham Furnace for the Continental Army and Navy. Not long after independence was achieved, however, Joseph Galloway fled Philadelphia, first seeking refuge with British General William Howe and later escaping to England. Galloway was subsequently convicted by the Assembly as a traitor, and his properties, including the Durham mill, were seized.

Taylor filed an appeal with the Supreme Executive Council that enabled him to finish the first five years of his lease, but in 1779, the Commissioner of Forfeited Estates sold Durham Furnace to a new owner. Forming yet another partnership, Taylor leased Greenwich Forge in what is now Warren County, New Jersey.

==Personal life==
Little is known of Taylor&#x27;s life before he arrived in Philadelphia in 1736, although there is general agreement that he was born in Northern Ireland (possibly Ulster). His wife Ann Taylor&#x27;s lineage, however, is well documented. Her grandfather, John Taylor, came to Pennsylvania from Wiltshire, England, in 1684 and became surveyor general of Chester County, Pennsylvania, which then accounted for about one-third of the colony. Later, her father, Isaac Taylor, served as Chester County&#x27;s deputy surveyor general. Ann&#x27;s family belonged to the Society of Friends, but she was disowned as a Quaker in 1733 for her marriage outside the circle to Samuel Savage Jr.

George and Ann Taylor had two children: a daughter Ann, who was called Nancy and died sometime during childhood, and a son James, who was born at Warwick Furnace in 1746. James studied law after his parents moved to Easton in 1763. In 1767, he married Elizabeth Gordon, the 17-year-old daughter of Lewis Gordon, Easton&#x27;s first resident attorney. The couple initially lived in Easton but moved to Allentown, where James practiced law until he died in 1775. James and his wife had five children: George, Thomas, James Jr., Ann, and Mary.

==Death and legacy==
In failing health, Taylor moved back to Easton in April 1780 and died there on February 23, 1781, at the age of 65. Taylor was buried in St. John&#x27;s Lutheran Church cemetery across from his residence at Fourth and Ferry Streets in Easton. When the church property was sold in 1870 for construction of a public school, Taylor was re-interred at Easton Cemetery. Residents dedicated a monument there in Taylor&#x27;s honor in 1855, and his body rests in front of the memorial. The house he leased in his final days is now known as the Parsons-Taylor House. Easton founder William Parsons built it in 1753 and is Easton&#x27;s oldest still-standing house today.

Taylor&#x27;s will was filed in January 1781, the month before his death, and was entered into probate in Northampton County on March 10. Taylor bequeathed £500 to George, his eldest grandchild, and another £500 to Naomi Smith, his housekeeper, &quot;in Consideration of her great Care &amp; Attendance on me for a Number of Years.&quot; The remainder of Taylor&#x27;s estate was to be divided equally between the grandchildren and five children he fathered with Naomi Smith: Sarah, Rebecca, Naomi, Elizabeth, and Edward. None of these bequests were ever fulfilled, however. Taylor had been experiencing financial difficulties in the last few years of his life, and legal entanglements over the Durham and Greenwich forges dragged on until 1799, at which point his estate was judged insolvent.

<text>Matthew Thornton (March 3, 1714 – June 24, 1803) was an Irish-born Founding Father of the United States who signed the United States Declaration of Independence as a representative of New Hampshire.

== Background and early life ==
Thornton was born in Ireland in 1714 to James and Elizabeth (&quot;née&quot; Jenkins) Thornton, James Thornton lived on a farm within a mile of Derry, and this is where Matthew was probably born, although Lisburn and Limerick have also been suggested as birthplaces.

In 1716, Thornton&#x27;s family immigrated to North America when he was three years old, settling first in Wiscasset, Maine. On July 11, 1722, the community was attacked by Native Americans. James and Elizabeth Thornton fled from their burning home with Matthew, moving shortly thereafter to Worcester, Massachusetts. Thornton completed studies in medicine at Leicester. He became a physician and established a medical practice in Londonderry, New Hampshire. He was appointed as a surgeon for the New Hampshire Militia troops in an expedition against Fortress Louisbourg in 1745. He served in the New Hampshire Provincial Assembly from 1758-1762, had royal commissions as justice of the peace, and served as colonel in the militia from 1775 until his resignation in 1779.

In 1760, Thornton married Hannah Jack, and the couple had five children. Thornton became a Londonderry selectman, a representative to and president of the Provincial Assembly, and a member of the Committee of Safety, drafting New Hampshire&#x27;s plan of government after dissolution of the royal government, which was the first state constitution adopted after the start of hostilities with England.

== Continental Congress ==

Thornton served as the president of the New Hampshire Provincial Congress in 1775, and from January to September 1776, as speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. He was elected to the Continental Congress after the debates on independence had occurred, but as he did not arrive in Philadelphia until November 1776, he was granted permission to actually sign the Declaration of Independence four months after the formal signing in July.

== Later life ==

He became a political essayist. He retired from his medical practice, and in 1780, moved to Merrimack, New Hampshire, where he farmed and operated Thornton&#x27;s ferry with his family. Although he did not attend law school, he served as a judge on the New Hampshire Superior Court from 1776 to 1782.

In 1783, Thornton represented the towns of Merrimack and Bedford in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, and then Hillsborough County in the New Hampshire Senate from 1784 to 1787, while simultaneously serving as a state counselor from 1785 to 1786 and as a state representative again for Merrimack in 1786. His wife Hannah died in 1786.

== Death and legacy ==
Thornton died in Newburyport, Massachusetts, while visiting his daughter. He was 89 years old.

The town of Thornton, New Hampshire, is named in his honor, as is a Londonderry elementary school, and Thorntons Ferry School in Merrimack. Thornton&#x27;s residence in Derry, which was part of Londonderry at the time, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. He is featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 79) along U.S. Route 3 in Merrimack.

Thornton was the uncle of Capt. Matthew Thornton, a suspected Loyalist who was charged with treason related to actions just before the Battle of Bennington in 1777. Ebenezer Webster, father of Daniel Webster, was enlisted to investigate the allegation. At his trial Capt. Thornton pleaded not guilty. Evidence was presented both for and against and the jury found him not guilty, whereupon he was discharged.

<doc id="261187" wikidata="Q878512" url="?curid=261187" title="George Walton">
<text>George Walton ( – February 2, 1804) was a Founding Father of the United States who signed the United States Declaration of Independence while representing Georgia in the Continental Congress. Walton also served briefly as the second chief executive of Georgia in 1779 and was again named governor in 1789–1790. In 1795, he was appointed to the U.S. Senate, to complete the unexpired term of a senator who had resigned.

==Early life==
Walton was born in Cumberland County, Virginia. The exact year of Walton&#x27;s birth is unknown; it is believed that he was born in 1749. Research has placed it as early as 1740, but others as late as 1749 and 1750. The biographer of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, Della Gray Bartholomew, uses 1741. His parents died when he was an infant, which resulted in his adoption by an uncle with whom he entered apprenticeship as a carpenter. Walton was a studious young man, but his uncle actively discouraged all study and believed a studious boy to be an idle one. Walton continued studying, and once his apprenticeship had ended, moved to Savannah, Georgia, in 1769 to study law under a Mr. Young and was admitted to the bar in 1774. His brother was John Walton. By the end of the American Revolution, he had become one of the most successful lawyers in Georgia.

==American Revolution==
He became an advocate of the Patriot cause, was elected secretary of the Georgia Provincial Congress, and became president of the Council of Safety. In 1776, he served as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, a position that he held until the end of 1778. On July 2, 1776, he voted in favor of the Declaration of Independence for Georgia, along with Button Gwinnett and Lyman Hall.

During the American Revolutionary War, he was in the battalion of General Robert Howe. On January 9, 1778, Walton received a commission as colonel of the First Georgia Regiment of Militia. During the Battle of Savannah in 1778, Walton was injured in the battle and taken prisoner. He was hit in the thigh by a musket ball that threw him from his horse. He was subsequently captured by the British, who allowed his wound to heal before sending him to Sunbury Prison, where other colonial prisoners were held. Walton was released under a prisoner exchange in October 1779.

In October 1779, Walton was elected governor of Georgia for the first time, a position that he held for only two months.

==Later life==
In November 1795, he was appointed to the US Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of James Jackson. Walton served in that position from November 16, 1795, to February 20, 1796, when a successor, Josiah Tattnall, was officially elected. He was a political ally of Scottish General Lachlan McIntosh and a foe of Button Gwinnett. He and Gwinnett had political battles that resulted in his expulsion from office and indictment for various criminal activities. He was later censured for his support of a duel that resulted in Gwinnett&#x27;s death by McIntosh.

Walton was for the Yazoo land sales, the massive real estate fraud perpetrated in the mid-1790s by Georgia Governor George Mathews and the Georgia General Assembly. The scandal brought Jackson home from the US Senate to lead a reform movement. Appointed to fill the vacant seat, a feud erupted between Jackson and Walton over the sale of land to speculators. Jackson won, and Walton left the office.

In 1788, Alexander McGillivray and other Creek Indian leaders met with Georgia leaders at Rock Landing, but the meeting failed to result in a peace treaty. That led Governor Walton to worry that &quot;our prospects of peace have been obliged to yield to the impressions of war.&quot; Walton wrote to Colonel Jared Irwin and expressed both his concern and his surprise at the recent Indian depredations near the Oconee River. A treaty was not signed at Rock Landing, but eventually, the Treaty of New York (1790) ceded Creek lands to the state of Georgia.

During the 1780s, Walton devoted himself almost exclusively to Georgia state politics. He served as chief justice, commissioner to negotiate a treaty with the Cherokee in 1783, member of the Augusta Board of Commissioners (1784 and 1785), and commissioner to settle the border dispute between South Carolina and Georgia in 1786. He was elected as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, but he declined since his commitments at the state level occupied his time to the exclusion of all else. In 1789, he was a presidential elector and served at the state convention to adopt a new constitution. Walton was elected to a second term as governor in 1789 and served for one year. During his term, Georgians adopted the new Georgia Constitution, moved the capital to Augusta, and concentrated on settling the western frontier. After completing his tenure as governor, Walton served as a judge of the superior court from 1790 to his death. He also filled the unexpired term of James Jackson in the US Senate in 1795 to 1796. He was a founder and trustee of the Academy of Richmond County in Augusta and of Franklin College (now the University of Georgia) in Athens.

==Offices held==
The offices he held were:
* Continental Congress (1776–1778)
* Colonel of the First Georgia Militia (1778)
* Governor of Georgia (1779–1780)
* U.S. Congress (1780–1781)
* Chief Justice of Georgia (1783–1789)
* Acting Governor of Georgia (1789–1790)
* U.S. Senator (1795–1796)

==Death and legacy==
During his second term as governor, he built Meadow Garden, a cottage constructed on confiscated Tory land outside of Augusta, where he died. He was survived by his wife Dorothy, née Camber, whom he had married in 1775, and one of his two sons. He was initially buried at Rosney, home of his nephew Robert Watkins; he was re-interred in 1848 beneath the Signers Monument in front of the courthouse on Greene Street in Augusta. Even though Walton was from Georgia and Virginia, he did not own slaves.

Walton County, Georgia, is named for him. There are also at least two schools that bear his name: George Walton Comprehensive High School in Marietta, Georgia, and George Walton Academy, a private school in Monroe, Georgia.

His son George Walton, Jr., was the first secretary of the Territory of Florida. He was also the first civilian to serve in the role of governor of the territory, being named as acting governor until the arrival of William Duval. Walton County, Florida, is named for him. His granddaughter, Octavia Walton Le Vert, was a noted socialite and author. His great nephew Thomas George Walton built Creekside near Morganton, North Carolina.

<doc id="261188" wikidata="Q1969780" url="?curid=261188" title="William Whipple">
<text>William Whipple Jr. (January 25, 1731 NS [January 14, 1730 OS] – November 28, 1785) was an American Founding Father and signatory of the United States Declaration of Independence. He represented New Hampshire as a member of the Continental Congress from 1776 through 1779. He worked as both a ship&#x27;s captain and a merchant, and he studied in college to become a judge. He died of heart complications in 1785, aged 55.

== Early life and education ==
Whipple was born in Kittery in the Province of Massachusetts Bay (now Maine) in the William Whipple House to Captain William Whipple Sr. and his wife Mary (née Cutt). He was educated at a common school until he went off to sea, where he became a ship&#x27;s master at age 21. He married his first cousin Catherine Moffat in 1767, and they moved into the Moffatt-Ladd House on Market Street in Portsmouth in 1769. Their son William Whipple III died in infancy. Whipple was a descendant of Samuel Appleton, early settler in Ipswich, Massachusetts.

Whipple earned his fortune participating in the triangular trade between North America, the West Indies, and Africa, dealing in wood, rum, and enslaved people. He established himself as a merchant in Portsmouth in 1759, in partnership with his brother Joseph.

== Political career ==
In 1775, New Hampshire dissolved the British Royal government and organized a House of Representatives and an Executive Council known collectively as a Provincial Congress. Whipple was elected to represent Portsmouth. He became a member of the Committee of Safety. He was then elected to the Continental Congress and signed the United States Declaration of Independence. He was the second cousin of fellow signatory Stephen Hopkins. In January 1776, Whipple wrote to fellow signatory Josiah Bartlett of the approaching convention:


Whipple freed his enslaved servant, Prince Whipple, believing that no man could fight for freedom and hold another in bondage. He wrote:

==Military career==
The New Hampshire Provincial Congress gave Whipple his first commission in 1777. His enslaved servant Prince Whipple joined him, but challenged his position as a slave. Prince argued with William saying &quot;You are going to fight for your &quot;Liberty&quot;, but I have none to fight for.&quot;{ William offered Prince his freedom if he continued his military service. Prince agreed and by the end of the war, William ended Prince&#x27;s servitude and granted his freedom. According to the Portsmouth, New Hampshire Town Records,

At Saratoga, Whipple commanded a brigade of four militia regiments. Whipple commanded Bellow&#x27;s regiment, Chase&#x27;s regiment, Moore&#x27;s regiment, and Welch&#x27;s regiment. As a result of their meritorious conduct at the Battle of Saratoga, Whipple and Colonel James Wilkinson were then chosen by Major General Horatio Gates to determine terms of capitulation with two representatives of General John Burgoyne. Whipple then signed the Convention of Saratoga, the effective surrender of General Burgoyne and his troops.

Whipple was then appointed along with several other officers to escort Burgoyne and his army back to Winter Hill, Somerville, Massachusetts. Whipple passed the news of the victory at Saratoga to Captain John Paul Jones, who informed Benjamin Franklin, who was in Paris at the time. News of the victory proved valuable to Franklin throughout alliance negotiations with the French. In 1778, Whipple followed his commanding officer, General John Sullivan to the Battle of Rhode Island, where he commanded Evans&#x27; regiment, Peabody&#x27;s regiment, and Langdon&#x27;s light horse regiment. After General Sullivan ordered a retreat, Whipple and other officers resided in a house near the battlefield. The approaching enemy fired a field piece from a range of three-quarters of a mile. The shot tore through a horse lashed outside the house and severely wounded the leg of one of Whipple&#x27;s brigade majors, which later required amputation.

== Death ==

After the war, Whipple became an associate justice of the Superior Court of New Hampshire. On November 28, 1785, he suffered from a heart ailment and died after fainting from atop his horse while traveling his court circuit. He was buried in what is now the North Cemetery in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. His headstone was replaced with a new memorial in 1976 in conjunction with the United States Bicentennial.

<doc id="261191" wikidata="Q1397321" url="?curid=261191" title="George Wythe">
<text>George Wythe (; 1726 – June 8, 1806) was an American academic, scholar, and judge who was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. The first of the seven signatories of the United States Declaration of Independence from Virginia, Wythe served as one of Virginia&#x27;s representatives to the Continental Congress and the Philadelphia Convention and served on a committee that established the convention&#x27;s rules and procedures. He left the convention before signing the United States Constitution to tend to his dying wife. He was elected to the Virginia Ratifying Convention and helped ensure that his home state ratified the Constitution. Wythe taught and was a mentor to Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, Henry Clay and other men who became American leaders.

Born into a wealthy Virginia planter family, Wythe established a legal career in Williamsburg, Virginia, after studying under his uncle. He became a member of the House of Burgesses in 1754 and helped oversee defense expenditures during the French and Indian War. He opposed the Stamp Act of 1765 and other British taxes imposed on the Thirteen Colonies. He was also a delegate to Virginia&#x27;s 1776 constitutional convention and helped design the Seal of Virginia. Wythe served as a judge for much of his life, first as a justice of the peace and then on the Virginia Court of Chancery. He was also a prominent law professor at the College of William &amp; Mary and took on several notable apprentices. He remained remarkably close to Jefferson and left Jefferson his substantial book collection in his will. Wythe became increasingly troubled by slavery and emancipated all of the people he had enslaved at the end of the American Revolution. Wythe died in 1806, apparently from poisoning, and his grand-nephew George Sweeny was tried and acquitted for Wythe&#x27;s murder.

==Early life and education==

Wythe was born in 1726 at Chesterville, the plantation operated by three generations of the Wythe family in what was then Elizabeth City County but is now Hampton, Virginia. His maternal great-grandfather was George Keith, a Quaker minister and early opponent of slavery, who returned to the Church of England but was sent back as a missionary to the East Coast before ultimately returning to England. His mother, Margaret Walker of Kecoughtan, a learned woman probably raised as a Quaker, instilled a love of learning in her son. In his later years, Wythe became known for his outdated Quaker dress and gentle manner, which could cause even a surly dog to &quot;unbend and wag his tail.&quot; After the early death of his father, Wythe probably attended grammar school in Williamsburg before beginning legal training in the office of his uncle, Stephen Dewey, in Prince George County.

George Wythe first married on December 26, 1747, when he was a 21-year-old county lawyer in western Virginia, to Ann Lewis, daughter of Zachary Lewis, his law partner in Spotsylvania County. Devastated after Ann Lewis Wythe died on August 8, 1748, George Wythe returned home to Chesterville and accepted a position as clerk in the House of Burgesses in Williamsburg.

Six years later, after being elected to the House of Burgesses, he married Elizabeth Taliaferro of Williamsburg. George and Elizabeth Wythe had one child who died in infancy. Elizabeth died after 32 years of marriage on August 18, 1787. During his marriage to Elizabeth, George Wythe showed an interest in genealogy, asking Thomas Jefferson for his help in researching the lineage of the Taliaferro family while Jefferson was in Paris and Italy.
==Career==
Wythe was admitted to the bar in Elizabeth City County in 1746, the same year his mother died. He then moved to Spotsylvania County to begin legal practice in several Piedmont counties. In 1747, he married Ann Lewis, the daughter of his mentor Zachary Lewis. However, his wife died on August 10, 1748. The childless and bereaved widower returned to Williamsburg; there, Wythe made law and scholarship his life as he began a distinguished career in public service. His motto was &quot;Secundis dubiisque rectus&quot;, translated as &quot;Upright in prosperity and perils.&quot;

===Colonial politician and mentor===

In October 1748, family connections (Benjamin Waller was related to Zachary Lewis) probably helped Wythe secure his first government job as clerk to two powerful committees of the House of Burgesses, Privileges and Elections and Propositions and Grievances. Wythe also continued to practice law before those committees and the General Court in Williamsburg, as was permitted at the time. In 1750, Wythe was first elected as one of Williamsburg&#x27;s aldermen. Wythe also briefly served as the king&#x27;s attorney general in 1754–1755, appointed by Lieutenant Governor Robert Dinwiddie while Peyton Randolph traveled to London on the burgesses&#x27; behalf to appeal Dinwiddie&#x27;s charging a one pistole fee to affix an official seal to land patents. Wythe resigned when Randolph returned from his unsuccessful mission. Dinwiddie returned to England less than three years after Randolph&#x27;s return.

In the session of August 22, 1754, Wythe replaced the deceased Armistead Burwell as the burgess representing Williamsburg. In 1755, Wythe&#x27;s elder brother, Thomas, died childless. Wythe inherited the family&#x27;s Chesterville plantation and was appointed to his brother&#x27;s (formerly his father&#x27;s) place on the Elizabeth City County court. Wythe probably continued to live in Williamsburg, for his legislative work continued, and he married Elizabeth Taliaferro. Her father, planter Richard Taliaferro, built a house for them in Williamsburg which is called the Wythe House even though Wythe only had a life estate in the property after Taliaferro&#x27;s death.

Wythe served as Williamsburg&#x27;s delegate through the sessions of 1754 and 1755 (but not in the sessions of the Assembly of 1756–1758). During that gap, Wythe was reappointed clerk to the committees on Privileges and Elections and Propositions and Grievances, as well as to the Committee for Courts of Justice, and in 1759 to the Committee of Correspondence (with the colony&#x27;s agent in England). In 1759, the College of William &amp; Mary elected Wythe as its burgess to replace Peyton Randolph and reelected Wythe in 1760 and 1761. Wythe helped oversee defense expenditures related to the French and Indian War. For the Assemblies of 1761, 1765, and 1767, Wythe was one of the two burgesses representing Elizabeth City County.

Although known for his modesty and quiet dignity, Wythe eventually gained a radical reputation for his opposition to the Stamp Act of 1765 and later attempts by the British government to regulate the overseas colony. Meanwhile, Wythe maintained close friendships with successive Governors Francis Fauquier and Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt. Wythe also earned a reputation for personal integrity, which years later led Rev. Lee Massey to call Wythe &quot;the only honest lawyer I ever knew.&quot; Fauquier, Wythe, and college professor William Small often socialized together—conversing about philosophy, natural history, languages, history, and other matters. In 1762, Small suggested Wythe supervise the legal training of a star student, Thomas Jefferson, which had a profound impact beyond their lives.

=== Law practice ===
In the summer of 1766, three events occurred that profoundly influenced Wythe, Jefferson, and several other Virginians who became Founding Fathers and insisted upon the separation of powers between three branches of the new government. When John Robinson, the powerful speaker of the House of Burgesses, died, his estate was nearly insolvent (with many debts, as well as outstanding loans), and the accounts Robinson kept as treasurer were irregular. Instead of destroying redeemed paper currency after the French and Indian War, Robinson lent it to his political supporters (fellow southern Virginia planters). Keeping the money in circulation helped these allies pay their debts but also tended to devalue the currency and defy the redemption laws the legislature had passed. Robinson&#x27;s executors kept the names of the politically powerful loan beneficiaries secret for decades but did not manage to end the John Robinson estate scandal.

On June 20, 1766, Colonel John Chiswell (father of Robinson&#x27;s widow and business partner of Robinson), Governor Fauquier, and William Byrd III killed merchant Robert Routledge (to whom he owed money) at the Cumberland Court House. Indicted for murder, Chiswell was brought under armed guard to Williamsburg for trial in the next session of the General Court (which included many men from distant counties who also served as Burgesses and was thus usually held at the same time). Before the group reached the Williamsburg jail, three judges (John Blair, Presley Thornton, and Byrd) stopped them on the street and allowed Chiswell to post bail until September, since the next court session began in October.

Meanwhile, the publisher of the &quot;Virginia Gazette&quot; had died. Two printers set up shops in Williamsburg when it became clear in the spring of 1766 that the Stamp Act would not be enforced. Both papers thrived in the ensuing controversies. On July 4, Judge Blair explained in a published letter that the judges had relied upon assurances of &quot;three eminent Lawyers&quot; that they could grant Chiswell bail, as well as two depositions that Routledge had run himself on Chiswell&#x27;s sword while stressing that the high bail of 6,000 pounds sterling could be recovered should Chiswell fail to show for trial. In response, &#x27;Dikephilos&#x27; wrote that his investigation agreed that Routledge had been drunk, but Chiswell was not, and further that neither deponent favoring Chiswell had witnessed the brawl. He predicted widespread violence if the trial unfairly favored the aristocratic defendant. More published letters followed.

On August 1, Wythe identified himself in print as one of the consulted lawyers and said his opinion had been limited to the legal bail issue. After Chiswell returned to Williamsburg in September, his attorney John Wayles published the two depositions given to the judges from Wayles himself and the Cumberland undersheriff. Judge Blair was furious when Wayles added a detail to the published copy of his deposition (which he had gotten from the court records) to track the undersheriff&#x27;s deposition. On the other hand, Judge Byrd joined with Wayles to demand a libel indictment against Col. Robert Bolling, Jr., claiming Bolling wrote the anonymous criticism of the bailment published on July 11. The grand jury refused, issuing a no-bill instead. However, Wythe&#x27;s sterling reputation may have been tarnished. When the assembly reconvened, Robert Carter Nicholas was appointed treasurer, Peyton Randolph became speaker, and his brother John Randolph became king&#x27;s attorney general, a post to which Wythe had aspired. Chiswell died unexpectedly in his Williamsburg home on October 15 before his trial could begin. Jefferson, decades later in his Kentucky Resolution, echoed the anonymous &#x27;Virginia Gazette&#x27; writer of September 12, 1766, who stated, &quot;Distrust, the parent of security, is a political virtue of unspeakable utility.&quot;

Wythe continued his thriving legal practice with Jefferson&#x27;s assistance. In 1767, Wythe introduced Jefferson to the bar of the General Court, and Jefferson was appointed clerk to the House of Burgesses. The following year, Wythe wrote the colony&#x27;s London agent to secure copies of the burgesses&#x27; complete journals from the colony&#x27;s founding until 1752, which were supposed to be transmitted annually to the king, secretary of state, and Lords of Trade, stressing &quot;it be not made public nor attended with great expense.&quot; The secrecy may have related to continuing unrest in Massachusetts against the Townshend Acts or the administrative interregnum between Fauquier&#x27;s death in March and Botetourt&#x27;s arrival in October. Wythe also ordered printed journals of the House of Commons and case law books from London. Wythe&#x27;s social standing remained high, for fellow aldermen elected him Williamsburg&#x27;s mayor for the 1768 to 1769 term. Fellow parishioners also elected Wythe to the vestry of Bruton Parish Church in 1769.

Botetourt arrived on October 26, 1768, as Virginia&#x27;s first governor to rule the colony in person in sixty years. Although Botetourt dissolved the House of Burgesses the following spring, following a royal order to all colonial governors after protests in Massachusetts against the Townshend Acts, Wythe managed to stave off the governor&#x27;s clerk so the delegates could publish a resolution of protest before receiving the dissolution order. The burgesses then repaired to the Raleigh Tavern, where they passed the Virginia Nonimportation Resolutions on May 18, 1769. Some speculate that Wythe&#x27;s status as clerk kept his name off that document. In any event, the burgesses held a spectacular party for Botetourt that Christmas and his funeral ceremonies the following fall were the most elaborate in Virginia&#x27;s history. They also voted for a marble statue of the governor to be erected at public expense.

===Revolution===
The next royal governor, John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, brought Wythe and Virginia to the brink of revolution. Dunmore arrived in Williamsburg from New York on September 26, 1771. Rumors of his rule as New York&#x27;s governor, which included accusations of graft and companions roughing up local judges, soon followed. Although some cheered his military offensive against the Indians (later known as Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War) as strengthening Virginia&#x27;s land claims, Wythe, Jefferson, and many others took offense at Dunmore&#x27;s haughty personality. Dunmore attempted to govern without the burgesses, but counterfeiting and other money troubles forced him to convene the assembly in early 1773. Delegates began by voicing concerns that suspects who burned the revenue vessel &quot;Gaspee&quot; in Rhode Island could be tried in England. When on March 3, 1773, they resolved to establish a Committee of Correspondence, Dunmore prorogued (postponed) the assembly. Moreover, Parliament passed the Tea Act in May 1773, and on December 16, the Sons of Liberty instigated the Boston Tea Party. Dunmore tried to reconvene the delegates the following May. On May 24, 1774, the House of Burgesses passed a resolution declaring June 1 as a day of fasting and prayer, which resolution Wythe signed and posted. Enraged, Dunmore dissolved the assembly. The delegates moved to conduct their business at the Raleigh Tavern and met again in mid-March in Richmond.

Wythe attended the Second Virginia Convention as Williamsburg&#x27;s representative. The meeting was held in St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church. Patrick Henry stirred the delegates with his &quot;Give me liberty or give me death!&quot; speech. The delegates agreed to convene militia, and the prospect of armed resistance caused Dunmore to try to remove gunpowder stores from Williamsburg to Royal Navy ships stationed offshore. Wythe enlisted in the militia immediately upon returning home. In the Gunpowder Incident of April 20, 1775, Peyton Randolph, Robert Carter Nicholas, and Carter Braxton helped defuse Henry&#x27;s attempt to force the return of the gunpowder by negotiating payment from Dunmore.

On May 10, 1775, the Second Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia. When war seemed inevitable, Wythe was elected as Virginia&#x27;s delegate to replace George Washington, who took command of the Continental Army. George and Elizabeth Wythe moved to Philadelphia by September and were inoculated against smallpox, as were fellow delegate Francis Lightfoot Lee and his lady and others. By October, Jefferson had rejoined the Congress to work with his former teacher and the other delegates, although personal tragedy forced him to leave for five months in the winter and spring. Wythe accepted many assignments relating to the military, currency, and other matters. He, John Dickinson and John Jay also went to New Jersey that winter and convinced that colony&#x27;s assembly to maintain a united front.

When petitions and other attempts failed to resolve the crisis by the following summer while Dunmore&#x27;s raiders harassed Virginia settlements from its waterways, Wythe moved and then voted in favor of the resolution for independence that Jefferson had drafted upon his return. His fellow Virginia delegates in Philadelphia held Wythe in such esteem that they left the first space open for him when they signed the Declaration of Independence. Moreover, John Adams, who did not like many Virginians, thought so highly of Wythe that he wrote &quot;Thoughts on Government&quot; concerning the establishment of postwar constitutions for state governments. Earlier in the session, Wythe had also exchanged humorous verses with his friend and delegate William Ellery of Rhode Island despite their political differences. Wythe thus signed the Declaration of Independence upon his return to Philadelphia in September. The signers&#x27; names were not made public until the following January, for all knew the declaration was an act of treason, punishable by death, should their rebellion fail.

During the war, Virginia became a battleground between Patriot and Loyalist forces. The farmer to whom he had leased Chesterville, Hamilton Usher St. George, was secretly a Loyalist, though he was acquitted of charges of being a British spy on April 23, 1776. St. George supported British raiding parties based in Portsmouth, which targeted local plantations as well as Williamsburg and other colonial settlements along the James River in raids such as the skirmish at Waters Creek. In January 1781, Benedict Arnold led 1,600 American Legion troops, which forced Jefferson to flee Richmond and burned the fledgling state capital, destroying many colonial records. Just weeks earlier, on New Year&#x27;s Eve, Wythe had reportedly helped scare another British raiding party back to their ship. Finally, four boatloads of neighbors attacked St. George at his house on Hog Island on September 21, 1781, forcing him to flee to Chesterville, then to New York, and ultimately to England. Chesterville sustained damage before Wythe evicted Mrs. St. George to move into the house with Elizabeth while French troops occupied their Williamsburg home. During the Yorktown campaign which led to General Charles Cornwallis&#x27; surrender, American and French troops camped at Williamsburg, and Count Rochambeau occupied the George Wythe house. On December 21, 1781, a fire burned down the Governor&#x27;s Palace and also destroyed a wing of the college, which included Wythe&#x27;s beloved library and physics instruments.

===Founding Father===
Hurrying back to Virginia from Philadelphia, on June 23, 1776, Wythe began helping Virginia establish its new state government. Virginia&#x27;s constitutional convention had begun months earlier (and had voted on May 15 to instruct its federal delegates to move toward a declaration of independence). Despite his late arrival, Wythe served on a committee with George Mason, which jointly designed the Seal of Virginia, inscribed with the motto &quot;Sic Semper Tyrannis&quot;, which remains in use today. The reverse side shows three Roman goddesses, Libertas surrounded by Ceres and Aeternitas.

Wythe&#x27;s most noteworthy contributions in establishing the new state government began when he again returned from Philadelphia that winter. Wythe served on a committee with Jefferson and Edmund Pendleton to revise and codify its laws and helped establish the new state court system. Although few of their more than 100 proposed bills were passed, some concepts, such as religious freedom, public records access, and public education, became important in the new republic, as did the idea of intermediate appellate courts. When a fall incapacitated Pendleton, Jefferson and Wythe redrafted his portion (much to Pendleton&#x27;s dismay). Wythe also replaced Pendleton as speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates the following term (1777–1778).

Wythe also continued working to establish the new nation. In 1787, Wythe became one of Virginia&#x27;s delegates to the Constitutional Convention. Fellow delegate William Pierce considered Wythe &quot;one of the most learned legal Characters of the present age&quot; and known for his &quot;exemplary life,&quot; but &quot;no great politician&quot; because he had &quot;too favorable opinion of Men.&quot; In any event, Wythe, Alexander Hamilton, and Charles Pinckney served on the committee that established the convention&#x27;s rules and procedures. However, Wythe left Philadelphia in early June to tend to his ailing wife. The following year, York County neighbors elected Wythe and John Blair to represent them at the Virginia Ratifying Convention. As Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, Wythe presided over oft-heated exchanges until the final day. Stepping down from the chair, Wythe spoke to urge ratification. Pendleton later wrote Wythe&#x27;s &quot;adherence to the Constitution&quot; gave the margin for ratification when otherwise would have proven &quot;grave for the Union.&quot;

===Teacher===
Wythe&#x27;s teaching career began with his appointment in 1761 to the Board of Visitors of the College of William &amp; Mary. It often overlapped and drew upon his legal and judicial careers. For more than twenty years, Wythe taught many legal apprentices, as well as students at the college. Among the most famous were future presidents Jefferson and James Monroe; future senators Henry Clay, Littleton Waller Tazewell and John Breckinridge; future Virginia judges St. George Tucker and Spencer Roane; future Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John Marshall; and future Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Bushrod Washington. Proficient in Latin and Greek, as well as known for his devotion to books and learning, Wythe initially taught students on a near-individual apprenticeship basis. Especially after Elizabeth died in 1787, some private pupils boarded at Wythe&#x27;s home and received daily instruction in classical languages, political philosophy, and law. Of all these men, Wythe remained closest to Jefferson, with whom he worked and corresponded many times in the ensuing decades. In their friendship, the two men read all sorts of other material, from English literary works to political philosophy to the ancient sages.

In 1779, Governor Jefferson appointed Wythe to the newly created Chair of Law and Police, making Wythe the first law professor in the United States. As a law professor, Wythe introduced a lecture system based on the Commentaries published by William Blackstone, as well as Matthew Bacon&#x27;s New Abridgement of the Law, and Acts of Virginia&#x27;s Assembly. Wythe also developed experiential tools, including moot courts and mock legislative sessions, which are still used today. However, apprenticeship remained the main mode of learning law in that era, followed by examination before several practicing lawyers. Thus, Marshall and Monroe attended Wythe&#x27;s lectures for a time and affiliated themselves with more experienced lawyers before being admitted to the bar. The college suspended classes during the later days of the Revolutionary War, after which Wythe taught in Williamsburg and performed his duties as judge (mostly in Richmond as the new capital) until the 1788–1789 term. Wythe then resigned from the college and announced that he planned to move to Richmond to concentrate on his judicial duties. Travel to the new capital for the four judicial sessions each year may have become onerous; many of Wythe&#x27;s friends and colleagues had died or moved, and Williamsburg&#x27;s intellectual and cultural life had also declined after the state capital moved upriver. Litigation involving professor Rev. John Bracken also distressed Wythe.

In Richmond, Wythe continued his pursuit of knowledge and even began learning Hebrew from Rabbi Seixas. One of Wythe&#x27;s last pupils, William Munford, called Wythe &quot;one of the most remarkable men I ever knew&quot; and particularly remembered Wythe&#x27;s scholarly philosophy, &quot;Don&#x27;t skim it; read deeply, and ponder what you read; they begin to make lawyers now without the &#x27;biginti annorum lucubrationes&#x27; (twenty years of reflection) of Lord Coke; they are mere skimmers of the law, and know little else.&quot; St. George Tucker, his one-time student and fellow judge, succeeded Wythe as the college&#x27;s law professor. He published an annotated edition of Blackstone&#x27;s work before resigning in 1804 to succeed Edmund Pendleton on Virginia&#x27;s Supreme Court of Appeals. In 1920, the college (now a university) established a law school named after Wythe and Marshall.

===Virginia judge===

Although Wythe served as what would now be called a justice of the peace in Elizabeth City County during colonial times, his reputation as the &quot;American Aristides&quot; derived from Wythe&#x27;s judicial service after Virginia became a state and his scholarship discussed above. The oath Wythe drafted for its admiralty judges indicates his judicial philosophy, &quot;You shall swear that ... you will do equal right to all manner of people, great and small, high and low, rich and poor, according to equity and good conscience, and the laws and usages of Virginia, without respect to persons. ... And, finally, in all things belonging to your said office, during your continuance therein you shall faithfully, justly and truly, according to the best of your skill and judgment, do equal and impartial justice, without fraud, favor or affection, or partiality.&quot; Wythe also designed the chancery court seal to illustrate the punishment of the Persian judge Sisamnes, killed and skinned after taking a bribe.

In 1777, Wythe became one of the three judges on the newly-formed High Court of Chancery. Administering equity and developing that branch of the law became his mission for the rest of his life. Wythe was elected to serve as a federal judge on the Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture in 1780, but he declined to serve. Wythe particularly despised lawyers who protracted litigation at great cost to the parties, though to their benefit, and even in his last days, he regretted the burden delays placed upon those seeking justice from his court. In the judicial reorganization of 1788, Wythe became sole judge of the Chancery Court of Virginia, refusing to be promoted with Edmund Pendleton to the Supreme Court of Appeals (now known as the Virginia Supreme Court). Both men refused offers from President George Washington of judgeships on the new federal courts. However, their colleague John Blair accepted an appointment to the United States Supreme Court. In 1802, the legislature created two more territorial Chancery Courts, but Wythe remained in Richmond.

In the 1782 &quot;Commonwealth v. Caton&quot; opinion, Wythe upheld judicial review of legislative actions, in what became a predecessor to Justice Marshall&#x27;s decision in Marbury v. Madison. After Virginia courts had convicted Caton and two other men of treason, they appealed to the legislature for pardons. The House of Delegates approved their pardon request, but the state Senate refused. Wythe decided that the court had the right to review that pardon and that the judiciary was obliged to &quot;say to them, here is the limit of your authority; and hither, shall you go, but no further.&quot; Pendleton and Blair agreed with this principle of judicial review, although on slightly different grounds. Nonetheless, after the decision, both legislative houses pardoned the men, sparing them execution.

However, Chancellor Wythe&#x27;s decisions were often modified or overruled, particularly by the appeals court that his former student Spencer Roane joined in 1794. In 1795, Wythe published analyses of some of his cases and subsequent appellate decisions and added more pamphlets later. Although this publication offended Pendleton, he decided against replying in kind. One of Wythe&#x27;s most famous decisions (unpopular at the time), &quot;Page v. Pendleton,&quot; upheld the authority of the 1783 federal peace treaty with Great Britain, which required debts to British merchants be paid under the contract terms. However, Virginia passed a law allowing payment in depreciated paper currency.

In &quot;Roane v. Innes,&quot; Wythe upheld Revolutionary War soldiers&#x27; pension claims but was reversed. Pendleton died in 1803, just before he could deliver an opinion attempting to reverse Wythe in &quot;Turpin v. Lockett,&quot; which dealt with selling the disestablished church&#x27;s glebe lands, nominally at least to support the poor.

==Views on slavery==
Wythe grew more anti-slavery as time went on and emancipated all of the people he enslaved at the end of the American Revolution. The problem of slavery preoccupied Wythe in his last years. In 1785, Jefferson assured Welsh abolitionist Richard Price that Wythe&#x27;s sentiments against slavery were unequivocal. During the first two decades after the war, so many Virginians freed enslaved people that free blacks in the state had risen from less than 1 percent of the population to nearly 10 percent by 1810. However, the era also saw the development of increasingly harsh slave laws, particularly as enslavers feared rebellions similar to the Haitian Revolution, which began in 1791. Tensions increased in 1793 when 137 vessels from Haiti bearing French refugees and people they enslaved arrived in Richmond. Marshall and other prominent citizens wrote to Governor Henry Lee III about slave rebellion rumors and a white militia armed itself.

Six ships carrying between 500 and 1,000 black Catholic refugees, some free and wealthy and others enslaved, arrived in Baltimore in July 1791 and/or June 1793 after unsuccessful stops in Charleston, South Carolina and Norfolk, Virginia. Successively led by Sulpician priests who were fleeing the French Revolution and later by Redemptorists and Jesuits, the black Catholics worshipped in the basement of St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary, then the basement chapel of St. Ignatius Church (renamed for St. Peter Claver) before they eventually formed America&#x27;s first black parish, St. Francis Xavier Church (Baltimore, Maryland) during the Civil War era. Josephite priests became associated with the parish a decade later, and the parish moved in 1932 and 1968. The invention of the cotton gin in 1794 made cotton production using slave labor particularly profitable in the lower south, and those planters imported enslaved people from Maryland and Virginia, especially when importing enslaved people from Africa and Britain&#x27;s Caribbean colonies became illegal and difficult.

In 1798, Virginian legislators forbade members of slave emancipation societies from serving on juries involving slave freedom suits. This prohibition probably affected Wythe as a judge in such cases and led the Virginia Abolition Society to all but disappear that year. In 1800 Governor James Monroe called out troops that crushed the rebellion led by Gabriel Prosser near Richmond, and 35 enslaved people were executed. Further rumors of slave insurrections led to alarms and executions, sometimes without judicial process, in 1802 and 1803. Also, in the legislative session that began in the spring of 1806, the year of Wythe&#x27;s death, a law was passed requiring formerly enslaved people to leave the state within 12 months. However, a later modification allowed local courts to allow certain manumitted enslaved people to remain.

===Manumissions===
When Wythe&#x27;s wife Elizabeth died on August 18, 1787, Wythe returned some enslaved people whom her father had bequeathed to Elizabeth to her remaining relatives. Wythe filed manumission papers for his long-time housemaid and cook Lydia Broadnax on August 20, 1787, two days after Elizabeth&#x27;s death. Four years later, Lydia accompanied Wythe as he moved to Richmond, where he had previously commuted four times yearly to handle the Chancery Court business. In addition, a young mixed-race youth, Michael Brown, born free in 1790, lived in Wythe&#x27;s household. By 1797 Broadnax owned her own home, where she and Brown lived and took in boarders. Wythe had taken an interest in Brown, taught him Greek, and shared his library with him. On January 29, 1797, Wythe also freed Benjamin, another enslaved adult who continued to work as his servant in Richmond; Wythe named Benjamin a beneficiary in his 1803 will, which included money for Brown&#x27;s continued education.

Fawn M. Brodie, who linked Jefferson and Sally Hemings, suggests that Broadnax was Wythe&#x27;s concubine and Brown was their son. Wythe&#x27;s biographer Imogene Brown notes that Brown&#x27;s last name and Broadnax&#x27;s age made this unlikely. Philip D. Morgan notes that there had been no documented gossip about Wythe and Broadnax at the time, unlike the case of Jefferson and Hemings, covered by newspapers and in individuals&#x27; letters and diaries.

===Judicial decisions===
Wythe, for years, followed Virginia precedent (including the 1768 case &quot;Blackwell v. Wilkinson&quot;) as he adjudicated chancery cases treating enslaved people as property. Slavery matters often went to chancery because there were no legal remedies. Virginia slave laws also became more severe as Richmond&#x27;s importance as a slave trading center for points further south continued to increase, and French planters from what became Haiti came to Virginia with thousands of enslaved people. Wythe authored two legal opinions that attempted to steer Virginia away from the slave-based legal and economic system entrenched in the early 19th century.

Wythe and Pendleton sat on the chancery court bench, which granted freedom to enslaved people in &quot;Pleasants v. Pleasants.&quot; However, that decision was appealed, and in 1799, after Virginia passed a law forbidding abolitionists from serving on juries in freedom suits, Wythe&#x27;s decision was modified by the appellate court led by Pendleton and Roane, both former students of Wythe. This case concerned a Quaker&#x27;s 1771 will, which purported to free enslaved people before Wythe and Jefferson drafted the 1782 law, which legalized manumission in Virginia. Robert Pleasants and some of his siblings had freed about 100 enslaved people as his late father had requested after manumission became legal and they turned 30 years old, as the will specified. Pleasants also lobbied extensively for manumission laws and founded the Virginia Abolition Society in 1790. Marshall and John Warden represented the enslaved people seeking their freedom, and Pleasants as the executor of his father&#x27;s will, as they jointly sued the siblings who failed to obey the testamentary instruction. Each justice on the Court of Appeals in &quot;Pleasants v. Pleasants&quot; agreed with Wythe that the will could be enforced and called the enslaved people free. However, none of the justices (all enslavers) thought Wythe&#x27;s grant of backpay proper, and they all agreed that children borne to enslaved parents would not gain their freedom until they repaid their enslavers&#x27; expenses in raising them, which in the intervening decades became quite large. Thus, although John Pleasants died enslaving over 530 people, fewer than a quarter received their freedom.

In one of Wythe&#x27;s last cases, &quot;Hudgins v. Wright&quot; (1806), Wythe &quot;singlehandedly tried to abolish slavery by judicial interpretation,&quot; according to Paul Finkelman. Jackey Wright, an enslaved person, sued Houlder Hudgins (who, incidentally, had purchased Chesterville from Wythe) for freedom for herself and her two children. Wright based her claim on her descent from American Indians, including a woman named Butterwood Nan. Indians were considered free in Virginia by this time. Wythe ruled in favor of Wright on two grounds. He examined the women and noted that all three generations of the family showed only Indian and white ancestry, with no evidence of African ancestry. Because Hudgins did not provide definite proof of Wright&#x27;s descent from a slave mother, Wythe considered Wright and her children &quot;presumptively free&quot;. Alternatively, Wythe held that &quot;all men were presumptively free in Virginia in consequence of the 1776 Declaration of Rights.&quot; This was similar to a contemporary ruling in &quot;Brom and Bett v. Ashley&quot;, which held that Massachusetts&#x27; Constitution upheld freedom for all men.

When Hudgins appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court after Wythe&#x27;s murder, all judges unanimously affirmed Wythe&#x27;s decision, allowing Wright freedom, but only on limited grounds. Wythe&#x27;s former student St. George Tucker affirmed Wythe&#x27;s ruling only on the particular and limited nature of Indian enslavement in the state. The other extensive opinion in the case was by Judge Spencer Roane, another former student of Wythe, who contrasted the presumption of freedom for Indians and condemned Hudgins for failing to introduce evidence of any black ancestry of those seeking their freedom. Thus, all the appellate judges held that the two-decades-old Declaration of Rights did not apply to blacks. Although Tucker (an enslaver) rejected this judicial route to freedom, he had written in favor of emancipation. He continued to fight for emancipation in other political venues.

==Death scandal==

By 1805, a grandson of Wythe&#x27;s sister, 17-year-old George Wythe Sweeney, had come to live with his elderly namesake. The following spring, Wythe realized Sweeney had stolen some of his books, probably to repay gambling debts and support a dissolute lifestyle. Wythe also revised his will in early 1806 because Thomas Jefferson had agreed to educate the young mulatto Brown, although those new provisions would have no effect if Brown died before Sweeney, as happened.

On May 25, 1806, Wythe, Broadnax, and Brown all became violently ill. Richmond&#x27;s leading doctors, Wythe&#x27;s old friend James McClurg, James McCaw, and his physician William Foushee at first suspected cholera, dismissing Wythe&#x27;s claims of being poisoned. Two days later, Sweeney tried to cash a $100 check drawn on Wythe&#x27;s account, which the bank found suspicious because Wythe&#x27;s illness had become news throughout the city. The bank retrieved several earlier checks, which Wythe had previously denied signing. Gravely ill but still trying to work on legal matters, Wythe refused to post bail for Sweeney, who was jailed. Upon hearing that Brown had died on June 1, Wythe signed a codicil to his will drafted by Edmund Randolph that disinherited George Sweeney in favor of Charles, Jane, and Ann Sweeney. Wythe also told the doctors, &quot;Cut me.&quot; Although McClurg often used bloodletting, the doctors agreed that Wythe called for an autopsy after his death. Oddly, Houlder Hudgins was an administrator for at least two siblings, who became Wythe&#x27;s heirs.

Broadnax recovered (although she ultimately suffered the effects for the rest of her life and received some support from Jefferson). Broadnax told many people she had seen Sweeney put a powder in their morning coffee. Other black witnesses saw Sweeney drop paper from the jail, which appeared to contain rat poison. However, both trial judges agreed that Virginia race laws prohibited blacks from testifying at the trial.

Wythe died on June 8, 1806, and Sweeney was charged with poisoning Wythe and Brown with arsenic. Prominent attorneys William Wirt and Edmund Randolph defended Sweeney. The prosecutor was Philip Norborne Nicholas, Randolph&#x27;s son-in-law. Early on, the judges quashed the murder charge relating to Brown because of his race. A jury acquitted Sweeney of Wythe&#x27;s murder. Some attributed the verdict to the botched autopsy (which failed to use well-known tests for arsenic), and equivocal testimony by the physicians. Others blamed Virginia law, which since 1732 forbade testimony by black witnesses, whether free or enslaved. In a separate trial for check forgery, Sweeney was convicted. However, that conviction was overruled on appeal based on a technicality in the forgery law that Wythe and Jefferson had drafted years earlier (recognizing the crime only against individual victims, not against corporations such as the bank). Sweeney left for Tennessee. There, he reportedly was later convicted and jailed for stealing a horse. Afterward, he disappeared in history.

==Legacy and honors==

In 1790, Wythe received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the College of William &amp; Mary. In his will, Wythe left his large book collection to Thomas Jefferson. This was part of the collection that Jefferson later sold to create the Library of Congress. Jefferson praised Wythe as &quot;my ancient master, my earliest and best friend, and to him I am indebted for first impressions which have [been] the most salutary on the course of my life.&quot; However, Jefferson later refused an offer of Wythe&#x27;s lecture notes and other legal papers, believing they should go instead to what became the Library of Virginia. Last reported either in the possession of Spencer Roane (who burned many papers before his death) or his ally Thomas Ritchie (publisher of the &quot;Richmond Enquirer&quot;), they were reported lost by the 1830s. Jefferson&#x27;s grandson George Wythe Randolph, who became the secretary of war of the Confederate States of America, was named after Wythe.

Places associated with Wythe remain preserved today, and over the centuries, other places have been named in his honor:
* Wythe&#x27;s home in Williamsburg, Virginia, stands next to Bruton Parish Church, of which Wythe was a vestryman. His house was acquired by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation in 1938. Today, it is operated as a museum, the Wythe House.
* Several places in Virginia were named for him: Wythe County, Virginia, its county seat Wytheville; the Wythe district and neighborhood, including the Olde Wythe Historic District in Hampton, a section of US-301 named Wythe Street in Petersburg; Wythe Avenue in Richmond.
* Several public schools in Virginia were also named for him: high schools in Wytheville and Richmond; a former junior high school and former elementary school in Hampton.
* The Marshall-Wythe School of Law at the College of William &amp; Mary.
* George Wythe University in Salt Lake City, Utah.
* George Wythe Hotel in Wytheville.
* The World War II Liberty Ship .

Those involved in MIR may have a background in academic musicology, psychoacoustics, psychology, signal processing, informatics, machine learning, optical music recognition, computational intelligence, or some combination of these.

== Applications ==
Music information retrieval is being used by businesses and academics to categorize, manipulate and even create music.

=== Music classification ===
One of the classical MIR research topics is genre classification, which is categorizing music items into one of the pre-defined genres such as classical, jazz, rock, etc. Mood classification, artist classification, instrument identification, and music tagging are also popular topics. 

=== Recommender systems ===
Several recommender systems for music already exist, but surprisingly few are based upon MIR techniques, instead of making use of similarity between users or laborious data compilation. Pandora, for example, uses experts to tag the music with particular qualities such as &quot;female singer&quot; or &quot;strong bassline&quot;. Many other systems find users whose listening history is similar and suggests unheard music to the users from their respective collections. MIR techniques for similarity in music are now beginning to form part of such systems.

=== Music source separation and instrument recognition ===
Music source separation is about separating original signals from a mixture audio signal. Instrument recognition is about identifying the instruments involved in music. Various MIR systems have been developed that can separate music into its component tracks without access to the master copy. In this way, for example, karaoke tracks can be created from normal music tracks, though the process is not yet perfect owing to vocals occupying some of the same frequency space as the other instruments.

===Automatic music transcription===
Automatic music transcription is the process of converting an audio recording into symbolic notation, such as a score or a MIDI file. This process involves several audio analysis tasks, which may include multi-pitch detection, onset detection, duration estimation, instrument identification, and the extraction of harmonic, rhythmic or melodic information. This task becomes more difficult with greater numbers of instruments and a greater polyphony level.

===Music generation===
The automatic generation of music is a goal held by many MIR researchers. Attempts have been made with limited success in terms of human appreciation of the results.

==Methods used==

===Data source===
Scores give a clear and logical description of music from which to work, but access to sheet music, whether digital or otherwise, is often impractical. MIDI music has also been used for similar reasons, but some data is lost in the conversion to MIDI from any other format, unless the music was written with the MIDI standards in mind, which is rare. Digital audio formats such as WAV, mp3, and ogg are used when the audio itself is part of the analysis. Lossy formats such as mp3 and ogg work well with the human ear but may be missing crucial data for study. Additionally some encodings create artifacts which could be misleading to any automatic analyser. Despite this the ubiquity of the mp3 has meant much research in the field involves these as the source material. Increasingly, metadata mined from the web is incorporated in MIR for a more rounded understanding of the music within its cultural context, and this recently consists of analysis of social tags for music.

===Feature representation===
Analysis can often require some summarising, and for music (as with many other forms of data) this is achieved by feature extraction, especially when the audio content itself is analysed and machine learning is to be applied. The purpose is to reduce the sheer quantity of data down to a manageable set of values so that learning can be performed within a reasonable time-frame. One common feature extracted is the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) which is a measure of the timbre of a piece of music. Other features may be employed to represent the key, chords, harmonies, melody, main pitch, beats per minute or rhythm in the piece. There are a number of available audio feature extraction tools Available here

===Statistics and machine learning===
*Computational methods for classification, clustering, and modelling — musical feature extraction for mono- and polyphonic music, similarity and pattern matching, retrieval
* Formal methods and databases — applications of automated music identification and recognition, such as score following, automatic accompaniment, routing and filtering for music and music queries, query languages, standards and other metadata or protocols for music information handling and retrieval, multi-agent systems, distributed search)
*Software for music information retrieval — Semantic Web and musical digital objects, intelligent agents, collaborative software, web-based search and semantic retrieval, query by humming / Search by sound, acoustic fingerprinting
* Music analysis and knowledge representation — automatic summarization, citing, excerpting, downgrading, transformation, formal models of music, digital scores and representations, music indexing and metadata.

==Other issues==
*Human-computer interaction and interfaces — multi-modal interfaces, user interfaces and usability, mobile applications, user behavior
* Music perception, cognition, affect, and emotions — music similarity metrics, syntactical parameters, semantic parameters, musical forms, structures, styles and music annotation methodologies
* Music archives, libraries, and digital collections — music digital libraries, public access to musical archives, benchmarks and research databases
* Intellectual property rights and music — national and international copyright issues, digital rights management, identification and traceability
* Sociology and Economy of music — music industry and use of MIR in the production, distribution, consumption chain, user profiling, validation, user needs and expectations, evaluation of music IR systems, building test collections, experimental design and metrics

== Academic activity ==
* International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) conference is the top-tier venue for music information retrieval research. 
* International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP) is also a highly relevant venue.

<doc id="261210" wikidata="Q161103" url="?curid=261210" title="Petunia">
<text>Petunia is a genus of 20 species of flowering plants of South American origin. The popular flower of the same name derived its epithet from the French, which took the word , &#x27;tobacco&#x27;, from a Tupi–Guarani language. A tender perennial, most of the varieties seen in gardens are hybrids (&quot;Petunia&quot; × &quot;atkinsiana&quot;, also known as &quot;Petunia&quot; × &quot;hybrida&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Petunia&quot; is a genus in the family Solanaceae, subfamily Petunioideae. Well known members of Solanaceae in other subfamilies include tobacco (subfamily Nicotianoideae), and the cape gooseberry, tomato, potato, deadly nightshade and chili pepper (subfamily Solanoideae). Some botanists place the plants of the genus &quot;Calibrachoa&quot; in the genus &quot;Petunia&quot;, but this is not accepted by others. &quot;Petchoa&quot; is a hybrid genus derived from crossing &quot;Calibrachoa&quot; and &quot;Petunia&quot;.

==Species==
Species include:
==Ecology==
Petunias are generally insect pollinated, with the exception of &quot;P. exserta&quot;, which is a rare, red-flowered, hummingbird-pollinated species. Most petunias are diploid with 14 chromosomes and are interfertile with other petunia species, as well as with Calibrachoa.

The tubular flowers are favoured by some Lepidoptera species, including the Hummingbird hawk moth.

==Cultivation==
Petunias can tolerate relatively harsh conditions and hot climates, but not frost. They need at least five hours of sunlight every day and flourish in moist soil and conditions of low atmospheric humidity. They are best grown from seed. Watering once a week should be sufficient in most regions. Hanging baskets and other containers need more frequent watering. Maximum growth occurs in late spring. Applying fertilizer monthly or weekly, depending on the variety, will help the plant grow quickly.

===AGM cultivars===
The following is a selection of cultivars which have received the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:
* = &#x27;Conblue&#x27; 
* = &#x27;Conglow&#x27; 
* = &#x27;Constraw&#x27; 
* = &#x27;Kleph15313&#x27; 
*&#x27;Storm Lavender&#x27; 
*&#x27;Storm Pink&#x27;
*&#x27;Storm Salmon&#x27; 
* = &#x27;Suntosol&#x27;
* = &#x27;Sunpurple&#x27; 
* = &#x27;Kerpril&#x27; 
==Uses==
Many species other than &quot;Petunia&quot; × &quot;atkinsiana&quot; are also gaining popularity in the home garden. A wide range of flower colours, sizes, and plant architectures are available in both &quot;Petunia&quot; × &quot;atkinsiana&quot; and other species.

Genetically engineered bioluminescent Petunia hybrida was approved for sales by USDA in 2023. Called &#x27;Firefly&#x27;, this white-flowered petunia glows due to inserted genes from a bioluminescent mushroom.

==Symbolism and folklore==
The Maya and Inca believed that the scent of petunias had the power to ward off underworld monsters and spirits. Their flower-buds were bunched together for magical drinks.

<doc id="261212" wikidata="Q659860" url="?curid=261212" title="Leibnitz">
<text>Leibnitz (; ) is a city in the Austrian state of Styria and on 1 Jan. 2023 had a population of 13,014. It is located to the south of the city of Graz, between the Mur and Sulm rivers.

The town is the capital of the Leibnitz political district, which covers about 727 km2, within which more than 80,000 people live. Leibnitz acts as a cultural, educational, judicial and economic focus for the surrounding district.

==History==
Although the center of the current town is only about 3 km away from the archaeological site of Flavia Solva, Leibnitz cannot claim direct successorship to this Roman municipium founded in the 1st century, and finally destroyed in the early 5th century. When Bavarian settlers moved into the area during the 9th century, superseding and gradually absorbing the Slavic population that had established itself during the previous half-millennium, all recollection of the Roman city had long since faded.

The first documented version of the name Leibnitz reads &quot;Lipnizza&quot; and can be found in a scroll issued by emperor Otto the Great dated 7 March 970. However, a different settlement – the &quot;civitas Zuib&quot; (or &quot;Sulb&quot;; both names recall the Roman &quot;Solva&quot;) – was actually closer to the site of the present town than the &quot;civitas Lipnizza&quot; which was located on the nearby Frauenberg hill, where human occupation had persisted since the Neolithic age. Later, when the civilian settlement moved back and down to the Mur valley while the dwelling on the hill remained a fortified place, the name was transformed to &quot;Libniz&quot; and &quot;Libenizze&quot; (12th century), &quot;Leibentz&quot; and &quot;Leybencz&quot; (13th and 14th century), and finally &quot;Leybnitz&quot; (14th and 15th century). 

During the 12th century the settlement and its surrounding area, including the Sulm valley to the west, became territories of the Archbishopric of Salzburg and remained so for more than 400 years. The relocation of the civilian settlement was initiated (or at least heavily supported) by Archbishop Konradin of Salzburg, probably by 1130. In March 1170, Emperor Barbarossa discussed matters associated with Salzburg&#x27;s authority in Leibnitz, and an imperial document dated 14 June 1178 granted full jurisdiction to Salzburg.

The transition decades from the Middle Ages proved extremely turbulent and destructive to the area around Leibnitz, as it was to all the south-east parts of modern Austria. The fact that Leibnitz was not fortified certainly contributed to the decision of Archbishop Bernhard von Rorer in 1479 to hand the township over to the invading Hungarians; their occupation collapsed in 1490 and Austria quickly reclaimed Leibnitz, severely punishing those leading citizens who had collaborated with the Hungarians.

In the 18th and early 19th century, when Leibnitz had about 1,000 occupants, the town burned to the ground twice, on 29 May 1709 and again on 8–9 September 1829. By 1883 the population had risen to 2,471 and on 27 April 1913 Austro-Hungarian emperor Franz Josef I of Austria formally elevated Leibnitz to city rank.

By 1 January 1968 the population of Leibnitz had reached 6,641 but its relative importance and vitality had severely declined since Lower Styria had fallen to Yugoslavia in 1919 as a consequence of World War I, severing the city&#x27;s vital connections to the south and effectively making it all but a &quot;dead-border township.&quot; From the 1970s onward, when it became easier for Yugoslav citizens to travel to Austria, Leibnitz started to experience a marked economic reinvigoration which gained momentum with the establishment of Slovenia as an independent state in 1991, and its entry into the European Union in 2004.

==Culture and recreation==
Leibnitz has a cinema, an ice rink located in the center, and an open-air swimming pool with campsite and tennis courts. These facilities are enjoyed both by locals and passing tourist traffic on its way to the Adriatic.

Interesting annual events include a fall festival with harvest thanksgiving procession, Leibnitz &quot;wine week&quot; and a &quot;Perchtenlauf&quot;.

The vineyard-rich hilly countryside is home to many traditional wine-drinking establishments known as &quot;Buschenschenke&quot;, where the local produce can be readily tasted.

The area is also crisscrossed by cycle trails, which are particularly popular in summer and fall. Leibnitz is situated on a branch of the cycle track which runs alongside the Mur river from Graz to the Slovenian border. Another cycle track alongside the river Sulm leads to Gleinstätten.

==Gallery==
==Economy==
The area surrounding Leibnitz (known as the &quot;Leibnitzer Feld&quot;) is extensively cultivated, the main crops being maize and pumpkin. The latter is used in the production of the black-green colored pumpkin seed oil, a Styrian speciality. Several small to medium-sized industrial companies and also some smaller hotels and boarding houses are located within the town. 

The areas of hilly countryside around the town support many vineyards, which itself is a renowned center of wine production.

==Transportation==
Leibnitz lies on the main southern railway line, connecting Vienna to Slovenia and the Croatia- northern parts especially like towns Čakovec or Varaždin  via Graz. The journey from Graz main station to Leibnitz takes approximately 30 minutes using trains travelling to Spielfeld-Straß, Maribor or even Ljubljana or Zagreb. There are also several taxi firms based in Leibnitz. 

Leibnitz is also served by the A9 motorway, the main route to Slovenia via Spielfeld.

<text>Ahmed Best (born August 19, 1973) is an American actor, comedian and musician. He is known for providing the voice and motion capture for the character Jar Jar Binks in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise.

Best likewise collaborated with director George Lucas in three films and seven episodes of the cartoon show, &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;. He won the Annie Award for Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production for portraying Jar Jar Binks in &quot;Robot Chicken: Star Wars Episode II&quot;.

== Early life ==
Ahmed Best was born in New York City on August 19, 1973. Born in Roosevelt Hospital, he lived the majority of his formative years in the Soundview section of the Bronx, before moving to Maplewood, New Jersey in 1984. He attended Columbia High School, graduating in 1991. He then studied percussion at the Manhattan School of Music.

He is the younger brother of Dunia Best Sinnreich, lead singer and co-founder of Brave New Girl, Dubistry and Agent 99 and formerly with The Slackers.

== Career ==
In 1994, Best joined the acid jazz group the Jazzhole. He contributed to the success of the group for two years. He co-wrote and co-produced three albums for the group including &quot;The Jazzhole&quot;, &quot;And the Feeling Goes Around&quot;, and &quot;The Beat is the Bomb&quot;. In 1995, he co-wrote and co-produced &quot;Escape&quot; by Bill Evans.

In 1995, he joined the Obie Award-winning cast of &quot;Stomp&quot;. He toured with the cast of &quot;Stomp&quot; throughout the US and Europe.

In 1997, after casting director Robin Gurland had observed his flexible, athletic movements in &quot;Stomp,&quot; Ahmed was cast as Jar Jar Binks in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy (1999–2005). He reprised the role on the &quot;Star Wars–&quot;themed episode of &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; (as well as its sequel), &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, and on an episode of Stephen Colbert&#x27;s &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. Best said he put a lot of himself into the character, so when Jar Jar drew hostility from audiences, it sometimes extended toward the actor or he otherwise interpreted it personally. The character of Jar Jar Binks was so disliked that Best considered suicide. Best later appeared with fellow &quot;Star Wars&quot; alumni Dee Bradley Baker, James Arnold Taylor, and Daran Norris on the TV show &quot;Big Time Rush&quot;.

In 2008, he also wrote, directed, and produced the pilot for a television show called &quot;This Can&#x27;t Be My Life&quot;.

In late May 2020, Lucasfilm announced that Best would be starring as Jedi Master Kelleran Beq in a game-show called &quot;Star Wars: Jedi Temple Challenge&quot;, with a scheduled release date of June 3, 2020. It was later reported that &quot;Jedi Temple Challenge&quot; release date had been delayed until June 10 as a result of the unrest surrounding George Floyd&#x27;s murder. He would later reprise the role in the third season of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, a live-action series set in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe.

In addition to his acting roles, Best has worked as an adjunct professor at Stanford University. His Stanford classes have touched on subjects such as art and Afrofuturism.

Best also holds the rank of Black Belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

<doc id="261221" wikidata="Q433440" url="?curid=261221" title="Robert the Strong">
<text>Robert the Strong (; c. 830 – 866) was the father of two kings of West Francia: Odo (or Eudes) and Robert I of France. His family is named after him and called the Robertians. In 853, he was named &quot;missus dominicus&quot; by Charles the Bald, King of West Francia. Robert the Strong was the great-grandfather of Hugh Capet and thus the ancestor of all the Capetians.

==Origins and rise to power==
The parentage of Robert the Strong is obscure. While very little is known about the beginnings of the Robertian family, speculative proposals have been made. According to one proposal, Robert was a son of Robert III of Worms. Far more speculatively, mainly based on the use of the name Robert, or similar names, it has been proposed for example that his family had its origins in the Hesbaye region in present-day eastern Belgium, or perhaps descended from the family of Chrodegang of Metz. However, these proposals are unproven. 
According to the Worms proposal, during the reign of Louis the German in East Francia, the Robertian family emigrated from East Francia to West Francia. After their arrival in his realm Charles the Bald rewarded the family defecting from his enemy by assigning to Robert the lay abbacy of Marmoutier in 852. And in 853 he granted the position of &quot;missus dominicus&quot; in the provinces of Maine, Anjou, and Touraine to Robert, giving him &quot;de facto&quot; control of the ancient &quot;ducatus Cenomannicus&quot;, a large duchy centred on Le Mans and corresponding to the ancient realm of &quot;regnum Neustriae&quot;. Robert&#x27;s rise came at the expense of the established family of the Rorigonids and was designed to curb their regional power and to defend Neustria from Viking and Breton raids.

==Revolt==

In 858 Robert joined a rebellion against Charles the Bald. With the Bretons under Salomon he led the Frankish nobles of Neustria and invited Louis the German to invade West Francia and receive their homage. The revolt had been sparked by a marriage alliance between Charles and Erispoe, King of Brittany, and by the investment of Charles&#x27; son, Louis the Stammerer, with the &quot;regnum Neustriae&quot;, all which significantly curtailed the powers of both Salomon and Robert. Charles had given Robert the counties of Autun and Nevers in Burgundy; and in 856 Robert had defended Autun from Louis the German. But following Erispoe&#x27;s assassination in November 857, he and Salomon rebelled against Charles. 

Robert&#x27;s Neustrians chased Louis the Stammerer from Le Mans in 858. Later that year, Louis the German reached Orléans and received delegations from the Breton and Neustrian leaders, as well as from Pepin II of Aquitaine. In 861, Charles made peace with Robert and appointed him Count of Anjou. Thereafter, Robert successfully defended the northern coast against a Viking invasion. 

In 862 Charles granted Louis the Stammerer, his son, the lay abbacy of Saint Martin of Tours—a worthy benefice but small in comparison with the kingdom he had received in 856, and lost in 858. The young Louis rebelled and, befriended by Salomon who supplied him with troops, mounted war against Robert. 

In 862 two Viking fleets converged on Brittany; one had recently been forced out of the Seine by Charles the Bald, the other was returning from a Mediterranean expedition. Salomon hired the Mediterranean fleet to ravage the Loire valley in Neustria. Robert captured twelve of their ships, killing all on board save a few who fled. He then hired the former Seine Vikings to attack Salomon&#x27;s realm for 6,000 pounds silver. 

Robert&#x27;s apparent purpose was to prevent the Vikings from serving Salomon. He presumably collected a large amount in taxes for a (non-tributary) Danegeld to pay for keeping the Vikings out of Neustria. But peace between the Franks and the Vikings did not last long: in 863 Salomon made his peace, but the Vikings, now deprived of enemy lands to loot, proceeded to ravage Neustria. Charles now made Robert Lay abbot of the influential abbey St. Martin at Tours.

Robert warred with Pepin II in his later years. In 863 he again defended Autun from Louis the German; he campaigned in Neustria in 865 and again in 866, shortly before his death, dealing with Bretons and Vikings ravaging the environs of Le Mans.

== Death and legacy ==

On 2 July 866, Robert was killed at the Battle of Brissarthe while defending Francia against a joint Breton-Viking raiding party led by Salomon, King of Brittany and the Viking chieftain Hastein. During the battle the Viking commander was entrapped in a nearby church. Robert removed his armour to start to besiege the church; the Vikings then launched a surprise attack and Robert died in the subsequent melee. He left behind a nine-year-old son, Odo (who would later be King of France), as his heir. His heroic successes against the Vikings led to his characterization as &quot;a second Maccabaeus&quot; in the &quot;Annales Fuldenses&quot;.

==Family==
Robert married Adelaide of Tours, daughter of Hugh of Tours. They had: 
* Odo of France (c.857–898), King of West Francia
* Robert I of France (c.866–923), King of West Francia.

<text>Bukidnon (), officially the Province of Bukidnon (; ; ; Binukid and Higaonon: &quot;Probinsya ta Bukidnon&quot;), is a landlocked province in the Philippines located in the Northern Mindanao region. Its capital is the city of Malaybalay while Valencia is the largest city. The province borders, clockwise from the north, Misamis Oriental, Agusan del Sur, Davao del Norte, Cotabato, Lanao del Sur, and Lanao del Norte. According to the 2020 census, the province is inhabited by 1,541,308 residents. 
The province is composed of 2 component cities and 20 municipalities. It is the third largest province in the country in terms of total area of jurisdiction behind Palawan and Isabela respectively.

The name &quot;Bukidnon&quot; means &quot;highlander&quot; or &quot;mountain dweller.&quot; Occupying a wide plateau in the north central part of the island of Mindanao, the province is considered to be the food basket of the region, being the major producer of rice and corn. Products from plantations in the province also include pineapples, bananas and sugarcane.

Situated within Bukidnon is Mount Dulang-dulang, the 2nd highest mountain in the country, with an elevation of located in the Kitanglad Mountain Range. Mount Kitanglad (2,899 m), Mount Kalatungan (2,860 m), Mount Maagnaw (2,742 m), Mount Lumuluyaw (2,612 m), and Mount Tuminungan (2,400 m), the 4th, 5th, 8th, 17th, and 30th highest mountains in the country respectively, are also found in the province.

Bukidnon was consecutively ranked 5th in the list of richest provinces in the Philippines for four straight years according to the Commission on Audit&#x27;s 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Annual Financial Reports which were posted in 2019, early to late 2021, and 2022, respectively.

==History==
===Early history===

According to oral history of the Indigenous people of Bukidnon, there were four main tribes in Central Mindanao: the Maranaos who dwell in Lanao del Sur, and the Maguindanao, Manobo and Talaandig tribes who respectively inhabit the eastern, southern, and north-central portions of the original province of Cotabato. When the civil government divided central Mindanao into provinces at the turn of the 20th century, the groups included in the province of Bukidnon are the Talaandig and the Manobo, as well as other smaller Lumad tribes. The Visayans, particularly the Cebuanos and the Hiligaynons from the Northern Mindanao coastline and the southern Visayas, migrated into the province. The Visayans are still referred to by the Lumad as the &quot;dumagat&quot; (&quot;sea people&quot;) to distinguish them from the original mountain tribes. This was followed by various groups from Luzon, namely, the Ilocanos, the Igorots and the Ivatans, many of whom were merchants and wealthy entrepreneurs. All contributed massive acculturation among the Indigenous tribes. Most of those who moved to the mountains and forest continued to hold on their ancestors&#x27; cultural heritage. The wide variety of Filipino groups now thrives in the province and contributed immensely in the socioeconomic development.

===Spanish colonial era===

Bukidnon became a part of Misamis in the latter part of 1850. The whole area was then called &quot;Malaybalay&quot; and the people were known as Bukidnons (highlanders or mountain dwellers).

===American colonial era===
The Philippine Commission, then headed by Commissioner Dean C. Worcester, Secretary of Interior, proposed the separation of Bukidnon from Misamis Province. On August 20, 1907, Act No. 1693 created the province of Agusan with Bukidnon as its sub-province. About a month later, on September 23, the rancheria of Malaybalay was designated as the sub-province&#x27;s capital. Bukidnon became a regular province on March 10, 1917, by virtue of the creation of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu under Act 2711.

===Japanese occupation===
In 1942, invading Japanese troops entered Bukidnon. Mount Capistrano was a civilian evacuation area in the World War II. In 1945, the province was liberated from Japanese occupation by Filipino and American troops with the aid of Bukidnon-based Filipino guerrillas during the Second World War.

==Geography==
Bukidnon is a landlocked plateau in North Central Mindanao. It is bounded on the north by Misamis Oriental and Cagayan de Oro; on the south by North Cotabato and Davao City; on the east by Agusan del Sur and Davao del Norte; and west by Lanao del Sur. It lies between parallels 7°25&#x27; and 8°38&#x27; north latitude and meridians 124°03&#x27; and 125°16&#x27; east longitude. Malaybalay, the capital town, is about by air from Manila and by road from Cagayan de Oro.

It has two important landmarks, Mount Kitanglad and Pulangi River. Mount Kitanglad has a peak of above sea level. Pulangi River, on the other hand, traverses through the northeastern and southern part of the province towards the Rio Grande de Mindanao.

===Land area===
The province&#x27;s total land area is ,10,498.59 making it the largest in Mindanao in terms of land area. It accounts for 59 percent (59%) of Northern Mindanao. Thirty-eight percent (38%) is classified as alienable and disposable. The rest is timberland forest.

It also accounts for 80 percent (80%) or 34 million metric tons of the region&#x27;s nonmetallic mineral deposits, which include high grade white and red clay, gold, chromite, copper, serpentine, manganese, quartz and limestone deposits can also be found in the province.

===Topography===

Much of Bukidnon is an extensive plateau, but the southern and eastern boundaries are mountainous. The province&#x27;s average elevation is above sea level. The slope gradient peaks at of Mount Kitanglad, an extinct volcano occupying the central portion. Two other mountain bodies are found in its southern portion, Mount Kalatungan and Mount Tangkulan, which rise to and , respectively. The rest of the province is composed of nearly level terraces, alluvial plains, canyons and gorges. The volcanic terraces and volcanic foot slopes that are ≥500 m above sea level are estimated to be about .

Gently rolling grassland plateau are cut by deep and wide canyons of the Cagayan, Pulangi, and Tagoloan rivers and their tributaries, which cover a greater part of the province. The Bukidnon plateau is mainly of volcanic zone consisting of pyroclastic, basaltic and andesitic cones.
The whole eastern and southern border adjoining the provinces of Agusan, Davao del Norte, and Cotabato are covered by lofty and densely forested Pantaron Mountain Range, also known as the Central Cordillera. The Central Cordillera is a mountain range of sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks. About 49% of the land resource of the province is of rugged hills and mountains and 33% of undulating to rolling terrain.

At Mailag, south of Malaybalay, the plateau begins to descend and gradually merges into the lowlands of Cotabato province.

===Climate===
Two types of climate are roughly divided by the northern and southern areas of Bukidnon. The northern part is classified as belonging to Type III, that is, there is no pronounced rain period but relatively dry during the months of November to May. In the southern portion of the province, the climate is classified as Type IV with no dry season. The driest area is Baungon, while the wettest is the Calabugao plain. The climate is relatively cool and humid throughout the year.

The average annual rainfall is . Just like in other parts of the country, rainfall is more pronounced from June to October compared to other months of the year. February to April are the drier months.

Temperature ranges vary with elevation. In areas lower than above sea level (m.a.s.l.), the recorded temperature range is between . Areas with elevations greater than above sea level would have temperatures ranging from .

Relative humidity also varies with elevation, with those above 500 m having relative humidity of about 80%, while areas lying below , 65-7 percent. Thus, the Malaybalay-Impasugong area and those around the volcanic cones approximate semi-temperate conditions and can support the cultivation of highland tropical crops.

Based on the records of climatological stations within and near the province, lithology and land form, three agro-ecological zones are identified. One covers the mountainous eastern side (Central Cordillera), which is generally wet, with rainfall of about per annum. Another covers the high altitude volcanic plains, the Malaybalay-Impasug-ong area, and the foot slopes of Mount Kitanglad, and Mount Kalatungan. These areas have an annual rainfall in the range of . The third zone covers the south-central and the north-western parts of the province, with elevations of less than 500 meters, relatively dry with mean annual rainfall in the range of .

===Bodies of water===
==== Rivers ====
Bukidnon is home to the largest concentration of watersheds in Mindanao. It is endowed with six major river systems, namely: Pulangi, Tagoloan, Cagayan, Manupali, Muleta, and Bobonawan rivers. These rivers and their tributaries carved the landscape of the province, creating numerous canyons into the plateau.

The Pulangi River, considered the longest river in the province, is a tributary of the Rio Grande de Mindanao. Its headwaters are found in the mountains of Kalabugao, Impasugong. It is the largest as well as the longest river found in the province. It covers the following cities and municipalities of the province: Impasugong, Malaybalay, Cabanglasan, San Fernando, Valencia, Maramag, Quezon, Don Carlos, Kitaotao, Dangcagan, Kibawe and Damulog.

The Tagoloan River has its headwaters in the mountains of Can-ayan, Malaybalay. It traverses the province northwestward passing through Malaybalay, Impasugong, Sumilao, Manolo Fortich, Malitbog and finally empties into the sea at Tagoloan, Misamis Oriental.

The Cagayan River watershed is found mostly in the municipality of Talakag. Its headwaters are found in the Kitanglad Mountain Range in central Bukidnon. The river flows northward through the municipalities of Talakag and Baungon. Its mouth lies at Cagayan de Oro in Misamis Oriental, where it is the main source of potable water.

The Manupali River, a major tributary of the Pulangi River, starts in the mountains of Lantapan, Bukidnon, picking up tributaries along the way from the Kalatungan and Kitanglad Mountain Ranges. It forms part of the natural boundary of the Valencia and Lantapan. It flows eastward towards Malaybalay, eventually joining the Pulangi River in Valencia.

The Muleta River is found in the southern portion of the province covering the municipalities of Pangantucan, Don Carlos, Kitaotao, Dangcagan, Kibawe, Kadingilan and Damulog. It is another important tributary of the Pulangi River and flows southward. It will join the Pulangi River in the boundary of Bukidnon and Cotabato province.
The Bobonawan River, found in the municipality of Cabanglasan, is another tributary of the Pulangi River. It covers most of the parts of the municipality, flowing southward towards Pulangi River.

==== Lakes ====
Aside from the relatively important river systems, various lakes also dot the landscape of the province. Pinamaloy Lake, in Don Carlos, Bukidnon, is the largest in the province covering about 50 hectares. It was named after Barangay Pinamaloy, where the lake is located. Another lake is found in Pigtauranan, Pangantucan called the Napalit Lake. The lake covers an area of 36 hectares and is one of the tourist spots in Pangantucan, Bukidnon. There are 24 floating islets in the lake. The third significant inland body of water in the province is Apo Lake at Guinoyoran, Valencia. It occupies an approximate area of 25 hectares. A man-made lake called Maramag Basin is found in Maramag, Bukidnon, which was the result of the construction of the Pulangi IV Hydroelectric Dam of the National Power Corporation (NPC) in the course of the Pulangi River.

==== Springs and waterfalls ====
There are also numerous springs and waterfalls located in the province. Some of the waterfalls include the Alalum Falls, Dimadungawan Falls, Dila Falls, Gantungan Falls, Natigbasan Falls, Sagumata Falls, Magubo Falls, and Balisbisan Falls.

== Biodiversity ==
The Pantaron Mountain Range in Bukidnon is a biodiverse area that hosts endemic fauna. It is home to the critically endangered Philippine eagle, the vulnerable Philippine deer, the Philippine flying lemur, and the Mindanao gymnure. The Mount Kitanglad Mountain Range is home to the Philippine eagle, the Mindanao pygmy fruit bat, the Kitanglad shrew-mouse (&quot;Crunomys suncoides)&quot;, and the gray-bellied mountain rat (&quot;Limonmys bryophilus&quot;). &quot;Rafflesia schadenbergiana&quot; has also been found on Mount Kitanglad.

Mount Musuan and Mount Kalatungan, along with Mount Malindang in Misamis Occisdental, are also home to the Philippine eagle, the Mindanao wrinkled hornbill (&quot;Aceros leococephalus&quot;), and the Philippine tarsier (&quot;Tarsius syrichta&quot;). The three mountains are home to more than 1,000 plant species, including 12 that are endangered, 221 that are endemic, 17 that are rare, and 187 that are economically or socioculturally important.

Almost all large firms operating in the province are into production or processing of these agricultural products. Recognized by the Food and Agriculture Organization as a foot-and-mouth disease-free province, it is also a major producer of poultry, hogs, goats, and cattle.

The Philippine Carabao Center&#x27;s outlet in Central Mindanao University makes dairy products from water buffalos. Due to being landlocked, Bukidnon relies on the nearby cities of Cagayan de Oro and Davao for the supply of marine products. However, the province has its own supply of freshwater products such as tilapia, carp, catfish, mudfish, gourami, barb, goby, climbing perch, freshwater eels, giant freshwater prawn or shrimps, native freshwater snails or freshwater clams, and freshwater crabs, either via inland fishing or fry production aquaculture in inland fish farms and fish hatcheries.
Del Monte Philippines, Inc. (DMPI), Lapanday Diversified Products Corp. and Mt. Kitanglad Agri-Development Corporation are engaged in pineapple production. Dole Philippines (Skyland) and Mt. Kitanglad Agri-Ventures, Inc. are into banana production. DMPI is also engaged in cattle fattening. Bukidnon Sugar Milling Corporation (BUSCO) and Crystal Sugar Milling are into sugar milling and refining.

Phil-Agro Industrial Corporation is in starch production. Menzi Agricultural Development is in cacao production. Agaropyta Phils. Inc., Bukidnon Greens Inc., FP Obrero Farms and ARDEM, Inc. are in cut-flower production.

Food manufacturing giants, San Miguel Foods Corp. (SMPFCI), Monterey Farms Corp., Swift Foods, Inc. have intensified their contract breeding and growing operations in the province. Valencia Rubbertex, Inc., an 80-20 Japanese-Filipino joint venture produces rubber boots and rubber shoes for Japan.
As one of the major anchors in crop production, Bukidnon is moving forward towards establishing its position as a principal trader of rice, corn, sugar, potato, tomato and many other commercial and industrial crops. As the second largest producer of corn in the country, it reached a total production of 481,370 metric tons. In year 2000, vast tracts of cornfields, rice paddles, and sugar plantations are distributed all over the province.

Bukidnon has already assumed its role as producer and supplier of fresh fruits and vegetables. These produce are either sold in domestic markets or exported to Japan and other neighboring countries. Fresh pineapples, banana, sugarcane and cut flowers grown over the years are among its exports. New agri-business industries are still growing such as strawberry farming. Even export of rubber boots and shoes, an infant industry in the province is increasing tremendously.

A wide variety of resource-based handicrafts is extensively produced from rattan, bamboo, and wood. San Fernando is known for its rattan furniture. Bamboo baskets, wood wares and carvings, mats, and other handmade products are ideal souvenir items.

===Bukidnon Investment Grid===
During the mid-1990s, the provincial government of Bukidnon, after careful studies and consultation, has adopted a strategic program called the Bukidnon Investment Grid or BIG. This program is aimed to confine all its investment promotion activities and projects to the strip of land three kilometers from both sides of the Sayre Highway from Damulog to Manolo Fortich, and along the national/provincial road from Kibawe to Kadingilan; Don Carlos to Kadingilan; Maramag to Quezon; Maramag to Kadingilan; Kadingilan to Pangantucan; Valencia City to San Fernando; Malaybalay City to Cabanglasan; Malaybalay to Lantapan; Manolo Fortich to Libona; Libona to Cagayan de Oro; Talakag to Pangantucan; and Malitbog to Tagoloan in Misamis Oriental.

==Transportation==

The province is very well accessible by road primarily from the cities of Cagayan de Oro and Davao with alternate road networks as well from the cities of Butuan (via Agusan del Sur), Iligan (via Talakag), Marawi (via Talakag), Tagum (via San Fernando), and the province of Cotabato.
The entire province is bisected from north to south by the four-lane Sayre Highway from Cagayan de Oro to Kabacan, North Cotabato via Maramag (Bukidnon–Cotabato Road); and by the two-to-four lane Bukidnon–Davao Road (colloquially known as &quot;BuDa&quot;) from Quezon to Davao City. Both are components of National Route 10 (N10) of the Philippine highway network, and a spur of the Asian Highway 26 (AH26) of the Asian highway network. The Sayre Highway intersects with the BuDa Road in the barrio of Dologon in Maramag, where it changes to route N943 and continues on to Dangcagan, Damulog, and Kabacan.

The Sayre Highway (formerly &quot;Route 3&quot;) was renamed in honor of Francis Bowes Sayre, Sr., the U.S. Philippine High Commissioner who spearheaded its construction during the American occupation of the Philippines.

There are several airstrips in the province being used by private firms. Commercial flights used to be flown from the Malaybalay Airstrip, but it was closed down by the provincial government in the late 1990s. The airport where it used to be located was converted into a low-cost housing project. A proposed domestic airport site in the municipality of Don Carlos has already been on the talks since 2008 and in 2013, the Bukidnon Airport Development Project proposal was finalized. Budget allocation was done in 2017 and construction started in 2018. There are no seaports in Bukidnon because the province is landlocked. The nearest passenger seaport is in Cagayan de Oro.

==Education==

===Universities and colleges===
The following universities and colleges of Bukidnon are the tertiary schools.

==Festivals==

The province celebrates the Kaamulan Festival, an ethnic cultural festival held annually in Malaybalay, Bukidnon from the mid-February up to March 10, the founding date of the Bukidnon as a province in 1917. It is held to celebrate the culture and tradition of the seven ethnic tribal groups—&quot;Bukidnon, Higaonon, Talaandig, Manobo, Matigsalug, Tigwahanon, and Umayamnon&quot;—that originally inhabit the province. Kaamulan comes from the indigenous Binukid word &quot;amul&quot; meaning &quot;to gather&quot;. Kaamulan is gathering for a purpose—a datuship ritual, a wedding ceremony, a thanksgiving festival during harvest time, a peace pact, or all of these together. The festival started in 1974 and is celebrated until now. It is the only authentic ethnic festival in the Philippines.
==Bukidnon Hymn: &quot;Bukidnon My Home&quot;==

The Provincial Hymn was composed by Filomeno Bautista between 1925 and 1932. Nimecio Jun Beltran authored a provincial resolution requiring the singing of the provincial hymn in all and every events in the province of Bukidnon where the Philippine National Anthem is also sung.

<text>Jerome Seymour Bruner (October 1, 1915 – June 5, 2016) was an American psychologist who made significant contributions to human cognitive psychology and cognitive learning theory in educational psychology. Bruner was a senior research fellow at the New York University School of Law. He received a BA in 1937 from Duke University and a PhD from Harvard University in 1941. He taught and conducted research at Harvard University, the University of Oxford, and New York University. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Bruner as the 28th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

== Education and early life ==
Bruner was born blind (as a result of cataracts) on October 1, 1915, in New York City, to Polish Jewish immigrants, Herman and Rose Bruner. An operation at age 2 restored his vision. He was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology from Duke University in 1937; a master&#x27;s in psychology in 1939 and a doctorate in psychology in 1941, both from Harvard University. Bruner published his first article on a psychological subject in 1939, examining the effect of thymus extract on the sexual behavior of the female rat. During World War II, Bruner served on the Psychological Warfare Division of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force committee under General Dwight D. Eisenhower, researching social psychological phenomena.

== Career and research ==
Bruner returned to Harvard in 1945 in the role of psychology professor, focusing on research in the fields of cognitive and educational psychology. In 1972, he left Harvard to teach at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. He returned to the United States in 1980, to continue his research in developmental psychology. In 1991, Bruner joined the faculty at New York University (NYU), where he taught primarily in the School of Law.

As an adjunct professor at NYU School of Law, Bruner studied the effects of psychological factors on legal practice. During his career, Bruner was awarded honorary doctorates from Yale University, Columbia University, The New School, the Sorbonne, the ISPA Instituto Universitário, as well as from colleges and universities in Berlin and Rome; he was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of the American Philosophical Society. Bruner was a distinguished member of Psi Chi. He turned 100 in October 2015 and died on June 5, 2016.

=== Cognitive psychology ===
Bruner is one of the pioneers of cognitive psychology in the United States, which began through his own early research on sensation and perception as being active, rather than passive processes.

In 1947, Bruner published his study &quot;Value and Need as Organizing Factors in Perception&quot;, in which children from advantaged and disadvantaged backgrounds were asked to estimate the size of coins or wooden disks the size of American pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters and half-dollars. The results showed that the value and need the poor and rich children associated with coins caused them to significantly overestimate the size of the coins, especially when compared to their more accurate estimations of the same size disks.

Similarly, another study conducted by Bruner and Leo Postman showed slower reaction times and less accurate answers when a deck of playing cards reversed the color of the suit symbol for some cards (e.g. red spades and black hearts). These series of experiments issued in what some called the &#x27;New Look&#x27; psychology, which challenged psychologists to study not just an organism&#x27;s response to a stimulus, but also its internal interpretation. After these experiments on perception, Bruner turned his attention to the actual cognitions that he had indirectly studied in his perception studies.

In 1956, Bruner published the book &quot;A Study of Thinking&quot;, which formally initiated the study of cognitive psychology. Soon afterward Bruner helped found the Harvard Center of Cognitive Studies. After a time, Bruner began to research other topics in psychology, but in 1990 he returned to the subject and gave a series of lectures, later compiled into the book &quot;Acts of Meaning&quot;. In these lectures, Bruner contested the computer model of the mind, advocating a more holistic understanding of cognitive processes.

=== Developmental psychology ===
Beginning around 1967, Bruner turned his attention to the subject of developmental psychology and studied the way children learn. He coined the term &quot;scaffolding&quot; to describe an instructional process in which the instructor provides carefully programmed guidance, reducing the amount of assistance as the student progresses through task learning. Bruner suggested that students may experience, or &quot;represent&quot; tasks in three ways: enactive representation (action-based), iconic representation (image-based), and symbolic representation (language-based). Rather than neatly delineated stages, the modes of representation are integrated and only loosely sequential as they &quot;translate&quot; into each other. Symbolic representation remains the ultimate mode, and it &quot;is clearly the most mysterious of the three.&quot;

Bruner&#x27;s learning theory suggests that it is efficacious, when faced with new material, to follow a progression from enactive to iconic to symbolic representation; this holds true even for adult learners. A true instructional designer, Bruner&#x27;s work also suggests that a learner (even of a very young age) is capable of learning any material so long as the instruction is organized appropriately, in sharp contrast to the beliefs of Piaget and other stage theorists. Like Bloom&#x27;s Taxonomy, Bruner suggests a system of coding in which people form a hierarchical arrangement of related categories. Each successively higher level of categories becomes more specific, echoing Benjamin Bloom&#x27;s understanding of knowledge acquisition as well as the related idea of instructional scaffolding.

In accordance with this understanding of learning, Bruner proposed the spiral curriculum, a teaching approach in which each subject or skill area is revisited at intervals, at a more sophisticated level each time. First there is basic knowledge of a subject, then more sophistication is added, reinforcing principles that were first discussed. This system is used in China and India. Bruner&#x27;s spiral curriculum, however, draws heavily from evolution to explain how to learn better and thus it drew criticism from conservatives. In the United States classes are split by grade—life sciences in 9th grade, chemistry in 10th, physics in 11th. The spiral teaches life sciences, chemistry, physics all in one year, then two subjects, then one, then all three again to understand how they mold together. Bruner also believed learning should be spurred by interest in the material rather than tests or punishment, since one learns best when one finds the acquired knowledge appealing.

While Bruner was at Harvard he published a series of works about his assessment of current educational systems and ways that education could be improved. In 1961, he published the book &quot;Process of Education&quot;. Bruner also served as a member of the Educational Panel of the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee during the presidencies Lyndon Johnson. Referencing his overall view that education should not focus merely on memorizing facts, Bruner wrote in &quot;Process of Education&quot; that &quot;knowing how something is put together is worth a thousand facts about it.&quot; From 1964 to 1996 Bruner sought to develop a complete curriculum for the educational system that would meet the needs of students in three main areas which he called &quot;&quot;. Bruner wanted to create an educational environment that would focus on (1) what was uniquely human about human beings, (2) how humans got that way and (3) how humans could become more so. In 1966, Bruner published another book relevant to education, &quot;Towards a Theory of Instruction,&quot; and then in 1973, another book, &quot;The Relevance of Education.&quot; Finally, in 1996, in &quot;The Culture of Education,&quot; Bruner reassessed the state of educational practices three decades after he had begun his educational research. Bruner was also credited with helping found the Head Start early childcare program. Bruner was deeply impressed by his 1995 visit to the preschools of Reggio Emilia and has established a collaborative relationship with them to improve educational systems internationally. Equally important was the relationship with the Italian Ministry of Education which officially recognized the value of this innovative experience.

=== Language development ===

In 1972, Bruner was appointed Watts Professor of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford, where he remained until 1980. In his Oxford years, Bruner focused on early language development. Rejecting the nativist account of language acquisition proposed by Noam Chomsky, Bruner offered an alternative in the form of an interactionist or social interactionist theory of language development. In this approach, the social and interpersonal nature of language was emphasized, appealing to the work of philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein, John L. Austin and John Searle for theoretical grounding. Following Lev Vygotsky the Russian theoretician of socio-cultural development, Bruner proposed that social interaction plays a fundamental role in the development of cognition in general and of language in particular. He emphasized that children learn language in order to communicate, and, at the same time, they also learn the linguistic code. Meaningful language is acquired in the context of meaningful parent-infant interaction, learning &quot;scaffolded&quot; or supported by the child&#x27;s language acquisition support system (LASS).

At Oxford Bruner worked with a large group of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to understand how young children manage to crack the linguistic code, among them Alison Garton, Alison Gopnik, Magda Kalmar (Kalmár Magda), Alan Leslie, Andrew Meltzoff, Anat Ninio, Roy Pea, Susan Sugarman, Michael Scaife, Marian Sigman, Kathy Sylva and many others. Much emphasis was placed on employing the then-revolutionary method of videotaped home-observations, Bruner showing the way to a new wave of researchers to get out of the laboratory and take on the complexities of naturally occurring events in a child&#x27;s life. This work was published in a large number of journal articles, and in 1983 Bruner published a summary in the book &quot;Child&#x27;s talk: Learning to Use Language&quot;.

This decade of research established Bruner at the helm of the interactionist approach to language development, exploring such themes as the acquisition of communicative intents and the development of their linguistic expression, the interactive context of language use in early childhood, and the role of parental input and scaffolding behavior in the acquisition of linguistic forms. This work rests on the assumptions of a social constructivist theory of meaning according to which meaningful participation in the social life of a group as well as meaningful use of language involve an interpersonal, intersubjective, collaborative process of creating shared meaning. The elucidation of this process became the focus of Bruner&#x27;s next period of work.

=== Narrative construction of reality ===
In 1980, Bruner returned to the United States, taking up the position of professor at the New School for Social Research in New York City in 1981. For the next decade, he worked on the development of a theory of the narrative construction of reality, culminating in several seminal publications which contributed to the development of narrative psychology. His book &quot;Acts of Meaning&quot; has been cited over 20,000 times followed by &quot;Actual Minds, Possible Worlds&quot; which has been cited by over 18,000 scholarly publications, making them two of the most influential works of the 20th century. In these books, Bruner argued that there are two forms of thinking: the paradigmatic and the narrative. The former is the method of science and is based upon classification and categorization. The alternative narrative approach organizes everyday interpretations of the world in storied form. The challenge of contemporary psychology is to understand this everyday form of thinking.

=== Legal psychology ===

In 1991, Bruner arrived at NYU as a visiting professor to do research and to found the Colloquium on the Theory of Legal Practice.

<text>Ritual de lo Habitual (Spanish for &quot;Ritual of the Usual&quot;) is the second studio album by American rock band Jane&#x27;s Addiction, released on August 21, 1990, by Warner Bros. Records. Co-produced by Dave Jerden, it was the band&#x27;s final studio album before their initial break-up in 1991. The album includes some of Jane&#x27;s Addiction&#x27;s most famous songs, such as the singles &quot;Been Caught Stealing&quot; and &quot;Stop!&quot;. 

The album proved to be a great commercial and critical success. The album broke into the top 20 on the Billboard 200, sold 500,000 units within a month of its release, and would go on to be certified 2× Platinum in the U.S. The album has received critical acclaim since its release, and is regarded as a classic of Alternative Rock, alongside its predecessor, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot;.

==Background==
Jane&#x27;s Addiction&#x27;s first album, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot;, received widespread critical acclaim and helped bring the group to prominence in Alternative Rock circles, despite underperforming commercially due to censorship. After the album&#x27;s release, the band went on tour, opening for Iggy Pop and The Ramones. By the end of the tour, the band was headlining clubs and theaters and was considered a leading band in the burgeoning Alternative Rock scene. In mid-1989, the band began to record their follow-up, &quot;Ritual de lo Habitual.&quot; Navarro later stated he had almost no recollection of working on the album due to his addiction to heroin.

==Music==
The album is divided into halves. Tracks one through five are hard rock songs unrelated to each other, dealing with subjects such as stealing (&quot;Been Caught Stealing&quot;) and anti-racism. (&quot;No One&#x27;s Leaving&quot;)

Tracks six through nine are in memoriam of singer Perry Farrell&#x27;s deceased girlfriend Xiola Blue, who died of a heroin overdose in 1987 at the age of 18. &quot;Three Days&quot; and &quot;Then She Did&quot; bear a progressive rock influence, while &quot;Of Course&quot; carries a klezmer influence, with a prominent violin throughout. Eric Avery refused to play bass on &quot;Of Course&quot; out of resentment from being told what to play on other songs. Recording engineer and guitar tech Ronnie S. Champagne, who would later confess that Farrell had a tendency to dictate the other members&#x27; parts during the recording of this album, ended up playing bass on the song instead. For his part, Avery would later admit regret at not playing on the track.

&quot;Then She Did&quot; also chronicles Farrell&#x27;s mother&#x27;s suicide when he was four years old. &quot;It&#x27;s probably one of the reasons we were brought together…&quot; remarked guitarist Dave Navarro, whose mother was murdered when he was a teenager. &quot;I have memories of us being onstage together and, before we played &#x27;Then She Did&#x27;, Perry would grab me and say, &#x27;Let&#x27;s do this for our moms.&#x27; I still get chills when I think about it.&quot; &quot;When you have something like that happen…&quot; noted Farrell, &quot;the better thing to do is to try to make some flowers grow out of it.&quot;

==Packaging==
Two versions of the disc packaging were created: one album featured cover artwork of a papier mâché sculpture co-created by artist Casey Niccoli and singer Perry Farrell that visually referenced the Santería religion. The artwork was related to the song &quot;Three Days&quot; and includes male and female nudity. 

The second cover has been called the &quot;clean cover&quot;, and features only black text on a white background, listing the band name, album name, and the text of the First Amendment (the &quot;freedom of speech&quot; amendment, erroneously referred to as &quot;Article 1&quot;, which in reality establishes the legislative branch of government) of the U.S. Constitution. The back cover of the &quot;clean cover&quot; also contains the text: Hitler&#x27;s syphilis-ridden dreams almost came true. How could it happen? By taking control of the media. An entire country was led by a lunatic… We must protect our First Amendment, before sick dreams become law. Nobody made fun of Hitler??! The &quot;clean cover&quot; was created so the CD could be distributed in stores which refused to stock items with represented nudity.

==Release and tour==
The album was preceded by two singles, &quot;Stop!&quot; and &quot;Three Days,&quot; both released on August 2, 1990. The album was released on August 23, 1990, and proved to be a major commercial success, peaking at number 19 on the Billboard 200 and selling half a million copies within one month of its release. 

To promote the album, the band went on a tour that proved quite strenuous for the band; Farrell later recalled, &quot;That thirteen-month tour behind &quot;Ritual&quot; was half the reason we wound up unable to stand one another. The other half is that I am an intolerable narcissist who can&#x27;t get along with anyone.&quot; A major schism occurred on the issue of drug use during the tour: Farrell and Perkins regularly partook, while Avery and Navarro abstained. According to &quot;Spin&quot;, between shows, Avery and Navarro sought to avoid temptation by retiring to a section of the tour bus set aside for them. 

Part of the tour included headlining the first Lollapalooza festival, which traveled across North America in mid-1991 for 26 shows. Initially a farewell for Jane&#x27;s Addiction, the festival was also a showcase for other cult artists: Siouxsie and the Banshees, Nine Inch Nails, the Butthole Surfers, Living Colour, The Rollins Band, The Violent Femmes, and Ice-T&#x27;s Body Count. During the first Lollapalooza show, Farrell and Navarro got into a fight onstage after violently bumping each other mid-song. The band walked off before returning for an encore; however, the fight continued and Navarro eventually threw his guitar into the crowd. 

The band broke up in 1991 after playing their last shows in Australia and Hawaii. &quot;It&#x27;s weird to be at the end of a cycle like that,&quot; remarked Avery, &quot;having run the gamut of the usual &#x27;rock story&#x27; from beginning to end: you get signed, get strung out, break up.&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;Ritual de lo Habitual&quot; was acclaimed by music critics, similar to the band&#x27;s previous album. &quot;The gigantic swerve and swagger of &#x27;Stop&#x27;, the Chili Pepperish taunts of &#x27;Ain&#x27;t No Right&#x27;, &#x27;Of Course&#x27;″s raga rocking and, above all, the epic &#x27;Three Days&#x27;, where guitarist David Navarro gets to pile the layers shoulder high, prove to be the stuff of true compulsion,&quot; wrote Peter Kane in &quot;Q&quot;. &quot;Enigmatic, audacious and unpredictable to the last.&quot;

&quot;It all makes you realise how few bands actually bother to try and be any good, to play stuff that&#x27;s inspirational,&quot; enthused Andrew Perry in a retrospective review for &quot;Select&quot;. The same magazine later listed &quot;Ritual&quot; as the fifth best album of the &#x27;90s: &quot;&quot;Nevermind&quot; would never have been possible without it. And, along the way, they ushered in the Led Zep revival.&quot;

The album was voted the 24th best of 1990 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide. Robert Christgau, the poll&#x27;s supervisor, remained unimpressed by the album, dismissing it as &quot;junk syncretism (kitchen-sink eclecticism? styleless mish-mash?)&quot;.

Other musicians have spoken highly of the album. &quot;I can spot traces of other people on this album, us included,&quot; remarked hard rock vocalist Alice Cooper in 1994, &quot;but that&#x27;s all they are: traces. They were a really original band. This is their peak album, where they really went out on a limb. Sometimes I get so caught up in these songs, I can actually feel the band pushing themselves to their limits. Sometimes I can&#x27;t believe how strong it is. I wonder if this will have the same effect on some kid as Chuck Berry had on me ...&quot;

In 2003, the album was ranked number 453 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

In 2019, a book about the album, &quot;El Ritual de Jane&#x27;s Addiction&quot;, was released by Argentinian journalist Fabrizio Pedrotti. It tells the story with collaborations from the band, producers and other artists from that era. Farrell and Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy wrote the foreword for it.

<doc id="261229" wikidata="Q149128" url="?curid=261229" title="Bacilli">
<text>Bacilli is a taxonomic class of bacteria that includes two orders, Bacillales and Lactobacillales, which contain several well-known pathogens such as &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot; (the cause of anthrax). &quot;Bacilli&quot; are almost exclusively gram-positive bacteria.

The name &quot;Bacillus&quot;, capitalized and italicized, refers to a specific genus of bacteria. The name Bacilli, capitalized but not italicized, can also refer to a less specific taxonomic group of bacteria that includes two orders, one of which contains the genus &quot;Bacillus&quot;. When the word is formatted with lowercase and not italicized, &#x27;bacillus&#x27;, it will most likely be referring to shape and not to the genus at all.

==Ambiguity==
Several related concepts make use of similar words, and the ambiguity can create considerable confusion. The term &quot;Bacillus&quot; (capitalized and italicized) is also the name of a genus (&quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;) that, among many other genera, falls within the class Bacilli.

The word &quot;bacillus&quot; (or its plural &quot;bacilli&quot;, with a small b) is also a generic term to describe the morphology of any rod-shaped bacterium. This general term does not mean that the subject is a member of class Bacilli or genus &quot;Bacillus&quot;. Thus, it does not necessarily imply a similar group of characteristics. Not all members of class Bacilli are rod-shaped (&quot;Staphylococcus&quot; is spherical), and many other rod-shaped bacteria that do not fall within that class exist (e.g., &quot;Clostridium &quot; is rod-shaped but very different taxonomically). Moreover, the general term &quot;bacillus&quot; does not necessarily indicate the Gram-positive staining common to class Bacilli. For example, &quot;E. coli&quot; is a rod-shaped bacterium that can be described as &quot;a bacillus&quot;, but it stains Gram-negative and does not belong to the genus &quot;Bacillus&quot; or the class Bacilli. Some microbiologists have forsaken the general &quot;bacillus&quot; term because of the confusion it can create.

<text>A Woman in Flames (Die flambierte Frau, literally &quot;The Flambéed Woman&quot;) is a 1983 German drama film, directed and co-written by Robert van Ackeren, starring Gudrun Landgrebe, Mathieu Carrière, and Hanns Zischler. The film was selected as the West German entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 56th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.

==Plot==
Eva, an upper class housewife, becomes frustrated and leaves her arrogant husband. She is drawn to the idea of becoming a call girl. With the aid of a prostitute named Yvonne, Eva learns the basics and then they both set out looking for janes and johns together. She meets a charming man who she falls in love with and goes to his house late at night for a romantic tryst. He turns out to be a gigolo. Consequently, they move into his penthouse, which is large enough for both of them to offer their services separately.

Eva gradually moves into the world of sado-masochism. She finds being a dominatrix extremely satisfying, and begins to take pleasure in controlling others and causing them intense pain. She discovers this in a scene in which a man is hiding under a table. Eva can see that his hands are sticking out from under the table and are clearly visible. Coldly, and with intense inner satisfaction, Eva proceeds to crush the man&#x27;s hands by slowly walking over them with her stiletto-heeled shoes.

Chris, the gigolo, becomes jealous of her and wants to know what&#x27;s going on upstairs and how she is making so much money. She tells him it is from hurting men, and that the more she hurts them, the more money she gets. This upsets him greatly. She also becomes jealous of a boyfriend/client he has been seeing/servicing for many years. The scenes in the upstairs room intensify. One day he sneaks up and observes her in a scene dominating a man tied to a chair. He has a look on his face like &quot;see, this is what you truly are,&quot; and the look on her face says proudly &quot;yes, this is what I truly am.&quot; He tries to whisk her away from all of it, buying her furs, talking about marriage. She tells him that she&#x27;s been dreaming about hitting him, and in the dream he likes it.

The setting is all there for a romantic ending, and yet, he panics, he takes all their money and invests it in a restaurant that she doesn&#x27;t want to be part of. She tries to walk out on him, and he gets angry, throws her against the wall, hits her, pours alcohol on her, and lights her on fire.

But the last scene shows her unscathed, happy with her friend the sex worker/madame, and they&#x27;re getting thrown out of a bar that Chris owns.

<doc id="261237" wikidata="Q647665" url="?curid=261237" title="The Gods Must Be Crazy">
<text>The Gods Must Be Crazy is a 1980 comedy film written, produced, edited and directed by Jamie Uys. An international co-production of South Africa and Botswana, it is the first film in &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; series. Set in Southern Africa, the film stars Namibian San farmer Nǃxau ǂToma as Xi, a hunter-gatherer of the Kalahari Desert whose tribe discovers a glass Coca-Cola bottle dropped from an aeroplane, and believe it to be a gift from their gods. When Xi sets out to return the bottle to the gods, his journey becomes intertwined with that of a biologist (Marius Weyers), a newly hired village school teacher (Sandra Prinsloo), and a band of guerrilla terrorists.

&quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; was released in South Africa on 10 September 1980 by Ster-Kinekor, and broke several box office records in the country, becoming the most financially successful South African film ever produced at the time. The film was a commercial and critical success in most other countries, but took longer to find success in the United States, where it was eventually re-released in 1984 by 20th Century Fox, with its original Afrikaans dialogue being dubbed into English. Despite its success, the film attracted criticism for its depiction of race and perceived ignorance of discrimination and apartheid in South Africa.

In 1989, it was followed by a sequel &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy II&quot;.

==Plot==
Xi and his San tribe live happily in the Kalahari Desert, away from industrial civilization. One day, a glass Coca-Cola bottle is thrown out of an aeroplane by a pilot and falls to the ground unbroken. Initially, Xi&#x27;s people assume the bottle to be a gift from their gods, just as they believe plants and animals are, and find many uses for it. Unlike other gifts, however, there is only one glass bottle, which causes unforeseen conflict within the tribe. As a result, Xi decides to make a pilgrimage to the edge of the world and dispose of the divisive object.

Along the way, Xi encounters biologist Andrew Steyn, who is studying the local wildlife; Steyn&#x27;s assistant and mechanic, M&#x27;pudi; Kate Thompson, a woman who quit her job as a journalist in Johannesburg to become a village school teacher; and eventually a band of fugitive guerrillas led by Sam Boga. In the fictitious state Biryani, northwest of Botswana, Boga&#x27;s men have killed three cabinet members and injured two others in an attempt on the president&#x27;s life, sending the military in hot pursuit.

Steyn is tasked with bringing Thompson to the village where she will teach, but he is awkward and clumsy around her. Their Land Rover stalls while trying to ford a deep river; he hoists it out with a winch, but it continues lifting the vehicle to a very high treetop level while a forgetful Steyn is distracted extricating Thompson from a wait-a-bit tree. She more than once mistakes his attempts to evade wild animals, and putting out an evening campfire, as advances towards her. Eventually, a snobbish safari tour guide named Jack Hind arrives and takes Thompson the rest of the way to the village.

One day, Xi happens upon a herd of goats and, believing them to be wild animals, shoots one with a tranquilizer arrow, planning to eat it. The goatherd has him arrested, and he is sentenced to jail. M&#x27;pudi, who once lived with the San and can speak their language, is discontent with the verdict. He and Steyn arrange to hire Xi as a tracker for the remainder of his sentence in lieu of prison time, and teach Xi how to drive Steyn&#x27;s Land Rover. Meanwhile, the guerrillas invade Thompson&#x27;s school, taking her and the students as hostages as they make their escape to a neighbouring country.

Steyn, M&#x27;pudi and Xi, immersed in their fieldwork, find that they are along the terrorists&#x27; and children&#x27;s path. They manage to immobilize six of the eight guerrillas using makeshift tranquilizer darts launched by Xi with a miniature bow, allowing Thompson and the children to confiscate the guerillas&#x27; firearms. Steyn and M&#x27;pudi apprehend the remaining two guerrillas by frightening one with a snake and by shooting at a tree above the other, causing latex to drip from the tree and irritate his skin. Hind arrives and takes Thompson and the children away, taking credit for the rescue that Steyn, M&#x27;pudi and Xi had actually planned and executed.

Later, with Xi&#x27;s term over, Steyn pays his wages and sends him on his way. Having never seen money before, Xi discards it. Steyn and M&#x27;pudi then drive from their camp to visit Thompson, where Steyn attempts to explain his tendency to be uncoordinated in her presence, but accidentally and repeatedly knocks over a number of objects in the process. Thompson finds his efforts endearing, and kisses Steyn.

Xi eventually arrives at the top of a cliff with a solid layer of low-lying clouds obscuring the landscape below. Convinced that he has reached the edge of the world, he throws the bottle off the cliff and returns to his family.

==Cast==

Director Jamie Uys appears in an uncredited role as the Reverend.

==Production==
===Development and casting===
Jamie Uys conceived the premise of &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; while making the 1974 documentary &quot;Animals Are Beautiful People&quot;. The documentary was filmed partially on the Kalahari Desert, where Uys first encountered the San people and &quot;fell in love with them&quot;. Uys chose a Coca-Cola bottle as the object that the San people would discover and covet in &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; because he felt that the bottle was representative of &quot;our plastic society&quot;, and because it &quot;is a beautiful thing, if you&#x27;ve never seen glass before&quot;.

Uys noted that he modelled the character of Andrew Steyn after himself: &quot;I used to be awkward like that, especially with women. But then, I think most young guys knock things over with their first girl&quot;.

After writing the script for &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot;, Uys reportedly spent three months traversing the Kalahari Desert with an interpreter, searching for a San person to play the role of Xi in the film. Visiting areas of the desert inhabited by the San, Uys took photographs of individuals he felt he might cast, and then &quot;marked the longitude and latitude, so we could find them again&quot;.

Uys decided to cast Namibian San farmer Nǃxau ǂToma as Xi, and later recalled that &quot;At first [Nǃxau] didn&#x27;t understand, because they have no word for work. Then the interpreter asked, &#x27;Would you like to come with us for some days?″&quot; N!xau agreed and flew with Uys by aeroplane to Windhoek, Namibia, which served as a base for the film&#x27;s production. Uys stated that &quot;the airplane didn&#x27;t impress him at all. He thinks we are magicians, so he believes we can do anything. Nothing impressed him&quot;. In his hotel room, N!xau agreed to use the toilet, but slept on the floor rather than on the provided bed.

However, according to author Josef Gugler, Uys &quot;[fictionalized] the production of the film. The stories he told reviewers varied&quot;. Unlike what was presented in &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot;, N!xau did not lead a hunter-gatherer lifestyle; he grew up as a herder on a farm in Botswana, before moving to Namibia to work as a cook. In the 1980 documentary film &quot;Nǃai, the Story of a ǃKung Woman&quot;, directed by John Marshall, footage of the filming of &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; is used. The documentary shows San restricted to living in a reservation established by South African authorities in Tsumkwe, Namibia. The San there are shown to not be hunter-gatherers; they are instead dependent on the government for food and other aid, with some suffering from tuberculosis.

===Filming===
&quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; was shot in Tsumkwe, Namibia, as well as in Botswana.

According to Uys, N!xau would be flown back to his home in the Kalahari Desert every three or four weeks to prevent him from suffering from culture shock. During his time in urban areas, N!xau learned to smoke and acquired an affinity for liquor and &quot;sake&quot;. Uys said that he paid N!xau $300 for his first 10 days of work, but that the money was reportedly blown away by wind. N!xau was then compensated with 12 head of cattle. In 1985, Uys said that he had sent N!xau $100 a month since filming, which N!xau used at a trading store 100 km (60 miles) from his hunting ground; Uys also stated that a $20,000 trust account in N!xau&#x27;s name had been established.

A scene in which a rhinoceros stomps out a fire is based in a Burmese legend about fire-eating rhinos, which is not widely known in Africa and appears not to be based in fact.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; was initially released in South Africa on 10 September 1980 by Ster-Kinekor Pictures. Within its first four days of its release, the film broke box office records in every city in South Africa. It became the highest-grossing film of 1982 in Japan, where it was released under the title &quot;Bushman&quot;. Executive producer Boet Troskie sold the distribution rights to the film to 45 countries.

For its release in the United States, the original Afrikaans dialogue was dubbed into English, and voiceover work was provided for !Kung and Tswana lines. The film initially received a limited American release through Jensen Farley Pictures in 1982, but performed poorly in at least half a dozen test cities. However, the film would eventually find critical and commercial success when it was re-released by 20th Century Fox on 9 July 1984, becoming the highest-grossing foreign film released in the United States at the time. The film also played at the Music Hall Theater in Beverly Hills, California for at least eight months.

Within its first four years of release, &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; had grossed worldwide. , the film has grossed (approx. ) worldwide, including over in the United States.

===Critical reception===

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, concluding that &quot;it might be easy to make a farce about screwball happenings in the desert, but it&#x27;s a lot harder to create a funny interaction between nature and human nature. This movie&#x27;s a nice little treasure&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; stated that the film&#x27;s &quot;main virtues are its striking, widescreen visuals of unusual locations, and the sheer educational value of its narration&quot;.

In his review of the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Vincent Canby wrote that &quot;watching Jamie Uys&#x27;s &quot;Gods Must Be Crazy&quot;, [...] one might suspect that there were no such things as apartheid or the Immorality Act or even South Africa&quot;. Though he called the film &quot;often genuinely, nonpolitically funny&quot;, he noted that &quot;there&#x27;s also something disturbing about the film&quot;, in that &quot;we tend to feel that any South African work that doesn&#x27;t actively condemn apartheid has the secondary effect of condoning it, if only through silence&quot;.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; has an approval rating of 86% based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. On Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the film has a score of 73 out of 100 based on six reviews, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;.

===Home media===
In mid-November 1986, &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; was released on VHS in the U.S. by CBS/Fox on its Playhouse Video label.

In 2004, &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; was released on DVD by Sony Pictures Entertainment. It was also released on DVD as a double feature with &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy II&quot;.

==Controversies==
&quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; attracted criticism for its perpetuation of racial stereotypes and ignorance of discrimination and apartheid in South Africa. In the U.S., the film was reportedly picketed by the National Conference of Black Lawyers and other anti-apartheid groups when it screened at the 68th Street Playhouse in New York City.

===Accusations of patronization===
Both &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Vincent Canby and author Josef Gugler called the film &quot;patronizing&quot; towards the San people. Canby wrote that the San in the film &quot;are seen to be frightfully quaint if not downright cute&quot;, and compared the film&#x27;s narrator&#x27;s statement that the San &quot;must be the most contented people in the world&quot; to &quot;exactly the sort of thing that Mussolini might have said when he got those trains running on time&quot;. Gugler considered both the film&#x27;s narrator and the character of Mpudi condescending, writing that &quot;even if Mpudi feels for the San people, he is just as patronizing as the narrator: &#x27;They are the sweetest little buggers&#x27;&quot;. In response to accusations of patronization, Uys said that &quot;I don&#x27;t think the film is patronizing. When the Bushman is with us in the city, I do patronize him, because he&#x27;s stupid. But in the desert, he patronizes me, because I&#x27;m stupid and he&#x27;s brilliant&quot;.

===Criticisms related to apartheid===
In 1985, cultural anthropologist Toby Alice Volkman wrote that money was &quot;a pressing concern&quot; for the San when &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; was filmed, with many of them dependent on government aid and purchased food; she noted that many San enlisted in the South African Army due to the high wages it paid. She wrote: &quot;Because the myth of Bushman innocence and bliss underlies the popularity of &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot;, it is no surprise that Mr. Uys would like us to believe in it. There is, however, little to laugh about in Bushmanland: 1,000 demoralized, formerly independent foragers crowd into a squalid, tubercular homeland, getting by on handouts of cornmeal and sugar, drinking Johnny Walker or home brew, fighting with one another and joining the South African Army&quot;.

The following year, Canadian anthropologist Richard Borshay Lee called the film &quot;an amusing but thinly disguised piece of South African propaganda in which a peculiar element of South African white mythology receives prominent attention&quot;. Lee wrote that &quot;the notion that some San in the 1980s remain untouched by &#x27;civilization&#x27; is a cruel joke. The San have been the subject of a century of rapid social change and especially in the last twenty years have been forced to endure all the &#x27;benefits&#x27; of South Africa&#x27;s apartheid policies in Namibia&quot;.

Gugler wrote that the guerrillas in the film are depicted as &quot;bad Africans [...] dangerous and destructive all right, but they are also indolent and inept. In the end, even Kate Thompson gets to disarm one of them. Their leader, Sam Boga, articulates what the film is showing us about African guerrillas: &#x27;Why do I have to work with amateurs?&#x27; He, in turn, serves to confirm the apartheid credo that Africans would be happy with the White dispensation were it not for foreigners fomenting discontent and making trouble&quot;. Gugler goes on to state that Uys &quot;[perpetuates] the myths of apartheid: an ordered world with Whites on top, a world where Africans are content but for the interference of outsiders&quot;.

When asked about his thoughts on apartheid, Uys commented that &quot;I think it&#x27;s a mess. We&#x27;ve done some silly, naughty things that we&#x27;re ashamed of. We&#x27;re trying to dismantle it, but it&#x27;s a very complicated thing. If you go too slow, it&#x27;s bad, and if you go too fast, it will ruin the economy and everyone will starve. I hope I&#x27;m not a racist, but everybody likes to think of himself as not racist, and I don&#x27;t think that any of us can swear we&#x27;re not racist. If it means you hate the coloured man, I&#x27;m not racist. If it means you choose to marry a girl of your own colour, is that racist, too? If the two are in love, it doesn&#x27;t matter. But I chose a white girl as my wife&quot;.

==Sequel and related films==

&quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; was followed by an official sequel, &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy II&quot;, released by Columbia Pictures in 1989. It was written and directed by Uys, and again stars N!xau.

An unofficial sequel, &quot;Crazy Safari&quot; (also titled &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy III&quot;), followed, a Hong Kong film starring N!xau. Other unofficial sequels include &quot;Crazy Hong Kong&quot; (&quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy IV&quot;) and &quot;The Gods Must Be Funny in China&quot; (&quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy V&quot;). Another unrelated film, &quot;Jewel of the Gods&quot; was marketed in some territories as sequels to &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot;.

==Legacy==
Irish Spring soap had a 1989 commercial parodying the film.

The video for the song &quot;Take Me to Your Leader&quot; by American rock band Incubus pays homage to the film.
