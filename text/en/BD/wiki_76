<text>Ernest Augustus (; 5 June 177118 November 1851) was King of Hanover from 20 June 1837 until his death in 1851. As the fifth son of George III of the United Kingdom and Hanover, he initially seemed unlikely to become a monarch, but none of his elder brothers had a legitimate son. When his elder brother William IV, who ruled both kingdoms, died in 1837, his niece Victoria inherited the British throne under British succession law, while Ernest succeeded in Hanover under Salic law, which barred women from the succession, thus ending the personal union between Britain and Hanover that had begun in 1714.

Ernest was born in London but was sent to Hanover in his adolescence for his education and military training. While serving with Hanoverian forces near Tournai against Revolutionary France, he received a disfiguring facial wound. He was created Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale in 1799. Although his mother, Queen Charlotte, disapproved of his marriage in 1815 to her twice-widowed niece, Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, it proved happy. The eldest son of George III, the Prince of Wales (later George IV), had one child, Charlotte, who was expected to become the British queen, but she died in 1817, giving Ernest some prospect of succeeding to the British and Hanoverian thrones. However, his elder brother Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, fathered the eventual British heir, Victoria, in 1819 shortly before the birth of Ernest&#x27;s only child, George.

Ernest was an active member of the House of Lords, where he maintained an extremely conservative record. There were persistent allegations (reportedly spread by his political foes) that he had murdered his valet, had fathered a son by his sister Sophia, and intended to take the British throne by murdering Victoria. Following the death of William IV, Ernest became Hanover&#x27;s first resident ruler since George I. He had a generally successful fourteen-year reign but excited controversy near its start when he voided the liberal constitution granted before his reign and dismissed the Göttingen Seven, including the Brothers Grimm, from their professorial positions for protesting against this decision. In 1848, the King put down an attempted revolution. Hanover joined the German customs union in 1850 despite Ernest&#x27;s reluctance. Ernest died the next year and was succeeded by his son, George V.

== Early life (1771–1799) ==
Ernest Augustus, the fifth son of King George III and Queen Charlotte, was born at Buckingham House, London, on 5 June 1771, and baptised on 1 July 1771 at St James&#x27;s Palace. His sponsors were Duke Ernest of Mecklenburg (his maternal uncle), Duke Moritz of Saxe-Gotha (his paternal great-uncle, for whom the Earl of Hertford stood proxy), and the Hereditary Princess of Hesse-Kassel (his father&#x27;s cousin, for whom the Countess of Egremont stood proxy). After leaving the nursery, he lived with his two younger brothers, Prince Adolphus (later Duke of Cambridge) and Prince Augustus (later Duke of Sussex), and a tutor in a house on Kew Green, near his parents&#x27; residence at Kew Palace.

Though the King never left England in his life, he sent his younger sons to Germany in their adolescence. According to the historian John Van der Kiste, this was done to limit the influence Ernest&#x27;s eldest brother George, Prince of Wales, who was leading an extravagant lifestyle, would have over his younger brothers. At the age of fifteen, Ernest and his two younger brothers were sent to the University of Göttingen, located in his father&#x27;s domain of Hanover. Ernest proved a keen student and after being tutored privately for a year, while learning German, he attended lectures at the university. Though King George ordered that the princes&#x27; household be run along military lines and that they follow the university&#x27;s rules, the merchants of the Electorate proved willing to extend credit to the princes and all three fell into debt.

In 1790, Ernest asked his father for permission to train with the Prussian Army. Instead, in January 1791, he and Prince Adolphus were sent to Hanover to receive military training under the supervision of Field Marshal Wilhelm von Freytag. Before leaving Göttingen, Ernest penned a formal letter of thanks to the university and wrote to his father, &quot;I should be one of the most ungrateful of men if ever I was forgetful of all I owe to Göttingen &amp; its professors.&quot; Commissioned into the Hanoverian Army at the rank of lieutenant, Ernest learned cavalry drill and tactics under Captain Karl von Linsingen of the 9th (Queen&#x27;s) Light Dragoons and proved to be an excellent horseman, as well as a good shot. After only two months of training, Freytag was so impressed by the prince&#x27;s progress that he appointed him as a captain in the regiment. Ernest was supposed to receive infantry training, but the King, also impressed by his son&#x27;s prowess, allowed him to remain as a cavalryman.

In March 1792, the King commissioned Ernest as a colonel in the 9th (Queen&#x27;s) Light Dragoons. The prince served in the Low Countries during the War of the First Coalition under his elder brother the Duke of York, the supreme commander of a Coalition army of British, Hanoverian and Austrian troops. In a skirmish with the French army near the Wallonian town of Tournai in August 1793, he sustained a sabre wound to the head, which resulted in a disfiguring scar. At the Battle of Tourcoing on 18 May 1794, his left arm was injured by a French cannonball passing close by him. In the days after the battle, the sight in his left eye faded. In June, he was sent to England to convalesce, his first stay there since 1786.

Ernest resumed his duties in early November, by now promoted to major general. He hoped his new rank would bring him a corps or brigade command, but none was forthcoming as Coalition troops retreated slowly through Holland towards Germany. By February 1795, they had reached Hanover. Ernest remained in Hanover over the next year, holding several unimportant postings. He had requested a return home to seek treatment for his eye, but it was not until early 1796 that the King agreed and allowed Ernest to return to England. There, Ernest consulted eye surgeon Jonathan Wathen Waller, but Waller apparently found his condition inoperable, as no operation took place. In England, Ernest repeatedly sought to be allowed to join Coalition forces on the Continent, even threatening to join the Yeomanry Cavalry as a private, but both the King and the Duke of York refused him permission. Ernest did not want to rejoin the Hanoverian army, as they were not then involved in the fighting. In addition, Freytag was seriously ill and Ernest was unwilling to serve under his likely successor, Johann Ludwig, Reichsgraf von Wallmoden-Gimborn.

== Duke of Cumberland ==

=== Military commander ===

On 23 April 1799, George III created Prince Ernest Augustus Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale and Earl of Armagh, and Ernest was granted an allowance of £12,000 a year, equivalent to £ in . Though he was made a lieutenant general in both the British and Hanoverian armies, he remained in England and with a seat in the House of Lords entered into a political career. A High Tory, he soon became a leader of Tories&#x27; right wing. King George had feared that Ernest, like some of his elder brothers, would display Whig tendencies. Reassured on that point, in 1801, the King had Ernest conduct the negotiations which led to the formation of the Addington government. In February 1802, King George granted his son the colonelcy of the 27th Light Dragoons, a post which offered the option of transfer to the colonelcy of the 15th Light Dragoons when a vacancy arose. A vacancy promptly occurred and the Duke became the colonel of the 15th Light Dragoons in March 1802. Although the post could have been a sinecure, Ernest involved himself in the affairs of the regiment and led it on manoeuvres.

In early 1803, the Duke of York appointed Ernest as commander of the Severn District, in charge of the forces in and around the Severn Estuary. When Britain declared war on France a year after the Treaty of Amiens was signed, Frederick appointed Ernest to the more important South-West District, comprising Hampshire, Dorset and Wiltshire. Though Ernest would have preferred command of the King&#x27;s German Legion, composed mostly of expatriates from French-occupied Hanover, he accepted the post. The Duke of Cumberland increased the defences on the South Coast, especially around the town of Weymouth, where his father often spent time in the summer.

The Acts of Union 1800 had given Ireland representation in Parliament, but existing law prevented Irish Catholics from serving there because of their religion. Catholic emancipation was a major political issue of the first years of the 19th century. The Duke of Cumberland was a strong opponent of giving political rights to Catholics, believing that emancipation would be a violation of the King&#x27;s Coronation Oath to uphold Anglicanism and spoke out in the House of Lords against emancipation. Protestant Irish organisations supported the Duke; he was elected Chancellor of the University of Dublin in 1805 and Grand Master of the Orange Lodges two years later.

The Duke repeatedly sought a post with Coalition forces fighting against France, but was sent to the Continent only as an observer. In 1807, he advocated sending British troops to prevent the French and their allies from capturing the Swedish-held city of Stralsund. The Grenville ministry refused to send any troops; shortly afterwards, the ministry fell and the new prime minister the Duke of Portland agreed to send Ernest with 20,000 troops. However, they were sent too late, as a French-led army captured Stralsund from the Swedish before Ernest and his troops could reach the city. Ernest was promoted to general in the British army in 1808, backdated to 1805.

=== Sellis incident and Weymouth controversy ===

In the early hours of 31 May 1810, Ernest, by his written account, was struck in the head several times while asleep in bed, awakening him. He ran for the door, where he was wounded in the leg by a sabre. He called for help and one of his valets, Cornelius Neale, responded and aided him. Neale raised the alarm and the household soon realised that Ernest&#x27;s other valet, Joseph Sellis, was not among them and that the door to Sellis&#x27;s room was locked. The lock was forced and Sellis was discovered with his throat freshly cut, a wound apparently self-inflicted. Ernest received several serious wounds during the apparent attack and required over a month to recover from his injuries. The social reformer and anti-monarchist Francis Place managed to join the inquest jury and became its foreman. Place went to the office of a barrister friend to study inquest law and aggressively questioned witnesses. Place also insisted that the inquest be opened to the public and press, and so cowed the coroner that he basically ran the inquest himself. Nevertheless, the jury returned a unanimous verdict of suicide against Sellis.
Much of the public blamed Ernest for Sellis&#x27;s death. The more extreme Whig papers, anti-royal pamphleteers, and caricaturists all offered nefarious explanations for Sellis&#x27;s death, in which the Duke was to blame. Some stories had the Duke cuckolding Sellis, with the attack as retaliation, or Sellis killed for finding Ernest and Mrs. Sellis in bed together. Others suggested that the Duke was the lover of either Sellis or Neale, and that blackmail had played a part in the death. Both Roger Fulford and John Van der Kiste, who wrote books about George III&#x27;s children, ascribe part of the animus and fear towards the Duke to the fact that he did not conduct love affairs in public, as did his elder brothers. According to them, the public feared what vices might be going on behind the locked doors of the Duke&#x27;s house and assumed the worst.

In early 1813, Ernest was involved in political scandal during an election contest in Weymouth following the general election the previous year. The Duke was shown to be one of three trustees who were able to dictate who would represent Weymouth in Parliament. It being considered improper for a peer to interfere in an election to the House of Commons, there was considerable controversy and the government sent Ernest to Europe as an observer to accompany Hanoverian troops, which were again engaged in war against France. Though he saw no action, Ernest was present at the Battle of Leipzig, a major victory for the Allies. Following this, Ernest received ultimate promotion, to Field Marshal, on 26 November 1813.

=== Marriage ===

Ernest met and fell in love in mid-1813 with his first cousin, Duchess Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of Prince Frederick William of Solms-Braunfels and widow of Prince Louis of Prussia. The two agreed to wed if Frederica became free to marry. Her marriage to Frederick William had not been a success; her husband, seeing the marriage was beyond hope, agreed to a divorce, but his sudden death in 1814 removed the necessity. Some considered the death too convenient and suspected Frederica of poisoning her husband. Queen Charlotte opposed the marriage: before Frederica had married Frederick William, she had jilted Ernest&#x27;s younger brother, Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, after the engagement was announced.

Following the marriage in Germany on 29 May 1815, Queen Charlotte refused to receive her new daughter-in-law, nor would the Queen attend the resolemnisation of the Cumberlands&#x27; marriage at Kew, which Ernest&#x27;s four elder brothers attended. The Prince of Wales (who had been Prince Regent since 1811) found the Cumberlands&#x27; presence in Britain embarrassing, and offered him money and the governorship of Hanover if they would leave for the Continent. Ernest refused and the Cumberlands divided their time between Kew and St. James&#x27;s Palace for the next three years. The Queen remained obstinate in her refusal to receive Frederica. Despite these family troubles, the Cumberlands had a happy marriage. The government of Lord Liverpool asked Parliament to increase the Duke&#x27;s allowance by £6,000 per year in 1815 (equal to about £ today), so he could meet increased expenses due to his marriage. The Duke&#x27;s involvement in the Weymouth election became an issue and the bill failed by one vote. Liverpool tried again in 1817; this time the bill failed by seven votes.

At the time of the Duke&#x27;s marriage in 1815, it seemed to have little dynastic significance to Britain. Princess Charlotte of Wales, only child of the Prince Regent, was the King&#x27;s only legitimate grandchild. The young princess was expected to have children who would secure the British succession, especially after she married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld in 1816. Both the Prince Regent and the Duke of York were married but estranged from their wives, while the next two brothers, Prince William, Duke of Clarence, and Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, were unmarried. On 6 November 1817, Princess Charlotte died after delivering a stillborn son. King George was left with twelve surviving children and no surviving legitimate grandchildren. Most of the unmarried royal dukes hurriedly sought out suitable brides and hastened to the altar, hoping to secure the succession for another generation.

Seeing little prospect of the Queen giving in and receiving her daughter-in-law, the Cumberlands moved to Germany in 1818. They had difficulty living within their means in Britain and the cost of living was much lower in Germany. Queen Charlotte died on 17 November 1818, but the Cumberlands remained in Germany, living principally in Berlin, where the Duchess had relatives. In 1817, the Duchess had a stillborn daughter; in 1819 she gave birth to a boy, Prince George of Cumberland. The Duke occasionally visited England, where he stayed with his eldest brother, who in 1820 succeeded to the British and Hanoverian thrones as George IV. George III&#x27;s fourth son, the Duke of Kent, died six days before his father, but left a daughter, Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent. With the death of George III, Ernest became fourth in line to the British throne, following the Duke of York (who died without legitimate issue in 1827), the Duke of Clarence and Princess Alexandrina Victoria. Returning to England, his political power was again considerable, as it seemed possible that he would succeed to the throne.

=== Politics and unpopularity ===

In 1826, Parliament finally voted to increase Ernest&#x27;s allowance. The Liverpool government argued that the Duke needed an increased allowance to pay for Prince George&#x27;s education; even so, it was opposed by many Whigs. The bill, which passed the House of Commons 120–97, required George to live in England if Ernest was to receive the money.

In 1828, Ernest was staying with the King at Windsor Castle when severe disturbances broke out in Ireland among Catholics. The Duke was an ardent supporter of the Protestant cause in Ireland and returned to Berlin in August, believing that the government, led by the Duke of Wellington, would deal firmly with the Irish. In January 1829, the Wellington government announced that it would introduce a Catholic emancipation bill to conciliate the Irish. Disregarding a request from Wellington that he remain abroad, Ernest returned to London and was one of the leading opponents to the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, influencing George IV against the bill. Within days of his arrival, the King instructed the officers of his Household to vote against the bill. Hearing of this, Wellington told the King that he must resign as Prime Minister unless the King could assure him of complete support. The King initially accepted Wellington&#x27;s resignation and Ernest attempted to put together a government united against Catholic emancipation. Though such a government would have had considerable support in the House of Lords, it would have had little support in the Commons and Ernest abandoned his attempt. The King recalled Wellington. The bill passed the Lords and became law.

The Wellington government hoped that Ernest would return to Germany, but he moved his wife and son to Britain in 1829. &quot;The Times&quot; reported that they would live at Windsor in the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Tower&quot;; instead, the Duke reopened his house at Kew. They settled there as rumours flew that Thomas Garth, thought to be the illegitimate son of Ernest&#x27;s sister Princess Sophia, had been fathered by Ernest. It was also said that Ernest had blackmailed the King by threatening to expose this secret, though Van der Kiste points out that Ernest would have been ill-advised to blackmail with a secret which, if exposed, would destroy him. These rumours were spread as Ernest journeyed to London to fight against Catholic emancipation. Whig politician and diarist Thomas Creevey wrote about the Garth rumour in mid-February and there is some indication the rumours began with Princess Lieven, wife of the Russian ambassador.

Newspapers also reported, in July 1829, that the Duke had been thrown out of Lord Lyndhurst&#x27;s house for assaulting Lyndhurst&#x27;s wife Sarah. In early 1830, a number of newspapers printed articles hinting that Ernest was having an affair with Lady Graves, a mother of fifteen, now past fifty. In February 1830, Lord Graves, Ernest&#x27;s lord of the bedchamber and comptroller of his household, wrote a note to his wife expressing his confidence in her innocence, then cut his own throat. Two days after Lord Graves&#x27;s death (and the day after the inquest), &quot;The Times&quot; printed an article connecting Lord Graves&#x27;s death with Sellis&#x27;s. After being shown the suicide note, &quot;The Times&quot; withdrew its implication there might be a connection between the two deaths. Nonetheless, many believed the Duke responsible for the suicide—or guilty of a second murder. The Duke later stated that he had been &quot;accused of every crime in the decalogue&quot;. Ernest&#x27;s biographer Anthony Bird states that while there is no proof, he has no doubt that the rumours against the Duke were spread by the Whigs for political ends. Another biographer, Geoffrey Willis, pointed out that no scandal had attached itself to the Duke during the period of over a decade when he resided in Germany; it was only when he announced his intention to return to Britain that &quot;a campaign of unparalleled viciousness&quot; began against him. The Duke of Wellington once told Charles Greville that George IV had said of Ernest&#x27;s unpopularity, &quot;there was never a father well with his son, or husband with his wife, or lover with his mistress, or a friend with his friend, that he did not try to make mischief between them.&quot; According to Bird, Ernest was the most unpopular man in England.
The Duke&#x27;s influence at court was ended by the death of George IV in June 1830 and the succession of the Duke of Clarence as William IV. Wellington wrote that &quot;the effect of the King&#x27;s death will ... be to put an end to the Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s political character and power in this country entirely&quot;. King William had no legitimate children (two daughters having died in infancy) and Ernest was now heir presumptive in Hanover, since the British heir presumptive, Princess Victoria, as a female could not inherit there. William realised that, so long as the Duke maintained a power base at Windsor, he could wield unwanted influence. The Duke was Gold Stick as head of the Household Cavalry; William made the Duke&#x27;s post responsible to the Commander in Chief rather than to the King, and an insulted Ernest, outraged at the thought of having to report to an officer junior to himself, resigned.

King William again emerged triumphant when the new queen, Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, wished to quarter her horses in the stables customarily used by the consort, but which were then occupied by Ernest&#x27;s horses. Ernest initially refused the King&#x27;s order to remove the horses, but gave in when told that William&#x27;s grooms would remove them if Ernest did not move them voluntarily. However, Ernest and William remained friendly throughout the latter&#x27;s seven-year reign. Ernest&#x27;s house at Kew was too small for his family; the King gave the Duke and Duchess lifetime residence in a nearby, larger house by the entrance to Kew Gardens. Ernest, who was against the extension of civil and religious liberties, opposed the Reform Act 1832 and was one of the &quot;diehard&quot; peers who voted against the bill on its final reading in which most Tories abstained under threat of seeing the House of Lords flooded with Whig peers. His unpopularity was deepened by the suggestion that he favoured the creation of Orange lodges in the army.

Ernest was the subject of more allegations in 1832, when two young women accused him of trying to ride them down as they walked near Hammersmith. The Duke had not left his grounds at Kew on the day in question and was able to ascertain that the rider was one of his equerries, who professed not to have seen the women. Nevertheless, newspapers continued to print references to the incident, suggesting that Ernest had done what the women stated and was cravenly trying to push blame on another. The same year, the Duke sued for libel after a book appeared accusing him of having his valet Neale kill Sellis and the jury found against the author. The Cumberlands suffered further tragedy, as young Prince George went blind. The prince had been blind in one eye for several years; an accident at age thirteen took the sight of the other. Ernest had hoped that his son might marry Princess Victoria and keep the British and Hanoverian thrones united, but the handicap made it unlikely that George could win Victoria&#x27;s hand and raised questions about whether he should succeed in Hanover.

The Duke spent William IV&#x27;s reign in the House of Lords, where he was assiduous in his attendance. Newspaper editor James Grant wrote that &quot;He is literally—the door-keeper of course excepted—the first man in the House and the last out of it. And this not merely generally, but every night.&quot; Grant, in his observations of the leading members of the House of Lords, indicated that the Duke was not noted for his oratory (he delivered no speech longer than five minutes) and had a voice that was difficult to understand, though &quot;his manner is most mild and conciliatory&quot;. Grant denigrated the Duke&#x27;s intellect and influence, but stated that the Duke had indirect influence over several members, and that &quot;he is by no means so bad a tactician as his opponents suppose&quot;.

Controversy arose in 1836 over the Orange Lodges. The lodges (which took anti-Catholic views) were said to be ready to rise and try to put the Duke of Cumberland on the throne on the death of King William. According to Joseph Hume, speaking in the House of Commons, Victoria was to be passed over on the grounds of her age, sex, and incapacity. The Commons passed a resolution calling for the dissolution of the lodges. When the matter reached the Lords, the Duke defended himself, saying of Princess Victoria, &quot;I would shed the last drop of my blood for my niece.&quot; The Duke indicated that the Orange Lodge members were loyal and were willing to dissolve the lodges in Great Britain. According to Bird, this incident was the source of the widespread rumours that Ernest intended to murder Victoria and take the British throne for himself.

== King of Hanover (1837–1851) ==
=== Domestic affairs ===

==== Constitutional controversy ====

On 20 June 1837, William IV died; Victoria succeeded him as Queen of the United Kingdom, while Ernest Augustus became King of Hanover. On 28 June 1837, Ernest entered his new domain, passing under a triumphal arch. For the first time in over a century, Hanover would have a ruler living there. Many Hanoverians were of a liberal perspective and would have preferred the popular viceroy, Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, to become king, but the Dukes of Sussex and Cambridge refused to lend themselves to any movement by which they would become king rather than their elder brother. According to Roger Fulford in his study of George III&#x27;s younger sons, &quot;Royal Dukes&quot;, &quot;In 1837, King Ernest was the only male descendant of George III who was willing and able to continue the connection with Hanover.&quot;

Hanover had received its first constitution, granted by the Prince Regent, in 1819; this did little more than denote Hanover&#x27;s change from an electorate to a kingdom, guaranteed by the Congress of Vienna. The Duke of Cambridge, as King William&#x27;s viceroy in Hanover, recommended a thorough reorganisation of the Hanoverian government. William IV had given his consent to a new constitution in 1833; the Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s consent was neither asked nor received, and he had formally protested against the constitution&#x27;s adoption without his consent. One provision of the constitution transferred the Hanoverian Domains (the equivalent of the British Crown Estate) from the sovereign to the state, eroding the monarch&#x27;s power.

Immediately upon his arrival in Hanover, the King dissolved the Hanoverian Parliament, which had been convened under the disputed constitution. On 5 July, he proclaimed the suspension of the constitution, on the grounds that his consent had not been asked and that it did not meet the kingdom&#x27;s needs. On 1 November 1837, the King issued a patent, declaring the constitution void, but upholding all laws passed under it. The 1819 constitution was restored. His son, Crown Prince George, endorsed the action.

In carrying the King&#x27;s patent into effect, the Cabinet required all officeholders (including professors at Göttingen University) to renew their oaths of allegiance to the King. Seven professors (including the two Brothers Grimm) refused to take the oaths and agitated for others to protest against the King&#x27;s decree. Since they did not take the oaths, the seven lost their positions and the King expelled the three most responsible (including Jacob Grimm) from Hanover. Only one of the seven, orientalist Heinrich Ewald, was a citizen of Hanover, and he was not expelled. In the final years of the King&#x27;s reign, the three were invited to return. Ernest wrote of the incident to his brother-in-law, Frederick William III of Prussia, &quot;If each of these seven gentlemen had addressed a letter to me expressing his opinion, I would have had no cause to take exception to their conduct. But to call a meeting and publish their opinions even before the government had received their protest—that is what they have done and that I cannot allow.&quot; Ernest received a deputation of Göttingen citizens who, fearing student unrest, applauded the dismissals. However, he was widely criticised in Europe, especially in Britain. In the British House of Commons, MP Colonel Thomas Perronet Thompson proposed to Parliament that if the as-yet-childless Queen Victoria died, making Ernest the British king, Parliament should declare that King Ernest had forfeited all rights to the British throne by his actions.

A more significant protest against the revocation of the 1833 constitution was the refusal of a number of towns to appoint parliamentary deputies. However, by 1840 a sufficient number of deputies had been appointed for the King to summon Parliament, which met for two weeks in August, approving a modified version of the 1819 constitution, passing a budget and sending a vote of thanks to the King. The Parliament met again the following year, passed a three-year budget and adjourned again.

==== National development and trade; 1848 crisis ====

At the time the King took the throne, the city of Hanover was a densely packed residential town and did not rise to the grand style of many German capitals. Once the political crises of the first years of his reign had subsided, he set out to remedy this state of affairs. Ernest&#x27;s support led to gas lighting in the city streets of Hanover, up-to-date sanitation and the development of a new residential quarter. He had the plans altered in 1841, after Queen Frederica&#x27;s death, to leave standing the &quot;Altes Palais&quot;, where the two had lived since arriving in Hanover. Ernest&#x27;s interest in and support of the railroads led to Hanover becoming a major railway junction, much to the nation&#x27;s benefit. However, when court architect Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves in 1837 proposed the building of an opera house in Hanover, the King initially refused, calling the proposal &quot;this utterly absurd idea of building a court theatre in the middle of this green field&quot;. The King finally gave his consent in 1844 and the opera house opened in 1852, a year after the King&#x27;s death.

Every week, the King travelled with his secretary to different parts of his kingdom, and anyone could lay a petition before him—although Ernest had petitions screened by the secretary so he would not have to deal with frivolous complaints. Ernest opened high ministerial positions to those of any class, securing the services of several ministers who would not have been eligible without this reform. Though the King had, while Duke of Cumberland, fought against Catholic emancipation in Britain and Ireland, he made no objection to Catholics in government service in Hanover and even visited their churches. Ernest explained this by stating that there were no historical reasons to restrict Catholics in Hanover, as there had been in the United Kingdom. He continued to oppose admission of Jews into the British Parliament, but gave Jews in Hanover equal rights.

The King supported a postal union and common currency among the German states, but opposed the Prussian-led customs union, the &quot;Zollverein&quot;, fearing that it would lead to Prussian dominance and the end of Hanover as an independent state. Instead, the King supported the &quot;Steuerverein&quot;, which Hanover and other western German states had formed in 1834. When the &quot;Steuerverein&quot; treaties came up for renewal in 1841, Brunswick pulled out of the union and joined the &quot;Zollverein&quot;, greatly weakening Hanover&#x27;s position, especially since Brunswick had enclaves within Hanover. Ernest was able to postpone the enclaves&#x27; entry into the &quot;Zollverein&quot; and, when a trade war began, was able to outlast Brunswick. In 1845, Brunswick, Hanover and Prussia signed a trade agreement. In 1850, Ernest reluctantly permitted Hanover to join the &quot;Zollverein&quot;, though the entry was on favourable terms. Ernest&#x27;s forebodings about Prussia were warranted; in 1866, fifteen years after his death, Hanover chose the Austrian side in the Austro-Prussian War, was defeated and was annexed by Prussia.

Hanover was little affected by the revolutions of 1848; a few small disturbances were put down by the cavalry without bloodshed. When agitators arrived from Berlin at the end of May 1848 and there were demonstrations outside the King&#x27;s palace, Ernest sent out the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister warned that, if the demonstrators made any inappropriate demands on the King, Ernest would pack up his things and leave for Britain, taking the Crown Prince with him. This would leave the country at the mercy of expansionist Prussia and the threat put an end to the agitation. Afterwards, the King granted a new constitution, somewhat more liberal than the 1819 document.

=== Relations with Britain ===
Ernest Augustus is supposed to have asked the advice of the Duke of Wellington as to what course he should take after Victoria&#x27;s accession, with Wellington supposedly saying &quot;Go before you are pelted out.&quot; However, Bird dismisses this story as unlikely, given Wellington&#x27;s customary respect to royalty and the fact that Ernest had little choice in what to do—he had to go to his kingdom as quickly as possible. One decision the new king did have to make was whether, in his capacity as Duke of Cumberland, to swear allegiance to Victoria in the House of Lords. Shortly after William&#x27;s death, Ernest heard from Lord Lyndhurst that Lord Cottenham, the Lord Chancellor, had stated that he would refuse to administer the Oath of Allegiance to the King, as a foreign sovereign. The King hurriedly appeared in the House of Lords, before his departure for Hanover, and subscribed to the Oath before the Chief Clerk as a matter of routine. Ernest was heir presumptive to Queen Victoria until the birth of her daughter Victoria, Princess Royal, in November 1840. The Lord Privy Seal, Lord Clarendon, wrote, &quot;What the country cares about is to have a life more, whether male or female, between the succession and the King of Hanover.&quot;

Almost immediately upon going to Hanover, the King became involved in a dispute with his niece. Queen Victoria had a strained relationship with her mother Victoria, Duchess of Kent, and wanted to give the Duchess accommodation near her, for the sake of appearances—but not too near her. To that end, she asked the King to give up his apartments at St James&#x27;s Palace in favour of the Duchess. The King, wishing to retain apartments in London in anticipation of frequent visits to England and reluctant to give way in favour of a woman who had frequently fought with his brother, King William, declined and the Queen angrily rented a house for her mother. At a time when the Queen was trying to pay off her father&#x27;s debts, she saw this as an unnecessary expense. Her ill-feeling towards the King increased when he refused, and advised his two surviving brothers to refuse as well, to give precedence to her intended husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Ernest argued that the standing of the various royal families had been settled at the Congress of Vienna and that the King of Hanover should not have to yield to one whom he described as a &quot;paper Royal Highness&quot;. The act which naturalised Albert as a British subject left the question of his precedence unresolved.

Matters came to a head when Ernest returned for what would prove to be his only visit to England as King of Hanover, in 1843. He was welcomed warmly, everywhere but at the Palace. At the wedding of Princess Augusta of Cambridge, he attempted to insist on a superior place to that of Prince Albert. The prince, 48 years Ernest&#x27;s junior, settled things with what Albert described as a &quot;strong push&quot; and carefully wrote his name on the certificate under the Queen&#x27;s, so close to his wife&#x27;s as to leave no space for the King&#x27;s signature. The King apparently held no grudge, as he invited the prince for a stroll in the park. When Albert demurred on the grounds that they might be jostled by crowds, the King replied, &quot;When I lived here I was quite as unpopular as you are and they never bothered me.&quot; Shortly after the wedding, the King injured himself in a fall, with Albert writing to his brother, &quot;Happily he fell over some stones in Kew and damaged some ribs.&quot; This injury spared him further contact with Victoria and Albert. During his visit, the King found time to take his place as Duke of Cumberland in the House of Lords. Victoria recorded in her journal that the King had stated when asked if he would speak in the Lords, &quot;No, I shall not, unless the Devil prompts me!&quot; The Queen also recorded that though the King greatly enjoyed listening to the debates, he did not himself speak. The King made a point of welcoming British visitors to Hanover and when one Englishwoman told him that she had been lost in the city, the King denied that this was possible, as &quot;the whole country is no larger than a fourpenny bit.&quot;

The monarchs engaged in one more battle—over jewels left by Queen Charlotte. Queen Victoria, who possessed them, took the position that they belonged to the British Crown. King Ernest maintained that they were to go to the heir male, that is, himself. The matter was arbitrated, and just as the arbitrators were about to announce a decision in Hanover&#x27;s favour, one of the arbitrators died, voiding the decision. Despite the King&#x27;s request for a new panel, Victoria refused to permit one during the King&#x27;s lifetime and took every opportunity to wear the jewels, causing the King to write to his friend, Lord Strangford,
&quot;The little Queen looked very fine, I hear, loaded down with &quot;my&quot; diamonds.&quot; The King&#x27;s son and successor, King George V, pressed the matter, and in 1858, after another decision in Hanover&#x27;s favour, the jewels were turned over to the Hanoverian ambassador.

== Later life, death, and memorial ==

In 1851, the King undertook a number of journeys around Germany. He accepted an invitation from the Queen of Prussia to visit Charlottenburg Palace, near Berlin. He visited Mecklenburg for the christening of the Grand Duke&#x27;s son and Lüneburg to inspect his old regiment. In June, Ernest celebrated his 80th birthday by playing host to the King of Prussia. Late that summer, he visited Göttingen, where he opened a new hospital and was given a torchlight procession.

The King continued his interest in British affairs and wrote to Lord Strangford about the Great Exhibition of 1851:
The folly and absurdity of the Queen in allowing this trumpery must strike every sensible and well-thinking mind, and I am astonished the ministers themselves do not insist on her at least going to Osborne during the Exhibition, as no human being can possibly answer for what may occur on the occasion. The idea ... must shock every honest and well-meaning Englishman. But it seems everything is conspiring to lower us in the eyes of Europe.
The King died on 18 November 1851 after an illness of about a month. He was mourned greatly in Hanover; less so in the United Kingdom, where &quot;The Times&quot; omitted the customary black border to its front page and claimed &quot;the good that can be said of the Royal dead is little or none.&quot; Both he and Queen Frederica rest in a mausoleum in the Berggarten of Herrenhausen Gardens.

A large equestrian statue of King Ernest Augustus may be found in a square named after him in front of Hanover Central Station, inscribed with his name and the words (in German) &quot;To the father of the nation from his loyal people.&quot; It is a popular meeting place; in the local phrase, people arrange to meet &quot;unterm Schwanz&quot; or &quot;under the tail&quot;.

Although &quot;The Times&quot; denigrated Ernest&#x27;s career as Duke of Cumberland, it did speak well of his time as King of Hanover and of his success in keeping Hanover stable in 1848:
Above all, he possessed a resolute decision of character, which, however unfortunately it may have operated under different conditions, appeared to extraordinary advantage at the crisis of continental thrones. Bewildered by the revolutionary din, and oscillating ignominiously between fear and rage, resistance and concession, the clique of crowned heads suffered greatly by contrast with a Sovereign who at least knew his own mind and was prepared to abide by his opinions. In the European convulsions, therefore, King Ernest maintained the stability of his throne and the tranquillity of his people without damage from revolution or reaction. As Kings, indeed, are computed on the continent, he was an able and even a popular Monarch, and his memory may find, perhaps, in his ancestral dominions a sympathy which it would be vain to bespeak for it in the scenes of his manhood or the land of his birth.

<text>Stalemate is a situation in chess where the player whose turn it is to move is not in check and has no legal move. Stalemate results in a draw. During the endgame, stalemate is a resource that can enable the player with the inferior position to draw the game rather than lose. In more complex positions, stalemate is much rarer, usually taking the form of a swindle that succeeds only if the superior side is inattentive. Stalemate is also a common theme in endgame studies and other chess problems.

The outcome of a stalemate was standardized as a draw in the 19th century . Before this standardization, its treatment varied widely, including being deemed a win for the stalemating player, a half-win for that player, or a loss for that player; not being permitted; and resulting in the stalemated player missing a turn. Stalemate rules vary in variants and other games of the chess family.
==Etymology and usage==
The first recorded use of stalemate is from 1765. It is a compounding of Middle English &quot;stale&quot; and &quot;mate&quot; (meaning checkmate). &quot;Stale&quot; is probably derived from Anglo-French &quot;estale&quot; meaning &quot;standstill&quot;, a cognate of &quot;stand&quot; and &quot;stall&quot;, both ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*sta-&quot;. The first recorded use in a figurative sense is in 1885.

Stalemate has become a widely used metaphor for other situations where there is a conflict or contest between two parties, such as war or political negotiations, and neither side is able to achieve victory, resulting in what is also called an impasse, a deadlock, or a Mexican standoff. Chess writers note that this usage is a misnomer because, unlike in chess, the situation is often a temporary one that is ultimately resolved, even if it seems currently intractable. The term &quot;stalemate&quot; is sometimes used incorrectly as a generic term for a draw in chess. While draws are common, they are rarely the direct result of stalemate.

==Examples==

With Black to move, Black is stalemated in diagrams 1 to 5. Stalemate is an important factor in the endgame – the endgame setup in diagram 1, for example, quite frequently is relevant in play (see King and pawn versus king endgame). The position in diagram 1 occurred in an 1898 game between Amos Burn and Harry Pillsbury and also in a 1925 game between Savielly Tartakower and Richard Réti. The same position, except shifted to the e-, occurred in a 2009 game between Gata Kamsky and Vladimir Kramnik.

The position in diagram 3 is an example of a pawn drawing against a queen. Stalemates of this sort can often save a player from losing an apparently hopeless position (see Queen versus pawn endgame).

The position in diagram 5 is a special kind of stalemate, in which no move is possible even if one ignores the need to avoid self-check. George P. Jelliss has called this type of stalemate a deadlock. Adding a White knight on f2 would produce a checklock: a checkmate position where no moves are possible, even if one ignores the need to avoid self-check. In general, positions with no moves at all available (even ignoring the need to avoid self-check) are called locks.
===Examples from games=== 

====Anand versus Kramnik====

In this position from the game Viswanathan Anand–Vladimir Kramnik from the 2007 World Chess Championship, Black played 65...Kxf5, stalemating White. (Any other move by Black loses.)
====Korchnoi versus Karpov====

An intentional stalemate occurred on the 124th move of the fifth game of the 1978 World Championship match between Viktor Korchnoi and Anatoly Karpov. The game had been a theoretical draw for many moves. White&#x27;s bishop is useless; it cannot defend the queening square at a8 nor attack the black pawn on the light a4-square. If the white king heads towards the black pawn, the black king can move towards a8 and set up a fortress.

The players were not on speaking terms, however, so neither would offer a draw by agreement. On his 124th move, White played 124.Bg7, delivering stalemate. Korchnoi said that it gave him pleasure to stalemate Karpov and that it was slightly humiliating. Until 2021, this was the longest game played in a World Chess Championship final match, as well as the only World Championship game to end in stalemate before 2007.
====Bernstein versus Smyslov====
Sometimes, a surprise stalemate saves a game. In the game Ossip Bernstein–Vasily Smyslov (first diagram), Black can win by sacrificing the f-pawn and using the king to support the b-pawn. However, Smyslov thought it was good to advance the b-pawn because he could win the white rook with a skewer if it captured the pawn. Play went:

:59... b2 60. Rxb2
Now 60...Rh2+ 61.Kf3! Rxb2 would be stalemate (second diagram). Smyslov played 60...Kg4, and the game was drawn after 61.Kf1 (see Rook and pawn versus rook endgame).
====Matulović versus Minev====
Whereas the possibility of stalemate arose in the Bernstein–Smyslov game because of a blunder, it can also arise without one, as in the game Milan Matulović–Nikolay Minev (first diagram). Play continued:

:1. Rc6 Kg5 2. Kh3 Kh5 3. f4
The only meaningful attempt to make progress. Now all moves by Black (like 3...Ra3+) lose, with one exception.

:3... Rxa6!
Now 4.Rxa6 would be stalemate. White played 4.Rc5+ instead, and the game was drawn several moves later.
====Williams versus Harrwitz====
In the game Elijah Williams–Daniel Harrwitz (first diagram), Black was up a knight and a pawn in an endgame. This would normally be a decisive advantage, but Black could find no way to make progress because of various stalemate resources available to White. The game continued:

:72... Ra8 73. Rc1
Avoiding the threatened 73...Nc2+.

:73... Ke3 74. Rc4 Ra4 75. Rc1 Kd2 76. Rc4 Kd3
76...Nc2+ 77.Rxc2+! Kxc2 is stalemate.

:77. Rc3+! Kd4
77...Kxc3 is stalemate.

:78. Rc1 Ra3 79. Rd1+ Kc5
79...Rd3 80.Rxd3+! leaves Black with either insufficient material to win after 80...Nxd3 81.Kxa2 or a standard fortress in a corner draw after 80...Kxd3.

:80. Rc1+ Kb5 81. Rc7 Nd5 82. Rc2 Nc3?? 83. Rb2+ Kc4 84. Rb3! (see second diagram)
Now the players agreed to a draw, since 84...Kxb3 or 84...Rxb3 is stalemate, as is 84...Ra8 85.Rxc3+! Kxc3.

Black could still have won the game until his critical mistake on move 82. Instead of 82...Nc3, 82...Nb4 wins; for example, after 83.Rc8 Re3 84.Rb8+ Kc5 85.Rc8+ Kd5 86.Rd8+ Kc6 87.Ra8 Re1+ 88.Kb2 Kc5 89.Kc3 a1=Q+, Black wins.

====Carlsen versus Van Wely====

This 2007 game, Magnus Carlsen–Loek van Wely, ended in stalemate. White used the second-rank defense in a rook and bishop versus rook endgame for 46 moves. The fifty-move rule was about to come into effect, under which White could claim a draw. The game ended:

:109. Rd2+ Bxd2 
White was stalemated.
===More complex examples===

Although stalemate usually occurs in the endgame, it can also occur with more pieces on the board. Outside of relatively simple endgame positions, such as those above, stalemate occurs rarely, usually when the side with the superior position has overlooked the possibility of stalemate. This is typically realized by the inferior side&#x27;s sacrifice of one or more pieces in order to force stalemate. A piece that is offered as a sacrifice to bring about stalemate is sometimes called a &quot;desperado&quot;.

====Evans versus Reshevsky====
One of the best-known examples of the desperado is the game Larry Evans–Samuel Reshevsky that was dubbed &quot;The Swindle of the Century&quot;. Evans sacrificed his queen on move 49 and offered his rook on move 50. White&#x27;s rook has been called the &quot;eternal rook&quot;. Capturing it results in stalemate, but otherwise it stays on the seventh and checks Black&#x27;s king &quot;ad infinitum&quot; (i.e. perpetual check). The game would inevitably end in a draw by agreement, by threefold repetition, or by an eventual claim under the fifty-move rule.

:47. h4! Re2+ 48. Kh1 Qxg3??
After 48...Qg6! 49.Rf8 Qe6! 50.Rh8+ Kg6, Black remains a piece ahead after 51.Qxe6 Nxe6, or after 51.gxf4 Re1+ and 52...Qa2+.

:49. Qg8+! Kxg8 50. Rxg7+!
====Gelfand versus Kramnik====

The position at right occurred in Boris Gelfand–Vladimir Kramnik, 1994 FIDE Candidates match, game 6, in Sanghi Nagar, India. Kramnik, down two pawns and on the defensive, would be very happy with a draw. Gelfand has just played 67. Re4–e7 (first diagram), a strong-looking move that threatens 68.Qxf6, winning a third pawn, or 68.Rc7, further constricting Black. Black responded 67... Qc1 If White takes Black&#x27;s undefended rook with 68.Qxd8, Black&#x27;s desperado queen forces the draw with 68...Qh1+ 69.Kg3 Qh2+!, compelling 70.Kxh2 stalemate (second diagram). If White avoids the stalemate with 68.Rxg7+ Kxg7 69.Qxd8, Black draws by perpetual check with 69...Qh1+ 70.Kg3 Qg1+ 71.Kf4 Qc1+! 72.Ke4 Qc6+! 73.Kd3 (73.d5 Qc4+; 73.Qd5 Qc2+) Qxf3+! 74.Kd2 Qg2+! 75.Kc3 Qc6+ 76.Kb4 Qb5+ 77.Ka3 Qd3+. Gelfand played 68. d5 instead but still only drew.
====Troitsky versus Vogt====
In Troitsky–, 1896, the famous endgame study composer Alexey Troitsky pulled off an elegant swindle in actual play. After Troitsky&#x27;s 1. Rd1!, Black fell into the trap with the seemingly crushing 1... Bh3?, threatening 2...Qg2#. The game concluded 2. Rxd8+ Kxd8 3. Qd1+! Qxd1 stalemate. White&#x27;s bishop, knight, and f-pawn are all pinned and unable to move.
==In studies==
Stalemate is a frequent theme in endgame studies and other chess compositions. An example is the &quot;White to Play and Draw&quot; study at right, composed by the American master Frederick Rhine and published in 2006. White saves a draw with 1. Ne5+! Black wins after 1.Nb4+? Kb5! or 1.Qe8+? Bxe8 2.Ne5+ Kb5! 3.Rxb2+ Nb3. 1... Bxe5 After 1...Kb5? 2.Rxb2+ Nb3 3.Rxc4! Qxe3 (best; 3...Qb8+ 4.Kd7 Qxh8 5.Rxb3+ forces checkmate) 4.Rxb3+! Qxb3 5.Qh1! Bf5+ 6.Kd8!, White is winning. 2. Qe8+! 2.Qxe5? Qb7+ 3.Kd8 Qd7#. 2... Bxe8 3. Rh6+ Bd6 3...Kb5 4.Rxb6+ Kxb6 5.Nxc4+ also leads to a drawn endgame. Not 5.Rxb2+? Bxb2 6.Nc4+ Kb5 7.Nxb2 Bh5! trapping White&#x27;s knight. 4. Rxd6+! Kxd6 5. Nxc4+! Nxc4 6. Rxb6+ Nxb6+ Moving the king is actually a better try, but the resulting endgame of two knights and a bishop against a rook is a well-established theoretical draw. 7. Kd8! (rightmost diagram) Black is three pieces ahead, but if White is allowed to take the bishop, the two knights are insufficient to force checkmate. The only way to save the bishop is to move it, resulting in stalemate. A similar idea occasionally enables the inferior side to save a draw in the ending of bishop, knight, and king versus lone king.

At right is a composition by A. J. Roycroft which was published in the &quot;British Chess Magazine&quot; in 1957. White draws with 1. c7! after which there are two main lines:
*1... f5 2. c8=Q (if 2.c8=R? then 2...Bc3 3.Rxc3 Qg7#) 2... Bc3 3. Qxf5+ draws by stalemate.
*1... g5 (1...Ka1 2.c8=R transposes) 2. c8=R (2.c8=Q? Ka1 3.Qc2 [or 3.Qc1+] b1=Q+ wins) 2... Ka1 (2...Ng6 3.Rc1+ forces Black to capture, stalemating White) 3. Rc2!! (not 3.Rc1+?? b1=Q+! 4.Rxb1+ Bxb1#; now White threatens 4.Rxb2 and 5.Rxa2+, forcing stalemate or perpetual check) 3... Bc4 (trying to get in a check; 3...b1=Q, 3...b1=B, and 3...Bb1 are all stalemate; 3...Ng6 4.Rc1+!) 4. Rc1+ Ka2 5. Ra1+ Kb3 6. Ra3+ Kc2 7. Rc3+ Kd2 8. Rc2+ (rightmost diagram). As in Evans–Reshevsky, Black cannot escape the &quot;eternal rook&quot;.
==In problems==
Some chess problems require &quot;White to move and stalemate Black in &quot;n&quot; moves&quot; (rather than the more common &quot;White to move and checkmate Black in &quot;n&quot; moves&quot;). Problemists have also tried to construct the shortest possible game ending in stalemate. Sam Loyd devised one just ten moves long: 1.e3 a5 2.Qh5 Ra6 3.Qxa5 h5 4.Qxc7 Rah6 5.h4 f6 6.Qxd7+ Kf7 7.Qxb7 Qd3 8.Qxb8 Qh7 9.Qxc8 Kg6 10.Qe6 (first diagram). A similar stalemate is reached after: 1.d4 c5 2.dxc5 f6 3.Qxd7+ Kf7 4.Qxd8 Bf5 5.Qxb8 h5 6.Qxa8 Rh6 7.Qxb7 a6 8.Qxa6 Bh7 9.h4 Kg6 10.Qe6 (Frederick Rhine).

Loyd also demonstrated that stalemate can occur with all the pieces on the board: 1.d4 d6 2.Qd2 e5 3.a4 e4 4.Qf4 f5 5.h3 Be7 6.Qh2 Be6 7.Ra3 c5 8.Rg3 Qa5+ 9.Nd2 Bh4 10.f3 Bb3 11.d5 e3 12.c4 f4 (second diagram). Games such as this are occasionally played in tournaments as a pre-arranged draw.
===Double stalemate===

There are chess compositions featuring double stalemate. To the right are two double stalemate positions, in which neither side has a legal move. An example from actual play is given below:
White played 1. Ngxf6+ Qxf6+ (if 1...exf6 then 2.Ne7#) 2. Nxf6+ exf6 3. c4 c5 4. a4 a5, leaving a double stalemate position. 1.Ndxf6+ would not have worked, for then 1...exf6 is possible. (Under the present rules, the game would have ended after 1...Qxf6+, as the position is then dead: no sequence of legal moves leads to either side being checkmated.)

The fastest known game ending in a double stalemate position was discovered by Enzo Minerva and published in the Italian newspaper &quot;l&#x27;Unità&quot; on 14 August 2007: 1.c4 d5 2.Qb3 Bh3 3.gxh3 f5 4.Qxb7 Kf7 5.Qxa7 Kg6 6.f3 c5 7.Qxe7 Rxa2 8.Kf2 Rxb2 9.Qxg7+ Kh5 10.Qxg8 Rxb1 11.Rxb1 Kh4 12.Qxh8 h5 13.Qh6 Bxh6 14.Rxb8 Be3+ 15.dxe3 Qxb8 16.Kg2 Qf4 17.exf4 d4 18.Be3 dxe3.
==History of the stalemate rule==
The stalemate rule has had a convoluted history. Although stalemate is universally recognized as a draw today, that was not the case for much of the game&#x27;s history. In the forerunners to modern chess, such as chaturanga, delivering stalemate resulted in a loss. This was changed in shatranj, however, where stalemating was a win. This practice persisted in chess as played in early 15th-century Spain. Lucena (c. 1497), however, treated stalemate as an inferior form of victory; it won only half the stake in games played for money, and this continued to be the case in Spain as late as 1600. From about 1600 to 1800, the rule in England was that stalemate was a for the player administering it, a rule that the eminent chess historian H. J. R. Murray believes may have been adopted from Russian chess. That rule disappeared in England before 1820, being replaced by the French and Italian rule that a stalemate was a drawn game.

Throughout history, a stalemate has at various times been:
* in 10th century Arabia and parts of medieval Europe.
* In a game played for stakes, the stalemating player would win half the stake (18th century Spain).
* in 9th century India, 17th century Russia, on the Central Plain of Europe in the 17th century, and 17th–18th century England. This rule continued to be published in &quot;Hoyle&#x27;s Games Improved&quot; as late as 1866.
*. If White made a move that would stalemate Black, he had to retract it and make a different move (Eastern Asia until the early 20th century). Murray likewise wrote that in Hindustani chess and Parsi chess, two of the three principal forms of chess played in India as of 1913, a player was not allowed to play a move that would stalemate the opponent. The same was true of Burmese chess, another chess variant, at the time of writing. Stalemate was not permitted in most of the Eastern Asiatic forms of the game (specifically in Burma, India, Japan, and Siam) until early in the 20th century.
* (medieval France), although other medieval French sources treat stalemate as a draw.
*. This was the rule in 13th-century Italy and also stated in the German &quot;Cracow Poem&quot; (1422), that noted, however, that some players treated stalemate as equivalent to checkmate. This rule was ultimately adopted throughout Europe, but not in England until the 19th century, after being introduced there by Jacob Sarratt.

==Proposed rule change==
Periodically, writers have argued that stalemate should again be made a win for the side causing the stalemate, on the grounds that the goal of chess is conceptually to capture the king and checkmate merely ends it when this is inevitable. Grandmaster Larry Kaufman writes, &quot;In my view, calling stalemate a draw is totally illogical, since it represents the ultimate zugzwang, where any move would get your king taken&quot;. The British master T. H. Tylor argued in a 1940 article in the &quot;British Chess Magazine&quot; that the present rule, treating stalemate as a draw, &quot;is without historical foundation and irrational, and primarily responsible for a vast percentage of draws, and hence should be abolished&quot;. Years later, Fred Reinfeld wrote, &quot;When Tylor wrote his attack on the stalemate rule, he released about his unhappy head a swarm of peevish maledictions that are still buzzing.&quot; Larry Evans calls the proposal to make stalemate a win for the stalemating player a &quot;crude proposal that ... would radically alter centuries of tradition and make chess boring&quot;. This rule change would cause a greater emphasis on ; an extra pawn would be a greater advantage than it is today.
However, Kaufman tested the idea of scoring stalemates higher than draws with the chess engine Komodo, and found that the impact is quite small because it is rare to be able to force stalemate but not checkmate: while all king and pawn versus king endgames become wins when the pawn is protected (except when the attacking king is trapped in front of its own rook pawn), this does not turn out to be common enough. The problem is that king and lone minor piece against king cannot force stalemate in general. Emanuel Lasker and Richard Réti proposed that both stalemate &quot;and&quot; king and minor versus king (with the minor piece side to move) should give ¾ points to the superior side: this would effectively restore not only the old stalemate rule but also the old bare king rule. Kaufman and correspondence grandmaster Arno Nickel have proposed going even further, and giving only ¼ point as well to the side that brings about a threefold repetition (which likewise has precedents in xiangqi, shogi, and Go). According to his tests with Komodo, chess at the level of a human World Championship match would have a draw rate of 65.6%; scoring stalemate as ¾–¼ reduces the draw rate to 63.4%; scoring stalemate &quot;and&quot; bare king as ¾–¼ brings it to 55.9%; and scoring stalemate, bare king, &quot;and&quot; threefold repetition as ¾–¼ brings it all the way down to 22.6%. (The same reduction of draws would occur if stalemate, bare king, and threefold repetition were scored as 1–0 instead of ¾–¼, but the point of the ¾–¼ scoring is to allow the weaker side to still benefit from avoiding checkmate, while giving the stronger side something to play for even when checkmate cannot be attained.)

Jelliss has suggested that under the logic that stalemate should be a win (since any move would get the king taken), checklock should be a draw. (In a checklock position, no forward play is possible even if exposing the king to check is valid, so the king cannot get captured. The same logic would apply to deadlock.)
===Effect on endgame theory===
If stalemate were a loss for the player unable to move, the outcome of some endgames would be affected. In some situations the superior side can force stalemate but not checkmate. In others, the defending player can use stalemate as a defensive technique to avoid losing (under the current rule): 
*The endgame of king and pawn versus king would always be a win when the pawn can be protected (except in the singular case of a king trapped in front of its own rook pawn, which is diagram 1 below). In all other cases, either the pawn can be promoted or the defending king can be forced into a stalemate (see diagram 2 below).
**An unusual position is given to the right; it is a draw under orthodox rules, but if stalemate is deemed to be a win, then Black to play wins by 1...Rh8! (Taking the rook gets White stalemated after 2.Kxh8 Kf7 or 2...Kf8, and if White refuses the sacrifice, Black can force White to abandon the pawn with 2.Kg6 Kf8 3.Kh6 Kf7 or 2.Kh6 Kf7, leaving a basic checkmate.)
*Two knights and a king can force stalemate against a lone king (See Two knights endgame).
*A plus a bishop on the color opposite the pawn&#x27;s queening square would be a win instead of a draw, because the defending king can be forced into stalemate (see diagram 3 below). (See Wrong rook pawn).
*A king and rook versus a king and bishop would be a win for the side with the rook because the superior side can force stalemate (see diagram 4 below). (The same is not true for a rook versus knight.)
*If the defending king is cornered, a single bishop or knight may be able to stalemate the king, although these cannot be forced in general.
*The defensive drawing techniques with a or on the seventh with its king nearby versus a queen would not work, because they rely on stalemate . (See Queen versus pawn endgame.)
*Positions such as the Saavedra position, which would normally require an underpromotion due to the fact that a queen would stalemate the opponent, no longer require an underpromotion. (In fact, underpromotion to rook or bishop would no longer be necessary in chess.)


The effect if stalemates were to be scored as ¾–¼ would be similar but less severe, as then the weaker side would still be rewarded somewhat for avoiding checkmate via stalemate, just not as much as before.

==Rules in other chess variants==
Not all variants of chess consider the stalemate to be a draw. Many regional variants, as well some variants of Western chess, have adopted their own rules on how to treat the stalemated player. In chaturanga, which is widely considered to be the common ancestor of all variants of chess, a stalemate was a win for the stalemated player. Around the 7th century, this game was adopted in the Middle East as shatranj with very similar rules to its predecessor; however, the stalemate rule was changed to its exact opposite: i.e. it was a win for the player delivering the stalemate. This game was in turn introduced to the Western world, where it would eventually evolve to modern-day Western chess, although the stalemate rule for Western chess was not standardized as a draw until the 19th century (see history of the rule).

===Modern Asian variants===
Chaturanga also evolved into several other games in various regions of Asia, all of which have varying rules on stalemating:
* In makruk (Thai chess), a stalemate results in a draw, like in Western chess.
* In shogi (Japanese chess) and the majority of its variants, a stalemate is a win for the player delivering the stalemate. However, in shogi (and in any variant of the game that features drops), stalemates are extremely rare due to the fact that no piece ever goes entirely out of play.
* In xiangqi (Chinese chess) it results in an immediate loss for the stalemated player (like in shogi), and there is no explicit distinction between it and checkmate. 
* In janggi (Korean chess), uniquely among modern chess variants, players are allowed to pass their turn at any time. Consequently, there are no stalemates, only positions in which the only legal move is to pass. (In fact, Korean chess does not even have draws, and is the only competitively played version of chess where that is the case: under the official South Korean tournament rules, in positions that would otherwise be draws, points are tallied up for the pieces and pawns remaining on the board, with the player moving second being given 1.5 points to compensate for the first-move advantage. Since every piece and pawn is given an integer number of points, the result can never be a draw.)
* In sittuyin (Myanmar/Burmese chess), stalemates are avoided altogether, as delivering them is illegal. Players are not allowed to leave the opponent with no legal moves without putting the king into check.
* In shatar (Mongolian chess), stalemate is a loss for the stalemated player, like in xiangqi and shogi. Jean-Louis Cazaux and Rick Knowlton explain it as follows: &quot;the loss of liberty is considered equal to death by the Mongolian nomadic culture&quot;.

===Western chess variants===
The majority of variants of Western chess do not specify any alterations to the rule of stalemate. There are some variants, however, where the rule specified to differ from that of standard chess:
* In losing chess, the stalemate rule varies depending on the version being played. According to the &quot;international&quot; rules, a stalemate is simply a win for the stalemated player. The Free Internet Chess Server, however, grants a win to the player with fewer pieces remaining on the board (regardless of who delivered the stalemate); if both players have the same number of pieces it is a draw. There is also a &quot;joint&quot; FICS/international rule, according to which a stalemate is only a win if both sources agree that it is a win (i.e. it counts as a win for the stalemated player if that player also happens to have fewer pieces remaining); in all other cases it is a draw.
* In Gliński&#x27;s hexagonal chess, stalemate is neither a draw nor a full win. Instead, in tournament games, the player who delivers the stalemate earns ¾ point, while the stalemated player receives ¼ point. It is unknown whether a stalemate should be considered a draw or a win in a .

<text>Buddleja (; Buddleia; also historically given as Buddlea) is a genus comprising over 140 species of flowering plants endemic to Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The generic name bestowed by Linnaeus posthumously honoured the Reverend Adam Buddle (1662–1715), an English botanist and rector, at the suggestion of William Houstoun. Houstoun sent the first plants to become known to science as buddleja (&quot;B. americana&quot;) to England from the Caribbean about 15 years after Buddle&#x27;s death. &quot;Buddleja&quot; species, especially &quot;Buddleja davidii&quot; and interspecific hybrids, are commonly known as butterfly bushes and are frequently cultivated as garden shrubs. &quot;Buddleja davidii&quot; has become an invasive species in both Europe and North America.

==Nomenclature==
The botanic name has been the source of some confusion. By modern practice of botanical Latin, the spelling of a generic name made from &quot;Buddle&quot; would be &quot;Buddleia&quot;, but Linnaeus in his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; of 1753 and 1754 spelled it &quot;Buddleja&quot;, with the long &quot;i&quot; between two vowels, common in early modern orthography. The pronunciation of the long &quot;i&quot; in &quot;Buddleja&quot; as &quot;j&quot; is a common modern error. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature has gradually changed to incorporate stricter rules about orthographic variants and as of the 2006 edition requires (article 60, particularly 60.5) that Linnaeus&#x27; spelling should be followed in this case.

==Classification==
The genus &quot;Buddleja&quot; is now included in Scrophulariaceae, having earlier been classified under Buddlejaceae (synonym: Oftiaceae) and Loganiaceae

==Description==
Of the approximately 140 species, nearly all are shrubs less than tall, but a few qualify as trees, the largest reaching . Both evergreen and deciduous species occur, in tropical and temperate regions respectively. The leaves are lanceolate in most species, and arranged in opposite pairs on the stems (alternate in one species, &quot;B. alternifolia&quot;); they range from long. The flowers of the Asiatic species are mostly produced in terminal panicles long; the American species more commonly as cymes forming small, globose heads. Each individual flower is tubular and divided into four spreading lobes (petals) about across, the corolla length ranging from around 10 mm in the Asiatics to 3–30 mm in the American species, the wider variation in the latter because some South American species have evolved long red flowers to attract hummingbirds, rather than insects, as exclusive pollinators.

The colour of the flowers varies widely, from mostly pastel pinks and blues in Asia, to vibrant yellows and reds in the New World, while many cultivars have deeper tones. The flowers are generally rich in nectar and often strongly honey-scented. The fruit is a small capsule about long and diameter, containing numerous small seeds; in a few species (previously classified in the separate genus &quot;Nicodemia&quot;) the capsule is soft and fleshy, forming a berry.

==Distribution==
The genus is found in four continents. Over 60 species are native through the New World from the southern United States to southern Chile, while many other species are found in the Old World, in Africa, and parts of Asia, but all are absent as natives from Europe and Australasia. The species are divided into three groups based on their floral type: those in the New World are mostly dioecious (occasionally hermaphrodite or trioecious), while those in the Old World are exclusively hermaphrodite with perfect flowers.

==Cultivation and uses==
As garden shrubs, buddlejas are essentially 20th-century plants, with the exception of &quot;B. globosa&quot; which was introduced to Britain from southern Chile in 1774 and disseminated from the nursery of Lee and Kennedy, Hammersmith. Several species are popular garden plants and are commonly known as &quot;butterfly bushes&quot;, owing to their attractiveness to butterflies, and have become staples of the modern butterfly garden; they are also attractive to bees and moths.

The most popular cultivated species is &quot;Buddleja davidii&quot; from central China, named for the French Basque missionary and naturalist Père Armand David. Other common garden species include the aforementioned &quot;B. globosa&quot;, grown for its strongly honey-scented orange globular inflorescences, and the weeping &quot;Buddleja alternifolia&quot;. Several interspecific hybrids have been made, notably &quot;B.&quot; &#x27;Lochinch&#x27; (&quot;B. davidii&quot; × &quot;B. fallowiana&quot;) and &quot;B. × weyeriana&quot; (&quot;B. globosa&quot; × &quot;B. davidii&quot;), the latter a cross between a South American and an Asiatic species.

Some species commonly escape from the garden. &quot;B. davidii&quot; in particular is an extensive coloniser of dry open ground. In urban areas in the United Kingdom, it often self-sows on waste ground or old masonry, where it grows into a dense thicket. A number of agricultural organizations and governing authorities throughout the world have designated the plant as an invasive species or a noxious weed. It is frequently seen in the United Kingdom beside railway lines, on the sites of derelict factories and other buildings and, in the aftermath of World War II, on urban bomb sites. That earned it the popular nickname of &quot;the bomb site plant&quot;.

Popular garden cultivars include &#x27;Royal Red&#x27; (reddish-purple flowers), &#x27;Black Knight&#x27; (very dark purple), &#x27;Sungold&#x27; (golden yellow), and &#x27;Pink Delight&#x27; (pure pink). In recent years, much breeding work has been undertaken to create seed sterile cultivars (see &quot;Non-invasive&quot; Buddleja cultivars). This is a particularly important consideration in the United States, where several states have banned &quot;B. davidii&quot; and its fertile cultivars because of their invasiveness.

==List of species and naturally occurring hybrids==
The many species of &quot;Buddleja&quot; have been the subject of much taxonomic contention. The listing below includes the names, still prevalent in horticulture, of many former Asiatic species sunk by the late Toon Leeuwenberg as &quot;Buddleja crispa&quot; and adopted as such in the definitive &quot;Flora of China&quot;.

<text>Eric Michael Bogosian (; born April 24, 1953) is an American actor, playwright, monologuist, novelist, and historian. Descended from Armenian-American immigrants, he grew up in Watertown and Woburn, Massachusetts, and attended the University of Chicago and Oberlin College. His play &quot;Talk Radio,&quot; was a finalist for the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Bogosian also wrote and starred in the 1988 film adaptation, for which he won a Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival.

As an actor, he has appeared in plays, films, and television series throughout his career. His television roles include Captain Danny Ross in &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; (2006–10), Lawrence Boyd on &quot;Billions&quot; (2017–18), Daniel Molloy on &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (2022–present), and Gil Eavis on &quot;Succession&quot; (2018–23). He also starred as Arno in the Safdie brothers&#x27; film &quot;Uncut Gems&quot; (2019).

Bogosian has also been involved in New York City ballet production, and has written several novels as well as the historical nonfiction &quot;Operation Nemesis&quot; (2015), based on the program to assassinate perpetrators of the Armenian genocide. He is a three-time Obie Award and a Drama Desk Award winner, and two-time fellow of the National Endowment for the Arts.

==Early life==
Eric Bogosian () was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Edwina (née Jamgochian), a hairdresser and instructor, and Henry Bogosian, an accountant. He spent his early childhood in Watertown, Massachusetts, home to a large Armenian-American community which included his grandparents, survivors of the Armenian genocide. His family moved to nearby Woburn in 1960. He became interested in theater while attending Woburn Memorial High School, and would later base his play &quot;subUrbia&quot; on his youth in Woburn&#x27;s Four Corners neighborhood. He attended the University of Chicago before graduating from Oberlin College.

==Career==
Bogosian is an author and actor known for his plays &quot;Talk Radio&quot; and &quot;subUrbia&quot;, as well as numerous one-man shows. In 1983, early in his career, Bogosian appeared in the music video for Jim Capaldi&#x27;s song &quot;That&#x27;s Love&quot;. In recent years he has starred on Broadway in Donald Margulies&#x27; &quot;Time Stands Still&quot;, published three novels, and was featured on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; as Captain Danny Ross.

===Stage===
Between 1980 and 2000, six major solos written and performed by Bogosian were produced Off-Broadway, garnering him three Obie Awards as well as the Drama Desk award. His first two solos, &quot;Men Inside&quot; and &quot;funHouse&quot; were presented at the New York Shakespeare Festival. His third, &quot;Drinking in America&quot;, was produced by American Place Theater. &quot;Sex, Drugs, Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, &quot;Pounding Nails in the Floor with My Forehead&quot; and &quot;Wake Up and Smell the Coffee&quot; were all produced commercially Off-Broadway by Frederick Zollo.

Bogosian is also the author of six produced plays, including 1987&#x27;s &quot;Talk Radio&quot;. &quot;Talk Radio&quot; was a finalist for Pulitzer Prize for Drama, but lost to Alfred Uhry&#x27;s &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;. In 2007, a Broadway revival of &quot;Talk Radio&quot; directed by Robert Falls starred Liev Schreiber. &quot;subUrbia&quot; was directed by Robert Falls and produced by Lincoln Center Theater in 1994. Other titles include &quot;Griller&quot; (Goodman Theater); &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot; (The McCarter); &quot;Red Angel&quot; (Williamstown Theater Festival) and &quot;1+1&quot; (New York Stage and Film). Bogosian&#x27;s one-man drama, &quot;Notes from Underground&quot; has had several productions, most recently starring Jonathan Ames at Performance Space 122.

In addition to his many appearances in his solo work and starring in his play &quot;Talk Radio&quot;, Bogosian has also starred in Stephen Adly Guirgis&#x27; &quot;The Last Days of Judas Iscariot&quot; directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman (LAByrinth) and Donald Margulies&#x27; &quot;Time Stands Still&quot; directed by Daniel Sullivan (Manhattan Theater Club/Broadway).

===Film===
Bogosian&#x27;s play &quot;Talk Radio&quot; was adapted to film in 1988 by Oliver Stone, garnering Bogosian the prestigious Berlin Film Festival Silver Bear. The film version of &quot;subUrbia&quot; (1996) was directed by Richard Linklater. His play &quot;Sex, Drugs, Rock &amp; Roll&quot; was adapted to film in 1991. He has appeared in several other films including &quot;Under Siege 2: Dark Territory&quot; and &quot;Wonderland&quot;. In addition, he has been featured in films by such directors as Woody Allen, Robert Altman, Taylor Hackford, Atom Egoyan, and Agnieszka Holland.

===Television===
In television, Bogosian is best known for his starring role as Captain Danny Ross in the series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;. In addition, he has appeared as a guest star on dramas and in 1994 created with Steven Spielberg the series &quot;High Incident&quot; for ABC television. He portrayed Barney Greenwald, defense attorney, in the TV film &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court Martial&quot;. He also appeared in the episode &quot;His Story&quot; on &quot;Scrubs&quot; as Dr. Cox&#x27;s therapist and was recurring character Lawrence Boyd in &quot;Billions&quot;&#x27; second season. In 1993, Bogosian played the role of Stan Paxton, Larry&#x27;s ex-standup partner in the series &#x27;The Larry Sanders Show&#x27;. He has also appeared in HBO&#x27;s show &quot;Succession&quot; as Senator Gil Eavis, and in the main cast of the AMC show &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; as Daniel Molloy, the reporter who interviews the titular vampire. Bogasian’s &quot;incredible performance&quot; during the show’s second season was highlighted by Ro Rusak of Nerdist in their Best TV and Film Moments of 2024. That role was particular important to Bogosian as he was a long term fan of vampire genre- &quot;When I first came to New York as a young theatre intern, Frank Langella was doing &quot;Dracula&quot; on Broadway. I was there with a girlfriend, and we were probably in the last row of the balcony. And I felt like he was breathing down my neck. That power, that energy that he could create, thrilled me.&quot; That titillating thrill embedded itself deep into Bogosian, awakening an inclination toward the vampire&#x27;s allure that has persisted for decades. &quot;I love the eroticism of vampire stuff. I love these movies and plays more than anything. I petitioned Francis Ford Coppola to be in his &quot;Dracula&quot;, but unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t a big enough star,&quot; Bogosian shrugs. &quot;But he did invite me to the set, and I got to hang around with him and look at all the storyboards for that movie. That was really exciting.&quot; As the years went on, Bogosian&#x27;s fascination crystallized into a specific desire for his career: One way or another, he was determined to play a vampire. &quot;It&#x27;s just always on my mind,&quot; Bogosian smiles. &quot;I think there&#x27;s something about the power of a vampire. And hey, the biting the neck stuff is just sexy to me, so that doesn&#x27;t hurt.&quot;

===Books===
Bogosian is the author of three novels published by Simon &amp; Schuster: &quot;Mall&quot;, &quot;Wasted Beauty&quot;, and &quot;Perforated Heart&quot;.

<doc id="266649" wikidata="Q815160" url="?curid=266649" title="Siege of Carthage (Third Punic War)">
<text>The siege of Carthage was the main engagement of the Third Punic War fought between Carthage and Rome. It consisted of the nearly three-year siege of the Carthaginian capital, Carthage (a little northeast of Tunis). In 149 BC, a large Roman army landed at Utica in North Africa. The Carthaginians hoped to appease the Romans, but despite the Carthaginians surrendering all of their weapons, the Romans pressed on to besiege the city. The Roman campaign suffered repeated setbacks through 149 BC, only alleviated by Scipio Aemilianus, a middle-ranking officer, distinguishing himself several times. A new Roman commander took over in 148 BC, and fared equally badly. At the annual election of Roman magistrates in early 147 BC, the public support for Scipio was so great that the usual age restrictions were lifted to allow him to be appointed commander in Africa.

Scipio&#x27;s term began with two Carthaginian successes, but he tightened the siege and commenced a construction of a large mole to prevent supplies from getting into Carthage via blockade runners. The Carthaginians had partially rebuilt their fleet and it sortied, to the Romans&#x27; surprise; after an indecisive engagement the Carthaginians mismanaged their withdrawal and lost many ships. The Romans then built a large brick structure in the harbour area, which dominated the city wall. In early 146 BC the Romans launched their final assault, and over seven days systematically destroyed the city and killed its inhabitants; only on the last day did they take prisoners50,000, who were sold into slavery. The formerly Carthaginian territories became the Roman province of Africa, with Utica as its capital. It was a century before the site of Carthage was rebuilt as a Roman city.

==Primary sources==
The main source for almost every aspect of the Third Punic War is the historian Polybius ( – ), a Greek sent to Rome in 167 BC as a hostage. His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics, but he is now known for &quot;The Histories&quot;, written sometime after 146 BC. Polybius&#x27;s work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view. Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants, from both sides, in the events he wrote about. He accompanied the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus during his campaign in North Africa which resulted in the storming of Carthage and Roman victory in the war.

The accuracy of Polybius&#x27;s account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the war in modern sources are largely based on interpretations of Polybius&#x27;s account. The modern historian Andrew Curry sees Polybius as being &quot;fairly reliable&quot;; while Craige Champion describes him as &quot;a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian&quot;.

Other, later, ancient histories of the war exist, although often in fragmentary or summary form. Appian&#x27;s account of the Third Punic War is especially valuable. Modern historians usually also take into account the writings of various Roman annalists, some contemporary; the Sicilian Greek Diodorus Siculus; the later Roman historians Livy (who relied heavily on Polybius), Plutarch and Dio Cassius. The classicist Adrian Goldsworthy states &quot;Polybius&#x27; account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts&quot;. Other sources include coins, inscriptions, archaeological evidence and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the trireme &quot;Olympias&quot;.

==Background==
Carthage and Rome fought the 17-year Second Punic War between 218 and 201 BC, which ended with a Roman victory. The peace treaty imposed on the Carthaginians stripped them of all of their overseas territories, and some of their African ones. An indemnity of 10,000 silver talents was to be paid over 50 years. Hostages were taken. Carthage was forbidden to possess war elephants and its fleet was restricted to 10 warships. It was prohibited from waging war outside Africa, and in Africa only with Rome&#x27;s permission. Many senior Carthaginians wanted to reject it, but Hannibal spoke strongly in its favour and it was accepted in early 201 BC. Henceforth, it was clear that Carthage was politically subordinate to Rome.

At the end of the war, the Roman ally Masinissa emerged as by far the most powerful ruler among the Numidians, the dominant indigenous people in North Africa west of Egypt. Over the following 50 years, he repeatedly took advantage of Carthage&#x27;s inability to protect its possessions. Whenever Carthage petitioned Rome for redress, or permission to take military action, Rome backed its ally, Masinissa, and refused. Masinissa&#x27;s seizures of and raids into Carthaginian territory became increasingly flagrant. In 151 BC, Carthage raised a large army commanded by Hasdrubal and, the treaty notwithstanding, counterattacked the Numidians. The campaign ended in disaster and the army surrendered; a large number of Carthaginians were subsequently massacred by the Numidians. Hasdrubal escaped to Carthage, where in an attempt to placate Rome he was condemned to death. Carthage had paid off its indemnity and was prospering economically, but was no military threat to Rome. Nevertheless, elements in the Roman Senate had long wished to destroy Carthage, and, using the illicit Carthaginian military action as a pretext, began preparing a punitive expedition. Carthaginian embassies attempted to negotiate with Rome, but when the large North African port city of Utica went over to Rome in 149 BC the Senate and the centuriate assembly declared war.

It was the long-standing Roman procedure to elect two men each year, known as consuls, to each lead an army. A large Roman army landed at Utica in 149 BC under both consuls for the year, Manius Manilius commanding the army and Lucius Censorius the fleet. The Carthaginians continued to attempt to appease Rome, and sent an embassy to Utica. The consuls demanded that they hand over all weaponry, and reluctantly the Carthaginians did so. Great convoys took enormous stocks of equipment from Carthage to Utica. Surviving records state that these included 200,000 sets of armour and 2,000 catapults. Their warships all sailed to Utica and were burnt in the harbour. Once Carthage was disarmed, the consuls made the further demand that the Carthaginians abandon their city and relocate away from the sea; Carthage would then be destroyed. The Carthaginians abandoned negotiations and prepared to defend their city.

== Opposing forces ==

The city of Carthage itself was an unusually large city for the time, with a population estimated at 700,000. It was strongly fortified with walls of more than circumference. Defending the main approach from the land were three lines of defences, of which the strongest was a brick-built wall wide and high with a ditch in front of it. Built into this wall was a barracks capable of holding over 24,000 soldiers. The city had few reliable sources of ground water, but possessed a complex system to catch and channel rainwater and a large number of cisterns to store it.

The Carthaginians raised a strong and enthusiastic force to garrison the city from their citizenry and by freeing all slaves willing to fight. They also formed a 30,000 strong field army, which was placed under Hasdrubal, freshly released from his condemned cell. This army was based at , south of the city. Appian gives the strength of the Roman army which landed in Africa as 84,000 soldiers; modern historians estimate it at 40,000–50,000 men, of whom 4,000 were cavalry.

==Course of the war==
=== 149 BC ===
The Roman army moved to Carthage and twice attempted to scale the city walls, from the sea and the landward sides, being repulsed both times, before settling down for a siege. Hasdrubal moved up his army and harassed the Roman supply lines and foraging parties. The Romans built two very large battering rams and partially broke down a section of the wall. They stormed the breach but fell into disorder while clambering through and were thrown back by the waiting Carthaginians. The Romans would have been in difficulty except for the actions of Scipio Aemilianus, who was serving with the 4th Legion as a tribunea middle-ranking military position. Rather than join the attack as ordered, Scipio held back and spaced his men along the partially demolished wall, and so was able to beat off the pursuing Carthaginians when the Romans in front of him fled back through the ranks of his unit.

Censorinus&#x27;s camp was badly situated and by early summer was so pestiferous that it was moved to a healthier location. This, however, was not as defensible, and the Carthaginians inflicted losses on the Roman fleet with fireships. Separately, a night attack was launched against Manilius&#x27;s camp; a dangerous outcome for the Romans was again averted by Scipio&#x27;s prompt action. The Romans made repetitions of these attacks more difficult by building additional field fortifications.

=== 148 BC ===

The Romans elected two new consuls in 148 BC, but only one of them was sent to Africa: Calpurnius Piso; Lucius Mancinus commanded the navy as his subordinate. He pulled back the close siege of Carthage to a looser blockade and attempted to mop up the other Carthaginian-supporting cities in the area but failed. Meanwhile, Hasdrubal, commander of the Carthaginian field army, overthrew the civilian leadership of Carthage and took command himself. A Numidian chief came over to the Carthaginians with 800 cavalry. Carthage allied with Andriscus, a pretender to the Macedonian throne, who invaded Roman Macedonia, defeated a Roman army, had himself crowned King Philip VI, and sparked the Fourth Macedonian War.

=== 147 BC ===

Scipio intended to stand in the 147 BC elections for the post of ; this was a natural progression for him and at age 36 or 37 he was too young to stand as consul, for which the minimum age requirement was 42. But the public demand to appoint him as consul, and so allow him to take charge of the African war, was so strong that the Senate put aside the age requirements for all posts for the year. There was considerable political manoeuvring behind the scenes, much of which is opaque in the sources, and it is not known to what extent, if any, Scipio helped orchestrate this outcome. In any event, he secured sole command in Africa, the usual right to conscript enough men to make up the numbers of the forces there, and the unusual entitlement to enroll volunteers.

Meanwhile, early in 147 BC Mancinius seized an unexpected opportunity to capture a sally port and forced 3,500 men into the city, 3,000 of whom were lightly armed and armoured sailors. Mancinius sent messages asking for reinforcements. Sources have Scipio arriving at Utica that evening to take up his post. He sailed overnight for Carthage and arrived just in time to evacuate Mancinius&#x27;s hard-pressed force as it was expelled by a Carthaginian counterattack.

Scipio moved the Roman main camp back to near Carthage, closely observed by a Carthaginian detachment of 8,000. He made a speech demanding tighter discipline and dismissed those soldiers he considered ill-disciplined or poorly motivated. He then led a night march with a strong force that culminated in an assault against what the Romans considered to be a weak point in Carthage&#x27;s main wall. A gate was seized and 4,000 Romans pushed into the city. Panicked in the dark, the Carthaginian defenders, after an initial fierce resistance, fled. However, Scipio decided that his position would be indefensible once the Carthaginians reorganised themselves in daylight, and so withdrew. Hasdrubal, horrified at the way the Carthaginian defences had collapsed, had Roman prisoners tortured to death on the walls, in view of the Roman army. He was reinforcing the will to resist in the Carthaginian citizens; from this point there could be no possibility of negotiation or even surrender. Some members of the city council denounced his actions and Hasdrubal had them too put to death and took full control of the city.
The renewed close siege cut off landward entry to the city, but a tight seaward interdiction was all but impossible with the naval technology of the time. Frustrated at the amount of food being shipped into the city, Scipio started to build an immense mole to cut off access to the harbour. As work on this progressed, the Carthaginians responded by cutting a new channel from their harbour to the sea. They had built a new fleet of 50 triremesmedium-sized, manoeuvrable, oared warshipsand a large number of smaller ships since sacrificing their original fleet two years before. Once the channel was complete this sailed out, taking the Romans by surprise. A few days were necessary to trim the new-built ships and to train the new crews who had not been to sea for over two years and were out of the habit of operating together, and by the time the Carthaginians felt ready to give battle the Romans had concentrated their own naval forces. In the engagement which followed, the Carthaginians held their own, with their lighter craft proving difficult for the Roman ships to deal with. Breaking off the engagement, the Carthaginian triremes were covering the withdrawal of their lighter vessels when a collision blocked the new channel. With the Carthaginian ships pinned against the city&#x27;s sea wall with no room to manoeuvre, the Romans sank or captured many of them before the blockage was cleared and the Carthaginian survivors were able to escape back into harbour.

The Romans now attempted to advance against the Carthaginian defences in the harbour area. Carthaginians swam across the harbour at night and set fire to several siege engines and many legionaries panicked and fled. Scipio intercepted them in the dark; when they disregarded his orders to halt he had his mounted bodyguard attack them. Nevertheless, the Romans eventually gained control of the quay and constructed a brick wall as high as the city wall. This took months to complete, but once in place it enabled 4,000 Romans to shoot onto the Carthaginian ramparts from short range.

=== 146 BC ===

Scipio&#x27;s position as the Roman commander in Africa was extended for a year in 146 BC, and in the spring he launched the final assault. It came from the harbour area and Hasdrubal, expecting it, set fire to the nearby warehouses. Despite this, a Roman advance party broke through to the military harbour and captured it. The main assault force reached the city&#x27;s main square, where the legions camped overnight. The next morning Scipio led 4,000 men to link up with the group at the military harbour; this group was delayed when they diverted to strip the gold from the Temple of Apollo. Scipio and his officers were helpless to prevent them and furious. The Carthaginians did not take advantage, having withdrawn to defensive positions.

Having regrouped, the Romans systematically worked their way through the residential part of the city, killing everyone they encountered and firing the buildings behind them. At times, the Romans progressed from rooftop to rooftop, to prevent missiles being hurled down on them. It took six more days to clear the city of resistance, and on the last day Scipio agreed to accept prisoners. The last holdouts, including 900 Roman deserters in Carthaginian service, fought on from the Temple of Eshmoun and burnt it down around themselves when all hope was gone. At this point, Hasdrubal surrendered to Scipio on the promise of his life and freedom. Hasdrubal&#x27;s wife, watching from a rampart, then blessed Scipio, cursed her husband, and walked into the temple with her children, to burn to death.

There were 50,000 Carthaginian prisoners, a small proportion of the pre-war population, who were sold into slavery. After the final week of fighting, Scipio gave the city over to the soldiers to plunder. After this, a commission of ten senators arrived, ordering Scipio to destroy whatever remained of Carthage and decreed nobody was allowed to settle there or rebuild; however, it was not forbidden to go upon the ground nor was the land cursed, the notion that Roman forces then sowed the city with salt is a 19th-century invention. Many of the religious items and cult-statues which Carthage had pillaged from Sicilian cities and temples over the centuries were returned with great ceremony.

==Aftermath==
Scipio was awarded the &quot;agnomen&quot; &quot;Africanus&quot;, as his adoptive grandfather had been. The formerly Carthaginian territories were annexed by Rome and reconstituted to become the Roman province of Africa with Utica as its capital. The province became a major source of grain and other foodstuffs. Numerous large Punic cities, such as those in Mauretania, were taken over by the Romans, although they were permitted to retain their Punic system of government. A century later, the site of Carthage was rebuilt as a Roman city by Julius Caesar, and would become one of the main cities of Roman Africa by the time of the Empire. The Punic language continued to be spoken in north Africa until the 7th century.

Rome still exists as the capital of Italy; the ruins of Carthage lie east of Tunis on the North African coast. A formal peace treaty was signed by Ugo Vetere and Chedli Klibi, the mayors of Rome and the modern city of Carthage, respectively, on 5 February 1985; 2,131 years after the war ended. Due to the war&#x27;s nature as being defined by political revenge, and the subsequent massacre of the Carthaginians, and expulsion of its population, the war has sometimes been labelled a genocide.

<doc id="266652" wikidata="Q1123960" url="?curid=266652" title="Conch Republic">
<text>The Conch Republic () is a micronation declared as a secession of the city of Key West, Florida, from the United States on April 23, 1982. It has been maintained as a tourism booster for the city. Since then, the term &quot;Conch Republic&quot; has been expanded to refer to &quot;all of the Florida Keys, or, that geographic apportionment of land that falls within the legally defined boundaries of Monroe County, Florida, northward to &#x27;Skeeter&#x27;s Last Chance Saloon&#x27; in Florida City, Dade County, Florida, with Key West as the micronation&#x27;s capital and all territories north of Key West being referred to as &#x27;The Northern Territories&#x27;.

While the protests that sparked the creation of the Conch Republic (and others since then) have been described by some as &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot;, they were motivated by frustrations over genuine concerns. The original protest event was motivated by a U.S. Border Patrol roadblock and checkpoint that greatly inconvenienced residents and tourists.

The Conch Republic celebrates Independence Day every April 23 as part of a week-long festival of activities involving numerous businesses in Key West including local rum distilleries like Chef Distilled. The organization—a &quot;Sovereign State of Mind&quot;, seeking only to bring more &quot;humor, warmth and respect&quot; to a world in sore need of all three according to its late secretary general, Peter Anderson—is a key tourism booster for the area.

==History==

In 1982, the United States Border Patrol set up a roadblock and inspection point on US 1 just north of the merger of Monroe County Road 905A/Miami-Dade County Road 905A onto US 1 (the only two roads connecting the Florida Keys with the mainland), in front of the Last Chance Saloon just south of Florida City. Vehicles were stopped and searched for narcotics and illegal immigrants.

The Key West City Council complained repeatedly about the inconvenience for travelers to and from Key West, claiming that it hurt the Keys&#x27; important tourism industry. Eastern Air Lines, which had a hub at Miami International Airport, saw a window of opportunity when the roadblocks were established; Eastern was at the time the only airline to establish jet service to Key West International Airport, counting on travelers from Key West to Miami preferring to fly rather than to wait for police to search their vehicles. When the city council&#x27;s complaints went unanswered by the U.S. federal government and attempts to get an injunction against the roadblock failed in court, as a form of protest Mayor Dennis Wardlow and the council declared Key West&#x27;s independence on April 23, 1982. In the eyes of the council, since the U.S. federal government had set up the equivalent of a border station as if they were a foreign nation, they might as well become one. As many of the local citizens were referred to as Conchs, the micronation took the name of the Conch Republic.

As part of the protest, Mayor Wardlow was proclaimed prime minister of the republic, which immediately declared war against the United States (symbolically breaking a loaf of stale Cuban bread over the head of a man dressed in a naval uniform), quickly surrendered after one minute (to the man in the uniform), and applied for one billion dollars in foreign aid.

Conch Republic officials were invited to the Summit of the Americas in Miami in 1994, and Conch representatives were officially invited to 1995&#x27;s Florida Jubilee.

The faux secession and the events surrounding it generated great publicity for the Keys&#x27; plight—the roadblock and inspection station were removed soon afterward. It also resulted in the creation of a new avenue of tourism for the Keys.

===Invasions of 1995===
On September 20, 1995, it was reported that the 478th Civil Affairs Battalion of the United States Army Reserve was to conduct a training exercise simulating an invasion of a foreign island. They were to land on Key West and conduct affairs as if the islanders were foreign. However, no one from the 478th notified Conch officials of the exercise.

Seeing another chance at publicity, Wardlow and the forces behind the 1982 Conch Republic secession mobilized the island for a full-scale war, sending the schooner &quot;Western Union&quot; out to attack an incoming Coast Guard cutter with water balloons, conch fritters and stale Cuban bread (to which the Coast Guard responded with their fire hoses, quickly ending the battle), and protested to the Department of Defense for arranging this exercise without consulting the city officials. The leaders of the 478th issued an apology the next day, saying they &quot;in no way meant to challenge or impugn the sovereignty of the Conch Republic&quot;, and submitted to a surrender ceremony on September 22.

During the U.S. federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996, as a protest, the republic sent a flotilla of Conch Navy, civilian, and fire department boats to Fort Jefferson, located in Dry Tortugas National Park, to reopen it. The action was dubbed a &quot;full-scale invasion&quot; by the Conch Republic. Inspired by efforts of the Smithsonian Institution to keep its museums open by private donations, local residents had raised private money to keep the park running (as a closed park would damage the tourist-dependent local economy), but could find no one to accept the money and reopen the park.

When officials attempted to enter the monument, they were cited. When the citation was contested in court the following year, the resultant case, &quot;The United States of America v. Peter Anderson&quot;, was quickly dropped.

===Annexation of Seven Mile Bridge===
On January 13, 2006, Peter Anderson (the defendant in the Dry Tortugas case from 1995 to 1996) purported to annex the abandoned span of Seven Mile Bridge, which had been replaced by a parallel span in 1982. The move was in response to a recent event regarding Cuban refugees. On the previous January 4, fifteen Cuban refugees reached the bridge, but were returned to Cuba by the U.S. Border Patrol because the U.S. government had declared the bridge a &quot;wet feet&quot; location under the &quot;wet feet, dry feet policy&quot;. The rationale was that, since two sections of the span had been removed and it was no longer connected to land, it was not part of U.S. territory subject to the &quot;dry feet&quot; rule, and thus the refugees could not stay.

Anderson, seizing upon the U.S.&#x27;s apparent disavowal of the abandoned span, claimed it for the Republic. He expressed hope to use the bridge for affordable, ecologically friendly housing. In response, Russel Schweiss, spokesman for Florida governor Jeb Bush, declared, &quot;With all due respect to the Conch Republic, the bridge belongs to all the people of Florida, and we&#x27;re not currently in negotiations to sell it.&quot; The refugee decision was later overturned, but only after the refugees had been returned to Cuba.

===Recent history===
In another protest, beginning in 2008, the northern keys including Key Largo formed a separation of the Conch Republic known as the Independent Northernmost Territories of the Conch Republic. Proponents claim this separation is a result of disagreements over the definition and use of the term &quot;Conch Republic&quot;.

As of 2022, the southernmost point buoy mentions the Conch Republic.

==Souvenir passports and vehicle registration==
Through their website, the republic issues passports as souvenirs, but some have evidently bought them in the mistaken belief they are legitimate travel and identity documents. Shortly after the September 11 attacks, FBI investigators thought that hijacker Mohamed Atta had possibly purchased a Conch Republic passport from the website. International vehicle registration code stickers can also be purchased from vendors in Key West, bearing the initials &quot;KW&quot; and &quot;CR&quot;—the country codes for Kuwait and Costa Rica, respectively.

==Military==
The Conch Republic actively maintains an Army, Navy, and Air Force whose primary duties are to help re-enact the Great Sea Battle of 1982 and the retaking of Fort Jefferson. The Conch Republic Navy comprises no fewer than 10 civilian boats and the schooner &quot;Wolf&quot; under the command of Admiral Finbar Gittelman. The Army consists of the 1st Conch Artillery, garrisoned in Fort Taylor.

The Conch Republic Air Force has more than a dozen appointed aircraft in its fleet. The flagship, a 1942 Waco, was flown by Fred R. Cabanas, a legendary stunt pilot and ambassador for the Conch Republic at air shows worldwide. He flew &quot;Conch Fury&quot; in the 2005 Reno Air Races. Fred was declared General of the Air Force by the mayor of Key West after intercepting a defecting Cuban MiG-23 with his Pitts Special in 1991. Following his death in January 2013, Fred was succeeded by his son, Raymond Cabanas.

==In literature==
Some of the action in Joe Haldeman&#x27;s 1989 science fiction novel &quot;Buying Time&quot; (published in UK as &quot;The Long Habit of Living&quot;) takes place in the Conch Republic, a lawless place where assassination and other activities are perfectly legal.

Science fiction writer Spider Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Callahan&#x27;s Crosstime Saloon&quot; series—about an Irish bar full of time travellers, aliens and musicians—find themselves relocated to the Conch Republic in the 2000 novel &quot;Callahan&#x27;s Key&quot;.

==National anthem==
In 1994, Joe and Meri-Lynn Britz wrote the national anthem for the Conch Republic, &quot;Conch Republic&quot;. It was recorded by the Key Lime Pie band and voted on and accepted by the city of Key West City Commissioners.

<text>Fenghuang are mythological birds featuring in traditions throughout the Sinosphere. &quot;Fenghuang&quot; are understood to reign over all other birds: males and females were originally termed &quot;feng&quot; and &quot;huang&quot; respectively, but a gender distinction is typically no longer made, and &quot;fenghuang&quot; are generally considered a feminine entity to be paired with the traditionally masculine Chinese dragon.

Fenghuang are known under similar names in various other languages (Japanese: ; or ; Korean: ). In the West, they are commonly called Chinese phoenixes, although mythological similarities with the Western phoenix are superficial.

==Appearance==

A common depiction of fenghuang was of it attacking snakes with its talons and its wings spread. According to the &quot;Erya&quot;&#x27;s chapter 17 &quot;Shiniao&quot;, fenghuang is made up of the beak of a rooster, the face of a swallow, the forehead of a fowl, the neck of a snake, the breast of a goose, the back of a tortoise, the hindquarters of a stag and the tail of a fish. Today, however, it is often described as a composite of many birds including the head of a golden pheasant, the body of a mandarin duck, the tail of a peacock, the legs of a crane, the mouth of a parrot, and the wings of a swallow.

The fenghuang&#x27;s body symbolizes the celestial bodies: the head is the sky, the eyes are the sun, the back is the moon, the wings are the wind, the feet are the earth, and the tail is the planets. The fenghuang is said to have originated in the sun. Its body contains the five fundamental colors: black, white, red, yellow, and green. It sometimes carries scrolls or a box with sacred books. It is sometimes depicted with a fireball. It is believed that the bird only appears in areas or places that are blessed with utmost peace and prosperity or happiness.

Chinese tradition cites it as living atop the Kunlun Mountains in western China.

==Origin==
The earliest known ancient phoenix design dates back to about 7000–8000 years ago and was discovered in Hongjiang, Hunan Province, at the Gaomiao Archeological Site. The earliest known form of dragon-phoenix design, on the other hand, dates back to the Yangshao culture (BC) and was found at an archeological site near Xi&#x27;an in Shaanxi Province. This ancient usage of &quot;phoenix&quot; and &quot;dragon&quot; designs are all evidence of an ancient form of totemism in China. 

During the Shang dynasty, phoenix and dragon images appear to have become popular as burial objects. Several archeological artifacts of jade phoenix and jade dragons were unearthed in tombs dating from the Shang dynasty period.

During the Spring and Autumn period (c.771c.476BC) and the Warring States period, common form of unearthed artifacts is the combination of dragon-phoenix designs together. One such artifact is the &quot;Silk Painting of Human Figure with Dragon and Phoenix&quot;, pictured left. 

In the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC), phoenix hairpins (i.e. hairpins with &quot;fenghuang&quot; decorations) and shoes which were also decorated with phoenix designs were supposed to be worn by the Imperial concubines of the Qin Emperor. 

During the Han dynasty (2,200 years ago) two phoenixes, one a male (&quot;feng&quot;, ) and the other a female (&quot;huang&quot;, ) were often shown together facing one other. In the Han dynasty, an imperial edict decreed that the phoenix hairpins had to become the formal headpiece for the empress dowager and the imperial grandmother.

Later, during the Yuan dynasty the two terms were merged to become &quot;fenghuang&quot;, but the &quot;King of Birds&quot; came to symbolize the empress when paired with a dragon representing the emperor. 

From the Jiajing era (1522–1566) of the Ming dynasty onwards, a pair of phoenixes was differentiated by the tail feathers of the two birds, typically together forming a closed circle patternthe male identified by five long serrated tail feathers or &quot;filaments&quot; (five being an odd, masculine, or &quot;yang&quot; number) and the female by what sometimes appears to be one but is in fact usually two curling or tendrilled tail feathers (two being an even, feminine, or &quot;yin&quot; number). Also during this period, the &quot;fenghuang&quot; was used as a symbol representing the direction south. This was portrayed through a male and female facing each other. Their feathers were of the five fundamental colors: black, white, red, green, and yellow. These colours are said to represent Confucius&#x27; five virtues:
#Ren: the virtue of benevolence, charity, and humanity;
#Yi: honesty and uprightness; &quot;Yì&quot; may be broken down into &quot;zhōng&quot;, doing one&#x27;s best, conscientiousness, loyalty and &quot;shù&quot;: the virtue of reciprocity, altruism, consideration for others
#Zhi: knowledge
#Xin: faithfulness and integrity;
#Li: correct behavior, propriety, good manners, politeness, ceremony, worship.

The phoenix represented power sent from the heavens to the Empress. If a phoenix was used to decorate a house it symbolized that loyalty and honesty were in the people that lived there. Or alternatively, a phoenix only stays when the ruler is without darkness and corruption ().

==Etymology and meaning==

===Etymology===

Linguist Wang Li relates element to &quot;peng, fabulous great bird&quot;; is also related to &quot;wind&quot;. 

Historical linguist Marc Miyake reconstructs , which he proposes, though with uncertainty, to be the affixed form of &quot;wind sovereign&quot;.

===Meaning===

The fenghuang has positive connotations. It is a symbol of virtue and grace. The fenghuang also symbolizes the union of yin and yang. The first chapter of the &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas &quot;, the &quot;Nanshang-jing&quot;, states that each part of fenghuang&#x27;s body symbolizes a word. The head represents virtue (), the wing represents duty (), the back represents propriety (), the abdomen represents credibility () and the chest represents mercy ().

The &quot;fenghuang&quot; originally consisted of a separate male &quot;feng&quot; and a female &quot;huang&quot; as symbols of yin and yang. The male &quot;feng&quot; represented the &quot;yang&quot; aspect while the &quot;huang&quot; represented the &quot;yin&quot; aspect; and together, the feng and huang image was symbolic of love between husband and wife. However, since the Qin dynasty, the &quot;fenghuang&quot; progressively went through a feminization process as the dragon became a symbol of masculinity. Eventually, the &quot;feng&quot; and the &quot;huang&quot; merged into a single female entity. 

In ancient and modern Chinese culture, &quot;fenghuang&quot; can often be found in the decorations for weddings or royalty, along with dragons. This is because the Chinese considered the dragon-and-phoenix design symbolic of blissful relations between husband and wife, another common yang and yin metaphor. In some traditions, it appears in good times but hides during times of trouble, while in other traditions it appeared only to mark the beginning of a new era. In China and Japan, it was a symbol of the imperial house, and it represented &quot;fire, the sun, justice, obedience, and fidelity&quot;.

== Modern usage ==
The phoenix is still used in modern Japan and Korea in relation to the head of state:
*Japan: The &quot;Hōō&quot; (, , the Japanese pronunciation of ) is associated with the Japanese Imperial family. The seemingly vast difference between &quot;hōō&quot; and &quot;fenghuang&quot; is due to Chinese vowels with &quot;ng&quot; usually being converted to &quot;ō&quot; in &quot;go-on&quot; reading. Examples include:
** The actual Imperial throne is adorned by numerous &quot;Hōō&quot;s.
** The Imperial regalia &quot;Kōrozen no Gohō&quot; () is decorated by numerous textile patterns including a pair of &quot;Hōō&quot;.
** Various Japanese stamps and currency, such as the back of the current series E (2004) ¥10,000 yen note. 
** Toyota&#x27;s flagship vehicle favored by the Japanese Imperial family and high Japanese government officials, the Toyota Century, uses the &quot;Hōō&quot; as an identifying emblem. 
*Korea: two &quot;bonghwang&quot; (, Korean pronunciation of ) are used in the symbol of the Korean President. They are also appeared on the national seal. Historically the &quot;bonghwang&quot; was used for queens and empresses.

Other uses include:
* &quot;Fèng&quot; or &quot;Fènghuáng&quot; is a common element in given names of Chinese women (likewise, &quot;Dragon&quot; is used for men&#x27;s names).
* &quot;Dragon-and-phoenix infants&quot; () is a Chinese term for a set of male and female fraternal twins.
*Fenghuang is a common place name throughout China. The best known is Fenghuang County in western Hunan, southern China, formerly a sub-prefecture. Its name is written with the same Chinese characters as the mythological bird.
* &quot;Phoenix talons&quot; () is a Chinese term for chicken claws in any Chinese dish cooked with them.
*The Vermilion Bird, (&quot;Suzaku&quot; in Japanese) one of the Four Symbols of Chinese myth, sometimes equated with the fenghuang.
* The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) uses it in its emblem to symbol nobility, beauty, loyalty and majesty.
* Phoenix Television () is a Hong Kong-based media company
* Typhoon Fung-wong has been a meteorological name for three tropical cyclones. The term was contributed by Hong Kong and is the Cantonese pronunciation of &quot;fenghuang&quot;.
*When describing chinoiserie or authentic Asian ceramics and other artworks, English-speaking art historians and antique collectors sometimes refer to it as &quot;hoho bird&quot;, a name derived from &quot;hōō&quot;, with a second extraneous &quot;h&quot; added. The Japanese also use the word &quot;fushichō&quot; for this image.

<text>Gateshead () is a town in the Gateshead Metropolitan Borough of Tyne and Wear, England. It is on the River Tyne&#x27;s southern bank. The town&#x27;s attractions include the twenty metre tall Angel of the North sculpture on the town&#x27;s southern outskirts, The Glasshouse International Centre for Music and the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art. The town shares the Millennium Bridge, Tyne Bridge and multiple other bridges with Newcastle upon Tyne.

Historically part of County Durham, under the Local Government Act 1888 the town was made a county borough, meaning it was administered independently of the county council.

In the 2021 Census, the town had a population of 196,151.

==History==
===Name origins===
Gateshead is first mentioned in Latin translation in Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; as &quot;ad caput caprae&quot; (&quot;at the goat&#x27;s head&quot;). This interpretation is consistent with the later English attestations of the name, among them &quot;Gatesheued&quot; (), literally &quot;goat&#x27;s head&quot; but in the context of a place-name meaning &#x27;headland or hill frequented by (wild) goats&#x27;. Although other derivations have been mooted, it is this that is given by the standard authorities.

A Brittonic predecessor, named with the element &quot;*gabro-&quot;, &#x27;goat&#x27; (c.f. Welsh &quot;gafr&quot;), may underlie the name. Gateshead might have been the Roman-British fort of &quot;Gabrosentum&quot;.

===Early===
There has been a settlement on the Gateshead side of the River Tyne, around the old river crossing where the Swing Bridge now stands, since Roman times.

The first recorded mention of Gateshead is in the writings of the Venerable Bede who referred to an Abbot of Gateshead called Utta in 623. In 1068 William the Conqueror defeated the forces of Edgar the Ætheling and Malcolm king of Scotland (Shakespeare&#x27;s Malcolm) on Gateshead Fell (now Low Fell and Sheriff Hill).

During medieval times Gateshead was under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Durham. At this time the area was largely forest with some agricultural land. The forest was the subject of Gateshead&#x27;s first charter, granted in the 12th century by Hugh du Puiset, Bishop of Durham. An alternative spelling may be &quot;Gatishevede&quot;, as seen in a legal record, dated 1430.

===Industrial revolution===
Throughout the Industrial Revolution the population of Gateshead expanded rapidly; between 1801 and 1901 the increase was over 100,000. This expansion resulted in the spread southwards of the town.

In 1854, a catastrophic explosion on the quayside destroyed most of Gateshead&#x27;s medieval heritage, and caused widespread damage on the Newcastle side of the river.

Sir Joseph Swan lived at Underhill, Low Fell, Gateshead from 1869 to 1883, where his experiments led to the invention of the electric light bulb. The house was the first in the world to be wired for domestic electric light.

In 1889 one of the largest employers (Hawks, Crawshay and Sons) closed down and unemployment has since been a burden. Up to the Second World War there were repeated newspaper reports of the unemployed sending deputations to the council to provide work. The depression years of the 1920s and 1930s created even more joblessness and the Team Valley Trading Estate was built in the mid-1930s to alleviate the situation.

===Regeneration===

In the late noughties, Gateshead Council started to regenerate the town, with the long-term aim of making Gateshead a city. The most extensive transformation occurred in the Quayside, with almost all the structures there being constructed or refurbished in this time.

In the early 2010s, regeneration refocused on the town centre. The £150 million Trinity Square development opened in May 2013, it incorporates student accommodation, a cinema, health centre and shops. It was nominated for the Carbuncle Cup in September 2014. The cup was however awarded to another development which involved Tesco, Woolwich Central.

==Governance==
===Former===

In 1835, Gateshead was established as a municipal borough and in 1889 it was made a county borough, independent from Durham County Council.

In 1870, the Old Town Hall was built, designed by John Johnstone who also designed the previously built Newcastle Town Hall. The ornamental clock in front of the old town hall was presented to Gateshead in 1892 by the mayor, Walter de Lancey Willson, on the occasion of him being elected for a third time. He was also one of the founders of Walter Willson&#x27;s, a chain of grocers in the North East and Cumbria. The old town hall also served as a magistrate&#x27;s court and one of Gateshead&#x27;s police stations.

===Current===

In 1974, following the Local Government Act 1972, the County Borough of Gateshead was merged with the urban districts of Felling, Whickham, Blaydon and Ryton and part of the rural district of Chester-le-Street to create the much larger Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead.

==Geography==
The town of Gateshead is in the North East of England in the ceremonial county of Tyne and Wear, and within the historic boundaries of County Durham. It is located on the southern bank of the River Tyne at a latitude of 54.57° N and a longitude of 1.35° W.
Gateshead experiences a temperate climate which is considerably warmer than some other locations at similar latitudes as a result of the warming influence of the Gulf Stream (via the North Atlantic drift). It is located in the rain shadow of the North Pennines and is therefore in one of the driest regions of the United Kingdom.

One of the most distinguishing features of Gateshead is its topography. The land rises 230 feet from Gateshead Quays to the town centre and continues rising to a height of 525 feet at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Sheriff Hill. This is in contrast to the flat and low lying Team Valley located on the western edges of town. The high elevations allow for impressive views over the Tyne valley into Newcastle and across Tyneside to Sunderland and the North Sea from lookouts in Windmill Hills and Windy Nook respectively.

The Office for National Statistics defines the town as an urban sub-division. The 2011 ONS urban sub-division of Gateshead contains the historical County Borough together with areas that the town has absorbed, including Dunston, Felling, Heworth, Pelaw and Bill Quay.

Given the proximity of Gateshead to Newcastle, just south of the River Tyne from the city centre, it is sometimes incorrectly referred to as being a part of Newcastle. Gateshead Council and Newcastle City Council teamed up in 2000 to create a unified marketing brand name, NewcastleGateshead, to better promote the whole of the Tyneside conurbation.

===Climate===
Climate in this area has small differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round to meet the criterion for Oceanic climate, at least 30 mm per month. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).
===Green belt===
The town is within the wider Tyne &amp; Wear Green Belt, with its portion in much of its surrounding rural area of the borough. It is a part of the local development plan which is in conjunction with Newcastle city borough, and was created in the 1960s.

Its stated aims are to:

* &quot;Prevent the merging of settlements, particularly: Gateshead with Hebburn, Washington, Birtley or Whickham ...the main built-up area with nearby villages; and villages with each other,&quot; 
* &quot;Safeguard the countryside from encroachment,&quot;
* &quot;Check unrestricted urban sprawl, and&quot;
* &quot;Assist in urban regeneration in the city-region by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban land.&quot;

In the Gateshead borough boundary, as well as the aforementioned areas, it also surrounds the communities of Chopwell, Crawcrook, Greenside, High Spen, Kibblesworth, Lockhaugh, Rowlands Gill, Ryton, Sunniside, as well several small hamlets. Landscape features and facilities such as woods and nature reserves, local golf courses, Burdon Moor and Whinell Hill are also within the green belt area.

===Districts===
The town of Gateshead consists of the following districts. Some of them were once separate settlements that were absorbed by encroaching urban sprawl, while others consist entirely of retail, industrial and housing estates. Many of these areas overlap each other and their boundaries are by no means official or fixed. Gateshead is a Town (Urban Subdivision) in the Tyneside urban area.

==Demography==

The table below compares the demographics of Gateshead with the wider Metropolitan borough. The town&#x27;s population in 2011 was 120,046 compared with 78,403 in 2001. This is due to a slight population increase and boundary and methodology changes since 2001. Felling used to be a separate urban subdivision and had a population of around 35,000, but now it is considered part of Gateshead town. The population of the 2011 census boundaries in 2001 was 113,220, proving that there was some sort of population increase.


In 2011, 8.0% of the population of Gateshead Town were from an ethnic minority group (non-indigenous), compared with only 6.0% for the surrounding borough. Despite the borough&#x27;s low ethnic minority population compared with the England average of 20.2%, it has slightly more ethnic minorities than other boroughs in Tyne and Wear, such as Sunderland or North Tyneside, and two wards near the town centre (Bridges and Saltwell) have minority populations very similar to the national average. The Tyneside metropolitan area, which contains the borough of Gateshead, has a population of 829,300; the NewcastleGateshead urban core area has population of 480,400. The Metropolitan borough of Gateshead had a population of 200,214 in 2011. Gateshead is the main major area in the metropolitan borough and the town takes up around 60% of the borough&#x27;s population. Other major areas in the borough include Whickham, Birtley, Blaydon-on-Tyne and Ryton.

==Economy==
Gateshead is home to the MetroCentre, the largest shopping mall in the UK until 2008; and the Team Valley Trading Estate, once the largest and still one of the larger purpose-built commercial estates in the UK.

===Arts===
The Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art has been established in a converted flour mill. The Glasshouse International Centre for Music, previously The Sage, a Norman Foster-designed venue for music and the performing arts opened on 17 December 2004. Gateshead also hosted the Gateshead Garden Festival in 1990, rejuvenating of derelict land (now mostly replaced with housing). The Angel of the North, a famous sculpture in nearby Lamesley, is visible from the A1 to the south of Gateshead, as well as from the East Coast Main Line. Other public art include works by Richard Deacon, Colin Rose, Sally Matthews, Andy Goldsworthy, Gordon Young and Michael Winstone.

===Traditional and former===
The earliest recorded coal mining in the Gateshead area is dated to 1344. As trade on the Tyne prospered there were several attempts by the burghers of Newcastle to annex Gateshead. In 1576 a small group of Newcastle merchants acquired the &#x27;Grand Lease&#x27; of the manors of Gateshead and Whickham. In the hundred years from 1574 coal shipments from Newcastle increased elevenfold while the population of Gateshead doubled to approximately 5,500. However, the lease and the abundant coal supplies ended in 1680. The pits were shallow as problems of ventilation and flooding defeated attempts to mine coal from the deeper seams.

William Cotesworth (1668-1726) was a prominent merchant based in Gateshead, where he was a leader in coal and international trade. Cotesworth began as the son of a yeoman and apprentice to a tallow - candler. He ended as an esquire, having been mayor, Justice of the Peace and sheriff of Northumberland. He collected tallow from all over England and sold it across the globe. He imported dyes from the Indies, as well as flax, wine, and grain. He sold tea, sugar, chocolate, and tobacco. He operated the largest coal mines in the area, and was a leading salt producer. As the government&#x27;s principal agent in the North country, he was in contact with leading ministers.

William Hawks, originally a blacksmith, started business in Gateshead in 1747, working with the iron brought to the Tyne as ballast by the Tyne colliers. Hawks and Co. eventually became one of the biggest iron businesses in the North, producing anchors, chains and so on to meet a growing demand. There was keen contemporary rivalry between &#x27;Hawks&#x27; Blacks&#x27; and &#x27;Crowley&#x27;s Crew&#x27;. The famous &#x27;Hawks&#x27; men&#x27; including Ned White, went on to be celebrated in Geordie song and story.

In 1831 a locomotive works was established by the Newcastle and Darlington Railway, later part of the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway. In 1854 the works moved to the Greenesfield site and became the manufacturing headquarters of North Eastern Railway. In 1909, locomotive construction was moved to Darlington and the rest of the works were closed in 1932.

Robert Stirling Newall took out a patent on the manufacture of wire ropes in 1840 and in partnership with Messrs. Liddell and Gordon, set up his headquarters at Gateshead. A worldwide industry of wire-drawing resulted. The submarine telegraph cable received its definitive form through Newall&#x27;s initiative, involving the use of gutta-percha surrounded by strong wires. The first successful Dover–Calais cable on 25 September 1851, was made in Newall&#x27;s works. In 1853, he invented the brake-drum and cone for laying cable in deep seas. Half of the first Atlantic cable was manufactured in Gateshead. Newall was interested in astronomy, and his giant telescope was set up in the garden at Ferndene, his Gateshead residence, in 1871.

==Architecture==

J. B. Priestley, writing of Gateshead in his 1934 travelogue &quot;English Journey&quot;, said that &quot;no true civilisation could have produced such a town&quot;, adding that it appeared to have been designed &quot;by an enemy of the human race&quot;.

===Victorian===

William Wailes the celebrated stained-glass maker, lived at South Dene from 1853 to 1860. In 1860, he designed Saltwell Towers as a fairy-tale palace for himself. It is an imposing Victorian mansion in its own park with a romantic skyline of turrets and battlements. It was originally furnished sumptuously by Gerrard Robinson. Some of the panelling installed by Robinson was later moved to the Shipley Art Gallery. Wailes sold Saltwell Towers to the corporation in 1876 for use as a public park, provided he could use the house for the rest of his life. For many years the structure was essentially an empty shell but following a restoration programme it was reopened to the public in 2004.

===Post millennium===

The council sponsored the development of a Gateshead Quays cultural quarter. The development includes the Gateshead Millennium Bridge, erected in 2001, which won the prestigious Stirling Prize for Architecture in 2002.

===Former brutalism===

The brutalist Trinity Centre Car Park, which was designed by Owen Luder, dominated the town centre for many years until its demolition in 2010. A product of attempts to regenerate the area in the 1960s, the car park gained an iconic status due to its appearance in the 1971 film &quot;Get Carter&quot;, starring Michael Caine. An unsuccessful campaign to have the structure listed was backed by Sylvester Stallone, who played the main role in the 2000 remake of the film. The car park was scheduled for demolition in 2009, but this was delayed as a result of a disagreement between Tesco, who re-developed the site, and Gateshead Council. The council had not been given firm assurances that Tesco would build the previously envisioned town centre development which was to include a Tesco mega-store as well as shops, restaurants, cafes, bars, offices and student accommodation. The council effectively used the car park as a bargaining tool to ensure that the company adhered to the original proposals and blocked its demolition until they submitted a suitable planning application. Demolition finally took place in July–August 2010.

The Derwent Tower, another well known example of brutalist architecture, was also designed by Owen Luder and stood in the neighbourhood of Dunston. Like the Trinity Car Park it also failed in its bid to become a listed building and was demolished in 2012. Also located in this area are the Grade II listed Dunston Staiths which were built in 1890. Following the award of a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of almost £420,000 restoration of the structure was planned in 2014 and completed by 2015.

==Sport==

Gateshead International Stadium regularly holds international athletics meetings over the summer months, and is home of the Gateshead Harriers athletics club. It is also host to rugby league fixtures, and the home ground of Gateshead Football Club. Gateshead Thunder Rugby League Football Club played at Gateshead International Stadium until its purchase by Newcastle Rugby Limited and the subsequent rebranding as Newcastle Thunder. Both clubs have had their problems: Gateshead A.F.C. were controversially voted out of the Football League in 1960 in favour of Peterborough United, whilst Gateshead Thunder lost their place in Super League as a result of a takeover (officially termed a merger) by Hull F.C. Both Gateshead clubs continue to ply their trade at lower levels in their respective sports, thanks mainly to the efforts of their supporters. The Gateshead Senators American Football team also use the International Stadium, as well as this it was used in the 2006 Northern Conference champions in the British American Football League.

Gateshead Leisure Centre is home to the Gateshead Phoenix Basketball Team. The team currently plays in EBL League Division 4. Home games are usually on a Sunday afternoon during the season, which runs from September to March. The team was formed in 2013 and ended their initial season well placed to progress after defeating local rivals Newcastle Eagles II and promotion chasing Kingston Panthers.

In Low Fell there is a cricket club and a rugby club adjacent to each other on Eastwood Gardens. These are Gateshead Fell Cricket Club and Gateshead Rugby Club. Gateshead Rugby Club was formed in 1998 following the merger of Gateshead Fell Rugby Club and North Durham Rugby Club.

==Transport==
===Rail===
Gateshead is served by the following rail transport stations with some being operated by National Rail and some being Tyne &amp; Wear Metro stations: , , Gateshead Interchange, , Heworth Interchange, and .

Tyne &amp; Wear Metro stations at Gateshead Interchange and Gateshead Stadium provide direct light-rail access to , Newcastle Airport, , and South Shields Interchange.

National Rail services are provided by Northern at Dunston and MetroCentre stations. The East Coast Main Line, which runs from to , cuts directly through the town on its way between and stations. There are presently no stations on this line within Gateshead, as , and stations were closed in 1952, 1954 and 1965 respectively.

===Road===

Several major road links pass through Gateshead, including the A1 which links London to Edinburgh and the A184 which connects the town to Sunderland.

Gateshead Interchange is the busiest bus station in Tyne &amp; Wear and was used by 3.9 million bus passengers in 2008.

===Cycle routes===
Various bicycle trails traverse the town; most notably is the recreational Keelmans Way (National Cycle Route 141), which is located on the south bank of the Tyne and takes riders along the entire Gateshead foreshore. Other prominent routes include the East Gateshead Cycleway, which connects to Felling, the West Gateshead Cycleway, which links the town centre to Dunston and the MetroCentre, and routes along both the old and new Durham roads, which take cyclists to Birtley, Wrekenton and the Angel of the North.

==Religion==

===Christianity===
Christianity has been present in the town since at least the 7th century, when Bede mentioned a monastery in Gateshead. A church in the town was burned down in 1080 with the Bishop of Durham inside. St Mary&#x27;s Church was built near to the site of that building, and was the only church in the town until the 1820s. Undoubtedly the oldest building on the Quayside, St Mary&#x27;s has now re-opened to the public as the town&#x27;s first heritage centre.

Many of the Anglican churches in the town date from the 19th century, when the population of the town grew dramatically and expanded into new areas. The town presently has a number of notable and large churches of many denominations.

===Judaism===
The Bensham district is home to a community of hundreds of Orthodox Jewish families and has been referred to as the Oxbridge of British Jewry. Within the community is the Gateshead Yeshiva, founded in 1929, and other Jewish educational institutions with international enrolments. These include two seminaries: Beis Medrash L&#x27;Morot and Beis Chaya Rochel, colloquially known together as Gateshead &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; seminaries. Many yeshivos and kollelim also are active, including Sunderland Yeshiva, Baer Hatorah, Nesivos Hatorah, Nezer Hatorah and Yeshiva Ketana.

===Islam===
Islam is practised by a large community of people in Gateshead and there are 2 mosques located in the Bensham area (in Ely Street and Villa Place).

==Twinning==

Gateshead is twinned with the town of Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvray near Rouen in France, and the city of Komatsu in Japan.

<text>Harrogate ( ) is a spa town in the district and county of North Yorkshire, England. Historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the town is a tourist destination and its visitor attractions include its spa waters and RHS Harlow Carr gardens. away from the town centre is the Yorkshire Dales National Park and the Nidderdale AONB.

Harrogate grew out of two smaller settlements, High Harrogate and Low Harrogate, in the 17th century. For three consecutive years (2013–2015), polls voted the town as &quot;the happiest place to live&quot; in Britain. Harrogate spa water contains iron, sulphur and common salt. The town became known as &#x27;The English Spa&#x27; in the Georgian era, after its waters were discovered in the 16th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries its &#x27;chalybeate&#x27; waters (containing iron) were a popular health treatment, and the influx of wealthy but sickly visitors contributed significantly to the wealth of the town.

Harrogate railway station and Harrogate bus station in the town centre provide transport connections. Leeds Bradford Airport is southwest of Harrogate. The main roads through the town are the A61, connecting Harrogate to Leeds and Ripon, and the A59, connecting the town to York and Skipton. Harrogate is also connected to Wetherby and the A1(M) by the A661, while the A658 from Bradford forms a bypass around the south of the town. Harrogate had a population of 73,576 at the 2011 UK census; the built-up area comprising Harrogate and nearby Knaresborough had a population of 89,060, while the figure for the much wider Borough of Harrogate, comprising Harrogate, Knaresborough, Ripon, as well as a number of smaller settlements and a large rural area, was 157,869.

The town motto is &quot;Arx celebris fontibus&quot;, which means &quot;a citadel famous for its springs&quot;.

==Toponym==
The name &quot;Harrogate&quot; is first attested in the 1330s as &quot;Harwegate&quot;, &quot;Harougat&quot; and &quot;Harrowgate&quot;. The origin of the name is uncertain. It may derive from Old Norse &quot;hǫrgr&quot; &#x27;a heap of stones, cairn&#x27; + &quot;gata&quot; &#x27;street&#x27;, in which case the name presumably meant &#x27;road to the cairn&#x27;. Another possibility is that the name means &quot;the way to Harlow&quot;. The form &quot;Harlowgate&quot; is known from 1518, and apparently in the court rolls of Edward II.

== History ==

In medieval times Harrogate was a place on the boundary of the township of Bilton with Harrogate in the ancient parish of Knaresborough, and the parish of Pannal, also known as Beckwith with Rossett. The part within the township of Bilton developed into the community of High Harrogate, and the part within Pannal developed into the community of Low Harrogate. Both communities were within the Royal Forest of Knaresborough. In 1372 King Edward III granted the Royal Forest to his son John, Duke of Lancaster (also known as John of Gaunt), and the Duchy of Lancaster became the principal landowner in Harrogate.

Harrogate&#x27;s development is owed to the discovery of its chalybeate- and sulphur-rich spring water from the 16th century. The first mineral spring was discovered in 1571 by William Slingsby, who found that water from the Tewit Well in High Harrogate possessed similar properties to that from springs in the Belgian town of Spa, which gave its name to spa towns. The medicinal properties of the waters were publicised by Edmund Deane; his book, &quot;Spadacrene Anglica, or the English Spa Fountain&quot; was published in 1626.
In the 17th and 18th centuries further chalybeate springs were discovered in High Harrogate, and both chalybeate and sulphur springs were found in Low Harrogate. The two communities attracted many visitors. A number of inns were opened for visitors in High Harrogate in the 17th century (the Queen&#x27;s Head, the Granby, the Dragon and the World&#x27;s End). In Low Harrogate, the Crown Hotel was open by the mid-18th century, and possibly earlier.

In accordance with the Forest of Knaresborough Inclosure Act 1770 (10 Geo. 3. c. &quot;94&quot; ), promoted by the Duchy of Lancaster, the Royal Forest of Knaresborough was enclosed. The enclosure award of 1778 clarified ownership of land in the Harrogate area. Under the award, of land, which included the springs known at that time, were reserved as a public common, The Stray, which has remained public open space. The Enclosure Award facilitated development around the Stray. During the 19th century, the area between High Harrogate and Low Harrogate, which until then had remained separate communities a mile apart, was developed, and what is now the central area of Harrogate was built on high ground overlooking Low Harrogate. An area to the north of the developing town was reserved to the Duchy of Lancaster, and was developed for residential building. To provide entertainment for the increasing numbers of visitors the Georgian Theatre was built in 1788. Bath Hospital (later the Royal Bath Hospital) was built in 1826. The Royal Pump Room was built in 1842. The site of Tewit Well is marked by a dome on the Stray. Other wells can be found in the Valley Gardens and Royal Pump Room museum.

In 1870, engineering inventor Samson Fox perfected the process of creating water gas, in the basement laboratory of Grove House. After constructing a trial plant at his home on Skipton Road, making it the first house in Yorkshire to have gas lighting and heating; he built a plant of suitable size to supply the whole town. When Parliament Street became the world&#x27;s first route to be lit by water-gas, newspapers commented: &quot;Samson Fox has captured the sunlight for Harrogate.&quot; After donating the town&#x27;s first fire engine, and building the town&#x27;s theatre, he was elected mayor for three successive years (1890–92), a record never equalled since.

In 1893 Harrogate doctor George Oliver was the first to observe the effect of adrenaline on the circulation.

Like many spa town all over Europe, Harrogate&#x27;s popularity declined after the First World War. During the Second World War, Harrogate&#x27;s large hotels accommodated government offices evacuated from London, paving the way for the town to become a commercial, conference, and exhibition centre.

Former employers in the town were the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), the Milk Marketing Board and ICI who occupied offices and laboratories at Hornbeam Park where Crimplene was invented in the 1950s and named after the nearby Crimple Valley and beck.

In 2007, two metal detectorists found the Harrogate hoard, a 10th-century Viking treasure hoard, near Harrogate. The hoard contains almost 700 coins and other items from as far away as Afghanistan. The hoard was described by the British Museum as the most important find of its type in Britain for 150 years.

==Governance==

In 1884 the Municipal Borough of Harrogate was created, taking High Harrogate from the civil parish of Bilton with Harrogate and Low Harrogate from the civil parish of Pannal. The borough absorbed neighbouring areas in subsequent years, including the whole of the civil parishes of Bilton and Starbeck, and a large part of the civil parish of Pannal, including the village of Pannal, in 1938. The municipal borough was abolished in 1974, when Harrogate was transferred from the West Riding to North Yorkshire and became part of the wider Borough of Harrogate. Harrogate then became an unparished area, with no local government of its own.

The MP for the Harrogate and Knaresborough constituency is Tom Gordon, a Liberal Democrat. He was elected in 2024, ousting the Conservative who had won the seat at the previous general election.
The town is governed by North Yorkshire Council. Its predecessor, Harrogate Borough Council, was replaced on 1 April 2023. It has had a Conservative majority since the 2010 election.

Harrogate is expected to be reparished, with a town council, on 1 May 2025.

====Former line to Ripon ====
The Ripon line was closed to passengers on 6 March 1967 and to freight on 5 September 1969 as part of the wider Beeching Axe, despite a vigorous campaign by local campaigners, including the city&#x27;s MP.

Today, much of the route of the line through the city is now a relief road; however, the former station still stands and it is now surrounded by a new housing development. The issue remains a significant one in local politics and there are movements to restore the line. Reports suggest the reopening of a line between and Harrogate would be economically viable, costing £40 million and could initially attract 1,200 passengers a day, rising to 2,700. Campaigners renewed their calls on MPs to restore the railway link in 2015.

===Buses===
Bus services are operated predominantly by The Harrogate Bus Company and Connexions Buses. Key routes include:

* Route 36: Buses run every 10 minutes between Harrogate, Leeds (via Harewood, Moortown and Chapel Allerton) and every 30 minutes to Ripon. 
* Route 1: Buses are also every 10 minutes to Knaresborough via Starbeck.
* Route 7: Runs to Leeds via Wetherby, Boston Spa and Seacroft, as well as other parts of semi-rural Leeds. 
* Other routes connect the town to Otley, Bradford, Pateley Bridge, Boroughbridge, Skipton and local estates within Harrogate.

Harrogate bus station is sited in the town centre. It is managed by The Harrogate Bus Company; the 13 stands are also used by other local operators, Flyer and National Express.

In 2018, all bus routes to local housing suburbs within Harrogate became operated by electric buses. These buses charge on stands 1–3 at Harrogate bus station; the scheme is part funded by the government&#x27;s Low Emission Bus Scheme.

===Roads===
Road transport to Leeds is via the A61 (north and central Leeds), A658 (north-west Leeds/Leeds Bradford Airport) and A661 (for north-east Leeds). The A61 continues northwards to Ripon, while the A658 connects to Bradford after passing through north-west Leeds. The A658 also forms the Harrogate by-pass that skirts the south and east of the town, joining the A59 linking York and the A1(M) to the east and Skipton to the west with Harrogate.

<text>The &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; has been translated from the Arabic into most major African, Asian, and European languages. 

Translations of the &quot;Quran&quot; often contain distortions reflecting a translator&#x27;s education, region, sect, and religious ideology. 

Distortions can manifest in many aspects of Muslim beliefs and practices relating to the &quot;Quran&quot;.

== Islamic theology ==
Translation of the Qur&#x27;an from Arabic into other languages has always been a difficult issue in Islamic theology. Because Muslims revere the Qur&#x27;an as miraculous and inimitable (&quot;i&#x27;jaz al-Qur&#x27;an&quot;), they argue that the Qur&#x27;anic text should not be isolated from its true language or written form, at least not without keeping the Arabic text with it.

According to Islamic theology, the Qur&#x27;an is a revelation very specifically in Arabic, and so it should only be recited in Quranic Arabic. Translations into other languages are the work of humans and so, according to Muslims, no longer possess the uniquely sacred character of the Arabic original. Since these translations subtly change the meaning, they are often called &quot;interpretations&quot; or &quot;translation[s] of the meanings&quot; (with &quot;meanings&quot; being ambiguous between the meanings of the various passages and the multiple possible meanings with which each word taken in isolation can be associated, and with the latter connotation amounting to an acknowledgement that the so-called translation is but one possible interpretation and is not claimed to be the full equivalent of the original). For instance, Pickthall called his translation &quot;The Meaning of the Glorious Koran&quot; rather than simply &quot;The Koran&quot;.

The task of translation of the Qur&#x27;an is not an easy one; some native Arab speakers will argue that some Qur&#x27;anic passages are difficult to understand even in the original Arabic script. A part of this is the innate difficulty of any translation; in Arabic, as in other languages, a single word can have a variety of meanings. There is always an element of human judgement involved in understanding and translating a text. This factor is made more complex by the fact that the usage of words has changed a great deal between classical and modern Arabic. As a result, even Qur&#x27;anic verses which seem perfectly clear to native Arab speakers accustomed to modern vocabulary and usage may have an original meaning that is not obvious.

The original meaning of a Qur&#x27;anic passage will also be dependent on the historical circumstances of the prophet Muhammad&#x27;s life and the early community in which it originated. Investigating that context usually requires a detailed knowledge of hadith and sirah, which are themselves vast and complex texts. This introduces an additional element of uncertainty that cannot be eliminated by any linguistic rules of translation.

== History ==
The first translation of the Qur&#x27;an was performed by Salman the Persian, who translated Surah al-Fatiha into the Middle Persian in the early seventh century. According to Islamic tradition contained in the hadith, the Negus of the Ethiopian Empire and the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius received letters from Muhammad containing verses from the Qur&#x27;an. However, during Muhammad&#x27;s lifetime, no passage from the Qur&#x27;an was ever translated into these languages nor any other.

The second known translation was into Greek and was used by Nicetas Byzantius, a scholar from Constantinople, in his &#x27;Refutation of Qur&#x27;an&#x27; written between 855 and 870. However, we know nothing about who and for what purpose had made this translation. It is said that it was a complete translation.

The first fully attested complete translations of the Qur&#x27;an were done between the 10th and 12th centuries into Classical Persian. The Samanid emperor, Mansur I (961–976), ordered a group of scholars from Khorasan to translate the &quot;Tafsir al-Tabari&quot;, originally in Arabic, into Persian. Later in the 11th century, one of the students of Khwaja Abdullah Ansari wrote a complete tafsir of the Qur&#x27;an in Persian. In the 12th century, Najm al-Din &#x27;Umar al-Nasafi translated the Qur&#x27;an into Persian. The manuscripts of all three books have survived and have been published several times.

In 1936, translations in 102 languages were known.

=== European languages ===

==== Latin ====

Robertus Ketenensis produced the first Latin translation of the Qur&#x27;an in 1143 entitled &quot;Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete&quot; (&quot;The law of Mahomet the pseudo prophet&quot;). The translation was made at the behest of Peter the Venerable, abbot of Cluny, and currently exists in the Bibliothèque de l&#x27;Arsenal in Paris. Ketenensis&#x27; work was republished in 1543 in three editions by Theodore Bibliander at Basel. All editions contained a preface by Martin Luther. Many later European translations of the Qur&#x27;an merely translated Ketenensis&#x27; Latin version into their own language, as opposed to translating the Qur&#x27;an directly from Arabic.

In the early thirteenth century, Mark of Toledo made another, more literal, translation into Latin, which survives in several manuscripts. In the fifteenth century, Juan of Segovia produced another translation in collaboration with the Mudejar writer, Isa of Segovia. Only the prologue survives. In the sixteenth century, Juan Gabriel Terrolensis aided Cardenal Eguida da Viterbo in another translation into Latin. In the early seventeenth century, another translation was made, attributed to Cyril Lucaris.

In 1518, Juan Gabriel of Teruel (formerly known as Ali Alayzar), a Muslim convert to Christianity, prepared a Latin translation of the Quran for Giles of Viterbo, who had commissioned the translation for the purpose of converting Muslims to Christianity. Leo Africanus, a Muslim convert who was a godson of Giles of Viterbo, revised the translation in 1525. Surviving manuscripts of the translation are Cambridge MS Mm. v. 26 (C) and Milan MS D 100 inf. (M). MS D 100 Inf was copied by Scottish scholar David Colville in 1621, from a manuscript at the library of El Escorial in Spain. Colville later brought the manuscript to Milan. Today, it is archived at the Biblioteca Ambrosiana.

In 1622, the Genoese Jesuit priest Ignazio Lomellini (1560–1645) translated the Quran into Latin in the little-known &quot;Animadversiones, Notae ac Disputationes in Pestilentem Alcoranum&quot; (MS A-IV-4), a 1622 manuscript that is the oldest surviving example of a European translation of the Quran which also includes the complete original Arabic text.

Louis Maracci (1612–1700), a teacher of Arabic at the Sapienza University of Rome and confessor to Pope Innocent XI, issued an Arabic edition and a second Latin translation in 1698 in Padua. His edition contains the Qur&#x27;an&#x27;s Arabic text with a Latin translation, annotations to further understanding and – embued by the time&#x27;s spirit of controversy – an essay titled &quot;Refutation of the Qur&#x27;an&quot;, where Marracci disproves Islam from the then Catholic point of view. Despite the &quot;Refutation&quot;″s anti-Islamic tendency, Marracci&#x27;s translation is accurate, suitably commented, and quotes many Islamic sources.

Marracci&#x27;s translation too became the source of other European translations (one in France by Savory, and one in German by Nerreter). These later translations were quite inauthentic, and one even claimed to be published in Mecca in 1165 AH.

==== Modern languages ====
The first translation in a modern European language was in Castilian Spanish or Aragonese by the convert Juan Andrés (or so he claims in his ) but this translation is lost. A few dozen Qur&#x27;an verses into Castilian are found within the Confusión itself. There were lost translations in Catalan, one of them by Francesc Pons Saclota in 1382, the other appeared in Perpignan in 1384. Another Romance translation was made into Italian, 1547 by Andrea Arrivabene, derived from Ketenensis&#x27;. The Italian translation was used to derive the first German translation Salomon Schweigger in 1616 in Nuremberg, which in turn was used to derive the first Dutch translation in 1641.

The first French translation came out in 1647, and again in 1775, issued by André du Ryer. The Du Ryer translation also fathered many re-translations, most notably an English version by Alexander Ross in 1649. Ross&#x27; version was used to derive several others: a Dutch version by Glazemaker, a German version by Lange.

==== Adyghe ====
*The first Adyghe translation of the Qur&#x27;an was done by Iskhak Mashbash. A Kabardian edition was also published. It was translated from Russian.

==== English ====

The earliest known translation of the Qur&#x27;an in any European language was the Latin works by Robert of Ketton at the behest of the Abbot of Cluny in . This translation remained the only one until 1649 when the first English language translation was done by Alexander Ross, chaplain to King Charles I, who translated from a French work by du Ryer.

In 1734, George Sale produced the first translation of the Qur&#x27;an direct from Arabic into English but relying heavily on O.M.D. Louis Maracci&#x27;s Vatican Quran. Since then, there have been English translations by the clergyman John Medows Rodwell in 1861, and Edward Henry Palmer in 1880, both showing in their works several mistakes of mistranslation and misinterpretation. These were followed by Richard Bell in 1937 and Arthur John Arberry in the 1950s.

&quot;The Qur&#x27;an&quot; (1910) by Mirza Abul Fazl (1865–1956), a native of East Bengal (now Bangladesh), later moved to Allahabad, India. He was the first Muslim to present a translation of the Qur&#x27;an into English along with the original Arabic text. Among the contemporary Muslim scholars, Abul Fazl was a pioneer who took interest in the study of the chronological order of the Qur&#x27;an and drew the attention of Muslim scholars to its importance.

With the increasing population of English-speaking Muslims around the start of the 20th century, three Muslim translations of the Qur&#x27;an into English made their first appearance. The first was Muhammad Ali&#x27;s 1917 translation, which is composed from an Ahmadiyya perspective, with some small parts being rejected as unorthodox by the vast majority of Muslims. This was followed in 1930 by the English convert to Islam Marmaduke Pickthall&#x27;s more literalist translation.

Soon thereafter in 1934, Abdullah Yusuf Ali, published his translation, featuring copious explanatory annotation – over 6000 notes, generally being around 95% of the text on a given page, to supplement the main text of the translation. This translation has gone through over 30 printings by several different publishing houses, and is one of the most popular amongst English-speaking Muslims, alongside the Pickthall and Saudi-sponsored Hilali-Khan translations.

With few new English translations over the 1950–1980 period, these three Muslim translations were to flourish and cement reputations that were to ensure their survival into the 21st century, finding favor among readers often in newly revised updated editions. Orientalist Arthur Arberry&#x27;s 1955 translation and native Iraqi Jew N. J. Dawood&#x27;s unorthodox translation in 1956 were to be the only major works to appear in the post-war period. A. J. Arberry&#x27;s &quot;The Koran Interpreted&quot; remains the scholarly standard for English translations, and is widely used by academics.

The English translation of Kanzul Iman is called &quot;The Treasure of Faith&quot;, which is translated by Farid Ul Haq. It is in simple, easy-to-understand modern-day English. Explanations are given in brackets to avoid ambiguity, provide better understanding and references to similar verses elsewhere.

Syed Abdul Latif&#x27;s translation published in 1967, is regarded highly by some. He was a professor of English at Osmania University, Hyderabad. It was nevertheless short-lived due to criticism of his foregoing accuracy for the price of fluency.

&quot;The Message of the Qur&#x27;an: Presented in Perspective&quot; (1974) was published by Hashim Amir Ali. He translated the Qur&#x27;an into English and arranged it according to chronological order. Hashim Amir-Ali (1903-) was a native of Salar Jung, Hyderabad State in the Deccan Plateau. In 1938, he came under the influence of Abul Fazl and took a deep interest in the study of the Qur&#x27;an, and was aware of the significance of the chronological order of the passages contained in it.

Another Jewish convert to Islam, Muhammad Asad&#x27;s monumental work &quot;The Message of The Qur&#x27;an&quot; made its appearance for the first time in 1980.

Professor Ahmed Ali&#x27;s &quot;Al-Qur&#x27;an: A Contemporary Translation&quot; (Akrash Publishing, Karachi, 1984, Reprinted by Oxford University Press, Delhi, 1987; Princeton University Press, New Jersey, 1988, with 9th reprinting 2001). Fazlur Rahman Malik of the University of Chicago writes, &quot;It brings out the original rhythms of the Qur&#x27;anic language and the cadences. It also departs from traditional translations in that it gives more refined and differentiated shades of important concepts&quot;. According to Francis Edward Peters of New York University, &quot;Ahmed Ali&#x27;s work is clear, direct, and elegant – a combination of stylistic virtues seldom found in translations of the Qur&#x27;an. His is the best I have read.&quot;

At the cusp of the 1980s, the 1973 oil crisis, the Iranian Revolution, the Nation of Islam and a new wave of cold-war-generated Muslim immigrants to Europe and North America brought Islam squarely into the public limelight for the first time in Western Europe and North America. This resulted in a wave of translations as Western publishers tried to capitalize on the new demand for English translations of the Qur&#x27;an. Oxford University Press and Penguin Books were all to release editions at this time, as did indeed the Saudi Government, which came out with its own re-tooled version of the original Yusuf Ali translation. Canadian Muslim Professor T. B. Irving&#x27;s &#x27;modern English&#x27; translation (1985) was a major Muslim effort during that time. 

&quot;Qur&#x27;an: The Final Testament&quot;, Islamic Productions, Tucson, Arizona, (1989) was published by Rashad Khalifa (; 19 November 1935 – 31 January 1990) Khalifa wrote that he was a messenger of God and that the archangel Gabriel &#x27;most assertively&#x27; told him that chapter 36, verse 3, of the Qur&#x27;an, &#x27;specifically&#x27; referred to him. He is referred to as God&#x27;s Messenger of the Covenant by his followers. He wrote that the Qur&#x27;an contains a mathematical structure based on the number 19. He made the controversial claim that the last two verses of chapter nine in the Qur&#x27;an were not canonical, telling his followers to reject them. He reasoned that the verses disrupted an otherwise flawless nineteen-based pattern and were sacrilegious since they appeared to endorse worship of Muhammad. Khalifa&#x27;s research received little attention in the West. In 1980, Martin Gardner mentioned it in &quot;Scientific American&quot;. Gardner later wrote a more extensive and critical review of Khalifa and his work.

The arrival of the 1990s ushered in the phenomenon of an extensive English-speaking Muslim population well-settled in Western Europe and North America. As a result, several major Muslim translations emerged to meet the ensuing demand. One of them was published in 1990, and it is by the first woman to translate the Qur&#x27;an into English, Amatul Rahman Omar, together with her husband, Abdul Mannan Omar. In 1991 appeared an English translation under the title: &quot;The Clarion Call Of The Eternal Qur-aan&quot;, by Muhammad Khalilur Rahman (b. 1906–1988), Dhaka, Bangladesh. He was the eldest son of Shamsul Ulama Moulana Muhammad Ishaque of Burdwan, West Bengal, India, – a former lecturer of Dhaka University. 

In 1996 the Saudi government financed a new translation &quot;the Hilali-Khan Qur&#x27;an&quot; which was distributed free worldwide by the Saudi government. It has been criticized for being in line with their particular interpretation.

The &quot;Saheeh International&quot; Qur&#x27;an translation was published in 1997 in Saudi Arabia by three women converts. It remains extremely popular.

In 1999, a fresh translation of the Qur&#x27;an into English entitled &quot;The Noble Qur&#x27;an – A New Rendering of its Meaning in English&quot; by Abdalhaqq and the American Aisha Bewley was published by Bookwork, with revised editions being published in 2005 and 2011.

In 2000, &quot;The Majestic Qur&#x27;an: An English Rendition of Its Meanings&quot; was published by a committee of four Turkish Sunni scholars who have divided the work as follows: Nurettin Uzunoğlu translated Surahs (chapters) 1 to 8; Tevfik Rüştü Topuzoğlu: 9 to 20; Ali Özek: 21 to 39; Mehmet Maksutoğlu: 40 to 114. The translation comes with an extensive commentary and annotations in modern standard English, makes it easier to understand than the older translations.

&quot;The Qur&#x27;an in Persian and English&quot; (Bilingual Edition, 2001) features an English translation by the Iranian poet and author Tahereh Saffarzadeh. This was the third translation of the Qur&#x27;an into English by a woman, after Amatul Rahman Omar, and Aisha Bewley – and the first bilingual translation of the Qur&#x27;an.

In 2003, the English translation of the 8-volume &quot;Ma&#x27;ariful Qur&#x27;an&quot; was completed and the translation of the Qurʻan used for it was newly done by Muhammad Taqi Usmani in collaboration with his brother Wali Raazi Usmani and his teachers, Professors Hasan Askari and Muhammad Shameem.

In 2004, a new translation of the Qur&#x27;an by Muhammad Abdel-Haleem was also published, with revised editions being published in 2005 and 2008.

In 2006, &quot;The Qur&#x27;an with Annotated Interpretation in Modern English&quot; by Ali Ünal was published. The work is more like a simplified tafsir (Qur&#x27;anic exegesis) than a translation. He uses modern English, and adds short notes between brackets amidst the translation when needed.

In 2007, &quot;Qur&#x27;an: a Reformist Translation&quot; by Edip Yüksel, Layth Saleh al-Shaiban, and Martha Schulte-Nafeh, was published.

In 2007, &quot;The Meanings of the Noble Qur&#x27;an with Explanatory Notes&quot; by Muhammad Taqi Usmani was published. It has been published in 2 volumes at first and later, in a single volume. He also translated the Qur&#x27;an in simple Urdu, making him a translator of the Qur&#x27;an in dual languages.

In 2007 &quot;The Sublime Qur&#x27;an&quot; appeared by Laleh Bakhtiar; it is the second translation of the Qur&#x27;an by an American woman.

In 2008, Tarif Khalidi completed &quot;The Qur&#x27;an: A New Translation&quot; for Penguin Classics and Viking Press. It did not include commentary, so as to give readers a sense of how the earliest Muslims would have read and listened to the Qur&#x27;an. It serves as a replacement to Penguin Classics&#x27; older translation by NJ Dawood, although the Dawood translation remains in print.

In 2009, Wahiduddin Khan translated the Qur&#x27;an in English, which was published by Goodword Books entitled &quot;The Qur&#x27;an: Translation and Commentary with Parallel Arabic Text&quot;. This translation is considered as the easiest to understand due to simple and modern English. The pocket-size version of this translation with only English text is widely distributed as part of dawah work.

A rhymed verse edition of the entire Qur&#x27;an rendered in English by Thomas McElwain in 2010 includes rhymed commentary under the hardback title &quot;The Beloved and I, Volume Five&quot;, and the paperback title &quot;The Beloved and I: Contemplations on the Qur&#x27;an&quot;.

In 2015, Mustafa Khattab of Al-Azhar University completed &quot;The Clear Qur&#x27;an: A Thematic English Translation&quot;, after three years of collaboration with a team of scholars, editors, and proof-readers. Noted for its clarity, accuracy, and flow, this work is believed to be the first English translation done in Canada.

A Turkish Scholar Hakkı Yılmaz worked on the Qur&#x27;an through the root meanings of the Arabic words and published a study called &quot;Tebyin-ül Qur&#x27;an&quot;, and he also published a Division by Division Interpretation in the Order of Revelation in Turkish. His work was translated into English.

In 2018, Musharraf Hussain released &quot;The Majestic Quran: A Plain English Translation&quot;, a reader-friendly presentation of the translation of the Qur&#x27;an aiming to help readers understand the topic being read, and learn the moving and transformative message of the Qur&#x27;an. There are 1500 sections with headings. Approved by Dar al-Ifta&#x27; al-Misriyya (Egyptian institute of Fatwas).

In 2019, Tahir Mahmood Kiani released &quot;The Easy Quran&quot;. The translation was intended for readers at age 12, but was also comprehensible to readers as young as 6.

In 2021, Talal Itani released &quot;Quran in English: Super-easy to read. For ages 9 to 99.&quot; A Quran translation for children and adults.

In 2022, Nuh Ha Mim Keller released &quot;The Quran Beheld&quot;. Based on two integral study readings over fifteen years with a teacher, it was described by a reviewer as &quot;the first reliable plenary translation of the Quran into English.&quot;

In 2023, a new translation of the Quran was produced through a collaboration between Talal Itani and artificial intelligence. This translation is noted for its attempt to balance readability with linguistic precision. It aims to be accessible to a wide range of readers, including children and adults, as well as both Muslims and non-Muslims. The translation strives for a non-sectarian approach and emphasizes grammatical accuracy. The collaboration between Itani, a scholar in Quranic studies, and machine learning algorithms represents an innovative approach in the field of Quran translations.

==== French ====

 / translaté d&#x27;Arabe François par le Sieur Du Ryer, Sieur de la Garde Malezair., 1647, 1649, 1672, 1683, 1719, 1734, 1770, 1775, by André Du Ryer, was the first French translation. This was followed two centuries later in Paris by the 1840 translation by Kasimirski who was an interpreter for the French Persian legation. Then in the mid-twentieth century, a new translation was done by Régis Blachère a French Orientalist followed a few years later in 1959 by the first translation by a Muslim into the French Language from the original Arabic. This work of Muhammad Hamidullah continues to be reprinted and published in Paris and Lebanon as it is regarded as the most linguistically accurate of all translations although critics may complain there is some loss of the spirit of the Arabic original.

==== Modern Greek ====
The first Modern Greek translation was done by Gerasimos Pentakis in 1886, after receiving royal approval from George I of Greece. A second edition was published in 1928. Another three were published in 1958, 1980 and 2002, the most recent was done from Persa Koumoutsi. There is also an online translation. In Greek, there is also the 9th century translation of Nicetas Byzantios referred earlier in the article.

==== Russian ====
In 1716, Pyotr Postinkov published the first translation of the Quran in Russian based on the French translation of André du Ryer. Gordiy Sablukov published the first Russian translation of the Quran from the original Arabic text in 1873. Nearly 20 translations in Russian have been published.

==== Spanish ====
There are four complete translations of the Qur&#x27;an in modern Spanish that are commonly available.
* Julio Cortes translation &#x27;El Coran&#x27; is widely available in North America, being published by New York-based &quot;Tahrike Tarsile Qur&#x27;an&quot; publishing house.

* Abdel Ghani Melara Navio a Spaniard who converted to Islam in 1979, his &#x27;Traduccion-Comentario Del Noble Coran&#x27; was originally published by &quot;Darussalam Publications&quot;, Riyadh, in December 1997. The &quot;King Fahd Printing Complex&quot; has its own version of this translation, with editing by Omar Kaddoura and Isa Amer Quevedo.

=== Asian languages ===

==== Bengali ====
In 1389, Shah Muhammad Sagir, one of the oldest poets of Bengali literature, was the first to translate surahs of the Qur&#x27;an into the old Bengali language. Girish Chandra Sen, a Brahmo Samaj missionary, was the first person to produce a complete translation of the Qur&#x27;an into the Bengali language in 1886, although an incomplete translation was made by Amiruddin Basunia in 1808.

This version is framed for Japanese cultural sensibilities around a narrative in which a wise old Muslim man meets a kawaii-coded djinn in a mosque who is drawn to the sound of Qur&#x27;an recitation and wishes to learn more about Islam. The two then embark on a journey through time and space as the story of the Qur&#x27;an unfolds. Various surahs are included in full throughout. The nameless protagonist, not Muhammad, is the man on the book&#x27;s cover. Muhammad does appear and even speaks to the two main characters, but he is depicted as a cloaked figure without a face.

==== Turkish ====
The earliest Quranic translation in the Turkish or Turkic language dates back to the 11th century. One of his later translation works is the copy written in the Khorezmian Turkic language in 1363, which is registered in Istanbul&#x27;s Suleymaniye Library, Hekimoğlu Ali Paşa mosque No:2. This translation in Khorezmian Turkic, like other translations of the Qur&#x27;an, is important for language studies. Because the sanctity of the text that is subject to translation will cause the translator to behave more carefully, the errors encountered in the text are not included in such works. Besides, attention was paid to the religious terminology to be understood by the public and that is why Turkic words are given weight. G. Sağol worked on the translation in question.
Muhammed Hamdi Yazır worked on tafsir (Qur&#x27;anic exegesis) in the Maturidi context, and published his &quot;Hakk Dīni Kur&#x27;an Dili&quot;, the first Modern Turkish translation of Quran in 1935 by the orders of Kemal Ataturk.

In 1999, the Turkish translation of the Qur&#x27;an, MESAJ by Edip Yüksel was published, about seven years after the publication of his book, &quot;Türkçe Kuran Çevirilerindeki Hatalar&quot; (&quot;Errors in Turkish Translations of the Qur&#x27;an&quot;). The translation is a Quranist translation, similar to the translation by Yaşar Nuri Öztürk, and does not consider hadith and sectarian traditional jurisprudence as an authority in understanding the Qur&#x27;an. It differs greatly from Sunni and Shia traditions in the translation of numerous crucial words and verses.

Hakkı Yılmaz worked on the Qur&#x27;an through the root meanings of the Arabic words and published a study called Tebyin-ül Qur&#x27;an. And he also published a Division by Division Interpretation in the Order of Revelation.

<text>The Rev James Alexander Haldane aka Captain James Haldane (14 July 1768 – 8 February 1851) was a Scottish independent church leader following an earlier life as a sea captain.

== Biography ==
The youngest son of Captain James Haldane of Airthrey Castle (who died two weeks before he was born), (his older brother Robert Haldane was also a clergyman) in Stirlingshire, he was born at Dundee. His mother was sister to Admiral Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan.

He was educated first at Dundee Grammar School and afterwards at the High School in Edinburgh and University of Edinburgh. At the age of seventeen he joined the Honorable East India Company as a midshipman on board the ship, the &quot;Duke of Montrose&quot;. After four voyages to India, in the summer of 1793, he was promoted to captain and commander of the &quot;Melville Castle&quot;. He started a careful study of the Bible during his voyages, and also came under the evangelical influence of David Bogue of Gosport, one of the founders of the London Missionary Society.

He briefly returned to Scotland in 1793, and began preaching on an itinerant basis. He remained in HEICS until 1797, his final action being on home ground in the Spithead mutiny, where he boarded the &quot;Dutton&quot;. He left the HEICS in the summer of 1797 and, encouraged by friends, began as a lay preacher in Gilmerton south of Edinburgh.

=== Evangelism ===
In about 1796 he became acquainted with the celebrated evangelical, Charles Simeon of Cambridge, in whose company he toured Scotland, distributing tracts and trying to awaken others to an interest in religious subjects. 

He moved to Edinburgh and befriended Rev David Black of Lady Yester&#x27;s Kirk and Walter Buchanan Second Charge of Canongate Kirk who persuaded him to become a minister.

In May 1797 he preached his first sermon, at Gilmerton near Edinburgh, with encouraging success. In the same year he established a non-sectarian organization for tract distribution and lay preaching called the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel at Home. During the next few years he made repeated missionary journeys, preaching wherever he could obtain hearers, and generally in the open air.

Around 1815 he moved to the city centre, living at 16 George Street and began preaching at the huge Tabernacle Church at the head of Leith Walk (now the site of the Playhouse Theatre).

Haldane was never a preacher for the Church of Scotland, but was an evangelical preacher, who proved more popular than the established church. His studies of the New Testament led him to leave that denomination behind and work in an independent church movement. Along with his brother, Robert Haldane, and others, James established 85 independent churches in Scotland and Ireland. Churches originated by the Haldanes practised baptism by immersion, weekly communion, and congregational polity (autonomous government). The Haldanes also operated a seminary and were influenced in their principles by other independency thinkers such as John Glas and Robert Sandeman of the Glasite church.

As advancing years compelled him to withdraw from the more exhausting labours of travel and open-air preaching, he sought to influence the discussion of current religious and theological questions by means of the press. In later years he adopted Baptist views.

He lived his final years at 34 Drummond Place in Edinburgh&#x27;s Second New Town.

He died on 8 February 1851 aged 82, and is buried in the Haldane family plot in St Cuthbert&#x27;s Churchyard at the west end of Princes Street in Edinburgh. The grave lies immediately east of the church on the wall backing onto Princes Street Gardens.

==Family==

<text>Charles Simeon (24 September 1759 – 13 November 1836) was an English evangelical Anglican cleric.

==Life and career==
He was born at Reading, Berkshire, in 1759 and baptised at St Laurence&#x27;s parish church on 24 October of that year. He was the fourth and youngest son of Richard Simeon (died 1784) and Elizabeth Hutton. His eldest brother, named Richard after their father, died early. His second brother, John, entered the legal profession, became an MP and received a baronetcy. The third brother, Edward Simeon, was a director of the Bank of England.

Simeon was educated at Eton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. As an undergraduate at King&#x27;s from 1779, brought up in the high church tradition, he read &quot;The Whole Duty of Man&quot; and then a work by Thomas Wilson on the sacrament, and taking communion at Easter experienced a Christian conversion. In 1782 he became a fellow of King&#x27;s College and was ordained a deacon. He graduated B.A. in 1783 and, in the same year, was ordained a priest of the Church of England. He began his ministry as deputy to Christopher Atkinson (1754–1795) at St Edward King and Martyr, Cambridge. Atkinson introduced him to John Venn and Simeon then met Henry Venn, confirming his evangelical and Calvinist views.

Simeon received the living of Holy Trinity Church, Cambridge, in 1783. The appointment, technically a curacy, followed the death of the Rev. Henry Therond. Simeon&#x27;s father intervened with James Yorke, the Bishop of Ely, and he was appointed, under the age of 23, as a curate-in-charge for the bishop. He was at first unpopular, and indeed the congregation would have preferred John Hammond (died 1830), who had been curate there, and became lecturer. Services were disrupted, and he was insulted in the streets. Simeon remained there for the rest of his life, eventually with a crowded church.

Simeon died, unmarried, on 13 November 1836, and was buried on 19 November in King&#x27;s College Chapel, Cambridge. His memorial by Humphrey Hopper in Holy Trinity, Cambridge, was described by architectural critic Nikolaus Pevsner as an &quot;epitaph in Gothic forms.&quot;

==Influence==

Simeon gained influence among the undergraduates of the university. He became a leader among evangelical churchmen, and was one of the founders of the Church Missionary Society in 1799. He also helped found the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews (now known as the Church&#x27;s Ministry Among Jewish People or CMJ) in 1809, and acted as adviser to the British East India Company in the choice of chaplains for India.

According to the historian Thomas Macaulay, Simeon&#x27;s &quot;authority and influence … extended from Cambridge to the most remote corners of England ... his real sway in the Church was far greater than that of any primate.&quot;

==Works==
In 1792, Simeon read &quot;An Essay on the Composition of a Sermon&quot; by the French Reformed minister Jean Claude. Simeon found that their principles were identical and used the essay as the basis for his lectures on sermon composition. Claude&#x27;s essay also inspired Simeon to make clear his own theological position. He published hundreds of sermons and sermon outlines (called &quot;sermon skeletons&quot;), still in print, that to some were an invitation to clerical plagiarism. His chief work is a commentary on the whole Bible, entitled &quot;Horae homileticae&quot; (London).

==Legacy==
Simeon is remembered in the Church of England with a lesser festival and in the Anglican Church of Canada, as well as the Anglican Church in North America, with a Commemoration on 13 November. He is commemorated in the Episcopal Church of the United States with a Lesser Feast on 12 November.

He established a trust for the purpose of acquiring church patronage to perpetuate evangelical clergy in Church of England parishes. It arose from the bequest of John Thornton, who died in 1813, of ten advowsons, left to a trust, of which Simeon was one of the trustees. Simeon expanded the group of livings with money he had inherited. The Simeon&#x27;s Trustees, of what was called the Simeon Fund, are responsible for the patronage (or a share of the patronage) in over 160 Church of England parishes.

There is also a Charles Simeon Trust, founded in 2001, and the Charles Simeon Institute, established in 2014, that operate in the United States and Canada.

<text>The University of South Dakota (USD) is a public research university in Vermillion, South Dakota, United States. Established by the Dakota Territory legislature in 1862, 27 years before the establishment of the state of South Dakota, USD is the flagship university of South Dakota and the state&#x27;s oldest public university. It occupies a campus located in southeastern South Dakota, approximately southwest of Sioux Falls, northwest of Sioux City, Iowa, and north of the Missouri River.

The university is home to South Dakota&#x27;s only medical school and law school. It is also home to the National Music Museum, with over 15,000 American, European, and non-Western instruments. USD is governed by the South Dakota Board of Regents, and its president is Sheila Gestring. The university has been accredited by the North Central Association of College and Schools since 1913. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

University of South Dakota&#x27;s alumni include a total of 17 Truman Scholars, 12 Rhodes Scholars, and 1 Nobel Laureate (Ernest Lawrence &#x27;1922, 1939 Nobel Prize in Physics). The athletic teams compete in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I as members of The Summit League, except football, which competes in the Missouri Valley Football Conference.

==History==
The University of South Dakota was founded in 1862 by the Dakota Territorial Legislature which authorized the establishment of the University at Vermillion. The authorization was unfunded, however, and classes did not begin until 20 years later under the auspices of the privately incorporated University of Dakota, created with support from the citizens of Clay County. Ephraim Epstein served as the first president and primary faculty member in the institution that opened in loaned space in downtown Vermillion. Before 1883 ended, the university had moved into Old Main, and the first public board was appointed to govern the institution.

Enrollment increased to 69 students by the end of 1883, and, by the time South Dakota became the 40th state in 1889, the university boasted an enrollment of 500 students. The school&#x27;s name was updated in 1891 to reflect the division of the Dakota Territory, becoming the University of South Dakota. USD&#x27;s first academic unit, the College of Arts and Sciences, was established in 1883. The School of Law began offering classes in 1901; the School of Medicine in 1907; Continuing Education in 1916; the Graduate School in 1927; and the College of Fine Arts in 1931. The School of Business began offering classes in 1927 and has been continuously accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) since 1949.

It is the state&#x27;s oldest public university and is one of six universities governed by the South Dakota Board of Regents. USD has been accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools since 1913 and is a member of the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities. The school houses the state&#x27;s only law and medical schools and the lone College of Fine Arts.

==Campus==
The University of South Dakota is based on a campus along the bluffs near the Missouri River in the southeast corner of the state. The most prominent academic facility on campus, one of the school&#x27;s symbols, is Old Main. It was built in 1883, burned down in 1893, and was fully restored in 1997. Along with several classrooms, it houses the Oscar Howe Gallery and the University Honors Program. Farber Hall, a 190-seat theater used mainly for speaking engagements, is also in Old Main.

===Campus and academic buildings===

USD opened the newly constructed Theodore R. and Karen K. Muenster University Center (MUC) for student use on February 17, 2009. The MUC houses the Student Activities Center, a campus dining facility, coffee shop, bookstore, convenience store and a number of lounge and TV areas. It was expanded on January 13, 2014, to include more food and entertainment options.

One of the newest additions to the campus is the Al Neuharth Media Center, named for the founder of &quot;USA Today&quot;. Dedicated in September 2003, the Neuharth Center houses the news and media organizations on campus, including the Freedom Forum’s South Dakota operations, South Dakota Public Broadcasting, the Department of Contemporary Media and Journalism, the campus newspaper &quot;The Volante&quot;, campus radio station KAOR, and television station KYOT. Formerly an armory and athletic field house, the building was converted into a media center through donations made by Al Neuharth, a 1950 USD graduate.

==== Galleries ====
The University of South Dakota has two main galleries: The John A. Day Gallery located in the Fine Arts building and the Oscar Howe Gallery located in Old Main. There are several other locations across campus that are designated gallery space, such as the hallway on the second floor of the Muenster University Center.

===Wellness Center &amp; Dakota Dome===
A $15 million, wellness center opened in the spring of 2011. Located just north of the Warren M. Lee Center for the Fine Arts, the center includes state-of-the-art workout equipment, a multi-story climbing wall, multiple courts for basketball and volleyball, racquetball courts, and a three-lane walking/jogging track.

The DakotaDome serves not only as the home venue for the school&#x27;s football, softball, swimming, basketball, volleyball, and track and field teams, but also as a recreational center for the student body. It is South Dakota&#x27;s only domed football stadium, hosting the state&#x27;s high school football championships in November.

==Academics==

The University of South Dakota has the state&#x27;s only law and medical schools. , the university has seven colleges and universities offering 205 undergraduate and 75 graduate programs, including:

* College of Arts and Sciences
* Beacom School of Business
* School of Education
* College of Fine Arts
* School of Health Sciences
* School of Law
* School of Medicine

==Student life==
The University of South Dakota has over 170 student organizations.

===Greek life===
There are several fraternities and sororities on campus.

=== Homecoming – Dakota Days ===
The homecoming tradition of Dakota Days started in 1914 under President Robert L. Slagle. In 2014, USD celebrated its 100th Dakota Days.

==Media==
===&quot;Coyote News&quot;===
In fall 2005, USD&#x27;s Media &amp; Journalism Department revived its weekly live 30-minute television newscast, &quot;Coyote News&quot;. It is entirely produced, directed &amp; reported by USD students.

===Coyote Radio===
In 2011 KAOR FM was renamed Coyote Radio, following the University of South Dakota&#x27;s decision to end the U. Campaign. The central on-campus headquarters for KAOR Radio is the Al Neuharth Media Center while the transmitter lies atop Slagle Hall on USD&#x27;s campus.

===The Volante===
&quot;The Volante&quot; (Spanish for &quot;steering wheel&quot;) has served as the campus newspaper since 1887. Managed entirely by a staff of about 20 students in 2025, &quot;The Volante&quot; prides itself on its editorial independence. The paper has won numerous awards, including a number of Best of Show and Pacemakers. In October 2011 it was awarded its 8th Pacemaker Award, sometimes called the Pulitzer Prize of college journalism, by the Associated Collegiate Press.

===Department media===
The &quot;Vermillion Literary Project Magazine&quot; is a literary journal published by the English Department of the University of South Dakota. It is staffed by undergraduate and graduate students.

===South Dakota Public Broadcasting===
The university is home to South Dakota Public Broadcasting. It is a network of Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television and NPR radio stations serving the state of South Dakota.

==Athletics==


The University of South Dakota sponsors six sports for men (football, basketball, swimming &amp; diving, cross country, track &amp; field and golf) and nine sports for women (basketball, swimming &amp; diving, cross country, track &amp; field, golf, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball). The school&#x27;s athletic teams are called the &quot;Coyotes&quot; (pronounced Ki Yoat) and nicknamed the &quot;Yotes&quot; (Yoats). The school colors are red and white. USD competes at the NCAA Division I level (Football Championship Subdivision in football) and is a member of The Summit League for all sports except football. Its football team is a member of the Missouri Valley Football Conference. Athletic facilities include the DakotaDome, for football and indoor track, the Sanford Coyote Sports Center for volleyball and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, First Bank &amp; Trust Soccer Complex and Lillibridge Track Complex.

The long-time intrastate rivalry between the Coyotes and South Dakota State Jackrabbits ended in 2003 when SDSU moved to Division I athletics and the Coyotes remained in Division II. USD eventually moved up to Division I and in the 2011–2012 academic year, SDSU and USD resumed regularly scheduled contests in most sports when the Coyotes joined the athletics conferences in which SDSU was a member, the Summit League and the Missouri Valley Football Conference.

The University of South Dakota fight songs include &quot;South Dakota Victory&quot;, &quot;Hail South Dakota&quot; and &quot;Get Along Coyotes&quot;.

The University of South Dakota&#x27;s mascot of Coyotes comes from a horse race in 1863 in which a Dakota horse outran a horse from Iowa, in which someone from Iowa stated, &quot;look at the Kiote run.&quot;

<text>In database design, object-oriented programming and design, has-a (has_a or has a) is a composition relationship where one object (often called the constituted object, or part/constituent/member object) &quot;belongs to&quot; (is part or member of) another object (called the composite type), and behaves according to the rules of ownership. In simple words, has-a relationship in an object is called a member field of an object. Multiple has-a relationships will combine to form a possessive hierarchy.

==Related concepts==
&quot;Has-a&quot; is to be contrasted with an &quot;is-a&quot; (&quot;is_a&quot; or &quot;is a&quot;) relationship which constitutes a taxonomic hierarchy (subtyping).

The decision whether the most logical relationship for an object and its subordinate is not always clearly &quot;has-a&quot; or &quot;is-a&quot;. Confusion over such decisions have necessitated the creation of these metalinguistic terms. A good example of the &quot;has-a&quot; relationship is containers in the C++ STL.

To summarize the relations, we have

* hypernym-hyponym (supertype-subtype) relations between types (classes) defining a taxonomic hierarchy, where
** for an inheritance relation: a hyponym (subtype, subclass) has a &quot;type-of&quot; (&quot;is-a&quot;) relationship with its hypernym (supertype, superclass);
* holonym-meronym (whole/entity/container-part/constituent/member) relations between types (classes) defining a possessive hierarchy, where 
** for an aggregation (i.e. without ownership) relation: 
*** a holonym (whole) has a &quot;has-a&quot; relationship with its meronym (part),
** for a composition (i.e. with ownership) relation: 
*** a meronym (constituent) has a &quot;part-of&quot; relationship with its holonym (entity),
** for a containment relation:
*** a meronym (member) has a &quot;member-of&quot; relationship with its holonym (container);
* concept-object (type-token) relations between types (classes) and objects (instances), where
** a token (object) has an &quot;instance-of&quot; relationship with its type (class).

==Examples==
=== Entity–relationship model ===
In databases has-a relationships are usually represented in an Entity–relationship model. As you can see by the diagram on the right an account can have multiple characters. This shows that account has a &quot;has-a&quot; relationship with character.

=== UML class diagram ===

In object-oriented programming this relationship can be represented with a Unified Modeling Language Class diagram. This has-a relationship is also known as composition. As you can see from the Class Diagram on the right a car &quot;has-a&quot; carburetor, or a car is &quot;composed of&quot; a carburetor. When the diamond is coloured black it signifies composition, i.e. the object on the side closest to the diamond is made up of or contains the other object. While the white diamond signifies aggregation, which means that the object closest to the diamond can have or possess the other object.

=== C++ ===

Another way to distinguish between composition and aggregation in modeling the real world, is to consider the relative lifetime of the contained object. For example, if a Car object contains a Chassis object, a Chassis will most likely not be replaced during the lifetime of the Car. It will have the same lifetime as the car itself; so the relationship is one of composition. On the other hand, if the Car object contains a set of Tire objects, these Tire objects may wear out and get replaced several times. Or if the Car becomes unusable, some Tires may be salvaged and assigned to another Car. At any rate, the Tire objects have different lifetimes than the Car object; therefore the relationship is one of aggregation.

If one were to make a C++ software Class to implement the relationships described above, the Car object would contain a complete Chassis object in a data member. This Chassis object would be instantiated in the constructor of the Car class (or defined as the data type of the data member and its properties assigned in the constructor.) And since it would be a wholly contained data member of the Car class, the Chassis object would no longer exist if a Car class object was to be deleted.

On the other hand, the Car class data members that point to Tire objects would most likely be C++ pointers. Tire objects could be instantiated and deleted externally, or even assigned to data members of a different Car object. Tire objects would have an independent lifetime separate from when the Car object was deleted.

<text>Thomas Erskine of Linlathen (13 October 178820 March 1870) was a Scottish advocate and lay theologian in the early part of the 19th century. With his friend the Reverend John McLeod Campbell he attempted a revision of Calvinism.

==Life==
Erskine was the youngest son of David and Ann Erskine. His great-grandfather was Colonel John Erskine of Carnock, near Dunfermline. The colonel&#x27;s son was John Erskine of Carnock whose second son, David, was a writer to the signet, and purchased the estate of Linlathen, near Dundee; by the death without surviving issue of his elder brothers, it came into the possession of Thomas Erskine in 1816.

After his father&#x27;s death when he was very young, Erskine was left largely to the care of his maternal grandmother, Mrs. Graham of Airth Castle, a Stirling of Ardoch, Episcopalian and a strong Jacobite. Erskine was educated at the Edinburgh High School, a school in Durham, and the University of Edinburgh, and was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates in 1810. He took a place in the literary society of Edinburgh.

Inheriting by the death of his brother James the estate of Linlathen, Erskine retired from the bar, and gave himself up to the study of questions of theology. He travelled and made friends including Thomas Carlyle, Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, Alexander Ewing, F. D. Maurice, Lucien-Anatole Prévost-Paradol, Alexandre Vinet, Adolphe Monod, and Madame de Broglie. He initially wrote extensively on contemporary religious controversies.

In 1831 the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland deposed John McLeod Campbell, minister of Rhu, for preaching the doctrine of universal atonement. Erskine strongly supported Campbell, and went further in doctrine, espousing universal reconciliation.

When Erskine died at home in 1870, his last words were: &quot;Lord Jesus!&quot;

==Works==
Erskine was known as the author of:

*&quot;Remarks on the Internal Evidence for the Truth of Revealed Religion&quot; (1820);
* an &quot;Essay on Faith&quot; (1822); and 
* &quot;Unconditional Freeness of the Gospel&quot; (1828).

These books all passed through several editions. Erskine also authored &quot;The Brazen Serpent&quot; (1831), and then wrote &quot;The Doctrine of Election&quot;, a lengthy treatise on the theological doctrine of predestination and interaction with Paul&#x27;s Letter to the Romans, which appeared in 1837. This was the final work during his lifetime.

A posthumously published work was &quot;The Spiritual Order and Other Papers&quot; (1871). Two volumes of his letters, edited by William Hanna, appeared in 1877.

==Views==

Erskine was an Episcopalian, self-taught in theology. He emphasized the loving side of God&#x27;s nature, supported the universal atonement of Christ, and was critical of the typical federal theology of the Scottish Calvinism of his time.

The work &quot;The Doctrine of Election&quot; has a purpose and theme that may be summed up as follows:

The current form of Calvinistic doctrine goes against human experience and the real message of Scripture. The powers of good and evil, of God and the self, strive within every person&#x27;s soul. A person&#x27;s &#x27;elective will&#x27; in one&#x27;s own personality determines with which of the other two wills one chooses to side. This last will only chooses which of the two shall be dominant. Thus, God inwardly encourages us to choose the good, the true and the beautiful—we are not agents of our own good decision making, but rather we choose that which God has already chosen for us.

As Erskine studied the Bible text he became convinced that it &quot;presented a history of wondrous love in order to excite gratitude, of a high and holy worth, to attract veneration and esteem. It presented a view of danger, to produce alarm; of refuge to confer peace and joy; and of eternal glory, to animate hope.&quot; A quote shows some of his thinking:

Christ, the gift of God&#x27;s present forgiving love to every man and woman, is the door through which alone we can enter into our provision of hope. Until we know the love of our Father&#x27;s heart to us, as manifested in Christ, the future must always be to us at best a dark and doubtful wilderness. But when we know that all that we have conceived of our Father&#x27;s love, is as nothing to the reality—that he is indeed love itself—a love passing knowledge—a shoreless, boundless, bottomless ocean-fountain of love, of holy, sin-hating, sin-destroying love, which longs over us that we should be filled with itself—and be by it delivered from the power of evil—then, indeed, we are saved by hope, for we know that love must triumph and fulfill all its counsel.

==Reputation==

In his day and time Erskine was influential on theologically forward-thinking pastors and theologians. The German church historian Otto Pfleiderer &quot;regard[ed] [Erskine&#x27;s] ideas as the best contribution to dogmatics which British theology has produced in the present century.&quot; He influenced especially Frederick Denison Maurice, Alexander John Scott and George MacDonald.

<text>The National Music Museum: America&#x27;s Shrine to Music &amp; Center for Study of the History of Musical Instruments (NMM) is a musical instrument museum in Vermillion, South Dakota, United States. It was founded in 1973 on the campus of the University of South Dakota. The NMM is recognized as &quot;A Landmark of American Music&quot; by the National Music Council.

The NMM&#x27;s renowned collections, which include American, European, and non-Western instruments from a wide breadth cultures and historical periods, are among the world&#x27;s most inclusive. They contain many of the earliest, best preserved, and historically most Western important instruments known to survive. The quality and scope of the NMM has earned it international recognition.

In August 2023, the museum re-opened its permanent exhibitions following a multi-year renovation and reinstallation. Alongside a modern addition to the historic Carnegie Library building, the new galleries offer over 16,000 square feet of displays showcasing the way musical instruments, across time and space, a part of our lives. 

The museum&#x27;s current director is Dwight Vaught.

==Background==

The NMM was founded as a partnership between the University of South Dakota, which provides staff and facilities for preservation, teaching, and research, and the Board of Trustees of the NMM, a non-profit, 501(c)(3) corporation that is responsible for acquisitions, public exhibiting, and programming. The NMM was established around the private musical-instrument collection, numbering approximately 2500 instruments, of Arne B. Larson. Larson&#x27;s son, Dr. André P. Larson, was the founding director of the museum until his retirement in 2011.

The NMM is housed in a complex that incorporates an historic building (originally the university&#x27;s library, built in 1910 with a grant from Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s library building program) mated with a modern addition, which was opened in 2021. The Concert Hall has superb acoustics and provides a perfect setting for performing and recording music played on original instruments of various historical periods and cultural milieu. There is a specialized library, extensive study-storage areas, and a laboratory for the conservation and restoration of the instruments. There are violin-making tools and Baroque fittings, early harpsichord and fortepiano tuning hammers, and 1,000 brass instrument mouthpieces from virtually every turn-of-the-century manufacturer.

It also has rich holdings of related objects and archival materials, such as the unequaled Salabue-Fiorini-De Wit-Hermann-Witten-Rawlins Collection of 650 violin makers&#x27; labels. The American musical instrument manufacturers archives is the largest of its kind. Scholars from around the world make frequent use of the NMM&#x27;s collections and facilities, providing an important opportunity for students to meet and work with individuals on the latest scholarship on musical research.

==Collection==

The NMM is the only place in the world where one can find two 18th-century grand pianos with the specific type of action conceived by the piano&#x27;s inventor, Bartolomeo Cristofori. One of these, built in 1767 by Manuel Antunes of Lisbon, is the earliest signed and dated piano by a maker native to Portugal; the other, built by Louis Bas in Villeneuve-lès-Avignon in 1781, is the earliest extant French grand piano.

Other extraordinary keyboards include a Neapolitan virginal (ca. 1520), three 17th-century Flemish harpsichords (two by Andreas Ruckers), 17th- and 18th-century English, German, Portuguese, and French harpsichords, and German and Swedish clavichords.

A group of 500 instruments made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by the C.G. Conn Company of Elkhart, Indiana, is a resource unparalleled anywhere for historical research about a major American industry and the American band movement.

The NMM&#x27;s holdings by 17th- and 18th-century Nürnberg makers of wind instruments, including members of the Denner, Ehe, Haas, Oberlender, and Steinmetz families, as well as Ernst Busch, Paul Hainlein, Johann Benedikt Gahn, Johann Carl Kodisch, Leonhard Maussiel, Michael Nagel, and Paulus Schmidt, are unique outside of Germany.

The NMM&#x27;s holdings of 17th- and 18th-century Dutch woodwind instruments by such makers as Richard Haka (represented here by a soprano recorder made ca. 1690), Hendrik Richters, Philip Borkens, and Abraham van Aardenberg is unique outside of the Netherlands.

The Witten-Rawlins Collection of early Italian stringed instruments crafted by Andrea Guarneri, Antonio Stradivari, three generations of the Amati family, and others by far surpasses any in Italy. Included are two 17th-century Cremonese stringed instruments preserved in unaltered condition. Additionally, the NMM preserves one of four Stradivari guitars to be seen in a museum setting, and one of only two Stradivari mandolins known to survive.

The sum of these groups of American, Dutch, German, and Italian instruments is to be found nowhere else.

The 1994 addition of the John Powers Saxophone Collection (Aspen, Colorado) and the Cecil Leeson Saxophone Collection and Archives (transferred from Ball State University) make the NMM the preeminent center for studying the history of the saxophone.

The 1996 addition of the Rosario Mazzeo (Carmel, California) and the Bill Maynard (Massapequa, New York) Clarinet Collections make the NMM the preeminent center for studying the clarinet.

The 1999 addition of the Joe &amp; Joella Utley (Spartanburg, South Carolina) Collection and the establishment of the Utley Institute for Brass Studies makes the NMM the preeminent center for studying the history of brass instruments.

The Alan Bates Harmonica Collection and Archives (Wilmington, Delaware), received as a gift in 2000, is second in size and importance only to the Harmonika Museum in Trossingen, Germany.

The 2005 gift of the D&#x27;Angelico, D&#x27;Aquisto, Gudelsky Workshop was the focus of a major exhibition, &quot;Great American Guitars&quot; (by D&#x27;Angelico, D&#x27;Aquisto, Fender, Gibson, Martin, and Stromberg-Voisinet).

In April 2007, the museum outbid New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Museum of Art at a Christie&#x27;s auction in acquiring a rare English cittern dating from the late 16th century, &quot;This instrument is extremely rare, probably the only English cittern from the Renaissance known to survive,&quot; museum director André Larson said. &quot;We already have an Italian cittern from the same period, but it&#x27;s one of two or three that have survived.&quot;

<text>Alexander Ewing (25 March 1814 – 22 May 1873) was a Scottish bishop.

He was born of an old Highland family in Aberdeen, Scotland. In October 1838, he was admitted to deacon&#x27;s orders, and after his return from Italy he took charge of the episcopal congregation at Forres, and was ordained a presbyter in the autumn of 1841. In 1847, he was consecrated bishop of the newly united Diocese of Argyll and The Isles, the duties of which position he discharged till his death. In 1851, he received the degree of D.C.L. from the University of Oxford.

Though hampered by poor health, he worked cheerfully, and his personal charm and Catholic sympathies gradually won him a prominent position. In theological discussion he was tolerant, and attached little importance to ecclesiastical authority and organization. His own theological position had close affinity with that of Thomas Erskine of Linlathen and Frederick Denison Maurice; but his opinions were independent. The trend of his teaching is only to be gathered from fragmentary publications—letters to the newspapers, pamphlets, special sermons, essays contributed to the series of &quot;Present Day Papers&quot;, of which he was the editor, and a volume of sermons entitled &quot;Revelation considered as Light&quot;.

Besides his strictly theological writings, Ewing was the author of the &quot;Cathedral or Abbey Church of Iona&quot; (1865), the first part of which contains drawings and descriptive letterpress of the ruins, and the second a history of the early Celtic church and the mission of St Columba.

Ewing&#x27;s daughter Margaret Nina married Alexander Crum printer and MP in 1863.

<text>The Tillamook Burn was a series of forest fires in the Northern Oregon Coast Range of Oregon in the United States that destroyed a total area of of old growth timber in what is now known as the Tillamook State Forest. There were four wildfires in this series, which spanned the years of 1933–1951. By association, the name Tillamook Burn also refers to the location of these fires. This event is an important part of Oregon&#x27;s history.


==Fire history==

===First fire (1933)===
The first fire started in a ravine at the headwaters of Gales Creek on August 14, 1933. The exact cause of the first fire is unknown; however, the common narrative states that as logging crews were wrapping up operations early due to fire hazard restrictions, a steel cable dragging a fallen Douglas fir rubbed against the dry bark of a wind-fallen snag. The snag burst into flame, and the wildfire that grew out of this burned before it was extinguished by seasonal rains on September 5. An oppressive, acrid smoke filled the neighboring valleys; ashes, and cinders, and the charred needles of trees fell in the streets of Tillamook; and debris from the fire reached ships at sea. A Civilian Conservation Corps member was the only known human casualty of fighting the fire. The loss in processed lumber was estimated to have been $442.4 million in contemporary (1933) dollars—a serious loss not only to the timber industry at the time, but also to a nation struggling with the Great Depression. A massive salvage operation was immediately begun to harvest usable portions of the burned wilderness.

The speed with which a forest fire can spread in heavy fuels under the most hazardous conditions is well illustrated by this fire. From August 14 at 1 p.m. until the early morning of August 24 the fire had burned about and it appeared that it might be brought under control soon. Thus, for over 10 days it had burned at an average rate of about a day. On August 24, the humidity dropped rapidly to 26 percent and hot gale-force winds from the east sprang up. During the next 20 hours of August 24 and 25 the fire burned over an additional , or at a rate of per hour along a front. The fire was stopped only by the fact that the wind ceased and a thick, wet blanket of fog drifted in from the ocean.

===Second fire (1939)===
The second fire was started in 1939, allegedly by another logging operation. It burned before being extinguished, and was contained within the bounds of the earlier fire.

===Third fire (1945)===
A third fire started on the morning of July 9, 1945, near the Salmonberry River, and was joined two days later by a second blaze on the Wilson River, started by a discarded cigarette. This fire burned before it was put out. The cause of the blaze on the Salmonberry River was mysterious, and many believed it had been set by an incendiary balloon launched by the Japanese (due to the fire occurring in the waning days of World War II), which had been carried to Oregon by the jet stream.

The third fire was perhaps the best known, after the initial wildfire, because it affected much of the forested mountains along the popular highways between Portland and the recreational destinations of the ocean beaches. This devastation remained visible to any traveler through the area as late as the mid-1970s.

===Fourth fire (1951)===
The last fire started in 1951, and burned only . It was also confined within the burned-over area.

== Salvage operations ==
Immediately after the first fire, new logging camps formed and existing ones expanded operations. At the time, access to the forest was limited and the railroad lines did not yet extend into the inner reaches of the forest.

The town of Timber expanded during the time and became a prominent logging town along with the smaller town of Cochran to the west. Some of the logging companies near Glenwood joined their operations to form the Consolidated Timber Company. The lumber from these operations played an important part in providing wood resources to the United States during World War II.

Throughout the subsequent years, miles of roads and railroad lines and were built through the forest to the various logging camps providing enhanced access. This made it easier for forestry restoration, maintenance, and fire prevention operations allowing them eventually to get a handle on the continued series of burns, however it had the secondary effect of creating new issues with erosion among a terrain known for landslides.

==Restoration==

The repeated fires led some to think that large wildfires in the area were inevitable and that the land was now too damaged from the intense heat to ever again sustain forests. But determined efforts by Oregonians—private citizens, government officials, land owners and many others—resulted in efforts to restore The Burn, beginning with hearings during World War II under Judge H. D. Kerkman of Washington County and eventually resulting in a decades-long reforestation program. 
Much of the lands of the Tillamook burn had come to be owned by the counties of Tillamook, Yamhill, and Washington through foreclosures on unpaid property taxes; at the time of the forest fires, most of the land was owned by timber companies, which also paid the cost of fighting the fires. A measure was submitted by the Legislative Assembly to the voters to float a bond to finance reforestation, which narrowly passed in 1948.

In a book published that same year, Stewart Holbrook wrote about the Tillamook Burn in &quot;Northwest Corner: Oregon and Washington&quot;:

[Reforestation] can never compensate for that tragedy we call the Tillamook Burn, as somber a sight as to be viewed this side of the Styx. There they stand, millions of ghostly firs, now stark against the sky, which were green as the sea and twice as handsome, until an August day of 1933, when a tiny spark blew into a hurricane of fire that removed all life from of the finest timber even seen. It was timber, too, that had been 400 years in the making. It was wiped out in a few seething hours which Oregon will have reason to remember well past the year 2000. To this day the forest stands powerless against the threat of wildfires.

Reforestation was performed simultaneously with research by the forest industry into the best methods of growing and planting the young trees (including how to protect them from the ravages of deer, beavers, mice and other wildlife). Young people from northwest Oregon helped with the hand-planting of seedlings. Between 1949 and 1972, they planted about a million seedlings, a massive number but still only about 1 percent of the total of 72 million seedlings replanted by all means. Everything from state prisoners to newly designed helicopters played a part in the reseeding program over the years. Eventually the forest began to return and in 1973, Oregon Governor Tom McCall dedicated the Tillamook Burn as the Tillamook State Forest.

At the time the reforestation of the Tillamook Burn began, some assumed that the forest land would, when the trees were mature, be harvested for lumber. Current environmental beliefs have questioned this assumption, and both the proportions and specific parts of this land that will be logged or conserved for wildlife are in dispute.

==In popular culture==

Poet and author Albert Drake titled a 1970s book of poems and essays, &quot;Tillamook Burn&quot;, from his experiences growing up in Oregon.

Folk singer Sufjan Stevens references the Tillamook Burn in his song &quot;Fourth of July&quot; from his album &quot;Carrie &amp; Lowell&quot;.

Martin Milner mentioned the Tillamook Burn in the 1960 &quot;Route 66&quot; episode “Legacy for Lucia.”

<doc id="266699" wikidata="Q832312" url="?curid=266699" title="FileMaker">
<text>FileMaker is a cross-platform relational database application developed by Claris International, a subsidiary of Apple Inc. It integrates a database engine with a graphical user interface (GUI) and security features, allowing users to visually modify a database. Versions for desktops, servers, iOS, and web-delivery have been released.

The desktop app is based on a DOS application originally named &quot;FileMaker&quot;, which was then developed primarily for the Apple Macintosh and released in April 1985. It was rebranded as &quot;FileMaker Pro&quot; in 1990. Since 1992 it has been available for Microsoft Windows and for the classic Mac OS and macOS, and has cross-platform capabilities.

&quot;FileMaker Go&quot;, the mobile app, was released for iOS devices in July 2010.

&quot;FileMaker Server&quot; allows centralized hosting of apps which can be used on both the desktop and mobile apps. A cloud variant, named &quot;FileMaker Cloud&quot;, is hosted by Claris.

== History ==
FileMaker began as an MS-DOS-based computer program named Nutshell, developed by Nashoba Systems of Concord, Massachusetts in the early 1980s. Nutshell was distributed by Leading Edge, an electronics marketing company that had recently started selling IBM PC-compatible computers.

With the introduction of the Macintosh, Nashoba combined the basic data engine with a new forms-based graphical user interface (GUI). Leading Edge was not interested in newer versions, preferring to remain a DOS-only vendor, and kept the Nutshell name. Nashoba found another distributor, Forethought Inc., and introduced the program on the Macintosh platform as FileMaker in April 1985. When Apple introduced the Macintosh Plus in 1986, the next version of FileMaker was named FileMaker Plus to reflect the new model&#x27;s name.

Leading Edge published Nutshell 2.0 until September 1986, after which Nashoba marketed the software itself. In mid-1987 Forethought was purchased by Microsoft for the former&#x27;s PowerPoint software. Microsoft expected to continue distributing FileMaker and deprioritize the competing Microsoft File, but Nashoba decided to self-publish the next version, FileMaker 4.

=== Purchase by Claris ===
Shortly after FileMaker 4&#x27;s release, Apple Computer formed Claris, a wholly owned subsidiary, to market software. Claris purchased Nashoba to round out its software suite. By that point, Leading Edge and Nutshell had faded from the marketplace because of competition from other DOS- and later Windows-based database products. FileMaker continued to succeed on the Macintosh platform.

Claris changed the product&#x27;s name to FileMaker II to conform to its naming scheme for other products, such as MacWrite II, but the product changed little from the last Nashoba version, with several minor versions following.

In 1990, the product was released as FileMaker Pro 1.0, and in September 1992, Claris released a cross-platform version for both the Mac and Windows. Except for a few platform-specific functions, the program&#x27;s features and user interface remained the same.

By 1995, other than ClarisWorks, FileMaker Pro was the only well-performing product in Claris&#x27;s lineup. In 1998, Apple moved development of some of the other Claris products in-house, dropped most of the rest, and changed Claris&#x27;s name to FileMaker Inc., followed by a concentrated development of FileMaker alone.

In 2020, FileMaker International Inc. changed its name (back) to Claris International Inc. and announced the Claris Connect workflow software.

=== Later updates ===
Version 4.0, introduced in 1997, added a plug-in architecture much like that of Adobe Photoshop, which enabled third-party developers to add features to FileMaker. A bundled plug-in, the Web Companion, allowed the database to act as a web server. Other plug-ins added features to the interface and enabled FileMaker to serve as an FTP client, perform external file operations, and send messages to remote FileMaker files over the Internet or an intranet.

Version 5 introduced a new file format, which came with the file extension .

Version 7, released in 2004, introduced a new file format with the extension , supporting file sizes up to 8 terabytes (an increase from the 2 gigabytes allowed in previous versions). Individual fields could hold up to 4 gigabytes of binary data (container fields) or 2 gigabytes of 2-byte Unicode text per record (up from 64 kilobytes in previous versions). FileMaker&#x27;s relational model was also expanded, offering multiple tables per file and a graphical relationship editor that displayed and allowed manipulation of related tables in a manner that resembled the entity-relationship diagram format. Accompanying these important changes, FileMaker Inc. also introduced a developer certification program.

In 2005 FileMaker Inc. announced the FileMaker 8 product family, which offered developers an expanded feature set. These included a tabbed interface, script variables, tooltips, enhanced debugging, custom menus, and the ability to copy and paste entire tables and field definitions, scripts, and script steps within and between files. Version 8.5, released in 2006, added an integrated web viewer (with the ability to view such things as shipment tracking information from FedEx and Wikipedia entries) and named layout objects.

FileMaker 9, released on July 10, 2007, introduced a quick-start screen, conditional formatting, fluid layout auto-resizing, hyperlinked pointers into databases, and external SQL links. FileMaker 10 was released on January 5, 2009, before that year&#x27;s Macworld Conference &amp; Expo, and offered scripts that can be triggered by user actions and a redesigned user interface similar to that of Mac OS X Leopard (10.5) applications.

FileMaker 11, released on March 9, 2010, introduced charting, which was further streamlined in FileMaker 12, released April 4, 2012. That version also added themes, more database templates (so-called &#x27;starter solutions&#x27;) and simplified creation of iOS databases. FileMaker Go 11 (July 20, 2010) and FileMaker Go 12 for iPhone and iPad (April 4, 2012) allowed only the creation, modification, and deletion of records on these handheld devices, whereas design and schema changes had to be made within the full FileMaker Pro application. FileMaker Go 12 brought with it multitasking, improved media integration, export of data to multiple formats and enhanced container fields.

FileMaker 13, released after the launches of iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks (10.9), first shipped in December 2013. The client and server products were enhanced to support more mobile and web methods of data access. FileMaker Go 13, the parallel iPad–iPhone product, became a single client for both devices, and the Server Admin tool now ran in HTML5, no longer requiring a Java app.

The FileMaker 14 platform released on May 15, 2015. It included FileMaker Pro 14, FileMaker Pro 14 Advanced, FileMaker Server 14 and FileMaker Go 14. This was followed by version 15 in May 2016 and version 16 in May 2017; both including equivalent Pro, Pro Advanced, Server and Go versions.

In late 2016, FileMaker began annually publicizing a software roadmap of incoming features already being worked on, as well as identifying features they are moving away from or may deprecate in the near future.

FileMaker Inc. had always had a hard time describing what FileMaker software was, because it covered a plethora of ground unrelated to databases; user interface, security, rapid application development tools, etc. At their annual developers conference in August 2018, FileMaker Inc. initiated a new marketing program called &quot;Workplace Innovation Platform&quot; to address the problem of its self-described software category.

=== FileMaker Cloud ===
On September 27, 2016, FileMaker Cloud was introduced, including a Linux server (CentOS), which was offered exclusively through the Amazon Marketplace. In November 2019, FileMaker Cloud was reintroduced as a software as a service product offered directly from Claris for FileMaker Pro 18.0.3, using the FileMaker Server Cloud 2.18 service on Amazon servers. Despite this, it was managed by Claris instead of through the Amazon Marketplace, and made use of the new FileMaker ID authentication.

=== Linux and Docker ===
In October 2020, Claris released a Linux version of FileMaker Server, first on CentOS (19.1) then on Ubuntu (19.2).

=== Version history ===

FileMaker files are compatible between Mac and Windows. File type extensions are:
* since FileMaker Pro 2.0
* since FileMaker Pro 3.0
* since FileMaker Pro 5.0 (including 5, 5.5, 6.0)
* since FileMaker Pro 7.0 (including 7, 8, 8.5, 9, 10, 11 and FileMaker Go 1.0)
* since FileMaker Pro 12 (including 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, FileMaker 2023, and FileMaker 2024)

Self-running applications (&quot;runtime&quot;, &quot;kiosk mode&quot;) are platform-specific only.

==Internationalization and localization==
FileMaker is available in worldwide English, Simplified Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish.

There are also specific versions of FileMaker for users of Central European, Indian and Middle Eastern languages. These versions offer spellchecking, data entry, sorting and printing options for languages of the respective region. They also contain localized templates and localized instant web publishing.

The Central European version FileMaker includes English, Russian, Polish, Czech and Turkish interfaces. There are customized templates for Russian, Polish, Czech, Turkish. In addition Russian, Greek, Estonian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Serbian, Bulgarian and Hungarian are supported to varying degrees.

The version intended for Southeast Asian languages has only an English user interface, but supports Indic-language data entry, sorting and indexing in Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, Panjabi, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam.

Similarly, the Middle Eastern version has only English and French user interfaces, but with its option to change the text direction to right-to-left, it does support Arabic and Hebrew data entry.

== Scripting ==

FileMaker Pro and FileMaker Pro Advanced include scripting capabilities and many built-in functions for automation of common tasks and complex calculations. Numerous steps are available for navigation, conditional execution of script steps, editing records, and other utilities. FileMaker Pro Advanced provides a script debugger which allows the developer to set break points, monitor data values and step through script lines.

FileMaker 13 introduced a script that more deeply queries container field document metadata.

===Dynamic Markup Language===
The FileMaker Dynamic Markup Language or FDML was a markup language used in the earlier versions of FileMaker introduced in 1998. FDML is also often referred to as &quot;Claris Dynamic Markup Language&quot; or &quot;CDML&quot;, named after its former company Claris. FDML was an extension of HTML that used special tags, such as codice_1 to display FileMaker data on Web pages. FileMaker officially dropped support for FDML in 2004.

== SQL and ODBC support ==
Since version 9, FileMaker has had the ability to connect to a number of SQL databases without resorting to using SQL, including MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. This requires installation of the SQL database ODBC driver (in many cases a third-party license per client driver) to connect to a SQL database. Through Extended SQL Services (ESS), SQL databases can be used as data sources in FileMaker&#x27;s relationship graph, thus allowing the developer to create new layouts based on the SQL database; create, edit, and delete SQL records via FileMaker layouts and functions; and reference SQL fields in FileMaker calculations and script steps. It is a cross-platform relational database application.

Versions from FileMaker Pro 5.5 onwards also have an ODBC interface.

FileMaker 12 introduced a new function, ExecuteSQL, which allows the user to perform an SQL query against the FileMaker database to retrieve data, but does not allow data modification or deletion, or schema changes.

FileMaker allows non-numeric characters to be stored in its &quot;numeric&quot; field type unless the field is specifically marked as strictly &quot;numeric&quot;.

Through a third party, Actual Technologies, FileMaker 15 and forward, also, support ODBC connectivity to IBM I 7.3 (AS/400), IBM Db2 11.1, and PostgreSQL 9.6.12. Using the Actual Adapter, these ODBC connections can also make ESS connections and be used as sources in the Relationship Graph.

== Integration ==

FileMaker 16 provides integrations via cURL, JSON, REST-based FileMaker Data API support. Tableau Web Data Connector is offered to visualize FileMaker data. The REST-based API license is a free trial that expired September 27, 2018. FileMaker 17 offers a permanent REST-based Data API. Standard licensing include 2 GB of outbound data per user per month. Container data does not count towards this limit, and inbound Data API data transfer is unlimited. FileMaker 19 for Linux and FileMaker Cloud provide a OData gateway, allowing JSON and XML output (Atom).

== In popular culture ==
In Julio Torres&#x27;s 2023 film &quot;Problemista&quot;, a major story element is the insistence by the character Elizabeth (Tilda Swinton) that her husband&#x27;s art be catalogued using FileMaker Pro, &quot;the Cadillac of archival software,&quot; and her refusal to consider alternatives like Google Sheets. The character Alejandro (Torres) falsely claims familiarity with FileMaker Pro with the hope that Elizabeth will sponsor his work visa.

<doc id="266700" wikidata="Q5601557" url="?curid=266700" title="John McLeod Campbell">
<text>John McLeod Campbell (4 May 1800 – 27 February 1872) was a Scottish minister and Reformed theologian. In the opinion of one German church historian, contemporaneous with Campbell, his theology was a highpoint of British theology during the nineteenth century. James B. Torrance ranked him highly on the doctrine of the atonement, placing Campbell alongside Athanasius of Alexandria and Anselm of Canterbury. Campbell took his cue from his close reading of the early Church Fathers, the historic Reformed confessions and catechisms, John Calvin, Martin Luther&#x27;s commentary on Galatians, and Jonathan Edwards&#x27; works.

==Early life==
Campbell was born on 4 May 1800 in Argyllshire, Scotland, the oldest child of the Rev. Donald Campbell. His mother died when Campbell was only 6, in 1806. Educated chiefly at home by his father, Campbell was already a good Latin scholar when he went to the University of Glasgow in 1811. Finishing his course in 1817, he became a student at the Divinity Hall, where he gained some reputation as a Hebraist.

After further training at the University of Edinburgh Campbell was licensed as a preacher by the presbytery of Lorne in 1821. In 1825 he was appointed to the parish of Row (now Rhu) on the Gareloch and the Clyde coast. There drunkenness was frequent, fights common, and smuggling ordinary; religion was conceived only as offering safety from the anger of God and so prayers and worship rang hollow and were often hypocritical. There was little joy in their Christianity.

Campbell preached universal atonement; and the presbytery in 1829 reviewed the orthodoxy of his preaching and teaching. At issue was the theology of Campbell in his sermons and its relationship and uniformity with the Westminster Standards which all Scottish ministers agreed to preach and teach at their ordination. A first petition was withdrawn; but a subsequent appeal in March 1830 led to a presbyterial visitation, and an accusation of heresy. Campbell clearly disagreed with the Westminster Confession of Faith&#x27;s view of a limited atonement, and he was removed from the ministry. The General Assembly, by which the charge was ultimately considered, found Campbell guilty of teaching heretical doctrines and deprived him of his living. Several issues came into play, not least that Campbell did not support either of the theological parties in the Assembly, the Moderates or the Evangelicals. Declining an invitation to join Edward Irving in the Catholic Apostolic Church, he worked for two years as an evangelist in the Scottish Highlands.

==In Glasgow==
Returning to Glasgow in 1833, Campbell was minister for sixteen years in a large chapel specially built for him by close friends. In 1859 his health gave way, and he advised his congregation to join the Barony church, where Norman Macleod was pastor.

==Later years==
In 1868 he received the degree of D.D. from Glasgow University for his theological work and writing. He and his friends took it to be a reaching out on the part of the Scottish church towards him so long after his deposition from the ministry. It was clear that his book on the atonement was significant and required some response. In 1870 he moved to Rosneath, and there began his &quot;Reminiscences and Reflections&quot;, an unfinished work published after his death by his son.

Campbell had a close circle of friends, which included Thomas Erskine, Norman McLeod, Alexander Ewing, Frederick Maurice and C. J. Vaughan. In 1871 a testimonial, dinner and address were presented to him by representatives of most of the religious bodies in Scotland. He died in early 1872 from prostate cancer. He was buried in Rosneath churchyard.

==Works==
Jonathan Edward&#x27;s question regarding the atonement, one of the prompts for Campbell&#x27;s work, was: &quot;Could God be satisfied by Christ&#x27;s earnest and honest repentance on behalf of humanity, or was his death necessary for satisfaction, forgiveness, and atonement to occur?&quot; Asked in another way, did Christ have to die to effect atonement, or was there another way for atonement to take place? Campbell also was pastorally sensitive to the attitude of his parishioners in living as Christians. He discovered that their Christianity was essentially joyless and depressing.

Campbell&#x27;s influence may be seen particularly in the work of Hugh Ross Mackintosh, Donald Baillie, and most notably in Thomas F. Torrance and James B. Torrance. Later Scottish theology affirmed Campbell&#x27;s influence in its departure from the strict reading of Westminster&#x27;s Standards. Campbell, through the influence of the Torrance brothers, has begun to be appreciated as a pastoral theologian.

In 1856 Campbell published &quot;The Nature of the Atonement&quot;, which profoundly influenced Scottish theology. Campbell&#x27;s theological aim was to view the Atonement in the light of the Incarnation. In the Atonement, one may not separate the birth, person, work, and death of Jesus Christ. As one looks more closely at Christ, one may discover that the divine mind in Christ is the mind of perfect obedient sonship towards God and perfect brotherhood towards men. Jesus Christ in his person fulfills the law to love God wholeheartedly and to love neighbor selflessly. By the light of this divine fact of the Incarnation, Christ&#x27;s life as atonement, vicariously lived in humanity&#x27;s place, is seen to develop itself naturally and necessarily as a perfect and complete reconciliation; the penal element in the sufferings of Christ is but one aspect or facet of the atonement.

There is some disagreement among scholars as to whether Campbell is rightly accused of denying the penal substitutionary theory of the atonement with his alternate view. Some would argue that he believed that rather than bearing the sin of humanity, Christ confessed humanity&#x27;s sin on their behalf. A closer reading of his magnum opus belies this inaccurate view. His vicarious confession is just one part of his mediatorial, vicarious and representative work (as part of his person). Is Christ&#x27;s death alone sufficient? Or does the nature of the atonement require an additional depth to his death with the addition of his confession of sin on humanity&#x27;s behalf and his rightful recognition of God&#x27;s just punishment? McLeod Campbell was clear on Christ&#x27;s substitutionary death, but developed his theory to add to what he perceived to be a too frequent weakness on the part of previous theories. How participatory does Christ&#x27;s work have to be in order for it to be effective? His reading of Phineas&#x27;s zeal in Numbers 25 as making atonement is most instructive in this regard. Some critics have argued that Campbell&#x27;s position was not self-consistent in the place assigned to the penal and expiatory element in the sufferings of Christ, nor adequate in its recognition of the principle that the obedience of Christ perfectly affirms all righteousness and so satisfies the holiness of God, thus effecting a peace and reconciliation between God and humanity—a true atonement. Others would vociferously disagree. Campbell sought, through his work, to change the dominant paradigm of atonement theory. There are those who suggest he succeeded; while others who argue he did not. He sought, with his atonement theory, to move from a purely legal framework (based as it is in the Latin West) to a filial and familial one (more in keeping with the Orthodox East). This change in language and the concepts behind it is partly to blame for the variety of views regarding whether he ultimately succeeded or failed.

In 1862 Campbell published &quot;Thoughts on Revelation&quot; and a few years later (1869) he published a revised version of his 1851 book: &quot;Christ the Bread of Life.&quot;

==Family==
Campbell married Mary Campbell, daughter of John Campbell of Ardnahua, Kilninver. Their marriage was looked upon unfavorably by his family because of Mary&#x27;s lower social standing. McLeod Campbell, however, was deeply in love with her and did not let the social inequality stand in the way of their union. As a result, it was years before his family resumed communication and correspondence with him. The union produced four sons, including James Macnabb Campbell, and two daughters; his daughter Jean married William Graham Crum, son of Walter Crum, and was the mother of the Anglican priest and hymnwriter John Macleod Campbell Crum.

<text>In the civil service of the United Kingdom, His Majesty&#x27;s Exchequer, or just the Exchequer, is the accounting process of central government and the government&#x27;s &quot;current account&quot; (i.e., money held from taxation and other government revenues) in the Consolidated Fund. The term is used in various financial documents, including the latest departmental and agency annual accounts.

Historically, it was the name of a British government department responsible for the collection and the management of taxes and revenues, making payments on behalf of the sovereign, and auditing official accounts. It also developed a judicial role along with its accountancy responsibilities and tried legal cases relating to revenue.

Similar offices were later created in Normandy around 1180, in Scotland around 1200 and in Ireland in 1210.

==Etymology==
The Exchequer was named after a table used to perform calculations for taxes and goods in the medieval period. According to the &quot;Dialogus de Scaccario&quot; (&#x27;Dialogue concerning the Exchequer&#x27;), an early medieval work describing the practice of the Exchequer, the table was large, 10 feet by 5 feet with a raised edge or &quot;lip&quot; on all sides of about the height of four fingers to ensure that nothing fell off it, upon which counters were placed representing various values. The name Exchequer referred to the resemblance of the table to a chess board (French: &quot;échiquier&quot;) as it was covered by a black cloth bearing green stripes of about the breadth of a human hand in a chequer-pattern. The spaces represented pounds, shillings and pence.

The term &quot;Exchequer&quot; then came to refer to the twice-yearly meetings held at Easter and Michaelmas, at which government financial business was transacted and an audit held of sheriffs&#x27; returns.

==Exchequer of Normandy==
The operation of an exchequer in Normandy is documented as early as 1180. This exchequer had broader jurisdiction than the English exchequer, dealing in both fiscal and administrative matters. The &quot;Dialogue concerning the Exchequer&quot; presents it as a general belief that the Norman kings established the Exchequer in England on the loose model of the Norman exchequer, while noting with some doubt an alternative view that the Exchequer existed in Anglo-Saxon times. The specific chronology of the two exchequers&#x27; foundings remains unknown.

== Exchequer in England and Wales ==
It is unknown exactly when the Exchequer was established, but the earliest mention appears in a royal writ of 1110 during the reign of King Henry I. The oldest surviving Pipe Roll is that of 1130 (already in mature form, indicating that such records existed for some time beforehand, though they do not survive). Pipe Rolls form a mostly continuous record of royal revenues and taxation; however, not all revenue went into the Exchequer, and some taxes and levies were never recorded in the Pipe Rolls.

Under Henry I, a procedure adopted for the audit involved the treasurer drawing up a summons to be sent to each sheriff, who was required to answer with an account of the income in his shire both from royal demesne lands and from the county &quot;farm&quot; (a form of local taxation). The chancellor of the Exchequer then questioned him concerning debts owed by private individuals.

By 1176, the 23rd year of the reign of Henry II which is the date of the &quot;Dialogue concerning the Exchequer&quot;, the Exchequer was split into two components: the purely administrative &quot;Exchequer of Receipt&quot;, which collected revenue, and the &quot;Exchequer of Pleas&quot;, a law court concerned with the King&#x27;s revenue. Appeals were to the Court of Exchequer Chamber. Following the proclamation of Magna Carta, legislation was enacted whereby the Exchequer would maintain the realm&#x27;s prototypes for the yard and pound. These nominal standards were, however, only infrequently enforced on the localities around the kingdom.

From the late 1190s to the expulsion of the Jews in 1290, there was a separate division for taxation of Jews and the law-cases arising between Jews and Christians, called Exchequer of the Jews (Latin: &quot;Scaccarium Judaeorum&quot;).

Through most of the 1600s, goldsmiths would deposit their reserve of treasure with the Exchequer, sanctioned by the government. Charles II &quot;shut up&quot; the Exchequer in 1672, forbidding payments from it, in what Walter Bagehot described as &quot;one of those monstrous frauds... this monstrous robbery&quot;. This ruined the goldsmiths and the credit of the Stuart government, which would never recover it. In 1694, the credit of William III&#x27;s government was so bad in London that it could not borrow, which led to the foundation of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England.

The records of the Exchequer were kept in the Pell Office, adjacent to Westminster Hall, until the 19th century. The office was named after the skins (then &quot;pells&quot; or pelts) from which the rolls were made.

=== Officers ===
=== Reform and decline===
In the 19th century, a number of reforms reduced the role of the Exchequer, with some functions moved to other departments. The Exchequer became unnecessary as a revenue collecting department in 1834 with the reforms of Prime Minister William Pitt, who also served as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The government departments collecting revenue then paid it directly to the Bank of England, with all money previously paid to the Exchequer being credited to the Consolidated Fund.
In 1866, the Standards Department of the Board of Trade took over metrological responsibilities and audit functions were combined with those of the &quot;Commissioners for auditing the Public Accounts&quot; under the new post of Comptroller and Auditor General. The name continued as the &quot;Exchequer and Audit Department&quot; from 1866 until 1983 when the new National Audit Office was created.
In modern times, &quot;Exchequer&quot; has come to mean the Treasury and, colloquially, pecuniary possessions in general; as in &quot;the company&#x27;s exchequer is low&quot;.

== Exchequer in Scotland ==

The Scottish Exchequer dates to around 1200, with a similar role in auditing and royal revenues as in England. The Scottish Exchequer was slower to develop a separate judicial role; and it was not until 1584 that it became a court of law, separate from the king&#x27;s council. Even then, the judicial and the administrative roles were never completely separated as with the English Exchequer.

In 1707, the Exchequer Court (Scotland) Act 1707 (6 Ann. c. 53) reconstituted the Exchequer into a law court on the English model, with a lord chief baron and four barons. The court adopted English forms of procedure and had further powers added. This was done in Section 19 of the Act of Union 1707

From 1832, no new barons were appointed; their role was increasingly assumed by judges of the Court of Session. By the Exchequer Court (Scotland) Act 1856 (19 &amp; 20 Vict. c. 56), the Exchequer became a part of the Court of Session. A lord ordinary acts as a judge in Exchequer causes. The English forms of process ceased to be used in 1947.

==Exchequer of Ireland==

The Exchequer of Ireland developed in 1210 when King John of England reorganized the governance of his Lordship of Ireland and brought it more in line with English law. It consisted of the &quot;Superior Exchequer&quot;, a court of equity and revenue akin to the Exchequer of Pleas, and the &quot;Inferior Exchequer&quot;. The latter were the treasurers who handled all logistics from collecting the money (Teller or Cashier), logging it (Clerk of the Pells) and signing money orders accepting or paying money. It was managed by its own Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland and Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer.

The Court of Exchequer (Ireland) existed from about 1299 to 1877. It was abolished under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877 and was merged, along with the Court of King&#x27;s Bench (Ireland), the Court of Chancery (Ireland) and the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland), into the new High Court of Justice in Ireland (now replaced by the High Court).

The Central Fund, the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s equivalent of the UK&#x27;s Consolidated Fund, is colloquially called the Exchequer when distinguished as a component of government funding.

<doc id="266706" wikidata="Q213832" url="?curid=266706" title="Dudley">
<text>Dudley ( , ) is a market town in the West Midlands, England, southeast of Wolverhampton and northwest of Birmingham. Historically part of Worcestershire, the town is the administrative centre of the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. In the 2011 census, it had a population of 79,379. The wider Metropolitan Borough had a population of 312,900. In 2014, the borough council adopted a slogan describing Dudley as the capital of the Black Country, a title by which it had long been informally known.

Originally a market town, Dudley was one of the birthplaces of the Industrial Revolution and grew into an industrial centre in the 19th century with its iron, coal, and limestone industries before their decline and the relocation of its commercial centre to the nearby Merry Hill Shopping Centre in the 1980s. Tourist attractions include Dudley Zoo and Castle, the 12th century priory ruins, and the Black Country Living Museum.

==History==
===Early history===

Dudley has a history dating back to Anglo-Saxon times, its name deriving from the Old English &quot;Duddan Leah&quot;, meaning Dudda&#x27;s clearing, and one of its churches being named in honour of the Anglo-Saxon king and saint, Edmund.

Mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Dudelei&quot;, in the hundred of Clent in Worcestershire, the town was listed as being a medium-sized manor in the possession of Earl Edwin of Mercia prior to the Norman Conquest, with William Fitz-Ansculf as Lord of the Manor in 1086. Dudley Castle, constructed in 1070 by William&#x27;s father Ansculf de Picquigny after his acquisition of the town, served as the seat of the extensive Barony of Dudley, which possessed estates in eleven different counties across England.

Of historical significance, the town was attacked by King Stephen in 1138, after a failed siege of the castle following the baron&#x27;s decision to support Empress Matilda&#x27;s claim to the throne during The Anarchy.

The castle provided the centre from which the town and borough grew, with early coal and iron workings helping establish Dudley as a major market town during the Middle Ages, selling not only agricultural produce, but also iron goods at a national level. Working iron and mining for coal was in practice as early as the 13th century. The first mention of Dudley&#x27;s status as a borough dates from the mid-13th century, when Roger de Somery, then Baron of Dudley, approved of the establishment of a market in nearby Wolverhampton. An inquisition after his death further established the value and importance of the borough, with mentions of the town&#x27;s growing coal industry.

===Early modern and Industrial Revolution===
By the early 16th century the Dudley estate, now held by the Sutton family, had become severely in debt and was first mortgaged to distant relative John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, before being sold outright in 1535. Following Dudley&#x27;s execution in 1553, the estate returned to the Sutton family, during whose ownership the town was visited by Queen Elizabeth during a tour of England.

In 1605, conspirators of the Gunpowder Plot fled to Holbeche House in nearby Wall Heath, where they were defeated and captured by the forces of the Sheriff of Worcestershire.

During the English Civil War Dudley served as a Royalist stronghold, with the castle besieged twice by the Parliamentarians and later partly demolished on the orders of the Government after the Royalist surrender. It is also from around this time that the oldest excavated condoms, found in the remains of Dudley Castle, were believed to have originated.

Dudley had become an incredibly impoverished place during the 16th and 17th centuries, but the advent of the Industrial Revolution began to reverse this trend. In the early 17th century, Dud Dudley, an illegitimate son of Edward Sutton, 5th Baron Dudley and Elizabeth Tomlinson, devised a method of smelting Iron ore using coke at his father&#x27;s works in Cradley and Pensnett Chase, though his trade was unsuccessful due to circumstances of the time. Abraham Darby was descended from Dud Dudley&#x27;s sister, Jane, and was the first person to produce iron commercially using coke instead of charcoal at his works in Coalbrookdale, Shropshire in 1709. Abraham Darby was born near Wrens Nest Hill near the town of Dudley and it is claimed that he may have known about Dud Dudley&#x27;s earlier work.

Dud Dudley&#x27;s discovery, together with improvements to the local road network and the construction of the Dudley Canal, made Dudley into an important industrial and commercial centre. The first Newcomen steam engine, used to pump water from the mines of the Lord Dudley&#x27;s estates, was installed at the Conygree coal works a mile east of Dudley Castle in 1712, though this is challenged by Wolverhampton, which also claims to have been the location of the first working Newcomen engine.

Dudley&#x27;s population grew dramatically during the 18th and 19th centuries because of the increase in industry, with the main industries including coal and limestone mining. Other industries included iron, steel, engineering, metallurgy, glass cutting, textiles and leatherworking.

During this time living conditions remained very poor, with Dudley being named &quot;the most unhealthy place in the country&quot; in 1851. Health Inspector William Lee stated that &quot;In no other part of England and Wales is the work of human extermination effected in so short a time as ... in Dudley&quot;. The report led to the installation of clean water supplies and sewage systems. Later the extensive development of council housing during the early 20th century relocated the occupants of local slum housing.

Following the Reform Act 1832, Dudley returned one Member of Parliament (MP), a privilege first enacted in the Parliament of 1295. The town was re-incorporated as a Municipal Borough in 1865, later becoming a County Borough in 1889.

===Modern day===

Dudley was developed substantially in the early 20th century, with the construction of many entertainment venues including a theatre and cinemas, with two indoor shopping centres being added later in the century. The grounds of Dudley Castle were converted into a zoo in 1937 by the Earl of Dudley, with buildings designed by architect Berthold Lubetkin. A reported 250,000 people attempted to visit the site upon the first day of opening.

In World War II, Dudley was bombed on several occasions. On 19 November 1940 a Luftwaffe bomb demolished a public house in the town centre and damaged several nearby buildings including St Thomas&#x27;s Church and the new Co-Operative department store, but there were no fatalities. However, on the same night a landmine was dropped in the Oakham area of the town and demolished a section of council houses in City Road, resulting in the deaths of 10 people and injuring many others. On 12 August 1941, four people were killed when another landmine was dropped in nearby Birch Crescent. These were the only fatal air raids on Dudley.

Following local government reforms in 1966, Dudley was expanded to include the majority of the former urban districts of Brierley Hill and Sedgley, along with parts of Coseley, Amblecote and Rowley Regis; an area in the eastern section of the town was also transferred into the new borough of Warley. Most of this land had been held by the Lords of Dudley, and contained within the Dudley registration district and parliamentary borough. In 1974, further reorganization led to the creation of the present-day metropolitan borough, which included the nearby towns of Stourbridge and Halesowen.

Dudley was struck by an F1/T2 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day. The tornado touched down in Woodsetton, subsequently passing through Dudley town centre, causing moderate damage, before dissipating.

The declining industry in Dudley has given rise to high unemployment, resulting in the closure of many businesses in the town. The development of the Merry Hill Shopping Centre between 1985 and 1990 also saw the loss of most of the town centre&#x27;s leading name stores, which relocated to take advantage of the tax incentives offered by Merry Hill&#x27;s status as an Enterprise Zone. The 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession resulted in even more of the retail units in the town centre becoming vacant, with the Woolworths store on Market Place closing in December 2008 when the company went bankrupt, and Beatties closing its store – the last department store in the town – in January 2010, after more than 40 years due to falling trade.

==Governance==

===Local government===

The town had been a manorial borough from the end of the 13th century, and from at least the 16th century until the passing of the Dudley Town Act 1791 (31 Geo. 3. c. 79), was governed by the Court Leet of the Lords of Dudley. From 1791, the Town Commissioners were the main local authority although the Court Leet continued to meet until 1866. In 1836 the Dudley Poor Law Union was formed, consisting of Dudley itself, and the parishes of Sedgley, Tipton, and Rowley Regis. In 1853 the Town Commissioners were superseded by the Board of Health, before the town was eventually incorporated into a municipal borough in 1865. It became a county borough in 1888 under the Local Government Act.

For many years the town (but not the castle, which was outside the boundary in Staffordshire) formed part of an exclave of the county of Worcestershire. Despite the more recent changes in county boundaries, the town and borough still remain part of the Anglican Diocese of Worcester.

Dudley Council House in Priory Road was financed by the then Earl of Dudley, and was officially opened by Duke of Kent in December 1935. Dudley Town Hall (an events venue) opened on St James&#x27;s Road in 1928; it stands next to council offices which were converted from the old Police Station in 1939, after the construction of a new building on nearby New Street.

Dudley is the administrative centre of the Dudley Metropolitan Borough, governed by Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council. The borough, which also includes the towns of Halesowen and Stourbridge, had a population of 312,925 as of the 2011 census.
In 2012 the Dudley Metropolitan Borough made an unsuccessful bid to receive city status, losing out to Chelmsford, Perth, and St. Asaph.

===National government===
Dudley presently has two parliamentary constituencies, Dudley North and Dudley South, which cover the town and its surrounding area. In October 2017, proposals to revise constituency boundaries were published that would reduce Dudley to just one constituency. The town itself would be divided between multiple constituencies, including ones predominantly based in neighbouring council areas such as Wolverhampton and Sandwell. The proposals were criticised by then MP for Dudley North, Ian Austin As of the 2019 general election, the current Members of Parliament (MPs) elected from these seats to the House of Commons are 
Marco Longhi

and Mike Wood,

both Conservatives.

==Landmarks==

The 13th-century ruins of Dudley Castle overlook the town; it is a Grade I listed structure. Dudley Zoo is built into the castle grounds, and houses a large collection of endangered species, and also the largest collection of Tecton buildings in the world. Under proposals by Dudley Zoo, in partnership with Dudley Council, St. Modwen, and Advantage West Midlands, the zoo is to be regenerated, which will see a former freightliner site redeveloped with a tropical dome, Asiatic forest, two aquatic facilities and walkthrough aviaries. It was expected to cost £38.7 million in 2007.

There are many canals in and around Dudley, the main one being the Dudley Canal – most of which passes beneath the town in the Dudley Tunnel and is accessible only by boat because there is no towpath. The open sections of canal are popular with walkers, cyclists, fishermen, and narrowboat users. Many of the canalside towpaths have been upgraded for cycling, and some sections are part of the National Cycle Network.
St James&#x27;s Church at Eve Hill had a church school from the mid-19th century, but this was closed during the 1970s and was used as a community centre for several years before being transferred to the Black Country Museum in 1989. The site of the school remained undeveloped until 2008, when work began on a new health centre.

There are 11 scheduled ancient monuments in Dudley and the surrounding district, and 260 listed buildings, including 6 Grade I listed and 19 Grade II* listed buildings.

==Culture==
===Entertainment===
The town was formerly home to a number of cinemas and theatres, including the Criterion, Gaumont, Odeon, and Plaza. The Dudley Hippodrome was one of the largest theatres in the West Midlands, built along with the adjacent Plaza Cinema just prior to the Second World War in 1938. The 1,600-seat Art Deco venue was constructed to replace the earlier Opera House, which had burned down in 1936. After its closure in 1964, the building was in use as a bingo hall until 2009, when it was purchased by Dudley Council with a view for demolition. After long public opposition the building was leased to campaigners in December 2016, with the intent to restore it to theatre use; however the lease was revoked by the council in February 2018, citing a lack of progress. It was demolished in 2023 despite a campaign to save it.

The Plaza Cinema remained open until October 1990. The building was then taken over by Laser Quest, until its closure and demolition in 1997. As of January 2017 the site remains undeveloped.

The Odeon Cinema was converted into a Kingdom Hall for Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in 1976. A present-day Odeon currently exists at the Merry Hill Shopping Centre.

Dudley is currently home to a multiplex Showcase Cinema and Tenpin bowling alley, located in the Castle Gate complex north-east of the town centre. The Town Hall also acts as an entertainment venue, hosting dances, theatrical performances, and concerts.

Until 2011, the JB&#x27;s nightclub was situated on Castle Hill, after relocating from an earlier site in King Street (behind Pathfinders clothes store) in the 1990s. Claimed to have been the longest-running live music venue in the UK, the club hosted early performances by acts such as U2, Dire Straits, and Judas Priest. It closed after going into administration and has since reopened as a banqueting centre.

===Museums and galleries===

The museums in Dudley celebrate the geological and industrial heritage of the town and the surrounding Black Country region, and its role in the Industrial Revolution. The Black Country Living Museum is an open-air living museum, which consists of reconstructed buildings from the surrounding area forming a living replica of an industrial village, with demonstrators portraying life in the region from that time. Work began in 2022 to recreate a typical Black Country town centre using original buildings such as the Woodside Library and replicas of other lost buildings such as the Elephant &amp; Castle pub which stood at the junction of Stafford Street and Cannock Road in Wolverhampton. The pub, whose lower section is clad in traditional Victorian glazed tiles, opened within the museum&#x27;s village in Autumn 2022.

The Dudley Museum and Art Gallery was formerly located in the town centre, having first opened in 1912, but was closed by Dudley Council in 2016 as part of cost-cutting measures, despite widespread public opposition. Some of the museum collections were later relocated to a permanent exhibit at the local archives centre on Tipton Road, adjacent to the Black Country Living Museum.

==Transport==
===Rail===

According to ONS, there are two railway stations in Dudley, both just over a mile from Dudley town centre, these are Dudley Port and Tipton. They are within the town of Dudley but outside the borough boundary as parts of Sandwell are considered within Dudley Town. The nearest station to the town within the Dudley borough is Coseley. All of these stations are on the same line, served by local services operated by West Midlands Trains. The nearest regular intercity services run from the Sandwell &amp; Dudley in Oldbury, which was rebuilt in 1984 to serve the two boroughs.

Dudley railway station located in the town centre was closed under the Beeching cuts in 1964. It opened in 1860 on the junction between the South Staffordshire and the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton lines, and in its heyday was a hub of services east to Birmingham (via a junction at Great Bridge), Walsall and Lichfield; north to Wolverhampton, Tipton and Coseley; and south-west to Stourbridge, as well as a line that served the small communities on the way to Old Hill and Halesowen. The site was later used as a Freightliner terminal by Freightliner, until an unpopular closure on 26 September 1989.

A proposal to re-open the segment of line between Dudley and Dudley Port was unveiled in December 2014, to allow for a light rail link from the town centre to the main line, but this plan was scrapped in May 2016 as Dudley Council favoured keeping the line available for the now confirmed West Midlands Metro extension to Brierley Hill, then later Stourbridge.

===Bus===

Dudley bus station is in the town centre and has many connections to surrounding towns, cities, and communities, including Birmingham, Halesowen, Smethwick, Stourbridge, Walsall, West Bromwich, and Wolverhampton, amongst others. The bus station also has coach services run by National Express, mostly to and from London or Wolverhampton. Other places served include holiday destination Blackpool, and London Heathrow and London Gatwick airports. There are also small bus stations located at Russells Hall Hospital and the Merry Hill Shopping Centre.

Dudley town centre has been served by a bus station at the junction of Birmingham Street and Fisher Street since 1952. The original bus station was cleared in 1984 and replaced by the current bus station, which became fully operational in 1987. The original bus station was on the slope at right angles to the current bus station. It was replaced by a &quot;temporary car park&quot; which remained in use until work began on the Midland Metro extension in 2020 which will also see the current bus station demolished. Work on a replacement bus station is set to start in January 2024 with buses using stops in nearby roads for around eighteen months.

Midland Red used to operate bus services in the town, mostly from its own bus depot, which opened in 1929. This depot was located on Birmingham Road and passed to West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive in 1973, along with operation of all bus services in Dudley. The depot was closed in 1993 and demolished a year later to make way for the Castle Gate roundabout, at the eastern end of the town&#x27;s new southern by-pass. The island was built in 1997 and the bypass opened on 15 October 1999.

===Road===
Dudley is served by main roads which give a direct route to neighbouring towns. The longest of these roads are the B4176 (which runs to Wombourne, Bridgnorth and Telford) and the A461 (which passes through Wednesbury and Walsall, finally reaching Lichfield).

The nearest motorway is the M5, with the closest junction situated in Oldbury, south-east of the town.

===Air===
The nearest international airport is Birmingham Airport, around to the east. The nearest local airport is Wolverhampton Airport, which is about to the west of the town.

===Tram===
Dudley was the terminus point of two tram routes which opened in the later part of the 19th century. The first route, linking the town with Tipton and Wednesbury, opened on 21 January 1884 operating steam trams, the route being electrified in 1907 before being closed in March 1930 and replaced by Midland Red buses along the route. The second route opened a year later, linking the town with Birmingham and heading through the centre of nearby Tividale village on the Dudley-Tipton border. This line was electrified in 1904 and remained open until 30 September 1939, when it too was replaced by Midland Red buses.

In 2021, a long line bringing 2 new lines of the West Midlands Metro, running from Wednesbury to Brierley Hill via Dudley, began construction to re-instate a tram service along the South Staffordshire Line, before running through the town centre and towards Merry Hill. Phase one is expected to begin operation in 2025, connecting Dudley to Edgbaston Village in Birmingham City Centre, and to Wolverhampton station

==Geography==
===Geology===

Dudley covers an area of the South Staffordshire Coalfield, which contributed heavily to its growth and industrialisation during the 18th century Industrial Revolution.

North-west of the town centre lies the Wren&#x27;s Nest Nature Reserve, the first British nature reserve in an urban area and a site of special scientific interest (SSSI), considered to be one of the most notable geological locations in the British Isles. A part of the Much Wenlock Limestone Formation, it was heavily mined for centuries because of its large limestone deposits, and is also the location of one of the largest fossil sites in England. The town lends its name to the &quot;Dudley locust&quot;, (also &#x27;Dudley Bug&#x27;), a trilobite with the scientific name &quot;Calymene blumenbachii&quot; that was found in these limestone pits in 1749 by Charles Lyttleton.

In the 1830s, Scottish geologist Sir Roderick Murchison visited the Wren&#x27;s Nest to collect fossils as part of his research. 65% of his palaeontological evidence featured in the 1839 publication &quot;The Silurian System&quot; was from Dudley.

===Localities===
==Demography==

The current figure for the population of Dudley is 79,379. This figure differs considerably from that given at the 2001 census (194,919), which led to it being considered one of the largest towns in Britain without city status. However, this change is not due to large population movements but to a redefinition of the town&#x27;s boundaries (for example, Kingswinford with a population of over 50,000, included as Dudley in the 2001 census, is now considered a separate town). In addition, the 2001 Urban Subdivision included Brierley Hill, which the local authority considers a separate town. It also included other local centres such as Sedgley and Gornal.

==Education==
===Primary education===
Dudley is served by a range of primary schools. Several of these are church schools. For example, Jesson&#x27;s Church of England Primary School, St Chads Roman Catholic School, St Edmund&#x27;s and St John&#x27;s Church of England Primary School and Netherton Church of England Primary School are all Church of England primary schools.

Other primary schools in the town include Dudley Wood Primary School, Priory Primary School, Kates Hill Primary School, Sledmere Primary School, Russells Hall Primary School, Milking Bank Primary School, Highgate Primary School, Northfield Road Primary School, Dudley Wood Primary School, Foxyards Primary School, Netherbrook Primary School (in Netherton), Blowers Green Primary School and Wrens Nest Primary School. Many of these schools are named after the housing estates they are located within.

Primary schools throughout the Dudley borough all provide education for pupils aged 5 to 11 years. Some schools also have nursery units for pupils aged 3 and 4 years. From 1972 to 1990, schoolchildren in Dudley, Sedgley, Coseley and Brierley Hill stayed at primary school until the age of 12. Halesowen ran a 5–13 first and middle school system from 1972 to 1982, while Stourbridge and Kingswinford have always had a traditional 5–11 infant and junior system.

===Secondary education===

There are several secondary schools in and around Dudley. The Dudley Academies Trust, created in association with Dudley College, runs four of these: Beacon Hill Academy in Sedgley, The Link Academy in Netherton, Pegasus Academy in Holly Hall, and St James Academy near the town centre.

Bishop Milner Catholic College is a Roman Catholic secondary school in the town. Opened in 1960, it became one of the first Roman Catholic secondary schools in the region and is the oldest existing secondary school – by name – in Dudley.

All of the town&#x27;s grammar schools were changed to comprehensives in 1975. Casualties of this change included Dudley&#x27;s girls and boys grammar schools, which merged with the nearby Park Secondary School to form The Dudley School (which in turn became Castle High upon a merger with The Blue Coat School in 1989, and now comprises the St James Academy). Several other grammar schools, such as the High Arcal School (now Beacon Hill Academy), survived merely with a change in status.

Dudley traditionally ran a system of 5–7 infant, 7–11 junior and 11+ secondary schools, but in September 1972 the system was altered to create 5–8 first, 8–12 middle and 12+ secondary schools; though this system was not introduced in the Kingswinford area. The traditional school system was restored in September 1990, since Stourbridge (which had become part of the borough in 1974) had retained the traditional system, and Halesowen (also part of the borough since 1974) had reverted in 1982. At this time all of the town&#x27;s remaining sixth forms were closed in favour of concentrating post-16 education in the borough&#x27;s further education colleges.

===Special schools===
There are several special schools within Dudley, to cater for students with special educational needs. The Old Park School serves pupils from the age of 3 to 19, and was originally located in the Russells Hall Estate, but relocated to new premises in Quarry Bank in 2011. The Rosewood School also caters for children within the age range. It was built on the Russells Hall Estate during the 1960s, but relocated to the former Highfields Primary School site in Coseley in March 2008.

The Woodsetton School near Sedgley caters to pupils from ages 4–11.

Sutton School, built in 1962 in Russells Hall, caters only for pupils from 11 to 16.

===Defunct schools===
As well as The Dudley School, Sir Gilbert Claughton School and The Blue Coat School, which merged to form Castle High School, other defunct schools in the town include Rosland Secondary School, which became part of The Blue Coat School in 1970, and Park Secondary School. The Mons Hill School also shut down as a result of falling pupil numbers; it had originally opened in 1965 to replace the Wolverhampton Street School.

Primary schools that no longer exist include St James&#x27; School (erected in 1842), St John&#x27;s Primary School and St Edmund&#x27;s Primary School, which merged to form St Edmund&#x27;s and St John&#x27;s Church of England Primary School in the 1970s. The St Edmund&#x27;s building still exists on the corner of Castle Hill and Birmingham Street, and is now used as a mosque.

Sycamore Green Primary School shut down in July 2006 as a result of falling pupil numbers. Staff and pupils were transferred to the nearby Wrens Nest Primary School, and the school buildings are now used as a Pupil Referral Unit for students studying at Key Stage 3.

===Further and Higher Education===

Originally established as a Mechanics&#x27; Institute in 1862, Dudley College of Technology provides further education for the town. Plans to establish a &#x27;learning quarter&#x27; saw several new campuses built in the town centre in 2012, replacing previous sites elsewhere in the borough.

Dudley Training College for Teachers was opened in 1909 on a site on Eve Hill. In 1965 it was renamed Dudley College of Education, a period when it trained over 600 students a year. It was taken over by Wolverhampton Polytechnic in 1977, which then became the University of Wolverhampton. The campus was closed in 2002 and the main college building was demolished, leaving the town and borough without higher education provision. A new Institute of Technology, offering higher education courses, was due to open in 2021 in the Castle Hill area.

==Public services==
===Libraries===

Dudley Library is situated on St. James&#x27;s Road, in the town centre. The present building, a Grade II listed Edwardian baroque, was designed by George H. Wenyon, and opened in 1909 to replace the older site in Priory Street. The statuary above the main entrance depicts &quot;philosophy, science and the arts&quot; and was put in place by H.H. Martyn &amp; Co. The town has had a public library since 1878. The library underwent a major expansion in 1966, and significant refurbishment in 2002 and 2012.

The library service also operates eight branch libraries and four self-service &#x27;Library Links&#x27;, along with four other main libraries situated throughout Dudley Borough, including Netherton Library, which moved buildings to the Savoy centre in 2012. A controversial re-structuring and modernisation of the service between 2006 and 2009 lead to the closure of several smaller borough libraries in favour of the &#x27;Library Links&#x27;.

===Medical===

Dudley is served by several National Health Service facilities. The main general hospital is Russells Hall, located to the south of the town. It was constructed in 1976, though financial difficulties prevented it from opening until 1983. A major expansion of the hospital was completed in 2005 when it incorporated all inpatient services from the other hospitals in the borough.

The Guest Hospital was initially created as a charity hospital by the Earl of Dudley in 1849 to accommodate blinded miners. It was taken over by local chainmaker Joseph Guest in 1871, and converted for general hospital use. It remained in use throughout the twentieth century, but was downgraded to an outpatient-only centre in the 2000s following the construction of a new block; the original hospital site was re-developed for private housing in 2018.

Bushey Fields Hospital provides psychiatric care for the area. It was developed adjacent to Russells Hall Hospital in the 1980s and early 1990s to replace facilities at Burton Road Hospital. Approximately one mile west of the town centre, Burton Road Hospital was built in the mid-19th century, initially as a workhouse, before becoming a hospital in 1859. It closed in December 1993, and was demolished the following year for re-development.
The town&#x27;s ambulance station was opened on land adjacent to Burton Road Hospital in 1986.

===Emergency services===
Law enforcement in Dudley is carried out by West Midlands Police, with the borough&#x27;s sole police station located in Brierley Hill. Closure of Dudley Police Station was announced in 2017 as part of cost-cutting measures, though a small number of officers are set to remain in the town centre from a shared base with the local council. The police station had originally opened in 1939 to replace a 19th-century structure on Priory Street, which now forms part of the civic centre.

In 2019 plans were put forward to build a new police station in the town centre, although disputes between Dudley Council and West Midlands Police have delayed the project.

Fire and rescue services are provided by the West Midlands Fire Service, with the fire station situated on Burton Road on land previously occupied by Burton Road Hospital. The former fire station site on Tower Street now forms part of a campus of Dudley College. West Midlands Ambulance Service provides emergency medical care, with the ambulance station also on Burton Road, near to the fire station.

There is also a Dudley Detachment of the Army Cadet Force, Air Cadet Squadron, and Sea Cadet unit based in Dudley. The Army Reserve Centre on Vicar Street houses both Army Cadets and Air Cadets.

==Religion==

Part of the Anglican Diocese of Worcester, Dudley has its own Archdeaconry and suffragan bishop. The town is served by numerous parish churches, including the Church of St. Edmund, Church of St. James, and Church of St. Thomas within the town centre. In the Kate&#x27;s Hill area of Dudley, one can find St John&#x27;s church, whose graveyard contains the burial place of William Perry a 19th-century Prizefighter, known as the &quot;Tipton Slasher&quot;.

The oldest church in the town is St. Edmund&#x27;s, dating back to Anglo-Saxon times, although the present building was not constructed until 1724, following its demolition during the English Civil War. St. Thomas&#x27; church dates from the 12th century, and was rebuilt in the 1815 after the original building was declared &#x27;unsafe&#x27;. Both sites are now Grade II* listed.

Dudley Priory was a Cluniac priory founded circa 1160 by the Lord of Dudley, Gervase de Paganel, and controlled several churches in the surrounding area. After its initial dissolution in 1395, it reopened as a denizen priory, and remained in use until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Today the ruins form part of the surrounding Priory Park.

The Revd Robert Jones, present Archdeacon of Worcester, inducted in November 2014, was previously Vicar of St. Francis Church in Dudley for eight years.

Roman Catholics in the town are served by a church dedicated to Our Blessed Lady and St Thomas of Canterbury situated in St Joseph Street near the bus station. The church, designed by architect Augustus Pugin, dates from 1842 and has been Grade II listed since 1949.

There are two Methodist Churches in Dudley: Central Church is at Cross Street near the town centre and there is another church at Dixon&#x27;s Green. Dudley Baptist Church is on Priory Road in the centre of town. There is also a thriving Salvation Army Church in Dudley on North Street.

Dudley also has places of worship for other religious groups and Christian denominations, including a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness Kingdom Hall, two Sikh gurdwaras, and a Hindu temple. The old St Edmund&#x27;s Church School, which closed in 1970 on a merger with St John&#x27;s Church School, was converted into a mosque for the town&#x27;s Islamic community, with an additional mosque also opening in the Queen&#x27;s Cross area of the town.

===Proposed mosque===
In 2003, plans were unveiled for the construction of a new mosque (which become known as the &quot;Super Mosque&quot; locally) in Hall Street, a site that had been leased by Dudley Council to the Dudley Muslim Association, in exchange for a site impacted by a proposed bypass. The mosque proposals were scrapped in May 2010, after a long dispute, in favour of an expansion to the existing Dudley Central Mosque in Castle Hill, an appeal was made by the Dudley Muslim Association against the High Court ruling, and failed in February 2014.

==Media==
Dudley is served by a number of local newspapers. The town has its own version of the &quot;Express &amp; Star&quot;, published daily Monday to Saturday. There are also &quot;Dudley News&quot;, which is published weekly, and (based at Dudley Archives and Local History Centre on Tipton Road in Dudley) the &quot;Black Country Bugle&quot;, which looks at the history of Dudley and the rest of the Black Country. Dudley was also served by the Dudley Evening Mail until its absorption into the Birmingham Evening Mail in late 1986. Televised local news is provided through Midlands Today and Central Tonight, which also serve the wider area of the West Midlands.

BBC Radio WM, Free Radio (formerly Beacon Radio), Heart West Midlands, Greatest Hits West Midlands, and Smooth Radio 105.7 are some of the local radio stations that can be received in Dudley, also serving the wider West Midlands. Black Country Community Radio broadcasts online from its Dudley Studios serving The Central and Northern Black Country. The Kates Hill Press, founded in 1992 and named after a famous Dudley landmark, is a small press concentrating on the publishing of fiction and non-fiction of mainly local and regional interest. 

==Economy==
===Retail===

As a commercial centre, Dudley&#x27;s town centre has become increasingly run down; in 2012 nearly a third of its shop units lay vacant, the highest figure for a centre of its size in England. Retailing was particularly hard hit by the opening of the Merry Hill Shopping Centre away, between 1985 and 1990. This led to the exit of the majority of major retailers, including British Home Stores (June 1990), Marks &amp; Spencer (August 1990), Sainsbury&#x27;s (August 1989), C&amp;A (January 1992), and Littlewoods (January 1990), all of which closed before or soon after new stores opened at Merry Hill. Although the town was already in slight decline at the time following the recession of the early 1980s, the opening of the Merry Hill Centre resulted in a 70% decline of the town&#x27;s market share in retail between 1985 and 1990.

Successive economic downturns have led to most remaining major retailers leaving the town centre. Department store Beatties closed in 2010, WH Smith in 2013, River Island in 2020, and Argos in 2021; the town centre is now largely occupied by take-away restaurants, charity shops, and gambling centres. The variety of businesses left led to Dudley being named &#x27;the worst place to shop in the UK&#x27; in a 2014 study, which drew condemnation from the local council.

The town&#x27;s market remains a prominent local shopping destination. Established in the 12th century, it is situated on a wide part of the High Street. It has undergone numerous developments in its history, including pedestrianisation in 1982, removal of 12th-century cobblestone paving, and a large-scale redevelopment scheme in 2015.

===Industry===
The Bean Cars factory was opened in the first years of the twentieth century and remained in use until the 1930s, but survives to this day for other industrial use.

==Sport==
===Association football===

The town&#x27;s key football teams, Dudley Town F.C. and Dudley Sports F.C. have never progressed beyond the Southern League.

Dudley Town is the older of the town&#x27;s two clubs, and have enjoyed the most success. Their most notable success came in 1985 when they won promotion to the Southern Premier League, but in the same year they were forced to quit Dudley Sports Centre (at the junction of Tipton Road and Birmingham Road) due to mining subsidence. They played at Round Oak Sports Ground in Brierley Hill for the next 11 years, and then spent a season ground-sharing at Halesowen Town, before resigning from the Southern League due to financial difficulties. The club was reformed in 1999 to compete in the West Midlands Regional League, and ground-share with Stourbridge at the War Memorial Athletic Ground.

In 1981, when still playing at Dudley Sports Centre, Dudley Town played a prestigious game against Wolverhampton Wanderers to commemorate a refurbishment of the stadium, with the new floodlights being switched on by legendary former Wolves player Billy Wright.

For some time after leaving Dudley Sports Centre, there were hopes that it could be made safe for Dudley Town to return, but these plans never materialised and the site was instead redeveloped as a business and leisure complex which has been developing since 2000. The club now play at Noose Lane in Willenhall.

===Rugby football===
The Dudley Kingswinford Rugby Club is the local rugby team, which play at their grounds in Wall Heath.

===Motor sports===
For a short period, a speedway team called Dudley Heathens attempted to find a site to race in Dudley.
The team plays in Wolverhampton and Birmingham due to the lack of a speedway track within the Dudley borough. The team were originally called the Cradley Heath Heathens, due to the proximity of their home track at Dudley Wood Stadium to the Cradley Heath/Dudley boundary. The stadium was demolished in the mid-1990s to make way for housing development, with the club disbanding shortly afterwards, before it re-formed with the name Dudley Heathens in 2010. Though there have been attempts by the club to move back into the town, they have so far been rejected by the local authority. The team re-adopted the name Cradley Heathens in 2013. Former World Champion riders from the team include Erik Gundersen and Bruce Penhall.

===Volleyball===
Following a merger with the Coseley Volleyball Club, Wombourne V.C. play at the Evolve campus of Dudley College, in the town centre. They compete in the West Midlands Volleyball Association.

==Twin towns==
Dudley is twinned with:
* Fort William, Scotland

<text>A handkerchief (; also called a hankie or, historically, a handkercher or a ) is a form of a kerchief or bandanna, typically a hemmed square of thin fabric which can be carried in the pocket or handbag for personal hygiene purposes such as wiping one&#x27;s hands or face, or blowing one&#x27;s nose. A handkerchief is also sometimes used as a purely decorative accessory in the breast pocket of a suit; it can then be called a pocket square. A handkerchief is also an important accessory in many folk-dances in many regions like the Balkans and the Middle East; an example of a folk-dance featuring handkerchiefs is the Greek Kalamatianós.

==Modern usage==
The material of a handkerchief can be symbolic of the socio-economic class of the user, not only because some materials are more expensive, but because some materials are more absorbent and practical for those who use a handkerchief for more than style. Handkerchiefs can be made of cotton, cotton-synthetic blend, synthetic fabric, silk, or linen.

Handkerchiefs are also used as an impromptu way to carry around small items when a bag or basket is unavailable. They could also serve as a substitute for a bandage over a small injury. In the United Kingdom, the habit of wearing a handkerchief with tied corners on one&#x27;s head at the beach has become a seaside postcard stereotype.

From the late 18th century white handkerchiefs were waved, generally by women (men usually waved their hats), to demonstrate approval at public events such as processions or political rallies.

Using handkerchiefs to accentuate hand movements while dancing is a feature of both West African and African-American traditional dance, in the latter case especially in wedding celebrations. Handkerchiefs are also traditional accoutrements in certain kinds of English folk dance, such as the Morris dance.

Besides their intended use, they could be used for cleaning equipment, polishing shoes, cleaning hands and face, signaling for attention, as a sweat band, neckerchief, as protection from dust inhalation, to repair footwear, cut out pieces to patch clothes, cut up as emergency firearms cleaning patches, Molotov cocktail wick (fire-bomb), hot cooking utensil holder, a makeshift bandage, tourniquet, or arm sling.

==Origin==
In the times of ancient Greece and Rome, handkerchiefs were often used the way they are today.

The word handkerchief derives from the word kerchief which came from two French words: , which means &quot;to cover&quot;, and , which means &quot;head&quot;; so a handkerchief is a similar cloth in the hand rather than on the head. (In the Middle Ages, kerchiefs were often used to cover the head.)

Then in the 16th century, people in Europe began to carry kerchiefs in their pockets to wipe their foreheads or their noses. To distinguish this kind of kerchief from the one used to cover the head, the word &quot;hand&quot; was added to &quot;kerchief&quot;. This was then preferred to wiping the nose on a sleeve.

King Richard II of England, who reigned from 1377 to 1399, is widely believed to have invented the cloth handkerchief, as surviving documents written by his courtiers describe his use of square pieces of cloth to wipe his nose. Certainly they were in existence by Shakespeare&#x27;s time, and a handkerchief is an important plot device in his play &quot;Othello&quot;.

A handkerchief was sometimes used by Indian thugs: to take advantage of their victims, the thugs would join travellers and gain their confidence, which would allow them to surprise and strangle the travellers with a handkerchief or noose.

==Pocket square==
In addition to carrying for practical purposes, handkerchiefs have long been displayed in the chest pocket of men&#x27;s jackets. Used in this way, they are referred to as a pocket handkerchief or pocket square.
The trend of pocket squares as a fashion accessory really started during the 1920s, and continued until the 1960s. During that period, actors such as Cary Grant, Fred Astaire and Gary Cooper wore them regularly. The pocket square subsequently fell into disuse until the late 2000s when it made a comeback thanks in part to popular television shows such as &quot;Mad Men&quot;.

Pocket squares are usually made in fabrics such as silk, cotton, linen or wool.

As a visible fashion item there are a wide variety of ways to fold a pocket square, ranging from the austere to the flamboyant:
* The Presidential, or Flat Fold, perhaps the simplest, is folded at right angles to fit in the pocket.
* The Winged Puff, a simple and elegant fold.
* The Puff or the Cooper is simply shaped into a round puff.
* The Reverse Puff, or The Crown Fold, is like the Puff, except with the puff inside and the points out, like petals.
* The Westo Four Point fold, the quickest way to achieve a four-point fold effect.
* The TV Fold looks similar but is folded diagonally with the point inside the pocket.
* The One-point Fold is folded diagonally with the point showing.
* The Two-point Fold is folded off-center so the two points do not completely overlap.
* The Three-point Fold is first folded into a triangle, then the corners are folded up and across to make three points.
* The Four-point Fold is an off-center version of the Three-point Fold.
* The Cagney is basically a backwards version of the Four-point Fold.
* The Astaire is a puff with a point on either side.
* The Straight Shell is pleated and then folded over to give the appearance of nested shells.
* The Diagonal Shell is pleated diagonally and then folded.

Although it is very common practice for weddings, proms, etc., many style authorities do not recommend wearing a matching (i.e., identical) pocket square and tie, as it tends to look contrived, draws attention away from the wearer&#x27;s face, and displays sartorial uncertainty. Instead, the two items should coordinate without matching; for example, by matching a secondary color in the necktie&#x27;s pattern to a secondary color in the pocket square&#x27;s pattern.

== &quot;Rumāl&quot; ==
A &quot;rumāl&quot; is a small loose piece of cloth, similar to a handkerchief used to cover the head by Sikh boys, sportspersons and other guests who visit a Gurdwara. In Sikhism, the &quot;rumal&quot; is held in the same regard as the turban.

=== Chamba Rumal ===

Chamba Rumal is an embroidered handicraft handkerchief of Chamba.

==In popular culture==
The hero of 2023 comedy horror film Hanky Panky is a talking handkerchief named Woody.

<doc id="266720" wikidata="Q1024624" url="?curid=266720" title="Greater Toronto Area">
<text>The Greater Toronto Area, commonly referred to as the GTA, includes the City of Toronto and the regional municipalities of Durham, Halton, Peel, and York. In total, the region contains 25 urban, suburban, and rural municipalities. The Greater Toronto Area begins in Burlington in Halton Region to the west, and extends along Lake Ontario past downtown Toronto eastward to Clarington in Durham Region.

According to the 2021 census, the Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) of Toronto has a total population of 6.202 million residents, making it the nation&#x27;s largest, and the 7th-largest in North America. However, the Greater Toronto Area, which is an economic area defined by the Government of Ontario, includes communities that are not included in the CMA, as defined by Statistics Canada. Extrapolating the data for all 25 communities in the Greater Toronto Area from the 2021 Census, the total population for the economic region included 6,711,985 people.

The Greater Toronto Area is a part of several larger areas in Southern Ontario. The area is also combined with the city of Hamilton to form a conurbation known as the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA). The GTHA combined with Niagara Region form the core of the Golden Horseshoe.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Greater Toronto&quot; was first used in writing as early as the 1900s although at the time, the term referred only to the old city of Toronto and to its immediate townships and villages, which became Metropolitan Toronto in 1954 and became the current city of Toronto in 1998. The use of the term involving the four surrounding regional municipalities came into formal use in the mid-1980s, when it was used in a widely discussed report on municipal governance restructuring in the region and was later made official as a provincial planning area. However, it did not come into everyday usage until the mid-to-late 1990s.

In 2006, the term began to be supplanted in the field of spatial planning as provincial policy increasingly began to refer to either the &quot;Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area&quot; (GTHA) or the still-broader &quot;Greater Golden Horseshoe&quot;. The latter includes the Greater Toronto Area&#x27;s satellite municipalities, such as Peterborough, Barrie, Guelph, Kitchener, Waterloo, Cambridge and Niagara Region. The GTA continues, however, to be in official use elsewhere in the Government of Ontario, such as the Ministry of Finance.

==Census metropolitan area==


Some municipalities considered part of the GTA are not within the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), which is smaller than the land area and population of the GTA planning area. For example, Oshawa is the centre of its own CMA, yet deemed part of the Greater Toronto Area, while other municipalities, such as New Tecumseth in southern Simcoe County and Mono Township in Dufferin County are included in the Toronto CMA but not in the GTA. These different border configurations result in the GTA&#x27;s population being higher than the Toronto CMA by nearly one-half million people, often leading to confusion amongst people when trying to sort out Toronto&#x27;s urban population.

Other nearby urban areas, such as Hamilton, Barrie, St. Catharines-Niagara or Kitchener-Waterloo, are not part of the GTA or the Toronto CMA, but form their own CMAs near the GTA. Ultimately, all the aforementioned places are part of the Greater Golden Horseshoe metropolitan region, an urban agglomeration, which is the fifth most populous in North America. It is part of the Great Lakes megalopolis, containing an estimated 59.1 million people in 2011.

===Extended area===
The term &quot;Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area&quot; (GTHA) refers to the GTA, and the city of Hamilton, located along the western border of the Greater Toronto Area. The term has been adopted by several organizations, including Metrolinx and the Ministry of Energy) because of the growing commuter population in the combined region. The GTHA and the Regional Municipality of Niagara form the inner ring of the larger Greater Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration and secondary region of Ontario.

==History==
===Early history===
Historically the Greater Toronto Area was home to a number of First Nations who lived on the shore of Lake Ontario long before the first Europeans arrived in the region. At various times, the Neutral, the Seneca, the Mohawk and the Huron nations were living in the vicinity. The Mississaugas arrived in the late 17th or early 18th century, driving out the occupying Iroquois. While it is unclear as to who was the first European to reach the Toronto area, there is no question it occurred in the 17th century.

The area would later become very crucial for its series of trails and water routes that led from northern and western Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Known as the &quot;Toronto Passage&quot;, it followed the Humber River, as an important overland shortcut between Lake Ontario, Lake Simcoe and the upper Great Lakes. For this reason the area, under French fur traders, became a major part of the North American fur trade. The French would later establish three trading forts, Magasin Royal in the 1720s, although abandoned within the decade, Fort Toronto in 1750 and Fort Rouillé in 1751. During the Seven Years&#x27; War both forts were abandoned but Fort Toronto was later renovated. Fort Rouillé was burnt down after the Battle of Fort Niagara in 1759 by the French garrison during the French and Indian War.

The first large influx of European settlers to settle the region were the United Empire Loyalists arriving after the American Revolution, when various individuals petitioned the Crown for land in and around the Toronto area. In 1787, the British negotiated the purchase of more than a quarter million acres () of land in the area of Toronto with the Mississaugas of New Credit. York County, would later be created by Governor John Graves Simcoe in 1792, which would at its largest size, comprise all of what is now Halton Region, Toronto, Peel Region, York Region and parts of Durham Region.

The GTA saw three American incursions during the War of 1812. The Town of York (present-day Toronto) was attacked by American forces at Battle of York, on April 27, 1813; and was subsequently occupied until May 8. The second incursion occurred several months later, in July 1813, with two landings in the GTA. On July 29, American forces landed at Burlington Beach (present-day Burlington) in an attempt to dislodge British forces at the adjacent Burlington Heights. However, finding the British forces too well-entrenched for any assault to be successful, the American naval force withdrew and proceeded east towards York. The American landings at York on July 31 went unopposed, with most of the soldiers garrisoned at York directed to defend Burlington Heights. The third incursion occurred a year later, when an American naval squadron arrived outside of York&#x27;s harbour on August 6, 1814. The squadron dispatched to enter the harbour in order to gauge the town&#x27;s defences, where it briefly exchanged cannon fire with Fort York before withdrawing to rejoin the American squadron outside the harbour. American forces did not attempt a landing during this incursion, although remained outside York&#x27;s harbour for three days before departing.

In 1816, Wentworth County (which would later become the city of Hamilton) and Halton County were created from York County. York County would later serve as the setting for the beginnings of the Upper Canada Rebellion with William Lyon Mackenzie&#x27;s armed march from Holland Landing towards York Township on Yonge Street, eventually leading up to the battle at Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern. In 1851, Ontario County (present-day Durham Region) and Peel County were separated from York.
===Since 1901===

The idea towards a streamlined local government to control local infrastructure was made as early as 1907 by, William Findlay Maclean, a member of parliament and founder of &quot;The Toronto World&quot;, who called for the expansion of the government of the former City of Toronto in order to create a &quot;Greater Toronto&quot;. The idea for a single government municipality would not be seriously explored until the late 1940s when planners decided the city needed to incorporate its immediate suburbs. However, due to strong opposition from suburban politicians, a compromise was struck, which resulted in the creation of Metropolitan Toronto. In 1953, the portion of York County south of Steeles Avenue, a concession road which formed a common boundary between several townships across the width of the county, was severed from it and incorporated as the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto. With the concession of Metro Toronto, the offices of York County were moved from Toronto to Newmarket.

Originally, the membership in Metropolitan Toronto included the City of Toronto and five townships: East York, Etobicoke, North York, Scarborough and York; as well as seven villages and towns, which became amalgamated into their surrounding townships in 1967. The early Metro Toronto government debated over the annexation of surrounding townships of Markham, Pickering and Vaughan. Frederick Goldwin Gardiner, the first Metro Toronto Chairman, planned on the conversion of these townships into boroughs of the Metro Toronto government. In 1971, the remaining areas of York County was replaced by the Ontario government with the Regional Municipality of York. In 1974, Ontario and Durham Counties were reorganized to become the Regional Municipality of Durham; Pickering west of Rouge River was transferred to Scarborough at that time. Peel County became Peel Region in 1974 as well. In 1980, North York would be incorporated into a city, with York following suit in 1983 and Etobicoke and Scarborough in 1984, although still part of the Metropolitan Toronto municipal government.
In 1992, the Ontario government passed legislation requiring Metropolitan Toronto to include the rest of the Greater Toronto Area into its planning. However, there was fear different parts of the municipal system were working against one another. Therefore, Bob Rae, the Premier of Ontario, appointed Anne Golden to head a GTA task force to govern the region&#x27;s quality of life, competitiveness and governance. During this time, the Metro Toronto government advocated to the task force the creation of a new GTA authority, which would be made up of 21 of the 30 existing municipalities in the GTA at the time. The proposal from Metro Toronto would have resulted in 15 new municipalities. The City of Mississauga argued consolidation should take place only in such a way the new municipalities would have a population between 400,000 and 800,000. The Town of Markham had similarly advocated municipal consolidation in York Region but opposed to complete consolidation into a single municipality. Municipal consolidation faced stiff opposition, however. from smaller communities such as Ajax, Milton, and the borough of East York.

The task force&#x27;s recommendation to eliminate the Metro Toronto government, and consolidate its remaining municipalities into an enlarged City of Toronto was completed in 1997 and became official in 1998, under the Common Sense Revolution of the then premier, Mike Harris. However, the task force&#x27;s recommendation to create a GTA-wide upper-tier municipality was not taken up by the Harris government for fear that a GTA-wide municipality would recreate the intermunicipal competitiveness that was believed to have impaired the former Metro Toronto government.

Metrolinx, an agency of the Government of Ontario, was established to oversee public transit development across the Greater Toronto Area.

The Greater Toronto Area hosted the 2015 Pan American Games.

==Geography==


The Greater Toronto Area covers an area of . The region itself is bordered by Lake Ontario to the south, Kawartha Lakes to the east, the Niagara Escarpment to the west, and Lake Simcoe to the north. The region creates a natural ecosystem known as the Greater Toronto Bioregion. The Greater Toronto Area forms part of the neck of the Ontario Peninsula.

Vast parts of the region remain farmland and forests, making it one of the distinctive features of the geography of the GTA. Most of the urban areas in the GTA hold large urban forest. For the most part designated as parkland, the ravines are largely undeveloped. Rouge Park is also one of the largest nature parks within the core of a metropolitan area. Much of these areas also constitute the Toronto ravine system, which consists of deep and steep valleys, and a number of conservation areas in the region which are managed by Toronto and Region Conservation Authority. The Cheltenham Badlands, in Caledon, is an example of environmental degradation from poor agricultural practice. The Scarborough Bluffs are part of the Glacial Lake Iroquois shoreline.

In 2005, the Government of Ontario also passed legislation to prevent urban development and sprawl on environmentally sensitiveland in the Greater Toronto Area, known as the Greenbelt; many of the areas include protected sections of the Oak Ridges Moraine, Rouge Park, and the Niagara Escarpment. Nevertheless, low-density suburban developments continue to be built, some of which is on or near ecologically sensitive and protected areas. The provincial government attempted to address the issue through the &quot;Places to Grow&quot; legislation passed in 2005, which emphasizes higher-density growth in existing urban centres over the next 25 years (i.e., until 2030).

===Climate===
The climate of the Greater Toronto Area is classified as humid continental, according to the Köppen climate classification. Much of the Greater Toronto Area is under Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot; (warm summer subtype) zone. Old Toronto (excluding the Toronto Islands) and some areas between there and Burlington to the southwest are under the Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot; climate zone, the hot summer subtype. Precipitation averages annually, which is fairly distributed through the year but is driest in later winter with higher average totals in the later summer.

In winter, typical high temperatures will range from and low temperatures from . Cold arctic outbreaks keep daytime highs below for several daysmmbut that does not occur in every winter, and low temperatures sometimes drop below , with the accompanying wind chill making that feel much colder. Annual snowfall averages between across the area. Mild and snow-free spells are also a feature of Toronto&#x27;s winter, with temperatures surpassing for several days to occasionally above . Spring is short and often cool to mild, and snow can sometimes fall well into April but rarely accumulates. The transition from spring into summer can be rapid. Summer is warm on average to hot and moderately humid with high temperatures typically between , while low temperatures average between in the suburbs and downtown and near the lake. Although fairly sunny, summers have long stretches of humid conditions that give rise to frequent thunderstorm activity, and very heavy rainfall sometimes results in flash flooding. Heat wave conditions with temperatures between are common but typically do not last long, and rarely temperatures rarely reach . Humidex values can be high during heat episodes; at their highest, they have exceeded . Immediate lakeshore locations have generally lower average maximum temperatures but they can also experience hot conditions when offshore winds prevail. Normally, autumns alternate between wet and dry with lengthy periods of mild and calm weather. Temperatures fall and windspeeds increase sharply in November. By December, cold and snowy weather is more common, and the average temperature falls close to or just below .

==Economy==

The Greater Toronto Area is a commercial, distribution, financial and economic centre and is the second-largest financial centre in North America. The region generates about a fifth of Canada&#x27;s GDP and is home to 40 per cent of Canada&#x27;s business headquarters. The economies of the municipalities in Greater Toronto are largely intertwined. The work force is made up of approximately 2.9 million people and more than 100,000 companies The Greater Toronto Area produces nearly 20 percent of the entire nation&#x27;s GDP with $323 billion, and from 1992 to 2002, experienced an average GDP growth rate of 4.0 per cent and a job creation rate of 2.4 per cent (compared with the national average GDP growth rate of 3 per cent and job creation rate of 1.6 per cent). The Greater Toronto Area has the largest regional economy in Canada, with its GDP surpassing the Province of Quebec in 2015.

In 2010, over 51 per cent of the labour force in the Greater Toronto Area is employed in the service sector, with 19% in the manufacturing, 17% of the labour force employed in wholesale &amp; retail trade, 8% of the labour force involved in transportation, communication and utilities, and 5% of the workforce is involved in construction. Although the service industry makes up only 51% of Greater Toronto&#x27;s workforce, over 72% of the region&#x27;s GDP is generated by service industries.

The largest industry in the Greater Toronto Area is the financial services in the province, accounting for an estimated 25% of the region&#x27;s GDP. Notably, the five largest banks in Canada all have their operational headquarters in Toronto&#x27;s Financial District. Toronto is also home to the headquarters of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Standard and Poor TSX Composite Index and offices of the TSX Venture Exchange. The TMX Group, the owners and operators of TSX Exchanges as well as the Montreal Exchange, are also headquartered in Toronto. The TSX and the TSX Venture Exchange represent 3,369 companies, including more than half of the world&#x27;s publicly-traded mining companies.

Markham also attracted the highest concentration of high tech companies in Canada, and because of it, has positioned itself as &quot;Canada&#x27;s High-Tech Capital&quot;. The Greater Toronto Area is the second-largest automotive centre in North America (after Detroit). Currently, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler run six assembly plants in the area, with Honda and Toyota having assembly plants just outside the GTA. General Motors, Ford, Honda, KIA, Mazda, Suzuki, Nissan, Volkswagen, Toyota, Hyundai, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover, Subaru, Volvo, BMW, and Mitsubishi have chosen the Greater Toronto Area for their Canadian headquarters. Magna International, the world&#x27;s most diversified car supplier, also has its headquarters in Aurora. The automobile industry accounts for roughly 10% of the region&#x27;s GDP.

===Agriculture===

While it was once the most dominant industry for residents in the Greater Toronto Area, agriculture now occupies a small percentage of the population though it is still a large part of land in the surrounding four regional municipalities. Census data from 2006 has shown there are 3,707 census farms in the GTA, down 4.2 percent from 2001 and covering . Almost every community in the GTA is currently experiencing a decrease in the acreage of farmland, with Mississauga seeing the most significant one. The only communities in the GTA that are experiencing a growth in the acreage of farmland are Aurora, Georgina, Newmarket, Oshawa, Richmond Hill, and Scugog, with Markham experiencing no growth or decline. Most of the GTA&#x27;s farmland is in Durham Region, with 55% of their total land area being farmland. This is followed by York Region with 41% of their lands being farmland, Peel Region with 34%, and Halton Region with 41%. Toronto&#x27;s remaining farmland is completely within Rouge Park in the Rouge Valley. The average size of the farm in the GTA () is much lower than the farms in the rest of Ontario (averaging ). This has been attributed to the shift of farm types in the GTA from the traditional livestock and cash crop farms (requiring an extensive land base), towards more intensive enterprises including greenhouse, floriculture, nursery, vegetable, fruit, sheep and goats.

The most numerous farm types in the GTA are miscellaneous specialty farms (including horse and pony, sheep and lamb, and other livestock specialty), followed by cattle, grain and oilseed, dairy and field crop farms. Although the output of dairy production has dropped with farms from within the GTA, dairy has remained the most productive sector in the agricultural industry by annual gross farm receipts. Despite the decreased amount of farmland around the region, farm capital value increased from $5.2 billion in 1996 to $6.1 billion in 2001, making the average farm capital value in the GTA continued to be the highest in the province.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

There are several public transportation operators within the Greater Toronto Area that provide services within their jurisdictions. While those operators are largely independent, provisions are being made to integrate them under Metrolinx, which manages transportation planning including public transport in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. GO Transit, which merged with Metrolinx during the late 2000s, is Ontario&#x27;s only intra-regional public transit service, linking the communities in the GTA and the city of Hamilton, as well as the rest of the Greater Golden Horseshoe. The implementation of the Presto card by Metrolinx has created a common means for all fare payments and allows for seamless connection between these and other transit operators.

Public transit operators in the GTA include Brampton Transit, Burlington Transit, Durham Region Transit, GO Transit, Milton Transit, MiWay (serving Mississauga), Oakville Transit, Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), and York Region Transit. The TTC operates the Toronto subway system, which consists of three heavy rail lines and runs in Toronto and in Vaughan, the latter of which began to be served by the system in December 2017 with an extension of Line 1 Yonge–University to Vaughan Metropolitan Centre station on Highway 7 at Jane Street.

The GTA also consists of several King&#x27;s Highways and supplemented by municipal expressways. One of the principal highways in the GTA, Highway 401, is also the longest in Ontario and is also one of the widest and busiest highways in the world. Notably, a segment of the highway passing through the GTA is North America&#x27;s busiest highway. The GTA is laced with a number of limited-access highways including the 400-series highways. These include:


* Highway 400 – York, Toronto
* Highway 401 – Durham, Toronto, Peel, Halton
* Highway 403 – Peel, Halton
* Highway 404 – York, Toronto
* / 407 ETR / Highway 407 – Durham, Peel, York, Halton (toll route)
* Highway 409 – Toronto, Peel
* Highway 410 – Peel
* Highway 412 – Durham
* Highway 418 – Durham
* Highway 427 – York, Toronto, Peel
* Queen Elizabeth Way – Peel, Halton, Toronto
* Gardiner Expressway – Toronto
* Don Valley Parkway – Toronto
* William R. Allen Road – Toronto
The main airport serving the GTA is Toronto Pearson International Airport in Mississauga, which is Canada&#x27;s largest and busiest airport. It processed over 47 million passengers in 2017 and nearly 50 million passengers in 2018. Toronto Pearson International Airport is operated by the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA). John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport in nearby Hamilton also handles international flights, handles some discount flights and charters, and acts as an alternative to Pearson. The Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, on the Toronto Islands near downtown, is used for civil aviation, air ambulance traffic and regional scheduled airlines (it handled nearly two million passengers in 2012). There are also a number of smaller airports scattered throughout the GTA. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) uses &quot;YTO&quot; as a code for multiple airports in the area, including those without passenger service.

The Greater Toronto Airport Authority has also placed a tentative proposal to develop a new airport in Pickering, which would also extend over into Markham and Uxbridge. As the GTAA predicts Toronto Pearson would be unable to be the sole provider for the bulk of Toronto&#x27;s commercial air traffic in the next 20 years from the report&#x27;s publication in 2004 (i.e. in 2024), it believes that a new airport in Pickering would address the need for a regional/reliever airport east of Toronto Pearson and complement the airport in Hamilton, Ontario. The GTAA also stated the new airport would create more opportunities for economic development in the eastern region of the Greater Toronto Area. However, demand for the new airport lessened because of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath, as well as the planned Alto high-speed railway.

The region also has significant maritime infrastructure being on the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway system. The Port of Oshawa and Port of Toronto handle between 2 and 4 million tonnes of cargo annually. The Port of Toronto also has an International Marine Passenger Terminal, which had 12,000 cruise passengers in 2019.

===Communication===
The Greater Toronto Area is served by seven distinct telephone area codes. Before 1993, the GTA used the 416 area code. In a 1993 zone split, Metropolitan Toronto retained the 416 code, while the other municipalities of the Greater Toronto Area were assigned the new area code 905. This division by area code has become part of the local culture to the point where local media refer to something inside Toronto as &quot;the 416&quot; and outside of Toronto as &quot;the 905&quot;. For example, the Raptors 905 basketball team in the NBA G League is named after the area code the team represents. Though for the most part, the use of the area 905 as shorthand for the suburban areas outside Toronto city limits was correct, it is not entirely true as some portions of Durham and York Regions use the 705 area code. Furthermore, there are areas, such as Hamilton, the Regional Municipality of Niagara and Port Hope (in Northumberland County) that use the 905 area code, but are not part of the GTA. The unincorporated community of Acton (in Halton Hills), is the only community in the GTA that uses the 519 area code, which covers most of Southwestern Ontario.

To meet the increased demand for phone numbers, two overlay area codes were introduced in 2001. Area code 647 (supplementing the 416 area code) was introduced in March 2001 and area code 289 (supplementing the 905 area code) was introduced in July 2001. Some individuals within the 905 area code region may have to dial long distance to reach each other; although residents of Mississauga and Hamilton share the same area code (905), an individual from Toronto, for example, would have to dial &quot;1&quot; to reach Hamilton, but not to reach Mississauga. Ten-digit telephone dialling, including the area code for local calls, is required throughout the GTA. In March 2013, two additional area codes were introduced to the GTA: area code 437 in Toronto and area code 365 in the area served by 905 and 289.

==Government==
Since the 2015 election, the Greater Toronto Area has been represented by 58 Members of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada. Forty-six Members of the Provincial Parliament also represent the GTA in the Ontario Legislature. Five Senators from Ontario have also designated themselves as representatives of certain areas in the GTA in the Canadian Senate.

===Federal politics===
Federally, the Conservatives, Liberals, and the New Democrats (NDP) all hold several electoral districts in the GTA. The City of Toronto has often been supportive of the Liberal Party. Traditionally, Liberal support is strongest in Downtown Toronto, while Conservative support is stronger in the surrounding communities outside Toronto. The NDP also has a strong base within the GTA. The Greater Toronto Area has the ability to influence election results and determine the governing party in Canada, due in part to its large population and riding count.

From 1993 to 2011, a centre-right party failed to win a single seat in the former Metro Toronto. In the 2011 election, however, a surge in NDP support combined with a collapse in Liberal support allowed the Conservatives to win eight seats in Toronto itself, and another 24 in the suburbs. Toronto&#x27;s political leanings now appeared to mirror those of surrounding communities that leaned toward the Conservatives.

The election of 2011 showed Liberal support, based on votes in the GTA, had collapsed from 43.7% to 30.6%, giving the Liberals only 14.9% of the local seats in the House of Commons. However, the support of the Conservatives and NDP increased accordingly, with the Conservatives increasing their vote share from 31.5% to 42.2% (and capturing 68.1% of the GTA seats) and the NDP increasing from 14.6% to 23.2% of the vote and 17% of the local Federal ridings.

In the 2015 federal election, the Liberals regained their dominance of the GTA after suffering devastating losses there four years earlier. They defeated a number of prominent incumbents from both the NDP and the Conservatives. The Liberals took all of Toronto itself. They also took back almost all of the suburban ridings they had lost in 2011. Both the NDP and the Conservatives suffered heavily as their support collapsed in the inner city and the suburbs respectively. Only a few Conservatives held onto their seats in the outer ring of the GTA, while the NDP failed to elect any MPs in this area. The 2019 and 2021 federal elections have similar results.

===Provincial politics===

Toronto is the capital of Ontario with the Ontario Legislative Building, often metonymically known as Queen&#x27;s Park after the street and park surrounding it, being located in Downtown Toronto. Most of the provincial government offices are also located in downtown Toronto.

On the provincial level of government, the Ontario Progressive Conservatives (PCs), Ontario Liberals, and the Ontario New Democrats all hold electoral districts in the GTA. While the GTA provided a strong base of support for the Progressive Conservative government between 1995 and 2003, the Ontario Liberal Party achieved a major victory in the GTA during the 2003 election and has enjoyed strong support from the region ever since. In the 2011 election, the Liberals won 33 of the 44 available seats in the GTA, allowing Premier Dalton McGuinty to hold onto a minority government. The 2014 election under McGuinty&#x27;s successor, Kathleen Wynne, was an even bigger electoral landslide for the Liberals, as they won 38 seats in the region. They even took several ridings in territory that had voted PC for decades, like Durham, Burlington, Newmarket-Aurora and Halton. The PCs hold no seats in Peel Region and only one seat in each of the Halton, York, and Durham regions. While the NDP has been weak in the GTA since the 1995 election, it has seen some successes in Brampton and Durham Region, where they hold one seat each.

The Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario did not win a riding in the City of Toronto during a general election from 1999 to 2018. On the other end of the spectrum, the NDP saw major losses in Toronto during the 2014 election and held only two seats in the city. That is no longer the case since the 2018 provincial election, as the Progressive Conservatives and the NDP made significant gains at the expense of the Liberals; that continues to hold true in the 2022 provincial election.

===Municipal politics===
In 2011, 244 politicians govern the Greater Toronto Area below the provincial and federal levels, holding offices in cities, towns, and regional municipalities. Unusual for a large North American urban agglomeration, the GTA has very few agencies with powers that can cross boundaries.
Attempts to create an interregional organization have been made, such as the Province of Ontario&#x27;s Office of the Greater Toronto Area (OGTA) in 1988 and the Greater Toronto Services Board (GTSB) in 1998, but they have failed by the lack of real authority in those agencies.

Consequently, there are few interregional public authorities: Metrolinx, an agency of the provincial government, manages the GTA-wide GO Transit system, while the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority manages some of the GTA&#x27;s watersheds and natural areas. Notably, there is no organization with broad powers as in other Canadian cities, such as the Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal and Metro Vancouver Regional District.

==Demographics==
=== Population ===

According to the latest census data from 2021 from Statistics Canada, the population of this area is 6,712,341. Population growth studies have projected the City of Toronto&#x27;s population in 2031 to be 3,000,000 and the Greater Toronto Area&#x27;s population to be 7,450,000, while the Ontario Ministry of Finance states it could reach 7.7 million by 2025. Statistics Canada identified in 2001 that four major urban regions in Canada exhibited a cluster pattern of concentrated population growth among which included the Greater Golden Horseshoe Census Region, which includes all of the Greater Toronto Area (which includes Oshawa), as well as other Southern Ontario cities including Hamilton, Guelph, Barrie, and the cities in Niagara Region and Waterloo Region. Combined, the Greater Golden Horseshoe has a population of 9,765,188 in 2021, containing over 20 per cent of Canada&#x27;s population.

===Ethnicity===
Statistics Canada found in 2006, there were 31,910 Indigenous people living in the Greater Toronto Area, which represented 2.7 per cent of all Indigenous peoples in Canada and 13.2 per cent of those in Ontario. Most of them, however, are not registered with the Indian reserves within the Greater Toronto Area, the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation and the Mississaugas of Scugog Island First Nation.


=== Immigration ===
In 2009, the Toronto CMA also has one of the largest proportions of foreign-born residents (46 per cent) as a share of the total population out of all metropolitan areas in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Toronto region is also unusually diverse in the composition of its ethnicities. The four largest foreign-born populations of Toronto constitute only 15 per cent of the total foreign-born population. That is opposed to the four largest foreign-born populations of other metropolitan areas such as New York City and London, where they make up 25 per cent of their respective foreign-born populations.

==Education==
Education in the Greater Toronto Area is managed by the provincial Ministry of Education, who manages preschool, elementary and secondary education, while the provincial Ministry of Colleges and Universities administers laws relating to tertiary education, including colleges, universities, and vocational schools.

===Primary and secondary education===
There are presently twelve public English first language school boards, and two French first language school boards operating within the GTA. Seven of these school boards operate secular schools, whereas the other seven operate separate schools; the seven separate school boards in the Greater Toronto Area all serve the Roman Catholic faith. In addition to public schools, there are also many private schools that operate within Greater Toronto.

Three of these GTA-based public school boards also manage institutions outside Greater Toronto, the two French first language school boards, based in Toronto, as well as the Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board (DPCDSB). Conversely, English first language public schools in Clarington, a municipality within Durham Region, are managed by school boards based outside the GTA.
===Post-secondary education===
====Colleges====
The Greater Toronto Area is also home to six publicly funded colleges that have campuses spread in and around the metropolitan area. The six publicly funded colleges based in the Greater Toronto Area include:

* Centennial College (Toronto, Pickering)
* Durham College (Pickering, Brock, Scugog, Oshawa, Uxbridge)
* George Brown College (Toronto)
* Humber Polytechnic (Toronto; formerly Humber College)
* Seneca Polytechnic (King, Markham, Toronto; formerly Seneca College)
* Sheridan College (Brampton, Mississauga, Oakville)

Another publicly funded college, Collège Boréal, also maintains a satellite campus in Toronto. However, Collège Boréal&#x27;s main campus and administration is based outside the GTA, in Greater Sudbury. In addition to publicly funded colleges, there are also many private career colleges spread throughout the Greater Toronto Area.

====Universities====

The Greater Toronto Area is home to six publicly funded universities. Universities based within Greater Toronto include:

* OCAD University (Toronto)
* Ontario Tech University (Oshawa)
* Toronto Metropolitan University (Toronto; formerly Ryerson University)
* Université de l&#x27;Ontario français (Toronto)
* University of Toronto (Toronto, Mississauga)
* York University (Toronto, Markham)

Three publicly funded universities based outside of the GTA operate satellite campuses within the GTA, including the Hamilton-based McMaster University, Peterborough-based Trent University, and the Guelph-based University of Guelph. The McMaster&#x27;s DeGroote School of Business operates the Ron Joyce Centre in Burlington; Trent University operates a satellite campus in Oshawa, referred to as Trent in Oshawa; The University of Guelph operates an affiliated institution alongside Humber College, the University of Guelph-Humber, in Toronto.

There also are eleven private religious universities spread throughout the GTA.

<text>NoHo, short for &quot;North of [[NoHo, Manhattan|Ho]]uston Street&quot; (as contrasted with SoHo), is a primarily residential neighborhood in Lower Manhattan, New York City. It is bounded by Mercer Street to the west, the Bowery to the east, 9th Street to the north, and Houston Street to the south.

The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission has declared most of the 125-building area a historic district, divided into the NoHo Historic District and the NoHo East Historic District, created in 2003.

==History==
In 1748, Jacob Sperry, a physician from Switzerland, created the city&#x27;s first botanical garden near the current intersection of Lafayette Street and Astor Place. At the time, it was located about north of the developed portion of the city and served as a vacation stop for people from present-day downtown. By 1804, John Jacob Astor bought the site from Sperry and leased it to Joseph Delacroix. Delacroix built a country resort named Vauxhall Gardens on the site; the gardens had previously been located further downtown, in Tribeca.

NoHo soon became an enclave for well-to-do families.
Because of rapid development on Bond, Bleecker, and Great Jones Streets, it was not affordable to build houses on these streets. These streets were among the city&#x27;s most elite at the time, and contained such personalities as &quot;aristocratic&quot; mayor Philip Hone. Therefore, in 1826, after Delacroix&#x27;s lease expired, Astor carved out an upper-class neighborhood from the site with Lafayette Street bisecting eastern gardens from western homes. The street was christened by the Marquis de Lafayette in July 1825.

Wealthy New Yorkers, including Astor and other members of the family, built mansions along this central thoroughfare. Astor built the Astor Library in the eastern portion of the neighborhood as a donation to the city. Alexander Jackson Davis designed eye-catching row houses called LaGrange Terrace (now Colonnade Row) for speculative builder Seth Geer. Geer built the houses for the development in 1833. The area became a fashionable, upper-class residential district, and when Lafayette Street was opened in the 1820s, it quickly became one of the most fashionable streets in New York. This location made the Gardens accessible to residents of nearby Broadway and the Bowery. The houses once contained such notable residents as the Astor family and the Vanderbilt family, in addition to authors Washington Irving, Charles Dickens, and William Makepeace Thackeray. U.S. President John Tyler was married in these houses.

In the summer of 1838, the garden&#x27;s owners opened a saloon for the staging of vaudeville comic operas. Later theatre managers expanded offerings to appeal to a wider range of patrons. By 1850, the rowdier crowds of the Bowery had mostly scared off the upper classes, and fewer people came to the Vauxhall Gardens. The theater buildings were demolished in 1855, and the gardens closed in 1859.

Even so, wealthy New Yorkers lived here through the end of the 19th century. Editor and poet William Cullen Bryant and inventor and entrepreneur Isaac Singer lived in the neighborhood in the 1880s. By the 20th century, warehouses and manufacturing firms moved in. Consequently the elite moved to places such as Murray Hill, and the area fell into disrepair. The neighborhood became mainly a manufacturing district by the 1880s, especially around the relatively wide Bond Street. Terra cotta and brick &quot;loft&quot; buildings were among the new buildings being constructed in this time, and construction of such buildings continued into the 1890s, in the Greek Revival architectural style in homage to the mansions that formerly occupied the area. The demolition of upper-class buildings continued, and by 1902, the southernmost five mansions on Colonnade Row were demolished for the Wanamaker&#x27;s Department Store annex. Most of the mansions on Bond Street, though, lasted through the 1930s.

Not all of NoHo was built for and by the rich and (now) famous. Two Federal architecture-style row houses on the easternmost block of Bleecker Street were once the home of the National Florence Crittenton Mission, providing a home for &quot;fallen women&quot;. 21 Bleecker Street&#x27;s entrance now bears the lettering &quot;Florence Night Mission,&quot; described by the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 1883 as &quot;a row of houses of the lowest character&quot;. The National Florence Crittenton Mission was an organization established in 1883 by philanthropist Charles N. Crittenton. It attempted to reform prostitutes and unwed pregnant women through the creation of establishments where they were to live and learn skills.

That same block of Bleecker Street, between Lafayette and Bowery Streets in NoHo, is also home to both the Margaret Sanger Health Center, headquarters of Planned Parenthood, and the Catholic Sheen Center, immediately adjacent to it. Bleecker Street was the home of Sanger&#x27;s original Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau, operated from another building from 1930 to 1973. Bleecker Street now features Margaret Sanger Square, at the intersection with Mott Street.

After World War II, manufacturing companies moved out of New York City and to the suburbs. By the 1950s, these spaces were rented to artists and small theatre companies. The artists had to go through extensive litigation to live and work in these spaces. By 1960, there were more artists than businesses in these loft spaces. Among the famous artists at the time were Robert Mapplethorpe, who bought a loft in NoHo; Chuck Close, who lived next to him, and street artists Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol. The neighborhood was revitalized in the late 1960s and 1970s. As artists began to rent lofts in the neighborhood in the 1970s and 1980s, the name NoHo came into use to distinguish it from nearby SoHo. Previously, the area now comprising NoHo, SoHo, and eastern Tribeca was known as the warehouse district. The art movement of the 1970s and the preservation movements of the 1990s and 2000s also helped to revitalize the area.

==Preservation==

The area was declared an official city historic district by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1999. From its designation report:

The NoHo Historic District was expanded in 2008. Additionally, another district in the neighborhood, the NoHo East Historic District, was created in 2003. The designations followed considerable effort by and strong support from numerous local community and preservation groups, including the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation and Historic Districts Council, and together, they form a contiguous area of landmarked buildings over 21 city blocks. The 2008 extension is bounded on the west by Lafayette Street, on the east by the Bowery, on the north by East Fourth Street and on the south by Bond Street. It includes 56 buildings and a mid-block parking lot to the south and east of the existing Noho Historic District. It does not include 30 Great Jones Street, a historic building that was partially demolished in early 2008.

Most of the buildings in the extension were built between the 1860s and the early 1900s, when the area had become one of the city&#x27;s major commercial and manufacturing districts. By the late 1800s, larger commercial lofts in the Greek Revival style became the dominant building type.
The Merchant&#x27;s House Museum, at 29 East Fourth Street, is an individual historic building located just outside the eastern boundary of the Historic District. It is also a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Both the inside and outside of this 1832 house have been restored to the mid-19th century style in which merchant Seabury Tredwell and his family lived. Despite the fragility of the structure, in April 2014 the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission approved construction of an eight-story hotel immediately next door. Preservationists including City Councilwoman Rosie Mendez, the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, the Historic Districts Council and the Museum itself fought the proposed hotel for years due to concern for the intact survival of the Merchant&#x27;s House. The LPC approved it over the objections of engineers and architects.

==Gentrification==
In the 2000s and 2010s, NoHo and its southern neighbor, SoHo, has experienced rapid gentrification. Since NoHo is primarily made up of loft apartments, this in turn makes it one of the most expensive and desirable neighborhoods in Manhattan. Its small size and central location also contributes to a high demand, again keeping prices high. In 2014, a one-bedroom loft could rent at an average monthly rate of US$4,000.

==Notable places==

Some individual landmarks in the NoHo Historic District include the Astor Library, the Bouwerie Lane Theater, the Bayard-Condict Building, the De Vinne Press Building. Two New York City Subway stations, Astor Place and Bleecker Street, are also landmarked. The only survivor of the 19th-century upper class era is half of the original Colonnade Row, which is also landmarked. The Gene Frankel Theater, established in 1949, is located in the landmarked 24 Bond Street building, built in 1893.

Across from Colonnade Row is The Public Theater.

The easternmost block of Bleecker Street houses the last remaining Federal architecture-style row houses, including two that were once the home of the Florence Night Mission, which provided a home for &quot;fallen women&quot;. (21 Bleecker Street&#x27;s entrance now bears the lettering in the flooring.) The block also houses the Planned Parenthood headquarters at the Margaret Sanger Square, adjacent to a Catholic event center.

<text>Nordic Gold (Swedish: &quot;nordiskt guld&quot;) is the gold-coloured copper alloy from which many coins are made. The alloy is a type of aluminium bronze. It has been used for a number of coins in many currencies, most notably in euro 50, 20, and 10 cents, in the Swedish 5 and 10 kronor coins (for which it was originally developed and introduced in 1991), as well as the Polish 2 złoty commemorative coins. Its composition is 89% copper, 5% aluminium, 5% zinc, and 1% tin.

Being a copper alloy, it contains no gold. Its colour and density are unlike pure gold. It is non-allergenic; its other advantages include antimycotic and weak antimicrobial (especially after abrasion) attributes, and resistance to tarnishing. It has been studied for its antimicrobial hospital applications.

Nordic Gold was developed by Mariann Sundberg while she worked for the Finnish metal company Outokumpu. The European Central Bank says that the alloy is &quot;difficult to melt and used exclusively for coins.&quot;

==Properties==
Compared to commercial copper metal, Nordic Gold has significantly smaller grains. A thin oxide material is formed after abrasive polishing. The alloy&#x27;s antimicrobial properties were studied extensively in 2014 because it showed promise for use in hospitals, to help prevent MRSA infections. A rather complete description of its electrochemical properties was one result.

<text>Route 157 is a short state highway in the city of Absecon, New Jersey. The route runs for only as North Shore Road from an intersection with U.S. Route 30 (US 30), County Route 585 (CR 585) and Atlantic County Route 601 in the center of Absecon to an intersection with U.S. Route 9 in the northern portion of the city. The route is a former alignment of U.S. Route 9/State Highway Route 4 through Absecon, intersecting with State Highway Route 43 starting in the 1927 state highway renumbering. The route stayed on the alignment until 1930, when U.S. Route 9/Route 4 was bypassed to the west. The former alignment remained unnumbered until the 1953 state highway renumbering, when it was designated as Route 157.

== Route description ==

Route 157 begins at a large intersection with U.S. Route 30 (White Horse Pike), County Route 585 (South Shore Road), Atlantic County Route 601 (New Jersey Avenue) and Creek Road in the city of Absecon. The route heads northward along North Shore Road, passing through the local commercial districts of Absecon. Intersecting with Station Road (the highway connecting Route 157 to the Absecon train station), the route leaves the commercial district and enters the residential areas. There, Route 157 intersects with Atlantic County Route 634 (West Church Street). Route 157 continues northward, intersecting with local roads in a small patch of forestry. At an intersection with Faunce Landing Road, Route 157 turns to the northeast onto its final stretch. Continuing through the forestry, the highway intersects with several local roads and traverses near some residential homes. Still in Absecon, Route 157 becomes surrounded by residential homes, terminating at an intersection with U.S. Route 9 (Wyoming Avenue).

== History ==
Route 157 originates as an alignment of U.S. Route 9/State Highway Route 4 through Absecon (from an intersection with New Jersey Route 43). The route was originally designated in the 1927 renumbering as a state highway from Absecon to Paterson. In 1930, the route was extended southward to Cape May, New Jersey, and the alignment of current-day Route 157 was bypassed to the west. The former alignment of Route 4 was left unnumbered. Route 157 was designated to a previously unnumbered roadway and has remained unchanged since.

<doc id="266737" wikidata="Q826760" url="?curid=266737" title="New Jersey Route 159">
<text>Route 159 is a short, highway in the Montville and Fairfield areas. Route 159&#x27;s western and eastern termini are both at U.S. Route 46 (US 46). Route 159 is called locally as Bloomfield Avenue, Oak Road, and Clinton Road during its length.

Route 159 is a former alignment of U.S. Route 46, until the highway was bypassed in 1941. At that time, U.S. Route 46 also had the designation State Highway Route 6, and when the bypass opened in 1941, the original alignment was designated Route 6M. The 6M designation lasted just twelve years, when in 1953, it was renumbered as Route 159.

==Route description==

Route 159 begins at an interchange of US 46 westbound. Route 159 heads eastward, following a divided Bloomfield Avenue along a commercial strip near the Passaic River. The highway continues, crossing the river, and passing West Essex Park. Nearby to the south are the park&#x27;s woodlands and to the north, across the divided highway, is a large commercial development. Right after West Essex Park ends, Route 159 comes to a Y intersection, where it leaves Bloomfield Avenue and turns to the north along Oak Road; County Route 506 begins here and runs east along Bloomfield Avenue.

Route 159 begins to curve northward, and parallels the commercial development that was only accessible westbound. During the curve away from Bloomfield Avenue, the highway intersects CR 614 Spur (Brook Road) at an at-grade intersection. Route 159 continues its curve, intersecting with CR 614 (Clinton Road). The Oak Road moniker ends at that intersection, where it changes to Clinton Road, a continuation of Route 614&#x27;s right-of-way. With the commercial development to the south of Route 159 now, the highway progresses its way to the north-northwest.

Along Clinton Road, Route 159 passes some residences to the north, and intersects with Ray Place, which connects to the commercial development to the nearby south. There is an intersection with Ludsin Lane, which dead-ends in a local commercial area. After that, there is an intersection with Industrial Road, which serves some industrial development in the area. Route 159 begins to parallel U.S. Route 46 once again, leaving the commercial development behind. Eastbound U.S. Route 46 provides an exit to (but not an entrance from) Route 159. A short distance later, Route 159 ends at a traffic light-controlled intersection with U.S. Route 46, north of where it began. CR 627 continues the right-of-way as Plymouth Street past the eastern terminus of Route 159. Travelers on westbound US 46 who wish to travel to Route 159 must exit at Madison Road before making a left onto Plymouth Street through a jughandle intersection.

==History==

The alignment that Route 159 currently takes was originally an alignment of US 46. In 1941, construction finished of a new bypass of the communities of The Caldwells and Fairfield, where Route 159&#x27;s northern terminus occurs. U.S. Route 46 at the time also had the internal designation of New Jersey State Highway Route 6, which gave the bypassed segment of 6/46 the designation of New Jersey State Highway Route 6M. Route 6M remained intact for twelve years, when the 1953 renumbering of state highways occurred. Route 6M and its parent, Route 6, were decommissioned. Route 6 remained US 46, and Route 6M was redesignated as New Jersey Route 159.

The bridge taking westbound Route 159 (Bloomfield Avenue at that point) over US 46 eastbound and into US 46 westbound (at the western terminus of Route 159) was replaced beginning August 2009 and was re-opened for traffic on December 24, 2009.

<doc id="266738" wikidata="Q1432442" url="?curid=266738" title="Chief Dawid Stuurman International Airport">
<text>Chief Dawid Stuurman International Airport is an airport serving Port Elizabeth (Gqeberha), a city in the Eastern Cape province in South Africa. It was formerly known as [[Hendrik Verwoerd|H. F. Verwoerd]] Airport and Port Elizabeth International Airport. The airport is owned and operated by the Airports Company South Africa which also operates nine other airports around South Africa. The airport is located approximately two miles south of the city&#x27;s central business district. In 2017, the airport served 1,620,705 passengers.

The name of the airport was changed from Port Elizabeth International Airport to Chief Dawid Stuurman International Airport in February 2021.

==History==
A historical highlight was the first flight from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth in 1917, made by Major Allister Mackintosh Miller. At that time, this was considered a long-distance flight, and it heralded the start of the civil aviation industry in Port Elizabeth. This flight and many more has been captured on canvas by Ron Belling and is on display at the Ron Belling Art Gallery.

Port Elizabeth Airport was established in 1929 in close proximity to the city. It was initially founded by Lieutenant Colonel Miller, who needed an airfield to operate his postal service between the city and Cape Town. It was only officially opened some nine years later, in 1936, boasting a single runway, one hangar and a concrete apron. However, the foundations of this infrastructure will be removed to make room for additional vehicle parking.

During World War II, the airfield was extended to accommodate 42 Air School of the Royal Air Force as part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan and 6 Squadron South African Air Force on the southern and eastern sides of the field. Commercial operations were conducted from the northern side. In 1954, it saw the landing of the first jet-propelled aircraft - five De Havilland Vampire FB9s.

Construction of the permanent terminal buildings, runways and an air traffic control building began in 1950. The commercial operation was moved to an airfield at St Albans, some 25 km from the city centre, for the construction period. The new buildings were officially opened in 1955. In 1973 the apron was extended to accommodate larger aircraft and a new departures terminal was opened in 1980.

These facilities served the community till 2000 when plans for a major terminal upgrade was drawn-up. The separate arrivals and departures buildings were consolidated into a single facility with a central retail area linking the departures with arrivals creating a light friendly atmosphere. This facility caters for domestic flights but can be screened off to operate a fully compliant International arrivals and departures section.

The airport&#x27;s name change from Port Elizabeth International Airport to Chief Dawid Stuurman International Airport was officially gazetted on 23 February 2021.

==Facilities==
The airport resides at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 08/26 is and 17/35 is . There are also 13 aircraft parking bays on the apron and the terminal building measures . The modern terminal upgrade was completed in June 2004 allowing the airport to handle up to 2 million passengers a year. In preparation for the 2010 FIFA World Cup runway 08/26 was going to be extended from 1,980m to 3,000m with a view to accommodating International flights, although this never happened. A number of hotels are present on or near the airport. Ground transport is provided by local taxis. The airport also has a selection of parking areas and several car rental offices, including Eurocar and Bidvest.

===South African Air Force===
Air Force Station Port Elizabeth is home to C Flight of 15 Squadron of the South African Air Force. It is a helicopter unit primarily tasked with maritime and landward search and rescue. There is also a branch of the South African Air Force Museum at the airport. The museum houses many historical military jets, helicopters, exhibits and paintings dating from the airport&#x27;s days a World War II base to the end of apartheid.

<text>U.S. Route 46 (US 46) is an east–west U.S. Highway completely within the state of New Jersey, and runs for . The west end is at an interchange with Interstate 80 (I-80) and Route 94 in Columbia, Warren County, on the Delaware River. The east end is in the middle of the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River in Fort Lee, Bergen County, while the route is concurrent with I-95 and US 1-9. Throughout much of its length, US 46 is closely paralleled by I-80. US 46 is a major local and suburban route, with some sections built to or near freeway standards and many other sections arterials with jughandles. The route runs through several communities in the northern part of New Jersey, including Hackettstown, Netcong, Dover, Parsippany–Troy Hills, Wayne, Clifton, Ridgefield Park, Palisades Park, and Fort Lee. It crosses over the Upper Passaic River at several points. The road has been ceremonially named the United Spanish–American War Veterans Memorial Highway.

What is now US 46 was originally designated as three separate routes. Pre-1927 Route 5 was created in 1916 to follow the road from Delaware to Denville, pre-1927 Route 12 in 1917 to follow the route between Hackettstown and Paterson, and pre-1927 Route 10 in 1917 to run between Paterson and Edgewater. In 1927, Route 6 was legislated to run from Delaware east to the George Washington Bridge, replacing portions of Routes 5 and 12 and paralleling the former Route 10, which itself became Route 5 and Route 10N, the latter being shortly removed from the state highway system. In 1936, US 46 was designated to run from US 611 in Portland, Pennsylvania, east to the George Washington Bridge. The route replaced Pennsylvania Route 987 (PA 987) to the Delaware Bridge over the Delaware River, and from there followed Route 6 across New Jersey. In 1953, the Route 6 designation was removed from US 46 in New Jersey, and later that year, the route was realigned to end at US 611 in Columbia, New Jersey, replacing a part of Route 94. US 611 had been brought into New Jersey by two new bridges over the Delaware River, following a freeway between them that became a part of I-80. In 1965, US 611 was aligned back into its original Pennsylvania route (which from 1953 until 1965 was US 611 Alternate), and US 46&#x27;s western terminus remained as an interchange ramp with I-80 and Route 94. Its number is out of place since U.S. Route 46 lies north of U.S. Route 22, U.S. Route 30 and U.S. Route 40.

==Route description==

===Warren County===

US 46 begins at a complex interchange with I-80 and Route 94 near the Portland–Columbia Toll Bridge leading to PA 611 in the community of Columbia in Knowlton Township, Warren County. From this interchange, the route heads southeast along the east bank of the Delaware River as a four-lane divided highway briefly before narrowing into a two-lane undivided road. The road passes through wooded mountainous areas before reaching the community of Delaware. In Delaware, US 46 intersects Route 163, the approach to the former Delaware Bridge, before passing a few commercial establishments. From here, the route continues alongside the river, passing more rural areas of woods and farms with occasional development as it enters White Township. US 46 makes a sharp turn to the east away from the Delaware River, widening into a four-lane divided highway again as it bypasses the town of Belvidere and has a few businesses on it. The road turns back into a two-lane undivided road and comes to a crossroads with CR 519. Past this intersection, US 46 continues through rural sectors with some business before coming to the northern terminus of Route 31.

From this point, the route continues east through dense woods prior to turning northeast into Liberty Township. The road passes through the community of Townsbury before crossing into Independence Township. Here, US 46 enters more agricultural areas and turns east again, with development increasing along the road as it passes through Great Meadows-Vienna. It continues southeast before entering Hackettstown, where the road becomes Main Street. In Hackettstown, the route crosses NJ Transit&#x27;s Morristown Line and Montclair-Boonton Line before coming to an intersection with CR 517. Here, CR 517 forms a concurrency with US 46, and the two routes continue southeast through the downtown area. At the intersection with the northern terminus of Route 182, CR 517 splits from US 46 by heading south on that route while US 46 continues to the east.

===Morris and Essex counties===

Shortly after the Route 182 intersection, the route crosses the Musconetcong River into Washington Township, Morris County, where it heads back into rural surroundings. About a mile into Morris County, US 46 divides and becomes a four-lane highway with a wide median. The road passes a median park and ride lot as it turns north and crosses over a mountain. It continues into Mount Olive Township, taking a sharp turn to the east before the road becomes undivided while remaining four lanes. The road passes rural areas and development as it goes through Budd Lake. In this community, the route passes to the south of the namesake lake as it begins to turn northeast and then north. The road heads northeast again before it enters Netcong and becomes a divided highway as it comes to an interchange with I-80/US 206. Within this interchange, the lanes of US 46 split. From this point, the route narrows back into a two-lane undivided road and runs through developed areas of Netcong a short distance to the south of NJ Transit&#x27;s Morristown Line/Montclair-Boonton Line. US 46 meets Route 183 at an intersection (formerly Netcong Circle) before widening into a four-lane undivided road and leaving Netcong for Roxbury Township. Here, the road passes through wooded areas, meeting I-80 at another interchange and briefly becoming a divided highway at the crossing under I-80 and again at the actual interchange. US 46 remains a divided highway with jughandles past this point, continuing southeast into the Ledgewood area.

At a three-way intersection which was formerly Ledgewood Circle, Route 10 begins straight while US 46 turns left to continue east as a two-lane undivided road through more development, crossing the Dover and Rockaway River Railroad&#x27;s High Bridge Branch. Upon crossing the Dover and Rockaway River Railroad&#x27;s Chester Branch and passing through Kenvil, the road enters Mine Hill Township, where the road becomes three lanes with two westbound lanes and one eastbound lane. The route passes through Wharton at its southern tip before continuing into Dover. US 46 narrows back into two lanes, becoming Blackwell Street as it passes St. Clare&#x27;s Dover General Hospital. The road widens to four lanes as Blackwell Street splits from it at an eastbound exit and westbound entrance prior to a bridge over the Rockaway River and NJ Transit&#x27;s Morristown Line/Montclair-Boonton Line. A short distance later, US 46 intersects the southern terminus of Route 15 and passes over the Dover and Rockaway River Railroad&#x27;s Dover and Rockaway Branch. From here, the route continues on McFarland Street. US 46 continues east, entering Rockaway Township, where there is an intersection with CR 513. Past CR 513, the road narrows to two lanes as it heads northeast through Rockaway Borough before turning east and crossing the Rockaway River and the Dover and Rockaway River Railroad&#x27;s Dover and Rockaway Branch. The route continues northeast, entering wooded residential areas as it heads into Denville and has a limited interchange with I-80, where it can only be entered to and from the westbound lane and where US 46 east can only be entered from the eastbound lane and to the eastbound lane. As it crosses under I-80, US 46 becomes a six-lane divided highway.
The road is lined with a moderate number of businesses, most with right-in/right-out (RIRO) access, as it continues southeast through Denville, narrowing to four lanes before coming to an interchange with Route 53. From this interchange, the route continues east before curving southeast and entering Mountain Lakes. In Mountain Lakes, US 46 crosses under the Montclair-Boonton Line before continuing into Parsippany–Troy Hills. Here, the road comes to US 202/CR 511 before passing under I-287. At this point, the westbound direction of US 46 has a ramp to northbound I-287, with access to and from southbound I-287 provided by US 202. Past the I-287 crossing, the road comes to another partial interchange with I-80 near the western terminus of I-280. Past this interchange, US 46 widens to six lanes and enters Montville. In Montville, the route narrows back to four lanes, and has traffic light-controlled intersections with New Road and Hook Mountain Road/Chapin Road. It then has an interchange with Route 159 and makes a turn to the northeast. Upon crossing the Passaic River at Pine Brook, US 46 enters Essex County into Fairfield Township. A short distance into Essex County, US 46 has another interchange with Route 159 (Clinton Road), providing access to that route and to its continuation as CR 627 (Plymouth Street). Shortly farther along US 46, Route 159 and CR 627 meet it at a traffic light-controlled intersection, providing cross-traffic and turns onto US 46. Past this point, US 46 remains a surface road with RIRO-accessed driveways, but has several intersections controlled by interchanges. Within Fairfield, US 46 has interchanges with Hollywood Avenue and Passaic Avenue as well as two trumpet interchanges providing access to Fairfield Road, which runs a short distance to the south of US 46.

===Passaic County===

The route crosses the Passaic River again into Wayne in Passaic County. The median splits as the road passes to the north of the Willowbrook Mall, with an exit serving the shopping mall, before reaching the Spaghetti Bowl interchange with partial access to I-80 and full access to Route 23. Within this interchange, US 46 passes under the Montclair-Boonton Line again. From here, it passes businesses and many shopping centers with RIRO access as a six-lane highway, heading into Totowa. In this area, the route has interchanges with CR 640 and Route 62/CR 646. The road turns southeast, crossing the Passaic River a third time into Little Falls. At this point, US 46 runs along the Little Falls/Woodland Park border, interchanging with CR 639 and Browertown Road. After the exit for Lower Notch Road, the route enters more wooded surroundings, interchanging with Notch Road/Rifle Camp Road before entering Clifton. Upon reaching Clifton, US 46 has an interchange with the western terminus of Route 3 and Valley Road (CR 621), with the Valley Road exit stitched into the Route 3 side of the highway fork. Prior to reconstruction of the interchanges, the Valley Road ramp exited before Route 3 began, and Route 3 branched off immediately after Valley Road.

Past Route 3, the highway narrows to four lanes, continuing east-northeast as a limited-access divided highway with some RIRO-accessed businesses still on it, though many roads are accessed through over and underpasses. US 46 has an exit for Van Houten Avenue/Grove Street before coming to a large interchange with the southern terminus of the Route 19 freeway, CR 509, and the Garden State Parkway. After this, the road passes over Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Newark Industrial Track line and NJ Transit&#x27;s Main Line and has an exit for Hazel Street/Paulison Avenue. US 46 then begins a brief concurrency with Piaget Avenue in Clifton with a series of connector streets and three intersections controlled by stoplights. After the third, at Day Street near Christopher Columbus Middle School, the two roads split at a fork, marked as an exit, with US 46 continuing eastbound to the left and Piaget Avenue continuing to the right. Vehicles traveling west on Piaget Avenue have access to US 46 westbound through use of a one way underpass that carries US 46 eastbound over it, and also have access to US 46 eastbound by a right-turn only lane near the intersection of Piaget Avenue and Fourth Street.

After the split, US 46 turns into a limited-access road again and passes under Main Avenue/CR 601 and Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Passaic Spur line before coming to an interchange with the northern terminus of the Route 21 freeway. From this interchange, the route turns north along the west bank of the Passaic River, crossing the Garden State Parkway again before widening to six lanes and meeting the southern terminus of Route 20 at an interchange near the border of Paterson.

===Bergen County===

US 46 turns east and crosses the Passaic River a fourth and final time, entering Bergen County in Elmwood Park. Immediately after the river, the route has an interchange for CR 507. Passing through more RIRO-accessed business areas, the road narrows to four lanes and has a partial interchange with the Garden State Parkway. Past the parkway, US 46 continues as a road with some jughandles and other traffic light-controlled intersections (but still largely maintaining RIRO access to driveways and side streets), crossing New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway&#x27;s Dundee Branch line and passing through a small corner of Garfield before crossing into Saddle Brook. Within Saddle Brook, the road turns more to the southeast and crosses over NJ Transit&#x27;s Bergen County Line. Continuing east, US 46 has an exit for with Outwater Lane and crosses into Lodi. Through this area, there is no access across the median of US 46, as it interchanges with Main Street. The route continues into Hasbrouck Heights, where it turns more south-southeast, interchanging with Boulevard. A short distance later, US 46 reaches an interchange with Route 17 and crosses NJ Transit&#x27;s Pascack Valley Line near the Teterboro station.

From here, US 46 enters Teterboro and interchanges with Green Street before continuing southeast as a six-lane highway through industrial areas, passing to the north of Teterboro Airport. The road continues into Little Ferry, where it passes suburban residential and commercial areas and narrows into a four-lane undivided road called Sylvan Avenue, turning to the east and crossing CR 503. After intersecting the Bergen Turnpike at the modified Little Ferry Circle, which US 46 runs through, the route crosses the Hackensack River into Ridgefield Park on the Route 46 Hackensack River Bridge, passing over New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway&#x27;s New Jersey Subdivision line and CSX&#x27;s River Subdivision railroad line before the bridge ends. In Ridgefield Park, the route is called Winant Avenue and becomes a four-lane divided highway before briefly becoming undivided again. Upon turning back into a divided highway, US 46 comes to a large interchange with I-95/New Jersey Turnpike. Past this interchange, the route widens to six lanes and crosses the Overpeck Creek into Ridgefield, where it passes over CSX&#x27;s Northern Running Track railroad line into the Morsemere neighborhood. Upon entering Palisades Park, the road has an interchange with Route 93 before reaching a diamond interchange with US 1-9.
US 46 continues southeast as a four-lane freeway, with the US 1-9 ramps following the route a short distance before merging into the route. At this point, US 1-9 become concurrent with US 46 and the freeway makes a sharp turn to the north-northeast. The road has an interchange to the 5th Street and 6th Street frontage roads, which parallel the freeway through residential areas and provide access to CR 501. US 1-9 / US 46 continue into Fort Lee, where it has access to a couple commercial areas via RIRO before encountering the northern terminus of Route 63 at a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. From here, the highway becomes a surface road that continues past more businesses and homes with RIRO access, angling northeast as it comes to an exit for Main Street. Immediately past this point, the road turns east and encounters a complex interchange with I-95, the eastern terminus of Route 4, and the southern terminus of US 9W. Here, US 1-9 / US 46 all join I-95 (although US 46 is unsigned east of this interchange) and continue to the southeast along a multilane freeway with local-express lane configuration consisting of four local lanes and four express lanes in each direction, passing numerous high-rise buildings. The road has an interchange with Route 67 at GWB Plaza before coming to an interchange for the Palisades Interstate Parkway. After the Palisades Interstate Parkway, the road crosses the Hudson River on the George Washington Bridge, which has eight lanes total on the upper deck (formed from the express lanes) and six lanes total on the lower deck (formed from the local lanes). At the New Jersey/New York border on the bridge, US 46 ends while I-95 and US 1-9 continue into the borough of Manhattan in New York City.

==History==

=== Before 1916 ===
What is now US 46 west of Netcong was part of the Manunkachunk Trail, an old Lenape trail running from the Great Minisink Trail in Netcong west to Manunkachunk Village, now Belvidere. Another Lenape trail extended from Netcong to what is now Parsippany and Springfield Township. In 1809, the Parsippany and Rockaway Turnpike was chartered to extend from the Newark-Pompton Turnpike to the Union Turnpike; the section east from Denville was later named Bloomfield Avenue. A branch of the Union Turnpike was chartered in 1813 to run west from Dover to the Morris Turnpike; it was locally known as the Dover Turnpike. By 1920, the portion of the modern route west of Hackettstown was signed as an easterly extension of the Lackawanna Trail, running through Pennsylvania to Binghamton, New York. This designation was removed by 1924, when the state of Pennsylvania rerouted the highway south to Philadelphia.

===Routes 5, 10 and 12: 1916–1927===

Prior to 1927, what is today US 46 was followed by three different routes. The first route was pre-1927 Route 5, which was first legislated in 1916. It began by crossing the Delaware River from Pennsylvania at the community of Delaware. Several undercrossings of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad near Delaware were bypassed with a short new road on the southwest side of the railroad. From there, Route 5 used the existing Delaware Road to north of Belvidere, then the Buttzville-Belvidere Road to Buttzville, the Buttzville Road to Great Meadows, and the Danville Mountain Road to Hackettstown.

From Hackettstown to Denville, Route 5 ran concurrently with pre-1927 Route 12, which was first legislated in 1917. A mostly-new road (now eastbound US 46) was built from Hackettstown east to Netcong to avoid steep grades on the existing roads. Portions of the existing Budd&#x27;s Lake Road were used between Budd Lake and Netcong. From Netcong the route used the old Morris Turnpike to Ledgewood and the Dover Turnpike to Dover, running into Dover on Blackwell Street. Blackwell Street led to Rockaway Road, becoming Main Street in Rockaway, from which it used the old Parsippany and Rockaway Turnpike to Denville.

At Denville, Route 5 turned south, while Route 12 continued east along the Parsippany and Rockaway Turnpike to Pine Brook. The route left the old turnpike there to head northeast towards Paterson, starting with the Pine Brook Road (now Fairfield Road and Little Falls Road) to Little Falls. A bypass was planned around the south side of Little Falls, taking it under the Erie Railroad at Union Boulevard. From there Route 12 would use Union Boulevard, Totowa Road and McBride Avenue into Paterson. Pre-1927 Route 10, which was legislated in 1917, continued east on Market Street on the other side of Paterson to Edgewater, where it connected to the Fort Lee Ferry across the Hudson River. The new alignments were generally built as planned, except at Little Falls, where a bypass was to be built for Route 12.

===Route 6: 1927–1953===

The expansion of the highway system followed the opening of the George Washington Bridge.

In the 1927 renumbering, Route 6 was assigned to the route across northern New Jersey, using the old Route 5 from Delaware to Netcong, Route 12 from Hackettstown to Paterson, and a generally new alignment parallel to Route 10 from Paterson to the proposed George Washington Bridge; the old Route 10 alignment between Paterson and Edgewater was to become Route 5. In Paterson, Route 6 was marked along McBride Avenue, Spruce Street and Market Street.
Route 6 was redefined in 1929 to use none of the old road east of Paterson (it had formerly been planned to use Market Street west of roughly where Route 17 now crosses it), and Route 5 was cut back to run only east from Ridgefield. The portion of pre-1927 Route 10 that was bypassed by Route 6 was designated Route 10N, but was eventually removed from the state highway system. In addition, Route 6 was redefined to bypass Paterson to the south. The new route would enter Paterson just south of Market Street, but then turn south and southwest before heading back west to rejoin the old route at the east end of the Little Falls bypass at the Union Boulevard crossing. The old road along Union Boulevard towards Paterson was assigned Route S6, as a spur of Route 6. Route S6 became Route 62 in the 1953 renumbering, and has since been truncated to a short piece between US 46 and I-80 in Totowa.
In December 1937, a section of highway was opened from the Passaic River at Clifton to Hasbrouck Heights, marking the completion of Route 6 with the exception of the Paterson bypass. In 1938, a spur of Route 6 called Route 6A was legislated to run from Route 6 in Dover north to US 206/Route S31 in Lafayette Township; this became Route 15 in 1953. A realignment at the Passaic River crossing near Pine Brook was built in the 1940s, along with a new road for a short distance west from Pine Brook. Also in the 1940s, the road was widened west into Denville, and a bypass of downtown Denville, including an interchange at Route 5N (now Route 53) was built. The Route 6 designation was dropped in favor of US 46 in the 1953 renumbering.

By Joint Resolution No. 1, approved April 14, 1941, the New Jersey Legislature designated the highway as the United Spanish War Veterans Memorial Highway in honor of the United Spanish War Veterans.

===U.S. Route 46: 1936–present===

In 1925, the US 46 designation was first proposed for a route in Colorado connecting Grand Junction to Limon, but it instead became US 40S.
The current US 46 was marked in 1936 between Portland, Pennsylvania, and the George Washington Bridge. At the time, the new Route 6 had not been completed from Route 2 (now Route 17) west to Route S6 (now Route 62), and so US 46 was marked through Paterson until this portion was completed by the 1940s. At the west end of Route 6, US 46 continued over the Delaware River on the Delaware Bridge into Pennsylvania, replacing PA 987 north to Portland, where it ended at US 611. The Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge and its associated freeway to Columbia (now I-80) opened in December 1953, as did the new Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge.

Following this, US 611 was rerouted to cross the river twice in order to use the freeway through the Delaware Water Gap, and US 46 was moved to former Route 94 (pre-1953 Route 8) to end at the Columbia, New Jersey side of the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge. The former approaches to the Darlington&#x27;s Bridge, which itself was dismantled by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission in 1954, became Route 163 in New Jersey and State Route 1039 in Pennsylvania. The US 611 freeway was designated I-80 by 1960, and US 611 was moved back to its old all-Pennsylvania alignment in 1965, leaving US 46 to end at I-80 and Route 94.
In 1964, the approach to the George Washington Bridge, shared with US 1-9, was rebuilt into a freeway that became a part of I-95. Since then, many changes have occurred to US 46. A traffic circle served the intersection with Route 23 until the construction of I-80, and a spaghetti interchange was constructed to replace it. The Little Ferry Circle, initially constructed in 1933, was modified in 1985 to allow US 46 to run straight through the circle. In 1998, the Ledgewood Circle at the western terminus of Route 10 was replaced with a signalized T-intersection. In 2007, the NJDOT announced that they would eliminate the Little Ferry Circle by turning it into a straight intersection; work ran through 2014. The Netcong Circle at Route 183 was replaced with a signalized intersection a cost of $13.3 million in 2013. A temporary junction opened in January of that year with the permanent configuration completed the following August. In addition, the interchange between US 46 and the western terminus of Route 3 is planned to be reconstructed. This project will reconfigure ramps, bring bridges up to standard, and will provide for three-lane connections between Route 3 and US 46. It was announced in 2003 and is projected to cost over $250 million. Construction on the first contract began in December 2015 with completion by October 2019. Construction on the second contract began in February 2020.

The Little Ferry Circle was reconstructed in 1985, creating a through road to let Route 46 traffic pass through the circle without causing congestion.

In 1988 the Legislature resolved that &quot;The Commissioner of Transportation shall designate that portion of United States Highway Route 46 located between Hope Road and Barkers Mill Road in the township of Independence, Warren County as &#x27;Clifford Jones Avenue&#x27;,&quot; honoring United States Army Specialist Clifford Jones, Jr., a resident of Independence Township who had been killed in action in 1968 during the Vietnam War.

The Little Ferry Circle was widened in 1998, this involved condemnation of adjacent properties and led to a 73-page court decision.
In March 2007, the New Jersey Department of Transportation proposed its latest plan to address issues at the circle. The plan would realign the circle into a straight intersection, complete with turning lanes; prohibit left turns onto many residential streets; and would include construction of a pump station to move water off the oft-flooded highway and into the Hackensack River.

The circle&#x27;s redesign was completed in 2016. However, according to the Little Ferry police and business owners at the new intersection, car accidents still occur, though they are less deadly than before. The proprietors at the site also claim to have lost a significant amount of business due to reduced accessibility to their establishments, caused by the redesign and loss of the former circle.

<text>Invercargill ( , ) is the southernmost and westernmost city in New Zealand, and one of the southernmost cities in the world. It is the commercial centre of the Southland region. The city lies in the heart of the wide expanse of the Southland Plains to the east of the Ōreti or New River some north of Bluff, which is the southernmost town in the South Island. It sits amid rich farmland that is bordered by large areas of conservation land and marine reserves, including Fiordland National Park covering the south-west corner of the South Island and the Catlins coastal region.

Many streets in the city, especially in the centre and main shopping district, are named after rivers in Scotland. These include the main streets Dee and Tay, as well as those named after the Tweed, Forth, Tyne, Esk, Don, Ness, Yarrow, Spey, Eye and Ythan rivers, amongst others.

The 2018 census showed the population was 54,204, up 2.7% on the 2006 census number and up 4.8% on the 2013 census number.

==Toponymy==
&quot;Inver&quot; comes from the Scottish Gaelic word &quot;inbhir&quot; meaning &quot;a river&#x27;s mouth&quot; and &quot;Cargill&quot; is in honour of Captain William Cargill, who was at the time the Superintendent of Otago, of which Southland was then a part.

The Māori name for the city, , comes from the Waihopai River. It may be a corruption of , meaning (water or stream) of Pai.

==History==

Southland was the scene of early extended contact between Europeans and Māori, notably whalers and missionaries – Wohlers at Ruapuke Island. In 1853, Walter Mantell purchased Murihiku from local Māori iwi, claiming the land for European settlement. Otago, of which Southland was itself part, was the subject of planned settlement by the Free Church of Scotland, an offshoot of the Church of Scotland. Settlement broadened with the discovery of gold in Central Otago in the 1860s. Traces of Scottish speech persist in Southland voices, with R often pronounced with a rolling burr. This is more noticeable among country people.

In 1856, a petition was put forward to Thomas Gore Browne, the Governor of New Zealand, for a port at Bluff. During the Otago gold rush, the region&#x27;s population grew during the 1860s with the settlement of Bluff. Browne agreed to the petition and gave the name Invercargill to the settlement north of the port. The settlement&#x27;s chief surveyor was John Turnbull Thomson, a British civil engineer.

Under the influence of James Menzies, Southland Province (a small part of the present Region, centred on Invercargill) seceded from Otago in 1861 following the escalation of political tensions. However, rising debt forced Southland to rejoin Otago in 1870 and the provincial system, and with it the province of Otago, was abolished entirely in 1876. This debt was caused by a population decline stemming from poor returns from pastoral farming. In 1874, Invercargill&#x27;s population was less than 2,500, which reflected the drift north to large centres. In the 1880s, the development of an export industry based on butter and cheese encouraged the growth of dairy farming in Southland.

On 6 August 1884, a group of women gathered together in the Don Street Primitive Methodist Church to form a local branch of the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union. Eliza Ann Brown, wife of Charles W. Brown (who that same year co-founded the local Independent Order of Rechabites), led the group to establish eight main objectives, which included gathering signatures for a petition for women&#x27;s suffrage. This was the first all-women&#x27;s organisation established in New Zealand. After affiliating with the new national organisation, the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union of New Zealand, under the guidance of world missionary Mary C. Leavitt, Roberta Annie Hinton, wife of the new Baptist minister, led the new club as it worked to strengthen the temperance movement in the area and support the needs of women and children across the nation. By 1897, a founding member of this first branch of the WCTU Invercargill, Mrs. Elizabeth Stephen Baird, led the establishment of the Victoria Home for Friendless Girls.

In December 1905, Invercargill voted in local prohibition of alcohol sales. This lasted for 40 years until voted out by returning servicemen in the Second World War. Drinking continued meanwhile, thanks to hotels and liquor merchants in outlying districts, huge volumes of beer, often in kegs, brought to private homes, or sold by the glass by keggers at hiding spots round the city. When prohibition ended, a committee of citizens persuaded the Government to give the monopoly on liquor sales in Invercargill to the specially formed Invercargill Licensing Trust. Based on a scheme in Carlisle, England, it returns profits to city amenities. Even today, alcohol is not sold in supermarkets.

Publicity has been brought to the city by the election of Tim Shadbolt, a colourful and outspoken former student activist and former mayor of Waitemata City, as mayor. He once appeared in a cheese advertisement stating &quot;I don&#x27;t mind where, as long as I&#x27;m Mayor&quot;. His supporters like the colour he brings to the city. His opponents refer to his controversial mayoral career in the Auckland suburbs and to his attitude to veterans during his opposition to the Vietnam War. Publicity and students have also come to the city by the Southern Institute of Technology&#x27;s &quot;Zero Fees&quot; scheme, which allows New Zealand citizens and permanent residents to study while only paying for material costs of their study, and not tuition fees.

==Geography==

Invercargill is the southernmost city in the Commonwealth of Nations. Invercargill is situated on the fertile and alluvial Southland Plains, which is amongst some of New Zealand&#x27;s most fertile farmland. Southern Invercargill lies on the shore of the New River Estuary, while the northern parts lie on the banks of the Waihopai River. A tributary of the Waihopai is the Otepuni Stream or Creek, which flows from east to west through the city, through Otepuni Gardens, and under the railway yards. 10 kilometres west of the city centre lies Oreti Beach, a long expanse of sand stretching from the Sandy Point area to nearby Riverton.

Invercargill has a temperate oceanic climate. The mean daily temperature ranges from in July to in January. The yearly mean temperature is . Rainfall averages annually, and measurable snowfall is occasionally seen during the winter months of June to September. It ties with neighbouring Dunedin as the cloudiest city in New Zealand, with only 1,680 hours of sunshine per annum. Despite its cloudiness, and a relatively high frequency of rainy days, Invercargill receives less rain than either Auckland or Wellington. Invercargill is also New Zealand&#x27;s second-windiest city, after Wellington.

===Climate===
The average temperature high ranges from in January to in July, but temperatures do occasionally exceed in summer. Invercargill&#x27;s hottest temperature on record was , recorded on 2 January 1948. Extended periods of heat are rare; however, January 2018 was notable for the city recording three consecutive days above 30 for the first time in its recorded history, peaking with the city&#x27;s second-highest temperature on record of on 14 January 2018. Like other urban areas in New Zealand, Invercargill sometimes experiences an urban heat island effect; temperatures are slightly higher within the inner-city regions compared to the surrounding countryside. This is typically between 1-2°C and depends on factors like wind speed and cloud cover. Owing to its relatively high latitude (46° 24′), the city enjoys nearly 16 hours of daylight at the summer solstice in late December, with astronomical night lasting as little as 2.5 hours. Conversely, the city receives only around 8.5 hours of daylight at the winter solstice in late June.

Invercargill is the &quot;City of Water and Light&quot;. The &quot;light&quot; refers to the long summer twilights and the aurora australis (southern lights). The &quot;water&quot; reference, humorists suggest, comes from notorious horizontal, driving rain in high wind at the corner of the two main streets, Dee and Tay. A recent sign also states, &quot;Invercargill, where dreams can come true&quot; with an image from the 2005 film &quot;The World&#x27;s Fastest Indian&quot;.

In September 2010, Invercargill&#x27;s heaviest snowfall in living memory heralded a run of unseasonably cold weather. A few buildings were damaged, notably Stadium Southland, the roof of which collapsed under the weight of the snow; and a decorating store. Many other stores were shut, and Invercargill Airport was closed for a day. Invercargill is one of four places in New Zealand where weather balloons are regularly launched for MetService.

==Government==

===Local===

The Invercargill City Council governs the territorial authority of Invercargill. It is made up of an elected mayor and 12 additional councillors. They are elected under the First Past the Post system in triennial elections, with the last election being held in 2022. The current mayor is Nobby Clark.

===National===
The electorate of Invercargill in the New Zealand Parliament is held by Penny Simmonds, a Member of Parliament and Minister from the government party National Party. Under the Māori electorates system, Invercargill is part of the large Te Tai Tonga electorate, which covers the entire South Island and the surrounding islands, and is currently held by the Te Pāti Māori MP Tākuta Ferris.

==Economy==
Invercargill is home to the Southern Institute of Technology, which has introduced a zero-fees scheme. The scheme was partly responsible for rejuvenating the city when it was in a steady state of population decline. However the major factor in Invercargill&#x27;s regrowth is the dairy industrial boom of the 2000s (decade) due to an increased demand for New Zealand milk, cheese and butter. New dairy factories have opened around the Southland Region, as well as more efficient meat processing works and research and development facilities.

===Liquor licensing trusts===
The Invercargill Licensing Trust is one of several trusts in the city of Invercargill. The Invercargill Licensing Trust and the ILT Foundation are major funders of community projects in Invercargill. The ILT Foundation provides donations and grants totalling around $10 million a year to over 500 organisations. The trust has also been influential in the development of city facilities such as the ILT Stadium Southland and Invercargill Velodrome. The trust are also big-time backers of local sporting franchises the Southern Steel, Southland Sharks and Southland Stags.

The Community Trust of Southland was established after Westpac bought out the Trust Bank Southland in the late 1990s. It was sold for approximately $150 million, with those funds now being set aside for the people of the Southland regions, including Queenstown, Arrowtown and Tapanui. It is widely recognised as one of New Zealand&#x27;s leading community trusts, with the benefit of a large capital base for a relatively small population. Consequently, the Trust provides significant funding to a wide range of projects and programmes. Each year, it distributes between $7 and $10 million in the region, not including the large sums given to sports franchises and building projects and since its inception has distributed close to $140 million in grants. 

===Brewing===
Invercargill was home to Invercargill Brewery, the southernmost manufacturer of beer in New Zealand. Established in 1999, it was an internationally award-winning production brewery which also contract brews for other iconic New Zealand breweries, including Yeastie Boys. The company went into receivership in 2018.

===Tourism===
Invercargill is on the Southern Scenic Route (tourist road), allowing day trips to Queenstown, Stewart Island, Dunedin, Te Anau and Fiordland, and has a growing tourism sector in the city itself. Transport-themed attractions include the E Hayes and Sons hardware store that features Burt Munro&#x27;s original motorcycle, the Bill Richardson Transport World, Classic Motorcycle Mecca, and Dig This.

===Banking===
SBS Bank, or the Southland Building Society, is a New Zealand-based financial institution that traces its roots back to 1869. Originally established as a building society in Invercargill by James Walker Bain to help local communities achieve their financial goals, SBS Bank has evolved into a full-service bank offering a wide range of banking and financial products. With its headquarters in Invercargill.

==Culture==

Murihiku Marae is located in Invercargill. It is a &quot;marae&quot; (meeting ground) of the Waihōpai Rūnanga branch of Ngāi Tahu, and includes Te Rakitauneke &quot;wharenui&quot; (meeting house).

During the late 1880s a small periodical called &quot;Literary Southland&quot; contained stories as well as memoirs of the pioneering days of the region. The publication was distributed from a store in the northern end of Invercargill. While largely forgotten today, it was considered relatively popular at the time, if at times controversial.

==Sport==

The Southern Sting (Netball- Now Southern Steel) won seven National titles from 1999 to 2004, 2007, while the local rugby team the Southland Stags held the Ranfurly Shield from 22 October 2009 to 9 October 2010 and have made the NPC Semi-finals for the past three years. Southland also has one of the highest percentages of sports participants in the country, with codes such as rugby union, netball, basketball, cricket, and hockey being popular. Many professional sportsmen too, have come out of Southland as well. Invercargill also has some high quality sporting facilities, including an indoor velodrome, an Olympic sized swimming centre, a 20,000 capacity rugby stadium and also international playing arenas for both hockey and cricket. The city&#x27;s 4500 capacity indoor stadium was severely damaged in 2010, its roof collapsing following a heavy snowfall. Southland also has four professional sporting sides that are based in Invercargill:
* Southland Stags (Rugby)
* Spirit FC (Association Football)
* Southern Steel (Netball)
* Southland Sharks (Basketball)

Invercargill is home to the only indoor cycling velodrome in the South Island. The indoor 250 metres wooden velodrome is home to Track Cycling in Southland. The Invercargill Licensing Trust supports the velodrome which is situated at Stadium Southland, a large indoor sports complex located at Surrey Park.

For horse racing aficionados there is a racecourse in the aptly named Racecourse Road, on the east side of the city.

Two motorcycle speedway tracks are located within 1 kilometre of each other, and 10 kilometres west from the centre of the city by Oreti Beach. The Oreti Park Speedway and the Riverside Speedway both host important events, the former has held qualifying rounds of the Speedway World Championship in 1976 and 1983 and the New Zealand Solo Championship six times.

==Music==
The &quot;Invercargill March&quot;, an internationally famous tune, was written by Alex Lithgow, who attended Invercargill Grammar School (now Middle School). In his book &quot;Invercargill – 150 Years&quot;, Lloyd Esler&#x27;s opening sentence reads, &quot;Invercargill was done a fine favour by Alex Lithgow who named his famous march after his boyhood home. The Invercargill March is possibly the best advertisement the town has ever had as the work is a brass-band favourite and the word &#x27;Invercargill&#x27; is whispered amongst audiences worldwide. There is only one Invercargill in the world – this one&quot;.

When Invercargill hosted the national brass band contest in 1909, Alex&#x27;s brother Tom asked for a test piece for the contest and Alex offered this piece to the city. On the music he wrote,
==Education==

<doc id="266755" wikidata="Q826877" url="?curid=266755" title="New Jersey Route 161">
<text>Route 161 is a state highway in Clifton, New Jersey, United States, running along Clifton Avenue between Allwood Road (County Route 602 or CR 602) and Van Houten Avenue (CR 614). Although it is a signed state highway, it does not connect to any other state-maintained roadways. However, the south terminus is aligned just northeast of the interchange of Route 3 and the Garden State Parkway (interchange 153). The highway originated as Route S3 Spur, a suffixed spur of State Highway Route 3 to State Highway Route 6 (currently U.S. Route 46 or US 46). The route was redesignated in 1953 as Route 161, though in one late 1950s Essex County Hagstrom map and in the NJ highway code for mid-block crosswalks the highway is shown as Route 61. It is unknown whether Route 61 existed.

==Route description==

Route 161 begins at the intersection of Clifton Avenue and Allwood Road (CR 602) in Clifton. The route passes a park and large commercial building at the southern terminus. A short distance after, Route 161 provides a connector to Richfield Terrace on the northbound side of the highway, the park&#x27;s divider known as Cross Street. The highway continues northward, intersecting with Richland Court, which provides access to local residential homes. The next intersection is with Joan Place, which serves a similar function to Richland Court. Soon after, Route 161 intersects with Saint Andrew&#x27;s Boulevard, which also serves as the northern terminus of Richfield Terrace and connects the highway with CR 609 (Mount Prospect Avenue). Just past Saint Andrew&#x27;s Boulevard Route 161 passes through a largely commercial section of Clifton with a heavy concentration of medical offices before terminating at an intersection with CR 614 (Van Houten Avenue). The right-of-way of Route 161 continues as CR 611 (Clifton Avenue) towards downtown Clifton.

==History==
Route S3 was defined in 1929 to run from Route 3 in East Rutherford west to Route 6 (US 46) in Clifton, (this is now part of Route 3). In 1942, the state took over the alignment and made it an unnumbered state highway was defined to run from the intersection of Clifton Avenue and Van Houten Avenue southwest to Route S3, which then ran along Allwood Road. World War II delayed completion of Route S3 long enough for an alternate freeway route to be selected, and the part of Allwood Road that was taken over is no longer a state highway. In 1948, the route was assigned the number Route S3 Spur. The number was changed to Route 161 in the 1953 state highway renumbering, and ever since then it has remained an isolated state highway.

<text>Route 162 is an unsigned long state highway in Lower Township, New Jersey, United States. The highway&#x27;s designation consists entirely of a bridge on Seashore Road (County Route 626 or CR 626), which is known as Relocated Seashore Road. The southern terminus of the highway is an intersection with County Routes 641 and 626 in Lower Township. After crossing the Cape May Canal, Route 162 terminates at an intersection with County Routes 603 and 626 in Lower Township. Route 162 and County Route 626 date back to the 1850s, when local businessmen and county financial Richard Holmes put together the Cape May Turnpike. The turnpike was chartered in 1854, but construction did not begin until 1857, with completion in April of the next year. The turnpike however, caused a lot of controversy, and struggled to live. For many years, railroads were proposed, becoming possible competition for Holmes, who did not appreciate the idea. The railroad was constructed in 1863, just nine years after the charter of the turnpike syndicate.

Route S4C was designated by the New Jersey Legislature in 1929 as a spur of Route 4 (now U.S. Route 9), beginning at Bennett and running south on Seashore Road and Broadway, past Sunset Boulevard to the Delaware Bay. Route S4C was never taken over by the state. However, when the United States Army Corps of Engineers built the Cape May Canal during World War II, Seashore Road was chosen as one of two roads to cross the canal. (The other was Route 4, now Route 109). The Army Corps built a low level bridge close to the pre-canal alignment. The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) built a higher bridge in 1971 on a new alignment.

== History ==

=== The Cape May Turnpike: the precedent to Seashore Road ===

Before 1854, the area based around Bridgeton was a strong business and legal section in Cape May County. The local residents there, however, wanted to have a strong banking industry, but a local named Richard Holmes along with several other locals turned to the strong type of enterprise, a turnpike company. Holmes and the locals began a local turnpike syndicate with other businessmen and began the Cape May Turnpike Company upon incorporation in 1854. The turnpike company, upon incorporation, was to build a toll road along roughly the U.S. Route 9 corridor. Progress in constructing the toll road was slow at first, with subscribers from Cape May County being hesitant to buy stock from the turnpike company. A friend of Richard Holmes, Wilmon Whilldin, owned a steamboat company in Cape May and apologized for not buying stock in the company. Citing the Panic of 1857 made it hard to convert securities to cash, Whilldin suggested that a steamboat would be more profitable than the turnpike. The money from the steamboat would go ahead and helped the financially depressed businesses in local communities.
Although local business owners and land owners held out hope that the turnpike company would pay off, the turnpike experienced problems. Richard Holmes and Henry Swain, the director of the turnpike company, were running into problems including failure to buy land from Elijah Hand&#x27;s pasture and Samuel Hoffman&#x27;s local residence for the turnpike route, because they kept land prices high. The farmers refused to the sell their rightful land, and locals started showing opposition due to the fact it would cost money to deliver important foods. One of those locals, John Tomlin from Goshen, soon after brought up the idea of the &quot;Shunpike&quot; – a free turnpike road to the west of the Cape May Turnpike. However, the turnpike company kept pushing forward, persuading Hand and Hoffman to sell land in 1857 and erecting two tollhouses in the route, one at the Court House (now Cape May Court House) and one near Cold Spring. Eventually, locals finally began to move towards support of the turnpike. In April 1858, John Wiley, who helped persuade Hand and Hoffman to sell, announced that in three weeks, the route would be complete as one continuous road from Cape Island to Cape May Court House.

After completion of the turnpike in April–May 1858, the Cape May Turnpike did not receive much profits. Even with tolls being collected and stock being bought, these could not offset the costs of repairs and maintenance. The roadbed was commonly washed away in storms and it was becoming a less used route as the &quot;Shunpike&quot; (now Route 162/County Route 626) nearby was free to use, taking away traffic from the turnpike. Walters Miller, a big investor of the turnpike company, decided to leave the syndicate in favor of working towards railroads. Miller himself looked into the construction of railroads in the area, hiring William Cook, who engineered the Camden and Amboy Railroad into producing routes along the peninsula. Cook proposed three routes in 1852, one from the Camden waterfront to Cape May economic region, one through Millville and Bridgeton and a third through Salem. Although the rights for a railroad in the area by the New Jersey General Assembly had been allowed since 1832, there has been no progress on any railroad in Cape May County until 1863. That year, progress started on constructing the Camden and Atlantic Railroad using the first proposal by Cook in 1852. Jonathan Pitney of Absecon spent two years trying to obtain the charter from the General Assembly. In a letter to Richard Holmes, Pitney said the chances of getting the railroad charter and building it were &quot;good&quot;. Holmes, however, was cautious towards the railroad company investment, showing little thought of having a railroad created that would compete with his struggling turnpike syndicate.

Businessmen in Cape May County believed the economy in the area was still unstable for quite an engineering project. An adviser to Richard Holmes suggested to be careful on future investments that he would take, including investing into the railroad company. The adviser believed that it would be &quot;bad policy&quot; to make such decisions. Debate continued about the railroad line for at least a decade, and the heads of the Camden and Atlantic Railroad put forth a proposal to build a portion of railroad from Absecon to Cape May along the Tuckahoe River. After attempts to revive the railroad were attempted by several other companies (including the Glassboro and Millville Railroad), the attempts failed. An eventual formation of the Cape May and Millville Railroad in 1860 pushed forward more proposals, and a railroad was constructed in 1863 (and leased in 1869), and the alignment of Seashore Road became part of a stagecoach route from Cold Spring to Cape Island.

=== Route S4C and construction of Route 162 ===

In 1929, a route from the Delaware Bay just short of Sunset Boulevard (the former Cape Island Turnpike) northward to U.S. Route 9 at Bennett Station via Broadway and Seashore Road was designated in the state legislature as State Highway Route S4C. The route was designated along County Route 626&#x27;s length along with County Route 604 as a county-maintained highway, remaining the same until January 1, 1953. On that day, State Highway Route S4C was decommissioned during the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. No number was designated to replace the highway&#x27;s former number.

During the 1930s and 1940s, the proposal for a canal to supply ships with an evacuation route from Germany&#x27;s U-boats in World War II along with dangerous shoals of the Delaware Bay came forward. The canal, now the Cape May Canal, was approved in 1941 and was constructed in 1942 to supply this need along with a strong usage by yachts. By 1944, a bridge was constructed across the canal, which was replaced in 1971. That year, the state built a brand new bridge and denoted it as Relocated Seashore Road, a long steel girder bridge over the Canal. The bridge was built south of U.S. Route 9 and has stood since and received the designation of Route 162 upon completion.
== Route description ==

At the intersection with Bridge Road and CR 641, Route 162 officially begins though the county maintains the state numbered alignment of the road from this intersection to the beginning of the Relocated Seashore Road Bridge. The route heads northward from CR 641, paralleling both roads as it heads up the bridge approach and following the shoreline. From there, Route 162 reaches the Cape May Canal, crossing on the two-lane Relocated Seashore Road Bridge for a short distance. NJDOT maintains the bridge itself but once the route returns to land on the other side of the canal, county maintenance resumes. More farms and residences can be seen from the northern approach of the bridge. Route 162 curves to the northwest, intersecting with Seashore Road (CR 603). At that intersection, Route 162 ends but Seashore Road continues once again as CR 626.

<doc id="266762" wikidata="Q935068" url="?curid=266762" title="Foetus (band)">
<text>Foetus is a solo musical project of Australian musician JG Thirlwell. The project has had many similar names, each including the word &#x27;Foetus&#x27;. The &quot;members&quot; of the project are aliases of Thirlwell; they include Frank Want, Phillip Toss, and Clint Ruin. Thirlwell occasionally collaborates with other artists, but does not consider them to be members of Foetus.

In 1981, after the breakup of PragVEC, Thirlwell started his own solo music project under the name of &#x27;Foetus Under Glass&#x27;. After the album &quot;Thaw&quot;, Thirlwell stopped changing the name; thereafter it remained simply &#x27;Foetus&#x27;.

In November 1983, Foetus undertook a tour with Marc Almond, Nick Cave and Lydia Lunch in the quickly dissolved &#x27;partnership&#x27; known as The Immaculate Consumptive. He has also appeared on albums recorded by The The, Einsturzende Neubauten, Nurse With Wound and Anne Hogan.

In October 1985, Thirlwell made the album &quot;Nail&quot;, which became the most popular Foetus album of all time. 

&quot;Gash&quot; was issued in 1995, which led to acknowledgment from music journalists of Foetus&#x27;s role in the development of industrial music.

==Discography==


==Conceptual themes==
All full-length Foetus album titles are four-letter, one-syllable words, often with multiple connotations.

The artwork of Foetus releases shows a deliberate progression of colour: the earliest releases are black-and-white, with the addition of red on the &quot;Deaf&quot; album, and further addition of yellow on &quot;Nail&quot;. Full-colour art was introduced on &quot;Gash&quot;. Beginning with &quot;Flow&quot;, the artwork of primary albums reverted to black/white/red, although other releases continue in full colour.

<doc id="266765" wikidata="Q5223962" url="?curid=266765" title="Darlington's Bridge at Delaware Station">
<text>The Darlington&#x27;s Bridge at Delaware Station was a highway bridge that spanned the Delaware River in the community of Delaware, New Jersey (known locally as Delaware Station).

A railroad bridge built by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in 1871 to replace an earlier 1855 timber span, this bridge was sold off when a new bridge was erected upstream. Henry V. Darlington, an Episcopal minister in Delaware and nearby Belvidere offered to buy the second-hand bridge for $5,000 (1914 USD, equal to $ today). Darlington converted it into a highway bridge, using two fired members of the nearby Meyer&#x27;s Ferry to be toll collectors.

The use of this bridge subsequently increased; as a result, it became part of State Highway Route 6 in 1927 and U.S. Route 46 in 1936. In 1932, during the massive state takeover of bridges by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, Darlington refused buyout offers, bargaining his way up to $275,000 (1932 USD, equal to $ today) before accepting the sale. This amount was far greater than the sale prices of the nearby Belvidere-Riverton and Portland-Columbia Covered Bridge, which were accepted for $60,000 (equal to $ today) and $50,000 (equal to $ today) respectively.

Around that same time, tolls on this bridge and Route 6 were eliminated, and the bridge continued to operate toll-free for twenty-one years, until the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge was erected upstream at Columbia. The Commission finally ceased operations on the Darlington Bridge on April 3, 1954, and the bridge was immediately demolished.

== History ==
=== Railroad bridge ===
As expansion of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&amp;W) continued westward from Hoboken, the railroad company saw the need to build a new bridge over the Delaware River. Reaching the community of Delaware (named after the river nearby), DL&amp;W built a train station previously in the community, denoted as Delaware Station. The new wood bridge was constructed on the railroad mainline during 1855. The structure lasted a short time, until DL&amp;W replaced the wooden crossing for a new long iron bridge. The new bridge had two tracks to cross the river, serving the local area with coal cars and boxcars crossing. The new bridge survived the floods in 1903 that destroyed many bridges (including the nearby Riverton-Belvidere Bridge) along the Delaware and continued to prosper.

However, as trains, cars and locomotives began to get heavier and larger, the DL&amp;W needed to build a new bridge across the river to support the heavier weights. In 1902, they built the new bridge just upstream for the reason that it would not have to move much track for better service. As soon as the new bridge was finished, DL&amp;W put the former one up for sale. Demand for second-hand bridges were not high at the time, and when Henry V.B. Darlington, a local Episcopal minister, put up an offer of $5,000 (1902 USD) for the bridge, DL&amp;W immediately took the money. The railroad did not check on the background of Reverend Darlington or asked what he wanted to do with the iron structure. His money was &quot;as good as anybody&#x27;s&quot;, according to DL&amp;W.

=== Henry Darlington&#x27;s ownership ===

After Darlington bought the railroad bridge from the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad he took out the tracks, replacing them with a paved roadway. Darlington knew the automobile was becoming a big entity in the 1910s and 1920s, turning the bridge into a vehicular bridge was an important decision to make the most out of the crossing. He also figured that the bridge would make a good approach for drivers coming to visit the local natural attractions, such as the Delaware Water Gap and the Pocono Mountains. Darlington created new roadway approaches (Lackawanna Road and Ferry Lane) to the bridge and even two buildings on the New Jersey side of the span. One building was for toll collecting while the other was for living quarters. These quarters were soon occupied by Edward McCracken and his wife. McCracken and his wife had come from the Meyer&#x27;s Ferry, a local ferry service running at that point on the Delaware since the early 18th century. McCracken had been the local ferry operator, but when a large accident occurred during a dinner break killed four passengers, the owner put the ferry under his control and later fired McCracken. Klein later sold the ferry, which Darlington bought and shut down. He immediately hired the McCrackens to work as the toll collectors.

In the meantime, the only other bridge across the Delaware River easily accessible for vehicular use was the covered bridge in Columbia, New Jersey and Portland, Pennsylvania. Drivers heading along the local roads (later designated as State Highway Route 5), often came to Darlington&#x27;s Bridge first. The McCrackens collected tolls in large bushel baskets, which were often filled to the brim of quarters and half-dollars. Locals said that the McCrackens were sometimes spotted dropping these coins off the bridge and into the river below, although swimmers were never able to find anything of value to support the myth. Even though the bridge made a large sum of a money and the tollhouse was often filled with money, the place was never robbed. Two Airedales the McCrackens kept in the tollhouse, named Duke and Totsey, helped keep the place clear from thieves.

In the time of the bridge prospering, Reverend Darlington was wed to Dorothy Stone Smith at the Trinity Chapel in Newark. The wedding, which occurred in November 1920, made the local news and the ceremony was performed by Darlington&#x27;s father. Two years later, the Darlingtons made the news again, this time with the birth of their first child (a son) in Orange, New Jersey at Orange Memorial Hospital.

=== Buyout and dismantling ===
The bridge continued to prosper through the 1920s and 1930s with a toll of one quarter to cross the bridge, with drivers of State Highway Route 6 coming along the bridge from the junction with State Highway Route 8 coming across the bridge since 1927. During the 1920s and 1930s, the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to buy out bridges along the Delaware River under the Joint Commission for the Elimination of Toll Bridges. The reconstructed bridge at Belvidere was bought by the commission for $60,000 (1920s USD) and the covered bridge at Columbia for only $50,000. Although the commission tried to buy the second-hand railroad bridge for a lower, unspecified amount, Darlington refused, raising the amount to $275,000. Once the bridge was brought, tolls were eliminated.

Although the bridge remained in service for another 21 years as a free crossing, the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission constructed a brand new bridge at the Portland-Columbia. The new toll bridge was constructed in 1953 for $4 million (1953 USD, equal to $ today), but the toll was only one quarter (equal to $ today), like the former price of the Darlington&#x27;s Bridge. Darlington, who had retired from his job in Orange in 1950, was alive and was in disbelief. The next April, the Toll Bridge Commission went ahead and dismantled the Darlington&#x27;s bridge, which was fought by several legal actions. The bridge ceased operations on April 3, 1954, being demolished soon after. The covered bridge at Columbia was destroyed during Hurricane Diane the next August. Just before the demolishing of Darlington&#x27;s Bridge, the approach on the New Jersey side had been renumbered to State Highway Route 163, which remains in condition from when the bridge was in use.

<text>The Macintosh LC is a family of personal computers designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from 1990 to 1997.

Introduced alongside the Macintosh IIsi and Macintosh Classic as part of a new wave of lower-priced Macintosh computers, the LC offered the same overall performance as the Macintosh II for half the price. Part of Apple&#x27;s goal was to produce a machine that could be sold to school boards for the same price as an Apple II,
 a machine that was very successful in the education market. Not long after the Apple IIe Card was introduced for the LC, Apple officially announced the retirement of the II, as the company wanted to focus its sales and marketing efforts on the LC.

The original Macintosh LC was introduced in October 1990, with updates in the form of the LC II and LC III in 1992 and early 1993. These early models all shared the same pizza box form factor, and were joined by the Macintosh LC 500 series of all-in-one desktop machines in mid-1993. A total of twelve different LC models were produced by the company, the last of which, the Power Macintosh 5300 LC, was on sale until early 1997.

== Overview ==

After Apple co-founder Steve Jobs left Apple in 1985, product development was handed to Jean-Louis Gassée, formerly manager of Apple France. Gassée consistently pushed the Apple product line in two directions, towards more &quot;openness&quot; in terms of expandability and interoperability, and towards higher price. Gassée long argued that Apple should not market their computers towards the low end of the market, where profits were thin, but instead concentrate on the high end and higher profit margins. He illustrated the concept using a graph showing the price/performance ratio of computers with low-power, low-cost machines in the lower left and high-power high-cost machines in the upper right. The &quot;high-right&quot; goal became a mantra among the upper management, who said &quot;fifty-five or die&quot;, referring to Gassée&#x27;s goal of a 55 percent profit margin.

This policy led to a series of ever more expensive computers. This was in spite of strenuous objections within the company, and when a group at Claris started a low-end Mac project called &quot;Drama&quot;, Gassée actively killed it. Elsewhere at the company, two engineers, H.L. Cheung and Paul Baker, had been working in secret on a pet project, a color Macintosh prototype they called &quot;Spin&quot;. The idea was to produce a low-cost system in the vein of the Apple II, a product that Cheung had previously worked on at Apple as the head of design. The machine would, in effect, be a significantly smaller Macintosh II with built-in video, no NuBus expansion, and a matching RGB monitor similar to the one introduced with the Apple IIGS the year prior. The project changed direction during development, with executives dictating that the machine should have video capabilities and processing power similar to the Macintosh IIci, which was also under development at the time. In early 1989, the prototype was shown Apple executives, who liked the project but felt it was not different enough from existing models to justify further effort, and the project was shut down.

Around the same time, Apple CEO John Sculley was facing public scrutiny for declining sales that was blamed in large part on the company&#x27;s lack of an inexpensive Macintosh computer. Amidst promises to the press and investors that a new low-cost Macintosh was on the way, he revived the Spin project with the goal of creating the lowest-priced Macintosh that was possible. Gassée pleaded with the team to keep color as a feature of the project, and from then on the product was known internally by a new code name, &quot;Elsie&quot;, a homonym for the &quot;LC&quot; (i.e. low-cost color) name the computer would later be sold as. Elsie prototypes at this point resembled an Apple IIc where the keyboard was integrated into the unit, and it had a single 800 KB floppy drive with no hard drive. The team ended up with a problem — the machine was cheap, but it wasn&#x27;t a good computer, especially because the 68000 CPU was not powerful enough to display color graphics with acceptable performance.

By April 1989, it was decided to split the project into three computers—the Macintosh IIsi, which would have the more powerful 68030 CPU; the Macintosh Classic, which would use a black &amp; white display, and the LC, which would use the 68020 CPU from the Macintosh II.
To keep the price down, Apple cut some corners on performance and features, and redesigned components to be less expensive. For example, the external floppy connector that was included on the IIsi and Classic was excluded from the LC, as it would save a couple of dollars for the connector. The integrated keyboard had also been dropped by this point; it was replaced with a newly designed keyboard called the Apple Keyboard II.

=== Market ===
The Macintosh LC was introduced to the market alongside the Macintosh Classic (a repackaging of the older Macintosh Plus) and the Macintosh IIsi (a new entry-level machine for the Macintosh II series). Due to pent-up demand for a low-cost color Macintosh, the LC was a strong seller, and in 1992, the original Macintosh LC was succeeded by the LC II. The updated machine replaced the LC&#x27;s Motorola 68020 processor with a 68030 and increased the soldered memory to 4 MB to make it more suitable for System 7. However, it retained the original LC&#x27;s 16-bit system bus and 10 MB RAM limit (if 4 MB SIMMs was used, the extra 2 MB of RAM would be inaccessible), making its performance roughly the same as the earlier model. The main benefit of the 030 processor in the LC II was the ability to use System 7&#x27;s virtual memory feature. In spite of this, the new model sold even better than the LC.

In early 1993, Apple introduced the LC III, which used a 25 MHz version of the 68030 and had a higher memory limit of 36 MB, instead of the 10 MB of the LC and LC II. The LC III spawned a whole series of LC models, most of which later were sold both with the LC name to the education world and to consumers via traditional Apple dealers, and as Performa to the consumer market via electronics stores, and department stores such as Sears. (For example, the LC 475 was also known as the Performa 475.) The last official &quot;LC&quot; was the Power Macintosh 5300/100 LC, which was released in August 1995 and discontinued in April 1996. The LC 580 was notable for being the last desktop 680x0-based Macintosh.

===Expansion to all-in-one market===
In mid-1993, Apple introduced the Macintosh LC 520, which combined the traditional all-in-one form factor popularized by the compact Macintosh family, with the technology platform of the LC III. It became Apple&#x27;s mainstream education-market Macintosh, featuring a built-in 14&quot; CRT display, CD-ROM drive, and stereo speakers. The case is similar to the recently introduced Macintosh Color Classic, but considerably larger and heavier due to its larger screen and a bulging midsection to house the larger electronics.

Four LC 500-series models were released over the next two years, the 520, 550, 575, and 580, with the 520 and 550 both using different speeds of the Motorola 68030, and the 575 and 580 sharing the 33 MHz Motorola 68LC040 processor but differing on the rest of the hardware. All of these computers were also sold to the consumer market through department stores under the Macintosh Performa brand, with similar model numbers. The LC models, in particular, became very popular in schools for their small footprint, lack of cable clutter, and durability. Apple also released the Macintosh TV, a variant of the LC/Performa 520 that, while not branded as an LC, uses a black-coloured version of the LC 520&#x27;s case, a logic board similar to the LC 550 and a TV tuner card. The compact Color Classic series shares many components, and is able to swap logic boards, with the early 500 series machines.

The Power Macintosh 5200 LC was introduced in April 1995 with a PowerPC 603 CPU at 75 MHz as a PowerPC-based replacement of the LC 500 series. In August, the Power Macintosh 5300 LC was released which kept the same motherboard design but included a more powerful PowerPC 603e CPU, as well as a &quot;Director&#x27;s Edition&quot; with similar design and features to the Macintosh TV. Unlike previous education models, which prepended the model number with &quot;LC&quot;, the 5200 / 5300 models use the Power Macintosh designation of Apple&#x27;s main workstation line of the time, with &quot;LC&quot; appended to the end.

The 5300 LC is the final model branded as an &quot;LC&quot; and was on sale until early 1997. Its replacement was the Power Macintosh 5500, which continued the practice of building education-specific models but without distinctive branding (except for the UK-only Power Macintosh ONE/225). The company did not produce another education model with its own brand name until the eMac in 2002.

<doc id="266804" wikidata="Q1369399" url="?curid=266804" title="Palo Duro Canyon">
<text>Palo Duro Canyon is a canyon system of the Caprock Escarpment located in the Texas Panhandle near the cities of Amarillo and Canyon. The second largest canyon system in the United States, it is roughly long and has an average width of , but reaches a width of at places. Its depth is around , but in some locations, valley bottom to surrounding hills increases to . Palo Duro Canyon (from the Spanish meaning &quot;hard stick&quot;) has been named &quot;The Grand Canyon of Texas&quot; both for its size and for its dramatic geological features, including the multicolored layers of rock and steep mesa walls, which are similar to those in the Grand Canyon. It is part of Palo Duro Canyon State Park. The State Park had 442,242 visitors in 2022.

==Geology==

The canyon was formed by the Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River, which initially winds along the level surface of the Llano Estacado of West Texas, then suddenly and dramatically runs off the Caprock Escarpment. Water erosion over the millennia has shaped the canyon&#x27;s geological formations.

Notable canyon formations include caves and hoodoos. One of the best-known and the major signature feature of the canyon is the Lighthouse Rock. A multiple-use, round-trip loop trail is dedicated to the formation.
Palo Duro Canyon was downcut by the Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River during the Pleistocene, when the whole region was uplifted. Most of the strata visible in the canyon were deposited during the Permian and Triassic periods. From oldest to youngest, and each separated by an unconformity, the formations are:

The Quartermaster Formation is Permian in age, and forms the red, lower slopes of the Canyon. This layer was deposited in a near-shore shallow-marine environment consisting of siltstones and shales with ripple marks and cross bedding, that alternated with dry tidal flats indicated by satin spar gypsum and halite cast evaporite deposits. The red color indicates periods of oxidation. The Quartermaster Formation forms the lower wall and canyon floor, averaging in thickness where it outcrops. In particular, this alternating red and white formation forms the steep and gullied lower portion of the north flank of Timber Mesa, with the maroon and lavender smooth slopes of the Tecovas Shale above.
The Tecovas Formation is a part of the Dockum Group with the Trujillo Formation. This multicolored Triassic unit consists of shale, siltstone, and sandstone. Deposited in streams and swamps, its colors indicate varying oxidizing conditions, and the alternating dry/wet cycles typical of such environments. These rocks are fossiliferous, containing the remains of phytosaurs, amphibians, and fish, including Metoposaurus, Desmatosuchus, Koskinonodon, and lungfish, besides coprolites and the petrified wood remains of Araucarioxylon. Septarian calcite concretions and calcite geodes are numerous, and the shale forms the less steep canyon walls covered by talus slopes. A prominent band of jointed white sandstone about thick marks the middle of this formation. Lavender, gray and white shales lie below this sandstone, while an orange shale lies between this sandstone and the Trujillo Formation above. The Quartermaster and Tecovas Formations make up Capital Peak. Likewise, the lower third of Triassic Peak is composed of the deeply furrowed Quartermaster Formation, overlain by the gentle slopes and smooth surface of the Tecovas Formation shales, all capped by the weather-resistant Trujillo Formation sandstone. Large blocks of this sandstone, due to mass wasting, are found along the flanks and base of the peak.

The Trujillo Formation is a Triassic formation that is harder than the underlying Tecovas and forms many of the Canyon&#x27;s ledges. Composed of coarse sandstone, river cross-bedding indicates deposition in a stream environment. Fossils are rare. The sandstone has alternating layers of shale and marl-pebble conglomerate. The formation is massively bedded sandstone, making a distinct contact with the underlying Tecovas Formation, forming cliffs, prominent benches and mesas within the canyon. The formation includes a basal, middle, and upper sandstone members, separated by shales. The middle sandstone member forms conspicuous ledges and cliffs. Phytosaur and Koskinonodon remains, plus leaf imprints and mineralized wood have been found within the formation. Erosion-resistant sandstones protect pedestals of underlying shale, giving rise to hoodoos, including the Lighthouse, and the hoodoo at the south end of Capitol Peak. Likewise, the Rock Garden is composed of Trujillo sandstone boulders.

The Ogallala Formation is a late Miocene to early Pliocene unit which forms the cliffs and ledges at the very top of the canyon. It is composed of sandstone, siltstone, and conglomerate eroded from a late Cenozoic uplift of the Rocky Mountains, and is separated from the lower Trujillo Formation by a disconformity, representing a long hiatus. The coarse, porous sedimentary units of the Ogallala Formation constitute the Ogallala Aquifer, which has historically functioned as a major source of drinking water for much of the High Plains. Fossils of saber-toothed cats (&quot;Smilodon&quot;), bone-crushing dogs (&quot;Borophagus&quot;), mastodons, horses, long-necked camels (&quot;Aepycamelus&quot;), rhinoceroses, and large tortoises up to 3 feet in length, are present in the Ogallala. The siltstone and sandstone have been cemented by silica, which gives rise to the occurrence of common opal and almost-chert pockets. The upper portion of the formation has thick deposits of caliche, very evident at the Coronado Lodge on the northwest rim of the canyon. Fortress Cliff, on the eastern rim of the canyon, has a spectacular exposure of the Ogallala Formation.

Headward erosion by the Prairie Dog Town fork of the Red River, into the caprock escarpment of the Llano Estacado, caused differential erosion. This meant the more resistant Ogallala and Trujillo formations formed the steeper walls of the canyon.


==History==

The first evidence of human habitation of the canyon dates back about 10,000–15,000 years, and it is believed to have been continuously inhabited to the present day. Native Americans were attracted to the water of the Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River, as well as the consequent ample game, edible plants, and protection from the weather the canyon provided.

The first European explorers to discover the canyon were members of the Coronado expedition, under the Spanish crown, who visited the canyon in 1541. Apache Indians lived in Palo Duro at the time, but they were later displaced by Comanche and Kiowa tribes, who had the advantage of owning horses brought over by the Spanish. The Mescalero Apache refer to the canyon as Nił&#x27;e&#x27;agutel or &quot;canyon in the plains.&quot; They had contact with traders, called Comancheros, in nearby New Mexico.

A United States military team under Captain Randolph B. Marcy mapped the canyon in 1852 during their search for the headwaters of the Red River. The land remained under American Indian control until a military expedition led by Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie was sent in 1874 to remove the Indians to reservations in Oklahoma. The Mackenzie expedition captured about 1,200 of the Indians&#x27; horses and slaughtered them in nearby Tule Canyon during the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon. The Comanche and Kiowa conceded and left the area.

Soon after, in 1876, Charles Goodnight and a wealthy Ulster Scot named John Adair established the JA Ranch in Palo Duro Canyon. Col. Goodnight helped manage the ranch until 1890. Over the next half century, the canyon remained in private hands but was an increasingly popular tourist spot for residents.

Charles N. Gould made a geologic map of the canyon and named the formations in 1905.

In 1931, a major landowner signed a two-year contract with the local chamber of commerce to allow public access to the canyon. The upper section of the canyon was purchased by the State of Texas in 1934 and turned into the Palo Duro Canyon State Park. Amarillo is the largest city near Palo Duro Canyon State Park, but the smaller city of Canyon is nearer. In 1976, Palo Duro Canyon State Park was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.

Seven companies of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) developed the park from 1933 until 1937. Companies 1821, 1823 and 1824 made up of military veterans, companies 2875 and 2876 made up of African Americans, and company 894, a junior group of young men 17 to 25, took part in various construction projects, starting with the construction of Park Road 5, a two-lane road from the rim to the floor of the canyon. The workers used dynamite to blast away difficult areas for the road, but most work was done with hand tools such as pickaxes, shovels and wheelbarrows. 

Other CCC projects included the headquarters building, culverts, low-water crossings, bridges, Spring House, Well House, the Coronado Lodge interpretive center, 4 overnight cabins known as Cow Camp, and the 3 rim cabins. In addition, picnic and camping areas were built, complete with tables, seats, fireplaces, and garbage receptacles.

== Tourism and activities ==
Palo Duro Canyon is part of the Texas State Parks system under Texas Parks and Wildlife. Day entry into the park is covered by the Texas Parks Pass.

Palo Duro Canyon hosts several activities throughout the park. There are 16 trails for hiking, biking, and horseback riding, ranging in length from .05 miles to 4.4 miles. There are options for camping, with sites for tents with water access and RV campers alike. There are also sites for keeping horses available to campers planning to horseback ride in the canyon. In addition, lodging cabins are available for rent that sit on the outer rim of the canyon, providing an impressive view of both the canyon and the sunrise.

Group sites and spaces are available for group retreats, youth groups, and weddings. The Mack Dick Pavilion is a popular location for weddings and receptions, as the canyon provides a beautiful backdrop.

==In culture==

The painter Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, who lived in nearby Amarillo and Canyon in the early 20th century, wrote of the Palo Duro: &quot;It is a burning, seething cauldron, filled with dramatic light and color.&quot; She made paintings of Palo Duro Canyon between 1916 and 1918, when she was an instructor and head of the art department at West Texas State Normal College.

Palo Duro Canyon is the site of an outdoor historical and musical drama, titled &quot;Texas&quot;, presented annually each summer by actors, singers, dancers, and artists of the Texas Panhandle region. The spectacle, created by playwright Paul Eliot Green, premiered on July 1, 1966, at the newly constructed Pioneer Amphitheatre in Palo Duro Canyon State Park. It has continued each summer through the present, making &quot;Texas&quot; &quot;the best-attended outdoor history drama in the nation.&quot;

American composer Samuel Jones&#x27;s Symphony No. 3 is titled &quot;Palo Duro Canyon.&quot; It premiered May 1, 1992, in an outdoor performance at the Palo Duro Canyon State Park&#x27;s Pioneer Amphitheatre, with James Setapen conducting the Amarillo Symphony (which had commissioned the work). The composer writes: &quot;I wanted the piece ... to conjure up an intuitive awareness of the long movements of time required for the creation of a canyon. I also wanted in some way to pay homage to Native Americans, to whom this canyon was a sacred place. And I wanted to capture in music that magical moment which everyone experiences when they first see the flat, treeless High Plains fall dizzyingly away into the colorful vastness of the Palo Duro Canyon itself.&quot; A KACV-TV documentary on the canyon, composer, and symphony, titled &quot;And There Will Be Sounds,&quot; was broadcast on PBS stations nationally later that year; and a commercial recording was subsequently released by the Seattle Symphony under the baton of Gerard Schwarz.
A second recording was released in 2018 as part of a multichannel SACD titled &#x27;American Symphonies&#x27; on the Swedish BIS label, with Lance Friedel conducting the London Symphony Orchestra.
