<text>The Last Tycoon is an unfinished novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald. In 1941, it was published posthumously under this title, as prepared by his friend Edmund Wilson, a critic and writer. According to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, the novel is &quot;generally considered a roman à clef&quot;, with its lead character, Monroe Stahr, modeled after film producer Irving Thalberg. The story follows Stahr&#x27;s rise to power in Hollywood, and his conflicts with rival Pat Brady, a character based on MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer.

It was adapted as a TV play in 1957 and an eponymous film in 1976, with a screenplay for the motion picture by British dramatist Harold Pinter. Elia Kazan directed the film adaptation; Robert De Niro and Theresa Russell starred.

In 1993, a new version of the novel was published under the title The Love of the Last Tycoon, edited by Matthew Bruccoli, a Fitzgerald scholar. This version was adapted for a stage production that premiered in Los Angeles, California, in 1998. In 2013, HBO announced plans to produce an adaptation. HBO cancelled the project and gave the rights to Sony Pictures, which produced and released the television series on Amazon Studios in 2016.

==Plot summary==

Set in the 1930s, &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot; traces the life of Hollywood studio manager Monroe Stahr, clearly based on Irving Thalberg (in charge of production at MGM), whom Fitzgerald had encountered several times.

The novel begins with young Bennington College student Cecilia Brady (first-person narrator), the daughter of influential Hollywood producer Pat Brady, preparing to fly home from the East Coast to Los Angeles. At the airport, she is surprised to meet an old friend of her father, author Wylie White. White is accompanied by a failed producer introduced as Mr. Schwartz. Due to complications during the flight, they made a forced landing in Nashville, Tennessee. The threesome decides on a spontaneous trip to the historic estate of former President Andrew Jackson, but on arrival, the attraction is closed. Wylie then proceeds to flirt shamelessly with Cecilia while Mr. Schwartz is fast asleep. When Schwartz awakens, he informs them that he has changed his mind and will not travel to Los Angeles with them. He asks Wylie to deliver a message to a friend, which he gladly accepts. The next day, Wylie and Cecilia learn that Schwartz committed suicide right after they left Nashville.

Cecilia realizes that the message Schwartz gave to Wylie was in fact for Monroe Stahr, her father&#x27;s business partner. She has had a crush on Monroe for many years. Cecilia arrives at her father&#x27;s film studio to pick him up for a birthday party. Due to a minor earthquake, Cecilia, her father, and his companions all end up in Stahr&#x27;s office. A water pipe bursts and floods the set. Stahr beholds two women desperately clinging to the head of a statue – finding one of them to be the spitting image of his late wife. The day after, Stahr asks his secretary to identify the girls for him. She presents him with a phone number which he immediately uses to arrange a meeting with one of the girls. Unfortunately, it is not the girl he wishes to see; she does not resemble his wife at all. Stahr gives her a ride home, where she insists that he come in and meet her friend (the young Irish-born Kathleen Moore). As soon as Moore opens the front door, Stahr recognizes her to be the woman he had seen the other night.

Kathleen withstands his advances on her and even refuses to tell him her name. It is only when Stahr happens to meet her again at a party that he can convince her to go out and have a cup of coffee with him. He drives her to the building site of his new house in Santa Monica. Kathleen seems reluctant to be with Stahr, but she still ends up having sex with him. A short time afterwards, Stahr receives a letter in which Kathleen confesses to having been engaged to another man for quite some time. She has now decided to marry him despite having fallen in love with Stahr.

Stahr asks Cecilia to arrange for a meeting with a suspected communist who wants to organize a labor union within the film studio. Stahr and Cecilia meet the man over supper where Stahr gets drunk and gets involved in a violent confrontation. Cecilia takes care of him and they grow closer. Cecilia&#x27;s father, however, becomes more and more unhappy with Stahr as a business partner and has wanted to get rid of him for a long while. He could not approve less of his daughter&#x27;s fancying him. Brady knows of Stahr&#x27;s continued affair with the now-married Kathleen and tries to blackmail him into leaving the company. As he fails to achieve his goal via blackmail, he does not even shy away from hiring a professional killer. Stahr survives, and, in retaliation, also appoints a hitman to have Brady killed. Unlike Brady&#x27;s, Stahr&#x27;s conscience starts to trouble him. But, just as he contemplates calling the execution off, his plane crashes on its way back to New York City. The contract killer finishes his job unhindered and leaves Cecilia both without a father and without a lover – the two men who meant the world to her.

==List of characters==
* Monroe StahrHollywood film producer. Based on Irving Thalberg, Sheliah Graham believed Stahr to be Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;most glorified hero&quot;, who made the character &quot;everything he would have liked to be himself&quot;.
* Pat BradyStahr&#x27;s associate, also a film producer. Brady was based on Louis B. Mayer, who had a well-known rivalry with Thalberg. He also possessed certain characteristics of Eddie Mannix.

Fitzgerald states in this film that Kathleen is based on Sheilah.) Originally named Thalia, Graham suggested that Fitzgerald change the name, owing to a C. B. Cochran chorus girl with the same name who burned to death. Kathleen&#x27;s ex-lover was composed of three men: John Graham Gillam, Graham&#x27;s first husband; the Marquess of Donegall, Graham&#x27;s ex-lover; and writer Fitzgerald.

== Background ==

Fitzgerald first conceived the idea for the novel in 1931, when he met Irving Thalberg in Hollywood. Accordingly, Fitzgerald decided to set the novel in 1935, when Thalberg was still alive, so that more comparisons could be drawn between Stahr and Thalberg&#x27;s lives. In preparation for writing the novel, Fitzgerald gathered all the information he could about Thalberg. Fitzgerald was initially calling the novel &quot;The Love of the Last Tycoon: A Western&quot;.

Fitzgerald wished to finish the novel by January 1941 and begin selling it by the fall of that year; however, he was behind schedule when he died in December 1940. Sheilah Graham attributed this to two main reasons: firstly, the novel had expanded from what had originally been planned. Secondly, Fitzgerald could only work on the novel &quot;in spurts&quot;, owing to his unstable financial situation, his ill health, and his necessity to take time off to write movie scripts so he would have enough funds to continue work on the novel. At the time of his death, the novel was, according to Graham, &quot;little more than half finished&quot;.

==Publication history==

The novel was unfinished and in rough form at the time of Fitzgerald&#x27;s death at age 44. The literary critic and writer Edmund Wilson, a close friend of Fitzgerald, collected the notes for the novel and edited it for publication. The unfinished novel was published in 1941 as &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot;, by which name it is best known.

In 1993, another version of the novel was published under the title &quot;The Love of the Last Tycoon,&quot; as part of the Cambridge edition of the &quot;Works of F. Scott Fitzgerald,&quot; edited by Matthew J. Bruccoli, a Fitzgerald scholar. Bruccoli reworked the extant seventeen chapters of the thirty-one planned according to his interpretation of the author&#x27;s notes. At least one reviewer considered Bruccoli&#x27;s work to be a &quot;remarkable feat of scholarship&quot; and notes that it &quot;restored Fitzgerald&#x27;s original version and has also restored the narrative&#x27;s ostensible working title, one that implies that Hollywood is the last American frontier where immigrants and their progeny remake themselves.&quot;

==Point of view==
Fitzgerald wrote the novel in a blend of first person and third person narrations. While the story is ostensibly told by Cecilia, many scenes are narrated in which she is not present. Occasionally a scene will be presented twice, once through Cecilia and once through a third party.

==Awards==
The revised edition of &quot;The Love of The Last Tycoon&quot; won the Choice Outstanding Academic Books award of 1995.

== Reception ==
Edmund Wilson believed the novel to be Fitzgerald&#x27;s finest. Following Fitzgerald&#x27;s death, his editor Maxwell Perkins wrote a letter to Sheliah Graham, stating that &quot;the first chapter alone is good enough to stand by itself. It breaks a man&#x27;s heart so see what this book could have been&quot;. 

==Adaptations==
* 1957: John Frankenheimer directed a TV version for &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, with Jack Palance as Monroe Stahr.
* 1976: A film version was adapted for the screen by British playwright Harold Pinter, directed by Elia Kazan (his last film). It was produced by Sam Spiegel and released as &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot;. It starred Robert De Niro as Monroe Stahr and Theresa Russell as Cecilia Brady, and featured appearances by Robert Mitchum and Jack Nicholson. Pinter later won the Nobel Prize for his dramatic plays.

<text>Matthew Joseph Bruccoli (August 21, 1931 – June 4, 2008) was an American professor of English at the University of South Carolina. He was an expert on F. Scott Fitzgerald; his biography of Fitzgerald, published in 1981, was considered the standard biography for decades. He also wrote about other writers, including Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Wolfe, and John O&#x27;Hara, and was editor of the &quot;Dictionary of Literary Biography&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Matthew Joseph Bruccoli was born in 1931 in The Bronx, New York to Joseph Bruccoli and Mary Gervasi. He graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1949. He studied at Cornell University, where one of his professors was the noted author Vladimir Nabokov, and at Yale University. On campus, he was a founding member of the fledgling Manuscript Society, graduating in 1953. In 1960, he received a PhD in English literature studies from the University of Virginia, where he was supervised by Fredson Bowers.

Bruccoli&#x27;s interest in F. Scott Fitzgerald began in 1947 when he heard a radio broadcast of Fitzgerald&#x27;s short story &quot;The Diamond as Big as the Ritz&quot;. That week he tracked down a copy of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, he told interviewers, &quot;and I have been reading it ever since.&quot;

== Career ==
Bruccoli taught at the University of Virginia and the Ohio State University early in his career. He settled at the University of South Carolina, where he earned tenure and taught for four decades. He lived in Columbia, South Carolina, where, according to his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary, he &quot;cut a dash on campus, instantly recognizable by his vintage red Mercedes convertible, Brooks Brothers suits, Groucho mustache and bristling crew cut that dated to his Yale days. His untamed Bronx accent also set him apart.&quot;

Over the course of his career, Bruccoli wrote more than fifty critical books on F. Scott Fitzgerald and other literary figures. His 1981 biography of Fitzgerald, &quot;Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald&quot;, is considered the standard Fitzgerald biography. He has edited many of Fitzgerald&#x27;s works, from &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; to Fitzgerald&#x27;s unfinished final novel, &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot;. It had first been published posthumously in 1941. Edited by Bruccoli, it was published in a new version in 1993 as &quot;The Love of the Last Tycoon,&quot; part of a collection by Cambridge University Press. Bruccoli also edited Zelda Fitzgerald&#x27;s only novel &quot;Save Me the Waltz;&quot; she was married to Scott.

While studying Fitzgerald, Bruccoli and his wife Arlyn began to collect all manner of Fitzgerald memorabilia. Bruccoli owned the artist&#x27;s copy of &quot;Celestial Eyes&quot;, the cover art by Francis Cugat which appeared on the cover of the first edition, and most modern editions, of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. In 1969, Bruccoli befriended Frances &quot;Scottie&quot; Fitzgerald, the daughter of the Fitzgeralds. In 1976, Bruccoli and Scottie Fitzgerald Smith published &quot;The Romantic Egoists&quot;, from the scrapbooks that F. Scott and Zelda had maintained. These had included numerous photographs and book reviews. Later in life, Bruccoli and his wife donated their collection to the Thomas Cooper Library at University of South Carolina. The collection is valued at nearly $2 million.

Bruccoli was general editor of the &quot;Pittsburgh Series in Bibliography&quot;, published by the University of Pittsburgh Press. As part of this series, he produced &quot;F. Scott Fitzgerald: A Descriptive Bibliography&quot; and, with Richard Layman, &quot;Ring W. Lardner: A Descriptive Bibliography&quot; (1976). Bruccoli had written a working draft of the Lardner book in the summer of 1973 before giving it &quot;to his then-graduate-research-assistant Layman to work on checking it. Layman displayed so much aptitude for the assignment that a collaboration seemed obligatory.&quot; In 1983, Bruccoli published &quot;Ross Macdonald / Kenneth Millar: A Descriptive Bibliography&quot; in the &quot;Pittsburgh Series in Bibliography.&quot;

Along with Layman, who became recognized as a Dashiell Hammett scholar, and businessman C. E. Frazer Clark, Jr., Bruccoli launched the &quot;Dictionary of Literary Biography&quot;. The 400-volume reference work contains biographies of more than 12,000 literary figures from antiquity to modern times.

== Personal life ==
Bruccoli married Arlyn Firkins on October 5, 1957. They had four children: Mary, Joseph, Josephine Owens, and Arlyn Bruccoli.

== Death ==
Bruccoli continued working at the University of South Carolina until being diagnosed with a brain tumor. He died on June 4, 2008.

<text>Mircea Dinescu (; born November 11, 1950) is a Romanian poet, journalist, and editor.

==Biography==

===Early life and poetry===
He was born in Slobozia, the son of Ștefan Dinescu, a metalworker, and Aurelia (born Badea). Dinescu studied at the Faculty of Journalism of the Ștefan Gheorghiu Academy, and was considered a gifted young poet during his youth, with several poetry volumes published.

===Dissidency===
In August 1988, Dinescu was invited by the Union of Soviet Writers in the Soviet Union and on August 25, he gave an interview to the Romanian section of the Voice of Russia. During the interview, he expressed his support for the Glasnost and Perestroika policies of the Soviet Union.

After returning to Bucharest, he invited some friends (including Gabriel Liiceanu, Alexandru Paleologu, and Andrei Pleșu) to write a protest against Ceaușescu&#x27;s policies that were destroying Romanian culture and villages, but they failed to reach a consensus on the text and Dinescu decided to write his own protest. The members of the group were then visited by the Securitate, which argued that their actions were done under KGB orders as an attack against Romania, not against Ceaușescu.

His book, &quot;Moartea citește ziarul&quot; (&quot;Death is reading the newspaper&quot;) was turned down in 1988 by the Communist regime&#x27;s censorship apparatus, and was then published in Amsterdam.

On March 17, 1989, he was fired from &quot;România Literară&quot; literary magazine, as a result of an anti-totalitarian interview against President Nicolae Ceaușescu, which Dinescu had granted to the French newspaper &quot;Libération&quot; in December 1988. According to him, the reason for dismissal was &quot;receiving visits from diplomats and journalists from Socialist and capitalist countries without permission&quot;. He was expelled from the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), held under house arrest, with his house guarded around the clock, all visits banned; he was allowed to go outside just for shopping, but always flanked by two Securitate officers.

Dinescu got support from seven writers (Geo Bogza, Ștefan Augustin Doinaș, Dan Hăulică, Octavian Paler, Andrei Pleșu, Alexandru Paleologu, and Mihai Șora), who wrote a letter to Dumitru Radu Popescu, the President of the Writers&#x27; Union, asking him &quot;to undo an injustice&quot;. Despite the original authors&#x27; secrecy (they didn&#x27;t publish it abroad), six of them (all, except for Geo Bogza, a veteran socialist) were forbidden to publish. He got additional support from poet Doina Cornea, literary critics Alexandru Călinescu and Radu Enescu, and, in November 1989, a collective of 18 young academics and writers, who also wrote letters to Popescu.

Despite being isolated, Dinescu noticed that with a handful of exceptions, the writers did not protest against the oppression of the regime. On November 11, he wrote a statement in which he attacked the Romanian intelligentsia for their sycophancy for Ceaușescu, the Romanian Orthodox Church for being &quot;trade unionists in religious vestments&quot;, journalists for being &#x27;apostles of the personality cult&quot;, and writers for being &quot;trusted handmaidens of the party&quot;.

===Revolution===
In December 1989 he had a preeminent role in the Romanian Revolution, taking part in the occupation of the National Television building by the people of Bucharest. According to popular rumors, his fellow revolutionary Ion Caramitru, unaware that he was being filmed, said to Dinescu something that was taken to be &quot;Mircea, fă-te că lucrezi!&quot; (&quot;Mircea, pretend you are working!&quot;); this was to be proof that the Revolution was a carefully staged front for a coup d&#x27;état. According to the investigation of Alex Mihai Stoenescu, Caramitru actually said &quot;Mircea, arată că lucrezi&quot; (&quot;Mircea, show that you&#x27;re working [on something]&quot; – while holding Dinescu&#x27;s booklet in front of camera), to which Dinescu replied &quot;La un apel&quot; (&quot;[I&#x27;m working] on an appeal [to the people]&quot;) – which was indicative of their ill-preparedness and preoccupation in quickly drafting a single revolutionary proclamation on the spot.

===Journalist after 1989===
After the fall of Communism, he co-founded &quot;Academia Cațavencu&quot;, the most famous Romanian satirical magazine. He quit the publication in 1998 and went on founding his own publications, &quot;Plai cu Boi&quot; (loosely translated as &quot;Land of the Dumb&quot;) – a satirical Playboy-style magazine and &quot;Aspirina Săracului&quot; (&quot;The Poor Man&#x27;s Aspirin&quot; – a humorous reference to sexual intercourse) – a weekly satirical magazine.

He invested a part of the money he earned from the books published into agriculture. His estate makes a wine sold under the name &quot;Vinul Moșierului&quot; (&quot;Landlord&#x27;s wine&quot;) – the name is a tongue-in-cheek reference to an ironic comment President Ion Iliescu had made about Dinescu&#x27;s social status.

Dinescu remains a strong and charismatic voice of the civil society. As member of (&quot;National Council for the Study of the Securitate Archives&quot;), he is particularly concerned with exposing the former officers and collaborators of the Securitate. He is also a strong critic of Communism and of Romanian leaders that had connections with the Communist regime.

Although not politically involved, he openly supported Traian Băsescu&#x27;s candidature for President of Romania during the 2004 elections.

In May 2005, in collaboration with the journalist Cristian Tudor Popescu, he started a new newspaper called &quot;Gândul&quot;, with an initial circulation of 100,000 copies, but he sold his shares in July 2006. He and Stelian Tănase host a talk show on Realitatea TV, &quot;Tănase și Dinescu&quot;.

Dinescu was appointed a Commander of the Order of the Star of Romania. In 1991, he became an Honorary Member of the University of Augsburg.

<doc id="271163" wikidata="Q2822836" url="?curid=271163" title="Save Me the Waltz">
<text>Save Me the Waltz is a 1932 novel by American writer Zelda Fitzgerald. The novel&#x27;s plot follows the privileged life of Alabama Beggs, a Southern belle who grows up the Deep South during the Jim Crow era and marries David Knight, an aspiring painter. After engaging in a carefree life of hedonistic excess during the riotous Jazz Age, an aging Alabama aspires to be a prima ballerina, but an infected blister from her pointe shoe leads to blood poisoning and ends her dream of fame. Much of the semi-autobiographical plot reflects Zelda Fitzgerald&#x27;s own life and her marriage to writer F. Scott Fitzgerald.

Following the decline of her mental health in Europe, Zelda wrote the novel in January–February 1932 while in Montgomery, Alabama, and then as a voluntary patient at Johns Hopkins Hospital&#x27;s Phipps Clinic in Baltimore. She sent the manuscript to Maxwell Perkins, an editor at Scribner&#x27;s. Unimpressed by her manuscript, Perkins published the revised novel at the urging of her husband Scott Fitzgerald in order for the couple to repay financial debts incurred by Zelda&#x27;s stays at expensive institutions.

Although Scott Fitzgerald praised the novel&#x27;s quality, literary critics panned the novel for its lush prose and weak characterization. The book sold approximately 1,300 copies, and Zelda earned a grand total of $120.73. Its critical and commercial failure dispirited Zelda and led her to pursue other interests as a playwright and a painter. After investors declined to produce her play, her husband arranged an exhibition of her paintings, but the critical response proved equally disappointing.

In 1959, a decade after her death, Zelda&#x27;s friend and literary critic Edmund Wilson wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine that readers should not infer too much about the Fitzgeralds&#x27; marriage based on &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot; as the semi-fictional novel merely presents the glamorous fantasy that Zelda and Scott created about their lives. Wilson stated that acquaintance Morley Callaghan&#x27;s 1963 memoir &quot;That Summer in Paris&quot; provides a more accurate depiction of the Fitzgeralds&#x27; marriage while in Europe.

In 1970, forty years after its publication, biographer Nancy Milford speculated that Zelda&#x27;s husband rewrote the novel prior to publication. Scholarly examinations of Zelda&#x27;s drafts and revised galleys debunked this speculation. Archival evidence shows that Scott Fitzgerald did not rewrite the novel, and the revised galleys show nearly all marks to be in Zelda&#x27;s hand. Despite such scholarly refutations, popular myths persist that Scott rewrote Zelda&#x27;s novel or tried to suppress its publication.

== Plot summary ==

Alabama Beggs, a coddled Southern belle &quot;incubated in the mystic pungence of Negro mammies&quot;, comes of age in the Deep South during the Jim Crow era. She marries David Knight, a 22-year-old Irish Catholic artist and a United States Army officer stationed near her town during World War I.

David becomes a nationally famous painter, and the newly-wed couple moves to New York, where they enjoy constant revelries of hedonistic excess and dissipation amid the riotous Jazz Age. Alabama and David relocate to the French Riviera where a handsome French aviator, Jacques Chevre-Feuille, romances Alabama. In retaliation for this romance, David abandons Alabama at a dinner party and spends the night with a famous dancer.

A dissatisfied and restless Alabama becomes estranged from her alcoholic husband and their young daughter, Bonnie. Obsessed with fame, an aging Alabama aspires to be a renowned prima ballerina and devotes herself to this ambition. She is offered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to dance a featured part with the prestigious San Carlo Opera Ballet Company in Naples. Alabama journeys to the city alone, and she dances her solo debut in the opera &quot;Faust&quot;. A blister, infected from the glue in the box of her pointe shoe, leads to blood poisoning, and Alabama can never dance again.

The unhappy couple returns to Alabama&#x27;s beloved Deep South during the Great Depression where her father is dying. She searches for meaning in her father&#x27;s death but finds none. Though outwardly successful to the general public, Alabama and David are both miserable. The final paragraph depicts the unhappy Knights immobile and dissipated as a couple:

== Background and composition ==
In the Winter of 1929, while a 29-year-old Zelda Fitzgerald and her 33-year-old husband Scott sojourned in France, Zelda&#x27;s mental health deteriorated. Sara Mayfield, one of Zelda&#x27;s confidants, stated that Zelda underwent three abortions in preceding years, and Zelda&#x27;s sister Rosalind speculated that these procedures exacerbated her mental deterioration. During this period, Zelda became obsessed with dreams of fame as a prima ballerina. According to her daughter Scottie, Scott Fitzgerald supported Zelda&#x27;s ambitions and paid for her ballet lessons. 

In September 1929, after receiving an invitation to dance with the San Carlo Opera Ballet Company in Naples, Zelda undertook a grueling daily practice of up to eight hours a day. This intense regimen destroyed her physical health and precipitated a nervous breakdown. One evening, her husband returned home to find Zelda, unable to speak, collapsed on the floor and entranced with a pile of dust. After summoning a French physician, the doctor examined an incommunicable Zelda and posited that she suffered a collapse of her mental health.

A month later, in October 1929, during an automobile trip to Paris along the mountainous roads of the Grande Corniche, Zelda seized the car&#x27;s steering wheel and tried to kill herself, her husband, and their 9-year-old daughter Scottie by driving over a cliff. After this homicidal and suicidal incident, doctors diagnosed Zelda with schizophrenia. (Posthumous diagnoses posit bipolar disorder.) Dr. Oscar Forel wrote in his psychiatric diagnosis: &quot;The more I saw Zelda, the more I thought at the time [that] she is neither [suffering from] a pure neurosis nor a real psychosis—I considered her a constitutional, emotionally unbalanced psychopath—she may improve, [but] never completely recover.&quot;

After these initial observations of psychopathic tendencies, Zelda received further care at expensive psychiatric institutions. Following the Fitzgeralds return from Europe and after another mental health episode, Zelda insisted—over her husband&#x27;s financial objections—that she be admitted to the Phipps Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. The Phipps Clinic admitted Zelda on February 12, 1932. Dr. Adolf Meyer, a schizophrenia expert, oversaw her care and psychiatric evaluations. As part of her recovery routine, she spent several hours writing each day.

Having begun writing a novel in January 1932 while in Montgomery, Alabama, Zelda finished the work in February during her voluntary stay at Phipps Clinic. She wrote to Scott: &quot;I am proud of my [unfinished] novel, but I can hardly restrain myself enough to get it written. You will like it—It is distinctly École Fitzgerald, though more ecstatic than yours—perhaps too much so.&quot; Zelda finished the novel on March 9 and sent the unaltered manuscript to editor Maxwell Perkins at Scribner&#x27;s.

Surprised to receive an unannounced novel in the mail from Zelda, Perkins perused her original and unaltered manuscript. Perkins discerned &quot;a slightly deranged quality&quot; in the prose that gave the impression that Zelda could not separate &quot;fiction from reality.&quot; He deemed the novel&#x27;s overall tone to be hopelessly &quot;dated&quot; and evocative of the bygone Jazz Age hedonism in Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s 1922 work, &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot;. Perkins hoped that her husband Scott, as a veteran novelist, might be able to improve the novel&#x27;s overall quality with his guidance.

Learning that Zelda submitted a manuscript to his editor, Scott—consumed with writing his forthcoming work, &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot;—became angry that she had not shown a draft to him beforehand. Perusing the manuscript, he objected to her plagiarism of his character Amory Blaine, the protagonist of &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, and her use of the same autobiographical plot elements as his forthcoming novel.

Receiving Scott&#x27;s letter delineating these objections, Zelda replied that &quot;we might have touched the same material.&quot; Despite Scott&#x27;s initial reaction, a debt-ridden Fitzgerald believed that Zelda&#x27;s book might improve their financial situation, and the couple speedily resolved their disagreements. After a few suggestions for revisions, Scott praised the novel. He wrote to Perkins: 

Perkins did not share Scott&#x27;s enthusiasm for Zelda&#x27;s novel and, although still unimpressed by her revised manuscript, he consented to publish the work regardless as a way for the couple to repay their financial debt to Scribner&#x27;s. At the time, much of this financial debt resulted from Zelda&#x27;s medical bills for her extended voluntary stays at the Phipps Clinic and other expensive psychiatric institutions. Perkins arranged for half of the couple&#x27;s book royalties to be applied against their debt to Scribner&#x27;s until they repaid at least $5,000 ().

On June 14, 1932, Zelda signed a contract with Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons to publish the book, and Scribner&#x27;s published the work on October 7 with a printing of 3,010 copies—typical for a first novel amid the Great Depression—on cheap paper, with a green linen cover. According to Zelda, the novel&#x27;s title derives from a Victor record catalog, evoking the glamorous lifestyle which the couple enjoyed during the riotous Jazz Age.

== Contemporary reception ==

Following its publication on October 7, 1932, &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot; received overwhelmingly negative reviews. The critics savaged Zelda&#x27;s prose as overwritten, attacked her characterization as weak, and declared her tragic scenes to be unintentionally comedic. A particularly harsh review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; lambasted not only Zelda but her editor Max Perkins: 

The harsh reviews puzzled Zelda, although she acknowledged to Max Perkins that a review by William McFee, writing in &quot;The New York Sun&quot;, contained several accurate criticisms. McFee wrote: 

Malcolm Cowley, a friend of the Fitzgeralds, read Zelda&#x27;s book and wrote consolingly to her husband Scott, &quot;It moves me a lot: she has something there that nobody got into words before.&quot; Another friend, Ernest Hemingway, believed the work lacked artistic merit and warned editor Max Perkins that if he ever published a novel by any of his wives, &quot;I&#x27;ll bloody well shoot you.&quot; Perkins remained privately dismissive of the novel&#x27;s quality. The book sold approximately 1,300 copies, and Zelda earned a final sum of $120.73 ().

== Post-publication ==
The critical and commercial failure of &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot; dispirited Zelda. Believing that she might have more success as a playwright than a novelist, she wrote a farcical stage play titled &quot;Scandalabra&quot; in the fall of 1932. She submitted the play manuscript to agent Harold Ober, but Broadway investors declined to produce the play. To bolster her spirits, Scott arranged for her play &quot;Scandalabra&quot; to be staged by a Little Theater group in Baltimore, Maryland, and he sat through long hours of rehearsals of the play. This independent production arranged by Scott Fitzgerald proved to be a failure.

Following the consecutive failures of her novel &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot; and her play &quot;Scandalabra&quot;, Scott Fitzgerald remarked during a mutual criticism session with his wife and a psychiatrist that Zelda, as &quot;a third-rate writer and a third-rate ballet dancer&quot;, should instead pursue other creative outlets. Zelda next attempted to paint watercolors, but when her husband arranged their exhibition in 1934, the critical response proved equally disappointing. As with the negative reception of her book, New York critics disliked her paintings. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described them merely as &quot;paintings by the almost mythical Zelda Fitzgerald; with whatever emotional overtones or associations may remain from the so-called Jazz Age.&quot;

In January 1959, over a decade after Zelda&#x27;s death, her friend and literary critic Edmund Wilson wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine that readers should not infer too much about the Fitzgeralds&#x27; marriage based on &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot; as the semi-fictional novel merely presents the glamorous fantasy that Zelda and Scott created about their lives. Wilson stated that Morley Callaghan&#x27;s 1963 memoir &quot;That Summer in Paris&quot;, recounting Callaghan&#x27;s friendship with the Fitzgeralds during their sojourn abroad, provides a more accurate representation of the couple&#x27;s lives while in Europe.

In later decades, several critics reappraised &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot; in light of the time constraints placed on the writer and offered more charitable opinions. In 1991, &quot;The New York Times&quot; literary critic Michiko Kakutani reviewed the work and opined &quot;that for all its flaws it still manages to charm, amuse and move the reader is even more remarkable. Zelda Fitzgerald succeeded, in this novel, in conveying her own heroic desperation to succeed at something of her own, and she also managed to distinguish herself as a writer&quot;.

== Myths ==

In 1970, nearly forty years after the publication of &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot;, biographer Nancy Milford inaccurately speculated that F. Scott Fitzgerald extensively or partially rewrote Zelda Fitzgerald&#x27;s manuscript prior to its publication by Scribner&#x27;s. Contrary to this unfounded speculation, later scholarly examinations of Zelda&#x27;s drafts of &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot; deposited in the Fitzgerald Papers at Princeton University Library proved Milford&#x27;s assumptions to be false.

According to scholarly examinations, archival evidence indicates any input by Scott Fitzgerald to be advisory. The revised galleys show nearly all marks to be in Zelda&#x27;s hand, and there is no evidence that Scott rewrote the work. Despite such scholarly debunking, popular myths persist that her husband rewrote Zelda&#x27;s novel or attempted to suppress its publication.

<text>A nomogram (), also called a nomograph, alignment chart, or abac, is a graphical calculating device, a two-dimensional diagram designed to allow the approximate graphical computation of a mathematical function. The field of nomography was invented in 1884 by the French engineer Philbert Maurice d&#x27;Ocagne (1862–1938) and used extensively for many years to provide engineers with fast graphical calculations of complicated formulas to a practical precision. Nomograms use a parallel coordinate system invented by d&#x27;Ocagne rather than standard Cartesian coordinates.

A nomogram consists of a set of n scales, one for each variable in an equation. Knowing the values of n-1 variables, the value of the unknown variable can be found, or by fixing the values of some variables, the relationship between the unfixed ones can be studied. The result is obtained by laying a straightedge across the known values on the scales and reading the unknown value from where it crosses the scale for that variable. The virtual or drawn line created by the straightedge is called an &quot;index line&quot; or &quot;isopleth&quot;.

Nomograms flourished in many different contexts for roughly 75 years because they allowed quick and accurate computations before the age of pocket calculators. Results from a nomogram are obtained very quickly and reliably by simply drawing one or more lines. The user does not have to know how to solve algebraic equations, look up data in tables, use a slide rule, or substitute numbers into equations to obtain results. The user does not even need to know the underlying equation the nomogram represents. In addition, nomograms naturally incorporate implicit or explicit domain knowledge into their design. For example, to create larger nomograms for greater accuracy the nomographer usually includes only scale ranges that are reasonable and of interest to the problem. Many nomograms include other useful markings such as reference labels and colored regions. All of these provide useful guideposts to the user.
Like a slide rule, a nomogram is a graphical analog computation device. Also like a slide rule, its accuracy is limited by the precision with which physical markings can be drawn, reproduced, viewed, and aligned. Unlike the slide rule, which is a general-purpose computation device, a nomogram is designed to perform a specific calculation with tables of values built into the device&#x27;s scales. Nomograms are typically used in applications for which the level of accuracy they provide is sufficient and useful. Alternatively, a nomogram can be used to check an answer obtained by a more exact but error-prone calculation.

Other types of graphical calculators—such as intercept charts, trilinear diagrams, and hexagonal charts—are sometimes called nomograms. These devices do not meet the definition of a nomogram as a graphical calculator whose solution is found by the use of one or more linear isopleths.

==Description==

A nomogram for a three-variable equation typically has three scales, although there exist nomograms in which two or even all three scales are common. Here two scales represent known values and the third is the scale where the result is read off. The simplest such equation is &quot;u&quot;1 + &quot;u&quot;2 + &quot;u&quot;3 = 0 for the three variables &quot;u&quot;1, &quot;u&quot;2 and &quot;u&quot;3. An example of this type of nomogram is shown on the right, annotated with terms used to describe the parts of a nomogram.

More complicated equations can sometimes be expressed as the sum of functions of the three variables. For example, the nomogram at the top of this article could be constructed as a parallel-scale nomogram because it can be expressed as such a sum after taking logarithms of both sides of the equation.

The scale for the unknown variable can lie between the other two scales or outside of them. The known values of the calculation are marked on the scales for those variables, and a line is drawn between these marks. The result is read off the unknown scale at the point where the line intersects that scale. The scales include &#x27;tick marks&#x27; to indicate exact number locations, and they may also include labeled reference values. These scales may be linear, logarithmic, or have some more complex relationship.

The sample isopleth shown in red on the nomogram at the top of this article calculates the value of &quot;T&quot; when &quot;S&quot; = 7.30 and &quot;R&quot; = 1.17. The isopleth crosses the scale for &quot;T&quot; at just under 4.65; a larger figure printed in high resolution on paper would yield &quot;T&quot; = 4.64 to three-digit precision. Note that any variable can be calculated from values of the other two, a feature of nomograms that is particularly useful for equations in which a variable cannot be algebraically isolated from the other variables.

Straight scales are useful for relatively simple calculations, but for more complex calculations the use of simple or elaborate curved scales may be required. Nomograms for more than three variables can be constructed by incorporating a grid of scales for two of the variables, or by concatenating individual nomograms of fewer numbers of variables into a compound nomogram.
==Applications==
Nomograms have been used in an extensive array of applications. A sample includes:

* The original application by d&#x27;Ocagne, the automation of complicated cut and fill calculations for earth removal during the construction of the French national railway system. This was an important proof of concept, because the calculations are non-trivial and the results translated into significant savings of time, effort, and money.
* The design of channels, pipes and wires for regulating the flow of water.
* The work of Lawrence Henderson, in which nomograms were used to correlate many different aspects of blood physiology. It was the first major use of nomograms in the United States and also the first medical nomograms anywhere.
* Medical fields, such as pharmacy and oncology.
* Ballistics calculations prior to fire control systems, where calculating time was critical.
* Machine shop calculations, to convert blueprint dimensions and perform calculations based on material dimensions and properties. These nomograms often included markings for standard dimensions and for available manufactured parts.
* Statistics, for complicated calculations of properties of distributions and for operations research including the design of acceptance tests for quality control.
* Operations Research, to obtain results in a variety of optimization problems.
* Chemistry and chemical engineering, to encapsulate both general physical relationships and empirical data for specific compounds.
* Aeronautics, in which nomograms were used for decades in the cockpits of aircraft of all descriptions. As a navigation and flight control aid, nomograms were fast, compact and easy-to-use calculators.
* Astronomical calculations, as in the post-launch orbital calculations of Sputnik 1 by P. E. Elyasberg.
* Engineering work of all kinds: Electrical design of filters and transmission lines, mechanical calculations of stress and loading, optical calculations, and so forth.
* Military, where complex calculations need to be made in the field quickly and with reliability not dependent on electrical devices.
*Seismology, where nomograms have been developed to estimate earthquake magnitude and to present results of probabilistic seismic hazard analyses

==Examples==

===Parallel-resistance/thin-lens===

The nomogram below performs the computation:

formula_1

This nomogram is interesting because it performs a useful nonlinear calculation using only straight-line, equally graduated scales. While the diagonal line has a scale formula_2 times larger than the axes scales, the numbers on it exactly match those directly below or to its left, and thus it can be easily created by drawing a straight line diagonally on a sheet of graph paper.

&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are entered on the horizontal and vertical scales, and the result is read from the diagonal scale. Being proportional to the harmonic mean of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, this formula has several applications. For example, it is the parallel-resistance formula in electronics, and the thin-lens equation in optics.

In the example, the red line demonstrates that parallel resistors of 56 and 42 ohms have a combined resistance of 24 ohms. It also demonstrates that an object at a distance of 56 cm from a lens whose focal length is 24 cm forms a real image at a distance of 42 cm.
===Chi-squared test computation===

The nomogram below can be used to perform an approximate computation of some values needed when performing a familiar statistical test, Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test. This nomogram demonstrates the use of curved scales with unevenly spaced graduations.

The relevant expression is:

formula_3

The scale along the top is shared among five different ranges of observed values: A, B, C, D and E. The observed value is found in one of these ranges, and the tick mark used on that scale is found immediately above it. Then the curved scale used for the expected value is selected based on the range. For example, an observed value of 9 would use the tick mark above the 9 in range A, and curved scale A would be used for the expected value. An observed value of 81 would use the tick mark above 81 in range E, and curved scale E would be used for the expected value. This allows five different nomograms to be incorporated into a single diagram.

In this manner, the blue line demonstrates the computation of:

 (9 − 5)2 / 5 = 3.2

and the red line demonstrates the computation of:

 (81 − 70)2 / 70 = 1.7

In performing the test, Yates&#x27;s correction for continuity is often applied, and simply involves subtracting 0.5 from the observed values. A nomogram for performing the test with Yates&#x27;s correction could be constructed simply by shifting each &quot;observed&quot; scale half a unit to the left, so that the 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, ... graduations are placed where the values 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, ... appear on the present chart.
===Food risk assessment===

Although nomograms represent mathematical relationships, not all are mathematically derived. The following one was developed graphically to achieve appropriate end results that could readily be defined by the product of their relationships in subjective units rather than numerically. The use of non-parallel axes enabled the non-linear relationships to be incorporated into the model.

The numbers in square boxes denote the axes requiring input after appropriate assessment.

The pair of nomograms at the top of the image determine the probability of occurrence and the availability, which are then incorporated into the bottom multistage nomogram.

Lines 8 and 10 are &#x27;tie lines&#x27; or &#x27;pivot lines&#x27; and are used for the transition between the stages of the compound nomogram.

The final pair of parallel logarithmic scales (12) are not nomograms as such, but reading-off scales to translate the risk score (11, remote to extremely high) into a sampling frequency to address safety aspects and other &#x27;consumer protection&#x27; aspects respectively. This stage requires political &#x27;buy in&#x27; balancing cost against risk. The example uses a three-year minimum frequency for each, though with the high risk end of the scales different for the two aspects, giving different frequencies for the two, but both subject to an overall minimum sampling of every food for all aspects at least once every three years.

This risk assessment nomogram was developed by the UK Public Analyst Service with funding from the UK Food Standards Agency for use as a tool to guide the appropriate frequency of sampling and analysis of food for official food control purposes, intended to be used to assess all potential problems with all foods, although not yet adopted.
===Other quick nomograms===
Using a ruler, one can readily read the missing term of the law of sines or the roots of the quadratic and cubic equation.

<text> (, &quot;Defenders of the Homeland&quot;) is the national anthem of Tunisia; the text was written by Mostafa Saadeq Al-Rafe&#x27;ie and Aboul-Qacem Echebbi.

==History==
The lyrics come from a poem written in the 1930s by Egyptian poet Mostafa Saadeq Al-Rafe&#x27;ie. Although some say the melody of this march was composed by Mohammed Abdel Wahab, Tunisian musicologist Salah El Mahdi claims the melody was composed by the poet while the original music for the poem was composed by Zakariyya Ahmad.

The very last verses of the lyrics were written by Aboul-Qacem Echebbi. According to El Mahdi, these verses were appended to the lyrics in June 1955 by nationalist Mongi Slim.

Known as the &quot;Hymn of the Revolution&quot;, it was sung during the meetings of the ruling party, the Neo Destour, which later changed its name to the Socialist Destourian Party. &quot;Ḥumat al-Ḥima&quot; was temporarily used as a national anthem between the end of the monarchy on 25 July 1957, when it replaced the &quot;Salam al-Bey&quot;, and 20 March 1958, when it was replaced by &quot;Ala Khallidi&quot;. &quot;Ḥumat al-Ḥima&quot; was later brought back again following the coup d&#x27;état that brought Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to power on 7 November 1987.

==Lyrics==
On occasions requiring brevity, a short version is sung consisting of the chorus, the third verse (not repeated) and the chorus again.

<doc id="271173" wikidata="Q1560559" url="?curid=271173" title="Nectarius of Constantinople">
<text>Nectarius of Constantinople (; died 27 September 397) was the archbishop of Constantinople from 381 until his death, the successor to Saint Gregory of Nazianzus and predecessor to John Chrysostom.

== Life ==
Born in Tarsus in Cilicia of a noble family, he was widely known for his admirable character. When Gregory resigned as Archbishop of Constantinople, Nectarius was praetor of Constantinople. Preparing for a journey to Tarsus, he called on the bishop of Tarsus, Diodorus, who was attending the First Council of Constantinople (one of the ecumenical councils), to ask if he could take letters for him; his appearance and manners struck Diodorus so forcibly that he at once determined that he should be advanced as a candidate for Bishop; making an excuse of attending to some other business, he took Nectarius to see Meletius of Antioch.

== His unexpected appointment ==
The Roman emperor Theodosius I asked the Bishops at the Council to suggest new candidates from whom he could pick the new bishop. The Bishop of Antioch put Nectarius&#x27; name at the bottom of his list. After reading the lists, the emperor declared Nectarius to be his choice. This caused some amazement among the Fathers who wanted to know who and what this Nectarius was. He was still only a catechumen. There was much astonishment at the emperor&#x27;s unexpected choice, but the people of Constantinople were delighted at the news as was the whole council.

Nectarius was duly baptized and his clothes were changed for the robes of a Bishop of the Imperial City and became at once president of the First Council of Constantinople.

Nectarius ruled the church for upwards of 16 years and is thought of as having been a good prelate. His name heads the 150 signatures to the canons of the First Council of Constantinople. Given the personal favor which the emperor bore to Nectarius, the 3rd canon declared that the Bishop of Constantinople shall hold the first rank after the bishop of Rome because Constantinople is the new Rome.

== Dissent threatens ==
The Bishops of the West opposed the election result and asked for a common synod of East and West to settle the succession and so the Emperor Theodosius I, soon after the close of the first council, summoned the Imperial Bishops to a fresh synod at Constantinople; nearly all of the same bishops who had attended the earlier second council were assembled again in early summer of 382. On arrival they received a letter from the synod of Milan, inviting them to a great general council at Rome; however, they indicated that they must remain where they were because they had not made any preparations for such long a journey. However, they sent three (Syriacus, Eusebius and Priscian of Lydia) with a synodal letter to Pope Damasus I, archbishop Saint Ambrose and the other bishops assembled in the council at Rome.

The Roman synod to which this letter was addressed was the fifth under Damasus. No formal account remains of its proceedings, nor of how its members treated the question of Nectarius. Theodosius I, did however, send commissaries to Rome in support of his synod. In his 15th letter (to the bishops of Illyria) he indicated that the church in Rome had finally agreed to recognize both Nectarius of Constantinople and Flavian I of Antioch.

Six letters from Nectarius remain extant in the files of his predecessor Gregory of Nazianzus. In the first he expresses his hearty good wishes for his episcopate. The last is of great importance, urging him not to be too liberal in tolerating the Apollinarians.

In 383 a third synod at Constantinople was held. In spite of the decrees of bishops and emperor, the Arians and Pneumatomachians continued to spread their doctrines. Theodosius summoned all parties to the Imperial city for a great discussion in June, hoping to reconcile all differences. Before this, he had sent for the Archbishop and told him that all questions should be fully debated.

After this, Nectarius returned home, full of anxiety and consulted the Novatianist Bishop Agelius, who felt himself unsuited to arbitrate on such a controversy. However, he did have a reader, Sisinnius I of Constantinople, a philosopher and theologian, to whom he referred the argument with the Arians. Sisinnius I suggested that they should produce the testimonies of the old Fathers of the Church on the doctrine of the Son, and first ask the heads of the several parties whether they accepted these authorities or desired to anathematise them.

Both the Archbishop and the Emperor agreed to this suggestion and when the Bishops met, the Emperor asked whether they respected &quot;...the teachers who lived before the Arian division?&quot; They confirmed that they did and he then asked if they acknowledged, &quot;... them sound and trustworthy witnesses of the true Christian doctrine?&quot;.

This question however produced divisions and so the emperor ordered each party to draw up a written confession of its doctrine. When this was done, the Bishops were summoned to the Imperial palace, where the emperor received them with kindness and retired to his study with their written confessions. Theodosius I however rejected and destroyed all except that of the orthodox, because he felt that the others introduced a division into the Holy Trinity.

After this, Theodosius I forbade all sectaries, except the Novatianists, to hold divine services or to publish their doctrines or to ordain clergy, under threat of severe civil penalties.

In 385 the emperor&#x27;s wife Aelia Flaccilla and their daughter Pulcheria died. The archbishop asked Gregory of Nyssa to preach the funeral sermons for both of them.

Towards the close of his episcopate, Nectarius abolished the office of presbyter penitentiary, whose duty appears to have been to receive confessions before communion. His example was followed by nearly all other Bishops. The presbyter penitentiary was added to the ecclesiastical roll about the time of the Novatianist schism when that party declined to communicate with those who had lapsed in the Decian persecution. Gradually there were fewer lapsed to reconcile, and his duties became more closely connected with preparation for communion. Nectarius abolished the office due to a scandal that had occurred in connection with it.

Nectarius died in office on 27 September 397 and was succeeded by Saint John Chrysostom.

== Veneration ==
The Eastern Orthodox Church holds Nectarius as Saint, with a feast day of 11 October. He was venerated as a saint in the first millennium on 11 October.

<text>The R-39 (; NATO reporting name: SS-N-20 &quot;[[Sturgeon]]&quot;; bilateral arms control designation: RSM-52) was a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) that served with the Soviet Navy from its introduction in 1983 until 1991, after which it served with the Russian Navy until 2004. The missile had GRAU indices of 3M65, 3M20, and 3R65. It was carried on board Typhoon-class submarines.

An intercontinental missile, the R-39 had a three-stage solid-fuel boost design with a liquid-fuel post-boost unit carrying up to ten multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle warheads. Like other SLBMs the initial launch was powered by a gas generator in the bottom of the firing tube. During the missile&#x27;s passage through the water additional motors produce a gaseous wall around the missile, reducing hydrodynamic resistance. The launch system was designated &quot;D-19&quot;.

==Development==
Development work began at NII Mashinostroyeniya in 1971 and the design gained official approval in 1973. Initial test flights from 1979 found problems in the solid-fuel boost engines, over half of the early flights failed. Later tests aboard a modified Typhoon-class submarine were more successful and deployment began in May 1983, with 20 missiles in each submarine. At full deployment, 120 missiles were deployed with 1,200 total warheads.

Under the terms of the START I and START II treaties, from 1996 a number of R-39 missiles were destroyed. Throughout the 1990s, Typhoon class submarines and the R-39 missiles they carried were gradually withdrawn from service. All the missiles were decommissioned by 2004 and all the Typhoon class submarines have been retired, except for one which is used as a test platform for the RSM-56 Bulava.

A successor design, R-39M Grom (, Thunder)/RSM-52V/SS-N-28 for D-19UTTKh launch system, suffered a succession of testing failures and was cancelled.

<text>LBCAST (lateral buried [[electrical charge|charge]] accumulator and sensing [[transistor]] array) is a type of photo sensor which the manufacturer claims is simpler and thus smaller and faster than CMOS sensors. It was developed over ten years by Nikon, in parallel with other manufacturer&#x27;s development of CMOS, and resulted in shipping product in 2003.

Both CMOS and LBCAST technologies branched from researchers discussions of &quot;amplifying sensors&quot; as a way to develop an imaging sensor with lower power requirements than the already-existing CCD sensor technology, for use in portable devices such as DSLR cameras.

From the Nikon Website:

: &quot;In July 2003, Nikon introduced LBCAST- a completely new type of image sensor, different from CCD and CMOS, that is a high-speed, power-efficient, low-noise device to be installed in Nikon&#x27;s flagship camera, the D2Hs.&quot;

: &quot;... Compared with conventional sensors, it saves more power and achieves less dark noise. (Dark noise is a phenomenon in which randomly spaced bright pixels appear in images due to the heat from the image device during shooting). Also, LBCAST increases image processing speed and improves sensitivity, contrast and color reproduction.&quot;

== Comparison between LBCAST and CMOS photo sensors ==

The main differences between LBCAST and CMOS-based sensors appear to be those given below:

* LBCAST divides the photosites to be read out into two channels by colour, red and blue photosites—making up 50% of the total number of photosites between them, as in CMOS and CCD colour sensors—accumulate using one read-channel, while green photosites—which make up the other 50% of total pixels, as in CMOS and CCD—accumulate in a dedicated channel.

: This division is to speed reading, and the separation of green pixels, to which the human eye is most sensitive, reduces noise artifacts which might otherwise be introduced by residual electrical charge in the accumulation circuitry, acquired previously from reading a pixel of a different colour.

: Red and blue are significantly less important in human sight, and so presumably a decision was made not to keep separate read channels for the two colours, in order to simplify the circuit design for practical use -- at least in the described version of LBCAST technology.

* Each photosite in LBCAST uses a single JFET transistor in place of two MOSFET transistors used for the separate tasks of photosite read-out selection and signal amplification, in CMOS technology. In total, CMOS uses four transistors per photosite, where LBCAST manages with three.
* Charge to be (re-)distributed between components in the sensor during use are channeled via the LBCAST lower layers, where CMOS channels this charge over the surface layer. This difference is also claimed to reduce the presence of noise artifacts.
* The simpler circuitry required translates into more space for light to be received, since wiring and opaque masking takes less space.
* The simpler circuitry required translates into fewer layers of material in the silicon chip meaning that tangential light requires less correction in order to traverse to the depth at which the photons result in signal, simplifying the need for lensing at each pixel or photosite, and therefore theoretically, attaining greater image uniformity.

== Uses of LBCAST sensors ==

As at end 2006, the Nikon D2H and the D2Hs were the only publicly available cameras known to carry the sensor. Nikon has opted to use CCDs sourced from Sony in most of their low and mid range cameras and used a CMOS sensor in the flagship D2Xs/D2x. The LBCAST sensor in the D2Hs has remained at 4.1MP.

With the advent of the D3, D700 and D300 cameras in 2007 and 2008, all featuring CMOS sensor technology, it is unknown whether LBCAST plays a part in the design of the CMOS sensor of either, since Nikon&#x27;s implementation of LBCAST is an adaptation of CMOS, and it is therefore technically correct to refer to the known instances of LBCAST as CMOS, Nikon has not been forthcoming to requests for specific information on the D3 sensor and Nikon have claimed in the past that LBCAST would be further developed.

== Criticisms of LBCAST sensors ==

The following weaknesses have been cited as affecting the Nikon D2H, although whether these issues have origins specific to LBCAST, and whether LBCAST necessitates these problems, is not known.

* Colour cast—generally (and by definition) colour correction is a fundamental requirement of imaging in any medium where incident light quality is variable, including unaided human vision, and so this possibly a software issue.
* Infra-red pollution—incident infra-red light is usually filtered on image sensors, using a specific thin film dedicated to this task (but which may serve an additional purpose in protecting the relatively much more expensive sensor component from contamination and damage), and so this issue, if truly the result of ir pollution, may be a problem which is independent of the LBCAST technology of the sensor.
* Low resolution—it is not known whether the relatively low resolution of the D2H and D2Hs in comparison with other professional cameras of the day is a technological limitation of LBCAST, a business management or marketing decision, or whether it has other causes such as gradual ramping-up of manufacturing capability of a new technology by Nikon, who did not appear previously to have the capacity to have novel sensors manufactured to their specification. It is known that there is a market for high-speed, power efficient cameras where higher resolution is not required, for example newspaper journalism.

<doc id="271181" wikidata="Q454364" url="?curid=271181" title="Tammy Faye Messner">
<text>Tamara Faye Messner (née LaValley, formerly Bakker ; March 7, 1942 – July 20, 2007) was an American evangelist. She co-founded the televangelist program &quot;The PTL Club&quot; with her husband Jim Bakker in 1974. They had hosted their own puppet-show series for local programming in the early 1960s; Messner also had a career as a recording artist. In 1978, she and Bakker built Heritage USA, a Christian theme park.

During her career Messner was noted for her eccentric and glamorous persona, as well as for moral views that diverged from those of many mainstream evangelists, particularly her advocacy for LGBT persons and reaching out to HIV/AIDS patients at the height of the AIDS epidemic. She released three autobiographies during her lifetime, &quot;I Gotta Be Me&quot; in 1978, &quot;Tammy: Telling it My Way&quot; in 1996, and &quot;I Will Survive and You Will Too!&quot; in 2003.

Jim Bakker was indicted, convicted, and imprisoned on numerous counts of fraud and conspiracy in 1989, resulting in the dissolution of &quot;The PTL Club&quot;. She divorced Bakker in 1992, while he was in prison, and married Roe Messner. She was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1996, from which she suffered intermittently for over a decade before dying of the disease in 2007.

==Biography==
===1942–1959: Early life===
She was born Tamara Faye LaValley in International Falls, Minnesota, to Pentecostal preachers Rachel Minnie (née Fairchild; 1919–1992) and Carl Oliver LaValley, who married in 1941. Shortly after she was born, a painful divorce soured her mother against ministers, alienating her from the church. Both of her parents remarried, her mother to Fred Willard Grover, forming a large blended family, of which she was the eldest.

===1960–1973: Marriage to Jim Bakker; early work===
In 1960, she met Jim Bakker while they were students at North Central Bible College in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Tammy Faye worked in a boutique for a time while Jim found work in a restaurant inside a department store in Minneapolis. They were married on April 1, 1961. The next year, they moved to South Carolina, where they began their ministry together, initially traveling around the United States; Jim preached, while Tammy Faye sang songs and played the accordion. In 1970, she gave birth to their daughter Tammy Sue &quot;Sissy&quot; Bakker, and in 1975 gave birth to their son Jamie Charles Bakker.

Jim and Tammy Faye had been involved with television from the time of their departure from Minneapolis until they moved to the Charlotte area via Virginia Beach, Virginia, where they were founding members of &quot;The 700 Club&quot;. While in Portsmouth, they were hosts of the popular children&#x27;s show &quot;Jim and Tammy&quot;. They then created a puppet ministry for children on Pat Robertson&#x27;s Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), which ran from 1964 to 1973.

===1974–1987: &quot;The PTL Club&quot;===
Jim and Tammy Faye co-founded &quot;The PTL Club&quot; (Praise The Lord) in 1974, a televangelist Christian news program that they initially hosted in an abandoned furniture store in Charlotte. The series mixed &quot;glitzy entertainment with down-home family values&quot; and preached a prosperity gospel&#x27; which put a divine seal of approval on both the growing affluence of American evangelicals and the showy lifestyles of their television ministers.&quot; &quot;The PTL Club&quot; soon grew into its own network and a corporate enterprise within a year of its founding, generating $120 million annually in the 1970s. In 1978, the Bakkers used $200 million of PTL funds to build Heritage USA, a Christian retreat and theme park that, at the time, ranked alongside Disney World and Disneyland as one of the most popular theme parks in the United States.

Throughout the series, Tammy Faye provided a sentimental and emotive touch to stories, and also often sang Christian songs. She was also noted for her candid discussion of topics considered taboo amongst many of her Evangelist peers, ranging from penile implants to acceptance and compassion for the LGBT community.

At the height of the AIDS epidemic in the mid-1980s, she conducted an emotional interview with Steven Pieters, a gay Christian minister with AIDS on &quot;Tammy&#x27;s House Party,&quot; a segment of &quot;The PTL Club&quot;, during which they discussed his sexuality, coming out, diagnosis with AIDS, and the death of his partner. During the program, Tammy Faye addressed her viewership, saying: &quot;How sad that we as Christians, who are to be the salt of the earth, we who are supposed to be able to love everyone, are afraid so badly of an AIDS patient that we will not go up and put our arm around them and tell them that we care.&quot; Throughout the AIDS epidemic, she advocated for viewers of &quot;The PTL Club&quot; to follow Christ and show compassion and pray for the ill, and also invited drug addicts onto the show to interview them about substance abuse. In 1987, it was reported that Tammy Faye was herself being treated for a prescription drug addiction.

Bakker&#x27;s friend, the Reverend Mel White, commented on her presence on &quot;The PTL Club&quot;:
===1988–1995: Collapse of &quot;The PTL Club&quot; and aftermath===

The Bakkers&#x27; control of PTL collapsed in 1987 after revelations that $287,000 had been paid from the organization to buy the silence of Jessica Hahn, who claims Jim Bakker raped her. In his 1997 book, &quot;I Was Wrong&quot;, Jim Bakker disputed Hahn&#x27;s account, claiming that he was &quot;set up&quot; and that their sex was consensual. The revelations invited scrutiny of the Bakkers, and charges made about their opulent lives, including media reports of an air-conditioned doghouse at their Tega Cay, South Carolina, lakefront parsonage as well as gold-plated bathroom fixtures, dominated newscasts in the 1980s. When asked about her income, Tammy Faye told reporters in 1986: &quot;We don&#x27;t get what Johnny Carson makes, and we work a lot harder than him.&quot; The couple&#x27;s Tega Cay home was later sold by the ministry and burned to the ground not long thereafter. Jim wrote in his book &quot;I Was Wrong&quot; that he watched the home burn on live television while incarcerated. The &quot;Charlotte Observer&quot; subsequently ran exposés of PTL&#x27;s finances and management practices. PTL went bankrupt after being taken over by Lynchburg, Virginia-based Baptist televangelist Jerry Falwell, who offered to step in following the scandals in 1988.

Tammy Faye stood by Jim Bakker through the scandal, including several instances when she cried on camera. In 1989, Bakker was sentenced to 45 years in prison on 24 fraud and conspiracy counts (he served 5). In 1992, while Jim was in prison, Tammy Faye filed for divorce, saying in a letter to the New Covenant Church in Orlando, Florida: &quot;For years I have been pretending that everything is all right, when in fact I hurt all the time... I cannot pretend anymore.&quot;

On October 3, 1993, she married property developer Roe Messner in Rancho Mirage, California, after he divorced his first wife. They moved to the Charlotte suburb of Matthews, North Carolina. Tammy Faye and Roe were neighbors to Christian recording star and friend David L Cook. Roe, who had a contracting business, Messner Enterprises in Andover, Kansas, had built much of Heritage USA as well as many large churches and had been a family friend to the Bakkers throughout the PTL years. Roe was the one who produced the money for the $265,000 payment to Hahn, later billing PTL for work never completed on the Jerusalem Amphitheater at Heritage USA. In the Bakkers&#x27; fraud trial, Roe Messner testified for Bakker&#x27;s defense, saying that Bakker had no knowledge of the payment to Jessica Hahn, and that Falwell had sent him to the Bakker home in Palm Springs, California, to offer generous compensation &quot;if he kept his mouth shut.&quot;

=== 1996–2007: Later life and illness ===
In 1996, Roe Messner was convicted of bankruptcy fraud, having claimed to owe nearly $30 million to over 300 creditors in 1990. As he faced sentencing in 1996, he said he could not afford to treat his prostate cancer because he lacked health insurance. He was sentenced to and served 27 months in prison.

With her first husband fresh out of jail and her current partner now serving his sentence, Tammy Faye was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1996, and she re-entered the public eye in a series of books, movies, and television appearances. That year she published her autobiography, &quot;Tammy: Telling It My Way&quot;, and co-hosted a TV talk show titled &quot;The Jim J. and Tammy Faye Show&quot; with Jim J. Bullock.

She appeared twice on &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; in 1996 and 1999, playing the mother of character Mimi Bobeck (Kathy Kinney), who was also known for wearing excessive amounts of makeup. On September 11, 2003, Messner published a new autobiography, &quot;I Will Survive... and You Will, Too!&quot;, in which she described her battles with cancer and her life with Roe Messner.

She was the subject of a documentary titled &quot;The Eyes of Tammy Faye&quot; (2000), narrated by RuPaul, and a follow-up film titled &quot;Tammy Faye: Death Defying&quot; (2004).

Despite her background in Christian fundamentalism, Messner became a gay icon after parting from PTL, appearing in Gay Pride marches with figures such as Lady Bunny and Bruce Vilanch. Unlike many American Christian fundamentalists, she &quot;had long refused to denounce homosexuals&quot; and publicly expressed compassion toward, and urged support for Americans with HIV/AIDS when it was still a much-feared and unknown disease. She was benevolently referred to as &quot;the ultimate drag queen,&quot; and said in her last interview with Larry King that, &quot;When I wentwhen we lost everything, it was the gay people that came to my rescue, and I will always love them for that.&quot;

In early 2004, she appeared on the second season of the VH1 reality television series &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;. The show chronicled a twelve-day period wherein she, Ron Jeremy, Vanilla Ice, Traci Bingham, Erik Estrada, and Trishelle Cannatella lived together in a Los Angeles house and were assigned various tasks and activities. Together, the six put on a children&#x27;s play and managed a restaurant for a day. She also attended a book signing for her best-seller, &quot;I Will Survive... And You Will Too&quot;.

At the end of the show, Messner said she thought of Vanilla Ice and Trishelle Cannatella as her children and could relate to them deeply because she had similar feelings and problems when she was their age.

In July 2007, on more solid financial footing, the Messners relocated to Loch Lloyd, Missouri, a suburb of Kansas City. Jim Bakker had relocated his operations to Branson, Missouri, in 2003. She told &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; they had moved to the &quot;dream house&quot; to be closer to Roe&#x27;s children and grandchildren from his first marriage.

==Death==
Messner&#x27;s 11 years with cancer were highly publicized. She was first diagnosed with colon cancer in March 1996, but later revealed she had endured bleeding for a year out of embarrassment at the prospect of seeing a male doctor. The disease went into remission by the end of that year.

In March 2004, Messner made an appearance on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; and announced that she had inoperable lung cancer and would soon begin chemotherapy. She continued to receive chemotherapy throughout mid-2004. In November 2004, also on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, she announced that she was cancer-free once again. She described the details of her chemotherapy and continued to appear regularly on King&#x27;s show.

A television documentary of her struggle with cancer was produced in 2004. It was on King&#x27;s program again that she announced in July 2005 that her cancer had returned. In a March 2006 appearance on the show, she said she was continuing to suffer from lung cancer, which had reached stage 4, and that she was continuing to receive treatment for it. She also mentioned having difficulty swallowing food, suffering from panic attacks, and enduring substantial weight loss. As her health continued to worsen, a &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; article in an October 2006 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; stated that she was dying in hospice care, and a December 2006 article in Walter Scott&#x27;s column in &quot;Parade&quot; reported that her son Jay was &quot;at a North Carolina hospice with his mom, [who is] gravely ill with colon cancer&quot;.

Messner was a guest by phone on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; in December 2006, and said that she was receiving hospice care in her home. She appeared in her son Jay&#x27;s documentary series &quot;One Punk Under God&quot;, wherein they talked about her cancer treatments. In one episode, she required the use of oxygen in order to talk.

In May 2007, she issued a statement on her website saying that chemotherapy had stopped, and she urged her fans to continue to pray for her. The story was reported on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot;, and a feature in which fans and well-wishers could post get-well messages to Tammy was added to her website.

On July 18, 2007, Messner made her final appearance on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;. At the time, she said she weighed 65 pounds (29.5 kg) and was unable to eat solid food. Messner&#x27;s husband later said that he believed she chose to do the interview to say a final goodbye to her fans.

Two days later, on July 20, 2007, Messner died at her home in Loch Lloyd, near Kansas City, Missouri, after an eleven-year bout with cancer. She was 65 years old. A family service was held on the morning of July 21, at the Messner family plot in Waldron, Kansas. The ceremony was officiated by Rev. Randy McCain, the pastor of Open Door Community Church in Sherwood, Arkansas. According to CNN, the family requested that King officially report the news of her death. Her remains were cremated and her ashes were returned to Waldron Cemetery where they were subsequently buried.

==In popular culture==
In June 2006, a stage musical titled &quot;The Gospel According to Tammy Faye&quot; opened at the Cincinnati Fringe Festival and was subsequently developed as a larger professional production. The show features songs by J. T. Buck and a book by Fernando Dovalina. The musical is described as a fantasia which takes a balanced and fair look at its subject. The impetus for the show was provided by a lengthy interview that Messner gave the authors in March 2005. The musical aired in August 2006 in Portland, Oregon and Hood River, Oregon, and it was presented on stage at Houston&#x27;s Alley Theatre at the end of July 2007 under direction of Les R. Wood. Industry readings presented by the Columbia Gorge Repertory Company were held at the Manhattan Theatre Club in December 2007, the cast including Tony nominee Sally Mayes and veteran Broadway performers William Youmans, Ken Land, Julie Foldesi, James T. Lane and Heather Parcells. The readings were directed by Mindy Cooper. Seth Farber provided musical direction.

Another musical following her life, titled &quot;Big Tent&quot;, debuted in May 2007, at off-Broadway&#x27;s New World Stages, in New York City. The show features music and lyrics by Ben Cohn and Sean McDaniel, a book by Jeffery Self, and direction by Ryan J. Davis. A star-studded concert of songs from the show opened in February 2008, at New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Room.

A play about her final hours, &quot;Tammy Faye&#x27;s Final Audition&quot; by Merri Biechler, premiered at the Cincinnati Fringe Festival in June 2015. The play takes place in a fevered dream at the end of her life, wherein she enlists the men in her life for one final TV talk show audition.

A musical about the life of BeBe Winans, &quot;Born for This&quot;, debuted on June 25, 2018, at the Emerson Cutler Majestic Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts. Tammy Faye and Jim Bakker appear as supporting characters who give BeBe and his sister CeCe their first big break as singers on &quot;The PTL Club&quot;.

At one time, Broadway actress Kristin Chenoweth was planning a musical based on Messner&#x27;s life.

<text>Cherie, Lady Blair (; born 23 September 1954), also known professionally as Cherie Booth, is an English barrister and writer. She is the spouse of former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair.

==Early life and education==
Booth was born on 23 September 1954 at Fairfield General Hospital, Bury, Lancashire, England, and brought up in Ferndale Road, Waterloo, Merseyside, just north of Liverpool. Although her birth was registered as &#x27;Cherie&#x27;, owing to her maternal grandmother&#x27;s influence, she was christened &#x27;Theresa Cara&#x27; in deference to the requirement that she be given a saint&#x27;s name. Her father, British actor Tony Booth, left her mother, actress Gale Howard (née Joyce Smith; 14 February 1933 – 5 June 2016), when Cherie was 8 years old. Cherie and her younger sister Lyndsey were then brought up by Gale and their paternal grandmother Vera Booth, a devout Roman Catholic of Irish descent. The sisters attended Catholic schools in Crosby, Merseyside. Cherie Booth attended Seafield Convent Grammar, which is now part of Sacred Heart Catholic College, where she achieved four As in her A Levels.

She read law at the London School of Economics and graduated with First-Class Honours. Later she was enrolled at the College of Law and passed her Bar Vocational Course. She came at the top of her year in the bar exams, while teaching law at the Polytechnic of Central London (University of Westminster). She was the Labour candidate for the Conservative safe seat of North Thanet in Kent in the 1983 general election, losing to Roger Gale.

==Legal career==
A member of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, she became a barrister in 1976 and Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1995. Until 1988, her head of chambers was George Carman. In 1999, she was appointed a recorder (a permanent part-time judge) in the County Court and Crown Court.

She was a founding member of Matrix Chambers in London but no longer practises there. Matrix was formed in 2000 specialising in human rights law, though members also practise in a range of areas of UK public and private law, the Law of the European Union and European Convention on Human Rights, in addition to public international law. She is Founder and chair of law firm Omnia Strategy LLP. She specialises in employment, discrimination, as well as public law; in this capacity, she has occasionally represented claimants taking cases against the UK Government.

Blair has appeared in a number of leading cases. A notable example, &quot;Lisa Grant v South West Trains Ltd&quot;, before the European Court of Justice concerned discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.
In January 2010, when sentencing a defendant, Shamso Miah, for assault, Blair announced that she would suspend his prison sentence after describing him as a &quot;religious man&quot;. The court heard that Miah had been to a mosque shortly before he broke a man&#x27;s jaw following a row in a bank queue. Blair told Miah: &quot;You are a religious man and you know this is not acceptable behaviour.&quot; This was interpreted by some observers as special leniency given on account of the criminal&#x27;s religiosity. The Office for Judicial Complaints released an initial statement saying they had &quot;received a number of complaints in relation to the comments&quot; that Blair had made when sentencing Shamso Miah and that the matter was under investigation. On 10 June 2010, the OJC released a statement saying that the investigation had &quot;found that Recorder Booth&#x27;s observations did not constitute judicial misconduct&quot; and accordingly &quot;no disciplinary action is necessary&quot;. A private letter to the National Secular Society said, however, that the OJC had taken action in the form of &quot;informal advice&quot; from a more senior judge.

In 2015, Blair defended Rwandan spy chief Emmanuel Karenzi Karake against accusations that he had conspired to murder three Spanish NGO workers and a Canadian priest. Karake had allegedly done so because the workers knew about the Rwandan Patriotic Front killing Hutu civilians in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Blair launched a company called Mee Healthcare with an American business partner Gail Lese in 2011. In June 2015, it ceased trading and all staff were dismissed without notice.

In 2021, Blair worked as an ethics adviser for Israeli security firm NSO Group.

==Career in academia==
Blair was the third Chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University from 1999 to 2006. On 26 July 2006, she was awarded the honorary title of Emerita Chancellor, as well as the university honorarily naming its new Cherie Booth Building. She is also Governor of the London School of Economics and the Open University. On 2 March 2011, Blair was appointed the Chancellor of the Asian University for Women.

Blair is regularly invited to speak at legal and leadership conferences, and has in the past participated in the World Law Forum, ET Women&#x27;s Forum, Yidan Prize Summit and the Commonwealth Africa Summit, amongst others.

==Honours and charity work==
In July 1999, Blair was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of the University (DUniv) from the Open University. Blair is a patron of Breast Cancer Care, a UK breast cancer information and support charity, Jospice, the international hospice organisation based in her home town of Crosby, and disability charity Scope. She is also involved with the British branch of Child in Need India (CINI UK), and is the organisation&#x27;s patron.

In 2008, she launched her foundation, the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women, a development organisation that aims to support women entrepreneurs in developing countries. &quot;Our mission is to provide women with the skills, technology, networks and access to capital that they need to become successful small and growing business owners, so that they can contribute to their economies and have a stronger voice in their societies,&quot; says its mission statement.

In 2010, Blair spoke at WE Day, an event held by WE Charity as part of their ongoing effort to empower youth and encourage them to get involved in their communities.

Also in 2010, Blair founded the Africa Justice Foundation alongside barristers Suella Braverman and Philip Riches.

She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to women&#x27;s issues and charity.

In June 2018, &quot;Cherie Blair Foundation for Women&quot; was inducted into Power Brands LIFE – Hall of Fame at the London International Forum for Equality.

==Controversies==
In 2002, Blair purchased two flats in Bristol with the assistance, it was alleged but later denied, of Peter Foster, a convicted Australian conman and boyfriend of Blair&#x27;s friend Carole Caplin, who negotiated a discount for Blair. Blair publicly apologised for her embarrassing connection to Foster, stating &quot;I did not think it was my business to choose my friends&#x27; friends&quot;.

Her relationship with Caplin gave rise to headlines in some newspapers, as Caplin is credited with introducing Blair to various New Age symbols and beliefs. Reports of Blair&#x27;s New Age practices included an account of her 2001 holiday in Mexico, when she and her husband, wearing only swimming costumes, privately took part in a rebirthing procedure that involved smearing mud and fruit over each other&#x27;s bodies while sitting in a steam bath.

In 2002, she apologised after saying within hours of a Jerusalem blast that killed at least 19 people in reference to the Palestinian suicide bombers: &quot;As long as young people feel they have no hope but to blow themselves up, we&#x27;re never going to make progress, are we?&quot;

On 12 December 2008, Blair gave a lecture alternatively entitled &quot;The Church and Women&#x27;s Rights: time for a fresh perspective?&quot; or &quot;Religion as a Force in protecting Women&#x27;s Human Rights&quot; at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot;, in Rome.

In summer 2015, in the wake of the Hillary Clinton email controversy, Blair was revealed by &quot;The Guardian&quot; to have lobbied Clinton in 2009 on behalf of prominent members of the Qatari monarchy; Clinton was US Secretary of State at the time. In a letter to the newspaper, Blair denied this characterisation of her mediation efforts, describing their story as &quot;sensationalist and inaccurate&quot;. Precisely two months later, the release of another batch of Clinton&#x27;s private emails confirmed that Blair had, indeed, arranged meetings with Clinton for the Qataris outside normal diplomatic channels, with discussions to involve &quot;the US/Qatar relationship generally&quot;, not merely joint philanthropic efforts. In one case, Blair herself stated that her purpose was to help the eldest of Sheikha Mosah&#x27;s sons, Jassim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, &quot;build up an international profile&quot;.

In summer 2015, Blair&#x27;s law firm accepted a large fee to advise the Maldives government as it faced a challenge from former Maldivian president Mohamed Nasheed over his imprisonment for &quot;terrorism&quot;. Nasheed, who served from 2008 to 2012 as his country&#x27;s first democratically elected leader, had received a 13-year prison sentence after a widely criticised trial.

==Personal life==
===Family===

In 1976, while she was studying to become a barrister, she met future prime minister and husband Tony Blair. She obtained a pupillage in the chambers of Derry Irvine ahead of him, although he was also taken on. Married on 31 March 1980, the Blairs have three sons and one daughter: Euan (born 1984), Nicholas (born 1985), Kathryn (born 1988), and Leo (born 2000).

Leo was the first child born to the wife of a serving British prime minister in over 150 years, since Rollo Russell was born to Lady Frances Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound and Lord John Russell on 11 July 1849. Another pregnancy at the age of 47 ended in miscarriage in early August 2002. The Blair children attended Catholic secondary schools, including The London Oratory School. All four children have Irish passports, by virtue of Tony Blair&#x27;s mother, Hazel Elizabeth Corscadden, a Protestant, the daughter of George Corscadden, a butcher and Orangeman who moved to Glasgow in 1916 but returned to Ballyshannon in 1923, where Hazel was born to George and Sarah Margaret (née Lipsett), above her family&#x27;s grocery shop. Via her father, Blair and her younger sister Lyndsey have six half-sisters, including British journalist Lauren Booth.

Her first grandchild (a girl) was born in October 2016.

===Political and religious views===
Blair has described herself as a socialist and, at times, has appeared to have views further to the left than those of her husband. She is a republican and reportedly chooses to handshake rather than curtsy when meeting royals, including Elizabeth II. According to the royal historian Carolyn Harris, Blair&#x27;s preference for a handshake &quot;attracted controversy as it was seen as making a statement about her republican views&quot;. Elizabeth herself was said to take amusement from Blair&#x27;s refusal to curtsey and has been quoted as stating &quot;I can almost feel Mrs Blair&#x27;s knees stiffening when I come into the room&quot;.

In March 2008, Blair chaired the Street Weapons Commission on behalf of the broadcaster Channel 4. She toured the UK and took evidence from people affected by street crime and published a report and practical advice in June 2008.

She is a practising Roman Catholic. In 2009, Blair urged the Catholic Church to reconsider its opposition to contraception, suggesting it could be holding some women back from pursuing a career.

In George W. Bush&#x27;s 2010 autobiography &quot;Decision Points&quot;, Blair is briefly described as a fierce opponent of the death penalty.

==Writings, portrayals, and coverage in books, film and theatre==
Blair co-authored, with Cate Haste, the 2004 book &quot;The Goldfish Bowl: Married to the Prime Minister&quot;. The book is a compilation history of the lives of spouses of British prime ministers for most of the second half of the 20th century. It covers the spouses of former prime ministers Anthony Eden, Harold Macmillan, Alec Douglas-Home, Harold Wilson, James Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher, and John Major.

Blair wrote a book of her memoirs, published in late May 2008, entitled &quot;Speaking for Myself: The Autobiography&quot;, and the book was listed as a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; best-seller. Interviewed about the book by Carole MacNeil on the Canadian network CBC Television on 1 June 2008, Blair stated that she felt most of the controversy about her in the British media was due to her pioneering role as the first wife of a British prime minister who had her own career, with the media simply not knowing how to treat her fairly and objectively.

Played by Helen McCrory, Blair features as a character in &quot;The Queen&quot; (2006), starring Helen Mirren, about the aftermath of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, and is portrayed as a fierce anti-monarchist. McCrory played her again in the 2010 HBO film &quot;The Special Relationship&quot;. Blair also features as a character in Chris Bush and Ian McCluskey&#x27;s production &quot;TONY! The Blair Musical&quot;. Phoebe Nicholls played her in &quot;The Trial of Tony Blair&quot; (2007). She was also portrayed in the music video of &quot;Shoot the Dog&quot;, a song by George Michael that is critical of Tony Blair and George W. Bush. Blair is portrayed by Lydia Leonard in the fifth and sixth seasons of &quot;The Crown.

In June 2019, Blair signed on as an executive producer for Jerusalem-set drama feature film &quot;The Rock Pile&quot;, a first try into film production for her.

==Recognition==
She was recognised as one of the BBC&#x27;s 100 women of 2013. In 2023, she was awarded the 40 over 40 award by Monaco Voice.

<doc id="271195" wikidata="Q1474701" url="?curid=271195" title="Radio propagation">
<text>Radio propagation is the behavior of radio waves as they travel, or are propagated, from one point to another in vacuum, or into various parts of the atmosphere. As a form of electromagnetic radiation, like light waves, radio waves are affected by the phenomena of reflection, refraction, diffraction, absorption, polarization, and scattering. Understanding the effects of varying conditions on radio propagation has many practical applications, from choosing frequencies for amateur radio communications, international shortwave broadcasters, to designing reliable mobile telephone systems, to radio navigation, to operation of radar systems.

Several different types of propagation are used in practical radio transmission systems. &quot;Line-of-sight propagation&quot; means radio waves which travel in a straight line from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. Line of sight transmission is used for medium-distance radio transmission, such as cell phones, cordless phones, walkie-talkies, wireless networks, FM radio, television broadcasting, radar, and satellite communication (such as satellite television). Line-of-sight transmission on the surface of the Earth is limited to the distance to the visual horizon, which depends on the height of transmitting and receiving antennas. It is the only propagation method possible at microwave frequencies and above.

At lower frequencies in the MF, LF, and VLF bands, diffraction allows radio waves to bend over hills and other obstacles, and travel beyond the horizon, following the contour of the Earth. These are called &quot;surface waves&quot; or &quot;ground wave propagation&quot;. AM broadcast and amateur radio stations use ground waves to cover their listening areas. As the frequency gets lower, the attenuation with distance decreases, so very low frequency (VLF) to extremely low frequency (ELF) ground waves can be used to communicate worldwide. VLF to ELF waves can penetrate significant distances through water and earth, and these frequencies are used for mine communication and military communication with submerged submarines.

At medium wave and shortwave frequencies (MF and HF bands), radio waves can refract from the ionosphere, a layer of charged particles (ions) high in the atmosphere. This means that medium and short radio waves transmitted at an angle into the sky can be refracted back to Earth at great distances beyond the horizon – even transcontinental distances. This is called &quot;skywave propagation&quot;. It is used by amateur radio operators to communicate with operators in distant countries, and by shortwave broadcast stations to transmit internationally.

In addition, there are several less common radio propagation mechanisms, such as &quot;tropospheric scattering&quot; (troposcatter), &quot;tropospheric ducting&quot; (ducting) at VHF frequencies and &quot;near vertical incidence skywave&quot; (NVIS) which are used when HF communications are desired within a few hundred miles.

==Frequency dependence==
At different frequencies, radio waves travel through the atmosphere by different mechanisms or modes:

==Free space propagation==
In free space, all electromagnetic waves (radio, light, X-rays, etc.) obey the inverse-square law which states that the power density formula_1 of an electromagnetic wave is proportional to the inverse of the square of the distance formula_2 from a point source or:

:formula_3

At typical communication distances from a transmitter, the transmitting antenna usually can be approximated by a point source. Doubling the distance of a receiver from a transmitter means that the power density of the radiated wave at that new location is reduced to one-quarter of its previous value.

The power density per surface unit is proportional to the product of the electric and magnetic field strengths. Thus, doubling the propagation path distance from the transmitter reduces each of these received field strengths over a free-space path by one-half.

Radio waves in vacuum travel at the speed of light. The Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is thin enough that radio waves in the atmosphere travel very close to the speed of light, but variations in density and temperature can cause some slight refraction (bending) of waves over distances.

==Direct modes (line-of-sight)==

Line-of-sight refers to radio waves which travel directly in a line from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna, often also called direct-wave. It does not necessarily require a cleared sight path; at lower frequencies radio waves can pass through buildings, foliage and other obstructions. This is the most common propagation mode at VHF and above, and the only possible mode at microwave frequencies and above. On the surface of the Earth, line of sight propagation is limited by the visual horizon to about . This is the method used by cell phones, cordless phones, walkie-talkies, wireless networks, point-to-point microwave radio relay links, FM and television broadcasting and radar. Satellite communication uses longer line-of-sight paths; for example home satellite dishes receive signals from communication satellites above the Earth, and ground stations can communicate with spacecraft billions of miles from Earth.

Ground plane reflection effects are an important factor in VHF line-of-sight propagation. The interference between the direct beam line-of-sight and the ground reflected beam often leads to an effective inverse-fourth-power law for ground-plane limited radiation.

==Surface modes (groundwave)==
Lower frequency (between 30 and 3,000 kHz) vertically polarized radio waves can travel as surface waves following the contour of the Earth; this is called &quot;ground wave&quot; propagation. 

In this mode the radio wave propagates by interacting with the conductive surface of the Earth. The wave &quot;clings&quot; to the surface and thus follows the curvature of the Earth, so ground waves can travel over mountains and beyond the horizon. Ground waves propagate in vertical polarization so vertical antennas (monopoles) are required. Since the ground is not a perfect electrical conductor, ground waves are attenuated as they follow the Earth&#x27;s surface. Attenuation is proportional to frequency, so ground waves are the main mode of propagation at lower frequencies, in the MF, LF and VLF bands. Ground waves are used by radio broadcasting stations in the MF and LF bands, and for time signals and radio navigation systems.

At even lower frequencies, in the VLF to ELF bands, an Earth-ionosphere waveguide mechanism allows even longer range transmission. These frequencies are used for secure military communications. They can also penetrate to a significant depth into seawater, and so are used for one-way military communication to submerged submarines.

Early long-distance radio communication (wireless telegraphy) before the mid-1920s used low frequencies in the longwave bands and relied exclusively on ground-wave propagation. Frequencies above 3 MHz were regarded as useless and were given to hobbyists (radio amateurs). The discovery around 1920 of the ionospheric reflection or skywave mechanism made the medium wave and short wave frequencies useful for long-distance communication and they were allocated to commercial and military users.

==Non-line-of-sight modes==
==Measuring HF propagation==
HF propagation conditions can be simulated using radio propagation models, such as the Voice of America Coverage Analysis Program, and realtime measurements can be done using chirp transmitters. For radio amateurs the WSPR mode provides maps with real time propagation conditions between a network of transmitters and receivers. Even without special beacons the realtime propagation conditions can be measured: A worldwide network of receivers decodes morse code signals on amateur radio frequencies in realtime and provides sophisticated search functions and propagation maps for every station received.

==Practical effects==
The average person can notice the effects of changes in radio propagation in several ways.

In AM broadcasting, the dramatic ionospheric changes that occur overnight in the mediumwave band drive a unique broadcast license scheme in the United States, with entirely different transmitter power output levels and directional antenna patterns to cope with skywave propagation at night. Very few stations are allowed to run without modifications during dark hours, typically only those on clear channels in North America. Many stations have no authorization to run at all outside of daylight hours.

For FM broadcasting (and the few remaining low-band TV stations), weather is the primary cause for changes in VHF propagation, along with some diurnal changes when the sky is mostly without cloud cover. These changes are most obvious during temperature inversions, such as in the late-night and early-morning hours when it is clear, allowing the ground and the air near it to cool more rapidly. This not only causes dew, frost, or fog, but also causes a slight &quot;drag&quot; on the bottom of the radio waves, bending the signals down such that they can follow the Earth&#x27;s curvature over the normal radio horizon. The result is typically several stations being heard from another media market – usually a neighboring one, but sometimes ones from a few hundred kilometers (miles) away. Ice storms are also the result of inversions, but these normally cause more scattered omnidirection propagation, resulting mainly in interference, often among weather radio stations. In late spring and early summer, a combination of other atmospheric factors can occasionally cause skips that duct high-power signals to places well over 1000 km (600 miles) away.

Non-broadcast signals are also affected. Mobile phone signals are in the UHF band, ranging from 700 to over 2600 MHz, a range which makes them even more prone to weather-induced propagation changes. In urban (and to some extent suburban) areas with a high population density, this is partly offset by the use of smaller cells, which use lower effective radiated power and beam tilt to reduce interference, and therefore increase frequency reuse and user capacity. However, since this would not be very cost-effective in more rural areas, these cells are larger and so more likely to cause interference over longer distances when propagation conditions allow.

While this is generally transparent to the user thanks to the way that cellular networks handle cell-to-cell handoffs, when cross-border signals are involved, unexpected charges for international roaming may occur despite not having left the country at all. This often occurs between southern San Diego and northern Tijuana at the western end of the U.S./Mexico border, and between eastern Detroit and western Windsor along the U.S./Canada border. Since signals can travel unobstructed over a body of water far larger than the Detroit River, and cool water temperatures also cause inversions in surface air, this &quot;fringe roaming&quot; sometimes occurs across the Great Lakes, and between islands in the Caribbean. Signals can skip from the Dominican Republic to a mountainside in Puerto Rico and vice versa, or between the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, among others. While unintended cross-border roaming is often automatically removed by mobile phone company billing systems, inter-island roaming is typically not.

==Empirical models==
A radio propagation model, also known as the radio wave propagation model or the radio frequency propagation model, is an empirical mathematical formulation for the characterization of radio wave propagation as a function of frequency, distance and other conditions. A single model is usually developed to predict the behavior of propagation for all similar links under similar constraints. Created with the goal of formalizing the way radio waves are propagated from one place to another, such models typically predict the path loss along a link or the effective coverage area of a transmitter.

The inventor of radio communication, Guglielmo Marconi, before 1900 formulated the first crude empirical rule of radio propagation: the maximum transmission distance varied as the square of the height of the antenna.

As the path loss encountered along any radio link serves as the dominant factor for characterization of propagation for the link, radio propagation models typically focus on realization of the path loss with the auxiliary task of predicting the area of coverage for a transmitter or modeling the distribution of signals over different regions.

Because each individual telecommunication link has to encounter different terrain, path, obstructions, atmospheric conditions and other phenomena, it is intractable to formulate the exact loss for all telecommunication systems in a single mathematical equation. As a result, different models exist for different types of radio links under different conditions. The models rely on computing the median path loss for a link under a certain probability that the considered conditions will occur.

Radio propagation models are empirical in nature, which means, they are developed based on large collections of data collected for the specific scenario. For any model, the collection of data has to be sufficiently large to provide enough likeliness (or enough scope) to all kind of situations that can happen in that specific scenario. Like all empirical models, radio propagation models do not point out the exact behavior of a link, rather, they predict the most likely behavior the link may exhibit under the specified conditions.

Different models have been developed to meet the needs of realizing the propagation behavior in different conditions. Types of models for radio propagation include:

;Models for free space attenuation
* Free-space path loss

<text>Arsacius of Tarsus (; before 324 – 11 November 405) was the intruding archbishop of Constantinople from 404 to 405, after the violent expulsion of John Chrysostom.

== Biography ==
He was the brother of Nectarius of Constantinople, Chrysostom&#x27;s predecessor, and had served as archpresbyter under Chrysostom. In earlier life his brother had selected him for the bishopric of Tarsus and had attributed his refusal to an ambitious design of becoming his successor at Constantinople. On this, Palladius of Galatia asserts, he swore voluntarily that he would never accept the see of Constantinople.

After he had passed his 80th year, the success of the intrigue of Aelia Eudoxia, empress of Roman emperor Arcadius, and Theophilus I of Alexandria, Patriarch of Alexandria, against Chrysostom opened an unexpected way for his elevation to the archiepiscopal throne. Eudoxia and the party now triumphant wanted for their new archbishop a facile tool, under whose authority they might shelter the violence of their proceedings. Such an instrument they had in Arsacius. Moreover, his hostility to Chrysostom had been sufficiently testified at the synod of the Oak, when he appeared as a witness against him and vehemently pressed his condemnation.

He was consecrated archbishop on 27 June 404. Chrysostom, on hearing of it, denounced him &quot;as a spiritual adulterer, and a wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing&quot;. The diocese soon made it plain that they regarded the new archbishop as an intruder. With the exception of a few officials, the dependants of the court party, and the expectants of royal favour, the people of Constantinople refused to attend any religious assembly at which he might be expected to be present. Deserting the sacred edifices, they gathered in the outskirts of the city, and in the open air.

Arsacius appealed to the Roman emperor Arcadius, by whose orders, or rather those of Eudoxia, soldiers were sent to disperse the suburban assemblies. Those who had taken a leading part in them were apprehended and tortured, and a fierce persecution commenced of the adherents of Chrysostom. We learn from Sozomen, that Arsacius was not personally responsible for these cruel deeds; but he lacked strength of character to offer any decided opposition to the proceedings of his clergy. They did what they pleased, and Arsacius bore the blame.

Arsacius&#x27; position became intolerable. In vain all the bishops and clergy who, embracing Chrysostom&#x27;s cause, had refused to recognize him were driven out of the East on 18 November 404. This only spread the evil more widely. The whole Western episcopate refused to acknowledge him, and Pope Innocent I, who had warmly espoused Chrysostom&#x27;s interests, wrote to the clergy and laity of Constantinople strongly condemning the intrusion of Arsacius, and exhorting them to persevere in their adhesion to their true archbishop. It is no cause for surprise that Arsacius&#x27;s episcopate was a brief one and that a feeble character worn out by old age should have soon given way before a storm of opposition so universal.

He died 11 November 405.

== Veneration ==
Arsacius is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church on 11 October. He was venerated in the first millennium.

<text>The following lists events that happened during [[1991]] in [[Afghanistan]].

President Mohammad Najibullah, whom the U.S. government predicted would not last the summer when Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan in February 1989, continues to rule his war-wracked nation from a precarious position. A Moscow-brokered plan calls for Najibullah to step aside in favor of Prime Minister Khaliqyar, who would serve as a transitional administrative leader until a new government could be elected. However, on October 13 moderate guerrilla officials in Pakistan highlight the remaining obstacles to peace by withdrawing their support for Khaliqyar. The &quot;mujaheddin&quot; say his association with Najibullah makes him unacceptable. Afghanistan is like a maimed patient after 13 years of civil war. The streets of Kabul are full of one-legged men, victims of land mines. The government says it has released more than 19,000 prisoners in the past four years and has abolished the special tribunals set up to try those accused of political crimes. Meanwhile, fierce fighting continues between government troops and the Muslim guerrillas. The guerrillas launch their long-planned assault on Najibullah&#x27;s hometown, the garrison town of Gardez in southeastern Afghanistan, and coordinate a series of attacks aimed at demoralizing the Afghan Army and destabilizing the government, but none of the attacks is decisive. In 1991 the guerrillas control 6 of Afghanistan&#x27;s 31 provinces. In their only major gain during the year, they overrun a series of government-held garrisons to gain control of strategic areas along the border with the breakaway Soviet republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. They also hold the narrow corridor linking Afghanistan with China.

==Incumbents==
* President: Mohammad Najibullah
* Chairman of the Council of Ministers: Fazal Haq Khaliqyar
* Vice Presidents: Abdul Rahim Hatif, Mohammed Rafie, Abdul Hamid Mohtat, Abdul Wahed Sorabi and Sultan Ali Keshtmand

== September 1991 ==

Najibullah proposes a five-point peace plan to end the 13-year war that has killed an estimated 1.5 million people and maimed hundreds of thousands of others. The plan calls for an end to weapons shipments to the warring factions, a cease-fire, and an intra-Afghan dialogue leading to the formation of a national unity government mandated to oversee elections. The national unity government would share power with the Pakistan-based government-in-exile, guerrilla commanders, Afghans living in exile, and the deposed king, Zahir Shah. Besides organizing elections, it would rewrite Afghanistan&#x27;s constitution and oversee the return of the more than five million refugees who had fled to Pakistan and Iran. However, the Muslim guerrillas accuse Najibullah of merely repackaging old ideas in order to portray himself as a peacemaker. Most of the guerrillas vow to continue fighting until he is overthrown.

=== September ===

In a surprise move, the government restores the citizenship of Zahir Shah, who has been living in virtual banishment in Italy for 18 years. Nearly 77, Zahir Shah had been overthrown in 1973, and he and his family were stripped of their Afghan citizenship after the Communist revolution of 1978. Zahir Shah is under pressure from the Western countries (including the United States) not to respond to Najibullah&#x27;s call for National Reconciliation because if Zahir Shah returns to Afghanistan and joins the government, most of the traditionalist mujahideen would quit fighting against the government and would probably join the government.

In mid-September the U.S. and the Soviet Union take the first step toward a negotiated settlement by agreeing to end arms shipments to their respective clients, the rebels and the government in Kabul, as of January 1, 1992.

==Sports==
On March 2, 1991, in San Diego, California, Waheed Karim set an Afghan national record in the 5,000 meters (16:04.7).

<text>Dennis Philip Edward Lingwood (26 August 192530 October 2018), known more commonly as Sangharakshita, was a British spiritual teacher and writer. In 1967, he founded the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order (FWBO), which was renamed the Triratna Buddhist Community in 2010.

Sangharakshita was and remains a highly controversial figure. For his supporters, he was a spiritual pioneer who introduced Eastern religious teachings to the West. For his detractors, he was a sexual predator who used his position to abuse vulnerable young men.

==Life==
===Early life===
Sangharakshita was born Dennis Philip Edward Lingwood on 26 August 1925 in Tooting, London. After being diagnosed with a heart condition he spent much of his childhood confined to bed, and used the opportunity to read widely. His first encounter with non-Christian thought was with Madame Helena Blavatsky&#x27;s &quot;Isis Unveiled&quot;, upon reading which, he later said, he realised that he had never been a Christian. The following year he came across two Buddhist texts, the &quot;Diamond Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Platform Sutra&quot;, and concluded that he had always been a Buddhist.

As Dennis Lingwood, he joined the Buddhist Society at the age of 18, and formally became a Buddhist in May 1949 by taking the Three Refuges and Five Precepts from the Burmese monk, U Thittila.

He was conscripted into the army in 1943, and served in India, Ceylon, now known as Sri Lanka, and Singapore as a radio engineer in the Royal Corps of Signals.
It was in Ceylon, while in contact with the swamis in the (Hindu) Ramakrishna Mission, that he developed the desire to become a monk. In 1946, after the cessation of hostilities, he was transferred to Singapore, where he made contact with Buddhists and learned to meditate.

===India===
Having been conscripted into the British Army and posted to India, at the end of the war Sangharakshita handed in his rifle, left the camp where he was stationed and deserted. He moved about in India for a few years, with a Bengali novice Buddhist, the future Buddharakshita, as his companion, meditating and experiencing for himself the company of eminent spiritual personalities of the times, like Mata Anandamayi, Ramana Maharishi and Swamis of Ramakrishna Mission. They spent fifteen months in 1947–48, in the Ramakrishna Mission centre at Muvattupuzha with the consent of Swami Tapasyananda and Swami Agamananda. In May 1949 he became a novice monk, or sramanera, in a ceremony conducted by the Burmese monk, U Chandramani, who was then the most senior monk in India. It was then that he was given the name Sangharakshita (Pali: Sangharakkhita), which means &quot;protected by the spiritual community.&quot; Sangharakshita took full bhikkhu ordination the following year, with another Burmese bhikkhu, U Kawinda, as his preceptor (&quot;upādhyāya&quot;), and with the Ven. Jagdish Kashyap as his teacher (&quot;ācārya&quot;). He studied Pali, Abhidhamma, and Logic with Jagdish Kashyap at Benares (Varanasi) University. In 1950, at Kashyap&#x27;s suggestion, Sangharakshita moved to the hill town of Kalimpong close to the borders of India, Bhutan, Nepal. and Sikkim, and only a few miles from Tibet. Kalimpong was his base for 14 years until his return to England in 1966.

During his time in Kalimpong, Sangharakshita formed a young men&#x27;s Buddhist association and established an ecumenical centre for the practice of Buddhism (the &quot;Triyana Vardhana Vihara&quot;). He also edited the &quot;Maha Bodhi Journal&quot; and established a magazine, &quot;Stepping Stones&quot;. In 1951, Sangharakshita met the German-born Lama Govinda, who was the first Buddhist Sangharakshita had known &quot;to declare openly the compatibility of art with the spiritual life&quot;, and who gave Sangharakshita a greater appreciation for Tibetan Buddhism. Govinda had begun his explorations of Buddhism in the Theravada tradition, studying briefly under the German-born bhikkhu, Nyanatiloka Mahathera (who gave him the name Govinda), but after meeting the Gelug Lama, Tomo Geshe Rinpoche, in 1931, he turned towards Tibetan Buddhism. Sangharakshita&#x27;s spiritual explorations were to follow a similar trajectory.

Sangharakshita was ordained in the Theravada school, but said he became disillusioned by what he felt was the dogmatism, formalism, and nationalism of many of the Theravadin bhikkhus he met and became increasingly influenced by Tibetan Buddhist teachers who had fled Tibet after the Chinese invasion in the 1950s. Two years after his meeting with Lama Govinda he began studying with the Gelug Lama, Dhardo Rinpoche. Sangharakshita also received initiations and teachings from teachers who included Jamyang Khyentse, Dudjom Rinpoche, as well as Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. It was Dhardo Rinpoche who was to give Sangharakshita Mayahana ordination. Later, Sangharakshita also studied with a Ch&#x27;an teacher, Yogi Chen (Chen Chien-Ming), along with another English monk, Bhikkhu Khantipalo. Together, the three men turned their ongoing seminar on Buddhist theory and practice into a book, &quot;Buddhist Meditation, Systematic and Practical&quot;.

Sangharakshita was an associate of B. R. Ambedkar. In 1952, Sangharakshita met Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (1891–1956), the chief architect of the Indian constitution and India&#x27;s first law minister. Ambedkar, who had been a so-called Untouchable, converted to Buddhism, along with 380,000 other Untouchables (now known as &quot;dalits&quot;) on 14 October 1956. Ambedkar and Sangharakshita had been in correspondence since 1950, and the Indian politician had encouraged the young monk to expand his Buddhist activities. Ambedkar appreciated Sangharakshita&#x27;s &quot;commitment to a more critically engaged Buddhism that did not at the same time dilute the cardinal precepts of Buddhist thought&quot;. Ambedkar initially invited Sangharakshita to perform his conversion ceremony, but the latter refused, arguing that U Chandramani should preside. Ambedkar died six weeks later, leaving his conversion movement leaderless, and Sangharakshita, who had just arrived in Nagpur to visit dalit Buddhists, continued what he felt was Ambedkar&#x27;s work by lecturing to former Untouchables, and presiding over a ceremony in which a further 200,000 Untouchables converted. For the next decade, Sangharakshita spent much of his time visiting dalit Buddhist communities in western India.

===Return to the West===
In 1964, Sangharakshita was invited to help with a dispute at the Hampstead Buddhist Vihara in north London, where he proved to be a popular teacher. His ecumenical approach and failure to conform to some of the trustees&#x27; expectations was said to contrast with the strict Theravadin-style Buddhism at the vihara. Although originally planning to stay only six months, he decided to settle in England, but after he returned to India for a farewell tour, the Vihara&#x27;s trustees voted to expel him.

Sangharakshita returned to England and in April 1967 founded the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order. The Western Buddhist Order was founded a year later, when he ordained the first dozen men and women. The first ordinations were attended by a Zen monk, a Shin priest and two Theravadin monks.

Satisfied neither with the lay-Buddhist approach of the Buddhist Society, nor the monastic approach of the Hampstead vihara—the two dominant Buddhist organisations in Britain at that time—he created what he said was a new form of Buddhism. The order would be neither lay nor monastic, and members take a set of ten precepts that are a traditional part of Mahayana Buddhism.

Initially, Sangharakshita led all classes and conducted all ordinations. He gave lectures drawing on what he felt were the essential teachings of all the major Buddhist schools. He led major retreats twice a year and frequent day and weekend events. As the order grew, and centres became established across Britain and in other countries, order members took more responsibility until, in August 2000, he devolved his responsibilities as the head of the Western Buddhist Order to eight men and women who formed what was called the &quot;College of Public Preceptors.&quot; In 2005 Sangharakshita donated all of his books and artefacts, with an insurance value of £314,400, to the charitable trust dedicated to his &#x27;support and assistance&#x27; as well as enabling his office to &#x27;maintain contact with his disciples and friends worldwide&#x27; and to &#x27;support them in activities&#x27;. In 2015 this trust had an income of £140K, and for 2016 it was £73K.

Sangharakshita died of pneumonia and sepsis on 30 October 2018, at the age of 93.

==Allegations of sexual coercion and abuse==

In 1997, Sangharakshita became the focus of controversy when &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper published complaints concerning some of his sexual relationships with FWBO members during the 1970s and 1980s. For a decade following these public revelations, he declined to give any response to concerns from within the movement that he had misused his position as a Buddhist teacher to exploit young men sexually. In 2010, it was reported that he had addressed the controversy, stressing that his sexual partners were, or appeared to be, willing, and he expressed regret for any mistakes. In 2016 a local BBC channel showed a report based on interviews with three men, one under the age of homosexual consent at the time (twenty-one), who claimed they had been pressured into having sex with Sangharakshita, being told it would help them “make spiritual progress” to have homosexual sex despite being heterosexual. In 2017 the Triratna Buddhist Order hired an accredited facilitator to work directly with any individuals feeling harmed as a result of past sexual involvement with Sangharakshita. In 2020, a group within the Order published a report resulting from investigations into these allegations aiming to &quot;establish the facts related to Sangharakshita&#x27;s sexual behaviour&quot;. The report included acknowledgements that Sangharakshita did &quot;not always recognise the power imbalance between student and teacher&quot; and that he &quot;was not always willing or able to have meaningful dialogue after the sexual involvement had ended&quot;.

==Contributions and legacy==
Sangharakshita has been described as &quot;among the first Westerners who devoted their life to the practice as well as the spreading of Buddhism&quot; and also as a &quot;prolific writer, translator, and practitioner of Buddhism&quot;. As a Westerner seeking to use Western concepts to communicate Buddhism, he has been compared to Teilhard de Chardin, termed &quot;the founding father of Western Buddhism,&quot; and noted as &quot;a skilled innovator in his efforts to translate Buddhism to the West.&quot;

For Sangharakshita, as with other Buddhists, the factor that unites all Buddhist schools is not any particular teaching but the act of &quot;going for refuge&quot; (&quot;sarana-gamana&quot;), which he regards &quot;not simply as a formula but as a life-changing event&quot; and as an ongoing &quot;reorientation of one&#x27;s life away from mundane concerns to the values embodied in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.&quot; Any decisive act upon the spiritual path—renunciation, ordination, initiation, the attainment of Stream Entry, and the arising of the bodhicitta—are manifestations or examples of Going for Refuge.

Buddhist teachers are traditionally authorised through a lineage traced back to The Buddha Siddhartha Gautama. Although Sangharakshita studied under various eminent Buddhist teachers during his two decades in India, author James William Coleman has noted that &quot;he never worked closely enough with any teacher to be recognized as a dharma-heir&quot;.

Sangharakshita has acknowledged that “Triratna sometimes bears the mark not of the dharma but of my own particular personality”. Among his distinctive views is his use of the scientific theory of evolution as a metaphor for spiritual development, referring to biological evolution as the &quot;lower evolution&quot; and spiritual growth as being a form of self-directed &quot;higher evolution&quot;. Though he considers women and men equally capable of Enlightenment and ordained them equally right from the start, he has also said he had &quot;tentatively reached the conclusion that the spiritual life is more difficult for women because they are less able than men to envisage...something purely transcendental...&quot; He also criticised heterosexual nuclear relationships as tending to neuroticism. The FWBO has been accused of cult-like behaviour in the 1970s and 80s for encouraging heterosexual men to engage in sexual relationships with men in order to get over their fear of intimacy with men and obtain spiritual growth. He has drawn parallels between Buddhism and the spirit of the Romantics, who believed that what art reveals has great moral and spiritual significance, and has written of &quot;the religion of art.&quot;

Including compilations of his talks, Sangharakshita has authored more than 60 books. Meanwhile, the Triratna Buddhist Community, which he founded as the FWBO, has been described as &quot;perhaps the most successful attempt to create an ecumenical international Buddhist organization&quot;. The community is one of the three largest Buddhist movements in Britain, and has a presence in Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Africa. More than a fifth of all Order members, as of 2006, were in India, where Dr. Ambedkar&#x27;s mission to convert Dalits to Buddhism continues. Martin Baumann, a scholar of Buddhism, has estimated that there are 100,000 people worldwide who are affiliated with the Triratna Buddhist Community.

For Buddhologist Francis Brassard, Sangharakshita&#x27;s major contribution is &quot;without doubt his attempt to translate the ideas and practices of [Buddhism] into Western languages.&quot; The non-denominational nature of the Triratna Buddhist Community, its equal ordination for both men and women, and its evolution of new forms of shared practice, such as what it calls team-based right livelihood projects, have been cited as examples of such &quot;translation&quot;, and also as the creation of a &quot;Buddhist society in miniature within the Western, industrialized world&quot;. For Martin Baumann, the Triratna Buddhist Community serves as proof that &quot;Western concepts, such as a capitalistic work ethos, ecological considerations, and a social-reformist perspective, can be integrated into the Buddhist tradition&quot;.

<doc id="271261" wikidata="Q713489" url="?curid=271261" title="David Kelly (weapons expert)">
<text>David Christopher Kelly (14 May 1944 – 17 July 2003) was a Welsh scientist and authority on biological warfare (BW). A former head of the Defence Microbiology Division working at Porton Down, Kelly was part of a joint US-UK team that inspected civilian biotechnology facilities in Russia in the early 1990s and concluded they were running a covert and illegal BW programme. He was appointed to the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in 1991 as one of its chief weapons inspectors in Iraq and led ten of the organisation&#x27;s missions between May 1991 and December 1998. He also worked with UNSCOM&#x27;s successor, the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and led several of their missions into Iraq. During his time with UNMOVIC he was key in uncovering the anthrax production programme at the Salman Pak facility, and a BW programme run at Al Hakum.

A year after the publication of the 2002 dossier on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction—which stated that some of Iraq&#x27;s chemical and biological weapons were deployable within 45 minutes—Kelly had an off-the-record conversation with Andrew Gilligan, a BBC journalist, about the claim. When Gilligan reported this on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme, he stated that the &quot;45 minutes&quot; claim was included at the insistence of Alastair Campbell, the Downing Street Director of Communications; Kelly denied that he said Campbell had forced in the reference. The government complained to the BBC about the claim, but they refused to recant on it; political tumult between Downing Street and the BBC developed. Kelly informed his line managers in the Ministry of Defence that he might have been the source, but did not think he was the only one, as Gilligan had reported points he had not mentioned. Kelly&#x27;s name became known to the media, and he was called to appear on 15 July before the parliamentary Intelligence and Security and Foreign Affairs select committees. Two days later Kelly was found dead near his home, having killed himself.

Following Kelly&#x27;s suicide Tony Blair, the prime minister, set up a government inquiry under Lord Hutton, a former Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. The inquiry concluded that Kelly had killed himself. Hutton also stated that no other parties were involved in Kelly&#x27;s death. There was continued debate over the manner of Kelly&#x27;s death, and the case was reviewed between 2010 and 2011 by Dominic Grieve, the attorney general; he concluded that there was &quot;overwhelmingly strong&quot; evidence that Kelly had killed himself. The post-mortem and toxicology reports were released in 2010; both documents supported the conclusion of the Hutton Inquiry. The manner of Kelly&#x27;s death has been the subject of several documentaries and has been fictionalised on television, on stage and in print. He was appointed as Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1994 and might well have been under consideration for a knighthood in May 2003, according to Hutton. His work in Iraq earned him a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize.

==Biography==
===Early life, education and first jobs: 1944–1984===

David Christopher Kelly was born in Llwynypia, Glamorgan, South Wales, on 14 May 1944. His parents were Thomas John Kelly and Margaret, &quot; Williams; Thomas was a schoolteacher who was serving in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve as a signals officer during the Second World War. Thomas and Margaret divorced in 1951; she took their young son and moved in with her parents in Pontypridd. From the age of eleven he attended the local grammar school. He was a keen sportsman and musician at school, and represented Wales in the youth cross-country running team; he played double bass in the National Youth Orchestra of Wales and played the saxophone to a high standard.

In 1963 Kelly was admitted to the University of Leeds to study chemistry, botany and biophysics. His mother died two years later from an overdose of prescription barbiturates. Although the coroner&#x27;s inquest gave an open verdict, Kelly believed she had killed herself. As a result of the death, Kelly suffered from insomnia and was prescribed sleeping pills; he was also given an extra year to complete his degree. He graduated in 1967 with a BSc in bacteriology; he then obtained an MSc in virology from the University of Birmingham. Between his first and second degrees, on 15 July 1967, he married Janice, &quot; Vawdrey, who was studying at Bingley Teacher Training College.

Kelly joined the Insect Pathology Unit at the University of Oxford in 1968, while a student of Linacre College. In 1971 he received his doctorate in microbiology; his thesis was &quot;The Replication of Some Iridescent Viruses in Cell Cultures&quot;. In the early 1970s he undertook postdoctoral research at the University of Warwick, before moving back to Oxford in the mid-1970s to work at the Institute of Virology and Environmental Microbiology. There he carried out virology research into pests such as &quot;Spodoptera&quot; and &quot;Aedes&quot;. He rose to the position of chief scientific officer; much of his work was in the field of insect viruses.

===Porton Down, Russia and Iraq: 1984–2003===

In 1984 Kelly joined the Ministry of Defence (MoD) as the head of the Defence Microbiology Division working at Porton Down, Wiltshire. The department had only a small number of microbiologists when he arrived, and most of their work involved the decontamination of Gruinard Island, which had been used during the Second World War for experiments with weaponised anthrax. He increased the scope of his department, obtaining additional funding to undertake research into biodefence. Because of the work undertaken by Kelly and his team, the UK were able to deploy a biodefence capability during the 1990–1991 Gulf War.

====Russia: 1991–1994====
In 1989 Vladimir Pasechnik, the senior Soviet biologist and bioweapons developer, defected to the UK and provided intelligence about the clandestine biological warfare (BW) programme, Biopreparat. The programme was in contravention of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention which banned the production of chemical and biological weapons. Pasechnik was debriefed by the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS), who requested technical assistance to process the information on chemical and biological matters; Kelly was seconded to the DIS to assist with his colleagues Brian Jones and Christopher Davis. They debriefed Pasechnik over a period of three years.

Kelly undertook several visits to Russia between 1991 and 1994 as the co-lead of a team from the UK and US which inspected civilian biotechnology facilities in Russia. One of the restrictions placed on the inspectors was that visits could only be to non-military installations, so, for the first visit in January 1991, the team visited the Institute of Engineering Immunology, in Lyubuchany; the State Research Centre for Applied Microbiology in Obolensk; the Vector State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology in Koltsovo; and the Institute of Ultrapure Preparations, in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). The Russians obstructed the team and tried to stop inspection of key areas of the facilities; they also lied about the use to which parts of the installations were put. On one visit to the Vector facility, Kelly had a conversation with a laboratory assistant—one who was too low grade to have been fully briefed by the KGB. Kelly asked the assistant about the work he was doing, and was surprised when the man said he was involved in testing smallpox. Kelly questioned Lev Sandakchiev, the head of Vector, about the use of smallpox, but received no answers. Kelly described the questioning sessions as &quot;a very tense moment&quot;.

In a 2002 review of the verification process, Kelly wrote:

The visits did not go without incident. At Obolensk, access to parts of the main research facility—notably the dynamic aerosol test chambers and the plague research laboratories—was denied on the spurious grounds of quarantine requirements. Skirmishes occurred over access to an explosive aerosol chamber because the officials knew that closer examination would reveal damning evidence of offensive BW activities. At Koltsova access was again difficult and problematic. The most serious incident was when senior officials contradicted an admission by technical staff that research on smallpox was being conducted there. The officials were unable to properly account for the presence of smallpox and for the research being undertaken in a dynamic aerosol test chamber on orthopoxvirus, which was capable of explosive dispersal. At the Institute of Ultrapure Preparations in Leningrad (Pasechnik&#x27;s former workplace), dynamic and explosive test chambers were passed off as being for agricultural projects, contained milling machines were described as being for the grinding of salt, and studies on plague, especially production of the agent, were misrepresented. Candid and credible accounts of many of the activities at these facilities were not provided.

Two official reports of the visit concluded that Soviets were running a covert and illegal BW programme. Kelly also took part in reciprocal visits to the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Maryland, and visits to Porton Down by Russian and American inspectors. Despite their findings, Kelly concluded that the tripartite inspection programme had failed. It was, he said, &quot;too ambitious; its disarmament objective deflected by issues of reciprocity and access to sites outside the territories of the three parties&quot;. He went on to add that &quot;Russia&#x27;s refusal to provide a complete account of its past and current BW activity and the inability of the American–British teams to gain access to Soviet/Russian military industrial facilities were significant contributory factors&quot;.

====Iraq: 1991 – May 2003====
====Appointment to UNSCOM====
Following the end of the Gulf War, United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 imposed the articles of Iraq&#x27;s surrender. The document stated &quot;that Iraq shall unconditionally accept the destruction, removal, or rendering harmless, under international supervision, of ... All chemical and biological weapons&quot;. This was to be made possible by &quot;The forming of a special commission which shall carry out immediate on-site inspection of Iraq&#x27;s biological, chemical and missile capabilities, based on Iraq&#x27;s declarations and the designation of any additional locations by the special commission itself&quot;. The group set up was the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), and Kelly was appointed to it in 1991 as one of its chief weapons inspectors in Iraq. The Iraqis had provided Rolf Ekéus, the director of UNSCOM, with a list of sites connected with the research and production of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in the country, about half of which had been bombed during Operation Desert Storm. These sites provided the starting point for the investigations. In August 1991 Kelly led the first group of UN BW investigators into the country. When asked where the inspection teams would visit, he told reporters &quot;We will go to sites which we deem to have characteristics associated with biological activity, but at the moment ... I have an open mind.&quot; The first UNSCOM missions finished with no evidence found of an Iraqi biological or chemical programme, although they did establish that some sites suspected by US intelligence services of involvement in biological or chemical warfare research were legitimate. These included a bakery, a pharmaceutical research business in Samarra, a dairy and a slaughterhouse.

UNSCOM undertook 261 inspection missions to Iraq between May 1991 and December 1998, 74 of which were for biological weapons. Kelly led ten of the missions involved in BW inspections. In 1998 and 1999 Iraq refused to deal with UNSCOM or the inspectors; the country&#x27;s president, Saddam Hussein, singled out Kelly by name for expulsion from the country. During an inspection mission to Iraq in 1998, Kelly worked alongside an American translator and US Air Force officer, Mai Pederson, who introduced him to the Baháʼí Faith. Kelly remained a member of the faith for the rest of his life, attending spiritual meetings near his home of Southmoor, Oxfordshire. He was, for a time, the treasurer of his local branch, based in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. His time in Iraq left him with a deep affection for the country, its people and culture, although he abhorred Saddam&#x27;s government.

====British dossier on Iraqi WMD====
In 2000 UNSCOM was replaced by the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), whose mission and aims were similar to that of UNSCOM: to remove Iraqi WMDs and &quot;to operate a system of ongoing monitoring and verification to check Iraq&#x27;s compliance with its obligations not to reacquire the same weapons prohibited to it by the Security Council&quot;.

Kelly returned to work as a government advisor with the MoD on biological warfare, but also worked with UNMOVIC and continued to visit Iraq. He was involved in at least 36 missions to Iraq as part of UNSCOM and UNMOVIC, and, despite interference and obstruction tactics by the Iraqis, was instrumental in making the breakthrough to discover Iraq&#x27;s BW facilities: the anthrax production programme at the Salman Pak facility and a BW programme run at Al Hakum.
In his 2002 State of the Union address, George W. Bush, the president of the United States, discussed the use of WMD by the Iraqi regime. Later that year he reaffirmed that &quot;the stated policy of the United States is regime change&quot;. As part of the British government&#x27;s arguments for war on Saddam, Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, instructed the publication of a dossier on Iraqi WMD on 24 September 2002. The dossier, which was &quot;based, in large part, on the work of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC)&quot;, included the statement that the Iraqi government had:

* continued to produce chemical and biological agents;
* military plans for the use of chemical and biological weapons, including against its own Shia population. Some of these weapons are deployable within 45 minutes of an order to use them;
* command and control arrangements in place to use chemical and biological weapons. Authority ultimately resides with Saddam Hussein.

Before its publication, Kelly had been shown a draft copy of the dossier and took part in a meeting at the DIS to review it. Four pages of comments were made regarding the information in the report, of which Kelly contributed twelve individual statements. The observations from the DIS were passed up to the Joint Intelligence Organisation; none of the observations referred to the 45-minute claim.

On 8 November 2002 the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1441, &quot;a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations under relevant resolutions of the Council; and accordingly decides to set up an enhanced inspection regime with the aim of bringing to full and verified completion the disarmament process&quot;. The resolution stated that the Iraqi government needed to provide full details of its WMD programme within 30 days. As a result of the increasing pressure on the Iraqi government, UNSCOM inspectors were readmitted to the country and were provided information on the Iraqi WMD programme. According to Kelly, despite the steps taken, Saddam &quot;refuse[d] to acknowledge the extent of his chemical and biological weapons and associated military and industrial support organisations&quot;, and there was still a concern about &quot;8,500 litres of anthrax VX, 2,160 kilograms of bacterial growth media, 360 tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agent, 6,500 chemical bombs and 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical and biological warfare agents [which] remained unaccounted for from activities up to 1991&quot;.

In February 2003 Colin Powell, the US Secretary of State, addressed the United Nations Security Council to discuss Iraq&#x27;s WMD. He included information on mobile weapons laboratories, which he described as &quot;trucks and train cars ... easily moved and ... designed to evade detection by inspectors. In a matter of months, they can produce a quantity of biological poison equal to the entire amount that Iraq claimed to have produced in the years prior to the Gulf War.&quot; Following his examination of the vehicles in question, Kelly spoke, off the record, to journalists from &quot;The Observer&quot;. In their article in the newspaper on 15 June 2003 they described him as &quot;a British scientist and biological weapons expert&quot;, and quoted him as saying:

They are not mobile germ warfare laboratories. You could not use them for making biological weapons. They do not even look like them. They are exactly what the Iraqis said they were—facilities for the production of hydrogen gas to fill balloons.

One of the journalists who wrote the story, Peter Beaumont, confirmed to the Hutton Inquiry that Kelly was the source of this quote. Kelly was often approached by the press and would either clear the discussion with the press office of the FCO, or use his judgement before doing so; it was within his remit to liaise with the media. Shortly before the 2003 invasion of Iraq (20 March – 1 May 2003) Kelly anonymously wrote an article on the threat from Saddam which was never published. He outlined his thoughts on the build-up to war:

Iraq has spent the past 30 years building up an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Although the current threat presented by Iraq militarily is modest, both in terms of conventional and unconventional weapons, it has never given up its intent to develop and stockpile such weapons for both military and terrorist use.

He continued that &quot;The long-term threat, however, remains Iraq&#x27;s development to military maturity of weapons of mass destruction—something that only regime change will avert.&quot; On 20 March 2003 British and American troops entered Iraq to bring about the regime change. Most of the country was occupied and Saddam was overthrown within four weeks; Bush stated that war was over on 1 May 2003. On 7 May 2003 Kelly was telephoned by Susan Watts, the science editor of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme; the call lasted 15 to 20 minutes. They discussed various matters relating to Iraq including, towards the end of the conversation, the matter of the 45-minute claim. Watts&#x27;s handwritten shorthand notes showed Kelly stated the claim was &quot;a mistake to put in. Alastair Campbell seeing something in there, single source but not corroborated, sounded good.&quot; The pair also had a subsequent call on 12 May. Kelly flew to Kuwait on 19 May as part of a military team. He hoped to meet members of the Iraq Survey Group to see how the organisation worked. When he arrived in Kuwait he found that no visa had been arranged for him, so he returned home.

====Contact with Andrew Gilligan====

On 22 May 2003 Kelly met Andrew Gilligan, the Defence and Diplomatic Correspondent for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme, at the Charing Cross Hotel, London. It was the third time the pair had met. The meeting, initiated by Gilligan, was for the journalist to ask why Kelly thought WMDs had not been discovered in Iraq by the British and American troops. According to Gilligan, after 30 minutes the conversation focussed on the September Dossier and how key areas of the document were altered to give greater impact to the public. Gilligan took notes on an electronic organiser; he said these read as

Transformed week before publication to make it sexier. The classic was the 45 minutes. Most things in dossier were double source but that was single source. One source said it took 4 [that should be 45] minutes to set up a missile assembly, that was misinterpreted. Most people in intelligence weren&#x27;t happy with it because it didn&#x27;t reflect the considered view they were putting forward. Campbell: real information but unreliable, included against our wishes. Not in original draft - dull, he asked if anything else could go in.

Soon after the meeting, Gilligan claimed, he wrote a full script of the interview, based on his memory and notes. Between the completion of the document and the start of the Hutton Inquiry in August, Gilligan says he lost that script. Kelly was in New York on 29 May 2003, attending the final commissioners&#x27; meeting of UNMOVIC under the leadership of Hans Blix. At 6.07 that morning, on the &quot;Today&quot; programme, Gilligan explained to the programme&#x27;s host, John Humphrys, what he would be discussing later in the programme:

what we&#x27;ve been told by one of the senior officials in charge of drawing up that dossier was that, actually the government probably erm, knew that that forty five minute figure was wrong, even before it decided to put it in. What this person says, is that a week before the publication date of the dossier, it was actually rather erm, a bland production. It didn&#x27;t, the, the draft prepared for Mr Blair by the Intelligence Agencies actually didn&#x27;t say very much more than was public knowledge already and erm, Downing Street, our source says, ordered a week before publication, ordered it to be sexed up, to be made more exciting and ordered more facts to be er, to be discovered.

Gilligan had not been able to get confirmation from any other sources about the veracity of the claim. The producer of &quot;Today&quot;, Kevin Marsh, writes that Gilligan went off his pre-prepared script. With news based on an anonymous single source, stories &quot;have to be reported word perfectly&quot; to be precise about the meaning; according to Marsh, &quot;Gilligan had lost control of that precision&quot;. Downing Street had not been forewarned of the story, or been contacted to ask for a statement. At 7:32 am the government press office issued a statement to refute the story: &quot;Not one word of the dossier was not entirely the work of the intelligence agencies&quot;. Gilligan then broadcast a report for the BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast programme in which he repeated the claim that the government had inserted the 45-minute claim into the dossier. Kelly did not recognise himself from Gilligan&#x27;s description of a &quot;senior official in charge of drawing up the document&quot;; Kelly had taken no part in drafting the document and had only been asked for comments on the contents.

The following day Watts telephoned Kelly at home to discuss the quotes on the &quot;Today&quot; programme; she recorded the call. When she asked him if he was being questioned about the identity of the source, Kelly replied &quot;I mean they wouldn&#x27;t think it was me, I don&#x27;t think. Maybe they would, maybe they wouldn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know&quot;. Their conversation also included the possible involvement of Campbell in the inclusion of the 45-minute claim in the dossier:

SW OK just back momentarily on the 45 minute issue I&#x27;m feeling like I ought to just explore that a little bit more with you the um err. So would it be accurate then, as you did in that earlier conversation, to say that it was Alastair Campbell himself who...
DK No I can&#x27;t. All I can say is the Number Ten press office. I&#x27;ve never met Alastair Campbell so I can&#x27;t ... But I think Alastair Campbell is synonymous with that press office because he&#x27;s responsible for it.
Despite the denial from the government, on 1 June—the day after Kelly and Watts had spoken on the telephone—Gilligan wrote an article for &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; in which he specifically named Campbell; it was titled: &quot;I asked my intelligence source why Blair misled us all over Saddam&#x27;s weapons. His reply? One word ... CAMPBELL&quot;. According to the journalist Miles Goslett, the report on the &quot;Today&quot; programme &quot;caused little more than a ripple&quot; of interest; the newspaper article &quot;was of major international significance. It was career-threatening for all concerned if substantiated&quot;.

As political tumult between Downing Street and the BBC developed, Kelly alerted his line manager at the MoD, Bryan Wells, that he had met Gilligan and discussed, among other points, the 45-minute claim. In a detailed letter of 30 June, Kelly stated that any mention of Campbell had been raised by Gilligan, not himself, and that this was an aside. Kelly stated that &quot;I did not even consider that I was the &#x27;source&#x27; of Gilligan&#x27;s information&quot;; he only became aware of the possibility after Gilligan had appeared at the Foreign Affairs Select Committee on 19 June. Kelly said of Gilligan&#x27;s evidence that &quot;The description of that meeting in small part matches my interaction with him especially my personal evaluation of Iraq&#x27;s capability but the overall character is quite different&quot;. In closing, he reiterated that &quot;With hindsight I of course deeply regret talking to Andrew Gilligan even though I am convinced that I am not his primary source of information.&quot;
Kelly was interviewed twice by his employers—on 3 and 7 July; they concluded that he may have been Gilligan&#x27;s source, but that Gilligan may have exaggerated what Kelly said. A decision was taken that no official action was to be taken against Kelly. He was also advised that, with journalists pressing for further information, it was possible his name would emerge in press reports. Reports in &quot;The Times&quot; by the journalist Tom Baldwin on 5 and 8 July gave significant hints on the identity of Gilligan&#x27;s source. At a meeting chaired by Blair on 8 July it was agreed that a statement should be released that stated a member of the MoD had come forward to say that he was the source. It was also agreed that Kelly&#x27;s name would not be released to journalists, but if someone guessed who it was, they were allowed to confirm it. Kevin Tebbit, the permanent secretary at the MoD—Kelly&#x27;s ultimate superior at the department—arrived at the end of the meeting and was unable to provide any input. At 5:54 pm on 8 July the government statement was released. Without naming Kelly, it said a member of the MoD had come forward to admit that he had met Gilligan at an unauthorised meeting a week before Gilligan&#x27;s broadcast. The statement said that this MoD employee was not in a position to comment on Campbell&#x27;s role in the 45 minute issue as he had not helped draw up the intelligence report and had not seen it. At 5:50 pm the following day a journalist from &quot;The Financial Times&quot; guessed Kelly&#x27;s name correctly; a journalist from &quot;The Times&quot; did so soon afterwards after nineteen failed guesses.

On the evening of 8 July Nick Rufford, a journalist with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; who had known Kelly for five years, visited him at home in Southmoor. Rufford told him that his name would be published in the papers the following day. He advised Kelly to leave his home that night to avoid the media, and said the newspaper would put Kelly and his wife up at a hotel. Soon after Rufford left he contacted the MoD and asked if Kelly could write a piece for the paper putting forward his version of events; the MoD press office said this was unlikely. Soon afterwards the MoD phoned Kelly and advised him to find somewhere else to stay the night. According to Mrs Kelly, the couple left the house within 15 minutes and drove to Cornwall, breaking the journey overnight in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, where they arrived by 9:45 pm. Although the trip to Cornwall was described by Mrs Kelly at the Hutton Inquiry, Baker considers that there are &quot;problems with the version of events we are asked to accept&quot;; Goslett writes that Kelly played cribbage with a pub team in Kingston Bagpuize that night and was there until at least 10:30 pm. None of those on Kelly&#x27;s cribbage team were asked to give evidence to the Hutton Inquiry.

While in Cornwall, on the morning of 11 July, Kelly had a telephone call from Bryan Wells to tell him that he would have to appear in front of the Intelligence and Security and Foreign Affairs select committees. He was told that the latter of these would be televised, something that upset him greatly, according to his wife. That afternoon, still unhappy with the news from the earlier phone call, he spoke to Wells again nine times. They agreed to meet on Monday 14 July to prepare for the interviews. Kelly returned from Cornwall on 13 July and stayed in Oxford at his daughter Rachel&#x27;s house.

====Appearance before House of Commons committees====

Kelly&#x27;s appearance before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee was against the advice of Tebbit, the most senior civil servant at the MoD. He had been overruled by Geoff Hoon, the secretary of state for defence. Kelly appeared in front of the committee on 15 July in a session that lasted over an hour. He spoke so softly the fans in the room were turned off so the committee members could hear him reply; according to Baker, &quot;Every word [from Kelly] was weighed carefully and some painful circumlocutions resulted&quot;. Kelly told the committee that he had met Gilligan but, as the journalist Tom Mangold, in Kelly&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; writes, &quot;denied that he had said the things Gilligan reported his source as having said&quot;.

Kelly was questioned by the Liberal Democrat MP David Chidgey about conversations with Susan Watts. It was the first time her name had been connected with Kelly in public, and it was later established that Gilligan had not only sent Chidgey excerpts from a recorded conversation, but also gave Chidgey questions to ask Kelly. The quote included Kelly&#x27;s opinion on the 45 minute claim. The quote read out by Chidgey included: &quot;The 45 minutes was a statement that was made and it got out of all proportion. They were desperate for information. They were pushing hard for information that could be released. That was one that popped up and it was seized on and it is unfortunate that it was.&quot; Chidgey asked Kelly if the quotes came from the meeting he had with Watts in November 2002—the only time the pair had met face-to-face; Kelly replied that &quot;I cannot believe that on that occasion I made that statement&quot;. According to Goslett, this was a truthful statement, as Kelly had not made the statement in November 2002, but on 30 May that year. Mangold notes that Kelly appeared to be under stress during the interview, and that some of the questioning was overtly hostile. One Labour MP, Andrew MacKinlay, questioned Kelly towards the end of the session:

Andrew MacKinlay: I reckon you are chaff; you have been thrown up to divert our probing. Have you ever felt like a fall-guy? You have been set up, have you not?

Dr Kelly: That is not a question I can answer.

Andrew MacKinlay: But you feel that?

Dr Kelly: No, not at all. I accept the process that is going on.

After the hearing Kelly described MacKinlay to his daughter as an &quot;utter bastard&quot;.

On the following day, 16 July 2003, Kelly gave evidence to the Intelligence and Security Committee. He appeared more relaxed than he had in front of the Foreign Affairs Committee, according to Baker. When asked, Kelly described the September dossier as &quot;an accurate document, I think it is a fair reflection of the intelligence that was available and it&#x27;s presented in a very sober and factual way.&quot;

===Death: 17 July 2003===
On the morning of 17 July Kelly worked from his home in Southmoor, answering written parliamentary questions from two MPs—MacKinlay on the identity of the journalists Kelly had spoken to, and the Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin on Kelly&#x27;s discussions with Gilligan and whether he would be disciplined for it; Kelly had to provide the information to the MoD to forward on. He had a telephone call with Wing Commander John Clark, a friend and colleague, during which they discussed the general situation Kelly was in, as well as a trip to Iraq on which Kelly was due to go in the following week. Clark reported that Kelly seemed to be &quot;very tired, but in good spirits&quot;. He had received several emails from well-wishers, including from &quot;The New York Times&quot; journalist Judith Miller, to which he replied &quot;I will wait until the end of the week before judging—many dark actors playing games. Thanks for your support.&quot;

During the course of the day Kelly received a phone call that changed his mood. Mangold states that &quot;[the] most likely explanation is that he learned from a well-meaning friend at the Ministry of Defence that the BBC had tape-recorded evidence which, when published, would show that he had indeed said the things to Susan Watts that he had formally denied saying&quot;. Mrs Kelly was ill that day and spent some time lying down in the couple&#x27;s bedroom, but she got up at 3:00 pm to find Kelly speaking on the phone, before she returned to her bedroom to sleep. Goslett thinks this phone call is likely to have been with Clark, in a discussion about one of the answers to the parliamentary questions. Kelly left for a walk between 3:00 and 3:20 pm and was last seen by Ruth Absalom, a neighbour, with whom he stopped to have a chat. She was the last person known to have seen him alive. Clark tried to contact Kelly at home—where Mrs Kelly told him that her husband had gone for a walk—and then on Kelly&#x27;s mobile, which was switched off; Clark stated he was surprised it was off as Kelly was normally easily contactable.

As far as it is known, Kelly walked a mile (1.6 km) from his house to Harrowdown Hill. It appears he ingested up to 29 tablets of co-proxamol, an analgesic drug; he also cut his left wrist with a pruning knife he had owned since his youth, severing his ulnar artery. Forensic analysis established that neither the knife nor the blister packs showed Kelly&#x27;s fingerprints on their surfaces.

Rachel Kelly spoke to her mother in the late afternoon, then drove to her parents&#x27; house at around 6:00 pm. As her father had not returned, Rachel walked a route along a footpath her father was known to use regularly to try and find him; she returned to the house at around 6:30 pm, then drove round to see if she could find anything. Sian, the Kellys&#x27; eldest daughter, also came to the house that night, and at 11:40 pm they phoned the police. Three officers from the local station in Abingdon arrived within 15 minutes; they searched the house and garden straight away. By 1:00 am a search helicopter from RAF Benson, fitted with thermal imaging equipment, had been requested; teams of search dogs were also provided and a 26-metre (85 ft) communications mast was erected, as the Kellys&#x27; home was in a mobile communications black spot.

The police used volunteer search teams, and it was one of these that found Kelly&#x27;s body on Harrowdown Hill at about 9:20 am on 18 July. The two-person team differed in their description of the position of the body: one stated Kelly was &quot;at the base of the tree with almost his head and his shoulders just slumped back against the tree&quot;; the other stated Kelly was &quot;sitting with his back up against a tree&quot;. The police and paramedics differed from both the searchers. DC Coe, one of the first policemen at the scene, stated the body &quot;was laying on its back—the body was laying on its back by a large tree, the head towards the trunk of the tree&quot;; the pathologist called to the scene, Nicholas Hunt, recalled that: &quot;his head was quite close to branches and so forth, but not actually over the tree.&quot;

==Immediate aftermath==

Blair was on an aeroplane from Washington to Tokyo when the body was found. He was contacted while en route and informed of the news, although Kelly had not been formally identified at that stage. He decided to order a judicial inquiry to examine the circumstances, which was to be headed by Lord Hutton, a former Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. His terms of reference were &quot;urgently to conduct an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr Kelly&quot;.

Hunt undertook the post-mortem examination on 19 July in the presence of eight police officers and two members of the coroner&#x27;s office. Hunt concluded that the cause of death was a haemorrhage caused by a self-inflicted injury from &quot;incised wounds to the left wrist&quot;, with the contributory factors of &quot;co-proxamol ingestion and coronary artery atherosclerosis&quot;. On 20 July 2003, the day after the post-mortem, the BBC confirmed that Kelly was their only source. Nicholas Gardner, the coroner, opened and adjourned his inquest on 21 July, noting that the pathologist was still awaiting the toxicology report. With the establishment of the inquiry under Hutton, the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department contacted Nicholas Gardner, the coroner, to advise him that under section 17A of the Coroners Act 1988, the coroner&#x27;s inquest should only be resumed if there were exceptional circumstances to do so.

On 6 August 2003, five days after the preliminary session of the Hutton Inquiry, Kelly was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Longworth.

==Hutton Inquiry==
From 11 August to 4 September 2003 witnesses to the inquiry were called in the order of the chronology of events. The second stage of the inquiry took place between 15 and 25 September 2003; Hutton explained that he &quot;would ask persons, who had already given evidence and whose conduct might possibly be the subject of criticism in my report, to come back to be examined further&quot;. There was one additional day used, 13 October 2003, to hear from one witness who had been ill on their scheduled day. As well as members of the Kelly family, evidence was taken from BBC employees (including Gilligan, Watts and Richard Sambrook, the BBC&#x27;s director of news) members of the government and its advisors (including Blair, Campbell, Hoon and McKinley) and civil servants, including John Scarlett, chairman of the JIC and Richard Dearlove, head of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6).

One of the witnesses who gave evidence to Hutton was David Broucher, the UK&#x27;s permanent representative to the Conference on Disarmament. In 2002 or 2003 he had asked Kelly what would happen if Iraq were invaded; Kelly had replied &quot;I will probably be found dead in the woods&quot;. Over the 24 days evidence was taken, the inquiry questioned 74 witnesses and received over 10,000 pages of evidence; most of the documents, along with transcripts of the questioning, were published online by the inquiry team. Hutton reported on 28 January 2004 and wrote &quot;I am satisfied that Dr Kelly took his own life by cutting his left wrist and that his death was hastened by his taking Co-proxamol tablets. I am further satisfied that there was no involvement by a third person in Dr Kelly&#x27;s death&quot;.

Hutton also concluded that the September dossier had not been &quot;sexed up&quot; by the government, or by Campbell, but was the work of the JIC. He cleared the government and its ministers of any wrongdoing and reserved his criticism for the BBC and Gilligan. According to George Jones, the political correspondent for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Hutton&#x27;s judgement on the BBC was &quot;damning and shocked its journalists with its ferocity. He said the corporation had a &quot;defective&quot; editorial system that allowed Gilligan to make &quot;unfounded&quot; claims questioning the Government&#x27;s integrity&quot;.

Despite the conclusion of the Hutton report that Kelly killed himself, there was continued debate over the manner of his death. Several doctors questioned the conclusion on medical grounds, although their position has been doubted by pathologists. The former leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard, and the former Liberal Democrat MP, Norman Baker, both thought Kelly was murdered. In 2007 Baker published &quot;The Strange Death of David Kelly&quot; in which he argued that Kelly did not die by suicide. Kelly&#x27;s family expressed their displeasure at the publication; his sister-in-law said: &quot;It is just raking over old bones. I can&#x27;t speak for the whole family, but I&#x27;ve read it all [Baker&#x27;s theories], every word, and I don&#x27;t believe it.&quot;

==Subsequent events==
In March 2004 the Oxfordshire coroner, Nicholas Gardiner, convened a hearing to decide whether there were the &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; needed to resume the inquest; he concluded that such circumstances did not exist and that an inquest was not required.

In December 2009 six doctors applied to the Oxford coroner&#x27;s office to reopen the inquest, claiming that there was insufficient evidence for Hutton&#x27;s conclusion of suicide. Their request was turned down on legal advice, and they were informed that evidence relating to Kelly&#x27;s death was to be kept secret for 70 years. Hutton stated that he did so &quot;solely in order to protect Dr Kelly&#x27;s widow and daughters for the remainder of their lives (the daughters being in their twenties at that time) from the distress which they would suffer from further discussion of the details of Dr Kelly&#x27;s death in the media&quot;.

The Attorney General, Dominic Grieve, reviewed the case between 2010 and 2011. He spoke to both Hutton and Gardner before he concluded that there was no benefit in opening a new inquest into the matter; he stated that there was &quot;overwhelmingly strong&quot; evidence that Kelly killed himself. Prior to Grieve&#x27;s decision, the government released the post-mortem and toxicology reports that Hutton had said should be sealed for 70 years. Both documents supported the conclusion of the Hutton Inquiry. The pathologist wrote in the post-mortem:

It is my opinion that the main factor involved in bringing about the death of David Kelly is the bleeding from the incised wounds to his left wrist. Had this not occurred he may well not have died at this time. Furthermore, on the balance of probabilities, it is likely that the ingestion of an excess number of co-proxamol tablets coupled with apparently clinically silent coronary artery disease would both have played a part in bringing about death more certainly and more rapidly than would have otherwise been the case. Therefore I give as the cause of death:
:1a. Haemorrhage;
:1b. Incised wounds to the left wrist;
:2. Co-proxamol ingestion and coronary artery atherosclerosis.

Kelly&#x27;s grave was a focal point for the campaign group &quot;Justice for Kelly&quot;, who left placards demanding an inquest and undertook vigils at the graveside. Following complaints by his widow and a request by her to the Diocese of Oxford, Kelly&#x27;s remains were exhumed in June 2017 and were reportedly cremated.

==Legacy==
Kelly&#x27;s death and the preceding events have served as an inspiration for artistic tributes and dramatisations, including the 2006 song &quot;Harrowdown Hill&quot; by Thom Yorke; a 2008 painting, &quot;Death of David Kelly&quot;, by Dexter Dalwood; Jonathan Coe&#x27;s 2015 novel &quot;Number 11&quot;; and a poem, &quot;Hand-Washing Technique – Government Guidelines&quot; (subtitled &quot;i.m. Dr David Kelly&quot;), by Simon Armitage. Kelly was the subject of a 2005 television drama, &quot;The Government Inspector&quot;, starring Mark Rylance, and &quot;Justifying War: Scenes from the Hutton Inquiry&quot; a radio play by the Tricycle Theatre. Kelly&#x27;s last moments are featured in the centre monologue of the stage play &quot;Palace of the End&quot; by Judith Thompson. There have also been documentaries on British television and radio about Kelly.

In the 1996 Birthday Honours Kelly was appointed as Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG); the citation reads:

He devised the scientific basis for the enhanced biological warfare defence programme and led strong research groups in many key areas. Following the Gulf War he led the first biological warfare inspection in Iraq and has spent most of his time since either in Iraq or at various sites in the former Soviet Union helping to shed light on past biological warfare related activities and assisting the UK/US RUS trilateral confidence building process. He has pursued this work tirelessly and with good humour despite the significant hardship, hostility and personal risk encountered during extended periods of service in both countries. ... His efforts in his specialist field have had consequences of international significance.

Lord Hutton, in the report to his inquiry, suggested that Kelly might well have been under consideration for a knighthood in May 2003. Kelly&#x27;s work in Iraq earned him a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize; his biographer Norman Baker wrote of Kelly:

It is no exaggeration to say that between 1990 and his death in 2003, Dr Kelly probably did more to make the world a more secure place than anyone on the planet. Even among the elite group of international weapons inspectors, he was regarded with some awe, as the inspectors&#x27; inspector.

<text>The Gakkel Ridge (formerly known as the Nansen Cordillera and Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge) is a mid-oceanic ridge, a divergent tectonic plate boundary between the North American Plate and the Eurasian Plate. It is located in the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean, between Greenland and Siberia. Geologically, it connects the northern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge with the Laptev Sea Rift.

==History==

The existence and approximate location of the Gakkel Ridge were predicted by Soviet polar explorer Yakov Yakovlevich Gakkel and confirmed on Soviet expeditions in the Arctic around 1950. The Ridge is named after him, and the name was recognized in April 1987 by SCUFN (under that body&#x27;s old name, the Sub-Committee on Geographical Names and Nomenclature of Ocean Bottom Features).

Until 1999, it was believed to be non-volcanic; that year, scientists operating from a nuclear submarine discovered active volcanoes along it. The largest, the Gakkel Ridge Caldera, is a supervolcano that erupted approximately 1.1 million years ago during the Pleistocene. In 2001 two research icebreakers, the German &quot;Polarstern&quot; and the American &quot;Healy&quot;, with several groups of scientists, cruised to the Gakkel Ridge to explore it and collect petrological samples. Among other discoveries, this expedition found evidence of hydrothermal vents. In 2007, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution conducted the &quot;Arctic Gakkel Vents Expedition&quot; (AGAVE), which made some unanticipated discoveries, including the unconsolidated fragmented pyroclastic volcanic deposits that cover the axial valley of the ridge (whose area is greater than 10 km2). These suggest volatile substances in concentrations ten times those in the magmas of normal mid-ocean ridges. Using &quot;free-swimming&quot; robotic submersibles on the Gakkel ridge, the AGAVE expedition also discovered what they called &quot;bizarre &#x27;mats&#x27; of microbial communities containing a half dozen or more new species&quot;. A hydrothermal site, named &quot;Aurora&quot;, was discovered in 2014. Aurora has elevated levels of methane and high temperatures, suggesting interactions between water and ultramafic rock below the vent field (rather than basalt reactions). Aurora&#x27;s geochemistry may resemble that of the Rainbow Vent Field in the Atlantic Ocean.

==Geology==

The Gakkel Ridge is approximately long and is the slowest known spreading ridge on earth, with a rate of less than one centimeter per year. It continues to the south and connects with the Knipovich Ridge.

The Gakkel ridge is not offset by any transform faults. The ridge does have segments with variable orientation and varying degrees of volcanism: the Western Volcanic Zone From the Lena trough (7° W, to 3° E longitude), the Sparsely Magmatic Zone (from 3° E to 29° E longitude), and the Eastern Magmatic Zone (from 29° E to 89°E). The gaps of volcanic activity imply very cold crust and mantle, probably related to the very low spreading rate, but it is not yet known why some parts of the ridge are more magmatic than others. Some earthquakes have been detected from the mantle, below the crust, which is very unusual for a mid-ocean ridge. It confirms that the mantle and crust of Gakkel ridge, like some segments of the Southwest Indian Ridge, are very cold.

===Hydrothermal Activity===
The Gakkel ridge features several confirmed and inferred hydrothermal fields, including Aurora (visually confirmed in 2014) and Lucky B (dredged in 2001). More sites have been inferred, but not confirmed due to difficulties with ice at higher latitudes.

==Early life and education ==
James Broadbent was born on 24 May 1949 in Holton cum Beckering, in Lincolnshire, the second son of Doreen &quot;Dee&quot; Findlay, a sculptor, and Roy Laverick Broadbent, an artist, sculptor, interior designer and furniture maker. Broadbent&#x27;s parents were both amateur actors who co-founded the Holton Players acting troupe at Holton. The two have been described by the BBC as conscientious objectors who &quot;worked the land&quot; rather than participate in World War II. In Wickenby, a former Methodist Chapel was purchased in 1970 by Holton Players, who converted it into a 100-seat theatre, named Broadbent Theatre in memory of Roy Broadbent, who designed the conversion.

Broadbent was educated at Leighton Park School, a Quaker school in Reading, and briefly attended art college before transferring to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. He graduated in 1972. His early stage work included appearances as Patrick Barlow&#x27;s assistant in the mock &quot;National Theatre of Brent&quot;.

==Career==
=== 1971–1989: Rise to prominence ===
Broadbent&#x27;s early stagework included a number of productions for The National Theatre of Brent as the downtrodden assistant Wallace to Patrick Barlow&#x27;s self-important actor-manager character Desmond Olivier Dingle. Broadbent and Barlow played many male and female character roles in comically less-than-epic tellings of historical and religious stories, such as &quot;The Complete Guide to Sex&quot;, &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;, &quot;Revolution!!&quot;, and &quot;All The World&#x27;s A Globe&quot;. These were hits at the Edinburgh Fringe, in London, and on tour. In 1978, he had two roles, first as Vroomfondel (who may, or may not be, a philosopher) and then as Shooty (a gratuitously violent policeman, who writes novel in crayon) in the Primary Phase of the groundbreaking radio series &quot;The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. Forty years later, he took the role of Marvin in the Hexagonal Phase radio series. Towards the end of the decade, Broadbent began appearing in small roles on television and films, including a Fielder in &quot;The Shout&quot; and Mackanees in the &quot;Play for Today&quot; episode &quot;Long Distance Information&quot;. He also appeared in an edition of &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, playing a Union Negotiator.
During that decade, his stage work included the original productions of &quot;Kafka&#x27;s Dick&quot; (1986) and &quot;Our Country&#x27;s Good&quot; (1988) at the Royal Court Theatre and work for the Royal National Theatre including &quot;The Government Inspector&quot;. Work on the stage with Mike Leigh includes &quot;Goosepimples&quot; and &quot;Ecstasy&quot;. He had worked with Stephen Frears in &quot;The Hit&quot; (1984) and Terry Gilliam in &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981) and &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985).

Broadbent also appeared in 1983, 1985 and 1991 as DCI Roy Slater, an associate character in the enormously popular sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;. The character appeared in three episodes over an eight-year period. He had originally been offered the lead role of Del Boy in the series, but he turned it down due to other commitments. He also made occasional guest appearances in other comedy shows including &quot;Happy Families&quot; and &quot;Victoria Wood As Seen on TV&quot;. In 1983, he portrayed Don Speekingleesh in &quot;The Queen of Spain&#x27;s Beard&quot; in the first series of &quot;The Black Adder&quot;. He later played Prince Albert in &quot;Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, first broadcast in 1988. One of his final roles that decade, was as the disgruntled Northern playwright Alan Hammond in the final episode of the playlet series &quot;Victoria Wood&quot;.

===1991–2007: Established actor ===
Broadbent&#x27;s film breakthrough came in Mike Leigh&#x27;s independent comedy drama &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot; (1990). In the 1990s he established himself as a character actor in films including Mike Newell&#x27;s period romance &quot;Enchanted April&quot; (1991), Neil Jordan&#x27;s thriller &quot;The Crying Game&quot; (1992), Woody Allen&#x27;s 1920s-set showbiz comedy &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; (1994) and Richard Loncraine&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Richard III&quot; (1995). He appeared in broad fantasy comedy &quot;The Borrowers&quot; (1997) with John Goodman and the musical comedy &quot;Little Voice&quot; (1998) with Michael Caine. Broadbent ended the decade by taking a leading role in another Mike Leigh film, &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot; (1999), playing dramatist Sir William S. Gilbert.

Broadbent&#x27;s television work during the Nineties included Jim Morley in &quot;Gone to the Dogs&quot; and Monty in the follow-up series &quot;Gone to Seed&quot;. Further comic roles included &quot;Murder Most Horrid&quot; as Selwyn Proops, &quot;The Comic Strip Presents&quot; as George and most notably the lead role of branch manager Peter Duffley in the sitcom &quot;The Peter Principle&quot; which ran for two series, broadcast between 1995 - 2000. He also appeared as Charlie Bennett in an episode of &quot;Inspector Morse.&quot; In 1999, he made a notable appearance as the eleventh incarnation of the Doctor in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spoof &quot;Doctor Who: Curse of the Fatal of Death&quot; which was written by future writer and showrunner Steven Moffat.

In 2001, Broadbent starred in three of the year&#x27;s most successful films: Richard Curtis&#x27; &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;, Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; and Richard Eyre&#x27;s &quot;Iris&quot;, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. In 2002, he appeared in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; and in the film adaptation of Dickens&#x27; Nicholas Nickleby. In 2005, Broadbent appeared in the film adaptation of C. S. Lewis&#x27; classic children&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; as Professor Kirke. That same year Broadbent had voice roles in &quot;Robots&quot;, &quot;Valiant&quot; and &quot;The Magic Roundabout&quot;. He also joined Rowan Atkinson in his &quot;Spider-Man&quot; spoof &quot;Spider-Plant Man&quot;, as a disgruntled &quot;Batman&quot;, envious of Spider-Plant Man&#x27;s success.

Broadbent played the lead role of the TV film &quot;Wide-Eyed and Legless&quot;. Based on a true story, the drama tells of Deric Longden&#x27;s wife, Diana and her fight against a mysterious wasting illness which turned out to be myalgic encephalomyelitis. It began as a type of flu but it grew progressively worse. She was subject to blackouts and became so debilitated that she could barely get out of her wheelchair. It led to years of pain and paralysis that ended in her death. Broadbent portrayed the title role in the Channel 4 drama &quot;Longford&quot; in October 2006, earning a BAFTA TV Award, a Golden Globe and a 2007 Emmy nomination for his performance as Frank Pakenham (1905–2001), Earl of Longford, which was centred on Longford&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful campaign for the parole of Myra Hindley from her life imprisonment for the Moors Murders. Broadbent appeared as Inspector Frank Butterman in &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; in 2007. He was also a regular in Stephen Fry&#x27;s radio comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Fry&quot;, which aired on BBC Radio 4 in 1988. In 2008, he starred as pro-Newtonian physicist Sir Oliver Lodge in the fact-based single drama &quot;Einstein and Eddington&quot; for the BBC.

Broadbent joined a long list of British actors by appearing in &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, as well as the final movie in the series &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; as Horace Slughorn In 2009, he portrayed Sam Longson, chairman of Derby County football club in the 1960s and 1970s, in the film &quot;The Damned United&quot;; the starring character in the film was football manager Brian Clough, played by Michael Sheen. In 2010, he provided the voice for the character Major Mouse in a series of radio advertisements and one produced for television for an energy company, E.ON, for their eonenergyfit.com website campaign. He also starred as the older Logan Mountstuart in the TV adaptation of William Boyd&#x27;s novel &quot;Any Human Heart&quot;. He had a lead role in &quot;Exile&quot;, a BBC One drama, starring John Simm and written by Danny Brocklehurst.

In 2010, Broadbent reunited with director Mike Leigh, in &quot;Another Year&quot; with Ruth Sheen and Lesley Manville. The film premiered at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival in competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or. According to review aggregation website, Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of critics have given the film a positive review, with the critical consensus reading, &quot;Characterized by strong performances and the director&#x27;s trademark feel for the nuances of everyday life, Another Year marks another solid entry in Mike Leigh&#x27;s career of kitchen-sink English drama.&quot;
In 2012, he played Denis Thatcher opposite Meryl Streep as the former Prime Minister in &quot;The Iron Lady&quot;. That same year he also starred in &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; with Tom Hanks, Hugh Grant, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, and Ben Whishaw.

==Awards and honours==

Broadbent received his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Richard Eyre&#x27;s &quot;Iris&quot; (2001) starring alongside Judi Dench. That same year he won his British Academy Film Award for his performance in Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (2001). In 2007, he received a British Academy Television Award for his work in Tom Hooper&#x27;s television film, &quot;Longford&quot; (2007). He has received two Golden Globe Awards for his performances in &quot;Iris&quot; (2001) and &quot;Longford&quot; (2007). He also received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his performance as Desmond Morton in the BBC/HBO production &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot; (2002) and as Lord Longford in &quot;Longford&quot; (2007).

Broadbent was offered an OBE in 2002, but he declined it, stating that there were more deserving recipients than actors and that the British Empire was not something he wanted to &quot;celebrate&quot;. Broadbent was made an Honorary Associate of London Film School.

==Bibliography==
In 2018, Broadbent&#x27;s first graphic novel &quot;Dull Margaret&quot; was published by Fantagraphics Books.

Modern circus, as an integrated entertainment experience that includes music, domesticated animals, acrobats, and clowns, traces its heritage to Astley&#x27;s Amphitheatre, a riding school that Astley founded in London following the success of trick-riding displays given by him and his wife Patty Jones in 1768. Astley&#x27;s first competitor was equestrian Charles Hughes, who had previously worked with Astley. Together with Charles Dibdin, a famous author of pantomimes, Hughes opened a rival amphitheatre in London, which Dibdin called the Royal Circus and Equestrian Philharmonic Academy.

Astley and his wife Patty put on their first public show on Easter Monday, 4 April 1768. extending the equestrian performance with exhibitions of warlike sabre-work and sword-play. The initial performances were done in the open air at Ha&#x27;penny (= Halfpenny) Hatch, a field in Lambeth, London, near the present site of Waterloo railway station. The Astleys also performed at other locations in London. Astley performed his stunts in a circular arena, though Astley never used the title of &#x27;circus&#x27; for his shows. Astley&#x27;s &#x27;Ride&#x27; (he also called it &#x27;the Circle&#x27;) was a ring 65 ft (19 metres) in diameter. Later, the size evolved to become standardised at 42 feet (13 metres) which is the size used by circuses ever since. Leasing more permanent premises at Westminster Bridge from 1769, he improved conditions for audiences with a covered stands. The performances themselves, however, were still performed in the open. In 1770 he hired acrobats, tightrope walkers, jugglers and a clown to fill in the pauses between acts. and so initiated the format which we now know as a &#x27;circus&#x27; and which has since spread to many countries.

==Biography==
Philip Astley was born in Newcastle-under-Lyme in England the son of a cabinetmaker. At the age of nine, he apprenticed with his father, but Astley&#x27;s dream was to work with horses, so he joined Colonel Eliott&#x27;s Fifteenth Light Dragoons when he was 17, later becoming a sergeant major. His service in the Seven Years&#x27; War brought him into contact with professional trainers and riders. Astley himself was a brilliant rider.

===Equestrian master===
Astley had a genius for trick riding. He saw that trick riders received the most attention from the crowds in Islington. He had an idea for opening a riding school in London in which he could also conduct shows of acrobatic riding skill. In 1768, Astley performed in an open field in what is now the Waterloo area of London, behind the present site of St John&#x27;s Church. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences, moving to fenced premises just south of Westminster Bridge, where he opened his riding school from 1769 onwards and expanded the content of his shows (see below). He taught riding in the mornings and performed his &quot;feats of horsemanship&quot; in the afternoons.

Astley began to make a reputation and to grow wealthier. After two seasons in London he had to bring some novelty to his performances, so he hired other equestrians, musicians, a clown, jugglers, tumblers, tightrope walkers, and dancing dogs – the modern circus was created. Guilds and lineages of acrobats and clowns had performed throughout Europe for centuries before this, but as members of independent professions, not as part of an integrated entertainment experience for which an all-inclusive ticket was sold.
Astley did not invent trick-riding, which was already a popular entertainment of the period. Nor did he originate the idea of performing in a circular &#x27;ring&#x27;. The use of the circular arena is successful for two reasons. First, it is easier for the audience to keep the riders in sight. Second, the circular ring (though Astley called it &#x27;the Ride&#x27;) helps riders through the generation of centrifugal force, which assists them in keeping their balance while standing on the backs of their galloping horses. Astley never called his &#x27;Astley&#x27;s Amphitheatre of Equestrian Arts&#x27; a &quot;circus&quot;; that title was thought up by Charles Dibdin, who in partnership with Astley&#x27;s rival Charles Hughes, opened the &quot;Royal Circus&quot; on 4 November 1782, a short distance from Astley&#x27;s in Lambeth, London. After a few years, Astley added a platform, seats, and a roof to his ring. Even after his death Astley&#x27;s &quot;Royal Amphitheatre&quot; remained famous throughout the nineteenth century, being mentioned by Charles Dickens and Jane Austen. It was closed in 1893 and was demolished the next year. The garden of St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital now occupies the site; a commemorative paving stone (see below) marks the Amphitheatre&#x27;s former position.

Astley&#x27;s original circus ring was 65 ft (~19 m) in diameter, and later he settled it at 42 ft (~13 m), which has been an international standard for circuses since. Not far from the Amphitheatre site is Hercules Road, named after the house Astley built and named Hercules Hall. The house is long gone, but its name is said to have commemorated Astley&#x27;s popular human pyramid act, &quot;La Force d&#x27;Hercule&quot;.

===International success===

Astley&#x27;s circus was so popular that he was invited in 1772 to perform before Louis XV of France in Versailles. Having been established from 1769 as a riding school and for open-air performances, the first Astley&#x27;s Amphitheatre opened in London in 1773; it burned on 17 September 1794, but with abundant resources available due to the venture&#x27;s prosperity it was rebuilt and, in due course was rebuilt again after successive fires, and eventually grew to become Astley&#x27;s Royal Amphitheatre. In 1782, Astley established the first purpose-built circus in France, the Amphitheatre Anglais in Paris. Astley then established 18 other permanent circuses in cities throughout Europe.

During the summers and at other times when his London establishment was inactive, Astley began to establish wooden amphitheatres abroad; the first of these was erected in 1773 in Dublin, Ireland. He later established eighteen other circuses in European cities, was patronised by a great number of royals, and was famous, envied, and occasionally rich. He never used wild animals in the circus arena. In 1806, with the profits he had earned from his amphitheatre, Astley opened a new venue, the Olympic Pavilion (also known as the Olympic Theatre) on Wych Street, Westminster, near the Strand. This tent-like structure, partly built from the remains of a French warship, did not prove a success, and in 1813 he sold it to Robert William Elliston, who renamed it the Little Drury Lane. Astley died a year later in Paris and was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery, the cause of his death being gout in the stomach.

===Legacy===
Astley&#x27;s Amphitheatre is mentioned in the popular fiction of Charles Dickens, Jane Austen and William Makepeace Thackeray, among others. In Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Emma&quot;, in chapter 54: &quot;He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley&#x27;s. They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley&#x27;s.&quot; It is also a motif of James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.

Astley&#x27;s fame is also marked by the existence of three dance tunes which bear his name: &quot;Astley&#x27;s Ride(s)&quot;, &quot;Astley&#x27;s Flag&quot; and more common, &quot;Astley&#x27;s Hornpipe&quot;. &quot;Astley&#x27;s Ride&quot; appears as the first song in the music manuscript book of poet John Clare.

Astley&#x27;s circus is featured prominently in Tracy Chevalier&#x27;s novel &quot;Burning Bright&quot;.

On 31 May 1982 the illusionist Fred Van Buren staged the first celebration of Philip Astley in the form of Newcastle-under-Lyme&#x27;s annual carnival, which had the theme of Philip Astley&#x27;s Circus. This event began the journey to bring Astley back into the public&#x27;s awareness.

Then in 1992 the British magician illusionist Andrew Van Buren commissioned a life-size statue to be made of Philip Astley to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Astley&#x27;s birth. Van Buren is the Director, Astley expert and curator of Philip Astley Projects CIC, creating and uniting archives, exhibitions and a series of events celebrating the 250th anniversary of circus in 2018 and beyond. In March 2024 the Philip Astley Visitor Centre was opened in Newcastle-under-Lyme.

==Circus 250==

The Circus250 celebrations began in January 2018 when Andrew Van Buren joined Albert II, Prince of Monaco, and Princess Stéphanie of Monaco for the unveiling of a plaque to Philip Astley in Monte Carlo. Following this in February 2018 the United Kingdom&#x27;s first permanent monument to Philip Astley and his legacy of the circus was positioned on the border between Stoke-on-Trent and Newcastle-under-Lyme. The monument was designed by Candida Kelsall, built by PM Training and funded by the Realise Foundation. This was then unveiled on World Circus Day 2018 by Federation Mondiale du Cirque director Zsuzsanna Mata, the Newcastle-under-Lyme Mayor Simon White and Van Buren. A second of these monuments was then positioned in the village of Silverdale, which is the opposite side of Newcastle-under-Lyme.

A commemorative plaque was inaugurated at the Ha&#x27;penny Hatch site off Cornwall Road, Lambeth, on Easter Monday 2018, two days before the exact 250th anniversary of the first performances there by the Astleys.. The plaque was provided by the Lambeth Estate Residents&#x27; Association and was unveiled by the circus ringmaster Chris Barltrop dressed as Astley and accompanied by horses and riders from Zippo&#x27;s Circus. In 1989, Barltrop had been the first to identify the site of Astley&#x27;s Ha&#x27;penny (= Halfpenny) Hatch &lt;King Pole Magazine, Circus Friends&#x27; Assn of GB/&gt;. 

Chris Barltrop researched and wrote a one-man play, Audacious Mr Astley, which he first performed at the Waterloo East Theatre, London, on Easter Monday 2018, and later at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

Newcastle-under-Lyme&#x27;s New Vic Theatre during the summer of 2018 ran the hugely successful Astley’s Astounding Adventure play, complementing their Roll Up events, which included a street exhibition of Circus art and photography curated by the Victoria and Albert Museum. Other events included The Brampton Museum&#x27;s exhibition of Philip Astley artefacts. Also the Philip Astley Project&#x27;s AstleyFest outdoor event which celebrated each aspect of Philip Astley&#x27;s life and legacy. Astley’s Astounding Adventure was remounted by the New Vic Theatre in 2023.

On 14 September 2018, a flagstone commemorating the Amphitheatre was inaugurated in the St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital garden. The flagstone was the initiative of Martin Burton, founder and director of Zippos Circus. A group of fully costumed performers from Zippos, including a trick-rider and his horse, accompanied Burton to help inaugurate the flagstone.

In 2019 a new hardback book was published, written by Karl Shaw entitled The First Showman, bringing together for the first time previously unknown facts and details of Astley&#x27;s life and family history, as a combination of Shaw&#x27;s own research, plus Newcastle-under-Lyme&#x27;s Brampton Museum research team and Andrew Van Buren.

<doc id="271300" wikidata="Q1664533" url="?curid=271300" title="José Padilla (criminal)">
<text>José Padilla (born October 18, 1970), also known as Abdullah al-Muhajir ( ) or Muhajir Abdullah, is a United States citizen who was convicted in a federal court of aiding terrorists.

Padilla was arrested in Chicago on May 8, 2002, on suspicion of plotting a radiological bomb (&quot;dirty bomb&quot;) attack. He was detained as a material witness until June 9, 2002, when President George W. Bush designated him an enemy combatant and, arguing that he was not entitled to trial in civilian courts, had him transferred to a military prison in South Carolina. Padilla was held for three and a half years as an enemy combatant. Upon pressure and lawsuits from civil liberties groups, he was transferred to a civilian jail in 2006.

In August 2007, a federal jury found him guilty of conspiring to commit murder and fund terrorism. Government officials had earlier claimed Padilla was suspected of planning to build and explode a &quot;dirty bomb&quot; in the United States, but he was never charged with this crime. He was initially sentenced to 17 years in prison, which was increased on appeal to 21 years. His lawsuits against the military for allegedly torturing him were rejected by the courts for lack of merit and jurisdictional issues.

==Early life==
José Padilla was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Estella Obregón and her husband, both of Puerto Rican descent. The family later moved to Chicago, Illinois. As a youth, Padilla joined the Latin Kings street gang and was arrested several times. During his gang years, he maintained several aliases, such as José Rivera, José Alicea, José Hernandez, and José Ortiz. As a 14-year-old juvenile, he was convicted of aggravated assault and manslaughter after a gang member, whom he had kicked in the head, died.

After serving his last jail sentence, Padilla converted to Islam after his marriage to a Muslim woman and moved to the Middle East. One of his early religious instructors was an Islamic teacher who professed a nonviolent philosophy and Padilla appeared at the time to be faithful to his mentor&#x27;s teachings. While living in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Padilla attended the Masjid Al-Iman mosque, as did Adham Amin Hassoun, &quot;for most of the 1990s and [they] were reportedly friends.&quot;

U.S. authorities accused Hassoun of associating with radical Islamic fundamentalists, including Al-Qaeda. Hassoun, a Lebanese-born Palestinian, was arrested in 2002 for overstaying his visa and was charged in 2004 with providing material support to terrorists. By that time, Hassoun had already been charged with perjury, a weapons offense, and other offenses.

==Marriage and family==
Broward County, Florida court records show that on July 1, 1994, Padilla changed his name to one word: &quot;Ibrahim&quot;. He was married under that name to Cherie Maria Stultz on January 2, 1996. They divorced in March 2001, according to court records. In January 2001, she had placed an ad in a local business newspaper, serving notice that she was seeking divorce. Their divorce papers identify him as Jose Ibrahim Padilla.

Padilla married an Egyptian woman named Shamia&#x27;a, and they had two sons together. When he was arrested in 2002, the boys were infants. At his bail hearing, his wife and children were believed to be overseas.

==Terroristic activity==
According to press reports in 2002, Padilla had been in the Afghanistan–Pakistan region in 2001 and early 2002. At the time, the Defense Department said that Abu Zubaydah, then believed to be a top al-Qaeda official, had led the US to Padilla.

Padilla was alleged to have been trained in the construction and employment of radiologic weapons – &quot;dirty bombs&quot; – at an al-Qaeda safe house in Lahore, Pakistan. Padilla and Binyam Mohammed, a United Kingdom resident, were alleged to have been recruited at the Lahore safe house to travel to the United States to launch terrorist attacks.

However, more recent evidence suggests that the &quot;dirty bomb&quot; plot was likely a ruse to get out of Pakistan and based on an internet joke website purporting to describe how to build an H-bomb by swinging buckets of uranium as fast as possible. A 2003 CIA memo notes that the satirical article &quot;is filled with countless technical inaccuracies which would likely result in the death of anyone attempting to follow the instructions, and definitely would not result in a nuclear explosion&quot;.

==Arrest==

Padilla traveled to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. On his return, he was arrested by U.S. Customs agents at Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International Airport on May 8, 2002, and held as a material witness on a warrant issued in the state of New York stemming from the September 11, 2001, attacks.

On June 9, 2002, two days before District Court Judge Michael Mukasey was to issue a ruling on the validity of continuing to hold Padilla under the material witness warrant, President George Bush issued an order to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to detain Padilla as an &quot;enemy combatant.&quot; Padilla was transferred to a military brig in Charleston, South Carolina, without any notice to his attorney or family. The order &quot;legally justified&quot; the detention using the 2001 AUMF passed in the wake of September 11, 2001, (formally &quot;The Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution&quot; (Public Law )) and opined that a U.S. citizen detained on U.S. soil can be classified as an enemy combatant. (This opinion is based on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in the case of &quot;Ex parte Quirin&quot;, a case involving the detention of eight German spies operating in the United States while working for Nazi Germany during World War II.)

According to the text of the ensuing decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Padilla&#x27;s detention as an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; (pursuant to the President&#x27;s order) was based on the following reasons:
# Padilla was &quot;closely associated with al Qaeda,&quot; a designation for loosely knit insurgent groups sharing common ideals and tactics, &quot;with which the United States is at war&quot;;
# he had engaged in &quot;war-like acts, including conduct in preparation for acts of international terrorism&quot;;
# he had intelligence that could assist the United States in warding off future terrorist attacks; and
# he was a continuing threat to American security.

==2002 memos==
Shortly after September 26, 2002, the top political appointees David Addington, Alberto Gonzales, John A. Rizzo, William Haynes II, two Justice Department lawyers, Alice S. Fisher and Patrick F. Philbin, and then-Special Counsel to the General Counsel of the Department of Defense Jack Goldsmith flew to Camp Delta to view Mohammed al-Kahtani, then to Charleston, South Carolina, to view Padilla, and finally to Norfolk, Virginia, to view Yaser Esam Hamdi, who had been subjected to coercive techniques including solitary confinement. It was later learned that top administration officials had earlier discussed and approved the use of &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot;, a euphemism for torture, for the CIA. They were consulting with DOD agents to discuss techniques that might be used against the detainees in military custody. Later that year, additional &quot;harsh techniques&quot; were used on these three and other prisoners.

In October 2008, 91 pages of memos drafted in 2002 by officers at the Naval Consolidated Brig, Charleston were made public. The memos indicate that officers were concerned that the isolation of solitary confinement and lack of stimuli were causing the prisoner Yasser Hamdi mental anguish and threatened his sanity. The memos also state that Padilla and a third prisoner, Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, were held in similar conditions at the Brig.

==Habeas corpus==

Because Padilla was being detained without any criminal charges being formally made against him, he, through his lawyer Jennifer Martínez, made a petition for a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as the respondent to this petition. The government filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the grounds that:
# Padilla&#x27;s lawyer was not a proper &quot;next Friend&quot; to sign and file the petition on Padilla&#x27;s behalf.
# Commander Marr of the South Carolina brig, and not U.S. Secretary Rumsfeld, should have been named as the respondent to the petition.
# The New York court lacked personal jurisdiction over the named respondent Secretary Rumsfeld who resides in Virginia.

The New York District Court disagreed with the government&#x27;s arguments and denied its motion. However, the court declared that President Bush had constitutional and statutory authority to designate and detain American citizens as &quot;enemy combatants.&quot; It held that Padilla had the right to challenge his &quot;enemy combatant&quot; designation and detention in the course of his &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition, although immediate release was denied. Both Padilla and the government made an interlocutory appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

On December 18, 2003, the Second Circuit declared that
# Padilla&#x27;s lawyer is a proper &quot;next friend&quot; to sign and file the &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition on Padilla&#x27;s behalf because she, as a member of the bar, had a professional duty to defend her client&#x27;s interests. Further, she had a significant attorney-client relationship with Padilla and was far from being some zealous &quot;intruder&quot; or &quot;uninvited meddler,&quot; as described by the government.
# Secretary Rumsfeld can be named as the respondent to Padilla&#x27;s &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition, although South Carolina&#x27;s Navy Commander Marr had immediate physical custody of Padilla, because there have been past cases where national-level officials have been named as respondents to such petitions.
# The New York District Court had personal jurisdiction over Secretary Rumsfeld although Rumsfeld resided in Virginia and not New York because New York&#x27;s &quot;long-arm statute&quot; is applicable to Secretary Rumsfeld, who was responsible for Padilla&#x27;s physical transfer from New York to South Carolina.
# Despite the legal precedent set by &quot;ex parte Quirin&quot;, &quot;the president lacked inherent constitutional authority as commander in chief to detain American citizens on American soil outside a zone of combat.&quot; The Second Circuit relied on the case of &quot;Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer&quot;, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), where the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that President Truman, during the Korean War years, could not use his position and power as commander in chief, created under Article 2, Section 2, of the U.S. Constitution, to seize the nation&#x27;s steel mills on the eve of a nationwide steelworkers strike. The extraordinary government power to curb civil rights and liberties during crisis periods, such as times of war, lies with Congress and not the president. Article 1, Section 9, Clause 2, of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress, and not the president, the power to suspend the right of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; during a period of rebellion or invasion.

Declaring that without clear congressional approval (per ), President Bush cannot detain an American citizen arrested in the United States and away from a zone of combat as an &quot;illegal enemy combatant&quot;, the court ordered that Padilla be released from the military brig within 30 days. However, the court stayed the release order pending the government&#x27;s appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

===U.S. Supreme Court===
On February 20, 2004, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the government&#x27;s appeal. The Supreme Court heard the case, &quot;Rumsfeld v. Padilla&quot;, in April 2004, but on June 28, 2004, the court dismissed the petition on technical grounds because
# It was improperly filed in federal court in New York instead of South Carolina, where Padilla was being detained.
# The Court held that the petition was incorrect in naming the secretary of defense as the respondent for &quot;habeas corpus&quot; purposes instead of the commanding officer of the naval brig who was Padilla&#x27;s direct custodian.

===District Court for South Carolina===

The case was re-filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, and on February 28, 2005, the court ordered that the government either charge or release Padilla.

On June 13, 2005, the Supreme Court denied the government&#x27;s petition to have his case heard directly by the court, instead of the appeal being first heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia. On September 9, 2005, a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit ruled that President Bush had the authority to detain Padilla without charges. An opinion written by judge J. Michael Luttig cited the joint resolution by Congress authorizing military action following the September 11, 2001, attacks, as well as the June 2004 ruling concerning Yaser Hamdi.

Attorneys for Padilla and civil liberties organizations, filing &quot;amicus curiae&quot; briefs, argued that the detention was illegal. They said it could lead to the military holding anyone, from protesters to people who check out what the government considers the wrong books from the library. The Bush administration denied the allegations. The defense argument noted that the congressional military authorization (the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists) pertained only to nations, organizations, or persons whom the president &quot;determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the September 11, 2001, attacks, or harbored such organizations or persons.&quot;

They advanced a reading of this language would suggest a congressional limitation to the military power would assure an appropriately narrow range of detainees and that the power to detain would last only so long as the congressional authorization was not revoked or remained in effect by its terms. Similarly, they noted that the Yaser Hamdi Supreme Court case (&quot;Hamdi v. Rumsfeld&quot;) upon which the court relied, required a habeas corpus hearing for any alleged enemy combatant who demands one, claiming not to be such a combatant, which would require additional judicial or military tribunal oversight over each such detention. The argument in the general public concerning the legality of Padilla&#x27;s detention examined one of the provisions of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 enacted on October 17, 2006, which states:

==Indictment==
On November 22, 2005, CNN reported that Padilla had been indicted in federal court on charges he &quot;conspired to murder, kidnap, and maim people overseas.&quot; Padilla&#x27;s lawyer correlated the indictment&#x27;s timing as avoidance of an impending Supreme Court hearing on the Padilla case: &quot;The administration is seeking to avoid a Supreme Court showdown over the issue.&quot;

None of the original allegations made by the U.S. government three years prior, which had contributed to Padilla&#x27;s being held the majority of the time in solitary confinement, was part of the indictment, nor was there any charge related to incidents within the United States.

Democracy Now! further asserted:Attorney General Alberto Gonzales announced Padilla is being removed from military custody and charged with a series of crimes&quot; and &quot;There is no mention in the indictment of Padilla&#x27;s alleged plot to use a dirty bomb in the United States. There is also no mention that Padilla ever planned to stage any attacks inside the country. And there is no direct mention of Al-Qaeda. Instead the indictment lays out a case involving five men who helped raise money and recruit volunteers in the 1990s to go overseas to countries including Chechnya, Bosnia, Somalia and Kosovo. Padilla, in fact, appears to play a minor role in the conspiracy. He is accused of going to a jihad training camp in Afghanistan but his lawyers said the indictment offers no evidence he ever engaged in terrorist activity.

Padilla was held for years in military custody with no formal charges. Critics said such a process would allow the U.S. government to detain citizens indefinitely without presenting the case that would eventually be tried.

On December 21, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit refused to authorize a transfer from the Navy brig to civil court. The court suggested that the administration was manipulating the federal court system with &quot;intentional mooting&quot; in order to avoid Supreme Court review. It said that the &quot;shifting tactics in the case threatens [the government&#x27;s] credibility with the courts.&quot;

The Solicitor General Paul Clement said that the federal appeals court decision &quot;defies both law and logic.&quot; He asked the Supreme Court authorize immediate transfer on December 30, 2005. This took place one day after Padilla&#x27;s lawyers filed a petition charging the president with overstepping his authority.

On January 3, 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a Bush administration request to transfer Padilla from military to civilian custody. He was transferred to a federal prison in Miami while the Supreme Court decided whether to accept his appeal of the government&#x27;s authority to keep US citizens it designates &quot;enemy combatants&quot; in open-ended military confinement without benefit of trial.

On April 3, 2006, the Supreme Court declined, with three justices dissenting from denial of certiorari, to hear Padilla&#x27;s appeal from the 4th Circuit Court&#x27;s decision. It left the 4th Circuit court&#x27;s ruling that the president had the power to designate and detain him as an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; without charges and with disregard to &quot;habeas corpus&quot;.

==Criminal proceedings==

Padilla was indicted on three criminal counts in the Miami, Florida, criminal proceeding. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. The trial commenced on May 15, 2007, and lasted for 3 months.

===Partial dismissal of counts against Padilla===
Two weeks after the presiding judge claimed prosecutors were &quot;light on facts&quot; in their conspiracy allegations, the government dismissed one of its three charges against Padilla and dismissed another in part.

The count of conspiracy to murder (punishable by life imprisonment) was dismissed on August 16, 2006, on the grounds that it was duplicative of the other two counts pending against him. The second count was conspiracy to materially aid terrorists under (punishable by five years in prison) and the third was Providing material support to terrorists (punishable by 15 years in prison). The trial court ordered that the government elect a single criminal statute in its second count of the indictment.

However, on January 30, 2007, the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit reversed the ruling and reinstated a charge of conspiracy to &quot;murder, kidnap, and maim.&quot;

===Delays in prosecution===
Two additional motions filed in October 2006 argued that the case should be dismissed because the government took too much time between arresting Padilla and charging him, violating Padilla&#x27;s constitutional right to a speedy trial as the arrest took place prior to his detention as an enemy combatant and not when he was transferred to civilian custody.

===Mental competency hearing===

In January 2007, a mental competency hearing was scheduled for Padilla for February 22, 2007. Two mental health experts hired by the defense to conduct a competency evaluation concluded Padilla was not mentally fit for trial; a third evaluation submitted by the Bureau of Prisons found him mentally competent. The judge ordered that Sandy Seymour, technical director of the Charleston brig; Craig Noble, brig psychologist; Andrew Cruz, brig social worker; four employees of the Miami federal detention center; and a Defense Department lawyer appear at the hearing.

On February 22, 2007, at the competency hearing, Dr. Angela Hegarty, a psychiatrist hired by Padilla&#x27;s defense, said that after 22 hours of examining Padilla, she believed that he was mentally unfit to stand trial. She said he exhibited &quot;a facial tic, problems with social contact, lack of concentration and a form of Stockholm syndrome.&quot; She diagnosed his condition as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and told the court, &quot;It&#x27;s my opinion that he lacks the capacity to assist counsel. He has a great deal of difficulty talking about the current case before him.&quot;

In cross examination, federal prosecutor John Shipley noted that Padilla had a score of zero on Hegarty&#x27;s post-traumatic stress disorder test and pointed out that this information was omitted in her final report. Hegarty stated that the omission was an error on her part. Another psychiatrist hired by the defense testified along the same lines. The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; reported that a &quot;U.S. Bureau of Prisons psychiatrist who believes Padilla is fit to face trial and Defense Department officials—are expected to testify at the ongoing hearing before U.S. District Judge Marcia Cooke.&quot;

===Conviction and sentencing===
On August 16, 2007, after a day and a half of deliberations, the jury found Padilla guilty on all counts. He was scheduled to be sentenced on December 5, 2007, but his sentencing was postponed to January due to the death of a family member of the judge scheduled to sentence him. He was sentenced on January 22, 2008, to 17 years and 4 months in federal prison. His two co-defendants received sentences of 15 years, eight months, and 12 years and 8 months.

Before receiving his permanent prison assignment, Padilla was placed in the Federal Detention Center facility in Miami, Florida.

===Direct appeal of criminal conviction===
As of February 28, 2008, Padilla had appealed his conviction and sentence and the government had cross-appealed. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; said in an editorial, &quot;the lawyers suing for Padilla aren&#x27;t interested in justice. They&#x27;re practicing &#x27;lawfare&#x27;, which is an effort to undermine the war on terror by making U.S. officials afraid to pursue it for fear of personal liability.&quot; In January 2012, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision and his case has been ruled on numerous times.

===Sentence ruled too lenient===
On September 19, 2011, a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the 17-year prison sentence imposed on Padilla, ruling that the sentence was too lenient. They sent the case back to the lower court for a new sentencing hearing. The Court said, &quot;Padilla&#x27;s sentence of 12 years below the low end of the [sentencing] guidelines range reflects a clear error of judgment about the sentencing of this career offender.&quot; On September 9, 2014, the district court sentenced Padilla to 21 years.

Padilla is serving his sentence at ADX Florence prison in Florence, Colorado. Padilla&#x27;s prisoner number is ; he is projected to be released in 2026.

==Criticism of his conviction==
*Andrew Patel, Padilla&#x27;s lawyer, said after the guilty verdict,
What happened in this trial, I think you have to put it in the context of federal conspiracy law, where the government doesn&#x27;t have to prove that something happened, but just that people agree that something should happen in the future. In this case, it was even more strained. The crime charged in this case was actually an agreement to agree to do something in the future. So when you&#x27;re dealing with a charge like that, you&#x27;re not going to have—or the government&#x27;s not going to be required to produce the kind of evidence that you would expect in a normal criminal case.

*American economist Paul Craig Roberts criticized the jury&#x27;s verdict in the Padilla case as having &quot;overthrown&quot; the Constitution and done far more damage to U.S. liberty than any terrorist could.
*British journalist Andy Worthington wrote:[Seventeen] years and four months seems to me to be an extraordinarily long sentence for little more than a thought crime, but when the issue of Padilla&#x27;s three and half years of suppressed torture is raised, it&#x27;s difficult not to conclude that justice has just been horribly twisted, that the president and his advisers have just got away with torturing an American citizen with impunity, and that no American citizen can be sure that what happened to Padilla will not happen to him or her. Today, it was a Muslim; tomorrow, unless the government&#x27;s powers are taken away from them, it could be any number of categories of &#x27;enemy combatants&#x27; who have not yet been identified.
*Timothy Lynch of the Cato Institute raised several issues related to the Padilla seizure in an &quot;amicus&quot; brief he filed to the Supreme Court. In it, he asks questions such as whether the president can lock up any person in the world and then deny that person access to family, defense counsel, and civilian court review; and objects to the use of &quot;harsh conditions&quot; and &quot;environmental stresses&quot;. He questioned whether such techniques can be employed against anyone once the president gives an order. Those legal questions remain unsettled. Lynch argued that, by abruptly moving Padilla from the military brig and transferring him into the civil criminal justice system, the Bush administration was able to forestall Supreme Court review of the president&#x27;s military powers.
*Glenn Greenwald, journalist and former constitutional law and civil rights litigator, wrote a highly critical piece in the online magazine &quot;Salon.com&quot; in September 2011:The treatment Padilla has received in the justice system is, needless to say, the polar opposite of that enjoyed by these political elites ... Literally days before it was required to justify to the U.S. Supreme Court how it could imprison an American citizen for years without charges or access to a lawyer, the Bush administration suddenly indicted Padilla -- on charges unrelated to, and far less serious than, the accusation that he was A Dirty Bomber -- and then successfully convinced the Supreme Court to refuse to decide the legality of Padilla&#x27;s imprisonment on the grounds of &#x27;mootness&#x27;.

==Civil proceedings==
On January 4, 2008, Padilla and his mother filed suit against John Yoo in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (Case Number CV08 0035). The complaint sought damages based on the alleged torture of Padilla, and attributed this treatment as having been authorized by Yoo&#x27;s legal opinions issued in August 2002, known as the &quot;Torture memos&quot;. The suit posited that Yoo caused Padilla&#x27;s damages by authorizing Padilla&#x27;s alleged torture through his memoranda.

On June 28, 2009, the trial court held that the complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim, because if everything stated in the complaint was taken as true, it stated grounds for Yoo to be liable to Padilla for civil damages. But on February 17, 2011, the District Court dismissed another suit by Padilla against other former officials which had been brought on February 9, 2007. &quot;Lebron v. Rumsfeld&quot;, 764 F.Supp.2d 787 (D.S.C.). On January 23, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed this dismissal.

In May 2012, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Yoo could not be held accountable for Padilla&#x27;s treatment because, though his treatment might have amounted to torture, it was not defined as such legally in 2002–2003 when it occurred.

==Names==
According to his attorney and others, Padilla has changed the pronunciation of his surname from the typical to .

Padilla&#x27;s Arabic name Abdullah al-Muhajir, which he began using during his jail sentence, literally means &quot;Abdullah the migrant&quot;. &quot;Al-Muhajir&quot; is a &quot;laqab&quot; (epithet) rather than an adopted family name. Padilla is not related to or known to be connected in any way to Abu Hamza al-Muhajir.

<doc id="271304" wikidata="Q3312395" url="?curid=271304" title="Microsoft SideWinder">
<text>Microsoft SideWinder is a former brand name for a family of video gaming peripherals developed by Microsoft for PCs. It was initially marketed from 1995 to 2003 consisting of game controllers, then again from 2007 until the early 2010s with gaming mice and keyboards.

The term &quot;SideWinder&quot; describes many types of Microsoft&#x27;s PC game controllers including joysticks, gamepads and steering wheels. Several types of joysticks were made, including the Force Feedback 2, the 3D Pro, and the regular SideWinder joystick. Also, several types of gamepads were made, such as the original game port version, a plug-and-play game port version, and the USB version. Steering wheels are the Precision Racing Wheel and the Force Feedback Wheel variants which include throttle and brake pedals. The family also includes some more exotic devices such as the SideWinder Game Voice system and the SideWinder Strategic Commander.

The SideWinder family of products was discontinued by Microsoft in 2003, citing poor sales. The company since re-entered the gaming hardware market, attempting to design a standardized gamepad for Windows Vista with both the wired Xbox 360 controller and the Wireless Gaming Receiver that allows the use of the wireless Xbox 360 controller on a PC. In August 2007, Microsoft announced they were relaunching the SideWinder line of gaming peripherals, starting with the SideWinder Mouse. The mouse was given an MSRP of $80 and a launch date of October 2007.

==First generation==
Although intended only for use with Microsoft Windows, Microsoft SideWinder game controllers can also be used with macOS, Mac OS 9 with third-party software, and Linux.

=== Gamepad ===
The original Microsoft SideWinder gamepad had a digital directional pad, six fire buttons, two trigger buttons, and a &quot;Mode&quot; and &quot;Start&quot; button. The original gameport version had a pass-through, so additional joypads or joysticks could be used without unplugging the SideWinder, and also allowed the connection of up to four SideWinder gamepads working simultaneously. Newer USB versions of the SideWinder gamepad have a round digital directional pad instead of the more traditional cross-shaped directional pad, and lack the mode button. The Microsoft SideWinder&#x27;s button layout is very similar to that of the Sega Saturn controller, which was released over the same time period.

The Webdings dingbat font displays a picture of this gamepad for the character [Ä]

=== 3D Pro ===

As Microsoft&#x27;s first SideWinder joystick, the 3D Pro was responsible for setting the overall design as seen in all of Microsoft&#x27;s future joysticks. Designed as a gaming-neutral joystick, rather than a specialized joystick for use with realistic combat flight simulators, the 3D Pro was built with a functional, but low-key geometric design. Intended to rival the other sticks from the time, the 3D Pro included 8 buttons - 4 on the base, 4 on the stick - an 8-way hat switch, a slider-based throttle, and the stick itself was twistable for Z/rudder/spin control. By going with a geometric design however, it meant the 3D Pro lacked an effective adherence to ergonomic principles, making it unsuitable for long gaming sessions for some users.

Electronically, the 3D Pro used a digital/analog hybrid design that was intended to correct the outstanding flaws in traditional analog joysticks, such as drift and CPU overhead, by using a digital/optical tracking mechanism to keep perfect track of the joystick, and a digital communication method over the analog gameport. However, this digital mode required software support, and could not be used with many DOS games at the time (MechWarrior 2 being the only major exception), as most software and gameports were built completely around an analog design.

Additionally, some soundcard gameports, and so-called accelerated game-ports - which attempted to resolve CPU overhead issues presented by polling the gameport directly themselves - such as those produced by Gravis, would not always be able to handle the stick in digital mode.

The 3D Pro had a unique feature in that it could fall-back to an &#x27;analog emulation&#x27; mode, where it could emulate either a CH Flightstick Pro or a Thrustmaster FCS (Selectable by a switch on the base), in environments where the digital mode would not work.

In this mode, manual calibration was required, the four base-buttons no longer function and, the joystick would function essentially like a CH Flightstick Pro or Thrustmaster FCS depending on the mode selector switch.

However, on later operating systems the digital mode would be less and less reliable, and on modern PCs most 3D Pro owners can only run in analog mode. The 3D Pro was popular enough to spawn a successor, the Precision Pro, which was a USB device and, while it did not work in DOS at all, was far more reliable under Windows despite quality issues.

The joystick was widely praised in its inception and was one of the few joysticks with multiple buttons that did not require a keyboard pass-through. The stick was especially popular with MechWarrior and Descent players as it was one of the few multi-button joysticks supported by the games natively.

The joystick&#x27;s popularity has created a small die-hard following, with many people still holding onto them despite their age. This resulted in the creation of a USB adapter for the 3D Pro.

The 3D Pro features as a character (Ã) in the Webdings dingbat font.

=== Standard ===

The SideWinder Standard joystick was a more basic joystick released around the same time as the 3D Pro. It was a simple two button, three axis joystick. It featured a trigger button, a thumb button and a throttle wheel on left side of the base. In addition it had two additional dials on the base for adjustment of the stick itself, one above stick and the other to the right of the stick. It used a gameport connector to interface with the computer.

=== Precision Pro ===

Microsoft introduced the SideWinder Precision Pro in 1995, correcting the ergonomic issues, fixing some of the electrical issues, and adding new features.The Precision Pro introduced a new stick that was far more ergonomic than the &quot;geometric&quot; design of the 3D Pro. Microsoft also gave the rest of the Precision Pro a more rounded design, replacing the rectangular base buttons with more rounded versions at the top of the base, the slider-based throttle with a wheel-based throttle, and the base itself was made more rounded. The Precision Pro also added a shift button to the base, doubling the number of possible button combinations.

Signatures can be seen inside the joystick, on the base coverplate. Fred Iyc and Edie Adams are among the 17 people who have signed it.

For its electronics, the Precision Pro featured a refined hybrid system, resolving some of the hardware compatibility issues with the 3D Pro. However, with the widespread introduction of USB in consumer computers shortly after the Precision Pro was released, Microsoft soon re-released the joystick in a USB-compatible form (joysticks labeled as Part No. X03-57540, Product I.D. 85791-579-2177031-00000). The revised joystick still featured a gameport connector but had additional circuitry for interfacing with USB, and was bundled with a USB converter (a DIY converter project exists). Original Precision Pros remain incompatible with this converter, but a user made converter exists. The creation of the USB converter bypassed the problems with the analog gameport entirely, and as a result became the true solution to the electrical problems. However, due to a flaw in the design of the Precision Pro, in rare cases the stick would build up a static charge in its electronics and require either a complex process to discharge that was not always successful, or simply needed to stay unpowered for a number of hours to slowly discharge on its own. This is also one of the first joysticks to use light sensors instead of potentiometers so it required no calibration, and thus had no electronical moving parts. The only moving parts were mechanical on the throttle and joystick pivots which gave this joystick virtually unlimited lifetime. The Precision Pro 2 had reintroduced potentiometers to save money and thus their lifetime was limited to wear and tear of the potentiometers.

Thanks to the timing of the launch of the Precision Pro to coincide with the widespread launch of USB along the ergonomic corrections and rarity of the static charge problem, the Precision Pro saw a much higher sales volume and review scores than the earlier 3D Pro.

=== Force Feedback Pro ===

From technology acquired from EXOS, Inc, Microsoft then released a force feedback product called the Force Feedback Pro. Built on the design of the Precision Pro, the Force Feedback Pro differed only in the inclusion of motors for the force feedback effects, and the lack of USB compatibility. (A DIY converter project exists.) Due to the inclusion of the motors, the Force Feedback Pro was significantly larger and heavier than the Precision Pro, making it easy to differentiate between the two.

As the PC joystick port is input-only, the only way for data to be sent to the joystick (to trigger force feedback events) is to use the MIDI capabilities of the port. This extension to the original gameport, first popularised by Creative Labs in their early sound cards, was intended to allow MIDI instruments to be connected to the joystick port but is used here to provide bidirectional communication with the joystick instead. Force feedback events are triggered by messages on MIDI channel 6, with effect data uploaded via SysEx messages. This means that force feedback would be unavailable on the earliest of PCs, where the gameports lack MIDI functionality.

=== Precision 2 ===

The basis of Microsoft&#x27;s last generation of SideWinder joysticks, the Precision 2 design was a further refinement of the previous Precision Pro. Compared to the Precision Pro, the Precision 2 dropped the Pro&#x27;s shift button, replaced the throttle wheel with a more traditional lever, and rearranged the face buttons on the stick into a symmetric design. The Precision 2 also dropped all gameport compatibility by only shipping in a USB version, and was slightly smaller and lighter than the Pro. In spite of being Microsoft&#x27;s 2nd-generation USB controller, the Precision 2 in particular seemed to suffer more from the USB SideWinder&#x27;s long-standing static buildup problem than the original Precision Pro.

=== Force Feedback 2 ===
Along with replacing the Precision Pro with a new design, the Force Feedback Pro was replaced with a Precision 2 derivative, the Force Feedback 2. Compared to the Force Feedback Pro and the Precision 2, nothing new was added to the Force Feedback 2 that wasn&#x27;t added to the Precision 2, in fact the shift button was taken away. The overall size and weight difference was not so great with the use of smaller motors. This joystick came in two varieties: one version with a silver trigger and textured hard plastic grip, and an updated version with translucent red parts (trigger, buttons 3 &amp; 4, rounded part at the bottom) that switched to a rubberized coating on the grip. One of the main changes in the Force Feedback 2 from the Force Feedback Pro was removing the external power brick and replacing it with an internal power supply. Since the release of the Force Feedback 2, the stick has garnered a reputation of reliability and resiliency, many Force Feedback 2 sticks are still in use currently. On eBay Sidewinder Force Feedback 2 joysticks regularly sell for more than the original MSRP of $109.

=== Joystick ===
Using the Precision 2 design once again, Microsoft introduced a value-oriented SideWinder joystick, simply called the SideWinder Joystick. In spite of its value designation, the SideWinder Joystick was functionally similar to the Precision 2. The main features dropped were Z-axis control and the 8-way hat switch. Otherwise the differences were cosmetic, including shrinking the base, moving the throttle to the front of the base, and replacing 2 of the rounded buttons on the stick with more rectangular buttons. Support for this joystick was dropped with the advent of Windows XP.

=== Force Feedback Wheel ===
The Microsoft SideWinder Force Feedback Wheel is a steering wheel controller for sim racing. It was the first wheel controller to contain force feedback. The USB version of the wheel is compatible with one PlayStation 2 game, &quot;Tokyo Xtreme Racer Zero&quot;.

=== Strategic Commander ===

The Strategic Commander is designed to complement a standard mouse/keyboard setup for Real Time Strategy games. It features a total of 6 programmable command buttons, 2 zoom buttons, 3 shift buttons, a macro record button and a 3-point configuration switch. The device also has three movement axes: X, Y and Z (rotation). Through extensive configuration of the shift and command buttons, it is possible to create a total of 24 different commands per configuration.

The Strategic Commander is a highly ergonomic device, and resembles a large mouse in shape, contoured for the left hand. It has an upper section attached to a base. On the upper section, the programmable buttons mentioned above are located near the tips of the index, middle and ring fingers for quick access. Three buttons are located near the thumb in an arc.

A feature of the device is that the upper section is also a 2-axis motion controller with additional support for rotation. It allows motion in the X, Y &amp; Z axis (corresponding to Forward, Backwards, Strafe left &amp; right, Turn left &amp; right). This made it useful for first-person shooters, because one can aim weapons or look up and down with the right hand while simultaneously slewing position with the left hand, and change weapons etc. with the left finger buttons.

Software was included for the device to provide hotkeys for a number of (then popular) games. The buttons are also programmable, allowing the device to be used with other games and applications. For example, one application developed at Carnegie Mellon used the device as a peripheral for navigating massive social network maps.

Linux treats this device as a joystick (with all 3 axis and 12 plus 3 buttons) and can be used as one or using various applets can be used as a &quot;joystick action to key press&quot; device (e.g. Joy2Key)

=== Game Voice ===
The Game Voice is an early voice chat device. It was shaped like a hockey puck, with four channel buttons that allowed the user to speak to individual teammates. It could also be set to communicate with the entire team, or globally to all players. The driver software also allowed it to function as a voice command device using programmable macros. The package included a headset with an attached microphone, though these could be substituted with any other PC headset/microphone. The puck acted as an intermediary between the sound card and the sound input/output devices. The headset, along with the system speakers, plugged into the puck, where a switch could be used to set whether sound would be output from the speakers or the headset. The puck also had its own volume control. To provide power for the puck LEDs and drive the voice command and channel functions, a USB connection was also required. Microsoft recommended Game Voice as a microphone for use with the speech recognition feature of Microsoft Office XP.

Microsoft discontinued the product in 2003. By then, the market for voice chat had seen intense competition from downloadable and free-to-use software like Ventrilo and TeamSpeak, among others. These software packages only charge the host or server, whereas each person would have to own a Game Voice in order to use the hardware and software. As a result, the Game Voice ultimately lost that market. However, these competing software packages do not offer voice command systems.

Microsoft has not released the hardware specifications so that an open source driver could be developed. The device is supported under Windows XP, but no new driver is planned for Windows Vista. Despite this, Linux based operating systems can use this device using various third party applets (i.e. Kamevoice)

=== Freestyle Pro ===

The Freestyle Pro, released in 1998, was a unique gamepad, as the up-down-left-right directions in analogue mode were controlled by the physical movement of the controller, more precisely by the absolute pitch and roll position of the pad. (Similar behavior would later be found in the Sony PlayStation 3 SIXAXIS line, introduced in 2006.) Games such as &quot;Motocross Madness&quot; (which was bundled with and designed for the controller) profited from this physical interaction. The left side of the controller features an eight-direction d-pad which function varies depending on which mode the controller is on.

The control pad had a total of ten digital fire buttons: six buttons controlled with the right thumb (named ABC XYZ), two shoulder buttons (one left, one right), and two buttons controlled with the left thumb, one named &quot;start&quot;, the other marked with a &quot;shift key&quot; symbol (as the SideWinder software allowed to use this button to &quot;shift&quot; controls for the ABC XYZ buttons - on the driver side, it was just an action button like the others).

A &quot;sensor&quot; button switched the control pad between analogue mode (green LED) and digital mode (red LED). In analogue mode, the x- and y-axis were controlled by the analogue controller movements, and the D-pad was used as a hat switch. In digital mode, the D-pad controlled the x- and y-axis like a traditional digital control pad (therefore, there was no hat switch function in digital mode).

Due to the release in 1998, at which time USB was just taking off, the Freestyle Pro supported both game port and USB connection. Without the adapter, the controller&#x27;s cable ended in a game port plug. The sale box contained the game port-to-USB adapter for free.

=== Dual Strike ===

The Dual Strike, which debuted in 1999, was Microsoft&#x27;s second notable venture into strange gamepad designs, following the Freestyle Pro. The Dual Strike attempted to blend both mouse and gamepad functions into a single unit. It was composed of two portions; there is a hinge between the two that allows the user to rotate the right side up and down and from side to side. The Dual Strike only supported USB.

=== Sidewinder 92626 ===

This is similar to the Precision Pro and has a USB connection. Circa 2002. Serial numbers begin with 92626.

== Second generation ==

In 2007, following a collaboration with Razer in creating the Microsoft Habu and Microsoft Reclusa, a gaming mouse and gaming keyboard sold under the plain Microsoft Hardware brand, Microsoft resurrected the SideWinder brand with an all-new SideWinder Mouse, designed from the ground up for high-end PC gaming. The design incorporated a number of advanced features including adjustable weights, programmable macro mode, on- the- fly DPI change, and a built-in LCD display, the first ever found in a mouse.

In 2008, Microsoft also released the SideWinder X6 Gaming Keyboard, which is designed to be the keyboard counterpart of the Sidewinder Mouse. It features up to 30 programmable macro keys, volume control, media control, a detachable numpad and backlighting. Along with this keyboard a new mouse was released dubbed the SideWinder X5. The X5 has a more basic function set than its predecessor but was well received because of its lower price. Its shape is the same as the original but without the LCD, weight adjusting and metal side buttons. It also comes with a complete black design with red &quot;LED Jets&quot; on the back to make it stand out from the original and better fit the X6 keyboard.

In February 2009, Microsoft released another update to the SideWinder line, the SideWinder X8 gaming mouse. This new iteration incorporated new Microsoft &quot;BlueTrack&quot; tracking technology, intended to provide better tracking on non-standard surfaces. In addition, the mouse was made wireless, and the maximum DPI sensitivity was upped to 4000.

In March 2010, Microsoft released a second gaming keyboard, the Sidewinder X4. In comparison with the earlier X6, anti-ghosting technology was added. However, the detachable numpad was removed, and a numpad was instead attached permanently to the keyboard.

As of October 2014, Microsoft no longer offers any gaming mice or keyboards in the US.

<text>Source of Labor was a rap band formed in 1989 in Seattle, Washington, consisting of Wordsayer, Negus I, DJ Kamikaze, and later, Vitamin D.

== History ==
Wordsayer and Negus I are brothers and Kamikaze was their roommate when they began performing at Langston Hughes Performing Arts Center in Seattle&#x27;s Central District in 1989. Source of Labor began a collective at that time that evolved into a record label called Jasiri Media Group. Their first show in downtown Seattle was in 1993 at the Crocodile Cafe.

Source of Labor was loosely associated with the female rap act Beyond Reality, whose lead, MC Kylea, was Wordsayer&#x27;s partner and mother of his first child. Both performed at the all-day Rap Festival (featuring 30 or more of the top regional rap/hip-hop acts of that time). The event, much like Lollapolooza, was strictly Rap and was called &quot;Phunky Phat 95.&quot; It took place at the Evergreen State College during the summer of 1995. Source of Labor performed at Seattle&#x27;s arts festival, Bumbershoot, and inspired Macklemore to become a rapper. Wordsayer later gave Macklemore his first show at age 15. Source of Labor has been an inspiration to many other artists like Nardwuar the Human Serviette, Ryan Lewis, Strath Shepard, and Thee Satisfaction.

Source of Labor&#x27;s contributions to Northwest hip hop were extremely influential in shaping post-Nastmix hip-hop. They were part of Seattle&#x27;s second hip hop movement, the first wave centering around Nastymix recording artist Sir-Mix-a-Lot. Some credit the group&#x27;s front man, Wordsayer, with personally moving hip-hop out of Seattle&#x27;s Central District and into the rest of the city. In 1997 Source of Labor&#x27;s DJ Kamikaze was replaced by Vitamin D.

Source of Labor disbanded in 2004 and the artists went on to focus on their individual projects. Wordsayer continued producing and taught poetry at Franklin High School. Vitamin D continued his rapping and production career.

Wordsayer, born Jonathan Moore, died of kidney failure in March 2017.

<doc id="271310" wikidata="Q605095" url="?curid=271310" title="Budget constraint">
<text>In economics, a budget constraint represents all the combinations of goods and services that a consumer may purchase given current prices within their given income. Consumer theory uses the concepts of a budget constraint and a preference map as tools to examine the parameters of consumer choices . Both concepts have a ready graphical representation in the two-good case. The consumer can only purchase as much as their income will allow, hence they are constrained by their budget. The equation of a budget constraint is formula_1 where formula_2 is the price of good , and formula_3 is the price of good , and is income.

== Soft budget constraint ==
The concept of soft budget constraint is commonly applied to centrally planned economies, later economies in transition. This theory was originally proposed by János Kornai in 1979. It was used to explain the &quot;economic behavior in socialist economies marked by shortage”. In the socialist transition economy there are soft budget constraint on firms because of subsidies, credit and price support. This theory implies that the survival of a firm depends on financial assistance, especially in a socialist country. The soft budget constraint syndrome usually occurs in the paternalistic role of the State in economic organizations, such as public and private companies and non-profit organizations. János Kornai also highlighted that there are five dimensions to evaluate the post-socialist transition, including fiscal subsidy, soft taxation, soft bank credit (non-performing loans), soft trade credit (the accumulate rears between firms) and wage arrears.

According to the point of view by Cllower [1965], budget constraints are a rational planning assumption with two main attributes. The first is that budget constraints refer to the decision makers&#x27; behavioural characteristics --- selling output or acquiring asset income to compensate for spending. This means that adjustment limitation on financial resources are obvious. The second is to impose constraints on prior variables, such as constraints on current actual demand based on expectations of future financial conditions.

The reason for the soft budget constraints is that the excess of expenditure over income will be paid by additional organizations (the State). In addition, the decision maker expects such external financial assistance to be highly probable based on his actions. The further explanation is the more excess spending is covered by external aid, the budget constraints will be more softer.

=== Bank ===
Bank supervision refers to the supervision on the capital adequacy ratio of banks. When the bank&#x27;s capital is difficult to finance due to the default of a large number of loans, it can prevent the bank from going bankrupt with the aid of the government, then it will occurs the soft budget constraint of the bank.

Dewatripont and Maskin(1995) point out the presence of sunk costs in existing loans may lead to soft budget constraints when banks need additional financial assistance. The internalization of external options can expand the model by allowing banks to allocate funds between new loans and refinancing old loans. Through investment screening and monitoring technology, banks can improve the relative profitability of new loans, thus breaking the equilibrium of soft budget constraints.

== Uses ==
=== Individual choice ===

Consumer behaviour is a maximization problem. It means making the most of our limited resources to maximize our utility. As consumers are insatiable, and utility functions grow with quantity, the only thing that limits our consumption is our own budget.

In general, the budget set (all bundle choices that are on or below the budget line) represents all possible bundles of goods an individual can afford given their income and the prices of goods. A common assumption underlying consumer theory is the concept of well-behaved preferences, and as such, the direction of an individual&#x27;s preferences will point 45 degrees from the origin. When behaving rationally, an individual consumer should choose to consume goods at the point where the most preferred available indifference curve on their preference map is tangent to their budget constraint. The tangent point (the xy coordinate) represents the amount of goods x and y the consumer should purchase to fully utilize their budget to obtain maximum utility. It is important to note that the optimal consumption bundle will not always be an interior solution. If the solution to the optimality condition leads to a bundle that is not feasible, the consumer&#x27;s optimal bundle will be a corner solution which suggests the goods or inputs are perfect substitutes. A line connecting all points of tangency between the indifference curve and the budget constraint is called the expansion path.

All two dimensional budget constraints are generalized into the equation:

formula_1

Where:
* formula_5 money income allocated to consumption (after saving and borrowing)
* formula_6 the price of a specific good
* formula_7 the price of all other goods
* formula_8 amount purchased of a specific good
* formula_9 amount purchased of all other goods

The equation can be rearranged to represent the shape of the curve on a graph:

formula_10, where formula_11 is the y-intercept and formula_12 is the slope, representing a downward sloping budget line.

The factors that can shift the budget line are a change in income (m), a change in the price of a specific good (formula_2), or a change in the price of all other goods (formula_3).

=== International economics ===
A production-possibility frontier is a constraint in some ways analogous to a budget constraint, showing limitations on a country&#x27;s production of multiple goods based on the limitation of available factors of production. Under autarky this is also the limitation of consumption by individuals in the country. However, the benefits of international trade are generally demonstrated through allowance of a shift in the consumption-possibility frontiers of each trade partner which allows access to a more appealing indifference curve.
In the &quot;toolbox&quot; Hecksher-Ohlin and Krugman models of international trade, the budget constraint of the economy (its CPF) is determined by the terms-of-trade (TOT) as a downward-sloped line with slope equal to those TOTs of the economy. (The TOTs are given by the price ratio Px/Py, where x is the exportable commodity and y is the importable).

== Many goods ==
While low-level demonstrations of budget constraints are often limited to less than two good situations which provide easy graphical representation, it is possible to demonstrate the relationship between multiple goods through a budget constraint.

There are 2 requirements for this case. The first one is that the constraint is not affected if the prices are multiplied by any positive scalar. The second one is that all commodities are desirable and the constraint will always be binding. 

In such a case, assuming there are formula_15 goods, called formula_16 for formula_17, that the price of good formula_16 is denoted by formula_19, and if formula_20 is the total amount that may be spent, then the budget constraint is:
:formula_21

Further, if the consumer spends his income entirely, the budget constraint binds:
:formula_22
In this case, the consumer cannot obtain an additional unit of good formula_16 without giving up some other good. For example, he could purchase an additional unit of good formula_16 by giving up formula_25 units of good formula_26

== Borrowing and lending ==
Budget constraints can be expanded outward or contracted inward through borrowing and lending. By borrowing money in a period, usually at an interest rate r, a consumer can choose to forgo consumption in future periods for extra consumption in the borrowing period. Choosing to borrow would expand the budget constraint in this period and contract budget constraints in future periods. Alternatively, consumers can choose to lend their money in the current period, usually at a lending rate l. Lending contracts the budget constraint in the current period but expands budget constraints in future periods. According to behavioral economics, choices on borrowing and lending may also be affected by Present bias. In economics, there are two groups of present biased individuals, sophisticated individuals who are aware of their present bias, and naive individuals who are not aware of their present bias.

<doc id="271315" wikidata="Q1127054" url="?curid=271315" title="Game port">
<text>The game port is a device port that was found on IBM PC compatible and other computer systems throughout the 1980s and 1990s. It was the traditional connector for joystick input, and occasionally MIDI devices, until made obsolete by USB in the late 1990s.

Originally located on a dedicated Game Control Adapter expansion card, the game port was later integrated with PC sound cards, and still later on the PC&#x27;s motherboard. During the transition to USB, many input devices used the game port and a USB adapter dongle was included for systems without a game port.

==History==
===Pre-IBM game ports===


At the time IBM was developing its game port, there was no industry standard for controller ports, although the Atari joystick port was close. It was introduced in 1977 with the Atari Video Computer System, and was later used on the VIC-20 (1980), Commodore 64 (1982), and Amstrad&#x27;s PC1512 (1986).

In contrast with the IBM design, the Atari port was primarily designed for digital inputs (including a pair of two-axis/four-contact digital joysticks, each with a single pushbutton trigger). Its only analog connections were intended for paddles -- although, as there were two analog inputs per port, each port could theoretically support a two-axis analog joystick, touchpad, trackball, or mouse (some of these being eventually developed for Atari systems).

The Apple II, BBC Micro, TRS-80 Color Computer, and other popular 8-bit machines all used different, incompatible, joysticks and ports. In most respects, the IBM design was similar to, or more advanced than, existing designs.

===Initial IBM PC type game ports===
The IBM PC game port first appeared during the initial launch of the original IBM PC in 1981, in the form of an optional US$55 expansion card known as the Game Control Adapter. The design allowed for four analog axes and four buttons on one port, allowing two joysticks or four paddles to be connected via a special &quot;Y-splitter&quot; cable.

Originally available only as add-on that took up an entire slot, game ports remained relatively rare in the early days of the IBM PC, and most games used the keyboard as an input. IBM did not release a joystick of its own for the PC, which did not help. The most common device available was the Kraft joystick, originally developed for the Apple II but easily adapted to the IBM with the addition of another button on the back of the case. When IBM finally did release a joystick, for the IBM PCjr, it was a version of the Kraft stick. However, it connected to the computer using two incompatible 7-pin connectors, which were mechanically connected together as part of a larger multi-pin connector on the back of the machine. This eliminated the need for the Y-adapter. Adapters for Atari-style &quot;digital&quot; sticks were also common during this era.

The game port became somewhat more common in the mid-1980s, as improving electronic density began to produce expansion cards with ever-increasing functionality. By 1983, it was common to see cards combining memory, game ports, serial and parallel ports and a realtime clock on a single expansion card. The era of combo expansion cards largely came to an end by the late 1980s, as many of the separate functions normally provided on plug-in boards became common features of the motherboard itself. Game ports were not always part of this supported set of ports.

===Integration with sound cards===
However, the game port was given a major boost in usage in 1989, with the introduction of the first Sound Blaster. As sound cards were primarily used with computer games, Creative Labs took the opportunity to include a game port on the card, producing an all-in-one gaming solution. At the same time, they re-purposed two otherwise redundant pins on the port, 12 and 15, to produce a serial bus with enough performance to drive an external MIDI port adapter. Previous MIDI systems like the MPU-401 used their own separate expansion cards and a complex external adapter, whereas the Sound Blaster only required an inexpensive adapter to produce the same result. By the end of the year the Sound Blaster was the best selling expansion card on the PC, and the game port was receiving widespread software support.

With the exception of laptops—for which companies released joystick adapters for parallel or serial ports, which needed custom software drivers—through the early 1990s, the game port was universally supported on sound cards, and increasingly became built-in features as motherboards added sound support of their own. This remained true through the second half of the 1990s, by which time integrated sound support had displaced the third-party sound card to a large degree. By the early 2000s, such support was so widespread that newer sound cards began to dispense with the game port as it was certain the machine they would be used in already had such support, including MIDI. Every Sound Blaster card from the first model up to August 2001 included a game port. In 2001 the Sound Blaster Audigy moved the game port to a second expansion slot, which connected to a header on the card.

===Replacement by USB===
The introduction of the first USB standard in 1996 was aimed squarely at the sort of roles provided by the game port, but initially had little market impact. The subsequent release of the iMac, which featured no legacy ports in favor of USB, started a rapid expansion of USB in the market. This led both to new gaming devices using USB, as well as the profusion of adapters. For instance, the 1997 Microsoft Precision Pro joystick was re-introduced in a version that used a game port connector, but also included a USB adapter in the box. The rapid takeover of USB meant that this was superfluous when the Precision Pro 2 was released the next year in 1998. By 2000, game ports were purely for backward compatibility with now outdated devices.

Microsoft Windows discontinued support for the game port with Windows Vista, though USB converters can serve as a workaround.

==Hardware==
The game port&#x27;s DA-15 connector includes inputs for a total of four analog channels and four buttons. These were almost always implemented as two joysticks with two buttons each, but it is also possible to support four paddle controllers each with one button, or a single gamepad with two analog sticks and four buttons using the same inputs. The port includes redundant pins, including a total of four +5 V supplies, and separate grounds for most of the buttons. In most similar game ports, like those on the Atari, a single +5 V and ground is used for all the channels.

The game port was originally mounted on a dedicated ISA card. Since the early 1990s, when the game port moved from dedicated expansion cards to PC I/O or sound cards, these connectors have usually doubled as connectors for MIDI instruments; two of the redundant +5 V and GND pins of the original standard were rededicated to MIDI input and output to make this possible. To use a game port with MIDI instruments, a break-out cable with the necessary opto-isolation hardware and compatible connectors is required - typically these consisted of a male and a female DA-15 and two male 5-pin DIN connectors. For many sound cards, the game port midi capabilities were based around the Roland MPU-401 MIDI interface (in UART mode only), however some older sound cards (notably the original Sound Blaster and Sound Blaster Pro) used a proprietary interface that was not compatible with the MPU-401.

The analog channels are read by sending voltage into the line, through a potentiometer in the controller, in this case 100,000 ohm, and then into a capacitor. The value is read by timing how long it took for the voltage in the capacitor to cross a certain threshold. The rate varied depending on the resistance, and thus physical position, of the potentiometer. In the Atari port, which had similar analog channels, there is a convenient timer available in the form of the video clock circuitry. In the PC there is no similar clock because video functionality is normally provided on an expansion card. Instead, a software routine needs to first trigger capacitor discharge by issuing an IO write to the Gameport, and then measure the time it takes to charge them again by constantly polling Gameport. Using original IBM formula, Time = 24.2 μs + 0.011 (r) μs and assuming 100Kohm potentiometers this process can take up to 1.1ms per readout, or over 60ms if we decide to read joystick position 60 times a second. This significant overhead was the reason why using original Gameport on the PC could consume up to 10% of CPU time independent of CPU speed.

==Software==
Initially there was no standardized software for running the joysticks; applications would poll the known ports associated with the sticks as part of their game loop. This did, however, leave the implementation of a lot of housekeeping tasks to every application that used them, such as looking for and enumerating the active devices, and calibrating them. This changed in Windows 95, which introduced standardized Windows Registry entries to hold these values and make it easier for applications to find these devices. DirectX further expanded the options through DirectInput with the &quot;joystick mini-driver&quot; with a number of new capabilities. Among these were support for up to six analog axes, a point-of-view hat, and up to 64 buttons. It also supported up to 16 such devices, which could be connected using any interface, not just the game port.

<text>Banat ( , ; ; ; ) is a geographical and historical region located in the Pannonian Basin that straddles Central and Eastern Europe. It is divided among three countries: the eastern part lies in western Romania (the counties of Timiș, Caraș-Severin, Arad south of the Mureș river, and the western part of Mehedinți); the western part of Banat is in northeastern Serbia (mostly included in Vojvodina, except for a small part included in the Belgrade Region); and a small northern part lies within southeastern Hungary (Csongrád-Csanád County).

The region&#x27;s historical ethnic diversity was severely affected by the events of World War II. Today, Banat is mostly populated by ethnic Romanians, Serbs and Hungarians, but small populations of other ethnic groups also live in the region. Nearly all are citizens of either Serbia, Romania or Hungary.

== Name ==

During the Middle Ages, the term &quot;banate&quot; designated a frontier province led by a military governor who was called a &quot;ban&quot;. Such provinces existed mainly in South Slavic, Hungarian and Romanian lands. In South Slavic and other regional languages, terms for &quot;banate&quot; were: Serbian / , Hungarian , Romanian and Latin . Several theories have been proposed for the etymological origin of the regionym &quot;Banat&quot;. A first theory claims that it comes from the root of a verb found in several Germanic peoples, namely . This term means &#x27;to proclaim&#x27; or &#x27;to announce&#x27;. From there it passed into medieval Latin, under the form , which means – among the Frankish peoples, for example – &#x27;proclamation&#x27;, but also the district on which the said proclamation was to have effects. Another theory puts forward the Persian origin of the word &quot;ban&quot;; in Persian () means &#x27;master&#x27;. From this language, it would have been taken over by the Avars and brought to Pannonia, where they ruled in the 6th–8th centuries. Another interpretation is also related to Avars, according to which the origin of the word &quot;ban&quot; would come from the name of the first khagan of the Avar Khaganate, Bayan I. These views are contradicted by those who believe that &quot;ban&quot; comes from an old Proto-Indo-European root, &quot;&quot;, which means &#x27;to speak&#x27;.

At the time of the medieval Hungarian kingdom, the territory of modern Banat appeared in written sources as &quot;Temesköz&quot; (first mentioned in 1374). The Hungarian name mainly referred to the lowland areas between the Mureș, Tisza and Danube rivers. Its Ottoman name was &quot;Eyalet of Temeşvar&quot; (later &quot;Eyalet of Yanova&quot;). During the Turkish occupation, the territory of Temesköz (Banat) was also called (&#x27;the country of the Serbs&#x27;, 1577). For Romanians, the region was also known as .

In the early modern period, there were two banates that partially or entirely included the territory of what is referred to in the current era as Banat: the Banate of Lugoj and Caransebeș in the 16th–17th centuries and the Banate of Temeswar in the 18th–19th centuries. The word &quot;Banat&quot; without any other qualification typically refers to the historical Banate of Temeswar, which acquired this title after the 1718 Treaty of Passarowitz. The name was also used from 1941 to 1944, during Axis occupation, for the short-lived political entity (see: Banat (1941–44)), which covered only today&#x27;s Serbian part of the historical Banat.

The name &quot;Banat&quot; is similar in different languages of the region; , Serbo-Croatian: /, or , , , , /, , , . Some of these languages would also have other terms, from their own frame of reference, to describe this historical and geographic region.

== Geography ==

Banat is defined as the part of the Pannonian Basin bordered by the Danube to the south, the Tisza to the west, the Mureș to the north and the Southern Carpathians to the east. The historical Banat totals an area of 28,526 km2. Various sources indicate figures slightly different from this. When the province was divided in 1920, Romania was assigned an area of 18,966 km2 (approximately ⅔ of the total), the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes 9,276 km2 (approximately ⅓ of the total), and Hungary 284 km2 (approximately 1% of the total).

The Romanian Banat is mountainous in the south and southeast, while in the north, west and southwest it is flat and in some places marshy. Some Banat mountain massifs constitute the western branch of the Southern Carpathians, i.e., Țarcu Mountains and Cerna Mountains. The Poiana Ruscă Mountains and Banat Mountains with the Semenic, Anina, Dognecea, Almăj and Locva divisions are part of the Western Romanian Carpathians. The western pre-mountainous hills make up about a third of the historical Banat territory. Their altitude varies between 200 and 400 meters. The high plain (with altitudes of over 100 meters, up to 140 meters) is represented by the plains of Vinga, Buziaș, Gătaia and Fizeș. The plains with intermediate altitudes, between 100 and 130 meters, are the plains of Hodoni, Duboz, Tormac, Jamu Mare, Arad and Sânnicolau Mare, and the low plain (with altitudes below 100 meters) is represented by the river meadows, the floodplains before the extensive regularization works. These plains, components of the Pannonian Plain, represent another third of the Banat area. Worth mentioning are the two extinct volcanoes from Lucareț and Gătaia: Piatra Roșie (211 m) and Șumigu (200 m), respectively.

The relief of Serbian Banat is monotonous, except for a few morphological units: the Vršac Mountains, the Bela Crkva basin and the east Banat alluvium. The largest stretch of sand in Europe, today stabilized and covered with vegetation, &quot;Deliblatska Peščara&quot;, also lies in Serbian Banat.
=== Climate ===
The climate of Banat is predominantly temperate (Cfb, according to Köppen classification), with a northeastward increase of continental and orographic effects (Dfb). Frequent cyclones from the Mediterranean cause positive precipitation anomalies especially in the western parts and, due to the maritime influence, winters are mild and short, but when northeastern conditions prevail, harsh frosts may occur. Mean annual temperatures range between 12 °C (with average summer temperatures above 22 °C in July) and 6 °C towards the eastern highlands. Besides, temperature inversions occur in the valleys and in the depressions of the Banat Hills, the bottom being colder than the slopes. The thermal and dynamic convection produced on the slopes causes greater cloudiness throughout the year; humidity and precipitation are higher.

=== Hydrography ===

Considering the low and undesiccated land, there is a relatively large number of watercourses in Banat. The rivers bordering the area and delimiting it from the rest of the territories are Mureș, Tisza and Danube. With the exception of some small local tributaries, the Mureș does not have a very large area. The other rivers that have their source in Banat are direct or indirect tributaries of the Tisza and the Danube. The Danube forms between Baziaș and Porțile de Fier, over a distance of 140 km, the so-called Iron Gates. Tisza is the river that separates the Banat from the Hungarian areas to the west and divides the current Vojvodina into two parts. A wide river that meanders through the plain that bears its name. 

The Timiș/Tamiš is the largest inland river of Banat, which has its sources on the eastern slopes of the Semenic Mountains, in Caraș-Severin County. The river is formed at the confluence of three branches: Semenic, Grădiște and Brebu. It crosses the entire Timiș County, then passes into Serbia, where it flows into the Danube, at Pančevo. The most important cities through which Timiș passes are Caransebeș, Lugoj and Pančevo.

The Bega/Begej springs from the Poiana Ruscă Mountains, crosses the area of Făget and Lugoj, passes through Timișoara, then descends through a channel, flowing into the Tisza, at Titel. Bega and Aranca/Zlatica flow into the Tisza, and Timiș with its tributaries, such as Pogăniș, Bârzava/Brzava, Caraș/Karaš and Nera, flow into the Danube.

There are no large natural lakes. In the past, there were many lakes, ponds and swamps in Banat, which were drained by land reclamation carried out at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. There are bigger lakes only south of Zrenjanin.

== History ==

The first known inhabitants of present-day Banat were the Neolithic populations. In the 4th century BC, Celtic tribes settled in this area. Various Hallstatt and La Tène objects were found in this area. The most important tribes were the Scordisci and the Taurisci. The Scordisci, who formed a powerful state even minted their own coins, imitating the Macedonian tetradrachm. The Scordisci subdued as all the other tribes in the region to the getic ruler Burebista, therefore their region was part of the Dacian kingdom under Burebista in the first century BC, but the balance of power in the area partially changed during the campaigns of Augustus. At the beginning of the 2nd century AD, Trajan led two wars against the Dacians: the campaigns of 101–102, and 105–106. Eventually, the territory of Banat fell under Roman rule. It became an important link between Dacia province and the other parts of the Empire. Roman rule had a significant impact: castra and guard stations were established and roads and public buildings built. The public bath establishments of Ad Aquas Herculis, modern-day Băile Herculane were also established. Some of the important Roman settlements in Banat were: Arcidava (today Vărădia),Centum Putea, Berzobis (today Berzovia), Tibiscum (today Jupa), Agnaviae (today Zăvoi), Ad Pannonios (today Teregova), Praetorium (today Mehadia), and Dierna (today Orșova).

In 273 AD Emperor Aurelian withdrew the Roman Army from Dacia. The area fell into the hands of foederati such as the Sarmatians (Iazyges, Roxolani, Limigantes) and later the Goths, who also took control of other parts of Dacia.
=== Migration Period and Early Middle Ages ===
The Goths were forced out by the Huns, who organized their ruling center in the Pannonian Basin (the Pannonian Plain), an area that included the northwestern part of today&#x27;s Banat. After the death of Attila, the Hunnic empire disintegrated in days. The previously subjected Gepids formed a new kingdom in the area, only to be defeated 100 years later by the Avars.

One governing center of the Avars was formed in the region, which played an important role in the Avar–Byzantine wars. An inscription on one of the vessels from the Treasure of Sânnicolau Mare (which origin is disputed) recorded names of two local rulers, Butaul and Buyla, who bore Slavic ruling titles of župan. The Avar rule over the area lasted until the 9th century, until Charlemagne&#x27;s campaigns. Banat region became part of the First Bulgarian Empire a few decades later. Archaeological evidence shows the Avars and Gepids lived here until the middle of the 10th century. The Avar rule had triggered considerable Slavic migration to the southern Pannonian plain and to the Balkans.

In 895, the Hungarians living in Etelköz entered the Byzantine-Bulgarian war as allies of Byzantium, and defeated the Bulgars. Because of this, the Bulgarians allied with the Pechenegs, who attacked the Hungarian settlements. This led to the process of what is known as the Hungarian conquest of the Pannonian basin, referred to by them as &quot;hometaking&quot; (&quot;&quot;) in Hungarian. This also resulted in the loss of part of the territories north of the Danube for the Bulgarian Empire.

According to &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; chronicle, a local ruler known as Glad ruled over Banat and his army was formed by Vlachs, Bulgarians, and Cumans. Ahtum was another early-11th-century ruler in the territory now known as Banat. His primary source is the Long Life of Saint Gerard, a 14th-century hagiography. Chanadinus, Ahtum&#x27;s former commander-in-chief, defeated and killed Ahtum, occupying his realm.

=== Hungarian administration (11th–16th centuries) ===

Banat was administered by the First Bulgarian Empire from the 9th to the 11th century, but that control gradually migrated to the Kingdom of Hungary which administered it from the 11th century up until 1552, when the region of Temesvár (today Timișoara) was captured by the Ottoman Empire. 

The area of the Timiș river was not the land of the Hungarian royal tribe. When nomadic Hungarians came to Transylvania there was no direct Bulgarian political rule there. In the eastern part of the Carpathian basin the Byzantine rite became more influential after Ajtony&#x27;s () conversion to Christianity. This was halted with the establishment of the Kingdom of Hungary. István I reasserted dominance over the last local leader, Ajtony. He was a semi-independent ruler of Banat and a formally baptized Christian who constructed a Byzantine monastery at Morisena, but still kept 7 wives and worshiped Pagan gods at his Court. His vassal Csanád defeated him by the will of King Stephen I of Hungary. The territory of the modern Banat did not form a separate territorial unit in medieval Kingdom of Hungary, it was an integral part of it. The territory was shared by Krassó, Keve, Temes, Csanád, Arad and Torontál counties.

In 1233, under the Kingdom of Hungary administration, the Banate of Severin, a military frontier area was formed, including some eastern parts of the modern Banat. In the 14th century, the region became of priority concern to the Kingdom, as the southern border of Banat was the most important defensive line against Ottoman expansion from the southeast.
=== Ottoman administration (1552–1716) ===

The Ottoman Empire took over the area and incorporated Banat in 1552. It was absorbed as an Ottoman eyalet (province) named the Eyalet of Temeşvar. The Banat region was mainly populated by Rascians (Serbs) in the west, and Vlachs (Romanians) in the east. Thus, in some historical sources, the region of Banat was referred to as &quot;Rascia&quot;, while in others as &quot;Wallachia&quot;. Numerous Ottoman Muslims settled in the area, living mostly in the cities and associated with trade and administration.

Not all of Banat fell immediately under Turkish rule. Eastern regions around Lugoj and Caransebeș came under the rule of Princes of Transylvania. In that area, a new banate was formed, known as the Banate of Lugoj and Caransebeș.

In the spring of 1594, shortly after the beginning of the Austro-Turkish War (1593-1606), local Serbian Christians, in the Eyalet of Temeşvar, started an uprising against Turkish rule. The local Romanians also participated in this uprising. At first, rebels were successful. They took the city of Vršac and various other towns in Banat and started negotiations with Prince of Transylvania. One of the leaders of the uprising was local Serbian Orthodox Bishop Theodore.

In the middle of the 17th century, the territory of Banate of Lugoj and Caransebeș finally fell under Turkish rule and was incorporated into Eyalet of Temeşvar.

During Austro-Turkish War (1683–1699), local Serbian uprisings broke out in various parts of Eyalet of Temeşvar. Austrian armies and Serbian militia tried to drive out sultans army from the province, but Turks succeeded in holding the fort of Temesvár. In 1689, Serbian patriarch Arsenije III sided with Austrians. His jurisdiction (including the province) was officially recognized by the charters of emperor Leopold I in 1690, 1691 and 1695. Under the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699), northern parts of the Eyalet of Temeşvar were incorporated into the Habsburg monarchy, but the territory of Banat remained under Turkish rule.
=== Habsburg administration (1716–1867) ===


At the beginning of the next Austro-Turkish War (1716–1718), Prince Eugene of Savoy took the Banat region from the Turks. After the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718), the region became a province of the Habsburg Monarchy. It was not incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary. Special provincial administration was established, centered in Temesvár.

In 1738, over 50 Romanian villages from Serbia and Banat were destroyed and dwellers murdered by Austrians and Serb militia during a revolt of Romanians. Also governor of the province was not given the title of &quot;ban&quot;, the region became known as the &quot;Banate of Temes&quot; or Banat of Temeswar. It remained a separate province within the Habsburg monarchy and under military administration until 1751, when Empress Maria Theresa of Austria reorganized the province, dividing it between military and civil administration. The Banat of Temeswar province was abolished in 1778, when civilian part of the region was incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary and divided into counties. The southern part of the Banat region remained within the Military Frontier (Banat Krajina) until the Frontier was abolished in 1871.

During the Ottoman rule, parts of Banat had a low population density due to years of warfare, and some local residents also died during Habsburg-Ottoman wars and Prince Eugene of Savoy&#x27;s conquest. Much of the area had reverted to nearly uninhabited marsh, heath and forest. Count Claudius Mercy (1666–1734), who was appointed governor of the Banat of Temeswar in 1720, took numerous measures for the regeneration of Banat. He recruited German artisans and especially farmers from Bavaria and other southern areas as colonists, allowing them privileges such as keeping their language and religion in their settlements. Farmers brought their families and belongings on rafts down the Danube River, and were encouraged to restore farming in the area. They cleared the marshes near the Danube and Tisa rivers, helped build roads and canals, and re-established agriculture. Trade was also encouraged.

Maria Theresa also took a direct interest in Banat; she colonized the region with large numbers of German farmers, who were admired for their agricultural skills. She encouraged the exploitation of the mineral wealth of the country, and generally developed the measures that were introduced by Count Mercy. German settlers arrived from Swabia, Alsace and Bavaria, as did German-speaking colonists from Austria. Many settlements in the eastern Banat were developed by Germans and had ethnic-German majorities. The ethnic Germans in the Banat region became known as the Danube Swabians, or &quot;Donauschwaben&quot;. After years of separation from their original German provinces, their language was markedly different, preserving historic characteristics.

Similarly, a minority coming from French-speaking or linguistically mixed communes in Lorraine maintained the French language for several generations, and developed a specific ethnic identity, later known as Banat French, &quot;Français du Banat&quot;.

In 1779, the Banat region was incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, and the three counties of Torontal, Temes and Karasch were created. In 1848, after the May Assembly, the western Banat became part of the Serbian Vojvodina, a Serbian autonomous region within the Habsburg Monarchy. During the Revolutions of 1848–1849, Banat was respectively held by Serbian and Hungarian troops.

After the Revolution of 1848–1849, Banat (together with Syrmia and Bačka) was designated as a separate Austrian crownland known as the Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat. In 1860 this province was abolished and most of its territory was incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.

The Serbian Banat (Western Banat) was part of Serbian Vojvodina (1848–1849) and part of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat (1849–1860). After 1860, later Serbian Banat was part of Torontal and Temes counties of Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. The center of Torontal county was Großbetschkerek (Hungarian: Nagybecskerek, Serbian: Veliki Bečkerek), the current Zrenjanin.

=== Hungarian administration (1867–1918) ===

In 1867, after the Austro-Hungarian compromise the territory returned again to Hungarian administration. After 1871, the former Military Frontier, located in southern parts of Banat, came under civil administration and was incorporated into Banat&#x27;s counties. Krassó and Szörény were united into Krassó-Szörény in 1881.
=== The Banat Question at the end of First World War ===
In 1918, the Banat Republic was proclaimed in Timișoara in October, and the government of Hungary recognized its independence. However, it was short-lived. After just two weeks, Serbian troops invaded the region and took control. From November 1918 to March 1919, western and central parts of Banat were governed by Serbian administration from Novi Sad, as part of the Banat, Bačka and Baranja province of the Kingdom of Serbia and newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (which was later renamed as Yugoslavia).

In the wake of the Declaration of Union of Transylvania with Romania on December 1, 1918, and the Declaration of Unification of Banat, Bačka and Baranja with Serbia on November 25, 1918, most of Banat was (on July 26, 1919) divided between Romania (Krassó-Szörény completely, two-thirds of Temes, and a small part of Torontál) and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (most of Torontál, and one-third of Temes). A small area near Szeged was assigned to the newly independent Hungary. These borders were confirmed by the 1919 Treaty of Versailles and the 1920 Treaty of Trianon.

At the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the delegates of the Romanian and some German communities voted for union with Romania during the Great National Assembly of Alba Iulia; the delegates of the Serbian, Bunjevac and other Slavic and non-Slavic communities (including some Germans) voted for union with Serbia during the Great People&#x27;s Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs in Banat, Bačka and Baranja; while the Hungarian minority remained loyal to the government in Budapest. Besides these declarations, no other plebiscite was held.
=== Romanian Banat since the First World War ===


In 1938, the counties of Timiș-Torontal, Caraș, Severin, Arad and Hunedoara were joined to form ținutul Timiș, which roughly encompassed the area typically called Banat in Romania.

On 6 September 1950, the province was replaced by the Timișoara Region (formed by the present-day counties of Timiș and Caraș-Severin). In 1956, the southern half of the existing Arad Region was incorporated to the Timișoara Region. In December 1960, the Timișoara Region was renamed the Banat Region.

On 17 February 1968, a new territorial division was made and today&#x27;s Timiș, Caraș-Severin and Arad counties were formed.

Since 1998, Romania has been divided into eight development regions, acting as divisions that coordinate and implement regional development. The Vest development region is composed of four counties: Arad, Timiș, Hunedoara and Caraș-Severin; thus it has almost same borders as the Timiș Province (&quot;ținutul Timiș&quot;) of 1938. The Vest development region is also a part of the Danube-Criș-Mureș-Tisa Euroregion.

=== Serbian Banat since the First World War ===

The region was claimed by the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes between 1918 and 1922 (as the province of Banat, Bačka and Baranja between 1918 and 1919) and from 1922 to 1929 it was divided between Belgrade oblast and Podunavlje oblast. In 1929, most of the region was incorporated into the Danube Banovina (Danubian Banat), a province of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, while the city of Pančevo was incorporated into self-governed Belgrade district.

During World War II, the Axis Powers occupied this area and partitioned it. Nazi Germany had been intent on expanding into eastern Europe to incorporate what it called the &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot;, people of ethnic German descent. They established the political entity known as Banat in 1941. It included only the western part of the historical Banat region, which was formerly part of Yugoslavia. It was formally under the control of the Serbian puppet Government of National Salvation in Belgrade led by Milan Nedić. It theoretically had limited jurisdiction over all of the territory under German Military Administration in Serbia, but in practice the local minority of ethnic Germans (Danube Swabians or Shwoveh) held the political power within Banat. The regional civilian commissioner was Josef Lapp. The head of the ethnic German group was Sepp Janko. Following the ousting of Axis forces in 1944, this German-ruled region was dissolved. As a consequence, much of the local Germans fled from the region together with defeated German army in 1944. Most of its territory was included in the Vojvodina, one of the two autonomous provinces of Serbia within the new SFR Yugoslavia. Following WWII, most ethnic Germans were expelled from Banat and eastern Europe. Those Germans who remained in the country were sent to prison camps run by the new communist authorities. After prison camps were dissolved (in 1948), most of the remaining German population left Serbia because of economic reasons. Many went to Germany; others emigrated to western Europe and the United States.

Since 1944–1945, the Serbian Banat (together with Bačka and Syrmia), has been part of the Serbian Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, first as part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and then as part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro. Since 2006, it has been part of an independent Serbia.

=== Hungarian Banat since the First World War ===
The Hungarian Banat consists of a small northern part of the region, which is part of the Csongrád-Csanád County of Hungary and is made up of seven villages and the district of Szeged, Újszeged. The Hungarian part of Banat used to be the northernmost region of the Torontál County in the Kingdom of Hungary.

== Administrative organization ==
In Romania, Banat includes all of Timiș and Caraș-Severin counties (with the exception of Băuțar), Arad County (only the part south of the Mureș), the Mehedinți panhandle (several localities from the traditional Banat area disappeared under the waters of the Porțile de Fier reservoir) and Hunedoara County (only the villages of Pojoga and Sălciva).

The Serbian Banat includes the part located east of the Tisza in Vojvodina: North Banat District, Central Banat District and South Banat District, as well as a part of Central Serbia (the area called &quot;Pančevački Rit&quot;, forming the left part of the Danube in the municipality of Palilula, included in the Belgrade metropolitan area).

In Hungary, there is only a small part of Csongrád-Csanád County, namely the part located in the southern angle formed by the Tisza and Mureș rivers, up to the state border with Romania and Serbia.
=== Largest cities ===
The following table lists the cities in Banat with a population greater than 10,000 (2022). Some cities that are not historically part of Banat expanded into this region during the 20th century, so that today some districts lie in the historical Banat: Arad (Aradu Nou), Belgrade (Palilula) and Szeged (Újszeged).

== Demographics ==

=== Romanian Banat ===
Romanians form a majority in the south, center and east of Banat. Their share increased, after 1930, also in the Timiș Plain (where they were a minority) through immigration from Transylvania, Moldavia and Oltenia. In some settlements the majority is made up of other peoples: Serbs make up the absolute majority in Pojejena (Пожежена) and Svinița (Свињица), and the relative majority in Socol (Соколовац); Croats (Krašovani) make up the majority in Carașova (&quot;Karaševo&quot;) and Lupac (&quot;Lupak&quot;); Bulgarians make up the majority in Dudeștii Vechi (&quot;Stár Bišnov&quot;); while Ukrainians make up the majority in Știuca (Щука) and Copăcele (Копашиль).

=== Serbian Banat ===
In most cities and municipalities of the Serbian Banat, the majority population is Serbian. Hungarians make up the majority of the population in Čoka (&quot;Csóka&quot;), and Slovaks make up the relative majority in the ethnically mixed municipality of Kovačica. Romanians make up the majority in certain settlements, and Czechs in Češko Selo.
=== Hungarian Banat ===
In the Hungarian part of Banat, the majority population is Hungarian, but in some villages in the region (Deszk/Деска, Szőreg/Сириг, Újszentiván/Нови Сентиван) there is also a Serbian minority.

== Symbols ==
The traditional heraldic symbol of Banat is a lion, which is nowadays present in both the coat of arms of Romania and the coat of arms of Vojvodina. It is assumed that the Banat lion has its origin in the Cuman lion.

The current coat of arms of the Romanian Banat was designed in 1921, after the union of the Banat with the Kingdom of Romania, by the heraldist by combining some elements from the coats of arms of Temes and Krassó counties from 1779 to represent the &quot;Romanian Banat of Severin&quot;. It consists of a red shield in which is represented a golden lion rampant emerging from a golden bridge with two arched openings, built of carved stone, over an azure river. According to its author, &quot;the lion is the old (Cuman) element, the bridge is the new element, Trajan&#x27;s Bridge over the Danube&quot;. The coat of arms from 1921 was modified in 1992 by adding a sabre in the right paw, recalling the backsword of Pál Kinizsi, count of Temes.

Serbs use the seal of the Velika Kikinda District of 1774 to represent Banat. It also features a golden lion rampant with a sabre in the right paw and a severed Turkish head in the left one.

<text>Haribo GmbH &amp; Co. KG, doing business as Haribo ( , ; stylized in all caps), is a German confectionery company founded by Hans Riegel Sr. It began in Kessenich, Bonn, Germany. The name &quot;Haribo&quot; is a syllabic abbreviation formed from Hans Riegel Bonn. The company created the first gummy candy in 1922 in the form of little gummy bears called &quot;Gummibärchen&quot;. The current headquarters are in Grafschaft, Germany.

==History==

On 13 December 1920, the company was registered in the commercial register by its founder Johannes Riegel. In 1921, his wife Gertrud Riegel was the company&#x27;s first employee. According to the company, Riegel&#x27;s seed capital was a sack of sugar, a copper pot, a marble slab, a stool, a stonewalled stove and a roller. In the same year, he bought a house that was located in the &quot;Kessenich&quot; district of Bonn, on a street called &quot;Bergstraße&quot;. The house was Haribo&#x27;s first production facility. 

Two years after the company&#x27;s founding, Hans Riegel invented the precursor of the Goldbear, which was still called &quot;Tanzbär&quot; (Dancing Bear) at that time. However, it was not only bigger than the present gummy bears, but also softer, due to the use of gum arabic instead of the now common gelatine.

In 1925, Haribo began producing licorice products. The sales organization in Germany and the main building of the new production facility were established at the beginning of the 1930s.

According to the company, production fell immensely during the Second World War, partly due to a shortage of raw materials. In 2000, Haribo was suspected of having employed forced labourers during this war. However, the manufacturer denied this and consequently refused to pay into the forced labour fund.

After Johann Riegel&#x27;s early death in March 1945, the company was initially continued by his wife. After sons Hans and Paul returned from captivity in 1946, they took over its management.

Hans Riegel Junior represented the company externally, while Paul Riegel headed research and product development and hardly ever appeared in public. In 1957, Haribo took over the Godesberg company Kleutgen &amp; Meier, where Hans Riegel Senior had had his first job. In 1961, Haribo took over Bonera Industrie en Handelsmaatschappij NV in Breda and continued to run it as Haribo Nederland BV. In the 1960s, a new headquarters building opened in Bonn.

In 1967, Haribo acquired shares in the French confectionery factory Lorette, in Marseille, which was renamed Haribo-France SA. In 1987 it merged with the southern French manufacturer Ricqles Zan to form Haribo Ricqles-Zan with production facilities in Marseille, Uzès and Wattrelos. The company&#x27;s only small factory museum is also located at the Uzès site.

In 1968, Haribo bought shares in the Solingen company Dr. Hillers, eventually taking it over completely in 1979. From 1980 onwards, a new production facility was built at the site in three expansion phases. In October 2011, the Solingen location was expanded to include a high-bay warehouse, an office building and a goods handling hall.

Haribo has since expanded its operations, taking over many local confectionery manufacturers around the world. It began international expansion in the 1960s and entered American markets in the 1980s. 
In 1986, the company bought the production and rights to the Maoam candy and Haribo Chamallows (formerly “Dulcia”). As of 2013, it operated 16 factories which produce over 100 million gummy bears per day.

The company headquarters remained in the Kessenich district of Bonn until, in May 2018, it was relocated to the municipality of Grafschaft in Rhineland-Palatinate. Bonn continues to be a production location.

In October 2003, Hans Riegel Junior announced that one of his nephews, Hans-Jürgen Riegel (* 1956), would be his successor. He managed the company in France until 2005, but then fell out with his uncle and left the company. Co-owner Paul Riegel died unexpectedly on the night of 3 August 2009.

After the relationship with his nephew broke down, Hans Riegel decided to leave the question of succession open. This led to a conflict between the Haribo family tribes, as Paul Riegel&#x27;s sons pursued a complaint to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry that had been initiated by their father in the summer of 2008 to clarify the legal issues. After their temporary suspension, an overall amicable solution was finally developed and presented in 2010.

Haribo-Holding GmbH &amp; Co. KG was then re-established. The Paul Riegel Family Holding and the Hans Riegel Holding, which were newly founded for this occasion, each have a half stake. At the same time, two intermediate holding companies were created below the new parent company to bundle the German business on the one hand and the international business on the other. Hans-Guido (* ~1966), Paul Riegel&#x27;s son from his first marriage, became, like his father, managing director for production and technology alongside his uncle Hans, who continued to look after marketing and sales. Hans-Arndt (* ~1968), Paul Riegel&#x27;s son from his second marriage, took over the chairmanship of a new four-member supervisory board. Long-time employee Andreas Nickenig (* ~1968), who was considered Hans Riegel&#x27;s foster son and got along well with Paul&#x27;s sons of the same age, also had a strong role in managing the foreign business.

Hans Riegel died during recovery following the removal of a brain tumour on 15 October 2013. His position was filled by the Hans Riegel Foundation, which was created in 1987 and is now headed by Reinhard Schneider, authorized representative and also a long-time employee of Hans Riegel.

== Present ==

Haribo production is made up of around 7,000 employees in four plants in Germany and ten more in other European countries. As of June 2003, Haribo products were distributed in more than a hundred countries. In 2008, the Federal Cartel Office initiated proceedings against the company and other confectionery manufacturers for illegal price fixing. In 2012, the Federal Cartel Office imposed a fine of a total of 2.4 million euros on Haribo and a responsible sales employee. The reason was anti-competitive agreements with competing companies in which negotiations with retailers were exchanged. 

=== Relocation of the company headquarters ===
Since 2005, there has been public speculation about the company&#x27;s plans to relocate the Bonn location with its 1,300 employees because expansion are no longer possible there. The Rhineland-Palatinate town of Gelsdorf (community of Grafschaft) and its North Rhine-Westphalian neighboring town of Rheinbach were discussed as new locations.

In April 2018, the company moved its head office from Bonn to Grafschaft. Some factory capacity remained in Bonn.
== Goldbears ==
Goldbears are fruit gums in the shape of stylized bears, that are two centimeters in size and consist of sugar, sugar syrup, colorants and flavorings. They also contain acidifiers, coating agents, water and a gelatin mixture, which gives the bears their rubbery consistency. Since 1960, Haribo calls its gummy bears Goldbears, in order to distinguish them from other manufacturers&#x27; products. In 2005, Haribo produced about 100 million Goldbears daily in 15 establishments throughout Europe to ensure the distribution in over 100 countries. The Goldbears account for Haribo&#x27;s largest revenue share. According to the company, their brand awareness in Germany is 99 percent and the Goldbear stands for &quot;childlike happiness&quot;.

For the German market, they are colored with natural fruit extracts, in contrast to the use of colorants in the past. Although there are enough possibilities today to create a shade of blue, making the production of blue Goldbears possible, the Haribo management does not want to make any changes to the traditional product.

In August 2007, the product range was partly changed by adding apple as a new flavor and giving it the color green. The strawberry flavor, which was hitherto assigned to the color green, was recolored to light red. Additionally, the shape of the Goldbears was slightly changed, compared to the former generations, by giving them a smiling face.

Devoted to the UEFA Euro in 2008, Haribo produced &quot;Schwarz-Rot-Goldbären:&quot; a black, red and yellow Goldbear mix. The mix, which was inspired by the color combination of the German flag, contained the flavors blackcurrant (black), raspberry (red) and lemon (yellow). For the first time ever, Haribo developed black Goldbears, which, besides blackcurrant, also contained elder extract.

On the occasion of the FIFA World Cup in 2014, Haribo produced the &quot;Goldbären-Fan-Edition&quot;. This mix included gummi bears in cherry (dark red), grapefruit (red), watermelon (green), woodruff (dark green) and apricot (orange) flavor as well as blue Goldbears in blueberry flavor. A zero sugar version of the gummy bears was discontinued because people got diarrhea because of maltitol in the candy. 

There is a halal version of Haribo Goldbears in various countries (including the United Kingdom) which is imported from Turkey, where it is manufactured using beef gelatin which is permissible if slaughtered accordingly to Islamic dietary laws which uses the dhabihah method. They have the halal certification on the packaging.

==UK presence==
Haribo entered the UK sweets market by buying Dunhill&#x27;s in 1972, a manufacturer of liquorice Pontefract cakes which was founded in the 18th century.

Haribo&#x27;s key brands in the UK are Starmix, Tangfastics, Supermix and Maoam, with Maoam being a brand of chewy sweets being bought in 1986 from Edmund Münster, the manufacturer who originally owned Maoam when it was first launched in Germany back in 1931. They were once the distributor of Pez products in the United Kingdom, but this is no longer the case. Haribo makes Pontefract Cakes at their factory in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, and other locations. The company owns seven shops in the UK located in Pontefract, the West Midlands, York, Cheshire, East Midlands, Somerset, Kent and Hampshire.

==US presence==
Haribo had been imported into the United States since 1982. In Germany, Haribo was not an exclusive gourmet product, but a mere candy. When Haribo of America was incorporated in the 1980s in Baltimore, Maryland, Haribo&#x27;s gummi candies were introduced to the US mass market through retailers such as drugstores, grocery stores and discount stores. The packaging was translated into English, and package weights were adjusted to match US candy prices and package sizes. A laydown bag was developed for the US supermarket trade, instead of the hanging bag commonly found in German supermarkets, and a boxed product was developed for theaters.

Sales soared the first year, and gummi bears became so popular in the US that the US market was soon flooded with competitors such as German Trolli and American Black Forest.

In 2015, Haribo of America moved to the Chicago, Illinois area and established their headquarters in Rosemont, Illinois. On 23 March 2017, Haribo announced the opening of its first US factory, a 500,000-sq-ft (46,500 m2), 400-employee manufacturing plant in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, which started construction in 2020 Gilbane Building Company.

In 2023, the US factory went live and began producing Goldbears. Haribo factories do not give tours.

==International distribution==

Haribo plans to expand to China and Brazil. In China, it has launched test stores in Shanghai and in Guangdong province. New production facilities opened in Castleford, West Yorkshire, in 2016, and it plans to open in São Paulo, Brazil.

==Slogans==
Haribo&#x27;s German catchphrase is &quot;Haribo macht Kinder froh – und Erwachsene ebenso&quot; (&quot;Haribo makes children happy – and adults as well&quot;). The German advertisements starred Thomas Gottschalk from 1991 until 2015. In English-speaking countries, it uses the slogan &quot;Kids and grown-ups love it so – the happy world of Haribo&quot;. In Hungary, it uses the slogan &quot;Gyermek, felnőtt kedve jó – édes élet, Haribo&quot; (&quot;Child and adult is happy – sweet life, Haribo&quot;). &quot;Haribo c&#x27;est beau la vie, pour les grands et les petits&quot; (&quot;Haribo life is beautiful, for big ones and little ones&quot;) is used in France, while in Italy the song used during commercials is: &quot;Haribo è la bontà, che si gusta ad ogni età&quot; (&quot;Haribo is the delicacy that one can taste at any age&quot;). 

In Turkey, it uses the slogan &quot;Çocuk ya da büyük ol, Haribo&#x27;yla mutlu ol&quot; (&quot;Be a kid or a grown up, be happy with Haribo&quot;). In Denmark, it uses the slogan &quot;&quot;Luk op for noget godt! Luk op for Haribo! Den er go&quot;&#x27;&quot; (&quot;Open for something good! Open for Haribo! It is good&quot;). In Spain &quot;Vive un sabor mágico, ven al mundo Haribo&quot; (&quot;Experience a magical flavour, come to Haribo&#x27;s world&quot;) slogan is used. Similar slogans are used in other languages. The Haribo jingle music was created by UK composer Stephen Lee Vickers.

<text>Carlsten () is a stone fortress located at Marstrand, on the western coast of Sweden. The fortress was built on the orders of King Carl X of Sweden following the Treaty of Roskilde, 1658 to protect the newly acquired province of Bohuslän from hostile attacks. The site of Marstrand was chosen because of its location and its access to an ice free port. The fortress was decommissioned as a permanent defense installation in 1882, but remained in military use until the early 1990s.
== History ==

After peace in Roskilde in 1658, Bohuslän and thus Marstrand became Swedish. The city has long been a major trading place. Since the harbor almost never freezes, part of the Swedish Navy was stationed here. To defend Marstrand, Karl X Gustav decided to build a fortress on the island. 
On July 23, 1677, after an attack on the fortifications in Marstrand, Carlsten was conquered by Ulrik Frederik Gyldenløve, the Danish military commander in Norway.
In 1719, the fortress was attacked and besieged for a second time in its history by the Norwegian Vice-Admiral Tordenskjold, falling into enemy hands. The fortress was returned to Swedish control through negotiations and treaties.

== Construction ==

In 1658, under the leadership of Johan Wärnschöld, a makeshift fortification was built in the form of a wooden &quot; Wahlen skans&quot;, at the top of the mountain above the city&#x27;s &quot;big weather mill&quot;. This fortification was of great use in the fall of 1659 to fight back the attack carried out by Norwegian forces. In 1666, the construction of a replacement building for the wooden edging, which &quot;struck&quot;, began. This new fortress was in the form of a Roman redoubt, or tower building with four small ravelins. In 1671–73, the tower, which was then called &quot;Karlsten&quot;, was built on one floor and was equipped with a roof battery. 
Initially a square stone tower was constructed, but in 1681, the construction of a large round shaped tower began, following the commander Carl Gustaf Frölich&#x27;s design, but otherwise new construction, on drawings created by Erik Dahlbergh, was approved in general in 1685, and as early as 1689 the fortress itself was almost completed, consisting then of a brick redoubt and a high multi-storey tower, which included the former square.

The work was carried out by prisoners sentenced to penal labour. 
Successive additions to the fortress were carried out until 1860 when it was finally completed. Carlsten was exclusively a prison for men. Nonetheless, Metta Fock, a female prisoner, was to have been kept there 1806-1809. The most famous prisoner of Carlsten was arguably Lasse-Maja, who was imprisoned here in 1813-1838.

<text>Antsiranana ( ), named Diego-Suarez prior to 1975, is a city in the far north of Madagascar. Antsiranana is the capital of Diana Region. It had an estimated population of 115,015 in 2013.

==History==
At the beginning of the 16th century, a Portuguese squadron of 13 ships crisscrossed the Indian Ocean; One of these ships went adrift, and its captain, Diego Diaz, was therefore the first European to discover the Big Island on August 10, 1500.
In February 1506, Admiral Herman Suarez recognized the place and so Antomabokala, former capital of Ankarana, acquired its name of Diego Suarez, which comes from the contraction of the first name of the captain and the name of the Admiral. In 1635, the bay was mentioned for the first time under this name by the French pilot Berthelot, author of an oriental map of Africa and Madagascar.
In 1824, the bay was explored by the English hydrographer Owen, then in 1833, Captain Bigeault, commandant of La Nièvre, traveled the North East coast to carry out hydrographic surveys.

In the 1880s, the bay was coveted by France, which desired it as a coaling station for steamships. After the first Franco-Hova War, Queen Ranavalona III signed a treaty on December 17, 1885, granting France a protectorate over the bay and surrounding territory, as well as the islands of Nosy-Be and Ste. Marie de Madagascar.

The French took possession of their new colony and the Bay of Diego Suarez (also called &quot;Bay of Antomboko&quot; at that time). It was then called &quot;Etablissement français de Diego-Suarez&quot; (French Establishment of Diego-Suarez) and was placed under the command of Frigate captain Caillet who is the founder of the city of Diego Suarez.

The first barracks were built at Cap Diego. The first habitants of the new colony were Creoles from Réunion &amp; Mauritius, as well as from the French possession of Toamasina, Nosy Be, Ile Sainte-Marie, Mayotte and Mahajanga. 

Run away slaves (Makoas), Antankarana and Sakalava made up another big part of the population. In 1886, the colony had a population of 2500 habitants.
In 1887, a civil governor, Froger, replaced Caillet. In 1888, the islands of Nosy Be and Ile Sainte-Marie were attached to the colony.

In 1900, the Decauville railway at Diégo Suarez was built.
The Second Pacific Squadron of Imperial Russia anchored and was resupplied at Diego-Suarez on its way to the Battle of Tsushima in 1905.

On 21 March 1909, the first bricks of the cathedral were laid down.
In 1919 there was an epidemics of the Spanish flu followed by an outbreak of the plague in 1920. Still, in 1925 the Province de Diego-Suarez had 13695 habitants.

In 1942, Diego-Suarez was the primary objective of Operation Ironclad, the starting point of the Allied invasion and capture of Madagascar. The Allies were concerned that Japan would pressure Vichy France into granting use of Madagascar, as they had with French Indo-China during the previous year, and determined that the island should not be made a base for the interception of Allied shipping. Diego-Suarez, with its superb harbour and a concentration of government officials, was selected as the initial invasion point. The Japanese responded with an attack by midget submarines on the British naval forces in the harbour, damaging the battleship and sinking the oil tanker &quot;British Loyalty&quot;.

France continued to operate a military base in the city following Malagasy independence in 1960. Between 1973 and 1975, French forces were withdrawn.

==Postage stamps==
== Education ==

The University of Antsiranana was founded in 1976.

Lycée Français Diego Suarez, or Lycée Français Sadi-Carnot, is a French international school in Antsiranana. Historically it was the Collège français Sadi Carnot.

==Transport==

Antsiranana is situated on Antsiranana Bay, one of the largest deep-water harbours in the Indian Ocean, but the remote location, and, until recently, a bad road to the south, rendered it unimportant for freight traffic. There is a cruise port with periodic visits.

Arrachart Airport provides communication primarily with other parts of Madagascar.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
Antsiranana has a tropical savannah climate (Aw) with long, hot summer-like weather that lasts year round cut into two seasons; a wet season which lasts from December to March and a dry season which lasts the rest of the year with rainfall being uncommon but not impossible.
== Places of worship == 

Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples: 

* FJKM - Fiangonan&#x27;i Jesoa Kristy eto Madagasikara (Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar)
* FLM - Fiangonana Loterana Malagasy (Malagasy Lutheran Church)
* Assemblies of God 
* Fiangonara Batista Biblika (Baptiste church)
* Roman Catholic Diocese of Antsiranana (Catholic Church seated in the Cathedral of St. Matthew). 
* Church of the Province of the Indian Ocean (Anglican Church)

<doc id="271390" wikidata="Q667761" url="?curid=271390" title="GEDCOM">
<text>FamilySearch GEDCOM, or simply GEDCOM ( , acronym of &quot;Genealogical Data Communication&quot;), is an open file format and the de facto standard specification for storing genealogical data. It was developed by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS, also known as the Mormon Church), the operators of FamilySearch, to aid in the research and sharing of genealogical information. A common usage is as a standard format for the backup and transfer of family tree data between different genealogy software and websites, most of which support importing from and exporting to GEDCOM format.

GEDCOM is defined as a plain text file, using UTF-8 encoding as of version 7.0. This file contains genealogical information about individuals such as names, events, and relationships; metadata links these records together.

GEDCOM 7.0, released in 2021, is the most recent version of the GEDCOM specification . However, its predecessor, GEDCOM 5.5.1, remains the industry&#x27;s format standard for the exchange of genealogical data. First released as a draft standard in 1999, GEDCOM 5.5.1 received only minor updates in the subsequent 20 years leading up to the release of 5.5.1 final in 2019. To address its shortcomings, some genealogy programs introduced proprietary extensions to GEDCOM which are not always recognized by other programs, such as GEDCOM 5.5 EL (Extended Locations). Efforts have been made to have 7.0 more widely adopted since its release. FamilySearch intends to be GEDCOM 7.0 compatible in the third quarter 2022 and Ancestry.com is planning for 7.0 compatibility, but has not yet specified an implementation date.

==Data model==
GEDCOM uses a lineage-linked data model based on the conceptual model of the nuclear family. The family (codice_1) record type is therefore the only source of links between the individuals (codice_2) in the file, assigning parents (as codice_3 and codice_4) and children (as codice_5) by referring to individuals&#x27; unique ID numbers. These historical origins are described in the 7.0 specification document: &quot;The codice_1 record was originally structured to represent families where a male codice_3 (husband or father) and female codice_4 (wife or mother) produce codice_5 (children).&quot;

Although the links in a GEDCOM family record still use the original naming indicating a husband and a wife, the specification now states that &quot;sex, gender, titles, and roles of partners should not be inferred based on the partner that the codice_3 or codice_4 structure points to&quot; and that these individuals within a family structure are collectively referred to as &#x27;partners&#x27;, &#x27;parents&#x27; or &#x27;spouses&#x27;. A codice_1 record can also be used for &quot;cohabitation, fostering, adoption, and so on, regardless of the gender of the partners.&quot;

==File structure==
A GEDCOM file consists of a header section, records, and a trailer section. Within these sections, records represent people (INDI record), families (FAM records), sources of information (SOUR records), and other miscellaneous records, including notes. Every line of a GEDCOM file begins with a level number where all top-level records (HEAD, TRLR, SUBN, and each INDI, FAM, OBJE, NOTE, REPO, SOUR, and SUBM) begin with a line with level 0, while other level numbers are positive integers.

Although it is possible to write a GEDCOM file by hand, the format was designed to be used with software and thus is not especially human-friendly. A GEDCOM validator that can be used to validate the structure of a GEDCOM file is included as part of PhpGedView project, though it is not meant to be a standalone validator. For standalone validation &quot;The Windows GEDCOM Validator&quot; can be used. or the older unmaintained Gedcheck from the LDS Church.

During 2001, &quot;The GEDCOM TestBook Project&quot; evaluated how well four popular genealogy programs conformed to the GEDCOM 5.5 standard using the Gedcheck program. Findings showed that a number of problems existed and that &quot;The most commonly found fault leading to data loss was the failure to read the NOTE tag at all the possible levels at which it may appear.&quot; In 2005, the &quot;Genealogical Software Report Card&quot; was evaluated (by Bill Mumford who participated in the original &quot;GEDCOM Testbook Project&quot;) and included testing the GEDCOM 5.5 standard using the Gedcheck program.

To assist with adoption of GEDCOM 7.0, validation tools now exist for that standard as well.

===Example===
The following is a sample GEDCOM file.
The header (HEAD) includes the source program and version (Personal Ancestral File, 5.0), the GEDCOM version (5.5), the character encoding (ANSEL), and a link to information about the submitter of the file.

The individual records (INDI) define John Smith (ID I1), Elizabeth Stansfield (ID I2), and James Smith (ID I3).

The family record (FAM) links the husband (HUSB), wife (WIFE), and child (CHIL) by their ID numbers.

==Versions==
The current version of the specification in wide use is GEDCOM &quot;5.5.1 final&quot;, which was released on 15 November 2019. Its predecessor, GEDCOM &quot;5.5.1 draft&quot; was issued in 1999, introducing nine new attribute, tags and adding UTF-8 as an approved character encoding. The draft was not formally approved, but its provisions were adopted in some part by a number of genealogy programs including FamilySearch.org.

Lineage-linked GEDCOM is the deliberate de facto common denominator. Despite version 5.5 of the GEDCOM standard first being published in 1996, many genealogical software suppliers have never fully supported the feature of multilingual Unicode text (instead of the ANSEL character set) introduced with that version of the specification. Uniform use of Unicode would allow for the usage of international character sets. An example is the storage of East Asian names in their original Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) characters, without which they could be ambiguous and of little use for genealogical or historical research. PAF 5.2 is an example of software that uses UTF-8 as its internal character set, and can output a UTF-8 GEDCOM.

GEDCOM 7.0 &quot;requires&quot; UTF-8 encoding throughout, and resolves other long-standing issues with GEDCOM 5.5.1. Multimedia support in the form of an associated .zip file, called a GEDZip, is another inclusion. Efforts are underway to see 7.0 embraced as the new exchange standard. GEDCOM 7.0 allows explicitly identifying what standards other than GEDCOM may apply to a particular file. GEDCOM has always been extensible, but prior to 7.0 there was no standard way to identify such extensions. Also, GEDCOM 7.0 allows explicitly marking an event as nonexistent. This allows, for example, documenting that a particular individual never married. GEDCOM 7.0 was the first version to use semantic versioning, and is the most recent minor version of the specification.

, the next planned minor release is v7.1, which is under development.

===Release history===

==Limitations==

===Support for multi-person events and sources===
A GEDCOM file can contain information on events such as births, deaths, census records, ship&#x27;s records, marriages, etc.; a rule of thumb is that an event is something that took place at a specific time, at a specific place (even if time and place are not known). GEDCOM files can also contain attributes such as physical description, occupation, and total number of children; unlike events, attributes generally cannot be associated with a specific time or place.

The GEDCOM specification requires that each event or attribute is associated with exactly one individual or family. This causes redundancy for events such as census records where the actual census entry often contains information on multiple individuals. In the GEDCOM file, for census records a separate census &quot;CENS&quot; event must be added for each individual referenced. Some genealogy programs, such as Gramps and The Master Genealogist, have elaborate database structures for sources that are used, among other things, to represent multi-person events. When databases are exported from one of these programs to GEDCOM, these database structures cannot be represented in GEDCOM due to this limitation, with the result that the event or source information including all of the relevant citation reference information must be duplicated each place that it is used. This duplication makes it difficult for the user to maintain the information related to sources.

In the GEDCOM specification, events that are associated with a family such as marriage information is only stored in a GEDCOM once, as part of the family (FAM) record, and then both spouses are linked to that single family record.

===Ambiguity in the specification===
The GEDCOM specification was made purposefully flexible to support many ways of encoding data, particularly in the area of sources. This flexibility has led to a great deal of ambiguity, and has produced the side effect that some genealogy programs which import GEDCOM do not import all of the data from a file.

===Ordering of events that do not have dates===
The GEDCOM specification does not offer explicit support for keeping a known order of events. In particular, the order of relationships (FAMS) for a person and the order of the children within a relationship (FAM) can be lost. In many cases the sequence of events can be derived from the associated dates. But dates are not always known, in particular when dealing with data from centuries ago. For example, in the case that a person has had two relationships, both with unknown dates, but from descriptions it is known that the second one is indeed the second one. The order in which these FAMS are recorded in GEDCOM&#x27;s INDI record will depend on the exporting program. In Aldfaer for instance, the sequence depends on the ordering of the data by the user (alphabetical, chronological, reference, etc.). The proposed XML GEDCOM standard does not address this issue either.

==Lesser-known features==
GEDCOM has many features that are not commonly used. Some software packages do not support all the features that the GEDCOM standard allows.

===Multimedia===
The GEDCOM standard supports the inclusion of multimedia objects (for example, photos of individuals). Such multimedia objects can be either included in the GEDCOM file itself (called the &quot;embedded form&quot;) or in an external file where the name of the external file is specified in the GEDCOM file (called the &quot;linked form&quot;). Embedding multimedia directly in the GEDCOM file makes transmission of data easier, in that all of the information (including the multimedia data) is in one file, but the resulting file can be enormous. Linking multimedia keeps the size of the GEDCOM file under control, but then when transmitting the file, the multimedia objects must either be transmitted separately or archived together with the GEDCOM into one larger file. Support for embedding media directly was dropped in the draft 5.5.1 standard.

===Conflicting information===
The GEDCOM standard allows for the specification of multiple opinions or conflicting data, simply by specifying multiple records of the same type. For example, if an individual&#x27;s birth date was recorded as 10 January 1800 on the birth certificate, but 11 January 1800 on the death certificate, two BIRT records for that individual would be included, the first with the 10 January 1800 date and giving the birth certificate as the source, and the second with the 11 January 1800 date and giving the death certificate as the source. The preferred record is usually listed first.

This example encoded in GEDCOM might look like this:
 0 @I1@ INDI
 1 NAME John /Doe/
 1 BIRT
 2 DATE 10 JAN 1800
 2 SOUR @S1@
 3 DATA
 4 TEXT Transcription from birth certificate would go here
 3 NOTE This birth record is preferred because it comes from the birth certificate
 3 QUAY 2
 1 BIRT
 2 DATE 11 JAN 1800
 2 SOUR @S2@
 3 DATA
 4 TEXT Transcription from death certificate would go here
 3 QUAY 2

Conflicting data may also be the result of user errors. The standard does not specify in any way that the &quot;contents&quot; must be consistent. A birth date like &quot;10 APR 1819&quot; might mistakenly have been recorded as &quot;10 APR 1918&quot; long after the person&#x27;s death. The only way to reveal such inconsistencies is by rigorous validation of the &quot;content data&quot;.

===Internationalization===
The GEDCOM standard supports internationalization in several ways. First, newer versions of the standard allow data to be stored in Unicode (or, more recently, UTF-8), so text in any language can be stored. Secondly, in the same way that one can have multiple events on a person, GEDCOM allows one to have multiple names for a person, so names can be stored in multiple languages, although there is no standardized way to indicate which instance is in which language. Finally, in version 5.5.1, the NAME field also supports a phonetic variation (FONE) and a romanized variation (ROMN) of the name.

==GEDCOM X==
In February 2012 at the RootsTech 2012 conference, FamilySearch outlined a major new project around genealogical standards called GEDCOM X, and invited collaboration. It includes software developed under the Apache open source license. It includes data formats that facilitate basing family trees on sources and records (both physical artifacts and digital artifacts), support for sharing and linking data online, and an API.

In August 2012 FamilySearch employee and GEDCOM X project leader Ryan Heaton dropped the claim that GEDCOM X is the new industry standard, and repositioned GEDCOM X as another FamilySearch open source project.

After the release of GEDCOM 7, FamilySearch positioned GEDCOM X as useful for interoperation with its FamilySearch Family Tree software.

==Alternatives==
Commsoft, the authors of the Roots series of genealogy software and Ultimate Family Tree, defined a version called Event-Oriented GEDCOM (also known as &quot;Event GEDCOM&quot; and originally called InterGED), which included events as first class (zero-level) items. Although it is event based, it is still a model built on assumed reality rather than evidence. Event GEDCOM was more flexible, as it allowed some separation between believed events and the participants. However, Event GEDCOM was not widely adopted by other developers due to its semantic differences. With Roots and Ultimate Family Tree no longer available, very few people today are using Event GEDCOM.

Gramps XML is an XML-based open format created by the open source genealogy project Gramps and used also by PhpGedView.

The Family History Information Standards Organisation was established in 2012 with the aim of developing international standards for family history and genealogical information. One of the standards the organization proposed was Extended Legacy Format (ELF), compatible with GEDCOM 5.5(.1), but including an extensibility mechanism. The organization requested public comment on the proposed standard in 2017. It withdrew the proposal because release 7.0 of GEDCOM addressed many of the organization&#x27;s concerns.

<doc id="271396" wikidata="Q1361854" url="?curid=271396" title="Pennyweight">
<text>A pennyweight (dwt) is a unit of mass equal to 24 grains, of a troy ounce, of a troy pound, 
 avoirdupois ounce and exactly 1.55517384 grams. It is abbreviated dwt, &quot;d&quot; standing for &quot;denarius&quot; (an ancient Roman coin), and later used as the symbol of an old British penny (see £sd).

==History==
In the Middle Ages, an English penny&#x27;s weight was literally, as well as monetarily, of an ounce and of a pound of sterling silver. At that time, the pound unit in use in England was the Tower pound, equal to 7,680 Tower grains (also known as wheat grains). The medieval English pennyweight was thus equal to 32 Tower grains. When Troy weights replaced Tower weights in 1527, the Troy weights were defined in such a way that the old Tower pound came out to exactly 5,400 Troy grains (also known as barleycorns), the Tower pennyweight Troy grains (and thus approximately 1.46 grams). After 1527, the English pennyweight was the Troy pennyweight. of 24 Troy grains. Thus the Troy pound, ounce, and pennyweight, with their definitions given in terms of the Troy grain instead of in terms of the Tower grain, were or 6.667% more than the Tower equivalents.

==Usage==
The troy pound and the pennyweight lost their official status in the United Kingdom in the Weights and Measures Act of 1878; only the troy ounce and its decimal subdivisions remained official. The troy ounce enjoys a specific legal exemption from metrication in the UK.

The pennyweight is the common weight used in the valuation and measurement of precious metals. Jewellers use the pennyweight in calculating the amount and cost of precious metals used in fabricating or casting jewellery. Similarly, dentists and dental labs still use the pennyweight as the measure of precious metals in dental crowns and inlays.

Pennyweight and grains are still used to weigh gooseberries in competitions in Cheshire, northwest UK. Over the Pennines in Yorkshire the alternative drams and grains measurement has been used since a new set of scales was purchased by the Egton Bridge Old Gooseberry Society in 1937. As of 2018, the world record for the heaviest gooseberry of () was held by Kelvin Archer of Cheshire.

The most common abbreviation for pennyweight is &quot;dwt&quot;; &quot;d&quot;, for the Roman &quot;denarius&quot;, was the abbreviation for &quot;penny&quot; before Decimalisation of the British monetary system. Alternate abbreviations are &quot;pwt&quot; and &quot;PW&quot;.

==Uses unrelated to weight==

Although the abbreviations are the same, the pennyweight bears no relation to the weight of the American penny nail. That name is derived from the price for a hundred nails in 15th century England: the larger the nail, the higher the cost per hundred.
The pennyweight also bears no relation to the weight of the American &quot;penny&quot; (1 cent) coin, which weighs 2.5 g (for those minted after 1982).

<doc id="271406" wikidata="Q420303" url="?curid=271406" title="Montrose, Angus">
<text>Montrose ( ; ) is a town and former royal burgh in Angus, Scotland. Situated north of Dundee and south of Aberdeen, Montrose lies between the mouths of the North and South Esk rivers. It is the northernmost coastal town in Angus and developed as a natural harbour that traded in skins, hides, and cured salmon in medieval times.

With a population of approximately 12,000, the town functions as a port, but the major employer is GlaxoSmithKline, which was saved from closure in 2006. The skyline of Montrose is dominated by the steeple of Old and St Andrew&#x27;s Church, designed by James Gillespie Graham and built between 1832 and 1834.

Montrose is a town with a wealth of architecture, and is a centre for international trade. It is an important commercial port for the oil and gas industry. It is known for its wide thoroughfare and high street, which
leads to picturesque closes containing secluded gardens. The town has a view of a tidal lagoon, Montrose Basin, which is considered a nature reserve of international importance. It is the largest inland salt water basin in the UK, and an important habitat for the mute swan. Just outside Montrose is the 18th-century House of Dun, designed by the Scottish architect William Adam and built in 1730 for David Erskine, Lord Dun, 13th Laird of Dun.

==History==

===Toponymy and early history===

Prehistoric elements are found in the vicinity of Montrose, including the Stone of Morphie located to the north. One ancient name for Montrose was Celurca. The place-name is formed from the Scottish Gaelic &quot;Moine&quot; (meaning moor or peat moss) and Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory), perhaps ultimately of Pictish origin. The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by David I who founded the town around 1140 as &quot;Sallorch&quot; or &quot;Sallork&quot;. By 1178 the name had taken the form &quot;Munross&quot; before becoming &quot;Montrose&quot;. Folk etymology attributes the origin of the town&#x27;s name as &quot;Mount of Roses&quot;. This is reflected by the motto on the town&#x27;s seal: &quot;Mare ditat, rosa decorat&quot;. (English: &quot;The sea enriches, the rose adorns&quot;)

===Medieval history===
Montrose was visited and plundered in numerous instances by Danes. In the year 980 it was sacked and razed to the ground. It was once believed that a castle existed in Montrose in the 10th century and was destroyed by Kenneth III. However the historicity of this account has been disputed.

In the two proceeding centuries there are no precise dates in its history. During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as Forfar and Dundee were acquired by Malcolm IV and contributed to Restenneth Priory. In 1178 William the Lion built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside. The ruins have acquired the name Red Castle. The last record of a charter there was in 1198. A convent dedicated to the Virgin Mary is said to have been founded in 1230 by Alan Durward but the precise location is unknown. In 1244 the town succumbed to fire.

In July 1296 during the Wars of Independence, Edward I visited the town with 30,000 of his men and stayed at Munros castle for three nights. Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King John de Balliol by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in Brechin. Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I to protect themselves and the community of the town. The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison, was destroyed by William Wallace who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight. The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. David II visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371. The Dukedom of Montrose was created in 1488.

During the 15th century, the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that James IV of Scotland intervened and settled the matter.

===Modern history===

From its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the Hanseatic League. The town imported flax and timber from the Baltic; salt, fruit and wine from France and Portugal. The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of &quot;America Street&quot;, &quot;California Street&quot;, &quot;Baltic Street&quot; and &quot;India Street&quot; evidencing its trading heritage.

The site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. Graham signed the National Covenant against Charles I&#x27;s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops&#x27; Wars, but later switched to the King&#x27;s side only to be captured and executed in Edinburgh in the year 1650.

Between 1677 and the summer of 1678 a dyke which was begun across the Montrose Basin, designed to drain and reclaim the northern half, by Dronner, a Dutch engineer. It was destroyed shortly after in a storm. One of the most vocal objectors to the scheme was the elderly Meggie Cowie, who was said to have made blasphemous comments to those who were involved. She was tried, found guilty of witchcraft, and was burnt at the stake on 14 January 1679.
The final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) James Francis Edward Stuart (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.

During the 18th century the town was a major smuggling centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, &quot;gable-enders&quot;. A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194. Contemporaries expected that many would emigrate at the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War but those that did leave were few.
Samuel Johnson made a tour of the town on his visit to Scotland in the 1770s. He said of it:



Alexander Christie (c. 1721–1794) was provost in the town during the 1760s and 1780s and oversaw the establishment of Scotland&#x27;s first lunatic asylum in Montrose in 1781 which eventually became known as Sunnyside Royal Hospital. The asylum, initially called Montrose Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary and Dispensary was founded by Susan Carnegie of Charleton to treat both paupers and private patients and was originally situated on Montrose Links. It was granted a royal charter in 1810. In 1858 it moved to Sunnyside farm at the nearby village of Hillside. Its facilities were expanded several in the next few decades and it underwent various changes in name, finally becoming Sunnyside Royal Hospital in 1962. Sunnyside remained in use for the treatment of people with mental illnesses until its final closure in 2011 when many of its patients and functions moved to the Susan Carnegie Centre at Stracathro Hospital.

In 1785 a subscription library for learned men was formed.

Before World War I the Royal Flying Corps established a base at Montrose (later RAF Montrose). On 26 February 1913, it became the first operational military aerodrome to be established in the United Kingdom.

Between the wars, Montrose was a focus for key figures of the Scottish Renaissance. In 1920, a young Christopher Murray Grieve (later Hugh MacDiarmid) was employed as a reporter on the &quot;Montrose Review&quot;. By 1922 he had been elected as an Independent Labour Party councillor. The poet and novelist Violet Jacob was brought up at the nearby House of Dun and spent time in Angus during the &#x27;twenties. The sculptor William Lamb was born in Montrose and returned to the town in 1924.

Another native of Montrose, the writer Tom MacDonald (Fionn MacColla) returned to Montrose in 1929, as did his friend the painter Edward Baird. Willa and Edwin Muir lived at her mother&#x27;s house in Montrose at various times during the 1920s. The poet Helen Cruickshank attended Montrose Academy, though she had moved to Edinburgh by the 1920s. She was a key figure in maintaining the network of contacts between writers and artists of Scotland&#x27;s inter-war cultural renaissance.

During World War II Montrose became a hub for a constant stream of international pilots from all over the Commonwealth, Poland, Czechoslovakia, America, Russia, France and other allied nations. As well as a training base RAF Montrose was also an operational airfield for Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire squadrons, which flew sorties over Norway and were a part of the air defences for Edinburgh. Of course, this also made the town a target for German aircraft and it was bombed on more than one occasion. Despite its coastal location presenting a danger however, large numbers of children and young mothers from Dundee were evacuated there during the period of the Phoney War. Initially numbers totalled around 2,000 but in a second wave around 1,200 more were sent. As was the case in many other receiving areas, the local population was concerned by the condition of the urban poor and impetigo and vermin were found on some of those evacuated. By June 1940 Montrose could no longer provide shelter.

Montrose was a royal burgh until 1975.

===Bamse===
Bamse (meaning &#x27;teddybear&#x27; in Norwegian), a St Bernard dog famed for his exploits and popular in local imagination, is buried in the town. Bamse the Norwegian Sea Dog arrived in Montrose on the Royal Norwegian Navy minesweeper &quot;Thorodd&quot; during World War II with Captain Erling Hafto, his owner, who registered him as a crew member. He saved the life of Lieutenant Commander Olav Nilsen at Dundee Docks and generally protected his fellow sailors. In stories Bamse is said to have got up on his hind legs and, at over tall, clamped his great paws on assailants to end any fight. On his death in July 1944 Montrose schools were closed and 800 children lined the route to his graveside funeral.

The Bamse Project raised £50,000 to erect a larger than life-size bronze statue of Bamse at Montrose Harbour. Half the donations came from Norway. The statue was created by internationally known sculptor Alan Herriot, and was unveiled by The Duke of York in October 2007.

==Governance==

Montrose is represented within Angus Council by the Montrose &amp; District Ward, from which four councillors are elected. The members elected from this ward are, as of 2022: Bill Duff (Scottish National Party), Tommy Stewart (Independent), Kenny Braes (Scottish National Party) and Iain Gall (Conservative).

The town is part of the Angus and Perthshire Glens constituency of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which returns a Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons, at Westminster. The constituency&#x27;s MP is Dave Doogan of the SNP who has been the MP since 2019.

Montrose is also part of the Angus North and Mearns constituency of the Scottish Parliament that elects a single MSP and also part of the North East Scotland electoral region which elects seven additional Members of the Scottish Parliament. The constituency&#x27;s MSP is currently Mairi Gougeon of the Scottish National Party who was first elected in 2016 as Mairi Evans.

==Geography and natural features==
Montrose occupies a position on the North Bank of Montrose Basin at the mouth of the River South Esk on the East Coast of Scotland, NNE of Arbroath, SW of Stonehaven, and ESE of Brechin. The town lies NNE of Edinburgh, and NNW of London. The built-up area occupies a roughly rectangular shape long by wide, aligned in a north–south orientation. The land is relatively flat, rising gradually to around 15m elevation to the North of the town.

The expanse of the town extends to the villages on its fringes; Hillside and Ferryden. It lies close to the hamlets of Lunan and St Cyrus. The rural location ensures that the air quality is good, with low levels of nitrogen dioxide and PM10.

===Montrose Basin===

The Montrose Basin is a shallow estuary approximately three miles in diameter. It is situated where the River South Esk meets the North Sea. During the 16th century, local landowners desiring more arable land considered reducing its size, but their plans were never carried out.

In 1981 the Montrose Basin Nature Reserve was created. The Scottish Wildlife Trust operates a modern, purpose-built wildlife centre at Rossie Braes, which offers good telescopic and televisual views of the area, and of the thousands of migratory birds which pass through the area in all seasons.

In summer one might see the osprey which hunts along the length of the Basin, or a kingfisher flitting past. The artificial sand martin bank is a hive of activity all spring and early summer. One can watch the blue tits and barn swallows inside their nests, and take in the panoramic vista of the rolling Angus countryside and hills.

In October and November there are 38,000 birds using the basin. In winter, 20,000 pink-footed geese take up residence on the mudflats, feeding in the nearby fields by day, and returning to the safety of the Basin in the evening. The haunting fluting of their calls is beloved of local people, for whom the sound marks the turning of the seasons. The many feeders attract brightly coloured field and garden birds and the occasional woodpecker.

In recent years research published by Scottish Natural Heritage claimed that the population of greylag geese has fallen as a result of climate change.

===Montrose Beach===
The sandy beach has been awarded a Blue Flag for its eco credentials. The surrounding Traill Pavilion and Seafront Splash! facilities with an arcade, a playground, a café and an ice-cream stall is popular amongst locals and visitors alike. North of the town the River North Esk enters the North Sea across the beach.

The historically observed average rates of erosion of the beach is between per year, which has been linked to climate change.

The Save our Sands Campaign (SOS) was set up on 26 March 2009 to raise awareness amidst concerns over the erosion of Montrose beach, caused by the &quot;one million tonnes of sand, swept by the tide into the harbour...removed from the local area over the past 25 years&quot;. In 2006 150,000 tonnes was shipped to Aberdeen to fortify its dwindling beach. This was met with opposition from Montrose Golf Links who believed that the golf course built on top of the dunes, as one of the oldest in the world, should be protected. The sand dunes are becoming unstable due to increasing tides which has forced the Montrose Golf Links to consider moving elements of the golf course more inland. A major scheme of engineered coastal protection was discouraged by Scottish Natural Heritage on the grounds that it would be unsustainable and could impact a protected coastal site at St Cyrus.

A film made by local broadcaster Anthony Baxter in January 2009 highlighted the issue and was designed to attract attention for urgent action and put pressure on local politicians. The group are concerned that Angus Council are not acting efficiently to halt the effects of erosion and believe a full study should be carried out. The film won the best short film category in the BFFS Community Cinema Festival in 2009. Since 2009 a team from the University of Dundee has begun assessing the coastline around Montrose in a two-year study to decide the best way of managing coastal erosion. The film titled &quot;SOS Montrose Dredging&quot; has been posted on YouTube in 2009.

In November 2023, during Storm Babet, the beach eroded by three metres, leading to the promenade walkway collapsing.

==Demography==
The 2001 census gave Montrose&#x27;s total resident population as 10,845. This makes it the third largest town in Angus, after Arbroath (22,785) and Forfar (14,048) with Carnoustie in fourth place (10,561).

Since the Second World War the population of Montrose has increased. The presence of Dundee families in Montrose during wartime persuaded a number to settle there. This altered the demographics of the town and led to the building of housing estates in the 1960s. A number of people from the Polish community who had served with the British forces at RAF Montrose also settled.

The increase in the elderly population is reflected in the profusion of nursing and residential homes and in recent plans to extend provision for sheltered housing. Data published by Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics in 2008 records the population of Montrose &amp; District as 15,013, which is around 18% of the population of Angus as a whole. Of this total 17.6% are children, 60% are of working age and 22% are pensioners. Around 12% of those who live in the town are unemployed and 14.1% of households are ‘income deprived’.

==Education==

Schools include six primary schools - Lochside, Ferryden, Southesk, Rosemount, Borrowfield and St Margaret’s - and one secondary school, Montrose Academy.

==Economy==
The economy of the town has been expanding since the end of the Second World War. GlaxoSmithKline has been a major source of jobs since the 1950s. Other significant employers include Tesco, Cooperative Group, Petrofac, National Oilwell Varco, Baker Hughes and Argos. The Lochside Distillery, located on Brechin Road north of the town centre, was closed down in the 1990s and the buildings demolished in 2005 after a fire. In 2009 Sainsbury&#x27;s announced plans to build a new superstore on the edge of the town which was to provide work for an estimated 200 people. Construction of the new Sainsburys store was approved by Angus Council in August 2011 and spokespersons from Sainsburys believed at the time that the store would open in less than a year, unfortunately Sainsburys cancelled these plans and 4 commercial units were built on the site in 2018. BT initially upgraded the local telephone exchange to grant the town access to super fast fiberoptic broadband services one of only three towns to be chosen in Scotland. The average price of housing in the town is between £106,054 and £131,539, a rise on the 1998 average between £42,640 and £51,200.

===Tourism===
Since 2002 there has been a focus on attracting new visitors to the town with the foundation of the Montrose Town Partnership, the aim of which is to &quot;encourage representatives of the public, private and community sector to act together to develop the economic potential of Montrose to address the needs of local people and visitors alike&quot;. Membership includes The Montrose Society, Montrose Heritage Trust, Montrose Community Council, Montrose Golf Links Ltd, MERPRO Leisure, Montrose Business and Retailers Association, Scottish Wildlife Trust, Angus Council, Ferryden &amp; Craig and Hillside, Dun and Logie Pert community councils. Since 2002 they have produced a number of promotional leaflets and have established a weekly Saturday market in the town centre. In 2002 plans were unveiled to renovate the Mid Links. The project was completed in 2003 at the total cost of £1.8million with £1.2million granted by the Heritage Lottery Fund. Plaques have been incorporated to inform visitors of the historical heritage of the town&#x27;s buildings.
==Culture==
===Cultural history===

Montrose is regarded as the culture and sculpture capital of Angus, with over 20 statues of note scattered around the town. They are a mix of modern and classical works, with many by the local sculptor, William Lamb ARSA, an artist of exceptional talent. From the 1920s to 1940s local architect George Fairweather&#x27;s studio provided a forum for lively debate by an artistic community that included Hugh MacDiarmid, Edwin Muir, William Lamb, Helen Cruickshank and Fionn MacColla. The local weekly newspaper, the &quot;Montrose Review&quot;, was edited by MacDiarmid.

<text>Northern Cyprus, officially the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), is a &quot;de facto&quot; state that comprises the northeastern portion of the island of Cyprus. It is recognised only by Turkey, and its territory is considered by all other states to be part of the Republic of Cyprus. Northern Cyprus extends from the tip of the Karpass Peninsula in the northeast to Morphou Bay, Cape Kormakitis and its westernmost point, the Kokkina exclave in the west. Its southernmost point is the village of Louroujina. A buffer zone under the control of the United Nations stretches between Northern Cyprus and the rest of the island and divides Nicosia, the island&#x27;s largest city and capital of both sides.

A coup d&#x27;état in 1974, performed as part of an attempt to annex the island to Greece, prompted the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. This resulted in the eviction of much of the north&#x27;s Greek Cypriot population, the flight of Turkish Cypriots from the south, and the partitioning of the island, leading to a unilateral declaration of independence by the north in 1983. Due to its lack of recognition, Northern Cyprus is heavily dependent on Turkey for economic, political and military support.

Attempts to reach a solution to the Cyprus dispute have been unsuccessful. The Turkish Army maintains a large force in Northern Cyprus with the support and approval of the TRNC government, while the Republic of Cyprus, the European Union as a whole, and the international community regard it as an occupation force. This military presence has been denounced in several United Nations Security Council resolutions.

Northern Cyprus is a semi-presidential, democratic republic with a cultural heritage incorporating various influences and an economy that is dominated by the services sector. The economy has seen growth through the 2000s and 2010s, with the GNP per capita more than tripling in the 2000s, but is held back by an international embargo due to the official closure of the ports in Northern Cyprus by the Republic of Cyprus. The official language is Turkish, with a distinct local dialect being spoken. The vast majority of the population consists of Sunni Muslims, while religious attitudes are mostly moderate and secular. Northern Cyprus is an observer state of ECO and OIC under the name &quot;Turkish Cypriot State&quot;, PACE under the name &quot;Turkish Cypriot Community&quot;, and Organization of Turkic States with its own name.

==History==
===1960–1974===

A united Cyprus gained independence from British rule in August 1960, after both Greek and Turkish Cypriots agreed to abandon their respective plans for (union with Greece) and (Turkish for &quot;partition&quot;). The agreement involved Cyprus being governed under a constitution which apportioned cabinet posts, parliamentary seats and civil service jobs on an agreed ratio between the two communities. Within three years, tensions began to show between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots in administrative affairs. In particular, disputes over separate municipalities and taxation created a deadlock in government. In 1963 President Makarios proposed unilateral changes to the constitution, via 13 amendments. Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots rejected the proposed amendments, claiming that this was an attempt to settle constitutional disputes in favour of the Greek Cypriots and to demote Turkish status from co-founders of the state to one of minority status, removing their constitutional safeguards in the process. Turkish Cypriots filed a lawsuit against the 13 amendments in the Supreme Constitutional Court of Cyprus (SCCC). Makarios announced that he would not comply with the decision of the SCCC, whatever it was, and defended his amendments as being necessary &quot;to resolve constitutional deadlocks&quot; as opposed to the stance of the SCCC.

On 25 April 1963, the SCCC decided that Makarios&#x27;s 13 amendments were illegal. The Cyprus Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling found that Makarios had violated the constitution by failing to fully implement its measures and that Turkish Cypriots had not been allowed to return to their positions in government without first accepting the proposed constitutional amendments. On 21 May, the president of the SCCC resigned due to Makarios&#x27;s stance. On 15 July, Makarios ignored the decision of the SCCC. After the resignation of the president of the SCCC, the SCCC ceased to exist. The Supreme Court of Cyprus (SCC) was formed by merging the SCCC and the High Court of Cyprus, and undertook the jurisdiction and powers of the SCCC and HCC. On 30 November, Makarios legalised the 13 proposals. In 1963, the Greek Cypriot wing of the government created the Akritas plan which outlined a policy that would remove Turkish Cypriots from the government and ultimately lead to union with Greece. The plan stated that if the Turkish Cypriots objected then they should be &quot;violently subjugated before foreign powers could intervene&quot;.

On 21 December 1963, shots were fired at a Turkish Cypriot crowd that had gathered as a Greek police patrol stopped two Turkish Cypriots, claiming to ask for identification; two Turkish Cypriots were killed. Almost immediately, intercommunal violence broke out with a major Greek Cypriot paramilitary attack upon Turkish Cypriots in Nicosia and Larnaca. Though the TMT—a Turkish resistance group created in 1959 to promote a policy of (division or partition of Cyprus), in opposition to the Greek Cypriot nationalist group EOKA and its advocacy of (union of Cyprus with Greece)—committed a number of acts of retaliation, historian of the Cyprus conflict Keith Kyle noted that &quot;there is no doubt that the main victims of the numerous incidents that took place during the next few months were Turks&quot;. Seven hundred Turkish hostages, including children, were taken from the northern suburbs of Nicosia. Nikos Sampson, a nationalist and future coup leader, led a group of Greek Cypriot irregulars into the mixed suburb of Omorphita/Küçük Kaymaklı and attacked the Turkish Cypriot population. By the end of 1964, 364 Turkish Cypriots and 174 Greek Cypriots had been killed.

Turkish Cypriot members of the government had by now withdrawn, creating an essentially Greek Cypriot administration in control of all institutions of the state. After the partnership government collapsed, the Greek Cypriot-led administration was recognised as the legitimate government of the Republic of Cyprus at the stage of the debates in New York in February 1964. In September 1964, the then United Nations Secretary General, U Thant reported that &quot;UNFICYP carried out a detailed survey of all damage to properties throughout the island during the disturbances; it shows that in 109 villages, most of them Turkish-Cypriot or mixed villages, 527 houses have been destroyed while 2,000 others have suffered damage from looting&quot;. Widespread looting of Turkish Cypriot villages prompted 20,000 refugees to retreat into armed enclaves, where they remained for the next 11 years, relying on food and medical supplies from Turkey to survive. Turkish Cypriots formed paramilitary groups to defend the enclaves, leading to a gradual division of the island&#x27;s communities into two hostile camps. The violence had also seen thousands of Turkish Cypriots attempt to escape the violence by emigrating to Britain, Australia and Turkey. On 28 December 1967, the Turkish Cypriot Provisional Administration was founded.

===1974–1983===
On 6 July 1974, Makarios accused the Greek government of turning the Cypriot National Guard into an army of occupation. On 15 July 1974, the Greek military junta and the Cypriot National Guard backed a Greek Cypriot military coup d&#x27;état in Cyprus. Pro-Enosis Nikos Sampson replaced President Makarios as the new president. The Greek Cypriot coupists proclaimed the establishment of the &quot;Hellenic Republic of Cyprus&quot;. Turkey claimed that under the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee, the coup was sufficient reason for military action to protect the Turkish Cypriot populace, and thus Turkey invaded Cyprus on 20 July. Turkish forces proceeded to take over the northern four-elevenths of the island (about 36% of Cyprus&#x27;s total area). The coup caused a civil war filled with ethnic violence, after which it collapsed and Makarios returned to power.

On 2 August 1975, in the negotiations in Vienna, a population exchange agreement was signed between community leaders Rauf Denktaş and Glafcos Clerides under the auspices of the United Nations. On the basis of the Agreement, 196,000 Greek Cypriots living in the north were exchanged for 42,000 Turkish Cypriots living in the south (the number of settlers was disputed). The Orthodox Greek Cypriots in Rizokarpaso, Agios Andronikos and Agia Triada chose to stay in their villages, as did also Catholic Maronites in Asomatos, Karpasia and Kormakitis. Approximately 1,500 Greek Cypriots and 500 Turkish Cypriots remain missing. The invasion led to the formation of the first sovereign administrative body of Northern Cyprus in August 1974, the Autonomous Turkish Cypriot Administration.

In 1975, the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus () was declared as a first step towards a future federated Cypriot state, but was rejected by the Republic of Cyprus and the United Nations.

The north unilaterally declared its independence on 15 November 1983 under the name of the &quot;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&quot;. This was rejected by the UN via Security Council Resolution 541.

===1983–present===

In recent years, the politics of reunification has dominated the island&#x27;s affairs. The European Union decided in 2000 to accept Cyprus as a member, even if it was divided. This was due to their view of Rauf Denktaş, the pro-independence Turkish Cypriot President, as the main stumbling block, but also due to Greece threatening to block eastern EU expansion. It was hoped that Cyprus&#x27;s planned accession into the European Union would act as a catalyst towards a settlement. In the time leading up to Cyprus becoming a member, a new government was elected in Turkey and Rauf Denktaş lost political power in Cyprus. In 2004, a United Nations–brokered peace settlement was presented in a referendum to both sides. The proposed settlement was opposed by both the president of Cyprus, Tassos Papadopoulos, and Turkish Cypriot president Rauf Denktaş; in the referendum, while 65% of Turkish Cypriots accepted the proposal, 76% of Greek Cypriots rejected it. As a result, Cyprus entered the European Union divided, with the effects of membership suspended for Northern Cyprus.

Denktaş resigned in the wake of the vote, ushering in the pro-settlement Mehmet Ali Talat as his successor. However, the pro-settlement side and Mehmet Ali Talat lost momentum due to the ongoing embargo and isolation, despite promises from the European Union that these would be eased. As a result, the Turkish Cypriot electorate became frustrated. This led ultimately to the pro-independence side winning the general elections in 2009 and its candidate, former Prime Minister Derviş Eroğlu, winning the presidential elections in 2010. Although Eroğlu and his National Unity Party favours the independence of Northern Cyprus rather than reunification with the Republic of Cyprus, he is negotiating with the Greek Cypriot side towards a settlement for reunification.

In 2011, Turkish Cypriots protested against economic reforms made by the Northern Cyprus and Turkish governments; &quot;see 2011 Turkish Cypriot demonstrations&quot;.

In October 2020, Ersin Tatar, the candidate of the National Unity Party (UBP), was elected as the 5th president of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus after winning the presidential elections against incumbent president Mustafa Akıncı.

==Geography==
Northern Cyprus has an area of , which amounts to around a third of the island. to the north of Northern Cyprus lies Turkey with Syria lying to the east. It lies between latitudes 34° and 36° N, and longitudes 32° and 35° E.

The coastline of Northern Cyprus features two bays: the Morphou Bay and the Famagusta Bay, and there are four capes: Cape Apostolos Andreas, Cape Kormakitis, Cape Zeytin and Cape Kasa, with Cape Apostolos Andreas being the endpoint of the Karpaz Peninsula. The narrow Kyrenia mountain range lies along the northern coastline, and the highest point in Northern Cyprus, Mount Selvili, lies in this mountain range with an altitude of . The Mesaoria plain, extending from the Güzelyurt district to the eastern coastline is another defining landscape. The Mesaoria plains consist of plain fields and small hills, and is crossed by several seasonal streams. The eastern part of the plain is used for dry agriculture, such as the cultivation of wheat and barley, and are therefore predominantly green in the winter and spring, while it turns yellow and brown in the summer.

56.7% of the land in Northern Cyprus is agriculturally viable.

===Climate===
The winter in Northern Cyprus is cool and rainy, particularly between December and February; those three months see 60% of the region&#x27;s annual rainfall. These rains produce winter torrents that fill most of the rivers, which typically dry up as the year progresses. Snow has been known to fall on the Kyrenia Range, but seldom elsewhere in spite of low night temperatures. The short spring is characterised by unstable weather, occasional heavy storms and the &quot;meltem&quot;, or westerly wind. Summer is hot and dry enough to turn low-lying lands on the island brown. Parts of the island experience the &quot;Poyraz&quot;, a north-westerly wind, or the sirocco, a wind from Africa, which is dry and dusty. Summer is followed by a short, turbulent autumn.

Climate conditions on the island vary by geographical factors. The Mesaoria Plain, cut off from the summer breezes and from much of the humidity of the sea, may reach temperature peaks of . Humidity rises at the Karpaz Peninsula. Humidity and water temperature, , combine to stabilise coastal weather, which does not experience inland extremes. The Southern Range blocks air currents that bring rain and atmospheric humidity from the south-west, diminishing both on its eastern side.

=== Biodiversity ===

A relatively unspoiled part of the Mediterranean Basin biodiversity hotspot, Northern Cyprus has considerable ecological diversity, containing a variety of terrestrial habitats. Its flora includes around 1900 plant species, of which 19 are endemic to Northern Cyprus. Even in the urban areas, there is a lot of diversity: a study conducted on the banks of the Pedieos river around Nicosia found more than 750 different plant species. Among these species are 30 of the orchid species that are endemic to Cyprus. An endangered species that is the subject of folk tales and myths is the sea daffodil, found on the sandy beaches and endangered due to the disruption of their habitats.

The medoş tulip (&quot;Tulipa cypria&quot;) is a notable species that is endemic to Northern Cyprus; it is only found in the villages of Tepebaşı/Diorios and Avtepe/Ayios Simeon, and is celebrated with an annual festival.

In the national park in the Karpaz Peninsula around Cape Apostolos Andreas, there is a population of around 1,000 wild Cyprus donkeys. These donkeys, under the protection of the Turkish Cypriot government, are free to wander in herds over an area of The donkeys have earned a strong image for the peninsula, which is also home to a rich fauna and relatively big forests. The beaches of Northern Cyprus also include sites where hundreds of loggerhead turtles and green turtles lay eggs, which hatch at the end of the summer, followed by observers.

==Government and politics==
The politics of Northern Cyprus takes place in a framework of a semi-presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the president is head of state and the prime minister head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Assembly of the Republic. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.

The president is elected for a five-year term and is currently Ersin Tatar. The current prime minister is Ersan Saner. The legislature is the Assembly of the Republic, which has 50 members elected by proportional representation from six electoral districts. In the elections of January 2018, the right-wing National Unity Party won the most seats in the Assembly, and the current government is a coalition of the National Unity Party and the centrist People&#x27;s Party.

Due to Northern Cyprus&#x27;s isolation and heavy reliance on Turkish support, Turkey has a high level of influence over the country&#x27;s politics. This has led to some experts characterising it as an effective puppet state of Turkey. Other experts, however, have pointed out to the independent nature of elections and appointments in Northern Cyprus and disputes between the Turkish Cypriot and Turkish governments, concluding that &quot;puppet state&quot; is not an accurate description for Northern Cyprus.

===Administrative divisions===

Northern Cyprus is divided into six districts: Lefkoşa, Gazimağusa, Girne, Güzelyurt, İskele and Lefke. Lefke District was established by separation from the Güzelyurt District in 2016. In addition, there are further twelve sub-districts divided between the five larger districts and twenty-eight municipalities.




===International status and foreign relations===

No country other than the Republic of Turkey has officially recognised Northern Cyprus as a sovereign state. The United Nations considers it a territory of the Republic of Cyprus under Turkish occupation. Pakistan and Bangladesh had initially declared their recognition of Northern Cyprus as a sovereign state shortly after its declaration of independence, but they withdrew their recognition as a result of US pressure after the UN deemed the declaration illegal. The United Nations considers the declaration of independence by Northern Cyprus as legally invalid, as enunciated in several of its resolutions.

In the wake of the April 2004 referendum on the United Nations Annan Plan, and in view of the support of the Turkish Cypriot community for the plan, the European Union made pledges towards ending the isolation of Northern Cyprus. These included measures for trade and €259 million in aid. A pledge by the EU to lift the embargo on Northern Cyprus in the wake of the Annan Plan referendums has been blocked by the Greek Cypriot government in the European Council.

In 2004, the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation upgraded the delegation of the Turkish Cypriot Muslim community from &quot;observer community&quot; (1979) to that of a constituent state with the designation &quot;Turkish Cypriot State&quot;, making Northern Cyprus an observer member of the organisation. A number of high-profile formal meetings have also taken place between Turkish Cypriot presidents and various foreign leaders and politicians.

In 2004, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe gave observer status to the representatives of Turkish Cypriot community. Since then, Northern Cyprus&#x27;s representatives have actively participated in all PACE activities without voting rights.

The European Union considers the area not under effective control of the Republic of Cyprus as EU territory under Turkish military occupation and thus indefinitely exempt from EU legislation until a settlement has been found. The status of Northern Cyprus has become a recurrent issue especially during talks in the 2010s for Turkey&#x27;s membership of the EU where the division of the island is seen as a major stumbling block in Turkey&#x27;s road to membership and general EU-Turkey relations.

The Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan has issued a resolution recognising the independence of Northern Cyprus. As a result of the Nagorno-Karabakh issue, however, Azerbaijan itself has not recognised North Cyprus.

Turkish Cypriots have been applying for decades for passports issued by Cyprus. When the entry points with the Republic of Cyprus were closed, the applications were made either through middlemen or through consulates and embassies of Cyprus in other countries. A yearly increase in the number of applications for such passports of 10–15% was observed in years prior to 2001, when the rate greatly increased and 817 were issued in the first eight months of 2001 as compared to 448 for the whole of 2000. After the opening of the borders with the Republic of Cyprus, Turkish Cypriots started line-ups applying for Cypriot passports by visiting the Republic of Cyprus and showing proof of their Cypriot ancestry.

There are seven border crossings between Northern Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus. Since May 2004 some tourists have taken to flying to the Republic of Cyprus directly then crossing the green line to holiday in Northern Cyprus.

On 21 September 2011, Turkey and Northern Cyprus signed an EEZ border agreement in New York.

In October 2012, Northern Cyprus became an observer member of the Economic Cooperation Organization under the name &quot;Turkish Cypriot State&quot;. In November 2022, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus was admitted to the Organization of Turkic States as observer member.

===Military===
The Security Forces Command consists of an 8,000 strong force primarily made up of conscripted Turkish Cypriot males between the ages of 18 and 40. There is also an additional reserve force which consists of about 10,000 first-line and 16,000 second-line troops conscripted up to the age of 50. The Security Forces Command is lightly armed and heavily dependent on its mainland Turkish allies, from which it draws much of its officer corps. It is led by a Brigadier General drawn from the Turkish Army. It acts essentially as a gendarmerie charged with protection of the border of Northern Cyprus from Greek Cypriot incursions and maintaining internal security within Northern Cyprus.

In addition, the mainland Turkish Armed Forces maintains the Cyprus Turkish Peace Force which consists of around 30,000–40,000 troops drawn from the 9th Turkish Army Corps and comprising two divisions, the 28th and 39th. It is equipped with a substantial number of US-made M48 Patton main battle tanks and artillery weapons. The Turkish Air Force, Turkish Navy and Turkish Coast Guard also have a presence in Northern Cyprus. Although formally part of Turkish 4th Army, headquartered in İzmir, the sensitivities of the Cyprus situation means that the commander of the Cyprus Turkish Peace Force also reports directly to the Turkish General Staff in Ankara. The Cyprus Turkish Peace Force is deployed principally along the Green Line and in locations where hostile amphibious landings might take place.

The presence of the mainland Turkish military in Cyprus is highly controversial, having been denounced as an occupation force by the Republic of Cyprus and the international community. Several United Nations Security Council resolutions have called on the Turkish forces to withdraw.

===Human rights ===
In January 2011, &quot;The Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the question of Human Rights in Cyprus&quot; noted that the ongoing division of Cyprus continues to affect human rights throughout the island &quot;including freedom of movement, human rights pertaining to the question of missing persons, discrimination, the right to life, freedom of religion, and economic, social and cultural rights.&quot;

Freedom House has classified the perceived level of democratic and political freedom in Northern Cyprus as &quot;free&quot; since 2000 in its &quot;Freedom in the World&quot; report. The 2016 ranking was &quot;free&quot; with the scores (1: most free, 7: least free) political rights: 2/7, civil liberties: 2/7 and aggregate score: 79/100. Reporters Without Borders&#x27; World Press Freedom Index ranked Northern Cyprus 76th among 180 countries in 2015.

The Greek Cypriot and Maronite communities, numbering 343 and 118 respectively as of 2014, are denied the right to vote in presidential, parliamentary and municipal elections or run for office. Maronites do elect the leader of their village, whilst Greek Cypriots have two appointed leaders, one by the Turkish Cypriot government and the other by the Republic of Cyprus.

World Happiness Report 2016 of United Nations&#x27; Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) ranked Northern Cyprus 62nd among 157 countries. Gallup Healthways Well-Being Index of 2014 ranked Northern Cyprus 49th among 145 countries.

Northern Cyprus received 153 asylum applications during 2011–2014 according to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

==Economy==
The economy of Northern Cyprus is dominated by the services sector (69% of GDP in 2007) which includes the public sector, trade, tourism and education. The revenues gained by the education sector in 2011 was $400 million. Industry (light manufacturing) contributes 22% of GDP and agriculture 9%. The economy of Northern Cyprus is based on a free market approach and it became the top country in Europe in entrepreneurial intent to start a new business in 2014.

Economic development is adversely affected by the continuing Cyprus problem. Northern Cyprus is under an international embargo as the Republic of Cyprus, as the internationally recognised authority, has declared airports and ports in the area not under its effective control closed. All UN member states other than Turkey respect the closure of those ports and airports. As a result, Northern Cyprus is heavily dependent on Turkish economic support, and is still dependent on monetary transfers from the Turkish government.

Northern Cyprus uses the Turkish lira as legal tender rather than the euro, which links its economy to that of Turkey. Since the Republic of Cyprus joined the Eurozone and the movement of peoples between the north and south has become more free, the euro is also in wide circulation. Exports and imports have to go via Turkey; while the European Union promised an opening up of the ports after the Annan plan; this was blocked by the Republic of Cyprus and exporting through the south, while technically possible, remains impractical.

Despite the constraints imposed by the lack of international recognition, the nominal GDP growth rates of the economy in 2001–2005 were 5.4%, 6.9%, 11.4%, 15.4% and 10.6%, respectively. The real GDP growth rate in 2007 was estimated at 2%. This growth has been buoyed by the relative stability of the Turkish Lira and a boom in the education and construction sectors. Between 2002 and 2007, gross national product per capita more than tripled, from US$4,409 in 2002 to US$16,158 (in current U.S. dollars). The growth continued through the 2010s, with real growth rates of 3.7%, 3.9%, 1.8% and 1.1% respectively in 2010–2013. The unemployment rate declined through the 2010s and was at 8.3% in 2014.

In 2011, North Cyprus sold electricity to the Republic of Cyprus following an explosion in the southern part of the island which affected a large power station. The Northern Cyprus Water Supply Project, completed in 2015, is aimed at delivering water for drinking and irrigation from southern Turkey via a pipeline under the Mediterranean Sea.

International telephone calls are routed via a Turkish dialling code (+90 392) as Northern Cyprus has neither its own country code nor official ITU prefix. Similarly with the internet Northern Cyprus has no top level domain of its own and is under the Turkish second-level domain .nc.tr. Items of mail must be addressed &#x27;via Mersin 10, TURKEY&#x27; as the Universal Postal Union does not recognise Northern Cyprus as a separate entity. Amateur radio operators sometimes use callsigns beginning with &quot;1B&quot;, but these have no standing for awards or other operating credit.

===Tourism===
Tourism is considered one of the driving sectors of the Turkish Cypriot economy. The country received over 1.1 million tourists in 2012, when hotels and restaurants generated an income of $328 million and constituted 8.5% of the GDP. Accommodation and catering created more than 10,000 jobs in the same year. The tourism sector has seen great development in the 2000s and 2010s, with the number of tourists more than doubling, increased investment and hotel construction; official estimates of income derived from tourism were around 700 million US dollars in 2013 and the total bed capacity was estimated to be around 20,000.
Kyrenia is considered the capital of tourism in Northern Cyprus, with its numerous hotels, entertainment facilities, vibrant nightlife and shopping areas. In 2012, 62.7% of the visitors in Northern Cyprus stayed in the Girne District during their visit. Out of the 145 hotels in Northern Cyprus, 99 were in the Girne District in 2013.

Northern Cyprus has traditionally been an attraction for beach holidays, partly thanks to its reputation as an unspoiled area. Its mild climate, rich history and nature are seen as sources of attraction. A significant sector of eco-tourism has been developed in Northern Cyprus, as tourists visit it for bird watching, cycling, walking and observing flowers in the wild. It is praised for its relative safety, and especially for the Karpass Peninsula, its well-preservation. The peninsula is home to several sorts of tourism: it hosts the Bafra Tourism Area as a center for beach-goers, where four luxurious and large hotels were built until 2014, several facilities and regular festivals that highlight its rural qualities and exhibit local traditions, a remote natural park, the Kantara Castle attracting sightseers, and a marina that was built to host international yachts and boats, along with large facilities.

Casino tourism has also grown to become a significant contribution to the economy in Northern Cyprus. They were first opened in the 1990s, and have since become very popular with visitors from Turkey and the rest of the island, where casinos are banned. This has led to huge investments in the casino sector. However, the sector has been criticised due to claims of its lack of benefits for the small and middle-scale business and shop owners. The &quot;nightclubs&quot; that have been established for prostitution attract sex tourism to Northern Cyprus and the industry has been described as a &quot;civilized one&quot;, despite the sex workers being described as &quot;vulnerable to abuse&quot;.

===Infrastructure===
The share of the transport and communications industry in the GDP of Northern Cyprus is constantly varying; it decreased from 12.1% in 2008 to 8.5% in 2011, but rose again to 9.3% in 2012.

Air transport is a major route of entry into Northern Cyprus. The country is home to two airports, the Ercan International Airport and the Geçitkale Airport, of which only Ercan is currently functioning. The Ercan airport saw an important renovation in the 2010s that greatly increased its passenger traffic, it was used by 1.76 million passengers in the first seven months of 2014 alone. Non-stop flights are only available from multiple points in Turkey through a number of Turkish carriers. Direct scheduled and charter flights take place from other countries, but with mandatory stopovers in Turkey. 600 charter flights were scheduled for 2013. Scheduled destinations include cities such as London and Manchester, while charter flight destinations include cities such as Berlin and Ljubljana.

Direct flights to Northern Cyprus and the trade traffic through the Northern Cypriot ports are restricted as part of the embargo on Northern Cypriot ports. The airports of Geçitkale and Ercan are only recognised as legal ports of entry by Turkey and Azerbaijan. Direct charter flights between Poland and North Cyprus started on 20 June 2011. The seaports in Famagusta and Kyrenia have been declared closed to all shipping by the Republic of Cyprus since 1974. By agreement between Northern Cyprus and Syria, there was a ship tour between Famagusta and Latakia, Syria before the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War. Since the opening of the Green Line Turkish Cypriot residents are allowed to trade through ports recognized by the Republic of Cyprus.

With the lack of a railway system, the country&#x27;s highways are used for transport between major cities. In the 21st century, these highways were upgraded into dual carriageways, with some roads in the Karpass area still being upgraded . Northern Cyprus has around of roads, with two thirds of these roads paved. Recent constructions included the construction of a Northern Coast Highway, which was hailed as a major incentive for economic development. 

The electricity grid is connected to the Republic of Cyprus, and an interconnector with Turkey would decrease reliance on fossil fuels.

==Demographics==

Northern Cyprus&#x27;s first official census was performed in 1996. The population recorded was 200,587. The second census, carried out in 2006, revealed the population of Northern Cyprus to be 265,100, of which majority is composed of indigenous Turkish Cypriots (including refugees from Southern Cyprus) and settlers from Turkey. Of the 178,000 Turkish Cypriot citizens, 82% are native Cypriots (145,000). Of the 45,000 people born to non-Cypriot parentage, nearly 40% (17,000) were born in Cyprus. The figure for non-citizens, including students, guest workers and temporary residents stood at 78,000 people.

The third official census of Northern Cyprus was carried out in 2011, made under the auspices of UN observers. It returned a total population of 294,906. These results were disputed by some political parties, labour unions and local newspapers. The government was accused of deliberately under-counting the population, after apparently giving an estimate of 700,000 before the census, in order to demand financial help from Turkey. One source claims that the population in the north has reached 500,000, split between 50% Turkish Cypriots and 50% Turkish settlers or Cypriot-born children of such settlers. Researcher Mete Hatay has written that such reports are &quot;wildly speculative&quot; and are picked up by opposition parties for political benefit, which resulted in reports in the south. Such reports have never been scientifically or statistically scrutinised, despite opportunities of opposition parties to do so using the electoral rolls in their possession, thereby continuing a &quot;war of numbers&quot;.

The Government of Northern Cyprus estimates that the 1983 population of Northern Cyprus was 155,521. Estimates by the government of the Republic of Cyprus from 2001 place the population at 200,000, of which 80–89,000 are Turkish Cypriots and 109,000–117,000 are designated as Turkish settlers by the Republic of Cyprus. An island-wide census in 1960 indicated the number of Turkish Cypriots as 102,000 and Greek Cypriots as 450,000. , the settlers constituted no more than 25% of the electorate in Northern Cyprus. The degree of the integration of mainland Turks to the Turkish Cypriot community varies; some identify as Turkish Cypriots and have culturally integrated, while some embrace a Turkish identity.

Northern Cyprus is almost entirely Turkish-speaking. English, however, is widely spoken as a second language.

There are 644 Greek Cypriots living in Rizokarpaso (Dipkarpaz) and 364 Maronites in Kormakitis. 162,000 Greek Cypriots were forcibly evicted from their homes in the North by the invading force of the Turkish army. Rizokarpaso is the home of the biggest Greek-speaking population in the north. The Greek-Cypriot inhabitants are still supplied by the UN, and Greek-Cypriot products are consequently available in some shops.
===Religion===

The majority of Turkish Cypriots (99%) are Sunni Muslims. Northern Cyprus is a secular state. Alcohol is frequently consumed within the community and most Turkish Cypriot women do not cover their heads; however headscarves are still worn on occasion by public figures as a symbol of the inhabitants&#x27; Turkish culture, or simply as a conservative form of dress. However, some religious traditions still play a role within the community. Turkish Cypriot males are generally circumcised in accordance with religious beliefs.

===Education===
The education system in Northern Cyprus consists of pre-school education, primary education, secondary education and higher education. Five years of primary education is mandatory.

Higher Education Planning Evaluation Accreditation and Coordination Council (YÖDAK) of Northern Cyprus is a member of International Network for Quality Assurance Agencies in Higher Education (INQAAHE).

In 2013 there were 63,765 university students from 114 countries in nine universities in Northern Cyprus. In 2014, the number of students increased to 70,004, (15,210 Turkish Cypriots; 36,148 from Turkey; 18,646 international students): Near East University (NEU), Girne American University, Middle East Technical University-TRNC, European University of Lefke, Cyprus International University, Eastern Mediterranean University (EMU), Istanbul Technical University-TRNC, University of Mediterranean Karpasia, and University of Kyrenia, all established since 1974. EMU is an internationally recognised institution of higher learning with more than 1000 faculty members from 35 countries. There are 15,000 students in EMU representing 68 nationalities. The 8 universities have been approved by the Higher Education Council of Turkey. Eastern Mediterranean University and Near East University are full individual members of the European University Association. EMU is a full member of the Community of Mediterranean Universities, Federation Universities of Islamic World, International Association of Universities and International Council of Graphic Design Associations, and was ranked as the best university in the island and among the top 500 in Europe by Webometrics. Girne American University, in the northern coastal city of Kyrenia, opened a campus in Canterbury, United Kingdom in 2009, and was accredited by the British Accreditation Council in 2010.

Northern Cyprus regularly participates in international Robocup competition, and took 14th place out of 20 in 2013. The country has supercomputers with which it participates in CERN experiments that led to the discovery of the Higgs boson. Northern Cyprus is among participant countries of Solar Challenge of solar powered vehicles in South Africa in 2014.

==Culture==
=== Music and dance ===

Turkish Cypriot folk music consists of a rich variety of local tunes, influenced by the mainland Turkish music to a limited extent. Historically, it was shaped around the tradition of weddings, the primary social gatherings at the time. Violin, goblet drum, known locally as &quot;darbuka&quot;, zurna and other drums were heavily used in these gatherings, and a large number of traditional songs developed based on this legacy. Turkish Cypriot culture also incorporates a great diversity of folk dances with various influences, including different versions of karsilamas, çiftetelli and zeybek.

The Northern Cyprus State Symphony Orchestra has been active since 1975. The Bellapais Abbey in Kyrenia hosts international festivals of classical music, and is considered in important platform of classical music. North Nicosia has its own Nicosia Municipal Orchestra that performs at open spaces, such as parks and squares, and is also home to the annual Walled City Jazz Festival. Rüya Taner is a Turkish Cypriot pianist who has achieved international acclaim.

Turkish Cypriot cities and towns regularly organise festivals that include performances of local and international singers and bands. Some Turkish Cypriot singers, such as Ziynet Sali and Işın Karaca, have achieved fame in Turkey. The Turkish Cypriot band Sıla 4 produced music that is considered essential for the Turkish Cypriot identity, and also acquired fame in Turkey. Rock and pop music are popular with the public in Northern Cyprus, important singers and bands include SOS and Fikri Karayel.

===Literature===
Poetry is the most widely published form of literature in Northern Cyprus. Turkish Cypriot poetry is based on both the effects of Turkish literature and the culture of the island of Cyprus, along with some reflection of the British colonial history.

The first era of Turkish Cypriot poetry after the introduction of the Latin alphabet, characterised by poets such as Nazif Süleyman Ebeoğlu, Urkiye Mine Balman, Engin Gönül, Necla Salih Suphi and Pembe Marmara, had strong nationalistic elements due to the political attitudes of Turkish Cypriots at the time and stylistically reflected the poetry of the Turkish mainland. Meanwhile, other poets, such as Özker Yaşın, Osman Türkay, who was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature twice, and Nevzat Yalçın sought to write in more original styles, with the influence of nascent poetic styles in Turkey and those in Britain. This group of poets were very prolific and increased the popularity of poetry in the Turkish Cypriot community, and are seen as key figures in Turkish Cypriot literature.

The nationalism gave way to a notion of Cypriotness in the 1970s, with the influence of Yaşın, Türkay and Yalçın. During this period, the so-called &quot;1974 generation of poets&quot; arose, led by poets including Mehmet Yaşın, Hakkı Yücel, Nice Denizoğlu, Neşe Yaşın, Ayşen Dağlı and Canan Sümer. The poetry of this generation was characterised by the appreciation of the Turkish Cypriot identity as distinct from Turkish identity and the identification of Cyprus as the Turkish Cypriot homeland instead of Turkey, in contrast to the previous nationalist poetry. This approach is often called the &quot;Cypriot poetry of rejection&quot; as it resists the influence of Turkey, highlighting the cultural rift between Turkey and Cyprus due to the recent experience of war and therefore the independence of the Turkish Cypriot poetry and identity. This was followed by an increased adoption of the Mediterranean identity in the 1980s, accompanied by the effects of the liberalisation of the Turkish Cypriot society, as reflected in the feminist elements, of which a particular example is Neriman Cahit.

===Theatre===
Theatre in Northern Cyprus is mostly carried out by the Turkish Cypriot State Theatre, municipal theatres and a number of private theatrical companies. Cyprus Theatre Festival, organised by the Nicosia Turkish Municipality is a large organisation with institutions from Turkey participating as well. There are no major halls built specifically for theatre in Northern Cyprus, so plays often take place in conference halls.

The origins of Turkish Cypriot theatre lie in Karagöz and Hacivat, a shadow play that was popularised in the island as a form of entertainment during the Ottoman era. This form of theatre has lost its popularity nowadays, but remains to be televised during religious festivals. After the 1840s, as the Ottoman Empire started modernising, theatre with greater European elements met with the Turkish Cypriot public. However, the inception of Turkish Cypriot theatre in the modern sense is considered the staging of the play &quot;Vatan Yahut Silistre&quot; (&quot;Homeland vs. Silistra&quot;) by Turkish playwright Namık Kemal in 1908. This was followed by a proliferation of theatrical activity in the Turkish Cypriot community as local plays were written and staged and theatrical companies from Turkey took the stage in Cyprus by the 1920s, all the major towns in Cyprus had Turkish Cypriot plays that were performed regularly.

In the 1960s, Turkish Cypriot theatre started to be institutionalised. A leading theatre group named &quot;İlk Sahne&quot; (First Stage), founded in 1963, was renamed the Turkish Cypriot State Theatre in 1966, and has since performed more than 85 plays. Theatre is currently a very popular form of art in Northern Cyprus, with long queues forming for tickets of the plays in the Cyprus Theatre Festival, and the number of theatre-goers constantly increasing.

===Cinema===
&quot;Anahtar&quot; (&quot;Key&quot;), released in 2011, was the first full-length film entirely produced in Northern Cyprus. Some other co-productions have also taken place. A co-production of Northern Cyprus, Turkey, Britain and the Netherlands, (&quot;Code Name Venus&quot;) was shown in the Cannes Film Festival in 2012. The film director and screenwriter Derviş Zaim achieved fame with his 2003 film &quot;Mud (Çamur)&quot; which won the UNESCO award at the Venice Film Festival.

The documentary film &quot;Kayıp Otobüs&quot; (&quot;The Missing Bus&quot;), directed by Turkish Cypriot journalist Fevzi Tașpınar, was aired on the TRT TV as well as participating in the Boston Film Festival in 2011. The film tells the story of eleven Turkish Cypriot workers who left their homes in a bus in 1964 that never came back. Their remains were found in a well in Cyprus in October 2006.

===Cuisine===
Northern Cyprus is also well known for several dishes; among them are kebabs made of skewered lamb (şiş kebab) or ground with herbs and spices and made into a kofte or şeftali kebab. Other dishes are based on meat wrapped in flat bread such as lahmacun. Vegetarian cuisine includes stuffed vegetable based dishes &quot;yalancı dolma&quot; or many other dishes made with a bean or pulse such as börülce which consists of Swiss chard cooked with black-eyed peas. There are also plant based foods such as molohiya or root based stews such as kolokas.

===Sports===
There are five stadiums in Northern Cyprus, with each holding a capacity ranging anywhere from 7,000 to 30,000. The most popular sport in Northern Cyprus is football. There are over 29 sport federations in Northern Cyprus with a total registered membership of 13,950 6,054 been registered practitioners for, taekwondo-karate-aikido-kurash, with shooting having 1,150 (registered) and hunting having 1,017 (registered) members. Several of sport clubs participate in leagues in Turkey. These include the Fast Break Sport Club in Turkey&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Basketball Regional League; the Beşparmak Sport Club in Turkey&#x27;s Handball Premier League; and the Lefke European University Turkey Table-tennis Super League. Water sports such as windsurfing, jetskiing, waterskiing and sailing are also available at beaches throughout the coastline of Northern Cyprus. Sailing is especially found at Escape Beach Club, near Kyrenia.

Northern Cyprus is a member of the World Pool-Billiard Association.

<text>Mario Gabriele Andretti (born February 28, 1940) is an American former racing driver and businessman, who competed in Formula One from to , and IndyCar from 1964 to 1994. Andretti won the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Lotus, and won 12 Grands Prix across 14 seasons. In American open-wheel racing, Andretti won four IndyCar National Championship titles and the Indianapolis 500 in 1969; in stock car racing, he won the Daytona 500 in 1967. In endurance racing, Andretti is a three-time winner of the 12 Hours of Sebring.

Born in the Kingdom of Italy, Andretti and his family were displaced from Istria during the Istrian–Dalmatian exodus and eventually emigrated to Nazareth, Pennsylvania in 1955. He began dirt track racing with his twin brother Aldo four years later, with Andretti progressing to USAC Championship Car in 1964. In open-wheel racing, he won back-to-back USAC titles in 1965 and 1966, also finishing runner-up in 1967 and 1968. He also contested stock car racing in his early career, winning the 1967 Daytona 500 with Holman-Moody. He took his first major sportscar racing victory at the 12 Hours of Sebring that year with Ford. Andretti debuted in Formula One at the in with Lotus, where he qualified on pole position. He contested several further Grands Prix with Lotus in , a year in which he won his third USAC title and the Indianapolis 500. In , Andretti took his maiden podium finish at the with STP, driving a privateer March 701. He signed for Ferrari that year, winning at Sebring again.

Andretti took his maiden victory in Formula One at the season-opening in , on debut for Ferrari. He took his third Sebring victory the following year. After part-time roles for Ferrari and Parnelli in and , respectively, Andretti joined the latter full-time for after finishing runner-up in the SCCA Continental Championship. He moved back to Lotus in , winning the season-ending and helping develop the 78. Andretti won four Grands Prix in , finishing third in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. He won the title in after achieving six victories, becoming the second World Drivers&#x27; Champion from the United States. After winless and campaigns with Lotus, he moved to Alfa Romeo in . Following two fill-in appearances for Williams and Ferrari in , Andretti retired from Formula One with 12 wins, 18 pole positions, 10 fastest laps and 19 podiums.

Andretti returned to full-time IndyCar racing in 1982, placing third in the standings with Patrick, amongst winning the Michigan 500. After finishing third again with Newman/Haas in his 1983 campaign, he won his fourth IndyCar title in 1984, 15 years after the previous and his first sanctioned by CART. He won the Pocono 500 in 1986 and remained with Newman/Haas until 1994; his victory at Phoenix in 1993 made him the oldest winner in IndyCar history, aged 53, as well as the first driver to win a race in four different decades. Andretti retired with 52 wins, 65 pole positions and 141 podiums in IndyCar. His 111 official victories on major circuits across several motorsport disciplines saw his name become synonymous with speed in American popular culture. His sons, Michael and Jeff, were both racing drivers, the former winning the CART title in 1991 and previously owning Andretti Global. Andretti is set to serve on the board of directors of Cadillac in Formula One from its debut season onwards. Andretti was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2000.

== Early life ==
=== Childhood in Italy ===
Mario Gabriele Andretti was born on February 28, 1940, to an Istrian-Italian family in Montona, Istria, Kingdom of Italy (present-day Motovun, Croatia). He was born six hours before his twin brother Aldo. He is the son of Alvise &quot;Gigi&quot; Andretti, who worked as a farm administrator in Italy and for Bethlehem Steel in the U.S., and his wife Rina. He also had an older sister, Anna Maria Andretti Burley.

Andretti&#x27;s family owned a 2,100-acre farm in Montona, but after World War II, the Treaty of Paris (1947) transferred the territory to communist-controlled Yugoslavia. As a result, the Andretti family joined the Istrian–Dalmatian exodus in 1948. The family lost all their land and was permitted to take only one truckload of possessions. They spent seven years in a refugee camp in Lucca, living in an abandoned college dormitory without running water.

The Andretti twins were interested in racing at an early age. At age five, they raced hand-crafted wooden cars through the Montona streets. After moving to Lucca, the brothers got a job parking cars at a local garage. In his autobiography, Andretti wrote, &quot;The first time I fired up a car, felt the engine shudder and the wheel come to life in my hands, I was hooked. It was a feeling I can&#x27;t describe. I still get it every time I get into a race car.&quot; 

The garage owners noticed the brothers&#x27; passion for racing and brought them to watch the 1954 Mille Miglia, which was won by two-time Formula One champion Alberto Ascari. Ascari became Andretti&#x27;s personal idol. The twins also visited Monza for the Italian Grand Prix, where Andretti saw Ascari race against Juan Manuel Fangio. Although the twins did not have a grandstand seat, Andretti recalled &quot;being just mesmerized, overwhelmed by the sound, by the speed.&quot;

=== Move to the United States ===
Following a three-year wait for U.S. visas, the Andretti family moved to the United States in 1955. After an eleven-day journey on the SS &quot;Conte Biancamano&quot;, they sailed into New York Harbor on Anna Maria&#x27;s birthday of June 16. With just $125 in cash, they settled in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, where Alvise Andretti&#x27;s brother-in-law Tony lived. Although Alvise planned to leave after five years, the family never left the United States.

Andretti opposed leaving Italy at the time. His father felt that moving to America would give his children the best opportunity to succeed in life, but did not want his sons to become motor racers, as the sport was extremely dangerous at the time. Andretti planned to become a welder, but racing was &quot;the only passion [he] really had career wise,&quot; and he admitted that he might not have been able to become a racer if he had stayed in Italy. Andretti&#x27;s father did not watch him race until Andretti reached IndyCar in 1964.

In his 1970 biography, Andretti said that he became a naturalized U.S. citizen on April 15, 1964. (His IndyCar debut was April 19, 1964.) Andretti later revealed that he actually obtained U.S. citizenship on April 7, 1965.

== Early racing career ==
=== Debut in dirt track racing ===
The first car Andretti regularly drove was his father&#x27;s 1957 Chevrolet, which the twins did not race, but nonetheless upgraded with features like a glasspack muffler and fuel injection. The twins were surprised to find that Nazareth hosted a half-mile dirt track, Nazareth Speedway. They used money they made working at their uncle&#x27;s Sunoco station to refurbish a 1948 Hudson, using a stolen beer barrel as a fuel tank. The car was ready to race when the twins were 19 years old, but the minimum age to race was 21, so the brothers convinced a newspaper editor to falsify their drivers&#x27; licenses. After Aldo got into a major accident, the local chief of police spotted the forgery but turned a blind eye to save Aldo&#x27;s health insurance.

The twins did not tell their father that they were racing until Aldo fractured his skull in a race and spent 62 days in a coma. Andretti&#x27;s father nearly disowned Mario when the latter insisted on racing again, but eventually relented. Aldo also resumed racing, but suffered a career-ending accident in 1969.

The twins got off to a good start, picking up two wins each in sportsman racing after their first four races. In their first two weeks of racing, they won $300; they had previously been making $45 a week at the gas station. From 1960 to 1961, Mario won 21 out of 46 modified stock car races. The twins raced against each other only once, at Oswego Speedway in 1967; Mario won, with Aldo finishing 10th after a brake failure.

To intimidate their opponents, the twins bought Italian racing suits and fabricated a story about racing in junior formulae back in Italy. Andretti maintained the fiction for many years. In 2016, he admitted that the story was fabricated. He recalled that it &quot;psych[ed] [the opponents] out, big time.&quot;

=== Single-seater racing ===
Despite his early successes in modified stock cars, Andretti&#x27;s goal was to race in single-seater open-wheel cars. He started by racing midget cars in the American Racing Drivers Club (ARDC) series from 1961 to 1963, starting with 3/4 (sized) midgets before graduating to full-sized midgets. In March 1962, he won a midget race, which he dubbed &quot;my first victory of any consequence.&quot; He raced in over one hundred events in 1963, and scored 29 top-five finishes in 46 ARDC races. He finished third in the 1963 ARDC season standings. On Labor Day in 1963, Andretti won three feature races at two different tracks, an afternoon race at Flemington and a doubleheader at Hatfield, after which reporter Chris Economaki told him that &quot;you just bought the ticket to the big time.&quot;

From midget cars, the next step on the East Coast racing ladder was sprint car racing, first with the United Racing Club (URC) series and then with the United States Auto Club (USAC) series. Andretti attempted to secure a full-time URC ride, but received only spot starts. However, USAC team owner Rufus Gray gave him a full-time drive for 1964. He won one race at Salem and finished third in the season standings behind veterans Don Branson and Jud Larson. To cover his expenses, he worked as a foreman at a golf cart factory.

Andretti continued to race in sprint cars after progressing to IndyCar. In 1965 he won once at Ascot Park, and finished tenth in the season standings. In 1966 he won five times (Cumberland, Oswego, Rossburg, Salem, and Phoenix), but finished second in the standings, behind Roger McCluskey. In 1967 he won two of the three events that he entered. 

== USAC IndyCar career ==
From 1956 to 1978, the top open-wheel racing series in North America was the USAC National Championship, alternatively referred to as IndyCar or Champ Car. In 1971, USAC split off its dirt-track races into a separate National Dirt Car Championship. The pavement championship retained the name USAC Championship Car Series, while the dirt championship had fewer races and was later rebranded to the &quot;Silver Crown Series.&quot;

=== Breaking in (1964) ===
Andretti entered IndyCar during the 1964 season, while still racing full-time in sprint cars. On April 19, 1964, the Doug Stearly team gave him a spot start at the 1964 Trenton 100. He started 16th and finished 11th. 

Andretti spent the first portion of the 1964 season trying to find a full-time IndyCar drive. An opening appeared to materialize when one of the big three IndyCar teams, Dean Van Lines Racing Division (DVL), lost Chuck Hulse to injury. Andretti met with DVL&#x27;s chief mechanic, Clint Brawner, to ask for the drive. Although Andretti had come with an introduction from his sprint car team owner, Rufus Gray, Brawner turned Andretti down, as he was skeptical of sprint car racing and felt that Andretti was not ready to compete. He hired Bob Mathouser to replace Hulse. Andretti joined Lee Glessner&#x27;s outfit, but was forced to sit out the 1964 Indianapolis 500.

=== Dean Van Lines, Andretti Racing, and STP (1964–1971) ===
Andretti got his big break with DVL midway through the 1964 season, after the youngster impressed Brawner in two races: a sprint car race in Terre Haute, Indiana and an IndyCar race at Langhorne Speedway, where Andretti finished ninth, just three places below Mathouser, who had the better car. Brawner had mentored a young A. J. Foyt, and noticed that Andretti &quot;worked as diligently on the car as Foyt had as a rookie with me.&quot; Andretti was pleased to join what he called one of the &quot;few outfits worth driving for.&quot; He completed the final eight races of the season with DVL, finishing 11th in the season standings. He was named IndyCar Rookie of the Year. After the season, Brawner agreed to make Andretti his permanent driver in place of Hulse.

==== 1965–1969: Years of domination ====
The Andretti-Brawner combination would soon come to dominate the sport. It quickly attracted technical and financial support from Firestone and Ford; Brawner said that Ford treated DVL like a works team. From 1965 to 1969, Andretti won three USAC IndyCar titles. He also came within 93 points of winning five in a row; for comparison, at the time, 100 points was the difference between finishing sixth and seventh at the Indianapolis 500. At the peak of his statistical dominance, Andretti won 29 of 85 USAC championship races between 1966 and 1969.

In 1965, Andretti&#x27;s first full season with DVL, he took advantage of the team&#x27;s new Brawner Hawk, a derivation of the Brabham Formula One chassis. His third-place finish at the 1965 Indianapolis 500 earned him the race&#x27;s Rookie of the Year award. He won his first IndyCar race at the Hoosier Grand Prix. Although he won only one race that year, he scored six second places and three third places, and scored points in 16 out of 18 races. His closest competitor, A. J. Foyt (who had won four of the last five USAC titles) won five races but failed to score seven times. At age 25, Andretti became the youngest IndyCar champion in history, a record he held for thirty years until Jacques Villeneuve won the 1995 title. To his irritation, however, when he appeared on Johnny Carson at the end of the season, he was introduced as the Indy 500 Rookie of the Year, which he felt downplayed his title win.

In 1966, Andretti won his second straight USAC title. In contrast to his maiden title win, Andretti won eight of fifteen starts and led 1,142 laps, nearly 1,000 laps more than his closest competitor. He led 54.5% of all laps in 1966, an record until Al Unser&#x27;s 66.8% in 1970, and still the second-highest figure in history as of the 2022 season. Andretti also took pole at the 1966 Indianapolis 500, but retired after 27 laps with a mechanical failure.

In 1967, Andretti lost the season USAC championship to A. J. Foyt. Although Andretti won eight races, Foyt won the 1967 Indianapolis 500; Andretti was on pole at Indianapolis but lost a wheel. Andretti fought through broken ribs to stay in the title race. Foyt carried a 340-point lead over Andretti going into the season-ending Rex Mays 300 at Riverside. Andretti ran out of fuel with four laps to go and settled for third, costing him 180 points. Ordinarily, he would have won the championship anyway, as third place was worth 420 points and Foyt had crashed on lap 50. However, Foyt&#x27;s tire sponsor Goodyear arranged for him to commandeer Roger McCluskey&#x27;s car to prevent Andretti, a Firestone man, from winning. Foyt piloted McCluskey&#x27;s car to fifth place. Despite a point deduction, he won the championship by 80 points. Andretti received his first Driver of the Year award but was deflated by how the season ended, saying, &quot;I had the championship in my hands, and then it was gone.&quot; 

DVL owner Al Dean died at the end of the 1967 season. Per his wishes, the team was wound up. The estate sold the team&#x27;s assets to Andretti, who became an owner-driver under the name Andretti Racing Enterprises. Brawner stayed on as chief mechanic. In 1968, Andretti once again lost the title at the final race of the season at Riverside, but this time in a reversal of the events of 1967. Andretti held a 304-point lead over Bobby Unser at the start and led Unser on track by 47 seconds at one point. However, his engine failed on lap 58. He borrowed Joe Leonard&#x27;s car (whose brakes were dead) and then Lloyd Ruby&#x27;s car for the final stretch. He fought back to third, but received only 165 points instead of the usual 420 since only his laps in Ruby&#x27;s car were counted. Unser finished second, scoring 480 points. Unser won the title by 11 points, the narrowest margin in USAC history. Despite losing the title, Andretti set records for second-place finishes in a season (11 times in 27 starts) and podium finishes in a season (16), which still stand to this day.
Unhappy about being an owner-driver, and concerned that Firestone was cutting back its sponsorship budget, Andretti sold the team to Andy Granatelli&#x27;s STP Corporation before the 1969 season. Granatelli retained the DVL cars and staff, although Brawner disliked Granatelli and insisted that he not participate in racing decisions. Andretti won nine races in 1969, including the 1969 Indianapolis 500 and the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. He won his third title and was named ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year. His 5,025 points were a USAC record, and he scored nearly twice as many points as runner-up Al Unser (2,630). His IndyCar prize money of $365,165 (including a $205,727 check for winning the Indianapolis 500) was, by one count, the largest single-season haul in the history of American sports to that point, and his total pay that year (including endorsements) was estimated at as much as $1 million.

==== 1970–1971: Team split and struggles ====
The core of the team split up after the 1969 title season, when Goodyear persuaded STP mechanics Clint Brawner and Jim McGee to start their own team. Andretti remained with STP, which agreed to sponsor him during the 1970 Formula One season in a privateer March.

Various reasons were given for the split. Brawner said that he and McGee left because Granatelli and Firestone were underpaying them, and added that his old-school thinking clashed with Andretti and McGee&#x27;s desire to innovate. He was particularly hurt that Andretti wanted to retire the old Brawner Hawk for a chassis from Lotus. However, it was also rumored that Andretti forced out Brawner, which Andretti denied. In his foreword to Brawner&#x27;s 1975 autobiography, Andretti wrote that &quot;we had our disagreements, but until things started turning sour near the end, we worked them out.&quot; He added that &quot;there are many reasons why our operation fell apart. ... Racing relationships are like Hollywood marriages: they seldom last long.&quot; McGee said that Andretti and Brawner had been &quot;feuding for years,&quot; but &quot;certainly respected each other.&quot; He opined that Brawner was unwilling to work for Granatelli. According to an urban legend, Brawner&#x27;s wife Kay hexed Andretti&#x27;s family after the STP split, giving rise to the so-called &quot;Andretti curse.&quot;

Neither side fully recovered from the split. The Brawner/McGee team&#x27;s financial backer went broke, and McGee returned to STP in 1971. Meanwhile, Andretti settled for a fifth-place finish in 1970, and the STP Formula One team shut down after one season. In 1971, Andretti fell to ninth in USAC&#x27;s paved track championship. He scored no points in the dirt track standings, with a best finish of 13th. 

=== Parnelli (1972–1975) ===
For the 1972 season, Andretti left STP and joined Vel&#x27;s Parnelli Jones Racing. Parnelli was IndyCar&#x27;s dominant team at the time, with 1970 champion Al Unser and 1971 champion Joe Leonard. Andretti persuaded the team to hire Lotus designer Maurice Philippe, and Jim McGee also joined the team. The combination was expected to be a &quot;superteam.&quot;

Andretti never won an IndyCar title with Parnelli. In his three full-time IndyCar seasons with the team (1972–1974), Andretti finished 11th, 5th, and 14th, while his teammate Leonard won the 1972 title. He did better on dirt tracks, winning the 1974 title after winning three out of five races. He nearly won the 1973 title as well, but teammate Al Unser beat him even though Andretti won two out of three races.

During this period Andretti was increasingly drawn to formula racing. He made guest appearances in Formula One with Ferrari in 1972, and raced in Formula 5000 in 1974 and 1975. In 1975, Andretti stopped competing full-time in IndyCar, instead driving full-time for the Parnelli Formula One team. After quitting Formula One in early 1976, Parnelli released Andretti from his USAC contract so that he could focus on Formula One.

=== Penske (1976–1978) ===
While racing with Team Lotus, Andretti appeared sporadically in IndyCar with McGee&#x27;s new team, Penske Racing. In nineteen races from 1976 to 1978, he won one race (at Trenton in 1978) and collected eight top-five finishes.

== Stock car racing career ==
At the height of his IndyCar career, Andretti also made thirty appearances in top-level stock car racing from 1965 to 1969. Along with A. J. Foyt, he is one of two drivers to ever win NASCAR&#x27;s most prestigious race, the Daytona 500, without being a full-time stock car driver.

In USAC, Andretti scored one win and eight top-five finishes in sixteen races from 1965 to 1968. His best season performance was 1967, when he competed in eight out of 22 races, won round 12 at Mosport, and finished seventh in the standings.

In the NASCAR Grand National Series, Andretti was less successful on average, with one win, one top-five finish, and three top tens in fourteen races from 1966 to 1969. He primarily drove for Ford works team Holman-Moody, securing the drive through his connections at Ford headquarters. He generally did not get the first pick of equipment and pit crews, and said that a lack of technical support forced him to ask a rookie, Donnie Allison, for help setting up his car. After convincing the team to give him a top-spec engine, he won the 1967 Daytona 500, but alleged that the team tried to sabotage his race so that its lead driver, Fred Lorenzen, could inherit the win. His friend Parnelli Jones backed up the accusation. Andretti stopped competing in NASCAR after 1969, as race seats at teams of the caliber of Holman-Moody rarely came open after the 1960s.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Andretti competed in six editions of the International Race of Champions (IROC), an invitational stock car series with a limited calendar. He won IROC VI and finished second in IROC III and IROC V. He won three races in twenty events.

== Formula One career ==
=== Part-time roles (1968–1970) ===

Although the Indianapolis 500 dropped off the Formula One calendar in 1960, some teams continued racing at Indianapolis, including Colin Chapman&#x27;s Team Lotus. At the 1965 Indianapolis 500, Lotus star Jim Clark won and Andretti finished third as the top-placed rookie. On Clark&#x27;s recommendation, Chapman invited Andretti to race in Formula One, saying, &quot;When you&#x27;re ready, call me.&quot;

Andretti joined Lotus for the 1968 Italian Grand Prix. He was delighted by the Lotus 49B, saying that its handling was a major improvement over IndyCar. He beat the Monza lap record in testing, but was disqualified after flying back to America for a contractually required race. He later said that the Monza officials broke a promise to waive the applicable rule on his behalf.

Andretti got his real start in Formula One at the 1968 United States Grand Prix and took pole. Due to his disqualification at Monza (where he had qualified tenth), he became the first Formula One driver to start his first race from pole. Jackie Stewart overtook him on the first lap, but the two drivers were neck-and-neck until Andretti&#x27;s nose cone broke, forcing him to pit. He eventually retired with a clutch failure, but he had made a strong impression. Reviewing the race&quot;, Motor Sport&quot; wrote that Andretti displayed &quot;that same assurance of absolute control [in the corners] one saw in [Jim] Clark&#x27;s driving.&quot;

At the end of the 1968 season, Chapman offered Andretti a full-time drive to replace Clark, who had died in an accident that April. Andretti declined, not wishing to give up his stable USAC career. For the next two years, he made only sporadic appearances in Formula One with Lotus and STP-March. The cars were mostly uncompetitive, and he finished only one race in his first three seasons. At the one race he finished, the 1970 Spanish Grand Prix, he collected his first Formula One podium after several drivers ahead of him retired with mechanical issues.

=== Ferrari (1971–1972) ===
Andretti signed with Scuderia Ferrari in and entered seven out of 11 races, completing two. In his Ferrari debut, he won his maiden Grand Prix at Kyalami after race leader Denny Hulme&#x27;s engine failed with four laps to go. He also won the non-championship Questor Grand Prix in California. Following the Questor win, Enzo Ferrari offered to make Andretti his No. 1 driver for 1972, but Andretti declined, later remarking that &quot;[Formula One] didn&#x27;t pay much back then [...] but I always figured I&#x27;d get another opportunity.&quot; Andretti also raced five times in , but scored no podiums. He did not compete in the season.

=== Parnelli (1974–1976) ===
In the mid-1970s, Andretti encouraged Parnelli, his IndyCar team, to sponsor a Formula One car. To prepare for a Formula One challenge, the team secured funding from Firestone, which agreed to make special tires for the team. In addition to Maurice Philippe, the team hired more Lotus veterans, including Jim Clark&#x27;s old crew chief Dick Scammell and administrator Andrew Ferguson.

Parnelli ran Andretti in the two North American end-of-season races in . He qualified third at the but did not start the race due to a mechanical failure. Parnelli also ran Andretti in the North American Formula 5000 series in 1974 and 1975, both times finishing second to Brian Redman. In each season, Andretti won as many races as Redman, but his results were less consistent.

In 1975, Andretti became a full-time Formula One driver for the first time. He was disappointed by the Parnelli VPJ4, which he felt was derivative of the Lotus 72. More importantly, sponsor Firestone pulled out ahead of the season. The VPJ4 had been designed for Firestone&#x27;s custom tires, and without them, its performance suffered. The car also suffered from frequent brake failures. At the , Andretti qualified fourth and reached first after a multi-car crash on the first lap. However, the crash damaged his suspension, forcing his eventual retirement. He finished third at the non-championship 1975 BRDC International Trophy Race. At the , he was nearly killed when his brakes failed during qualifying, but finished fourth with the team&#x27;s backup car. He finished 14th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, scoring five points.

Parnelli skipped the first race of the 1976 season, so Andretti started the year with Lotus and returned to Parnelli for the next two races. Parnelli pulled out of Formula One after round three when sponsor Viceroy withdrew funding. Andretti only learned of the decision when a reporter asked him about it as the grid lined up to start the race. He later admitted that &quot;I was the only one, really, that wanted [the Formula One team].&quot;

=== Lotus (1976–1980) ===

==== 1976 ====
The day after Andretti learned Parnelli was shutting down, he met Lotus&#x27; Colin Chapman, who told him, &quot;I wish I had a decent car for you.&quot; Andretti took the Lotus job anyway, promising Chapman that &quot;we will make the car better.&quot; He negotiated for number one driver status, mindful of Chapman&#x27;s reputation for giving only one driver the best machinery. With this authority, he borrowed his teammate&#x27;s car when it was faster at a particular circuit, or when his own car was unavailable. 

The Lotus 77 was not competitive, and with five races to go, Andretti had scored just five points, leaving him mired in 13th place. He asked to switch to the next year&#x27;s car in mid-season, but Chapman declined. At the , Andretti scored his first podium since March 1971. He collected three podiums in the final five races and lapped the field in his victory at the season-ending . The late-season flurry of results moved Andretti up to 6th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 22 points.

===== Ground effect revolution =====

Andretti&#x27;s timing was fortuitous, as he rejoined Lotus at the eve of the ground effect revolution. Since mid-1975, Lotus had been trying to shape the car to generate downforce (making the car faster in the corners) without a large rear wing (whose drag would make the car slower on the straights). The Lotus design team added sidepods with vents to take in air, which was then channeled under the floor to facilitate the Venturi effect. The car was effectively sucked towards the ground, allowing it to take corners at unusually high speeds. Andretti, whose STP-March team had experimented with sidepods in 1970, encouraged the team to make the sidepods even bigger.

Andretti, who received praise on several occasions for his technical feedback, took a close interest in developing the car. He knew that Lotus had a reputation for dangerous designs and worked with his mechanics to ensure that Chapman did not do anything &quot;too radical.&quot; Wind tunnel technology was still primitive at the time, but Lotus devised a way to model air flow on track by hiring a photographer to take pictures of wind-sensitive bristles that were mounted on the chassis in tests. While testing the car at Hockenheim, Andretti noticed that the car&#x27;s downforce was much stronger when he drove close to a nearby fence. Chapman added sideskirts to keep the air flowing in one direction.

Andretti also helped the team with his ability to set up a car; one commentator said that &quot;aside from Andretti, only Lauda was known for great technical understanding [...] an increasingly vital quality for racecar drivers as racecars became increasingly sophisticated.&quot; Andretti said that &quot;if people say I&#x27;m overly obsessed with setting up my car, that&#x27;s up to them ... I make tiny adjustments to the car, and I can feel them.&quot; Drawing on his extensive USAC oval racing experience, Andretti optimized his cars for each track by exploiting subtle differences in tire size (&#x27;stagger&#x27;) and suspension set-up (&#x27;cross weighting&#x27;) on each side of the car. Engineer Nigel Bennett recalled that Andretti would request seemingly imperceptible adjustments before the race, such as &quot;Lower the front springs by an eighth of a turn.&quot;

==== 1977: Reliability issues ====

In , the Lotus 78 was one of the fastest cars on the grid, and Andretti won four races, more than any other driver. At Zolder, Andretti took pole by 1.54 seconds, infuriating Chapman, who wanted to hide the car&#x27;s quality from his competitors. 

At round four, Andretti won the United States Grand Prix West. He scored a dominant win at the , but also held his own under close racing, winning the after a dramatic last-lap pass on John Watson. He also won his first after three attempts, an achievement in which he took great pride. Andretti concluded that the Lotus 78 was his favorite Formula One car, even more than the next year&#x27;s title-winning Lotus 79.

Other than the wins, Andretti endured a snakebit season. Lotus had commissioned special engines, which proved to be unreliable, and Andretti suffered engine failures while leading at Spielberg, in second at Silverstone, and battling for third at Zandvoort. His engine also failed at Hockenheim. Lotus&#x27; Peter Wright and Ralph Bellamy felt that if Chapman had settled for a regular Cosworth DFV engine, Lotus would have won the title. For his own part, Andretti rued Chapman&#x27;s tendency to &quot;pull the last litre or two of fuel out of the cars before the race,&quot; noting that he ran out of fuel at three races in 1977 (Kyalami, Anderstorp, and Mosport). Andretti also retired in third at Interlagos with an electrical failure, and crashed at Zolder while fighting for the lead, which he called &quot;one of the biggest mistakes of [his] career.&quot; Ferrari dominated the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 95 (97) points to Lotus&#x27; 62, and Andretti finished third in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 47 points, 25 behind Ferrari&#x27;s Niki Lauda, who skipped the last two races. 

==== 1978: World Champion ====

Andretti won his first and only Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in . Before the season, the team signed Ronnie Peterson and made him the highest-paid driver in Formula One. Although Chapman agreed to pay Andretti the same salary, Andretti felt that he had earned number one driver status given how much time he had invested to develop the car. Enzo Ferrari offered to double Andretti&#x27;s salary, but withdrew the offer after Chapman &quot;raised hell with [Enzo]&quot;. Chapman placated Andretti by offering him a bonus of $10,000 a point. In addition, Chapman promised to impose team orders to give Andretti the lead if Lotus was leading 1–2.

The team stayed with the 78 for the first five races while Chapman perfected the next car. At the season-opening , Andretti took pole and led from start to finish. After five races, he was tied for second place in the standings with 18 points, five adrift of Patrick Depailler.

Lotus unveiled the Lotus 79 at the . The new car included an improved diffuser to facilitate airflow at the back of the car. With plenty of downforce in hand, Lotus ran a small rear wing that increased the car&#x27;s top speed, fixing what Andretti felt was the 78&#x27;s biggest weakness. The 79 did introduce a new weakness, as a design flaw overheated the brake fluid. Andretti&#x27;s smooth driving style suited the car, whose downforce was so great that the chassis might have buckled in the hands of a more choppy driver. At Belgium, Andretti took pole by eight-tenths of a second, led from start to finish, and won by ten seconds.

Andretti dominated the rest of the season, winning five of the next eight races, while teammate Peterson finished second with two wins. Lotus had four 1–2 finishes in 1978, and Andretti won them all, generating speculation that Chapman had ordered Peterson to let Andretti win. Two rounds before Andretti clinched the title, Peterson denied being ordered to let Andretti by at any point, which Andretti repeated after the season. However, Peterson then &quot;ostentatiously&quot; followed Andretti to a 1–2 finish at Zandvoort.

Andretti clinched the championship at the Italian Grand Prix, with two races to go. He did not celebrate, as Peterson had suffered a major crash and died later that night due to complications from leg surgery. Outside the hospital, Andretti laconically said, &quot;Unhappily, motor racing is also this.&quot; In 2018, Andretti said that &quot;I could never truly celebrate and I never will. It was an enormous jolt. You never really totally recover from [it].&quot;

==== 1979–1980 ====
Andretti never won another Grand Prix after 1978. Following the 1978 title season, lead sponsor Imperial Tobacco pulled funding. In , the team rolled out the Lotus 80, whose downforce overwhelmed the car&#x27;s suspension, generating porpoising issues, and whose weak chassis popped out rivets while driving. Andretti scored a podium in the Lotus 80&#x27;s debut at Jarama. His new teammate Carlos Reutemann refused to drive the car at all, and Andretti drove it only three times before returning to the Lotus 79, which was already out of date. Andretti finished 12th in the standings, with 14 points, 6 points behind Reutemann, who left for Williams after the season.

Following the failure of the Lotus 80, Chapman tried to solve the problem by developing the Lotus 88, a complex and innovative carbon-fiber, dual-chassis structure. In theory, one chassis would absorb the porpoising while the other chassis would carry the driver. The team used a transitional car, the Lotus 81, for , while Chapman developed the 88. Lotus replaced Reutemann with two talented teammates, Elio de Angelis and (briefly) Nigel Mansell, but the team was again unsuccessful. Andretti scored only one point all season. Over the course of the season, he lost faith in the developing Lotus 88, declaring that Chapman &quot;got bored and started going crazy with other things that were outside of the rules.&quot; He left Lotus at the end of the season, shortly before Chapman was about to unveil the Lotus 88 for 1981. After his departure, the FIA banned the Lotus 88.

=== Alfa Romeo (1981) ===
For the 1981 season, Andretti had a choice between Alfa Romeo and McLaren. He picked the Italian team due to his friendship with one of their engineers and the higher salary on offer. Before the 1981 season, the FIA outlawed sliding sideskirts, which the Alfa Romeo design team had relied on to generate ground effect. Andretti finished fourth on his debut at the United States Grand Prix West, but the team was otherwise uncompetitive. He finished 17th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 3 points. He left the team after the season, explaining that the new generation of Formula One cars required &quot;toggle switch driving with no need for any kind of delicacy [...] it made leaving Formula One a lot easier than it would have been.&quot;
=== Stand-in appearances (1982) ===
During the season, Andretti briefly raced for both the Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; Championship-winning teams, Williams and Ferrari. Andretti joined Williams for the United States Grand Prix West after Reutemann abruptly quit. He damaged his suspension after contacting a wall and retired. IndyCar commitments prevented him from signing a full-time contract, and Williams&#x27; Keke Rosberg won the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

Andretti then replaced the injured Didier Pironi at Ferrari for the last two races of the season. He took pole and finished third at the . At the season-ending , Andretti&#x27;s final Formula One race, he retired with a suspension failure, but Niki Lauda&#x27;s engine failure clinched the Constructors&#x27; Championship for Ferrari. Andretti agreed to serve as Renault&#x27;s reserve driver for one U.S. race in 1984, but declined to be considered for a reserve role in 1986, effectively ending his Formula One career.

== CART IndyCar career ==

=== Penske (1979–1980) ===
In 1979, a new organization, Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART), set up the IndyCar World Series, which displaced the USAC championship. CART was formed because the larger and more institutional IndyCar teams, like Andretti&#x27;s Penske Racing, wanted the sport to emphasize technical innovation (the costs of which deterred new entrants) and a more structured commercial strategy. After Penske helped start CART, Andretti sporadically competed in CART during the 1979 and 1980 seasons, winning one race at Michigan in 1980.

=== Patrick (1981–1982) ===
Andretti switched to Patrick Racing for the 1981 season. The move reunited him with STP Corporation, the team&#x27;s sponsor, and Jim McGee, Andretti&#x27;s mechanic from DVL and Parnelli. He did not win a race, but recorded five top-five finishes in seven races; the other two results were mechanical DNFs. At the 1981 Indianapolis 500, Andretti was controversially stripped of the win four months after the race. After leaving Alfa Romeo, Andretti joined CART full-time for the 1982 season. He finished third in the season standings, with six podiums in 11 races. As with 1981, all his other results were mechanical DNFs.

=== Newman/Haas (1983–1994) ===
In 1983, Andretti joined the new Newman/Haas Racing team, set up by Carl Haas and actor (and former Can-Am team owner) Paul Newman. The team used cars built by British company Lola, in contrast to the March cars in vogue at the time. The team lured Andretti by promising to run only one car, making him the focus of the team. Andretti spent the rest of his full-time racing career with Newman/Haas.

==== Solo-racer era ====
In 1983, Andretti worked with the team to develop the uncompetitive Lola T700 into a decent car. At round six, he took the team&#x27;s maiden win at Elkhart Lake, and scored another win in Las Vegas. He recorded eight top-five finishes in 13 starts.In 1984, the team commissioned a new chassis, which became the Lola T800. The car was designed by Lotus veteran Nigel Bennett and effectively utilized the ground effect technology that Formula One had just banned in 1982. (Various CART teams had been attempting to develop ground effect cars since 1980 at the latest.) However, the team got off to a mediocre start. Andretti won the season opener at Long Beach, but his Indianapolis 500 race was compromised by electrical issues, and his wheel fell off at the Milwaukee Mile. After four races, he trailed Tom Sneva by 58 points. In mid-season, however, he won five out of eight races, including the Michigan 500, where he beat Sneva by 0.14 seconds, the closest finish in IndyCar history at the time. After a tight, season-long battle, Andretti closed out the season with two conservative second-place drives, explaining that &quot;I hated driving that way but that&#x27;s what I had to do.&quot; He beat Sneva by 13 points to claim his fourth IndyCar title at the age of 44. At the end of the season, he was voted Driver of the Year for a third time.

The team took a step back in 1985. Other teams noticed that in addition to Andretti&#x27;s six wins, Danny Sullivan won three races in a customer T800. To make more money, Newman/Haas agreed to distribute the Lolas to more competitors, watering down its technical advantage. Andretti got out to a fast start, winning three of the first four races and finishing second in the fourth, the 1985 Indianapolis 500. After four races, he had a 34-point lead in the standings. However, he recorded only one more top-five finish the rest of the way, and finished fifth in the standings.

From 1986 to 1988, Andretti&#x27;s son Michael emerged as a force in the sport. In 1986, Michael placed second, beating Mario for the first time. Father and son both scored five poles. At round five in Portland, Mario beat Michael by 0.07 seconds, setting another record for the closest finish in IndyCar history. In addition, at age 46, he finally won his home race, the Pocono 500, after 14 attempts. He called it &quot;one of the happiest weekends [he had] ever had.&quot; He led the championship with ten races to go, but did not pick up another podium the rest of the way.

In 1987, with an Adrian Newey-designed chassis and new engines designed by Ilmor, Andretti picked up eight poles but converted them into two wins. He dominated the Indianapolis 500 but dropped out with a blown engine late in the race. At the following race at Milwaukee, he passed A. J. Foyt for the all-time lead in career laps led. However, he crashed when his rear wing came loose and injured his neck. He called it &quot;the hardest hit I&#x27;ve ever taken.&quot;

In 1988, Andretti finished fifth in the season standings, one spot ahead of Michael. He picked up two wins, but continued to suffer from reliability issues and was involved in several costly accidents.

==== Two-car era ====
Michael Andretti joined Newman/Haas in 1989, which added a second car for the first time to accommodate him. Mario and Michael became the first father/son team to compete in both IMSA GT and IndyCar racing. Michael reached the peak of his career, winning the 1991 championship and finishing second in 1990 and 1992. By contrast, Mario performed well but not brilliantly. During the 63 races from 1989 to 1992, he scored 30 top-five finishes but recorded no wins. In 1992, he set the all-time record for most IndyCar starts, passing A. J. Foyt.

Ahead of the 1993 season, Michael Andretti left CART for Formula One. Mario wanted to return to the old one-car system, but the team replaced Michael with the reigning Formula One champion, Nigel Mansell, and gave Mansell number one driver status. Mansell and Andretti raced as teammates for two years, but did not get along, owing to their mutual competitiveness and personality differences. Andretti scored his last IndyCar win during the 1993 Phoenix race. At 53 years and 34 days old, he became the oldest recorded winner of an IndyCar event. Later that year, he qualified on pole at the Michigan 500 with a speed of , setting a new closed-course world record. He finished sixth in the season standings, while Mansell won the title.

Andretti decided to race one final season, dubbed &quot;The Arrivederci Tour.&quot; In 1994, the team as a whole took a step back, and Newman/Haas went winless for the first time. At his 407th, and final, IndyCar race, at Laguna Seca, Andretti&#x27;s race was initially derailed by a flat tire, but he weaved his way back up to seventh. His engine failed with four laps to go. At the time of his retirement, his 52 wins were the second-most in history, behind only A. J. Foyt&#x27;s 67. (Scott Dixon passed him in 2022.) His 7,595 laps led remain the all-time record, nearly 1,000 laps higher than second-placed Michael Andretti&#x27;s 6,692. His 67 pole positions were the all-time record. (Will Power passed him in 2022.)

=== Indianapolis 500 ===

Andretti won once at the Indianapolis 500 in 29 attempts, despite three pole positions and seven top-three grid placements. He finished all just five times, and quipped that &quot;if it had been the Indy 400, I&#x27;d have had at least six.&quot; He had so many incidents and near victories at the track that critics have suggested the existence of an &quot;Andretti Curse.&quot;

Andretti occasionally did well at Indianapolis. He won the 1969 race, but benefited from good luck: he completed the race in the team&#x27;s backup car, a now-outdated Brawner Hawk, and on just one set of tires. His race engineer said that the Hawk&#x27;s gearbox was failing and would not have lasted another five laps. He was also the first driver to exceed , during practice for the 1977 race. 

Starting in 1981, Andretti encountered several out-of-the-ordinary instances of bad luck at the Indianapolis 500. In 1981, he lost after Bobby Unser passed cars under caution. In 1985, he finished second to Danny Sullivan, who miraculously spun without crashing. In 1987, he led 170 of the first 177 laps but slowed down to preserve his engine, which ironically caused the engine to fail. In 1992, he broke six toes, his son Jeff broke both legs, and his son Michael lost a 28-second lead with 12 laps to go due to a mechanical failure. Finally, in his last serious chance at a win in 1993, he led the most laps, but his race was derailed after the team incorrectly changed the tire stagger on his car during a late pit stop. In addition, in 2003, the 63-year-old Andretti tested the injured Tony Kanaan&#x27;s car at Indianapolis but got into a &quot;spectacular&quot; airborne crash when Kenny Bräck crashed in front of him; he escaped with minor injuries. Reflecting on the curse in 2019, Andretti said that while he &quot;think[s] about all the times [he] should have won here,&quot; he also won in 1969, &quot;when everything went wrong.&quot;

== Sportscar racing career ==

=== North American endurance racing ===
Andretti&#x27;s first race in a sportscar was in 1965, when he piloted a Ferrari 275 P at the Bridgehampton 500 km at Bridgehampton; he did not finish. Andretti won three 12 Hours of Sebring endurance races (1967, 1970, 1972), and a 6-hour race at Daytona in 1972. In early sportscar races he competed for Holman-Moody, but later often drove for Ferrari.

Andretti signed with Ferrari in 1971, and won several races with co-driver Jacky Ickx. In 1972, he shared wins in the three North American rounds of the championship and at Brands Hatch in the UK, helping Ferrari to a dominant victory in that year&#x27;s World Championship for Makes. He also competed in 25 North American Can-Am races in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with a best finish of third place at Riverside in 1969.

=== Le Mans ===
Andretti competed at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in four decades. In 1966, he shared a Holman-Moody Ford Mk II with Lucien Bianchi. They retired due to valve failure. In 1967, during a 3:30 am pit stop, a mechanic accidentally installed a front brake pad backwards, causing Andretti&#x27;s brakes to lock up at the Dunlop Bridge. He crashed, broke several ribs, and was left exposed to oncoming traffic, but Roger McCluskey pulled him to safety.Andretti did not return to Le Mans until ending his full-time Formula One career. In , he partnered with son Michael in a Mirage M12 Ford. They qualified in ninth place, but although their car passed initial inspection several days earlier, it was disqualified shortly before the race started due to an improper oil cooler. They returned the following year and finished third in a Porsche customer car, behind two works Porsches. The Andrettis returned in with Mario&#x27;s nephew John added to the family team. Although they obtained a factory Porsche 962, one of the car&#x27;s engine cylinders failed, and the team finished fifth.

Following Andretti&#x27;s retirement from full-time racing, he decided to try for another Le Mans victory, joining Courage Compétition from 1995 to 1997. In , the team qualified third, but Andretti was brake-checked by the car in front of him and crashed, forcing him to pit and costing the team six laps. The team eventually rallied from 25th to second in the overall classification, and finished first in the LMP1 class. Andretti later said that the team &quot;lost [the 1995] race five times over&quot; through poor organization, including a botched pit stop, an ill-considered switch to wet-weather tires, and a two-minute pit stop to wash the car to clean up the sponsor decals. Porsche withdrew active support from Courage in , and the team finished 16th after losing 90 minutes in the pits fixing an electronic issue and a broken axle. In , the &quot;now ancient Courage&quot; was a backmarker and the team did not finish the race. Andretti&#x27;s final appearance at Le Mans was at the 2000 race, six years after his retirement from full-time racing. The 60-year-old Andretti drove the Panoz LMP-1 Roadster-S to a 15th-place finish.

== Awards and honors ==
=== Legacy ===

Over the course of his long career, Andretti won over 100 races on major circuits, although the exact numbers vary depending on the definition of a major circuit. The International Motorsports Hall of Fame puts the total at either 109 or 111, while Andretti and the Automotive Hall of Fame put the total at 111.

Andretti&#x27;s name has become synonymous with speed in American popular culture. An extremely versatile driver, Andretti stands alone, or close to it, in several lists of drivers to win in multiple categories:

* Only driver to win the Indianapolis 500 (1969), Daytona 500 (1967), and the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship (1978) (as of 2025).
* One of only two drivers (including Dan Gurney) to have won races in Formula One, IndyCar, the World Sportscar Championship, and NASCAR (as of 2019).
* One of only three drivers to have won major races on road courses, paved ovals, and dirt tracks in one season, a feat that he accomplished four times (as of 2007).

With his final IndyCar win in April 1993, Andretti became the first driver to have won IndyCar races in four different decades and the first to win automobile races of any kind in five. As of 2024, Andretti&#x27;s victory at the 1978 Dutch Grand Prix is the most recent Formula One win by an American driver.

=== Awards ===
Andretti was named Driver of the Century by the Associated Press (1999) and RACER magazine (2000). In 1992, he was voted the U.S. Driver of the Quarter Century by a panel of journalists and former U.S. Drivers of the Year. He was named the U.S. Driver of the Year in 1967, 1978, and 1984, and is the only driver to be Driver of the Year in three decades.

Andretti has been inducted into a variety of motorsports hall of fames, including the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2000. Other halls of fame include the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame (1986), the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (1990), the U.S. National Sprint Car Hall of Fame (1996), the Automotive Hall of Fame (2005), the USAC Hall of Fame (2012), the FIA Hall of Fame (2017), and the U.S. National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame (2019).

Various race tracks have named areas after Andretti, including &quot;The Andretti&quot; (the final turn of the Circuit of the Americas), the &quot;Andretti Hairpin&quot; (turn 2 at Laguna Seca), and the &quot;Andretti Road&quot; (the grandstand driveway at Pocono). Indianapolis renamed a portion of a street &quot;Mario Andretti Drive&quot; in 2019 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his 1969 Indianapolis 500 win. Nazareth, Pennsylvania renamed Andretti&#x27;s home street of Market Street to &quot;Victory Lane&quot; after he won the Indianapolis 500. 

In 2003, the Champ Car World Series race at Road America was renamed the &quot;Mario Andretti Grand Prix&quot; after Andretti helped broker a deal to keep it on the CCWS calendar. Andretti has also been honored by the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation (2007) and the Simeone Foundation (2008).

On October 23, 2006, the Italian government made Andretti a &quot;Commendatore&quot; of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (OMRI), the most senior Italian order of merit, in honor of Andretti&#x27;s racing career and commitment to his Italian heritage. In 2008, Andretti was also named the honorary mayor of an association of Italian exiles from Andretti&#x27;s birthplace of Montona. Andretti has also received the Carnegie Corporation&#x27;s Great Immigrants Award (2006, the inaugural class); the Italy–USA Foundation&#x27;s America Award (2015); and honorary citizenship of Lucca, Italy (2016). In 2004, he was the grand marshal of the New York City Columbus Day parade.

== Personal life ==

Andretti lives in Bushkill Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Nazareth, on an estate that he named &quot;Villa Montona&quot; in honor of his birthplace. His late wife Dee Ann (née Hoch) was a native of Nazareth. They met when Dee Ann was teaching Andretti English in 1961. They were married on November 25, 1961, and had three children (Michael, Jeff, and Barbara) and seven grandchildren. Dee Ann died on July 2, 2018, following a heart attack.

=== Andretti racing family ===
Both of Mario Andretti&#x27;s sons, Michael and Jeff, were auto racers. Michael joined CART in 1983 and won the 1991 title; he also finished second on five occasions. He was U.S. Driver of the Year in 1991, and was third on the all-time IndyCar career wins list when he retired. Jeff Andretti competed in CART from 1990 to 1994. Mario&#x27;s nephew John Andretti competed in CART and NASCAR, winning one CART race in 1991 and two NASCAR races in 1997 and 1999. In addition, in 2006, Mario&#x27;s grandson Marco won the Indy Racing League Rookie of the Year award and the Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year Award, as Mario, Michael, and Jeff had done before him.

During the 1991 CART season, the Andrettis became the first family to have four relatives compete in the same series. In addition, the Andrettis have competed as a team in endurance racing. Mario, Michael, and John finished 6th at the 1988 24 Hours of Le Mans. Mario, Michael, and Jeff finished 5th at the 1991 Rolex 24 at Daytona.

=== Business ===

Following his retirement, Andretti has remained active in the racing community. He serves on the board of the Cadillac Formula One team, which will join Formula One in . Since 2012, Andretti has been the official ambassador for the Circuit of the Americas (COTA) and the United States Grand Prix. In the media, Andretti test drives cars for &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; and &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazines and has penned a racing column for the &quot;Indianapolis Star&quot;. He also participated in the 2006 Bullrun Rally from New York to Los Angeles.

Andretti&#x27;s business interests extend beyond racing. When he retired at age 54, his personal fortune was estimated at $100 million. In 1995, Andretti and Joe Antonini saved a struggling Napa Valley vineyard and renamed it the Andretti Winery. Andretti was interviewed about his winemaking activities for the documentary &quot;A State of Vine&quot; (2007). In 1997, he founded Andretti Petroleum, which owns a chain of gasoline stations and car washes in Northern California. He also owns a chain of go-kart tracks. He was the title character of several video games, including &quot;Mario Andretti&#x27;s Racing Challenge&quot; (1991), &quot;Mario Andretti Racing&quot; (1994), and &quot;Andretti Racing&quot; (1996/1997), the latter in association with his sons.

== Film and television appearances ==
Andretti has contributed to several racing films. He features in and partially narrates &quot;The Speed Merchants&quot; (1972), a documentary about the 1972 World Sportscar Championship, in which Andretti&#x27;s Ferrari won the constructors&#x27; championship. He also drove an IndyCar in the IMAX film &quot;Super Speedway&quot; (1996). He also appeared in the documentary &quot;Dust to Glory&quot; (2005), which discusses a race in which he served as grand marshal. In November 2015, he appeared on the first season of TV series &quot;Jay Leno&#x27;s Garage&quot;, driving Leno in multiple fast cars and talking about his racing career.

Andretti has also made cameo or guest appearances in other media, generally associated with racing. Like many other IndyCar drivers, he guested on the television show &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. He cameoed in &quot;Bobby Deerfield&quot; (1977); Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Cars&quot; (2006) (an animated film where he was represented by a sentient version of the Ford Fairlane in which he won the 1967 Daytona 500); and DreamWorks&#x27; &quot;Turbo&quot; (2013) (where he voiced the traffic director at Indianapolis Motor Speedway).

<text>Computational neuroscience (also known as theoretical neuroscience or mathematical neuroscience) is a branch of neuroscience which employs mathematics, computer science, theoretical analysis and abstractions of the brain to understand the principles that govern the development, structure, physiology and cognitive abilities of the nervous system.

Computational neuroscience employs computational simulations to validate and solve mathematical models, and so can be seen as a sub-field of theoretical neuroscience; however, the two fields are often synonymous. The term mathematical neuroscience is also used sometimes, to stress the quantitative nature of the field.

Computational neuroscience focuses on the description of biologically plausible neurons (and neural systems) and their physiology and dynamics, and it is therefore not directly concerned with biologically unrealistic models used in connectionism, control theory, cybernetics, quantitative psychology, machine learning, artificial neural networks, artificial intelligence and computational learning theory;
 although mutual inspiration exists and sometimes there is no strict limit between fields, with model abstraction in computational neuroscience depending on research scope and the granularity at which biological entities are analyzed.

Models in theoretical neuroscience are aimed at capturing the essential features of the biological system at multiple spatial-temporal scales, from membrane currents, and chemical coupling via network oscillations, columnar and topographic architecture, nuclei, all the way up to psychological faculties like memory, learning and behavior. These computational models frame hypotheses that can be directly tested by biological or psychological experiments.

==History==
The term &#x27;computational neuroscience&#x27; was introduced by Eric L. Schwartz, who organized a conference, held in 1985 in Carmel, California, at the request of the Systems Development Foundation to provide a summary of the current status of a field which until that point was referred to by a variety of names, such as neural modeling, brain theory and neural networks. The proceedings of this definitional meeting were published in 1990 as the book &quot;Computational Neuroscience&quot;. The first of the annual open international meetings focused on Computational Neuroscience was organized by James M. Bower and John Miller in San Francisco, California in 1989. The first graduate educational program in computational neuroscience was organized as the Computational and Neural Systems Ph.D. program at the California Institute of Technology in 1985.

The early historical roots of the field can be traced to the work of people including Louis Lapicque, Hodgkin &amp; Huxley, Hubel and Wiesel, and David Marr. Lapicque introduced the integrate and fire model of the neuron in a seminal article published in 1907, a model still popular for artificial neural networks studies because of its simplicity (see a recent review).

About 40 years later, Hodgkin and Huxley developed the voltage clamp and created the first biophysical model of the action potential. Hubel and Wiesel discovered that neurons in the primary visual cortex, the first cortical area to process information coming from the retina, have oriented receptive fields and are organized in columns. David Marr&#x27;s work focused on the interactions between neurons, suggesting computational approaches to the study of how functional groups of neurons within the hippocampus and neocortex interact, store, process, and transmit information. Computational modeling of biophysically realistic neurons and dendrites began with the work of Wilfrid Rall, with the first multicompartmental model using cable theory.

==Major topics==
Research in computational neuroscience can be roughly categorized into several lines of inquiry. Most computational neuroscientists collaborate closely with experimentalists in analyzing novel data and synthesizing new models of biological phenomena.

===Single-neuron modeling===

Even a single neuron has complex biophysical characteristics and can perform computations (e.g.). Hodgkin and Huxley&#x27;s original model only employed two voltage-sensitive currents (Voltage sensitive ion channels are glycoprotein molecules which extend through the lipid bilayer, allowing ions to traverse under certain conditions through the axolemma), the fast-acting sodium and the inward-rectifying potassium. Though successful in predicting the timing and qualitative features of the action potential, it nevertheless failed to predict a number of important features such as adaptation and shunting. Scientists now believe that there are a wide variety of voltage-sensitive currents, and the implications of the differing dynamics, modulations, and sensitivity of these currents is an important topic of computational neuroscience.

The computational functions of complex dendrites are also under intense investigation. There is a large body of literature regarding how different currents interact with geometric properties of neurons.

There are many software packages, such as GENESIS and NEURON, that allow rapid and systematic &quot;in silico&quot; modeling of realistic neurons. Blue Brain, a project founded by Henry Markram from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, aims to construct a biophysically detailed simulation of a cortical column on the Blue Gene supercomputer.

Modeling the richness of biophysical properties on the single-neuron scale can supply mechanisms that serve as the building blocks for network dynamics. However, detailed neuron descriptions are computationally expensive and this computing cost can limit the pursuit of realistic network investigations, where many neurons need to be simulated. As a result, researchers that study large neural circuits typically represent each neuron and synapse with an artificially simple model, ignoring much of the biological detail. Hence there is a drive to produce simplified neuron models that can retain significant biological fidelity at a low computational overhead. Algorithms have been developed to produce faithful, faster running, simplified surrogate neuron models from computationally expensive, detailed neuron models.

=== Modeling Neuron-glia interactions ===
Glial cells participate significantly in the regulation of neuronal activity at both the cellular and the network level. Modeling this interaction allows to clarify the potassium cycle, so important for maintaining homeostasis and to prevent epileptic seizures. Modeling reveals the role of glial protrusions that can penetrate in some cases the synaptic cleft to interfere with the synaptic transmission and thus control synaptic communication.

===Development, axonal patterning, and guidance===
Computational neuroscience aims to address a wide array of questions, including: How do axons and dendrites form during development? How do axons know where to target and how to reach these targets? How do neurons migrate to the proper position in the central and peripheral systems? How do synapses form? We know from molecular biology that distinct parts of the nervous system release distinct chemical cues, from growth factors to hormones that modulate and influence the growth and development of functional connections between neurons.

Theoretical investigations into the formation and patterning of synaptic connection and morphology are still nascent. One hypothesis that has recently garnered some attention is the &quot;minimal wiring hypothesis&quot;, which postulates that the formation of axons and dendrites effectively minimizes resource allocation while maintaining maximal information storage.

===Sensory processing===
Early models on sensory processing understood within a theoretical framework are credited to Horace Barlow. Somewhat similar to the minimal wiring hypothesis described in the preceding section, Barlow understood the processing of the early sensory systems to be a form of efficient coding, where the neurons encoded information which minimized the number of spikes. Experimental and computational work have since supported this hypothesis in one form or another. For the example of visual processing, efficient coding is manifested in the
forms of efficient spatial coding, color coding, temporal/motion coding, stereo coding, and combinations of them.

Further along the visual pathway, even the efficiently coded visual information is too much for the capacity of the information bottleneck, the visual attentional bottleneck. A subsequent theory, V1 Saliency Hypothesis (V1SH), has been developed on exogenous attentional selection of a fraction of visual input for further processing, guided by a bottom-up saliency map in the primary visual cortex.

Current research in sensory processing is divided among a biophysical modeling of different subsystems and a more theoretical modeling of perception. Current models of perception have suggested that the brain performs some form of Bayesian inference and integration of different sensory information in generating our perception of the physical world.

===Motor control===
Many models of the way the brain controls movement have been developed. This includes models of processing in the brain such as the cerebellum&#x27;s role for error correction, skill learning in motor cortex and the basal ganglia, or the control of the vestibulo ocular reflex. This also includes many normative models, such as those of the Bayesian or optimal control flavor which are built on the idea that the brain efficiently solves its problems.

===Memory and synaptic plasticity===

Earlier models of memory are primarily based on the postulates of Hebbian learning. Biologically relevant models such as Hopfield net have been developed to address the properties of associative (also known as &quot;content-addressable&quot;) style of memory that occur in biological systems. These attempts are primarily focusing on the formation of medium- and long-term memory, localizing in the hippocampus. 

One of the major problems in neurophysiological memory is how it is maintained and changed through multiple time scales. Unstable synapses are easy to train but also prone to stochastic disruption. Stable synapses forget less easily, but they are also harder to consolidate. It is likely that computational tools will contribute greatly to our understanding of how synapses function and change in relation to external stimulus in the coming decades.

===Behaviors of networks===
Biological neurons are connected to each other in a complex, recurrent fashion. These connections are, unlike most artificial neural networks, sparse and usually specific. It is not known how information is transmitted through such sparsely connected networks, although specific areas of the brain, such as the visual cortex, are understood in some detail. It is also unknown what the computational functions of these specific connectivity patterns are, if any.

The interactions of neurons in a small network can be often reduced to simple models such as the Ising model. The statistical mechanics of such simple systems are well-characterized theoretically. Some recent evidence suggests that dynamics of arbitrary neuronal networks can be reduced to pairwise interactions. It is not known, however, whether such descriptive dynamics impart any important computational function. With the emergence of two-photon microscopy and calcium imaging, we now have powerful experimental methods with which to test the new theories regarding neuronal networks.

In some cases the complex interactions between &quot;inhibitory&quot; and &quot;excitatory&quot; neurons can be simplified using mean-field theory, which gives rise to the population model of neural networks. While many neurotheorists prefer such models with reduced complexity, others argue that uncovering structural-functional relations depends on including as much neuronal and network structure as possible. Models of this type are typically built in large simulation platforms like GENESIS or NEURON. There have been some attempts to provide unified methods that bridge and integrate these levels of complexity.

===Visual attention, identification, and categorization===
Visual attention can be described as a set of mechanisms that limit some processing to a subset of incoming stimuli. Attentional mechanisms shape what we see and what we can act upon. They allow for concurrent selection of some (preferably, relevant) information and inhibition of other information. In order to have a more concrete specification of the mechanism underlying visual attention and the binding of features, a number of computational models have been proposed aiming to explain psychophysical findings. In general, all models postulate the existence of a saliency or priority map for registering the potentially interesting areas of the retinal input, and a gating mechanism for reducing the amount of incoming visual information, so that the limited computational resources of the brain can handle it.
An example theory that is being extensively tested behaviorally and physiologically is the V1 Saliency Hypothesis that a bottom-up saliency map is created in the primary visual cortex to guide attention exogenously. Computational neuroscience provides a mathematical framework for studying the mechanisms involved in brain function and allows complete simulation and prediction of neuropsychological syndromes.

===Cognition, discrimination, and learning===
Computational modeling of higher cognitive functions has only recently begun. Experimental data comes primarily from single-unit recording in primates. The frontal lobe and parietal lobe function as integrators of information from multiple sensory modalities. There are some tentative ideas regarding how simple mutually inhibitory functional circuits in these areas may carry out biologically relevant computation.

The brain seems to be able to discriminate and adapt particularly well in certain contexts. For instance, human beings seem to have an enormous capacity for memorizing and recognizing faces. One of the key goals of computational neuroscience is to dissect how biological systems carry out these complex computations efficiently and potentially replicate these processes in building intelligent machines.

The brain&#x27;s large-scale organizational principles are illuminated by many fields, including biology, psychology, and clinical practice. Integrative neuroscience attempts to consolidate these observations through unified descriptive models and databases of behavioral measures and recordings. These are the bases for some quantitative modeling of large-scale brain activity.

The Computational Representational Understanding of Mind (CRUM) is another attempt at modeling human cognition through simulated processes like acquired rule-based systems in decision making and the manipulation of visual representations in decision making.

===Consciousness===
One of the ultimate goals of psychology/neuroscience is to be able to explain the everyday experience of conscious life. Francis Crick, Giulio Tononi and Christof Koch made some attempts to formulate consistent frameworks for future work in neural correlates of consciousness (NCC), though much of the work in this field remains speculative.

===Computational clinical neuroscience===
Computational clinical neuroscience is a field that brings together experts in neuroscience, neurology, psychiatry, decision sciences and computational modeling to quantitatively define and investigate problems in neurological and psychiatric diseases, and to train scientists and clinicians that wish to apply these models to diagnosis and treatment.

=== Predictive computational neuroscience ===
Predictive computational neuroscience is a recent field that combines signal processing, neuroscience, clinical data and machine learning to predict the brain during coma or anesthesia. For example, it is possible to anticipate deep brain states using the EEG signal. These states can be used to anticipate hypnotic concentration to administrate to the patient.

===Computational Psychiatry===
Computational psychiatry is a new emerging field that brings together experts in machine learning, neuroscience, neurology, psychiatry, psychology to provide an understanding of psychiatric disorders.

==Technology==

===Neuromorphic computing===

A neuromorphic computer/chip is any device that uses physical artificial neurons (made from silicon) to do computations (See: neuromorphic computing, physical neural network). One of the advantages of using a physical model computer such as this is that it takes the computational load of the processor (in the sense that the structural and some of the functional elements don&#x27;t have to be programmed since they are in hardware). In recent times, neuromorphic technology has been used to build supercomputers which are used in international neuroscience collaborations. Examples include the Human Brain Project SpiNNaker supercomputer and the BrainScaleS computer.
