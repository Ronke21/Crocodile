<text>Mexico is a village located in the town of the same name in Oswego County, New York, United States. The population was 1,624 at the 2010 census. The village is located along New York State routes 3, 69, and 104.

== History ==
The first Mexico (a proposed county), with all the surrounding towns, was originally created from the town of Whitestown, Herkimer County, New York, on April 10, 1792, by the state land commissioner. It was to include present-day Oswego and Jefferson counties. The original organization of the proposed Mexico County and a town of that name was abandoned for a time. In December 1794, George Frederick William Augustus Scriba purchased and patented a large tract of land; subsequently becoming a second Mexico, hence the village and town of Mexico.

George Scriba also later opened roads traveling from Mexico Bay and Mexico Point from what is now Mexico Point State Park to present-day Constantia, as well as a highway to present-day Oswego.

Settlers grew quickly in both the town and village of Mexico. The presence of roads, log cabins, frame houses, and businesses encouraged growth. Mexico&#x27;s early businesses included saw mills, oil-mills, gristmills, asheries, tanneries, blacksmiths, tinsmiths, coopers, cheese plants, cloth-dressings, distilleries, shoe-shops, hotels, general merchandise, and jewelers.

Lewis Miller invented the spring wagon and the high quality of these wagons made them famous all over the county.

Lulu Brown began making pans of baked beans to sell in grocery stores in 1937. They sold so well that her husband Earl and her son Robert E. Brown decided to sell them in Oswego. The business grew and relocated to the second story of the building at the south east corner of South Jefferson and Main Streets. Earl Brown died in 1938 and shortly after Richard G. Whitney joined the firm, forming Brown-Whitney-Brown (BWB). The business has since evolved into the world-famous Grandma Brown&#x27;s Baked Beans.

With growth, disease was prevalent. Between 1812 and 1820 a cholera-like disease spread throughout the region, a fatal form of dysentery, as well as ague and bilious fevers. More than one-half of the settlers died of these scourges during the first 20 years of the settlement.

In 1813 a system of public schools was established with 14 districts. The number increased to 19 by 1895 as new settlements developed. In 1822 a two-story brick school housing grades on the first floor and high school on the second. This was called &quot;the Academy&quot; and was admitted to the state system by the regents in 1833. Mexico was the first school of secondary education to be founded in what is now Oswego County. Mexico was the first school to centralize in Oswego county. This occurred in 1936 when 31 districts in the towns of Mexico, Palermo and New Haven closed to make Mexico Academy and Central School. An elementary school continued in New Haven and Palermo while the rest of the students were bussed to Mexico.

Mexico also played its part in the abolition of slavery. As early as 1835 citizens signed petitions which were sent to Washington requesting the abolishment of slavery. Asa Wing was a prominent speaker who traveled across the state urging voters to pressure their representatives to pass new laws prohibiting ownership of slaves. Starr Clark was leader in the Underground Railroad and was the station master of the area.

The historic core of the village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 as the Mexico Village Historic District. Also listed are the Mexico Octagon Barn, Mexico Railroad Depot, Hamilton Farmstead, Mexico Academy and Central School, Starr Clark Tin Shop, Peter Chandler House, Orson Ames House, Leonard Ames Farmhouse, Leonard Ames Farmhouse, Phineas Davis Farmstead, Thayer Farmstead, and Timothy Skinner House. The Mexico Stone Store was added in 2010.

<text>Mexico is a town in the northeastern section of Oswego County, New York, United States. The population was 5,197 at the 2010 census. The town contains a village also named Mexico.

Mexico has been referred to as the &quot;Mother of Towns&quot;, as the original town as enacted by separate acts of 1792 and 1796 comprised an area that would eventually form six separate counties (Onondaga, Cortland, Oneida, Lewis, Jefferson, and Oswego). These six counties today contain a total of 84 separate towns that were once included in the original Town of Mexico.

NY 69 comes to an end in the village of Mexico, where it intersects with NY 104 (Main Street). U.S. Route 11 also passes through the town.

== History ==

<text>List of ethicists including religious or political figures recognized by those outside their tradition as having made major contributions to ideas about ethics, or raised major controversies by taking strong positions on previously unexplored problems.

All are known for an ethical work or problem, but a few are primarily authors or satirists, or known as a mediator, politician, futurist or scientist, rather than as an ethicist or philosopher. Some controversial figures are included, some of whom you may see as bad examples. A few are included because their names have become synonymous with certain ethical debates, but only if they personally elaborated an ethical theory justifying their actions.

<text>Sandy Creek is a town in Oswego County, New York, United States. The population was 3,939 at the time of the 2010 census. The name is derived from a creek in the area.

The Town of Sandy Creek is in the northwestern part of the county. The village of Sandy Creek is located within the town.

== History ==
Champlain passed through the town in 1615, leading a war party of Hurons and soldiers.

The town was first settled around 1803, near Lacona. Sandy Creek was formed from the Town of Richland in 1825.

In 1835, Sandy Creek resident Thomas Meacham decided to make the world&#x27;s largest cheese as a gift to president Andrew Jackson. His finished product was 4 feet in diameter, 2 feet thick, and weighed nearly 1400 pounds. The cheese was delivered and sat in the White House until February 22, 1836, when the president invited the public to come to the White House and eat the cheese. This event was made famous in an episode of the television show The West Wing.

The Holyoke Cottage was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 46.5 square miles (120.5 km2), of which 42.3 square miles (109.5 km2) is land and 4.3 square miles (11.1 km2) (9.17%) is water.

The village is somewhat off the beaten path (In spite of US Route 20 passing a few miles north), not much visited by tourists; Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg used to visit to escape city life, especially in the autumn when the maple leaves change color. Many people around Cherry Valley are dairy farmers; tapping maple trees for sap, which is then refined into syrup, is a common spring practice. The area looks much like it did in the 19th century. Historic re-enactments are held to commemorate the importance of Cherry Valley during the American Revolution.

Area attractions include the Baseball Hall of Fame, the Bates Hop House, Cherry Valley Museum, Judd Falls, Otsego Lake, and Glimmerglass State Park.
There is an annual Memorial Day celebration which includes a Craft Fair, Bake sale, Flea Market, Chicken BBQ, and parade.

==Historical and cultural significance==

Cherry Valley was the birthplace of John H. Funk (1817-1871), State Assemblyman from New York City in 1857, and his younger sister, Jane (1823-1860), better known as the &quot;notorious&quot; courtesan Fanny White.

Cherry Valley has a long history as an artist and writer&#x27;s community. Willa Cather left New York City for the isolated village in 1911, writing &quot;O Pioneers!&quot; while there. Poet Allen Ginsberg bought a farm there in the 1960s, and the town became a haven and destination point for many of the major personalities of the Beat scene: William Burroughs, Gregory Corso, Peter Orlovsky, Herbert Huncke, Ray Bremser, Anne Waldman, Robert Creeley, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Harry Smith, and many others all spent time either living or visiting there. Poet Charles Plymell still lives in Cherry Valley — he and his wife ran Cherry Valley Editions from their home, publishing small editions of major writers. Jazz pianist Paul Bley is a resident as are Mark Mastroianni and National Book Award nominated novelist Dana Spiotta.

Transgender pioneer, actress and Andy Warhol Superstar Candy Darling is buried in the historic Cherry Valley Cemetery. A significant portion of &quot;Beautiful Darling&quot; (2010), a documentary film about her life, was shot in Cherry Valley. Photographer Ryan McGinley staged several photo shoots in and around the village, and the artist Dash Snow shot &quot;Sisyphus, Sissy Fuss, Silly Puss&quot;, one of his later 8mm pieces, there in late May 2009.

Actress Jill Flint (&quot;Royal Pains&quot; and &quot;The Night Shift&quot;) was born and raised in Cherry Valley. Singer, musician and composer Vanessa Bley (daughter of Paul Bley) was raised in Cherry Valley.

== History ==
The modern history of Cherry Valley begins with John Lindesay receiving a land grant from George II of Great Britain; he moved there in 1739, and seven Anglo-Scottish families from New Hampshire moved into the area the following year. Due to high snow, the community almost failed but was saved by provisions from local natives.

During the American Revolutionary War, Walter Butler, a New York Loyalist, led a mixed force of Indians and Loyalists to the area, resulting in the Cherry Valley Massacre, during which more than 40 people were killed and many were captured. This massacre was followed by a second raid in 1780, leading to the temporary abandonment of the village.

The town was established in 1791 from Canajoharie (in Montgomery County) as one of the original towns in the county. It was subsequently divided, giving rise to several new towns: Middlefield, Springfield, and Worcester (all in 1797) and Roseboom in 1854.

In 1812, the community of Cherry Valley set itself apart by incorporating as a village.

<text>Morris is a village in Otsego County, New York, United States. The population was 583 at the 2010 census. The village is centrally located in the town of Morris, and is northwest of the city of Oneonta.

== History ==

The village was originally called &quot;Louisville&quot; by early French settlers, of whom Andre Renouard and family are the first known, the Franchots staying with them their first winter. When incorporated in 1870, the name was changed to &quot;Morris&quot; so as to avoid confusion with the other Louisville, New York. The water of Butternut Creek was used to power many textile mills in the valley, including the Hargrave factory on Lake St. and Butternuts Wool &amp; Cotton Co. just below the village. Spring Street off West Main was laid out to a new plant that went bankrupt before machinery was installed when the local textile industry collapsed. More recently Spring St. has been abandoned, with Morris Central School expansion over what had once been planned as a development.

<text>Morris is a town located in Otsego County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town had a population of 1,878. The town is named after General Jacob Morris.

Town of Morris is located on the western border of the county. The Village of Morris is located within the town. It is northwest of the City of Oneonta.

== History ==
The town was settled around 1770.

Morris was formed from the Town of Butternuts April 1849. The town was named after General Jacob Morris (the son of Lewis Morris, a signer of the Declaration of Independence), who was granted land due to property lost during the revolution. In 1859, a part of Town of Pittsfield was transferred to Morris.

Some historical data shows population for 2155 of 1850 in 1855 there were 2038, in 1860 pop 2320, in 1865 a total of 2191, in 1870 pop 2253, and in 1875 there were 2303. After this local population declined the textile mills closed, numbers of sheep plummeted, hops began to give way to dairying, and the local bank failed after speculating in silver mines in New Mexico. There were several projected railroad lines through the vicinity since the mid-19th century. The most promising was a Sidney to Utica trolley line sponsored by Silas Kelsey of Burlington. At the same time Dr. Lewis Morris, who owned the Unadilla Valley Railroad, was sponsoring his own railroad extension from New Berlin through Morris to Oneonta where he intended to have an interchange yard with Delaware &amp; Hudson and Ulster &amp; Delaware railroad lines, land which he donated to Oneonta in 1914, as Neahwa Park. Surveys for both routes were completed and staked but not all of the right of ways given, and the trolley line was built over in the Otego Valley instead.

The Morris-Lull Farm, All Saints Chapel and Morris Family Burial Ground, Zion Episcopal Church Complex and Harmony Cemetery, and St. Stephen&#x27;s Chapel (in the hamlet of Maple Grove) are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

From 2006–2021, Morris was the primary filming location for the original screenplay &quot;Portal Master&quot;. The sequel is currently in production.

<text>Oneonta is a town in Otsego County, New York, United States. The population was 5,065 at the 2020 census.,

The Town of Oneonta surrounds the City of Oneonta, which has a population of 13,791. The meaning of the native word &quot;oneonta&quot; is City of the Hills.

== History ==

The town was first settled before the American Revolution by Palatine Germans and Dutch settlers from the Hudson Valley. In 1779, the army of General Clinton passed through the area to join the Sullivan Expedition.

The Town of Oneonta was established in 1830 from parts of the Towns of Otego and Milford.

The community of Oneonta, developed from earlier &quot;McDonaldville&quot; and &quot;Milfordville,&quot; in the town became a railroad center for such lines as the Delaware and Hudson. The world&#x27;s largest locomotive roundhouse stood in Oneonta until a larger one was constructed in Germany. This community set itself off from the town by incorporating as a village in 1848.

The normal school, established in 1889, is now the State University of New York at Oneonta.

The Village of Oneonta became a city in 1908. This small city was an important manufacturing center in the early 20th century.

The Linn Trailer Corp. was built in West End in 1929. Founded by H.H. Linn of nearby Morris, he was replaced in 1937 by Arthur Perkins of the Unadilla Trailer Co. of New Berlin, NY, who obtained several patents of his own relating to trailers and built front wheel drive vans until Great American Industries took over in 1948. Union problems closed their doors in 1952, delaying vital military contracts that Lyncoach Corp. was formed to complete, who later moved into the original Linn building until the 1970s when relocating to a branch factory in Troy, AL.

<text>Unadilla is a village located in the town of Unadilla in Otsego County, New York, United States. The population was 1,128 at the 2010 census. The village is located in the southern part of the town, southwest of Oneonta. The community nickname is, &quot;The Village Beautiful.&quot;

== History ==
The town was originally the site of a Seneca Indian village at the confluence of the Susquehanna and Unadilla Rivers, where the village of Sidney (in Delaware County) is now located. The name Unadilla, which represents one spelling from a number of different interpretations of several Iroquois dialects, is said to mean &quot;Meeting Place&quot;, indicating the place where two rivers meet.

Unadilla was first settled by whites around 1770. The location of the village now called Unadilla was first settled about the same time by a group of Scots-Irish at the junction of the Ouleout Creek and the Susquehanna River. Both villages were destroyed by the Continental Army in October 1778 because they were being used by Loyalists as a base for raiding frontier communities.

Shortly thereafter, Unadilla Village was again settled, and originally called &quot;Wattles Ferry,&quot; It grew after it became an important stop for travel west: the Catskill Turnpike crossed the Susquehanna at Wattles Ferry, located in the eastern end of the village. Eventually, the turnpikes were replaced in importance by the Albany and Susquehanna Railroad (later the Delaware and Hudson Railway). The small community continued to take advantage of this progress and prosper.

Unadilla incorporated as a village in 1827, finally incorporated in 1889.

The village contains many historical homes, some built before the Civil War.

Unadilla&#x27;s Boy Scout Troop #1 was chartered in 1910, and is recognized as the oldest continuously operating troop in the United States.

The Unadilla Village Historic District and Roswell Wright House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>East Greenbush is a town in Rensselaer County, New York, United States. It is a suburb of Albany. The population was 16,748 at the 2020 census. The word Greenbush is derived from the Dutch &quot;het groen bosch,&quot; referring to the pine woods that originally covered the land. The first settlement of the land now known as East Greenbush was made by tenants under patroon Kiliaen van Rensselaer circa 1630. The town was established in 1855 as Clinton, and was renamed in 1858. It is mostly suburban along its major highways and rural in the southwestern and northeastern corners.

Interstate 90 traverses the town. It contains the western (or southern) terminus of US Route 4 and the northern terminus of NY Route 9J; as well as US Route 9 and US Route 20. The latter 
run concurrently, under the name Columbia Turnpike, which is often referred to by the locals as &quot;9 and 20.&quot;

==History==
East Greenbush, at the time part of the Town of Greenbush, was part of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, and then of Albany County, prior to the creation of Rensselaer County in 1791. The town of Clinton was established on February 23, 1855, from the town of Greenbush at the same time as the town of North Greenbush. On April 14, 1858, the town name was changed to East Greenbush by New York State Laws of 1858, Chapter 194.

Early European settlement along the Hudson River shoreline took place &quot;circa&quot; 1628-1629 and in 1669, a fort was built on Papscanee Island. The hamlet of East Greenbush was settled around 1630, with a Dutch Reformed church first built in 1787, and a post office was established in 1845. From the late 18th century until his death in 1834, Prospect Hill on Hays Road in the southern section of the town was home to Edmond-Charles Genêt, former adjutant-general, minister plenipotentiary, and consul-general to the United States representing France; and as an American citizen he was a New York state legislator from Rensselaer County and a major-general in the state militia.

The town&#x27;s main thoroughfares are quite old, starting with the old post roads constructed during the French and Indian Wars by the English. The Boston and Albany Turnpike was constructed in 1800, today known as the Columbia Turnpike designated as US Routes 9 and 20. Another major highway in the town, the Farmer&#x27;s Turnpike, also was built at or before this time; today it is NY Route 9J.

The town saw at least one memorable event during the Anti-Rent War, which was a popular revolt among tenants of the last patroon of Rensselaerswyck over rent payments. A deputy sheriff named Griggs was killed in the line of duty while evicting a man by the name of Witbeck from his farm. The area of East Greenbush behind the Town Hall was the site of a huge cantonment, occupied by over 5,000 soldiers during the War of 1812; this included a hospital, barracks, and an arsenal. Along the Hudson River, near Papscanee Island, in the mid-late 19th century a large farm was occupied by Colonel Kiliaen van Rensselaer, great-grandson of his namesake and first Patroon of Rensselaerswyck, Kiliaen van Rensselaer.

In the late 1980s, the descendants of the original Dutch settlers on Papscanee Island came under pressure from suburban development in the area, and the Open Space Institute purchased large parcels of land and development rights to surrounding areas, creating the Papscanee Preserve. In 1997, the county took charge of management and the park has been developed with informational signs, trails, picnic areas, and a central theme dedicated to the Mohican natives of the areas.

The John Carner Jr. House and Craver Farmstead are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Location==
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 24.4 square miles (63.1 km), of which 24.1 square miles (62.4 km) is land and 0.2 square mile (0.6 km) is water.

The western section of the town, along the Hudson River is marked by bluffs that rise to an elevation of between 100 and 300 feet. The little flat land that exists along the river is on the Papscanee Island. Papscanee Island is actually a peninsula, separated from the rest of the town by the Papscanee Creek. The town then spreads out as rolling hills rising towards the east. Mill Creek (formerly Tierken Kill) and Morden Creek are the principal streams of the town.

East Greenbush is bordered by the town of North Greenbush to the north, the town of Sand Lake to the east, and the town of Schodack to the south. To the west the town borders the city of Rensselaer from the North Greenbush line to the southern tip of the city, then East Greenbush&#x27;s border is with Albany County town of Bethlehem, the border being in the middle of the Hudson River.

<text>Poestenkill is a town in Rensselaer County, New York, United States. The population was 4,322 at the 2020 census. The town is southeast of Troy and is centrally located in the county.

The town is named after the Poesten Kill, an important stream in the area.
The phrase &quot;poesten kil&quot; (with only one &quot;l&quot;) is traditionally said to be Dutch for &quot;foaming water&quot; or &quot;foaming creek&quot;.
While &quot;kil&quot; is, indeed, Dutch for &quot;water&quot; or &quot;creek&quot;, Dutch dictionaries do not support the claim of &quot;poest&quot; meaning &quot;foam&quot;.
It seems more likely that the creek was named after the nickname &quot;Poest&quot; for the 17th-century local farmer and miller Jan Barentsen Wemp, who had a pimple (&quot;poest&quot;) or had difficulty breathing (&quot;poesten&quot; = to breathe); he owned a farm and a mill on the &quot;Poestenkil&quot; creek.

Among the earliest settlers in the town was Archelaus Lynd. He leased 300 acres of land from the Van Rensselaers and made his first clearing in the area of Hillside Cemetery, which was known as The Lynd Cemetery until about 1900. The Whyland and Ives families were other early settlers.

==History==
The area was first settled around 1770, and the town of Poestenkill was created from part of the Town of Sand Lake on March 2, 1848.

When the American Revolutionary War broke out, six men served from the area. One, named Benjamin Cotterel, is said to have carried the first wheelbarrow of earth to Bunker Hill.

The first school in the area was established in or soon after 1788 on land set aside for that purpose by Stephen Van Rensselaer III. Five men from Poestenkill served in the War of 1812, all joining the Eddy expedition.

The first regular church in Poestenkill was the First Baptist church, organized in 1814 and located in East Poestenkill.

During the American Civil War, many of Poestenkill&#x27;s men served with the Union&#x27;s forces; twelve who died in action were Daniel M. Horton, Philip Amidon, Daniel Morrison, John Wagoner, George Bradt, Dexter Randall, William H. H. Wood, Martin Larabee, Willard Bailey, W. L. Robbins, George Simmons, and William H. Mason.

Future president James A. Garfield considered a job as high school principal in Poestenkill in 1856, though lost it to another applicant.

Poestenkill celebrated its sesquicentennial (150th anniversary) in 1998, with several events including a Revolutionary War reenactment, antique car show, a parade, and a historical display. A postcard was also produced for the town at the time.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (0.43%) is water.

The eastern and central portions of the town are part of the Rensselaer Plateau.

The town is serviced in part by Brunswick (Brittonkill) Central School District and by Averill Park Central School District.

<text>Schaghticoke is a village in Rensselaer County, New York, United States. The population was 592 at the 2010 census.

During the colonial period of 1640-1750, this area was occupied by a mixed group of Native Americans — Mohicans, who were local, and remnants of numerous New England tribes who had migrated west away from European encroachment and warfare.

The Village of Schaghticoke is in the Town of Schaghticoke, near the eastern town line. Schaghticoke is west of the Village of Valley Falls.

==History==
In the colonial era, Native Americans at Schaghticoke included a mixed group of Mohicans, and members of several tribes from New England who had migrated away from Anglo-European settlement, including the Abenaki (inc. Sokoki and Pennacook), Cahoo, Wampanoag, Pocumtuc, Narraganset, Nipmuc and others. Their societies had been disrupted due to warfare with the English, such as King Philip&#x27;s War.

This mixed group, which was at times 1000 men strong, were the dominant Native Americans of the area from circa 1640 -1750. While they paid tribute to the Iroquois to the west, they controlled their own territory here. By 1750, the majority of the land had been sold to European settlers. When the last of the Schaghticoke group moved north to escape European encroachment, the Iroquois laid claim to what was left. In 1769 settlers paid 5000 pieces of Spanish Gold for the area of the Kaydeross Patent.

The European Americans named the village &quot;Harts Falls.&quot; It was incorporated under that name in 1867. It was reincorporated under the name of &quot;Schaghticoke&quot; in 1881.

<text>Schaghticoke is a town in Rensselaer County, New York, United States. The population was 7,445 at the 2020 census. It was named for the Schaghticoke, a Native American tribe formed in the seventeenth century from an amalgamation of remnant peoples of eastern New York and New England. The tribe has one of the oldest reservations in the United States, located in what is now Litchfield County, Connecticut. It has been recognized by the state of Connecticut but has not yet achieved federal recognition.

The town is on the northern border of the county, north of Troy. The town contains a village, also called Schaghticoke, and part of the village of Valley Falls.

== History ==
This area was historically occupied by the Mohican tribe, and later by a mixed group of Mohicans, and remnants of numerous New England tribes who had migrated west seeking to escape European encroachment.

In 1675, Governor Andros, governor of the colony of New York, planted a tree of Welfare near the junction of the Hoosic River and Tomhannock Creek, an area already known as Schaghticoke, &quot;the place where the waters mingle.&quot; This tree symbolized the friendship between the English and the Dutch, and the Schaghticoke Indians. The Native Inhabitants were Mohican refugees from New England welcomed to Schaghticoke because they agreed to help protect the English from the French and the Iroquois. They stayed until 1754.

Prior to the proclamation of colonial independence, Schaghticoke was part of the colony of New York with most of its citizens governed by the city of Albany, which owned the land they rented.

Originally, Schaghticoke was a dangerous place to live because they were frequently raided by the Indians and Tories. This led to the slow settlement of the Schaghticoke land. Once the land was fully settled it was a part of Albany County, until 1791 when Rensselaer County was formed.

After the revolution many immigrants came from England and Ireland to settle in Schaghticoke. The town flourished near the water powered mills created in the town on the Hoosic River. The town was mainly agricultural. There were many farmers residing in Schaghticoke who made crops for local industries.

The Knickerbocker Mansion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

As of the early decades of the 21st century, Schaghticoke still has a strong agricultural presence but is also characterized by increasing residential development, and contends with related political, social, and economic issues.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 51.9 square miles (134.3 km2), of which 49.9 square miles (129.3 km2) is land and 2.0 square miles (5.1 km2) (3.76%) is water.

The northern town boundary is the border of Washington County, and the western town line, defined by the Hudson River, is the border of Saratoga County.

The Hoosic River flows through the town to the Hudson River at the western town line.

<text>Haverstraw is a village incorporated in 1854 in the town of Haverstraw in Rockland County, New York, United States. It is located north of Congers, southeast of West Haverstraw, east of Garnerville, northeast of New City, and west of the Hudson River at its widest point. As of the 2020 census, the population was 12,323.

The village of Haverstraw is within the North Rockland Central School District public primary and secondary school system of New York State, and the downtown hosts the Rockland Community College – Haverstraw Extension Center. , the mayor is Michael Kohut.

==History==
===Settlement (1609–1750)===

Before Dutch settlers traveled to the Hudson River Valley in the early part of the seventeenth century, the Rumachenanck people, a subset of the Lenape tribe, called the area home. In 1609, during one of the many voyages the Dutch financed in search of the Northwest Passage, Henry Hudson sailed the Hudson River.

The village is one of the first to appear on maps of North America, listed as &quot;Haverstroo&quot;, which means &quot;oat straw&quot; as an anglicized version of a Dutch word. The area was first referred to as Haverstroo in 1616. From 1686 till 1719, the present town of Haverstraw was included in the laws, taxes and militia duties of Orangetown. But that valley was increasing so rapidly in population, the distance was so great and the trail so poor between it and Tappan, that the inhabitants petitioned for separate existence and on June 24, 1719, the following act was passed: &quot;An Act to enable the Precincts of Haverstraw in the County of Orange, to chuse a Supervisor, a Collector, two Assessors, one Constable, and two Overseers of Highways.&quot;

The village was not incorporated as a municipality until March 11, 1854, as the Village of Warren, after Joseph Warren, a major general who died at the Battle of Breed&#x27;s Hill (a.k.a. Bunker Hill) in 1775 during the Revolutionary War. Haverstraw has a complicated record of names. One Act refers to the Village of Waynesburgh, and will take an extract from this Act, passed April 1, 1814, again: &quot;from thence, in a direct course as nearly as may be, to such a point in the village of Waynesburgh, late Warren, as the Commissioners, etc.&quot; For what reason the name Waynesburgh was given to the hamlet, and the length of time it remained 1883–84, have escaped search, but it is likely that the interim name was in honor of revolutionary General Anthony Wayne. Warren, the hamlet had already been called, and to Warren it was changed again. But this name was never a popular one. People had long been accustomed to blend the name of the township and village in one, and call the latter, Haverstraw. At the establishment of the present Stony Point post office in 1847, it was named North Haverstraw. Commerce was carried on, not with Warren, but Haverstraw, and the name of the village post office was Haverstraw from its organization. Influenced by these and other less important reasons, the residents of the village appealed to the Legislature for relief, and, on April 14, 1874, that body passed the following act:

&quot;SECTION I. The name of the Village of Warren in the County of Rockland, incorporated under the provisions of the Statute of the State of New York, authorizing the incorporation of villages, is hereby changed to &#x27;Haverstraw.&#x27; All proceedings now pending by or against the said Village of Warren shall be continued in the name of Haverstraw.&quot;

This village did not begin its growth as early as either Ramapo or Nyack, but for many years, until the discovery of James Wood revolutionized brick making, remained a country hamlet. In 1855, Jacob Wan-dell wrote in a letter to his sister Catherine Van Houten, the following description of the present village, at the close of the last century: &quot;My father removed from Tappan Sloat to Haverstraw in the year 1794. There was no village there then, only one house. Captain Shepherd bought the field where the village is built, of Joseph Allison, for £10 ($25), an acre. When he moved there, it was sown with rye. The river bank was the handsomest I ever saw. From Grassy Point down to where James Wood first set a brick- yard, (this was on the river bank directly opposite the burying ground of the De Noyelles family), was a beautiful row of large chestnuts and oak trees, growing all along the banks. It was a beautiful walk.&quot;

===American Revolution (1775–1783)===

Strategically located on the Hudson River, the village was home to a number of skirmishes between the British Army and the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.

The peak of High Tor Mountain on the Long Path hosted Continental Army watchfires to communicate between troops installments up and down the Hudson River. Today, watchfires are an annual Memorial Day tradition in Haverstraw. Watchfires are lit at midnight on May 30 and burn for 24 hours.

Haverstraw was the site of the most grievous treason of the early years of the United States. During the night of September 21–22, 1780, the English emissary, Major John André, was rowed from the sloop-of-war &quot;Vulture&quot; to a beach below the Long Cove on the southern boundary of Haverstraw. The negotiations to sell the plans to West Point were not completed by dawn, and Benedict Arnold and André traveled to the Belmont House, owned by Thomas Smith and occupied by his brother Joshua Hett Smith, on the grounds of what is now Helen Hayes Hospital in West Haverstraw. The house has since been known as the Treason House.

===95th New York Volunteer Infantry===
The 95th New York Volunteer Infantry fought in the American Civil War under the command of Ulysses S. Grant, Major General James Samuel Wadsworth and Brigadier General Edmund Rice. Company F was recruited primarily from Haverstraw. The infantry joined in the action of the Railroad Cut on the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg. They fought many battles, including the Battle of Mine Run, Grant&#x27;s Overland Campaign, the Battle of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, North Anna, Cold Harbor and the Siege of Petersburg. They saw the war to the end, including engagements in the Battle of the Weldon Railroad, the Battle of Hatcher&#x27;s Run, and the Appomattox Campaign.

===Brick-making capital of the world===
Commonly referred to as &quot;Bricktown&quot;, Haverstraw was famous for its brick-making, which was a major industry for the village. Brick-making was so popular due to the clay formed by the Hudson River&#x27;s water and the rich soil that lined Haverstraw&#x27;s waterfront, that it was nicknamed the &quot;brickmaking capital of the world&quot;. Many of the old brownstone and brick structures that were constructed in New York City in the late 1890s-early 1900s were composed of bricks manufactured by Haverstraw. In the early 20th century, there were more than 40 brick-making factories lining the Hudson River within the village. Although brick-making involved all ethnic groups, 60 percent of the brickyard workers were African-Americans.

===Brick manufacturers circa 1910===
This is a list of suppliers of bricks to New York City metropolitan areas in 1910 with the numbers of machines each manufacturer used, as listed in &quot;Within These Gates&quot; by Daniel deNoyelles:
===Other history===

The brick industry continued to thrive until World War II, when brick began to lose its value significantly. Shortly after, the village&#x27;s main industry of brickmaking declined and left the village. The economic vitality of the village greatly decreased. Because of the amount of vacancies and the relatively inexpensive housing available, the village opened up to Hispanic migration, and the village has become home to many Hispanic immigrant families since the 1950s. Many families of Hispanic descent take part in the village&#x27;s annual festivals. The Puerto Rican Day Parade and Festival take place in the village&#x27;s downtown in early June, and the Dominican Day Parade and Festival occur in late August and in September.

 On the night of January 8, 1906, a landslide destroyed a large residential and commercial portion of the village. Firefighters responded immediately but faced enormous odds because of burst valves and water mains, natural gas explosions and hoses which periodically froze because of the extreme cold. The landslide, a pit about deep, claimed five Haverstraw blocks from Allison to Jefferson Street, 21 buildings, and the lives of 4 firefighters and 17 residents. Despite the events, the village rebounded. Eight years later, however, the Cleary-Newman murder took place, which cast a pall of corruption over the populace. In 2007, leaders of the village and town announced the 101st anniversary of the landslide and dedicated a memorial to the victims of the disaster. The memorial is located at Bowline Town Park on the shore of Bowline Pond and the Hudson River.

In July 1920, New York Yankees outfielder Babe Ruth spent time in Haverstraw to film a movie – &quot;Headin&#x27; Home&quot;. A local baseball field bears the Hall of Famer&#x27;s name due to his visit.


George M. Cohan, the &quot;Father of Modern Broadway&quot;, had his debut playing the violin at the Waldron&#x27;s Opera House on Broadway in the village. The Cohan family stayed in Haverstraw during summer while making their rounds on the vaudeville circuit. The Cohans lived on Division Street, next to a major clay pit in the Village. Cohan was influenced early in his life by the songs of the southern black clay diggers that worked down below the Cohan house in the clay pit. It is often said that Cohan mainstreamed ragtime and jazz through his Broadway tunes.

September 2004 marked the village&#x27;s 150th anniversary, celebrated by a festival along the village&#x27;s waterfront. The village has entered a period of revitalization, which coincides with the creation of the Harbors at Haverstraw Community and a sculpture trail which will follow the Hudson River shoreline. The Harbors at Haverstraw is situated on the southern end of the Village and below the higher elevations of the charming riverside southernmost neighborhood known as Dutchtown. Some residents have taken to calling the Harbors area the &quot;South End&quot; instead of the previous name for the neighborhood the &quot;mud hole&quot; in honor of various clay pits once visible here. The State has funded $3 million to the revitalization project, which includes investments on the waterfront esplanade and a possible downtown streetscape project.

As a cost-saving measure, at midnight on January 1, 2006, the Village of Haverstraw Police Department was merged with the Town of Haverstraw Police Department. The town of Clarkstown Police opened a new shooting range that the town of Haverstraw and other departments use at Tilcon Quarry area.

In April 2012, the Village of Haverstraw passed the first ban on tobacco product display in the United States, though the New York Association of Convenience Stores and seven tobacco companies (Lorillard Tobacco Company, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Philip Morris USA, Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, American Snuff Company, U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company, and John Middleton Co.) sued to stop the ban in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in June of that year.

<text>Haverstraw is a town in Rockland County, New York, United States, located north of the Town of Clarkstown and the Town of Ramapo; east of Orange County; south of the Town of Stony Point; and west of the Hudson River. The town runs from the west to the east border of the county in its northern section. The population was 39,087 at the 2020 census.

The name comes from the Dutch word &quot;Haverstroo&quot; meaning &quot;oats straw&quot;, referring to the grasslands along the river. The town contains three villages, one of which is also known as Haverstraw. Haverstraw village is the original seat of government for the town, hosting the area&#x27;s historic central downtown business district and the densest population in northern Rockland County.

==History==
In 1609, the region was explored by Henry Hudson. A land purchase was made in this town in 1666 from local natives and confirmed as a patent in 1671. The region was known as &quot;Haverstroo&quot;, meaning &quot;oat straw&quot; in Dutch.

During the American Revolution, it served (under the command of Col. Ann Hawkes Hay) as an important lookout for British activities on the Hudson.

==Education==

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York operates Catholic schools in Rockland County. St. Peter Parish School was in Haverstraw. In 2012, after the archdiocese announced that it could potentially be closed, the school community did a fundraising drive as the school was told it could remain open if a plan to raise $500,000 annually was produced. That year the school&#x27;s per-student cost was $5,500 but it relied on archdiocese funds as it deliberately had tuition below cost, at $3,600, so children of working class backgrounds could attend. It had an increasing enrollment at the time of closure, with 328 students in its final year.

<text>Stony Point is a town in Rockland County, New York, United States. It is part of the New York City Metropolitan Area. The town is located north of the town of Haverstraw, east and south of Orange County, and west of the Hudson River and Westchester County. The population was 14,813 at the 2020 census. The name of the town is derived from a prominent projection into the Hudson River.

The town is in the northeastern part of the county. U.S. Route 9W, U.S. Route 202, and the Palisades Interstate Parkway are major north–south routes through the town. Stony Point is included in the North Rockland Central School District. It is the most rural of the five towns in Rockland County.

== History ==

During the American Revolution, the King&#x27;s Ferry in Stony Point linked New York and the southern colonies with New England; it was used many times by General George Washington&#x27;s Continental Army, and in 1781 Washington&#x27;s French allies used it on their way to the Battle of Yorktown.

The economy of the town improved upon the rediscovery of limestone deposits in the 19th century. The town of Stony Point was founded in 1865 from the northern part of the town of Haverstraw.

=== Battle of Stony Point ===
During the American Revolution, defending the area of Stony Point was crucial. Even George Washington himself prioritized keeping Stony Point, along with the areas around it safe. The importance of controlling that area was crucial to the control of West Point, which is why Washington found taking back the area so important. Washington assigned Major Henry Lee and General Anthony Wayne as the men in charge, and knew the importance of controlling the area.

Having control of Stony Point would enable Washington to have the most effective line of communication between certain colonies. The geography of the town attributed into the advantages the area had to offer. For example, the rockiness and woods made it a good place to keep watch over the Hudson River. General Wayne planned his attack accordingly, and executed the attack effectively.

Stony Point was controlled by British troops, but Washington wanted control to help take down their strong naval forces. By taking control, the Americans would gain an advantage over the British for the remainder of the war. Although it wasn&#x27;t a definitive battle, it still played a major role in the outcome of the American Revolution.

During the Battle of Stony Point, there were many different sources of weaponry. One of the main ones used was a bayonet. The British soldiers relied heavily on the sword on the end of their rifles, simply because it was more effective during the battle. Although it might seem ironic that a sword can out do a firearm, but the bayonets were extremely effective if soldiers were trained to use it. Also, the rifles at the time of the battle had flaws, such as it being too light. General Wayne took note of this, and advised his side to stay away from the use of rifles. He encouraged the use of muskets and bayonets for the same reasoning.

A possible contribution to the American cause in connection with the Battle of Stony Point was by an African-American slave named &#x27;Pompey.&#x27; According to later writings by historian Benson Lossing and later repeated by others, Pompey realized the willingness of the American troops to go the extra mile for victory, which is why he offered to help. His duties were said to include selling and delivering food to the British, especially strawberries. He is said to have frequently spoken with British troops. After acquiring information from them, including the countersign to gain entry to the fort at night, he brought it to the American troops. This enabled General Wayne to attack the British in a night attack where they least expected it at Stony Point. Michael J. F. Sheehan, Senior Historian at the Stony Point Battlefield State Historic Site wrote that Pompey likely was a real person but this story of his contribution to the Patriot cause is a myth.

<text>Corinth is a town in Saratoga County, New York, United States. The population was 6,500 at the 2020 census. The town contains a village also named Corinth. The town is on the northeastern border of the county, north of Saratoga Springs. The town is noted as &quot;the snowshoe capital of the world&quot; and is home to Palmer Falls where the Hudson River passes through the Palmertown Range.

== History ==
Palmer Falls is an area of whitewater waterfalls formerly known as &quot;Kah-che-bon-cook&quot;, &quot;Hadley Falls&quot;, &quot;The Great Falls of the Hudson&quot;, or &quot;Palmer&#x27;s Great Falls&quot;. The falls are now named after Beriah Palmer, who at one time owned land along both sides of the river by the falls.

Around 1763, after the French and Indian War, Ebenezer Jessup and his brother Edward from Luzerne began lumbering operations in the area. They floated rafts of logs down the Hudson and bypassed Palmer Falls by landing the rafts at a place called &quot;Jessup&#x27;s Landing&quot;, now the public beach of the Village of Corinth, where they loaded the logs onto wagons and carted them around the falls. 

During the American Revolution the Jessups sided with the Loyalists and fled to Canada, where they commanded a unit known as &quot;Jessup&#x27;s Loyal Rangers&quot;. For a long time the area was known as Jessup&#x27;s Landing. The first permanent settlement in this area was around 1777, when Joseph Eggleston moved from Wilton to escape British raiders. John W. Taylor moved from Charlton to Jessup&#x27;s Landing around 1808 and helped organize the Town of Corinth in 1818.

Around 1790 Ambrose Clothier moved from Connecticut and built a cabin near Lake Bonita on Mount McGregor. He had three sons and three daughters, and all his sons were noted fiddlers. The area around Beaver Brook near the Hudson is today known as &quot;Clothier Hollow&quot;.Other early settlers in this area were Benjamin Ide, Jonathan Hodges, William Grippen, Lawrence Barber, Jonathan Barrass, and Hathaway Randall.

A third area of settlement was South Corinth (originally Chapman&#x27;s Corners) along the Kayaderosseras Creek near the border with Greenfield. This area was settled around 1788 by Adam Comstock from Warwick, Rhode Island, who served in the New York State Assembly from 1792 to 1840, and the New York State Senate from 1805 to 1808. Other early settlers were Benjamin Carpenter, Nathaniel Edwards, Frederick Parkman, Jeremiah Eddy, John Purqua, and Washington Chapman.

The town was formed in 1818 from the town of Hadley. The first business was to decide on a name. Mrs. Washington Chapman was allowed to choose the name. She opened her bible randomly to the Epistle to the Corinthians, so the town became Corinth.

Lumbering was important to the early town, which had more than thirty sawmills. After the American Civil War, many paper mills opened in the town.

In 1888, the hamlet of Corinth incorporated as a village. L.R. Burleigh published a perspective map of Corinth and Palmer Falls in 1888 along with an identifying list of landmarks.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 58.1 square miles (150.6 km2), of which 56.8 square miles (147.1 km2) is land and 1.3 square miles (3.4 km2) (2.29%) is water.

The eastern town line, formed by the Hudson River, is the border of Warren County. The western part of the town is in the Adirondack Park.

==Transportation==
New York State Route 9N is a north-south highway.

The Saratoga and North Creek Railway used to stop in Corinth once daily northbound and southbound on Saturday and Sunday in May and June, and Friday through Tuesday in July through October. The branch line shut down in 2002 along with the paper mill&#x27;s closure.

==Industry==
As early as 1804, a sawmill was established on the Hudson at Palmer Falls, followed shortly by a gristmill and a woolen factory. In 1869, the Hudson River Pulp &amp; Paper Company established its mill and in 1870 began to produce paper from the pulp. This &quot;Hudson River Mill&quot; became the flagship of the International Paper Company at its founding in 1898, and at times had over 1500 employees. The mill specialized in the production of coated paper until its closure in 2002. A shirt factory was established in Corinth in the 1890s and was purchased by Cluett Peabody &amp; Company in 1899. The factory closed in 1975. The Elixman Paper Core Company operated in the village from 1913 until its closure in 1976. Other industries included a sawmill and excelsior plant, a chair factory, and a sand, crushed-stone, and gravel operation.

In 1805, Washington Chapman built a woolen mill in South Corinth, which was later converted to producing nuts and bolts. The hamlet was the site of a tannery, built in 1855 which, by the 1870s, processed five thousand hides a year. Two sawmills nearby produced two thousand cords of hemlock bark and two million feet of lumber annually.

<doc id="260017" wikidata="Q3461944" url="?curid=260017" title="Milton, Saratoga County, New York">
<text>Milton is a town in Saratoga County, New York, United States. The population was 18,800 at the 2020 census. Some believe that the town was named after the poet, John Milton, while other sources state that it is a shortening of &quot;Mill-town&quot; for the early mill activity.

Milton is an interior town in the central part of the county. It is southwest of Saratoga Springs.

== History ==
This region was part of the Kayaderossera patent of 1708. The town was first settled around 1772.

The town of Milton was established in 1792 from part of the town of Ballston. In 1793, part of the town was taken to form part of the town of Greenfield.

In 1807, part of Milton was lost when Ballston Spa became an incorporated village.

In the mid-to-late-19th century, the Town of Milton was the site of numerous manufacturing concerns. The most famous was the paper mills of &quot;Paper Bag King&quot; George West, who invented a line of square-bottomed paper bags and sold them by the millions soon after the American Civil War. There were also the celebrated hard edge tool factories of Isaiah Blood, the large planing, sash, and door mill of Benjamin Barber, the National Folding Box paper mill, and the Cottrell Paper Mill, the only manufacturer that still operates today. All of these mills were water-powered, and therefore succumbed to competition from electric-powered factories in the early 20th century.

Milton had its very own terminal trolley railroad line early in the 20th century. Called the Ballston Terminal Railroad, it spanned from Ballston Spa to Rock City Falls and Middle Grove. It was one of the few trolley railroads in the country to serve primarily industry rather than carry passengers. The trolley operated from 1898 to 1929.

The Kesselring Site for Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program was established in 1948 in West Milton.

As of 2022, Milton was home to the most manufactured home parks in the county.

Kayaderosseras Creek flows through the eastern part of Milton.

<text>Stillwater is a town in Saratoga County, New York, United States, with a population of 9,022 at the 2020 census. The town contains a village called Stillwater. The town is at the eastern border of the county, southeast of Saratoga Springs and borders both Rensselaer and Washington counties. Saratoga National Historical Park is located within the town&#x27;s limits. There is a hamlet in Minerva, Essex County, New York, with the same name which has nothing to do with this town.

==History==

The area was occupied by Iroquois and Mahican natives when the colonial period began. In 1709, Peter Schuyler built Fort Ingoldsby in town because of its location on the frontier of the French and Indian Wars. A replica of Schuyler&#x27;s fort currently serves as the Stillwater Blockhouse Museum. Settlers began arriving after 1730. During the American Revolution residents participated in the war, and part of the Battle of Saratoga was fought in the town so that the town now refers to itself as the turning point of the American Revolution.

Stillwater was established as a town in 1791, when Saratoga County was formed. In 1816, the hamlet of Stillwater incorporated as a village. In 1859, Mechanicville became the town&#x27;s second village. The Stillwater Free Library was established in 1949 by Barbara Alexik and Elizabeth Beiter in the building formerly home to the St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church. The Stillwater United Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

The eastern town line is the border of Rensselaer County and Washington County, marked by the Hudson River.

U.S. Route 4, partly conjoined with New York State Route 32 follows the Hudson River through the town. New York State Route 423 is an east-west highway in the northern part of Stillwater.

<doc id="260020" wikidata="Q3461408" url="?curid=260020" title="Waterford (village), New York">
<text>Waterford is a village in Saratoga County, New York, United States. The population was 2,038 at the 2020 census. The name derives from the ford between the mainland and Peebles Island.

The Village of Waterford is located in the southeastern part of the Town of Waterford, north-northwest of Troy, New York. The village is located just north of the falls where the eastbound Mohawk River empties into the southbound Hudson River.

== History ==
The site of the village was occupied as &quot;Half Moon Point&quot; in the 17th century. It was then in the territory of Mahican natives. This early village was at the ford between Peebles Island and the mainland. The approximate location of this ford is in the area of the Second Street Bridge. Though the construction of the Erie Canal destroyed much of the ford for which the village is named, remnants of an unnamed and often submerged island can still be seen southwest of the entrance to the canal.

The village claims to be the oldest continuously incorporated village in the US. It was the first village incorporated by the state legislature in 1794, while part of the Town of Halfmoon, and was an established political entity before the formation of the Town of Waterford. Waterford Village is one of only twelve villages in New York still incorporated under a charter, the other villages having incorporated or re-incorporated under the provisions of Village Law.

==Geography==
The Village of Waterford is located at (42.791127, -73.679758).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 0.4 square mile (0.9 km2), of which 0.3 square mile (0.8 km2) is land and 0.1 square mile (0.2 km2) (22.22%) is water.

Waterford is on the west bank of the Hudson River and north of Peebles Island State Park. The village was at the northern extreme of navigation on the Hudson River, and later became the eastern terminus of the Erie Canal and the southern terminus of the Champlain Canal. Although the north–south right-of-way of the Champlain Canal through Waterford has largely been abandoned and bypassed, the east-west Erie Canal continues to operate under the administration of the New York State Canal System (formerly called the New York State Barge Canal).

The historic Waterford Flight, comprising locks 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the Erie Canal is located here, along with defunct former locks of the Champlain Canal. The Waterford Flight locks were opened &quot;circa&quot; 1918 to replace earlier locks that had first allowed boat traffic to bypass nearby Cohoes Falls, which had previously blocked all river traffic between the Mohawk and the Hudson Rivers. The Waterford Flight series of locks is one of the steepest in the world.

While much of the surrounding town has a high elevation, the Village of Waterford is very low relative to the two major rivers forming its borders. Its position at the convergence of both the Erie and Champlain Canals as well as the Mohawk and Hudson Rivers, has contributed to many floods. While major floods have been rare through the last half of the 20th century to the present, the most recent flood of significance was in late June and early July 2006. The flood forced the closing of the Erie Canal, stranding several boats in the locks.

Entering from the north, conjoined U.S. Route 4 and New York State Route 32 diverge in Waterford Village, with US-4 (as Broad Street) crossing the Hudson River eastbound into Rensselaer County and NY-32 crossing the Mohawk River southbound into Albany County. County Roads 96 (6th Street) and 97 (Washington Avenue) lead into the village from the northwest.

<text>Waterford is a town in Saratoga County, New York, United States. The population was 8,208 at the 2020 census. The name of the town is derived from its principal village, also called Waterford. The town is located in the southeast corner of Saratoga County and north-northwest of Troy at the junction of the Erie Canal and the Hudson River.

== History ==

The village of Waterford is the oldest incorporated village in the United States, having been incorporated in 1794 before the town was formed. Waterford has been host to &quot;Canal Fest&quot; and &quot;Tugboat Roundup&quot; celebrations for many years.

The town of Waterford was formed from the town of Halfmoon in 1816.
===Industrial revolution===
During the industrial revolution, Waterford became a desirable location for manufacturing due to its position at the confluence of the Hudson River and Mohawk River, as well as the Champlain Canal and Erie Canal and three railroad lines. Fortunes were made here by industrialists such as the brothers Hugh and Canvas White, the Knickerbocker, Kavanaugh, Button, Breslin, and King families. The Eddy family was a major influence on the area; Isaac Newton Eddy established the Franklin Ink Works, manufacturer of printing inks, in 1831. His son George Washington Eddy established the Hudson and Mohawk Foundry, which produced stoves, iron castings, and steam car wheels. Another son Oliver Tarbell Eddy was a painter and inventor of an early typewriter. 

The Northside Historic District, Ormsby-Laughlin Textile Companies Mill, Peebles (Peobles) Island, and Waterford Village Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
The Village of Waterford is located at , in the southeastern corner of the Town.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 7.4 square miles (19.2 km2), of which 6.6 square miles (17.0 km2) is land and 0.9 square mile (2.2 km2) (11.59%) is water.

The eastern town line, defined by the Hudson River, is the border with Rensselaer County, and the southern town line, defined by the Mohawk River, is the border with Albany County. The easternmost section and locks of the Erie Canal pass through the town and connect with the Hudson River. The Waterford Flight series of locks is one of the steepest in the world.

==Demographics==

As of the 2010 census, there were 8,423 residents of the Town of Waterford. The racial makeup of the town was 94.8% White, 1.3% African-American, 0.1% Native American, and 1.5% Asian; in addition, 1.8% of residents were Hispanic or Latino.

<text>Duanesburg is a town in Schenectady County, New York, United States. The population was 5,863 at the 2020 census. Duanesburg is named for James Duane, who held most of it as an original land grant. The town is in the western part of the county.

==History==
Originally known as Duanes&#x27; Bush, Duanesburg was established as a township by patent on March 13, 1765. According to &quot;Documentary History of New York&quot; Vol. lV, pg. 1067, &quot;Mr. Duane entered in March, 1765 into contract with a company of twenty Germans from Pennsylvania of whom about sixteen (families) came on tract, and they made the first permanent settlement in that now flourishing town&quot;. The township was combined with Schoharie, New York, as the United Districts of Schoharie and Duanesburg on March 24, 1772, which became the town of Schoharie in 1788. Duanesburg became its own town once again in 1789.

The town&#x27;s earliest settlers chiefly comprised English Quakers from Dutchess County, New York, as well as a group of settlers who were originally from the town of Kent, Connecticut.
The village of Delanson within the town of Duanesburg was an important stop for the Delaware and Hudson Railroad. Major freight traffic carried Pennsylvania coal northeast through Duanesburg and on to Albany, Boston, and other major eastern cities. In the flat-bottomed valley east of the village of Delanson were huge coal storage piles over high. The village of Delanson had a rough reputation at the time, catering to &quot;rowdy&quot; railroad men. Many densely packed wooden shops lined the village street on the north and south sides of the tracks. Most of the rest of the town of Duanesburg was dairy farms. Pine Grove Farms was the most notable dairy farm.

In the late 20th century farming fell into decline, and the town became a home for commuters working in Albany and Schenectady. Many of the &quot;great&quot; farm families of Duanesburg (the Liddles, Gages, and others) saw their farms shut down and children move on. Most of the farms were subdivided into smaller parcels in the 1970-2000 period. The disappearance of open land was most apparent from 1975 to 1989. Commuters built homes with average lot sizes of 2+ acres. This zone beyond suburbia is termed &quot;exurbia&quot;. Most commuters in Duanesburg travel from each way. Interstate 88 has made the commute east significantly easier since its completion in the early 1980s. General Electric provided a stable and lucrative income for many non-agricultural residents who built homes in the town during this time.

==Economy==

Since 2000 a number of factors has contributed to an economic slowdown in the town. Regional economic prosperity shifted north of Albany (a difficult commute from Duanesburg). An aging population with no available low-cost housing for young people makes it hard for the young to stay. Housing stock is mostly limited to single family homes and antiquated multi-unit properties. Lack of available water for some commercial/industrial uses has limited this type of growth. Despite this, the town government has support the birth and growth of the first Winery in Duanesburg, Helderberg Meadworks, which began selling their mead in October 2012 through local wine stores and as of June 2014 has expanded to statewide distribution.

Due to a lack of diversity in revenue (lack of commercial and industrial presence), individual property taxes may be higher than those of the surrounding area. The town&#x27;s small population&#x27;s desire to maintain a school district, two water districts, 46 miles of town owned-roads and other services have required that taxes be collected, but the town and school boards have attempted to contain costs as much as possible.

The town has been known for its many private airports. Skydiving is one activity that has brought in visitors for the last 30 years. Jonathan&#x27;s Restaurant is located next to one of the airports. During the late 1990s Harrison Ford used to be a repeat visitor at the restaurant during rest stops at the local airport while en route to other destinations. Knox Airport (private), located the neighboring town of Knox, in Albany County, was involved in a large drug investigation. There have been numerous small airplane crashes over the last couple decades, and at least one suicide/fatality from skydiving.

In addition to skydiving, the town is known for cross-country skiing. Beardsford Farms and Oak Hill provided miles of trails on hundreds of acres. Both areas are now closed. The town continues to provide an extensive network of ATV trails through picturesque woods and rural land, most of which is private. Snowmobiling is popular during the winter; residents use the same ATV trails to access other trail networks in Albany, Schoharie, and Montgomery counties.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.74%, is water.

The town consists of mostly wooded hills up to an elevation of approximately above sea level. Most of the town was cleared farmland until the late 20th century. After this point forests grew to cover 60% of the total land area with a canopy higher than . The forest is primary composed of poplar, hemlock, oak, maple, white pine, and balsam fir. The maximum tree heights in Duanesburg are approximately high.

The town is the source of the Normans Kill and of Bozenkill Creek. These creeks drop over a series of rapids and waterfalls cut through shale and sandstone rock beds. Christman&#x27;s Sanctuary highlights some of this topography.
Most of the soil contains clay, significant loose rock, and/or shallow depth, therefore making it inadequate for a large farming industry. There is a significant amount of swamps at high and low elevations in the town due to clay soil and past glacial activity.

The town is unique for its east-west oriented drumlins formed during the last ice age. Most drumlins (oblong hills of glacial sediment) in New York State are north-south oriented.

Due to its higher elevation and position, Duanesburg provides a view that extends as far as southern Vermont, the Adirondack Mountains, and the Catskill Mountains.

US 20, NY 7, and Interstate 88 pass through the town.

Part of the south town line is the border of Albany County. The rest of the south and part of the west town line is the border of Schoharie County. The rest of the west and part of the north town line is the border of Montgomery County.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 5,808 people, 2,141 households, and 1,663 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 2,307 housing units at an average density of 12.5 persons/km2 (32.4 persons/sq mi). The racial makeup of the town was 97.66% White, 0.45% African American, 0.29% Native American, 0.28% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.28% from other races, and 1.02% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.81% of the population.

There were 2,141 households, out of which 38.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.6% were married couples living together, 7.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 22.3% were non-families. 17.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.71 and the average family size was 3.07.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 26.9% under the age of 18, 5.6% from 18 to 24, 30.4% from 25 to 44, 27.8% from 45 to 64, and 9.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 101.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 101.9 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $58,463, and the median income for a family was $65,461. Males had a median income of $40,237 versus $28,125 for females. The per capita income for the town was $23,345. About 2.2% of families and 3.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.1% of those under the age of 18 and 4.7% ages 65 or older.

<text>Niskayuna is a town in Schenectady County, New York, United States. The population was 23,278 at the 2020 census. The town is located in the southeast part of the county, east of the city of Schenectady, and is the easternmost town in the county.

==History==
The town of Niskayuna was created on March 7, 1809, from the town of Watervliet, with an initial population of 681. The town&#x27;s name was derived from early patents to Dutch settlers: &quot;Nis-ti-go-wo-ne&quot; or &quot;Co-nis-tig-i-one&quot;, both derived from the Mohawk language. The 19th-century historians Howell and Munsell mistakenly identified Conistigione as an Indian tribe, but they were a band of Mohawk people known by the term for this location. The original meaning of the words translate roughly as &quot;extensive corn flats&quot;, as the Mohawk for centuries cultivated maize fields in the fertile bottomlands along today&#x27;s Mohawk River. They were the easternmost of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy.

Among the Mohawk chiefs who lived in the area were &quot;Ron-warrigh-woh-go-wa&quot; (meaning in English the great fault finder or grumbler), &quot;Ka-na-da-rokh-go-wa&quot; (a great eater), &quot;Ro-ya-na&quot; (a chief), &quot;As-sa-ve-go&quot; (big knife), and &quot;A-voon-ta-go-wa&quot; (big tree). Of these, Ron-warrigh-woh-go-wa strongly objected to selling communal lands to the whites. He ensured that the Mohawk retained the rights of hunting and fishing on lands they deeded to the Dutch and other whites. He was reported to have said that &quot;after the whites had taken possession of our lands, they will make &quot;Kaut-sore&quot; [literally spoon-food or soup] of our bodies.&quot; He generally aided the settlers during the mid-18th century against the Canadians in the French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War.

The first European settlers of the town were Dutch colonists who chose to locate outside the manor of Rensselaerwyck to avoid the oversight of the patroons and the trading government of New Netherland. Harmon Vedder obtained a patent for some land in 1664, soon after the founders in 1661 gained land in what developed as the village and city of Schenectady. The traders of Fort Orange retained their monopoly, forbidding the settlers in the Schenectady area from fur trading. They developed mostly as farmers.

Among the early settlers were the ethnic Dutch Van Brookhoven, Claase, Clute, Consaul, Groot, Jansen, Krieger (Cregier), Pearse, Tymerson, Vedder, Van Vranken, and Vrooman families. Captain Martin Cregier, the first burgomaster of New Amsterdam, later settled in Niskayuna; he died in 1712.

Following the Revolutionary War, Yankee settlers entered New York, settling in the Mohawk Valley and to the west. The Erie Canal of 1825 and later enlargements brought increased traffic and trade through the valley. During the 19th and 20th centuries, industries developed along the Mohawk River, especially concentrated in Schenectady in this county. Farming continued in outlying areas. The headquarters of General Electric and Westinghouse Electric developed in the city of Schenectady, which became a center of broad-reaching innovation in uses of electricity and a variety of consumer products.

After World War II, the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory was opened in 1946 in Niskayuna, under a contract between General Electric and the US government. In 1973, the General Electric Engineering Development Center moved from downtown Schenectady to River Road in Niskayuna. Today, it is one of the two world headquarters of GE Global Research with the other in Bangalore, India. Due to high-level scientific and technological jobs associated with these businesses, Niskayuna has a high level of education among its residents and a high per capita income of towns in the capital area.

The following sites in the town are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: George Westinghouse Jones House, Niskayuna Railroad Station, Niskayuna Reformed Church, and Rosendale Common School.
== Geography ==

==Niska Day==
Since 1980, the annual community holiday &quot;Niska-Day&quot; (or Nisky-Day) is traditionally celebrated on the first Saturday after the third Friday in May. The festival begins in the early morning with a family foot race. This is followed by a parade and a fair. The day concludes with fireworks (weather permitting). Community groups pick a new theme each year (e.g., in 2007: &quot;Niska-unity&quot;). The town has the goal of bringing the families together for a celebration to help them recognize and appreciate their shared identity as residents of the town of Niskayuna. It takes place at the Craig Elementary School soccer fields.

The celebration was established in 1980 by the Niskayuna Community Action Program (N-CAP), responding to a school district report on mental health needs, to reinforce shared community identification. Unlike many municipalities, the town of Niskayuna does not sponsor an official observation of the Fourth of July. &quot;Niska-Day&quot; serves as the local substitute.

<text>Rotterdam is a town in Schenectady County, New York, United States. The population was 30,523 at the 2020 census.

The town of Rotterdam is in the south-central part of the county. It was founded in 1661 by Dutch settlers, who named it after the city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, where many immigrants last touched European grounds. The town borders the city of Schenectady.

==History==

Situated near the eastern end of New York State&#x27;s Heritage Corridor at what is known as the &quot;Gateway to the West&quot;, the town of Rotterdam is closely linked with the early development of Schenectady. At that time the present town of Rotterdam served as the outlying farmlands and wood lots for the settlers. With few exceptions, these settlers made their homes in the stockade in Schenectady but went to their farmlands during the daytime.

The lands now known as Rotterdam became Schenectady&#x27;s third ward when that city was incorporated in 1798. Rotterdam retained that status when the county of Schenectady was chartered in 1809. During this period, a council of aldermen and assistants from each of the four wards governed the city of Schenectady. In May 1819, the city council recommended that the third and fourth wards be separated out as towns, and on December 31, a petition to the state legislature was drafted. The legislation was passed on April 14, 1820, the final day of the legislative session, creating the town of Rotterdam.
Founded as a &#x27;first class town&#x27; in 1942, Rotterdam has since adopted the Old World Rotterdam coat of arms along with the motto &quot;Sterker door Strijd&quot; (Stronger through Effort). By diligently applying this motto, Rotterdam faces the future with confidence.

The Dellemont-Wemple Farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and the Enlarged Double Lock No. 23, Old Erie Canal in 2008.

The Mabee House, at the Mabee Farm Historic Site, the oldest surviving house in the Mohawk Valley, was added to the National Register of Historic Places May 22, 1978. It is a property of the Schenectady County Historical Society, being donated by a last descendant in his particular line, Mr. George Eugene Franchere, on January 29, 1993, the 287th anniversary of the original deed. It is currently being operated as a living history museum, conducts school programs, and events for the public.

Rotterdam has historically been a good town for baseball. For many years they brought up teams that would do well in the little league tournaments and Babe Ruth tournaments. They would even have one team go on to win a national championship in the latter.

In August 1977, the all star team Carman little league (one of the little league organizations within the town, now referred to as RC little league) would go on to qualify for the little league World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. They would go on to finish 4th.

3 years later in 1980, the same boys from that Carman team, along with a few mixed in from Rotterdam little league (the other little league organization in the town at the time) would become Babe Ruth World Series champions. They clawed their way out of the losers bracket to defeat Hawaii in 2 games in one day for the title. The tournament took place in Williston, North Dakota.

Years later in 2014, a team from the Rotterdam Babe Ruth League went on to go to the semifinals in the Mid-Atlantic Regional Baseball Tournament. Rotterdam is also the home of a large Net Zero housing complex.

Before 1985 the terms were two years, but a local law changed this. The 2020 general election took place in September, delayed from its original March schedule due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

* &quot;Mayor&quot;:
--Timothy Knight, of Cliff Street, was appointed to the Village Board during the COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020 to fill retiring Trustee Bill Morton&#x27;s seat. Knight was elected to a full-term on September 15, 2020, along with former Mayor Bergan and Trustee Tinker. He is the appointed Deputy Mayor and is currently serving as Acting Mayor after the resignation of Bergan in late April 2023. He was elected to a full-term as Village Mayor in the November 2023 Election, defeating former Mayor Gary Hayes.
* &quot;Trustees&quot;:

– Robert Tinker, of Indian Acres, elected with 52% of the vote in 2012. Re-elected with 49% of the vote in 2016. Re-elected in 2020 with 51% of the vote. The longest serving member on the Board, he was re-elected to a fourth term in 2023 with 43.2% of the vote.

– Sheryl Adams, of Upper Main Street, appointed to the Village Board in 2012 to fill former Trustee Avitabile&#x27;s seat. Won re-election for the remainder of the seat&#x27;s term in 2013 defeating former Mayoral candidate John Shaw Jr. Successfully gained a four-year term in 2014 with 49% of the vote and was re-elected in both 2018 and 2021.

– Amanda Fernandez, of Main Street, was appointed to the Village Board in October 2022 after former Trustee Shane Foland resigned one year into a four-year term. Fernandez, running unopposed, was elected to serve out the remaining two-years of the term in the 2023 Election with 99.7% of the vote.

– Kevin Young, of Railroad Avenue, was elected with 34.5% of the vote in the 2023 Election. Previously a member of the Middleburgh Planning Board, Mr. Young ran on a joint ticket with Mr. Tinker, defeating their opponent David Jeremenko by a two-to-one margin in the first contested Trustee election in 13 years.

* &quot;Former Officials:&quot;

– Matthew Avitabile, of Maple Avenue defeated incumbent William Ansel-McCabe with 53% of the vote in the 2012 Mayoral Election. Avitabile was a Village Trustee for five years before the 2012 election. Re-elected over write-in candidate Ansel-McCabe with 90% of the vote in 2016. Avitabile resigned as Mayor at the end of his legal term, extended by two weeks by Governor Cuomo&#x27;s executive order due to Coronavirus in the spring of 2020, and was subsequently reappointed to the Middleburgh Village Board as a Village Trustee. Avitabile&#x27;s tenure in local government ended in March 2021 with Trustees honoring him with a &quot;Matthew Avitabile Day.&quot;

===2016===

Incumbent Mayor Matthew Avitabile announced his intention to seek a second term with Trustees Morton and Tinker. Former Mayor William Ansel-McCabe briefly entered the race but did not submit a petition to receive a place on the ballot but supporters fielded a write in campaign. Mayor Avitabile was elected with 90% of the vote and Trustees Tinker and Morton received a total of 98% combined.

===2014===

Deputy Mayor Thomas Gruning declined to run for a second term. Incumbent Sheryl Adams was joined by newcomer Lillian Bruno of Grove Street. Both ran under the Middleburgh First Party, which won its fourth straight election. In March, Bruno won 44 votes, Adams 43 and were elected to four-year terms.

===2013===

In November 2012, former Mayor Gary Hayes submitted a petition to dissolve the 132-year-old Village. He cited excess cost and the &quot;apex&quot; the Village and Town has reached in consolidation. Citing New York State&#x27;s Article 19, which expired in 2010, his petition contained over 140 names.

The question of dissolution went to a vote on February 19, 2013. The voters rejected Mr. Hayes&#x27; proposal 344–71.

In March, Trustee Sheryl Adams, appointed to fill Mayor Matthew Avitabile&#x27;s unexpired term, won a one-year term to the board of trustees.

===2012===

In March 2012 incumbent Mayor Ansel-McCabe of the &quot;Phoenix&quot; party was defeated by Trustee Matthew Avitabile of the &quot;Middleburgh First&quot; party 53-46%. Thomas Wargo of the &quot;Direct Democracy&quot; party of Scribner Avenue received 1% of the vote.

===2010===

Trustee Avitabile and Trustee Bonnie Ingraham&#x27;s seats were up for election. Trustee Ingraham announced that she would not seek re-election. Running for these two seats are Avitabile, Dr. Thomas Gruning of Grove Street and Paul Hayes of MT Path who had previously run in 1996. Elections were held on March 16.

Avitabile and Gruning were running jointly under the &quot;Middleburgh First&quot; party while Mr. Hayes was under the &quot;New Beginning&quot; party. His brother, former Mayor Gary Hayes, decided not to run.

The &quot;Middleburgh First&quot; Party received 88% of the vote while the &quot;New Beginning&quot; received 12%. Turnout was very high despite being an off-year election.

===2008===

Mayor William Ansel-McCabe won re-election over Assistant Fire Chief John Shaw in the top race that year. McCabe received several fewer votes than in 2004 and caucused with Trustees Bowman and Ingraham.

Trustee Gerald Bowman and Charles &quot;Butch&quot; Ingraham won re-election in a surprisingly tight race against political newcomer Andrew Adams. Adams came up short against the two incumbents in the three-way race. Ingraham&#x27;s wife Bonnie was elected to a two-year term running unopposed.

<text>Schoharie ( ) is an incorporated town in and the county seat of Schoharie County, New York, United States. The population was 3,107 at the 2020 census.

The Town of Schoharie has a village, also called Schoharie. Both are derived from the Mohawk word for driftwood. The town is on the northeast border of the county. It is part of the Capital District of New York.

==History==
This area was long occupied by indigenous peoples; in the historic period, the Mohawk people, one of the Five Nations of the &quot;Haudenosaunee,&quot; or Iroquois Confederacy, dominated this territory, ranging up to the St. Lawrence River and east to the Hudson.

Although the English claimed New York province after taking control from the Dutch, the first European settlements in this area were by Palatine Germans in 1713, after the area was first explored in 1710/11. These Germans were among nearly 3,000 German Protestant refugees who sailed to New York in 1710, on ships arranged by Queen Anne&#x27;s government. They were refugees from the religious warfare along the border with France, and also had suffered the loss of crops from an extremely harsh winter in 1709, when the Rhine River froze. The English believed the German settlers could help develop the colony and granted them land to the west of English settlements.

Most of the Palatine Germans worked off their passage for several years in two work camps established along the upper Hudson River on property of Livingston Manor, owned by Robert Livingston. When given land, they cleared and established farms. In 1723, 100 Palatine families from the 1710 immigration were granted land just west of Little Falls in the Mohawk Valley under the Burnetsfield Patent. Palatine Germans founded other settlements in the valley, as noted in names such as German Flatts and Palatine Bridge. These frontier settlements were vulnerable to attack, but served as a defensive line during the French and Indian War and the American Revolution.

Developed for agriculture, the Schoharie Valley was considered a bread basket of the colony because of the amount of wheat produced even during the American Revolutionary War. Raids led by Joseph Brant and his Iroquois allies destroyed most of the buildings in the town of Schoharie.

Schoharie was first known as a district in Albany County before Schoharie County was organized. Established as a town in Albany County in 1788, it became the founding town of the newly created Schoharie County in 1795. In 1797, part of the town was used to form the towns of Blenheim, Broome, Cobleskill, and Middleburgh. Similarly, area for the towns of Esperance and Wright were removed from Schoharie in 1846 as settlement increased in other areas.

Schoharie has continued since its early settlement as a largely agricultural community. Cheesemaking and the dairy industry were important in the 19th century, when products were sold to New York City. Artisan cheesemaking and related trades have been of increasing importance since the late 20th-century.

On August 28, 2011, the Town of Schoharie was flooded by Hurricane Irene. Schoharie Creek rose to record levels, resulting in massive destruction of roads, homes, and businesses within the Town. Due to the devastation of what was classified as a 500-year flood, federal agencies such as FEMA and the National Guard were called in to assess damages and provide relief, shelter and assistance to affected residents. Many farms in the area suffered severe economic losses due to animals lost or drowned in flood waters, barns deemed unusable, and fall harvest crops ruined.

The Becker Stone House, Becker-Westfall House, The Colyer House, Sternbergh House, and Westheimer Site are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Abraham Sternberg House was added in 2010 and Christian Hess House and Shoemaker&#x27;s Shop in 2015.

On October 6, 2018, a limousine crashed in Schoharie, killing 20 people.

Part of the northeast town line forms the border of Schenectady County.

Interstate 88 crosses the north part of the town. New York State Route 30 is a north–south highway. State Route 30A diverges from NY-30 near the north town line. State Route 7 parallels the Interstate across the north part of Schoharie. New York State Route 443 intersects NY-30 at Vromans Corners.

<text>Lodi ( ) is a town in Seneca County, New York, United States. The population was 1,469 at the 2020 census.

The Town of Lodi is in the southwest part of the county and is northwest of Ithaca, New York. The town contains a village also named Lodi. Both owe their names to the Italian city of Lodi.

== History ==
The area was occupied by members of the Seneca tribe until 1779 when the Sullivan Expedition destroyed their villages, including a Seneca orchard at Lodi Point. The town became part of the Central New York Military Tract. The first settler arrived around 1789. In 1799, in the area of Brokaw Road, a group of New Jersey Dutch farmers settled to form a Dutch Reformed community, eventually having two churches. Remnants of one of these churches is the McNeil Cemetery located in the area of Brokaw Road. The New Jersey Dutch settled into the area for several generations and eventually their churches combined with several other churches to form the United Presbyterian Church of Lodi. Descendants of these original Dutchmen reside in the town today.

In 1826, Lodi was set apart from the Town of Covert. The town&#x27;s post office was established in 1820 and originally used the town name &quot;De Mott&#x27;s Corners&quot; (after the town&#x27;s postmaster and shopkeeper) before officially changing to &quot;Lodi&quot; in 1829. It initially shared the &quot;Lodi&quot; name with a community in what is now Collins, New York (which was known as &quot;West Lodi&quot; to differentiate the two) before that community changed its name to Gowanda.

Lodi Point was a popular stop for lake steamboats in the 19th century.

The Queen&#x27;s Castle was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.

==Geography==

The west town line, delineated by Seneca Lake is the border of Yates County, and the south town line is the border of Schuyler County. The town is in the Finger Lakes District of New York.

Located on the Eastern shore of Seneca Lake, Lodi is home to award-winning vineyards and accompanying wineries.

<text>Ovid is a village in Seneca County, New York, United States. The population was 602 at the 2010 census. The town was named by a clerk interested in the classics (see Ovid).

The Village of Ovid is within the Town of Ovid, but a small portion is in the Town of Romulus, and is southeast of Geneva, New York.

== History ==
Ovid and the surrounding area was part the lands controlled by the Iroquois. The Sullivan Expedition of 1779 drove away or killed many of these natives to reduce their raiding in support of the British. After the American Revolution the village was in the Central New York Military Tract, used to compensate soldiers.

Ovid was the first county seat of Seneca County, and a courthouse was erected in 1806. When adjacent towns were created from Ovid and placed in other counties, Ovid was seen as being too far from the county center, and Waterloo became the county seat. Later, Waterloo itself became located on the northern fringe of the county when new towns created there were assigned to new counties. The ultimate solution was to make both Ovid and Waterloo county seats.

The village was incorporated in 1816, but dissolved in 1849, and then re-incorporated in 1852.

The David and Mary Kinne Farmstead, Seneca County Courthouse Complex at Ovid, Edith B. Ford Memorial Library and Aaron Wilson House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

On 21 January 2025, a massive fire broke out in an apartment above the Big M Market on the village&#x27;s Main Street. Over 200 firefighters responded to the fire and were on scene for more than nine hours. Authorities later determined that a charging device plugged into an electrical outlet in an apartment above the Big M store was the cause of the fire. Five businesses were destroyed along with 60 associated jobs, and 15 to 20 people in 10 apartments lost their homes.

==Geography==
Ovid is located at (42.6775, -76.8243).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 0.4 square miles (1.1 km2), none of which is covered with water.

<text>Seneca Falls is a hamlet and census-designated place in Seneca County, New York, United States. The population was 6,681 at the 2010 census. The 2020 census population of Seneca Falls CDP was 6,809. The hamlet is in the Town of Seneca Falls, east of Geneva. It was an incorporated village from 1831 to 2011.

Finger Lakes Regional Airport (0G7) is south of the hamlet.

Seneca Falls was the site of the Seneca Falls Convention, a foundational event in the Women&#x27;s Rights Movement. The town is believed by some to have been the inspiration for the fictional town of &quot;Bedford Falls, N.Y.&quot; portrayed in filmmaker Frank Capra&#x27;s classic 1940s film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;.

== History ==
===Early history ===
The region was in the domain of the Cayuga tribe and visited by Jesuit missionaries in the 17th-century.

=== American Revolution and aftermath ===
The Cayuga were allies of the British and attacked American settlements from the outset of the revolution. The Sullivan Expedition of 1779 was sent to destroy native villages and kill the warriors.

After the war, the village and surrounding land became part of the Central New York Military Tract, land reserved for veterans of the war. The north end of Cayuga Lake was set aside as a reservation for returning Cayuga tribal members.

=== The early village ===
The first pioneers arrived around 1790. The first settlers chose the area for its easy access to water and close proximity to the Iroquois trail.

When the village was first incorporated in 1831, it was named after the series of small falls and rapids on the Seneca River which drains Seneca of the Finger Lakes. The river was partially canalized for navigation in 1818, and connected the lakes with the Erie Canal in 1828. The village was re-incorporated in 1837, 1860, and 1896 with new charters.

The New York State Barge Canal project in 1915 eliminated what remained of the rapids, canalizing the entire river and building a pair of locks to replace the three smaller locks which had made it possible for boat and barge traffic to pass through the village.

=== The growth of Seneca Falls through technology ===
The falls were also the cause of the village&#x27;s existence, providing water power for mills, distilleries, tanneries, and other factories. By the mid 19th Century, Seneca Falls was the third largest flour milling center in the world, after Rochester and Oswego. There is still a small hydroelectric power generating station in the village.

A young man, Birdsall Holly, moved to Seneca Falls from Auburn to work as a mechanic in one of these mills. His son, Birdsall Holly Jr., was entranced by the water power, studying hydraulics and mechanics until he became one of the foremost American inventors. Holly became a partner in the Silsby Company, also called &quot;The Island Works&quot;.
While working for this company, he obtained his first patent, which was for a rotary water pump. He later moved to Lockport, New York, where he continued inventing, but his work with pumps was continued by Seabury S. Gould Sr. who cast the first all-metal (cast iron) pump and founded Goulds Pumps, a worldwide pump manufacturer, which was the world&#x27;s largest company dedicated to producing only pumps when it was taken over by ITT Technology in 1997.

While working for the Silsby Company, Holly also developed the rotary steam engine. This technology was married to the pump technology and was utilized in making the first successful steam fire engine. The Silsby Company eventually moved to Elmira, New York and became American LaFrance, famous for its fire engines.

=== Social movements in the village and surrounding area ===
Seneca Falls played a prominent role in the Women&#x27;s Rights Movement. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, one of the organizers of the 1848 Seneca Falls Women&#x27;s Rights Convention and recognized as &quot;the philosopher and chief publicist of the radical wing of the 19th century women&#x27;s rights movement&quot;, lived in Seneca Falls from 1847 to 1863. Amelia Bloomer, popularized a dress reform in her newspaper, The Lily, which became known as bloomers, a design believed to be influenced by native women of the area. Abolitionist causes against slavery were popular in Seneca Falls.

In August 1843, Abby Kelley, an outspoken abolitionist, came to Seneca Falls and addressed a crowd on the south side of the Seneca River. She confronted the nation and its institutions, including a local Presbyterian Church and its minister, over slavery. Within a year, a member of that church was found guilty of &quot;disorderly and unchristian conduct&quot; after she personally confronted that minister on the issue of slavery.

Early women&#x27;s rights leaders Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Coffin Mott, Martha Coffin Wright, Mary Ann M&#x27;Clintock and Jane Hunt hastily organized the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women&#x27;s rights convention, held in 1848 at the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel. A &quot;Declaration of Sentiments&quot; was adopted, drafted by Stanton, M&#x27;Clintock and two adult M&#x27;Clintock daughters, which included support for women&#x27;s suffrage. Frederick Douglass, a former slave and publisher of a Rochester, New York, abolitionist newspaper, attended the convention. His eloquent support for the women&#x27;s suffrage resolution was instrumental in its passage. Nearby Waterloo was the planning location for the convention, which is commemorated by the Women&#x27;s Rights National Historical Park in the two villages.

In July 1923 the National Woman&#x27;s Party celebrated the 75th anniversary of the 1848 Seneca Falls convention with a pageant and pilgrimage to Susan B. Anthony’s grave in nearby Rochester, though Anthony did not attend in 1848. Alice Paul presented the draft of the Equal Rights Amendment, referred to as &quot;the Lucretia Mott Amendment&quot;, for the delegates’ approval at the general conference held at the First Presbyterian Church in Seneca Falls.

The National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame was established in Seneca Falls in 1969. It honors American women for their contributions to society.

The first woman mayor of Seneca Falls was the village&#x27;s last mayor. Diana M. Smith, first elected in 2004, was re-elected for a 2nd term in 2008.

=== Dissolution ===
On March 16, 2010, Seneca Falls village residents voted to dissolve the village effective December 31, 2011. The village began investigating the possibility of dissolution in 2006, commissioning three different studies covering continuity of village services and disposition of village assets and debt. It was postulated that by dissolving the village, the average village property tax payer would save $950 a year. The final vote was 1,198 in favor, 1,112 opposed, and five blank ballots. It is, to date, the largest New York village ever to approve dissolution.

<text>Seneca Falls is a town in Seneca County, New York, United States. The population was 9,027 at the 2020 census.

The Town of Seneca Falls contains the former village also called Seneca Falls. The town is east of Geneva, New York, in the northern part of the Finger Lakes District.

Seneca Falls is a historic location along a branch of the Erie Canal and is often referred to as the &#x27;birthplace of women&#x27;s rights&#x27;, where the 1848 women&#x27;s rights convention was held. Many also believe it to have been the inspiration for the fictional town of &quot;Bedford Falls&quot;, portrayed in filmmaker Frank Capra&#x27;s classic 1946 film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;.

== History ==

The region is the former realm of the Cayuga tribe, who were visited by Jesuit missionaries during the 17th century. Cayuga villages were attacked and destroyed by the Sullivan Expedition of 1779 in retaliation for plundering and killing new colonists.

The region became part of the Central New York Military Tract, reserved for veterans, after the conclusion of the American Revolution.

A canal was completed in 1818 allowing transit between Seneca Lake and Cayuga Lake. This canal was connected to the Erie Canal in 1828.

The town was established in 1829 from part of the Town of Junius. The community of Seneca Falls in the town set itself apart by incorporating as a village in 1831.

The Seneca Falls Convention held July 19–20, 1848, was the first women&#x27;s rights convention organized by women explicitly for the purpose of discussing women&#x27;s rights as such. 

On March 16, 2010, the people of the Village of Seneca Falls voted to dissolve the village into the Town of Seneca Falls, effective in 2012.

Goulds Pumps, a leading manufacturer of pumps, is headquartered in Seneca Falls.

<doc id="260044" wikidata="Q3183159" url="?curid=260044" title="Waterloo (village), New York">
<text>Waterloo is a village and primary county seat of Seneca County, New York, United States. The population was 5,171 at the 2010 census and is now the most populated village in Seneca County. The village is named after Waterloo, Belgium, where Napoleon was defeated. It is the primary county seat of Seneca County, with the other being Ovid as part of a two-shire system established in 1822. Most of the county administrative offices are located in the village. Therefore, many political sources only list Waterloo as the county seat.

The Village of Waterloo is mostly in the Town of Waterloo, but the part south of the Cayuga-Seneca Canal of the village is in the Town of Fayette and a small area in the southeast of the village is in Town of Seneca Falls. Waterloo is east of Geneva and is located in between the two main Finger Lakes, Seneca Lake and Cayuga Lake.

==History==
The area was within the realm of the Cayuga nation, one of several bands to form the Iroquois League. The current site of the village was the location of the former Cayuga village &quot;Skoiyase&quot; (or Skoi-Yase), meaning &quot;flowing water&quot;, which was established around 1500. They were visited by Jesuit missionaries in the 17th century. After the Sullivan Expedition of 1779 destroyed Skoiyase, many natives left the area. The land then became part of the Central New York Military Tract, reserved for veterans.

The first new settler, Jabez Gorham, arrived on the site of the village around 1795. The early village was known as &quot;New Hudson&quot;. It was also known as &quot;Scoys&quot;, based on the name of the former Indian village.

Because the original county seat in Ovid was deemed too close to the south county line after land was lost from Seneca County, Waterloo became the county seat in 1819. A similar fate befell Waterloo, when much of the north of Seneca County was lost, leaving the village close to the northern county line. The outcome was that both villages were made joint county seats, even though some of the lost towns were later returned to the county. Seneca County remains a two-shire county, although nearly all government activity now occurs in Waterloo. In honor of the two-shire history, the County Board of Supervisors will at least once a year hold a meeting in Ovid at the buildings locally called the &quot;Three Bears&quot;.

Planning for the Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in 1848 in Seneca Falls took place in Waterloo.

The Village of Waterloo was incorporated in 1824 and again in 1866, the same year it celebrated the first Memorial Day. Waterloo was officially designated as the birthplace of Memorial Day in 1966 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. The Memorial Day Museum is in the village. However, in 2014, Bellware and Gardiner challenged this designation in &quot;The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America&quot;. They uncovered evidence that the origin story is a hoax including information ignored by the Centennial Committee backing the proclamation. This includes a report in a New York newspaper that predates by several years any of the sources used by the committee. It describes, in detail, Waterloo&#x27;s first Memorial Day and places it in 1868. They also note other inconsistencies between the historical record and the story compiled by the Centennial Committee and the lack of discussion or debate in Congress prior to the resolution recognizing Waterloo as the birthplace of the holiday.

<text>Canton is an incorporated town in St. Lawrence County, New York, United States. The population was 11,638 at the time of the 2020 census. The town contains two villages: one also named Canton, the other named Rensselaer Falls. The town is named after the great port of Canton (now named Guangzhou) in China. Canton is the home of St. Lawrence University and the State University of New York at Canton. The Canton Central School District is based in the village of Canton.

==History==

Humans have been present in this region of New York since the Paleo-Indian period which is from about 15,000 to 7,000 BC. Iroquoian peoples arrived between 1,200 and 4,000 years ago, and both the Mohawk and the Oneida consider the Adirondacks to be part of their territory. When white settlers began to arrive, the area was part of the Mohawk Nation, which was part of the Iroquois Confederacy. The Mohawks are known as Kanienkehaka, or &quot;the people of the flint,&quot; and they were considered the keepers of the Eastern door for this edge of Haudenosaunee territory. The first settler arrived in 1800. The town was organized/incorporated on May 14, 1805, from part of the town of Lisbon. The name Canton was supposedly selected due to contemporary interests in the China trade. Canton was one of the original ten towns of the county. In 1845, the community of Canton was incorporated as a village. The Brick Chapel Church and Cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

==Geography==
After the War of 1812, the sovereign territory known as Akwesasne was bisected in two when the United States and Great Britain drew a line on a map, creating today&#x27;s northern border between New York state and Canada. Now the Akwesasne Mohawk reservation sits in both countries, with borders of its own.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 105.9square miles, of which 104.8 square miles (27 are land and 1.1 are water).
The Grasse River flows northward through the centre of St. Lawrence County, and the Oswegatchie River flows through the northwest corner. U.S. Route 11 is a northeast–southwest highway, which intersects New York State Route 68 and New York State Route 310 at Canton village.

<text>Gouverneur ( ) is a town in St. Lawrence County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,551. That was down from 7,085 in 2010. The town is named after statesman and landowner Gouverneur Morris.

The Town of Gouverneur contains a village named Gouverneur. The town is near the southwestern border of St. Lawrence County and is southwest of Canton, the county seat.

==History==
The region was first settled around 1805.

The Town of Gouverneur was formed in 1810 from part of the Town of Oswegatchie (previously an area called &quot;Town of Cambria&quot;).

Like many other settlements in the county, the town&#x27;s growth was hindered by the War of 1812, although rapid growth resumed soon after.
In 1850, the community of Gouverneur set itself off from the town by incorporating as a village.

The town economy was based in part on mining marble, talc, and zinc.

The United States Post Office was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.

==Geography==

The Oswegatchie River flows through the town in two directions, westward in the south and eastward in the north.

U.S. Route 11, New York State Route 58, and New York State Route 812 converge at Gouverneur village. NY-58 and NY-812 are conjoined southwest of the village, and US-11 and NY-812 are conjoined northeast of the village. Due to the low area population and relatively little through traffic, the area&#x27;s highways and the Gouverneur Town Court experience relatively light traffic flow.

Many of the original stone quarries are still identifiable. A stone quarry on Oak Island in Chippewa Bay supplied stone to build Boldt Castle. It even had its own railway to move cut stone to the boats used to transport the stone. A stone quarry that was once located in South Hammond on Route 37 supplied sandstone to make local roads. This quarry at one time employed approximately 600 men. The Town of Hammond Museum, formed by R.T.

<text>Hermon is a hamlet (and census-designated place) in St. Lawrence County, New York, United States. The population was 422 at the 2010 census.

The hamlet is in the northern part of the Town of Hermon and is southwest of Canton. It was an incorporated village from 1887 to 2016.

== History ==
This was the twenty-fourth town erected by an act of the Legislature passed April 17, 1830. Hermon was originally organized under the name of Depeau, after Francis Depeau, once proprietor of a large tract of land in Jefferson County. He was also interested in the middle third of this territory, which had passed from McCormick to George Lewis, July 12, 1804, who sold to John and Curtis Bolton, August 1, 1823, and they sold to Depeau, June 6, 1828. He sold to Sarah, wife of John Bolton. May 3. 1830.

The town was formed from De Kalb and Edwards April 17, 1830. The first town meeting was held at the school-house near Nathaniel Kent&#x27;s May 4, 1830, and the following officers elected: William Teall, supervisor; Benjamin Healey, town clerk; Wilkes Richardson, Isaac C. Pool, Silas Williams, assessors; Martin L. Cook, John Matoon, over-. seers of the poor; Simeon Peterson, Jesse Worden, Shubael Parker, commissioners of highways; Wilkes Richardson, Robert Gotham, Harry Tanner, commissioners of schools; Benjamin Healey, Aaron Teall, C. D. Morehouse, inspectors of public schools; Charles O. Redfield, collector; Ariel Wrisley, Charles C. Redfield, constables.

The town originally embraced the township of Fitzwilliam and a strip one mile (1.6 km) by six from the southwest side of De Kalb. On November 17, 1852, the supervisors annexed a tract from the southeastern corner of the town of Edwards, leaving in Hermon .

The name of the town was changed to Hermon, February 28, 1834, as there was a Depeauville in Jefferson County. A post-office named Hermon had been established in the northeastern part of the town December 28, 1828.

Many of the pioneers of this town came from Vermont and were industrious and hardy people. The first white settler was James Taylor, who made a small clearing in the western part &quot;circa&quot; 1805. Philemon Stewart, Ariel Inman and Rufus Hopkins came in soon afterwards, but left on the outbreak of the War of 1812 and did not return. Thomas Tanner came in March 1809, and spent the remainder of his long life there.

The first road leading through this town was that from Russell to De Kaib, which was opened just prior to the War of 1812. In 1818 the road from De Kalb to what is now Hermon village was opened.

The first school taught in the town was kept in the house of David McCollum in the winter of 1817-18 by William D. Moore.

The first marriage in the town was that of Ashbel Tryon and Harriet McCollum, July 4, 1821; and the first death was that of Peter, infant son of Germain Sutherland, in 1818.

A post office was established at Hermon on December 20, 1828, with Benjamin Healey as postmaster. The mails then came in from De Kalb, carried on horseback by Henry Tanner.

David McCollum settled in 1812 and had four sons: Martin, John, Jefferson D. and Samuel. The latter took the homestead. Roger Story came in 1813. Germain Sutherland settled in 1816; he was father of Moses H. and one of his daughters married H. B. Hamlin, and another Rosalve Healey.

Other early settlers were Joseph H. Baird, One Gibbons, William Teall (the first supervisor), Benjamin Healey (the first town clerk, and who left numerous descendants), Clark Main, Ralph Fisher, Lorenzo H. Sheldon, Chester Winslow, Shubael Parker, Wilkes Richardson (one of the first assessors and father of Ferdinand and King R,), William D. Gilmore, William H. Underwood. Henry Reed, Orlando Babbitt, Dr. H. Alexander, Reuben L. Willson, John Gardner, and Asa, his son, Frank Matteson, Ransom and John Day, Noah Hamilton, Ezra Leonard, Alexander Brown, Almon and Amos V. Farnsworth, Silas Williams, A. F. Gates, a prominent dairyman and farmer, William Rasback, Thomas Thornhill, Alvin A. Corey, William A. Scripter, E. J. Stewart, son of Philemon Stewart, an early settler. Many of these men became prominent in the community and sonic of them left descendants in this section.

The early industries of this town were connected with lumbering, the clearing of land and raising such crops as were needed by the people. But early in the history of this locality its excellent adaptability to grazing became apparent and more attention was given to stock-raising and dairying, and in recent years the latter industry has given it a rank among the best towns in the county. Cheese is the principal product.

There are large deposits of hematite iron ore in the town and early attracted attention, and it was long believed they would prove to be a source of wealth. Mining operations were begun on an extensive scale in 1864, and J. W. Lowden, an eastern capitalist, also erected a furnace at Cooper&#x27;s Falls in De Kalb. Mr. Lowden invested a large sum of money, mostly in preliminary work, In 1872 he sold out his whole interest to the Union Iron Company of Buffalo, John Webb of Gouverneur acting as local agent of the company. The &quot;hard times &quot;of 1873-4 came on, and that fact was given as a reason for cessation of the enterprise, which has never been resumed. Like most of the other attempts to successfully mine and produce iron in this county, there seem to have been conditions and circumstances which, coupled with the cheap production elsewhere, rendered it impossible to profitably pursue the industry here.
The Village of Hermon was officially dissolved on December 31, 2016.

<text>Massena is a village in St. Lawrence County, New York, United States. The village is named after André Masséna, one of Napoleon&#x27;s generals.

The Village of Massena is at the southwestern town line of the Town of Massena, with a small southeastern section of the community spilling into the Town of Louisville, and a tiny portion in the Town of Norfolk. The village is located near the northern border of the county.

== History ==
The village was first settled &quot;circa&quot; 1803. Part of its early growth was based on neighboring medicinal springs. André Masséna was one of the original eighteen Marshals of France created by Napoleon.

Massena is the hometown of Baseball Hall of Fame member Bid McPhee, who was born there in 1859. Voice actor Hal Smith spent a significant part of his early years living in Massena. He graduated from the Massena High School in 1936.

In 1928, Massena was the site of a blood libel against its small Jewish community. Its history has been recorded by the town&#x27;s longstanding newspaper, &quot;The Courier-Observer&quot;, formerly named &quot;The Massena Observer&#x27; &quot;, and in &quot;The Incident at Massena&quot;, a 1978 book by historian Saul S. Friedman.

Throughout the mid 20th century, Massena experienced enormous growth due to the construction of the Franklin D. Roosevelt power project and the Eisenhower locks which helped connect the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes via the St. Lawrence River. Massena established itself as the manufacturing center of St. Lawrence county with Aluminum Company Of America (Alcoa) plant, Reynolds Metals plant (now Alcoa) and a General Motors Powertrain plant (dismantled in 2011). The Alcoa East plant was temporarily idled in 2009, but began to restart pot lines in January 2011.

The village has experienced a decline in population in recent decades largely due to its eroding industrial base and incomes. The unemployment and crime rates for the village had doubled in the past decade. The village tax rates have gone up 52 percent since 2004. The government blames it on growing employee union increased pay demands and pension funds.

Many of the Main Street&#x27;s storefronts of downtown remain vacant. Some of the abandoned buildings along Water Street have been torn down as well. Various vacant homes throughout the town have burned or also been torn down. Furthermore, the St. Lawrence Centre Mall, once a thriving shopping center, has seen nearly 90% of its stores close their doors at the mall, while many simply left the town altogether. The crime rate of Massena has gone up dramatically in the past 10 years. The village mayor Tim Currier was arrested on drug charges in 2020.

The Robinson Bay Archeological District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

<text>Massena is a town in St. Lawrence County, New York, United States. Massena is along the county&#x27;s northern border, just south of the St. Lawrence River and the Three Nations Crossing of the Canada–United States border. The population was 12,433 at the 2020 census. The town of Massena contains a village also named Massena.

== History ==
Massena was established in 1792 by Anable Faucher. The settlement was initially called &quot;Nikentsiake&quot; by the Mohawk Indians, translating to &quot;where the fish live.&quot; Massena was one of the first towns settled in St. Lawrence county, but was not incorporated until 1802 when it was formed from the town of Lisbon. The town and its village are named after André Masséna, a general and Marshal to Napoleon during the Napoleonic Wars.

The town boasted the Massena Springs, a pair of sulfur springs, one hot and the other cold, reputed to possess healing powers known to the Native Americans before European settlement. In 1820, an Army veteran, Captain John Polley, hoping to capitalize on the properties, opened a hotel and began to advertise them. By 1858, three hotels, numerous rental cottages, a bathing house, and a plant that bottled and sold the spring water, had been built. By about 1900, the Springs&#x27; status as a popular resort had faded.

Up until the 1880s, the town was predominantly agricultural, mainly home to butter and cheese production. The first small mills were built in the 1830s, harnessing the Grasse River to turn their wheels. They included a saw mill, stone-cutter, and a tannery. In 1833, New York State Legislature approved a canal that would bypass a troublesome rapids hindering navigation on the St. Lawrence by linking the Grasse and St. Lawrence Rivers. However, the British North American government preempted this project by building the Cornwall Canal on the Canadian side of the River, completed in 1843.

The Massena Canal project was revived at the end of the century and completed in 1898, finally connecting the Grasse River and St. Lawrence River. A powerhouse built in 1900 provided hydroelectric power to the town. The new canal attracted the Pittsburgh Reduction Company (later Alcoa). This influx of industry workers transformed former health retreat hotels into housing for the burgeoning workforce. The Massena Power Canal was closed in 1958.

In 1928 the town was the scene of the antisemitic Massena blood libel. The town&#x27;s Jews were falsely accused of kidnapping and ritual murder of a girl.

In the 1950s, the New York Power Authority was established, leading to the creation of the St. Lawrence-Franklin D. Roosevelt Power Project. Spanning the St. Lawrence River, the hydropower plant was capable of generating over 900,000 kilowatts of electricity. Simultaneously, the 1950s witnessed the development of the St. Lawrence Seaway, a monumental American-Canadian navigational project. This system of locks and gates facilitated the movement of boats through the river, connecting the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean. With the completion of the Seaway and Power Project, Massena experienced a significant expansion at the Alcoa plant, solidifying its status as the oldest continuously operating aluminum production facility in the Western Hemisphere.

The 1980s saw the establishment of the St. Lawrence Centre Mall and St. Lawrence strip mall complex, fostering a regional retail hub, attracting Canadian shoppers.

The town suffered natural disasters in the 1944 Cornwall-Massena earthquake and in the January 1998 North American ice storm.

==Geography and climate==
Massena is located just south of the St. Lawrence River, and the Grasse and Racquette rivers pass through town.

===Climate===
Massena has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;).

== Economy ==
The modern town&#x27;s economy is centered on power production, the commerce of the St. Lawrence Seaway, and an Alcoa Aluminum plant, the world&#x27;s longest continually operating aluminum facility. Alcoa employs over 600 people at its facilities in Massena.

The New York Power Authority now operates a hydroelectric power generating dam, the St. Lawrence-FDR Power Project, on the St. Lawrence River adjacent to Massena. Curran Renewable Energy manufactures wood pellet fuel and mulch in the town. Massena is also home to the Eisenhower and Snell Locks, part of the St. Lawrence Seaway which allows ships and vessels to pass through the St. Lawrence River and on to the Great Lakes.

While on November 2, 2015, Alcoa announced the idling of the smelter at its &quot;Alcoa West&quot; plant, the facility remained open through negotiations with New York State, and 400 jobs were saved until 2019. The Forgings and Extrusions facilities at Alcoa West were unaffected. The changes resulted in the loss of 487 jobs.

It was estimated in 2013 that nearly 30% of Massena residents live below the poverty line. St. Lawrence County&#x27;s poverty rate is higher than both the state and federal rates and ranks the 5th highest in New York State.

The village is adjacent to Interstate 86, a few miles east of the split with Interstate 390. New York State Route 54 intersects New York State Route 415 in the village. County Roads 10 and 13 also lead into Bath.

Bath is served by the Bath &amp; Hammondsport Railroad which operates over former Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western (DL&amp;W) mainline trackage between a connection with Norfolk Southern in Painted Post, and the company&#x27;s terminus in Cohocton. (Trackage to Wayland remains in place but is no longer used. Service on the original B&amp;H between Bath and Hammondsport has also been discontinued.)

The Erie Railroad&#x27;s Rochester Division once passed through Bath. The 1960 merger of the Erie and DL&amp;W led to the creation of Erie-Lackawanna which was followed by the elimination of redundant trackage. The Erie line through Bath was abandoned, as was much of the DL&amp;W west of Wayland. The result was a drastic reduction of railroad activity in Bath since traffic could be routed over the parallel ex-Erie mainline through the Canisteo River Valley.

Erie-Lackawanna was absorbed into the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) in 1976. In 1999, Conrail lines in the region were acquired by Norfolk Southern. Since then, the Bath &amp; Hammondsport has become a subsidiary of the Livonia, Avon &amp; Lakeville which currently operates the line, though not over any of its original route. Trains operate through Bath five days per week.

The Conhocton River flows through Bath, and Lake Salubria is a small artificial lake southeast of the village.

==History==
The town was founded in 1793 and was part of a land investment by wealthy Briton William Pulteney, and named after Bath, Somerset in England, where he owned extensive estates. It was created along with Steuben County in 1796 and became a mother town of the county, eventually yielding land to seven later towns. The Lackawanna Railroad opened its mainline through Bath, and opened a station, in 1882.

The first jailhouse was built in 1796 which was constructed out of logs at a location just west of Pulteney Square. It was eventually replaced by a more durable structure made of stone.

<text>Canisteo () is a village in Steuben County, New York, United States. The population was 2,176 at the 2020 census.

The Village of Canisteo is in the northwest corner of the Town of Canisteo and is southeast of Hornell.

== History ==
===Native Americans===
Canisteo existed as a community prior to European settlement, but there are different versions of who the inhabitants were and what the settlement consisted of. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Canisteo was in a remote area, between territories of the Seneca and Delaware Indians, &quot;a sort of No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;.
There are references to a &quot;Kanestio castle&quot;, but differing accounts of what it was, or even what was meant by &quot;castle&quot;. One modern writer calls it &quot;mysterious&quot;, noting that &quot;facts about [it] are few and difficult to come by.&quot; A well-known version is that of Steuben County historian Harlo Hakes, published in 1896:

&quot;Previous to the advent of the white man this town, and in fact the whole valley of the Canisteo, was the abiding place and favorite hunting and fishing grounds of the American Indians. The region was originally the land of the Senecas, but by sufferance the Delawares were permitted to occupy portions of it. We are told that within the limits of this town was once the Indian village of &#x27;Kanestio,&#x27; where also lived a number of deserters from the British army and other renegades from the white settlements. The murder of two Dutch traders by these outlaws brought upon them the vengeance of Sir William Johnson, and the result was the destruction of their settlement.&quot;
&quot;The Delaware Indian town which had been dignified by some writers with the name of &#x27;Kanestio Castle&#x27;...is said to have contained about sixty hewed log houses, with stone chimneys in each, and to have been the home or seat of operations of a noted &#x27;Delaware King,&#x27; known as At-weet-sera.&quot; The destruction of the Indian village took place in 1765.

===European settlers===
====Colonial village of outlaws====
According to William Stuart, &quot;The history of Kanestio Castle constitutes the genesis of Steuben County&quot;. It is the first place in what became Steuben County to be mentioned in writing. Just what the word &quot;castle&quot; means is not clear, and precisely where it was is not known either. There is no mention of any castle in the European sense of a large stone building. It may mean nothing more than that it was a permanent, as opposed to transitory, settlement. The earliest description, from a French colonial historian of about 1690, is that Kanestio consisted of &quot;&#x27;several score of houses built of timber, each having four stone chimneys, adjoining a natural meadow of several hundred arpents.&#x27; Kanestio Castle!&quot;. Another modern writer reports the same information as &quot;a luxurious castle of logs, long by wide&quot;, now with four fireplaces. The stone chimneys are unquestionably a European artifact. The same French historian, describing an expedition south from what is today Kingston, Ontario, says that Kanestio was a community of European outlaws: &quot;&quot;A more worthless lot of renegades and villains, who had no hope of heaven or fear of hell, we never saw.&quot; They were from diverse backgrounds, and speaking different languages (&quot;polyglot&quot;).

There is no further written reference to Kanestio for 72 years. In 1762 two Dutch traders, British subjects, were killed by &quot;a brace of outlaws from the Castle,&quot; described in another source as &quot;the Indians from Kanestio&quot;. Kanestio was then described as &quot;the largest Delaware [Indian] town&quot;, but also according to the same source, it was &quot;a village of lawless stragglers&quot;. The English governor Sir William Johnson, in response, sent a party of &quot;Indians&quot; and British troops in 1764, under the command of Andrew Montour. At Kanestio they &quot;burned 60 good houses, a vast amount of corn, agricultural implements and saddles.&quot; The settlement at Kanestio Castle was eliminated.

An Indian village of Kanestio appears in the 1928 novel &quot;The Plains of Abraham&quot;, by James Curwood.

====Early settlers====
Settlers began arriving at what would become a new community around 1789. It was one of the first settlements in what is today Steuben County. Immigration and commerce were via what is today Pennsylvania, where the Canisteo River led to; there were no direct connections with Albany or New York City. The largest growth came after the Erie Railroad, which did provide a link to New York, arrived in 1851, when many factories opened. The village was incorporated in 1873.

The village of Canisteo was originally (prior to its incorporation) called Bennettsville. The original Canisteo, today a hamlet called Canisteo Center or Carson, was southeast of the present village, along the river. When the Erie Railroad was built in 1850, there was not room for a depot between the tracks and the Canisteo River, so the depot was built upriver, at the south of the tracks, on the west side of Depot Street. A &quot;fairly large settlement&quot;, which disappeared in the twentieth century, grew up near the depot, on the north side of the river and tracks. Depot Street (renamed Railroad Street while the trolley ran down it) was built to connect the depot to the Canisteo House hotel. A large community, with businesses and shops, and other hotels, sprang up.

===The railroad era===
Railroad Street – Greenwood Street was in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the principal street of Canisteo. On an 1873 map, Main Street (neither East nor West) stretched from Railroad/Greenwood Street to what was later called Ordway Lane, where the street ended. In the other direction, one traveled north from Railroad/Greenwood Street along Hornellsville Street.

Until 1851, when the Erie Railroad began operations, traffic was via the Canisteo River. The Erie ended that traffic, although an undated picture, which must be post-Erie since it includes a bicycle, shows a horse-drawn &quot;stage&quot; making two trips a day to Hornell. Aside from that the Erie was the sole route until 1892, when the Hornellsville &amp; Canisteo Railway (a trolley line) linked Canisteo with Hornell; the trolley passed by the Erie station, linking it via Depot Street with the center of Canisteo, over half a mile away. By road, the main connection was the Canisteo River Road, today (2019) Steuben County route 29 between Canisteo and Hornell, route 119 between Canisteo and Cameron. The new hard-surface road between Hornell and Canisteo that later became New York Route 36 was built in 1912. (That road was destroyed by Hurricane Agnes in 1972; the current four-lane route is higher up.) With the growth of automobiles this replaced the railroad, Depot St. declined in importance, and Hornellsville Street was turned into West Main Street and the former Main St. into East Main St. All Erie service to Canisteo ended in the 1940s; there were still freight trains, but none stopped in Canisteo.

The first manufacturer in the village was L. Allison&#x27;s &quot;large boot and shoe factory&quot;, founded in 1868.

A map with business notices from 1873 reveals that Canisteo had three physicians, one dentist, four attorneys, one tailor, one stable, a cooper, a foundry, three groceries and a meat market, and small manufacturers of shoes and boots, bee hives, a flour mill, a cheese factory, a rake factory, and some others. On Railroad Street (later Depot Street) was the Canisteo Steam Power Company, which manufactured steam engines and employed 10–12 workers. Perhaps it is because of it that Canisteo had a &quot;Times Steam Print&quot;, the &quot;Times&quot; presumably a reference to the &quot;Canisteo Times&quot;, whose office was on Railroad Street.

In 1878 the manufactures of Canisteo amounted to a million dollars. At various times there were factories making buttons, rulers, dresses, signs, Superior registers, baskets, and car springs.

A picture from 1880 reveals that on the west side of Greenwood St. there was a bookstore run by Allison B. Laine. A J. H. Stewart owned, at 23 Main St. (later East Main St.) a store selling pianos, organs, and sheet music.

An American LaFrance fire engine was purchased in 1881. The Canisteo Water Works was built in 1887; the bandstand in the park in 1888.

In 1888 Canisteo was described as prosperous. &quot;While the factories over the country are reducing the hours of labor her industries are wide-awake, and have more than enough to keep them running full time.&quot;

In the late 19th century Canisteo was a temperance community. This was seen as progressive.

In 1890 Canisteo had a professional baseball team.

In 1891 the Farmer&#x27;s Co-Operative Insurance Company was organized in Canisteo, and grew to be &quot;one of the most successful fire insurance companies in the state&quot;. The same clipping reveals that in 1925 there was a potato club in Canisteo, with a membership of 32 boys and the support of the Erie Railroad and &quot;the state school of agriculture at Alfred&quot;.

In 1892, 20 arc lights were installed for street illumination.

A business directory of 1893 reports that: Canisteo &quot;has a bank, weekly newspaper, four churches, well-equipped fire department, three hotels, and a first-class academy. Very few villages of its size have the industries equal to this place. The principal ones are the manufacturing of doors, sash and blinds, boots and shoes, leather, fence wire, incandescent lamps, hubs and spokes, washing machines, etc.&quot;

In 1898 Canisteo got gas from Hornell for heating, after an earlier experiment in generating it in Canisteo.

===20th century===
Canisteo got telephone service about 1902. It got dial service about 1950; the original building, on Fifth St., is still (2015) in use. Numbers were four digits, beginning with 2- or 4-, and the only pay phone in town, in the school, with 8-. However, it was an isolated island until the commercial center of Hornell got dial service in 1963. To call Hornell, one dialed 3- for a Hornell operator. This is probably a reason why Hornell&#x27;s exchange, 324, begins with a 3-. The only other dialable location was the hamlet of Cameron, whose exchange was accessed by dialing 5-, perhaps reflected in Cameron&#x27;s exchange (607) 695-.

Presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan spoke in Canisteo in 1924.

To create parking for downtown merchants, in the 1950s The Green, Canisteo&#x27;s central park, between East Main, Greenwood, South Main, and Maple Streets, was sacrificed. It had had an old-fashioned, huge drinking fountain; older photos show a small bandstand.

==Businesses and industries==

A number of small manufacturing establishments existed along Depot Street in the nineteenth century; there were 10 factories in Canisteo in 1873. These included the Voorhis planing mill, a site later taken over by the Canisteo Sash &amp; Door Company in 1885. These were located at the site of the present Canisteo trailer park (which replaced a waste materials company that occupied the site after the factory&#x27;s closure). The Henry Carter and Son foundry, founded in 1873, renamed the Canisteo Steam Power Company, manufactured steam engines and many other metal products. In 1890, it employed 10 men.

The Tucker button factory was also located on Depot Street. In 1908 the factory was occupied by the Thomas Spring &amp; Gear Company, which manufactured shock absorbers for Ford cars, using an invention patented by Charles L. Thomas of Canisteo.

Other manufacturers included the Canisteo Silk Mill, on Russell St., which in the 1920s had 200 employees and was the only such factory in the country. There was also a small sawmill, on Third St.; and Scott&#x27;s Dairy, a milk processor, located on Depot St. near the rail line. Scott&#x27;s had a small ice cream shop on the north side of West Main St.

For more information on and pictures of Canisteo&#x27;s industries, and the fires which destroyed several of them, see Virginia Dickey&#x27;s &quot;The Canisteo of the 1890s&quot;.

Between 1894 and 1935, the offices, repair shop, and depot of the New York &amp; Pennsylvania Railroad were located in Canisteo, where, until 1917, when passenger service was discontinued, there was also a staffed station, on the east side of the central park. On the west side of the central park was a stop of the Hornell Traction Company.

The Canisteo Theater, which closed in the 1950s, was a brick building on the west side of Greenwood St., demolished around 2000.

The only significant industry in Canisteo today is the Welles Bros. sign factory, which began operations in 1955 from a leased building, now (2015) abandoned, on Fifth Street; in 1967 it moved to its present (2015) building at 92 Depot St.

==Newspapers==
*The &quot;Canisteo Reporter&quot; was being published in 1873, according to a map of that date. Editor and proprietor was J. D. Adams.
*The &quot;Canisteo Citizen&quot; was published from 1874 to 1875. Editor and proprietor was J. S. van Alstin. The Kanestio Historical Society has a copy of Volume 1, No. 2, dated March 11, 1874.
*The &quot;Canisteo Times&quot;, &quot;an independent family journal, devoted to home interests&quot;, was published from 1875 to 1889. Editor and publisher was A. H. Bunnell. Another source says: &quot;The &quot;Times&quot; was established in 1876 by S. H. Jennings and in April, 1886, was sold to F. B. Smith, who conducted it with ability and success.&quot; From 1889 to 1892 it was the &quot;Canisteo Weekly Times&quot;, &quot;devoted to the interests of Canisteo first, last and all the time&quot;, and was edited and published by Frank B. Smith and Frank A. Fay. &quot;In April, 1892, Mr. Frank A. Fay become the editor and publisher and made it the Prohibition organ of Steuben County. It attained a wide circulation and exerted a powerful influence in promulgating temperance and good order... On account of poor health, in January, 1900, he disposed of his interest in the Times to J. C. Latham, who is now its editor and proprietor. It is now published in the interest of the Republican party; has twelve pages, and is issued weekly.&quot; The &quot;Canisteo Times&quot; continued to be published until 1957, from an office and small plant on the west side of Depot Street. Descendants of J.C. Latham were the publishers.
*In 1892 Fay resumed publication of the &quot;Canisteo Times&quot;, which was acquired by J. Claude Latham and became the weekly &quot;Times-Republican&quot; from 1900–1908.
* &quot;The &quot;Canisteo Tidings&quot;, at its inception in 1890, was published at Troupsburg, Steuben County, as &quot;The Farmers&#x27; Weekly&quot;, by Elmer E. Reynolds. The plant and paper were removed to Canisteo in 1894. It was last published by James N. Osincup and Clarence C. Potter, but it did not retain its patronage in the locality where it was established, and is not now [1896] in circulation.&quot;
*The weekly &quot;Canisteo Chronicle&quot; &quot;was born in 1900, to Leon Hough, a grandson of Edwin Hough, the famous old printer, founder and long-time editor and publisher of the &quot;Hornellsville Tribune&quot;, the pioneer newspaper of the upper Painted Post country. The newspaper germ appears to be alive, active and at work in this family. Part of the material, presses and equipment of the formerly vigorous and extensively circulated &quot;Herald&quot;, of Hornell, is used in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; office.&quot; End date is unknown.

The &quot;Canisteo Express&quot; (Addison, 1850), the &quot;Canisteo Valley Journal&quot; (Hornellsville, 1858–1862), and the &quot;Canisteo Valley Times&quot; (Hornellsville, 1867–?) were not published within the current (2020) Town of Canisteo.

== Schools ==
In the Village of Canisteo are located the Canisteo-Greenwood Elementary, Middle, and High Schools. (See Town of Canisteo.)

== Transportation ==
The former Erie Railroad began operations in 1851. The line passed to the east of Canisteo, and passenger service was provided, though ending in the 1940s; the depot stood vacant for decades before being demolished. From 1892 to 1926 the Hornellsville and Canisteo Railway linked Hornell via the Erie depot in Canisteo with the center of Canisteo. It was replaced by bus service, although there have been gaps when no public transportation was available. From 1896 to 1936, the New York &amp; Pennsylvania Railroad (not to be confused with the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railway) started at the depot and ran south toward Rexville.

Around 1900, the Erie Railroad had 10 passenger trains each day, the New York &amp; Pennsylvania had 3, and the trolley had 20. In 1891 the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad had 3 eastbound and 4 westbound trains per day. In 1892, Canisteo was the terminus of the route to Olean of the Central New York and Western Railway, which bought the assets of the bankrupt Lackawanna and Southwestern Railway Company.

== Flood control system ==
The village of Canisteo was severely impacted by the flood of July 1935, until that time the greatest since modern settlement began. Using federal funding, two levees were constructed, one beginning on the northwest of the village, ending on the southeast, protecting it from the Canisteo River. The other was built to the east of the village, protecting it from Bennett&#x27;s Creek and Purdy Creek. Bennett&#x27;s Creek, which formerly ran through the village, about where Bennett St. is now (2019), was rerouted; this added the land with Elm Street, which street does not exist on early maps. The current bridges of Route 36 over Bennett&#x27;s Creek and Route 248 over Purdy Creek were also constructed as part of this project, as was the village&#x27;s sewer system. The only flooding in the village since this construction was a result of Hurricane Agnes, in 1972, at which time the Canisteo River reached its highest recorded height.

== Living sign ==
The village is home of the &quot;world famous living sign&quot; which was once featured in a Ripley&#x27;s &quot;Believe it or Not!&quot; book. The sign spells out the name of the village in Scots Pine trees and has been around for more than fifty years. It is viewable from Greenwood Street near the elementary school. The sign, which has almost a perfect North/South axis, is still used by the armed services to orient true north when flying over it. The Canisteo Living Sign was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

== USS Canisteo ==
A US Navy fleet oil frigate (AO-99) once held the name USS &quot;Canisteo&quot;. It was utilized until the 1990s and even served time as part of the Cuban blockade during the missile crisis of the 1960s. The ship&#x27;s official motto was &quot;If freedom were easy we wouldn&#x27;t be here&quot;. See .

== Steamer Canisteo ==
In the 1890s, a steamer named Canisteo operated on the Great Lakes.

== Canisteo Peninsula, Antarctica ==
The Canisteo Peninsula is an ice-covered peninsula in Antarctica.

<text>Canisteo () is a town in Steuben County, New York, United States. The population was 3,294 at the 2020 census. The name was taken from a former Native American village located there, and is Iroquoian in origin.

The Town of Canisteo is in the western part of the county, southeast of Hornell.

The town contains a village also named Canisteo.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Canisteo&quot; derives from the Seneca language and translates roughly to &quot;board on the water&quot;.

==History==
The Senecas had a major village here called &quot;Kah-nis-ti-oh.&quot; Canisteo is rich in Indian lore.

The first settlers arrived around 1788, making Canisteo one of the earliest locations occupied in the county. A large proportion of the first settlers of Canisteo were from Pennsylvania, since at the time access was primarily via the Susquehanna River; there were no direct links to Albany or New York City.

The town was formed in 1796 at the time of the creation of the county and is one of its original towns.A local writer, in the year 1811, in describing the town of Canisteo says, &quot;it is miles long, north and south, by wide; its area is . The Canisteo River courses centrally across the town, and is boatable from Arkport to Tioga, in the town of Painted Post. Boats descend the Canisteo laden with one thousand bushels of wheat. The settlements are of recent date, and still retain their first local names. At Hornell&#x27;s Mills, on the Canisteo, is a ferry and a road of pretty extensive travel; here is located the Canisteo Post-office.&quot;

Products were shipped via the Canisteo, Chemung, and Susquehanna Rivers to the port of Baltimore.

Hornell was originally a village in the town of Canisteo. From parts of Canisteo came, in whole or part, the Towns of West Union, Hartsville, Hornellsville (1820), Troupsburg (1808, 1818), Greenwood (1827), and Jasper (1837).

The population of Canisteo in 1905 was 3,171.

Residents of Canisteo settled Canisteo Township, Dodge County, Minnesota.

==Living sign==

The Canisteo Living Sign is the largest living sign in the world, noted by both Ripley&#x27;s Believe it or Not! and the Registry of Historical Places. It is by , and consists of Scotch pine. The seeds for it were planted in 1934.

==Business and industry==
The original activities in the town of Canisteo were farming and lumbering; the Canisteo River offered transportation for products.

After arrival of the Erie Railroad in 1851, the Village of Canisteo was home to a variety of small manufacturers.

In the early 21st century Canisteo was the administrative center of the Canisteo Wind Farm, producing electricity from southwestern Steuben County and adjacent areas.

==Schools==
The Town of Canisteo&#x27;s schools are all located in the village of Canisteo.

===One room schools===
Canisteo&#x27;s first school was a one-room school on Greenwood Street, across from the present Baptist Church. A schoolhouse was built in 1826. There were a variety of one-room schools around the township.

===Canisteo Graded School===

The oldest school building, School No. 1 on the 1873 Atlas map, also called Canisteo Graded School and Canisteo Union School, was a wooden frame building at 22 Fifth Street. It began as what would be called today an elementary school. In a news story on the best students of 1893–1894 we see that there were five teachers, all women, plus the male principal, who also taught. Each taught two grades in a single classroom, except for the third grade, which was evidently larger and split into two divisions, which occupied one room. Kindergarten had its own room and two divisions. There were five classrooms, and 11th grade the highest.

In 1900, a report on the &quot;annual school meeting&quot;, held in the &quot;union school building&quot;, reveals that the school would cost $7,947 () to run for the coming year, of which $4,495.32 () would be raised by tax. There were 54 voters at the meeting, which reduced the Board of Education from nine to five members.
After its abandonment in 1914 when the Greenwood Street Elementary School was built, it became Strait&#x27;s Mill, then a feed store, before being torn down about 1952 and replaced by a bus garage. Adjacent to it to the south, between Fifth and Sixth Streets, is the Rotary Field, which remained the venue for school sports until the 1990s, when new facilities were built on Purdy Creek Road.

===Canisteo Academy===
Canisteo Academy was the second high school, at the time called academies, in Steuben County (the first was the long-vanished Addison Academy). It came into legal existence in 1868, and obtained funding to build a brick building on Greenwood Street, which opened in 1871. There was no similar school in Hornellsville (Hornell), Bath, or Corning; in Hornellsville none appears in the records until St. Ann&#x27;s Academic School, in 1894. To reach another academy from Canisteo one had to go northwest, to Alfred, New York, in Allegheny County. The Addison Academy was to the southeast.

Canisteo Academy was founded by Rev. Lewis F. Laine (1806–1891). &quot;It had a very creditable observatory, equipped with a large revolving telescope—the only one in the county.&quot; The New York and Pennsylvania Railroad (1896–1916) crossed Academy St., where it stopped at a platform for student and teacher use. Students came from as far as Pennsylvania, at least . Some stayed during the week in boarding houses.

Students paid tuition until 1897, when it became a free public school. Tuition in 1874 was $10 per term. At that time the following subjects were offered, arranged by school department: Latin, Greek, German, French, and English language; arithmetic, algebra, and geometry; natural philosophy (science), botany, geology, physiology, anatomy, and geography. They were not all taught in every term. In 1901, Regents Exams were given in rhetoric, civics, economics, Caesar (Latin), Virgil (Latin), Xenophon (Greek), and physiology. Principal in 1894 was D. M. Estee, A.M., author of a textbook on government.

A week-long Teachers&#x27; Institute was held at the academy during vacation periods. In 1892, it was held on January 11–15, and again on December 19–23.

===Twentieth-century schools===
An elementary school was built in 1914 just to the south of the academy, replacing the 5th Street building. In 1937, with consolidation of the town schools, the academy building was demolished, as was the Elementary School with the exception of the heating plant, in the rear. A new Canisteo Central School was constructed, attaching to the preserved heating plant portion of the elementary school, constructing a new front and main entrance facing Greenwood Street, connecting with the portion of the building occupying the academy site. This is today (2019) the Canisteo–Greenwood High School. An addition was constructed in 1949, containing a cafeteria, music rooms, and classrooms. In 1959, a new elementary school was constructed further south, at 120 Greenwood Street, including a competition swimming pool. In the vote authorizing the construction, the swimming pool was on the ballot separately, but both passed, the pool by a smaller margin. At present the building houses both the elementary and a middle school. In 2004, the Canisteo schools merged with those of Greenwood to form the Canisteo-Greenwood School District.

Canisteo-Greenwood in 2017 is the only school in Steuben County that has an orchestra as well as a band. The only other orchestra, at Corning Northside in the much larger city of Corning, closed about 1990.


==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 54.4 square miles (140.8 km2), all land.

The Canisteo River flows west to east through the northern part of the town.

New York State Route 248 begins at New York State Route 36 in Canisteo village.
