<text>William Hamilton McWhorter Jordan () (September 21, 1944 – May 20, 2008) was an American politician who served as Chief of Staff to President of the United States Jimmy Carter.

==Early life==

Jordan was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, the son of Adelaide (McWhorter) and Richard Lawton Jordan. He grew up in Albany, Georgia. He attended the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia, where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. Jordan graduated with an A.B. in political science in 1967. After being disqualified from military service due to leg problems, he worked as a civilian volunteer in Vietnam during the war there, assisting refugees.

==Political career==

In 1970, at the age of 26, Jordan ran Jimmy Carter&#x27;s successful gubernatorial campaign, which included a Democratic primary election fight against former Governor Carl Sanders and a less eventful general election against the Republican Hal Suit. While serving as Governor Carter&#x27;s executive assistant, Jordan wrote a lengthy memorandum detailing a strategy for winning the 1976 Democratic Primary. Years later, Jordan&#x27;s memo served as the &quot;game plan&quot; for Carter&#x27;s 1976 presidential bid.

Jordan was a key advisor and strategist for Carter during the 1976 presidential campaign and during Carter&#x27;s administration, serving as White House Chief of Staff in 1979–1980 (Carter, who took office in 1977, had previously not seen the need formally to appoint an aide to such a post). Jordan played a powerful role in the formulation of election strategies and government policies. 

In 1976 Jordan&#x27;s youth and casual style gave him a media reputation as a fun-loving, partying, unsophisticated &quot;good ole boy.&quot; This turned into a problem during the last year of the Carter administration, when Jordan became a lightning rod for critics of the president across the political spectrum. The media repeated rumors of coarse and even criminal behavior by Jordan, including supposed cocaine usage and anonymous sex at the infamous Studio 54 disco in New York City. Though extensive legal investigations failed to substantiate any of the rumors, Jordan later recalled this as a particularly painful time in his life.

According to one often repeated story from this period, Jordan stared at the breasts of the Egyptian ambassador&#x27;s wife at a Washington reception and remarked, &quot;I have always wanted to see the pyramids&quot;. The story was told in various versions, all based on anonymous sources. Jordan denied it ever took place in his memoir &quot;No Such Thing as a Bad Day&quot;. CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite later recalled that the network&#x27;s coverage of the cocaine allegations against Jordan was the &quot;worst story he had ever broadcast.&quot;

(Jordan&#x27;s associate, Timothy Kraft, the 1980 Carter campaign manager, was accused of cocaine use at a party in New Orleans and left the campaign some five weeks before the general election. He was cleared in 1981 by special prosecutor Gerald J. Gallinghouse, a Republican former U.S. Attorney who had earlier prosecuted corruption in the Louisiana state government.)
In 1986, Jordan ran for the Democratic nomination for one of Georgia&#x27;s seats in the United States Senate. He lost the primary to Representative Wyche Fowler, who went on to win the general election against the Republican incumbent Mack Mattingly.
In 1992, he became a high-level staffer on the presidential campaign of independent candidate Ross Perot. In later years he served both as a member of the founders council and as an important public advocate for Unity08, a political movement focused on reforming the American two party system.

Jordan was portrayed by Kyle Chandler in the 2012 film &quot;Argo&quot;.

==Later life==
Jordan was chief executive of the Association of Tennis Professionals when they took control of the professional men&#x27;s world tennis tour in 1990, replacing the Men&#x27;s Tennis Council. His nephew, R. Lawton Jordan, served as Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs during Bill Clinton&#x27;s administration. Jordan authored the book &quot;No Such Thing as a Bad Day&quot; in 2000.

==Personal life==
He and his wife Dorothy, a pediatric oncology nurse, founded a camp for children with cancer – Camp Sunshine – and a camp for children with diabetes – Camp Kudzu – in Georgia. He was an honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. An earlier marriage, to Nancy Konigsmark, ended in divorce.

His son, Hamilton Jordan Jr., is a member of the experimental metal band Genghis Tron. His two other children, Kathleen and Alex, both attended Kenyon College. Alex, Kathleen and Hamilton Jr. helped to complete their father&#x27;s memoir about growing up in the 1950s South, &quot;A Boy From Georgia&quot;. Jordan wrote about 90% of the work, with Kathleen, a TV/film comedy executive, penning the balance. Jordan&#x27;s original title for the memoir was &quot;Meet the Gottheimers&quot;, a reference to the fact that he had discovered, not until he was in college, that his maternal grandmother had been Jewish. The memoir was submitted to possible publishers, with the University of Georgia Press announcing in 2015 that it would publish the book that fall.

==Death==
Jordan died on May 20, 2008, aged 63, from peritoneal mesothelioma, which he believed resulted from his exposure to asbestos during his volunteer service in Vietnam. He had survived several other forms of cancer earlier in his life, including diffuse histiocytic non-Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, and prostate cancer.

<text>Gwenda Thomas (born 22 January 1942 in Neath) is a Welsh Labour politician who served as Member of the Welsh Assembly for Neath from the Assembly&#x27;s start in 1999 to 2016. Thomas was first elected to the National Assembly for Wales in 1999 and re-elected in 2003, having almost doubled her majority.

==Background==
Thomas was educated at Pontardawe Grammar School, she lives in Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen. Thomas was married to her late husband Morgan (1939-2013) for nearly 50 years, and they have one son, Geraint and a granddaughter, Charlotte.

She is a fluent Welsh speaker. She is a member of the GMB Union. She worked in the County Courts Division of the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department and at the Benefits Agency as an executive officer for many years.

On 10 January 2017 she received an honorary doctorate from Swansea University.

Mrs Thomas is a campaigner for carers&#x27; rights and a past member of the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s advisory committee. Her interests include health, social services, children&#x27;s issues, local government and the voluntary sector.

== Political Career ==

=== Local Government ===
Mrs Thomas served on West Glamorgan County Council as chair of the Social Services Committee - the first female councillor to chair such a major committee. She later served in the same position on Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council following local government reorganisation in 1995.

=== National Assembly for Wales ===
Thomas was selected to contest the Neath constituency for the new National Assembly for Wales in January of 1999. She was elected in the first Welsh Assembly elections later that year with a majority of 2,618 votes, with Plaid Cymru significantly outperforming prior Westminster election results to limit her majority to that. She was re-elected again at the 2003 elections with a majority of 4,946, 2007 elections with a reduced majority of 1,944 and 2011 elections with her largest majority of 6,390. In 2016, she stood down from the role, and Jeremy Miles was selected to replace her as AM for Neath.

Thomas chaired the First Assembly&#x27;s Local Government and Housing committee. In the second assembly, she chaired the Equality of Opportunity Committee and sat on the Assembly&#x27;s Standards Committee. She was also appointed in December 2003 by the First Minister Rhodri Morgan, to chair a review into safeguarding vulnerable children in Wales. The review&#x27;s report - &quot;Keeping Us Safe&quot; - was published on 3 May 2006. 

Shortly after being re-elected to the Third Assembly, she was appointed as a Deputy Minister under the Minister for Health and Social Services, with responsibility for Social Services. She retained the role of Deputy Minister for Social Services after the coalition between Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru was formed a month later, and when Rhodri Morgan was replaced as First Minister by Carwyn Jones.

In the Fourth Assembly, she held the position of Deputy Minister for Children and Social Services, with her responsibilities amongst others being childcare, child trust funds and parenting programmes. She was removed from the cabinet in a September 2014 reshuffle. 

In 2015, Thomas confirmed that she was intending to stand down at the 2016 Welsh Assembly election. Jeremy Miles was selected to replace her and contest the Neath constituency in October 2015.

<doc id="256639" wikidata="Q170996" url="?curid=256639" title="Galați">
<text>Galați ( , , ; also known by other alternative names) is the capital city of Galați County in the historical region of Western Moldavia, in eastern Romania. Galați is a port town on the Danube River. and the sixth largest of all cities on the Danube river. According to the 2021 census it is the 8th most populous city in Romania. Galați is an economic centre based around the port of Galați, the naval shipyard, and the largest steel factory in Romania, Galați steel works.
==Etymology and names==
The name &quot;Galați&quot; is derived from the Cuman word . This word is ultimately borrowed from the Persian word , &quot;fortress&quot;. Other etymologies have been suggested, such as the Serbian . However, the &quot;galat&quot; root appears in nearby toponyms, some of which show clearly a Cuman origin, for example Gălățui Lake, which has the typical Cuman -&quot;ui&quot; suffix for &quot;water&quot;. Another toponym in the region is Galicia, with its town of Halych, locally associated with the jackdaw (Kawka, Halka). Before the Mongol invasion of Rus, Galați was known as Malyi Halych (Little Halych) as part of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia. Other similar place names are Galich, Russia and Galatia in Turkey. 
Galați has several exonyms: ; (also an archaic English term); ; ; ; ; ; and .

==History==
===Ancient origins===
Archeological evidence points to occupation of the region in the neolithic period. For example, north west of the town of Galați, on the eastern shores of the Malina marshes, fragments of ceramic-type Stoicani Aldeni, stilex and tools made of bone have been found. A stone sceptre, from the late Bronze Age, belonging to the Coslogeni culture was found on the marshes&#x27; southern bank. Galați town itself developed from an ancient Dacian settlement of the sixth and fifth centuries BCE where there was a ford across the Danube river. In 101 to 102 and 105 to 106, the Dacians fought wars against the Romans and the area became part of the Roman empire. A strong Roman fortress was built at Barboși to defend the ford across Danube. From the 300s a Daco-Roman settlement developed at a ford south of the site of the Church of the Virgin.

===Medieval period===
There is evidence of continuous inhabitation of Galați since the 600s. A treasure hoard consisting of 12 silver coins issued between 613 and 685 was found in a Byzantine tomb near the Church of the Virgin. Western and Byzantine coins from the time of Emperor Michael IV (1034–1041) were also found. At one time , the city became part of the Republic of Genoa Territories and was called &quot;Caladda&quot;. In 1445, a document signed by Stephen II of Moldavia mentions Galați. In 1484, Chilia was conquered by Ottomans. Galați township remained Moldova&#x27;s only port, not only for domestic trade but also for trade with Turkey and Poland. In 1590, the Galați Jewish cemetery was opened.

===18th century===
====Burial of Hetman Mazeppa====
The Ukrainian folk hero, Ivan Stepanovich Mazeppa was a Hetman who died on 1709 in Varniţa, Bessarabia, and was buried in Galați. Hetman Mazeppa was buried in a brick tomb.

====Battle of Stănilești====
In 1710, Tatars plundered Galați after the Battle of Stănilești.

====Russo-Turkish war====
In 1775, Russia established a consulate in Galați. However, in 1789, during the Russo-Turkish war of 1787–92, Galați was burned by the armies of the Russian general Mikhail Kamensky.

===19th century===
In 1812, following the annexation by Russia of half of the principality, including all of the sea shore and almost all of Danube, Galați ended up as the principality&#x27;s only port.

Due to unrest in this part of Europe, Galați port became a site for the construction of large warships. Abbot Boskov, a Romanian traveller, stated:
:&quot;I saw a large boat, the way those who say Turks caravels, which is on site, ready to be launched into the water. He was commissioned by Isaac-aga, big tax collector of Constantinople. The ship was huge, seventeen seventy steps, and loaded with eighty-four bronze cannons.&quot;

====Massacre of 1821====
In the Greek–Turkish war of 1821, Ottoman subjects were killed in Galați (and in other towns). This was the result of a series of rebellions by members of the port workers&#x27; association and city clerks. 

====Growth through trade====
Despite the wars and unrest, Galați developed based on trade (especially grain exports). In 1805, France and England established vice-consulates. In 1832, the School of the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel is founded. Two years later, in 1834, Austrian ships were having scheduled arrivals and in 1837, Galați was declared a free port (this was revoked in 1882). In 1850, James Buchanan, the U.S. president, sent a vice-consul to Galați and the U.S. opened a consulate in 1858. Galați was also a trading port for German lands. When the Crimean War (1854–1856) finished, Galați became a seat of the Danube European Commission. In 1869, the Mihai Eminescu municipal park opened and by 1870, factories were opening. By, 1908 they numbered 41. On 13 September 1872, the King Charles I railway station and northern city rail tunnel opened. The River station opened shortly after on 24 September 1880. In 1889, the V. A. Urechia library opened.

====Growth through unity====
After the union of the Romanian principalities in 1859, with Alexandru Ioan Cuza as leader, development in Galați increased. Zeletin wrote,
:&quot;The birth of the modern Romanian state must distinguish two main currents – one exuberant but superficial, based on liberal ideas which depart from Paris to Bucharest and Iași. The other is quieter but deep, leaving from London to Galați and Brăila: English is the current capitalist economy.&quot; (&quot;Romanian Bourgeoisie&quot;, Zeletin, Stephen.) 

===1900–1947===

Between 1900 and the beginning of World War I, Galați continued its trade in grain and timber with sixteen consulates. Galați was part of Covurlui County.

In 1907, social unrest among the peasant classes precipitated intervention by the Romanian army. In 1911, a statue of the poet Mihai Eminescu was erected.

====World War I====

Galați remained under Romanian control during World War I. Romanian soldiers fought alongside those of Russia against the army of the Central Powers. Galați was bombed by retreating Russian troops in January 1918.

====Interwar period====
In 1919, a high school for Jewish students opened. A first air race between Galați and Bucharest was held in 1926 following the end of the construction of the Galați Airport. The 1930 Romanian census recorded 100,000 residents in Galați. After Bucharest, Chișinău, Iași and Cernăuți, Galați was Romania&#x27;s fifth city. In 1938, the Ținutul Dunării de Jos (Lower Danube Land) was established.

====World war II====
During World War II, Galați was bombed by the Soviet Air Forces and Luftwaffe. The railway station, inaugurated on 13 September 1872, was destroyed as were many other historic buildings and most of the old town. On 27 August 1944, Galați was captured by Soviet troops of the 3rd Ukrainian Front in the course of the Jassy–Kishinev Offensive.

====Jewish community====
Before World War II Galați hosted 22 synagogues and in 1926, it was the base for the Zionist Revisionist Organization of Romania. Although Galați&#x27;s Jewish community suffered persecution by the pro-Nazi authorities during World War II, the community was not destroyed in the Holocaust. Since the 1940s the community has gradually diminished through emigration.

===Communist period (1947–1989)===

====Post war rebuilding====
After World War II, Galați was rebuilt along communist lines. The town&#x27;s population was about 80,000. In 1956, a proposal to join Brăila and Galați was made and the building of a speed tram pier was proposed with a Swiss company. The plans never materialized. In 1958, the Galați Airport was abolished. Construction of the Galați steel works began in 1960 and the plant opened in 1966. The population at this time was 151,000. In 1971, the Făurei – Galați railway capacity was increased, and, in 1982, it was electrified.

====Mogoșoaia boating tragedy====
On September 11, 1989, a Bulgarian ship collided with a cruise ship near Galați. 151 passengers and crew died (all but sixteen).

===Contemporary period===
In 2004, Romania&#x27;s first information technology park opened in Galați.

====2005 flood====
On 14 July 2005, Galați was affected by widespread flooding. The Siret river reached record levels and across Romania, the death toll reached 21. In 2010, broken flood barriers caused flooding of the Valley City area of Galați.

==Geography==

<text>Plant hormones (or phytohormones) are signal molecules, produced within plants, that occur in extremely low concentrations. Plant hormones control all aspects of plant growth and development, including embryogenesis, the regulation of organ size, pathogen defense, stress tolerance and reproductive development. Unlike in animals (in which hormone production is restricted to specialized glands) each plant cell is capable of producing hormones. Went and Thimann coined the term &quot;phytohormone&quot; and used it in the title of their 1937 book.

Phytohormones occur across the plant kingdom, and even in algae, where they have similar functions to those seen in vascular plants (&quot;higher plants&quot;). Some phytohormones also occur in microorganisms, such as unicellular fungi and bacteria, however in these cases they do not play a hormonal role and can better be regarded as secondary metabolites.

==Characteristics==

The word hormone is derived from Greek, meaning &quot;set in motion&quot;. Plant hormones affect gene expression and transcription levels, cellular division, and growth. They are naturally produced within plants, though very similar chemicals are produced by fungi and bacteria that can also affect plant growth. A large number of related chemical compounds are synthesized by humans. They are used to regulate the growth of cultivated plants, weeds, and in vitro-grown plants and plant cells; these manmade compounds are called plant growth regulators (PGRs). Early in the study of plant hormones, &quot;phytohormone&quot; was the commonly used term, but its use is less widely applied now.

Plant hormones are not nutrients, but chemicals that in small amounts promote and influence the growth, development, and differentiation of cells and tissues. The biosynthesis of plant hormones within plant tissues is often diffuse and not always localized. Plants lack glands to produce and store hormones, because, unlike animals—which have two circulatory systems (lymphatic and cardiovascular) —plants use more passive means to move chemicals around their bodies. Plants utilize simple chemicals as hormones, which move more easily through their tissues. They are often produced and used on a local basis within the plant body. Plant cells produce hormones that affect even different regions of the cell producing the hormone.

Hormones are transported within the plant by utilizing four types of movements. For localized movement, cytoplasmic streaming within cells and slow diffusion of ions and molecules between cells are utilized. Vascular tissues are used to move hormones from one part of the plant to another; these include sieve tubes or phloem that move sugars from the leaves to the roots and flowers, and xylem that moves water and mineral solutes from the roots to the foliage.

Not all plant cells respond to hormones, but those cells that do are programmed to respond at specific points in their growth cycle. The greatest effects occur at specific stages during the cell&#x27;s life, with diminished effects occurring before or after this period. Plants need hormones at very specific times during plant growth and at specific locations. They also need to disengage the effects that hormones have when they are no longer needed. The production of hormones occurs very often at sites of active growth within the meristems, before cells have fully differentiated. After production, they are sometimes moved to other parts of the plant, where they cause an immediate effect; or they can be stored in cells to be released later. Plants use different pathways to regulate internal hormone quantities and moderate their effects; they can regulate the amount of chemicals used to biosynthesize hormones. They can store them in cells, inactivate them, or cannibalise already-formed hormones by conjugating them with carbohydrates, amino acids, or peptides. Plants can also break down hormones chemically, effectively destroying them. Plant hormones frequently regulate the concentrations of other plant hormones. Plants also move hormones around the plant diluting their concentrations.

The concentration of hormones required for plant responses are very low (10−6 to 10−5 mol/L). Because of these low concentrations, it has been very difficult to study plant hormones, and only since the late 1970s have scientists been able to start piecing together their effects and relationships to plant physiology. Much of the early work on plant hormones involved studying plants that were genetically deficient in one or involved the use of tissue-cultured plants grown &quot;in vitro&quot; that were subjected to differing ratios of hormones, and the resultant growth compared. The earliest scientific observation and study dates to the 1880s; the determination and observation of plant hormones and their identification was spread out over the next 70 years.

Synergism in plant hormones refers to the how of two or more hormones result in an effect that is more than the individual effects. For example, auxins and cytokinins often act in cooperation during cellular division and differentiation. Both hormones are key to cell cycle regulation, but when they come together, their synergistic interactions can enhance cell proliferation and organogenesis more effectively than either could in isolation.

==Classes==
Different hormones can be sorted into different classes, depending on their chemical structures. Within each class of hormone, chemical structures can vary, but all members of the same class have similar physiological effects. Initial research into plant hormones identified five major classes: abscisic acid, auxins, brassinosteroids, cytokinins and ethylene. This list was later expanded, and brassinosteroids, jasmonates, salicylic acid, and strigolactones are now also considered major plant hormones. Additionally there are several other compounds that serve functions similar to the major hormones, but their status as &quot;bona fide&quot; hormones is still debated.

===Abscisic acid===

Abscisic acid (also called ABA) is one of the most important plant growth inhibitors. It was discovered and researched under two different names, &quot;dormin&quot; and &quot;abscicin II&quot;, before its chemical properties were fully known. Once it was determined that the two compounds are the same, it was named abscisic acid. The name refers to the fact that it is found in high concentrations in newly abscissed or freshly fallen leaves.

This class of PGR is composed of one chemical compound normally produced in the leaves of plants, originating from chloroplasts, especially when plants are under stress. In general, it acts as an inhibitory chemical compound that affects bud growth, and seed and bud dormancy. It mediates changes within the apical meristem, causing bud dormancy and the alteration of the last set of leaves into protective bud covers. Since it was found in freshly abscissed leaves, it was initially thought to play a role in the processes of natural leaf drop, but further research has disproven this. In plant species from temperate parts of the world, abscisic acid plays a role in leaf and seed dormancy by inhibiting growth, but, as it is dissipated from seeds or buds, growth begins. In other plants, as ABA levels decrease, growth then commences as gibberellin levels increase. Without ABA, buds and seeds would start to grow during warm periods in winter and would be killed when it froze again. Since ABA dissipates slowly from the tissues and its effects take time to be offset by other plant hormones, there is a delay in physiological pathways that provides some protection from premature growth. Abscisic acid accumulates within seeds during fruit maturation, preventing seed germination within the fruit or before winter. Abscisic acid&#x27;s effects are degraded within plant tissues during cold temperatures or by its removal by water washing in and out of the tissues, releasing the seeds and buds from dormancy.

ABA exists in all parts of the plant, and its concentration within any tissue seems to mediate its effects and function as a hormone; its degradation, or more properly catabolism, within the plant affects metabolic reactions and cellular growth and production of other hormones. Plants start life as a seed with high ABA levels. Just before the seed germinates, ABA levels decrease; during germination and early growth of the seedling, ABA levels decrease even more. As plants begin to produce shoots with fully functional leaves, ABA levels begin to increase again, slowing down cellular growth in more &quot;mature&quot; areas of the plant. Stress from water or predation affects ABA production and catabolism rates, mediating another cascade of effects that trigger specific responses from targeted cells. Scientists are still piecing together the complex interactions and effects of this and other phytohormones.

In plants under water stress, ABA plays a role in closing the stomata. Soon after plants are water-stressed and the roots are deficient in water, a signal moves up to the leaves, causing the formation of ABA precursors there, which then move to the roots. The roots then release ABA, which is translocated to the foliage through the vascular system and modulates potassium and sodium uptake within the guard cells, which then lose turgidity, closing the stomata.

===Auxins===

Auxins are compounds that positively influence cell enlargement, bud formation, and root initiation. They also promote the production of other hormones and, in conjunction with cytokinins, control the growth of stems, roots, and fruits, and convert stems into flowers. Auxins were the first class of growth regulators discovered.
A Dutch Biologist Frits Warmolt Went first described auxins. They affect cell elongation by altering cell wall plasticity. They stimulate cambium, a subtype of meristem cells, to divide, and in stems cause secondary xylem to differentiate.

Auxins act to inhibit the growth of buds lower down the stems in a phenomenon known as apical dominance, and also to promote lateral and adventitious root development and growth. Leaf abscission is initiated by the growing point of a plant ceasing to produce auxins. Auxins in seeds regulate specific protein synthesis, as they develop within the flower after pollination, causing the flower to develop a fruit to contain the developing seeds.

In large concentrations, auxins are often toxic to plants; they are most toxic to dicots and less so to monocots. Because of this property, synthetic auxin herbicides including 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) have been developed and used for weed control by defoliation. Auxins, especially 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), are also commonly applied to stimulate root growth when taking cuttings of plants. The most common auxin found in plants is indole-3-acetic acid (IAA).

===Brassinosteroids===

Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of polyhydroxysteroids, the only example of steroid-based hormones in plants. Brassinosteroids control cell elongation and division, gravitropism, resistance to stress, and xylem differentiation. They inhibit root growth and leaf abscission. Brassinolide was the first brassinosteroid to be identified and was isolated from extracts of rapeseed (&quot;Brassica napus&quot;) pollen in 1979. Brassinosteroids are a class of steroidal phytohormones in plants that regulate numerous physiological processes. This plant hormone was identified by Mitchell et al. who extracted ingredients from Brassica pollen only to find that the extracted ingredients’ main active component was Brassinolide. This finding meant the discovery of a new class of plant hormones called Brassinosteroids. These hormones act very similarly to animal steroidal hormones by promoting growth and development.

In plants these steroidal hormones play an important role in cell elongation via BR signaling. The brassinosteroids receptor brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (BRI1) is the main receptor for this signaling pathway. This BRI1 receptor was found by Clouse et al. who made the discovery by inhibiting BR and comparing it to the wildtype in Arabidopsis. The BRI1 mutant displayed several problems associated with growth and development such as dwarfism, reduced cell elongation and other physical alterations. These findings mean that plants properly expressing brassinosteroids grow more than their mutant counterparts. Brassinosteroids bind to BRI1 localized at the plasma membrane which leads to a signal cascade that further regulates cell elongation. This signal cascade however is not entirely understood at this time. What is believed to be happening is that BR binds to the BAK1 complex which leads to a phosphorylation cascade. This phosphorylation cascade then causes BIN2 to be deactivated which causes the release of transcription factors. These released transcription factors then bind to DNA that leads to growth and developmental processes and allows plants to respond to abiotic stressors.

===Cytokinins===

Cytokinins (CKs) are a group of chemicals that influence cell division and shoot formation. They also help delay senescence of tissues, are responsible for mediating auxin transport throughout the plant, and affect internodal length and leaf growth. They were called kinins in the past when they were first isolated from yeast cells. Cytokinins and auxins often work together, and the ratios of these two groups of plant hormones affect most major growth periods during a plant&#x27;s lifetime. Cytokinins counter the apical dominance induced by auxins; in conjunction with ethylene, they promote abscission of leaves, flower parts, and fruits.

Among the plant hormones, the three that are known to help with immunological interactions are ethylene (ET), salicylates (SA), and jasmonates (JA), however more research has gone into identifying the role that cytokinins play in this. Evidence suggests that cytokinins delay the interactions with pathogens, showing signs that they could induce resistance toward these pathogenic bacteria. Accordingly, there are higher CK levels in plants that have increased resistance to pathogens compared to those which are more susceptible. For example, pathogen resistance involving cytokinins was tested using the &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; species by treating them with naturally occurring CK (trans-zeatin) to see their response to the bacteria &quot;Pseudomonas syringa&quot;. Tobacco studies reveal that over expression of CK inducing IPT genes yields increased resistance whereas over expression of CK oxidase yields increased susceptibility to pathogen, namely &quot;P. syringae&quot;.

While there’s not much of a relationship between this hormone and physical plant behavior, there are behavioral changes that go on inside the plant in response to it.  Cytokinin defense effects can include the establishment and growth of microbes (delay leaf senescence), reconfiguration of secondary metabolism or even induce the production of new organs such as galls or nodules. These organs and their corresponding processes are all used to protect the plants against biotic/abiotic factors.

===Ethylene===
Unlike the other major plant hormones, ethylene is a gas and a very simple organic compound, consisting of just six atoms. It forms through the breakdown of methionine, an amino acid which is in all cells. Ethylene has very limited solubility in water and therefore does not accumulate within the cell, typically diffusing out of the cell and escaping the plant. Its effectiveness as a plant hormone is dependent on its rate of production versus its rate of escaping into the atmosphere. Ethylene is produced at a faster rate in rapidly growing and dividing cells, especially in darkness. New growth and newly germinated seedlings produce more ethylene than can escape the plant, which leads to elevated amounts of ethylene, inhibiting leaf expansion (see hyponastic response).

As the new shoot is exposed to light, reactions mediated by phytochrome in the plant&#x27;s cells produce a signal for ethylene production to decrease, allowing leaf expansion. Ethylene affects cell growth and cell shape; when a growing shoot or root hits an obstacle while underground, ethylene production greatly increases, preventing cell elongation and causing the stem to swell. The resulting thicker stem is stronger and less likely to buckle under pressure as it presses against the object impeding its path to the surface. If the shoot does not reach the surface and the ethylene stimulus becomes prolonged, it affects the stem&#x27;s natural geotropic response, which is to grow upright, allowing it to grow around an object. Studies seem to indicate that ethylene affects stem diameter and height: when stems of trees are subjected to wind, causing lateral stress, greater ethylene production occurs, resulting in thicker, sturdier tree trunks and branches.

Ethylene also affects fruit ripening. Normally, when the seeds are mature, ethylene production increases and builds up within the fruit, resulting in a climacteric event just before seed dispersal. The nuclear protein Ethylene Insensitive2 (EIN2) is regulated by ethylene production, and, in turn, regulates other hormones including ABA and stress hormones. Ethylene diffusion out of plants is strongly inhibited underwater. This increases internal concentrations of the gas. In numerous aquatic and semi-aquatic species (e.g. &quot;Callitriche platycarpus&quot;, rice, and &quot;Rumex palustris&quot;), the accumulated ethylene strongly stimulates upward elongation. This response is an important mechanism for the adaptive escape from submergence that avoids asphyxiation by returning the shoot and leaves to contact with the air whilst allowing the release of entrapped ethylene. At least one species (&quot;Potamogeton pectinatus&quot;) has been found to be incapable of making ethylene while retaining a conventional morphology. This suggests ethylene is a true regulator rather than being a requirement for building a plant&#x27;s basic body plan.

===Gibberellins===

Gibberellins (GAs) include a large range of chemicals that are produced naturally within plants and by fungi. They were first discovered when Japanese researchers, including Eiichi Kurosawa, noticed a chemical produced by a fungus called &quot;Gibberella fujikuroi&quot; that produced abnormal growth in rice plants. It was later discovered that GAs are also produced by the plants themselves and control multiple aspects of development across the life cycle. The synthesis of GA is strongly upregulated in seeds at germination and its presence is required for germination to occur. In seedlings and adults, GAs strongly promote cell elongation. GAs also promote the transition between vegetative and reproductive growth and are also required for pollen function during fertilization.

Gibberellins breaks the dormancy (in active stage) in seeds and buds and helps increasing the height of the plant. It helps in the growth of the stem

===Jasmonates===

Jasmonates (JAs) are lipid-based hormones that were originally isolated from jasmine oil. JAs are especially important in the plant response to attack from herbivores and necrotrophic pathogens. The most active JA in plants is jasmonic acid. Jasmonic acid can be further metabolized into methyl jasmonate (MeJA), which is a volatile organic compound. This unusual property means that MeJA can act as an airborne signal to communicate herbivore attack to other distant leaves within one plant and even as a signal to neighboring plants. In addition to their role in defense, JAs are also believed to play roles in seed germination, the storage of protein in seeds, and root growth.

JAs have been shown to interact in the signalling pathway of other hormones in a mechanism described as “crosstalk.” The hormone classes can have both negative and positive effects on each other&#x27;s signal processes.

Jasmonic acid methyl ester (JAME) has been shown to regulate genetic expression in plants. They act in signalling pathways in response to herbivory, and upregulate expression of defense genes. Jasmonyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) accumulates in response to herbivory, which causes an upregulation in defense gene expression by freeing up transcription factors.

Jasmonate mutants are more readily consumed by herbivores than wild type plants, indicating that JAs play an important role in the execution of plant defense. When herbivores are moved around leaves of wild type plants, they reach similar masses to herbivores that consume only mutant plants, implying the effects of JAs are localized to sites of herbivory. Studies have shown that there is significant crosstalk between defense pathways.

===Salicylic acid===

Salicylic acid (SA) is a hormone with a structure related to benzoic acid and phenol. It was originally isolated from an extract of white willow bark (&quot;Salix alba&quot;) and is of great interest to human medicine, as it is the precursor of the painkiller aspirin. In plants, SA plays a critical role in the defense against biotrophic pathogens. In a similar manner to JA, SA can also become methylated. Like MeJA, methyl salicylate is volatile and can act as a long-distance signal to neighboring plants to warn of pathogen attack. In addition to its role in defense, SA is also involved in the response of plants to abiotic stress, particularly from drought, extreme temperatures, heavy metals, and osmotic stress.

Salicylic acid (SA) serves as a key hormone in plant innate immunity, including resistance in both local and systemic tissue upon biotic attacks, hypersensitive responses, and cell death. Some of the SA influences on plants include seed germination, cell growth, respiration, stomatal closure, senescence-associated gene expression, responses to abiotic and biotic stresses, basal thermo tolerance and fruit yield. A possible role of salicylic acid in signaling disease resistance was first demonstrated by injecting leaves of resistant tobacco with SA. The result was that injecting SA stimulated pathogenesis related (PR) protein accumulation and enhanced resistance to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection. Exposure to pathogens causes a cascade of reactions in the plant cells. SA biosynthesis is increased via isochorismate synthase (ICS) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) pathway in plastids. It was observed that during plant-microbe interactions, as part of the defense mechanisms, SA is initially accumulated at the local infected tissue and then spread all over the plant to induce systemic acquired resistance at non-infected distal parts of the plant. Therefore with increased internal concentration of  SA, plants were able to build resistant barriers for pathogens and other adverse environmental conditions

===Strigolactones===

Strigolactones (SLs) were originally discovered through studies of the germination of the parasitic weed &quot;Striga lutea&quot;. It was found that the germination of &quot;Striga&quot; species was stimulated by the presence of a compound exuded by the roots of its host plant. It was later shown that SLs that are exuded into the soil also promote the growth of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. More recently, another role of SLs was identified in the inhibition of shoot branching. This discovery of the role of SLs in shoot branching led to a dramatic increase in the interest in these hormones, and it has since been shown that SLs play important roles in leaf senescence, phosphate starvation response, salt tolerance, and light signalling.

===Other known hormones===
Other identified plant growth regulators include:
* Plant peptide hormones – encompasses all small secreted peptides that are involved in cell-to-cell signaling. These small peptide hormones play crucial roles in plant growth and development, including defense mechanisms, the control of cell division and expansion, and pollen self-incompatibility. The small peptide CLE25 is known to act as a long-distance signal to communicate water stress sensed in the roots to the stomata in the leaves.
* Polyamines – are strongly basic molecules with low molecular weight that have been found in all organisms studied thus far. They are essential for plant growth and development and affect the process of mitosis and meiosis. In plants, polyamines have been linked to the control of senescence and programmed cell death.
* Nitric oxide (NO) – serves as signal in hormonal and defense responses (e.g. stomatal closure, root development, germination, nitrogen fixation, cell death, stress response). NO can be produced by a yet undefined NO synthase, a special type of nitrite reductase, nitrate reductase, mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase or non enzymatic processes and regulate plant cell organelle functions (e.g. ATP synthesis in chloroplasts and mitochondria).
* Karrikins – are not plant hormones as they are not produced by plants themselves but are rather found in the smoke of burning plant material. Karrikins can promote seed germination in many species. The finding that plants which lack the receptor of karrikin receptor show several developmental phenotypes (enhanced biomass accumulation and increased sensitivity to drought) have led some to speculate on the existence of an as yet unidentified karrikin-like endogenous hormone in plants. The cellular karrikin signalling pathway shares many components with the strigolactone signalling pathway.
* Triacontanol – a fatty alcohol that acts as a growth stimulant, especially initiating new basal breaks in the rose family. It is found in alfalfa (lucerne), bee&#x27;s wax, and some waxy leaf cuticles.

==Use in horticulture==
Synthetic plant hormones or PGRs are used in a number of different techniques involving plant propagation from cuttings, grafting, micropropagation and tissue culture. Most commonly they are commercially available as &quot;rooting hormone powder&quot;.

The propagation of plants by cuttings of fully developed leaves, stems, or roots is performed by gardeners utilizing auxin as a rooting compound applied to the cut surface; the auxins are taken into the plant and promote root initiation. In grafting, auxin promotes callus tissue formation, which joins the surfaces of the graft together. In micropropagation, different PGRs are used to promote multiplication and then rooting of new plantlets. In the tissue-culturing of plant cells, PGRs are used to produce callus growth, multiplication, and rooting.

When used in field conditions, plant hormones or mixtures that include them can be applied as biostimulants.

===Seed dormancy===

Plant hormones affect seed germination and dormancy by acting on different parts of the seed.

Embryo dormancy is characterized by a high ABA:GA ratio, whereas the seed has high abscisic acid sensitivity and low GA sensitivity. In order to release the seed from this type of dormancy and initiate seed germination, an alteration in hormone biosynthesis and degradation toward a low ABA/GA ratio, along with a decrease in ABA sensitivity and an increase in GA sensitivity, must occur.

ABA controls embryo dormancy, and GA embryo germination.
Seed coat dormancy involves the mechanical restriction of the seed coat. This, along with a low embryo growth potential, effectively produces seed dormancy. GA releases this dormancy by increasing the embryo growth potential, and/or weakening the seed coat so the radical of the seedling can break through the seed coat.
Different types of seed coats can be made up of living or dead cells, and both types can be influenced by hormones; those composed of living cells are acted upon after seed formation, whereas the seed coats composed of dead cells can be influenced by hormones during the formation of the seed coat. ABA affects testa or seed coat growth characteristics, including thickness, and effects the GA-mediated embryo growth potential. These conditions and effects occur during the formation of the seed, often in response to environmental conditions. Hormones also mediate endosperm dormancy: Endosperm in most seeds is composed of living tissue that can actively respond to hormones generated by the embryo. The endosperm often acts as a barrier to seed germination, playing a part in seed coat dormancy or in the germination process. Living cells respond to and also affect the ABA:GA ratio, and mediate cellular sensitivity; GA thus increases the embryo growth potential and can promote endosperm weakening. GA also affects both ABA-independent and ABA-inhibiting processes within the endosperm.

==Human use==

===Salicylic acid===
Willow bark has been used for centuries as a painkiller. The active ingredient in willow bark that provides these effects is the hormone salicylic acid (SA). In 1899, the pharmaceutical company Bayer began marketing a derivative of SA as the drug aspirin. In addition to its use as a painkiller, SA is also used in topical treatments of several skin conditions, including acne, warts and psoriasis. Another derivative of SA, sodium salicylate has been found to suppress proliferation of lymphoblastic leukemia, prostate, breast, and melanoma human cancer cells.

===Jasmonic acid===
Jasmonic acid (JA) can induce death in lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Methyl jasmonate (a derivative of JA, also found in plants) has been shown to inhibit proliferation in a number of cancer cell lines, although there is still debate over its use as an anti-cancer drug, due to its potential negative effects on healthy cells.

<text>Sizaire et Naudin was a French automobile manufacturer located on the northern side of central Paris, at 52 rue Victor-Hugo in Courbevoie, between 1903 and 1921.

==The company==

Sizaire-Naudin was founded by two brothers called Maurice (1877–1969) and Georges Sizaire (1880–1924), in partnership with a family friend, Louis Naudin (1876–1913) in 1903. The partners had already experimented with a car in 1902 or 1903 but it was not until 1905 that the light &quot;voiturette-style&quot; cars were offered for sale, and shown at the Paris Salon in October of that year.

In 1912 the Sizaire brothers left the company following disagreement with an investor. Their participation in the automotive business was far from ended, however, and in 1913, with the help of F. Berwick, the London-based UK importer of Corre La Licorne cars, they obtained finance in London for the launch of a new automobile manufacturing company called Sizaire-Berwick. Sizaire-Naudin continued for a further decade without them.

==The cars==
The first cars were basic single cylinder vehicles with independent front suspension by sliding pillars and a transverse leaf spring, identical to earlier Decauvilles. A unique gearbox used an integral 3-speed differential – 3 straight cut pinions brought to bear in turn on a single large straight-cut crown wheel.

Orders were good and the company received backing to move to larger premises from bicycle importers Hammond et Monnier who soon afterwards sold the firm to the Duc d&#x27;Uzes and from 1907 the family crest appeared on the radiator surround.

By 1911, the single-cylinder format was regarded as outmoded. After the departure of the Sizaire brothers the technicians at the business switched to a four-cylinder engine, initially using a bought-in 1847 cm3 Ballot unit, but did not result in significantly increased sales.

After the war, production restarted with a new company, Société des Nouveaux Établissements Sizaire et Naudin, making Ballot-engined cars based on prewar designs. The manufacturer took a stand at the Motor Show in October 1919 to exhibit a four-seater torpedo&quot; bodied Type D car with a wheelbase, and powered by a four-cylinder 2292 cm3 engine. This was listed by the manufacturer at 24,000 francs.

In spite of an attempt to re-enter racing at the International Voiturette Cup of 1921, the directors called in the liquidators later that year.

==Racing==
Sizaire et Naudin enjoyed great success in early voiturette races with rules which limited cylinder bore but did not specify stroke length. This success lasted from 1906 to 1909, with some presence in racing until 1911.

<doc id="256643" wikidata="Q4046558" url="?curid=256643" title="Peaches (The Stranglers song)">
<text>&quot;Peaches&quot; is the second single by the Stranglers, taken from their debut studio album &quot;Rattus Norvegicus&quot; (1977). Notable for its distinctive bassline, the track peaked at No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart.

==Lyrics and response==
The lyrics to &quot;Peaches&quot; featured coarse sexual language and innuendo to a degree that was unusual for the time. The song&#x27;s narrator is girl-watching on a crowded beach one hot summer day. It is never made clear if his lascivious thoughts (such as &quot;there goes a girl and a half&quot;) are an interior monologue, comments to his companions, or come-on lines to the attractive women in question. The critic Tom Maginnis wrote that Hugh Cornwell sings with &quot;a lecherous sneer...spill[ing] into macho parody or even censor-baiting territory&quot;.

The single was a double A-side with &quot;Go Buddy Go&quot;. The latter was played on UK radio at the time and also was performed on the band&#x27;s first BBC TV &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; appearance, because the sexual nature of the lyrics of &quot;Peaches&quot; caused the BBC to censor it. Still, &quot;Peaches&quot; was ranked at No. 18 among the top &quot;Tracks of the Year&quot; for 1977 by &quot;NME&quot;, and it reached No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart. The radio cut was re-recorded with less explicit lyrics: &quot;clitoris&quot; was replaced with &quot;bikini&quot;, &quot;oh shit&quot; with &quot;oh no&quot; and &quot;what a bummer&quot; with &quot;what a summer&quot;. The catalogue number of the radio version was FREE 4.

==Legacy==
In a 2022 feature, &quot;Guitar World&quot; named &quot;Peaches&quot; as having the 4th best bassline of all time.

&quot;Peaches&quot; plays over the opening credits of Jonathan Glazer&#x27;s 2000 film &quot;Sexy Beast&quot;.

An edited version of &quot;Peaches&quot;, minus the lyrics, was used as the closing theme tune to many of the TV chef Keith Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Floyd on...&quot; television shows and during a party scene in the 1997 film &quot;Metroland&quot;. The song is also on the soundtrack of the video game &quot;&quot; (2006). It was used by Adidas in advertising in the Netherlands in 2002.

The song is heard in episode nine of series two of the TV series &quot;Gotham&quot;, the opening sequence of a 2006 &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; episode, and the 2011 film &quot;Killer Elite.&quot;

Dub Pistols covered the song on their 2007 album, &quot;Speakers and Tweeters&quot;, with Rodney P on guest MC vocals and Terry Hall of the Specials singing the chorus.

The song is used in episode 16 (2011) of the BBC series &quot;Being Human&quot;, when the hungry &quot;teenage&quot; vampire Adam stalks three teenage girls into a game arcade.

The song was featured twice in the &quot;Back to Mine&quot; series of &quot;after hours grooving&quot; DJ mix albums, with and Audio Bullys both including it. Simon Franks of the latter referred to it as &quot;raw UK old school&quot;.

The single was re-issued, with &quot;Go Buddy Go&quot;, on green vinyl and with a new sleeve for the 2014 Record Store Day.

<text>Merrill Nisker (born 11 November 1966), better known by her stage name Peaches, is a Canadian electroclash musician and producer.

Born in Ontario, Peaches began her musical career in the 1990s as part of a folk trio, Mermaid Cafe. In 1995, she established a rock band, the Shit. That year she also released her first solo album, &quot;Fancypants Hoodlum&quot;. After moving to Berlin, Germany, she was signed to the Kitty-Yo label and released her second album, &quot;The Teaches of Peaches&quot; (2000). Touring as the opening act for bands like Marilyn Manson and Queens of the Stone Age, she subsequently released her third album, &quot;Fatherfucker&quot; (2003).

Peaches&#x27; songs have been featured in films such as &quot;Mean Girls&quot;, &quot;Waiting...&quot;, &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot;, &quot;My Little Eye&quot;, &quot;Drive Angry&quot;, and &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;. Her music has also been featured on television shows such as &quot;Orphan Black&quot;, &quot;Lost Girl&quot;, &quot;The L Word&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Skam&quot;, &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;30 Rock&quot;, &quot;True Blood&quot;, &quot;Fresh Meat&quot;, &quot;Full Frontal with Samantha Bee&quot;, &quot;The Boys&quot;, &quot;Sex Education&quot;, and &quot;Letterkenny&quot;, and has been used for the promotion of &quot;Dirt&quot;. Peaches has performed guest vocals on several songs, including &quot;Oh My God&quot; from Pink&#x27;s album &quot;Try This&quot;, &quot;We Don&#x27;t Play Guitars&quot; from Chicks on Speed&#x27;s album &quot;99 Cents&quot;, &quot;My Girls&quot; from Christina Aguilera&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Bionic&quot; (produced by — and co-written with — Le Tigre), and &quot;Scare Me&quot; from Major Lazer&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;Free the Universe&quot; (also featuring Timberlee).

Peaches has been described as a feminist and queer icon.

== Early life ==
Merrill Nisker was born in 1966 in Toronto, Ontario. Her family was culturally Jewish, though not religious. Her maternal grandparents immigrated to Canada from Ustrzyki Dolne in Poland; her paternal grandparents were from Galicia in what is now Ukraine.

In an interview in &quot;URB&quot; magazine, she recounted how growing up she experienced antisemitism; on her walks home from school, students from a nearby Catholic school would throw stones at her and call her a &quot;dirty Jew&quot;.

As a teenager, Nisker appeared in two plays alongside future Barenaked Ladies singer Steven Page, including a musical, &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;. She shared this story with Damian Abraham on his &quot;Turned Out a Punk&quot; podcast.

== Career ==

=== 1990–1999: Mermaid Cafe, &quot;Fancypants Hoodlum&quot;, The Shit ===
During the early 1990s, Nisker was part of folk trio Mermaid Cafe. The name was taken from the Joni Mitchell song &quot;Carey&quot;. She later released her first solo album, &quot;Fancypants Hoodlum&quot;, under the name Merrill Nisker in 1995, and subsequently developed the style and persona known as Peaches. In 1995, Peaches was in The Shit - a noisy four-piece combo with Chilly Gonzales (a.k.a. Jason Beck), bassist Sticky Henderson (later of Weeping Tile and Music Maul), and Dominique Salole (a.k.a. Mocky). Their absurd, highly sexual rock music was a harbinger for what Nisker would become, as it was during this time that she adopted the Peaches name. The Peaches moniker was taken from the Nina Simone song &quot;Four Women&quot; where Simone screams at the end, &quot;My name is Peaches!&quot; In Toronto, before rising to fame, she lived above the sex shop Come as You Are with fellow recording artist Feist. Feist worked the back of the stage at Peaches&#x27; shows, using a sock puppet and calling herself &quot;Bitch Lap Lap&quot;. The two toured together in England from 2000 to 2001, staying with Justine Frischmann of Elastica and M.I.A. M.I.A. went on to video-document Peaches&#x27; 2000 US tour and made clothes for the musician, while Peaches inspired M.I.A. to use the Roland MC-505 in her own compositions.

=== 2000–2002: &quot;The Teaches of Peaches&quot; ===
After creating a six-track EP, &quot;Lovertits&quot;, Peaches moved to Berlin, Germany. While visiting her old friend Jason Beck, who was enjoying modest European success as Chilly Gonzales in his new home base of Berlin, Peaches landed a one-night gig. On the merits of that show alone, Berlin&#x27;s Kitty-Yo label signed her on the spot. The label offered her the chance to record a new album, &quot;The Teaches of Peaches&quot;, back home in Toronto, and the already-completed &quot;Lovertits&quot; EP was released in the summer of 2000. The full-length album &quot;The Teaches of Peaches&quot; was released that fall. The album contains her signature song &quot;Fuck the Pain Away&quot;.

Peaches appeared on the British TV show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, but her performance was deemed too racy to be aired.

Nisker signed a European contract with Sony following the release of &quot;The Teaches of Peaches&quot;. She later made a big-budget video for the song &quot;Set It Off&quot;, in which she sat in a locker room as her pubic and armpit hair grew to Rapunzel length. Sony subsequently dropped her. &quot;Now they want their money back,&quot; Peaches said.

In 2001, Nisker&#x27;s 34AA bust was one of the first female busts cast by famous 1960s groupie Cynthia Plaster Caster, who was better known for making molds of male rockers&#x27; genitalia.

In 2002, Peaches appeared in &quot;Hideous Man&quot;, a short film directed by John Malkovich. The short was created as a showcase for clothing designed by Bella Freud and featured the poetry of Gary Sinise.

=== 2003–2005: &quot;Fatherfucker&quot; ===
In 2003, Peaches released her second album &quot;Fatherfucker&quot; on XL/Kitty-Yo after years of touring and opening for artists like Marilyn Manson and Queens of the Stone Age. She once again wrote and programmed all of the album&#x27;s music herself. The single &quot;Kick It&quot;, which features Iggy Pop, was described by Peaches to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;more about rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll than sex.&quot;

For her album &quot;Fatherfucker&quot;, Peaches was nominated in the &quot;Outstanding Music Artist&quot; category for the 15th GLAAD Media Awards along with Rufus Wainwright, Meshell Ndegeocello, Junior Senior, and Bitch and Animal, but lost to Wainwright.

=== 2006–2008: &quot;Impeach My Bush&quot; ===
Peaches was nominated for her album &quot;Impeach My Bush&quot; in the category &quot;Outstanding Music Artist&quot; at the 18th GLAAD Media Awards along with the Ditty Bops, Owen Pallett, Pet Shop Boys, and the Scissor Sisters, but lost to the Scissor Sisters.

Peaches&#x27; song &quot;Boys Wanna Be Her&quot; is featured in an online teaser for the live-action feature film &quot;Bad Kids Go to Hell&quot; (2012), based on the best-selling graphic novel of the same name. It also serves as the theme music for the late-night television series &quot;Full Frontal with Samantha Bee&quot;. It was also featured in an episode of &quot;Orphan Black&quot;.

=== 2009–2012: &quot;I Feel Cream&quot; and other work ===
Peaches&#x27; fourth album &quot;I Feel Cream&quot;, was released on 4 May 2009, in Europe, and 5 May in North America. The first single from the album is a double A-side of &quot;Talk to Me&quot; and &quot;More&quot;. Peaches enlisted some of her contemporaries to co-produce a number of tracks including Simian Mobile Disco, Soulwax, Digitalism and Shapemod. Long time friend and collaborator Chilly Gonzales co-wrote some of the songs on &quot;I Feel Cream&quot; and Shunda K (the voice of Yo Majesty) featured on the track &quot;Billionaire&quot;.

Peaches has been noted for her stage costumes and flamboyant sense of style. Her looks are often both nostalgic and futuristic; aggressive and glamorous; and push the limits of gender identity. Peaches and her band Sweet Machine wear costumes from a variety of designers but most notably she works closely with stylist/designer Vaughan Alexander, celebrity hairstylist Charlie Le Mindu, and young American fashion designer, John Renaud.

In 2010, Peaches and backing band Sweet Machine once again toured Australia performing at the sold out Big Day Out (BDO) festivals and at a series of sideshows. Peaches was supported on this tour by Shunda K who performed her collaboration &quot;Billionaire&quot; at BDO festivals and at the sideshows, and was also the opening act at the sideshows along with Evil Beaver in Melbourne.

On 14 March 2010, Peaches won the &#x27;Electronic Artist of the Year&#x27; award at the 10th Annual Independent Music Awards held in Toronto, Canada.

In March 2010, the copyright owners of the musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; denied Peaches permission to perform her one-woman version that she was planning to stage in Berlin. After receiving the attention of several media outlets, Peaches successfully negotiated with those rights-holders, and the musical was performed on 25–27 March at Berlin&#x27;s HAU1. Gonzales accompanied Peaches on piano. Travis Jeppesen stated in his review for Artforum, &quot;Not only did Peaches set it off, she managed to surprise us all by showing off an expansive vocal range, a musician&#x27;s natural sensitivity to the dynamics of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s score, and an emotive prowess that is rarely if ever displayed in her own, less holy, music.&quot;

Peaches appeared in a film called &quot;Ivory Tower&quot;, which also includes spots from Feist, Chilly Gonzales, Tiga and Gonzales&#x27; mother. Peaches stars as Marsha, a performance artist engaged to a man named Thaddeus (Tiga). Things get complicated when her ex, Hershall (Gonzales) comes back into her life. The film is set in Toronto and was shot over 13 days in late winter and early spring 2010. It was co-written by Gonzales and Céline Sciamma (who directed/wrote &quot;Water Lilies&quot; and &quot;Portrait of a Lady on Fire&quot;) was directed by Adam Traynor and produced by Nicolas Kazarnia. &quot;Ivory Tower&quot; was given a limited theatrical release in August 2010.

In May 2010, Christina Aguilera announced that Peaches was among the collaborators on her fourth studio album &quot;Bionic&quot;. Peaches is featured on a track called &quot;My Girls&quot;. The song was co-written and produced by Le Tigre.

On 30 August 2010, Peaches released a new single titled &quot;Jonny&quot;. The single is part of a tribute series to Alan Vega from the band Suicide. Other musicians who have released tribute singles as part of the series include The Horrors, Primal Scream, Klaxons and Bruce Springsteen.

Peaches also appears as a guest musician on R.E.M.&#x27;s 2011 release &quot;Collapse into Now&quot;, contributing vocals to the song &quot;Alligator_Aviator_Autopilot_Antimatter&quot;.

=== 2012: New music and &quot;Peaches Does Herself&quot; ===
It was announced in 2012 that a semi-biographical musical/concert film would be premièred at the Toronto Film Festival, utilising 22 songs from Peaches&#x27; back catalog and backed by her band the Sweet Machine.

&quot;Peaches Does Herself&quot; premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 13 September 2012.

On 2 October 2012, Peaches released her new single &quot;Burst!&quot; as a digital single backed with several remixes.

=== 2015–2021: &quot;What Else Is in the Teaches of Peaches&quot; and &quot;Rub&quot; ===

Photographer Holger Talinski collaborated with Peaches on a book of photographs, &quot;What Else Is in the Teaches of Peaches&quot;, released on 2 June 2015. The book, published by Akashic Books, also includes text written by Peaches, R.E.M. lead singer Michael Stipe, artist and singer Yoko Ono and actor Elliot Page.

Peaches&#x27; sixth studio album, &quot;Rub&quot;, was released 25 September 2015. It was produced by Vice Cooler with Peaches in her Los Angeles garage. In June 2015 it was announced to contain guest vocal appearances by Kim Gordon, Feist, and Simonne Jones.

An unused track from the &quot;Rub&quot; sessions titled &quot;Bodyline&quot; was released by Adult Swim on 20 July 2015. The Vice Cooler-produced track features Nick Zinner on guitar and was described as &quot;a heavy, chugging guitar line over which Peaches half raps, half sings a high-octane space jam.&quot; In May 2016, Peaches appeared in a fourth-season episode of the Canadian TV series &quot;Orphan Black&quot; as herself, performing &quot;Bodyline&quot; in a club. She performed &quot;Boys Wanna Be Her&quot; at the Not the White House Correspondents&#x27; Dinner on 29 April 2017. In February 2019, Peaches made her debut with the Staatstheater Stuttgart, co-directing and performing as Anna I in Kurt Weill&#x27;s/Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Die sieben Todsünden&quot;.

=== 2022: Documentaries and upcoming seventh studio album ===
In 2022, Peaches went on tour to mark the 20th anniversary of &quot;The Teaches of Peaches&quot;. She is currently working on her seventh studio album. Peaches&#x27; song &quot;Boys Wanna Be Her&quot; is featured in the 2022 film &quot;The 355&quot; starring Jessica Chastain and Diane Kruger.

The 2022 tour was profiled in the documentary film &quot;Teaches of Peaches&quot;, which premiered at the 74th Berlin International Film Festival. In the same year, she was the subject of Marie Losier&#x27;s documentary &quot;Peaches Goes Bananas&quot;. Peaches described the two films as very different from each other, stating that &quot;one is more of a documentary of a certain album at a certain place in time, [whereas] Marie’s film – well, I don’t even consider it documentary. It’s more of a painting, a portrait. Marie gets excited about an artist and then goes her own way.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Peaches is bisexual.

Peaches lists John Waters, Cindy Sherman, Paul McCarthy and the films &quot;Tron&quot;, &quot;Grease&quot;, &quot;Liquid Sky&quot; and &quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot; as inspiration for the visuals in her live shows.

== Art ==
Peaches opened her first institutional solo art exhibition &quot;Whose Jizz Is This?&quot; at the on 10 August 2019 (through 20 October 2019). Taking a bold and unexpected approach to the topics of sex, feminism, queerness, gender, and new millennium politics, Peaches calls her WJIT presentation &quot;a deconstructed musical in 14 scenes&quot;. At the heart of this presentation are the &quot;Fleshies&quot;, who have renamed themselves as such to rewrite their narrative, break away from humans and human interactions, do away with words like &quot;sex toys&quot; and &quot;masturbators&quot; in a quest to find sexual equality amongst themselves.

== Themes ==
Gender identity is one theme of Peaches&#x27; music, often playing with traditional notions of gender roles representation. Her lyrics and live shows consciously blur the distinction between male and female; for example, she appears on the cover of her album &quot;Fatherfucker&quot; with a full beard. When asked if she had chosen the title for shock value, she commented:

She disputes accusations of &quot;penis envy&quot;, preferring the term &quot;hermaphrodite envy&quot;, since &quot;there is so much male and female in us all.&quot;

Age has been another theme of Peaches&#x27; music in recent years. The lyrics from several songs from her 2009 album &quot;I Feel Cream&quot; tackle the issue of age, including &quot;Trick or Treat&quot; (&quot;you lick my crow&#x27;s feet&quot;), &quot;Show Stopper&quot; (&quot;Never mind my age, it&#x27;s like we&#x27;re breaking out of a cage&quot;) and &quot;Mommy Complex&quot;. Peaches has criticized ageism directed against her, telling the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; that &quot;I&#x27;m going to make aging cool.&quot;

Nisker has criticized the &quot;censorship&quot; of pro-Palestinian progressive Jews in Germany. She believes that many Germans &quot;can&#x27;t separate Israeli politics from Jewish feelings&quot; and that diverse Jewish opinions on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict are not &quot;honored&quot; in Germany, telling &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;For any progressive Jewish person who is thinking about what is going on, and understanding the history of what is going on, to be called antisemitic — by &quot;Germans&quot; — is ridiculous. Never did I think in 2024 that I would be thinking about that.&quot;

<text>The Cajal Institute (IC) is a research center in neurobiology which belongs to the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC). The IC originates from the &quot;Laboratorio de Investigaciones Biológicas&quot;, founded in 1900 by order of King Alfonso XIII on the occasion of the Moscow Prize to Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1852–1934). Following Cajal&#x27;s award of the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1906 and the 1907 creation of the &quot;Junta de Ampliación de Estudios&quot;, Cajal was appointed President of the Junta. A royal decree by king Alfonso XIII established the construction of a new building and the appointment of Cajal as its first director in 1920.

== History ==
The building, finally inaugurated in 1932, was located in the hill of San Blas and changed its name to Cajal Institute to honour the memory of its founder. Since the beginning, its activity has focused on the structure and function of the nervous system. It is the oldest neurobiology research center in Spain. Along its more than 100 years of existence, renowned scientists and professionals have spread worldwide and contributed to the advancement of neurobiology.

The Cajal Institute is a benchmark for Spanish neuroscience. It is a multidisciplinary research center in which neuroscientists specializing in the embryonic and adult nervous systems come together from multiple points of view, including cellular and molecular neurobiology, neuropharmacology, electrophysiology, systems neurobiology, and neuropathology. During its recent history, the Cajal Institute has nurtured neuroscientists at the Institute of Neurosciences in Alicante, the National Center for Tetraplegics in Toledo, and different Spanish universities.

=== Headquarters ===
In 1957 it moved to a new building on Velázquez street, sharing the space with other Institutes (Biological Research Center). Finally, in 1989 a new building was built on Doctor Arce Avenue, which is where it is currently located.

== Organization ==
Cajal Institute has three research departments:

* Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Neurobiology 
* Functional and Systems Neurobiology
* Translational Neuroscience

<doc id="256653" wikidata="Q1442516" url="?curid=256653" title="Patriotic People's Movement">
<text>Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement (, IKL, ) was a Finnish nationalist and anti-communist political party. IKL was the successor of the previously banned Lapua Movement. It existed from 1932 to 1944 and had an ideology similar to its predecessor, except that IKL participated in elections with limited success.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
The IKL was founded at a conference on 5 June 1932 as a continuation of the Lapua Movement. The three major founding members were Herman Gummerus, Vilho Annala and Erkki Räikkönen. Lapua leader Vihtori Kosola was imprisoned for his part in the Mäntsälä rebellion at the time of formation but the leadership was officially kept in reserve for him and other leading rebels, notably Annala and Bruno Salmiala, were involved in the formation of IKL.

=== Relationship to mainstream politics ===
IKL participated in parliamentary elections. In 1933 its election list was pooled with the National Coalition Party &quot;(Kokoomus)&quot;, and got 14 seats out of 200. Kokoomus collapsed from 42 to 18 seats. After the collapse, Juho Kusti Paasikivi was elected chairman of &quot;Kokoomus.&quot; He converted his party to the voice of big business and as such had no interest in the direct action tactics of IKL, and thus weeded out the most outspoken IKL sympathizers from the party.

IKL came under increasing scrutiny from government and was subject to two laws designed to arrest its progress. In 1934, a law passed allowing the suppression of propaganda which brought government or constitution into contempt and this was used against the movement, whilst the following year a law banning political uniforms and private uniformed organisations came in, seriously affecting the &quot;Sinimustat&quot; in particular.

IKL kept its 14 seats in the elections of 1936 but was weakened by the overwhelming victory for the coming social democrat-agrarian coalition, under Prime Minister Aimo Kaarlo Cajander that would replace in the spring of 1937 the centrist minority government of Kyösti Kallio, which had, in turn, replaced the narrow right-wing minority government of Toivo Mikael Kivimäki. The strong new government soon moved against the IKL, with Urho Kekkonen, then Minister of the Interior, bringing legal proceedings against the movement late in 1938. However, the courts did not find sufficient grounds for banning IKL. Despite this the prosperity experienced under Cajander&#x27;s government hit the IKL and in the 1939 elections they managed only eight seats. Kekkonen was one of two leading government opponents of the IKL who would later go on to serve as presidents of Finland, the other being Juho Kusti Paasikivi.

According to docent André Swanström, IKL was by far the most popular party among Finnish Waffen SS recruits.

=== Final years ===
The Winter War, and particularly the Moscow Peace, were seen by IKL and its sympathizers as the ultimate proof of the parliamentary government&#x27;s failed foreign policy. During the year after the Winter War, Finland&#x27;s foreign policy was drastically changed, by and large to correspond with that of IKL, and Annala was even included in the Cabinet in January 1941, when all but one parties of the parliament were represented. The price of this recognition was however an end to IKL attacks on the system and as such an effective end to the very reason it had support. After the initial enthusiasm of the Continuation War in 1941 waned during the first winter, IKL wasn&#x27;t included in Edwin Linkomies&#x27; cabinet in spring 1943.

In the aftermath of the Continuation War, IKL was banned, on the insistence of the Soviet Union, four days after the armistice between Finland and the Soviet Union was signed 19 September 1944.

=== Legacy ===
The IKL initials returned to the far-right political scene in 1993 with the foundation of the &quot;Isänmaallinen Kansallis-Liitto&quot; by Matti Järviharju. The new movement died out by 1998.

== Ideology ==
Ideologically, IKL was ardently nationalist and anti-Communist, and endorsed an aggressive foreign policy against the Soviet Union and hostility towards the Swedish language. The creation of a Greater Finland was an important goal for the party. Its manifested purpose was to be the Christian-moral conscience of the parliament. A more hard-line tendency was also active, centered on Bruno Salmiala.

== Organization ==

=== Structure ===
Many of its leaders were priests or participants of the mainly Ostrobothnian Pietist movement called &quot;Herännäisyys.&quot; 

=== Symbols and uniforms ===
The IKL uniform was a black shirt with blue tie, inspired by the Italian fascists, and also by the &quot;Herännäisyys&quot; movement, which had a tradition for black clothing. Members greeted each other with a Roman salute.

=== Youth wing ===
The IKL had its own youth organization, called &quot;Sinimustat (Blue-and-blacks)&quot;, members of which were trained in combat. It was led by Elias Simojoki, a charismatic priest. &quot;Sinimustat&quot; were banned in 1936 (although they were immediately reformed as &quot;Mustapaidat&quot; (&quot;Blackshirts&quot;)).

=== Support ===
The party received its main support from wealthy farmers, the educated middle-class, civil servants, the Lutheran clergy and university students. Geographically, IKL obtained its largest share of votes in Southern Ostrobothnian municipalities such as Kuortane, Lapua and Ilmajoki.

==== Notable IKL supporters ====
*Arne Somersalo, Commander of the Finnish Airforce 1920–26, IKL MP
*Paavo Susitaival, Lt. Col., IKL MP
*Paavo Talvela, General 
*Rolf Nevanlinna, Mathematician, Professor, Rector of the University of Helsinki

<doc id="256654" wikidata="Q1423911" url="?curid=256654" title="Gilbert schema for Ulysses">
<text>This for the novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; was produced by its author, James Joyce, in November 1921 in order to help his friend, Valery Larbaud, prepare a public lecture on the novel, which Joyce was still writing at the time. The lecture took place on 7 December 1921 at the Maison des Amis des Livres bookshop and lending library, owned and run by Adrienne Monnier. The schema was shown to intimates of Joyce during the 1920s and was eventually published by Stuart Gilbert in 1930 in his book, &quot;James Joyce’s “Ulysses”: A Study&quot;. Gilbert’s typed copy of the schema is housed in the Harley K. Croessmann Collection of James Joyce at Southern Illinois University Carbondale.

<text>Ethel Florence Lindesay Richardson (3 January 1870 – 20 March 1946), known by her pen name Henry Handel Richardson, was an Australian author.

== Life ==
Born in East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, into a prosperous family that later fell on hard times, Ethel Florence (who preferred to answer to Et, Ettie or Etta) was the elder daughter of Walter Lindesay Richardson MD (c. 1826–1879) and his wife Mary (née Bailey).

The family lived in various towns across Victoria during Richardson&#x27;s childhood and youth. These included Chiltern, Queenscliff, Koroit and Maldon, where Richardson&#x27;s mother was postmistress (her father having died when she was nine of syphilis). The Richardsons&#x27; home in Chiltern, &quot;Lake View&quot;, is now owned by the National Trust and open to visitors.

Richardson left Maldon to become a boarder at Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College (PLC) in Melbourne in 1883 and attended from the ages of 13 to 17. This experience was the basis for &quot;The Getting of Wisdom&quot;, a coming-of-age novel admired by H. G. Wells. At PLC she started to develop her ability to credibly mix fact with fiction, a skill she used to advantage in her novels.

Richardson excelled in the arts and music during her time at PLC, and her mother took the family to Europe in 1888, to enable Richardson to continue her musical studies at the Leipzig Conservatorium. Richardson set her first novel, &quot;Maurice Guest&quot;, in Leipzig.

In 1894 in Munich Richardson married the Scot John George Robertson, whom she had met in Leipzig where he was studying German literature and who later briefly taught at the University of Strasburg, where his wife became ladies&#x27; tennis champion. In 1903, the couple moved to London, where Robertson had been appointed to the first chair of German at University College, London. Richardson returned to Australia in 1912, in order to research family history for &quot;The Fortunes of Richard Mahony&quot;, but after her return to England, she remained there for the rest of her life. She and her sister Lillian were ardent supporters of the suffragette movement, Lillian even being imprisoned for destroying public property. She was involved in psychic research, and after her husband&#x27;s death, she claimed she maintained daily contact with him via seances.


Florence Emily Green paid for part of the education of Richardson. In her coming of age novel &quot;The Getting of Wisdom&quot;, Florence and her brother were depicted as Miss Isabella and the Rev Mr Shepherd. Her accurate description of Florence is said to be &quot;malicious&quot;. Her younger brother was educated at Trinity College, Melbourne. Richardson experienced lesbian desire throughout her life. At the Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College, she fell in love with an older schoolgirl; the feelings of adolescent females awakening to their sexuality were reflected in &quot;The Getting of Wisdom&quot;. After her mother&#x27;s death, she fell passionately in love with the Italian actress Eleonora Duse, but had to be content to love her from a distance. Her friend Olga Roncoroni, who had lived in the Robertson household for many years, filled the gap left by the death of her husband. After her own death, many of her private papers were destroyed, in accordance with her instructions.

&quot;The Fortunes of Richard Mahony&quot; is Richardson&#x27;s famous trilogy about the slow decline, owing to character flaws and an unnamed brain disease, of a successful Australian physician and businessman and the emotional/financial effect on his family. It was highly praised by Sinclair Lewis, among others, and was inspired by Richardson&#x27;s own family experiences. The central characters were based loosely on her own parents. Richardson also produced a single volume of short stories and an autobiography that greatly illuminates the settings of her novels, although her &quot;Australian Dictionary of Biography&quot; entry doubts that it is reliable.

Manning Clark noted Richardson&#x27;s excitement at Don Bradman&#x27;s cricketing prowess in 1930: &quot;She talked with pride about the achievements of Bradman ... and was so excited by the performance of the boy from Bowral she scarcely talked on anything else when Vance Palmer called on her.&quot;

Richardson was godmother to Humphrey, son of the singer Sophie Wyss. His godfather was Benjamin Britten.

Richardson died of cancer on 20 March 1946 in Hastings, East Sussex, England. Her cremated remains were scattered by her wish with her husband&#x27;s at sea.

Iris Murdoch is her second cousin twice removed.

== Family ==

Lillian Richardson, Ethel&#x27;s younger sister, married A. S. Neill after divorcing her first husband, and helped found and run Summerhill School.

== Honours ==
The Canberra suburb of Richardson was gazetted in 1975 and is named after Henry Handel Richardson. In the same year, she was honoured on a postage stamp bearing her portrait issued by Australia Post.

One of the houses at Abbotsleigh School for Girls in Wahroonga, Sydney is named after Richardson.

Richardson Hall, one of the residential halls at Monash University&#x27;s Clayton campus, is named after Richardson.

== Film ==
&quot;The Getting of Wisdom&quot; was filmed in 1977, directed by Bruce Beresford, from a screenplay by Eleanor Witcombe, starring Susannah Fowle as &quot;Laura Rambotham&quot; with supporting roles by Julia Blake, Terence Donovan and Kerry Armstrong. The screenplay adheres closely to the novel.

&quot;Maurice Guest&quot; was adapted, very loosely, for the screen in &quot;Rhapsody&quot; (1954) starring Elizabeth Taylor, with the setting in Switzerland rather than Germany. It ended with &quot;James Guest&quot; (John Ericson) happily married, rather than committing suicide.

<doc id="256660" wikidata="Q587114" url="?curid=256660" title="Ilha de Itamaracá">
<text>Ilha de Itamaracá is a tropical island and municipality in Pernambuco, Brazil on the Atlantic Ocean. Itamaracá means &quot;stone shaker&quot; in Tupi, from the words &quot;itá&quot; (&quot;stone&quot;) and &quot;mbara&#x27;ká&quot; (&quot;shaker&quot;). It is separated from the mainland by the Canal de Santa Cruz, a salt water channel both mouths of which are on the Atlantic Ocean, and is connected to the mainland by a long road bridge.

Itamaracá has a total area of and had an estimated population of 26,672 inhabitants in 2020 according to IBGE. This is up from 16,000 in 2007, and reflects the increasing popularity of the island as a residential (rather than touristic) destination. It is located in the metropolitan area of Recife, the capital city of Pernambuco state, about an hour from Recife International Airport. The main activities of the population are fishing and, increasingly, tourism. Recife is located about to the south whereas Olinda, another important town of Pernambuco and also UNESCO World Heritage, is to the south. It was awarded city status on 1 January 1959.

About two thirds of the island is covered in protected natural rain forest (&#x27;Mata Atlantica&#x27;), with most human occupation and development occupying a narrow strip along the ocean front white sandy beaches, that stretch for around 12 km (7.5 miles) along the eastern coast. These beaches are protected by a reef 3 km (2 miles) off the coast, that encircles the island on the ocean side, making the island waters shallow, safe, and warm. Year round temperatures typically vary in a narrow range of 26-31C (79-88F), with the rainy season (occasional heavy rains, not monsoon) in May to July. Building regulations since 1995 have limited the number of floors in buildings to 2, resulting in a complete absence of high-rise apartment complexes, and no industry is allowed on the island.

==History==

In the early 1500s before Portuguese colonization, when under Dutch control, the island was the site of a trading post for furs and other native goods, and transhipment depot for Brazilwood. In 1516, was founded the first sugar cane mill in Portuguese America - the oldest still-inhabited, Portuguese settlement in America. The island at that time was occupied by various loosely related tribes of Tupi-Guarani native South American peoples. Later, the island became part of the Captaincy of Itamaracá (most of which today is occupied by the state of Paraiba) which took its name from the island, established by King John III of Portugal in 1534. The chief economic activity in the following century and a half was sugar cane processing, in &quot;engenhos&quot; (sugar mills), and coconut production. While Itamaracá was administratively separate, it operated as a political and economic subdivision of Pernambuco. With the rise of the gold economy in the late 17th century, Itamaracá became economically isolated.

Itamaracá is reputed for having one of the first, if not the first, Jewish community in the Americas. In the Yosef Goldman Collection, there is a book titled &quot;Sefer Shefa Tal&quot;, a kabbalistic volume that was printed in Hanau, Germany, in 1612. It contains a handwritten statement of ownership by Rabbi Jacob Lagarto of a congregation in Tamarica, Brazil. Rabbi Lagarto came to Brazil as a young man and was the author of a volume of aphorisms (copies of which, evidently, no longer exist). The book is the only known physical link to this Jewish community, since there are no other known artifacts from it.

==Tourist attractions==

* Beaches and water sports 
* Forte Orange, first built by the Dutch in 1631 and rebuilt by the Portuguese in 1654
* Vila Velha, seat of the former Itamaracá Hereditary Captaincy (Church of Our Lady of the Conception, colonial houses)
* São João and Amparo &quot;engenhos&quot; (historic sugar mill and plantation complexes)
* Ibama&#x27;s centre of sea mammals (Trichechus manatus)
* Nossa Senhora da Conceição: Second oldest church in Brazil

==People==
The Ciranda singer/songwriter Lia de Itamaraca comes from here.

==Economy==

==Penal Facilities==
Like many islands around the world, prisons were built there many years ago, (as many people could not swim at that time). Itamaracá island still has two prisons, which are nearing the end of a long term relocation program to a new facility being built near Itaquitinga on the mainland. The prisons are located on the leeward side of the island, away from the tourist areas, and have little impact other than the psychological awareness of their existence.

<text>Terminal velocity is the maximum speed attainable by an object as it falls through a fluid (air is the most common example). It is reached when the sum of the drag force (&quot;Fd&quot;) and the buoyancy is equal to the downward force of gravity (&quot;FG&quot;) acting on the object. Since the net force on the object is zero, the object has zero acceleration. For objects falling through air at normal pressure, the buoyant force is usually dismissed and not taken into account, as its effects are negligible.

As the speed of an object increases, so does the drag force acting on it, which also depends on the substance it is passing through (for example air or water). At some speed, the drag or force of resistance will be equal to the gravitational pull on the object. At this point the object stops accelerating and continues falling at a constant speed called the terminal velocity (also called settling velocity). 

An object moving downward faster than the terminal velocity (for example because it was thrown downwards, it fell from a thinner part of the atmosphere, or it changed shape) will slow down until it reaches the terminal velocity. Drag depends on the projected area, here represented by the object&#x27;s cross-section or silhouette in a horizontal plane.

An object with a large projected area relative to its mass, such as a parachute, has a lower terminal velocity than one with a small projected area relative to its mass, such as a dart. In general, for the same shape and material, the terminal velocity of an object increases with size. This is because the downward force (weight) is proportional to the cube of the linear dimension, but the air resistance is approximately proportional to the cross-section area which increases only as the square of the linear dimension. 

For very small objects such as dust and mist, the terminal velocity is easily overcome by convection currents which can prevent them from reaching the ground at all, and hence they can stay suspended in the air for indefinite periods. Air pollution and fog are examples.

==Examples==
Based on air resistance, for example, the terminal speed of a skydiver in a belly-to-earth (i.e., face down) free fall position is about . This speed is the asymptotic limiting value of the speed, and the forces acting on the body balance each other more and more closely as the terminal speed is approached. In this example, a speed of 50.0% of terminal speed is reached after only about 3 seconds, while it takes 8 seconds to reach 90%, 15 seconds to reach 99%, and so on.

Higher speeds can be attained if the skydiver pulls in their limbs (see also freeflying). In this case, the terminal speed increases to about , which is almost the terminal speed of the peregrine falcon diving down on its prey. The same terminal speed is reached for a typical .30-06 bullet dropping downwards—when it is returning to the ground having been fired upwards or dropped from a tower—according to a 1920 U.S. Army Ordnance study.

Competition speed skydivers fly in a head-down position and can reach speeds of . The current record is held by Felix Baumgartner who jumped from an altitude of and reached , though he achieved this speed at high altitude where the density of the air is much lower than at the Earth&#x27;s surface, producing a correspondingly lower drag force.
The biologist J. B. S. Haldane wrote, 

==Physics==
For terminal velocity in falling through air , where viscosity is negligible compared to the drag force, and without considering buoyancy effects, terminal velocity is given by
formula_1
where
*formula_2 represents terminal velocity,
*formula_3 is the mass of the falling object,
*formula_4 is the acceleration due to gravity,
*formula_5 is the drag coefficient,
*formula_6 is the density of the fluid through which the object is falling, and
*formula_7 is the projected area of the object.

In reality, an object approaches its terminal speed asymptotically.

Buoyancy effects, due to the upward force on the object by the surrounding fluid, can be taken into account using Archimedes&#x27; principle: the mass formula_3 has to be reduced by the displaced fluid mass formula_9, with formula_10 the volume of the object. So instead of formula_3 use the reduced mass formula_12 in this and subsequent formulas.

The terminal speed of an object changes due to the properties of the fluid, the mass of the object and its projected cross-sectional surface area.

Air density increases with decreasing altitude, at about 1% per (see barometric formula). For objects falling through the atmosphere, for every of fall, the terminal speed decreases 1%. After reaching the local terminal velocity, while continuing the fall, speed &quot;decreases&quot; to change with the local terminal speed.

Using mathematical terms, defining down to be positive, the net force acting on an object falling near the surface of Earth is (according to the drag equation):

formula_13

with &quot;v&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) the velocity of the object as a function of time &quot;t&quot;.

At equilibrium, the net force is zero (&quot;F&quot;net = 0) and the velocity becomes the terminal velocity :

formula_14

Solving for &quot;V&quot;&quot;t&quot; yields:

The drag equation is—assuming &quot;ρ&quot;, &quot;g&quot; and &quot;C&quot;&quot;d&quot; to be constants:
formula_15

Although this is a Riccati equation that can be solved by reduction to a second-order linear differential equation, it is easier to separate variables.

A more practical form of this equation can be obtained by making the substitution .

Dividing both sides by &quot;m&quot; gives
formula_16

The equation can be re-arranged into
formula_17

Taking the integral of both sides yields
formula_18

After integration, this becomes
formula_19

or in a simpler form
formula_20
with artanh the inverse hyperbolic tangent function.

Alternatively,
formula_21
with tanh the hyperbolic tangent function. Assuming that &quot;g&quot; is positive (which it was defined to be), and substituting &quot;α&quot; back in, the speed &quot;v&quot; becomes
formula_22

Using the formula for terminal velocity
formula_23 
the equation can be rewritten as
formula_24

As time tends to infinity (&quot;t&quot; → ∞), the hyperbolic tangent tends to 1, resulting in the terminal speed
formula_25

For very slow motion of the fluid, the inertia forces of the fluid are negligible (assumption of massless fluid) in comparison to other forces. Such flows are called creeping or Stokes flows and the condition to be satisfied for the flows to be creeping flows is the Reynolds number, formula_26. The equation of motion for creeping flow (simplified Navier–Stokes equation) is given by:

formula_27

where:

* formula_28 is the fluid velocity vector field,
* formula_29 is the fluid pressure field,
* formula_30 is the liquid/fluid viscosity.

The analytical solution for the creeping flow around a sphere was first given by Stokes in 1851.
From Stokes&#x27; solution, the drag force acting on the sphere of diameter formula_31 can be obtained as
where the Reynolds number, formula_32. The expression for the drag force given by equation () is called Stokes&#x27; law.

When the value of formula_5 is substituted in the equation (), we obtain the expression for terminal speed of a spherical object moving under creeping flow conditions:

formula_34
where formula_35 is the density of the object.

== Applications ==
The creeping flow results can be applied in order to study the settling of sediments near the ocean bottom and the fall of moisture drops in the atmosphere. The principle is also applied in the falling sphere viscometer, an experimental device used to measure the viscosity of highly viscous fluids, for example oil, paraffin, tar etc.

==Terminal velocity in the presence of buoyancy force==


When the buoyancy effects are taken into account, an object falling through a fluid under its own weight can reach a terminal velocity (settling velocity) if the net force acting on the object becomes zero. When the terminal velocity is reached the weight of the object is exactly balanced by the upward buoyancy force and drag force. That is

where
*formula_36 is the weight of the object,
*formula_37 is the buoyancy force acting on the object, and
*formula_38 is the drag force acting on the object.

If the falling object is spherical in shape, the expression for the three forces are given below:

where
*formula_31 is the diameter of the spherical object,
*formula_4 is the gravitational acceleration,
*formula_6 is the density of the fluid,
*formula_35 is the density of the object,
*formula_43 is the projected area of the sphere,
*formula_5 is the drag coefficient, and
*formula_10 is the characteristic velocity (taken as terminal velocity, formula_46).

Substitution of equations (–) in equation () and solving for terminal velocity, formula_2 to yield the following expression
In equation (), it is assumed that the object is denser than the fluid. If not, the sign of the drag force should be made negative since the object will be moving upwards, against gravity. Examples are bubbles formed at the bottom of a champagne glass and helium balloons. The terminal velocity in such cases will have a negative value, corresponding to the rate of rising up.

<doc id="256668" wikidata="Q179695" url="?curid=256668" title="Ismail Kadare">
<text>Ismail Kadare (; 28 January 1936 – 1 July 2024) was an Albanian novelist, poet, essayist, screenwriter and playwright. He was a leading international literary figure and intellectual, focusing on poetry until the publication of his first novel, &quot;The General of the Dead Army&quot;, which made him famous internationally.

Kadare is regarded by some as one of the greatest writers and intellectuals of the 20th and 21st centuries, and as a universal voice against totalitarianism. Living in Albania during a time of strict censorship, he devised stratagems to outwit Communist censors who had banned three of his books, using devices such as parable, myth, fable, folk-tale, allegory, and legend, sprinkled with double-entendre, allusion, insinuation, satire, and coded messages. In 1990, to escape the Communist regime and its &quot;Sigurimi&quot; secret police, he defected to Paris. From the 1990s he was asked by both major political parties in Albania to become a consensual President of the country, but declined. In 1996, France made him a foreign associate of the , and in 2016, he was a &quot;Commandeur de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot; recipient.

Kadare was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature 15 times. In 1992, he was awarded the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca; in 1998, the Herder Prize; in 2005, the inaugural Man Booker International Prize; in 2009, the Prince of Asturias Award of Arts; and in 2015, the Jerusalem Prize. He was awarded the Park Kyong-ni Prize in 2019, and the Neustadt International Prize for Literature in 2020. His nominating juror for the Neustadt Prize wrote: &quot;Kadare is the successor of Franz Kafka. No one since Kafka has delved into the infernal mechanism of totalitarian power and its impact on the human soul in as much hypnotic depth as Kadare.&quot; His writing has also been compared to that of Nikolai Gogol, George Orwell, Gabriel García Márquez, Milan Kundera, and Balzac. His works have been published in 45 languages. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that he was a national figure in Albania comparable in popularity perhaps to Mark Twain in the United States, and that &quot;there is hardly an Albanian household without a Kadare book&quot;.

He was the husband of author Helena Kadare and the father of United Nations Ambassador and UN General Assembly Vice-president Besiana Kadare. In 2023 he was granted citizenship of Kosovo, by president Vjosa Osmani.

==Early life and education==
Ismail Kadare was born on 28 January 1936, in the Kingdom of Albania during the reign of King Zog I. He was born in Gjirokastër, a historic Ottoman fortress–city in the mountains, made up of tall stone houses in what is today southern Albania, a dozen miles from the border with Greece. He lived there on a crooked, narrow street known as Lunatics&#x27; Lane.

Ismail&#x27;s parents were Halit Kadare, a post office employee, and Hatixhe Dobi, a homemaker, who had married in 1933 when she was 17. On his mother&#x27;s side, his great-grandfather was a Bejtexhi of the Bektashi Order, known as Hoxhë Dobi. Though he was born into a Muslim family, he was an atheist.

Three years after Kadare was born, Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini&#x27;s troops invaded Albania and ousted the king. Italian rule followed. He was nine years old when the Italian troops were withdrawn, and the communist-led People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania was established.

Kadare attended primary and secondary schools in Gjirokastër. He then studied Languages and Literature at the Faculty of History and Philology of the University of Tirana. In 1956, he received a teacher&#x27;s diploma. He lived in Tirana until moving to France in 1990.

==Literary career==
=== Early ===

At age 11, Kadare read William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Macbeth&quot;. He recalled years later: &quot;Because I did not yet understand that I could simply purchase it in a bookstore, I copied much of it by hand and took it home. My childhood imagination pushed me to feel like a co-author of the play.&quot;

He soon became entranced by literature. At age 12, Kadare wrote his first short stories, which were published in the &quot;Pionieri&quot; (&quot;Pioneer&quot;) journal in Tirana, a communist magazine for children. In 1954 he published his first collection of poems, &quot;Frymëzime djaloshare&quot; (&quot;Boyish inspirations&quot;)&quot;.&quot; In 1957 he published a poetry collection entitled &quot;Ëndërrimet&quot; (&quot;Dreams&quot;).

At 17, Kadare won a poetry contest in Tirana, which allowed him to travel to Moscow to study at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute. He studied literature during the Khrushchev era, doing post-graduate work from 1958 to 1960. His training had as its goal for him to become a communist writer and &quot;engineer of human souls&quot;, to help construct a culture of the new Albania. In Moscow he met writers united under the banner of Socialist Realism—a style of art characterized by the idealized depiction of revolutionary communist values, such as the emancipation of the proletariat. Kadare also had the opportunity to read contemporary Western literature, including works by Jean Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, and Ernest Hemingway. He rejected the canons of Socialist Realism and committed himself internally to writing as opposed to dogmatism. He also cultivated contempt for the &quot;nomenklatura&quot;, an attitude which, he later wrote, was the product of his youthful arrogance rather than of considered political opposition. During his time in the Soviet Union, Kadare published a collection of poetry in Russian, and in 1959 also wrote his first novel, &quot;Qyteti pa reklama&quot; (&quot;The City Without Signs&quot;), a critique of socialist careerism in Albania.

Kadare returned home in October 1960 on Albanian orders, before Albania&#x27;s breaking of political and economic ties with the USSR. He lived for the next 30 years in Tirana, in an apartment which now houses the Ismail Kadare House museum and archives. He worked as a journalist, became editor-in-chief of the literary periodical &quot;Les Lettres Albanaises&quot; (&quot;Albanian Letters&quot;; published simultaneously in Albanian and French), and then contributed to the literary review &quot;Drita&quot; for five years, while embarking on a literary career of his own.

At that time Kadare had a reputation for poetry. In 1961 he published a volume of poetry entitled &quot;Shekulli im&quot; (&quot;My Century&quot;). His work was particularly popular with Albanian youth. His future wife Helena, then a schoolgirl, wrote a fan letter to the young writer, which eventually led to their marriage in 1963.

Kadare wrote one of his earliest pieces in the 1960s, a poem entitled &quot;The Princess Argjiro&quot;. Locally inspired, the poem transforms the centuries-old myth of the legendary 15th century Princess Argjiro, who was said to have jumped off Gjirokastër Castle along with her child to avoid being captured by the Ottomans. The poem was denounced and an official reader&#x27;s report was commissioned, which maintained he had committed historical and ideological errors. Kadare was criticized implicitly for disregarding socialist literary principles.

In 1962, Kadare published an excerpt from his first novel as a short story under the title &quot;&quot; in a communist youth magazine. It was banned immediately after publication, contributing to his reputation for &quot;decadence&quot;.

In 1963, at 26 years of age, Kadare published his novel &quot;The General of the Dead Army&quot;, about an army general and a priest who, 20 years after World War II, are sent to Albania to locate the remains of fallen Italian soldiers and return them to Italy for burial. The novel faced criticism by Albanian literary critics for flouting socialist ideals and for its dark tone. The novel was thus in stark contrast to those of other Albanian writers of the time, who glorified the Communist revolution. The novel inspired three films: Luciano Tovoli&#x27;s 1983 &quot;The General of the Dead Army&quot; (&quot;Il generale dell&#x27;armata morta&quot;) in Italian starring Marcello Mastroianni and Michel Piccoli, Bertrand Tavernier&#x27;s 1989 &quot;Life and Nothing But&quot; (&quot;La Vie et rien d&#x27;autre&quot;) in French starring Philippe Noiret, and Dhimitër Anagnosti&#x27;s 1989 &quot;The Return of the Dead Army&quot; (&quot;Kthimi i ushtrisë së vdekur&quot;) in Albanian starring Bujar Lako. Though it is his best-known novel, and Kadare viewed it as &quot;good literature&quot;, he did not view it as his best work.

In 1964 he wrote &quot;Përse mendohen këto male&quot; (&quot;What are these mountains thinking about?&quot;). His next short novel, &quot;The Monster&quot; (&quot;Përbindëshi&quot;), published in the literary magazine &quot;Nëntori&quot; in 1965, was labelled &quot;decadent&quot; and banned upon publication; it was Kadare&#x27;s second ban.

By the mid-1960s, the cultural censorship thaw of the early part of the decade was over, and conditions changed dramatically. In 1967, Albania launched its own Cultural Revolution. Kadare was exiled for two years along with other Albanian writers to Berat in the countryside, to learn about life alongside the peasants and workers. Two Albanian dramatists were at the time also sentenced to eight years in prison each. Albanian writers and artists encountered indifference from the world outside Albania, which did not speak in their support.

=== International breakthrough (1970–1980) ===
&quot;The General of the Dead Army&quot; was Kadare&#x27;s first great success outside Albania. The French translation by Isuf Vrioni, published in 1970 in Paris by publisher Albin Michel, led to Kadare&#x27;s international breakthrough. In the ironic novel, an Italian general and an Italian Army priest return to Albania 20 years after World War II, to find and bring back to Italy for final burial there the bodies of Italian soldiers killed in the war. The French publishing house published the novel without Kadare&#x27;s knowledge or permission, as Albania at the time was not a signatory to the Universal Copyright Convention and there was no copyright protection on the text. Once the book appeared in France, it was translated into most European languages. By 1977 it had been translated into over 20 languages, with the Albanian communist press hailing it as &quot;one of the most successful translations of the world of the 70s&quot;.

After the success of the novel in the West in 1970, the older generation of Albanian writers and dogmatic literary critics became extremely embittered against the &quot;darling of the West&quot;: &quot;This novel was published by the bourgeoisie and this cannot be accepted&quot;, said a report by the Albanian secret police. Kadare&#x27;s enemies in the secret police and the old guard of the Albanian Politburo referred to him as an agent of the West, which was one of the most dangerous accusations that could be made in Albania. He continued to publish in his home country and became widely promoted there, with frequent references in the Albanian press to new releases and translations of his work, being hailed as a &quot;hero of the new Albanian literature&quot;. Kadare&#x27;s work was described as &quot;treat[ing] many problems preoccupying&quot; Albanian society, and as &quot;mak[ing] use of the revolution as the organizing element of his writing&quot;. He was also lauded as having a &quot;revolutionary drive&quot; which &quot;keeps pace with life and fights against old ideas&quot;.

In 1971 Kadare published the novel &quot;Chronicle in Stone&quot;, in which the narrator is a young Albanian boy whose old stone city hometown is caught up in World War II, and successively occupied by Greek, Italian, and German forces. The novel has been described as magic realism. John Updike wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, that it was &quot;a thoroughly enchanting novel — sophisticated and accomplished in its poetic prose and narrative deftness, yet drawing resonance from its roots in one of Europe&#x27;s most primitive societies&quot;. The book was heavily publicized in the Albanian press, both domestically and in magazines aimed at promoting Albanian socialism and culture to an international audience, such as &quot;New Albania&quot;.

Throughout the 1970s, Kadare began to work more with myths, legends, and the distant past, often drawing allusions between the Ottoman Empire and present-day Albania. At this time, he also worked as an editor and contributor to &quot;New Albania&quot;, an arts and culture magazine which sought to promote Albanian socialism to a worldwide audience.

In 1970, Kadare published &quot;Kështjella&quot; (&quot;The Castle&quot; or &quot;The Siege&quot;) which was celebrated in both Albania and Western Europe, seeing a translation into French in 1972. It detailed the war between Albanians and Ottomans during the time of Skanderbeg.

In 1978 he published the novel &quot;The Three-Arched Bridge&quot;, a political parable set in 1377 in the Balkans, narrated by an Albanian monk. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;an utterly captivating yarn: strange, vivid, ominous, macabre and wise&quot;.

After Kadare offended the authorities with a political poem entitled &quot;The Red Pasha&quot; in 1975 that poked fun at the Albanian Communist bureaucracy, he was denounced, narrowly avoiding being shot, and was ultimately sent to do manual labour in a remote village deep in the central Albania countryside for a short time. After his return to Tirana, Kadare increasingly began to publish short novellas.

In 1980 Kadare published the novel &quot;Broken April&quot;, about the centuries-old tradition of hospitality, blood feuds, and revenge killing in the highlands of north Albania in the 1930s. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reviewing it, wrote: &quot;&quot;Broken April&quot; is written with masterly simplicity in a bardic style, as if the author is saying: Sit quietly and let me recite a terrible story about a blood feud and the inevitability of death by gunfire in my country. You know it must happen because that is the way life is lived in these mountains. Insults must be avenged; family honor must be upheld.&quot; The novel was adapted into the 2001 Brazilian film &quot;Behind the Sun&quot; (&quot;Abril Despedaçado&quot;) by filmmaker Walter Salles, set in 1910 Brazil and starring Rodrigo Santoro, which was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language and a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

=== Controversy and tension in Albania (1981–1990) ===
In 1981, Kadare published &quot;The Palace of Dreams&quot;, an anti-totalitarian fantasy novel. In the novel, an authoritarian dystopia (the imaginary U.O.S.; the United Ottoman States) through an enormous bureaucratic entity (the Palace of Dreams) collects every dream in the empire, sorts it, files it, analyses it, and reports the most dangerous ones to the Sultan. Kadare first published an excerpt of the novel as a short story, alongside some of his other new works, in his 1980 collection of four novellas, &quot;Gjakftohtësia&quot; (&quot;Cold-bloodedness&quot;). The following year, under the same title, Kadare published the completed novel in the second edition of &quot;Emblema e dikurshme&quot; (&quot;Signs of the Past&quot;); despite its political themes, it was not censored by the Albanian authorities.

After publishing &quot;The Palace of Dreams&quot;, readers began to draw comparisons between its critique of totalitarianism and the current government of Albania. At a meeting of the Albanian Writers Union, Kadare was accused by the president of the Union of deliberately evading politics by cloaking much of his fiction in history and folklore, and &quot;The Palace of Dreams&quot; was expressly condemned in the presence of several members of the Albanian Politburo. Kadare was accused of attacking the government in a covert manner, and the novel was viewed by the authorities as an anticommunist work and a mockery of the political system. As a result, the work was banned—but not before 20,000 copies had been sold. The authorities were initially reluctant to imprison or purge Kadare, as he had become an internationally recognized literary figure and it would have caused an international backlash – which, given the country&#x27;s rapid economic decline, the government wanted to avoid at all costs. Western press reacted to the condemnation of &quot;The Palace of Dreams&quot;, and Western protests mounted in his defence. Of all his books, he was most proud of having written this one.

That same year Kadare finished his novel &quot;The Concert&quot;, a satirical account of the Sino-Albanian split, but it was criticized by the authorities and was not published until 1988.

Communist Albanian leader Enver Hoxha presided over a Stalinist regime of forced collectivization and suppression from the end of World War II until 1985. He initiated a process of eliminating Kadare, but backed off due to Western reaction. There was a nightly presence of authorities outside of Kadare&#x27;s apartment. Albanian historian and scholar Anton Logoreci described Kadare during this time as &quot;a rare sturdy flower growing, inexplicably, in a largely barren patch&quot;.

In January 1985, Kadare&#x27;s novel &quot;A Moonlit Night&quot; was published, only to be banned by the authorities. On 9 April 1985, Hoxha fell into a coma; the next night he died, aged 76. On the evening of the ailing dictator&#x27;s death, members of the Union of Writers, the Albanian Politburo, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party hastily organized a meeting in order to condemn &quot;Moonlit Night&quot;.

That same year Kadare wrote the novella &quot;Agamemnon&#x27;s Daughter&quot; – a direct critique, set in the 1970s, of the oppressive regime in Albania. It was smuggled out of the country, with the help of Kadare&#x27;s French editor Claude Durand, but was not published until 2003.

In 1990 Kadare requested a meeting with Albanian president Ramiz Alia, at which he urged him to end human rights abuses, implement democratic and economic reforms, and end the isolation of Albania. Kadare was disappointed with Alia&#x27;s slow reaction.

===Political asylum in France (1990–2024)===

In October 1990, after he criticized the Albanian government, urged democratization of isolationist Albania – Europe&#x27;s last Communist-ruled country, then with a population of 3.3 million – and faced the ire of its authorities and threats from the &quot;Sigurimi&quot; secret police, Kadare sought and received political asylum in France. He defected to Paris, where he thereafter primarily lived, except for a time in Tirana. He had decided to defect because he had become disillusioned with the government of Ramiz Alia, legal opposition was not allowed in Albania, and he had become convinced &quot;that more than any action I could take in Albania, my defection would help the democratization of my country&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that he was a national figure in Albania comparable in popularity perhaps to Mark Twain in the United States, and that &quot;there is hardly an Albanian household without a Kadare book, and even foreign visitors are presented with volumes of his verse as souvenirs&quot;.

The official Albanian press agency reacted by issuing a statement on &quot;this ugly act&quot;, saying Kadare had placed himself &quot;in the services of the enemies of Albania&quot;. Some intellectuals, at great personal risk, publicly supported Kadare, whom the authorities had declared a traitor. Poet Dritero Agolli, who headed the Albanian Writers&#x27; Union, said: &quot;I continue to have great respect for his work.&quot; Despite this, his books were not fully banned by the Communist authorities, and he remained a popular and celebrated author.

After receiving political asylum and settling in France, Kadare continued to write. His exile in Paris was fruitful and enabled him to succeed further, writing both in Albanian and in French.

His 1992 novel &quot;The Pyramid&quot; is a political allegory set in Egypt in the 26th century BC, focusing on intrigues behind the construction of the Great Pyramid of Cheops. In it, Kadare mocked any dictator&#x27;s love for hierarchy and useless monuments. In some of Kadare&#x27;s novels, comprising the so-called &quot;Ottoman Cycle&quot;, the Ottoman Empire is used as the archetype of a totalitarian state. In 1993, the novel was awarded the Prix Méditerranée Étranger in France.

In 1994 he began to work on the first bilingual volume of his work with the French publishing house Fayard. The same year, at the request of the French publisher Flammarion, he wrote the essay &quot;La légende des légendes&quot; (&quot;The legend of legends&quot;), which was immediately translated to French and published in 1995.

Kadare&#x27;s 1996 novel &quot;Spiritus&quot; marked a narrative and compositional turning point in his literary career. In it, two ghosts return to a post-Communist world. Its influence is felt in all of his subsequent novels. It deals with a group of foreigners who are touring Eastern Europe after the fall of Communism and hear exciting rumours during their stay in Albania about the capture of the spirit from the dead. As it turns out, the spirit is in fact a listening device known to the notorious secret service as a &quot;hornet&quot;.

Kadare&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;The Fall of the Stone City&quot; was awarded the Rexhai Surroi Prize in Kosovo, and was shortlisted for the &quot;Independent&quot; Foreign Fiction Prize in 2013. His semi-autobiographical novel &quot;The Doll&quot; was published in 2020. It focuses on his complex bonds with his mother and his country.

Beginning in the 1990s, Kadare was asked multiple times by both the country&#x27;s major political parties to run for president of Albania, but he declined.

==Later life and death==
Kadare married Albanian author Helena Gushi and had two daughters. Besiana Kadare is the Albanian ambassador to the United Nations, its ambassador to Cuba and a vice president of the United Nations General Assembly for its 75th session.

Kadare returned to Albania in his later years. After suffering from ill health for several years, he died from a heart attack at a Tirana hospital, on 1 July 2024, at the age of 88. He was granted a state funeral on 3 July at the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet in Tirana, but was buried in a private ceremony shortly afterwards. Two days of mourning were declared in Albania, while one day of mourning was declared in neighboring Kosovo.

== Awards ==

In 1992, Kadare was awarded the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca international literary award in France. In 1996 he was made a lifetime member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences of France (&quot;Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques&quot;), one of the five academies that make up the Institut de France learned society, in the chair vacated by the recently deceased philosopher Karl Popper. In 1998 he was awarded the international Herder Prize in Austria. In 2003 he received the Ovid Prize international award in Romania, and the Presidential Gold Medal of the League of Prizren from the President of Kosovo.

In 2005 Kadare received the inaugural Man Booker International Prize in the United Kingdom for the full body of his work. In his acceptance speech, he said: &quot;We propped each other up as we tried to write literature as if that regime did not exist. Now and again we pulled it off. At other times we didn&#x27;t.&quot;

In 2008 Kadare received the Flaiano Prize international award in Italy. In 2009, Kadare was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for Literature in Spain, for his literary works.

In 2015, Kadare was awarded the bi-annual Jerusalem Prize in Israel. Speaking of the relationship between Albania and the Jews, he said: &quot;I come from one of the few countries in the world which helped the Jews during World War II. I believe the number of Jews there grew from 200 at the start of the war to 2,000 by the end. The population always defended the Jews, whether during the kingdom, under Communism, or after it.&quot; He noted that during the Holocaust Albanians refused to hand Jews over to the Nazis, and many Albanians went to great lengths to protect Jewish refugees who had fled to Albania. He also noted that Albania and Israel share in common the experience of fighting for survival in a sometimes hostile neighbourhood.

In 2016, Kadare became the first Albanian &quot;Commandeur de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot; recipient, with the award being given to him by French president François Hollande. That year he was also awarded the Albanian National Flag Decoration, Albania&#x27;s highest decoration, by President Bujar Nishani. He won the 2018 International Nonino Prize in Italy.

Kadare won the 2019 Park Kyong-ni Prize, an international award based in South Korea, for his literary works during his career.

In 2023, Kadare won the America Award in Literature for a lifetime contribution to international writing. That year he was also named Grand Officer (&quot;Grand officier&quot;) of the Legion of Honour by a special decree of French president Emmanuel Macron, and thus was ranked among the 250 world-renowned personalities honoured by France. The Legion of Honour is the highest state title awarded by France.
Kadare was nominated for the 2020 Neustadt International Prize for Literature (described as the &quot;American Nobel&quot;) in the United States by Bulgarian writer Kapka Kassobova. He was selected as the 2020 laureate by the Prize&#x27;s jury. He won the 2020 Neustadt International Prize for Literature. In his acceptance speech, he observed: &quot;There is no room for literature in the Marxist vision of the future world.&quot; His nominating juror wrote: &quot;Kadare is the successor of Franz Kafka. No one since Kafka has delved into the infernal mechanism of totalitarian power and its impact on the human soul in as much hypnotic depth as Kadare.&quot;

Kadare won the 2020 Prozart Award, given by the PRO-ZA Balkan International Literature Festival, for his contributions to the development of literature in the Balkans.

Kadare received the President of the Republic of Albania &quot;Honor of the Nation&quot; Decoration, and the French state order &quot;Cross of the Legion of Honor&quot;. He was also a member of the Academy of Albania, the Berlin Academy of Arts, and the Mallarmé Academy, and was awarded honorary doctorates in 1992 from the University of Grenoble III in France, in 2003 from the University of Pristina in Kosovo, and in 2009 from the University of Palermo in Italy.

Kadare was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature 15 times. He stated that the press spoke about him being a potential Nobel Prize winner so much, that &quot;many people think that I&#x27;ve already won it&quot;.

In 2023 Kadare was granted citizenship of Kosovo.

== Legacy ==
Kadare was considered to be one of the greatest writers in the world. The London newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; said of Kadare: &quot;He has been compared to Gogol, Kafka and Orwell. But Kadare&#x27;s is an original voice, universal but deeply rooted in his own soil.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; said his fiction has been compared with that of Gabriel García Márquez, as well as Milan Kundera, and &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote he has also been compared with Dostoevsky and Isak Dinesen. Translator and biographer David Bellos wrote: &quot;In some ways, he&#x27;s like Balzac.&quot; Critic Richard Eder called him &quot;a supreme fictional interpreter of the psychology and physiognomy of oppression&quot;.

Kadare&#x27;s literary works were conceived in the bedrock of tiny Albanian literature, almost unknown before in Europe or the rest of the world. With Kadare it became known, read, and appreciated. For the first time in its history, through Kadare, Albanian literature has been integrated into wider European and world literature.

Kadare&#x27;s oeuvre is a literature of resistance. He managed to write normal literature in an abnormal country – a Communist dictatorship. He had to struggle to get his literary works published, going against state policy. At times even putting his life at risk. Dissent was not allowed in Albania. Kadare noted: &quot;That was not possible. You risked being shot. Not condemned, but shot for a word against the regime. A single word.&quot;

Under Hoxha, at least 100,000 people were imprisoned for political reasons or for a word they said or wrote; 5,000, including many writers, were executed.

Kadare devised numerous subtle stratagems to outwit Communist censors. He used old devices such as parable, myth, fable, folk-tale, allegory, and legend, and sprinkled them with double-entendre, allusion, insinuation, satire, and coded messages.

His oeuvre in general has been in theoretical and practical opposition to the mandatory Socialist Realism required by the State. Kadare challenged Socialist Realism for three decades and opposed it with his subjective realism, avoiding state censorship by using allegorical, symbolic, historical and mythological means.

The conditions in which Kadare lived and published his works were not comparable to other European Communist countries where at least some level of public dissent was tolerated. Rather, the situation in Albania was comparable to North Korea or to the Soviet Union in the 1930s under Stalin. Despite this, Kadare used any opportunity to attack the regime in his works, by means of political allegories, which were picked up by educated Albanian readers. Henri Amouroux, a member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques of France, pointed out that Soviet dissidents including Solzhenitsyn published their works during the era of de-Stalinization, whereas Kadare lived and published his works in a country which remained Stalinist until 1990.

== Works ==

Kadare&#x27;s works have been published in 45 languages. By 2020 most of his approximately 80 novels, plays, screenplays, poetry, essays, and story collections had been translated into different languages.

Among Kadare&#x27;s best-known books are &quot;The General of the Dead Army&quot; (1963), &quot;The Siege&quot; (1970), &quot;The Ghost Rider&quot; (1980), &quot;Broken April&quot; (1980; blood feuds in the highlands of north Albania), &quot;The Palace of Dreams&quot; (1981), &quot;The Pyramid&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Successor&quot; (2003; regarding the mysterious death of Hoxha&#x27;s handpicked successor, Mehmet Shehu).

Some Kadare books were translated into English by David Bellos, from French translations rather than the Albanian originals.

<doc id="256672" wikidata="Q1849894" url="?curid=256672" title="Sherman Minton">
<text>Sherman &quot;Shay&quot; Minton (October 20, 1890 – April 9, 1965) was an American politician and jurist who served as a U.S. senator from Indiana and later became an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States; he was a member of the Democratic Party.

After attending college and law school, Minton served as a captain in World War I, following which he launched a legal and political career. In 1930, after multiple failed election attempts, and serving as a regional leader in the American Legion, he became a utility commissioner under the administration of Paul V. McNutt, Governor of Indiana. Four years later, Minton was elected to the United States Senate. During the campaign, he defended New Deal legislation in a series of addresses in which he suggested it was not necessary to uphold the United States Constitution during the Great Depression. Minton&#x27;s campaign was denounced by his political opponents, and he received more widespread criticism for an address that became known as the &quot;You Cannot Eat the Constitution&quot; speech. As part of the New Deal Coalition, Minton championed President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s unsuccessful court packing plans in the Senate and became one of his top Senate allies.

After Minton failed in his 1940 Senate reelection bid, Roosevelt appointed him as a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. After Roosevelt&#x27;s death, President Harry S. Truman, who had developed a close friendship with Minton during their time together in the Senate, nominated him to the Supreme Court. He was confirmed by the Senate on October 4, 1949, by a vote of 48 to 16, 15 Republicans and one Democrat (Harry Flood Byrd of Virginia) voting against him. He served on the Supreme Court for seven years. An advocate of judicial restraint, Minton was a regular supporter of the majority opinions during his early years on the Court; he became a regular dissenter after President Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s appointees altered the court&#x27;s composition. In 1956, poor health forced Minton to retire, after which he traveled and lectured until his death in 1965. As of 2023, he is the last member of the United States Congress to be named to the Supreme Court.

According to historians, Minton&#x27;s judicial philosophy was largely a reaction to the relationship between the New Deal senators and the conservative 1930s Court, which ruled much of the New Deal legislation unconstitutional. Minton believed the Supreme Court should be more deferential to the political branches of government, and supported a broad interpretation of the powers of Congress. He generally opposed any effort to rule federal legislation unconstitutional on the principle that the court was overstepping its authority. As a result of his judicial philosophy, he sought to uphold the intent of the political branches of government. Historians note the unusual contrast this created between his role as a partisan liberal Senator and his role as a conservative jurist. When Minton became a Justice, the Senate had become more conservative, leading Minton to uphold the constitutionality and intention of conservative legislation. He often played peacemaker and consensus builder during a period when the Court was riven by feuds. He generally ruled in favor of order over freedom as a result of his broad interpretation of governmental powers. These rulings and their limited impact gave some historians a negative opinion of his judicial record. Other historians consider Minton&#x27;s strong commitment to his judicial principles laudable. In 1962, the Sherman Minton Bridge in southern Indiana and the Minton–Capehart Federal Building in Indianapolis were named in his honor.

==Early life==

===Family and background===

Minton was born on October 20, 1890, to John Evan and Emma Livers Minton, in their Georgetown, Indiana, home. He was the third of the couple&#x27;s four children, and was nicknamed Shay because of his younger brother&#x27;s inability to properly pronounce &quot;Sherman&quot;. Minton received his basic education in a two-room schoolhouse in Georgetown, which he attended through eighth grade. He was exposed to politics from an early age: when he was five years old, his father took him to hear a speech by William Jennings Bryan, whom Minton admired for the remainder of his life.

His father, a railroad laborer, became disabled in 1898 when he suffered heat stroke while working. Afterwards, he took up various jobs, including as a farmer, a butcher, and a grocer; Sherman also began working odd jobs to help his financially unstable family. Soon after John&#x27;s heat stroke, Minton&#x27;s mother was diagnosed with breast cancer; a doctor attempted to remove her tumors in April 1900, performing the operation on the Minton&#x27;s family dinner table, but she died during the procedure. The death was an emotional blow to Minton, and he found it impossible to reconcile with the idea of a loving and just God, leading him to shun organized religion for much of his life. Minton&#x27;s father married Sarah Montague on December 3, 1901.

Minton enjoyed school but was a mischievous child. In 1904 he was arrested for riding his bicycle on the sidewalk and was taken before a justice of the peace, who fined him one dollar ($ in current dollar terms) plus court costs. He later credited the incident with sparking his desire to become a lawyer. To accomplish that, he joined his older brother Herbert in Fort Worth, Texas, where he took a job at the Swift &amp; Company meatpacking plant. His father, stepmother, and younger siblings soon joined him there. After saving enough money to continue his education, Minton returned to Georgetown, where he lived with relatives and attended high school.

===Education===

Minton started at Edwardsville High School, but after that school closed, he attended New Albany High School for the remaining three years. There he participated in the football, baseball, and track teams. He helped start the school&#x27;s first debate club, the Wranglers, which won several awards. He worked in a local arcade, and during summer vacations returned to Fort Worth to work at the Swift plant. He was briefly expelled from school after committing a prank in February 1908, and the superintendent, Charles Allen Prosser, let Minton return only after he formally apologized before the entire school. Minton began dating Gertrude Gurtz, whom he later married, in his senior year. He graduated high school in 1910.

To earn money to attend college, Minton resumed working for Swift &amp; Company in Fort Worth and played baseball semi-professionally. In September 1911, he enrolled at Indiana University Bloomington, where he participated in a combined program that enabled him to complete both his undergraduate and law degrees in only four years. Despite the heavy workload, he played multiple sports, joined the debate team, and participated in the Jackson Club, an organization for Democrats. While at Indiana, he also joined and was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. His classmates included such people as future Governor of Indiana Paul V. McNutt and future presidential candidate Wendell L. Willkie, both of whom later had substantial impacts on Minton&#x27;s political career. Minton&#x27;s high academic standing entitled him to serve as librarian at the legal college. The position, which paid thirty dollars a month, allowed him to live more comfortably in law school. He graduated first in his class with an LL.B. degree in September 1915.

Minton won a one-year scholarship to take graduate courses at Yale Law School, where he earned a Master of Laws degree &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1916. At Yale he took a constitutional law seminar with former President and future Chief Justice of the United States William Howard Taft, who is said to have described a paper Minton wrote as one of best ever written at the school. Along with Lewis F. Powell Jr., Minton is one of two United States Supreme Court justices who earned an LL.M. degree. Minton continued to improve his oratory and debate at Yale; he won the Wayland Club prize for extemporaneous public speaking, and helped organize the university&#x27;s legal aid society.

===Legal career and World War I===

Minton spent the summer of 1916 earning money as a platform manager on the Chautauqua lecture circuit. In fall 1916, Minton returned to New Albany, where he renewed his relationship with Gurtz and opened a law practice. Soon thereafter, however, the United States entered World War I, and Minton quickly enlisted in the United States Army. He took an officers&#x27; training course at Fort Benjamin Harrison in hope of earning a commission, but was not among those chosen to become an officer. After taking a brief leave of absence in August to marry Gurtz, Minton returned to camp and requested to repeat his training course, still hoping to receive a commission; after finishing the training he was commissioned as a captain. The Eighty-Fourth Division, to which Minton belonged, was dispatched to France in July 1918. Minton was then assigned to John J. Pershing&#x27;s general staff; he served on the Soissons, Verdun, and Belgian fronts. His tasks included scouting roads to ensure safe transport of men and supplies.

After the war ended, Minton continued to serve with the Army of Occupation until being discharged in August 1919. While in Paris he studied Roman law, international law, civil law and jurisprudence at the Sorbonne&#x27;s &quot;Faculté de Droit&quot;. He was in Versailles when the peace treaty was signed. Returning home after his discharge, Minton met his son, Sherman Anthony, who had been born in February. Two more children, Mary-Anne and John, were born in 1923 and 1925, respectively.

==Political career==

When Minton returned home, he decided to run for Congress in Indiana&#x27;s 3rd district instead of immediately resuming his law practice. Despite his war record and his active campaigning, he lost the 1920 Democratic primary to John Ewing by a wide margin. Afterwards, he briefly joined the Indiana law firm of Stonsenburg and Weathers before moving to Miami, Florida, where he joined another firm, Shutts &amp; Bowen, in 1925. In January 1928, he left the Miami practice and returned to Indiana, where he rejoined the Stonsenburg and Weathers firm. In 1930, he again sought the Democratic congressional nomination in the Third District but was again defeated, this time by Eugene B. Crowe, who won by four thousand votes.


The following year, Minton became a local commander of the American Legion. The group had a large and active membership in the state at the time, and he used his position to encourage support of the Democratic Party agenda. Paul McNutt was the national commander, and the two men became political allies. When McNutt became governor in 1930, he offered Minton a position at the head of a new utility regulation commission. As commissioner, Minton successfully imposed regulations that reduced state telephone bills by a combined total of $525,000. The cuts received widespread media coverage, and Minton was credited in the reports with the success.

===Senate campaign===

Becoming popular among the party leadership during his two years as commissioner, Minton was encouraged by party leaders to run for the United States Senate in 1934. At the state Democratic Party Convention he ran against Earl Peters, a former chairman of the state party. With the support of McNutt, Minton won the nomination on the third ballot with 827 votes to Peters&#x27; 586.

Minton launched a statewide campaign in August 1934 and began delivering speeches in defense of the New Deal. He blamed Republicans for the conditions of the Great Depression. His opponent, incumbent Republican Senator Arthur Raymond Robinson, accused Minton of playing &quot;Santa Claus&quot; by trying to give everyone &quot;presents&quot;. He also criticized Minton&#x27;s support of the New Deal, which Robinson and Republicans called unconstitutional. Minton&#x27;s initial campaign slogan was &quot;You can&#x27;t offer a hungry man the Constitution&quot;, a slogan he unveiled in a debate with Robinson in Corydon on August 11. He continued using the slogan, and on September 11, Minton delivered his infamous &quot;You Cannot Eat the Constitution&quot; speech, in which he concluded the urgent needs of the masses outweighed the need to uphold the Constitution. The speech backfired wildly and papers and opponents across the state called Minton&#x27;s remarks traitorous. Minton stopped using the slogan and explained his position again using new terms, but his opponents continued to dog him over the issue. The Republicans also faulted popular governor McNutt and his reorganization of the government, and McNutt became more personally involved in the election. With the state party&#x27;s more direct involvement, Minton won the election with 52 percent of the vote.

===Lobby Investigation Committee===


Minton took his Senate seat in January 1935. As a freshman, he sat in the back row of the chamber next to fellow freshman Harry Truman, and the pair quickly became friends. Minton was made a member of a special Lobby Investigation Committee chaired by Senator Hugo Black, that was set up to look into questionable lobbyist groups. According to professor of political science Linda C. Gugin, a Minton biographer, in practice the committee&#x27;s investigations were politically motivated and directed against groups that were challenging New Deal legislation.

William Randolph Hearst, a prominent and wealthy media magnate, began using his newspapers to deride the committee&#x27;s &quot;reckless attacks on freedom&quot;. Minton led the effort to counter Hearst and delivered a speech criticizing his support of the Republican Party. In 1937, Senator Black was appointed to the Supreme Court and left the Senate, and Minton secured his post as chair of the committee. Minton immediately began a full-scale investigation of the media conglomerate controlled by Frank E. Gannett, accusing him of publishing Republican Party propaganda. For several weeks, Minton delivered speeches against Gannett in the Senate, and Gannett responded in kind in his newspapers. Minton finally introduced legislation that would have made it &quot;illegal to publish information known to be false&quot;. Gannett, and a large number of allies in newspapers and on radio, immediately began to charge Minton and the Democratic Party with an assault on the freedom of the press. Minton&#x27;s allies in Congress asked him to withdraw the bill because of its political repercussions, and he dropped the matter.

Minton tried again to expose what he believed to be Republican control of the media. He led the committee to target a newspaper with national circulation, &quot;Rural Progress&quot;. Minton accused the publishers of improperly accepting large sums of money from corporations and the editors of undue influence from this money. The owner of the paper, Maurive V. Renolds, was summoned before the committee for a hearing, where Minton demanded to know why he was accepting money from corporations. When Renolds asked his manager, Dr. Glen Frank, to help him answer the questions, Minton and fellow Democratic senators began to shout Dr. Frank down. As he was saying that the money from the corporations was for advertising in the magazine, Minton beat his gavel and yelled, &quot;This committee doesn&#x27;t intend to permit you to use this as a forum to air your Republican views.&quot;

Minton did not realize that Frank was also president of the University of Wisconsin, and soon suffered retaliation for the way he had treated Frank. Frank went on NBC radio stations around the country and lambasted Minton for his rudeness. He made lengthy arguments accusing Minton of attempting to violate the Bill of Rights. Minton was outraged, but the arguments had an effect among voters in Indiana. In 1938, he sought funding to launch a massive nationwide investigation of media conglomerates for proof of Republican interference in the press. Democratic Senator Edward R. Burke led an effort to defeat the measure and privately accused Minton of damaging the Democrats&#x27; cause, which led Minton to leave the Lobby Investigation Committee.

Minton was a fierce partisan during his time in the Senate, and regularly abused his opponents verbally. Democratic Senator Huey Long became one of Minton&#x27;s favorite targets because of Long&#x27;s often-threatened filibusters. During one of the filibusters, Long threatened to join the Republican Party. After most senators had left the chamber, Minton remained for several hours to periodically taunt Long. After tiring of the taunts, Long launched a rebuttal from the podium, calling Minton a vicious politician whose positions would cost Minton re-election. The exchange was unusual for its tone and later made national news.

Minton was involved in many such exchanges, including a particularly fierce one with Republican Senator Lester J. Dickinson in March 1936. Dickinson delivered a speech in the Senate castigating President Franklin D. Roosevelt for carrying out what he termed illegal and unconstitutional acts. Minton responded with a range of accusations, some personal, against Dickinson and his &quot;political naivety&quot;.

===Court packing===
In 1936, the United States Supreme Court ruled the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 unconstitutional. For the first time, Minton gave speeches criticizing the court for overriding the will of Congress. He accused the court of allowing itself to be influenced by political motives rather than the law. In response to the court ruling, Minton began drafting a bill which would allow the Supreme Court to declare a law unconstitutional only if seven out the nine justices supported the decision. In February 1937, before Minton introduced his bill, President Roosevelt introduced a plan of his own to deal with the Supreme Court. Roosevelt proposed adding more justices to the court and creating a mandatory retirement age; the changes would allow him to appoint an overwhelming majority to the court, more sympathetic to his agenda, ensuring the safety of legislation passed by his party.

Minton was pleased with Roosevelt&#x27;s bill and quickly became its leading supporter in the Senate. The measure was placed in an omnibus bill designed to reform judicial salaries and districting, among many other measures. Republicans quickly discovered the court-packing provision and targeted the bill. At the time, Democrats held super-majorities in both chambers of Congress, and passage of the bill at first seemed assured. Minton&#x27;s support of the bill helped him earn the position of Senate majority whip, allowing him to more effectively push for its passage. Minton delivered six radio addresses on behalf of his party in support of the bill, but public opinion could not be swayed in the Democrats&#x27; favor.

Minton received a death threat in the form of an envelope containing a shotgun shell and a message advising him to not vote for the court packing plan. Many Democrats, fearing their re-election prospects, joined with Republicans and defeated the bill. Minton was unhappy with the loss and it cost him considerable support among his voters, but as a result of his close connection with the bill and the leaders of his party, he gained more influence with the Democrats. When Justice Willis Van Devanter retired from the Court in May 1937, Minton was among the final three candidates considered by Roosevelt to succeed him, but the senator declined due to concerns over the impact his recent public criticisms of sitting Court members would have on his relationships with them.

Most controversial of all, Minton proposed a bill in April 1938 to make it a felony for newspapers or other periodicals to publish as “fact anything known to the publisher, or his, or its, responsible agents, to be false,” punishable by up to a two-year prison sentence or a $10,000 fine. Minton made clear that his main targets were the anti-New Deal press including the &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. &quot;Those who know Senator Minton,&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; suggested, &quot;say he must have had Roosevelt’s tacit approval before introducing a bill to make news distortion a felony.&quot; The unanticipated opposition to the bill was overwhelming and transcended the political spectrum. Many charged that Minton was trying to muzzle the critics of the New Deal through censorship. When he raised the idea of a more &quot;objective&quot; across-the-board investigation, it too failed to gain support. A consequence of the reaction against the Minton Bill was to spur the formation of the Bill of Rights Committee of the American Bar Association.

Although Minton supported the Roosevelt Administration and became a regular guest at the White House, Minton broke with the president on some measures. He voted to override a presidential veto of a grant of $2.5 billion ($ billion in 2015 dollars) in bonus pay for World War I soldiers (Bonus Army). Minton also supported Republican Leonidas Dyer&#x27;s anti-lynching bill, which Roosevelt feared would cost the party support in the southern states. He also supported an extension of the Hatch Act of 1939, a law that prevented federal employees from being forced to take part in state election campaigns, effectively lessening the influence of federal patronage.

As World War II neared, Minton took a cautious position on United States involvement. When the Soviet Union invaded Finland, Minton voted against granting a loan to Finland to help finance its defense efforts. He also opposed selling munitions and weapons to the Allies or the Axis powers. He advocated and supported expanding the American military and believed that American entry into the war was inevitable, but should be delayed as long as possible. He voted in favor of the Smith Act, which made it a crime to advocate the overthrow of the government, a law specifically targeted at communists and fascists in the United States. In his final year in office, there was considerable speculation in the press that Minton would be named to higher office by Roosevelt, including cabinet positions and the Supreme Court, but neither happened.

===Re-election campaign===

Minton ran for re-election to his Senate seat in 1940. McNutt was challenging Roosevelt for the Presidential nomination, forcing Minton to choose between the administration and his allies in the state party. Minton sided with Roosevelt, which cost him McNutt&#x27;s and the Indiana Democratic Party machine&#x27;s support in his re-election bid.

The Republican presidential candidate, Wendell Willkie was also a native of Indiana, and Minton faced a difficult challenge to win re-election. He referred to Willkie as a &quot;sycophant for the rich and famous&quot;. Willkie never responded to Minton&#x27;s taunts, leaving Minton&#x27;s opponent in the Senate race, Raymond E. Willis, to do so in his stead. Willis had run for the Senate two years earlier but was defeated by Democrat Frederick Van Nuys. Willis faulted Minton on a range of topics but focused on the legislation Minton supported while in the Senate. Willis claimed that much of the legislation was unconstitutional and Minton&#x27;s positions were detrimental to the nation. Minton responded by pointing out Willis&#x27;s connections to wealthy corporations and accused him of not caring for the people. Minton&#x27;s campaign focused on the achievements of the New Deal programs. He claimed farm income in Indiana had doubled since 1932, and highlighted the passage of the Old Age Pension laws. His support for conscription and military preparedness for the coming war proved unpopular with voters and cost him considerable support, but according to historian William Radcliff it was Willkie&#x27;s favorite son status, which led many Hoosiers to vote Republican, that proved to be the election&#x27;s deciding factor. Despite Minton&#x27;s heavy campaigning, he lost the close election to Willis by 5,179 votes out of over 1.5 million cast.

Roosevelt won the 1940 presidential election. After Minton left office in January 1941, he was given a position in the Roosevelt administration as a reward for his loyalty during the court packing failure. He served as one of the president&#x27;s advisers and a liaison between the White House and Congress. The extent of his duties is not fully known; Linda Gugin has speculated that he may have managed Roosevelt&#x27;s patronage system.
Minton was responsible for getting several officials appointed to high offices in the federal bureaucracy and numerous others appointed to lower ranking positions. He also convinced Roosevelt to support the creation of a Senate defense committee chaired by Truman, a position that brought Truman into the national spotlight and helped him gain the vice presidency.

==Seventh Circuit==

===Appointment===

On May 7, 1941, Roosevelt announced Minton&#x27;s nomination to the Chicago-based United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Minton was confirmed unanimously by the Senate on May 12, 1941, and received his commission on May 22, 1941. Minton resigned from his post in the administration, but even after he began working on the court, Minton remained active in Democratic politics behind the scenes and was in regular correspondence with Roosevelt to make patronage suggestions.

Minton took his oath of office on May 29, 1941, but the court was in recess at the time. He took his seat when it returned to session on October 7, 1941. The court had the highest court load of all the appellate courts in the nation at that time, averaging 40 cases per judge annually. The men on the court were close friends, and Minton developed a particularly close friendship with Judge J. Earl Major; Major offered Minton financial assistance during his later illnesses. Major had been on the court for several years and held a judicial philosophy similar to Minton&#x27;s. The two men regularly attended baseball games and were frequent guests in each other&#x27;s homes.

World War II broke out shortly after Minton joined the court, creating a flood of cases in which legal precedent provided little guidance, including challenges to wartime measures, selective service laws, price controls, rationing and civil liberties. In the majority of these cases, the court affirmed the decisions of the district courts, but in several the court was required to establish a precedent. Minton stated on several occasions his personal preference to affirm the decisions of the lower courts. He believed that the court that heard the case and pronounced judgment was generally able to make a decision that was superior to appellate courts&#x27; decisions. He believed the appellate process should be reserved for the more serious cases and cases where the lower court had clearly made a mistake.

===Jurisprudence===

Minton was described by William Radcliff as a &quot;faithful disciple of judicial restraint,&quot; an unexpected development when compared to his overtly partisan political career. Radcliff attributed Minton&#x27;s conservative position to the distaste he developed for the courts when they overturned legislation passed while he was in the Senate. The courts&#x27; actions led him to strongly believe in the limited exercise of judicial power when evaluating the constitutionality of governmental conduct. Much of the recently passed New Deal legislation was being tried in the courts for constitutionality and enforcement, putting Minton in the uncommon position of adjudicating cases which depended on legislation he had helped write.

During his time on the Seventh Circuit, Minton authored 253 of the court&#x27;s opinions, including twelve dissenting opinions. Some of his opinions won praise; the editors of &quot;Tax Magazine&quot; commented favorably on Minton&#x27;s opinions on tax law, calling them &quot;direct Hoosier logic&quot;. Other court reporting papers made similar comments, applauding the manner in which he turned complex issues to simple questions that could easily be understood.

In the cases of &quot;Sunkist v. Sunkist&quot; and &quot;Quaker Oats Co. v. General Mills&quot;, the court held that it was possible for different companies to use the same brand and product name as long as they produced dissimilar products. In another case, the court set a short-lived precedent allowing companies to artificially raise prices in local markets if the purpose was to artificially lower prices in another market to remain competitive. After Minton joined the United States Supreme Court, the decision was appealed to that body; Minton recused himself from the case, which the court decided to overturn. In another decision, Minton was in the majority that ruled under the Sherman Antitrust Act that the New York Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company was a monopoly, ordering the company to break up its grocery business. Minton was also in the majority in several cases filed to enforce decisions made by the National Labor Relations Board, usually to end worker strikes.

In the case of &quot;United States v. Knauer&quot;, the government denied the wife of a United States citizen entry into the country because of her possible ties to Nazism. In a much-criticized majority opinion which Minton co-authored with Judge Major, he stated that the &quot;alien did not have any legal right—[her] status was a political decision to be made by officials in government.&quot; Many liberals condemned the court at the time of the decision. The ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court in a 1946 appeal.

One of Minton&#x27;s favorite cases was that of &quot;Modernistic Candies, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission&quot;. The candy company produced a one-cent gumball dispenser in which almost all the gumballs were the same color. A few different-colored gumballs were included which, when dispensed, entitled the purchaser to a prize from the merchant who owned the machine. The FTC had an injunction put in place barring the company from producing the machines because they claimed it violated anti-gambling laws. Minton wrote the majority opinion and sided with the majority to keep the injunction in place, but dryly mocked the counsel for the defense and the gambling law, stating:

Counsel for the petitioner discussed at great length from a sociological point of view, of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer&#x27;s dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel&#x27;s attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded us that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.

Minton often lamented that he was required to &quot;pronounce the law as it was written, but on no occasion [c]ould he make the law.&quot;

===Clemency board and failing health===

After Roosevelt&#x27;s death and Truman&#x27;s succession to the Presidency, Minton continued offering advice to the new administration on a range of topics, including patronage and political maneuvering. Truman appointed Minton as head of the War Department Clemency Board, a panel of judges charged with overseeing reviews of decisions made by the courts-martial. The panel met every two weeks which, along with his responsibilities on the circuit court, kept Minton very busy and afforded him little rest, leading to a deterioration in his health. While yachting with President Truman on Memorial Day in 1945, Truman asked Minton to accept an appointment to the position of Solicitor General of the United States. Minton declined because of his health, but he told Truman he would be interested in a seat on the Supreme Court.

In September 1945, Minton suffered a heart attack while in Washington; he was hospitalized for three months at Walter Reed Hospital. After returning to work, he was forced to rest regularly due to gradually worsening anemia, and he sought to lessen his workload. To further complicate his health, on August 5, 1949, Minton tripped over a stone in his yard and broke his leg. The injury forced him to walk with a cane for the remainder of his life.

==Supreme Court==

===Nomination and confirmation===
At a September 15, 1949, news conference, Truman announced Minton&#x27;s nomination to the Supreme Court, succeeding the late Justice Wiley Rutledge. Minton had already privately accepted the nomination several days earlier after a telephone conversation with Truman. Truman touted Minton&#x27;s extensive law education and his years of experience on the circuit courts as the reason for his nomination.

News of Minton&#x27;s appointment received mixed reviews nationally. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Truman had allowed personal and political friendship to influence his choice. &quot;The New Republic&quot; said &quot;the President is again reverting to his deplorable habit of choosing men for high post because they happen to be his friends...&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; raised questions about Minton&#x27;s ability to be confirmed by the Senate due to the power many of his foes held in the body. &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; offered a more sympathetic opinion, pointing out Minton&#x27;s qualifications and the pride Indiana could take in having a native on the Supreme Court. The article noted that he would be the most educated justice on the court, should he be confirmed.

Indiana Senator William E. Jenner led opponents of Minton&#x27;s nomination, including some of Minton&#x27;s old foes, in an attempt to bring him before the body for hearings. Minton wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee answering several of their questions, but refused to submit himself to a hearing. He mentioned his broken leg and hinted in his letter that it could be detrimental to his health to travel in his condition. He also stated that, as a sitting judge and former member of the Senate, it would be improper for him submit to a hearing. Minton responded to questions over his past support for the 1937 court packing scheme in the letter, declaring that as the Senate leader at the time of his scheme he had a right and duty to support the scheme, but as a federal judge his role had now changed to that of a referee rather than a player. Although hearings had occurred irregularly in the past, it was not customary at that time to have a hearing on a nominee. During an absence of Jenner&#x27;s, Minton&#x27;s allies worked to have the hearing request dropped. The Judiciary Committee held a single hearing on September 27, 1949, on his nomination. His nomination faced intense questioning from Republican Senators on his past support for the failed 1937 court packing scheme. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 9–2 on October 3, 1949, to forward his nomination to the full Senate with a favorable report. On October 4, 1949, Senator Homer S. Ferguson attempted to have the nomination returned to committee but the motion failed, 42–45. The long debate over Minton&#x27;s appointment focused on his partisanship, support of the court packing plan during his time in the Senate, and poor health. His opponents launched numerous delaying tactics; the Senate session before the vote to confirm Minton lasted until midnight. His confirmation was approved 48–16 on October 4, 1949, and he was sworn into office on October 12. To date, Minton remains the last member of Congress, sitting or former, to be appointed to the United States Supreme Court, and he is the only native of Indiana to be appointed to the court.

===Judicial restraint===

Minton&#x27;s central judicial philosophy was to ascertain and uphold the original intent of legislation. He continued to take a broad view of governmental powers, demonstrated in his dissenting vote in the case of &quot;Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer&quot;, which ruled unconstitutional President Truman&#x27;s wartime seizure of several steel mills to avert a workers&#x27; strike. Of all the cases in which Minton was involved, he disagreed most with the &quot;Youngstown&quot; decision and &quot;went into a tirade&quot; during the conference where the decision was made. He argued that there &quot;could be no vacant spot in power when the security of the nation is at stake.&quot; Despite his strong protest, he could not influence the Court to permit the president to seize the plants without congressional approval. Minton joined with Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson and Justice Stanley Forman Reed in the dissenting opinion that the President had the authority through the war powers clause of the constitution.

Minton abhorred racial segregation and provided a solid vote to strike down the school segregation practices at issue in 1954&#x27;s landmark case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;; it was among the few decisions in which he sided against the government. According to William Radcliff, the majority opinion authored by Minton in the 1953 case &quot;Barrows v. Jackson&quot; was his most skillfully written opinion. He framed the complex question of the case as: &quot;Can a racially restrictive covenant be enforced at law by a suit for damages against a co-covenantor who allegedly broke the covenant?&quot; The Court decided the answer in the negative.

In the area of civil liberties, Minton adhered to the doctrine of &quot;fundamental fairness&quot;, a test established by the Supreme Court in 1937. In one decision, Minton stated that the right of free speech was not an absolute right, and could be regulated so as not to violate the rights of others. In &quot;United States v. Rabinowitz&quot;, Minton wrote the Court&#x27;s opinion upholding a lower court ruling which allowed police to search automobiles without a warrant, provided there was probable cause to justify the search.

Minton voted to uphold anticommunist legislation during the period of the &quot;red scare&quot;, siding with the majority in 1951&#x27;s &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot;, which upheld the conviction of the leader of the US Communist Party. During the same period, the Court was split over the legality of governmental loyalty tests. Many agencies had programs in place to ensure that members of the government were not communists. Minton&#x27;s vote proved to be the deciding factor in cases regarding loyalty tests. In the case of &quot;Bailey v. Richardson&quot;, Minton&#x27;s vote upheld the legality of the loyalty tests, while in the decision he authored in the case of &quot;Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath&quot;, he voted to uphold the plaintiff&#x27;s position that he had been terminated illegally because of his support of fascist ideology. Minton&#x27;s position gradually shifted to allowing the loyalty tests to take place, and in &quot;Adler v. Board of Ed. of City of New York&quot; he wrote the majority opinion allowing the tests and upholding New York&#x27;s Feinberg Law. This proved to be the most important vote as it allowed the tests to be given with only minimal suspicion of a person&#x27;s disloyalty to the government.

Because of Minton&#x27;s previous Congressional partisanship, many liberals believed he would support their positions when on the Court. Throughout his tenure, Minton regularly disappointed them, leading many to rail against him. A lawyer writing for the &quot;New Jersey Law Journal&quot; labeled Minton a &quot;spokesman against freedom&quot;, calling him &quot;a man of conspicuous judicial shortcomings, whose votes against civil liberties exceeded those of any other man on the Court, and who wrote comparatively few opinions of other kinds.&quot; Linda Gugin pointed out that Minton was a disappointment to liberals because he consistently chose order over freedom. Gugin also concludes that Minton had the strongest commitment to judicial restraint and ideological neutrality of any justice, past or present.

===Politics===

Although Minton was on the Supreme Court, he remained casually involved in Democratic internal politics. He wrote Truman several letters criticizing Justices Robert H. Jackson and Hugo Black, referring to Black as a demagogue. He also offered advice on dealing with Republican opposition in the Senate. In a 1954 letter, after Truman left office, he urged Truman to help focus public attention on the economy and away from communism, a threat he claimed the Republicans were exaggerating to avoid confronting their own problems.

After Truman&#x27;s withdrawal from the 1952 presidential campaign, Minton made remarks indicating he had advised Truman to stay out of the contested New Hampshire primary election to begin with. In August 1956, a reporter asked Minton about his preferred candidate in the upcoming presidential election. Minton answered, &quot;I have great confidence in Adlai Stevenson.&quot; He also remarked that Dwight D. Eisenhower was politically handicapped. Minton was lambasted in the media for his endorsement, which he attempted to retract a few days later after being advised to do so by other members of the Court.

===Regular dissenter===

Truman&#x27;s other appointees to the Court provided consistent conservative votes, and during Minton&#x27;s first years on the Court it was returned to the conservatism of the William Howard Taft era. While on the Court, Minton transformed from a New Deal senator into an almost reactionary judge as an ally of Justice Felix Frankfurter. Empirical coding of votes shows that Minton was the most conservative justice on the Court during his first year, and remained in the conservative half of the court for the duration of his career.

Minton did not enjoy the limited influence of his judicial role in the later years of his term, when he was more frequently in the minority in voting on cases. After the deaths of Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson and Justice Robert Jackson, Minton found himself with little support for many of his opinions, which led him to begin considering retirement.

The shifting position of the Court led to personal animosity between members of its two wings. Despite his disappointment over the Court&#x27;s positions on some issues, Minton remained popular among his colleagues on the Court as he didn&#x27;t take sides in their personal disagreements; he proved a soothing presence during a period marked by bitter personal feuds between strong personalities such as William O. Douglas and Felix Frankfurter.

Minton informed Eisenhower of his intention to retire in a letter on September 7, 1956, in which he dryly stated his retirement was authorized by law. Eisenhower responded with a brief note wishing him a happy retirement. Although he did not tell the president, Minton informed the members of the Court that his duties were too taxing on his health. His anemia had steadily worsened, slowing him physically and mentally. Minton served as a Justice until October 15, 1956, retiring after 7 years and 3 days of service. He was succeeded by William J. Brennan Jr.

==Later life==

===Retirement===

Announcing his departure, Minton remarked, &quot;There will be more interest in who will succeed me than in my passing. I&#x27;m an echo.&quot; Despite the health difficulties, Minton regretted his decision almost immediately.

Minton returned to his New Albany home, where he took a much lighter workload. He gave occasional lectures at Indiana University and continued to give public speeches from time to time. For several years after retiring from the Supreme Court, Minton occasionally accepted assignments to serve temporarily on one of the lower federal courts. He received an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Louisville. He took many trips around the United States, and two trips to Europe. In England, he received an honorary doctorate from Oxford University in 1956.

Despite his failing health, Minton remained active in the Democratic Party. He was most concerned with President Eisenhower, who he believed was incompetent. He remained in regular correspondence with Truman, and the two met on several occasions at Democratic Party functions.

===Death and legacy===

In late March 1965, Minton was admitted to Floyd Memorial Hospital in New Albany, where it was found he was suffering internal bleeding. He died in his sleep early in the morning of April 9. Minton&#x27;s wife was Roman Catholic; his funeral was held at the now-defunct Holy Trinity Catholic Church and was attended by many dignitaries, including several sitting members of the Supreme Court, the governors of Indiana and Kentucky, and several members of Congress. He was buried in the Holy Trinity Cemetery, on Green Valley Road in New Albany, next to Leo Receveur. Minton himself was nominally Catholic and had shunned Christianity for most of his life; he only began to occasionally attend mass following his retirement. He left most of his personal papers and judicial records to the Truman Presidential Library.

Minton is the eponym of the Sherman Minton Bridge, which carries Interstate 64 across the Ohio River, connecting western Louisville, Kentucky with New Albany, Indiana. Minton attended the dedication of the bridge at a 1962 ceremony. He is also the namesake of the annual Sherman Minton Moot Court Competition, held at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law. He is also honored (with Indiana Senator Homer E. Capehart)—in the &quot;Brutalist&quot; style designed by Woollen, Molzan and Partners and with architectural art by Milton Glaser—in the centrally located Minton-Capehart Federal Building on Indiana World War Memorial Plaza in Indianapolis. A bronze bust of Minton was created and put on display in the Indiana Statehouse.

While some writers like Linda Gugin and legal historian William Radcliff have given high praise to Minton&#x27;s logic in his written opinions, they point out that his positions had little long-term impact. Other legal historians, like Bernard Schwartz, have a more negative opinion of Minton&#x27;s judicial career. Schwartz wrote that Minton &quot;was below mediocrity as a Justice. His opinions, relatively few for his tenure, are less than third rate, characterized by their cavalier approach to complicated issues.&quot; Schwartz went on to say, &quot;he ranks near the bottom of any list of Justices.&quot; Most of the precedents Minton helped establish were overturned by the Warren Court in the years immediately following his retirement. In total he wrote sixty-seven majority opinions along with several of the dissenting opinions. Gugin authored a work in rebuttal to Schwartz&#x27;s harsh critique, saying that Minton&#x27;s rulings were &quot;predictable based on the principles of deference, precedent, and strict interpretation&quot;; she attributed his poor ranking to the bias of reviewers in favor of judicial activism.

Minton&#x27;s time on the court marked the end of a transitory period in the judiciary. Since Minton, justices have tended to serve increasingly longer terms on the court, which has had strong political science implications on the Supreme Court. The growing concept of judicial non-partisanship became the norm in American politics after Minton—he was the last member of Congress to be appointed to the Court. Linda Gugin and Professor James St. Clair have noted that the federal courts have lost a valuable point of view by not having experienced legislators among their ranks.

Minton played an important role behind the scenes of the Court as a peacemaker between its two opposing factions. These attempts to keep the peace led Justice Frankfurter to remark that while Minton would never be remembered as a great justice, he would be remembered as a great colleague by his fellow justices.

<text>Albania’s diverse landscape, shaped by favorable weather conditions, significant tectonic subsidence, karst processes and coastal dynamics, is home to a wide array of natural and artificial lakes. These water bodies vary widely in altitude, water flow, geology and climate, influencing their unique morphometric features, water balance and hydrochemical and optical properties.

Lakes are generally categorized based on the origin of their basins, a factor that fundamentally alters their geographical characteristics. The country hosts 247 natural lakes and over 800 artificial reservoirs. 
Natural lakes, primarily formed through karstic or glacial processes, are further classified into four types: 4 tectonic, 134 proglacial, 94 karst and 15 oxbow. 

Additionally, the coastal region features lagoons that collectively cover an area of approximately .

Other smaller natural or glacial lakes include Lura Lakes, Lake Sheep, Lake Gistova, Lake Gramë, Lake Buni Jezercë, Lake Dash, Lake Sylbicë, Lake Dhënve, Lake Sope and Lake Malik, which was drained by government&#x27;s decision.

<text>Nabonidus (Babylonian cuneiform: &quot;Nabû-naʾid&quot;, meaning &quot;May Nabu be exalted&quot; or &quot;Nabu is praised&quot;) was the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, ruling from 556 BC to the fall of Babylon to the Achaemenian Empire under Cyrus the Great in 539 BC. Nabonidus was the last native ruler of ancient Mesopotamia, the end of his reign marking the end of thousands of years of Sumero-Akkadian states, kingdoms and empires. He was also the last independent king of Babylon. Regarded as one of the most vibrant and individualistic rulers of his time, Nabonidus is characterised by some scholars as an unorthodox religious reformer and as the first archaeologist. 

The origins of Nabonidus, his connection to previous royalty, and subsequently what claim he had to the throne remain unclear, given that Nabonidus made no genealogical claims of kinship to previous kings. This suggests that he was neither related nor connected to the Chaldean dynasty of Babylonian rulers. However, he is known to have had a prominent career of some kind before he became king. It is possible that he was connected to the Chaldean kings via marriage, possibly having married a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar II (605–562 BC). Nabonidus&#x27;s mother, Adad-guppi, was of Assyrian ancestry. His father, Nabu-balatsu-iqbi, of whom little is known, may also have been either Assyrian or Babylonian. Some historians have speculated that either Adad-guppi or Nabu-balatsu-iqbi were members of the Sargonid dynasty, rulers of the Neo-Assyrian Empire until its fall in 609 BC.

Nabonidus was, to his own apparent surprise, proclaimed king after the deposition and murder of Labashi-Marduk (556 BC) in a plot likely led by Nabonidus&#x27;s son Belshazzar. Throughout his reign, inscriptions and later sources suggest that Nabonidus worked to increase the status of the moon god Sîn and decrease the status of Babylon&#x27;s traditional national deity Marduk. While some have suggested that Nabonidus wished to go as far as to completely replace Marduk with Sîn as the head of the Mesopotamian pantheon, the extent to which Nabonidus&#x27;s devotion to Sîn led to religious reforms is debated. Nabonidus was in self-imposed exile in Tayma, Arabia from 552 to 543/542 BC. The reason for this is unknown, though it might have been due to disagreements with the Babylonian clergy and oligarchy. Belshazzar acted as regent in Babylonia during this period, while Nabonidus continued to be recognised as the king.

When Nabonidus returned to Babylonia in 543/542 BC, he escalated his religious efforts and rebuilt the Ekhulkhul, the temple dedicated to Sîn in the major northern city of Harran. Nabonidus&#x27;s reign came to an abrupt end with the quick victory over his empire by Cyrus the Great in 539 BC. After the decisive battle of Opis, the Persians entered Babylon without a fight. Several sources state that Nabonidus was captured but spared, and possibly allowed leave to the region of Carmania. He may have been alive in exile as late as the reign of Darius the Great (522–486 BC).

== Background ==

=== Ancestry and connection to royalty ===

The origins of Nabonidus are obscure, with the scarce available details about him leaving much room for interpretation and speculation. In one of his inscriptions, Nabonidus states the following:

Nabonidus&#x27;s father was a man by the name Nabu-balatsu-iqbi, whom Nabonidus refers to in his inscriptions as a &quot;learned counsellor&quot;, &quot;wise prince&quot;, &quot;perfect prince&quot; and &quot;heroic governor&quot;. That Nabu-balatsu-iqbi is not given a connection to any Babylonian king in Nabonidus&#x27;s inscriptions, it is typically assumed to indicate that Nabonidus was not closely connected to Babylonia&#x27;s ruling dynasty (the Chaldean dynasty). In his inscriptions, Nabonidus refers to those who preceded him as kings of Babylon, but he does not claim descent from any of them. In no inscription does Nabonidus elaborate on his father&#x27;s origin and ethnicity, merely mentioning his name and writing that he was courageous, wise and devout. Curiously, no person named Nabu-balatsu-iqbi who can reasonably be identified as Nabonidus&#x27;s father appears in documents prior to Nabonidus&#x27;s reign, thus making his father&#x27;s status and position unclear. The repeated references of Nabu-balatsu-iqbi as &quot;prince&quot; in Nabonidus&#x27;s inscriptions suggests some sort of noble status and political importance.

Nabonidus&#x27;s mother was Adad-guppi, born in 648/649 BC. Although once assumed to have been part of the Babylonian royal harem, no evidence exists to date that Adad-guppi was indeed the concubine of Nabonidus&#x27;s predecessors. She was, however, influential at the royal Babylonian court, according to her own inscriptions claiming that she wielded influence with the kings Nabopolassar (626–605 BC), Nebuchadnezzar II (605–562 BC) and Neriglissar (560–556 BC). While no conclusive evidence currently exists, Adad-guppi is often assumed to have come from the major city Harran in northern Mesopotamia (where she later lived), and as having been of Assyrian ancestry. 

According to Canadian Assyriologist Paul-Alain Beaulieu, Nabonidus&#x27;s later intense interest in Harran, a peripheral city of his empire, can only be explained if he and his mother had originated in Harran. The Dynastic Prophecy, a later document written after the conquest of Babylonia by Alexander the Great centuries later, corroborates that Nabonidus would have originated in Harran, as it regards Nabonidus as the founder, and sole representative, of the &quot;dynasty of Harran&quot;. According to Beaulieu, Adagoppe may have been Aramean, rather than Assyrian, as her name &quot;seems to be Aramean&quot;. In Harran, Adad-guppi served as a priestess devoted to the moon god, Sîn. There is no evidence that Adad-guppi was a high-ranking priestess, as the only titles she claims in her inscriptions are &quot;mother of Nabonidus&quot; and &quot;worshipper of Sîn, Ningal, Nusku and Sadarnunna&quot;.

Adad-guppi&#x27;s association with Harran, and that she had likely married Nabu-balatsu-iqbi early in her life (as was the custom in ancient Mesopotamia), would mean that Nabu-balatsu-iqbi was most probably also a prominent resident of that city, and possibly of Assyrian or Aramean origin. Frauke Weiershäuser and Jamie Novotny speculated that Nabu-balatsu-iqbi could have been an Aramean chief. Stephen Herbert Langdon theorised that Nabu-balatsu-iqbi was a son of Esarhaddon (681–669 BC) and thus one of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s brothers, but there is no concrete evidence for this relation.

Per Nabonidus&#x27;s own inscriptions and the inscriptions by Adad-guppi, wherein Nabonidus is called her &quot;only son&quot; several times, it can be confidently ascertained that Nabonidus was an only child. It is probable that Adad-guppi first came to Babylon as a prisoner after the Babylonians and Medes sacked Harran in 610 BC during the Medo-Babylonian conquest of the Assyrian Empire. By 610 BC, she was already 39 years old. Presumably, Nabonidus was already born at this point, though his exact year of birth is yet unknown. In one of her inscriptions, Adad-guppi claims to have seen her descendants down to her great-great-grandchildren (i.e. Nabonidus&#x27;s great-grandchildren) in her lifetime, totalling four generations of descendants. If the time between generations is estimated at approximately 20–25 years, and assuming that her great-great-grandchildren were approximately five years old by the time of Adad-guppi&#x27;s death, Nabonidus could not have been born later than 615 BC, however he could very well have been born earlier.

It is possible as well that Nabonidus married one of Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s daughters, a marriage which could potentially have been secured through his mother&#x27;s influence. Not only would such a connection explain Nabonidus&#x27;s rise to the throne (being connected to the royal family) but it would also explain later historical traditions in which Nabonidus&#x27;s son, Belshazzar, is described as Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s descendant; as in the Book of Daniel in the Hebrew Bible, where Belshazzar is referred to as Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s (grand)son. The claim of Belshazzar being Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s descendant however, could also alternatively derive from royal propaganda, rather than true genealogical information. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus names the &quot;last great queen&quot; of the Babylonian Empire as Nitocris, but neither that name, nor any other name, is attested in contemporary Babylonian sources. Herodotus&#x27;s description of Nitocris contains a wealth of legendary material making it difficult to determine whether he uses the name to refer to Nabonidus&#x27;s wife or mother. William H. Shea proposed in 1982 that Nitocris may tentatively be identified as the name of Nabonidus&#x27;s wife and Belshazzar&#x27;s mother.

In her inscriptions, Adad-guppi also claimed that Nabonidus was from the dynastic line of Ashurbanipal (669–631 BC), king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. According to her inscriptions, Adad-guppi was born in Ashurbanipal&#x27;s twentieth year as king. At the time of her birth, Harran had been a major Assyrian stronghold and when the Neo-Assyrian Empire fell in 609 BC, Harran was the capital of its government in exile. On account of her claims in regards to Nabonidus being of Sargonid (Ashurbanipal&#x27;s dynasty) ancestry, Stephanie Dalley in 2003 considered it &quot;almost certain&quot; that Adad-guppi was a daughter of Ashurbanipal. Michael B. Dick opposed Dalley&#x27;s conviction in 2004, pointing out that even though Nabonidus did go to some length to revive some old Assyrian symbols (such as wearing a wrapped cloak in his depictions, absent in those of other Neo-Babylonian kings but present in Assyrian art) and attempted to link himself to the Sargonid dynasty, there is &quot;no evidence whatsoever that Nabonidus was related to the Sargonid dynasty&quot;. According to Beaulieu, that Adad-guppi did not explicitly claim any royal ancestors herself points to a humble origin. As inscriptions by female relatives of kings are relatively rare, it is however probable, according to Wilfred G. Lambert, that Adad-guppi was of some high status.

=== Pre-royal career ===

According to Herodotus, an official by the name Labynetus (the same name used for Nabonidus in ancient Greek sources) was present as a mediator and witness on behalf of Babylon at the negotiations conducted between the Median and Lydian kingdoms after the Battle of the Eclipse in 585 BC. It is possible that this ambassador was the same person as the Nabonidus who later became Babylon&#x27;s king.

The name of Nabonidus is otherwise poorly attested in sources prior to his reign. A Nabonidus is listed as the head witnesses in a 597 BC legal document; however, it is unclear whether this is the same person as the later king, especially given that the text could be interpreted as referring to Nabonidus as a son of Nebuchadnezzar II. However, it is unlikely that king Nabonidus would have failed to mention being a son of Nebuchadnezzar II. If they are the same person, and the document does not call him the son of the king, his office listed in the document, &quot;ša muḫḫi āli&quot; (an official in charge of a city) would mean that the date of Nabonidus&#x27;s birth has to be pushed back further, to before 620 BC, to account for the age necessary to hold that office. If the Nabonidus mentioned is not Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s son, then the document does not name the father of this Nabonidus, which suggests that he was of high rank (fathers and grandfathers were otherwise usually mentioned for distinguishing purposes), and he could then conceivably be the same person as the later king. The wording could be interpreted as &quot;the son of a man of the king&quot; (i.e. a prince), rather than &quot;the son of the king&quot;, which in that case, would explain Nabonidus&#x27; references to his father as a prince, in his royal inscriptions.

There is also another letter from some point between the early 590s BC and the 570s BC, wherein a Nabonidus is described as having requested the levies of a particular region to be raised. Whether this Nabonidus is the same person as the future king is also unclear. The lack of confident mentions of Nabonidus in sources before his rise to the throne could suggest the possibility that Nabonidus was not his birth name, but an assumed regnal name, however the meaning of the name, i.e., &quot;may Nabû be exalted&quot;, weakens that possibility.

The Babylonian historian Berossus, active centuries later during the Hellenistic period, wrote that Nabonidus had been a &#x27;priest of Bêl&#x27;. A religious function could possibly explain Nabonidus&#x27;s absence of mention in earlier documents. In her inscriptions, Adad-guppi claims to have introduced her son Nabonidus to king Nebuchadnezzar II and king Neriglissar, and that Nabonidus thereafter performed duties for them &quot;day and night&quot; and &quot;regularly did whatever pleased them&quot;. As Nabonidus is considered to have been a learned man, one who knew how to write, and who quarreled with numerous priests and scholars, it is possible that he was a courtier at the royal court before he became king; however, no records of a prominent courtier by his name are known.

== Reign ==

=== Rise to the throne ===

Nabonidus rose to the throne in the aftermath of the collapse of the direct dynastic line of the Chaldean dynasty. After the brief reign of Neriglissar, a son-in-law of Nebuchadnezzar II, the throne had been inherited in April 556 BC by Neriglissar&#x27;s son Labashi-Marduk. Berossus erroneously wrote that Labashi-Marduk ruled for nine months (though this might be attributable to a scribal error) and stated that Labashi-Marduk&#x27;s &quot;evil ways&quot; led to his friends plotting against him, eventually resulting in the &quot;child king&quot; being beaten to death. The plotters then agreed that Nabonnedos (Nabonidus), one of the plotters, should rule. The reason for the coup against Labashi-Marduk is unknown. It is possible that despite Labashi-Marduk and his father being well-connected and wealthy, they were ultimately seen as commoners, lacking noble blood. Though Labashi-Marduk may have been the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar II through his mother, making him part of the royal bloodline, it is also possible he was the son of Neriglissar and a different wife. Thus, Labashi-Marduk&#x27;s rise to the throne might have signified a true break in the dynasty of Nebuchadnezzar II and might as such have aroused opposition from the Babylonian populace. Although Berossus refers to Labashi-Marduk as a child, it is possible that he became king as an adult since commercial texts from two years earlier indicate that Labashi-Marduk was in charge of his own affairs at that time.

Though Nabonidus in his inscriptions claims that he had few supporters and that he did not covet the throne himself, he must have been a leading figure in the conspiracy that led to the deposition and death of Labashi-Marduk. Nabonidus enjoyed consistent support from the Babylonian military throughout his reign and it is possible that the army played a role in his rise to the throne. Though Berossus claimed Labashi-Marduk ruled for nine months, the Uruk King List only gives Labashi-Marduk a reign of three months and contract tablets from Babylonia suggest that he might have ruled as briefly as just two months. It appears that there was a period of either confusion, after a discrete palace coup, or a brief civil war. Per contract tablets, Labashi-Marduk was still recognised as king at Uruk up until at least 19 June, and in the city of Sippar until at least 20 June. The earliest tablet dated to the reign of Nabonidus at Sippar is from 26 June. However, a tablet written as early as 25 May from Nippur is dated to Nabonidus&#x27;s reign and the last tablet dated to Labashi-Marduk&#x27;s reign at Babylon itself is from 24 May. The earliest tablet dated to Nabonidus at Babylon itself is from 14 July. This evidence can be reconciled by positing that Nabonidus may have been recognised in the Babylonian heartland, including Nippur and Babylon, already on 25 May, whereas some outlying cities continued to recognise Labashi-Marduk (even though he quite possibly was dead at the time on account of a possible palace coup) as king until June. By the end of June 556 BC, tablets dated to Nabonidus are known from across Babylonia. 

On account of his mother&#x27;s age, and Nabonidus having had a long career in royal service before 556 BC, he must have been relatively old by the time he became king. It appears that Nabonidus had not intended to become king, and that he accepted the kingship reluctantly. Though a reluctance to accept royal power is often used as a form of royal propaganda, there are several inscriptions by Nabonidus, some dated more than a decade into his reign (at a point when he no longer needed to justify his rule with legitimacy) wherein he points out that he did not covet the throne. In one inscription, Nabonidus describes himself as visiting the sanctuaries of Marduk and Nabû in search for guidance, with a troubled conscience and questioning if his accession was legitimate:

It is thus possible that whereas Nabonidus was a prominent figure in the group of conspirators that deposed and killed Labashi-Marduk, he had no intention of assuming the throne himself but was convinced to by the other conspirators. It is probable that the chief orchestrator behind the conspiracy against Labashi-Marduk was Nabonidus&#x27;s son, Belshazzar. Belshazzar was the chief beneficiary of the entire affair, as he became the designated heir to the throne, and also inherited the large private estates of Labashi-Marduk, becoming one of the richest and most prominent men in Babylonia overnight. Belshazzar could not have claimed the throne for himself while his father was still alive, but by placing his father on the throne, an old man (meaning that his reign could be expected to be transitional, only lasting a few years), Belshazzar thought the throne secured for himself in the future.

=== Early reign ===

The earliest recorded activity of Nabonidus as king was visiting the city of Sippar on 4 July 556 BC, where he donated three minas of gold in the city&#x27;s temple, the Ebabbar temple. The purpose of the visit may have been political, given that Sippar recognised Labashi-Marduk as king just two weeks prior, nearly a month after Nabonidus had been proclaimed king.

In the fall of 556 BC, Nabonidus led the Babylonian army on a campaign to Hume, eastern Cilicia, where Neriglissar had campaigned in 557 BC. That Nabonidus campaigned there so shortly after Neriglissar&#x27;s campaign could suggest that Syria, which was under Bablyonian suzerainty, was threatened by raiders from Cilicia, or could point towards Nabonidus, in general, being concerned about the security of the empire. This initial campaign was successful and prisoners, gifts and booty were brought back to Babylon to use in the annual New Year&#x27;s festival. Babylonian records give the number of prisoners later distributed as temple slaves as 2,850. After celebrating the New Year&#x27;s festival, Nabonidus embarked on a short trip to southern Babylonia, visiting the cities of Kish, Larsa, Uruk and Ur. At Uruk, he conducted detailed reorganisations of the Eanna temple, making adjustments to the scheme of sacrificial offerings, and restored some offerings that had been interrupted under Neriglissar&#x27;s reign. One inscription suggests that Nabonidus went on a second successful campaign to Cilicia in 555 BC, on the way perhaps attacking the city Hama in Syria, but the record is fragmentary.

Though Nabonidus made the traditional royal donations to the temples in Babylon, the major building effort of his reign, proclaimed as his intention shortly after he became king, was restoring the temple Ekhulkhul, the temple dedicated to Sîn in Harran, which had been destroyed by the Medes in 610 BC. Nabonidus noted at the beginning of his reign that the date of the temple&#x27;s destruction was a strange coincidence: it had been destroyed exactly 54 years before he became king. 54 years is three 18-year cycles, or a complete cycle of the moon. Though the Elhulkhul was not restored until after Nabonidus returned from a long period of staying in Tayma in Arabia, it is possible that construction work started considerably earlier and it appears to have been his goal since he assumed the throne. Nabonidus&#x27;s inscriptions also mention that the Medes threatened Harran, &quot;surrounding&quot; it, and it is possible that building work was postponed until later in his reign due to the threat of Median raiders disturbing the building efforts. According to his inscriptions Nabonidus had been ordered to restore the temple by both Marduk and Sîn in a dream, and the gods had assured him that the Medes would eventually be restored so that construction could begin without being threatened by raids. In addition to Nabonidus&#x27;s own religious beliefs, the restoration of the Ekhulkhul, and the city of Harran surrounding it, may also have been politically motivated. Since the downfall of Assyria, political hegemony in the Near East had been divided between Babylonia and the Medes, an issue that remained unresolved by the time of Nabonidus. As Nabonidus often refers to, and likens himself to, his predecessors Nebuchadnezzar II and Neriglissar, both conquerors and warriors, and several inscriptions allude to Nabonidus being preoccupied with military matters in his accession year, it seems that Nabonidus was preparing to resolve the matter.

=== Nabonidus in Tayma ===
In May 553 BC, Nabonidus departed to campaign in Arabia, initially to suppress a rebellion in the Anti-Lebanon Mountains. The Babylonians achieved victory relatively quickly, and Nabonidus still remained near the Anti-Lebanon Mountains in August, overseeing the transport of supplies back to Babylon. After a period of illness, Nabonidus then moved on Amurru and Edom and captured an otherwise unknown city. By December 553 BC or January 552 BC, Nabonidus was campaigning in Arabia, fighting against the king of Dadanu. By March or April, Nabonidus had defeated the king of Dadanu, and had captured other cities in Arabia, including the city of Tayma, which he had established as a provisionary seat for himself by the summer of 552 BC. Babylonian sources state that Nabonidus conquered Arabian lands as far south as Medina (called Yatribu at this time). After conquering Tayma, Nabonidus would stay there for about a decade, not returning to Babylon until September or October of 543 or 542 BC. October 543 BC is the return date most supported by surviving Babylonian documentation. The purpose for this prolonged stay, effectively self-exile, in Tayma are unclear and debated, with no proposed explanation having universal support.

The history of this period is poorly known and cannot be reconstructed in great detail, on account of a lack of sources. Entries in several royal chronicles for this period are completely, or nearly completely, missing. According to the Verse Account of Nabonidus, a biased document probably written in the reign of Cyrus the Great (who ultimately deposed Nabonidus), Nabonidus conducted extensive building work at Tayma, fortifying it with new walls, embellishing it with new buildings and constructing a royal palace similar to, but likely considerably smaller than, his royal palace at Babylon, essentially rebuilding the city in a Babylonian fashion. Modern archaeological excavations at Tayma has revealed that the city underwent considerable expansion during the 6th century, including the construction of an extensive irrigation system. Some motifs on some of the ruins point towards a clear Babylonian influence, such as an offering table with a crescent, a star and a winged disk (reminiscent of religious motifs in Babylonia).

The reason for the Arabian campaign in the first place is not difficult to ascertain, as it probably represents the next step in the growing expansionism of Babylonia in the west. Babylonian forces had first come into contact with the Arabian kingdoms proper with the conquest of the Levant from Assyria, and the campaign was most likely intended to expand the Babylonian Empire westwards. Due to the many trade routes passing through Arabia, the region was incredibly wealthy and represented an appealing target. It is possible that the intention of conquering Tayma was to control these important trade routes that ran through the city (including the major trade route from Egypt to Babylon). To efficiently reap the benefits of the trade route, authority would have had to be enforced by a strong, local Babylonian force. However, stationing a Babylonian force at Tayma and leaving a governor in charge would have sufficed, the king would not have needed to stay in Arabia for ten years in order to pacify the region. Furthermore, beyond economical gains, the Tayma region was not of much strategic use. The Arabs were not a threat to Babylon, or any other power at this time, and though Egypt was a potentially powerful adversary, dealing with the Egyptians through fortifying a city isolated deep in Arabia, rather than fortifying and garrisoning the Babylonian lands in Palestine, would have been an unlikely strategy. Due to the remote and inaccessible location of Tayma, an argument that Nabonidus intended to move the centre of gravity of his empire westwards, through constructing a new capital there, has no basis.

Though Nabonidus could have been motivated to stay in Tayma for religious reasons, given that there were several prominent lunar deities in the region and Nabonidus was a devotee of the moon god Sîn, it seems unlikely that such a large endeavour would have been motivated solely by faith. Per Wiseman, any religious explanations for the prolonged stay at Tayma can be discarded as no sources mention the presence or construction of Babylonian temples, or a temple dedicated to Sîn, in the city. Beaulieu also points out that the Verse Account of Nabonidus, otherwise very focused on the king&#x27;s religious beliefs, makes no mention of any religious activities at Tayma, which it surely would have done had the campaign and prolonged stay been religiously motivated. 

During Nabonidus&#x27;s stay at Tayma, his son and heir Belshazzar was put in charge of ruling in Babylon as regent. It is possible that the prolonged stay in Tayma was the result of a political struggle with a faction, possibly led by his own son Belshazzar, opposing Nabonidus&#x27;s reformist religious stance, and an agreement was reached to go into self-imposed exile while Belshazzar ruled as regent in Babylon. In his own inscriptions, Nabonidus attributes his stay at Tayma to the &quot;impiety of the Babylonians&quot;.

Nabonidus probably only campaigned in the west after making sure that the Medes in the north were no longer a threat. Beaulieu believes it possible that Nabonidus had encouraged Cyrus the Great to rebel and wage war against the Medes, and had even allied with him, seeing as the beginning of Nabonidus&#x27;s stay in Tayma coincides with the beginning of Cyrus&#x27;s reign. Per, Beaulieu: &quot;unless one assumes that the king was totally devoid of strategic ability, it seems hard to believe that he would have engaged a significant part of the Babylonian army in a long campaign to Arabia without making sure that the northern and eastern borders of the empire would be secure, at least for a certain number of years&quot;. As the stay in Tayma continued, Cyrus the Great consolidated a vast empire under his rule. Belshazzar as regent became acutely aware of the threat presented by Cyrus&#x27;s growing Achaemenid Empire, as he is recorded as having expended resources at projects in Sippar and nearby defenses.

=== Religious policies ===

Nabonidus has typically been characterised as attempting religious reforms in Babylonia, wishing to raise the moon god Sîn to the status of supreme deity and demoting the Babylonian national deity Marduk. The elevation of Sîn was similar to how the deity Inanna was elevated to a prominent position in Uruk during the time of the Akkadian Empire, more than a thousand years prior, or how Marduk had originally been elevated in Babylonia under Nebuchadnezzar I ( 1125–1104 BC). In contrast to these earlier successful exaltations, the attempt to elevate Sîn met with failure. This failure is because the exaltation of Sîn met with considerable opposition within Babylonia itself, and because the invasion and conquest by the Persians put an end to the political means with which the exaltation could be completed.

In addition to building inscriptions, the Verse Account of Nabonidus also alludes to attempts to establish Sîn as the foremost god of the Mesopotamian pantheon. The publication of the Verse Account in 1924 saw scholarly attention being given to other inscriptions and records concerning Nabonidus. Notably, many of his inscriptions fail to acknowledge Marduk as the head of the pantheon, or omit him entirely, and they often contain disproportionate praise for Sîn. It seems probable that Nabonidus&#x27;s devotion to Sîn steadily increased throughout his reign, as the epithets granted to Marduk and Sîn throughout his reign varied considerably. Even early in his reign, the epithets granted to Marduk were only the minimum, epithets such as &quot;king of the gods&quot;, &quot;lord of lords&quot; and &quot;leader of the gods&quot;, a notably smaller array of titles than usual. In contrast Sîn is granted a large array of epithets, including some previously unheard of, with examples such as &quot;shining god&quot;, &quot;light of mankind&quot;, &quot;exalted god&quot; and &quot;exalted lord&quot;. Nabonidus could hardly have moved to issue religious reforms early in his reign, especially as he had only taken the throne through usurpation. His early inscriptions are ostensibly orthodox, though point towards intentional restraint in glorifying Marduk and intentional disproportionate glorification of Sîn.Inscriptions from the time Nabonidus spent in Tayma seem to suggest that the king returned to &quot;orthodoxy&quot; during this period, with inscriptions no longer glorifying Sîn to a disproportionate degree (the deity barely being mentioned) and instead giving Marduk more elaborate and appropriate epithets, such as &quot;foremost of the gods&quot;, &quot;lofty king of the gods&quot;, &quot;lord of everything&quot; and &quot;king of heaven and the underworld&quot;. These inscriptions stand in sharp contrast to inscriptions by Nabonidus in the years after his return to Babylon, wherein Sîn is repeatedly exalted and Marduk is more or less ignored, with the exception of one inscriptions where he appears merely as Sîn&#x27;s companion. It is possible that the return to orthodoxy during Nabonidus&#x27;s time in Tayma was because Babylonia was under the regency of Belshazzar, who might have convinced Nabonidus to stay away from Babylonia and instituted a clear return to orthodoxy, fearing confrontation with the oligarchy and clergy.

Inscriptions from the time after Nabonidus&#x27;s return to Babylon suggest he was no longer hesitant to exalt Sîn, and that he began imposing a religious reform that went as far as to reject Marduk, who had been Babylon&#x27;s undisputed supreme deity for at least six centuries. Several inscriptions attribute Marduk&#x27;s traditional titles, for instance &quot;king of the gods&quot; and &quot;father and creator of the gods&quot; to Sîn, for instance this inscription concerning building work at the Ebabbar temple in Larsa (not the same temple as the one of the same name at Sippar), attributes Marduk&#x27;s traditional titles to Sîn:

Some inscriptions also point towards an attempt at historical revisionism, with the successes of Nebuchadnezzar II being attributed to in inscriptions not to Marduk, but to Sîn, and one inscription describing Sîn, rather than the Assyrian deity Ashur, as having entrusted the Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal with universal rule. Sîn also replaced Marduk&#x27;s role of calling rulers forth for kingship. One inscription states that Nabonidus had been destined for kingship by the deities Sîn and Ningal (Sîn&#x27;s consort) in his mother&#x27;s womb. The exaltation of Sîn reached its height after the rebuilding of the Ekhulkhul and Nabonidus&#x27;s latest known text containing religious elements goes as far as to refer to Marduk&#x27;s traditional dwellings in Babylon, the temples Esagila and Ezida, as the temples and dwellings of Sîn. Though it does not appear that the Esagila was ever &quot;usurped&quot; by Sîn, replacing Marduk in the temple by Sîn was a plan seriously considered by Nabonidus, who justified it by pointing out that there was lunar symbolism in temple through it being marked with a crescent symbol, which must have meant that it was originally intended for Sîn. In one inscription, Sîn is given the epithet &quot;god of gods&quot;, the highest known epithet ever given to a Mesopotamian deity.

Concrete evidence surrounding Nabonidus&#x27;s religious ideas is relatively scarce and no surviving documents contain any theological foundations for the king&#x27;s faith and beliefs. Not all historians share the view that Nabonidus was a religious reformer. According to Donald Wiseman, Nabonidus &quot;did not seek to create any exclusive role for [Sîn] in Babylon&quot;. Wiseman characterises Nabonidus as deeply religious and in support of Marduk, as all other Babylonian kings. In addition to the Elhulkhul temple, Nabonidus is also recorded in inscriptions as having conducted restoration work at temples in Babylon itself, Larsa, Sippar and Nippur. Wiseman attributes the opposition by religious official towards Nabonidus to that the king had introduced a new royal cash box in temples and sanctuaries, wherein some of the income of the temples was to be provided to the king, under the supervision of royal officials, and notes that Cyrus the Great&#x27;s later documents referring to Nabonidus as irreverent in regards to Marduk could be propaganda. Though Nabonidus uses uncharacteristically high epithets for Sîn in many inscriptions, Weiherhäuser and Novotny pointed out that a majority of these epithets are generally limited to inscriptions and texts that document work on the Ekhulkhul temple in Harran, Sîn&#x27;s cultic centre. Thus, Weiherhäuser and Novotny do not consider the evidence strong enough to support the idea that Nabonidus fanatically promoted Sîn, and sought to fully replace Marduk, within Babylonia itself.

=== Late reign and fall of Babylon ===

It is unclear why Nabonidus returned to Babylon from Tayma. Potential explanations include fearing the growing power of Cyrus the Great or perhaps serious disagreements with Belshazzar on religion and the extent of his authority. Upon his return, he also swiftly began to seriously institute his intended religious reforms, perhaps expending so much effort because of his advanced age and wanting to see the reforms through before he died. The major project of Nabonidus&#x27;s later reign was the completion of the building projects at the Ekhulkhul in Harran, with the temple rebuilt directly on top of its original foundation. Nabonidus himself considered the rebuilding of the temple to be the major achievement of his reign. Building work was also conducted in Ur, Larsa, Sippar and Akkad. Some evidence suggests that there was famine in Babylonia during Nabonidus&#x27;s later reign. Nabonidus appears to have attributed it to a sign of Sîn&#x27;s wrath that the people were not responsive to the king&#x27;s religious reforms, whereas the populace likely attributed it to Marduk&#x27;s wrath with the king&#x27;s heretical faith.

The New Year&#x27;s festival, suspended during the king&#x27;s absence in Tayma, was celebrated in its traditional manner annually once again after Nabonidus returned. It is noteworthy that the festival was suspended in Nabonidus&#x27;s absence given that it was effectively an annual reinstatement of Marduk&#x27;s authority and was conducted to ensure the well-being of Babylon. The threat of Cyrus loomed ever closer. Though the records are too fragmentary to tell with certainty, it appears that there was already a confrontation between Persian and Babylonian troops in the winter of 540/539 BC, near Uruk. After the celebration of the New Year&#x27;s festival in 539 BC, Nabonidus had the statues of the gods of Uruk, Akkad, Kish, Marad and Khursagkalamma brought to the capital for safety, the conventional first step in anticipation of attacks from the north-east. This suggests that Nabonidus expected a Persian attack and was making preparations several months before it came. Though this was the conventional method to protect the divine statues in times of war (victorious enemies typically stole cultic statues), transport of statues in this fashion caused considerable disruption in the cults of the gods transported. For instance, the transport of the statue of Ishtar from Uruk to Babylon probably meant that offerings of food and drink had to be carried from Uruk to Babylon to give to the statue, to ensure that the cult was not interrupted.

The gods of some cities close to Babylon, such as Cutha, Sippar and Borsippa, were not brought to the capital. The reason for this is not known, but speculative explanations have been proposed. Sidney Smith, who published the translation of the Nabonidus Cylinder, suggested in 1924 that Nabonidus could have summoned the statues of those cities to the capital as well, but that the local priesthoods were disgusted by Nabonidus&#x27;s attempt at religious reform and thus refused. Smith later proposed an alternative hypothesis, wherein he postulated that Sippar, Borsippa and Cutha were in the Babylonian heartland, protected by strong fortifications and the Median Wall (built under Nebuchadnezzar II to protect against attacks from the north), and as such would not have needed to send their statues to Babylon for protection, whereas more outlying cities such as Uruk were not as well-protected. This seems unlikely given that Kish and Khursagkalamma were closer to Babylon than Sippar was. Furthermore, Stefan Zawadzki demonstrated in 2012 that Sippar did send certain gods to Babylon, just not their main statue of their patron deity Shamash. This means that the explanation of Sippar and the other cities refusing to send their gods to Babylon seems unlikely. Zawadzki offered several possible explanations, including that Sippar wished to celebrate its traditional cultic rituals, which were close in time to the Persian invasion, and that there thus was not any time to transfer the statue to Babylon, or that perhaps Nabonidus himself had ordered the statue to remain in Sippar. Nabonidus might have ordered this since he intended to stop the Persians a short distance north of Sippar, and removing the statue from Sippar could have been construed as Nabonidus not having faith in his own victory.

Shortly after the last gods had entered Babylon, Cyrus invaded Babylonia. Despite Nabonidus&#x27;s preparations, Babylonia fell to the Persians relatively quickly, the conflict lasting less than a month. It seems probable that the Persian invasion was preceded by a revolt by a man by the name Ugbaru, who might have been the appointed Babylonian governor of the region of Gutium. Ugbaru revolted against Nabonidus, joined Cyrus, and was made the primary general in the Babylonian campaign. Depending on when it took place, Ugbaru&#x27;s revolt may have been one of the factors that made Nabonidus return from Tayma. Cyrus&#x27;s first move was to attack the city of Opis. The battle of Opis was a decisive Persian victory, inflicting heavy casualties on the Babylonians and forcing the Babylonian forces to retreat beyond the Median Wall. Shortly thereafter, on 10 October 539 BC, Sippar was taken by Cyrus without a fight and Nabonidus retreated to Babylon. Why Sippar surrendered without a fight is not clear. It is possible the authorities at Sippar were disgruntled with Nabonidus&#x27;s religious policies or else viewed the Babylonian defeat at Opis as so decisive that further resistance was pointless. Evidently there was some confusion at the time given that a tablet from Sippar, dated to 11 October (the day after the city&#x27;s fall) was still dated to the reign of Nabonidus.

On 12 October, the Persian army, led by the governor Ugbaru, entered Babylon without a fight. The last tablet dated to Nabonidus&#x27;s reign is from Uruk and is dated to 13 October, which is usually considered the end date of his reign. Shield-bearing Persian troops were assigned to guard the temples of Babylon, so that priests in safety could continue their services and rituals. On 29 or 30 October, Cyrus himself entered Babylon as its new king. He received the acclamation of the people, though whether it was as a liberator from oppression, as Cyrus presented himself, or as a conqueror, is open to interpretation. The end of Nabonidus&#x27;s reign is sometimes alternatively dated to Babylon&#x27;s fall to the Persians on 12 October, a day earlier than the last tablet dated to Nabonidus&#x27;s reign, or to Cyrus&#x27;s entry into the city, when Cyrus formally became king.

== Fate ==
Ancient accounts differ as to the fate of Nabonidus after the fall of Babylon. The 5th/4th-century BC Greek historian Xenophon wrote that Ugbaru (or &#x27;Gobryas&#x27;) killed Nabonidus upon the capture of Babylon, but it is possible that Xenophon meant Belshazzar, whose death at the fall of Babylon is also recorded in the Biblical Book of Daniel. Berossus wrote that Nabonidus surrendered to Cyrus at Borsippa after the fall of Babylon who dealt with him &quot;in a gracious manner&quot;, sparing his life and allowing him to retire, or possibly appointing him to be a governor, in Carmania (approximately the modern Kerman Province in Iran), where Nabonidus lived out the rest of his life. The royal chronicle simply states that Nabonidus was captured in Babylon after retreating, leaving his subsequent fate unclear. The Dynastic Prophecy corroborates Berossus&#x27;s account, by stating that Nabonidus was removed from his throne and settled &quot;in another land&quot;. If Berossus is believed, Nabonidus lived into the reign of Darius the Great (522–486 BC), outliving both Cyrus and Cyrus&#x27;s son and successor Cambyses II, given that Berossus claims that &quot;King Darius, however, took away a part of his province for himself&quot;. Given the age of his mother at the time of her death, it is not impossible that Nabonidus too would have lived for over a century.

The fate of Belshazzar is unknown, given that none of the sources describe what happened to him. It is typically assumed that Belshazzar was killed by the Persians at Babylon when the city fell, on 12 October, though he may alternatively already have been killed at the battle of Opis, captured and executed, or exiled together with his father.

== Family, children and descendants ==

Details on Nabonidus&#x27;s family are scarce. He likely had a large family even prior to becoming king, seeing as his mother Adad-guppi in her inscriptions claims that she had great-great-grandchildren, and Nabonidus was presumably Adad-guppi&#x27;s only child. Adad-guppi having great-great-grandchildren means that Nabonidus would have had great-grandchildren early in his reign, though the names, lineage, number and genders of these descendants are not mentioned. The known children of Nabonidus are:

* Belshazzar (Akkadian: &quot;Bēl-šar-uṣur&quot;) – a son. Crown prince throughout Nabonidus&#x27;s reign and regent 553–543/542 BC.
* Ennigaldi-Nanna (Akkadian: &quot;En-nigaldi-Nanna&quot;) – a daughter. Consecrated by her father as an &quot;entum&quot;-priestess in Ur.
* Ina-Esagila-remat or Ina-Esagila-risat (Akkadian: &quot;Ina-Esagil-rīšat&quot;) – a daughter. Mentioned as the recipient of a tithe at Sippar, otherwise little is known of her.
*Akkabuʾunma (Akkadian: &quot;Akkabuʾunma&quot;, exact reading uncertain) – a daughter. Recorded in archival texts at Sippar.
*Possibly another daughter recorded in archival texts at Sippar, however, her name is unknown.
Some later Babylonians would lay claim to descent from Nabonidus. Nidintu-Bêl, who rebelled against the Achaemenid king Darius the Great in late 522 BC and was proclaimed as Babylon&#x27;s king, took the name Nebuchadnezzar III and claimed to be a son of Nabonidus. Nidintu-Bêl&#x27;s real father was a man named Mukīn-zēri from the local prominent Zazakku family. Less than a year after Nidintu-Bêl&#x27;s defeat, Babylon rebelled against Darius again in 521 BC. This time, the leader was Arakha, who like Nidintu-Bêl proclaimed himself to be a son of Nabonidus and took the name Nebuchadnezzar IV. Arakha was actually the son of a man by the name of Haldita and was not a native Babylonian, but rather a Urartian (Armenian).

== Legacy ==

=== Character and remembrance ===
No other Neo-Babylonian king has been characterised in as varied a manner as Nabonidus. Though some Classical authors forgot, or omitted, details of Nabonidus in their accounts of Babylonia, only preserving him as a name in their lists of kings, the Achaemenid Empire that succeeded the reign of Nabonidus in Babylonia viewed his rule as an example that should never be emulated. The Achaemenids did not consider Nabonidus&#x27;s more traditional work, restoring temples etc., to be important, but emphasised in their historiography the points when Nabonidus went contrary to what was expected of a Babylonian king. Cyrus the Great justified his conquest of Babylon by presenting himself as a champion divinely ordained by Marduk and by writing accounts of Nabonidus&#x27;s &quot;heretical&quot; acts. 

After the fall of Babylon, a legend of Nabonidus having been mad, on account of his religious policies, gradually formed, which would eventually find its way into Hellenistic and Jewish tradition. Some believe that in the Book of Daniel, Nabonidus&#x27;s supposed madness is reattributed to Nebuchadnezzar II. The accusation of insanity is not found in any cuneiform sources. The Verse Account is highly critical of Nabonidus, especially his religious policies, and though it presents Cyrus the Great as a liberator rather than conqueror, it makes no direct claim that Nabonidus was insane. The Dynastic Prophecy and the Cyrus Cylinder offer similar accounts, criticising Nabonidus and his policies, but not characterising him as mad. Some Babylonian sources are more neutral. The Babylonian Chronicle, a more objective account of Babylonian history, records the king as being absent from Babylon for years on end, and the resulting suspension of the New Year&#x27;s festival, but does not pass any judgement on these events. In his history of Babylonia, Berossus presents Nabonidus as a usurper, which Nabonidus himself admitted to being, but reports nothing that could be construed as negative assessment of the king. As such, it is clear that contemporary views of Nabonidus were not completely negative. Had the Babylonians universally dismissed Nabonidus as an incompetent and impious heretic, it is also unlikely that two later Babylonian rebels would have claimed to be his sons. Cuneiform sources suggest that the Babylonians remembered Nabonidus as unorthodox and misguided, but not insane.

The Aramaic Prayer of Nabonidus, one of the texts found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, written centuries later, contains what might be the origin of the tale of Nabonidus being mad. The prayer claims that Nabonidus was afflicted with a terrible skin disease for seven years, which he was cured of by praying to the god of the Jews. The story is similar to Mesopotamian traditions of kings being cursed by the gods with skin diseases and being forced to wander the arid steppes like wild animals. There is a similar text from the Hellenistic period at Uruk, which ascribes Shulgi ( 2094–2046 BC), a king of the Third Dynasty of Ur, as being cursed with a skin disease after desecrating Marduk and elevating Sîn in his place. It is not unlikely that this legend was then associated with Nabonidus, who had elevated Sîn in Marduk&#x27;s place, with later Jewish chroniclers associating skin disease with madness, and associating the tale of being condemned to wander the desert like a wild animal with Nabonidus&#x27;s prolonged stay at Tayma.

Modern historians have characterised Nabonidus in various ways. When more of his inscriptions, combined with literary sources describing him and his time, were uncovered in the first half of the 19th century, Nabonidus came to be described in different eccentric ways. Some characterised him as an old antiquarian uninterested in government affairs, focused solely on archaeological excavations. Others viewed Nabonidus as an evil usurper, whose incompetence resulted in the fall of his ancient empire. Others saw Nabonidus as a religious fanatic, obsessed with making the moon god the supreme deity of his empire. According to Beaulieu, the picture historians have of Nabonidus today is as a clearly able ruler, who tried to save the Neo-Babylonian Empire, a powerful but hastily built and politically unstable realm, from its internal instability and its desperate geopolitical position. Lambert characterised Nabonidus as &quot;the most individualist ruler of his time&quot; on account of his unorthodox religious policies and his prolonged stay in Arabia. Weiershäuser and Novotny wrote that contrary to the overtly negative assessments from the Persian period, Nabonidus was a relatively successful ruler, undertaking many building projects, leading his armies in successful campaigns far away from the Babylonian heartland and ensuring that his empire prospered. Weierhäuser and Novotny considered Nabonidus to be &quot;undoubtedly one of the most vibrant personalities of ancient Mesopotamia&quot;.

=== Nabonidus as an archaeologist ===
Nabonidus has sometimes been described as the &quot;first archaeologist&quot;. Nabonidus conducted excavations founded on the well-established Mesopotamian idea that in order to properly renovate and rebuild a temple, its foundations had to be excavated so that it could be restored in accordance with its original plans. There is evidence that Nabonidus was more of an antiquarian than his predecessors, such as Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar II, who conducted similar excavations during their restoration work on temples.

Nabonidus&#x27;s activities and his inscriptions suggest a particular interest in history. He notably revived the office of &quot;entum&quot;-priestess in Ur and consecrated his daughter in that office, and his inscriptions as king also mention previous Babylonian and Assyrian rulers, as far back as Eriba-Marduk (who reigned as king of Babylon in the 8th century BC). Evidence that Nabonidus was more interested in history than his predecessors also exists in that Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar II were often very brief in their descriptions of items found during the excavations of the temples, only briefly mentioning finding the foundation deposits of temples and which king had deposited the stone. Nabonidus on the other hand is more explicit and in three known instances even attempted to date these preceding rulers, placing Shagarakti-Shuriash ( 1245–1233 BC) 800 years before his own reign and Naram-Sin of Akkad ( 2254–2218 BC) 3200 years before his own reign. His attempted dating of Naram-Sin&#x27;s reign, based on what was found during the excavation of a temple built by the king, is the earliest known dating of an archaeological artifact, and though Nabonidus&#x27;s proposed date is off by about 1,500 years, it was still a very good estimate considering the lack of accurate dating technology. In his inscriptions, Nabonidus is also the only Neo-Babylonian king to speculate on why the temples he restored had fallen into disrepair in the first place, such as explaining how the sack of Harran by the Medes had damaged the temples in the city.

When rebuilding the Ebabbar temple in Sippar, Nabonidus discovered a statue of Sargon of Akkad ( 2334–2279 BC). Nabonidus restored the damaged statue because of his &quot;reverence of the gods&quot; and his &quot;respect for kingship&quot;. The reasoning for restoring the statue is thus not only attributed to religious factors, but also to an interest in Sargon as a king, and respect for the Akkadian Empire, the first imperial period of ancient Mesopotamia. Following the discovery of the statue, Nabonidus appears to have conducted other work that suggests an interest in the Akkadian Empire, such as restoring the temple dedicated to Ishtar at Akkad, as well as an excavation of Naram-Sin&#x27;s palace in Akkad. These excavations, though mostly beginning as restorations of religious buildings, also uncovered archaeological artefacts that were used for political, as well as scholarly, purposes. In contrast to preceding Neo-Babylonian kings, who had been largely silent about Assyria, Nabonidus clearly positioned himself and the Babylonian kings as the successors of the Assyrian kings, calling them his &quot;royal ancestors&quot;, who had ruled as universal monarchs throughout the Near East. Association with the Akkadian kings through excavations might thus have been partially politically motivated, linking the Neo-Babylonian Empire not only to the Neo-Assyrian Empire, but also to the old Akkadian Empire.

== Titles ==

In two of his known inscriptions, Nabonidus assumes the traditional titulary of the old Neo-Assyrian kings (though omitting the title &#x27;king of Assyria&#x27;), in sharp contrast to the otherwise typically modest titularies of the Neo-Babylonian kings. His titulary, as used in an inscription intended for Harran (i.e. within former Assyria), after the rebuilding of the Ekhulkhul, Nabonidus used the following titles:

The use of typical Assyrian titles such as &#x27;king of the Universe&#x27; and &#x27;king of the Four Quarters&#x27;, as well as the epithets &#x27;strong king&#x27; and &#x27;great king&#x27;, might derive from inscriptions by Assyrian kings being discovered at Harran during the building work at the Ekhulkhul, and Nabonidus assuming those titles as part of his claim to the heritage of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. More noteworthy is the presence of certain Assyrian titles in some inscriptions intended for Babylonia proper. The title &#x27;king of the Universe&#x27; was for instance incorporated into Nabonidus&#x27;s titles as displayed in an inscription at Ur:

There are also more standard Babylonian examples of Nabonidus&#x27;s title, prior to the rebuilding of the Ekhulkhul, without Assyrian elements:

A longer variant, from an inscription describing renovation work on Babylon&#x27;s walls, reads:

<doc id="256679" wikidata="Q116784" url="?curid=256679" title="List of rivers of Albania">
<text>Albania has an extensive hydrographic network of 152 rivers and streams, including 10 large rivers flowing from southeast to northwest, mainly discharging towards the Adriatic Sea. Combined, they produce a total annual flow rate of .

In the mountainous regions, the rivers meander through narrow valleys with steep banks and great depth, collecting streams and silt during heavy rains. Their beds become erosive, causing frequent changes in their paths.

The rivers are mainly fed by atmospheric precipitation (65-92%) and underground water (8-35%), with an average rainfall layer of 1,494 mm and a runoff layer of 945 mm. Water flow varies by season, with winter having the largest annual flow (40%), followed by spring, autumn, and summer. The rivers contain an average mineralization of 150 to 500 mg/L and an average annual volume of suspended solids of 60 million tons, with greater erosion occurring in the catchment basins of Osum, Devoll, and Erzen. Temperatures in the winter months fall to 3.5-8.9°C, and in the summer months reach 17.8-24.6°C.

<doc id="256686" wikidata="Q767798" url="?curid=256686" title="South Queensferry">
<text>Queensferry, also called South Queensferry or simply &quot;The Ferry&quot;, is a town to the west of Edinburgh, Scotland. Traditionally a royal burgh of West Lothian, it is now administered by the City of Edinburgh Council. It lies ten miles to the north-west of Edinburgh city centre, on the shore of the Firth of Forth between the Forth Bridge, Forth Road Bridge and the Queensferry Crossing.

The prefix &quot;South&quot; distinguishes it from North Queensferry, on the opposite shore of the Forth for postal services. Both towns on the Forth derive their name from the ferry service established by Queen Margaret in the 11th century, which continued to operate at the town until 1964, when the Road Bridge was opened.

South Queensferry has been named the most beautiful town in Scotland following a 2025 Telegraph study of 1,250 towns across the UK.

The 2022 census counted 10,216 residents in South Queensferry, as it was listed at that time. Its population at the 2011 census was 9,026 based on the 2010 definition of the locality which in addition to the burgh includes Dalmeny.

==Toponymy==
The Gaelic name &quot;Taobh a Deas Chas Chaolais&quot; means &quot;[the] Southern Side of [the] Steep Strait&quot;. The name &quot;Cas Chaolas&quot; (Steep Strait) is older than the English name; it can be applied to either North or South Queensferry, or both. The queen referred to is Saint Margaret of Scotland who is believed to have established a ferry at this point for pilgrims on their way north to St Andrews. She died in 1093 and made her final journey by ferry to Dunfermline Abbey. Her son, David I of Scotland, awarded the ferry rights to the abbey.

== Local Traditions ==

=== Christmas in Queensferry ===

A local showcase of talent and celebration in preparation for Christmas. The community gather together for a series of performances from Queensferry&#x27;s local people. The night ends with a firework display and a switch on of the towns decoration.

=== The Ferry Fair ===
A local fair dates from the 12th century. The modern fair, dating from the 1930s, takes place each August and includes the crowning of a local school-girl as the Ferry Fair Queen, accompanied by a Ferry Fair Court of other school-children, a procession of floats, pipe bands, and competitive events such as the Boundary Race. The Fair had a dedicated radio station, Jubilee1, which in May 2007 was awarded a licence to evolve into a full Public Service Community Station for North and South Queensferry.

=== The Burry Man ===
Queensferry hosts the strange annual procession of the Burry Man during the Ferry Fair. This unique cultural event is over three hundred years old, and likely pagan in origin. The name &#x27;Burry Man&#x27; almost certainly refers to the hooked fruits of the burdock plant - burrs - in which he is covered, although some have suggested that it is a corruption of &#x27;Burgh Man&#x27;, since the town is traditionally a royal burgh.

A local man is covered from head-to-toe in sticky burrs which adhere to undergarments covering his entire body, leaving only the shoes, hands and two eye holes exposed. On top of this layer he wears a sash, flowers and a floral hat and he grasps two staves. His ability to bend his arms or sit down is very restricted during the long day and his progress is a slow walk with frequent pauses. Two attendants in ordinary clothes assist him throughout the ordeal, helping him hold the staves, guiding his route, and fortifying him with whisky sipped through a straw, whilst enthusiastic children go from door-to-door collecting money on his behalf. The key landmarks on the tour are the Provost&#x27;s office and each pub in the village.

=== The Loony Dook ===

The name &quot;Loony dook&quot; is a combination of &quot;Loony&quot; (short for &quot;lunatic&quot;) and &quot;dook&quot;, a Scots term meaning &quot;dip&quot; or &quot;bathe&quot;, and is an event whereby people dive into the freezing waters of the Firth of Forth on New Year&#x27;s Day, often in fancy dress. In recent years the event has attracted people from all over the world, including many people visiting Edinburgh to celebrate Hogmanay. A proposal to charge people to participate in this event was introduced in 2011, the proceeds of which benefit RNLI Queensferry.

The event was conceived in 1986 as a joking suggestion by three locals for a New Year&#x27;s Day hangover cure. The following year it was decided to repeat the event for charity. It has grown to become part of the official Edinburgh Hogmanay celebrations although originally organised solely by locals who utilised facilities at the Queensferry Arms Hotel (now Orocco Pier) for many years for access and changing before and after the event. As the popularity of the event grew participants later paraded ahead of the dook from the Moorings pub (now the Inchcolm) but from 2011, due to factors such as increased crowds, safety issues and popularity, the event has been handled by the organisers of Edinburgh&#x27;s Hogmanay, with the parade now starting from the Hawes Promenade at the other end of the town. Up to 2016 two of the original Dookers, James MacKenzie and Ian &#x27;Rambo&#x27; Armstrong, have the distinction of taking part in every Loony Dook and the two wore specially designed T-shirts with 30yrs to celebrate the achievement.

The event has inspired similar, though smaller in scale, annual New Year Loony Dooks, such as in North Berwick in East Lothian and Kirkcaldy in Fife, both also on the Firth of Forth.

=== Brass band ===
Queensferry has a community brass band that evolved from being a school brass band to a youth band and finally to its present status as a competing adult band. It came third in the 2006 Scottish Brass Band Championships 4th section contest and fourth in 2007. In addition to competing, it takes part in many community events including the Ferry Fair and Christmas in Queensferry light switch-on event.
There is also a school brass band that has won the Community section of the Scottish Youth Brass Band Championships in 2005 and 2006.

==Places of interest==
=== Churches ===
St Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Church, also known as the Priory Church, is the town&#x27;s oldest building, built for the Carmelite Order of friars in the 1450s. It is the only medieval Carmelite church still in use in the British Isles, and is a Category A listed building. After the Scottish Reformation of 1560 it served as the parish church until 1635. In 1890 it was reconsecrated for the Scottish Episcopal Church.

The Old Parish Church on The Vennel dates from 1633 and has an interesting early graveyard. The church became known as the South Church in 1929, and served the Church of Scotland congregation until 1956, when it united with St Andrew&#x27;s Church. The old South Church building was sold in 1970 and is now a house.

The building which now houses Queensferry Parish Church, located in The Loan, was originally built as South Queensferry United Free Church. Following the union of the Church of Scotland and the United Free Church of Scotland in 1929, the UF Church became known as St Andrew&#x27;s Church and the old Church of Scotland congregation as the South Church. The two congregations were united in 1956, becoming Queensferry Parish Church. The Reverend John Carrie was minister from 1971 until his untimely death in 2008. In 1972 he started an annual sponsored walk across the Forth Road Bridge for Christian Aid, so far raising over £1,000,000. In 2009 the Rev. David Cameron transferred from Newton Mearns to Queensferry Parish Church.

St Margaret&#x27;s Roman Catholic church is also located on The Loan. Mass is celebrated daily.

=== Stately homes ===
* Hopetoun House - Two miles to the west, a splendid Georgian stately home designed by the Scottish architects Sir William Bruce and William Adam and situated in 150 acres (607,000 m2) of parkland. Home to the Earls of Hopetoun since 1699. 
* Dalmeny House - Two miles to the east, Dalmeny House was built by English architect William Wilkins in 1817 and is the home of the Earls of Rosebery. It houses the Rosebery and some of the Rothschild collections.
* Dundas Estate - One mile to the south. A 9-hole golf course has been established in its parkland since the 1920s. Each year it hosts a &quot;The Life of Jesus Christ&quot;, an Oberammergau-type open-air passion play.

=== Other significant buildings ===

Black Castle is a house on the High Street built in 1626. When the original owner, a sea-captain, was lost at sea, his maid was accused of paying a beggar-woman to cast a spell. Both women were burned for witchcraft. Plewlands House is a 17th-century mansion in the centre of the village. It was restored in the 1950s as flats, and is now managed by the National Trust for Scotland. South Queensferry Tolbooth, on the High Street, dates from the 17th century, with a clock-tower built in 1720.

The Hawes Inn, dating from the 17th century, lies east of Queensferry, almost under the Forth Bridge on its south side. It features in Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Kidnapped&quot;. Opposite the Hawes Inn is the pier which served the ferry (from which the town derives its name) until the opening of the Forth Road Bridge. The pier is now used by tourist boats including the ferry to Inchcolm.

Modern day Orocco Pier, latterly named the Queensferry Arms Hotel, has been a local inn and place of refreshment since 1664. Located opposite the Jubilee Clock Tower, at 17 High Street, its original facade still boasts many of its original features.

South Queensferry Cemetery on Ferrymuir Lane at the south end of the town is unremarkable other than for the very large number of Royal Navy war graves, many for casualties of the Battle of Jutland (1916) who were brought here for burial. It is maintained and operated by the City of Edinburgh Council. It superseded the small graveyard on The Vennel in the centre of town.

Opened in March 2007 by Dakota Hotels, the &#x27;black box&#x27; seen from the A90 is a hotel, Bar &amp; Grill.

=== Mesolithic settlement ===
In 2012 as part of the excavations for the new Forth road crossing archaeologists excavated the remains of a mesolithic dwelling dating to around 10,000 years ago and believed to be the earliest home discovered in Scotland, and possibly the entire UK.

=== Schools ===

Queensferry has four primary schools (Echline Primary, Queensferry Primary, St Margaret&#x27;s RC Primary and Dalmeny Primary) and one secondary school (Queensferry High School), with Kirkliston Primary also part of its catchment area.

=== Landmarks ===
The local brewery, Ferry Brewery, makes beers named after landmarks around the town, including the Ferry Crossing and the Three Bridges.

<doc id="256687" wikidata="Q1304622" url="?curid=256687" title="List of mountains in Albania">
<text>Albania is mostly mountainous, with the first alpine regions forming towards the end of the Jurassic period. During the Cenozoic era, the malformation of the &quot;Albanides&quot; accelerated, causing the subterranean landscape to take its present form. The average altitude of the country is , almost three times that of Europe. The highest summits are situated in the Albanian Alps and the eastern mountain range, with Korab being the highest peak, at above sea level.

The country&#x27;s geography is unique due to its location and varied relief, with landscapes ranging from mediterranean in the west to a more continental influence in the east and mountainous terrain in the interior and east. This combination of plains, hills, and mountains has resulted in a diverse range of geographical features, extending horizontally and vertically. However, this complexity has made regionalization challenging, as different authors have used alternating criteria and methods. In the 1920s, Herbert Louis proposed a scheme that divided Albania into two large regions: Inner Albania and Coastal Albania, each with specific subdivisions. His scheme was widely used until 1964, when it was to be replaced by Pandi Geço&#x27;s proposed scheme which divided the country into four physiographic regions, listed as follows: Albanian Alps, Central Mountain Region, Southern Mountain Region, Albanian Coastal Lowlands and its hills. By 1990, Geço&#x27;s scheme was improved through further research and consideration of ecological concerns, recapping all regions into 67 constituent subunits.

The earliest written accounts on the mountains of Albania can be attributed to German geographer Kurt Hassert, who explored the northern region of the country in June 1897, carrying out his first expedition to Mount Cukal.

Distaptur Editions published in 1941 a mountain guidebook titled &quot;Montagne d&#x27;Albania&quot;, authored by renowned Italian alpinist Piero Ghiglione and printed by the &quot;Geographical Institute De Agostini of Novara&quot;. The guidebook includes a study of the rhapsodes of Albanian mountains by Nicola Lo Russo Attoma and contains 118 pages, featuring 60 black and white illustrations from photographs taken by Ghiglione.

The first post-war mountaineering expedition in Albania was organized by the Committee of Physical Culture and Sports and was held at Mount Tomorr on July 27-28, 1949. A different expedition in the same mountain took place the following year on May 21, 1950, with Minella Kapo, a delegate from the highest forum leadership of the Committee, and an experienced mountaineering instructor, in attendance to witness the name-changing ceremony of the main peak from Çuka e Tomorrit to &quot;Çuka Partizani&quot;. According to mounteneering expert Aleksandër Bojaxhi, the new designation of this mountain peak and others that followed, was not decided by party officials or institutions but by sports forums and even mountaineers themselves.

The mountain peaks listed below are arranged by their massifs. Occasionally, the highest peak of the massif is listed instead, if it holds greater notability. The remaining mountains on the list are important landmarks of biodiversity, history, culture and economic impact.

<text>In English law, a fee simple or fee simple absolute is an estate in land, a form of freehold ownership. A &quot;fee&quot; is a vested, inheritable, present possessory interest in land. A &quot;fee simple&quot; is real property held without limit of time (i.e., permanently) under common law, whereas the highest possible form of ownership is a &quot;fee simple absolute&quot;, which is without limitations on the land&#x27;s use (such as qualifiers or conditions that disallow certain uses of the land or subject the vested interest to termination).

The rights of the fee-simple owner are limited by government powers of taxation, compulsory purchase, police power, and escheat, and may also be limited further by certain encumbrances or conditions in the deed, such as, for example, a condition that required the land to be used as a public park, with a reversion interest in the grantor if the condition fails; this is a fee simple conditional.

==History==
The word &quot;fee&quot; is related to the term fief, meaning a feudal landholding. Feudal land tenures existed in several varieties, most of which involved the tenant having to supply some service to his overlord, such as knight-service (military service). If the tenant&#x27;s overlord was the king, grand serjeanty, then this might require providing many different services, such as providing horses in time of war or acting as the king&#x27;s ceremonial butler. These fiefs gave rise to a complex relationship between landlord and tenant, involving duties on both sides. For example, in return for receiving his tenant&#x27;s fealty or homage, the overlord had a duty to protect his tenant. When feudal land tenure was abolished, all fiefs became &quot;simple&quot;, without conditions attached to the tenancy.

==Common law==
In English common law, the Crown had radical title or the allodium of all land in England, meaning that it was the ultimate &quot;owner&quot; of all land in the past feudal era. Allodial title is reserved to governments under a civil law structure.

However, the Crown can grant ownership in an abstract entity – called an estate in land – which is what is owned rather than the land it represents. The fee simple estate is also called &quot;estate in fee simple&quot; or &quot;fee-simple title&quot;, or sometimes simply &quot;freehold&quot; in England and Wales. From the start of the Norman period, when feudalism was introduced to England, the tenant or &quot;holder&quot; of a fief could not alienate (sell) it from the possession of his overlord. However, a tenant could separate a parcel of the land and grant it as a subordinate fief to his own sub-tenant, a process known as sub-enfeoffing or &quot;subinfeudation&quot;. The 1290 Statute of Quia Emptores abolished subinfeudation and instead allowed the sale of fee simple estates.

William Blackstone defined fee simple as the estate in land that a person has when the lands are given to him and his heirs absolutely, without any end or limit put to his estate. Land held in fee simple can be conveyed to whomsoever its owner pleases; it can also be mortgaged or put up as security.
Owners of real property in fee simple have the privilege of interest in the property during their lifetime and typically have a say in determining who gets to own an interest in the property after their death.

Historically, estates could be limited in time. Common temporal limitations include life estate, a land ownership that terminates upon the grantee&#x27;s (or another person&#x27;s) death even if the land had been granted to a third party, or a term of years, a lease for a specified term, such as in an estate for years. A fee also could be limited through the method of its inheritance, such as by an &quot;entailment&quot;, which created a fee tail. Traditionally, fee tail was created by words of grant such as &quot;to N. and the male heirs of his body&quot;, which would restrict those who could inherit the property. If no heirs could be found, then the property would revert to the original grantor&#x27;s heirs. Most common law countries have abolished entailment by statute.

==Duration==
An estate in fee simple denotes the maximum ownership in land that can be legally granted; it is the greatest possible aggregate of rights, powers, privileges and immunities available in land. The three hallmarks of the fee simple estate are that it is alienable, devisable and descendible.

==Creation and characteristic of fee simple==
Rules requiring words of general inheritance to create fee simple by conveyance have been abolished by statute in the United States. To convey an estate in fee simple at common law, the deed or will must state &quot;to B and his heirs&quot;. Anything short of those words transferred a smaller estate.

Modern deeds usually follow a standardized form. There is a presumption that the testator intends to convey his or her property in fee simple unless the will indicates an intention to transfer a smaller estate, such as a life estate.

==Life estate==
Many jurisdictions retain the possibility of creating a life estate, although this is uncommon. In the United States, life estates are most commonly used either to grant someone use of the property for the remainder of that person&#x27;s life in a will, or by a grantor to reserve the right to continue using the property for the remainder of the grantor&#x27;s life after it is sold. The right to ownership of the property after the death of the life estate owner is called the &quot;remainder estate&quot;. In England and Wales fee simple is the only freehold estate that remains; a life estate can only be created in equity and is not a right in property.
===Retained life estate gift===
In the United States, retained life estates are often used by donors who intend to leave property as bequests to charitable organizations while retaining the use of the property during their lifetimes. The donor receives a tax deduction for the gift of their remainder interest in the property, and at the donor&#x27;s death, the property passes to the organization without being subject to probate. Retained life estate gifts often involve agreements about acceptable uses of the property, payment of real estate taxes, property maintenance, etc. during the donor&#x27;s lifetime.

==Types of fee simple==
If previous grantors of a fee simple estate do not create any conditions for subsequent grantees, then the title is called fee simple absolute. A fee simple absolute is the highest estate permitted by law, and it gives the holder full possessory rights and obligations now and in the future. Other fee simple estates in real property include fee simple defeasible (or fee simple determinable) estates. A defeasible estate is created when a grantor places a condition on a fee simple estate (in the deed). When a specified event happens, the estate may become void or subject to annulment. There are two types of defeasible estates: fee simple determinable and the fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. If the grantor uses durational language in the condition such as &quot;to A. as long as the land is used for a park&quot;, then upon the happening of the specified event (in this case if the land is used for anything other than a park), the estate will automatically terminate and revert to the grantor or the grantor&#x27;s estate; this is called a fee simple determinable. If the grantor uses language such as &quot;but if alcohol is served&quot;, then the grantor or the heirs have a right of entry if the condition occurs, but the estate does not automatically revert to the grantor; this is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. In most jurisdictions in the United States these concepts have been modified by statute. Fee simple determinable was generally preferred by courts in the common law of the early United States. Recently, that trend has reversed, and most courts in the United States will find a fee simple subject to condition subsequent in situations where the conveying document&#x27;s language is unclear.

==Rent==
The claim that no rent or similar obligations are due from the owner of property in fee simple is only partially true. For example, a rentcharge may exist requiring a freeholder to pay a fixed sum of money closely resembling rent, and many jurisdictions have created financial obligations that may be imposed on a freehold estate. England and Wales impose an estate charge. In the United States, fee simple owners are usually subject to property tax and the revenue generated is directed to the municipality&#x27;s general fund. Other local tax assessments called &quot;special purpose taxes&quot; may be assessed in addition to the property taxes for specific purposes such as infrastructure improvements. Real estate owned as a condominium is usually similarly owned in fee simple, but typically subject to rules in the declaration of condominium or created by the condominium association, such as paying required monthly fees for maintaining the property&#x27;s common areas; however, these are generally treated legally as covenants running with the land (contracts binding on the possessors of real property) imposing an affirmative duty to pay money rather than as rent for property held in fee simple.

== Etymology ==
Fee – A right in law to the use of land; i.e. a fief. Simple – in the unconstrained sense:
# without limit to the inheritance of heirs;
# unrestricted as to transfer of ownership.
The English word &quot;fee&quot; ultimately goes back to the Proto-Indo-European word &quot;&quot;, which refers to moveable wealth, that is, cattle. The Latin word &quot;pecunia&quot; also comes from this root and becomes &quot;pecuniary&quot; in English. The root appears in Modern German as &quot;Vieh&quot; .

<text>Jules Cotard (1 June 1840 – 19 August 1889) was a French physician who practiced neurology and psychiatry. He is best known for first describing the Cotard delusion, a patient&#x27;s delusional belief that they are dead, do not exist, or do not have bodily organs.

==Biography==

===Education===
He studied medicine in Paris and later went on to work as an intern at Hospice de la Salpêtrière, where he worked for, among others, Jean-Martin Charcot.

===Career===
Cotard became particularly interested in cerebrovascular accidents (commonly known as &#x27;strokes&#x27;) and their consequences and undertook autopsies to better understand how these affected the brain. In 1869, Cotard left Salpêtrière, and at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, he joined an infantry regiment as a regimental surgeon. Cotard moved to the town of Vanves in 1874, where he remained for the last 15 years of his life. He made particular contributions to the understanding of diabetes and delusions. In August 1889, Cotard&#x27;s daughter contracted diphtheria and he reportedly refused to leave her bedside for 15 days until she recovered. He eventually contracted diphtheria himself and died on 19 August.

==In popular culture==
Jules Cotard served as the real-life model for the character of Dr. Cottard in the Marcel Proust novel &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;.

In the film Synecdoche, New York, protagonist Caden Cotard is a reference to the Cotard Delusion.

<doc id="256692" wikidata="Q912579" url="?curid=256692" title="Korab (mountain)">
<text>Korab ( or &quot;Mali i Korabit&quot;; ) is the highest peak of the eponymous mountain range and the fourth-highest mountain located entirely in the Balkan Peninsula, standing at .

Situated on the border between the two countries, Korab is the highest peak of both Albania and North Macedonia and is also one of only two summits in Europe to be the highest point for more than one country. It is also the 18th most prominent mountain peak in Europe and the third on the Balkan Peninsula.

Korab is situated within the Korab-Koritnik Nature Park. It is noted for its rich flora, including species such as Bosnian pine, European beech and alder.

The peak lies next to the Šar Mountains and is part of the national emblem of North Macedonia.

== Geography ==
The Korab range stretches over in a north–south direction between the lower section of the Black Drin and its tributary the Radika. It is around the border triangle of Albania, North Macedonia and Kosovo, southwest of the Šar Mountains.

The peak is a very rugged mountain massif consisting mainly of shale and limestone of the Paleozoic period with block structures, as well as severely damaged gypsum rocks of Permo Triassic. On the west side, the mountain falls steeply over rock walls. The north side consists of craggy rocks. A kind of double peak, that of Korab II is about northwest of the peak within Albanian territory. On the same ridge are two other peaks rising over : Shulani i Radomirës and Korab III. The southeast, stretching from a few rock bands broken by meadows to the summit is easily accessed, and occasionally by shepherds with their flocks of sheep.

In addition to the Korab peak, there are several other, almost equally high elevations. North of the twin peaks are numerous other nameless, almost equally high rock towers. The peak about to the southwest, Korab-gate &quot;(Albanian: Maja e Portës së Korabit; Macedonian: Korapska Mala vrata)&quot; reaches . A few hundred metres south is another peak, Maja e Moravës, which is only a little lower at .

The peaks are occasionally interrupted by radial tectonics in the shape of blocks that end in the Radika valley on North Macedonia&#x27;s side. Some of these blocks have steep slopes reaching up to . In its highest part, above , the climate is alpine and includes some alpine flora elements.

The mountain is home to the spectacular Korab Falls in the upper valley of the Dlaboka River. In springtime, the waterfall reaches a height of over 130 meters, making it the highest in North Macedonia. The state border intersects the higher peak, Great Korab.

Ascent from the Macedonian side involves entering the Macedonian–Albanian boundary area, for which a special permit is required from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of North Macedonia, although people regularly trek on Korab without it.

The two main passes in the Korab ridge are the Little Korab Gate () and Big Korab Gate ().

The mountain has a number of sub-peaks that are higher than 2000 metres. These include Korab II (unnamed peak) , Korab III (unnamed peak) , Korab Gates (peak) , Maja e Moravës , Shulani i Radomirës and Small Korab .

== Climbing ==
There are no formal restrictions on climbing the mountain from the Albanian side. The area is now safer and more stable than it has been in recent times. It is possible to drive as far as the local village of Radomira, but the local infrastructure is generally not good. A four-wheel drive vehicle with high clearance may be required. There are no accurate and up-to-date maps, local signposting is poor, and hikers may have to overcome the additional problem of aggressive dogs. 
It is also possible to ascend from the North Macedonia side, starting at the Strezimir border outpost. When approaching from North Macedonia, hikers will be required to report to the border checkpoint and present their passport. An international expedition to climb Mount Korab is organised each September by the mountain club PSD &quot;Korab&quot; in Skopje.

<text>In English common law, fee tail or entail is a form of trust, established by deed or settlement, that restricts the sale or inheritance of an estate in real property and prevents that property from being sold, devised by will, or otherwise alienated by the tenant-in-possession, and instead causes it to pass automatically, by operation of law, to an heir determined by the settlement deed. The terms &quot;fee tail&quot; and &quot;tailzie&quot; are from Medieval Latin , which means &quot;cut(-short) fee&quot;. Fee tail deeds are in contrast to &quot;fee simple&quot; deeds, possessors of which have an unrestricted title to the property, and are empowered to bequeath or dispose of it as they wish (although it may be subject to the allodial title of a monarch or of a governing body with the power of eminent domain). Equivalent legal concepts exist or formerly existed in many other European countries and elsewhere; in Scots law tailzie was codified in the Entail Act 1685.

Most common law jurisdictions have abolished fee tails or greatly restricted their use. They survive in limited form in England and Wales, but have been abolished in Scotland, Ireland, and all but four states of the United States.

==Purpose==
The fee tail allowed a patriarch to perpetuate his blood-line, family-name, honour and armorials in the persons of a series of powerful and wealthy male descendants. By keeping his estate intact in the hands of one heir alone, in an ideally indefinite and pre-ordained chain of succession, his own wealth, power and family honour would not be dissipated amongst several male lines, as became the case for example in Napoleonic France by operation of the Napoleonic Code which gave each child the legal right to inherit an equal share of the patrimony, where a formerly great landowning family could be reduced in a few generations to a series of small-holders or peasant farmers. It therefore approaches the true corporation which is a legal body or person which does not die and continues in existence and can hold wealth indefinitely. 

Indeed, as a form of trust, whilst the individual trustees may die, replacements are appointed and the trust itself continues, ideally indefinitely. In England almost seamless successions were made from patriarch to patriarch, the smoothness of which were often enhanced by baptising the eldest son and heir with his father&#x27;s Christian name for several generations, for example the FitzWarin family, all named Fulk. Such indefinite inalienable land-holdings were soon seen as restrictive on the optimum productive ability of land, which was often converted to deer-parks or pleasure grounds by the wealthy tenant-in-possession, which was damaging to the nation as a whole, and thus laws against perpetuities were enacted, which restricted entails to a maximum number of lives.

An entail also had the effect of disallowing illegitimate children from inheriting. It created complications for many propertied families, especially from about the late 17th to the early 19th century, leaving many individuals wealthy in land but heavily in debt, often due to annuities chargeable on the estate payable to the patriarch&#x27;s widow and younger children, where the patriarch was swayed by sentiment not to establish a strict concentration of all his wealth in his heir leaving his other beloved relatives destitute. Frequently in such cases the generosity of the settlor left the entailed estate as an uneconomical enterprise, especially during times when the estate&#x27;s fluctuating agricultural income had to provide for fixed sum annuities. Such impoverished tenants-in-possession were unable to realise in cash any part of their land or even to offer the property as security for a loan, to pay such annuities, unless sanctioned by private Act of Parliament allowing such sale, which expensive and time-consuming mechanism was frequently resorted to. The &quot;beneficial owner&quot; (or tenant-in-possession) of the property in fact had only a life interest in it, albeit an absolute right to the income it generated, the &quot;legal owners&quot; being the trustees of the settlement, with the remainder passing intact to the next successor or heir in law; any purported bequest of the land by the tenant-in-possession was ineffective.

==History==
Fee tail was established during feudal times by landed gentry to attempt to ensure that the high social standing of the family, as represented by a single patriarch, continued indefinitely. The concentration of the family&#x27;s wealth into the hands of a single representative was essential to support this process. Unless the heir had himself inherited the personal and intellectual strengths of the original great patriarch, often a great warrior, which alone had brought him from obscurity to greatness, he would soon sink again into obscurity, and required wealth to maintain his social standing. This feature of English gentry and aristocracy differs from the aristocracy which existed in pre-Revolution France, where all sons of a nobleman inherited his title and were thus inescapably members of a separate noble caste in society. Little-known, France then had one of the lowest ratios of noble families to population, in Europe. The accepted rule was however largely compensated by written or notarized wills which allowed fathers to favour, within certain limits, a first-born son. In England, primogeniture provided that an estate would be inherited entirely by the first-born legitimate son of a nobleman and that, accordingly, subsequent sons were born as mere gentlemen and commoners. Without the support of wealth, these younger sons might quickly descend into obscurity, and often did. On this eldest son was concentrated the honour of the family, and to him alone was granted all its wealth to support his role in that regard, by the process of the fee tail.

The effects of English primogeniture and entail have been significant plot details or themes in a number of notable works of English literature. (See some examples cited below.)

===Statute of Westminster 1285===
The Statute of Westminster II, passed in 1285, created and fixed the form of this estate. The new law was also formally called the statute &quot;De Donis Conditionalibus&quot; (Concerning Conditional Gifts).

===Opponents===
Fee tail was never popular with the monarchy, the merchant class and many holders of entailed estates themselves who wished to sell or divide their land.

===Abolition===
Fee tail as a legal estate in England was abolished by the Law of Property Act 1925. However, they continued to exist as equitable interests (see below).

===Continuing use===
A fee tail can still exist in England and Wales as an equitable interest, behind a strict settlement; the legal estate is vested in the current tenant for life or other person immediately entitled to the income, but on the basis that any capital money arising must be paid to the settlement trustees. A tenant in tail in possession can bar his fee tail by a simple disentailing deed, which does not now have to be enrolled. A tenant in tail in reversion (i.e., a future interest where the property is subject to prior life interest) needs the consent of the life tenant and any &#x27;special protectors&#x27; to vest a reversionary fee simple in himself. Otherwise he can only create a base fee; a base fee only confers a right to the property on its owner, when its creator would have become entitled to it; if its creator dies before he would have received it, the owner of the base fee gets nothing.

No new fees tail can now be created following the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996.

In the U.S., conservation easements are a form of entail still in use.

==Creation==
Traditionally, a fee tail was created by a trust established in a deed, often a marriage settlement, or in a will &quot;to A and the heirs of his body&quot;. The crucial difference between the words of conveyance and the words that created a fee simple (&quot;to A and his heirs&quot;) is that the heirs &quot;in tail&quot; must be the children begotten by the landowner. It was also possible to have &quot;fee tail male&quot;, which only sons could inherit, and &quot;fee tail female&quot;, which only daughters could inherit; and &quot;fee tail special&quot;, which had a further condition of inheritance, usually restricting succession to certain &quot;heirs of the body&quot; and excluding others. Land subject to these conditions was said to be &quot;entailed&quot; or &quot;held in-tail&quot;, with the restrictions themselves known as &quot;entailments&quot;.

==Breaking of fee tail==
The breaking of a fee tail was simplified by the Fines and Recoveries Act 1833, which allowed the holders of property in tail to file a disentailing assurance freeing them from its conditions; such a document needed to be enrolled. This obviated the previous method of breaking entails, the arcane legal fictions that enabled the system of common recovery.

The requirement that a disentailing assurance should be enrolled was abolished in 1926.

==Mortgage of entailed lands==
Lending upon security of a mortgage on land in fee tail was risky, since at the death of the tenant-in-possession, his personal estate ceased to have any right to the estate or to the income it generated. The absolute right to the income generated by the estate passed by operation of law to parties who had no legal obligation to the lender, who therefore could not enforce payment of interest on the new tenants-in-possession. The largest estate a possessor in fee tail could convey to someone else was an estate for the term of the grantor&#x27;s own life. If all went as planned, it was therefore impossible for the succession of patriarchs to lose the land, which was the idea.

==Failure of issue==

Things did not always go as planned, however. Tenants-in-possession of entailed estates occasionally suffered &quot;failure of issue&quot; – that is, they had no legitimate children surviving them at the time of their deaths. In this situation the entailed land devolved to male cousins, i.e., back up and through the family tree to legitimate male descendants of former tenants-in-possession, or reverted to the last owner in fee simple, if still living. This situation produced complicated litigation and was an incentive for the production and maintenance of detailed and authoritative family pedigrees and supporting records of marriage, births, baptisms etc.

Depending on how the original deed or grant was worded, in the event of there being daughters but no sons, all the sisters might inherit jointly, it might pass to the eldest sister, it might be held in trust until one of them should produce a (legitimate) son, or it might pass to the next male-line relative (an uncle, say, or even a cousin, sometimes very distant). The last possibility, commonly called &#x27;entailment to heirs male&#x27;, is used in Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;; the estate of Longbourn is entailed to a distant male cousin rather than the incumbent&#x27;s five daughters or their offspring.

==Common recovery==
In the 15th century, lawyers devised &quot;common recovery&quot;, an elaborate legal procedure which used collaborative lawsuits and legal fictions to &quot;bar&quot; a fee tail, that is to say to remove the restrictions of fee tail from land and to enable its conveyance in fee simple. Biancalana&#x27;s book &quot;The Fee Tail and the Common Recovery in Medieval England: 1176–1502&quot; (2001) discusses the procedure and its history at length.

==Resettlement==
In the 17th and 18th centuries the practice arose whereby when the son came of age (at 21), he and his father acting together could bar the existing fee tail, and could then re-settle the land in fee tail, again on the father for life, then to the son for life and his heirs male successively, but at the same time making provision for annuities chargeable on the estate for the father&#x27;s widow, daughters and younger sons, and most importantly, and as an incentive for the son to participate in the re-settlement, an income for the son during his father&#x27;s lifetime. This process effectively evaded the law against perpetuities, as the entail in law had been terminated, but in practice continued. In this way an estate could stay in a family for many generations, yet emerged on re-settlement often fatally weakened, or much more susceptible to agricultural downturns, from the onerous annuities now chargeable on it.

==Formedon==
Formedon (or &quot;form down&quot; etc.) was a right of writ exercisable by a holder in fee for claiming property entailed by a lessee beyond the terms of his feoffment. A letter dated 1539 from the Lisle Letters describes the circumstances of its use:
I received your ladyship&#x27;s letter by which ye willed me to speak with my Lady Coffyn for her title in East Haggynton in the county of Devon who had one estate in tail to him and to his heirs of her body begotten; and now he is dead without issue of his body so that the reversion should revert to Mr John Basset and to his heirs so there be no let nor discontinuance of the same made by Sir William Coffyn in his life. Howbeit Mr Richard Coffyn, next heir to Sir William Coffyn, claimeth the same by his uncle&#x27;s feoffment to him and to his heirs so that the law will put Mr John Basset from his entry and to compel him to take his action of &quot;form down&quot; which is much dilatory as Mr Basset knoweth

==Historical examples==

===Marquess of Hertford===
An English example of a fee tail may be the main estates of the wealthy art collector Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford (d. 1870). His only child was his illegitimate son, Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet, to whom he left as much of his property as he could. The main land holdings and Ragley Hall were inherited by his distant cousin, Francis Seymour, 5th Marquess of Hertford, descended from a younger son of the 1st Marquess who had died in 1794. Most of the 4th Marquess&#x27;s art collection had been acquired by himself or his father, went to Wallace, and is now the Wallace Collection. Other works were covered by the fee tail, however, and passed to the 5th Marquess.

===Earl of Pembroke===
Another example was George Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke, who died in 1827. He had quarrelled with his eldest son, later the 12th Earl, and left his unentailed estate to Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea, his son by a second marriage.

==Fees tail in fiction==
Fees tail figure in the plots of several well known novels and stories, particularly in the 19th century, including:

* &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1813) by Jane Austen
* &quot;Guy Mannering&quot; (1815) by Walter Scott – inheritance of an estate goes to an heir of tailzie.
* &quot;Middlemarch&quot; (1871–1872) by George Eliot
* &quot;The Belton Estate&quot; (1866) and &quot;Ralph the Heir&quot; (1871) by Anthony Trollope
* &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1886) and &quot;The Master of Ballantrae&quot; (1889) by Robert Louis Stevenson
* &quot;The Adventure of the Priory School&quot; by Arthur Conan Doyle
* &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; by Evelyn Waugh
* &quot;Wideacre&quot; by Philippa Gregory
* &quot;The Quincunx&quot; by Charles Palliser (written in 1989, but it takes the form of a Dickensian mystery set in early-19th-century England)
* &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; by Julian Fellowes (written in 2009–2015, but set in England in the period 1912–1927)
* &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; by Harper Lee (referred to as an &quot;entailment&quot;)
* &quot;Wives and Daughters&quot; by Elizabeth Gaskell

===&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;===
&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; contains a particularly thorny example of the kind of problems which could arise through the entailing of property. Mr. Bennet, the father of protagonist Elizabeth Bennet, had only a life interest in the Longbourn estate, the family&#x27;s home and principal source of income. He had no authority to dictate to whom it should pass upon his death, as it was strictly arranged to be inherited by the next male heir. Had Mr. Bennet fathered a son it would have passed to him, but it could not pass to any of his five daughters. Instead, the next nearest male heir would inherit the property—Mr. Bennet&#x27;s cousin, William Collins, a boorish minister in his mid-twenties. The inheritance of the Longbourn property completely excluded the five Bennet daughters, who were thus to lose their home and income upon their father&#x27;s death. The need for the daughters to make a good marriage to ensure their future security is a key motivation for many episodes in the novel. Many fees tail arose from wills, rather than from marriage settlements which usually made some provision for daughters. Austen was very familiar with the law of entail; her brother, Edward, had inherited similarly entailed estates at Chawton, Godmersham, and Winchester from distant cousins under the will of Elizabeth Knight, who died in 1737.

Law professor Maureen B. Collins (2017) cites several other authors debating the accuracy of Austen&#x27;s depiction of the entailment, including Appel (2013), Treitel (1984), Redmond (1989), and Grover (2014).

==Other countries==

===Scotland===
In Scots law, the word &quot;tailzie&quot; &quot;comes from the French Word &quot;tailier&quot;, to cut&quot;, implying &quot;cutting the ordinary Line of Succession, and giving the Estate to others than those to whom it would have descended by Law.&quot; By the late 18th century it was also known as &quot;entail&quot;, but the archaic spelling continued in law books. The Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 (section 50) abolished all feudal tenures including entail. Today, the doctrines of &quot;legitim&quot; and &quot;jus relictae&quot; restrict owners from willing property out of their family when they die with children or have a surviving partner.

A Scottish example of entail is the case of Alfred Douglas-Hamilton, 13th Duke of Hamilton, who in 1895 inherited from the 12th Duke, his fourth cousin, who had attempted to marry his daughter to the heir.

===Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, Section 13 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 largely abolished the fee tail and converted existing fees tail to fees simple. For constitutional reasons, this section is subject to a saving clause which prevents the conversion of fees tail to fees simple where the protector of the settlement is still alive. Therefore, some fees tail still exist in the state.

===United States===
The fee tail has been abolished in all but four states in the United States: Massachusetts, Maine, Delaware, and Rhode Island. However, in the first three states, property can be sold or deeded as any other property would be, with the fee tail only applying in case of death without a will. In Rhode Island, a fee tail is treated as a life estate with remainder in the life tenant&#x27;s children. New York abolished fee tail in 1782, while many other states within the U.S. never recognized it at all. In most states in the United States, an attempt to create a fee tail results in a fee simple; even in those four states that still allow fee tail, the estate holder may convert his fee tail to a fee simple during his lifetime by executing a deed.

In Louisiana, the common law concept of estates in land never existed. The concept of forced heirship and the marital portion protects force heirs and surviving spouses from total divestment of value of the estate of the decedent, who has a duty to provide for their care.

Fee tail-like restrictions still exist though contractual obligations. For example, owners of inholdings inside public lands may be prevented from selling or giving their land to non-family members. In this case, the restrictions result from an agreement between the government and the land owner, and is not a part of a deed or settlement.

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===
In the Kingdom of Poland and later in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, fee tail estates were called (; landed property in ). was an economic institution for governing of landed property introduced in late 16th century by king Stefan Batory. was abolished by the agricultural reform in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. was the title of the principal heir of .

According to the rules of , which became a statute approved by the Sejm, the estate was not to be divided between the heirs but inherited in full by the eldest son (primogeniture). Women were excluded from inheritance (Salic law). could not be sold or mortgaged.

 was similar to the French law of or German and Scandinavian , and succession to such resembles that of British peerages.

Many Polish magnates&#x27; fortunes were based on , among them those of the Radziwiłłs, Zamoyskis, Czartoryskis, Potockis and Lubomirskis. Most important were veritable little principalities. The earliest and most extensive include:
* , created for Mikołaj VII Radziwiłł, Albrecht Radziwiłł and Stanisław Radziwiłł in 1589, centered on Olyka, Nesvizh, and Kletsk
* , created for Janusz Ostrogski in 1609, later inherited by the Zaslawski, Lubomirski and Sanguszko families, centered on Ostroh
* , created for Jan Zamoyski in 1589, centered on Zamość
* , created for Rafał Jarosławski in 1470, centered on Jarosław
* , created for Piotr and in 1601, later inherited by the Wielopolski family, centered on Pińczów

===Other===
Other European legal systems had comparable devices to keep estates together, especially in Spain and Northern European countries like Prussia. They are derived from , a legal institution in Roman law. Unlike most of the English aristocracy, the Prussian supported fees tail, and succeeded in reinstating them in 1853, after they had been abolished in a recent Constitution. In Germany and Austria the was only abolished in 1938, and in Scandinavia they persisted even later – a few old Swedish fees tail still remain in force, though no new ones may be established. For the law of German and Austrian fideicommissa in particular, an 862-page manual by the German legal scholar Philipp Knipschildt, entitled – , was the standard reference work. First published in 1654, this grand systematization of existing legal opinion was frequently reprinted and continued to be consulted until well into the 19th century.

<text>The American Association for the Abolition of Involuntary Mental Hospitalization (AAAIMH) was an organization founded in 1970 by Thomas Szasz, George Alexander, and Erving Goffman for the purpose of abolishing involuntary psychiatric intervention, particularly involuntary commitment. The founding of the AAAIMH was announced by Szasz in 1971 on the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot; and &quot;American Journal of Psychiatry&quot;. In the Platform Statement of the association, one can read:
Board chairman of the association was Thomas Szasz. The association provided legal help to psychiatric patients and published a journal, &quot;The Abolitionist&quot;. The organisation was dissolved in 1980.

<text>In common law and statutory law, a life estate (or life tenancy) is the ownership of immovable property for the duration of a person&#x27;s life. In legal terms, it is an estate in real property that ends at death, when the property rights may revert to the original owner or to another person. The owner of a life estate is called a &quot;life tenant&quot;. The person who will take over the rights upon death is said to have a &quot;remainder&quot; interest and is known as a &quot;remainderman&quot;.

==Principles==

The ownership of a life estate is of limited duration because it ends at the death of a person. Its owner is the life tenant (typically also the &#x27;measuring life&#x27;) and it carries with it right to enjoy certain benefits of ownership of the property, chiefly income derived from rent or other uses of the property and the right of occupation, during his or her possession. Because a life estate ceases to exist at the death of the measuring person&#x27;s life, the life tenant, a temporary owner, may short-term let but cannot sell, give or bequeath the property indefinitely (including assuming it could pass to heirs (intestate)) or creating a purported document leaving it to devisees (testate).

A life estate &quot;pur autre vie&quot; (Law French, &quot;for the life of another&quot;) is held for the rest of the lifetime of a person who does not hold the estate, known as the cestui que vie (Law French, &quot;the person who lives&quot;). This form of life estate arises where a life tenant has disposed of the property, assuming such a disposal does not trigger any special forfeiture under the life interest instrument. It also arises where the grantor chooses to make the measuring life that of someone other than the life tenant&#x27;s life. A life estate &quot;pur autre vie&quot; is most commonly created in one of two circumstances.
*First, when the owner of property conveys his interest in that property to another person, for the life of a third person. For example, if A conveys land to B during the life of C, then B owns the land for as long as C lives; if B dies before C, B&#x27;s heirs will inherit the land, and will continue to own it for as long as C lives.
*Second, if A conveys land to C for life, C can then sell the life estate to B. Again, B and B&#x27;s heirs will own the land for as long as C lives.
*In either scenario, once C dies, the ownership of the land will revert to A. If A has died, ownership will revert to A&#x27;s heirs. The right to succeed to ownership of the property upon the expiration of the life estate is called a &quot;reversion&quot;. However, the remainder interest granted to a third party (A to B for life, with a remainder interest in C), is called &quot;remainder&quot;.

A clear distinction should be made with an estate for (a) term of years, interpreted as lease or licence.

At death, assuming no mis-dealings to certain innocent purchasers, the property involved in a life estate falls into the ownership of the remainderman ( &quot;remaindermen&quot;) or reverts to its grantor (all of which confusingly can be called &#x27;reversions&#x27; and &#x27;reversioners&#x27;). There is a small market for reversions in real estate, which necessitates a buyer to carry out enhanced documentary due diligence and physical checks.

A land owner of an estate cannot give a &quot;greater interest&quot; in the estate than he or she owns. That is, a life estate owner cannot give complete and indefinite ownership (fee simple) to another person because the life tenant&#x27;s ownership in the property ends when the person who is the measuring life dies. For instance, if Ashley conveyed to Bob for the life of Bob, and Bob conveys a life estate to another person, Charlie, for Charlie&#x27;s life [an embedded life estate], then Charlie&#x27;s life estate interest would last only until Charlie or Bob dies. Charlie&#x27;s life interest or &quot;pur autre vie&quot; interest (interest for the life of another, whichever has applied) and most often the remaining rights of ownership in the property (the &#x27;reversionary interest&#x27;) devolve to the persons under the terms of the will/rules of intestacy/declaration of trust/trust deed (UK) or will/rules of intestacy/&#x27;grant or deed of life interest&#x27; (or similar) (U.S.) in remainder or revert to the original grantee, depending on terms of Ashley. Such a life estate in the U.S. can also be conveyed for the life of the grantor, such as &quot;A conveys X to B until A dies&quot; and in the UK by trust transferring upon trust or assigning rather than conveying X.

If a life tenant purports to transfer the underlying &#x27;reversionary&#x27; interest, which a life tenant never has, this constitutes an actionable breach of trust for damages and may constitute criminal fraud however may not entitle the ultimate reversioner (or substituted beneficiaries) to be able to obtain a court declaration that the property is their own if that property is in the hands of an innocent purchaser for value without notice (bona fide purchaser).

Financial and physical responsibility falls to the life tenant under the legal doctrine of waste, which prohibits life tenants from damaging or devaluing the asset. In short, as the life tenant&#x27;s ownership is temporary, failing to maintain or reasonably protect the asset resulting in its diminution in value, or indeed, destruction constitutes a cause of action for the reversioner.

A further limitation is the rule against perpetuities in many states and countries which prohibits long-running pre-19th-century style successions of life tenancies and may result in the premature and compensation-entitling termination of such successive life interests. In England and Wales this is fixed at one lifetime, or 80 years whichever is longer.

Selling property while keeping a life estate is commonly known in France as &quot;viager&quot; where it is used more often than elsewhere, most famously in the case of Jeanne Calment, the longest lived human ever recorded.

In the combined jurisdiction of England and Wales since 1925 a freehold estate intended to be &#x27;held&#x27; as a life interest takes effect only as an interest enjoyed in equity, specifically as an interest in possession trust. The other type of land ownership is leasehold and although most long leases are for a period of between 99 and 999 years &#x27;leases for life&#x27; will be interpreted in often unpredictable ways as either as a licence or a lease.

==Uses of a life estate==
In the United States, a life estate is typically used as a tool of an estate planning. A life estate can avoid probate and ensure that an intended heir will receive title to real property. For example, Al owns a home and desires that Bill inherit it after Al&#x27;s death. Al can effectuate that desire by transferring title to the home to Bill and retaining a life estate in the home. Al keeps a life estate and Bill receives a vested fee simple remainder. As soon as Al dies, the life estate interest merges with Bill&#x27;s remainder, and Bill has a fee simple title. An advantage of such a transfer is that it makes the use of a will unnecessary and eliminates the need to probate the asset. A disadvantage is the small risk of a fraud on the part of beneficiary Bill, if he could easily show in a particular jurisdiction an unfettered fee simple, he could sell the estate prematurely to an innocent purchaser such as when Al is on vacation. A second disadvantage to the grantor is that provision for any remainderman (or men) (party C) is irrevocable without the remainderman&#x27;s consent. &quot;Beneficiary deeds&quot; have been statutorily created in some states to address this issue.

The intestacy laws of certain American states, limit the surviving spouse&#x27;s rights (inheritance) to the deceased spouse&#x27;s real estate to a life estate. Louisiana, applying civil law, has a similar default provision in intestate successions called a usufruct, which is only over community property and ends with the earlier of death or remarriage.

Some American states allow for an enhanced life estate deed, in which the grantor retains the ability to transfer to property to a third party without the consent of the remainderman. If the enhanced life estate holder still owns the property at the time he or she dies, and the remaindermen survive the life estate holder, the property automatically passes to the remaindermen outside of probate. Enhanced life estate deeds are also sometimes referred to as Lady Bird Deeds.

The intestacy laws of England and Wales from 1 October 2014 provide for £250,000 (or the whole non-joint estate if less) and 50% of any excess to the spouse, remainder to adult children. This abolished the remaining 50% being enjoyed as a life interest which had applied from the 1920s.

The surviving spouse (and rarely, others) benefit from survivorship of any joint property.

The arrangement in the first paragraph would in the UK be interpreted as an interest in possession trust and is usually avoided as for inheritance tax is considered &#x27;reservation of benefit&#x27; requiring fully backdated sums of annual income tax on whatever market rent ought to have been paid to the legal owner, in England and Wales for continued enjoyment of the asset.

==Valuation of a life estate==

A valuation is typically derived from the present value of the net benefit derived by the life (or lives) over the residual term of the interest. Where these valuations are based on a single life, reference can be made to tables such as life tenant factors by gender and age. These factors are prepared taking into account life expectancies and prevailing interest rates for a specific jurisdiction or purpose. An example is a table of life tenancy factors that is used to determine the proportion of a property attributable to a particular life tenant for any stamp duty payable upon its transfer. More complicated examples can involve impaired or joint lives and specialist advice is usually required such as that provided by an actuary.

==Duration of a life estate==
Life estates are measured either by the life of the property recipient (&quot;pur sa vie&quot;), or by the life of some other person (&quot;pur autre vie&quot;).

==Validity of a life estate==
===At law and in equity (US)===
Life estates in real estate are still created today. The life estate is more commonly used in trust instruments, typically in an attempt to minimize the effect of the inheritance tax or other taxes on transfers of wealth. A prospective reduction in tax for the creator (&#x27;settlor&#x27;) often follows if the settlor has parted with all current and future interest. However many tax codes transfer the burden of estate taxes to the holder of the interest in possession (life tenant) and may treat that person or the remaindermen as owning a second/surplus property.

Formally, where a system is derived from English law, the law divides into common law and equitable law. A claim under equitable law cannot usually defeat a claim to title from a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, as such a person has reasonably researched the ownership position based upon the legal title (common law) position. The owner of a legal interest can create from a life estate further embedded or legal interests consistent with the form of ownership.

Accordingly, due to their potential versatility and complexity in the U.S., common law seldom recognizes a life estate in personal property (tangible items and livestock other than land including buildings) but such interests are recognized at equity where of adequate form — statutes and regulations impose formalities on the creation of lifetime interests in personalty.

===At equity (England and Wales)===
Since 1925 registered titles in England and Wales preferably should, but mostly do not, reveal an &#x27;interest for life&#x27;, &#x27;life estate&#x27; or &#x27;life tenancy&#x27; in the form of a restriction on the register. Instead the registered legal owner may hold various degrees of leasehold or freehold interest, but usually absolute interest. This provides a reliable &#x27;mirror of title&#x27; which can only be subjected to a very few overriding interests. A maxim of equity is &#x27;Where equities are equal, the law will prevail&#x27;. Equity defers to the position at law of a &quot;bona fide&quot; purchaser for value without notice (including any tenant or mortgagee), and as &#x27;equity will not suffer a wrong to be without remedy,&#x27; where there is such, will be limited to &quot;in personam&quot; remedies against the settlor or life tenant where it confirms life estates, upon trust, to have been validly created:
#for the life tenant(s); and thereafter
#for remainderman, remaindermen or the reversionary settlor.

Life tenants are never recorded as proprietors at the Land Registry as they are temporary, equitable owners and are not entitled to have the a transfer of the land effected. If the proprietor has died, executors of the will, administrators or beneficiaries all have the right to apply for the standard form A restriction and are encouraged by the official guidance to do so.

If a lease is for more than seven years, the lease must be registered. Most long leases are for a period of between 99 and 999 years, and &#x27;leases for life&#x27; will be interpreted either as a licence or a lease.

===Torrens title jurisdictions===
In most Torrens Title jurisdictions a life tenant has, like in UK and US, the right to possession and enjoyment of the property, but once the tenant dies the property will return to the remainderman. The main difference is that, the life estate will be registered by the Registrar general of that jurisdiction, and will appear on the registered title. This has the effect of making them one of the 9 types of recognised interest in land, and one of the four that confirm possession. The registration process in Torrens title systems usually confers indefeasibility on the life estate.

A holder of a life estate can alienate his rights, but they will still expire on his death, regardless of whom he alienates it to. At that point, that buyer will have to forfeit the land.

== Life tenancy investments ==
It is becoming increasingly popular for private investors to place funds into a life tenancy investment. This type of investment is being offered as an alternative to traditional buy to let and is becoming increasingly popular in the United Kingdom with over £30 million worth of Life Tenancies being delivered in 2018.

<doc id="256700" wikidata="Q1166625" url="?curid=256700" title="Mathematical problem">
<text>A mathematical problem is a problem that can be represented, analyzed, and possibly solved, with the methods of mathematics. This can be a real-world problem, such as computing the orbits of the planets in the solar system, or a problem of a more abstract nature, such as Hilbert&#x27;s problems. It can also be a problem referring to the nature of mathematics itself, such as Russell&#x27;s Paradox.

==Real-world problems==
Informal &quot;real-world&quot; mathematical problems are questions related to a concrete setting, such as &quot;Adam has five apples and gives John three. How many has he left?&quot;. Such questions are usually more difficult to solve than regular mathematical exercises like &quot;5 − 3&quot;, even if one knows the mathematics required to solve the problem. Known as word problems, they are used in mathematics education to teach students to connect real-world situations to the abstract language of mathematics.

In general, to use mathematics for solving a real-world problem, the first step is to construct a mathematical model of the problem. This involves abstraction from the details of the problem, and the modeller has to be careful not to lose essential aspects in translating the original problem into a mathematical one. After the problem has been solved in the world of mathematics, the solution must be translated back into the context of the original problem.

==Abstract problems==
Abstract mathematical problems arise in all fields of mathematics. While mathematicians usually study them for their own sake, by doing so, results may be obtained that find application outside the realm of mathematics. Theoretical physics has historically been a rich source of inspiration.

Some abstract problems have been rigorously proved to be unsolvable, such as squaring the circle and trisecting the angle using only the compass and straightedge constructions of classical geometry, and solving the general quintic equation algebraically. Also provably unsolvable are so-called undecidable problems, such as the halting problem for Turing machines.

Some well-known difficult abstract problems that have been solved relatively recently are the four-colour theorem, Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, and the Poincaré conjecture.

Computers do not need to have a sense of the motivations of mathematicians in order to do what they do. Formal definitions and computer-checkable deductions are absolutely central to mathematical science.

==Degradation of problems to exercises==
Mathematics educators using problem solving for evaluation have an issue phrased by Alan H. Schoenfeld:
:How can one compare test scores from year to year, when very different problems are used? (If similar problems are used year after year, teachers and students will learn what they are, students will practice them: problems become exercises, and the test no longer assesses problem solving).
The same issue was faced by Sylvestre Lacroix almost two centuries earlier:
:... it is necessary to vary the questions that students might communicate with each other. Though they may fail the exam, they might pass later. Thus distribution of questions, the variety of topics, or the answers, risks losing the opportunity to compare, with precision, the candidates one-to-another.
Such degradation of problems into exercises is characteristic of mathematics in history. For example, describing the preparations for the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos in the 19th century, Andrew Warwick wrote:
:... many families of the then standard problems had originally taxed the abilities of the greatest mathematicians of the 18th century.

<text>Salon is an American politically progressive and liberal news and opinion website created in 1995. It publishes articles on U.S. politics, culture, and current events.

== Content and coverage ==

&quot;Salon&quot; covers a variety of topics, including reviews and articles about books, films, and music; articles about &quot;modern life&quot;, including friendships, human sexual behavior, and relationships; and reviews and articles about technology, with a particular focus on the free and open-source software (FOSS) movement.

According to the senior contributing writer for the &quot;American Journalism Review&quot;, Paul Farhi, &quot;Salon&quot; offers &quot;provocative (if predictably liberal) political commentary and lots of sex.&quot;

In 2008, &quot;Salon&quot; launched the interactive initiative &quot;Open Salon&quot;, a social content site/blog network for its readers. Originally a curated site with some of its content being featured on &quot;Salon&quot;, it fell into editorial neglect and was closed in March 2015.

Responding to the question, &quot;How far do you go with the tabloid sensibility to get readers?,&quot; former Salon.com editor-in-chief David Talbot said:
== Staff and contributors ==

&quot;Salon.com&quot;, originally salon1999.com, was founded in 1995 by David Talbot, Gary Kamiya, Andrew Ross, Mignon Khargie, Scott Rosenberg, and Laura Miller.

Regular contributors have included the political-opinion writers Amanda Marcotte, Scott Eric Kaufman, Heather Digby Parton and Sean Illing, critic Andrew O&#x27;Hehir and pop-culture columnist Mary Elizabeth Williams.

David Talbot, founder and original editor-in-chief, also served several stints as CEO, most recently replacing Richard Gingras, who left to join Google as head of news products in July 2011. Joan Walsh was the second editor-in-chief, serving in that role starting in 2005. She stepped down as editor-in-chief in November 2010 and was replaced by Kerry Lauerman. David Daley took over the editor-in-chief position in June 2013.

Jordan Hoffner took over as CEO in May 2016, also serving as editor-in-chief. He resigned in May 2019, and was succeeded as editor-in-chief by Erin Keane.

 &quot;Salon&quot;″s CEO was Chris Richmond, and its editor-in-chief was Erin Keane.

== History ==

&quot;Salon&quot; was created in the wake of the San Francisco newspaper strike of 1994, by former &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; arts and features editor David Talbot who wished to explore the potential of Web. It launched as salonmag.com in November 1995. In its early days, readers noticed a specifically Northern California flavor. In 1996, Talbot agreed: &quot;We swim in the soup of San Francisco. There are a lot of odd fish we&#x27;ve plucked out of the bay here and it gives us some of that Left Coast, Weird Coast style.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine named it one of the Best Web Sites of 1996.

&quot;Salon&quot; purchased the virtual community The WELL in April 1999 (switching to its current URL, salon.com, at roughly that time), and made its initial public offering (IPO) of Salon.com on the NASDAQ stock exchange on June 22 of that year. Subsequently, for the month of October 1999, Nielsen/NetRatings reported that &quot;Salon&quot; had over two million users.

&quot;Salon Premium&quot;, a pay-to-view (online) content subscription was introduced on April 25, 2001. The service signed up 130,000 subscribers and staved off discontinuation of services. However, in November 2002, the company announced it had accumulated cash and non-cash losses of $80 million, and by February 2003 it was having difficulty paying its rent and made an appeal for donations to keep the company running.

On October 9, 2003, Michael O&#x27;Donnell, the chief executive and president of Salon Media Group, said he was leaving the company after seven years because it was &quot;time for a change.&quot; When he left, Salon.com had accrued $83.6 million in losses since its inception, and its stock traded for 5¢ on the OTC Bulletin Board. David Talbot, &quot;Salon&quot;&#x27;s chairman and editor-in-chief at the time, became the new chief executive. Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Hambrecht, then &quot;Salon&quot;&#x27;s chief financial officer, became the president.

In July 2008, &quot;Salon&quot; launched &quot;Open Salon&quot;, a &quot;social content site&quot; and &quot;curated blog network&quot;. It was nominated for a 2009 National Magazine Award in the category &quot;best interactive feature.&quot; On March 9, 2015, &quot;Salon&quot; announced it would be closing &quot;Open Salon&quot; after six years of hosting a community of writers and bloggers.

&quot;Salon&quot; closed its online chat board &quot;Table Talk&quot; on June 10, 2011, without stating an official reason for ending that section of the site.

On July 16, 2012, &quot;Salon&quot; announced that it would be featuring content from &quot;Mondoweiss&quot;.

Salon Media Group sold The WELL to the group of members in September 2012.

=== Business model and operations ===
&quot;Salon&quot; has been unprofitable through its entire history. Since 2007, the company has been dependent upon repeated cash injections from board Chairman John Warnock and William Hambrecht, father of former &quot;Salon&quot; CEO Elizabeth Hambrecht. During the nine months ending on December 31, 2012, these cash contributions amounted to $3.4 million, compared to revenue in the same period of $2.7 million. In December 2016 and January 2017, the company was evicted from its New York offices at 132 West 31st Street, a block from Madison Square Garden, for non-payment of $90,000 in back rent. In February 2017, Spear Point Capital invested $1 million into Salon, taking a 29% equity stake and three seats on the company&#x27;s board. On August 30, 2019, Salon.com was sold for $5 million by Salon Media Group () to privately held Salon.com, LLC, which is owned by Chris Richmond and Drew Schoentrup.

Aspects of the Salon.com site offerings, ordered by advancing date:

* Free content: around 15 new articles posted per-day, revenues wholly derived from in-page advertisements.
** Per-day new content was reduced for a time.

== Controversies ==
=== Retracted article on vaccine conference ===

An article called &quot;Deadly Immunity&quot; written by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared on the &quot;Salon&quot; and simultaneously in the July 14, 2005 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The article focused on the 2000 Simpsonwood CDC conference and claimed that thimerosal-containing vaccines caused autism, as well as the conspiracy theory that government health agencies have &quot;colluded with Big Pharma to hide the risks of thimerosal from the public.&quot; The article was retracted by &quot;Salon&quot; on January 16, 2011, in response to criticisms of the article as inaccurate.

=== Otto Warmbier ===
In March 2016, while American tourist Otto Warmbier was imprisoned in North Korea for allegedly trying to steal a propaganda poster there, the site posted an article about him headed: &quot;This might be America&#x27;s biggest idiot frat boy: Meet the UVa student who thought he could pull a prank in North Korea.&quot; After Warmbier&#x27;s death, the article was removed. Andrew O&#x27;Hehir, the executive editor of &quot;Salon&quot;, said the article was a summary of the opinions of television comedian Larry Wilmore.

=== Todd Nickerson ===
In September 2015, &quot;Salon&quot; published an article written by Todd Nickerson, moderator of Virtuous Pedophiles, about his experiences with being a non-offending pedophile, titled: &quot;I&#x27;m a pedophile, but not a monster.&quot; This caused controversy at the time, with some commentators accusing it of being &quot;pro-pedophile&quot; (in the sense of being pro-child sexual abuse) and Nickerson himself subject to a &quot;backlash.&quot; This article, along with an accompanying video and a follow-up article, was deleted in early 2017. Some saw a connection between the removal of the articles and the controversy surrounding Milo Yiannopoulos&#x27;s remarks on child sexual abuse that emerged in February 2017, although Salon Media Group CEO and &quot;Salon&quot; acting editor-in-chief Jordan Hoffner told &quot;New York&quot; magazine that they had been removed in January 2017 due to unspecified &quot;new editorial policies.&quot; A third article by sex researcher Debra Soh defending Nickerson&#x27;s side is still published as of April 2022.

=== Cryptocurrency mining ===

In February 2018, it was noted that &quot;Salon&quot; was preventing readers using ad blockers from seeing its content. Such users are offered a choice of disabling their blocker, or allowing &quot;Salon&quot; to run an in-browser script, using the user&#x27;s resources, to mine Monero, a form of cryptocurrency.

=== Ron DeSantis headline ===
On June 23, 2021, &quot;Salon&quot; published an article with a headline falsely claiming that a bill signed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis would force Florida students and professors to register their political views with the state of Florida. The article went viral on Twitter and its false claim was promoted by various Democratic commentators, by Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Nikki Fried (who later deleted her tweet linking to the &quot;Salon&quot; article), and by novelist Stephen King (who later expressed regret for posting the headline). In 2022, &quot;Salon&quot; executive editor Andrew O&#x27;Hehir said that &quot;Salon&quot; had recently concluded that the headline &quot;conveyed a misleading impression of what the Florida law actually said, and did not live up to our editorial standards&quot;, and the headline was changed. Another &quot;Salon&quot; editor had initially defended the headline in 2021. DeSantis spokesperson Christina Pushaw said that her colleagues had tried unsuccessfully to get &quot;Salon&quot; to change the headline in 2021, adding: &quot;It&#x27;s good to see that &quot;Salon&quot; finally changed its false headline after the pushback they received yesterday. It should have happened much sooner. Better yet, the &quot;Salon&quot; reporter and editors should have read the legislation before writing an article about it (a good practice for journalism, in general!).&quot;

<text>Leo Hendrik Baekeland (; ; November 14, 1863 – February 23, 1944) was a Belgian chemist. Educated in Belgium and Germany, he spent most of his career in the United States. He is best known for the inventions of Velox photographic paper in 1893, and Bakelite in 1907. He has been called &quot;The Father of the Plastics Industry&quot; for his invention of Bakelite, an inexpensive, non-flammable and versatile plastic, which marked the beginning of the modern plastics industry.

==Early life==
Leo Baekeland was born in Ghent, Belgium, on November 14, 1863, the son of a cobbler, Charles Baekeland, and a house maid, Rosalia Merchie. His siblings were: Elodia Maria Baekeland; Melonia Leonia Baekeland; Edmundus Baekeland; Rachel Helena Baekeland and Delphina Baekeland.

He told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot;: &quot;The name is a Dutch word meaning &#x27;Land of Beacons.&#x27;&quot; He spent much of his early life in Ghent, Belgium. He graduated with honours from the Ghent Municipal Technical School and was awarded a scholarship by the City of Ghent to study chemistry at the Ghent University, which he entered in 1880. He acquired a PhD &quot;maxima cum laude&quot; at the age of 21. After a brief appointment as Professor of Physics and Chemistry at the Government Higher Normal School in Bruges (1887–1889), he was appointed associate professor of chemistry at Ghent University in 1889.

== Personal life ==
Baekeland married (1868–1944) on August 8, 1889, and they had two children. One of their grandsons, Brooks married Barbara Daly Baekeland in 1942 and they had one child. Hugh Karraker, one of their great-grandsons, devoted the last years of his life raising awareness of Baekeland&#x27;s impact on modern life. He produced an hour-long documentary, All Things Bakelite, which was shown at film festivals and on PBS stations nation-wide.
==Career==

In 1889, Baekeland and his wife Céline took advantage of a travel scholarship to visit universities in England and the United States. They visited New York City, where he met Professor Charles F. Chandler of Columbia University and Richard Anthony, of the E. and H.T. Anthony photographic company. Professor Chandler was influential in convincing Baekeland to stay in the United States. Baekeland had already invented a process to develop photographic plates using water instead of other chemicals, which he had patented in Belgium in 1887. Although this method was unreliable, Anthony saw potential in the young chemist and offered him a job.

Baekeland worked for the Anthony company for two years, and in 1891, set up in business for himself working as a consulting chemist. However, a spell of illness and disappearing funds made him rethink his actions and he decided to return to his old interest of producing a photographic paper that would allow enlargements to be printed by artificial light. After two years of intensive effort, he perfected the process to produce the paper, which he named &quot;Velox&quot;; it was the first commercially successful photographic paper. At the time, the US was suffering a recession and there were no investors or buyers for his proposed new product, so Baekeland became partners with Leonard Jacobi and established the Nepera Chemical Company in Nepera Park, Yonkers, New York.

In 1899, Jacobi, Baekeland, and Albert Hahn, a further associate, sold Nepera to George Eastman of the Eastman Kodak Co. for $750,000. Baekeland earned approximately $215,000 net through the transaction.

With a portion of the money he purchased &quot;Snug Rock&quot;, a house in Yonkers, New York, where he set up his own well-equipped laboratory. There, he later said,&quot;&quot;in comfortable financial circumstances, a free man, ready to devote myself again to my favorite studies... I enjoyed for several years that great blessing, the luxury of not being interrupted in one&#x27;s favorite work.&quot;&quot;One of the requirements of the Nepera sale was, in effect, a non-compete clause: Baekeland agreed not to do research in photography for at least 20 years. He would have to find a new area of research. His first step was to go to Germany in 1900, for a &quot;refresher in electrochemistry&quot; at the Technical Institute at Charlottenburg.

Upon returning to the United States, Baekeland was involved briefly but successfully in helping Clinton Paul Townsend and Elon Huntington Hooker to develop a production-quality electrolytic cell. Baekeland was hired as an independent consultant, with the responsibility of constructing and operating a pilot plant. Baekeland developed a stronger diaphragm cell for the chloralkali process, using woven asbestos cloth filled with a mixture of iron oxide, asbestos fibre, and iron hydroxide. Baekeland&#x27;s improvements were important to the founding of Hooker Chemical Company and the construction of one of the world&#x27;s largest electrochemical plants, at Niagara Falls.

Baekeland was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1935 and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1936.

==Invention of Bakelite==
Having been successful with Velox, Baekeland set out to find another promising area for chemical development. As he had done with Velox, he looked for a problem that offered &quot;the best chance for the quickest possible results&quot;. Asked why he entered the field of synthetic resins, Baekeland answered that his intention was to make money. By the 1900s, chemists had begun to recognize that many of the natural resins and fibers were polymeric, a term introduced in 1833 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius. Adolf von Baeyer had experimented with phenols and aldehydes in 1872, particularly pyrogallol and benzaldehyde. He created a &quot;black guck&quot; which he considered useless and irrelevant to his search for synthetic dyes. Baeyer&#x27;s student, Werner Kleeberg, experimented with phenol and formaldehyde in 1891, but as Baekeland noted &quot;could not crystallize this mess, nor purify it to constant composition, nor in fact do anything with it once produced&quot;.

Baekeland began to investigate the reactions of phenol and formaldehyde. He familiarized himself with previous work and approached the field systematically, carefully controlling and examining the effects of temperature, pressure, and the types and proportions of materials used.

The first application that appeared promising was the development of a synthetic replacement for shellac (made from the secretion of lac beetles). Baekeland produced a soluble phenol-formaldehyde shellac called &quot;Novolak&quot; but concluded that its properties were inferior. It never became a big market success, but is still used to this day (e. g. as a photoresist).

Baekeland continued to explore possible combinations of phenol and formaldehyde, intrigued by the possibility that such materials could be used in molding. By controlling the pressure and temperature applied to phenol and formaldehyde, he produced his dreamed-of hard moldable plastic: Bakelite. Bakelite was made from phenol, then known as carbolic acid, and formaldehyde. The chemical name of Bakelite is polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride. In compression molding, the resin is generally combined with fillers such as wood or asbestos, before pressing it directly into the final shape of the product. Baekeland&#x27;s process patent for making insoluble products of phenol and formaldehyde was filed in July 1907, and granted on December 7, 1909. In February 1909, Baekeland officially announced his achievement at a meeting of the New York section of the American Chemical Society.

In 1917, Baekeland became a professor by special appointment at Columbia University. 

The Smithsonian has documents from the county courthouse for Westchester County in White Plains, New York, indicating that he was admitted to U. S. Citizenship on December 16, 1919.

In 1922, after patent litigation favorable to Baekeland, the General Bakelite Co., which he had founded in 1910, along with the Condensite Co. founded by Aylesworth, and the Redmanol Chemical Products Company founded by Lawrence V. Redman, were merged into the Bakelite Corporation.

The invention of Bakelite marks the beginning of the age of plastics. Bakelite was the first plastic invented that retained its shape after being heated. Radios, telephones and electrical insulators were made of Bakelite because of its excellent electrical insulation and heat-resistance. Soon, its applications spread to most branches of industry.

Baekeland received many awards and honors, both during his lifetime and beyond, including the Perkin Medal in 1916 and the Franklin Medal in 1940. In 1974 he was posthumously inducted into the Plastics Hall of Fame and in 1978 he was likewise inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio.

At the time of Baekeland&#x27;s death in 1944, the world production of Bakelite was ca. 175,000 tons, and it was used in over 15,000 different products. He held more than 100 patents, including processes for the separation of copper and cadmium, and for the impregnation of wood.

==Later life and death==
As Baekeland grew older he became more eccentric. Biographer Carl Kauffman, interviewed on NPR&#x27;s All Things Considered, gave this example: &quot;He would simply walk into the pool with his clothes on, get himself nicely soaking wet, walk out, cool off without ever putting on a swim suit or anything else. As he said, evaporation is a cooling process.&quot; He entered into fierce battles with his son and presumptive heir over salary and other issues. He sold the General Bakelite Company to Union Carbide in 1939 and, at his son&#x27;s prompting, he retired. He became a recluse, attempting to develop an immense tropical garden on his winter estate in Coconut Grove, Florida. He died of a stroke in a sanatorium in Beacon, New York, in 1944. Baekeland is buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

<text>Minnie Julia Riperton Rudolph (November 8, 1947 – July 12, 1979) was an American soul singer and songwriter best known for her 1974 single &quot;Lovin&#x27; You&quot;, her five-octave vocal range, and her use of the whistle register.

Born in 1947, Riperton grew up in Chicago&#x27;s Bronzeville neighborhood on the South Side. As a child, she studied music, drama and dance at Chicago&#x27;s Abraham Lincoln Center. In her teen years, she sang lead vocals for the Chicago-based girl group The Gems. Her early affiliation with the Chicago-based Chess Records afforded her the opportunity to sing backing vocals for various established artists such as Etta James, Fontella Bass, Ramsey Lewis, Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters. While at Chess, Riperton also sang lead for the psychedelic soul band Rotary Connection from 1967 to 1971.

On April 5, 1975, Riperton reached the pinnacle of her career with her No. 1 single &quot;Lovin&#x27; You&quot;. The single was the last release from her 1974 gold album titled &quot;Perfect Angel&quot;. In January 1976, Riperton was diagnosed with breast cancer; in April, she underwent a radical mastectomy. By the time of diagnosis, the cancer had metastasized and she was given about six months to live. Despite the prognosis, she continued recording and touring. She was one of the first celebrities to go public with a breast cancer diagnosis, but she did not disclose that she was terminally ill. In 1977, she became a spokesperson for the American Cancer Society. In 1978, she received the American Cancer Society&#x27;s Courage Award, which was presented to her at the White House by President Jimmy Carter. Riperton died of breast cancer on July 12, 1979, at the age of 31.

==Early life==
Minnie Julia Riperton was born in Chicago, the daughter of Thelma Inez (née Matthews) (1911–2005) and Daniel Webster Riperton (1898–1991), a Pullman porter. The youngest of eight children in a musical family, she embraced the arts early. Although she began with ballet and modern dance, her parents recognized her vocal and musical abilities and encouraged her to pursue music and voice training. At Chicago&#x27;s Abraham Lincoln Center, she received operatic vocal training from Marion Jeffery. She practiced breathing and phrasing, with particular emphasis on diction. Jeffery also trained Riperton to use her full range. While studying under Jeffery, she sang operettas and show tunes, in preparation for a career in opera. Jeffery was so convinced of her pupil&#x27;s abilities that she strongly pushed her to further study the classics at Chicago&#x27;s Junior Lyric Opera. The young Riperton was, however, becoming interested in soul, rhythm and blues, and rock. After graduating from Hyde Park High School (now Hyde Park Academy High School), she enrolled at Loop College, now named Harold Washington College, and became a member of Zeta Phi Beta sorority. She dropped out of college to pursue her music career.

==Career==
===Early career===
Riperton&#x27;s first professional singing engagement was with The Gems, when she was 15. Raynard Miner, a blind pianist, heard her singing during her stint with Hyde Park&#x27;s A Cappella Choir and became her musical patron. The Gems had relatively limited commercial success, but proved to be a good outlet for Riperton&#x27;s talent. Eventually the group became a session group known as Studio Three and it was during this period that they provided the backing vocals on the classic 1965 Fontella Bass hit &quot;Rescue Me&quot;. In 1964, The Gems released a local hit, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help Myself&quot;, and their last single, &quot;He Makes Me Feel So Good&quot;, was released in 1965. The Gems later released records under numerous names—most notably 1966&#x27;s &quot;Baby I Want You&quot; by the Girls Three and 1967&#x27;s &quot;My Baby&#x27;s Real&quot; by the Starlets. The latter has achieved cult status with northern soul fans and remains a favorite. It was a Motown-style song reminiscent of Tammi Terrell. In 1968, &quot;Watered Down&quot; was released as a follow-up, under the name The Starlets. It was the last release of Riperton&#x27;s former girl group. While a part of Studio Three, Riperton met her mentor, producer Billy Davis, who wrote her first local hit, &quot;Lonely Girl&quot;, as well as its B-side, &quot;You Gave Me Soul&quot;. In honor of Davis, she used the pseudonym Andrea Davis for the release of those two singles.

===Rotary Connection===

In 1966, some months after her Andrea Davis singles hit the radio, Riperton joined Rotary Connection, a funky rock-soul group creation of Marshall Chess, the son of Chess Records founder Leonard Chess. Rotary Connection consisted of Riperton, Chess, Judy Hauff, Sidney Barnes, and Charles Stepney. They released their debut album &quot;Rotary Connection&quot; in 1968 and, subsequently, five more albums: 1968&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin&quot; and Christmas album &quot;Peace&quot;, &quot;Songs&quot; (1969), &quot;Dinner Music&quot; (1970), and &quot;Hey Love&quot; (1971).

In 1969 Riperton, along with Rotary Connection, played in the first Catholic Rock Mass at the Liturgical Conference National Convention, Milwaukee Arena, Milwaukee, WI, produced by James F. Colaianni.

===&quot;Come to My Garden&quot;===
Riperton&#x27;s debut solo album entitled &quot;Come to My Garden&quot; was produced, arranged, as well as orchestrated by her Rotary Connection band mate Charles Stepney and released in 1970 by GRT Records. Several of the songs were co-written by Stepney and Richard Rudolph, who married Riperton in August 1970. She was presented as a solo artist by Ramsey Lewis on Saturday, December 26, 1970, at Chicago&#x27;s famed London House. Riperton went on to perform several numbers from the album while accompanied by Stepney. Although the record was not commercially successful at the time of its release, &quot;Come to My Garden&quot; is now acclaimed by music critics.

===&quot;Perfect Angel&quot; and &quot;Lovin&#x27; You&quot;===

In 1973, a college intern for Epic Records found Riperton in semi-retirement. She had become a homemaker and a mother of two in Gainesville, Florida. After he heard a demo of the song &quot;Seeing You This Way&quot;, the rep took the tape to Don Ellis, VP of A&amp;R for Epic. Riperton signed with Epic Records, and the family moved to Los Angeles, California. The subsequent record, &quot;Perfect Angel&quot;, became one of Riperton&#x27;s best-selling albums. Included were the rock-soul anthem &quot;Reasons&quot;; the second single, &quot;Take a Little Trip&quot; (written by Stevie Wonder, who also coproduced the album); and the third single, &quot;Seeing You This Way&quot;.
Sales of the album started out slow. Epic was ready to move on to the next record, but Rudolph convinced them to release another single. With the fourth single, &quot;Lovin&#x27; You&quot;, the album caught on, and in April 1975, the song went to the top of the charts in the U.S. and 24 other countries. The song reached no. 2 in the UK Singles Chart, and number three on the U.S. R&amp;B charts. It sold more than one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA in April 1975. &quot;Perfect Angel&quot; went gold and Riperton was finally revered as the &quot;lady with the high voice and flowers in her hair.&quot; The album also featured the song &quot;Every Time He Comes Around&quot;, with Deniece Williams singing the background vocals.

===Later career===
After &quot;Perfect Angel&quot;, Riperton and her husband, songwriter and music producer Richard Rudolph started on Riperton&#x27;s third album, &quot;Adventures in Paradise&quot; (1975). Joe Sample of The Crusaders cowrote the title song, &quot;Adventures in Paradise&quot;, and Crusaders producer Stewart Levine co-produced the album. While shooting a promotional clip for the album, she was attacked by a lion, but was not seriously injured. During an appearance on &quot;The Sammy Davis Jr. Show&quot;, she played the footage of the incident for Sammy and her fellow guests, including Richard Pryor. The album was a modest success. Despite the R&amp;B hit &quot;Inside My Love&quot; (a no. 5 U.S. R&amp;B hit, later covered by Trina Broussard, Chanté Moore, and Delilah), the album did not match the success of &quot;Perfect Angel&quot;. Some radio stations refused to play &quot;Inside My Love&quot; due to the lyrics: &quot;Will you come inside me?&quot;

Her fourth album for Epic Records, titled &quot;Stay in Love&quot; (1977), featured another collaboration with Stevie Wonder in the funky disco tune &quot;Stick Together&quot;.

In 1978, Richard Rudolph and Riperton&#x27;s attorney Mike Rosenfeld orchestrated a move to Capitol Records for Riperton and her CBS Records catalog. In April 1979, Riperton released her fifth and final album, &quot;Minnie&quot;. &quot;Memory Lane&quot; was a hit from the album.

===Collaborations===
Riperton provided backing vocals on Stevie Wonder&#x27;s songs &quot;Creepin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;It Ain&#x27;t No Use&quot; from 1974&#x27;s &quot;Fulfillingness&#x27; First Finale&quot; and &quot;Ordinary Pain&quot; from 1976&#x27;s &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;. In 1977, she lent her vocal abilities to a track named &quot;Yesterday and Karma&quot; on Osamu Kitajima&#x27;s album, &quot;Osamu&quot;.

==Personal life==
Riperton was married to songwriter and music producer Richard Rudolph from August 1970 until her death in July 1979. Together, Riperton and Rudolph had two children: music engineer Marc Rudolph (born 1968) and actress and comedian Maya Rudolph (born 1972), a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast member from 2000 to 2007. Maya was a toddler when &quot;Lovin&#x27; You&quot; was recorded. According to the liner notes from Riperton&#x27;s &quot;Petals&quot; compilation CD, the melody to &quot;Lovin&#x27; You&quot; was created as a distraction for Maya when she was a baby so that Riperton and Richard Rudolph could spend time together. Near the end of the unedited &quot;Lovin&#x27; You&quot;, Riperton sings &quot;Maya, Maya, Maya&quot;.

==Illness and death==

On August 24, 1976, Riperton revealed on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; that she had undergone a mastectomy due to breast cancer. At the time of her diagnosis, Riperton found out her cancer had already spread to the lymphatic system, and she was given about six months to live. She continued touring in 1977 and 1978, and she became the national spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society&#x27;s 1978–1979 campaign. During the recording of her final non-posthumous album, &quot;Minnie&quot;, her cancer progressed to the point that she was in a great deal of pain. Extreme lymphedema immobilized her right arm in early 1979. In her final singing appearances on television (most notably on the &quot;Mike Douglas Show&quot;), her right arm remained in a fixed position during her performances. Near her death, in concert, she changed the end of &quot;Lovin&#x27; You&quot;, &quot;Maya, Maya, Maya&quot; to &quot;Maya, Maya, Ringo, Maya.&quot; Ringo was her nickname for her son, Marc. By mid-June, Riperton was confined to bed. She entered Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on July 10. 

On Thursday, July 12, 1979, at 10:00 am, she died in the arms of her husband. That Sunday, following a funeral service attended by more than five hundred mourners, Riperton was interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. Her epitaph is the opening line of her most famous song: &quot;Lovin&#x27; you is easy &#x27;cause you&#x27;re beautiful&quot;. Stevie Wonder paid tribute to Riperton during an episode of the TV show &quot;Soul Train&quot;, which aired shortly after her death in September 1979. On June 7, 2009, TV One (US TV network&#x27;s) &quot;Unsung&quot; series premièred a one-hour documentary on Riperton&#x27;s career and life. It included her husband Richard, son Marc, daughter Maya, sister Sandra Riperton, and many others who worked with her.

==Posthumous releases==
After Riperton died, several artists contributed vocals to tracks she had recorded before her death, to help compile Richard Rudolph&#x27;s final tribute to his wife, &quot;Love Lives Forever&quot;. Included, among others, were Peabo Bryson, Michael Jackson, and Stevie Wonder. Riperton&#x27;s last single, &quot;Give Me Time&quot;, was released in 1980. Richard Rudolph wrote the song, &quot;Now That I Have You&quot; for her, but she never got the chance to record it; he gave the song to Teena Marie, who recorded it (and co-produced it with Rudolph) on Marie&#x27;s second LP, &quot;Lady T&quot;. Finally, in 1981, Capitol Records released &quot;The Best of Minnie Riperton&quot;, a greatest hits collection. The &quot;new&quot; song on the album was a remake of Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;A Woman of Heart and Mind&quot;, which was a holdover from the &quot;Minnie&quot; sessions. Also included were an alternate mix of &quot;Memory Lane&quot;; live versions of &quot;Can You Feel What I&#x27;m Saying&quot;, &quot;Lover And Friend&quot;, and &quot;Young, Willing, and Able&quot;; and two &quot;Moments with Minnie&quot;. It also included the hits &quot;Perfect Angel&quot;, &quot;Lovin&#x27; You&quot;, &quot;Inside My Love&quot;, &quot;Adventures In Paradise&quot;, and two tracks from &quot;Love Lives Forever&quot;: the single &quot;Here We Go&quot; (a duet with Peabo Bryson), and the song &quot;You Take My Breath Away&quot;. During the 1990s, Riperton&#x27;s music was sampled by rap and hip-hop artists including Tupac Shakur, Dr. Dre, A Tribe Called Quest, Blumentopf, the Orb and Tragedy Khadafi.

==Vocal ability==
Riperton&#x27;s official &quot;press bio&quot; reported that she had a coloratura soprano vocal range. Aside from her various hits, she is also remembered for her ability to sing in high head voice (occasionally the whistle register which is often mistakenly confused with the former), in which she had rare facility. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Riperton at number 65 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

Mariah Carey cited Riperton as one of her musical influences.

<text>A mortgage is a legal instrument of the common law which is used to create a security interest in real property held by a lender as a security for a debt, usually a mortgage loan. Hypothec is the corresponding term in civil law jurisdictions, albeit with a wider sense, as it also covers non-possessory lien.

A mortgage in itself is not a debt, it is the lender&#x27;s security for a debt. It is a transfer of an interest in land (or the equivalent) from the owner to the mortgage lender, on the condition that this interest will be returned to the owner when the terms of the mortgage have been satisfied or performed. In other words, the mortgage is a security for the loan that the lender makes to the borrower.

The word is a Law French term meaning &quot;dead pledge,&quot; originally only referring to the Welsh mortgage (&quot;see below&quot;), but in the later Middle Ages was applied to all gages and reinterpreted by folk etymology to mean that the pledge ends (dies) either when the obligation is fulfilled or the property is taken through foreclosure.

In most jurisdictions mortgages are strongly associated with loans secured on real estate rather than on other property (such as ships) and in some jurisdictions only land may be mortgaged. A mortgage is the standard method by which individuals and businesses can purchase real estate without the need to pay the full value immediately from their own resources. See mortgage loan for residential mortgage lending, and commercial mortgage for lending against commercial property.

==Participants and variant terminology==
Legal systems in different countries, while having some concepts in common, employ different terminology. However, in general, a mortgage of property involves the following parties. The borrower, known as the mortgagor, gives the mortgage to the lender, known as the mortgagee.

===Lender/mortgagee===
A mortgage lender is an investor that lends money secured by a mortgage on real estate. In today&#x27;s world, most lenders sell the loans they write on the secondary mortgage market. When they sell the mortgage, they earn revenue called Service Release Premium. Typically, the purpose of the loan is for the borrower to purchase that same real estate. As the mortgagee, the lender has the right to sell the property to pay off the loan if the borrower fails to pay.

The mortgage runs with the land, so even if the borrower transfers the property to someone else, the mortgagee still has the right to sell it if the borrower fails to pay off the loan.

So that a buyer cannot unwittingly buy property subject to a mortgage, mortgages are registered or recorded against the title with a government office, as a public record. The borrower has the right to have the mortgage discharged from the title once the debt is paid.

===Borrower/mortgagor===
A mortgagor is the borrower in a mortgage—he or she owes the obligation secured by the mortgage. Generally, the borrower must meet the conditions of the underlying loan or other obligation in order to redeem the mortgage. If the borrower fails to meet these conditions, the mortgagee may foreclose to recover the outstanding loan. Typically the borrowers will be the individual homeowners, landlords, or businesses who are purchasing their property by way of a loan.

===Other participants===
Because of the complicated legal exchange, or conveyance, of the property, one or both of the main participants are likely to require legal representation. The agent used for conveyancing varies based on the jurisdiction. In the English-speaking world this means either a general legal practitioner, i.e., an attorney or solicitor, or in jurisdictions influenced by English law, including South Africa, a (licensed) conveyancer. In the United States, real estate agents are the most common. In civil law jurisdictions conveyancing is handled by civil law notaries.

Because of the complex nature of many markets the borrower may approach a mortgage broker or financial adviser to help him or her source an appropriate lender, typically by finding the most competitive loan.

The debt instrument is, in civil law jurisdictions, referred to by some form of Latin &quot;hypotheca&quot; (e.g., Sp &quot;hipoteca&quot;, Fr &quot;hypothèque&quot;, Germ &quot;Hypothek&quot;), and the parties are known as hypothecator (borrower) and hypothecatee (lender). A civil-law hypotheca is exactly equivalent to an English mortgage by legal charge or American lien-theory mortgage.

==History==

===Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman law===
In Anglo-Saxon England, when interest loans were illegal, the main method of securing realty was by wadset (ME &quot;wedset&quot;). A wadset was a loan masked as a sale of land under right of reversion. The borrower (reverser) conveyed by charter a fee simple estate, in consideration of a loan, to the lender (wadsetter) who on redemption would reconvey the estate to the reverser by a second charter. The difficulty with this arrangement was that the wadsetter was absolute owner of the property and could sell it to a third party or refuse to reconvey it to the reverser, who was also stripped of his principal means of repayment and therefore in a weak position. In later years the practice—especially in Scotland and on the continent—was to execute together the wadset and a separate back-bond according the reverser an &quot;in personam&quot; right of reverter.

An alternative practice imported from Norman law was the usufructory pledge of real property known as a gage of land. Under a gage the borrower (gagor) conveyed possession but not ownership to the lender (gagee) for an unlimited term until redemption. The gage came in two forms:
*the &quot;living gage&quot; (Norman &quot;vif gage&quot;, Welsh &quot;prid&quot;), whereby the estate&#x27;s accruing rents, profits, and crops went toward reducing the debt (that is, the debt was self-redeeming);
*the &quot;dead gage&quot; (Norman &quot;mort gage&quot;, Scots &quot;deid wad&quot;), whereby the rents and profits were taken in lieu of interest but did not reduce the debt.
The gage was unattractive for lenders because the gagor could easily eject the gagee using novel disseisin, and the gagee—merely seized &quot;ut de vadio&quot; “as of gage”—could not bring a freeholder&#x27;s remedies to recover possession. Thus, the unprofitable living gage fell out of use, but the dead gage continued as the Welsh mortgage until abolished in 1922.

===Late Middle Ages===
By the 13th century—in England and on the continent—the gage was limited to a term of years and contained a forfeiture proviso (&quot;pactum commissorium&quot;) providing that if after the term the debt was not repaid, title was forfeited to the lender, i.e., the term of years would expand automatically into a fee simple. This is known as a shifting fee and was sufficient after 1199 to entitle the gagee to bring an action for recovery. However, the royal courts increasingly did not respect shifting fees since there was no livery of seisin (i.e., no formal conveyance), nor did they recognize that tenure could be enlarged, so by the 14th century the simple gage for years was invalid in England (and Scotland and the near continent).

The solution was to merge the latter-day wadset and gage for years into a single transaction embodied in two instruments: (1) the absolute conveyance (the &quot;charter&quot;) in fee or for years to the lender; (2) an indenture or bond (the &quot;defeasance&quot;) reciting the loan and providing that if it was repaid the land would reinvest in the borrower, but if not the lender would retain title. If repaid on time, the lender would reinvest title using a reconveyance deed. This was the mortgage by conveyance (aka &quot;mortgage in fee&quot;) or, when written, the mortgage by charter and reconveyance and took the form of a feoffment, bargain and sale, or lease and release. Since the lender did not necessarily enter into possession, had rights of action, and covenanted a right of reversion on the borrower, the mortgage was a proper collateral security. Thus, a mortgage was on its face an absolute conveyance of a fee simple estate, but was in fact conditional, and would be of no effect if certain conditions were met.

The debt was absolute in form, and unlike a gage was not conditionally dependent on its repayment solely from raising and selling crops or livestock or simply giving the crops and livestock raised on the gaged land. The mortgage debt remained in effect whether or not the land could successfully produce enough income to repay the debt. In theory, a mortgage required no further steps to be taken by the lender, such as acceptance of crops and livestock in repayment.

===Renaissance and after===
However, if the borrower was a single day late in repaying the debt, he forfeited his land to the lender while still remaining liable for the debt. Increasingly the courts of equity began to protect the borrower&#x27;s interests, so that a borrower came to have under Sir Francis Bacon (1617–21) an absolute right to insist on reconveyance on redemption even if past due. This right of the borrower is known as the equity of redemption.

This arrangement, whereby the lender was in theory the absolute owner, but in practice had few of the practical rights of ownership, was seen in many jurisdictions as being awkwardly artificial. By statute the common law&#x27;s position was altered so that the mortgagor (borrower) would retain ownership, but the mortgagee&#x27;s (lender&#x27;s) rights, such as foreclosure, the power of sale, and the right to take possession, would be protected. In the United States, those states that have reformed the nature of mortgages in this way are known as lien states. A similar effect was achieved in England and Wales by the &quot;Law of Property Act 1925&quot;, which abolished mortgages by the conveyance of a fee simple.

Since the 17th century, lenders have not been allowed to carry interest in the property beyond the underlying debt under the equity of redemption principle. Attempts by the lender to carry an equity interest in the property in a manner similar to convertible bonds through contract have been therefore struck down by courts as &quot;clogs&quot;, but developments in the 1980s and 1990s have led to less rigid enforcement of this principle, particularly due to interest among theorists in returning to a freedom of contract regime.

=== Mortgage Law and Colonization Practices ===
Mortgage and foreclosure were used as a means by the Dutch and other colonists to acquire land from native peoples in North America. This was a successful endeavor partially due to cultural differences in the understanding of land ownership. The practice followed a series of steps. Colonists would draw native peoples into their debts through credit that the natives would then need to create mortgages to repay. The debt would generally be one that the natives would be unable to pay in a reasonable time frame and thus foreclosure would be enforced, and the land acquired by the colonists. 

==Default on divided property==
When a tract of land is purchased with a mortgage and then split up and sold, the &quot;inverse order of alienation rule&quot; applies to decide parties liable for the unpaid debt.

When a mortgaged tract of land is split up and sold, upon default, the mortgagee first forecloses on lands still owned by the mortgagor and proceeds against other owners in an &#x27;inverse order&#x27; in which they were sold. For example, Alice acquires a lot by mortgage then splits up the lot into three lots (X, Y, and Z), and sells lot Y to Bob, and then lot Z to Charlie, retaining lot X for herself. Upon default, the mortgagee proceeds against lot X first, the mortgagor. If foreclosure or repossession of lot X does not fully satisfy the debt, the mortgagee proceeds against lot Z (Charlie), then lot Y (Bob). The rationale is that the first purchaser should have more equity and subsequent purchasers receive a diluted share.

==Legal aspects==
Mortgages may be legal or equitable. Furthermore, a mortgage may take one of a number of different legal structures, the availability of which will depend on the jurisdiction under which the mortgage is made. Common law jurisdictions have evolved two main forms of mortgage: the mortgage by demise and the mortgage by legal charge.

===Mortgage by demise===
In a mortgage by demise, the mortgagee (the lender) becomes the owner of the mortgaged property until the loan is repaid or other mortgage obligation fulfilled in full, a process known as &quot;redemption&quot;. This kind of mortgage takes the form of a conveyance of the property to the creditor, with a condition that the property will be returned on redemption.

Mortgages by demise were the original form of mortgage, and continue to be used in many jurisdictions, and in a small minority of states in the United States. Many other common law jurisdictions have either abolished or minimised the use of the mortgage by demise. For example, in England and Wales this type of mortgage is no longer available in relation to registered interests in land, by virtue of section 23 of the Land Registration Act 2002 (though it continues to be available for unregistered interests).

===Mortgage by legal charge===
In a mortgage by legal charge or technically &quot;a charge by deed expressed to be by way of legal mortgage&quot;, the debtor remains the legal owner of the property, but the creditor gains sufficient rights over it to enable them to enforce their security, such as a right to take possession of the property or sell it.

To protect the lender, a mortgage by legal charge is usually recorded in a public register. Since mortgage debt is often the largest debt owed by the debtor, banks and other mortgage lenders run title searches of the real estate property to make certain that there are no mortgages already registered on the debtor&#x27;s property which might have higher priority. Tax liens, in some cases, will come ahead of mortgages. For this reason, if a borrower has delinquent property taxes, the bank will often pay them to prevent the lienholder from foreclosing and wiping out the mortgage.

This type of mortgage is most common in the United States and, since the Law of Property Act 1925, it has been the usual form of mortgage in England and Wales (it is now the only form for registered interests in landsee above).

In Scotland, the mortgage by legal charge is also known as Standard Security.

In Pakistan, the mortgage by legal charge is most common way used by banks to secure the financing. It is also known as registered mortgage. After registration of legal charge, the bank&#x27;s lien is recorded in the land register stating that the property is under mortgage and cannot be sold without obtaining an NOC (No Objection Certificate) from the bank.

===Equitable mortgage===
Equitable mortgages originate in English Common Law and may lack some legal formalities.

In an equitable mortgage the lender is secured by taking possession of all the original title documents of the property and by borrower&#x27;s signing a Memorandum of Deposit of Title Deed (MODTD). This document is an undertaking by the borrower that he/she has deposited the title documents with the bank with his own wish and will, in order to secure the financing obtained from the bank.
Certain transactions are recognized therefore as mortgages by equity, which are not so recognized by common law.

==Foreclosure and non-recourse lending==

In most jurisdictions, a lender may foreclose on the mortgaged property if certain conditions—principally, non-payment of the mortgage loanapply. A foreclosure will be either judicial or extrajudicial (non-judicial), depending upon whether the jurisdiction within which the property to be foreclosed interprets mortgages according to title theory or lien theory, and further depending upon the type of security instrument used to secure the loan. Subject to local legal requirements, the property may then be sold. Any amounts received from the sale (net of costs) are applied to the original debt.

In some jurisdictions mainly in the United States, mortgage loans are non-recourse loans: if the funds recouped from sale of the mortgaged property are insufficient to cover the outstanding debt, the lender may not have recourse to the borrower after foreclosure. In other jurisdictions, the borrower remains responsible for any remaining debt, through a deficiency judgment. In some jurisdictions, first mortgages are non-recourse loans, but second and subsequent ones are recourse loans.

Specific procedures for foreclosure and sale of the mortgaged property almost always apply, and may be tightly regulated by the relevant government. In some jurisdictions, foreclosure and sale can occur quite rapidly, while in others, foreclosure may take many months or even years. In many countries, the ability of lenders to foreclose is extremely limited, and mortgage market development has been notably slower. The relatively slow, expensive and cumbersome process of judicial foreclosure is a primary motivation for the use of deeds of trust, because of their provisions for non-judicial foreclosures by trustees through &quot;power of sale&quot; clauses.

==Mortgages in the United States==

===Three theories of mortgages===
There are three legal theories pertaining to mortgages: title theory, lien theory, and intermediate theory. These three theories pertain particularly to the operation of mortgages, and so provide the key to understanding the differences which exist in the operation of mortgages across jurisdictions.

====Title theory====
Title theory is &quot;the idea that a mortgage transfers legal title of the mortgaged property from the mortgagor to the mortgagee, which retains it until the mortgage has been satisfied or foreclosed. Only a few American States...have adopted this theory.&quot; Under title theory, a mortgage has the effect of a deed passing legal title, though conditionally, of the mortgaged property to the mortgagee (the lender in a loan agreement being secured by the mortgage), with so-called &quot;equitable title&quot; (which is really equity of redemption) being retained by the mortgagor (the borrower in the loan). The fact of the mortgagor&#x27;s retaining of the &quot;equity of redemption&quot; is the fact which renders the passing of title under title theory conditional. Mortgages within title theory jurisdictions, then, may be viewed as having the action of what might be called &quot;conditional deeds&quot;. Though legal title is passed pursuant to a mortgage therein, the arrangement is generally construed by courts to recognize the mortgagor as &quot;owner&quot; of the mortgaged property within title theory jurisdictions. Even so, foreclosure of the property as a remedy for default under title theory is most often extrajudicial (non-judicial).

====Lien theory====
Lien theory is &quot;the idea that a mortgage resembles a lien, so that...&quot;, pursuant to a mortgage, &quot;...the mortgagee acquires only a lien on the property and the mortgagor retains both legal and equitable title unless a valid foreclosure occurs. Most American states...have adopted this theory.&quot; Sometimes this theory is referred to as the &quot;Equitable Theory of Mortgages&quot;. Under lien theory. a mortgage acts to place a lien on the mortgaged property in favor of the mortgagee, and legal title is retained by the mortgagor. Judicial foreclosure is most often necessary as a remedy to default pursuant to mortgages within lien theory jurisdictions, and this process has been found to be cumbersome, time-consuming and costly. Resultantly, lenders within lien theory jurisdictions most often have recourse to non-mortgage instruments for the securement of loans, which instruments usually take the form of trust deeds or, within the State of Georgia, the security deed. Deeds always act to convey legal title to a parcel of real property, and the ubiquitous usage of such deeds within lien theory jurisdictions has generally served to subvert the action of mortgages therein.

====Intermediate theory====
Under what has come to be called the &quot;intermediate theory&quot; of mortgages, a mortgage is viewed as creating a lien on the mortgaged property until such a time as an event of default occurs pursuant to the loan contract. After such a time, the same mortgage is construed under title theory. This is accomplished by the inclusion of a stipulation within the loan contract to the effect that the borrower is allowed to retain legal title to the collateralized property with the express agreement that the lender may foreclose in a non- or extrajudicial manner if the borrower defaults on the loan.

In the United States, more states are lien-theory states than are title-theory or intermediate-theory states. In title-theory states, a mortgage continues to be a conveyance of legal title to secure a debt, while the mortgagor still retains equitable title. In lien-theory states, mortgages and deeds of trust have been redesigned so that they now impose a nonpossessory lien on the title to the mortgaged property, while the mortgagor still holds both legal and equitable title.

===Types of security interests in realty===
Four types of security over real property are commonly used in the United States: the title mortgage, the lien mortgage, the deed of trust, and particularly within the State of Georgia, the security deed. In the United States, these security instruments proceed off of debt instruments drawn up in the form of promissory notes and which are known variously as mortgage notes, lender&#x27;s notes, or real estate lien notes.

====The mortgage====
A mortgage operates to collateralize real property by means of lien or through conditional conveyance of title, depending upon jurisdiction. A mortgage creates a security interest in realty created by a written instrument (traditionally a deed) that either conveys legal title (according to the &quot;title theory of mortgages&quot;) or hypothecates title by way of a nonpossessory lien (according to the &quot;lien theory of mortgages&quot;) to a lender for the performance under the terms of a mortgage note. In slightly less than half of states, a mortgage creates a lien on the title to the mortgaged property. Foreclosure of that lien almost always requires a judicial proceeding declaring the debt to be due and in default and ordering a sale of the property to pay the debt. Many mortgages contain a power of sale clause, also known as nonjudicial foreclosure clause, making them equivalent to a deed of trust. Most &quot;mortgages&quot; in California are actually deeds of trust. The effective difference is that the foreclosure process can be much faster for a deed of trust than for a mortgage, on the order of 3 months rather than a year. Because this foreclosure does not require actions by the court, the transaction costs can be quite a bit less.

====The deed of trust====
The deed of trust is a conveyance of title made by the borrower to a third party trustee (not the lender) for the purposes of securing a debt. In lien-theory states, it is reinterpreted as merely imposing a lien on the title and not a title transfer, regardless of its terms. It differs from a mortgage in that, in many states, it can be foreclosed by a nonjudicial sale held by the trustee through a power of sale. It is also possible to foreclose them through a judicial proceeding.

Deeds of trust to secure repayments of debts should not be confused with trust instruments that are sometimes called deeds of trust but that are used to create trusts for other purposes, such as estate planning. Though there are superficial similarities in the form, many states hold deeds of trust to secure repayment of debts do not create true trust arrangements.

====The security deed: specialty of Georgia====
Georgia is often stated to be a title theory state, but such is not the case. Note O.C.G.A. §44-14-30, which states clearly that &quot;A mortgage in this state is only security for a debt and passes no title.&quot; Also note O.C.G.A. §44-14-31, which states that &quot;No particular form is necessary to constitute a mortgage. However, a mortgage must clearly indicate the creation of a lien and must specify the debt for which it is given and the property upon which it is to take effect.&quot; It is clear, then, that mortgages are construed within the Official Georgia Code and by the Courts of the State of Georgia as placing a lien upon a mortgaged property in favor of the mortgagee, while the mortgagor retains both legal and equitable title to that property. It is equally clear, then, that Georgia is, by virtue of the foregoing facts, a lien theory state. Even so, the Georgia Legislature has formally provided for a lender being able to secure its loan by means of having legal title to a collateralized property conveyed to it.

The so-called &quot;Deed to Secure Debt&quot; is a security instrument used in the state of Georgia to accomplish securing of a debt by means of the passing of legal title to real property. Though it is characterized within the Official Code of Georgia (the &quot;O.C.G.A.&quot;) to be an &quot;absolute conveyance&quot; of title, it is, in fact, not, for the grantor of the deed in this scheme does retain the &quot;equity of redemption&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;equitable title&quot;. The nature of the Georgia &quot;Deed to Secure Debt&quot; is set forth in O.C.G.A. §44-14-60, within which (somewhat oxymoronically) it is stated that: &quot;Such conveyance shall be held by the courts to be an absolute conveyance...&quot; (assumedly meaning an actual conveyance of &quot;absolute&quot; or &quot;perfect&quot; title to the grantee) &quot;...with the right reserved by the grantor to have the property reconveyed to him upon the payment of the debt or debts intended to be secured agreeably to the terms of the contract...&quot; (in other words, the grantor retains &quot;equitable title&quot;, a.k.a. the equity of redemption, which appears to contradict the preceding phrase within the same sentence) &quot;...and shall not be held to be a mortgage.&quot; (which is true, but only within a &quot;lien theory&quot; jurisdiction). Despite the assertion within the O.C.G.A. of &quot;absolute conveyance&quot;, the fact that the grantor of a security deed retains equitable title to the deeded property, means that the conveyance of title effected by said security deed is, in fact, not absolute, but is conditional, and the security deed effectively functions as a mortgage construed under title theory.

Upon the execution of such a deed, &quot;legal title&quot; passes to the grantee or beneficiary (usually lender), while the grantor (borrower) maintains &quot;equitable title&quot; to use and enjoy the conveyed land subject to compliance with debt obligations. In this, the security deed in Georgia operates no differently than does a mortgage within &quot;title theory&quot; jurisdictions. Hypothetically, if &quot;absolute&quot; or &quot;perfect&quot; title were held by a grantee such that the grantor did not retain the equity of redemption, then the grantee/lender would theoretically not have need to foreclose upon the grantor/borrower, but rather might cure a default by simple means of eviction or &quot;summary reposession&quot;. However, foreclosure, albeit extrajudicial, is found to be necessary in Georgia to cure a default. Because of the apparently self-contradictory nature of the Georgia statute, the Courts within Georgia have construed the operation of security deeds to mean that the grantor retains the equity of redemption, such that non- or extrajudicial foreclosure is necessary as a remedy for default on a loan.

In order to be effectual, security deeds must be recorded in the county of Georgia within which the land is located. Although there is no specific time within which such deeds must be filed, the failure to timely record the deed to secure debt may affect priority and therefore the ability to enforce the debt against the subject property.

====Priority====
The lien is said to attach to the title when the mortgage is signed by the mortgagor and delivered to the mortgagee and the mortgagor receives the funds whose repayment the mortgage secures. Subject to the requirements of the recording laws of the state in which the mortgaged property is located, this attachment establishes the priority of the mortgage lien with respect to most other liens on the property&#x27;s title. Liens that have attached to the title before the mortgage lien are said to be senior to, or prior to, the mortgage lien. Those attaching afterward are said to be junior or subordinate. The purpose of this priority is to establish the order in which lienholders are entitled to foreclose their liens in order to recover their debts. If a property&#x27;s title has multiple mortgage liens and the loan secured by a first mortgage is paid off, the second mortgage lien will move up in priority and become the new first mortgage lien on the title. Documenting this new priority arrangement will require the release of the mortgage securing the paid-off loan.

==Assignment==
Mortgages, along with the Mortgage note, may be assigned to other parties. Some jurisdictions hold that the assignment of the note implies the assignment of the mortgage, while others contend it only creates an equitable right.

<text>Abraham Pineo Gesner, ONB (; May 2, 1797 – April 29, 1864) was a Nova Scotian and New Brunswickan physician and geologist who invented kerosene. Gesner was born in Cornwallis, Nova Scotia (now called Chipmans Corner) and lived much of his life in Saint John, New Brunswick. He died in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was an influential figure in the development of the study of Canadian geology and natural history.

==Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Abraham Pineo Gesner was born on May 2, 1797, in Cornwallis, King&#x27;s County, Nova Scotia. He was one of 12 children raised by Henry Gesner and Sarah Pineo, His father was a Loyalist, who emigrated to Nova Scotia after the American Revolution. Gesner was noted to be a great reader and a diligent student.

In his early twenties, Gesner began a venture selling horses to plantations in the Caribbean and the United States, but this enterprise failed after he lost most of his horses in two shipwrecks. Financially drained, Gesner returned to the family farm and married Harriet Webster, daughter of prominent Kentville doctor Isaac Webster in 1824. Reportedly, Webster offered to take care of Gesner&#x27;s debts if he would study medicine and secure a steady income for his family. In 1825, Gesner travelled to London to study medicine at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital under Sir Astley Paston Cooper, and surgery at Guy&#x27;s Hospital under John Abernethy. While primarily a medical student, Gesner developed an interest in the earth sciences and took lectures in mineralogy and geology. Gesner also established a lifelong relationship with Charles Lyell.

===Early career===
Gesner qualified as a doctor of medicine and settled in Parrsboro, Nova Scotia in 1827 as a travelling physician. Gesner also continued to pursue his passion for geology, reading the writings of notable geologists and developing a habit of picking up mineral specimens that caught his attention while making his rounds on horseback. In 1836, Gesner published his first book, &quot;Remarks on the Geology and Mineralogy of Nova Scotia.&quot; The book expanded on an earlier geological study by Charles T. Jackson and displayed Gesner&#x27;s ability to express complicated concepts in simple language. Following the publication of &quot;Remarks on the Geology and Mineralogy of Nova Scotia,&quot; Gesner focused his efforts on studying geology and the sciences connected to it.

In 1838, the government of New Brunswick appointed Gesner Provincial Geologist, and he moved to Saint John to conduct a geological survey of the province. For five years, Gesner spent his summers on geological fieldwork and his winters classifying specimens and writing reports. Although Gesner&#x27;s geological studies were of high quality by the standards of the 1840s, he had no experience in mining and failed to make a realistic appraisal of the province&#x27;s mineral reserves. Following the publication of Gesner&#x27;s geological surveys, local entrepreneurs opened coal and iron mines in Queens County and were quickly disappointed by the extent and quality of the ore. Unhappy investors questioned the validity of Gesner&#x27;s surveys and the provincial government terminated his employment in 1843.

During the first summer of his geological surveys, Gesner found a bituminous substance on the Petitcodiac River in Albert County, which he named albertite to differentiate it from coal or asphalt.

While in St. John, Gesner amassed an extensive collection of minerals and wildlife specimens, which he assembled into a museum in 1842. Gesner&#x27;s museum was one of its first of its kind in British North America and had 2173 items in its catalogue. The museum was a financial failure, and when Gesner left New Brunswick, the Saint John Mechanics’ Institute acquired the objects. In 1890, the Natural History Society of New Brunswick took over the collection, which is today a part of the New Brunswick Museum.

Following the termination of his geological appointment in 1843, Gesner returned to his family homestead at Cornwallis, Nova Scotia, in order to be with his father who was then 87 years old. While working on the family farm, Gesner also continued to practice medicine, write books, give public lectures and conduct experiments. He published notes for emigrants to New Brunswick, outlined the industrial resources of Nova Scotia, and built an electrical motor driven by a voltaic battery. In 1846, the government of Nova Scotia appointed Gesner Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and the following year he submitted a report on the living conditions of the Miꞌkmaq population. While visiting Mi&#x27;kmaq habitations across the province for his report, Gesner was known to donate his own money to assist impoverished families.

In 1842, looking for coal, Gesner travelled to Quebec, where he discovered the first of the great fossil deposits of the future Miguasha National Park. However, little notice was taken of his report until the fossils were rediscovered in 1879.

===Discovery of kerosene===
Gesner likely began experimenting with hydrocarbons in the 1840s. Utilizing a sample of bitumen from Trinidad&#x27;s Pitch Lake that he collected while shipping horses across the Atlantic, Gesner developed a method of extracting oils and gas from bituminous substances. Gesner found that the first product was not satisfactory as it had an offensive odour, the raw material was expensive to obtain, and his experiments suggested that one ton of Trinidad bitumen would produce only 42 gallons of oil. Switching his experiments from Trinidad&#x27;s bitumen to albertite, Gesner found that the burning oil extracted from the substance produced a brighter and cleaner flame compared to lamps using whale oil or coal oil. While undertaking a series of public lectures in Charlottetown, Gesner reportedly gave the first public demonstration of the preparation and use of the new lamp fuel in August 1846. Gesner first called his product &quot;keroselain&quot; from two Greek words, κηρός (wax) and λάδι (oil), but later contracted the name to kerosene.

Shortly after Gesner&#x27;s father died on October 13, 1850, he moved his family to Sackville, a small town near Halifax, and in 1852 to Halifax. In Halifax, Gesner made the acquaintance of Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald. The pair planned to set up a company that would illuminate Halifax by using albertite from Albert County, New Brunswick, and bitumen from Trinidad&#x27;s pitch lake. However, Cochrane&#x27;s terms of service expired in April 1851, and he returned to England before the pair could bring the project to fruition. Gesner attempted to continue the project on his own, but Halifax&#x27;s city council awarded the gas license to a rival group, the Halifax Gas Company. Moreover, although Gesner attempted to receive a lease to mine bitumen in Albert County, another entrepreneur, William Cairns, had already purchased the rights to mine coal in the area. After Cairns had Gesner&#x27;s men forcibly expelled from the site of the bitumen deposit, Gesner brought suit against Cairns for trespassing. The trial centered on whether the albertite deposit was coal or asphalt. The jury, told by the judge that Cairn&#x27;s license to mine coal included &quot;other mines and minerals,&quot; ultimately sided against Gesner, resulting in albertite&#x27;s misidentification as &quot;Albert Coal&quot; for the next 30 years. In early 1853, following the outcome of the trial, Gesner and his family moved to New York City, where he had earlier exhibited his kerosene and amassed significant publicity.

=== The North American Kerosene Company ===
After arriving in New York, Gesner focused on finding financial backing for his kerosene venture. In March 1853, Gesner partnered with shipbroker Horatio Eagle, who issued an eight-page circular entitled, &quot;Project for the Formation of a Company to Work the Combined Patent Rights of Dr. Abraham Gesner, Nova Scotia, and the Right Hon. the Earl of Dundonald of Middlesex, England.&quot; The pamphlet offered for sale $100,000 in shares of a new company called the Asphalt Mining and Kerosene Company, later renamed the North American Kerosene Company. The pamphlet outlined the numerous uses for kerosene oils and noted that Gesner was the company&#x27;s chief chemist, hired on for a &quot;moderate salary.&quot; On June 27, 1854, Gesner obtained U.S patents 11,203, 11,204, and 11,205 for &quot;Improvement in kerosene burning fluids,&quot; but he transferred patent rights to the North American Kerosene Company. In the patents, Gesner described three distinct types of kerosene, which he labelled kerosenes A, B and C. Kerosene A was the most volatile fraction, known today as gasoline. Kerosene B was slightly less volatile and was intended mainly for mixing with the other grades. Kerosene C was the lamp fuel, which came to be known as &quot;coal-oil&quot; or &quot;carbon-oil.&quot;

Under Gesner&#x27;s guidance, the North American Kerosene Company began constructing a coal oil refinery on a seven-acre tract at Newtown Creek, Long Island, the first of its kind in North America. By 1856, the firm was selling kerosene for use as lamp fuel. According to an article in the &quot;New York Commercial Advertiser&quot; in August 1859, the plant cost $1.25 million to build, employed 200 men, used 30,000 tons of coal per year, and exported 5,000 gallons of kerosene per day. Modern engineers have praised Gesner&#x27;s efficient design of the factory, differing very little from manufactories built as late as 1914. While the enterprise had not made Gesner extremely wealthy, he lived comfortably in Brooklyn, New York, where he was a prominent figure in the local church and community.

By the late 1850s, the North American Kerosene Company began to face increased competition as various coal oil competitors entered the scene. In response to the increased competition, the North American Kerosene Company published a pamphlet on March 28, 1859, that advised customers that kerosene is their registered trademark and that oils made by others can not use the name. One prominent rival manufacturer, Samuel Downer of Boston, Massachusetts, made an agreement in early 1859 to license the name and Gesner&#x27;s refinement process. When James Young, a Scottish chemist, who had independently developed a process of distilling a petroleum fuel into a product he named &quot;paraffin oil,&quot; became aware of the North American Kerosene Company&#x27;s claims, he filed for patent infringement and won. Although Young only began his distillation experiments in 1848, two years after Gesner&#x27;s first public demonstration of Kerosene, he was first to file an American patent for his process in 1852. Thereafter, the North American Kerosene Company had to pay royalties to Young.

Following the discovery of oil in Enniskillen Township and Pennsylvania, the North American Kerosene Company began using petroleum to produce kerosene instead of coal at about one third the cost. Sometime after the trial, the company replaced Gesner with Luther Atwood as chief chemist. The Newton Creek plant eventually passed into the hands of Charles Pratt and Company, a subsidiary of Standard Oil, and continued to operate until May 1951. In 1952, a junk dealer bought the refinery and sold the equipment for scrap.

=== Marriage and children ===
Gesner married Harriet Webster, daughter of prominent Kentville doctor Isaac Webster in 1824. Together, they had seven sons and three daughters, but three children died in infancy. Three of his sons, Brower (1834–1873), John Frederick (1839–1899), and George Weltden (1829–1904), pursued careers in geology and chemistry.

=== Later life and death ===
For a time, Gesner remained in New York, practising medicine and continuing his research into hydrocarbons. In 1861, Gesner published &quot;A Practical Treatise on Coal, Petroleum and Other Distilled Oils&quot;, which was extremely influential in the future development of the petroleum industry and remarkable for the accuracy of his predictions on the future course the refining business would take. Gesner was humble about his contribution to the development of the petroleum industry, writing in &quot;A Practical Treatise on Coal&quot; that &quot;The progress of discovery in this case, as in others, has been slow and gradual. It has been carried on by the labors, not of one mind, but of many, so as to render it difficult to discover to whom the greatest credit is due.&quot;

After the publication of &quot;A Practical Treatise on Coal,&quot; Gesner became a distillation consultant, visiting the oil fields in Enniskillen Township sometime around 1860. Gesner might have helped James Miller Williams in the development of his petroleum refinery in Hamilton in 1861.

In 1863, Gesner returned to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he was offered the chair of Natural History at Dalhousie University, but he died on April 29, 1864, before he could take up the position. Gesner was buried in an unmarked grave at Halifax&#x27;s Camp Hill Cemetery.

==Legacy==
In 1933, Imperial Oil Ltd., then a Standard Oil subsidiary, erected a memorial at Gesner&#x27;s grave in Camp Hill Cemetery to pay tribute to his contribution to the petroleum industry. The monument reads &quot;His treatise on the geology and mineralogy of Nova Scotia, 1836, was one of the earliest works dealing with those subjects in this province and about 1852 he was the American inventor of the process of kerosene oil. Erected by Imperial Oil Ltd. as a token of appreciation and for his important contribution to the oil industry.&quot;

In 2007, Gesner was inducted into the Canadian Petroleum Hall of Fame for his contributions to the petroleum industry.

The City of Halifax renamed a street at the west end of Fairview between Melrose and Adelaide in honor of Gesner. Formerly a part of Dunbrack Street, the construction of the Dunbrack Street/North West Arm Drive connector during the 1980s prompted the renaming of this segment.

There is a street named for Gesner in the west part of Ottawa&#x27;s Katimavik-Hazeldean neighbourhood, where the residential streets are named for Canadian inventors. Whether by plan or by coincidence, it dead-ends at an Esso (Imperial Oil) gas station.

In 2000, he was honored by the placement of his image on a postage stamp by Canada Post. In 2016, Gesner was posthumously inducted to the Order of New Brunswick by the province of his longtime residence.

Starting in 1998, the Fundy Geological Museum in Parrsboro Nova Scotia, a former residence of Gesner, has awarded an &quot;Abraham Gesner Work Scholarship&quot; to a local student who shows keen interest in the sciences.

<text>Dancer in the Dark is a 2000 musical psychological tragedy film written and directed by Lars von Trier. It stars Icelandic musician Björk as a factory worker who suffers from a degenerative eye condition and is saving for an operation to prevent her young son from suffering the same fate. Catherine Deneuve, David Morse, Cara Seymour, Peter Stormare, Siobhan Fallon Hogan and Joel Grey also star. The soundtrack for the film, &quot;Selmasongs&quot;, was written mainly by Björk, but a number of songs featured contributions from Mark Bell and some of the lyrics were written by von Trier and Sjón.

&quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; is the third and final installment in von Trier&#x27;s second trilogy &quot;Golden Heart&quot;, following &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Idiots&quot; (1998). It was an international co-production among companies based in thirteen European and North American countries and regions. Like the first installment, it was shot with a handheld camera inspired by Dogme 95.

&quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival and won the Palme d&#x27;Or, along with the Best Actress Award for Björk. The film received generally positive reviews, with Björk&#x27;s performance being widely praised.

The song &quot;I&#x27;ve Seen It All&quot; performed and co-written by Björk, with Sjón and von Trier, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, but lost to &quot;Things Have Changed&quot; by Bob Dylan from &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;.

==Plot==
In Washington State in 1964, Selma Ježková, a Czech immigrant, has moved to the United States with her 12-year-old son Gene Ježek. They live a life of poverty as Selma works at a factory with her good friend Kathy, whom she nicknames Cvalda. She rents a trailer home on the property of local police officer Bill Houston and his wife, Linda. She is romantically pursued by the shy but persistent Jeff, who also works at the factory.

Selma is gradually losing her vision due to a degenerative eye condition, but still is saving money to pay for an operation that will prevent Gene from sharing her fate. She also takes part in rehearsals for a production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and accompanies Kathy to the local cinema, where together they watch Hollywood musicals, as Kathy describes them to her.

In her day-to-day life, Selma slips into daydreams, imagining herself in a musical (&quot;Cvalda&quot;). Jeff and Kathy begin to realize that Selma&#x27;s vision is worse than they thought, and that she has been memorizing eye charts in order to pass vision tests and keep her job. Bill reveals to Selma that Linda&#x27;s excessive spending has put the couple&#x27;s house in danger of foreclosure by their bank. He has contemplated suicide but cannot bring himself to carry out the act. Selma promises to keep his secret and confides in him about her advancing vision loss. Bill quietly stays without knowing that Selma still sees him and watches her hide her money in a tin.

The next day, Selma&#x27;s boss Norman believes that her eye condition has deteriorated; he accepts her resignation and pays her final wages, but promises to re-hire her once her sight has improved. However, Kathy accuses him of firing her. Not willing to get her job back, Jeff tries to escort her home by car, but she walks home along a railroad bridge instead (&quot;I&#x27;ve Seen It All&quot;). Opening the tin to add her money to it, Selma finds it empty. Realizing that Bill has robbed her, she goes to his house to confront him. Linda accuses Selma of trying to seduce her husband, explaining that Bill told her Selma wanted him for his money. Not wanting to reveal her knowledge of the impending foreclosure, Selma ignores Linda and confronts Bill about the theft. They fight over the money, with Bill drawing a gun only to be accidentally shot by Selma.

Bill yells for Linda to call the police, saying that Selma has tried to rob him, then begs Selma to kill him, telling her it is the only way she will ever reclaim her stolen money. Selma shoots Bill several times, but only wounds him further due to her poor vision, and finally beats him to death with her safe deposit box once the gun runs out of ammunition. She imagines that Bill&#x27;s corpse stands up and slow dances with her, and he and Linda absolve her of blame and tell her she just did what she had to do (&quot;Smith &amp; Wesson&quot;). Taking her money back, she flees the house and pays for Gene&#x27;s operation in advance.

Not knowing about the murder, Jeff takes Selma to rehearsal, where her director calls the police to have her arrested (&quot;In the Musicals, Part 1&quot;). In court, she is accused of being a Communist sympathizer and of pretending to be blind to exploit the American healthcare system. Although she tells as much truth about the situation as she can, she refuses to reveal Bill&#x27;s secret, saying that she had promised not to. When her claim of sending all her money to her father in Czechoslovakia is proven false, she is convicted of murder and sentenced to death (&quot;In the Musicals, Part 2&quot;). Kathy and Jeff eventually figure out what happened and recover Selma&#x27;s money, using it instead to pay for a trial lawyer who can free her. Selma refuses the lawyer, opting to face execution by hanging rather than let her son go blind, but she is deeply distraught as she awaits her death (&quot;107 Steps&quot;). As Selma reaches the gallows, she begins to panic and the guards strap her to a board. Kathy runs in with news that the operation has saved Gene&#x27;s vision and gives his glasses to Selma. Relieved, Selma sings a final song on the gallows with no musical accompaniment, but is hanged before she can finish the last verse; the final lines are displayed as the proceedings conclude (&quot;Next to Last Song&quot;).

==Cast==
==Production==

The film&#x27;s title suggests the Fred Astaire/Cyd Charisse duet &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; from the 1953 film &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;, which ties in with the film&#x27;s musical theatre theme.

Actress Björk, who is known primarily as a contemporary musician, had rarely acted before, and described the process of making this film as so emotionally taxing that she would not act in any film ever again (although she appeared in Matthew Barney&#x27;s film installation &quot;Drawing Restraint 9&quot; in 2005, and in Robert Eggers&#x27; &quot;The Northman&quot;). Trier and others have described her performance as feeling rather than acting. Björk has said that it is a misunderstanding that she was put off acting by this film; rather, she never wanted to act but made an exception for Lars von Trier.

The musical sequences were filmed simultaneously with over 100 digital cameras so that multiple angles of the performance could be captured and cut together later, thus shortening the filming schedule.

Björk lies down on a stack of birch logs during the &quot;Scatterheart&quot; sequence. In Icelandic and Swedish, &quot;björk&quot; means &quot;birch&quot;.

A Danish MY class locomotive and one T43 (both owned by Swedish train operator TÅGAB) were painted in the American Great Northern scheme for the film, and not repainted afterward.

===Style===
Much of the film has a similar look to von Trier&#x27;s earlier Dogme 95-influenced films: it is filmed on low-end, hand-held digital cameras to create a documentary-style appearance. It is not a true Dogme 95 film, however, because the Dogme rules stipulate that violence, non-diegetic music, and period pieces are not permitted. Trier differentiates the musical sequences from the rest of the film by using static cameras and by brightening the colours.

===Music===
* Original music: Björk
* Singers: Björk, Catherine Deneuve, Siobhan Fallon, David Morse, Cara Seymour, Edward Ross (for Vladica Kostic), Joel Grey, Peter Stormare (In the soundtrack &quot;Selmasongs&quot;, Thom Yorke sings instead of Stormare)
* Lyrics: Björk, Lars von Trier and Sjón
* Non-original music: Richard Rodgers (from &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;)
* Non-original lyrics: Oscar Hammerstein II (from &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;)
* Choreographer: Vincent Paterson

==Controversy==
==Reception==
===Critical response===
At the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; earned positive reviews from 70% of 122 critics, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The critics consensus on the website reads, &quot;&quot;Dancer in Dark&quot; can be grim, dull, and difficult to watch, but even so, it has a powerful and moving performance from Björk and is something quite new and visionary&quot;. According to Metacritic, which assigned the film a weighted average score of 63/100 based on 33 critic reviews, the film received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

On &quot;The Movie Show&quot;, Margaret Pomeranz gave it five stars while David Stratton gave it a zero, a score shared only by Geoffrey Wright&#x27;s &quot;Romper Stomper&quot; (1992). Stratton later described it as his &quot;favourite horror film&quot;. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; dubbed &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; the &quot;most shallow and crudely manipulative&quot; film of 2000, and in 2009 he described it as &quot;one of the worst films, one of the worst artworks and perhaps one of the worst things in the history of the world&quot;.

The film was praised for its stylistic innovations. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote: &quot;It smashes down the walls of habit that surround so many movies. It returns to the wellsprings. It is a bold, reckless gesture&quot;. Edward Guthmann from the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s great to see a movie so courageous and affecting, so committed to its own differentness&quot;. However, criticism was directed at its storyline. Jonathan Foreman of the &quot;New York Post&quot; described the film as &quot;meretricious fakery&quot; and called it &quot;so unrelenting in its manipulative sentimentality that, if it had been made by an American and shot in a more conventional manner, it would be seen as a bad joke&quot;. Fiachra Gibbons, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, considered the film to be &quot;the most unusual, extraordinary feel-good musical ever made&quot;.

In 2016, David Ehrlich ranked &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; as one of the best films of the 21st century, hailing Björk&#x27;s performance as the &quot;single greatest feat of film acting&quot; since 2000. Björk&#x27;s performance is also ranked in the &quot;25 Best Performances Not Nominated for an Oscar of the 21st Century&quot; list. Mia Goth credited the performance as one of her main influences, dubbing it &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;faultless&quot;.

===Box office===
The film previewed on 12 screens in Denmark where it grossed 1,562,965 Danish krone ($180,223). It officially opened in Scandinavia on 8 September 2000 where it grossed a disappointing $288,723 in its opening weekend. It grossed $103,102 (kr. 0.9 million) from 49 screens in Denmark, finishing in second place behind &quot;X-Men&quot;. In Sweden, it opened in fifth place with a gross of 928,621 Swedish krona ($96,330) from 34 screens. It also opened in fifth place in Norway with a gross of 587,495 Norwegian krone ($63,858). In Finland, it came sixth with a gross of 152,598 Finnish markka ($25,433) from six screens.
Overall, it grossed $45.6 million worldwide, including $4.2 million in the United States and Canada. It was number one at the Japanese box office for three weeks.

===Accolades===
&quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival and was awarded the Palme d&#x27;Or, along with the Best Actress award for Björk. The song &quot;I&#x27;ve Seen It All&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, at the performance of which Björk wore her famous swan dress.

&quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine conducts a poll every ten years of the world&#x27;s finest film directors to find out the Ten Greatest Films of All Time. This poll has been going since 1952, and has become the most recognised poll of its kind in the world. In 2012, Cyrus Frisch was one of the four directors who voted for &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;. Frisch commented: &quot;A superbly imaginative film that leaves conformity in shambles&quot;. Director Oliver Schmitz also lauded the work as &quot;relentless, claustrophobic, the best movie about capital punishment as far as I&#x27;m concerned&quot;.

<text>The Hilandar Monastery (, , , ) is one of the twenty Eastern Orthodox monasteries in Mount Athos in Greece and the only Serbian Orthodox monastery there.

It was founded in 1198 by two Serbs from the Grand Principality of Serbia, Stefan Nemanja (Saint Symeon) and his son Saint Sava. St. Symeon was the former Grand Prince of Serbia (1166–1196) who upon relinquishing his throne took monastic vows and became an ordinary monk. He joined his son Saint Sava who was already in Mount Athos and who later became the first Archbishop of Serbia. Upon its foundation, the monastery became a focal point of the Serbian religious and cultural life, as well as assumed the role of &quot;the first Serbian university&quot;. It is ranked fourth in the Athonite hierarchy of 20 sovereign monasteries.

It is regarded as the historical Serbian monastery on Mount Athos, traditionally inhabited by Serbian Orthodox monks. The &quot;Mother of God through her Icon of the Three Hands&quot; (Trojeručica) is considered the monastery&#x27;s abbess. The monastery contains about 45 working monks.

==Etymology==
The etymological meaning of &quot;Hilandar&quot; is probably derived from the Greek word &quot;chelandion&quot;, which is a type of Byzantine transport ship, whose skipper was called &quot;helandaris&quot;.

==Founding==
The monastery was founded in 1198; prompted by the Mount Athos monastic community, Byzantine Emperor Alexios III Angelos (1195–1203) issued a golden sealed chrysobulls donating the ancient monastery &quot;Helandaris,&quot; &quot;to the Serbs as an eternal gift...,&quot; thereby designating it, &quot;to serve the purpose of accepting the people of Serbian descent, who seek to pursue the monastic way of life, as monasteries belonging to Iberia and Amalfi endure on the Mount, exempt from any authority, including the authority of Protos.&quot; Hilandar was thereby handed over to Saint Sava and Saint Symeon with the mission of establishing and endowing a new monastery, elevated to the imperial rank. Since then, the monastery became a cornerstone of the religious, educational and cultural life of Serbian people.
Upon securing Serbian authority within the monastery, Saint Sava and Saint Symeon jointly constructed the monastery&#x27;s Church of the Entry of the Lady Theotokos into the Temple between 1198-1200, while also adding Saint Sava&#x27;s Tower, the Kambanski Tower, and Saint Symeon&#x27;s monastic chambers - cells. Saint Symeon&#x27;s middle son and Saint Sava&#x27;s older brother, Serbian Grand Prince Stefan &quot;the First-Crowned&quot; King provided financial resources for this restoration. As Hilandar&#x27;s founder, Saint Symeon issued a special founding charter or chrysobulls, which survived until World War II, when it was destroyed as a result of the Operation Punishment and the notorious April 6, 1941 Nazi Germany bombing of Belgrade that leveled to the ground the National Library of Serbia building in Kosancicev Venac. Following 1199, hundreds of monks from Serbia moved to the monastery, while large pieces of land, metochions and tax proceeds from numerous villages were provided to the monastery, especially from the Metohija region of Serbia.

Saint Symeon died in the monastery on February 13, 1200 where he was buried next to the main church of the Entry of the Lady Theotokos into the Temple. His body remained in Hilandar until 1208 when his myrrh-flowing remains were transferred to Serbia and interred into the mother-church of all Serbian churches the Studenica Monastery according to his original desire, which he previously completed in 1196. Following the relocation of Saint Symeon&#x27;s remains, what would eventually become world-famous grapevines began growing on the spot of his old tomb, which gives to this day miraculous grapes and seeds that are shipped all over as a form of blessing to childless married couples. Following his father&#x27;s death, Saint Sava moved to his Karyes hermitage cell, where he finished the writing of the Karyes Typikon, a book of directives, which shaped the eremitical monasticism all across the Serbian lands. He also wrote the Hilandar Typikon regulating spiritual life in monasteries, organization of services and duties of monastic communities. The Hilandar Typikon was modeled in part after the &quot;typikon&quot; of the Monastery of Theotokos Evergetis in Constantinople.

==The Nemanjić period and late Byzantine Empire ==
After the Fourth Crusade and Crusaders&#x27; sack of Constantinople in 1204, the whole Athos came under the Latin Occupation which exposed the Athonite monasteries to an unprecedented pillage. As a result, Saint Sava travelled to Serbia to secure more resources and support for the monastery. He also undertook a voyage to the Holy Land where he visited The Holy Lavra of Saint Sabbas the Sanctified in Palestine. There he received Hilandar&#x27;s most revered relic, the miraculous icon of the Three-handed Theotokos (Trojeručica) painted by St. John of Damascus. According to St. John of Damascus&#x27; last will, he ordered the Mar Saba monastery brethren to add this miraculous icon to the old prophesy made by the monastery&#x27;s founder Saint Sabbas the Sanctified. Saint Sabbas the Sanctified adjured his monks centuries earlier to donate the icon of the Milk-feeding Theotokos and his hegumen cane to the &quot;namesake monk of royal blood from a faraway land&quot; who would experience, during his pilgrimage to the monastery, the fall of his hegumen cane to the floor, previously affixed above his grave, while venerating icons and praying on that spot.

Serbian kings Stefan Radoslav and Stefan Vladislav, who were Saint Sava&#x27;s nephews, significantly endowed the monastery with new land possessions and proceeds. In order to effectively deal with consequences of the Crusader Latin plunder, King Uroš the Great constructed a large fortification surrounding the monastery with the protective tower named after the Transfiguration of Christ. King Dragutin also expanded proceeds to the monastery and land or metochion income. He participated in improving and reinforcing defensive fortifications. Following the end of the Latin Occupation of this part of Byzantium, a new wave of raids hit the monastic republic. In the early 14th century, pirate mercenaries of the Catalan Grand Company repeatedly raided the Holy Mountain, while looting and sacking numerous monasteries, stealing treasures and Christian relics, and terrorizing monks. Of the 300 monasteries and monastic communities on Athos, Hilandar was among only 35 that survived the violence of the first decade of the 14th century. The monastery owes this fortune to its very experienced and skillful deputy hegumen at the time Danilo, who later became the Serbian Archbishop Danilo II.
Consequently, Serbian King Milutin played a major role in building the Hilandar monastery complex by reconstructing and expanding it. In 1320 he completely reconstructed the main church of the Entry of the Lady Theotokos into the Temple which finally took its present shape as it became a symbol of Hilandar. The monastery complex was expended further north to encompass new monastic cells and fortifications. During his reign, several towers were completed, notably the Milutin Tower, located between monastery&#x27;s docks and its eastern wall, and the Hrussiya or Basil&#x27;s Tower situated on the shore. Milutin also added a new main entrance gate which a chapel dedicated to Saint Nicholas built in, in addition to the newly erected monastery dining chamber. An unmatched iconographic work took place during Milutin&#x27;s era starting from the main church, through the dining chamber, to the cemetery church. At that time the number of Serbian monks skyrocketed and monasticism flourished even further as Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos donated large pieces of land to the monastery&#x27;s estate in Greece.

At the time of Serbian King and Emperor Dusan, the whole Mount Athos came under his sovereign power. This is the period of Hilandar&#x27;s greatest prosperity. The Emperor significantly supported the monastery and bequeathed a number of land possessions in Serbia and Greece to it. Ever since his reign (14th century) and until today, Hilandar owns one fifth of the entire landmass on Athos. In addition to the Emperor himself, Dusan&#x27;s aristocracy also supported the monastery. In 1347 Emperor Dusan sought refuge in Hilandar while escaping the plague pandemics that devastated Europe. He also took his wife Empress Jelena with him, thus creating a precedent and violating the strict tradition of &quot;avaton&quot; that bars women from stepping into Mount Athos. Oral tradition holds that during her stay in Hilandar, the Empress was not allowed to plant her foot on the Athos ground as she was carried around by her escort. In memory of Emperor Dusan&#x27;s visit, the Hilandar monks erected big cross and planted the &quot;imperial olive tree&quot; on the spot where they welcomed him. Serbian Emperor also built the Church of St. Archangels and expanded the monastery&#x27;s hospital around 1350, while Empress Jelena endowed the Karyes monastic cell dedicated to St. Sava which belongs to Hilandar. Both Hilandar and Mount Athos already enjoyed tremendous reverence in Serbia as the monastery&#x27;s deputy hegumen Sava became Serbian Patriarch Sava IV. Following Emperor Dusan&#x27;s death in 1355, the monastery prospered even further. In addition to Dusan&#x27;s son Serbian Emperor Uros V, powerful noblemen also supported Hilandar, such as Prince Lazar Hrebeljanovic who constructed the narthex along the west side of the main Entry of the Lady Theotokos into the Temple Church in 1380. By the end of the 14th century, Hilandar served as a refuge to numerous members of Serbian nobility. 

==Ottoman and modern period==

The Byzantine Empire was conquered in the 15th century by the Ottoman Turks and their newly established Ottoman Empire. The Athonite monks tried to maintain functioning relations with the Ottoman sultans and following Murad II&#x27;s occupation of Thessaloniki in 1430 they pledged their obedience to him. Murad II left Mount Athos its self-rule and allocated for some remaining privileges. Hilandar retained its property rights and autonomy in the hinterland. This was additionally confirmed and secured in 1457 by Sultan Mehmed II following the 1453 Fall of Constantinople. Thus, the Athonite independence was somewhat ensured.

In the second half of the 15th century, Hilandar moved to third place in the hierarchy of Athionite monasteries. It also became a refuge for Serbian monks seeking to evade the conflicts of the time. Following the fall of the Serbian Despotate to the Ottoman Turks in 1459, Hilandar lost major guardians and benefactors as its brotherhood looked for support from other sources. For a period of time, the Wallachians provided patronage to the monastery, initiated by Mara Branković, daughter of the Serbian despot Đurađ Branković. In 1503, the wife of Serbian Despot Stefan Brankovic, Angelina Brankovic asked for the first time Grand Prince of Moscow Vasili III Ivanovich to protect the monastery. Deputy hegumen Paisios with three other monks visited Moscow in 1550 and inquired about help and protection at High Porte in Istanbul from Russian Tsar Ivan IV, also known as Ivan the Terrible. He took Hilandar under his personal protection and built the new monastic cells. In March 1556, Tsar Ivan IV Vasilyevich, whose maternal grandmother Ana Jakšić was by birth member the Serbian Jakšić noble family and paternal great-great-grandmother Helena, Empress Consort of Byzantium was also Serbian, also granted the Hilandar Monastery a plot of land with all necessary buildings in Moscow within a short walking distance from the Kremlin. The 16th century saw the monastery acquire significant estate in the area, cementing their presence in the Mount Athos region.

In the 17th century the number of Serbian monks dwindled, and the disastrous fire in 1722 saw a decline: in his account of 1745, Russian pilgrim Vasily Barsky wrote that Hilandar was headed by Bulgarian monks, even though the presence of Serbian monks was also noted. Ilarion Makariopolski, Sophronius of Vratsa and Matey Preobrazhenski had all lived there, and it was in this monastery that Saint Paisius of Hilendar began his revolutionary &quot;Slavonic-Bulgarian History&quot;. The monastery was dominated by Bulgarians until the late 19th century.


However, in 1913, Serbian presence on Athos was quite big and the Athonite &quot;protos&quot; was the Serbian representative of Hilandar.

===Contemporary===
In the 1970s, the Greek government offered power grid installation to all of the monasteries on Mount Athos. The Holy Council of Mount Athos refused, and since then every monastery generates its own power, which is gained mostly from renewable energy sources. During the 1980s, electrification of the monastery of Hilandar took place, generating power mostly for lights and heating.

In 1990, Hilandar was converted from an idiorrhythmic monastery into a cenobitic one.

On March 4, 2004, there was a devastating fire at the Hilandar monastery, which destroyed much of the walled complex and all the wooden elements. The library and the monastery&#x27;s many historic icons were saved or otherwise untouched by the fire. Vast reconstruction efforts to restore Hilandar are underway.

==Sacred objects==
Among the numerous relics and other holy objects treasured at the monastery is the Wonderworking Icon of the Theotokos &quot;Of the Akathist&quot;, the feast day of which is celebrated on January 12. Since Mount Athos uses the traditional Julian Calendar, the day they name as January 12 currently falls on January 25 of the modern Gregorian Calendar.

The monastery also possesses the Wonderworking Icon of the Theotokos &quot;Of the Three Hands&quot; (Greek: &quot;Tricherusa&quot;, Serbian: Тројеручицa), traditionally associated with a miraculous healing of St. John Damascene. Around the year 717, St. John became a monk at Mar Sabbas monastery outside of Jerusalem and gave the icon to the monastic community there. Later the icon was offered to St. Sava of Serbia, who gave it to the Hilandar. A copy of the icon was sent to Russia in 1661, from which time it has been highly venerated in the Russian Orthodox Church. This icon has two feast days: June 28 (July 11) and July 12 (July 25). Also Emperor Stefan Dušan&#x27;s sword is in the monastery treasure.

There are some 1200 Slavic manuscripts. Archives include 172 Greek and 154 Serbian documents from the medieval era, which provides a glimpse into the economic and social structure of the period. The Serbian variant of Old Church Slavonic developed at the monastery thanks to its scriptorium.

<text>The Hilandar Research Library (HRL), located in the Thompson Library on the campus of Ohio State University, has the largest collection of medieval Slavic manuscripts on microform in the world.

==Hilandar Research Library Collection==
The collection is composed of microform material from more than 100 different private, museum, and library collections in dozens of countries. It includes many Cyrillic manuscripts on microform, the majority from various monasteries on Mount Athos, Greece, including the entire Slavic collection of the Hilandar Monastery. The library also contains a 100,000 volume reference collection. The entire collection can be viewed in the Jack and Jan Creighton Special Collections Reading Room (Thompson Library). The HRL shares its space with the Resource Center for Medieval Slavic Studies (RCMSS). Both the Hilandar Library and the Resource Center for Medieval Slavic Studies were developed as an outgrowth of the original Hilandar Research Project, which ran from 1969 to 1982.

==Resource Center for Medieval Slavic Studies==
Founded in 1984, the Resource Center for Medieval Slavic Studies (RCMSS) is an independent center of the Ohio State University College of Humanities and is dedicated to the promotion of medieval Slavic Studies. The Resource Center for Medieval Slavic Studies fosters and supports research and collaboration in medieval Slavic languages, linguistics, history, and culture.

<text>A sopranist (also known as male soprano) is a male singer who is able to sing in vocal tessitura of a soprano, usually through falsetto or head voice technique. This voice type is a specific kind of countertenor.
In rare cases an adult man may be able to sing in the soprano range using his normal or modal voice (high chest voice) and not falsetto due to endocrinological reasons, like Radu Marian, or as a result of a larynx that has not completely developed as is allegedly the case of Michael Maniaci. 

==Voice==
A sopranist is able to sing in the soprano vocal range which is approximately between C4 and C6, though at times may expand somewhat higher or lower. Men of all voice types can possess the wide-ranged and effective falsetto or head voice needed to produce the contralto, mezzo-soprano and soprano vocal ranges. Some countertenors can sing up into the female vocal tessituras using the modal register (normal singing production) and need not employ any falsetto.

==Controversy over the term male soprano==
Typically, the term &quot;soprano&quot; refers to female singers but at times the term &quot;male soprano&quot; has been used by men who sing in the soprano vocal range using falsetto vocal production instead of the modal voice. This practice is most commonly found in the context of choral music in England. However, these men are more commonly referred to as countertenors or sopranists. The practice of referring to countertenors as &quot;male sopranos&quot; is somewhat controversial within vocal pedagogical circles as these men do not produce sound in the same physiological way that female sopranos do. Radu Marian can refer to himself as a true male soprano because he is able to sing in the soprano vocal range using the modal voice.

==Repertoire==
There is a large body of music for the male soprano that was written when it was common to use a castrato – a voice type which, for all intents and purposes, no longer exists, as the practice of castrating trebles was abolished before the end of the 19th century. Sopranists are very rare, since most countertenors are altos and mezzos. In fact, probably because early famous countertenors were altos (like Alfred Deller), it was believed for a long time that countertenors can only be altos (and later, mezzo countertenors, like David Daniels or Jochen Kowalski were recognized). While there is some modern repertoire written for countertenors (sometimes written specifically for certain singers, like Britten&#x27;s &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, which has a part that was written specifically for James Bowman), at present there are only a small number of modern pieces written specifically for the sopranist vocal type. An exception is Alfred Schnittke&#x27;s 1995 opera &quot;Historia von D. Johann Fausten&quot; which calls for both a female alto and a male soprano Mephistopheles.

<doc id="256727" wikidata="Q3484281" url="?curid=256727" title="Simon Fraser of Balnain">
<text>Simon Fraser (1729 – 7 October 1777) was a British general during the American War of Independence. He was killed in the Battle of Bemis Heights during the Saratoga Campaign. The shot that killed Fraser is often attributed to Timothy Murphy, of Daniel Morgan&#x27;s Rifle Corps, which was assigned to the Left and under the command of Benedict Arnold, who was leading Morgan&#x27;s men as well as Dearborn, Cilley, Poor, and the rest of the American left wing, which was attempting to push back the reconnaissance in force led by Simon Fraser on the Barber Wheatfield.

==Early life and military service==

Simon was born 26 May 1729, the son of Alexander Fraser of Balnain, son of Hugh Fraser of Balnain by his wife Katherine Chisholm, daughter of Alexander Chisholm 19th of Chisholm by his wife, eldest daughter of Roderick Mackenzie I of Applecross. Simon Fraser&#x27;s mother was his father&#x27;s second wife, Jean Mackintosh, daughter of Angus Mackintosh 10th of Kyllachy by his wife Lucy, daughter of Sir Alexander Mackenzie, 2nd baronet of Coul. Simon&#x27;s brother Thomas Fraser (born 8 June 1726), M.D. of Antigua&#x27;s daughter Jean married Charles Grant, parents of Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg

Apparently seeking to atone for the participation of Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat in the Jacobite rising of 1745, he fought with the Dutch army at Siege of Bergen-op-Zoom in 1747, and joined the British Army as a lieutenant in 1755.

Fraser went to Canada with the British forces in the French and Indian War and took part in the Siege of Louisbourg. He was promoted to captain before taking part in the Battle of Quebec in 1759. At that battle, he was in James Wolfe&#x27;s boat crossing St Lawrence. It was his reply, in French through the fog, that enabled the party to sneak ashore before ascending to the Plains of Abraham. He is not the Simon Fraser depicted in the famous painting The Death of General Wolfe.

Fraser served in Germany, Ireland, and Gibraltar between wars. In 1768, he became the Lt. Colonel of the 24th Regiment of Foot.

==American War of Independence==
In 1776, the 24th was transferred to Quebec in response to the American invasion, and Governor Guy Carleton promoted him to Brigadier General. When John Burgoyne organized his Saratoga campaign in 1777, Fraser was chosen to command the advance unit.

===Ticonderoga===
At the start of the campaign, the advance corps had about 1,000 men. Besides his own 24th Regiment of Foot, he had the grenadier battalion, the light infantry battalion, and a company of marksmen, along with some Canadian militia and First Nations auxiliaries. Fraser&#x27;s command was in the vanguard during the taking of Fort Ticonderoga, and Fraser helped dislodge the retreating Americans.

===Hubbardton===
On 7 July 1777, Fraser&#x27;s corps caught up with the American rear guard at the town of Hubbardton in the newly formed Republic of Vermont. At the Battle of Hubbardton in a sharp skirmish he drove off the enemy but with the loss of many men.

===Freeman&#x27;s Farm===
At the Freeman&#x27;s farm on 19 September he commanded the right wing and led four companies in a successful attack on Daniel Morgan&#x27;s riflemen.

===Bemis Heights===

Early in the Battle of Bemis Heights on 7 October 1777, Fraser fell to rifle fire from Daniel Morgan&#x27;s rifle brigade. Legend has it that a rifleman named Timothy Murphy was specifically ordered by Benedict Arnold to target Fraser, as he was vigorously directing and supporting his troops. He was carried to a nearby house and placed in the care of Baroness Riedesel, where he died that evening. He was reportedly buried in a nearby redoubt, but the exact location is uncertain. In her diary, the Baroness noted that he was &quot;...buried at six o&#x27;clock in the evening, on a hill, which was a sort of redoubt.&quot;

The depiction by the artist John Graham in 1792 shows Fraser being wrapped for burial on the battlefield, surrounded by grieving officers and soldiers under his command. Also killed during the action was Francis Clerke (1748–1777), the aide-de-camp to General Burgoyne. Clerke was also shot and killed by Morgan&#x27;s riflemen as he rode upon the field to deliver orders to Fraser from Burgoyne to fall back, orders that never reached him.

Fraser&#x27;s death is noted by a memorial plaque in the Saratoga Battlefield National Park.

===Portrayal in historical fiction===

Fraser is a character in Diana Gabaldon&#x27;s historical fiction novel &quot;An Echo in the Bone&quot; in which she portrays him as a kinsman to several of the major characters in the book, most notably Jamie Fraser, who is fighting on the side of the revolutionaries and William Ransom, Jamie&#x27;s son, who is fighting for the British under Simon Fraser&#x27;s command. The book diverts from the historical events when Gabaldon uses a request by Horatio Gates as an excuse for three main characters, Jamie, his wife Claire, and Jamie&#x27;s nephew Ian Murray, to return to Scotland under the auspices of escorting Fraser&#x27;s disinterred body back to his homeland.

<doc id="256729" wikidata="Q5332222" url="?curid=256729" title="Eccleshall Castle">
<text>Eccleshall Castle is located in Eccleshall, Staffordshire, England (). It was originally built in the 13th century. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a Grade II* listed building.

==Origins==
The land was reputedly granted to St Chad, the medieval bishop of Lichfield. In 1200 Bishop Geoffrey de Muschamp was granted by King John a ‘licence to crenellate’ a castle. As Eccleshall was conveniently situated on the main road between the centres of the Lichfield diocese in Chester, Lichfield and Coventry it was an ideal location as a diocesan base. This original castle was replaced by a larger castle in 1305 by Bishop Walter Langton, Chancellor of England.

==War of the Roses==
At the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses, Margaret of Anjou, Queen consort of Henry VI, took refuge within the castle after the Battle of Blore Heath in 1459.

In June 1643 the castle was besieged by Sir William Brereton and his Parliamentary forces encamped around the church. Their guns caused considerable damage to the walls but the castle held out, with Bishop Robert Wright sheltering within. When the Parliamentary forces finally took the castle on August 30 they found that the bishop had died of a heart attack during the siege and most of the defenders were either drunk or had gone into town drinking in the taverns. The castle was slighted to prevent future use as a stronghold but enough of the building, including an unusual nine-sided tower, together with the moat walls and medieval bridge, remained to be used as a prison for Royalist gentry. The castle and its grounds were confiscated and sold, but bought back again by the diocese.

==Later history==
The present house, still known as Eccleshall Castle, was built amongst the ruins in 1693 by William Lloyd, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, incorporating fragments of the slighted 14th-century structure, and was also occupied by successive bishops of Lichfield. Sir Walter Scott often stayed at the castle as guest of then bishop, James Cornwallis. In the 18th century the gatehouse was demolished and the moat drained. The last bishop to live there was John Lonsdale, who died in the house in 1867.

==Today==
The Castle is now in private hands and closed to the public, although the gardens are occasionally opened to raise money for local Eccleshall charities as well as for occasional weddings. It has been the home of the Carter-Motley family for more than a hundred years.

<text>John Nicholson Ireland (13 August 187912 June 1962) was an English composer and teacher of music. The majority of his output consists of piano miniatures and of songs with piano. His best-known works include the short instrumental or orchestral work &quot;The Holy Boy&quot;, a setting of the poem &quot;Sea-Fever&quot; by John Masefield, a formerly much-played Piano Concerto, the hymn tune Love Unknown and the choral motet &quot;Greater Love Hath No Man&quot;.

== Life ==

John Ireland was born in Bowdon, near Altrincham, Cheshire, into a family of English and Scottish descent and some cultural distinction. His father, Alexander Ireland, a publisher and newspaper proprietor, was aged 69 at John&#x27;s birth. John was the youngest of the five children from Alexander&#x27;s second marriage (his first wife had died). His mother, Annie Elizabeth Nicholson Ireland, was a biographer and 30 years younger than Alexander. She died in October 1893, when John was 14, and Alexander died the following year, when John was 15. John Ireland was described as &quot;a self-critical, introspective man, haunted by memories of a sad childhood&quot;.

Ireland entered the Royal College of Music in 1893, studying piano with Frederic Cliffe, and organ, his second study, under Walter Parratt. From 1897 he studied composition under Charles Villiers Stanford. In 1896 Ireland was appointed sub-organist at Holy Trinity, Sloane Street, London SW1, and later, from 1904 until 1926, was organist and choirmaster at St Luke&#x27;s Church, Chelsea.

Ireland began to make his name in the early 1900s as a composer of songs and chamber music. His Violin Sonata No. 1 of 1909 won first prize in the Cobbett Competition. Even more successful was his Violin Sonata No. 2: completed in January 1917, he submitted this to a competition organised to assist musicians in wartime. The jury included the violinist Albert Sammons and the pianist William Murdoch, who together gave the work its first performance at Aeolian Hall in New Bond Street on 6 March that year. As Ireland recalled, &quot;It was probably the first and only occasion when a British composer was lifted from relative obscurity in a single night by a work cast in a chamber-music medium.&quot; The work was enthusiastically reviewed, and the publisher Winthrop Rogers offered immediate publication (the first edition was sold out even before it had been processed by the printers). A subsequent performance of the Violin Sonata by Ireland and the violinist Désiré Defauw drew a packed audience to the Wigmore Hall in London.

Ireland frequently visited the Channel Islands and was inspired by the landscape and the ambience. In 1912 he composed the piano piece &quot;The Island Spell&quot; (the first of the three pieces in his set &quot;Decorations&quot;) while staying in Jersey, and his set of three pieces for piano &quot;&quot; was written while living in Guernsey in 1939 to 1940. He returned from Guernsey to Britain in 1940 just before the German invasion of the Channel Islands during World War II.

From 1923 he taught at the Royal College of Music. His pupils there included Richard Arnell, Ernest John Moeran, Benjamin Britten (who later described Ireland as possessing &quot;a strong personality but a weak character&quot;), composer Alan Bush, Geoffrey Bush (no relation to Alan), who subsequently edited or arranged many of Ireland&#x27;s works for publication, Anthony Bernard and Percy Turnbull (who became a lifelong friend).

John Ireland was a lifelong bachelor, except for a brief interlude when, in quick succession, he married, separated, and divorced. On 17 December 1926, aged 47, he married a 17-year old pupil, Dorothy Phillips. This marriage was dissolved on 18 September 1928, and it is believed not to have been consummated. He took a similar interest in another young student, Helen Perkin, a pianist and composer, to whom he dedicated both the &quot;Piano Concerto in E-flat major&quot; and the &quot;Legend&quot; for piano and orchestra (which began life as a second concerto). She gave the premiere performance of both works, but any thoughts he had for a deeper relationship with her came to nothing when she married George Mountford Adie, a disciple of George Gurdjieff, and she later moved with Adie to Australia. Subsequently, Ireland withdrew the dedications. In 1947 Ireland acquired a personal assistant and companion, Mrs Norah Kirkby, who remained with him till his death. Despite these associations with women, it is clear from his private papers that he was a closeted homosexual; several commentators support this view.
On 10 September 1949, his 70th birthday was celebrated in a special Prom concert, at which his Piano Concerto was played by Eileen Joyce, who was also the first pianist to record the concerto, in 1942.

Ireland retired in 1953, settling in the hamlet of Rock in Sussex, where he lived in a converted windmill, Rock Mill, Washington, for the rest of his life. It was there he met the young pianist Alan Rowlands who would be Ireland&#x27;s choice to record his complete piano music.

He died of heart failure aged 82 at Rock Mill and is buried at St. Mary the Virgin in Shipley, near his home. His epitaph reads &quot;Many waters cannot quench love&quot; and &quot;One of God&#x27;s noblest works lies here.&quot;

== Music ==

From Stanford, Ireland inherited a thorough knowledge of the music of Beethoven, Brahms and other German classical composers, but as a young man he was also strongly influenced by Debussy and Ravel as well as by the earlier works of Stravinsky and Bartók. From these influences, he developed his own brand of &quot;English Impressionism&quot;, related more closely to French and Russian models than to the folk-song style then prevailing in English music.

Like most other Impressionist composers, Ireland favoured small forms and wrote neither symphonies nor operas, although his Piano Concerto is considered among the best works composed by an Englishman. His output includes some chamber music and a substantial body of piano works, including his best-known piece &quot;The Holy Boy&quot;, known in numerous arrangements. He wrote songs to poems by A. E. Housman, Thomas Hardy, Christina Rossetti, John Masefield, Rupert Brooke and others. Due to his job at St Luke&#x27;s Church, he also wrote hymns, carols, and other sacred choral music; among choirs he is probably best known for the anthem &quot;Greater love hath no man&quot;, often sung in services that commemorate the victims of war. The hymn tune &quot;Love Unknown&quot; is sung in churches throughout the English-speaking world, as is his Communion Service in C major.

His works have been recorded and performed by Choir of Westminster Abbey, The Choir of Wells Cathedral and many others.

He appears as pianist in a recording of his Fantasy-Sonata for Clarinet and Piano with Frederick Thurston, his Cello Sonata (1923) with cellist Antoni Sala and his Violin Sonata No. 1 (1909) with Frederick Grinke, who performed and recorded several of his chamber works. His Piano Sonatina (192627) and a number from his cycle &quot;Songs Sacred and Profane&quot; (1929) were dedicated to his friend the conductor and BBC music producer Edward Clark.

Ireland wrote his only film score for the 1946 Australian film &quot;The Overlanders&quot;, from which an orchestral suite was extracted posthumously by Charles Mackerras. Some of his pieces, such as the popular &quot;A Downland Suite&quot; and &quot;Themes from Julius Caesar&quot;, were completed or re-transcribed after his death by his student Geoffrey Bush.

<text>Rebecka Månstråle Liljeberg (born 13 May 1981) is a Swedish former actress who starred in the Swedish film &quot;Show Me Love&quot; (&quot;Fucking Åmål&quot;) (1998).

==Early life and career==
Rebecka was born in the town of Turinge, Sweden to an 18-year-old Swedish mother Kristina, and a 24-year-old Finnish father, Jyrki. Her parents divorced when she was one year old. As a child, she acted at Vår teater, a children&#x27;s theatre in Stockholm. At the age of nine, Liljeberg won a role in the series &quot;Sunes jul&quot;. Between 1993 and 1997, she continued in amateur theatre until landing a role in the film &quot;Närkontakt&quot; later in 1997. The following year, she got her breakthrough in the Lukas Moodysson film &quot;Show Me Love&quot; (&quot;Fucking Åmål&quot;) (1998). She quit high school to make the film, which ultimately won her the 1999 Guldbagge Awards for best actress, together with Alexandra Dahlström.

After her roles in &quot;Fucking Åmål&quot; and &quot;Sherdil&quot;, Liljeberg began an adult education course in order to graduate from high school. While studying, she also starred in the relatively successful arthouse film &quot;Bear&#x27;s Kiss&quot; which was her first and only English-speaking film and dubbed a character in the Swedish version of the IMAX 3D movie &quot;T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous&quot;. In 2002, she completed the adult education course, and went on to study medicine at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, one of the largest medical universities in Europe.

==Personal life==
Liljeberg stopped acting after her film &quot;Bear&#x27;s Kiss&quot; (2002) and now works as a doctor after completing her residency at Södersjukhuset in Stockholm. She lives in Stockholm.

<text>The ordered exponential, also called the path-ordered exponential, is a mathematical operation defined in non-commutative algebras, equivalent to the exponential of the integral in the commutative algebras. In practice the ordered exponential is used in matrix and operator algebras. It is a kind of product integral, or Volterra integral.

== Definition ==

Let be an algebra over a field , and be an element of parameterized by the real numbers,
:formula_1

The parameter in is often referred to as the &quot;time parameter&quot; in this context.

The ordered exponential of is denoted
:formula_2

where the term is equal to 1 and where formula_3 is the time-ordering operator. It is a higher-order operation that ensures the exponential is time-ordered, so that any product of that occurs in the expansion of the exponential is ordered such that the value of is increasing from right to left of the product. For example:
:formula_4
Time ordering is required, as products in the algebra are not necessarily commutative.

The operation maps a parameterized element onto another parameterized element, or symbolically,
:formula_5

There are various ways to define this integral more rigorously.

=== Product of exponentials ===

The ordered exponential can be defined as the left product integral of the infinitesimal exponentials, or equivalently, as an ordered product of exponentials in the limit as the number of terms grows to infinity:
:formula_6

where the time moments are defined as for , and .

The ordered exponential is in fact a geometric integral.

=== Solution to a differential equation ===

The ordered exponential is unique solution of the initial value problem:
:formula_7

=== Solution to an integral equation ===

The ordered exponential is the solution to the integral equation:
:formula_8

This equation is equivalent to the previous initial value problem.

=== Infinite series expansion ===

The ordered exponential can be defined as an infinite sum,
:formula_9

This can be derived by recursively substituting the integral equation into itself.

== Example ==

Given a manifold formula_10 where for a formula_11 with group transformation formula_12 it holds at a point formula_13:

: formula_14

Here, formula_15 denotes exterior differentiation and formula_16 is the connection operator (1-form field) acting on formula_17. When integrating above equation it holds (now, formula_16 is the connection operator expressed in a coordinate basis)

: formula_19

with the path-ordering operator formula_20 that orders factors in order of the path formula_21. For the special case that formula_16 is an antisymmetric operator and formula_23 is an infinitesimal rectangle with edge lengths formula_24 and corners at points formula_25 above expression simplifies as follows :

: formula_26

Hence, it holds the group transformation identity formula_27. If formula_28 is a smooth connection, expanding above quantity to second order in infinitesimal quantities formula_24 one obtains for the ordered exponential the identity with a correction term that is proportional to the curvature tensor.

<doc id="256738" wikidata="Q1758924" url="?curid=256738" title="Tensor field">
<text>In mathematics and physics, a tensor field is a function assigning a tensor to each point of a region of a mathematical space (typically a Euclidean space or manifold) or of the physical space. Tensor fields are used in differential geometry, algebraic geometry, general relativity, in the analysis of stress and strain in material object, and in numerous applications in the physical sciences. As a tensor is a generalization of a scalar (a pure number representing a value, for example speed) and a vector (a magnitude and a direction, like velocity), a tensor field is a generalization of a &quot;scalar field&quot; and a &quot;vector field&quot; that assigns, respectively, a scalar or vector to each point of space. If a tensor is defined on a vector fields set over a module , we call a tensor field on .
Many mathematical structures called &quot;tensors&quot; are also tensor fields. For example, the Riemann curvature tensor is a tensor &quot;field&quot; as it associates a tensor to each point of a Riemannian manifold, which is a topological space.


== Definition ==

Let &quot;M&quot; be a manifold, for instance the Euclidean plane &quot;Rn&quot;.

Equivalently, it is a collection of elements &quot;Tx &quot;∈&quot; Vx&quot;⊗p ⊗ (&quot;Vx*&quot;)⊗q for all points &quot;x ∈ M&quot;, arranging into a smooth map &quot;T : M → V&quot;⊗p ⊗ (&quot;V*&quot;)⊗q. Elements &quot;Tx&quot; are called tensors.

Often we take &quot;V = TM&quot; to be the tangent bundle of &quot;M&quot;.

==Geometric introduction==

Intuitively, a vector field is best visualized as an &quot;arrow&quot; attached to each point of a region, with variable length and direction. One example of a vector field on a curved space is a weather map showing horizontal wind velocity at each point of the Earth&#x27;s surface.

Now consider more complicated fields. For example, if the manifold is Riemannian, then it has a metric field formula_1, such that given any two vectors formula_2 at point formula_3, their inner product is formula_4. The field formula_1 could be given in matrix form, but it depends on a choice of coordinates. It could instead be given as an ellipsoid of radius 1 at each point, which is coordinate-free. Applied to the Earth&#x27;s surface, this is Tissot&#x27;s indicatrix.

In general, we want to specify tensor fields in a coordinate-independent way: It should exist independently of latitude and longitude, or whatever particular &quot;cartographic projection&quot; we are using to introduce numerical coordinates.

== Via coordinate transitions ==
Following and , the concept of a tensor relies on a concept of a reference frame (or coordinate system), which may be fixed (relative to some background reference frame), but in general may be allowed to vary within some class of transformations of these coordinate systems.

For example, coordinates belonging to the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional real coordinate space formula_6 may be subjected to arbitrary affine transformations:
:formula_7
(with &quot;n&quot;-dimensional indices, summation implied). A covariant vector, or covector, is a system of functions formula_8 that transforms under this affine transformation by the rule
:formula_9
The list of Cartesian coordinate basis vectors formula_10 transforms as a covector, since under the affine transformation formula_11. A contravariant vector is a system of functions formula_12 of the coordinates that, under such an affine transformation undergoes a transformation
:formula_13
This is precisely the requirement needed to ensure that the quantity formula_14 is an invariant object that does not depend on the coordinate system chosen. More generally, the coordinates of a tensor of valence (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;) have &quot;p&quot; upper indices and &quot;q&quot; lower indices, with the transformation law being
:formula_15

The concept of a tensor field may be obtained by specializing the allowed coordinate transformations to be smooth (or differentiable, analytic, etc.). A covector field is a function formula_8 of the coordinates that transforms by the Jacobian of the transition functions (in the given class). Likewise, a contravariant vector field formula_12 transforms by the inverse Jacobian.

== Tensor bundles ==

A tensor bundle is a fiber bundle where the fiber is a tensor product of any number of copies of the tangent space and/or cotangent space of the base space, which is a manifold. As such, the fiber is a vector space and the tensor bundle is a special kind of vector bundle.

The vector bundle is a natural idea of &quot;vector space depending continuously (or smoothly) on parameters&quot; – the parameters being the points of a manifold &quot;M&quot;. For example, a &quot;vector space of one dimension depending on an angle&quot; could look like a Möbius strip or alternatively like a cylinder. Given a vector bundle &quot;V&quot; over &quot;M&quot;, the corresponding field concept is called a &quot;section&quot; of the bundle: for &quot;m&quot; varying over &quot;M&quot;, a choice of vector

:&quot;vm&quot; in &quot;Vm&quot;,

where &quot;Vm&quot; is the vector space &quot;at&quot; &quot;m&quot;.

Since the tensor product concept is independent of any choice of basis, taking the tensor product of two vector bundles on &quot;M&quot; is routine. Starting with the tangent bundle (the bundle of tangent spaces) the whole apparatus explained at component-free treatment of tensors carries over in a routine way – again independently of coordinates, as mentioned in the introduction.

We therefore can give a definition of tensor field, namely as a section of some tensor bundle. (There are vector bundles that are not tensor bundles: the Möbius band for instance.) This is then guaranteed geometric content, since everything has been done in an intrinsic way. More precisely, a tensor field assigns to any given point of the manifold a tensor in the space

:formula_18

where &quot;V&quot; is the tangent space at that point and &quot;V&quot;∗ is the cotangent space. See also tangent bundle and cotangent bundle.

Given two tensor bundles &quot;E&quot; → &quot;M&quot; and &quot;F&quot; → &quot;M&quot;, a linear map &quot;A&quot;: Γ(&quot;E&quot;) → Γ(&quot;F&quot;) from the space of sections of &quot;E&quot; to sections of &quot;F&quot; can be considered itself as a tensor section of formula_19 if and only if it satisfies &quot;A&quot;(&quot;fs&quot;) = &quot;fA&quot;(&quot;s&quot;), for each section &quot;s&quot; in Γ(&quot;E&quot;) and each smooth function &quot;f&quot; on &quot;M&quot;. Thus a tensor section is not only a linear map on the vector space of sections, but a &quot;C&quot;∞(&quot;M&quot;)-linear map on the module of sections. This property is used to check, for example, that even though the Lie derivative and covariant derivative are not tensors, the torsion and curvature tensors built from them are.

==Notation==

The notation for tensor fields can sometimes be confusingly similar to the notation for tensor spaces. Thus, the tangent bundle &quot;TM&quot; = &quot;T&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) might sometimes be written as
:formula_20
to emphasize that the tangent bundle is the range space of the (1,0) tensor fields (i.e., vector fields) on the manifold &quot;M&quot;. This should not be confused with the very similar looking notation

:formula_21;

in the latter case, we just have one tensor space, whereas in the former, we have a tensor space defined for each point in the manifold &quot;M&quot;.

Curly (script) letters are sometimes used to denote the set of infinitely-differentiable tensor fields on &quot;M&quot;. Thus,
:formula_22
are the sections of the (&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) tensor bundle on &quot;M&quot; that are infinitely-differentiable. A tensor field is an element of this set.

== Tensor fields as multilinear forms ==
There is another more abstract (but often useful) way of characterizing tensor fields on a manifold &quot;M&quot;, which makes tensor fields into honest tensors (i.e. &quot;single&quot; multilinear mappings), though of a different type (although this is &quot;not&quot; usually why one often says &quot;tensor&quot; when one really means &quot;tensor field&quot;). First, we may consider the set of all smooth (C∞) vector fields on &quot;M&quot;, formula_23 (see the section on notation above) as a single space — a module over the ring of smooth functions, &quot;C&quot;∞(&quot;M&quot;), by pointwise scalar multiplication. The notions of multilinearity and tensor products extend easily to the case of modules over any commutative ring.

As a motivating example, consider the space formula_24 of smooth covector fields (1-forms), also a module over the smooth functions. These act on smooth vector fields to yield smooth functions by pointwise evaluation, namely, given a covector field &quot;ω&quot; and a vector field &quot;X&quot;, we define

: formula_25

Because of the pointwise nature of everything involved, the action of formula_26 on &quot;X&quot; is a &quot;C&quot;∞(&quot;M&quot;)-linear map, that is,

: formula_27

for any &quot;p&quot; in &quot;M&quot; and smooth function &quot;f&quot;. Thus we can regard covector fields not just as sections of the cotangent bundle, but also linear mappings of vector fields into functions. By the double-dual construction, vector fields can similarly be expressed as mappings of covector fields into functions (namely, we could start &quot;natively&quot; with covector fields and work up from there).

In a complete parallel to the construction of ordinary single tensors (not tensor fields!) on &quot;M&quot; as multilinear maps on vectors and covectors, we can regard general (&quot;k&quot;,&quot;l&quot;) tensor fields on &quot;M&quot; as &quot;C&quot;∞(&quot;M&quot;)-multilinear maps defined on &quot;k&quot; copies of formula_28 and &quot;l&quot; copies of formula_29 into &quot;C&quot;∞(&quot;M&quot;).

Now, given any arbitrary mapping &quot;T&quot; from a product of &quot;k&quot; copies of formula_28 and &quot;l&quot; copies of formula_29 into &quot;C&quot;∞(&quot;M&quot;), it turns out that it arises from a tensor field on &quot;M&quot; if and only if it is multilinear over &quot;C&quot;∞(&quot;M&quot;). Namely formula_32-module of tensor fields of type formula_33 over M is canonically isomorphic to formula_32-module of formula_32-multilinear forms 
: formula_36 

This kind of multilinearity implicitly expresses the fact that we&#x27;re really dealing with a pointwise-defined object, i.e. a tensor field, as opposed to a function which, even when evaluated at a single point, depends on all the values of vector fields and 1-forms simultaneously.

A frequent example application of this general rule is showing that the Levi-Civita connection, which is a mapping of smooth vector fields formula_37 taking a pair of vector fields to a vector field, does not define a tensor field on &quot;M&quot;. This is because it is only formula_38-linear in &quot;Y&quot; (in place of full &quot;C&quot;∞(&quot;M&quot;)-linearity, it satisfies the &quot;Leibniz rule,&quot; formula_39)). Nevertheless, it must be stressed that even though it is not a tensor field, it still qualifies as a geometric object with a component-free interpretation.

==Applications==

The curvature tensor is discussed in differential geometry and the stress–energy tensor is important in physics, and these two tensors are related by Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity.

In electromagnetism, the electric and magnetic fields are combined into an electromagnetic tensor field.

Differential forms, used in defining integration on manifolds, are a type of tensor field.

==Tensor calculus==

In theoretical physics and other fields, differential equations posed in terms of tensor fields provide a very general way to express relationships that are both geometric in nature (guaranteed by the tensor nature) and conventionally linked to differential calculus. Even to formulate such equations requires a fresh notion, the covariant derivative. This handles the formulation of variation of a tensor field &quot;along&quot; a vector field. The original &quot;absolute differential calculus&quot; notion, which was later called &quot;tensor calculus&quot;, led to the isolation of the geometric concept of connection.

==Twisting by a line bundle==

An extension of the tensor field idea incorporates an extra line bundle &quot;L&quot; on &quot;M&quot;. If &quot;W&quot; is the tensor product bundle of &quot;V&quot; with &quot;L&quot;, then &quot;W&quot; is a bundle of vector spaces of just the same dimension as &quot;V&quot;. This allows one to define the concept of tensor density, a &#x27;twisted&#x27; type of tensor field. A &quot;tensor density&quot; is the special case where &quot;L&quot; is the bundle of &quot;densities on a manifold&quot;, namely the determinant bundle of the cotangent bundle. (To be strictly accurate, one should also apply the absolute value to the transition functions – this makes little difference for an orientable manifold.) For a more traditional explanation see the tensor density article.

One feature of the bundle of densities (again assuming orientability) &quot;L&quot; is that &quot;L&quot;&quot;s&quot; is well-defined for real number values of &quot;s&quot;; this can be read from the transition functions, which take strictly positive real values. This means for example that we can take a &quot;half-density&quot;, the case where &quot;s&quot; = . In general we can take sections of &quot;W&quot;, the tensor product of &quot;V&quot; with &quot;L&quot;&quot;s&quot;, and consider tensor density fields with weight &quot;s&quot;.

Half-densities are applied in areas such as defining integral operators on manifolds, and geometric quantization.

==The flat case==

When &quot;M&quot; is a Euclidean space and all the fields are taken to be invariant by translations by the vectors of &quot;M&quot;, we get back to a situation where a tensor field is synonymous with a tensor &#x27;sitting at the origin&#x27;. This does no great harm, and is often used in applications. As applied to tensor densities, it &quot;does&quot; make a difference. The bundle of densities cannot seriously be defined &#x27;at a point&#x27;; and therefore a limitation of the contemporary mathematical treatment of tensors is that tensor densities are defined in a roundabout fashion.

==Cocycles and chain rules==

As an advanced explanation of the &quot;tensor&quot; concept, one can interpret the chain rule in the multivariable case, as applied to coordinate changes, also as the requirement for self-consistent concepts of tensor giving rise to tensor fields.

Abstractly, we can identify the chain rule as a 1-cocycle. It gives the consistency required to define the tangent bundle in an intrinsic way. The other vector bundles of tensors have comparable cocycles, which come from applying functorial properties of tensor constructions to the chain rule itself; this is why they also are intrinsic (read, &#x27;natural&#x27;) concepts.

What is usually spoken of as the &#x27;classical&#x27; approach to tensors tries to read this backwards – and is therefore a heuristic, &quot;post hoc&quot; approach rather than truly a foundational one. Implicit in defining tensors by how they transform under a coordinate change is the kind of self-consistency the cocycle expresses. The construction of tensor densities is a &#x27;twisting&#x27; at the cocycle level. Geometers have not been in any doubt about the &quot;geometric&quot; nature of tensor &quot;quantities&quot;; this kind of descent argument justifies abstractly the whole theory.

==Generalizations==
===Tensor densities===

The concept of a tensor field can be generalized by considering objects that transform differently. An object that transforms as an ordinary tensor field under coordinate transformations, except that it is also multiplied by the determinant of the Jacobian of the inverse coordinate transformation to the &quot;w&quot;th power, is called a tensor density with weight &quot;w&quot;. Invariantly, in the language of multilinear algebra, one can think of tensor densities as multilinear maps taking their values in a density bundle such as the (1-dimensional) space of &quot;n&quot;-forms (where &quot;n&quot; is the dimension of the space), as opposed to taking their values in just R. Higher &quot;weights&quot; then just correspond to taking additional tensor products with this space in the range.

A special case are the scalar densities. Scalar 1-densities are especially important because it makes sense to define their integral over a manifold. They appear, for instance, in the Einstein–Hilbert action in general relativity. The most common example of a scalar 1-density is the volume element, which in the presence of a metric tensor &quot;g&quot; is the square root of its determinant in coordinates, denoted formula_40. The metric tensor is a covariant tensor of order 2, and so its determinant scales by the square of the coordinate transition:
:formula_41
which is the transformation law for a scalar density of weight +2.

More generally, any tensor density is the product of an ordinary tensor with a scalar density of the appropriate weight. In the language of vector bundles, the determinant bundle of the tangent bundle is a line bundle that can be used to &#x27;twist&#x27; other bundles &quot;w&quot; times. While locally the more general transformation law can indeed be used to recognise these tensors, there is a global question that arises, reflecting that in the transformation law one may write either the Jacobian determinant, or its absolute value. Non-integral powers of the (positive) transition functions of the bundle of densities make sense, so that the weight of a density, in that sense, is not restricted to integer values. Restricting to changes of coordinates with positive Jacobian determinant is possible on orientable manifolds, because there is a consistent global way to eliminate the minus signs; but otherwise the line bundle of densities and the line bundle of &quot;n&quot;-forms are distinct. For more on the intrinsic meaning, see density on a manifold.

<text>Lena Marina Alexandra Dahlström (born 12 February 1984) is a Swedish actress and film director.

==Career==
Dahlström gained international attention in 1998, after starring as &quot;Elin&quot; in the film &quot;Show Me Love&quot;. For this, she won the Guldbagge Award for Best Actress, together with Rebecka Liljeberg. Despite receiving numerous offers to act in other films, she declined, stating that she wanted to concentrate on finishing school.

When once asked when she was younger what she wanted to be when she grew up, Dahlström stated: &quot;Serial killer, or rockstar&quot;.

In 2002, Dahlström acted as assistant director and Russian translator, alongside &quot;Show Me Love&quot; director Lukas Moodysson, with his film &quot;Lilya 4-ever&quot;.

In 2007 Dahlström had a small role in the Dutch soap opera &quot;Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden&quot; on RTL 4. She played a Swedish exchange student named Skylar Nilsson. On 18 April 2008 she returned to this role for a short period.

==Personal life==
Dahlström was born in Gävle, Sweden, and grew up in Stockholm. Her mother, Irina Borisovna, is Russian, and her father is Swedish. She speaks Swedish, Russian, German, French, English, and Italian.

She lived alone in Stockholm after graduating high school. She continued to act in theatre. After a several-year break, Dahlström again starred in the film Fröken Sverige (Miss Sweden), for which she received favorable reviews.

During the autumn of 2004 she was the DJ for the biggest late night talk show in Sweden, called &#x27;Late Night with Luuk&#x27;, which she had been originally interviewed on in May 1998 with Rebecka Liljeberg for her acting in &quot;Show Me Love&quot;. On her debut as DJ for the show, the guests were R.E.M. and British actor Paul Bettany.

After completing her studies, she lived in Rome, Italy, before moving back to Stockholm and is again pursuing a serious acting career. Dahlström is currently in a relationship with Jakob Wiklander. They have a daughter together, Florens.

<doc id="256745" wikidata="Q2348151" url="?curid=256745" title="Stanton Macdonald-Wright">
<text>Stanton Macdonald-Wright (July 8, 1890 – August 22, 1973), was a modern American artist. He was a co-founder of Synchromism, an early abstract, color-based mode of painting, which was the first American avant-garde art movement to receive international attention.

==Early life==
Stanton Macdonald-Wright was born in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1890. His first name, Stanton, was chosen to honor the women&#x27;s rights activist Elizabeth Cady Stanton; he later hyphenated his last name after repeatedly being asked if he were related to the famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright. He spent his adolescence in Santa Monica, California, where his father ran a seaside hotel. An amateur artist as well as a businessman, Macdonald-Wright&#x27;s father encouraged his artistic development from a young age and secured him private painting lessons. Stanton&#x27;s older brother, Willard Huntington Wright, was a writer and critic who gained international fame in the 1920s by writing the Philo Vance detective novels under the pseudonym S.S. Van Dine.

==Synchromism: Europe and New York==
Married at the age of seventeen, Macdonald-Wright moved to Paris with his wife to immerse himself in European art and to study at the Sorbonne, the Académie Julian, the École des Beaux-Arts and the Académie Colarossi. He and fellow student Morgan Russell studied with Canadian painter Percyval Tudor-Hart between 1911 and 1913. They were deeply influenced by their teacher&#x27;s color theory, which connected the qualities of color to those of music, as well as by the works of Delacroix, the Impressionists, Cézanne, and Matisse that placed a great emphasis on juxtapositions and reverberations of color. During these years Macdonald-Wright and Russell developed Synchromism (meaning &quot;with color&quot;), seeking to free their art form from a literal description of the world and believing that painting was a practice akin to music that should be divorced from representational associations. Macdonald-Wright collaborated with Russell in painting abstract &quot;synchromies&quot; and staged Synchromist exhibitions in Munich in June 1913, in Paris in October 1913, and in New York in March 1914. These established Synchromism as an influence in modern art well into the 1920s, though followers of other abstract artists (principally, the Orphists Robert and Sonia Delaunay) were later to claim that the Synchromists had merely borrowed the principles of color abstraction from Orphism, a point vehemently disputed by Macdonald-Wright and Russell. While in Europe, Macdonald-Wright met Matisse, Rodin, and Gertrude and Leo Stein, and Thomas Hart Benton, who called Stanton &quot;the most gifted all-around fellow I ever knew&quot;. He and Russell returned to the United States hopeful of acclaim and financial success and were eager to promote their cause.
In 1915, Stanton&#x27;s brother, by that time a respected editor and critic in the New York literary world, published one of the first and most comprehensive surveys of advanced art to appear in the United States. Secretly co-authored by Stanton, &quot;Modern Painting: Its Tendency and Meaning&quot; reviews the major art movements of the previous century from Manet to Cubism, praises the work of Cézanne (still largely unknown in the United States), and predicts a time, soon to come, when an abstract art of pure color will supplant realism. Synchromism itself, the subject of a lengthy, adulatory chapter, is presented as that desired end-point, the culmination of the modernist struggle, surpassing the work of &quot;lesser Moderns&quot; like Kandinsky and the Futurists; at no time does the author acknowledge his own brother as one of the two originators of that school of art.

About his work in this period, Macdonald-Wright commented, &quot;I strive to divest my art of all anecdote and illustration and to purify it to the point where the emotions of the spectator will be wholly aesthetic, as when listening to good music...I cast aside as nugatory all natural representation in my art. However, I still adhered to the fundamental laws of compsiition (placements and displacements of mass, as in the human body in movement) and created my pictures by means of color-form, which, by its organization in three dimensions, resulted in rhythm.&quot;

Not long after returning to New York, Macdonald-Wright separated from Russell but both continued to work in the Synchromist style, or with Synchromist color effects, though Macdonald-Wright&#x27;s painting came to include more vestiges of representational imagery. They held another Synchromist exhibition in New York in 1916 and received significant promotion and critical support from Willard. In 1916, Willard and Stanton were key organizers of the prestigious &quot;Forum Exhibition of Modern American Painters&quot; in New York. Macdonald-Wright exhibited his work at Alfred Stieglitz&#x27;s famed 291 gallery in New York in 1917. Yet the sales and the renown that he had hoped for did not materialize, and his financial situation grew desperate.

==California and later life==
Acknowledging that he would never be able to secure a living in New York, Macdonald-Wright moved to Los Angeles in 1918. In 1920, with Stieglitz&#x27;s support, he organized the first exhibition of modern art in Los Angeles, &quot;The Exhibition of American Modernists&quot; at the Los Angeles County Museum of History, Science, and Art, showing his own large-scale abstract synchromies as well as works by John Marin, Arthur Dove, and Marsden Hartley. In 1922, he became the head of the Los Angeles Art Students League. He also became involved in local theater, serving as the director of the Santa Monica Theater Guild as well as writing and directing plays, designing sets, and acting himself.

Macdonald-Wright was a significant presence and a charismatic personality in the Los Angeles art scene for the next several decades. He was the director of the Southern California division of the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project from 1935 to 1943, and personally completed several major civic art projects, including the murals in Santa Monica City Hall. After World War II, Macdonald-Wright became interested in Japanese art and culture, which led to the renewal of synchromist elements in his work. He taught art for many years at UCLA and also kept studios in Kyoto and Florence.

By the early 1950s, Macdonald-Wright&#x27;s work had fallen into relative obscurity. A renewed interest in American modernism led to his gradual rediscovery and new scholarly attention, and he was given retrospectives at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1956, at the Smithsonian National Collection of Fine Arts in Washington, D.C. in 1967, and at the Art Galleries of UCLA in 1970. &quot;Synchromism and American Color Abstraction: 1910–1925,&quot; a 1978–1979 six-museum traveling exhibition originating at the Whitney Museum of American Art, was a watershed event in a revival of interest in Synchromism. In 2001–2002, a major Stanton Macdonald-Wright retrospective was shown at the North Carolina Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, curated by the Synchromist scholar and Macdonald-Wright biographer Will South.

Married three times, Macdonald-Wright died in Pacific Palisades, California in 1973, at the age of eighty-three. His paintings are in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the National Portrait Gallery, among other museums.

<text>Faye Marder Kellerman (born July 31, 1952) is an American writer of mystery novels, in particular the &quot;Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus&quot; series, as well as three nonseries books, &quot;The Quality of Mercy&quot;, &quot;Moon Music&quot;, and &quot;Straight into Darkness&quot;.

==Early life==
Kellerman was born in St. Louis, Missouri. She attended UCLA, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics in 1974. Four years later, she received her doctorate of dental surgery, but she has never practiced dentistry and was a housewife before publishing her first novel. In a 1997 essay, she says she cannot pinpoint the metamorphosis from dentist to writer of detective fiction, but several factors that steered her toward mystery writing were: &quot;a desire for justice, a suspicious nature, an overactive imagination, and of course, a penchant for the bizarre.&quot;

==Personal life==

Kellerman is a practicing Orthodox Jew, as are her husband and son, novelists Jonathan Kellerman and Jesse Kellerman, respectively. Her writing frequently deals with Jewish themes and characters, incorporating them into the framework of the traditional mystery. The Peter Decker books, for example, center on a police detective raised as a Southern Baptist, who returns to his Jewish roots after falling in love with Rina Lazarus, an Orthodox Jew, while investigating a rape that took place near a &quot;yeshiva&quot;.

The Kellermans are the only married couple ever to appear on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list simultaneously (for two different books). They have four children. Their youngest child, Aliza Kellerman, co-wrote &quot;Prism&quot; (2009), a young adult novel, with her mother.

==Plagiarism lawsuit==

In 1999 Kellerman sued the writers of the 1998 film &quot;Shakespeare in Love,&quot; who she claimed stole the plotline from her 1989 novel &quot;The Quality of Mercy&quot;, in which Shakespeare romances a Jewish woman who dresses as a man, and attempts to solve a murder. Miramax Films spokesman Andrew Stengel derided the claim, filed in the US District Court six days before the 1999 Academy Awards, as &quot;absurd&quot;, and argued that the timing &quot;suggests a publicity stunt&quot;. An out-of-court settlement was reached.

<doc id="256749" wikidata="Q219934" url="?curid=256749" title="Enlightened absolutism">
<text>Enlightened absolutism, also called enlightened despotism, refers to the conduct and policies of European absolute monarchs during the 18th and early 19th centuries who were influenced by the ideas of the Enlightenment, espousing them to enhance their power. The concept originated during the Enlightenment period in the 18th and into the early 19th centuries. An enlightened absolutist is a non-democratic or authoritarian leader who exercises their political power based upon the principles of the Enlightenment. Enlightened monarchs distinguished themselves from ordinary rulers by claiming to rule for their subjects&#x27; well-being. John Stuart Mill stated that despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement.

Enlightened absolutists&#x27; beliefs about royal power were typically similar to those of regular despots, both recognizing that they were destined to rule. Enlightened rulers may have played a part in the abolition of serfdom in Europe. The enlightened despotism of Emperor Joseph II of the Holy Roman Empire is summarized as &quot;Everything for the people, nothing by the people&quot;.

== History ==
Enlightened absolutism is the theme of an essay by Frederick the Great, who ruled Prussia from 1740 to 1786, defending this system of government. When the prominent French Enlightenment philosopher Voltaire fell out of favor in France, he eagerly accepted Frederick&#x27;s invitation to live at his palace. He believed that an enlightened monarchy was the only real way for society to advance. Frederick was an enthusiast of French ideas. Frederick explained: &quot;My principal occupation is to combat ignorance and prejudice ... to enlighten minds, cultivate morality, and to make people as happy as it suits human nature, and as the means at my disposal permit.&quot;

Enlightened absolutists held that royal power emanated not from divine right but from a social contract whereby a despot was entrusted with the power to govern through a social contract in lieu of any other governments. The monarchs of enlightened absolutism strengthened their authority by improving the lives of their subjects. The monarch’s taking responsibility for his subjects precluded their political participation.

The difference between an absolutist and an &quot;enlightened&quot; absolutist is based on a broad analysis of the degree to which they embraced the Age of Enlightenment. Historians debate the actual implementation of enlightened absolutism. They distinguish between the &quot;enlightenment&quot; of the ruler personally, versus that of his regime. For example, Frederick the Great was tutored in the ideas of the French Enlightenment in his youth, and maintained those ideas in his private life as an adult, but in many ways was unable or unwilling to effect enlightened reforms in practice. Other rulers such as the Marquis of Pombal, prime minister of Portugal, used the ideas and practices of the Enlightenment not only to achieve reforms but also to enhance autocracy, crush opposition, suppress criticism, advance colonial economic exploitation, and consolidate personal control and profit.

The concept of enlightened absolutism was formally described by the German historian Wilhelm Roscher in 1847 and remains controversial among scholars.

Centralized control necessitated centralized systematic information on the nation. A major renovation was the collection, use and interpretation of numerical and statistical data, ranging from trade statistics, harvest reports, death notices to population censuses. Starting in the 1760s, officials in France and Germany began increasingly to rely on quantitative data for systematic planning, especially regarding long-term economic growth. It combined the utilitarian agenda of &quot;enlightened absolutism&quot; with the new ideas being developed in economics. In Germany and France, the trend was especially strong in Cameralism and Physiocracy.

== Major nations ==
Government responses to the Age of Enlightenment varied widely. In several nations with powerful rulers, called &quot;enlightened despots&quot; by historians, leaders of the Enlightenment were welcomed at Court and helped design laws and programs to reform the system, typically to build stronger national states. In France the government was hostile, and the philosophers fought against its censorship. The British government generally ignored the Enlightenment&#x27;s leaders.

Frederick the Great, who ruled Prussia 1740–1786, was an enthusiast for French ideas (he ridiculed German culture and was unaware of the remarkable advances it was undergoing). Voltaire, who had been imprisoned and maltreated by the French government, was eager to accept Frederick&#x27;s invitation to live at his palace. Frederick explained, &quot;My principal occupation is to combat ignorance and prejudice ... to enlighten minds, cultivate morality, and to make people as happy as it suits human nature, and as the means at my disposal permit&quot;. He wrote an essay on &quot;Benevolent Despotism&quot; defending this system of government.

Empress Catherine II of Russia sponsored the Russian Enlightenment. She incorporated many ideas of Enlightenment philosophers, especially Montesquieu, in her Nakaz, which was intended to revise Russian law. However, inviting the famous French philosopher Denis Diderot to her court worked out poorly.

Charles III, King of Spain from 1759 to 1788, tried to rescue his empire from decay through far-reaching reforms such as weakening the Church and its monasteries, promoting science and university research, facilitating trade and commerce, modernizing agriculture and avoiding wars. The centralization of power in Madrid angered the local nobility, and challenged the traditional autonomy of cities, and so resistance grew steadily. Consequently, Spain relapsed after his death.

Emperor Joseph II, ruler of Austria 1780–1790, was over-enthusiastic, announcing so many reforms that had so little support that revolts broke out, and his regime became a comedy of errors.

In some countries the initiative came not from rulers but from senior officials such as the Marquis of Pombal, who was Joseph I of Portugal&#x27;s Secretary of State. For a brief period in Denmark Johann Friedrich Struensee attempted to govern in terms of Enlightenment principles. After issuing 1,069 decrees in 13 months covering many major reforms, his enemies overthrew him, and he was executed and quartered.

== Modern use ==

Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, prime minister and &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Saudi Arabia (an absolute monarchy) has been described as a modern-day enlightened despot. Since assuming power as crown prince in 2017, he has enacted widespread reforms which have reduced the power of Wahhabi clergy and religious police in a theocratic kingdom. However, Saudi Arabia remains an authoritarian state, with a poor human rights record and frequent jailing and political persecution of political dissidents.

Xuezhi Guo contrasts the Confucian ideal of a &quot;humane ruler&quot; (&quot;renjun&quot;) with the ideal of Chinese legalists, who he says &quot;intended to create a truly &#x27;enlightened ruler&#x27; (&quot;mingjun&quot;) who is able to effectively rule the masses and control his bureaucracy&quot;; this ruler would be a &quot;skillful manipulator and successful politician who uses means or &#x27;technique&#x27; in achieving self-protection and political control&quot;. Guo quotes Benjamin I. Schwartz as describing the features of &quot;a truly Legalist &#x27;enlightened ruler:He must be anything but an arbitrary despot if one means by a despot a tyrant who follows all his impulses, whims and passions. Once the systems which maintain the entire structure are in place, he must not interfere with their operation. He may use the entire system as a means to the achievement of his national and international ambitions, but to do so he must not disrupt its impersonal workings. He must at all times be able to maintain an iron wall between his private life and public role. Concubines, friends, flatterers and charismatic saints must have no influence whatsoever on the course of policy, and he must never relax his suspicions of the motives of those who surround him.

<text>The 2nd Armored Division (&quot;Hell on Wheels&quot;) was an armored division of the United States Army. The division played important roles during World War II in the invasions of Germany, North Africa, and Sicily and in the liberation of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. During the Cold War, the division was primarily based at Fort Hood, Texas, and had a reinforced brigade forward stationed in Garlstedt, West Germany. After participation in the Persian Gulf War, the division was inactivated in 1995.

==World War II==
The 2nd Armored Division was formed at Fort Benning (now Fort Moore), Georgia on 15 July 1940, by reorganizing and redesignating the Provisional Tank Brigade (the 66th Infantry Regiment (Light Tanks), 67th Infantry Regiment (Medium Tanks), and 68th Infantry Regiment (Light Tanks)). It was originally commanded by Major General Charles L. Scott, with Colonel George S. Patton Jr. in charge of training. Scott was promoted to command the I Armored Corps in November of that year, which put Patton, now a brigadier general, in command of the division. The division, which in February 1942 passed over to the command of Major General Willis D. Crittenberger, served with the First, Seventh, and Ninth Armies throughout the war.


The 2nd Armored was organized as a &quot;heavy&quot; armored division meaning it contained two armored regiments; each regiment having two medium tank battalions and one light tank battalion, with each battalion consisting of three companies (18 tank companies total). Along with the 3rd Armored Division, it retained its organization throughout World War II–the 14 other U.S. armored divisions were reorganized as &quot;light&quot; armored divisions, having three tank battalions, each consisting of three medium tank companies and one light tank company (12 tank companies total). Both types had an infantry component of three mechanized battalions, although the heavy divisions maintained an &quot;armored infantry regiment&quot; organization.

The core units of the division were the 41st Armored Infantry Regiment, the 66th Armored Regiment, the 67th Armor Regiment, the 17th Armored Engineer Battalion, the 82nd Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, and the 142nd Armored Signal Company. The 82nd Armored Reconnaissance Battalion was known as the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; of the 2nd Armored Division.

The 2nd Armored Division had three artillery battalions: (the 14th, 78th, and 92nd). The division also had support units, including the 2nd Ordnance Maintenance Battalion, 2nd Supply Battalion, the 48th Armored Medical Battalion, and a band and military police platoon. The military police and band were tasked with headquarters defense of base operations under the banner of the 502d Adjutant General Company (502d AG).

===Opened front in North Africa===
Elements of the division were among the first U.S. military to engage in offensive ground combat operations in the European and Mediterranean theater during World War II. The 2nd Armored Division, now commanded by Major General Ernest N. Harmon, served in North Africa along with the 1st Armored Division. They were part of the Western Task Force of Operation Torch, which landed at Casablanca in French Morocco on 8 November 1942. The remainder of Torch&#x27;s American component were the 1st, 3rd, 9th and 34th Infantry Divisions. However, the 2nd Armored Division did not see much action in North Africa and instead remained in French North Africa on garrison and training duties. In April 1943 Major General Harmon relinquished command of the division to Major General Hugh Joseph Gaffey. Training in amphibious operations began in preparation for an amphibious landing at Sicily.

===Operation Husky===
As the reserve force of the Western Task Force of Operation Husky, codename for the Allied invasion of Sicily, the division landed on 10 July 1943, in support of the 1st Infantry Division at the Battle of Gela. Afterwards, the division next went into action in the second landing at Licata, Sicily on 21 July following the 3rd Infantry Division&#x27;s better-known earlier landing on 10 July. The 2nd Armored, operating closely with paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division, then fought through to the Sicilian capital of Palermo. Along the way the 2nd Armored Division captured thousands of Italian prisoners of war (POWs). The fighting in Sicily came to an end on 17 August, with the 2nd Armored Division having sustained relatively light casualties in the brief campaign, where it had gained its first Medal of Honor of World War II, belonging to Sergeant Gerry H. Kisters. During the campaign the division came under the command of the U.S. Seventh Army, under Lieutenant General George S. Patton, who had been a former commander of the division.

Soon afterwards the 2nd Armored Division was sent to England, in preparation for the Allied invasion of Normandy, and remained there until June 1944. In April the division received a new commander, Major General Edward H. Brooks, a decorated veteran of World War I, replacing Major General Gaffey.

===Normandy invasion===
The 2nd Armored Division landed at Omaha Beach in Normandy on 9 June 1944, three days after the initial Normandy landings, and operated in the Cotentin Peninsula, later forming the right flank of the Operation Cobra assault. The division encircled the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich and the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division Götz von Berlichingen around Roncey, and destroyed most of their armored equipment. At La Chapelle, a 2nd SS Panzer column was attacked at point blank range by 2nd Armored Division artillery. Over the course of two hours American artillery fired over 700 rounds into the column. The Germans suffered the loss of 50 dead, 60 wounded and 197 taken prisoner; material losses included over 260 German combat vehicles destroyed. Beyond the town, the 2nd Armored engaged another column, killing 1,150 German soldiers and destroying an additional 96 armored combat vehicles and trucks. The U.S. 2nd Armored Division destroyed 64 German tanks and 538 other German combat vehicles during Operation Cobra, while itself losing 49 tanks. The 2nd Armored Division inflicted over 7,370 casualties on the Germans, while suffering 914 casualties of their own. This is approximately an eightfold disparity. The 2nd Armored blunted Operation Lüttich, the German counterattack on Avranches, then raced across France with the rest of the First Army, reaching the Albert Canal in Belgium on 8 September. On 18 September it crossed the German border near Sittard and took up defensive positions near Geilenkirchen. On 3 October, the division, now commanded again by Major General Harmon, launched an attack on the Siegfried Line from Marienberg, broke through, crossed the Wurm River, seized the town of Puffendorf on 16 November, and Barmen on 28 November.

===Rhine campaign===

Members of the division received 9,369 individual awards, including two Medals of Honor, twenty-three Distinguished Service Crosses, and 2,302 Silver Stars as well as nearly 6,000 Purple Hearts; among those receiving the Silver Star were Edward H. Brooks, Hugh Armagio, Stan Aniol, Staff Sergeant John J. Henry, William L. Giblin, Neil J. Garrison, Morton Eustis, son of William Corcoran Eustis, and Sgt Kenneth J. White. The division was twice cited by the Belgian government and division soldiers for the next 50 years wore the fourragere of the Belgian Croix de Guerre.

==Cold War and Vietnam service==
After a brief period of occupation duty, the division returned from overseas to Fort Hood, Texas, in 1946 to retrain and rebuild. The 2nd Armored Division returned to West Germany to serve as part of Seventh Army, VII Corps from 1951 to 1957. In late 1957, it rotated back to the United States as part of Operation Gyroscope, being replaced in Germany by the 4th Armored Division. Once back in the US, it returned to III Corps, Fort Hood.

While stationed in Germany in 1952 with the Seventh Army, the 2nd Armored Division was based at Stuttgart-Vaihingen under the command of General Williston Palmer. During this time, Palmer enlisted the help of a young Corporal Samuel Adler from within his ranks to organize the Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra. During the course of the next decade, the orchestra remained based with the 2nd Armored Division and the Seventh Army while supporting America&#x27;s cultural diplomacy initiatives throughout Europe during the height of the Cold War. 

The 1/50 Infantry; 2/1 Cavalry; 1/40 Field Artillery; and 1/92 Field Artillery fought in the war in Vietnam, but not the division as a whole. The division included the &quot;Fort Hood Three&quot;, a group of three enlisted men who refused to ship out when ordered to deploy to Vietnam in 1966.

The majority of the division would spend much of the next 35 years based at Fort Hood, and the division remained on active service during the Cold War. Its primary mission was to prepare to conduct heavy armored combat against Warsaw Pact forces in defense of NATO. The division formed a key component of the U.S. military&#x27;s plan to move &quot;ten divisions in ten days&quot; to Europe in the event of a Soviet threat to NATO. The division practiced this task numerous times during Exercise Reforger from 1967 to 1988. To build and maintain combat skills, the division&#x27;s maneuver brigades deployed almost annually to the National Training Center to face an opposing force modeling Soviet military weapons and tactics.

However, with the end of the Cold War, the U.S. Army began to be reduced in size. The 2nd Armored Division was scheduled for inactivation in the spring of 1990.

==2nd Armored Division (Forward)==
In 1975, the 2nd Armored Division&#x27;s third brigade forward deployed to West Germany and was assigned to NATO&#x27;s Northern Army Group (NORTHAG). The brigade received additional aviation, engineer, military intelligence, medical, and logistics support units and was additionally designated as the 2nd Armored Division (Forward). In case of conflict with the Warsaw Pact, the brigade was to either secure airfields and staging areas for the deployment of III Corps from the United States, or to deploy to the Inner German Border and establish a blocking position as part of a NATO combat force.

From 1975 through 1978, the brigade headquarters was located at Grafenwöhr, along with the rotating armor and artillery battalions and the supporting engineer and cavalry units. Two rotating infantry battalions were based at Hohenfels and Vilseck. The six-month rotations continued until 1978, immediately before the move to permanent facilities in northern Germany.
2nd Armored Division (Forward) was based at a new military facility near the village of Garlstedt just north of the city of Bremen. The facilities cost nearly $140 million to construct, half of which was paid for by the Federal Republic of Germany. The brigade had approximately 3,500 soldiers and another approximately 2,500 family dependents and civilian employees. The German government constructed family housing in the nearby city of Osterholz-Scharmbeck. In addition to troop barracks, motor pools, an indoor firing range, repair and logistics facilities, and a local training area, facilities at Garlstedt included a troop medical clinic, post exchange, library, movie theater, and a combined officer/non-commissioned officer/enlisted club. The division&#x27;s soldiers and family members received radio and TV broadcasts from The American Forces Network (AFN) – Europe via the AFN Bremerhaven affiliate station located in the nearby port city of Bremerhaven. In April 1986, a Burger King restaurant opened on the kaserne.

The brigade was officially designated as 2nd Armored Division (Forward) during ceremonies at Grafenwöhr, FRG on 25 July 1978. The Garlstedt facilities were officially turned over to the United States by the German government in October. At that time the Garlstedt kaserne (camp) was named after General Lucius D. Clay, revered by the German people for his role as the American military commander following World War II. His son, a retired U.S. Army major general, attended the ceremony.
The brigadier general in charge of 2nd Armored Division (Forward) had a unique command. In addition to command of the heavy brigade, he also functioned as the Commander, III Corps (Forward), headquartered in Maastricht, Netherlands, and as commander of all US Army forces in Northern Germany, including the military communities of Garlstedt and Bremerhaven. In the event of the deployment of III Corps and/or the 2nd Armored Division from the United States, the division commander would revert to his job as assistant division commander for operations of 2nd Armored Division. This contingency was practised during REFORGER exercises in 1980 and 1987. Brigadier generals who held the position included James E. Armstrong, George R. Stotser, Thomas H. Tait, William F. Streeter, John C. Heldstab, and Jerry R. Rutherford.

The brigade&#x27;s subordinate combat units initially consisted of the 3d Battalion, 41st Infantry; 2d Battalion, 50th Infantry; 2d Battalion, 66th Armor (Iron Knights); 1st Battalion, 14th Field Artillery, and Troop C, 2d Squadron, 1st Cavalry. In October 1983, as part of the army&#x27;s regimental alignment program, 2–50 Infantry was reflagged as 4–41 Infantry and 1–14 Field Artillery as 4-3 Field Artillery. Other brigade subordinate units eventually included the 498th Support Battalion, Company D, 17th Engineer Battalion, and the 588th Military Intelligence Company. The brigade also had a military police platoon and an aviation detachment. In 1986, under the army&#x27;s COHORT unit manning and retention plan, 3–41st Infantry returned to Fort Hood and was replaced by 1–41st Infantry. In 1987, 4–41st Infantry returned to Fort Hood, Texas and was replaced by 3–66th Armor (Burt&#x27;s Knights, named for Captain James M. Burt who was awarded the Medal of Honor as a company commander in the 66th Armored Regiment in the Battle of Aachen during World War II). Now an armor-heavy brigade, 2nd Armored Division (Forward) fielded 116 M-1A1 Abrams tanks and nearly 70 M2/3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles.

The brigade initially deployed to Germany with the M60A1 Patton tank and the M113 armored personnel carrier. 4–3rd Field Artillery had the M109 155 mm self-propelled howitzer. In 1984, 2–66th AR transitioned to the M1/IPM1/M1A1 Abrams main battle tank. In 1985, 3–41st IN and 4–41st IN transitioned to the M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle; also, C/2-1 Cavalry was replaced by an air cavalry troop, D/2-1 Cavalry, armed with AH-1S Cobra attack helicopters.

The division participated in numerous major NATO training exercises, including &quot;Trutzige Sachsen&quot; (1985), &quot;Crossed Swords&quot; (1986) and the &quot;Return of Forces to Germany&quot; (REFORGER) (1980 and 1987). Division subordinate units used the NATO gunnery and maneuver ranges at the Bergen-Hohne Training Area for gunnery and maneuver training and each year the division as a whole deployed south to Grafenwöhr and Hohenfels (both in Bavaria) training areas for annual crew and unit gunnery and maneuver qualification. 2nd Armored Division (Forward) developed a reputation for excellence during these deployments, particularly in tank crew gunnery.

Tank companies from 2–66th, and later 3–66th, Armor competed in the bi-annual NATO tank gunnery competition, the Canadian Army Trophy (CAT), as part of the NORTHAG team. C Company, 2–66th first contested for the trophy in 1983. And while a West German tank platoon won the competition that year at Bergen Hohne, 2–66th surprised the competition by performing well with its old M60A1 tanks, which used optical rangefinder technology from the World War II era. This showed the value of local course knowledge over pure technology. C Company, 2–66th contested for the trophy again in 1985, and D Company, 2–66th was part of the NORTHAG team in 1987. In 1989 C Company, 3–66th Armor won the competition outright. Participation in &quot;CAT&quot; was a source of great pride among the tank crews of 2AD (FWD).

The division had a formal partnership with Panzergrenadierbrigade 32, a Federal Republic of Germany Bundeswehr mechanized infantry brigade headquartered in nearby Schwanewede. The division also had informal relationships with Dutch, Belgian, and British NORTHAG forces, often conducting joint training activities at Bergen Hohne.

== Gulf War ==
The invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein in August 1990 caught the division in the midst of the post-Cold War drawdown of the U.S. Army. Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney had begun force reductions which meant the 2nd Brigade was in the middle of inactivating. Thus the 2nd Brigade could not be deployed as a whole. A unit of the 2nd Brigade, Battery &quot;A&quot;, 92nd Field Artillery Regiment, was attached to the 10th Marine Regiment, and others were attached to the Division&#x27;s 1st Brigade (&quot;Tiger Brigade&quot;). The 1st Brigade during the Saudi Arabia deployment was known almost exclusively as the Tiger Brigade. The Tiger Brigade, commanded by Colonel John B. Sylvester, deployed to Saudi Arabia and provided heavy armor support for United States Marine Corps forces in their attack into Kuwait. The Tiger Brigade included two battalions of the 67th Armor Regiment, the 1st and 3rd, TF 3-41 Infantry and 1st Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment. It served at the Battle of Kuwait International Airport. The Tiger Brigade was credited with destroying or capturing 181 enemy tanks, 148 APCs, 40 artillery pieces, 27 AA emplacements, and 263 Iraqi soldiers killed with an additional 4,051 captured.


The division&#x27;s 3rd brigade, based in Germany, deployed to Saudi Arabia in the fall of 1990 and acted as the third maneuver brigade of the 1st Infantry Division from Fort Riley, KS. One of the brigade&#x27;s battalion task forces, Task Force 1-41 Infantry, was the first coalition force to breach the Saudi Arabian border on 15 February 1991, and conduct ground combat operations in Iraq engaging in direct and indirect fire fights with the enemy on 17 February 1991. It was involved in a six-hour battle to clear Iraq&#x27;s initial defensive positions. Initially it was tasked with performing counter reconnaissance and reconnaissance missions against Iraqi reconnaissance units. The brigade served at the Battle of 73 Easting with the 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) along with the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment. They were responsible for destroying the Iraqi 18th Mechanized and 9th Armored Brigades of the Republican Guard Tawakalna Mechanized Infantry Division and the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division. They played a key role in the destruction of the 12th Armored Division destroying no less than 80 combat vehicles. The brigade destroyed 60 Iraqi tanks and 35 infantry vehicles along the IPSA pipeline. This is known as the Battle of Norfolk. The division&#x27;s 4-3 FA battalion played a large role in the destruction of 50 enemy tanks, 139 APCs, 30 air defense systems, 152 artillery pieces, 27 missile launchers, 108 mortars, and 548 wheeled vehicles, 61 trench lines and bunker positions, 92 dug in and open infantry targets, and 34 logistical sites during combat operations. 
Before the end of combat operations the 2nd Armored Division(Forward) would engage a total of 11 Iraqi divisions. By dawn of the third day of the ground campaign, the 2nd Armored Division (Forward) had a hand in the destruction of four Iraqi tank and mechanized brigades and two divisions. Between the cease-fire and the official end of the war in April 1991, 2nd Armored Division (Forward) took part in security operations to ensure peace in Kuwait. The division then redeployed to Saudi Arabia, where some of its soldiers established and ran three refugee camps near Raffia, Saudi Arabia. Division relief workers processed over 22,000 Iraqi refugees between 15 April and 10 May. After turning the camps over to the Saudi Arabian government, the unit redeployed to Germany.

The division&#x27;s attack helicopter battalion, 1st Battalion, 3rd Aviation Regiment, deployed from Fort Hood to Saudi Arabia in fall 1990 attached to and with support from the 1st Cavalry Division (also based at Ft. Hood). The battalion was equipped with McDonnell Douglas AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. The battalion participated in many air strikes along the border region during the air portion of the campaign. The unit provided covering missions when the ground forces advanced into Iraq. 1st Battalion, 3rd Aviation Regiment was pulled back into Saudi Arabia after the cease-fire, with two squads staging in Kuwait to provide refueling and rearming services for battalion aircraft if hostilities resumed. The unit returned to Fort Hood, Texas, in April 1991 and continued the inactivation that was interrupted when Iraq invaded Kuwait. The unit was inactivated on 16 September 1991, and the regimental flag transferred to sister unit 3rd Battalion, 3rd Aviation Regiment based in Germany. The unit was transferred as a whole to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, in August 1991 and became the 2nd Battalion of the 101st Aviation Regiment (part of the 101st Airborne Division).

== Inactivation ==
After the Gulf War the division went through a series of inactivations and reflaggings. Due to the restructuring of the U.S. Army after the end of the Cold War, the division was ordered off the active duty rolls, ending more than 50 years of continuous service. On return to Fort Hood in 1991, the Tiger Brigade and 1st Battalion of the 3rd Aviation Regiment, all that remained of the U.S.-based division, were reflagged as the 3d Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, and the 2d Battalion, 101st Aviation Regiment respectively. On 1 September 1991, 2nd Armored Division (Forward), in Germany, officially became 2nd Armored Division after main elements of 2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood inactivated. Over the summer and fall of 1992, 2nd Armored Division was inactivated. Lucius D. Clay Kaserne was turned back over to the German government and was later to become home of the German Army Logistics and Supply School (&quot;Logistikschule der Bundeswehr&quot;) as well as the seat of &quot;General der Nachschubtruppe&quot;.

In December 1992, the 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized) at Fort Polk, Louisiana, was reflagged as the 2nd Armored Division. In 1993, the unit moved to Fort Hood. In December 1995, the 2nd Armored Division was again reflagged, this time as the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized), stationed at Fort Carson, CO. This formally ended the 2nd Armored Division&#x27;s 55-year history. Several units historically associated with the 2nd Armored Division, including battalions from the 66th Armored Regiment at Fort Hood, TX, the 41st Infantry Regiment at Fort Carson, Colorado, the 1st Armored Division at Fort Bliss, Texas, and the 172nd Infantry Brigade at Grafenwöhr, Germany (inactivated 31 May 2013).

Lucius D. Clay&#x27;s name was later reused for Wiesbaden Army Airfield.

Though it was inactivated, the division was identified as the fourth highest priority inactive division in the United States Army Center of Military History&#x27;s lineage scheme due to its numerous accolades and long history. All of the division&#x27;s flags and heraldic items were moved to the National Infantry Museum at Fort Moore, Georgia following its inactivation.

<doc id="256752" wikidata="Q1349245" url="?curid=256752" title="Jonathan Kellerman">
<text>Jonathan Seth Kellerman (born August 9, 1949) is an American novelist and psychologist known for his mystery novels featuring the character Alex Delaware, a child psychologist who consults for the Los Angeles Police Department.

Born on the Lower East Side of New York City, his family relocated to Los Angeles when Jonathan was nine years old.

Kellerman graduated from the University of Southern California (USC) with a doctor of philosophy degree in psychology in 1974, and began working as a staff psychologist at the USC School of Medicine, where he eventually became a full clinical professor of pediatrics. He opened a private practice in the early 1980s while writing novels in his garage at night.
His first published novel, &quot;When the Bough Breaks&quot;, appeared in 1985, many years after writing and having works rejected. He then wrote five best-selling novels while still a practicing psychologist. In 1990, he quit his private practice to write full-time. He has written more than 40 crime novels, as well as nonfiction works and children’s books.

==Life and career==
Kellerman was born in New York City, son of David, an aerospace engineer and inventor, and Sylvia, a dancer and office manager. He attended Yeshiva of Central Queens (YCQ) before his family relocated to California. He grew up in Los Angeles and received a Bachelor of Arts in psychology at UCLA in 1971. He worked his way through college as a cartoonist, illustrator, journalist, and editor, as well as by teaching guitar. As a college senior, he co-wrote an unpublished novel that garnered a Samuel Goldwyn writing award. That prize has served as a stepping stone to film writing for other writers, but Kellerman deliberately avoided the world of screenwriting and enrolled in a PhD program in clinical psychology at USC. He received his doctoral degree in psychology from USC in 1974. His doctoral research was on attribution of blame for childhood psychopathology, and he published a scientific paper on that topic, his first, at the age of 22. He is currently a clinical professor of pediatrics at the Keck School of Medicine.

<text>WaterFire is a sculpture by Barnaby Evans presented on the rivers of downtown Providence, RI. It was first created by Evans in 1994 to celebrate the tenth anniversary of First Night Providence, and has since become a free public art installation.

WaterFire evenings consist of eighty-six burning braziers (each with approximately 33 pieces of wood); some float just above the surface of the rivers that flow through Waterplace Park (the Woonasquatucket River) and the middle of downtown Providence (the Moshassuck and Providence rivers; others are mounted on the piers of former bridges.) 
Average attendance is 40,000 a night, ranging from 10,000 to 100,000.

WaterFire is held May through November, with lightings typically on Saturday evenings once or twice a month. The rivers are tidal, so events are normally scheduled to take place when sunset coincides with an incoming high tide.

==WaterFire Providence==
WaterFire Providence is the independent 501(C)(3) non-profit arts organization responsible for presenting WaterFire. WaterFire Providence consists of about 15 staff members and relies heavily upon volunteers for the production of WaterFire. On a given night, up to 160 volunteers assist with production. 

==History==
Evans created the first WaterFire, named &quot;First Fire&quot; on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1994 as part of the tenth annual of First Night Providence. &quot;First Fire&quot; consisted of 11 braziers on steel tripods stretching from WaterPlace Basin to Steeple Street. In June 1996, Barnaby created &quot;Second Fire&quot; for the Convergence Art Festival and the International Sculpture Conference.

Through the support of volunteers, WaterFire returned as a seasonal event. WaterFire gained regional attention and a coordinated effort to fund the project began. In 1997, WaterFire expanded to 42 braziers, and had an estimated attendance of 350,000 people over the entire season. Evans received The Renaissance Award for his effort to revitalize downtown Providence, and WaterFire became the symbol of the city&#x27;s renaissance.

For the 1998 installation, WaterFire expanded to include 81 fires, with extensions up the Moshassuck River and into the basin at Waterplace Park. WaterFire now enjoys national and international renown, thanks in part to exposure on the part of PBS, of the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, and much earlier of a Style piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Likely as among both the causes and effects of the event&#x27;s broadening reputation, Rome and Singapore have been overseas scenes, joining others in different U.S. cities, of Evans-created programs that were rooted in WaterFire.

==Other locations==
* In June 1998 Barnaby Evans installed WaterFire in Houston, Texas on the Buffalo Bayou.
* In July 2005 Barnaby Evans designed a WaterFire installation in Columbus, Ohio, called WaterFire Columbus.

<doc id="256761" wikidata="Q1778103" url="?curid=256761" title="Jennings (novel series)">
<text>The Jennings series is a collection of novels written by Anthony Buckeridge (1912–2004) as children&#x27;s literature about the humorous escapades of J. C. T. Jennings, a schoolboy at Linbury Court preparatory school, located near the fictional town of Dunhambury in Sussex, England. There are 24 novels in the series, excluding reprints and other material. The first of the series, &quot;Jennings Goes to School&quot;, appeared in 1950, and new titles were published regularly until the mid-1970s (including &quot;Jennings at Large&quot;, published in 1977, the only novel to feature Jennings during the school holidays). The two final volumes were published in the 1990s: &quot;Jennings Again&quot; in 1991, and &quot;That&#x27;s Jennings&quot; in 1994. The characters were originally created for radio and appeared in a regular series on &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; from the late 1940s.

The first ten novels in the series were reprinted in the UK in paperback, by Armada Books, in the late 1960s; and many of the novels were translated from the original English into foreign languages.

==Style==
Much of the humour rests on misunderstandings attributable to Jennings&#x27;s literal-mindedness and impetuosity. In the earliest novels in the series there are some Latin puns (typically omitted from later reprints), but Buckeridge discontinued these, apparently to maximise their appeal. The earlier novels present an idealised version of rural or small-town, middle-class English life in the years between the Second World War and the social revolution of the 1960s; the later ones are still rooted in this era (as Buckeridge admitted) but reflect the changing times surprisingly well. Unlike many of his fans, Buckeridge tended to prefer his later books to his earlier ones, possibly because he was a man of the Left and had more positive political memories of the post-1964 period; when the books were reprinted in paperback in the late 1980s, he chose some of the later books for early publication ahead of those originally written in the 1950s.

The stories invented some vernacular language for the boys to use. In particular they coined the word &quot;ozard&quot;. The post-war slang &quot;wizard&quot; generally meant &quot;good&quot; or &quot;very good&quot;. &quot;Ozard&quot; derives from &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; and was used to describe anything the boys disliked or dreaded. It was also used to describe the anger of Mr. Wilkins, which could be &quot;ozard&quot;, &quot;ozard squared&quot; and occasionally &quot;ozard cubed&quot;.

==Characters==
*J. C. T. (John Christopher Timothy) Jennings – son of a businessman whose home is at Haywards Heath in the stockbroker belt. He is good-natured and well-meaning, but his tendency to act on impulse results in him frequently getting into trouble. Buckeridge told BBC reporter Michael Crick that the fictional Jennings had been modelled on a schoolfriend, Diarmaid Jennings (1913–2009).
*C. E. J. (Charles Edwin Jeremy) Darbishire – mild-mannered and short-sighted, the son of a clergyman, the Reverend Percival Darbishire, from whom he has inherited a habit of sententiously citing proverbs (generally prefixed with &quot;My father says...&quot;). Darbishire is Jennings&#x27;s right-hand man. Inherently more cautious than his best friend, he usually finds himself drawn into situations in which he would rather not be involved.
*Venables, Atkinson, Temple, Bromwich (Major) – all are classmates of Jennings in Form 3, and fellow boarders, who share Dormitory 4 with Jennings and Darbishire. Temple&#x27;s nickname was Bod, by a tortuous schoolboy logic involving his initials: CAT (Charles A Temple), was changed to DOG, then amended to &#x27;Dogsbody&#x27;, which was finally shortened to &#x27;Bod&#x27;.
*Pettigrew, Marshall – day boys in Jennings&#x27; form, whose privileges Jennings frequently &quot;borrows&quot; in order to assist him in bending school rules.
*Binns Minor, Blotwell – shrill-voiced first-formers who are treated with the condescension appropriate to their junior years by Jennings and his contemporaries.
*Mr L. P. (Lancelot Phineas) Wilkins (&quot;Old Wilkie&quot;) – Jennings&#x27;s form master, a man of limited patience and a volcanic temperament, redeemed by a hidden heart of gold at least once in every book. His catchphrases, both of them frequently uttered in order to express his anger and frustration at the boys&#x27; antics, are, &quot;Doh! You silly little boy!&quot; and &quot;...I - I - Corwumph!&quot;
*Mr Michael Carter – Jennings&#x27;s housemaster, a friendly man of great imperturbability and patience, with a phenomenal and unfortunate ability to detect dissembling and violations of school rules. Nicknamed &quot;Benedick&quot;, from his use of the Latin phrase &quot;Benedicto benedicatur&quot; (Let praise be given to the Blessed One; the second word sounding like &quot;Benedick Carter&quot;). This character was said by Buckeridge to be based on himself. Mr Carter is frequently obliged to reassure the less-understanding Old Wilkie that the boys&#x27; behaviour is not generally quite as outlandish as the latter thinks - his statement at the end of &quot;Jennings in Particular&quot; sums it up quite appropriately: &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, Wilkins. Even third-formers grow up to be people&quot;.
*Mr M. W. B. (Martin Winthrop Barlow) Pemberton-Oakes (&quot;The Archbeako&quot;) – the headmaster, a classical scholar with a capacity to command immediate discipline and frequently long-winded in his speeches, although he generally remains reserved and softly spoken, and never hesitates to deliver praise when it is due.
*Mr Hind – Music master, mild of manner (though occasionally acerbic), trailing clouds of smoke from his cherrywood pipe – also teaches art to Form 1.
*Mr Topliss – teaches shooting once a week on a shooting range behind the gymnasium.
*Matron – the school matron: she is sympathetic and understanding, but, like Mr Carter, has a keen ability to spot malingerers. She appears from &quot;Jennings&#x27; Little Hut&quot; onwards. Her predecessor, who features most prominently in &quot;Jennings Goes To School&quot;, is also kind-hearted, but less popular with the boys, as she is rather more brisk and no-nonsense in her approach and has, in Buckeridge&#x27;s words, &#x27;little sympathy with junk-filled pockets and hair that will not stay parted&#x27;.
*Miss Angela Birkenshaw (&quot;Aunt Angela&quot;) – Jennings&#x27;s absent-minded but generous aunt, who sometimes comes to visit Jennings on half-term holidays. In the book &quot;Jennings at Large&quot;, she is revealed to be a social worker.

Most of the first names of characters have been revealed (John Christopher Timothy Jennings; Charles Edwin Jeremy Darbishire; Graham Venables; Robin Atkinson; Charles Temple, etc.), but true to the form of British boarding schools, they generally are known exclusively by their surnames. Similarly, the masters generally address one another by their surnames.

Minor recurring characters:

*Hawkins (&quot;Old Nightie&quot;) – the night watchman.
*Robinson (&quot;Old Pyjamas/Old Robbo&quot;) – the oddjob man. His nickname is obviously a pun on the nightwatchman&#x27;s nickname of Old Nightie (a shortening of nightgown).
*Lieutenant General Sir Melville Merridew DSO MC Bart – retired general, the school&#x27;s most distinguished alumnus, and frequent bestower of half-holidays.
*Miss Thorpe – tireless voluntary charitable worker within the Linbury community.
*PC Herbert Honeyball – Linbury&#x27;s gruff but kind-hearted village policeman, who has more than once had wearying encounters with Jennings and his classmates.
*Mr and Mrs Lumley – She runs the local cafe and is renowned for her excellent cakes and doughnuts, while her husband is less renowned as a repairer of bicycles. Noted for the sign outside the shop: &quot;Home-made cakes and bicycles repaired&quot;.
*Mr Herbert Higgins – mild-mannered local jeweller and watch-mender.
*Farmer Jim and Mrs Arrowsmith – owners of a farm adjoining the school grounds. Both are generally easy-going and supportive of the school&#x27;s activities, but do occasionally get annoyed when their lives are adversely affected by the boys&#x27; antics.
*Dr Basil Featherstonehaugh Hipkin – an absent-minded zoologist who meets Jennings and Darbishire when they accidentally push him into the river while they are on an illicit boating expedition.
*Mrs Amanda Hipkin – Dr Hipkin&#x27;s formidable but kind-hearted wife.
*Miss Margaret Wilkins – Old Wilkie&#x27;s pleasant and attractive younger sister, a London-based nurse, who occasionally visits her brother and nearly always has him wrapped round her little finger, especially when she needs him to look after her Siamese kitten, Pyewacket.
*Mr Arthur Jennings – Jennings&#x27;s kindly and jovial uncle, who appears in &#x27;Our Friend Jennings&#x27; and treats both Jennings and Darbishire to a memorable meal involving lots of baked beans in between courses, but is unfortunately too busy to stay long beyond that.
*George the Third – Matron&#x27;s cat, a large ginger tom.
*Mrs Caffey – Linbury Court&#x27;s housekeeper; pronounced Café, hence nicknamed &quot;Mother Snackbar&quot;.
*Mrs Connie Hackett – the school&#x27;s feisty part-time kitchen assistant.
*Mr &#x27;Pinky&#x27; Parkinson – mild-mannered sports teacher at the nearby Bracebridge School; Linbury Court frequently play Bracebridge in football matches.
*Mr &#x27;Foxy Type&#x27; Fox – a notoriously strict and hatchet-faced teacher, who is also at Bracebridge.

==List of novels==
==Radio==
Jennings and his friends originally appeared on radio, the first play appearing on &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; on the BBC Home Service in 1948. The early books were largely based on the radio scripts. The signature tune was &quot;The Old Clockmaker&quot; by Charles Williams. &quot;Jennings Goes to School&quot; and &quot;Jennings Again!&quot; were adapted for radio by Anthony Buckeridge, and read by Stephen Fry. The adaptations were released on audio cassette in 1991. &quot;Jennings&#x27; Little Hut&quot; was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2010, narrated by Mark Williams.

==Television==
There have been two BBC TV series based on the books, &quot;Jennings at School&quot;, which ran for ten thirty-minute episodes between 6 September and 8 November 1958, and &quot;Jennings&quot;, which ran for six episodes between 5 September and 10 October 1966. Jennings was played by John Mitchell in the first series, and by David Schulten in the second. No episodes of either series are known to have survived in the BBC archives or elsewhere.

John Mitchell later found fame as Mitch Mitchell, drummer in The Jimi Hendrix Experience.

== Stage adaptation ==
In 1980, there was a stage play called Jennings Abounding! (not based on the novel of that title) aimed at the schools market. Described as a comedy with music, with book and lyrics by Anthony Buckeridge, music by Hector Cortes and William Gomez, and additional music and arrangement by Nigel Carver.

==Foreign versions==
The novels proved popular in other countries; in Germany Jennings is Fredy, and in France he became Bennett. Jennings was especially popular in Norway, where the main character became Stompa and the novels were rewritten with Norwegian locations. There was also a series of Norwegian film adaptations directed by Nils Reinhardt Christensen.

<doc id="256762" wikidata="Q371207" url="?curid=256762" title="Columbo">
<text>Columbo is an American crime drama television series starring Peter Falk as Lieutenant Columbo, a homicide detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. After two pilot episodes in 1968 and 1971, the show originally aired on NBC from 1971 to 1978 as one of the rotating programs of &quot;The NBC Mystery Movie&quot;. &quot;Columbo&quot; then aired on ABC as a rotating program on &quot;The ABC Mystery Movie&quot; from 1989 to 1990, and on a less frequent basis from 1990 to 2003.

Columbo is a shrewd and exceptionally observant homicide detective whose trademarks include his rumpled beige raincoat, unassuming demeanor, cigar, old Peugeot 403 car, love of chili, and unseen wife (whom he mentions frequently). He often leaves a room only to return with the catchphrase &quot;Just one more thing&quot; to ask a critical question.

The character and show, created by Richard Levinson and William Link, popularized the inverted detective story format (sometimes referred to as a &quot;howcatchem&quot;). This genre begins by showing the commission of the crime and its perpetrator; the plot therefore usually has no &quot;whodunit&quot; element of determining which of several suspects committed the crime. It instead revolves around how a perpetrator known to the audience will finally be caught and exposed. The clues Columbo finds to help him solve the case are sometimes revealed to the audience beforehand, but often not until the episode&#x27;s end.

The series&#x27; homicide suspects are often affluent members of high society; it has led some critics to see class conflict as an element of each story. Suspects carefully cover their tracks and are initially dismissive of Columbo&#x27;s circumstantial speech and apparent ineptitude. They become increasingly unsettled as his superficially pestering behavior teases out incriminating evidence. His relentless approach often leads to self-incrimination or outright confession.

Episodes of &quot;Columbo&quot; are between 70 and 98 minutes long, and they have been broadcast in 44 countries. The show has been described by the BBC as &quot;timeless&quot; and remains popular today.
==Episodes==



After two pilot episodes, the show originally aired on NBC from 1971 to 1978 as one of the rotating programs of &quot;The NBC Mystery Movie&quot;. &quot;Columbo&quot; then aired on ABC under the umbrella of &quot;The ABC Mystery Movie&quot; from 1989 to 1990. After &quot;The ABC Mystery Movie&quot; was canceled, &quot;Columbo&quot; episodes continued to premiere on ABC on a less frequent basis; the last episode was broadcast in 2003 as part of &quot;ABC Thursday Night at the Movies&quot;.

In almost every episode, the audience sees the crime unfold at the beginning and knows the identity of the culprit, typically an affluent member of society. Once Columbo enters the story (he rarely appears in the first act), viewers watch him solve the case by sifting through the contradictions between the truth and the version presented to him by the killer(s). This style of mystery is sometimes referred to as a &quot;howcatchem&quot;, in contrast to the traditional whodunit. In structural analysis terms, the majority of the narrative is therefore dénouement, a feature normally reserved for the very end of a story. Episodes tend to be driven by their characters, the audience observing the criminal&#x27;s reactions to Columbo&#x27;s increasingly intrusive presence.

When Columbo first appears in an episode, his genius is hidden from the viewer by his frumpy, friendly, and disarming demeanor. While the details, and eventually the motivations, of the murderers&#x27; actions are always shown to the viewer, Columbo&#x27;s true thoughts and intentions are sometimes concealed until the end of the episode. He occasionally begins to whistle the tune &quot;This Old Man&quot; as the pieces begin to fall into place.

Columbo generally maintains a friendly relationship with the murderer until the end, and sometimes even after their confession or incrimination, despite both characters being aware of their adversarial positions. The detective usually suspects the murderer within moments of their meeting, or even earlier, often based on their reaction to the news of the victim&#x27;s death. The murderer in turn almost always immediately sees through Columbo&#x27;s scruffy and absent-minded manner to his underlying investigative intellect, and accordingly takes steps to divert his efforts by disguising evidence, manipulating witnesses, manufacturing evidence to lead Columbo towards a different suspect, and/or feigning irritation as an excuse for declining requests for searches and interrogations. In some cases the murderer will even taunt Columbo over his inability to prove their guilt. There are two sides to Columbo&#x27;s character: the disarming and unkempt detective and the hidden genius sleuth. The genius sometimes starkly manifests itself through his eyes, as when the magician The Great Santini escapes from police handcuffs that Columbo coyly presents him during Santini&#x27;s show (&quot;Now You See Him...&quot;). In some instances, such as the avenging elderly mystery writer in &quot;Try and Catch Me&quot; and the terminally ill and deluded actress in &quot;Forgotten Lady&quot;, many viewers find the killer more sympathetic than the victim.

Each episode is generally concluded with Columbo proving the killer&#x27;s guilt, though some episodes, such as &quot;Swan Song&quot;, go on to show the killer confessing or quietly submitting to arrest. There are few attempts to deceive the viewer or provide a twist in the tale. One exception is &quot;Last Salute to the Commodore&quot;, where Robert Vaughn is seen elaborately disposing of a body, but is proved later to have been covering for his alcoholic wife, whom he mistakenly thought to be the murderer. Sometimes, Columbo sets up the murderer with a trick designed to elicit a confession. An example occurs in &quot;Dagger of the Mind&quot;, in which Columbo flips an evidentiary pearl into the victim&#x27;s umbrella, bringing about incriminating activity from Nicholas Frame and Lillian Stanhope.

==Development and character profile==


The character of Columbo was created by the writing team of Richard Levinson and William Link, who said that Columbo was partially inspired by Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; character Porfiry Petrovich, as well as G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s humble cleric-detective Father Brown. Other sources claim Columbo&#x27;s character is also influenced by Inspector Fichet from the French suspense-thriller film &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; (1955).

The character first appeared in a 1960 episode of the television-anthology series &quot;The Chevy Mystery Show&quot;, titled &quot;Enough Rope&quot;. This was adapted by Levinson and Link from their short story &quot;May I Come In&quot;, which had been published as &quot;Dear Corpus Delicti&quot; in the March 1960 issue of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;. The short story featured a police lieutenant then named Fisher. The first actor to portray Columbo, character actor Bert Freed, was a stocky character actor with a thatch of gray hair.

Freed&#x27;s Columbo wore a rumpled suit and smoked a cigar; he otherwise had few of the other now-familiar Columbo mannerisms. The character is still recognizably Columbo and uses some of the same methods of misdirecting and distracting his suspects. During the course of the show, the increasingly frightened murderer brings pressure from the district attorney&#x27;s office to have Columbo taken off the case, but the detective fights back with his own contacts.

Although Freed received third billing, he wound up with almost as much screen time as the killer and appeared immediately after the first commercial. This delayed entry of the character into the narrative of the screenplay became a defining characteristic of the structure of the Columbo series. This teleplay is available for viewing in the archives of the Paley Center for Media in New York City and the Beverly Hills Public Library in Los Angeles.

Levinson and Link then adapted the TV drama into the stage play &quot;Prescription: Murder&quot;. This was first performed at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco on January 2, 1962, with Oscar-winning character actor Thomas Mitchell in the role of Columbo. Mitchell was 70 years old at the time. The stage production starred Joseph Cotten as the murderer and Agnes Moorehead as the victim. Mitchell died of cancer while the play was touring in out-of-town tryouts; Columbo was his last role.

In 1968, the same play was made into a two-hour television movie that aired on NBC. The writers suggested Lee J. Cobb and Bing Crosby for the role of Columbo, but Cobb was unavailable and Crosby turned it down because he felt it would take too much time away from golf. Director Richard Irving convinced Levinson and Link that Falk, who excitedly said he &quot;would kill to play that cop&quot;, could pull it off even though he was much younger than the writers had in mind.

Originally a one-off movie of the week, &quot;Prescription: Murder&quot; has Falk&#x27;s Columbo pitted against a psychiatrist (Gene Barry). In this movie, the psychiatrist gives the new audience a perfect description of Columbo&#x27;s character. Due to the success of this film, NBC requested that a pilot for a potential series be made to see if the character could be sustained on a regular basis, leading to the 1971 ninety-minute television production, &quot;Ransom for a Dead Man&quot;, with Lee Grant playing the killer. The popularity of the second film prompted the creation of a regular series on NBC, that premiered in September 1971 as part of &quot;The NBC Mystery Movie&quot; wheel series rotation: &quot;McCloud&quot;, &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;, and other whodunits.

According to &quot;TV Guide&quot;, the original plan was that a new &quot;Columbo&quot; episode would air every week. However, Falk refused to commit to such a busy schedule given his steady work in motion pictures. The network arranged for the &quot;Columbo&quot; segments to air once a month on Wednesday nights. The high quality of &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;, and &quot;McCloud&quot; was due in large part to the extra time spent on each episode. The term &quot;wheel show&quot; had been previously coined to describe this format, but no previous or subsequent wheel show achieved the longevity or success of &quot;The NBC Mystery Movie&quot;.

&quot;Columbo&quot; was an immediate hit in the Nielsen ratings and Falk won an Emmy Award for his role in the show&#x27;s first season. In its second year the &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; series was moved to Sunday nights, where it then remained during its seven-season run. The show became the anchor of NBC&#x27;s Sunday night lineup. &quot;Columbo&quot; aired regularly from 1971 to 1978. After NBC canceled it in 1978, &quot;Columbo&quot; was revived on ABC between 1989 and 2003 for two seasons as part of &quot;The ABC Mystery Movie&quot; followed by 14 made-for-TV movie &quot;specials&quot;.

Columbo&#x27;s wardrobe was provided by Falk; they were his clothes, including the high-topped shoes and the shabby raincoat, which made its first appearance in &quot;Prescription: Murder&quot;. Falk said of the raincoat, &quot;I just felt comfortable in it.&quot; Falk often ad libbed his character&#x27;s idiosyncrasies (fumbling through his pockets for a piece of evidence and discovering a grocery list, asking to borrow a pencil, becoming distracted by something irrelevant in the room at a dramatic point in a conversation with a suspect, etc.), inserting these into his performance as a way to keep his fellow actors off-balance. He felt it helped to make their confused and impatient reactions to Columbo&#x27;s antics more genuine. According to Levinson, the catchphrase &quot;one more thing&quot; was conceived when he and Link were writing the play: &quot;we had a scene that was too short, and we had already had Columbo make his exit. We were too lazy to retype the scene, so we had him come back and say, &#x27;Oh, just one more thing.&#x27; It was never planned.&quot;

A few years before his death, Falk expressed interest in returning to the role. In 2007, he claimed he had chosen a script for one last Columbo episode, &quot;Columbo: Hear No Evil&quot;. The script was renamed &quot;Columbo&#x27;s Last Case&quot;. ABC declined the project. In response, producers for the series announced that they were attempting to shop the project to foreign production companies. Falk was diagnosed with dementia in late 2007. During a 2009 trial over his care, physician Stephen Read stated that Falk&#x27;s condition had deteriorated so badly that he could no longer remember playing a character named Columbo, nor could he identify Columbo. Falk died on June 23, 2011, aged 83.

== Contributors ==
=== Guest stars ===
The series featured many guest stars as murderers and in other roles.

Some actors appeared more than once, playing a different character each time. Among those actors are Jack Cassidy, Robert Culp, Tyne Daly, Shera Danese, George Hamilton, Patrick McGoohan, Ray Milland, Leslie Nielsen, Tim O&#x27;Connor, Dean Stockwell and William Shatner.

=== Directors and writers ===

The first season première &quot;Murder by the Book&quot; was written by Steven Bochco and directed by Steven Spielberg. Jonathan Demme directed the seventh-season episode &quot;Murder Under Glass&quot;. Jonathan Latimer was also a writer. Actor Ben Gazzara, a friend of Falk&#x27;s, directed the episodes &quot;A Friend in Deed&quot; (1974) and &quot;Troubled Waters&quot; (1975).

Falk himself directed the last episode of the first season, &quot;Blueprint for Murder,&quot; and wrote the episode entitled &quot;It&#x27;s All in the Game&quot; in season 10. Actor Nicholas Colasanto, best known for playing Coach on &quot;Cheers&quot;, directed two episodes, &quot;Swan Song&quot; with Johnny Cash, and &quot;Étude in Black&quot;.

Patrick McGoohan directed five episodes (including three of the four in which he played the murderer) and wrote and produced two. Vincent McEveety was a frequent director, and homage was paid to him by a humorous mention of a character with his surname in the episode &quot;Undercover&quot; (which he directed).

Two episodes, &quot;No Time to Die&quot; and &quot;Undercover&quot;, were based on the 87th Precinct novels by Ed McBain, and thus do not strictly follow the standard Columbo/inverted detective story format.

=== Score composers ===
&quot;Columbo&quot; episodes contain a variety of music that contributes to the uniqueness of each. The score becomes of particular importance during turning points of the plots. &quot;The Mystery Movie Theme&quot; by Henry Mancini, written for &quot;The NBC Mystery Movie&quot; series, was used extensively in the whole of 38 episodes, from 1971 to 1977. Unlike the other elements of the &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; wheel, &quot;Columbo&quot; never had an official theme as such, although some composers, such as Dick DeBenedictis and Gil Mellé, did write their own signature pieces. Several composers created original music for the series, which was often used along with &quot;The Mystery Movie Theme&quot;:

* Dick DeBenedictis (23 episodes, 1972–2003)
* Patrick Williams (9 episodes, 1977–1992)
* Bernardo Segall (10 episodes, 1974–1976)
* Billy Goldenberg (7 episodes, 1971–1974)
* Gil Mellé (4 episodes, 1971–1972)

Patrick Williams received two Emmys nominations for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series in 1978 (for &quot;Try and Catch Me&quot;) and 1989 (for &quot;Murder, Smoke and Shadows&quot;). Billy Goldenberg was nominated in the same category in 1972 for &quot;Lady in Waiting&quot;.

&quot;Columbo&quot; also featured an unofficial signature tune, the British children&#x27;s song &quot;This Old Man&quot;. It was introduced in the episode &quot;Any Old Port in a Storm&quot; in 1973 and the detective can be heard humming or whistling it often in subsequent films. Falk said it was a melody he personally enjoyed and one day it became a part of his character. The tune was also used in various score arrangements throughout the three decades of the series, including opening and closing credits. A version of it, titled &quot;Columbo&quot;, was created by Patrick Williams.

==Reception==

=== Awards and nominations ===
&quot;Columbo&quot; received numerous awards and nominations from 1971 to 2005, including 13 Emmys, two Golden Globe Awards, two Edgar Awards and a TV Land Award nomination in 2005 for Peter Falk.

The 1971 episode &quot;Murder by the Book&quot;, directed by Steven Spielberg, was ranked No. 16 on &quot;TV Guide&#x27;s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time&quot; and in 1999, the magazine ranked Lt. Columbo No. 7 on its 50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time list. In 2012, the program was ranked the third-best cop or legal show on &quot;Best in TV: The Greatest TV Shows of Our Time&quot;. In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; included it in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time and ranked it 33rd on its list of the 60 Best Series. Also in 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked it 57th on its list of 101 Best Written TV Series. In December 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;Columbo&quot; #85 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.

===International reception===

&quot;Columbo&quot; was an international success during its initial run and was syndicated in 44 countries.

According to a 1989 article in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, when production of &quot;Columbo&quot; stopped and no new episodes could be broadcast in Romania, the government feared that riots could break out, and Falk was asked by the U.S. State Department to record a special announcement to be broadcast on Romanian television. The story was repeated by Falk in an appearance on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in 1995, and in Falk&#x27;s memoir &quot;Just One More Thing&quot;. While the cable containing Falk&#x27;s speech was released as part of the United States diplomatic cables leak, it is disputed whether riots or any kind of mass protest were imminent due to the cancellation of &quot;Columbo&quot;.

A statue of Lieutenant Columbo and his dog was unveiled in 2014 on Miksa Falk Street in Budapest, Hungary. According to Antal Rogán, then-district mayor of the city, Peter Falk may have been related to Hungarian writer and politician Miksa Falk, although there is no evidence yet to prove it.

===Renewed popularity in 2020s===
In the 2020s, the renewed popularity of &quot;Columbo&quot; with much younger audiences has been noted by several media publications. &quot;Collider&quot; and the BBC emphasized the timeless nature of Peter Falk&#x27;s performance. &quot;GameRant&quot; suggested that the show is &quot;comfort viewing&quot; and that its repetitive nature easily engenders Internet memes.

==Home media==
===VHS===
On August 3, 1994, MCA/Universal Home Video released the episode &quot;Murder by the Book&quot; on VHS.

===DVD===
As of January 10, 2012, Universal Studios had released all 69 episodes of &quot;Columbo&quot; on DVD. The episodes are released in the same chronological order as they were originally broadcast. On October 16, 2012, Universal released &quot;Columbo—The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

Because the &quot;Columbo&quot; episodes from 1989 to 2003 were aired very infrequently, different DVD sets have been released around the world. In many Region 2 and Region 4 countries, all episodes have now been released as 10 seasons, with the 10th comprising the last 14 episodes, from &quot;Columbo Goes to College&quot; (1990) to &quot;Columbo Likes the Nightlife&quot; (2003). In France and The Netherlands (also Region 2), the DVDs were grouped differently and released as 12 seasons.

In Region 1, all episodes from seasons 8 on are grouped differently; the episodes that originally aired on ABC were released under the title &quot;COLUMBO: The Mystery Movie Collection&quot;.

===Blu-ray===

The complete series was released on Blu-ray in Japan in 2011 as a ten-season set, taken from new HD masters and original 1.33:1 (4:3) aspect ratio, apart from the 1989–2003 episodes presented in 1.78:1 (16:9)). The set contains 35 discs and is presented in a faux-wooden cigar box. It features a brochure with episode details, and a script for the Japanese version of Prescription: Murder. Special features include the original 96-minute version of Étude In Black and the original NBC Mystery Movie title sequence. In addition, many episodes include isolated music and sound-effects tracks. Before this set&#x27;s release, only the episodes up to Murder, a Self-Portrait were released on DVD in Japan.

In late 2023, specialist film distributor Kino Lorber released the first 7 seasons of Columbo on Blu-ray in North America, using an NBCUniversal remaster. Although it was planned that the Blu-ray would have a commentary track for each episode, it was later cancelled for unexplained reasons. In mid-2024, Kino Lorber released a Blu-ray set of the remaining seasons in North America.

== Other appearances ==

=== Stage ===

The Columbo character first appeared on stage in 1962 in &quot;Prescription: Murder&quot; with Thomas Mitchell in the role of Columbo.

In 2010, &quot;Prescription: Murder&quot; was revived for a tour of the United Kingdom with Dirk Benedict and later John Guerrasio as Columbo.

=== Television ===
Falk appeared as Columbo in an &quot;Alias&quot; sketch produced for a 2003 TV special celebrating the 50th anniversary of ABC.

Falk appeared in character as Columbo in 1977 at &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot; of Frank Sinatra.

=== Cinema ===
While Falk generally appeared as himself in Wim Wenders&#x27;s 1987 movie (&quot;Wings of Desire&quot;), there is also a short cameo appearance in the film where Falk is specifically recognized and greeted as &quot;Columbo&quot; by a couple of bywalkers.

=== Books ===

A &quot;Columbo&quot; series of books was published by MCA Publishing, written by authors Alfred Lawrence, Henry Clements and Lee Hays. This series of books, with the first title published in 1972, was mostly adapted from the TV series.

Columbo was also used as the protagonist for a series of novels published between 1994 and 1999 by Forge Books, an imprint of Tor Books. All of these books were written by William Harrington.

William Link, the co-creator of the series, wrote a collection of Columbo short stories, titled &quot;The Columbo Collection&quot;, which was published in May 2010 by Crippen &amp; Landru, a specialty mystery publisher.

== &quot;Mrs. Columbo&quot; spin-off ==

&quot;Mrs. Columbo&quot;, a spin-off TV series starring Kate Mulgrew, aired in 1979 and was canceled after only thirteen episodes. Lt. Columbo was never seen on &quot;Mrs. Columbo&quot;; each episode featured the resourceful Mrs. Columbo, here given the first name Kate, solving a murder mystery she encountered in her work as a newspaper reporter. Connections with the original &quot;Columbo&quot; series were made obvious: the glaring presence of Columbo&#x27;s car in the driveway, the dog and Mrs. Columbo emptying ashtrays containing the famous green cigar butts—all featured in the show&#x27;s opening sequence. References were also made to Kate&#x27;s husband being a police lieutenant. The public didn&#x27;t warm to this interpretation of the character, and several episodes into the series, all &quot;Columbo&quot; references were abruptly dropped. The show&#x27;s title became &quot;Kate Loves A Mystery&quot;, Kate&#x27;s last name became Callahan, and she was no longer married to a police lieutenant.

==&quot;The Trivia Encyclopedia&quot; lawsuit ==
Columbo&#x27;s first name is notably never mentioned in the series, but &quot;Frank Columbo&quot; or &quot;Lt. Frank Columbo&quot; can occasionally be seen in passing on his police ID (though this was not generally evident to viewers until the advent of DVDs, which could be freeze-framed to present a sharp image of the ID badge). This ambiguity surrounding Columbo&#x27;s first name led the creator of &quot;The Trivia Encyclopedia&quot;, Fred L. Worth, to include a false entry that listed &quot;Philip Columbo&quot; as Columbo&#x27;s full name as a copyright trap. When the board game &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; included &quot;Philip&quot; as the answer to the question, &quot;What was Columbo&#x27;s first name?&quot;, Worth launched a $300 million lawsuit against the creators of the game. The creators of the game argued that while they did use &quot;The Trivia Encyclopedia&quot; as one of their sources, facts are not copyrightable and there was nothing improper about using an encyclopedia in the production of a fact-based game. The district court judge agreed and the decision was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in September 1987. Worth petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States to review the case, but the Court declined, denying certiorari in March 1988.
