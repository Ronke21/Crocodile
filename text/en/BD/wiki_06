<doc id="255904" wikidata="Q1404923" url="?curid=255904" title="Reticulocyte">
<text>In hematology, reticulocytes are immature red blood cells (RBCs). In the process of erythropoiesis (red blood cell formation), reticulocytes develop and mature in the bone marrow and then circulate for about a day in the blood stream before developing into mature red blood cells. Like mature red blood cells, in mammals, reticulocytes do not have a cell nucleus. They are called reticulocytes because of a reticular (mesh-like) network of ribosomal RNA that becomes visible under a microscope with certain stains such as new methylene blue and Romanowsky stain.

==Clinical significance==
To accurately measure reticulocyte counts, automated counters use a combination of laser excitation, detectors and a fluorescent dye that marks RNA and DNA (such as titan yellow or polymethine). 

Reticulocytes appear slightly bluer than other red cells when looked at with the normal Romanowsky stain. Reticulocytes are also relatively large, a characteristic that is described by the mean corpuscular volume.

The normal fraction of reticulocytes in the blood depends on the clinical situation but is usually 0.5% to 2.5% in adults and 2% to 6% in infants. A reticulocyte percentage that is higher than &quot;normal&quot; can be a sign of anemia, but this depends on the health of a person&#x27;s bone marrow. Calculating the reticulocyte production index is an important step in understanding whether or not the reticulocyte count is appropriate to the situation. This is often a more important question than whether the percentage is in the normal range; for instance, if someone is anemic but has a reticulocyte percentage of only 1%, the bone marrow is likely not producing new blood cells at a rate that will correct the anemia.

===Immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF)===
Reticulocytes at less mature levels can be detected by having higher intensity fluorescence regions. An increased immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF), specifically an IRF more than or equal to 0.23, together with an increased absolute reticulocyte count, generally indicates an adequate erythroid response to anemia. An IRF of more than 0.23 but a subnormal or normal absolute reticulocyte count (with a corresponding reticulocyte production index of less than or equal to 2) is seen in for example acute infection, iron deficiency anemia, human immunodeficiency virus infection, sickle disease with crisis, pregnancy, and myelodysplastic syndrome. An IRF of less than 0.23 is seen in diseases that lead to decreased erythropoietic activity, predominantly chronic renal insufficiency.

==Development==
The development begins with the expulsion of the normoblast nucleus, and is followed by loss of organelles and remodeling of the plasma membrane, giving rise to an erythrocyte.

==Research==
Reticulocytes are a valuable tool for biologists who study protein translation. Reticulocytes are unusual among cells in that they contain all of the machinery necessary to translate proteins but lack a nucleus. Since a cell&#x27;s nucleus contains many components that make studying translation difficult, these cells are quite useful. Scientists can collect reticulocytes from animals such as rabbits and extract the mRNA and translation enzymes to study protein translation in a cell-free, in vitro system, allowing greater control over the environment in which proteins are being synthesized.

<text>Agares (also Agarus, Agarat) is a demon described in demonological grimoires.

==Description==
Agaras is described in grimoires such as the &quot;Livre des Esperitz&quot; (as Agarat), the &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot;, the &quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;, and the &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot; as a duke &quot;under the power of the east,&quot; an &quot;old man, riding upon a crocodile, and carrying a hawk on his fist,&quot; who teaches languages, stops and retrieves runaway persons, causes earthquakes, and grants noble titles.

==Legions and standing==
&quot;Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis&quot; and the &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; both list him as the second spirit, and state that he commands 31 legions of demons, while the &quot;Livre des Esperitz&quot; (which describes him simply as an old man) gives him 36.

The &quot;Book of the Office of Spirits&quot; places him (as Agaros) second under Oriens and describes him as an old man riding a cockatrice, without the hawk. &quot;The Grimoire of Pope Honorius&quot; (which refers to him as Agarus) is more brief, omitting the crocodile and hawk, and omitting his functions beyond languages and titles. The &quot;Grand Grimoire&quot; features him as a subordinate of Lucifuge Rofocale. According to Thomas Rudd, Agares is opposed by the Shemhamphorasch angel Jelial. Sloane MS 3824 mentions Agares throughout in invocations to summon spirits that guard treasure, and in the &quot;Experiment of Agares,&quot; meant to draw him into a crystal.

== Popular Culture ==
Agares possesses a young nun named Sister Adelina Marinescu (played by Ada Lupa) in the 2017 film, The Crucifixion, directed by Xavier Gens. The film is inspired by the 2005 Tanacu exorcism of Sister Maricica Irina Cornici in Romania.

Agares is portrayed under the same name as a sleepy young man in Japanese anime and manga series Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun.

Agares is also depicted in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game Monster Card &quot;Number 60: Dugares the Timeless&quot;.

<text>In demonology, Halphas (listed in Skinner &amp; Rankine&#x27;s edition as &quot;Malthas&quot;, and in the Crowley/Mathers edition as &quot;Halphas&quot;, &quot;Malthus&quot;, or &quot;Malphas&quot;) is the thirty-eighth demon in the &quot;Ars Goetia&quot; in the &quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; (forty-third in Johann Weyer&#x27;s Pseudomonarchia Daemonum), ranked as an earl.

Most manuscripts describe Halphas as a hoarse-voiced stock dove (though Weyer and Collin de Plancy&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot; describe him as a stork), who supplies weapons and ammunition for towers (Weyer and de Plancy have &quot;towns&quot; or &quot;villes&quot; instead), sends men to war, and commands 26 legions of spirits.

According to Skinner &amp; Rankine, Halphas is opposed by the Shemhamphorasch angel Haamiah.

<doc id="255909" wikidata="Q652855" url="?curid=255909" title="Amaymon">
<text>In demonology, Amaymon (also Amaimon, or Amoymon) is a prince of Hell, and, according to some grimoires, the only one who has power over Asmodai.

A curious characteristic of this spirit is alleged in almost all copies of the Ars Goetia in English, that during the evocation of Asmodai to visible appearance, the exorcist must stand upright with his cap or headdress removed in a show of respect, because if he does not do so, then Amaymon will deceive him and doom all of his work. According to Joseph H. Peterson, editor of &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; (Weiser 2001) this is a &quot;bizarre translation of &#x27;si vero coopertus fuerit&#x27;&quot; (Page 21 Footnote 57) by Scot in his &quot;Discoverie of Witchcraft&quot; which contains a translation by Scot of Pseudomonarchia Daemonum by Johannes Weyer. Peterson&#x27;s edition includes as an appendix, a copy of Weyer&#x27;s Pseudomonarchia Daemonum in the original Latin where we find (Page 242) &quot;Cum hujus officia exercet exorcista, fit fortis, cautus &amp; in pedibus stans: si vero coopertus fuerit, ut in omnibus detegatur, efficiet: Quod si non fecerit exorcista, ab Amaymone in cunctis decipietur&quot; which translates to &quot;When the exorcist performs his offices, he should be strong, cautious and standing on his feet: if he will be truly overwhelmed he will bring it about that in all things he is unprotected: But if the exorcist does not, by Amaymon he will be deceived in whole.&quot;

In the original text by Johannes Weyer, there is nothing about taking off caps or headdresses when evoking Asmodeus. The curious characteristic replicated in every known English text of the Ars Goetia seems to arise from laziness on the part of Scot and generations of scribes replicating the English text without checking the original Latin.

Amaymon is said to have a deadly poisonous breath. &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; states that the exorcist or conjurer must be in possession of a silver ring, that is duly consecrated and worn on the middle finger, as a form of protection against this poisonous astral breath.

According to &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; and &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon,&quot; Amaymon is the king of the east, while in the &quot;Liber Officiorum Spirituum&quot; and the 18th century grimoire &quot;Clavis Inferni&quot; he is stated to be the king of the south.

In &quot;The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage&quot;, translated by S.L. MacGregor Mathers, Amaymon (as Amaimon) is still the king of the south and also one of the eight sub-princes, described as an Egyptian devil, who Abramelin restrained from working evil from the third hour until noon and from the ninth hour until evening.

== In popular culture ==

<doc id="255912" wikidata="Q849242" url="?curid=255912" title="Hereditary monarchy">
<text>A hereditary monarchy is a form of government and succession of power in which the throne passes from one member of a ruling family to another member of the same family. A series of rulers from the same family would constitute a dynasty. It is historically the most common type of monarchy and remains the dominant form in extant monarchies. It has the advantages of continuity of the concentration of power and wealth and predictability of who one can expect to control the means of governance and patronage. Provided that a monarch is competent, not oppressive, and maintains an appropriate dignity, it might also offer the stabilizing factors of popular affection for and loyalty to a ruling family. The adjudication of what constitutes oppressive, dignified and popular tends to remain in the purview of the monarch. A major disadvantage of hereditary monarchy arises when the heir apparent may be physically or temperamentally unfit to rule. Other disadvantages include the inability of a people to choose their head of state, the ossified distribution of wealth and power across a broad spectrum of society, and the continuation of outmoded religious and social-economic structures mainly for the benefit of monarchs, their families, and supporters.

In most extant hereditary monarchies, the typical order of succession uses some form of primogeniture, but there exist other methods such as seniority and tanistry (in which an heir-apparent is nominated from among qualified candidates). Research shows that hereditary regimes, in particular primogeniture, are more stable than forms of authoritarian rule with alternative succession arrangements.

==Succession==
Theoretically, when the monarch of a hereditary monarchy dies or abdicates, the crown typically passes to the next generation of the family. If no qualified child exists, the crown may pass to a brother, sister, nephew, niece, cousin, or other relative, in accordance with a predefined order of succession, often enshrined in legislation. Such a process establishes who will be the next monarch beforehand and avoids disputes among members of the royal family. Usurpers may resort to inventing semi-mythical genealogies to bolster their respectability.

Historically, there have been differences in systems of succession, mainly revolving around the question of whether succession is limited to males, or whether females are also eligible (historically, the crown often devolved on the eldest surviving male child, as ability to lead an army in battle was a requisite of kingship). Agnatic succession refers to systems where females are neither allowed to succeed nor to transmit succession rights to their male descendants (as according to the Salic law). An &quot;agnate&quot; is a with whom one has a common ancestor by descent in an unbroken male line. Cognatic primogeniture allows both male and female descendants to succeed, but males are usually given preference. In absolute primogeniture, the eldest child can succeed to the throne regardless of sex; this system was adopted in 2011 by the monarchies in the Commonwealth (though not retrospectively affecting the order of succession). Another factor which may be taken into account is the religious affiliation of the candidate or the candidate&#x27;s spouse, specifically where the monarch also has a religious title or role; for example, the British monarch has the title of supreme governor of the Church of England and may not profess Roman Catholicism.

===Elective hereditary monarchy===

Elective monarchy can function as &quot;de facto&quot; hereditary monarchy. A specific type of elective monarchy known as tanistry limits eligibility to members of the ruling house. But hereditary succession can also occur in practice despite any such legal limitations. For example, if the majority of electors belong to the same house, then they may elect only family members. Or a reigning monarch might have sole power to elect a relative. Many late-medieval countries of Europe were officially elective monarchies, but in fact pseudo-elective; most transitioned into officially hereditary systems in the early modern age. Exceptions include the Holy Roman Empire and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

<doc id="255913" wikidata="Q5620932" url="?curid=255913" title="Gussie Fink-Nottle">
<text>Augustus &quot;Gussie&quot; Fink-Nottle is a recurring fictional character in the &quot;Jeeves&quot; novels of comic writer P. G. Wodehouse, being a lifelong friend of Jeeves&#x27;s master Bertie Wooster and a country member of the Drones Club. He wears horn-rimmed spectacles and studies newts.

==Life and character==

A small young man, Gussie Fink-Nottle (called &quot;Spink-Bottle&quot; by Bertie Wooster&#x27;s Aunt Dahlia) is one of Bertie&#x27;s friends. He is described as fish-faced. He wears horn-rimmed, or tortoiseshell-rimmed spectacles. He went to a private school with Bertie Wooster, where they were close enough friends that they shared Bertie&#x27;s last bar of chocolate. He had not been in London for over five years before meeting Madeline Bassett. Generally a teetotaller, he drinks whisky once, and says that it tastes unpleasantly like medicine, burns the throat and leaves one thirsty. His preferred drink is orange juice. Gussie is very shy in his first appearance, though he becomes more confident and assertive over time.

Having become interested in newts as a child, Gussie became more devoted to studying these creatures through university and afterward, eventually observing the amphibians in a pond at his home in Lincolnshire. Later, he carries newts around in glass tanks. Knowledgeable about the species, he describes the courtship practices of newts to Bertie Wooster and on another occasion provides a great deal of information on the subject to Madeline Bassett.

It is likely that Gussie is a member of the Drones Club. While Gussie&#x27;s membership is not stated directly, there are at least three pieces of evidence suggesting he is a member of the Drones: at least five known Drones Club members attend the dinner celebrating Gussie&#x27;s engagement to Madeline that Bertie gives Gussie at the Drones, Bertie states that Gussie loves cold steak and kidney pie so much that Bertie has known him to order it &quot;even on curry day at the Drones&quot;, and it is implied by Wodehouse in a 1937 letter he wrote to &quot;The Times&quot; that one can find Gussie at the Drones Club. Gussie is described as a Drone in two books about Wodehouse&#x27;s characters, &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Wodehouse&quot; by Daniel H. Garrison and &quot;Wodehouse in Woostershire&quot; by Tony Ring and Geoffrey Jaggard.

In &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot;, Gussie drinks whisky to gather the courage to propose to Madeline Bassett (and also unknowingly drinks orange juice spiked with gin), and while under the influence of the drinks, ends up giving an uninhibited and noteworthy speech at Market Snodsbury Grammar School. In that story, he becomes engaged to Madeline, despite a temporary engagement to Bertie&#x27;s cousin Angela Travers. His engagement to Madeline is ended and renewed in &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;, in which he also comes into conflict with Roderick Spode.

He is still engaged to Madeline through &quot;The Mating Season&quot;, though he tried to send her a letter ending their engagement, and he temporarily falls for Catsmeat Potter-Pirbright&#x27;s sister Corky. Also in &quot;The Mating Season&quot;, Catsmeat makes Gussie climb into the Trafalgar Square fountain while clothed, and Gussie uses a false name twice. When in court after being arrested for wading in the Trafalgar Square fountain, he uses the alias Alfred Duff Cooper (clearly taken from British politician Alfred Duff Cooper), and he uses Bertie Wooster&#x27;s name when pretending to be Bertie at Deverill Hall. In &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot;, his engagement to Madeline is ended for good after she tries to make him stick to a vegetarian diet, and Gussie elopes with Emerald Stoker.

==Appearances==
Gussie appears in:

* &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot; (1934)
* &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot; (1938)
* &quot;The Mating Season&quot; (1949)
* &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot; (1963)

Gussie is mentioned in:
* &quot;Jeeves in the Offing&quot; (1960)
* &quot;Much Obliged, Jeeves&quot; (1971)
* &quot;Aunts Aren&#x27;t Gentlemen&quot; (1974)

==Market Snodsbury Grammar School speech==

The scene in &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot; in which Gussie, thoroughly inebriated due to Jeeves and later Bertie Wooster lacing his orange juice with gin, as well as his massive drink of whisky, gives a speech at the Market Snodsbury Grammar School is often cited as among the finest vignettes in English literature.

Gussie goes to the boys&#x27; school to present prizes to the pupils (for spelling, drawing, etc.), with the boys&#x27; relatives and other members of the community in attendance. He is taking the place of Reverend William Plomer, who is out due to illness. After making some snide remarks to the previous speaker (a man with a beard who mistakenly calls Gussie &quot;Fitz-Wattle&quot;), Gussie, standing with his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat, begins to deliver his speech:

&quot;Boys,&quot; said Gussie, &quot;I mean ladies and gentlemen and boys, I will not detain you long, but I propose on this occasion to feel compelled to say a few auspicious words. Ladies – boys and ladies and gentlemen – we have all listened with interest to the remarks of our friend here who forgot to shave this morning – I don&#x27;t know his name, but then he didn&#x27;t know mine – Fitz-Wattle, I mean, absolutely absurd – which squares things up a bit – and we are all sorry that the Reverend What-ever-he-was-called should be dying of adenoids, but after all, here today, gone tomorrow, and all flesh is as grass, and what not, but that wasn&#x27;t what I wanted to say. What I wanted to say was this – and I say it confidently – without fear of contradiction – I say, in short, I am happy to be here on this auspicious occasion and I take much pleasure in kindly awarding the prizes, consisting of the handsome books you see laid out on that table. As Shakespeare says, there are sermons in books, stones in the running brooks, or, rather, the other way about, and there you have it in a nutshell.&quot;

Gussie&#x27;s grammar school speech is referenced in &quot;Jeeves in the Offing&quot;. Bertie recounts that at the grammar school, Gussie &quot;had got pickled to the gills and made an outstanding exhibition of himself, setting up a mark at which all future orators would shoot in vain&quot;.

<doc id="255915" wikidata="Q4467592" url="?curid=255915" title="Dynasty Warriors">
<text>is a series of Japanese hack and slash action video games created by Omega Force and Koei (now Koei Tecmo). The series is a spin-off of Koei&#x27;s turn-based strategy &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; series, based upon the Chinese novel of the same name, which is a romanticised retelling of the Chinese Three Kingdoms period.

The first game in the series, titled &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; in English and &quot;Sangokumusō&quot; in Japanese, was a fighting game, a separate genre from the rest of the games in the series. Koei later created a new game as a spin-off and added the word to the beginning of the title to differentiate it from its predecessor. When the game was localized for the North American market, the name became &quot;Dynasty Warriors 2&quot;. Since then, all English titles have been numbered one larger than their Japanese counterparts. Because the original &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; game belongs to a separate genre and has a different series title in Japan, Koei Tecmo does not consider it a formal entry in the &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; series. This is evidenced by Koei-Tecmo&#x27;s celebration of the series&#x27; 20th anniversary in 2020, two decades after the release of &quot;Dynasty Warriors 2&quot;.

In 2008, it was Koei&#x27;s most successful franchise, and as of February 2020, the series has sold more than 21 million copies worldwide.

==Main series==
The first &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; (&quot;Sangokumusō&quot;) is a traditional one-on-one fighting game, released in 1997 for the PlayStation. Its gameplay style is reminiscent of &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot;, &quot;The Last Blade&quot;, &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; and &quot;Soul Blade&quot;.

The next game was released in Japan as &quot;Shin Sangokumusou&quot;. This game was released in other countries as &quot;Dynasty Warriors 2&quot;, leading to the discrepancy in title numbers. From this game onwards, the player chooses a playable character and plays a number of levels representing particular battles in the Three Kingdoms period, eventually defeating all other rival kingdoms and uniting China under a common ruler. In this game mode, known as &quot;Musou Mode&quot;, the generals are usually chosen from one of the three kingdoms (Wu, Shu or Wei; however, from &quot;Dynasty Warriors 3: Xtreme Legends&quot; onwards, independent generals were given full stories as well). &quot;Dynasty Warriors 3&quot; has two secret characters, Nü Wa and Fu Xi, that are not playable in Musou Mode.

&quot;Dynasty Warriors 2&quot;, &quot;Dynasty Warriors 3&quot;, &quot;Dynasty Warriors 5&quot; and &quot;Dynasty Warriors 6&quot; have individual Musou Modes for each character. In &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot;, &quot;Dynasty Warriors 7&quot;, and &quot;Dynasty Warriors 8&quot;, each of the Three Kingdoms has its own Musou Mode, which all characters from a particular kingdom would play. The stages are presented in a third-person view, with the camera set behind the player as they engage the enemy forces. Each scenario can have different win/lose conditions, but the common losing conditions (defeat of the commander-in-chief, health bar reaching zero and maximum time limit reached) still hold. As for the other characters not from either of the Three Kingdoms, their Musou story modes are purely fictional since in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, most or all of them were eliminated until only the Three Kingdoms were left.

In &quot;Dynasty Warriors 5&quot;, a relatively more realistic Musou Mode is introduced for each character. Instead of participating in the entire set of their kingdoms&#x27; events, the characters appear only in certain battles that they had fought in, as according to the novel or factual history. Therefore, characters will start at different points in time and they may never have opportunities to encounter some of the other characters (e.g. Zhuge Liang will never meet Lü Bu or Dong Zhuo in his Musou Mode). In between stages there are some dramatic cutscenes, in which the character will express their thoughts on the situation, adding a more personal touch and keeping the player updated on the events. Besides, a character&#x27;s Musou Mode may end before the unification of China at any point of time, stopping for most at their historical point of death. However, some characters such as the three founders may continue to participate in battles that occurred after their deaths (e.g. Cao Cao appearing in Battle of Wuzhang Plains), representing an extended leadership under more successful circumstances.

In &quot;Dynasty Warriors 8&quot;, an &quot;if&quot; route is added for each country. By fulfilling conditions in previous battles, the player can unlock a hypothetical route for each country where it manages to achieve what it failed to do in actual history. For example, the player can help Wei avoid defeat in the battle of Chibi and unite China with all Wei characters alive.

&quot;Dynasty Warriors 9&quot; sought to introduce an &quot;open world&quot; style of gameplay.

==&quot;Xtreme Legends&quot; and &quot;Empires&quot;==

In 2002, an expansion was first released for the main games, beginning with &quot;Dynasty Warriors 3&quot;. This expansion features new Musou Modes for the characters in the &quot;Other&quot; category as well as new stages, weapons, items, and modes. The &quot;Xtreme Legends&quot; expansion only have the new content, and so players would require the original game disc and use the &quot;Mixjoy&quot; option to access all features. The following games would continue the tradition by having &quot;Xtreme Legends&quot; expansion, save for &quot;Dynasty Warriors 6&quot;. New characters were also added through the &quot;Xtreme Legends&quot; starting with &quot;Dynasty Warriors 7&quot;.

Beginning in 2004, another expansion line, titled &quot;Empires&quot; was first released for &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot;. In &quot;Empires&quot;, the game would combine the action gameplay of the regular series with strategical and tactical elements from Koei&#x27;s earlier series &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. Unlike the &quot;Xtreme Legends&quot;, &quot;Empires&quot; did not require the original game disc to access all of its features as it is considered a unique game of its own. Again, the following games would continue having the &quot;Empires&quot; expansion, including &quot;Dynasty Warriors 6&quot;, which did not receive an &quot;Xtreme Legends&quot; expansion.

==Portable games==
In 2004, Koei created the first &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; title for portable game handhelds, &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot;, on PlayStation Portable, and in the following year, &quot;Dynasty Warriors Advance&quot; for Game Boy Advance. The sequel of the first PSP game, &quot;Dynasty Warriors Vol. 2&quot; was released in 2006. In 2007, Koei released &quot;Dynasty Warriors DS: Fighter&#x27;s Battle&quot; for the Nintendo DS. Another PSP game based on &quot;Dynasty Warriors 6&quot;, &quot;Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce&quot; was released in 2009, which was followed up by a sequel, &quot;Shin Sangokumusō: Multi Raid 2&quot; in 2010. A PlayStation Vita game, &quot;Dynasty Warriors Next&quot;, was released in 2011 as a launch title, and a Nintendo 3DS game, &quot;Shin Sangokumusō VS&quot; (真・三國無双 VS), was released in April 2012. Another portable game was announced in September 2020 for iOS and Android, titled &quot;Shin Sangokumusō&quot; (真・三國無双).

Other than titles specifically made for handhelds, select main &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; titles have also been ported to handhelds, all of which are only available in Japan. The PS2 version of &quot;Dynasty Warriors 6&quot;, &quot;Dynasty Warriors 6: Special&quot; was also ported to the PSP, which was soon followed by the &quot;Empires&quot; expansion in 2010. A port of &quot;Dynasty Warriors 7&quot;, &quot;Shin Sangokumusou 6: Special&quot; was released in 2011 for PSP, based on the &quot;Xtreme Legends&quot; expansion but without including the three new characters added for the expansion. A PS Vita port of &quot;Dynasty Warriors 8&quot; was released in 2013, which includes features from the &quot;Xtreme Legends&quot; expansion for that game. Later, in 2015, the &quot;Empires&quot; expansion of &quot;Dynasty Warriors 8&quot; was also released on the PS Vita, notably also compatible with the PlayStation TV.

==PC games==
&quot;Dynasty Warriors 4: Hyper&quot; in 2005 is marked as the first &quot;DW&quot; game for the PC. Hyper was a port of &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; for the PS2, and had harder AI, more enemies on screen and smoother textures.

In 2006, &quot;Dynasty Warriors BB&quot; (renamed &quot;Dynasty Warriors Online&quot; in 2007) was released as an online game.

==Characters==
The &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; game series, although referenced to factual people, is known for changing the traditional ways of how some of the historical characters were depicted in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; or in historical records. For example, Zhang He appears to be more feminine while Wei Yan becomes a bestial tribal warrior, while historical accounts depict both to be relatively normal generals with no outstanding characteristics such as these. Some of them also wield weapons that are anachronistic, such as Ling Tong&#x27;s nunchaku and Sun Ce&#x27;s tonfas. A touch of mysticism is also added, as some characters such as Zhuge Liang, Sima Yi and Zuo Ci have the ability to use magic in their attacks. Female characters (except Zhurong and Wang Yi) who did not participate in any battles in the novel or in history are depicted as fearsome female warriors with exceptional fighting skills and weapons.

A total of 96 characters have been made playable at some point in the series (not counting spin-offs); however, only 94 currently make mainstay appearances as of &quot;Dynasty Warriors 9&quot;. Each of these characters is armed with a weapon that may be a conventional historical one, an exotic martial arts weapon or a magical weapon that enhances their mystical powers. From &quot;Dynasty Warriors 3&quot; onward, each character can choose from a range of weapons with their own power-ups and ability enhancements, as well as higher-level weapons that extend their attack chain.

==Spin-offs and licensed games==

Following the success of &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot;, Koei released &quot;Dynasty Tactics&quot; in 2002 and its sequel, &quot;Dynasty Tactics 2&quot; in the following year, focusing on strategy and tactics in the same Three Kingdoms setting.

Probably the third most recognized franchise of Koei, &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; (&quot;Sengoku Musou&quot; in Japan), was introduced in 2004. Instead of the Three Kingdoms era, the series uses Japan&#x27;s Sengoku period. As a result, the game&#x27;s roster consists of characters from that era, while having gameplay similar to that of Dynasty Warriors. The game would be followed by &quot;Samurai Warriors 2&quot; in 2006, &quot;Samurai Warriors 3&quot; in 2009, &quot;Samurai Warriors 4&quot; in 2014, and &quot;Samurai Warriors 5&quot; in 2021. as well as numerous other spin-off titles. As with the original series, &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; also has the &quot;Xtreme Legends&quot; and &quot;Empires&quot; expansions, with the former beginning on the first game and the latter on the second game.

A tactical role-playing game, &quot;Dynasty Warriors: Godseekers&quot; was announced on April 5, 2016, with a Japanese release date in 2016 for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita. It will be the series&#x27; first strategy RPG, featuring a turn-based system and a world map. The game will also completely deviate from history by introducing a completely new story line involving fictitious mystical elements, with Zhao Yun as the main protagonist.

Other related titles include:

The game was followed by a direct sequel &quot;Warriors Orochi 2&quot; (called &quot;Musou Orochi: Mao Sairin&quot; in Japan) which reuses the same gameplay of the original game with the focus on adding new stories. A compilation of the two games, &quot;Musou Orochi Z&quot; was released in 2009, thus far has not been brought overseas. The third game, &quot;Warriors Orochi 3&quot;, was released in 2011. The game had a different engine and gameplay than the first two games, and noticeably titled &quot;Musou Orochi 2&quot; in Japan (as the second game is considered as an expansion to the first game). The third game would have several ports and updates that would expand on the content, including a port for PlayStation Portable and Wii U in 2012, and an &quot;Ultimate&quot; update in 2013, which was re-released as a definitive edition including all downloadable content for the game in July 12, 2022 for Microsoft Windows.

==Future==

In January 2018, the president of Koei Tecmo, Hisashi Koinuma, said that he wanted to make a Dynasty Warriors spin-off using characters and settings from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise from Lucasfilm after they managed to be successful with &quot;Nioh&quot; and &quot;Fire Emblem Warriors&quot;. Koinuma chose Star Wars to be able to make a Science fiction Warriors series, which had not been done previously. However, as Electronic Arts owns the game rights to the Star Wars franchise, it would be a difficult collaboration to achieve, and is more of a future goal. As of 2021, EA have lost the exclusivity rights in developing Star Wars games and in the development of their other projects such as Samurai Warriors 5, Koinuma reiterated that both Super Mario and Star Wars in a Dynasty Warriors format are projects he personally wanted to do it in the future.

==Film adaptation==

On 15 March 2016, Suzuki Akihiro and the Hong Kong-based company HMV Digital China announced at the 20th Hong Kong International Film and TV Market that they will be making a live-action film adaptation of &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot;. The film will be directed by Roy Chow, produced and written by Christine To, and to be released in 2017. On 8 July 2017, HMV Digital China&#x27;s executive chairman Stephen Shiu Jr. revealed on his weibo that the film will start shooting on 11 July. He also revealed that he had approached Koei Tecmo four years ago and secured the rights to adapt the &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; franchise into a movie. On 11 July, Shiu announced that Han Geng, Wang Kai, Louis Koo, Tony Yang and Gulnazar are part of the main cast. On 28 September 2017, director Roy Chow announced that after 63 days of filming in mainland China, the team will be moving to New Zealand in November 2017 to shoot the background scenes.

Shooting for &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; wrapped up on 28 November 2017. The pre-production phase took eight months, the principal photography phase lasted five months, and the post-production phase was expected to take up to a year. A trailer for the film was released in 2018, stating a release was planned for 2019. The film was released on April 29, 2021, in Hong Kong, and in China on April 30, 2021. The film was made available via Netflix in the UK in June 2021 and other regions in July 2021.

==Stages==
Many of the stages are recreations of notable battles in the late Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms periods, that are usually depicted in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. There are also some original creations in the newer installments that are also historical, such as the battle between the Nanman and Wu.

==Music==
The music for the &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; game series is a mixture of traditional Chinese instrumentals, hard rock and heavy metal. Most stages have their own exclusive music tracks played and the tracks change according to the battle situation or events. In licensed titles, the music falls between mixing metal instrumentalisation with compositions from the source material along with original songs made in the same vein as those from the licensed IP. There are notable cases where compositions deviate completely from the hard rock roots of most Dynasty Warriors titles and simply intensify the original musical style from the IP, an example is &quot;Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity&quot;, which forewent the heavy metal remixes that &quot;Hyrule Warriors&quot; used, and instead reprised the more subdued compositions from &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&quot; with stronger, and more bombastic orchestral tracks.

<doc id="255919" wikidata="Q1486" url="?curid=255919" title="Buenos Aires">
<text>Buenos Aires, officially the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, is the capital and largest city of Argentina. It is located on the southwest of the Río de la Plata. Buenos Aires is classified as an Alpha− global city, according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC) 2024 ranking. The city proper has a population of 3.1 million and its urban area 16.7 million, making it the fourteenth largest metropolitan area in the world.

The proper city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor its capital; it is an autonomous district. In 1880, after the Argentine Civil War, Buenos Aires was federalized and split from Buenos Aires Province. The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores; both now neighborhoods of the city. The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy, hence its formal name of Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Thus, citizens elected their first Chief of Government in 1996; previously, the Mayor was directly appointed by the President of Argentina.

The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation includes several surrounding cities, which are located in the neighbouring districts of the Buenos Aires Province. It constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas. It is also the second largest city south of the Tropic of Capricorn. Buenos Aires has the highest human development of all Argentine administrative divisions and its quality of life was ranked 91st in the world in 2018, being one of the best in Latin America.

It is known for its preserved eclectic European architecture and rich cultural life. It is a multicultural city that is home to multiple ethnic and religious groups, contributing to its culture as well as to the dialect spoken in the city and in some other parts of the country. This is because since the 19th century, the city, and the country in general, has been a major recipient of millions of immigrants from all over the world, making it a melting pot where several ethnic groups live together. Thus, Buenos Aires is considered one of the most diverse cities of the Americas.

==Etymology==


Aragonese archives record that Catalan missionaries and Jesuits arriving in Cagliari (Sardinia) under the Crown of Aragon, after its capture from the Pisans in 1324, established their headquarters on top of a hill that overlooked the city. The hill was known to them as &quot;Bonaira&quot; (or in Sardinian), as it was free of the foul smell prevalent in the old city (the castle area), which is adjacent to swampland. During the siege of Cagliari, the Catalans built a sanctuary to the Virgin Mary on top of the hill. In 1335, King Alfonso the Gentle donated the church to the Mercedarians, who built an abbey that stands to this day. In the years after that, a story circulated, claiming that a statue of the Virgin Mary was retrieved from the sea after it miraculously calmed a storm in the Mediterranean Sea. The statue was placed in the abbey. Spanish sailors, especially Andalusians, venerated this image and frequently invoked the &quot;Fair Winds&quot; to aid them in their navigation and prevent shipwrecks. A sanctuary to the Virgin of Buen Ayre would later be erected in Seville.

At the foundation of Buenos Aires, Spanish sailors arrived in the Río de la Plata giving thanks to the blessings of &quot;Santa Maria de los Buenos Aires&quot;, &quot;Holy Mary of the Good Winds&quot;, who they believed to have given them the good winds to reach the coast of what is today the modern city. Pedro de Mendoza called the city &quot;Holy Mary of the Fair Winds&quot;, a name suggested by the chaplain of Mendoza&#x27;s expedition – a devotee of the Virgin of Buen Ayre – after the &quot;Madonna&quot; of Bonaria from Sardinia (which is still to this day the patroness of the Mediterranean island). Mendoza&#x27;s settlement soon came under attack by indigenous people and was abandoned in 1541.

For many years, the name was attributed to a Sancho del Campo, who is said to have exclaimed: &quot;How fair are the winds of this land!&quot; as he arrived. In 1882, after conducting extensive research in Spanish archives, Argentine merchant Eduardo Madero ultimately concluded that the name was instead closely linked with the devotion of the sailors to Our Lady of Buen Ayre. A second (and permanent) settlement was established in 1580 by Juan de Garay, who sailed down the Paraná River from Asunción, now the capital of Paraguay. Garay preserved the name originally chosen by Mendoza, calling the city &quot;Ciudad de la Santísima Trinidad y Puerto de Santa María del Buen Aire&quot; (&quot;City of the Most Holy Trinity and Port of Saint Mary of the Fair Winds&quot;). The short form that eventually became the city&#x27;s name, &quot;Buenos Aires&quot;, became commonly used during the 17th century.

The usual abbreviation for Buenos Aires in Spanish is . It is also common to refer to it as &quot; or &quot;. When referring specifically to the autonomous city, it is very common to colloquially call it &quot; in Spanish. Since the autonomy obtained in 1994, it has been called &quot; (per , Autonomous City of Buenos Aires).

==History==

===Viceregal times===
In 1516, navigator and explorer Juan Díaz de Solís, navigating in the name of Spain, was the first European to reach the Río de la Plata. His expedition was cut short when he was killed during an attack by the native Charrúa tribe in what is now Uruguay. The city of Buenos Aires was first established as &quot;Ciudad de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre&quot; (literally &quot;City of Our Lady Saint Mary of the Fair Winds&quot;) after Our Lady of Bonaria (Patroness Saint of Sardinia) on 2 February 1536 by a Spanish expedition led by Pedro de Mendoza. The settlement founded by Mendoza was located in what is today the San Telmo district of Buenos Aires, south of the city center.

More attacks by the indigenous people forced the settlers away, and in 1542, the site was thusly abandoned. A second (and permanent) settlement was established on 11 June 1580 by Juan de Garay, who arrived by sailing down the Paraná River from Asunción (now the capital of Paraguay). He dubbed the settlement &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; and its port became &quot;Puerto de Santa María de los Buenos Aires.&quot;

From its earliest days, Buenos Aires depended primarily on trade. During most of the 17th century, Spanish ships were menaced by pirates, so they developed a complex system where ships with military protection were dispatched to Central America in a convoy from Seville (the only port allowed to trade with the American colonies) to Lima, Peru, and from there to the other cities of the viceroyalty. Because of this, products took a very long time to arrive in Buenos Aires, and the taxes generated by the transport made them prohibitive. This scheme frustrated the traders of Buenos Aires, and a thriving informal, yet tolerated by the authorities, contraband industry developed inside the viceroyalties and with the Portuguese. This also instilled a deep resentment among &quot;porteños&quot; towards the Spanish authorities.
Sensing these feelings, Charles III of Spain progressively eased the trade restrictions before finally declaring Buenos Aires an open port in the late 18th century. The capture of Portobelo in Panama by British forces also fueled the need to foster commerce via the Atlantic route, to the detriment of Lima-based trade. One of his rulings was to split a region from the Viceroyalty of Perú and create instead the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, with Buenos Aires as the capital. However, Charles&#x27;s placating actions did not have the desired effect, and the &quot;porteños&quot;, some of them versed in the ideology of the French Revolution, instead became even more convinced of the need for independence from Spain.

===War of Independence===

During the British invasions of the Río de la Plata, British forces attacked Buenos Aires twice. In 1806 the British successfully invaded Buenos Aires, but an army from Montevideo led by Santiago de Liniers defeated them. In the brief period of British rule, the viceroy Rafael Sobremonte managed to escape to Córdoba and designated this city as capital. Buenos Aires became the capital again after its recapture by Argentine forces, but Sobremonte could not resume his duties as viceroy. Santiago de Liniers, chosen as new viceroy, prepared the city against a possible new British attack and repelled a second invasion by Britain in 1807. The militarization generated in society changed the balance of power favorably for the criollos (in contrast to peninsulars), as well as the development of the Peninsular War in Spain.

An attempt by the peninsular merchant Martín de Álzaga to remove Liniers and replace him with a Junta was defeated by the criollo armies. However, by 1810 it would be those same armies who would support a new revolutionary attempt, successfully removing the new viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros. This is known as the May Revolution, which is now celebrated as a national holiday. This event started the Argentine War of Independence, and many armies left Buenos Aires to fight the diverse strongholds of royalist resistance, with varying levels of success. The government was held first by two Juntas of many members, then by two triumvirates, and finally by a unipersonal office, the Supreme Director. Formal independence from Spain was declared in 1816, at the Congress of Tucumán. Buenos Aires managed to endure the whole Spanish American wars of independence without falling again under royalist rule.

Historically, Buenos Aires has been Argentina&#x27;s main venue of liberal, free-trading, and foreign ideas. In contrast, many of the provinces, especially those to the city&#x27;s northwest, advocated a more nationalistic and Catholic approach to political and social issues. In fact, much of the internal tension in Argentina&#x27;s history, starting with the centralist-federalist conflicts of the 19th century, can be traced back to these contrasting views. In the months immediately following said &quot;May Revolution&quot;, Buenos Aires sent a number of military envoys to the provinces with the intention of obtaining their approval. Instead, the enterprise fueled tensions between the capital and the provinces; many of these missions ended in violent clashes.

In the 19th century the city was blockaded twice by naval forces: by the French from 1838 to 1840, and later by an Anglo-French expedition from 1845 to 1848. Both blockades failed to bring the Argentine government to the negotiating table, and the foreign powers eventually desisted from their demands.

===19th and 20th century===

During most of the 19th century, the political status of the city remained a sensitive subject. It was already the capital of Buenos Aires Province, and between 1853 and 1860 it was the capital of the seceded State of Buenos Aires. The issue was fought out more than once on the battlefield, until the matter was finally settled in 1880 when the city was federalized and became the seat of government, with its mayor appointed by the president. The Casa Rosada became the seat of the president.

Health conditions in poor areas were appalling, with high rates of tuberculosis. Contemporaneous public health physicians and politicians typically blamed both the poor themselves and their ramshackle tenement houses (conventillos) for the spread of the dreaded disease. People ignored public-health campaigns to limit the spread of contagious diseases, such as the prohibition of spitting on the streets, the strict guidelines to care for infants and young children, and quarantines that separated families from ill loved ones.

In addition to the wealth generated by customs duties and Argentine foreign trade in general, as well as the existence of fertile pampas, railroad development in the second half of the 19th century increased the economic power of Buenos Aires as raw materials flowed into its factories. A leading destination for immigrants from Europe, particularly Italy and Spain, from 1880 to 1930, Buenos Aires became a multicultural city that ranked itself alongside the major European capitals. During this time, the Colón Theater became one of the world&#x27;s top opera venues, and the city became the regional capital of radio, television, cinema, and theater. The city&#x27;s main avenues were built during those years, and the dawn of the 20th century saw the construction of South America&#x27;s tallest buildings and its first underground system. A second construction boom, from 1945 to 1980, reshaped downtown and much of the city.

Buenos Aires also attracted migrants from Argentina&#x27;s provinces and neighboring countries. Shanty towns (&quot;villas miseria&quot;) started growing around the city&#x27;s industrial areas during the 1930s, leading to pervasive social problems and social contrasts with the largely upwardly mobile Buenos Aires population. These laborers became the political base of Peronism, which emerged in Buenos Aires during the pivotal demonstration of 17 October 1945, at the Plaza de Mayo. Industrial workers of the Greater Buenos Aires industrial belt have been Peronism&#x27;s main support base ever since, and Plaza de Mayo became the site for demonstrations and many of the country&#x27;s political events; on 16 June 1955, however, a splinter faction of the Navy bombed the Plaza de Mayo area, killing 364 civilians (see &quot;Bombing of Plaza de Mayo&quot;). This was the only time the city was attacked from the air, and the event was followed by a military uprising which deposed President Perón, three months later (see &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot;).

In the 1970s the city suffered from the fighting between left-wing revolutionary movements (Montoneros, ERP and F.A.R.) and the right-wing paramilitary group Triple A, supported by Isabel Perón, who became president of Argentina in 1974 after Juan Perón&#x27;s death.

The March 1976 coup, led by General Jorge Videla, only escalated this conflict; the &quot;Dirty War&quot; resulted in 30,000 &quot;desaparecidos&quot; (people kidnapped and killed by the military during the years of the junta). The silent marches of their mothers (Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo) are a well-known image of Argentines&#x27; suffering during those times. The dictatorship&#x27;s appointed mayor, Osvaldo Cacciatore, also drew up plans for a network of freeways intended to relieve the city&#x27;s acute traffic gridlock. The plan, however, called for a seemingly indiscriminate razing of residential areas and, though only three of the eight planned were put up at the time, they were mostly obtrusive raised freeways that continue to blight a number of formerly comfortable neighborhoods to this day.
The city was visited by Pope John Paul II twice, firstly in 1982 and again in 1987; on these occasions gathered some of the largest crowds in the city&#x27;s history. The return of democracy in 1983 coincided with a cultural revival, and the 1990s saw an economic revival, particularly in the construction and financial sectors.

On 17 March 1992, a bomb exploded in the Israeli Embassy, killing 29 and injuring 242. Another explosion, on 18 July 1994, destroyed a building housing several Jewish organizations, killing 85 and injuring many more, these incidents marked the beginning of Middle Eastern terrorism to South America. Following a 1993 agreement, the Argentine Constitution was amended to give Buenos Aires autonomy and rescinding, among other things, the president&#x27;s right to appoint the city&#x27;s mayor (as had been the case since 1880). On 30 June 1996, voters in Buenos Aires chose their first elected mayor, Jefe de Gobierno.

===21st century===
In 1996, following the 1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution, the city held its first mayoral elections under the new statutes, with the mayor&#x27;s title formally changed to &quot;Head of Government&quot;. The winner was Fernando de la Rúa, who would later become President of Argentina from 1999 to 2001.

De la Rúa&#x27;s successor, Aníbal Ibarra, won two popular elections, but was impeached (and ultimately deposed on 6 March 2006) as a result of the fire at the República Cromagnon nightclub. In the meantime, Jorge Telerman, who had been the acting mayor, was invested with the office. In the 2007 elections, Mauricio Macri of the Republican Proposal (PRO) party won the second-round of voting over Daniel Filmus of the Frente para la Victoria (FPV) party, taking office on 9 December 2007. In 2011, the elections went to a second round with 60.96 percent of the vote for PRO, compared to 39.04 percent for FPV, thus ensuring Macri&#x27;s reelection as mayor of the city with María Eugenia Vidal as deputy mayor.

PRO is established in the most affluent area of the city and in those over fifty years of age.

The 2015 elections were the first to use an electronic voting system in the city, similar to the one used in Salta Province. In these elections held on 5 July 2015, Macri stepped down as mayor and pursue his presidential bid and Horacio Rodríguez Larreta took his place as the mayoral candidate for PRO. In the first round of voting, FPV&#x27;s Mariano Recalde obtained 21.78% of the vote, while Martín Lousteau of the ECO party obtained 25.59% and Larreta obtained 45.55%, meaning that the elections went to a second round since PRO was unable to secure the majority required for victory. The second round was held on 19 July 2015 and Larreta obtained 51.6% of the vote, followed closely by Lousteau with 48.4%, thus, PRO won the elections for a third term with Larreta as mayor and Diego Santilli as deputy. In these elections, PRO was stronger in wealthier northern Buenos Aires, while ECO was stronger in the southern, poorer neighborhoods of the city. On 5 December 2023, Jorge Macri of PRO was sworn in as new mayor of Buenos Aires City to succeed outgoing Mayor Horacio Rodríguez Larreta of the same party.

==Geography==

The city of Buenos Aires lies in the pampa region, with the exception of some areas such as the Buenos Aires Ecological Reserve, the Boca Juniors (football club)&#x27;s &quot;sports city&quot;, Jorge Newbery Airport, the Puerto Madero neighborhood and the main port itself; these were all built on reclaimed land along the coasts of the Rio de la Plata (the world&#x27;s widest river).

The region was formerly crossed by different streams and lagoons, some of which were refilled, and others tubed. Among the most important streams are the Maldonado, Vega, Medrano, Cildañez, and White. In 1908, as floods were damaging the city&#x27;s infrastructure, many streams were channeled and rectified; furthermore, starting in 1919, most streams were enclosed. Most notably, the Maldonado was tubed in 1954; it currently runs below Juan B. Justo Avenue.

Buenos Aires has over 250 parks and green spaces, the largest concentration of which are on the city&#x27;s eastern side in the neighborhoods of Puerto Madero, Recoleta, Palermo, and Belgrano. Some of the most important are:

*Parque Tres de Febrero was designed by urbanist Jordán Czeslaw Wysocki and architect Julio Dormal. The park was inaugurated on 11 November 1875. The subsequent dramatic economic growth of Buenos Aires helped to lead to its transfer to the municipal domain in 1888, whereby French Argentine urbanist Carlos Thays was commissioned to expand and further beautify the park, between 1892 and 1912. Thays designed the Zoological Gardens, the Botanical Gardens, the adjoining Plaza Italia and the Rose Garden.
*Botanical Gardens, designed by French architect and landscape designer Carlos Thays, the garden was inaugurated on 7 September 1898. Thays and his family lived in an English style mansion, located within the gardens, between 1892 and 1898, when he served as director of parks and walks in the city. The mansion, built in 1881, is currently the main building of the complex.
*Buenos Aires Japanese Gardens Is the largest of its type in the world, outside Japan. Completed in 1967, the gardens were inaugurated on the occasion of a State visit to Argentina by Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko of Japan.
*Plaza de Mayo Since being the scene of May Revolution of 1810 that led to Argentinian independence, the plaza has been a hub of political life in Argentina.
*Plaza San Martín is a park located in the city&#x27;s neighborhood of Retiro. Situated at the northern end of pedestrianized Florida Street, the park is bounded by Libertador Ave. (N), Maipú St. (W), Santa Fe Avenue (S), and Leandro Alem Av. (E).

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Buenos Aires has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;). As a result of maritime influences from the adjoining Atlantic Ocean, the climate is temperate with extreme temperatures being rare. Because the city is located in an area where the Pampero and Sudestada winds pass by, the weather is variable due to these contrasting air masses.
Summers are hot and humid. The warmest month is January, with a daily average of . Heat waves are common during summers. However, most heat waves are of short duration (less than a week) and are followed by the passage of the cold, dry Pampero wind which brings violent and intense thunderstorms followed by cooler temperatures. The highest temperature ever recorded was on 29 January 1957. In January 2022, a heatwave caused power grid failure in parts of Buenos Aires metropolitan area affecting more than 700,000 households.

Winters are rather cool with mild temperatures during the day and chilly nights. Highs during the season average while lows average . Relative humidity averages in the upper 70s%, which means the city is noted for moderate-to-heavy fogs during autumn and winter. July is the coolest month, with an average temperature of . Cold spells originating from Antarctica occur almost every year, and can persist for several days. Occasionally, warm air masses from the north bring warmer temperatures. The lowest temperature ever recorded in central Buenos Aires (Buenos Aires Central Observatory) was on 9 July 1918. Snow is very rare in the city: the last snowfall occurred on 9 July 2007 when, during the coldest winter in Argentina in almost 30 years, severe snowfalls and blizzards hit the country. It was the first major snowfall in the city in 89 years.

Spring and autumn are characterized by changeable weather conditions. Cold air from the south can bring cooler temperatures while hot humid air from the north brings hot temperatures.

The city receives of precipitation per year. Because of its geomorphology along with an inadequate drainage network, the city is highly vulnerable to flooding during periods of heavy rainfall.


==Government and politics==

===Government structure===

Since the adoption of the city&#x27;s Constitution in 1996, Buenos Aires has had a democratically elected executive; Article 61 of the Constitution of the states that &quot;&quot;Suffrage is free, equal, secret, universal, compulsory and non-accumulative. Resident aliens enjoy this same right, with its corresponding obligations, on equal terms with Argentine citizens registered in the district, under the terms established by law&quot;.&quot; The executive power is vested on the Chief of Government (), who is elected alongside a Deputy Chief of Government. In analogous fashion to the Vice President of Argentina, the Deputy Chief of Government presides over the city&#x27;s legislative body, the City Legislature.

The Chief of Government and the Legislature are both elected for four-year terms; half of the Legislature&#x27;s members are renewed every two years. Elections use the D&#x27;Hondt method of proportional representation. The judicial branch comprises the Supreme Court of Justice (&quot;Tribunal Superior de Justicia&quot;), the Council of Magistracy (&quot;Consejo de la Magistratura&quot;), the Public Ministry, and other city courts.

Legally, the city has less autonomy than the Provinces. In June 1996, shortly before the city&#x27;s first Executive elections were held, the Argentine National Congress issued the National Law 24.588 (known as Ley Cafiero, after the Senator who advanced the project) by which the authority over the 25,000-strong Argentine Federal Police and the responsibility over the federal institutions residing at the city (e.g., National Supreme Court of Justice buildings) would not be transferred from the National Government to the Autonomous City Government until a new consensus could be reached at the National Congress. Furthermore, it declared that the Port of Buenos Aires, along with some other places, would remain under constituted federal authorities. , the deployment of the Metropolitan Police of Buenos Aires is ongoing.

Beginning in 2007, the city has embarked on a new decentralization scheme, creating new Communes (&quot;comunas&quot;) which are to be managed by elected committees of seven members each. Buenos Aires is represented in the Argentine Senate by three senators (, Martín Lousteau, Mariano Recalde and Guadalupe Tagliaferri). The people of Buenos Aires also elect 25 national deputies to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies.

===Law enforcement===

The &quot;Guardia Urbana de Buenos Aires&quot; (Buenos Aires Urban Guard) was a specialized civilian force of the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, that used to deal with different urban conflicts with the objective of developing actions of prevention, dissuasion and mediation, promoting effective behaviors that guarantee the security and the integrity of public order and social coexistence. The unit continuously assisted the personnel of the Argentine Federal Police, especially in emergency situations, events of massive concurrence, and protection of tourist establishments. Urban Guard officials did not carry any weapons in the performing of their duties. Their basic tools were a HT radio transmitter and a whistle. , the Guardia Urbana was removed.

The Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police was the police force under the authority of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. The force was created in 2010 and was composed of 1,850 officers. In 2016, the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police and part of the Argentine Federal Police were merged to create the new Buenos Aires City Police force. The Buenos Aires City Police force began operations on 1 January 2017. Security in the city is now the responsibility of the Buenos Aires City Police. The police is headed by the Chief of Police who is appointed by the head of the executive branch of the city of Buenos Aires. Geographically, the force is divided into 56 stations throughout the city. All police station employees are civilians. The Buenos Aires City Police force is composed of over 25,000 officers.

==Demographics==
===Census data===
In the census of 2010, there were 2,891,082 people residing in the city. The population of Greater Buenos Aires was 13,147,638 according to 2010 census data. The population density in Buenos Aires proper was , but only about in the suburbs.

Buenos Aires&#x27; population has hovered around 3 million since 1947, due to low birth rates and a slow migration to the suburbs. However, the surrounding districts have expanded over fivefold (to around 10 million) since then.

The 2001 census showed a relatively aged population: with 17% under the age of fifteen and 22% over sixty, the people of Buenos Aires have an age structure similar to those in most European cities. They are older than Argentines as a whole (of whom 28% were under 15, and 14% over 60).

Two-thirds of the city&#x27;s residents live in apartment buildings and 30% in single-family homes; 4% live in sub-standard housing. Measured in terms of income, the city&#x27;s poverty rate was 8.4% in 2007 and, including the metro area, 20.6%. Other studies estimate that 4 million people in the metropolitan Buenos Aires area live in poverty.

The city&#x27;s resident labor force of 1.2 million in 2001 was mostly employed in the services sector, particularly social services (25%), commerce and tourism (20%) and business and financial services (17%); despite the city&#x27;s role as Argentina&#x27;s capital, public administration employed only 6%. Manufacturing still employed 10%.

===Districts===

The city is divided into &quot;barrios&quot; (neighborhoods) for administrative purposes, a division originally based on Catholic &quot;parroquias&quot; (parishes). A common expression is that of the &quot;Cien barrios porteños&quot; (&quot;One hundred &quot;porteño&quot; neighborhoods&quot;), referring to a composition made popular in the 1940s by tango singer Alberto Castillo; however, Buenos Aires only consists of 48 official &quot;barrios&quot;. There are several subdivisions of these districts, some with a long history and others that are the product of a real estate invention. A notable example is Palermo – the city&#x27;s largest district – which has been subdivided into various &quot;barrios&quot;, including Palermo Soho, Palermo Hollywood, Las Cañitas and Palermo viejo, among others. A newer scheme has divided the city into 15 &quot;comunas&quot; (communes).
===Population origin===
The majority of &quot;porteños&quot; have European origins, mostly from the Andalusian, Galician, Asturian, and Basque regions of Spain, as well as the Italian regions of Calabria, Liguria, Piedmont, Lombardy, Sicily and Campania. Unrestricted waves of European immigrants to Argentina starting in the mid-19th century significantly increased the country&#x27;s population, even causing the number of porteños to triple between 1887 and 1915 from 500,000 to 1.5 million.

Other significant European origins include French, Portuguese, German, Irish, Norwegian, Polish, Swedish, Greek, Czech, Albanian, Croatian, Slovenian, Dutch, Russian, Serbian, English, Scottish, Slovak, Hungarian and Bulgarian. In the 1980s and 1990s, there was a small wave of immigration from Romania and Ukraine.

The Jewish community in Greater Buenos Aires numbers around 250,000 and is the largest in the country. The city is also eighth largest in the world in terms of Jewish population. Most are of Northern, Western, Central, and Eastern European Ashkenazi origin, primarily Swedish, Dutch, Polish, German, and Russian Jews, with a significant Sephardic minority, mostly made up of Syrian Jews and Lebanese Jews.

Most East Asian immigration in Buenos Aires comes from China. Chinese immigration is the fourth largest in Argentina, with the vast majority of them living in Buenos Aires and its metropolitan area. In the 1980s, most of them were from Taiwan, but since the 1990s the majority of Chinese immigrants come from the mainland Chinese province of Fukien (Fujian). The mainland Chinese who came from Fukien mainly installed supermarkets throughout the city and the suburbs; these supermarkets are so common that, in average, there is one every two and a half blocks and are simply referred to as &quot;el chino&quot; (&quot;the Chinese&quot;). Japanese immigrants are mostly from the Okinawa Prefecture. They started the dry cleaning business in Argentina, an activity that is considered idiosyncratic to the Japanese immigrants in Buenos Aires. Korean Immigration occurred after the division of Korea; they mainly settled in Flores and Once.

In the , 2.1% of the population or 61,876 persons declared to be Indigenous or first-generation descendants of Indigenous people in Buenos Aires (not including the 24 adjacent Partidos that make up Greater Buenos Aires). Amongst the 61,876 persons who are of indigenous origin, 15.9% are Quechua people, 15.9% are Guaraní, 15.5% are Aymara and 11% are Mapuche. Within the 24 adjacent Partidos, 186,640 persons or 1.9% of the total population declared themselves to be Indigenous. Amongst the 186,640 persons who are of indigenous origin, 21.2% are Guaraní, 19% are Toba, 11.3% are Mapuche, 10.5% are Quechua and 7.6% are Diaguita.

In the city, 15,764 people identified themselves as Afro-Argentine in the 2010 Census.

===Urban problems===

&quot;Villas miseria&quot; are a type of slum whose size ranges from small groups of precarious houses to large communities with thousands of residents. In slums on the outskirts, there was an escalation in crime during early 2024, mainly robbery-related murders.

Buenos Aires has below of green space per person, which is 90% less than New York, 85% less than Madrid and 80% less than Paris. The World Health Organization (WHO), in its concern for public health, produced a document stating that every city should have a minimum of of green space per person; an optimal amount of space per person would range from 10 to .

===Language===

Buenos Aires&#x27; dialect of Spanish, which is known as &quot;Rioplatense Spanish&quot;, is distinguished by its use of &quot;voseo&quot;, &quot;yeísmo&quot;, and aspiration of &quot;s&quot; in various contexts. It is heavily influenced by the dialects of Spanish spoken in Andalusia and Murcia and shares its features with that of other cities like Rosario and Montevideo, Uruguay. In the early 20th century, Argentina absorbed millions of immigrants, many of them Italians, who spoke mostly in their local dialects (mainly Neapolitan, Sicilian and Genoese). Their adoption of Spanish was gradual, creating a pidgin of Italian dialects and Spanish that was called &quot;cocoliche&quot;. Its usage declined around the 1950s. A phonetic study conducted by the Laboratory for Sensory Investigations of CONICET and the University of Toronto showed that the prosody of &quot;porteño&quot; is closer to the Neapolitan language of Italy than to any other spoken language. Many Spanish immigrants were from Galicia, and Spaniards are still generically referred to in Argentina as &quot;gallegos&quot; (Galicians). Galician language, cuisine and culture had a major presence in the city for most of the 20th century. In recent years, descendants of Galician immigrants have led a small boom in Celtic music (which also highlighted the Welsh traditions of Patagonia). Yiddish was commonly heard in Buenos Aires, especially in the Balvanera garment district and in Villa Crespo until the 1960s. Most of the newer immigrants learn Spanish quickly and assimilate into city life.

The &quot;Lunfardo&quot; argot originated within the prison population, and in time spread to all &quot;porteños&quot;. Lunfardo uses words from Italian dialects, from Brazilian Portuguese, from African and Caribbean languages and even from English. Lunfardo employs humorous tricks such as inverting the syllables within a word (vesre). Today, Lunfardo is mostly heard in tango lyrics; the slang of the younger generations has been evolving away from it. Buenos Aires was also the first city to host a Mundo Lingo event on 7 July 2011, which have been after replicated in up to 15 cities in 13 countries.

===Religion===
At the beginning of the twentieth century, Buenos Aires was the second-largest Catholic city in the world after Paris. Christianity is still the most prevalently practiced religion in Buenos Aires (~71.4%), a 2019 CONICET survey on religious beliefs and attitudes found that the inhabitants of the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (&quot;Área Metropolitana de Buenos Aires&quot;, AMBA) were 56.4% Catholic, 26.2% non-religious and 15% Evangelical; making it the region of the country with the highest proportion of irreligious people. A previous CONICET survey from 2008 had found that 69.1% were Catholic, 18% &quot;indifferent&quot;, 9.1% Evangelical, 1.4% Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses or Mormons and 2.3% adherents to other religions. The comparison between both surveys reveals that the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area is the region in which the decline of Catholicism was most pronounced during the last decade.

Buenos Aires is also home to the largest Jewish community in Latin America and the second largest in the Western Hemisphere after the United States. The Jewish community of Buenos Aires has historically been characterized by its high level of assimilation, organization and influence in the cultural history of the city.

Buenos Aires is the seat of a Roman Catholic metropolitan archbishop (the Catholic &quot;primate&quot; of Argentina), currently Archbishop Mario Poli. His predecessor, Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, was elected to the Papacy as Pope Francis on 13 March 2013. There are Protestant, Orthodox, Eastern Catholic, Buddhist and various other religious minorities as well.

===Education===


Primary education comprises grades 1–7. Most primary schools in the city still adhere to the traditional seven-year primary school, but kids can do grades 1–6 if their high school lasts 6 years, such as ORT Argentina. Secondary education in Argentina is called &quot;Polimodal&quot; (having multiple modes) since it allows the student to choose their orientation. Polimodal is usually 3 years of schooling, although some schools have a fourth year. Before entering the first year of polimodal, students choose an orientation from among five specializations. Some high schools depend on the University of Buenos Aires, and these require an admission course when students are taking the last year of high school. These high schools are ILSE, CNBA, Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini and Escuela de Educación Técnica Profesional en Producción Agropecuaria y Agroalimentaria (School of Professional Technique Education in Agricultural and Agrifood Production). The last two do have a specific orientation. In December 2006 the Chamber of Deputies of the Argentine Congress passed a new National Education Law restoring the old system of primary followed by secondary education, making secondary education obligatory and a right, and increasing the length of compulsory education to 13 years. The government vowed to put the law in effect gradually, starting in 2007.

There are many public universities in Argentina, as well as a number of private universities. The University of Buenos Aires, one of the top learning institutions in South America, has produced five Nobel Prize winners and provides taxpayer-funded education for students from all around the globe. Buenos Aires is a major center for psychoanalysis, particularly the Lacanian school. Buenos Aires is home to several private universities of different quality, such as: Universidad Argentina de la Empresa, Buenos Aires Institute of Technology, CEMA University, Favaloro University, Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina, University of Belgrano, University of Palermo, University of Salvador, Universidad Abierta Interamericana, Universidad Argentina John F. Kennedy, Universidad de Ciencias Empresariales y Sociales, Universidad del Museo Social Argentino, Universidad Austral, Universidad CAECE and Torcuato di Tella University.

In April 2024, thousands of protesters, including professors and students, gathered on the streets of Buenos Aires and other cities to demand President Javier Milei increased funding for higher education.

==Economy==


Buenos Aires is the financial, industrial, and commercial hub of Argentina. The economy in the city proper alone, measured by gross geographic product (adjusted for purchasing power), totaled US$102.7 billion (US$34,200 per capita) in 2020 and amounts to nearly a quarter of Argentina&#x27;s as a whole. Metro Buenos Aires, according to one well-quoted study, constitutes the 13th largest economy among the world&#x27;s cities in 2005. The Buenos Aires Human Development Index (0.889 in 2019) is likewise high by international standards.

The city&#x27;s services sector is diversified and well-developed by international standards, and accounts for 76 percent of its economy (compared to 59% for all of Argentina&#x27;s). Advertising, in particular, plays a prominent role in the export of services at home and abroad. However, the financial and real estate services sector is the largest and contributes to 31 percent of the city&#x27;s economy. Finance (about a third of this) in Buenos Aires is especially important to Argentina&#x27;s banking system, accounting for nearly half the nation&#x27;s bank deposits and lending. Nearly 300 hotels and another 300 hostels and bed &amp; breakfasts are licensed for tourism, and nearly half the rooms available were in four-star establishments or higher.

Manufacturing is, nevertheless, still prominent in the city&#x27;s economy (16 percent) and, concentrated mainly in the southern part of the city. It benefits as much from high local purchasing power and a large local supply of skilled labor as it does from its relationship to massive agriculture and industry just outside the city limits. Construction activity in Buenos Aires has historically been among the most accurate indicators of national economic fortunes, and since 2006 around of construction has been authorized annually. Meat, dairy, grain, tobacco, wool and leather products are processed or manufactured in the Buenos Aires metro area. Other leading industries are automobile manufacturing, oil refining, metalworking, machine-building, and the production of textiles, chemicals, clothing and beverages.

The city&#x27;s budget, per Mayor Macri&#x27;s 2011 proposal, included US$6 billion in revenues and US$6.3 billion in expenditures. The city relies on local income and capital gains taxes for 61 percent of its revenues, while federal revenue sharing contributes 11 percent, property taxes, 9 percent, and vehicle taxes, 6 percent. Other revenues include user fees, fines, and gambling duties. The city devotes 26 percent of its budget to education, 22 percent for health, 17 percent for public services and infrastructure, 16 percent for social welfare and culture, 12 percent in administrative costs and 4 percent for law enforcement. Buenos Aires maintains low debt levels and its service requires less than 3 percent of the budget.

===Tourism===


According to the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council, tourism has been growing in the Argentine capital since 2002. In a survey by the travel and tourism publication Travel + Leisure Magazine in 2008, visitors voted Buenos Aires the second most desirable city to visit after Florence, Italy. In 2008, an estimated 2.5 million visitors visited the city. Buenos Aires is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.

Visitors have many options for travel such as going to a tango show, an estancia in the Province of Buenos Aires or enjoying the traditional asado. New tourist circuits have recently evolved, devoted to Argentines such as Carlos Gardel, Eva Perón or Jorge Luis Borges. Before 2011, due to the Argentine peso&#x27;s favorable exchange rate, its shopping centers such as Alto Palermo, Paseo Alcorta, Patio Bullrich, Abasto de Buenos Aires and Galerías Pacífico were frequently visited by tourists. Nowadays, the exchange rate has hampered tourism and shopping in particular. In fact, notable consumer brands such as Burberry and Louis Vuitton have abandoned the country due to the exchange rate and import restrictions. The city also plays host to musical festivals, some of the largest of which are Quilmes Rock, Creamfields BA, Ultra Music Festival (Buenos Aires), and the Buenos Aires Jazz Festival.
The most popular tourist sites are found in the historic core of the city, specifically, in the Montserrat and San Telmo neighborhoods. Buenos Aires was conceived around the Plaza de Mayo, the colony&#x27;s administrative center. To the east of the square is the &quot;Casa Rosada&quot;, the official seat of the executive branch of the government of Argentina. To the north, the &quot;Catedral Metropolitana&quot; which has stood in the same location since colonial times, and the Banco de la Nación Argentina building, a parcel of land originally owned by Juan de Garay. Other important colonial institutions were Cabildo, to the west, which was renovated during the construction of Avenida de Mayo and Julio A. Roca. To the south is the &quot;Congreso de la Nación&quot; (National Congress), which currently houses the &quot;Academia Nacional de la Historia&quot; (National Academy of History). Lastly, to the northwest, is City Hall.
Buenos Aires has become a recipient of LGBT tourism, due to the existence of some gay-friendly sites and the legalization of same-sex marriage on 15 July 2010, making it the first country in Latin America, the second in the Americas, and the tenth in the world to do so. Its &quot;Gender Identity Law&quot;, passed in 2012, made Argentina the &quot;only country that allows people to change their gender identities without facing barriers such as hormone therapy, surgery or psychiatric diagnosis that labels them as having an abnormality&quot;. In 2015, the World Health Organization cited Argentina as an exemplary country for providing transgender rights. Despite these legal advances, however, homophobia continues to be a hotly contested social issue in the city and the country.

Buenos Aires has various types of accommodation ranging from luxurious five star hotels in the city center to budget hotels located in suburban neighborhoods. Nonetheless, the city&#x27;s transportation system allows easy and inexpensive access to the city. There were, , 23 five-star, 61 four-star, 59 three-star and 87 two or one-star hotels, as well as 25 boutique hotels and 39 apart-hotels; another 298 hostels, bed &amp; breakfasts, vacation rentals and other non-hotel establishments were registered in the city. In all, nearly 27,000 rooms were available for tourism in Buenos Aires, of which about 12,000 belonged to four-star, five-star, or boutique hotels. Establishments of a higher category typically enjoy the city&#x27;s highest occupation rates. The majority of the hotels are located in the central part of the city, in close proximity to most main tourist attractions.

==Transportation==
According to data released by Moovit in July 2017, the average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Buenos Aires, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 79 min. 23% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 20 percent of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is , while 21% travel for over .

===Roads===
Buenos Aires is based on a rectangular grid pattern, save for natural barriers or the relatively rare developments explicitly designed otherwise (most notably, the Parque Chas neighborhood). The rectangular grid provides for -long square blocks named &quot;manzanas&quot;. Pedestrian zones in the central business district such as Florida Street are partially car-free and always bustling, access provided by bus and the Underground (subte) Line C. Buenos Aires, for the most part, is a very walkable city and the majority of residents in Buenos Aires use public transport.

Two diagonal avenues alleviate traffic and provide better access to Plaza de Mayo and the city center in general; most avenues running into and out of it are one-way and feature six or more lanes, with computer-controlled green waves to speed up traffic outside of peak times. The city&#x27;s principal avenues include the -wide July 9 Avenue, the over -long Rivadavia Avenue, and Corrientes Avenue, the main thoroughfare of culture and entertainment.

In the 1940s and 1950s, the construction of the General Paz Avenue beltway that surrounds the city along its border with Buenos Aires Province, and the freeways leading to the new international airport and to the northern suburbs, heralded a new era for Buenos Aires traffic. Encouraged by pro-automaker policies that were pursued towards the end of the Perón (1955) and Frondizi administrations (1958–62) in particular, auto sales nationally grew from an average of 30,000 during the 1920–57 era to around 250,000 in the 1970s and over 600,000 in 2008. Today, over 1.8 million vehicles (nearly one-fifth of Argentina&#x27;s total) are registered in Buenos Aires.

Toll motorways opened in the late 1970s by mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore, now used by over a million vehicles daily, provide convenient access to the city center. Cacciatore likewise had financial district streets (roughly in area) closed to private cars during daytime. Most major avenues are, however, gridlocked at peak hours. Following the economic mini-boom of the 1990s, record numbers started commuting by car and congestion increased, as did the time-honored Argentine custom of taking weekends off in the countryside.

===Airports===

The Ministro Pistarini International Airport, commonly known as Ezeiza Airport, is located in the suburb of Ezeiza, in Buenos Aires Province, approximately south of the city. This airport handles most international air traffic to and from Argentina as well as some domestic flights.

The Aeroparque Jorge Newbery airport, located in the Palermo district of the city next to the riverbank, is the only one within the city limits and serves primarily domestic traffic within Argentina and some regional flights to neighboring South American countries.

Other minor airports near the city are El Palomar Airport, which is located west of the city and handles some scheduled domestic flights to a number of destinations in Argentina, and the smaller San Fernando Airport which serves only general aviation.

===Urban rail===


The Buenos Aires Underground (locally known as &quot;subte&quot;, from &quot;subterráneo&quot; meaning underground or subway), is a high-yield system providing access to various parts of the city. Opened in 1913, it is the oldest underground system in the Southern Hemisphere and oldest in the Spanish-speaking world. The system has six underground lines and one overground line, named by letters (A to E, and H) and there are 107 stations, and of route, including the Premetro line. An expansion program is underway to extend existing lines into the outer neighborhoods and add a new north–south line. Route length is expected to reach by 2011.

Line A is the oldest one (service opened to public in 1913) and stations kept the &quot;belle-époque&quot; decoration, while the original rolling stock from 1913, affectionately known as &quot;Las Brujas&quot; were retired from the line in 2013. Daily ridership on weekdays is 1.7 million and on the increase. Fares remain relatively cheap, although the city government raised fares by over 125% in January 2012. A single journey, with unlimited interchanges between lines, costs AR$42, which is roughly US$0.23 as of January 2023.

The most recent expansions to the network were the addition of numerous stations to the network in 2013: San José de Flores and San Pedrito to Line A, Echeverría and Juan Manuel de Rosas to Line B and Hospitales to Line H. Current works include the completion of Line H northwards and addition of three new stations to Line E in the city center. The construction of Line F is due to commence in 2015, while two other lines are planned for construction in the future.

The Buenos Aires commuter rail system has seven lines: Belgrano Norte; Belgrano Sur; Roca; San Martín; Sarmiento; Mitre; and Urquiza. The Buenos Aires commuter network system is very extensive: every day more than 1.3 million people commute to the Argentine capital. These suburban trains operate between 4 am and 1 am. The Buenos Aires commuter rail network also connects the city with long-distance rail services to Rosario and Córdoba, among other metropolitan areas. The city center is home to four principal terminals for both long-distance and local passenger services: Constitucion, Retiro, Federico Lacroze and Once. In addition, Buenos Aires station serves as a minor terminus.
Commuter rail in the city is mostly operated by the state-owned Trenes Argentinos, though the Urquiza Line and Belgrano Norte Line are operated by private companies Metrovías and Ferrovías respectively. All services had been operated by Ferrocarriles Argentinos until the company&#x27;s privatization in 1993, and were then operated by a series of private companies until the lines were put back under state control following a series of high-profile accidents.

Since 2013, there has been a series of large investments on the network, with all lines (with the exception of the Urquiza Line) receiving new rolling stock, along with widespread infrastructure improvements, track replacement, electrification work, refurbishments of stations and building entirely new stations. Similarly, almost all level crossings have been replaced by underpasses and overpasses in the city, with plans to replace all of them in the near future. One of the most major projects under way is the electrification of the remaining segments of the Roca Line – the most widely used in the network – and also moving the entire section of the Sarmiento Line which runs through the heart of the city&#x27;s underground to allow for better frequencies on the line and reduce congestion above ground.

There are also three other major projects on the table. The first would elevate a large segment of the San Martín Line which runs through the city center and electrify the line, while the second would see the electrification and extension of the Belgrano Sur Line to Constitucion station in the city center. If these two projects are completed, then the Belgrano Norte Line would be the only diesel line to run through the city. The third and most ambitious is to build a series of tunnels between three of the city&#x27;s railway terminals with a large underground central station underneath the Obelisk, connecting all the commuter railway lines in a network dubbed the Red de Expresos Regionales.
Buenos Aires had an extensive tram system with over of track, which was dismantled during the 1960s after the advent of bus transportation, but surface rail transport has made a small comeback in some parts of the city. The PreMetro or Line E2 is a light rail line that connects with Underground Line E at Plaza de los Virreyes station and runs to General Savio and Centro Cívico. It is operated by Metrovías. The official inauguration took place on 27 August 1987. A long modern tramway, the Tranvía del Este, opened in 2007 in the Puerto Madero district, initially using two tramcars on temporary loan from Mulhouse, then later a tramcar from Madrid. However, plans to extend the line and acquire a fleet of trams did not come to fruition, and declining patronage led to the line&#x27;s closure in October 2012. A heritage streetcar maintained by tram fans operates on weekends, near the Primera Junta line A Underground station in the neighborhood of Caballito.

===Cycling===
In December 2010, the city government launched a bicycle sharing program with bicycles free for hire by users upon registration. Located in mostly central areas, there are 31 rental stations throughout the city providing over 850 bicycles to be picked up and dropped off at any station within an hour. , the city has constructed of protected bicycle lanes and has plans to construct another . In 2015, the stations were automated and the service became 24 hours through use of a smart card or mobile phone application.

===Buses===

There are over 150 city bus lines called &quot;Colectivos&quot;, each one managed by an individual company. These compete with each other and attract exceptionally high use with virtually no public financial support. Their frequency makes them equal to the underground systems of other cities, but buses cover a far wider area than the underground system. Colectivos in Buenos Aires do not have a fixed timetable, but run from four to several per hour, depending on the bus line and time of the day. With inexpensive tickets and extensive routes, usually no further than four blocks from commuters&#x27; residences, the colectivo is the most popular mode of transport around the city.

Buenos Aires has recently opened a bus rapid transit system, the Metrobus. The system uses modular median stations that serve both directions of travel, which enable pre-paid, multiple-door, level boarding. The first line, opened on 31 May 2011, runs across the Juan B. Justo Ave has 21 stations. The system now has 4 lines with 113 stations on its network, while numerous other lines are under construction and planned.

===Port===
The port of Buenos Aires is one of the busiest in South America, as navigable rivers by way of the Rio de la Plata connect the port to northeastern Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. As a result, it serves as the distribution hub for said vast area of the South American continent. The Port of Buenos Aires handles over annually, and Dock Sud, just south of the city proper, handles another . Tax collection related to the port has caused many political problems in the past, including a conflict in 2008 that led to protests and a strike in the agricultural sector after the government raised export tariffs.

===Ferries===

Buenos Aires is also served by a ferry system operated by the company Buquebus that connects the port of Buenos Aires with the main cities of Uruguay, (Colonia del Sacramento, Montevideo and Punta del Este). More than 2.2 million people per year travel between Argentina and Uruguay with Buquebus. One of these ships is a catamaran, which can reach a top speed of about .

===Taxis===
A fleet of 40,000 black-and-yellow taxis ply the streets at all hours. Some taxi drivers may try to take advantage of tourists., but radio-link companies provide reliable and safe service; many such companies provide incentives for frequent users. Low-fare limo services, known as &quot;remises&quot;, are also popular. though currently giving way to ridesharing companies like Uber or Cabify, whose legal status has been the cause of much dispute with the city government

==Culture==
As Buenos Aires is strongly influenced by European culture, the city is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Paris of South America&quot;. With its scores of theaters and productions, the city has the busiest live theater industry in South America. In fact, every weekend, there are about 300 active theaters with plays, a number that places the city as 1st worldwide, more than either London, New York or Paris, cultural Meccas in themselves. The number of cultural festivals with more than 10 sites and five years of existence also places the city as 2nd worldwide, after Edinburgh. The Palacio Libertad, located in Buenos Aires, is the largest cultural center of Latin America, and the third worldwide.

Buenos Aires is the home of the Teatro Colón, an internationally rated opera house. There are several symphony orchestras and choral societies. The city has numerous museums related to arts and crafts, history, fine arts, modern arts, decorative arts, popular arts, sacred art, theater and popular music, as well as the preserved homes of noted art collectors, writers, composers and artists. The city is home to hundreds of bookstores, public libraries and cultural associations (it is sometimes called &quot;the city of books&quot;), as well as the largest concentration of active theaters in Latin America. It has a zoo and botanical garden, a large number of landscaped parks and squares, as well as churches and places of worship of many denominations, many of which are architecturally noteworthy.

The city has been a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network after it was named &quot;City of Design&quot; in 2005.

===Art===


Buenos Aires has a thriving arts culture, with &quot;a huge inventory of museums, ranging from obscure to world-class.&quot; The &quot;barrios&quot; of Palermo and Recoleta are the city&#x27;s traditional bastions in the diffusion of art, although in recent years there has been a tendency of appearance of exhibition venues in other districts such as Puerto Madero or La Boca; renowned venues include MALBA, the National Museum of Fine Arts, Fundación Proa, Faena Arts Center, and the Usina del Arte. Other popular institutions are the Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art, the Benito Quinquela Martín Museum, the Evita Museum, the Museo de Arte Hispanoamericano Isaac Fernández Blanco, the José Hernández Museum, and the Palais de Glace, among others. A traditional event that occurs once a year is &quot;La Noche de los Museos&quot; (&quot;Night of the Museums&quot;), when the city&#x27;s museums, universities, and artistic spaces open their doors for free until early morning; it usually takes place in November.

The first major artistic movements in Argentina coincided with the first signs of political liberty in the country, such as the 1913 sanction of the secret ballot and universal male suffrage, the first president to be popularly elected (1916), and the cultural revolution that involved the University Reform of 1918. In this context, in which there continued to be influence from the Paris School (Modigliani, Chagall, Soutine, Klee), three main groups arose. Buenos Aires has been the birthplace of several artists and movements of national and international relevance and has become a central motif in Argentine artistic production, especially since the 20th century. 
Examples include: the Paris Group – so named for being influenced by the School of Paris – constituted by Antonio Berni, Aquiles Badi, Lino Enea Spilimbergo, Raquel Forner and Alfredo Bigatti, among others; and the La Boca artists – including Benito Quinquela Martín and Alfredo Lazzari, among others – who mostly came from Italy or were of Italian descent, and usually painted scenes from working-class port neighborhoods. During the 1960s, the Torcuato di Tella Institute – located in Florida Street – became a leading local center for pop art, performance art, installation art, conceptual art, and experimental theater; this generation of artists included Marta Minujín, Dalila Puzzovio, David Lamelas, Clorindo Testa and Diana Dowek.

Buenos Aires has also become a prominent center of contemporary street art; its welcoming attitude has made it one of the world&#x27;s top capitals of such expression. The city&#x27;s turbulent modern political history has &quot;bred an intense sense of expression in &quot;porteños&quot;&quot;, and urban art has been used to depict these stories and as a means of protest. However, not all of its street art concerns politics, it is also used as a symbol of democracy and freedom of expression. Murals and graffiti are so common that they are considered &quot;an everyday occurrence,&quot; and have become part of the urban landscape of &quot;barrios&quot; such as Palermo, Villa Urquiza, Coghlan and San Telmo. This has to do with the legality of such activities —provided that the building owner has consented—, and the receptiveness of local authorities, who even subsidize various works. The abundance of places for urban artists to create their work, and the relatively lax rules for street art, have attracted international artists such as Blu, Jef Aérosol, Aryz, ROA, and Ron English. Guided tours to see murals and graffiti around the city have been growing steadily.

===Literature===
Buenos Aires has long been considered an intellectual and literary capital of Latin America and the Spanish-speaking world. Despite its short urban history, Buenos Aires has an abundant literary production; its mythical-literary network &quot;has grown at the same rate at which the streets of the city earned its shores to the pampas and buildings stretched its shadow on the curb.&quot; During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culture boomed along with the economy and the city emerged as a literary capital and the seat of South America&#x27;s most powerful publishing industry, and &quot;even if the economic path grew rocky, ordinary Argentines embraced and stuck to the habit of reading.&quot; By the 1930s, Buenos Aires was the undisputed literary capital of the Spanish-speaking world, with Victoria Ocampo founding the highly influential &quot;Sur&quot; magazine—which dominated Spanish-language literature for thirty years— and the arrival of prominent Spanish writers and editors who were escaping the civil war.

Buenos Aires is one of the most prolific book publishers in Latin America and has more bookstores per capita than any other major city in the world. Buenos Aires has at least 734 bookstores—roughly 25 bookshops for every 100,000 inhabitants—far above other world cities like London, Paris, Madrid, Moscow and New York. The city also has a thriving market for secondhand books, ranking third in terms of secondhand bookshops per inhabitant, most of them congregated along Avenida Corrientes. Buenos Aires&#x27; book market has been described as &quot;catholic in taste, immune to fads or fashion&quot;, with &quot;wide and varied demand.&quot; The popularity of reading among &quot;porteños&quot; has been variously linked to the wave of mass immigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and to the city&#x27;s &quot;obsession&quot; with psychoanalysis.

The Buenos Aires International Book Fair has been a major event in the city since the first fair in 1975, having been described as &quot;perhaps the most important and largest annual literary event in the Spanish-speaking world,&quot; and &quot;the most important cultural event in Latin America&quot;. In its 2019 edition, the Book Fair was attended by 1.8 million people.

Buenos Aires was designated as the World Book Capital for the year 2011 by UNESCO.

===Music===


According to the &quot;Harvard Dictionary of Music&quot;, &quot;Argentina has one of the richest art music traditions and perhaps the most active contemporary musical life&quot; in South America. Buenos Aires boasts of several professional orchestras, including the Argentine National Symphony Orchestra, the Ensamble Musical de Buenos Aires and the Camerata Bariloche; as well as various conservatories that offer professional music education, like the Conservatorio Nacional Superior de Música. As a result of the growth and commercial prosperity of the city in the late 18th century, theater became a vital force in Argentine musical life, offering Italian and French operas and Spanish zarzuelas. Italian music was very influential during the 19th century and the early 20th century, in part because of immigration, but operas and salon music were also composed by Argentines, including Francisco Hargreaves and Juan Gutiérrez. A nationalist trend that drew from Argentine traditions, literature and folk music was an important force during the 19th century, including composers Alberto Williams, Julián Aguirre, Arturo Berutti and Felipe Boero. In the 1930s, composers such as Juan Carlos Paz and Alberto Ginastera &quot;began to espouse a cosmopolitan and modernist style, influenced by twelve-tone techniques and serialism&quot;; while avant-garde music thrived by the 1960s, with the Rockefeller Foundation financing the Centro Interamericano de Altos Estudios Musicales, which brought internationally famous composers to work and teach in Buenos Aires, also establishing an electronic music studio.
The Río de la Plata is known for being the birthplace of tango, which is considered an emblem of Buenos Aires. The city considers itself the Tango World Capital, and as such hosts many related events, the most important being an annual festival and world tournament. The most important exponent of the genre is Carlos Gardel, followed by Aníbal Troilo; other important composers include Alfredo Gobbi, Ástor Piazzolla, Osvaldo Pugliese, Mariano Mores, Juan D&#x27;Arienzo and Juan Carlos Cobián. Tango music experienced a period of splendor during the 1940s, while in the 1960s and 1970s nuevo tango appeared, incorporating elements of classical and jazz music. A contemporary trend is neotango (also known as electrotango), with exponents such as Bajofondo and Gotan Project. On 30 September 2009, UNESCO&#x27;s Intergovernmental Committee of Intangible Heritage declared tango part of the world&#x27;s cultural heritage, making Argentina eligible to receive financial assistance in safeguarding tango for future generations.

The city hosts several music festivals every year. A popular genre is electronic dance music, with festivals including Creamfields BA, SAMC, Moonpark, and a local edition of Ultra Music Festival. Other well-known events include the Buenos Aires Jazz Festival, Personal Fest, Quilmes Rock and Pepsi Music. Some music festivals are held in Greater Buenos Aires, like Lollapalooza, which takes place at the Hipódromo de San Isidro in San Isidro.

===Cinema===


Argentine cinema history began in Buenos Aires with the first film exhibition on 18 July 1896 at the Teatro Odeón. With his 1897 film, &quot;La bandera Argentina&quot;, Eugène Py became one of the first filmmakers of the country; the film features a waving Argentine flag located at Plaza de Mayo. In the early 20th century, the first movie theaters of the country opened in Buenos Aires, and newsreels appeared, most notably &quot;El Viaje de Campos Salles a Buenos Aires&quot;. The real industry emerged with the advent of sound films, the first one being &quot;Muñequitas porteñas&quot; (1931). The newly founded Argentina Sono Film released &quot;¡Tango!&quot; in 1933, the first integral sound production in the country. During the 1930s and the 1940s (commonly referred as the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Argentine cinema), many films revolved around the city of Buenos Aires and tango culture, reflected in titles such as &quot;La vida es un tango&quot;, &quot;El alma del bandoneón&quot;, &quot;Adiós Buenos Aires&quot;, &quot;El Cantor de Buenos Aires&quot; and &quot;Buenos Aires canta&quot;. Argentine films were exported across Latin America, specially Libertad Lamarque&#x27;s melodramas, and the comedies of Luis Sandrini and Niní Marshall. The popularity of local cinema in the Spanish-speaking world played a key role in the massification of tango music. Carlos Gardel, an iconic figure of tango and Buenos Aires, became an international star by starring in several films during that era.

In response to large studio productions, the &quot;Generation of the 60s&quot; appeared, a group of filmmakers that produced the first modernist films in Argentina during the early years of that decade. These included Manuel Antín, Lautaro Murúa and René Mugica, among others. 
During the second half of the decade, films of social protest were presented in clandestine exhibitions, the work of Grupo Cine Liberación and Grupo Cine de la Base, who advocated what they called &quot;Third Cinema&quot;. At that time, the country was under a military dictatorship after the coup d&#x27;état known as Argentine Revolution. One of the most notable films of this movement is (1968) by Fernando Solanas. During the period of democracy between 1973 and 1975, the local cinema experienced critical and commercial success, with titles including &quot;Juan Moreira&quot; (1973), &quot;La Patagonia rebelde&quot; (1974), &quot;La Raulito&quot; (1975), and &quot;La tregua&quot; (1974) – which became the first Argentine film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. However, because of censorship and a new military government, Argentine cinema stalled until the return of democracy in the 1980s. This generation – known as &quot;Argentine Cinema in Liberty and Democracy&quot; – were mostly young or postponed filmmakers and gained international notoriety. &quot;Camila&quot; (1984) by María Luisa Bemberg was nominated for the Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards, and Luis Puenzo&#x27;s &quot;La historia oficial&quot; (1985) was the first Argentine film to receive the award.

Located in Buenos Aires is the Pablo Ducrós Hicken Museum of Cinema, the only one in the country dedicated to Argentine cinema and a pioneer of its kind in Latin America. Every year, the city hosts the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema (BAFICI), which, in its 2015 edition, featured 412 films from 37 countries, and an attendance of 380 thousand people. Buenos Aires also hosts various other festivals and film cycles, like the Buenos Aires Rojo Sangre, devoted to horror.

===Media===

Buenos Aires is home to five Argentine television networks: America, Television Pública Argentina, El Nueve, Telefe, and El Trece. Four of them are located in Buenos Aires, and the studios of America is located in La Plata.

===Fashion===
Buenos Aires&#x27; inhabitants have been historically characterized as &quot;fashion-conscious&quot;. National designers display their collections annually at the Buenos Aires Fashion Week (BAFWEEK) and related events. Inevitably being a season behind, it fails to receive much international attention. Nevertheless, the city remains an important regional fashion capital. According to Global Language Monitor, the city is the 20th leading fashion capital in the world, ranking second in Latin America after Rio de Janeiro. In 2005, Buenos Aires was appointed as the first UNESCO City of Design, and received this title once again in 2007. Since 2015, the Buenos Aires International Fashion Film Festival Buenos Aires (BAIFFF) takes place, sponsored by the city and Mercedes-Benz. The government of the city also organizes La Ciudad de Moda (&quot;The City of Fashion&quot;), an annual event that serves as a platform for emerging creators and attempts to boost the sector by providing management tools.

The fashionable neighborhood of Palermo, particularly the area known as Soho, is where the latest fashion and design trends are presented. The &quot;sub-barrio&quot; of Palermo Viejo is also a popular port of call for fashion in the city. An increasing number of young, independent designers are also setting up their own shops in Bohemian San Telmo, known for its wide variety of markets and antique shops. Recoleta, on the other hand, is the epicenter of branches of exclusive and upscale fashion houses. In particular, Avenida Alvear is home to the most exclusive representatives of haute couture in the city.

===Architecture===
Buenos Aires architecture is characterized by its eclectic nature, with elements resembling Paris and Madrid. There is a mix, due to immigration, of Colonial, Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Neo-Gothic, and French Bourbon styles. Italian and French influences increased after the declaration of independence at the beginning of the 19th century, although the academic style persisted until the first decades of the 20th century. Attempts at renovation took place during the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, when European influences penetrated into the country, reflected by several buildings of Buenos Aires such as the Iglesia Santa Felicitas by Ernesto Bunge; the Palace of Justice, the National Congress, all of them by Vittorio Meano, and the Teatro Colón, by Francesco Tamburini and Vittorio Meano. The simplicity of the &quot;Rioplatense&quot; baroque style is evident in Buenos Aires through the works of Italian architects such as André Blanqui and Antonio Masella, in the churches of San Ignacio, Nuestra Señora del Pilar, the Cathedral and the Cabildo.
In 1912, the Basilica del Santisimo Sacramento was opened to the public; its construction was funded by the generous donation of Argentine philanthropist Mercedes Castellanos de Anchorena, a member of Argentina&#x27;s most prominent family. The church is an excellent example of French neo-classicism. With extremely high-grade decorations in its interior, the magnificent Mutin-Cavaillé coll organ (the biggest ever installed in an Argentine church with more than four thousand tubes and four manuals) presided the nave. The altar is full of marble and was the biggest ever built in South America at that time.

In 1919, the construction of Palacio Barolo began. This was South America&#x27;s tallest building at the time and was the first Argentine skyscraper built with concrete (1919–1923). The building was equipped with 9 elevators, plus a lobby hall with paintings in the ceiling and Latin phrases embossed in golden bronze letters. A 300,000-candela beacon was installed at the top (110 m), making the building visible even from Uruguay. In 2009, the Barolo Palace went under an exhaustive restoration, and the beacon was made operational again.

In 1936, the Kavanagh Building was inaugurated. The building, with its 12 elevators (provided by Otis) and the world&#x27;s first central air conditioning system (provided by the North American company Carrier), is still an architectural landmark in Buenos Aires.
The architecture of the second half of the 19th century continued to reproduce French neoclassic models, such as the headquarters of the Banco de la Nación Argentina built by Alejandro Bustillo, and the Museo Hispanoamericano de Buenos Aires of Martín Noel. However, since the 1930s, the influence of Le Corbusier and European rationalism consolidated in a group of young architects from the University of Tucumán, among whom Amancio Williams stands out. The construction of skyscrapers proliferated in Buenos Aires until the 1950s. Newer modern high-technology buildings by Argentine architects in the last years of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st include the Le Parc Tower by Mario Álvarez, the Torre Fortabat by Sánchez Elía, and the Repsol-YPF Tower by César Pelli.

===Theaters===

It is in the heart of the city on a site once occupied by Ferrocarril Oeste&#x27;s &quot;Plaza Parque&quot; station.
*Cervantes Theater (Teatro Nacional Cervantes), located on Córdoba Avenue and two blocks north of Buenos Aires&#x27; renowned opera house, the Colón Theater, the Cervantes houses three performance halls, of which the María Guerrero Salon serves as its main hall. Its stage features a rotating circular platform and can be extended by a further . The Guerrero Salon can seat 860 spectators, including 512 in the galleries. A secondary hall, the Orestes Caviglia Salon, can seat 150 and is mostly reserved for chamber music concerts. The Luisa Vehíl Salon is a multipurpose room known for its extensive gold leaf decor.
*Teatro Gran Rex opened on 8 July 1937 as the largest cinema in South America of its time; it is an Art Deco-style theater.
*Teatro Avenida (Avenida Theater) was inaugurated on Buenos Aires&#x27; central Avenida de Mayo in 1908 with a production of Spanish dramatist Lope de Vega&#x27;s &quot;Justice Without Revenge&quot;. The production was directed by María Guerrero, a Spanish Argentine theater director who popularized classical drama in Argentina during the late 19th century and would establish the important Cervantes Theater (Teatro Nacional Cervantes) in 1921.

===Sports===
Buenos Aires has been a candidate city for the Summer Olympic Games on three occasions: for the 1956 Games, which were lost by a single vote to Melbourne; for the 1968 Summer Olympics, held in Mexico City; and in 2004, when the games were awarded to Athens.

In 1912, the practice of basketball in Argentina was started by the &quot;Asociación Cristiana de Jóvenes (YMCA)&quot; of Buenos Aires, when Canadian professor Paul Phillip was in charge of teaching basketball at the YMCA of Paseo Colón Avenue. The first basketball clubs in Argentina, Hindú and Independiente, were located at the YMCAs of the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area. By 1912 the first basketball games were held by YMCA headquarters in Buenos Aires. Nowadays, the Argentine Basketball Confederation is headquartered in Buenos Aires.

<text>The 1981 South African rugby tour (known in New Zealand as the 1981 Springbok Tour, and in South Africa as the Rebel Tour) polarised opinions and inspired widespread protests across New Zealand. The controversy also extended to the United States, where the South African rugby team continued their tour after departing New Zealand.

Apartheid had made South Africa an international pariah, and other countries were strongly discouraged from having sporting contacts with it. Rugby union was (and is) an extremely popular sport in New Zealand, and the South African national team, known as the Springboks, were considered to be New Zealand&#x27;s most formidable opponents. Therefore, there was a major split in opinion in New Zealand as to whether politics should influence sport in this way and whether the Springboks should be allowed to tour.

Despite the controversy, the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) decided to proceed with the tour. The government of Prime Minister Robert Muldoon was called on to ban it, but decided that commitments under the Gleneagles Agreement did not require the government to prevent the tour, and decided not to interfere due to their public position of &quot;no politics in sport&quot;. Major protests ensued, aiming to make clear many New Zealanders&#x27; opposition to apartheid and, if possible, to stop the matches taking place. This was successful at two games, but also had the effect of creating a law and order issue: whether a group of protesters could be allowed to prevent a lawful game taking place.

The dispute was similar to that involving Peter Hain in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s, when Hain&#x27;s Stop the Tour campaign clashed with the more conservative &#x27;Freedom Under Law&#x27; movement championed by barrister Francis Bennion. The allegedly excessive police response to the protests also became a focus of controversy. Although the protests were among the most intense in New Zealand&#x27;s recent history, no deaths or serious injuries resulted.

After the tour, no official sporting contact took place between New Zealand and South Africa until the early 1990s, after apartheid had been abolished. The tour has been said to have led to a decline in the popularity of rugby union in New Zealand, until the 1987 Rugby World Cup.

== Background ==

The Springboks and New Zealand&#x27;s national rugby team, the All Blacks, have a long tradition of intense and friendly sporting rivalry. From 1948 to 1969, the South African apartheid regime affected team selection for the All Blacks, with selectors passing over Māori players for some All Black tours to South Africa. Opposition to sending race-based teams to South Africa grew throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and prior to the All Blacks&#x27; tour of South Africa in 1960, 150,000 New Zealanders – 6.25% of the country&#x27;s population at that time – signed a petition supporting a policy of &quot;No Maoris, No Tour&quot;. Despite this, the tour went ahead, and in 1969, Halt All Racist Tours (HART) was formed.

During the 1970s, public protests and political pressure forced on the NZRFU the choice of either fielding a team not selected by race, or not touring South Africa: after South African rugby authorities continued to select Springbok players by race, the Norman Kirk Labour Government barred the Springboks from touring New Zealand in 1973. In response, the NZRFU protested about the involvement of &quot;politics in sport&quot;.

On 28 March 1976, the final game of ex-All Black Fergie McCormick was played at Lancaster Park in Christchurch, to which two Springbok players had been invited. Ten days before the game, protesters had written &quot;WELCOME TO RACIST GAME&quot; in 20-foot high letters on the pitch using weed-killer.

The All Blacks toured South Africa in 1976 with the blessing of the newly elected New Zealand prime minister, Robert Muldoon. In response, twenty-five African nations boycotted the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, stating that in their view the All Blacks tour gave tacit support to the apartheid regime in South Africa: the IOC declined to ban New Zealand from the Olympics on the grounds that rugby union was no longer an Olympic sport. The tour attracted several anti-apartheid protests in New Zealand, including one on 28 May 1976 in Cathedral Square, Christchurch which attracted 1000–1500 people and included guerrilla theatre. Protesters also attempted to disrupt television coverage of the first test by vandalising the Makara Hill microwave station in Wellington, which was responsible for relaying programming in and out of TV One&#x27;s Avalon studios.

The 1976 tour contributed to the creation of the Gleneagles Agreement that was adopted by the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 1977.

== Tour of New Zealand ==
By the early 1980s, the pressure from other countries and from protest groups in New Zealand such as HART reached a head when the NZRFU proposed a Springbok tour for 1981. This became a topic of political contention due to the international sports boycott. After the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, refused permission for the Springboks&#x27; aircraft to refuel in Australia, the Springboks&#x27; flights to and from New Zealand went via Los Angeles and Hawaii.

Despite pressure for the Muldoon government to cancel the tour, permission was granted for it, and the Springboks arrived in New Zealand on 19 July 1981. Since 1977 Muldoon&#x27;s government had been a party to the Gleneagles Agreement, in which the countries of the Commonwealth accepted that it was:
the urgent duty of each of their Governments vigorously to combat the evil of apartheid by withholding any form of support for, and by taking every practical step to discourage contact or competition by their nationals with sporting organisations, teams or sportsmen from South Africa or from any other country where sports are organised on the basis of race, colour or ethnic origin.

Despite this, Muldoon also argued that New Zealand was a free and democratic country, and that &quot;politics should stay out of sport.&quot; In the years following the Gleneagles Agreement, it seemed that New Zealand government members did not feel bound to the Gleneagles agreement, and disregarded it. However, some historians claim that, &quot;the [Gleneagles] agreement remained vague enough to avoid the New Zealand government from having to use coercive powers such as withdrawing visas and passports.&quot; This means Muldoon&#x27;s government technically was not bound to the agreement to the extent it outwardly appeared to the public. In addition to this, Ben Couch, who was the minister for Māori development at the time, stated, &quot;I believe that the Gleneagles agreement has been forced upon us by people who do not have the same kind of democracy that we have.&quot;

Muldoon made some effort to discourage the tour and stated that he could see &quot;nothing but trouble coming from this.&quot; &quot;A Springbok tour would dash to the ground all that has been achieved as a result of international acceptance&quot;, wrote deputy Prime Minister Brian Talboys to the chairman of the NZRFU in a further attempt to discourage the tour, &quot;[the tour] may affect the harmonious development of the Commonwealth and international sport&quot;.

Some rugby supporters echoed the separation of politics and sport, while other rugby supporters argued that if the tour were cancelled, there would be no reporting of the widespread criticism of apartheid in New Zealand in the controlled South African media.

Muldoon&#x27;s critics felt that he allowed the tour in order for his National Party to secure the votes of rural and provincial conservatives in the general election later in the year, which National won. Along with Muldoon&#x27;s policy of &quot;leaving sporting contacts to sporting bodies&quot;, Muldoon also held the opinion that the disruption and division of New Zealand was not caused by the NZRFU, nor the Springboks, but the anti-tour protesters themselves. This argument was vehemently refuted by anti-tour voices, political activist Tom Newnham claimed that the government enabled &quot;the greatest breakdown in law and order [New Zealand] has ever witnessed.&quot;

The ensuing public protests polarised New Zealand: while rugby fans filled the football grounds, protest crowds filled the surrounding streets, and on one occasion succeeded in invading the pitch and stopping the game.

Initially the anti-tour movement was committed to non-violent civil disobedience, demonstrations and direct action. As protection for the Springboks, the police created two special riot squads, the Red and Blue Squads. These police were, controversially, the first in New Zealand to be issued with visored riot helmets and long batons (more commonly the side-handle baton). Some protesters were intimidated and interpreted this initial police response as overkill and heavy-handed tactics. After early disruptions, police began to require that all spectators assemble in sports grounds at least an hour before kick-off. While the protests were meant to be largely peaceful resistance to the Springbok tour, quite often there were &quot;violent confrontations with rugby supporters and specially trained riot police.&quot;

At Gisborne on the day before the match anti-tour activists, including Mereana Pitman, gained access to the pitch with a vehicle and tipped broken glass on the pitch. On 22 July, protesters managed to break through a fence, but quick action by spectators and ground security prevented the game being disrupted. Some protesters were beaten by police. From the very first match of the tour in Gisborne, protester tension levels ran high, and one protester, cartoonist Murray Ball, who was the son of an All Black, recalled that it &quot;was strange for New Zealanders to feel so aggressive towards other New Zealanders&quot; and that he was &quot;scared as hell&quot; when he came up against pro-tour defenders.

===Hamilton: Game cancelled===

At Rugby Park, Hamilton (the site of today&#x27;s Waikato Stadium), on 25 July, about 350 protesters invaded the pitch after pulling down a fence. The police arrested about 50 of them over a period of an hour, but were concerned that they could not control the rugby crowd, who were throwing bottles and other objects at the protesters. Following reports that a stolen light plane (piloted by Pat McQuarrie) was approaching the stadium, police cancelled the match.

The protesters were ushered from the ground and were advised by protest marshals to remove any anti-tour insignia from their attire, with enraged rugby spectators lashing out at them. Gangs of rugby supporters waited outside Hamilton police station for arrested protesters to be processed and released, and assaulted some protesters making their way into Victoria Street. There are many reports from protesters feeling unsafe during this protest. &quot;It was terrifying, I don’t know how big the crowd was, but they were clearly furious …. The police looked vulnerable as they spread out around the whole ground&quot;, recollects one protester.

===Wellington: Molesworth Street protest===
The aftermath of the Hamilton game, followed by the bloody batoning of marchers in Wellington&#x27;s Molesworth Street in the following week, in which police batoned bare-headed protesters, led to the radicalisation of the protest movement. There are many instances where the protesters had to fear for their safety, especially considering the violence that began on Molesworth Street, where police are said to have &quot;behaved rather too similarly to South African police&quot;, according to Tom Newnham. Former police officer, Ross Muerant, who was pro-tour, speaks of the Molesworth St protest: &quot;The protestors, who so obviously lacked self-control, were that evening privy to a classic display of discipline.&quot; This perspective of the police tactics has severe opposition from anti-tour activists, with claims that protesters were &quot;savagely attacked by police&quot;, and that &quot;police provoked violence.&quot; While Newnham&#x27;s claims that the violence towards protesters from police was unjustified was likely true in his experience, Muerant maintains that there were protesters who intended to inflict &quot;serious injury or disfigurement&quot; on the police.

Because of this, many protesters began to wear motorcycle or bicycle helmets to protect themselves from batons and head injury.

The authorities strengthened security at public facilities after protesters disrupted telecommunications by damaging a waveguide on a microwave repeater, disrupting telephone and data services, though TV transmissions continued as they were carried by a separate waveguide on the tower. Army engineers were deployed, and the remaining grounds were surrounded with razor wire and shipping container barricades to decrease the chances of another pitch invasion. At Eden Park, an emergency escape route was constructed from the visitors&#x27; changing rooms for use if the stadium was overrun by protesters. Crowds of anti-tour protesters stood outside as the police were overwhelmed but the hundreds of police still managed to prevent the protesters from entering the stadium.

===Christchurch===
At Lancaster Park, Christchurch, on 15 August, some protesters managed to break through a security cordon and a number invaded the pitch. They were quickly removed and forcibly ejected from the stadium by security staff and spectators. A large demonstration managed to occupy the street adjacent to the ground and confront the riot police. Spectators were kept in the ground until the protesters dispersed.

===Auckland: plane invasion===

A low-flying Cessna 172 piloted by Marx Jones and Grant Cole disrupted the final test at Eden Park, Auckland, on 12 September by dropping flour-bombs on the pitch, despite which the game continued. &quot;Patches&quot; of criminal gangs, such as traditional rivals Black Power and the Mongrel Mob, were also evident. (Black Power were Muldoon supporters.) A group of peaceful protestors dressed as clowns were beaten with batons by police. The same day in Warkworth, Dunedin and Timaru protesters stormed the local TV transmitters and shut off coverage of the game.

== The protest movement ==
Some of the protests had the dual purpose of linking racial discrimination against Māori in New Zealand to apartheid in South Africa. Some of the protesters, particularly young Māori, felt frustrated by the image of New Zealand as a paradise for racial unity. Many opponents of racism in New Zealand in the early 1980s saw it as useful to use the protests against South Africa as a vehicle for wider social action. However, some Māori supported the tour and attended games. John Minto, the national organizer for HART, thought that the tour &quot;stimulate[d] the whole debate about racism and the place of Māori in our community.&quot; Political activist Tom Newnham&#x27;s opinion echoes that of Minto&#x27;s, albeit considerably more radical, stating that &quot;we are basically the same as white South Africans, just as racist.&quot; Some of those protesting racism in South Africa felt inclined to reflect on the racial divide in their own country, before condemning another – part-Māori rugby spectator Kevin Taylor did not join the protests because he &quot;wanted New Zealand to fix its own issues before New Zealanders started telling other countries how to fix their problems.&quot;

==Tour of the United States==
With the American leg of the tour following directly after the events of New Zealand, further protests and clashes with police were expected. Threats of riots caused city officials in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York City and Rochester to withdraw their previous authorisation for the Springboks to play in their cities.

===Midwest===
The Springboks&#x27; match against the Midwest All Stars team had originally been intended to be played in Chicago. Following the anti-apartheid protests, it was secretly rescheduled to the mid morning of Saturday 19 September at Roosevelt Park in Racine, Wisconsin. The clandestine strategy seemingly worked as around 500 spectators gathered to watch the match. Late in the game, however, a small number of protesters arrived to disrupt proceedings and two were arrested after a brief altercation broke out on the field.

===Albany: pipe bomb===
The cancelled New York City match against the Eastern All Stars was moved upstate to Albany. The long serving Mayor of Albany, Erastus Corning, maintained that there was a right of peaceful assembly to &quot;publicly espouse an unpopular cause,&quot; despite his own stated view that &quot;I abhor everything about apartheid&quot;. Governor Hugh Carey argued that the event should be barred as the anti-apartheid demonstrators presented an &quot;imminent danger of riot&quot;, but a Federal court ruling allowing the game to be played was upheld in the United States Court of Appeals. A further appeal to Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall was also overruled on the grounds of free speech.

The match went ahead with around a thousand demonstrators (including Pete Seeger) corralled 100 yards away from the field of play, which was surrounded by the police. No violence occurred at the game but a pipe bomb was set off in the early morning outside the headquarters of the Eastern Rugby Union resulting in damage to the building estimated at $50,000. No one was injured.

===Glenville===
The final match of the tour, against the United States national team, took place in secret at Glenville in upstate New York. The thirty spectators recorded at the match is the lowest ever attendance for an international rugby match.

== Aftermath ==
The Muldoon government was re-elected in the 1981 election losing three seats to leave it with a majority of one.

The NZRFU constitution contained much high-minded wording about promoting the image of rugby and New Zealand, and generally being a benefit to society. In 1985, the NZRFU proposed an All Black tour of South Africa: two lawyers successfully sued it, claiming such a tour would breach its constitution. A High Court injunction by Justice Casey saw the tour cancelled.

Afterwards, the All Blacks would not tour South Africa until after the fall of the apartheid regime, with the next official tour in 1992. After the 1985 tour was cancelled, an unofficial tour took place a year later by a team that included 28 out of the 30 All Blacks selected for the 1985 tour, known as the New Zealand Cavaliers, a team that was often advertised in South Africa as the All Blacks and/or depicted with the Silver Fern.

After the All Blacks won the 1987 Rugby World Cup, rugby union was once again the dominant sport – in both spectator and participant numbers – in New Zealand.

<doc id="255928" wikidata="Q3329375" url="?curid=255928" title="Variety (linguistics)">
<text>In sociolinguistics, a variety, also known as a lect or an isolect, is a specific form of a language or language cluster. This may include languages, dialects, registers, styles, or other forms of language, as well as a standard variety. The use of the word &quot;variety&quot; to refer to the different forms avoids the use of the term &quot;language&quot;, which many people associate only with the standard language, and the term &quot;dialect&quot;, which is often associated with non-standard language forms thought of as less prestigious or &quot;proper&quot; than the standard. Linguists speak of both standard and non-standard (vernacular) varieties as equally complex, valid, and full-fledged forms of language. &quot;Lect&quot; avoids the problem in ambiguous cases of deciding whether two varieties are distinct languages or dialects of a single language.

Variation at the level of the lexicon, such as slang and argot, is often considered in relation to particular styles or levels of formality (also called registers), but such uses are sometimes discussed as varieties as well.

==Dialects==

O&#x27;Grady et al. define &quot;dialect&quot;: &quot;A regional or social variety of a language characterized by its own phonological, syntactic, and lexical properties.&quot; A variety spoken in a particular region is called a regional dialect (regiolect, geolect); some regional varieties are called regionalects or topolects, especially to discuss varieties of Chinese. In addition, there are varieties associated with particular ethnic groups (sometimes called ethnolects), socioeconomic classes (sometimes called sociolects), or other social or cultural groups.

Dialectology is the study of dialects and their geographic or social distribution. Traditionally, dialectologists study the variety of language used within a particular speech community, a group of people who share a set of norms or conventions for language use. 

In order to sidestep the vexing problem of distinguishing &quot;dialect&quot; from &quot;language&quot;, some linguists have been using the term &quot;communalect&quot; – defined as &quot;a neutral term for any speech tradition tied to a specific community&quot;.

More recently, sociolinguists have adopted the concept of the community of practice, a group of people who develop shared knowledge and shared norms of interaction, as the social group within which dialects develop and change. Sociolinguists Penelope Eckert and Sally McConnell-Ginet explain: &quot;Some communities of practice may develop more distinctive ways of speaking than others. Thus, it is within communities of practice that linguistic influence may spread within and among speech communities.&quot;

The words &quot;dialect&quot; and &quot;accent&quot; are often used synonymously in everyday speech, but linguists define the two terms differently. &quot;Accent&quot; generally refers to differences in pronunciation, especially those that are associated with geographic or social differences, whereas &quot;dialect&quot; refers to differences in grammar and vocabulary as well.

==Standard varieties==

Many languages have a &quot;standard variety&quot;, some lect that is selected and promoted prescriptively by either quasi-legal authorities or other social institutions, such as schools or media. Standard varieties are accorded more sociolinguistic prestige than other, nonstandard lects and are generally thought of as &quot;correct&quot; by speakers of the language. Since the selection is an arbitrary standard, standard forms are the &quot;correct&quot; varieties only in the sense that they are tacitly valued by higher socio-economic strata and promoted by public influencers on matters of language use, such as writers, publishers, critics, language teachers, and self-appointed language guardians. As Ralph Harold Fasold puts it, &quot;The standard language may not even be the best possible constellation of linguistic features available. It is general social acceptance that gives us a workable arbitrary standard, not any inherent superiority of the characteristics it specifies.&quot;

Sociolinguists generally recognize the standard variety of a language as one of the dialects of that language.

In some cases, an authoritative regulatory body, such as the , maintains and codifies the usage norms for a standard variety. More often, though, standards are understood in an implicit, practice-based way. Writing about Standard English, John Algeo suggests that the standard variety &quot;is simply what English speakers agree to regard as good&quot;.

==Registers and styles==

A &quot;register&quot; (sometimes called a &quot;style&quot;) is a variety of language used in a particular social setting. Settings may be defined in terms of greater or lesser formality, or in terms of socially recognized events, such as baby talk, which is used in many western cultures to talk to small children or as a joking register used in teasing or playing The Dozens. There are also registers associated with particular professions or interest groups; jargon refers specifically to the vocabulary associated with such registers.

Unlike dialects, which are used by particular speech communities and associated with geographical settings or social groupings, registers are associated with particular communicative situations, purposes, or levels of formality, and can constitute divisions within a single regional lect or standardized variety. Dialect and register may thus be thought of as different dimensions of linguistic variation. For example, Trudgill suggests the following sentence as an example of a nonstandard dialect that is used with the technical register of physical geography:
Most speakers command a range of registers, which they use in different situations. The choice of register is affected by the setting and topic of speech, as well as the relationship that exists between the speakers.

The appropriate form of language may also change during the course of a communicative event as the relationship between speakers changes, or different social facts become relevant. Speakers may shift styles, as their perception of an event in progress changes. Consider the following telephone call to the Embassy of Cuba in Washington, DC.
Caller: (&quot;Is this the Cuban embassy?&quot;)
Receptionist: (&quot;Yes, may I help you?&quot;)
Caller: (&quot;It&#x27;s Rosa.&quot;)
Receptionist: (&quot;Oh, Rosa! How&#x27;s it going?&quot;)

At first, the receptionist uses a relatively formal register, as befits her professional role. After the caller identifies herself, the receptionist recognizes that she is speaking to a friend, and she shifts to an informal register of colloquial Cuban Spanish. The shift is similar to metaphorical code-switching, but since it involves styles or registers, it is considered an example of style-shifting.

==Idiolect==
An idiolect is defined as &quot;the language use typical of an individual person&quot;. An individual&#x27;s idiolect may be affected by contact with various regional or social dialects, professional registers and, in the case of multilinguals, various languages.

For scholars who view language from the perspective of linguistic competence, essentially the knowledge of language and grammar that exists in the mind of an individual language user, the idiolect, is a way of referring to the specific knowledge. For scholars who regard language as a shared social practice, the idiolect is more like a dialect with a speech community of one individual.

<text>In Violet Light is the eighth full-length album by Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip. The album debuted at #2 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling almost 33,000 copies in its first week. The album has been certified platinum in Canada.

Packaged with the album in stores was a membership card for The Hip Club, an online fan club which offered three digital bonus tracks, &quot;Forest Edge&quot;, &quot;Problem Bears&quot; and &quot;Ultra Mundane&quot;.

The music video for &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life, If You Don&#x27;t Weaken&quot; was filmed in Oshawa, Ontario, at Parkwood Estate. The light-hearted music video for &quot;The Darkest One&quot; featured Don Cherry and the Trailer Park Boys.

The song &quot;Throwing Off Glass&quot; was also released on the &quot;Men with Brooms&quot; soundtrack album.

At the Juno Awards of 2021, in the band&#x27;s first live performance as a unit since Gord Downie&#x27;s death in 2017, the band performed &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life If You Don&#x27;t Weaken&quot; with Feist on vocals.

<text>Quantum Link (or Q-Link) was an American and Canadian online service for the Commodore 64 and 128 personal computers that operated starting November 5, 1985. It was operated by Quantum Computer Services of Vienna, Virginia, which later became America Online.

In October 1989 the service was renamed America Online, and made available to users of PC systems as well. The original Q-link service was terminated on November 1, 1995, in favor of the America Online brand.

The original Q-Link was a modified version of the PlayNET system, which Control Video Corporation licensed. Q-Link featured electronic mail, online chat (in its People Connection department), public domain file sharing libraries, online news, and instant messaging using On Line Messages (OLMs). Other noteworthy features included multiplayer games like checkers, chess, backgammon, hangman, and a clone of the television game show &quot;Wheel Of Fortune&quot; called &quot;Puzzler&quot;; and an interactive graphic resort island, called Habitat during beta-testing, then renamed Club Caribe.

In October 1986, QuantumLink expanded their services to include casino games such as bingo, slot machines, blackjack and poker in RabbitJack&#x27;s Casino; and RockLink, a section about rock music. The software archives were also organized into hierarchical folders and expanded.

In November 1986, the service began offering to digitize users&#x27; photos to be included in their profiles, and started an online auction service.

Connections to Q-Link were typically made by dial-up modems with speeds from 300 to 2400 baud, with 1200 being the most common. The service was normally open weekday evenings and all day on weekends. Pricing was $9.95 per month, with additional fees of six cents per minute (later raised to eight) for so-called &quot;plus&quot; areas, including most of the aforementioned services. Users were given one free hour of &quot;plus&quot; usage per month. Hosts of forums and trivia games could also earn additional free &quot;plus&quot; time.

Q-Link competed with online services like CompuServe and The Source, and with bulletin board systems (single- and multiuser), including gaming systems such as &quot;Scepter of Goth&quot; and &quot;Swords of Chaos&quot;. Quantum Link&#x27;s graphic display was better than many competing systems because they used specialized client software with a nonstandard protocol. However, this limited their market, because only the Commodore 64 and 128 could run the software necessary to access it.

== Club Caribe / Habitat == 
One of the most influential Quantum Link games was &quot;Club Caribe&quot;, a predecessor to today&#x27;s MMOGs.

Club Caribe was developed with Lucasfilm Games using software that later formed the basis of Lucasfilm&#x27;s Maniac Mansion story system (SCUMM). Users controlled on-screen avatars that could chat with other users, carry and use objects and money (called &quot;tokens&quot;), and travel around the island one screen at a time. Club Caribe allowed users to take the heads off their characters, carry them around, and even set it down. However, other users could pick up heads that were placed on the ground, resulting in headless players exploring the game world.

== Quantum Link Reloaded ==
In 2005, the proprietary server software was analyzed, and a version written in java and reachable via TCP/IP was released at SWRAP 2005. The software evolved in two fork hosted on GitHub 

== Popular culture ==
Much of the second and third seasons of the American TV series &quot;Halt and Catch Fire&quot; is centered around the development and troubles of the fictional tech startup &quot;Mutiny&quot;, heavily inspired by the story of PlayNET and Quantum Link in the 1980s. In the show, Mutiny transitions from an online games company to eventually delivering an online subscriber-based graphical chat community for Commodore 64 users, mirroring Habitat.

<doc id="255931" wikidata="Q2142996" url="?curid=255931" title="Tampopo">
<text>is a 1985 Japanese comedy film written and directed by Juzo Itami, and starring Tsutomu Yamazaki, Nobuko Miyamoto, Kōji Yakusho, and Ken Watanabe. The publicity for the film calls it the first &quot;ramen Western&quot;, a play on the term spaghetti Western.

==Plot==
A pair of truck drivers, the experienced Gorō and a younger colleague named Gun, stop at a decrepit roadside ramen noodle shop. Outside, Gorō rescues a boy who is being beaten by three schoolmates. The boy, Tabo, is the son of Tampopo, the widowed owner of the struggling ramen shop, Lai Lai. A customer called Pisuken harasses Tampopo, demanding that she sell the shop. Gorō suggests Pisuken be quiet so he can enjoy his meal, then provokes a physical confrontation. Gorō puts up a good fight but, outnumbered by Pisuken and his men, he is knocked out and awakens the next morning in Tampopo&#x27;s home.

The next morning, she kindly cooks breakfast for Gorō and Gun in her home kitchen and sends Tabo off to school. While eating breakfast, Tampopo asks for their opinion of her ramen, Gorō and Gun tell her they are &quot;sincere, but lack character.&quot; After Gorō gives her some advice, she asks him to become her teacher. They decide to turn her establishment into a paragon of the &quot;art of noodle soup making&quot;. She and Gorō visit her competitors and he points out their strengths and weaknesses. She still is struggling to fix the broth, so Gorō visits a homeless encampment to enlist the &quot;old master&quot; and his superlative expertise. When they rescue a wealthy elderly man from choking on his food, the man lends her the services of his chauffeur Shohei, who has a masterly way with noodles. Through clever trickery, they pry ramen secrets from their competitors. Gun and his friends give Tampopo a makeover as a modern proprietress. During the transition, the group agrees to change the restaurant&#x27;s name from &quot;Lai Lai&quot; to &quot;Tampopo&quot;.

Pisuken feels bad for being too drunk to tell his men to stay out of the fight, so he offers Gorō another chance one-on-one. After the rematch ends in a draw, Pisuken reveals he is a contractor and Tampopo&#x27;s childhood friend, and offers to renovate the shop&#x27;s interior. Tampopo&#x27;s latest effort still comes up short, so Pisuken teaches her his own secret recipe. When the five men consume her latest creation down to the last drop, Tampopo knows she has won. Tabo also triumphs, beating all three of his tormentors and subsequently befriending them. As customers fill her newly redecorated shop, the men file out one by one.

Throughout the film, minor scenes of other characters are featured. A group of business executives visit a French restaurant but have no idea how to order and are upstaged by a surprisingly worldly subordinate. A women&#x27;s etiquette class on how to eat spaghetti silently in the European manner abruptly changes course upon observing a white man slurping his noodles. A gentleman has a rotten tooth extracted, then eats ice cream afterward, sharing with a young child whose mother forbids him to eat sweets. A supermarket clerk catches an aged woman obsessed with squeezing food. A con man uses an elaborate meal to lure a victim into an investment scam; the victim is himself a thief but is so taken by the meal that he fails to leave with the con man&#x27;s wallet before being arrested. A man and a teenage girl share an indirect kiss as she feeds him a fresh oyster from her palm. A housewife rises from her deathbed to cook one last meal for her family, who mournfully eat to memorialize her. A man and his lover explore erotic ways to use food. The man is ultimately shot several times by an unknown assailant, to his lover&#x27;s horror, though he is satisfied at the end of his life and hopes to see it play out like a film. A woman on a park bench breastfeeds an infant.

==Cast==
==Production==
Throughout, the film references stereotypical American movie themes, characters, music, and camera shots.

==Release==
&quot;Tampopo&quot; was released in Japan on November 23, 1985, distributed by Toho. New Yorker Films released the film in the United States in 1987.

The Criterion Collection prepared a 4K restoration of &quot;Tampopo&quot; that was released in theaters and via Blu-ray in October 2016.

==Reception==

=== Critical response ===
Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, commenting that &quot;Like the French comedies of Jacques Tati, it&#x27;s a bemused meditation on human nature in which one humorous situation flows into another offhandedly, as if life were a series of smiles.&quot;

Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;The movie, which Itami calls a &#x27;noodle Western,&#x27; is a rambunctious mixture of the bawdy and the sublime...&quot;Tampopo&quot; is perhaps the funniest movie about the connection between food and sex ever made.&quot;

Andrew Johnston writing in &quot;Time Out New York&quot; commented: &quot;This film is his broadest comedy by far, and its principal subjects are those great global constants, food and sex. That, combined with the plot&#x27;s sly evocation of movie Westerns, made it widely accessible to foreign audiences.&quot;

Vincent Canby provided a somewhat dissenting, though still positive, opinion in his &quot;New York Times&quot; review, stating, &quot;Though it&#x27;s not consistently funny... &quot;Tampopo&quot; is one of the more engaging films to be shown in this year&#x27;s [New Directors/New Films] series... Mr. Itami often strains after comic effects that remain elusive. The most appealing thing about &quot;Tampopo&quot; is that he never stops trying.&quot;

&quot;Tampopo&quot; has received unanimous praise from critics, with a 100% approval rating and average score of 8.53/10 from Rotten Tomatoes, based on 52 reviews. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Thanks to director Juzo Itami&#x27;s offbeat humor and sharp satirical edge, Tampopo is a funny, sexy, affectionate celebration of food and its broad influence on Japanese culture.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Tampopo&quot; received two Japanese Academy Awards: for Best Editing and for Best Sound. In the United States, it was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Foreign Film and a National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Screenplay and Best Director.

==Legacy==

The 2008 American/Japanese movie &quot;The Ramen Girl&quot;, in which a girl played by Brittany Murphy learns how to cook ramen, contains many references to &quot;Tampopo&quot;, including a cameo by Tsutomu Yamazaki. 

Actor Edward Norton named &quot;Tampopo&quot; as one of his favorite films of all time.

A number of ramen restaurants around the world have been named Tampopo.

<text>Buenos Aires, officially the Buenos Aires Province, is the largest and most populous Argentine province. It takes its name from the city of Buenos Aires, the capital of the country, which used to be part of the province and the province&#x27;s capital until it was federalized in 1880. Since then, in spite of bearing the same name, the province does not include Buenos Aires city, though it does include all other parts of the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area. The capital of the province is the city of La Plata, founded in 1882.

It is bordered by the provinces of Entre Ríos to the northeast, Santa Fe to the north, Córdoba to the northwest, La Pampa to the west, Río Negro to the south and west and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires to the northeast. Uruguay is just across the Rio de la Plata to the northeast, and both are on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean to the east. Almost the entire province is part of the Pampas geographical region, with the extreme south often considered part of the Patagonia region.

The province has a population of about 17.5 million people, which is 38% of Argentina&#x27;s total population. The province covers an area of , which is about 11% of Argentina&#x27;s total area and makes it the country&#x27;s largest province.

==History==

The inhabitants of the province before the 16th-century advent of Spanish colonization were aboriginal peoples such as the Charrúas and the Querandíes. Their culture was lost over the next 350 years. They were subjected to Eurasian plagues from which few survived. The survivors joined other tribes or have been mostly absorbed by Argentina&#x27;s European immigration.

Pedro de Mendoza founded &quot;Santa María del Buen Ayre&quot; in 1536. Even though the first contact with the aboriginals was peaceful, it soon became hostile. The city was evacuated in 1541. Juan de Garay re-founded the settlement in 1580 as &quot;Santísima Trinidad y Puerto Santa María de Los Buenos Aires&quot;.

Amidst ongoing conflict with the aboriginals, the cattle farms extended from Buenos Aires, whose port was always the center of the economy of the territory. Following the creation of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata at the end of the 18th century, the export of meat, leather and their derivatives through the port of Buenos Aires was the basis of the economic development of the region.

Jesuits unsuccessfully tried to peacefully assimilate the aboriginals into the European culture brought by the Spanish conquistadores. A certain balance was found at the end of the 18th century when the Salado River became the limit between both civilizations, despite frequent &quot;malones&quot; (aboriginal attacks on border settlements). The end to this situation came in 1879 with the Conquest of the Desert (&quot;Conquista del Desierto&quot;) in which the aboriginals were almost completely exterminated.
After the independence from Spain in 1816, the city and province of Buenos Aires became the focus of an intermittent Argentine Civil War with other provinces. A Federal Pact secured by Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas in 1831 led to the establishment of the Argentine Confederation and to his gaining the sum of public power, which provided a tenuous unity. Ongoing disputes regarding the influence of Buenos Aires, between Federalists and Unitarians, and over the Port of Buenos Aires (the prime source of public revenue at the time) fueled periodic hostilities. The province was declared independent on 11 September 1852, as the State of Buenos Aires. Concessions gained in 1859 Pact of San José de Flores and a victory at the Battle of Pavón led to its reincorporation into the Argentine Republic on 17 December 1861. Intermittent conflicts with the nation did not truly cease until 1880, when the city of Buenos Aires was formally federalized and, thus, administratively separated from the province.
La Plata was founded in 1882 by Governor Dardo Rocha for the purpose of becoming the provincial capital. The equivalent of a billion (1880s) dollars of British investment and pro-development, education and immigration policies pursued at the national level subsequently spurred dramatic economic growth. Driven by European immigration and improved health, the province&#x27;s population, like Argentina&#x27;s, nearly doubled to one million by 1895 and doubled again by 1914. Rail lines connected nearly every town and hamlet in the province by 1914; many developed around the new railway stations.

This era of accelerated development was cut short by the Wall Street crash of 1929, which caused a sharp drop in commodity prices (99% of Argentine exports were agricultural) and led to a halt in the flow of investment funds between nations. The new Concordance and Perón governments funded ambitious lending and public works programs, visible in Buenos Aires Province through the panoply of levees, power plants, water works, paved roads, municipal buildings, and (particularly during Perón&#x27;s 1946-55 tenure) schools, clinics and massive regional hospitals.

The province&#x27;s population, after 1930, began to grow disproportionately quickly in the suburban areas of Buenos Aires. These suburbs had grown to include 4 million out of the province&#x27;s total 7 million people in 1960. Much of the area these new suburbs were developed on (particularly the poorer ones) consisted of wetlands and were prone to flooding. To address this, Governor Oscar Alende initiated the province&#x27;s most important flood-control project to date, the Roggero Reservoir. Completed a decade later, in 1971, the reservoir and associated electric and water-treatment facilities encouraged still more, and more orderly, development of the Greater Buenos Aires region, which today includes around 10 million people ( of the provincial population). It did not address worsening pollution resulting from the area&#x27;s industrial growth, which had made itself evident since around 1920. This problem has been at its worst along the Reconquista River west and north of the city of Buenos Aires; over 4 million people (one in 10 Argentines) today live on the Reconquista&#x27;s basin. Of these, about a million still live with seriously compromised water quality, despite the province&#x27;s (sometimes counterproductive) efforts to remedy the issue.

===Contemporary history===
In April 2013, the northeastern section of Buenos Aires Province, particularly its capital, La Plata, experienced several flash floods that claimed the lives of at least 89 people.

Alejandro Armendáriz, of the Radical Civic Union, was elected governor in 1983, when Raúl Alfonsín became president. Alfonsín lost the 1987 midterm elections, leading to the victory of Antonio Cafiero. From then to 2015, all governors have been Peronists. The high population of the province makes it highly influential in Argentine politics. With both ruling for two terms, the rivalry of the president Carlos Menem and governor Eduardo Duhalde dominated the Argentine politics during the nineties. A similar case took place with the president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and governor Daniel Scioli. María Eugenia Vidal, from Republican Proposal, won the 2015 elections, and became the first female governor of the province.

=== Paleontology ===
In February 2021, researchers led by paleontologist Nicolás Chimento of the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales announced the discovery of a well-preserved fossilized skull of the giant ground sloth Megatherium near San Eduardo del Mar, Province of Buenos Aires. According to paleontologists, the fossil belonged to a juvenile and dated back approximately 3.58 million years.

== Government ==


The provincial government is divided into three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoints the cabinet; the legislative (represented by the Legislature, which is split into the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate); and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.

The Constitution of Buenos Aires Province forms the formal law of the province.

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police, but the province is policed by its own Buenos Aires Provincial Police.

==Geography==
Buenos Aires Province, at , is slightly bigger than Italy. The landscape is mainly flat, with two low mountain ranges: &quot;Sierra de la Ventana&quot; (near Bahía Blanca) and &quot;Sierra de Tandil&quot; (Tandil). The highest point is &quot;Cerro Tres Picos&quot; ( amsl; ) and the longest river is &quot;Río Salado&quot; ( long).

As part of The Pampas, the weather of the province is strongly influenced by the ocean, with hot summers and temperate winters. Humidity is high and precipitation is abundant and distributed over the year. The Western and Southwestern regions are drier and are part of the Semi-arid Pampas ecoregion. The southernmost part of the province is often included in definitions of the Patagonia region.

===Climate===


The climate of the province of Buenos Aires is extremely benign for human activities: it is temperate, with four marked seasons and reliable rainfall on most regions. The province can be divided into four main climatic regions: the southwestern, drier region; the cool Atlantic region; the northern and eastern humid region, and the Delta region, with the warmest, wettest climate.

The northern region has warm, humid summers, with days between and nights between , pleasant falls, cool, drier winters with highs between and nights between , and windy, variable springs. Heat waves may bring days with temperatures over , but these do not usually last very long, as cold fronts bring thunderstorms and cooler days, with night temperatures often falling down to . Winter cold waves may bring days with highs about , and lows below , with extremes down to . Snow is uncommon, but there have been accumulations on several occasions in the past. Precipitation ranges from per year.

The Delta region is slightly warmer, especially at night, due to the presence of water and the northerly location.

==Administrative divisions==
Unlike the other provinces of the country, in the province of Buenos Aires, the territorial divisions are called &quot;partidos&quot;, instead of departments.

These also constitute the municipal division of the province. The provincial Constitution does not recognize the municipal autonomy that was recognized for the whole country in the reform of the National Constitution of 1994. Each partido corresponds to a municipality and is governed by a mayor (&quot;intendente&quot;) elected by popular vote. The process of creating a partido is much more dynamic than in the other provinces, with a total of six more partidos in 2000 than in 1990. Most of the newer partidos were created in the Greater Buenos Aires. There are 135 partidos, the last established by law is Lezama (2009).

Buenos Aires Province is the most populated province of the country. The INDEC estimates that the population of Buenos Aires Province was 17,541,141 on 1 July 2020, a 12.26% increase since the 2010 national census. According to that census, there were 15 million inhabitants (38% of the national population), of which 12 million lived in Greater Buenos Aires and 3 million in the rest of the province. Around 33.8% of the inhabitants weren&#x27;t born in the province, of whom 3,918,552 are migrants from other provinces and 758,640 were born abroad.

Most of its inhabitants are descendants from colonial-era settlers and immigrants from Europe who arrived within the 19th and 20th centuries, mostly Italians and Spaniards. A number of suburbs in the province are also home to a large, predominantly mestizo population that began migrating from the country&#x27;s northern provinces in the mid-20th century to take advantage of growing employment opportunities. These same communities are also home to considerable numbers of more recent migrants from Paraguay and Bolivia.

It has a per capita income of $24,780 (around $27,300 in 2016). The province is the nation&#x27;s chief exporter, generating nearly $107 billion in exports in 2016 (37% of the nation&#x27;s total).
Agriculture in the province is renowned around the world for its productivity. The province is Argentina&#x27;s chief agricultural producer, and accounted for at least $8 billion in export earnings in 2014. This sector adds about 5% to the province&#x27;s highly diversified economy, however. The province&#x27;s ranching sector is diversified, and though cattle historically provided the main animal husbandry activity, Buenos Aires is also the top producer of sheep, pork, and chicken meat of the country. Equally important is the dairy industry. Crop harvests are the most diverse in the nation and have grown to record levels in recent decades. The most important crops include soybean, maize, wheat, sunflower and other oilseeds, like flax. More recently, premium wines have been produced in the Buenos Aires wine region in the south of the province.

Manufacturing accounts for a fourth of the province&#x27;s output and is about 40% of the entire nation&#x27;s. The industry of the province is diverse: chemical, pharmaceutical, metallurgic, motor vehicles, machinery, textiles and the food industry are the most notable. Excluding processed agricultural items, the province was responsible for over US$70 billion of industrial exports in 2016 and accounted for a third of all Argentine exports.

The province&#x27;s services sector is well-diversified and differs little from national trends. The largest local bank is the public Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires. The institution, the second largest in Argentina, holds nearly a tenth of the nation&#x27;s bank deposits.

<text>Buddy Hackett (born Leonard Hacker; August 31, 1924 – June 30, 2003) was an American comedian and comic actor. Known for his raunchy material, heavy appearance, and thick New York accent, his best remembered roles include Marcellus Washburn in &quot;The Music Man&quot; (1962), Benjy Benjamin in &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), Tennessee Steinmetz in &quot;The Love Bug&quot; (1968), and the voice of Scuttle in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989). He was also a frequent guest on TV game shows and variety shows.

==Early life==
Hackett was one of two children born into a Jewish family living in Brooklyn, New York. His mother Anna (née Geller) worked in the garment trades while his father Philip Hacker was a furniture upholsterer and part-time inventor. Hackett grew up across from Public School 103 on 54th Street and 14th Avenue in Borough Park, Brooklyn, and was active in varsity football and drama club at New Utrecht High School. Hackett suffered from Bell&#x27;s palsy as a child, the lingering effects of which contributed to his distinctive slurred speech and facial expression.

While still a student, Hackett worked as a &quot;tummler&quot; (Yiddish for &quot;tumult maker&quot;) entertaining guests in the Catskills Borscht Belt resorts. While there, he began performing stand-up comedy in the resort nightclubs as &quot;Butch Hacker&quot;. He appeared first at the Golden Hotel in Hurleyville, New York, claiming later he did not get one single laugh. Following his graduation from high school in 1942, Hackett enlisted in the United States Army and served during World War II for three years in an anti-aircraft battery.

==Career==

===Early career===
Hackett&#x27;s first job after the war was at the Pink Elephant, a Brooklyn club. It was here that he changed his name from Leonard Hacker to Buddy Hackett. He made appearances in Los Angeles and Las Vegas, and continued to perform in the Catskills. He acted on Broadway, in &quot;Lunatics and Lovers&quot;, where Max Liebman saw him and put him in two television specials.

Hackett&#x27;s movie career began in 1950 with a 10-minute &quot;World of Sports&quot; reel for Columbia Pictures called &quot;King of the Pins&quot;. The film demonstrated championship bowling techniques, with expert Joe Wilman demonstrating the right way and Hackett (in pantomime) exemplifying the wrong way. There was an anecdote that, because of this appearance, Hackett received an offer to join the Three Stooges from Jules White, the head of Columbia short subject department, in 1952. Curly Howard had suffered a debilitating stroke in 1946; his older brother Shemp Howard was intended to replace him only on a temporary basis until he fully recovered, but Curly died in January 1952. It was said Hackett even joined Moe Howard and Larry Fine for a rehearsal, but turned down the offer eventually when he felt he did not fit with the act&#x27;s comedy style and wanted to develop his own style as a solo act. This rumor was later dismissed as either untrue or unfounded.

Hackett would not return to movies until 1953, after one of his nightclub routines attracted attention. With a rubber band around his head to slant his eyes, Hackett&#x27;s &quot;The Chinese Waiter&quot; lampooned the heavy dialect, frustration, and communication problems encountered by a busy waiter in a Chinese restaurant: &quot;No, we no &quot;have&quot; sprit-pea soup ... We gotta wonton, we got eh-roll ... No orda for her, juss orda for you!&quot; The routine was such a hit that Hackett made a recording of it, and was hired to reprise it in the Universal-International musical &quot;Walking My Baby Back Home&quot; (1953), in which he was third-billed under Donald O&#x27;Connor and Janet Leigh.

Hackett was an emergency replacement for the similarly built Lou Costello in 1954. Abbott and Costello were set to make a feature-length comedy &quot;Fireman, Save My Child&quot;, featuring Spike Jones and His City Slickers. Several scenes had been shot with stunt doubles when Costello was forced to withdraw due to illness. Universal-International salvaged the project by hiring Hugh O&#x27;Brian and Hackett to take over the Abbott and Costello roles with Jones and his band becoming the main attraction.

Hackett became known to a wider audience when he appeared on television in the 1950s and 60s as a frequent guest on variety talk shows hosted by Jack Paar and Arthur Godfrey, telling brash, often off-color jokes, and mugging at the camera. Hackett was a frequent guest on both the Jack Paar and the Johnny Carson versions of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. According to the board game &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;, Hackett has the distinction of making the most guest appearances in the history of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. During this time, he also appeared as a panelist and mystery guest on CBS-TV&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and filled in as emcee for the game show &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot;. He made fifteen guest appearances on NBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot; between 1955 and 1961. He appeared with his roommate Lenny Bruce on the &quot;Patrice Munsel Show&quot; (1957-1958), calling their comedy duo the &quot;Not Ready for Prime Time Players,&quot; twenty years before the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; used the same name.

Hackett appeared twice on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, starring Chuck Connors and Johnny Crawford. In both episodes, &quot;Bloodlines&quot; (1959) and &quot;The Clarence Bibs Story&quot; (1961), his fellow guest star was Denver Pyle. He was cast as Daniel Malakie in &quot;Bloodlines&quot;, the father of three boisterous brothers headed to trouble, and then as Clarence Bibs in the episode of that same name. Bibs is a handyman who after cleaning a gun accidentally kills a notorious outlaw, Longden (X Brands). Then, Longden&#x27;s former partner, George Tanner (Denver Pyle), comes to town but avoids confrontation with Bibs and accepts the explanation that Wicks&#x27; death was accidental.

===&quot;Stanley&quot;===
Hackett starred as the title character on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Stanley&quot;, a 1956–57 situation comedy which ran for 19 weeks on Monday evenings at 8:30 pm ET. The half-hour series also featured a young Carol Burnett and the voice of Paul Lynde. The Max Liebman produced program aired live before a studio audience and was one of the last sitcoms from New York to do so. &quot;Stanley&quot; revolved around the adventures of the titular character (Hackett) as the operator of a newsstand in a posh New York City hotel.

Hackett appeared opposite Robert Preston in the film adaptation of &quot;The Music Man&quot; (1962). In &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), Hackett was paired with Mickey Rooney, with whom he had also recently made &quot;Everything&#x27;s Ducky&quot; (1961), in which they played two sailors who smuggle a talking duck aboard a Navy ship. Children became familiar with him as lovable hippie auto mechanic Tennessee Steinmetz in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Love Bug&quot; (1968).

In 1964, he had a stint on Broadway, appearing with Richard Kiley in &quot;I Had a Ball&quot;.

He appeared many times on the game show &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; in the late 1960s and 1970s. In one episode, Hackett (who was Jewish) was asked which country had the highest ratio of doctors to populace; he answered Israel, or in his words, &quot;The country with the most Jews.&quot; Despite the audience roaring with laughter (and Hackett&#x27;s own belief that the actual answer was Sweden), the answer turned out to be correct. Hackett&#x27;s regular guest appearances on &quot;Jack Paar&#x27;s Tonight Show&quot; in the early 1960s were rewarded with a coveted appearance on Paar&#x27;s final &quot;Tonight&quot; program on March 29, 1962.

===Later career===
Throughout the 1970s, Hackett published a book of poetry entitled &quot;The Naked Mind of Buddy Hackett&quot;, made frequent appearances on Johnny Carson&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; until Carson&#x27;s retirement in 1992, delivered a dramatic performance as Lou Costello in the television movie &quot;Bud and Lou&quot; opposite Harvey Korman as Bud Abbott, and narrated the Rankin/Bass Christmas special &quot;Jack Frost&quot; (1979). Hackett appeared regularly in TV ads for Tuscan Dairy popsicles and yogurt throughout this decade, with his most famous television campaign being for Lay&#x27;s potato chips (&quot;Nobody can eat just one!&quot;), running from 1968 to 1971. In 1980, he starred in the film &quot;Hey Babe!&quot; and hosted a syndicated revival of the 1950–61 Groucho Marx quiz show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; until its cancellation one year later. Hackett also appeared on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, and guest-starred in the &quot;Space Rangers&quot; episode &quot;To Be Or Not To Be&quot; as has-been comedian Lenny Hacker, a parody of his stage persona.

==Other==
For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Hackett was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2000, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

In April 1998, Hackett guest starred in an episode of &quot;LateLine&quot; called &quot;Buddy Hackett&quot;. The episode focused on a news broadcast paying tribute to Hackett following his death, only to discover that the report of his death was a mistake. Robert Reich and Dick Gephardt also appeared in the episode, paying tribute to Hackett, by singing along to Hackett&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Shipoopi&quot; from &quot;The Music Man&quot;.

In his final years, Hackett had a recurring spot called &quot;Tuesdays with Buddy&quot; on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot; in which he shared stories of his career and delivered some of his comedic routines.

In 1999, he appeared in 13 episodes of Fox&#x27;s &quot;Action&quot; TV series as a security guard and chauffeur named Lonnie Dragon.

In 2021, Hackett was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
On June 12, 1955, Hackett married Sherry Cohen. They lived in Leonia, New Jersey, in the late 1950s. In August 1958, they bought the house previously owned by deceased crime boss Albert Anastasia in Fort Lee, New Jersey. After renovations, they moved in and lived there through most of the 1960s. In 2003, Hackett and his wife established the Singita Animal Sanctuary in California&#x27;s San Fernando Valley.
Hackett&#x27;s son, Sandy, followed his father into the comedy world, and for years opened for his father before his performances. Sandy created a one-man stage show about his father after his death.

He was an avid firearms collector and owned a large collection that he sold off in his later years.

==Death==
In the early 1990s, Hackett was diagnosed with severe heart disease, but steadfastly refused to consider bypass surgery. His heart disease was the primary cause of his death on June 30, 2003, at his beach house in Malibu, California, at the age of 78, just two months before his 79th birthday. His son, comedian Sandy Hackett, said his father had been suffering from diabetes for several years and suffered a stroke nearly a week before his death, which also may have contributed to his demise.

<text>Juguang Township / Jyuguang Township (; Foochow Romanized: Gṳ̄-guŏng-hiŏng), also spelled Chukuang, is a rural township of Lienchiang County (the Matsu Islands), Republic of China (Taiwan). Juguang Township includes two major islands, Dongju Island ( &quot;East Ju&quot;; Dĕ̤ng-gṳ̄) and Xiju Island ( &quot;West Ju&quot;; Să̤-gṳ̄), as well as some islets.

==Name==
On October 15, 1971, the Executive Yuan approved changing the name of the township from Baiquan Township (Paichuan, White Dogs; ) to Juguang Township (Chukuang; ). They also approved changing the name of Xiquan Island (Hsichuan; ) to Xiju Island (Hsiju; ) and Dongquan Island (Tungchuan; ) to Dongju Island (Tungchu; ). The islands were renamed based on a quote of a speech by Chiang Kai-shek, &quot;forget not that you&#x27;re in Ju&quot; (; Wú wàng zài Jǔ; Ù uông câi Gṳ̄). It refers to the City of Ju, where the king of Qi prepared a counterattack that retook his country from the State of Yan. This is an analogy of Matsu and Taiwan generally as bases of the Republic of China (ROC) to regenerate itself and one day recover mainland China from the Chinese Communist Party.

Dongju and Xiju Islands were previously named Dongquan (Tung-ch&#x27;üan Tao/Tung-ch&#x27;uan Tao ; Dĕ̤ng-kēng) and Xiquan (Hsi-ch&#x27;üan Tao/Hsi-ch&#x27;uan Tao ; Să̤-kēng) Islands, meaning &quot;Eastern Dog&quot; and &quot;Western Dog&quot; respectively. They have also been called the White Dogs (Paichuan, Baiquan) or White Dog Islands (; Băh-kēng-dō̤) or Baiken Islands (白肯島). The name Baiquan (白犬) has been connected with the homophonous name Baiquan (白畎).

==History==
On May 15, 1617, sixty-nine &quot;wokou&quot; were captured alive in the area.

In 1872, construction of Dongsha (Tungsha) Lighthouse (Dongquan Lighthouse) began.

In December 1939, Japanese naval forces from Taiwan occupied the islands.

The islands were originally part of the Changle County before the ROC government evacuated to Taiwan. It is considered by the People&#x27;s Republic of China government as part of Changle City of the Fuzhou City.

In September 1953, the Changlo County () government was established on the islands.

Western Enterprises (西方公司), a CIA front organization, had a communications base on Xiquan (Hsichuan).

After a series of combat readiness tests carried out by MAAG were completed on April 15, 1955, the overall Chinese Nationalist defense preparations for the Matsu Islands were rated as satisfactory. One of the weaknesses noted was &quot;the seriously understrength regiment garrisoning the Paichuan (White Dog) Islands group&quot;.

In July 1956, the islands were transferred to Lienchiang County. The islands were divided into two townships: Xiquan and Dongquan.

On August 19, 1958, President Chiang Kai-shek visited Xiju Island (then Xiquan) and spoke to the soldiers there.

In September 1960, the two townships were united into one, Paichuan (Baiquan) township.

On July 23, 1964, Chiang Ching-kuo visited the islands.

On October 15, 1971, the Executive Yuan approved changing the name of the township from Baiquan Township (Paichuan, White Dogs; ) to Juguang Township (Chukuang; ). They also approved changing the name of Xiquan Island (Hsichuan; ) to Xiju Island (Hsiju; ) and Dongquan Island (Tungchuan; ) to Dongju Island (Tungchu; ).

On December 30, 1977, the 6-ton fishing boat Kuanghua 16638 was slammed by a communist vessel near the Liuchuan reefs () off the coast of Chukuang.

On September 21, 1979, and on May 3, 1980, President Chiang Ching-kuo visited the township.

On June 18, 1993, President Lee Teng-hui visited the Dongju Elementary School.

On June 24, 2001, Typhoon Chebi caused 3,000,000 yuan of damage on the islands.

In the 2018 election, Mayor Hsieh Chun-Lan () was re-elected mayor, defeating her opponent Chen Shun-Shou () by over a hundred votes. Hsieh called for rebuilding the former township office as a resort, beautification of the township, and creation of a vibrant sight-seeing economy.

In 2020, undersea communications cables between Nangan and Juguang were damaged by sand dredgers from mainland China on five occasions, disrupting phone and internet services.

==Geography==
Dongju (Tong Chu), the southernmost of the Matsu Islands, is 2.63 km2 and Sijyu 2.36 km2. Islets includes like Yongliu (永留嶼 Yongliu) near Dongju. Dongju is shaped like a dagger, while Xiju a triangle, so seemingly bigger on maps. Some cliffs of Dongjyu is severely corroded by wind, creating a strangely aesthetic appearance. Other islands include Linaoyu () also known as Lintouyu (), Xiniuyu (), Dayu (), Xiaoyu (), and Sheshan (). The northernmost and easternmost points of Juguang Township are on Dayu, the westernmost point is on Sheshan, and the southernmost point is on Linaoyu. Linaoyu is also the southernmost point of the Matsu Islands.

Juguang is across from Meihua Town (), Changle District, Fuzhou, Fujian, China (PRC).

===Water supply===

Previously, water supply had been scarce in Xiju Island despite having water wells drilled around the island by the residents. Later the military built a dam and formed the Ledao&#x27;ao Reservoir for the water needs of residents, defense and irrigation.

<text>Abraham Grace Merritt (January 20, 1884 – August 21, 1943) – known by his byline, A. Merritt – was an American Sunday magazine editor and a writer of fantastic fiction.

The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted him in 1999, its fourth class of two deceased and two living writers.

==Life==
Born in Beverly, New Jersey, he moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1894. Originally trained in law, he turned to journalism, first as a correspondent and later as editor. According to Peter Haining, Merritt survived a harrowing experience while a young reporter at &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; about which he refused to ever speak, but would, as Haining claims, mark a turning point in Merritt&#x27;s life. He was assistant editor of &quot;The American Weekly&quot; from 1912 to 1937 under Morrill Goddard, then its editor from 1937 until his death. As editor, he hired the unheralded new artists Virgil Finlay and Hannes Bok and promoted the work done on polio by Sister Elizabeth Kenny.

His fiction, eight complete novels and a number of short stories, was only a sideline to his journalism career. One of the best-paid journalists of his era, Merritt made $25,000 per year by 1919, and at the end of his life was earning $100,000 yearly—exceptional sums for the period. His financial success allowed him to pursue world travel—he invested in real estate in Jamaica and Ecuador—and exotic hobbies, like cultivating orchids and plants linked to witchcraft and magic (monkshood, wolfbane, blue datura, peyote, and cannabis).

He was described as a hypochondriac who talked endlessly about his medical symptoms, and showed eccentric behavior like a need to try out any food, tobacco and medicine he found on his coworkers desks. Occasionally he would dress in a kilt and play serenades for his coworkers with some of his huge collection of instruments he kept in a locked closet at work. He was well liked for his fairness and inability to fire any employees.

Merritt married twice, once in the 1910s to Eleanore Ratcliffe, with whom he raised an adopted daughter, and again in the 1930s to Eleanor H. Johnson. He lived in the Hollis Park Gardens neighborhood of Queens, New York City, where he accumulated collections of weapons, carvings, and primitive masks from his travels, as well as a library of occult literature that reportedly exceeded 5000 volumes. He died suddenly of a heart attack, at his winter home in Indian Rocks Beach, Florida, in 1943.

==Writing==
Merritt&#x27;s writings were heavily influenced by H. Rider Haggard, Robert W. Chambers, Helena Blavatsky and Gertrude Barrows Bennett (writing as Francis Stevens), with Merritt having &quot;emulated Bennett&#x27;s earlier style and themes.&quot; Merritt&#x27;s stories typically revolve around conventional pulp magazine themes: lost civilizations, hideous monsters, etc. His heroes are gallant Irishmen or Scandinavians, his villains treacherous Germans or Russians and his heroines often virginal, mysterious and scantily clad.

What sets Merritt apart from the typical pulp author, however, is his lush, florid prose style and his exhaustive, at times exhausting, penchant for adjective-laden detail. Merritt&#x27;s fondness for micro-description nicely complements the pointillistic style of Bok&#x27;s illustrations.

Merritt&#x27;s first fantasy story was published in 1917, &quot;Through the Dragon Glass&quot; in the November 14 issue of Frank Munsey&#x27;s &quot;All-Story Weekly&quot;. Other short stories and serial novels followed in the Munsey magazines &quot;All-Story&quot;, &quot;Argosy All-Story&quot;, and &quot;Argosy&quot;: &quot;The People of the Pit&quot; (1918), &quot;The Moon Pool&quot; (1918), &quot;The Conquest of the Moon Pool&quot; (1919), &quot;Three Lines of Old French&quot; (1919), &quot;The Metal Monster&quot; (1920), &quot;The Face in the Abyss&quot; (1923), &quot;The Ship of Ishtar&quot; (1924), &quot;Seven Footprints to Satan&quot; (1927), &quot;The Snake Mother&quot; (1930), &quot;Burn Witch Burn!&quot; (1932), &quot;Dwellers in the Mirage&quot; (1932), and &quot;Creep, Shadow!&quot; (1934). Meanwhile, rather few of his stories appeared elsewhere: &quot;The Pool of the Stone God&quot; (in his own &quot;American Weekly&quot;, 1923), &quot;The Woman of the Wood&quot; (&quot;Weird Tales&quot;, 1926), &quot;The Metal Emperor&quot; (&quot;Science and Invention&quot;, 1927), and &quot;The Drone Man&quot; (&quot;Fantasy Magazine&quot;, 1934).

Merritt also contributed to the round robin story &quot;The Challenge from Beyond&quot; with Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, C. L. Moore, and Frank Belknap Long.

&quot;The Fox Woman and the Blue Pagoda&quot; (1946) combined an unfinished story with a conclusion written by Merritt&#x27;s friend Hannes Bok. &quot;The Fox Woman and Other Stories&quot; (1949) collected the same fragment, minus Bok&#x27;s conclusion, with Merritt&#x27;s short stories. The book &quot;The Black Wheel&quot; was published in 1948, after Merritt&#x27;s death; it was written by Bok using previously unpublished material as well. Both these books were also illustrated by Bok and published by the small press The New Collectors Group in hardcover.

After Merritt&#x27;s death, Sam Moskowitz discovered a number of poems among his papers. Though some may have been written by other authors, they were credited to Merritt when published.

==Reputation==
Merritt was a major influence on H. P. Lovecraft and Richard Shaver, and highly esteemed by his friend and frequent collaborator Hannes Bok, a science fiction illustrator. Karl Edward Wagner included &quot;Burn Witch Burn&quot; on his list of &quot;The Thirteen Best Supernatural Horror Novels&quot; in the May 1983 issue of &quot;The Twilight Zone Magazine&quot;. Michael Moorcock and James Cawthorn list &quot;The Ship of Ishtar&quot; and &quot;Dwellers in the Mirage&quot; as two of the novels in their book &quot;Fantasy: the 100 Best Books&quot;, describing the former book as Merritt &quot;at the peak of his powers&quot;, and Merritt&#x27;s work as a whole being full of &quot;memorable images&quot;. Robert Bloch also included &quot;Burn Witch Burn&quot; on his list of favourite horror novels. Gary Gygax, co-creator of the game&quot; Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, listed Merritt in &quot;Appendix N&quot; of the &quot;Dungeon Masters Guide&quot; and often noted that he was one of his favorite fantasy authors. In the &quot;Lensman&quot; series by E. E. Smith, there is a reference to the novel &quot;Dwellers in the Mirage&quot; in which the protagonist Kimball Kinnison references the book and a quotation from it &quot;Luka—turn your wheel so I need not slay this woman!&quot;

<doc id="255952" wikidata="Q379294" url="?curid=255952" title="Head-driven phrase structure grammar">
<text>Head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) is a highly lexicalized, constraint-based grammar

developed by Carl Pollard and Ivan Sag. It is a type of phrase structure grammar, as opposed to a dependency grammar, and it is the immediate successor to generalized phrase structure grammar. HPSG draws from other fields such as computer science (data type theory and knowledge representation) and uses Ferdinand de Saussure&#x27;s notion of the sign. It uses a uniform formalism and is organized in a modular way which makes it attractive for natural language processing.

An HPSG includes principles and grammar rules and lexicon entries which are normally not considered to belong to a grammar. The formalism is based on lexicalism. This means that the lexicon is more than just a list of entries; it is in itself richly structured. Individual entries are marked with types. Types form a hierarchy. Early versions of the grammar were very lexicalized with few grammatical rules (schema). More recent research has tended to add more and richer rules, becoming more like construction grammar.

The basic type HPSG deals with is the sign. Words and phrases are two different subtypes of sign. A word has two features: &quot;[PHON]&quot; (the sound, the phonetic form) and &quot;[SYNSEM]&quot; (the syntactic and semantic information), both of which are split into subfeatures. Signs and rules are formalized as typed feature structures.

==Sample grammar==
HPSG generates strings by combining signs, which are defined by their location within a type hierarchy and by their internal feature structure, represented by attribute value matrices (AVMs).
 Features take types or lists of types as their values, and these values may in turn have their own feature structure. Grammatical rules are largely expressed through the constraints signs place on one another. A sign&#x27;s feature structure describes its phonological, syntactic, and semantic properties. In common notation, AVMs are written with features in upper case and types in italicized lower case. Numbered indices in an AVM represent token identical values.

In the simplified AVM for the word (in this case the verb, not the noun as in &quot;nice walks for the weekend&quot;) &quot;walks&quot; below, the verb&#x27;s categorical information (CAT) is divided into features that describe it (HEAD) and features that describe its arguments (VALENCE).

&quot;Walks&quot; is a sign of type &quot;word&quot; with a head of type &quot;verb&quot;. As an intransitive verb, &quot;walks&quot; has no complement but requires a subject that is a third person singular noun. The semantic value of the subject (CONTENT) is co-indexed with the verb&#x27;s only argument (the individual doing the walking). The following AVM for &quot;she&quot; represents a sign with a SYNSEM value that could fulfill those requirements.

Signs of type &quot;phrase&quot; unify with one or more children and propagate information upward. The following AVM encodes the immediate dominance rule for a &quot;head-subj-phrase&quot;, which requires two children: the head child (a verb) and a non-head child that fulfills the verb&#x27;s SUBJ constraints.

The end result is a sign with a verb head, empty subcategorization features, and a phonological value that orders the two children.

Although the actual grammar of HPSG is composed entirely of feature structures, linguists often use trees to represent the unification of signs where the equivalent AVM would be unwieldy.

==Implementations==
Various parsers based on the HPSG formalism have been written and optimizations are currently being investigated. An example of a system analyzing German sentences is provided by the Freie Universität Berlin. In addition the CoreGram project of the Grammar Group of the Freie Universität Berlin provides open source grammars that were implemented in the TRALE system. Currently there are grammars for German, Danish, Mandarin Chinese, Maltese, and Persian that share a common core and are publicly available.

Large HPSG grammars of various languages are being developed in the Deep Linguistic Processing with HPSG Initiative (DELPH-IN). Wide-coverage grammars of English, German, and Japanese are available under an open-source license. These grammars can be used with a variety of inter-compatible open-source HPSG parsers: LKB, PET, Ace, and &quot;agree&quot;. All of these produce semantic representations in the format of “Minimal Recursion Semantics,” MRS. The declarative nature of the HPSG formalism means that these computational grammars can typically be used for both parsing and generation (producing surface strings from semantic inputs). Treebanks, also distributed by DELPH-IN, are used to develop and test the grammars, as well as to train ranking models to decide on plausible interpretations when parsing (or realizations when generating).

&quot;Enju&quot; is a freely available wide-coverage probabilistic HPSG parser for English developed by the Tsujii Laboratory at The University of Tokyo in Japan.

<doc id="255953" wikidata="Q752529" url="?curid=255953" title="Wood hoopoe">
<text>The wood hoopoes or scimitarbills are a small African family, Phoeniculidae, of near passerine birds. They live south of the Sahara Desert and are not migratory. While the family is now restricted to Sub-Saharan Africa, fossil evidence shows that it once had a larger distribution. Fossils attributed to this family have been found in Miocene rocks in Germany.

The wood hoopoes are related to the kingfishers, the rollers, and the hoopoe, forming a clade with this last according to Hackett &quot;et al.&quot; (2008). A close relationship between the hoopoe and the wood hoopoes is also supported by the shared and unique nature of their stapes. The wood hoopoes most resemble the true hoopoes with their long down-curved bills and short rounded wings. According to genetic studies, the two genera, &quot;Phoeniculus&quot; and &quot;Rhinopomastus&quot;, appear to have diverged about ten million years ago, so some systematists treat them as separate subfamilies or even separate families.

==Description==
The wood hoopoes are a morphologically distinct group, unlikely to be mistaken for any other. These species are medium-sized ( long, much of which is the tail). They have metallic plumage, often blue, green or purple, and lack a crest. The sexes are similar in all but two species, the forest wood hoopoe and the common scimitarbill. Their bills are either red or black, although young red-billed species also have black bills and bill colour is correlated with age. The legs are scarlet or black, short, with thick tarsi. They climb tree trunks in the manner of a woodpecker, and when feeding on the ground they hop rather than walking like the true hoopoe. Their tails are long and strongly graduated (the central feathers are the longest), and marked conspicuously with white, as are their wings.

==Range and behaviour==

These are birds of open woodland, savannah, or thornbrush, and are mainly arboreal. They require large trees both for feeding on as well as to provide hollows for nesting and nocturnal roosting. Two species are found exclusively in rainforest, the forest wood hoopoe and the white-headed wood hoopoe. All the other species are found in more open woodland and bush.

They feed on arthropods, especially insects, which they find by probing with their bills in rotten wood and in crevices in bark. They nest in unlined tree holes, laying two to four eggs, which are blue, grey, or olive, and unmarked in most species.

Hoopoes hunt for prey primarily on the ground as they use their tongue-like beaks to pick up insects on the soil or grass. The Hoopoe&#x27;s tongue occupy 2/3 length of the beak.

==Species==

There are eight species.

Family: Phoeniculidae

<text>A DNA microarray (also commonly known as DNA chip or biochip) is a collection of microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid surface. Scientists use DNA microarrays to measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously or to genotype multiple regions of a genome. Each DNA spot contains picomoles (10−12 moles) of a specific DNA sequence, known as &quot;probes&quot; (or &quot;reporters&quot; or &quot;oligos&quot;). These can be a short section of a gene or other DNA element that are used to hybridize a cDNA or cRNA (also called anti-sense RNA) sample (called &quot;target&quot;) under high-stringency conditions. Probe-target hybridization is usually detected and quantified by detection of fluorophore-, silver-, or chemiluminescence-labeled targets to determine relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in the target. The original nucleic acid arrays were macro arrays approximately 9 cm × 12 cm and the first computerized image based analysis was published in 1981. It was invented by Patrick O. Brown. An example of its application is in SNPs arrays for polymorphisms in cardiovascular diseases, cancer, pathogens and GWAS analysis. It is also used for the identification of structural variations and the measurement of gene expression.

== Principle ==


The core principle behind microarrays is hybridization between two DNA strands, the property of complementary nucleic acid sequences to specifically pair with each other by forming hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleotide base pairs. A high number of complementary base pairs in a nucleotide sequence means tighter non-covalent bonding between the two strands. After washing off non-specific bonding sequences, only strongly paired strands will remain hybridized. Fluorescently labeled target sequences that bind to a probe sequence generate a signal that depends on the hybridization conditions (such as temperature), and washing after hybridization. Total strength of the signal, from a spot (feature), depends upon the amount of target sample binding to the probes present on that spot. Microarrays use relative quantitation in which the intensity of a feature is compared to the intensity of the same feature under a different condition, and the identity of the feature is known by its position.

== Uses and types ==

Many types of arrays exist and the broadest distinction is whether they are spatially arranged on a surface or on coded beads:
* The traditional solid-phase array is a collection of orderly microscopic &quot;spots&quot;, called features, each with thousands of identical and specific probes attached to a solid surface, such as glass, plastic or silicon biochip (commonly known as a &quot;genome chip&quot;, &quot;DNA chip&quot; or &quot;gene array&quot;). Thousands of these features can be placed in known locations on a single DNA microarray.
* The alternative bead array is a collection of microscopic polystyrene beads, each with a specific probe and a ratio of two or more dyes, which do not interfere with the fluorescent dyes used on the target sequence.

DNA microarrays can be used to detect DNA (as in comparative genomic hybridization), or detect RNA (most commonly as cDNA after reverse transcription) that may or may not be translated into proteins. The process of measuring gene expression via cDNA is called expression analysis or expression profiling.

Applications include:

Specialised arrays tailored to particular crops are becoming increasingly popular in molecular breeding applications. In the future they could be used to screen seedlings at early stages to lower the number of unneeded seedlings tried out in breeding operations.

=== Fabrication ===
Microarrays can be manufactured in different ways, depending on the number of probes under examination, costs, customization requirements, and the type of scientific question being asked. Arrays from commercial vendors may have as few as 10 probes or as many as 5 million or more micrometre-scale probes.
=== Spotted vs. &quot;in situ&quot; synthesised arrays ===
Microarrays can be fabricated using a variety of technologies, including printing with fine-pointed pins onto glass slides, photolithography using pre-made masks, photolithography using dynamic micromirror devices, ink-jet printing, or electrochemistry on microelectrode arrays.

In &quot;spotted microarrays&quot;, the probes are oligonucleotides, cDNA or small fragments of PCR products that correspond to mRNAs. The probes are synthesized prior to deposition on the array surface and are then &quot;spotted&quot; onto glass. A common approach utilizes an array of fine pins or needles controlled by a robotic arm that is dipped into wells containing DNA probes and then depositing each probe at designated locations on the array surface. The resulting &quot;grid&quot; of probes represents the nucleic acid profiles of the prepared probes and is ready to receive complementary cDNA or cRNA &quot;targets&quot; derived from experimental or clinical samples.
This technique is used by research scientists around the world to produce &quot;in-house&quot; printed microarrays in their own labs. These arrays may be easily customized for each experiment, because researchers can choose the probes and printing locations on the arrays, synthesize the probes in their own lab (or collaborating facility), and spot the arrays. They can then generate their own labeled samples for hybridization, hybridize the samples to the array, and finally scan the arrays with their own equipment. This provides a relatively low-cost microarray that may be customized for each study, and avoids the costs of purchasing often more expensive commercial arrays that may represent vast numbers of genes that are not of interest to the investigator.
Publications exist which indicate in-house spotted microarrays may not provide the same level of sensitivity compared to commercial oligonucleotide arrays, possibly owing to the small batch sizes and reduced printing efficiencies when compared to industrial manufactures of oligo arrays.

In &quot;oligonucleotide microarrays&quot;, the probes are short sequences designed to match parts of the sequence of known or predicted open reading frames. Although oligonucleotide probes are often used in &quot;spotted&quot; microarrays, the term &quot;oligonucleotide array&quot; most often refers to a specific technique of manufacturing. Oligonucleotide arrays are produced by printing short oligonucleotide sequences designed to represent a single gene or family of gene splice-variants by synthesizing this sequence directly onto the array surface instead of depositing intact sequences. Sequences may be longer (60-mer probes such as the Agilent design) or shorter (25-mer probes produced by Affymetrix) depending on the desired purpose; longer probes are more specific to individual target genes, shorter probes may be spotted in higher density across the array and are cheaper to manufacture.
One technique used to produce oligonucleotide arrays include photolithographic synthesis (Affymetrix) on a silica substrate where light and light-sensitive masking agents are used to &quot;build&quot; a sequence one nucleotide at a time across the entire array. Each applicable probe is selectively &quot;unmasked&quot; prior to bathing the array in a solution of a single nucleotide, then a masking reaction takes place and the next set of probes are unmasked in preparation for a different nucleotide exposure. After many repetitions, the sequences of every probe become fully constructed. More recently, Maskless Array Synthesis from NimbleGen Systems has combined flexibility with large numbers of probes.

=== Two-channel vs. one-channel detection ===
&quot;Two-color microarrays&quot; or &quot;two-channel microarrays&quot; are typically hybridized with cDNA prepared from two samples to be compared (e.g. diseased tissue versus healthy tissue) and that are labeled with two different fluorophores. Fluorescent dyes commonly used for cDNA labeling include Cy3, which has a fluorescence emission wavelength of 570 nm (corresponding to the green part of the light spectrum), and Cy5 with a fluorescence emission wavelength of 670 nm (corresponding to the red part of the light spectrum). The two Cy-labeled cDNA samples are mixed and hybridized to a single microarray that is then scanned in a microarray scanner to visualize fluorescence of the two fluorophores after excitation with a laser beam of a defined wavelength. Relative intensities of each fluorophore may then be used in ratio-based analysis to identify up-regulated and down-regulated genes.

Oligonucleotide microarrays often carry control probes designed to hybridize with RNA spike-ins. The degree of hybridization between the spike-ins and the control probes is used to normalize the hybridization measurements for the target probes. Although absolute levels of gene expression may be determined in the two-color array in rare instances, the relative differences in expression among different spots within a sample and between samples is the preferred method of data analysis for the two-color system. Examples of providers for such microarrays includes Agilent with their Dual-Mode platform, Eppendorf with their DualChip platform for colorimetric Silverquant labeling, and TeleChem International with Arrayit.

In &quot;single-channel microarrays&quot; or &quot;one-color microarrays&quot;, the arrays provide intensity data for each probe or probe set indicating a relative level of hybridization with the labeled target. However, they do not truly indicate abundance levels of a gene but rather relative abundance when compared to other samples or conditions when processed in the same experiment. Each RNA molecule encounters protocol and batch-specific bias during amplification, labeling, and hybridization phases of the experiment making comparisons between genes for the same microarray uninformative. The comparison of two conditions for the same gene requires two separate single-dye hybridizations. Several popular single-channel systems are the Affymetrix &quot;Gene Chip&quot;, Illumina &quot;Bead Chip&quot;, Agilent single-channel arrays, the Applied Microarrays &quot;CodeLink&quot; arrays, and the Eppendorf &quot;DualChip &amp; Silverquant&quot;. One strength of the single-dye system lies in the fact that an aberrant sample cannot affect the raw data derived from other samples, because each array chip is exposed to only one sample (as opposed to a two-color system in which a single low-quality sample may drastically impinge on overall data precision even if the other sample was of high quality). Another benefit is that data are more easily compared to arrays from different experiments as long as batch effects have been accounted for.

One channel microarray may be the only choice in some situations. Suppose formula_1 samples need to be compared: then the number of experiments required using the two channel arrays quickly becomes unfeasible, unless a sample is used as a reference. 
===A typical protocol===
This is an example of a DNA microarray experiment which includes details for a particular case to better explain DNA microarray experiments, while listing modifications for RNA or other alternative experiments.

# The two samples to be compared (pairwise comparison) are grown/acquired. In this example treated sample (case) and untreated sample (control).
# The nucleic acid of interest is purified: this can be RNA for expression profiling, DNA for comparative hybridization, or DNA/RNA bound to a particular protein which is immunoprecipitated (ChIP-on-chip) for epigenetic or regulation studies. In this example total RNA is isolated (both nuclear and cytoplasmic) by guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction (e.g. Trizol) which isolates most RNA (whereas column methods have a cut off of 200 nucleotides) and if done correctly has a better purity.
# The purified RNA is analysed for quality (by capillary electrophoresis) and quantity (for example, by using a NanoDrop or NanoPhotometer spectrometer). If the material is of acceptable quality and sufficient quantity is present (e.g., &gt;1μg, although the required amount varies by microarray platform), the experiment can proceed.
# The labeled product is generated via reverse transcription and followed by an optional PCR amplification. The RNA is reverse transcribed with either polyT primers (which amplify only mRNA) or random primers (which amplify all RNA, most of which is rRNA). miRNA microarrays ligate an oligonucleotide to the purified small RNA (isolated with a fractionator), which is then reverse transcribed and amplified.
#* The label is added either during the reverse transcription step, or following amplification if it is performed. The sense labeling is dependent on the microarray; e.g. if the label is added with the RT mix, the cDNA is antisense and the microarray probe is sense, except in the case of negative controls.
#* The label is typically fluorescent; only one machine uses radiolabels.
#* The labeling can be direct (not used) or indirect (requires a coupling stage). For two-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs before hybridization, using aminoallyl uridine triphosphate (aminoallyl-UTP, or aaUTP) and NHS amino-reactive dyes (such as cyanine dyes); for single-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs after hybridization, using biotin and labeled streptavidin. The modified nucleotides (usually in a ratio of 1 aaUTP: 4 TTP (thymidine triphosphate)) are added enzymatically in a low ratio to normal nucleotides, typically resulting in 1 every 60 bases. The aaDNA is then purified with a column (using a phosphate buffer solution, as Tris contains amine groups). The aminoallyl group is an amine group on a long linker attached to the nucleobase, which reacts with a reactive dye.
#** A form of replicate known as a dye flip can be performed to control for dye artifacts in two-channel experiments; for a dye flip, a second slide is used, with the labels swapped (the sample that was labeled with Cy3 in the first slide is labeled with Cy5, and vice versa). In this example, aminoallyl-UTP is present in the reverse-transcribed mixture.
# The labeled samples are then mixed with a proprietary hybridization solution which can consist of SDS, SSC, dextran sulfate, a blocking agent (such as Cot-1 DNA, salmon sperm DNA, calf thymus DNA, PolyA, or PolyT), Denhardt&#x27;s solution, or formamine.
# The mixture is denatured and added to the pinholes of the microarray. The holes are sealed and the microarray hybridized, either in a hyb oven, where the microarray is mixed by rotation, or in a mixer, where the microarray is mixed by alternating pressure at the pinholes.
# After an overnight hybridization, all nonspecific binding is washed off (SDS and SSC).
# The microarray is dried and scanned by a machine that uses a laser to excite the dye and measures the emission levels with a detector.
# The image is gridded with a template and the intensities of each feature (composed of several pixels) is quantified.
# The raw data is normalized; the simplest normalization method is to subtract background intensity and scale so that the total intensities of the features of the two channels are equal, or to use the intensity of a reference gene to calculate the t-value for all of the intensities. More sophisticated methods include z-ratio, loess and lowess regression and RMA (robust multichip analysis) for Affymetrix chips (single-channel, silicon chip, &quot;in situ&quot; synthesized short oligonucleotides).

== Microarrays and bioinformatics ==
The advent of inexpensive microarray experiments created several specific bioinformatics challenges: the multiple levels of replication in experimental design (Experimental design); the number of platforms and independent groups and data format (Standardization); the statistical treatment of the data (Data analysis); mapping each probe to the mRNA transcript that it measures (Annotation); the sheer volume of data and the ability to share it (Data warehousing).

=== Experimental design ===
Due to the biological complexity of gene expression, the considerations of experimental design that are discussed in the expression profiling article are of critical importance if statistically and biologically valid conclusions are to be drawn from the data.

There are three main elements to consider when designing a microarray experiment. First, replication of the biological samples is essential for drawing conclusions from the experiment. Second, technical replicates (e.g. two RNA samples obtained from each experimental unit) may help to quantitate precision. The biological replicates include independent RNA extractions. Technical replicates may be two of the same extraction. Third, spots of each cDNA clone or oligonucleotide are present as replicates (at least duplicates) on the microarray slide, to provide a measure of technical precision in each hybridization. It is critical that information about the sample preparation and handling is discussed, in order to help identify the independent units in the experiment and to avoid inflated estimates of statistical significance.

=== Standardization ===
Microarray data is difficult to exchange due to the lack of standardization in platform fabrication, assay protocols, and analysis methods. This presents an interoperability problem in bioinformatics. Various grass-roots open-source projects are trying to ease the exchange and analysis of data produced with non-proprietary chips:

For example, the &quot;Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment&quot; (MIAME) checklist helps define the level of detail that should exist and is being adopted by many journals as a requirement for the submission of papers incorporating microarray results. But MIAME does not describe the format for the information, so while many formats can support the MIAME requirements, no format permits verification of complete semantic compliance. The &quot;MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) Project&quot; is being conducted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to develop standards and quality control metrics which will eventually allow the use of MicroArray data in drug discovery, clinical practice and regulatory decision-making. The MGED Society has developed standards for the representation of gene expression experiment results and relevant annotations.

=== Data analysis ===


Microarray data sets are commonly very large, and analytical precision is influenced by a number of variables. Statistical challenges include taking into account effects of background noise and appropriate normalization of the data. Normalization methods may be suited to specific platforms and, in the case of commercial platforms, the analysis may be proprietary. Algorithms that affect statistical analysis include:

* Image analysis: gridding, spot recognition of the scanned image (segmentation algorithm), removal or marking of poor-quality and low-intensity features (called &quot;flagging&quot;).
* Data processing: background subtraction (based on global or local background), determination of spot intensities and intensity ratios, visualisation of data (e.g. see MA plot), and log-transformation of ratios, global or local normalization of intensity ratios, and segmentation into different copy number regions using step detection algorithms.
* Class discovery analysis: This analytic approach, sometimes called unsupervised classification or knowledge discovery, tries to identify whether microarrays (objects, patients, mice, etc.) or genes cluster together in groups. Identifying naturally existing groups of objects (microarrays or genes) which cluster together can enable the discovery of new groups that otherwise were not previously known to exist. During knowledge discovery analysis, various unsupervised classification techniques can be employed with DNA microarray data to identify novel clusters (classes) of arrays. This type of approach is not hypothesis-driven, but rather is based on iterative pattern recognition or statistical learning methods to find an &quot;optimal&quot; number of clusters in the data. Examples of unsupervised analyses methods include self-organizing maps, neural gas, k-means cluster analyses, hierarchical cluster analysis, Genomic Signal Processing based clustering and model-based cluster analysis. For some of these methods the user also has to define a distance measure between pairs of objects. Although the Pearson correlation coefficient is usually employed, several other measures have been proposed and evaluated in the literature. The input data used in class discovery analyses are commonly based on lists of genes having high informativeness (low noise) based on low values of the coefficient of variation or high values of Shannon entropy, etc. The determination of the most likely or optimal number of clusters obtained from an unsupervised analysis is called cluster validity. Some commonly used metrics for cluster validity are the silhouette index, Davies-Bouldin index, Dunn&#x27;s index, or Hubert&#x27;s formula_2 statistic. 
* Class prediction analysis: This approach, called supervised classification, establishes the basis for developing a predictive model into which future unknown test objects can be input in order to predict the most likely class membership of the test objects. Supervised analysis for class prediction involves use of techniques such as linear regression, k-nearest neighbor, learning vector quantization, decision tree analysis, random forests, naive Bayes, logistic regression, kernel regression, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, mixture of experts, and supervised neural gas. In addition, various metaheuristic methods are employed, such as genetic algorithms, covariance matrix self-adaptation, particle swarm optimization, and ant colony optimization. Input data for class prediction are usually based on filtered lists of genes which are predictive of class, determined using classical hypothesis tests (next section), Gini diversity index, or information gain (entropy).
* Hypothesis-driven statistical analysis: Identification of statistically significant changes in gene expression are commonly identified using the t-test, ANOVA, Bayesian method Mann–Whitney test methods tailored to microarray data sets, which take into account multiple comparisons or cluster analysis. These methods assess statistical power based on the variation present in the data and the number of experimental replicates, and can help minimize type I and type II errors in the analyses.

* Dimensional reduction: Analysts often reduce the number of dimensions (genes) prior to data analysis. This may involve linear approaches such as principal components analysis (PCA), or non-linear manifold learning (distance metric learning) using kernel PCA, diffusion maps, Laplacian eigenmaps, local linear embedding, locally preserving projections, and Sammon&#x27;s mapping.
* Network-based methods: Statistical methods that take the underlying structure of gene networks into account, representing either associative or causative interactions or dependencies among gene products. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis is widely used for identifying co-expression modules and intramodular hub genes. Modules may corresponds to cell types or pathways. Highly connected intramodular hubs best represent their respective modules.

Microarray data may require further processing aimed at reducing the dimensionality of the data to aid comprehension and more focused analysis. Other methods permit analysis of data consisting of a low number of biological or technical replicates; for example, the Local Pooled Error (LPE) test pools standard deviations of genes with similar expression levels in an effort to compensate for insufficient replication.

=== Annotation ===
The relation between a probe and the mRNA that it is expected to detect is not trivial. Some mRNAs may cross-hybridize probes in the array that are supposed to detect another mRNA. In addition, mRNAs may experience amplification bias that is sequence or molecule-specific. Thirdly, probes that are designed to detect the mRNA of a particular gene may be relying on genomic EST information that is incorrectly associated with that gene.

=== Data warehousing ===
Microarray data was found to be more useful when compared to other similar datasets. The sheer volume of data, specialized formats (such as MIAME), and curation efforts associated with the datasets require specialized databases to store the data. A number of open-source data warehousing solutions, such as InterMine and BioMart, have been created for the specific purpose of integrating diverse biological datasets, and also support analysis.

== Alternative technologies ==
Advances in massively parallel sequencing has led to the development of RNA-Seq technology, that enables a whole transcriptome shotgun approach to characterize and quantify gene expression. Unlike microarrays, which need a reference genome and transcriptome to be available before the microarray itself can be designed, RNA-Seq can also be used for new model organisms whose genome has not been sequenced yet.

<text>The ground rollers, Brachypteraciidae, are a small family of non-migratory birds restricted to Madagascar. 
They are members of the order Coraciiformes and are most closely related to the rollers in the family Coraciidae.

==Description==
Ground rollers share the generally crow-like size and build of the true rollers, ranging from in length, and also hunt reptiles and large insects. They are more terrestrial than Coracidae species, and this is reflected in their longer legs and shorter, more rounded wings.

They lack the highly colourful appearance of the true rollers, and are duller in appearance, with striped or flecked plumage. They are much more elusive and shy than their relatives, and are normally difficult to find in the Malagasy forests. Often the hooting breeding call is all that betrays their presence.

These birds nest as solitary pairs in holes in the ground which they excavate themselves, unlike the true rollers, which rarely nest in ground holes and even then do not dig their own nests.

==Taxonomy==
The phylogenetic relationship between the six families that make up the order Coraciiformes is shown in the cladogram below. The number of species in each family is taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).
mtDNA analyses confirmed the systematics of this group but indicated that merging &quot;Geobiastes&quot; into &quot;Brachypteracias&quot;, as was usually done since the 1960s, should be reversed at least until a more comprehensive review (e.g. supported by fossils) is possible (Kirchman &quot;et al.&quot;, 2001). Also, 2000-year-old subfossil remains of ground rollers are known from the Holocene of Ampoza (Goodman, 2000); Eocene remains from Europe at first tentatively assigned to this family were later recognized as quite distinct (Mayr &amp; Mourer-Chauviré 2000). Presently, there is no indication that ground rollers ever occurred anywhere outside Madagascar (Mayr &amp; Mourer-Chauviré, 2001).

==Species==

There are five extant species in four genera in the family Brachypteraciidae:
An extinct species, the Ampoza ground roller (&quot;Brachypteracias langrandi&quot;), of presumed Holocene age, was described in 2000 based on a single humerus.

<text>Klaus Heinrich Thomas Mann (18 November 1906 – 21 May 1949) was a German writer and dissident. He was the son of Thomas Mann, a nephew of Heinrich Mann and brother of Erika Mann (with whom he maintained a lifelong close relationship) and Golo Mann.

Klaus moved to the USA to escape Nazism, and after training in counterintelligence as one of the Ritchie Boys, he served in Europe during the World War II, becoming one of the first outsiders to witness the horrors of the concentration camps. His books &quot;Escape to Life&quot; (co-written with his sister Erika Mann), and &quot;The Turning Point&quot; have attained a historical importance as frequently cited primary documents of the experience of exile undergone by members of the German intelligentsia and arts community who fled the Third Reich. This genre is referred to as Exilliteratur. 

He is best known for his 1936 novel, &quot;Mephisto&quot;, about an actor who sells his soul to the devil, by attaching his career to the rise of the Nazis, which was made into a film of the same name, in 1981—a book that was banned in Western Germany after the war. A semi-fictional work whose protagonist is modeled on Mann&#x27;s former lover Gustaf Gründgrens, &quot;Mephisto&quot; contains enough historical truth to have been banned for nearly a half-century—remaining under legal taboo for decades even after Gründgrens death—on grounds of personality rights. (That is, the character Höffgen in &quot;Mephisto&quot; was found to resemble Gründgrens so closely that the portrayal was considered a violation of his rights of publicity.)

==Life and career==
Born in Munich, Klaus Mann was the son of German writer Thomas Mann and Katia Pringsheim. His father was baptized as a Lutheran, while his mother was from a family of secular Jews. Due to his being the grandson of Júlia da Silva Bruhns, he was also of Portuguese-Indigenous Brazilian partial descent.

Mann&#x27;s early life was described by him as romantic, in beautiful upper-class surroundings (&quot;Je suis de mon temps. Kind dieser Zeit&quot;) but his homosexuality complicated his early adulthood, and he developed a difficult relationship with his father, who only lived out his own homosexuality in a platonic way and processed his experiences in a very sublimated way in literature. Klaus Mann began writing short stories in 1924 and the following year became drama critic for a Berlin newspaper. His first literary works were published in 1925. His first novel &quot;The Pious Dance, Adventure Book of a Youth&quot; (1926) is openly set in Berlin&#x27;s homosexual milieu. 

In 1924 he had become engaged to his childhood friend Pamela Wedekind, the eldest daughter of the playwright Frank Wedekind, who was also a close friend of his sister Erika. The engagement was broken off in January 1928.
In 1927, after a short time in various schools, he traveled with his sister Erika Mann, a year older than himself, around the world, visiting the U.S. In 1929, they reported on the trip in essays published as a collaborative travelogue entitled &quot;Rundherum&quot;. During his early travels often by car throughout Europe and North Africa as well as America and Asia, Erika took the wheel and determined the itinerary to compensate for Mann&#x27;s inability to make personal and useful decisions. That assistance continued even into his later adulthood but could not save him from his own self-destructive behaviors and excessive drug use.

During the time Erika travelled with Klaus to North Africa in 1929, they met Annemarie Schwarzenbach, a Swiss writer and photographer, who remained close to them for the next few years. Klaus made several trips abroad with Annemarie, the final one to a Soviet writers&#x27; congress in Moscow in 1934. During this time and after direct contact with Russian authors and intellectuals, he initiated his critical thinking towards communist ideals and totalitarian ideologies.

===Drug use===
Since young adulthood, Klaus used drugs, mostly opiates, to which he later became heavily addicted. His diaries document an attempted morphine injection in 1933 when Hitler took power. Initially, the aspiring writer used opium, Eukodal and later heroin, possibly to increase his creative energy, as artists and intellectuals in literary circles often did at the time. He underwent drug detoxification in Budapest during his travels, and at the Kilchberg Sanatorium in Switzerland. After 1936, during his stay in New York his drug use and sexual adventures became unconstrained.

===1930s===
In 1932 Klaus wrote the first part of his autobiography, which was well received until Hitler came to power. In 1933 Klaus participated with Erika in a political cabaret, called &quot;Die Pfeffermühle&quot; (&quot;The Pepper-Mill&quot;), which came to the attention of the Nazi regime. The play, which included a daring critique of Hitler, was first performed in Munich and subsequently in Zürich. To escape prosecution he left Germany in March 1933 for Paris, later visiting Amsterdam and Switzerland, where his family had a house.

The same year, Klaus Mann and Annemarie Schwarzenbach, together with Fritz Landshoff and Dutch publisher Emanuel Querido, founded &quot;Die Sammlung&quot;, a literary magazine, first published in September 1933 in Amsterdam. It was primarily affiliated with a number of influential German writers who fled from the Hitler regime during the first years of the establishment and consolidation of Nazi rule, but other internationally acclaimed authors such as Aldous Huxley and Heinrich Mann contributed essays and editorial work. The magazine was funded by Annemarie Schwarzenbach and Klaus&#x27;s father Thomas Mann. Klaus served as editor-in-chief from 1933 to 1935, when &quot;Die Sammlung&quot;&#x27; ceased publication, in part due to disagreements between Klaus and his father, as well as other contributors, over frequent politically motivated content.

Klaus Mann not only played an important role in the consolidation of the German &quot;Exilliteratur&quot; but also communicated with authors who remained in Germany after 1933. In a letter exchange with Gottfried Benn, whose ambivalence towards Nazi rule was well known, Klaus expressed concern about Benn&#x27;s continued membership in the national German academy of writers, pointing out the moral dilemma it posed, even urging him to leave the country to join the German intellectuals in exile. His work Escape to Life, co-authored by his sister Erika, who at the time was a successful writer for the BBC, was the culmination of his efforts to unite German intellectuals against the de-humanizing politics of the German National Socialists.

In 1933 Klaus Mann also made acquaintance with Julien Green, who was a successful French author, and engaged in the French Resistance. Green, who lived in America, attempted to rationalize his homosexual tendencies in the context of religion. Text published by Green indicated a shared sexual behavior with a preference for underaged men. From the homosexual relationships Klaus experienced during his life, however, he tended to seek a bond with men equal to his age or older. In November 1934 Klaus was stripped of German citizenship by the Nazi regime. He became a Czechoslovak citizen.

===&quot;Mephisto&quot;===

In 1936, Klaus Mann wrote his most famous novel, &quot;Mephisto&quot;, which was first published in Amsterdam. The novel portrays actor Hendrik Höfgen&#x27;s rise to nationwide fame in 1936, from humble beginnings in the Hamburger Künstlertheater (Hamburg Artists&#x27; Theater) in 1926. After fleeing to Paris on receiving news of the Nazis&#x27; rise to power, worried about his communist past, he is helped by a former co-actress from Hamburg, Angelika Siebert, who travels to Berlin to convince the girlfriend of a Luftwaffe general to have him pardoned. On returning to Berlin he quickly manages to win over Lotte and her general, and with his support has a wonderful career.

On obtaining the role of Mephisto in &quot;Faust Part One&quot; he realizes that he actually made a pact with evil (i.e. Nazism) and lost his humane values (even denouncing his mistress as &quot;Black Venus&quot;). There are situations where Höfgen tries to help his friends or tell the prime minister about concentration camp hardships, but he is always concerned not to lose his Nazi patrons.

The character of Hendrik Höfgen was based on his former brother-in-law, the actor Gustaf Gründgens. Gründgens&#x27; adopted son brought a legal case to have the novel banned after its first publication in West Germany in the early 1960s. After seven years of legal hearings, the West German Supreme Court upheld the ban, although it continued to be available in East Germany and abroad. The ban was lifted, and the novel published in West.

In 1981, the novel was made into a film co-written and directed by István Szabó, starring Klaus Maria Brandauer, which faithfully followed the plot of the novel. As Höfgen&#x27;s associates and friends flee or are driven underground by the Nazi regime, the popularity of his character ends up superseding his own existence, until he finds that his best performance is keeping up appearances for his Nazi patrons.

===Move to the USA===
In 1936, he moved to the United States, living in Princeton, New Jersey, and New York. In the summer of 1937, he met his partner for the rest of the year, Thomas Quinn Curtiss, who was later a longtime film and theater reviewer for &quot;Variety&quot; and the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;. Mann&#x27;s novel &quot;Der Vulkan&quot; was published in 1939 at the onset of World War 2, and was another attempt by him to portray not only Germans but other European exiles during that time. Despite considered one of his best novels, it never generated any significant sales and was only translated into French.

In 1940 Klaus Mann founded another literary magazine for German writers living in exile in the United States, &quot;Decision&quot;. It lasted for only a year, but consolidated American intellectual opposition to the war with Sherwood Anderson, W. Somerset Maugham, Vincent Sheean and Robert E. Sherwood onto its board of directors. At the time, he was living in February House, and his housemates W. H. Auden and Carson McCullers provided editorial and layout assistance. He eventually moved to his father&#x27;s house in Pacific Palisades when he was unable to support himself financially.

Mann became a U.S. citizen in 1943. The process of naturalization was delayed because of an investigation the FBI conducted into Klaus Mann&#x27;s political and sexual activities, as he was openly gay, but not an adherent of marxist ideologies. Throughout his life in the U.S., he identified himself as a liberal antifascist and cosmopolitan.

===World War II===

In World War II, after training at Camp Ritchie, and becoming one of the Ritchie Boys, a US Army counterintelligence unit, he served as a staff sergeant of the 5th U.S. Army and the British Corps in Italy. Klaus was engaged in psychological warfare designing leaflets intended for German soldiers stationed in Italy and North Africa. In Italy, he was also involved with difficult interrogations of German POWs, including seasoned SS officers.

In his second 1942 autobiography (&quot;Der Wendepunkt, the Turning Point)&quot;, he critically observed the segregation of white army personnel from their black counterparts at Camp Ritchie. In summer 1945, he was sent by units of the U.S. 5th Army and the British 8th Army to Germany. Klaus Mann, a German-American, used the publication &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; to report from Postwar-Germany.

As he visited liberated concentration camps in official function, he was one of the first eye-witnesses to report on the horrors of mass extermination during Nazi rule in Germany. Audiovisual documents of his emotional reporting at these sites in the later 1940s became historical records and are still regarded today as a verification of these crimes against humanity.

==Death and legacy==
Mann died in Cannes from an overdose of sleeping pills on 21 May 1949, following further drug treatment. His death is generally reported as a suicide, linked to financial pressures, opiate addiction, and disillusionment over his treatment by the USA as a homosexual, and supposed communist, but Mann&#x27;s biographer Frederic Spotts argues that the engaged author&#x27;s communications and attitude preceding his sudden overdose suggest accident rather than suicide. He was buried in Cannes at the Cimetière du Grand Jas.

A number of biographies of Klaus Mann appeared much later after his death in Cannes in 1949. Other than one German language author, Nicole Schaenzler, all biographies were written and edited by English or American contributors. Because he wrote frequent autobiographical content, a separation of his literary achievements, mostly unsuccessful during his time, from his life, are difficult. Mann remained active in literary circles, and his personal and spiritual connections with André Gide, and later examination of Gide in his work &quot;Avant la Lettre (1943)&quot; shed significant light on his time and himself.

Later historians celebrated Klaus Mann as a modern liberal or transnational who attempted to break down national boundaries, but Klaus&#x27;s biographical notes reveal that he felt essentially German, and had positive memories of his upbringing in Bavaria. In a pursuit to describe post-war Germany after the destructions of World War 2, he attempted to find his origins while collecting painful impressions from a Germany occupied by foreign military forces and impacted by the loss of its original borders.

<text>Mahathir bin Mohamad (; ; born 10 July 1925) is a Malaysian politician, author, and physician who served as the fourth and seventh Prime Minister of Malaysia. He held office from 1981 to 2003 and later from 2018 to 2020 for a cumulative total of 24 years, making him the country&#x27;s longest-serving prime minister. Before becoming premier, he served as deputy prime minister and in other cabinet positions. He was a Member of Parliament for Langkawi from 2018 to 2022, Kubang Pasu from 1974 to 2004, and Kota Setar Selatan from 1964 to 1969. His political career has spanned more than 75 years, from joining protests opposing citizenship policies for non-Malays in the Malayan Union in the 1940s to forming the Gerakan Tanah Air coalition in 2022. He was granted the soubriquet &quot;Father of Modernisation&quot; (&quot;Bapa Pemodenan&quot;) for his pivotal role in transforming the country&#x27;s economy and infrastructure. Mahathir played a pivotal role in leading the opposition coalition Pakatan Harapan to victory in the 2018 general elections. At the age of 99, he is currently the oldest living former Malaysian prime minister.

Born and raised in Alor Setar, Kedah, Mahathir excelled at school and became a physician. He became active in the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) before entering the parliament of Malaysia in 1964. He served one term before losing his seat, subsequently falling out with Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman and being expelled from UMNO. In 1970, he released the book &quot;The Malay Dilemma&quot;. When Tunku resigned, Mahathir re-entered UMNO and parliament, and was promoted to Minister of Education from 1974 to 1978 and Minister of Trade and Industry from 1978 to 1981. He became Deputy Prime Minister in 1976 before being sworn in as prime minister in 1981.

During Mahathir&#x27;s first tenure, Malaysia underwent modernization and economic growth, and his government initiated widespread industry privatisation and a series of bold infrastructure projects. Mahathir was a dominant political figure, winning five consecutive general elections and fending off several rivals for UMNO&#x27;s leadership. He centralised power through undermining judicial independence and supporting a constitutional amendment to remove legal immunity for royalty. He continued pro-&quot;bumiputera&quot; policies, and oversaw Malaysia&#x27;s relatively fast recovery from the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In 1987, he detained various activists and religious figures under Operation Lalang, and in 1998 had his deputy Anwar Ibrahim arrested. As prime minister, he was an advocate of Asian values and development models, and was particularly prominent across the Muslim world.

In 2002, Mahathir announced his intention to resign as Prime Minister, officially stepping down in 2003 after 22 years in office, but remained politically influential and was critical of his successors. He quit UMNO over the 1MDB corruption scandal in 2016, joining BERSATU and leading the Pakatan Harapan opposition coalition to victory in the 2018 general election. During a second tenure as prime minister, he pledged to investigate the 1MDB scandal, combat corruption, and cut spending on large infrastructure projects. He also secured the pardon and release of Anwar Ibrahim. Mahathir resigned in 2020 amidst a political crisis. Despite losing his parliamentary seat in the 2022 general election, he remained active in politics and shifted party affiliation several times.

Mahathir&#x27;s political views have shifted during his life, and are shaped by his Malay nationalism and Islamic religious beliefs.

==Early life and education==

Mahathir was born at his parents&#x27; home in a poor neighbourhood at Lorong Kilang Ais, Alor Setar, in the capital of the Malay sultanate of Kedah under a British protectorate, on 10 July 1925. He was the first prime minister that was not born into the aristocracy or a prominent religious or political family.

Mahathir&#x27;s mother, Wan Tempawan Wan Hanapi, was a Malay from Kedah. His father, Mohamad Iskandar, was from Penang of Malay and Indian descent. Mahathir&#x27;s paternal grandfather had come from Kerala, British India but many claim that Mahathir&#x27;s paternal grandfather had come from Satkania Upazila, Chittagong, British India (present part of Bangladesh).

Mohamad Iskandar was the principal of an English-medium secondary school, whose lower-middle-class status meant his daughters were unable to enrol in a secondary school. Wan Tempawan had only distant relations to members of Kedah&#x27;s royalty. Both had been married previously. Mahathir was born with six half-siblings and two full-siblings. His childhood home, with a single shared bedroom and no electricity supply, was later converted to a tourist attraction and opened to the public. During his childhood, Mahathir enjoyed playing snakes and ladders and demonstrated multiple creative talents, including playing the trumpet, interior decorating, and engaging in crafts and carpentry work. He once shared that he was bullied in his youth, recalling how he sold balloons for a small profit but was forced by a stronger peer to use his earnings to buy food for him.
Mahathir began his education at Seberang Perak Malay Boys School, Alor Setar, Kedah in 1930. Mahathir was a hard-working student. Discipline imposed by his father motivated him to study, and he showed little interest in sports. Having become fluent in English well ahead of his primary school peers, including editing the English student newspaper and winning a series of language awards, he won a position in a selective English-medium secondary school Government English School in 1933. With schools closed during the Japanese occupation of Malaya in World War II, he started a small business, selling coffee and snacks such as &quot;pisang goreng&quot; (banana fritters).
After the war, Mahathir graduated from secondary school with the highest rank and enrolled to study medicine at the King Edward VII College of Medicine in Singapore. Mahathir studied medicine at what was then called University of Malaya, later renamed University of Singapore. When the university granted him an honorary degree in November 2018, he said &quot;I will always value my stay in Singapore for nearly six years.&quot; During his college years, Mahathir developed a passion for driving, often traveling long distances, including from Singapore to his hometown in Alor Setar, in his convertible. In 1947, Mahathir, writing under the pen name &#x27;Che Det&#x27; in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, published an article titled &quot;Malay Women Make Their Own Freedom&quot;, in which he discussed the struggle of Malay women in the post-war period and stated, &quot;It is up to the men and especially the fathers, to realise that they can no longer confine their womenfolk to the kitchen.&quot;

== Medical career (1953–1959)==

After graduating in 1953 from Universiti Malaya in Singapore, Mahathir began his housemanship at Penang General Hospital. In 1954, he was sent to Alor Setar General Hospital before being posted to government clinics in Langkawi, Jitra, and Perlis. During his time in Langkawi in 1955, Mahathir s the island’s first stationed doctor, witnessing its underdeveloped state—a memory that later influenced his efforts to transform it into a major tourist destination when he became Prime Minister. He then resigned to open his private practice, named &quot;Maha Klinik&quot; (&quot;Maha Clinic&quot;), while his wife worked as a government doctor for 25 years. Maha Klinik was the first privately owned clinic established by a Malay in Malaysia.

Mahathir acquired the reputation of being a caring doctor, willing to make house calls at any hour, trudging across rice fields in the dark to treat patients. If they could not afford his fee, they settled by installments or paid what they had. He was the town&#x27;s first Malay physician and a successful one. He built a large house and employed a Chinese man to chauffeur him in his Pontiac Catalina (most chauffeurs at the time were Malay). Mahathir and Siti Hasmah were also involved in welfare and public health activities. He served as President of the Kedah Tuberculosis Association, visiting Indian workers on rubber plantations to treat the disease, while she volunteered in the Kedah Family Planning Association. With the money from his medical practice, Mahathir indulged in his entrepreneurial streak and invested in property development, tin mining, a franchised petrol station, and a shop to do quick printing–sometimes to rescue Malay businessmen in trouble. He helped found the Malay Chamber of Commerce and served as its director.

==Early political career (1959–1970)==
After World War II ended and the Japanese withdrew, the British grouped the Malay states and the Straits Settlements into the Malayan Union, and granted citizenship to non-Malays. This caused major backlash from Malays and a wave of Malay nationalism swept across the country. Mahathir became politically activated by these changes, joining protests and activism against the new citizenship policies. Mahathir later argued for affirmative action for Malays at medical college. While at college, he contributed to &quot;The Straits Times&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;C.H.E. Det&quot; and a student journal, in which he fiercely promoted Malay rights, such as calling for the restoration of Malay as an official language. While practising as a physician in Alor Setar, Mahathir became active in UMNO. By the time of the first general election for the independent state of Malaya in 1959, he was the chairman of the party in Kedah.

Despite his prominence in UMNO, Mahathir was not a candidate in the 1959 election, ruling himself out following a disagreement with then Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman. Their relationship had been strained since Mahathir had criticised Tunku&#x27;s agreement to retain British and Commonwealth forces in Malaya after independence. Tunku opposed Mahathir&#x27;s plans to introduce minimum educational qualifications for UMNO candidates. For Mahathir, this was a significant enough slight to delay his entry into national politics in protest. He contested in the following general election in 1964, and was elected as the federal parliamentarian for the Alor Setar-based seat of Kota Setar Selatan.

Elected to parliament in a volatile political period, Mahathir, as a backbencher, launched himself into the main conflict of the day: Singapore&#x27;s future, with its large and economically powerful ethnic Chinese population, as a state of Malaysia. He vociferously attacked Singapore&#x27;s dominant People&#x27;s Action Party for being &quot;pro-Chinese&quot; and &quot;anti-Malay&quot; and called its leader, Lee Kuan Yew, &quot;arrogant&quot;. Singapore was expelled from Malaysia in Mahathir&#x27;s first full year in parliament. In 1965, Mahathir stated in Parliament that Article 153 of the Federal Constitution, which grants special rights to Malays, was a source of shame for the community and would eventually be abolished. Despite Mahathir&#x27;s prominence, he lost his seat in the 1969 election, defeated by Yusof Rawa of the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). Mahathir attributed the loss of his seat to ethnic Chinese voters switching support from UMNO to PAS. Being a Malay-dominated seat, only the two major Malay parties fielded candidates, leaving Chinese voters to choose between the Malay-centric UMNO and the Islamist PAS.

Large government losses in the election were followed by the race riots of 13 May 1969. Hundreds of people were killed in clashes between Malays and Chinese. In 1968, Mahathir had expressed concern over escalating racial tensions in two newspaper articles, and feared preventative measures would be needed to avoid violence. Outside parliament, he openly criticised the government, also sending an open dissenting letter to Tunku for failing to uphold Malay interests and calling for his resignation. By the end of the year, Mahathir was fired from UMNO&#x27;s Supreme Council and expelled from the party. Tunku had to be persuaded not to have him arrested.

Expelled from UMNO, Mahathir wrote his first book, &quot;The Malay Dilemma&quot;, in which he set out his vision for the Malay community. The book argued that a balance had to be achieved between government support for Malays, so that their economic interests would not be dominated by the Chinese, and exposing Malays to sufficient competition. Mahathir saw Malays as typically avoiding hard work and failing to &quot;appreciate the real value of money and property&quot;, and hoped this balance would rectify this. Mahathir criticised Tunku&#x27;s government in the book, which led to it being banned in Malaysia. The ban was only lifted in 1981 under Mahathir&#x27;s premiership.

==Rise to prominence (1970–1981)==

In 1971, Mahathir announced his plan to rejoin UMNO, stating he would make a formal statement at an appropriate time. Prime Minister Abdul Razak Hussein encouraged Mahathir to return to UMNO in 1972, marking the beginning of his political resurgence. Recognizing his potential and sharp political acumen, Razak appointed Mahathir as a Senator for Kedah in 1973. Around the same time, Mahathir also became the chairman of Food Industries of Malaysia (FIMA) Sdn. Bhd. In January 1973, as chairman of the FIMA, Mahathir visited a government factory in Pekan Nanas. He faced peaceful protests from over 200 workers demanding better working conditions and wage improvements. After Mahathir spoke to the workers and promised to review their grievances, they dispersed peacefully.

Mahathir rose quickly in the Abdul Razak government, returning to UMNO&#x27;s Supreme Council in 1973. He returned to the House of Representatives in the 1974 election, winning the Kedah-based seat of Kubang Pasu unopposed. He was appointed to Cabinet in September 1974 as the Minister for Education. During his tenure, Mahathir rolled out a new school curriculum for both primary and secondary schools, designed to provide holistic education and cultivate well-rounded individuals. Around this time, he also ceased his private medical practice.

In 1975, Mahathir ran for one of the three vice-presidencies of UMNO. The contest was regarded as a struggle for the party&#x27;s leadership succession, as the health of Abdul Razak and his deputy, Hussein Onn, waned. Each of Abdul Razak&#x27;s preferred candidates was elected: former Chief Minister of Melaka, Ghafar Baba; Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, a wealthy businessman and member of Kelantan&#x27;s royal family; and Mahathir. When Razak died the following year, Hussein, as his successor, had to choose between the three men, alongside the Minister of Home Affairs Ghazali Shafie, to be deputy prime minister.

Mahathir&#x27;s rivals had significant political liabilities: Ghazali, having been defeated by others for the vice-presidency, lacked the support of UMNO members; Ghafar had no higher education and was not fluent in English; and Razaleigh was young, inexperienced, and unmarried. However, Mahathir and Hussein Onn were not close allies. After six weeks of indecision, on 5 March 1976, Mahathir was, much to his surprise, appointed as deputy prime minister. Several political figures praised his appointment, recognizing his proven ability and experience. The appointment meant that Mahathir was the anointed successor to the prime ministership. In October, Mahathir was appointed to lead a cabinet committee to review the Petroleum Development Act.

Mahathir is regarded as having been a successful Minister for Education and then Minister for Trade and Industry (1978–81). In the latter post, he implemented a &quot;heavy industries policy&quot;, establishing a HICOM, a government-controlled corporation, to invest in the long-term development of manufacturing sectors such as an indigenous car industry. He spent much of his time in the ministry promoting Malaysia through overseas visits.

In September 1978, Mahathir launched the Central Unit of the Federal Industrial Development Authority, a streamlined &quot;one-stop agency&quot; aimed at simplifying the application process for licences, permits, and facilities. Later that month, he led a 31-member trade delegation on a 20-day tour to the United States, aiming to attract American investors by highlighting opportunities in Malaysia, including tax exemptions and other incentives. In June 1979, Mahathir led a 23-member delegation to Pyongyang to sign Malaysia&#x27;s first trade agreement with North Korea, aimed at exploring opportunities to increase imports of North Korean products. During the visit, he also met with North Korea&#x27;s supreme leader, Kim Il Sung.

In 1981, due to declining health, Hussein Onn decided to step down and passed the leadership to Mahathir, who succeeded him unopposed and with his endorsement.

==First term as prime minister (1981–2003)==
=== Early years (1981–1987) ===
Mahathir was sworn in as prime minister on 16 July 1981, at the age of 56. He was the first commoner to hold that office. In an interview, Mahathir remarked that major power rivalry in Southeast Asia is dangerous, but &quot;on the other hand, a lack of U.S. interest is also problematic. It creates the impression that Russia can act as it pleases.&quot; Two days later, he announced a new cabinet with minor changes, including the transfer of Home Minister Ghazali Shafie to Foreign Affairs. Mahathir appointed Musa Hitam as deputy prime minister. Several days later, on 23 July, Mahathir held his first Cabinet meeting, during which he announced that ministers would have one year to demonstrate progress in achieving national objectives and implementing development programs.

One of his first acts was to release 21 detainees held under the Internal Security Act. This included journalist Abdul Samad Ismail and Abdullah Ahmad, who was a former deputy minister in the former government but was suspected of being an underground communist. By August 1982, the Mahathir administration had granted pardons to approximately 250 people. Mahathir prioritized a clean and efficient government, initiating the &quot;Bersih, Cekap &amp; Amanah&quot; (Clean, Efficient, and Trustworthy) campaign to combat corruption, enhance efficiency, and build trust in public service. He also introduced a clock-in system in government departments to ensure punctuality while emphasizing that efficiency should remain the priority. Under calls from opposition leader Lim Kit Siang and others, Musa Hitam, serving concurrently as Home Minister, lifted the ban on Mahathir&#x27;s book &quot;The Malay Dilemma&quot;.

Shortly after taking office, Mahathir, in collaboration with Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, initiated efforts to standardize Malaysia&#x27;s time zones. Mahathir introduced and passed the Malaysian Standard Time Act, which came into effect on 31 December 1981, setting the clocks forward by 30 minutes to GMT+8. This legislation, championed by Mahathir, not only unified the time zones of East and Peninsular Malaysia but also aligned the country with regional economic hubs such as Hong Kong, Manila, and Perth.

Mahathir secured a decisive victory in the 1982 general election, strengthening UMNO&#x27;s leadership with the government&#x27;s best-ever result since independence in 1957. His development-oriented approach during his first nine months in office resonated with the people, reinforcing their support for his vision of a &quot;clean, efficient and trustworthy&quot; government. Afterwards, he reinforced this vision by implementing measures such as requiring ministers to declare their assets, limiting land applications to one piece per leader, discouraging conflicts of interest with public-listed companies, and advising against ostentation and visits to nightclubs. Mahathir further emphasized this vision by launching the &quot;Leadership-by-Example&quot; campaign in 1983 at Stadium Tun Razak, Kuala Lumpur, encouraging leaders and civil servants to uphold integrity, professionalism, and ethical behavior in order to inspire public trust and ensure that national objectives were achieved through exemplary conduct.

In 1983, Mahathir undertook one of the first challenges he had with Malaysia&#x27;s royalty. The position of Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the Malaysian head of state, was due to rotate into either the elderly Idris Shah II of Perak or the controversial Iskandar of Johor, who had only a few years earlier been convicted of manslaughter. Mahathir had grave reservations about the two Sultans, who were both activist rulers of their own states.

Mahathir tried to pre-emptively limit the power that the new Agong could wield over his government. He introduced to parliament amendments to the Constitution to deem the Agong to assent to any bill that had not been assented within 15 days of passage by Parliament. The proposal removed the power to declare a state of emergency from the Agong and placed it with the prime minister. The Agong at the time, Ahmad Shah of Pahang, agreed with the proposals in principle, but baulked when he realised that the proposal would deem Sultans to assent to laws passed by state assemblies. Supported by the Sultans, the Agong refused to assent to the constitutional amendments, which had passed both houses of Parliament with comfortable majorities.

When the public became aware of the impasse, and the Sultans refused to compromise with the government, Mahathir took to the streets to demonstrate public support for his position in mass rallies. The press took the side of the government. A large minority of Malays, including conservative UMNO politicians, and an even larger proportion of the Chinese community supported the Sultans. After five months, the crisis was resolved, as Mahathir and the Sultans agreed to a compromise. The Agong retained the power to declare a state of emergency. However, if he refused to assent to a bill, the bill would return to Parliament, which could then override Agong&#x27;s veto. In 1984, Mahathir was re-elected unopposed as UMNO president for a second term.
On the economic front, Mahathir inherited the New Economic Policy from his predecessors, which was designed to improve the economic position of the bumiputera—Malaysia&#x27;s Malays and Indigenous peoples—via targets and affirmative action in areas such as corporate ownership and university admission. Like many of his economic liberal contemporaries such as British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, Mahathir actively pursued privatisation of government enterprises from the early 1980s. Mahathir believed this would provide economic opportunities for bumiputera and their businesses. His government privatised airlines, utilities and telecommunication firms, accelerating to a rate of about 50 privatisations a year by the mid-1990s.

Privatisation generally improved the working conditions of Malaysians in privatised industries and raised significant revenue for the government. One of the most notable infrastructure projects at the time was the construction of the North–South Expressway, a motorway running from the Thai border to Singapore. Mahathir oversaw the establishment of the car manufacturer Proton as a joint venture between the Malaysian government and Mitsubishi. By the end of the 1980s, with the support of protective tariffs, Proton became a profitable enterprise and the largest carmaker in Southeast Asia.

Under Mahathir&#x27;s leadership, Malaysia implemented strict drug laws, considering drug-related offences a significant national security concern. In 1983, Mahathir launched an Anti-Drug Campaign, enacted the Drug Dependants (Treatment and Rehabilitation) Act, and established Pusat Serenti as a rehabilitation center for drug dependents. The Cabinet also approved the formation of the Anti-Drugs Committee (JKAD) and the Anti-Drugs Task Force (PPAD) under the National Security Council to oversee anti-drug efforts. As the campaign was officially launched on 19 February, this date was later designated as National Anti-Drugs Day in Malaysia.

These efforts led to a decrease in drug-related cases, from 14,624 in 1983 to 7,596 in 1987. The number of foreign nationals apprehended for drug trafficking also declined, attributed to strict law enforcement and preventive measures. Between 1983 and 1992, more than 120 individuals were executed for drug-related crimes, with an average of 15 to 16 executions per year recorded between 1980 and 1996, including at least 39 executions in 1992. In 1986, Australians Kevin Barlow and Brian Chambers became the first Westerners executed under Malaysia’s mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking, despite last-minute clemency appeals from Australia and the United Kingdom. Mahathir defended the decision, emphasizing that Malaysia&#x27;s strict anti-drug laws applied equally to all, regardless of nationality or background.

In Mahathir&#x27;s early years as prime minister, Malaysia experienced a resurgence of Islam and conservatism among Malays. PAS, which had joined UMNO in government in the 1970s, responded to the resurgence by taking an increasingly strident Islamist stand under the leadership of Yusof Rawa. Mahathir tried to appeal to religious voters by establishing Islamic institutions such as the International Islamic University of Malaysia which could promote Islamic education under government oversight.

He managed to draw Anwar Ibrahim, the leader of the Malaysian Islamic Youth Movement (ABIM), into the ranks of UMNO. In some cases, Mahathir&#x27;s government employed repression against more extreme exponents of Islamism. Ibrahim Libya, a popular Islamist leader, was killed in a police shoot-out in 1985. Al-Arqam, a religious sect, was banned, and its leader, Ashaari Mohammad, was arrested under the Internal Security Act. Mahathir comprehensively defeated PAS at the polls in 1986, winning 83 seats of the 84 seats it contested, leaving PAS with just one Member of Parliament (MP). The election saw the BN achieve a landslide victory, securing 148 out of 177 parliamentary seats and control of 11 state assemblies, further consolidating Mahathir&#x27;s leadership.

In 1987, Mahathir established the Langkawi Development Board and declared the island a duty-free zone. This was followed by the construction of key infrastructure, including the Kuah jetty and Langkawi International Airport in 1988, contributing to the island’s transformation into a major tourist destination.

=== Power struggles (1987–1990) ===
In 1987, Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, who had been demoted from Finance Minister to Trade and Industry Minister, challenged Mahathir for UMNO&#x27;s presidency, and effectively the prime ministership. Razaleigh&#x27;s bid was supported by Musa, who had resigned as deputy prime minister the previous year. While once close allies with Mahathir, both fell out with Musa claiming that Mahathir no longer trusted him. Razaleigh and Musa ran for the UMNO presidency and deputy presidency on a joint ticket against Mahathir and his new choice for deputy Abdul Ghafar Baba.

Mahathir&#x27;s Team A enjoyed the press&#x27;s support, most party heavyweights, and even Iskandar, now the Agong. However, other prominent figures such as Abdullah Ahmad Badawi supported Team B. In the election, held on 24 April 1987, Team A prevailed. Mahathir was re-elected by a narrow margin, receiving the votes of 761 party delegates to Razaleigh&#x27;s 718. Ghafar defeated Musa by a slightly larger margin. Mahathir responded by purging seven Team B supporters from his ministry. At the same time, Team B refused to accept defeat and initiated litigation. In an unexpected decision in February 1988, the High Courts ruled that UMNO was an illegal organisation as some of its branches had not been lawfully registered.

Each faction raced to register a new party under the UMNO name. Mahathir&#x27;s side successfully registered the name &quot;UMNO Baru&quot; (&quot;new UMNO&quot;), while Team B&#x27;s application to register &quot;UMNO Malaysia&quot; was rejected. Nevertheless, UMNO Malaysia registered the party as Semangat 46 instead under Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah&#x27;s leadership. The Lord President of the Supreme Court, Salleh Abas, sent a letter of protest to the Agong, which criticised the prime minister for his comments on the judiciary and called for them to be stopped. Mahathir then suspended Salleh for &quot;gross misbehaviour and conduct&quot;, ostensibly because the letter was a breach of protocol. A tribunal set up by Mahathir found Salleh guilty and recommended to the Agong that Salleh be dismissed. Five other judges of the court supported Salleh and were suspended by Mahathir. A newly constituted court dismissed Team B&#x27;s appeal, allowing Mahathir&#x27;s faction to continue to use the name UMNO.

During the political and judicial crises, Mahathir employed the Internal Security Act, stating it was necessary to address unrest and prevent a recurrence of the 1969 race riots. Controversy arose from a decision by then-Education Minister Anwar Ibrahim to appoint administrators who did not speak Mandarin to Chinese schools, prompting protests from Chinese Malaysians and political parties. Tensions escalated following a protest by UMNO’s Youth wing, leading Mahathir to launch Operation Lalang, during which 119 individuals, including opposition figures, were detained, and three newspapers were temporarily suspended.

Mahathir suffered a heart attack in early 1989, which later inspired the establishment of the National Heart Institute (IJN) to improve cardiac care in Malaysia. Mahathir was praised for opting to undergo the surgery in his own country. He recovered to lead Barisan Nasional to victory in the 1990 election. Semangat 46 failed to make any headway outside Razaleigh&#x27;s home state of Kelantan. Following his electoral victory, Mahathir established the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry to better address issues related to trade and consumer protection.

During the same period, Mahathir led the government in negotiations with Chin Peng and the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM). These efforts culminated in a tripartite peace agreement in Hat Yai between Malaysia, Thailand, and the CPM. According to insiders, the Hat Yai peace accords were initiated by Mahathir. The negotiations, overseen by Special Branch chief Abdul Rahim Mohd Noor, were later documented in Colin Abraham&#x27;s &quot;The Finest Hours&quot;, which included a foreword written by Mahathir himself.

=== Economic development to financial crisis (1990–1998) ===

The expiry of the Malaysian New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1990 allowed Mahathir to outline his economic vision for Malaysia. In 1991, he announced Vision 2020, under which Malaysia would aim to become a fully developed country within 30 years. The target would require average economic growth of approximately seven per cent of gross domestic product per annum. One of Vision 2020&#x27;s features would be to gradually break down ethnic barriers. Vision 2020 was accompanied by the NEP&#x27;s replacement, the National Development Policy (NDP), under which some government programs designed to benefit the &quot;bumiputera&quot; exclusively were opened up to other ethnicities. Mahathir highlighted that the policy would balance growth with addressing economic imbalances across regions and society.

The NDP achieved one of its main aims — poverty reduction. By 1995, less than nine per cent of Malaysians lived in poverty, and income inequality had narrowed. Mahathir also introduced the Bangsa Malaysia policy, which aimed to facilitate greater representation of non-Malay ethnicities in Malaysia. Additionally, he popularised slogans like &quot;Malaysia Boleh&quot; (Malaysia Can) in his domestic politics.

Mahathir&#x27;s government cut corporate taxes and liberalised financial regulations to attract foreign investment. The economy grew by over nine per cent per annum until 1998, prompting other developing countries to emulate Mahathir&#x27;s policies. Mahathir&#x27;s bold economic initiatives propelled Malaysia to become the 17th largest trading nation globally. The government rode the economic wave and won the 1995 election with an increased majority.

Mahathir initiated a series of major infrastructure projects in the 1990s. One of the largest was the Multimedia Super Corridor, a new information technology district south of Kuala Lumpur modelled after Silicon Valley. Other significant initiatives included the development of Putrajaya as the home of Malaysia&#x27;s public service. He also played a key role in bringing prominent international sporting events to Malaysia, such as the Formula One Grand Prix at Sepang and the Le Tour de Langkawi cycling competition, further enhancing the country&#x27;s international reputation. Mahathir founded the Space Science Center (ANGKASA), leading to the establishment of the National Planetarium, which was launched in 1994. He also envisioned Malaysia having its own satellite, a vision realized with the launch of MEASAT-1 in 1995 and MEASAT-2 in October 1996.

Another significant development was the Bakun Dam in Sarawak. The ambitious hydro-electric project was intended to carry electricity across the South China Sea to satisfy electricity demand in peninsular Malaysia. Work on the dam was eventually suspended due to the Asian financial crisis. In 1995, Mahathir visited the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and facilitated the establishment of a university modeled after MIT, leading to the founding of the Malaysia University of Science and Technology (MUST). The 1997 Southeast Asian haze, the worst haze event in history caused by Indonesian forest fires, was a major air pollution crisis for the country; Mahathir launched a cross-border firefighting operation in response.
In 1997, the Asian financial crisis threatened to devastate Malaysia&#x27;s economy. The value of the ringgit plummeted due to currency speculation, foreign investment fled, and the main stock exchange index fell by over 75 per cent. At the urging of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the government cut government spending. It raised interest rates, which only served to exacerbate the economic situation. In 1998, Mahathir defied the IMF&#x27;s recommendations and implemented bold measures to stabilize the economy. These included pegging the ringgit at RM3.80 to the US dollar, banning offshore trading of the ringgit to curb speculation, and introducing capital controls. Mahathir also launched domestic policies, such as establishing the National Higher Education Fund Corporation (PTPTN) to provide education loans during the crisis. He argued that relying on a floating exchange rate would exacerbate financial speculation and increase the burden of repaying foreign-denominated loans. Concurrently, Mahathir authorized the repatriation of Malaysian assets from abroad. 

Malaysia recovered from the crisis faster than its Southeast Asian neighbours, aided by an unorthodox capital control policy. The IMF&#x27;s 1999 Article IV consultation report acknowledged that Malaysia&#x27;s capital controls and exchange rate peg, initially met with skepticism, had produced more positive results than expected. The report also recognized that Mahathir&#x27;s policies had helped stabilize the economy, allowing Malaysia to recover faster than many had anticipated. By 1999, the economy had rebounded with a growth of 5.4 per cent, followed by an 8.5 per cent growth in 2000. Mahathir later recalled that his decision to peg the ringgit to the US dollar in 1998 felt like &quot;putting his head on the chopping block&quot;.

In the 1990s, Mahathir found himself at odds with Malaysian royalty over conflicting economic interests. In response to conflicts between Malaysian royals and prospective business leaders, Mahathir&#x27;s government passed a resolution on royal activities. In the 1992 Gomez Incident, Sultan Iskandar&#x27;s son, a representative field hockey player, was suspended from competition for five years for assaulting an opponent. Iskandar retaliated by pulling all Johor hockey teams out of national competitions. When a local coach criticised his decision, Iskandar ordered him to his palace and beat him. The federal parliament unanimously censured Iskandar, and Mahathir took the opportunity to remove the constitutional immunity of the sultans from civil and criminal suits. The press backed Mahathir and, in an unprecedented development, started airing allegations of misconduct by members of Malaysia&#x27;s royal families.

As the press revealed examples of the rulers&#x27; extravagant wealth, Mahathir resolved to cut financial support to royal households. With the press and the government pitted against them, the sultans capitulated to the government&#x27;s proposals. Their powers to deny assent to bills were limited by further constitutional amendments passed in 1994. In 1997, Mahathir officially named the Malaysian flag &#x27;Jalur Gemilang&#x27; during the 40th Independence Day celebration.

=== Final years and succession (1998–2003) ===
According to biographer Ian Stewart, by the mid-1990s Anwar&#x27;s leadership ambition was the most serious threat to Mahathir&#x27;s power. Anwar began to distance himself from Mahathir, overtly promoting his superior religious credentials and suggesting loosening the restrictions on civil liberties. However, Mahathir continued to back Anwar as his successor until the collapse of their relationship during the Asian financial crisis, with Mahathir abandoning the tight monetary and fiscal policies urged by the IMF. Anwar refused to bail out Malaysian International Shipping Corp, in which Mahathir&#x27;s son Mirzan had interests.

At the UMNO General Assembly in 1998, a leading Anwar supporter, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, criticised the government for not doing enough to combat corruption and cronyism. As Mahathir took the reins of Malaysia&#x27;s economic policy over the coming months, Anwar was increasingly sidelined. On 2 September, he was dismissed as deputy prime minister and finance minister and promptly expelled from UMNO. No immediate reasons were given for the dismissal. However, the media speculated that it related to lurid allegations of sexual misconduct circulated in a &quot;poison pen letter&quot; at the general assembly. As more allegations surfaced, large public rallies were held in support of Anwar. On 20 September, he was arrested and placed in detention under the Internal Security Act.

Anwar stood trial on four charges of corruption, arising from allegations that Anwar abused his power by ordering police to intimidate persons who had alleged Anwar had sodomised them. He was found guilty in April 1999 and sentenced to six years in prison. In another trial shortly after, Anwar was sentenced to another nine years in prison on a conviction for sodomy. The sodomy conviction was overturned on appeal after Mahathir left office.

Anwar&#x27;s conviction drew criticism from the international community. US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright defended Anwar as a &quot;highly respectable leader&quot; who was &quot;entitled to due process and a fair trial&quot; and met with Anwar&#x27;s wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail. At the APEC summit in 1999, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien refused to meet Mahathir, while his foreign minister also met with Wan Azizah. Wan Azizah had formed a liberal opposition party, the National Justice Party (&quot;Keadilan&quot;) to contest in the 1999 election. UMNO lost 18 seats and two state governments as large numbers of Malays voted for PAS or Keadilan in protest of Anwar&#x27;s treatment.

In September 2001, debate began after Mahathir announced that Malaysia was already an Islamic state. Around the same time, Mahathir established the Women&#x27;s Affairs Ministry and proposed an amendment to Article 8(2) of the Federal Constitution to include &quot;sex&quot; as a prohibited ground for discrimination, ensuring women’s equal rights. He also launched Puteri Umno, urging party members to support and nurture the new women&#x27;s wing.

In May 2002, Mahathir officially opened the PETRONAS Petroleum Industry Complex (PPIC) in Kerteh, a world-class integrated petroleum hub developed by PETRONAS that attracted significant foreign investment. During the same time, he also approved Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) President Ling Liong Sik’s proposal to establish Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR). During his tenure, Mahathir proposed sending a Malaysian into space, and on August 7, 2003, he officially announced the astronaut programme. This initiative came to fruition in 2007, when Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor became the first Malaysian astronaut to travel to the International Space Station aboard a Soyuz spacecraft under an arrangement with Russia. Sheikh Muszaphar later regarded Mahathir as the &#x27;father of Malaysia&#x27;s space programme.&#x27; 

At UMNO&#x27;s general assembly in 2002, he announced that he would resign as prime minister, only for supporters to rush to the stage and convince him tearfully to remain. He subsequently fixed his retirement for October 2003, giving him time to ensure an orderly and uncontroversial transition to his anointed successor, Abdullah Badawi. During his final year in office, Mahathir introduced the teaching of Mathematics and Science in English (PPSMI) in 2003, believing that it is crucial for Malaysians to remain competitive in a fast-changing world. On 29 October 2003, the cabinet paid tribute to Mahathir for his invaluable service to the nation as Prime Minister for the last 22 years. He also received a record-breaking outpouring of public gratitude, marked by a 5.5 km-long banner displaying messages from over 50,000 Malaysians. The following day, Mahathir presented a review of Malaysia&#x27;s five-year economic plan at Parliament House. Having spent over 22 years in office, Mahathir was the world&#x27;s longest-serving elected leader when he retired on 31 October 2003.

For his contributions to the development and progress of Malaysia, Mahathir was honored by his successor, Abdullah Badawi, with the title &quot;Bapa Pemodenan Malaysia&quot; (Father of Malaysia&#x27;s Modernisation) after stepping down from office. The following year, Barisan Nasional leaders and members paid tribute to Mahathir during a dinner in Kuala Lumpur, acknowledging his remarkable contributions to the coalition and the nation.

===Foreign relations=== 
During Mahathir&#x27;s term, Mahathir maintained a collaborative relationship with the West, despite him being an outspoken critic and prioritised development models and collaboration from elsewhere in Asia. He chose neighboring Indonesia for his first official overseas visit. Early during his tenure, a small disagreement with the United Kingdom over university tuition fees led to a boycott of all British goods led by Mahathir, in what became known as the &quot;Buy British Last&quot; campaign. Mahathir successfully negotiated with Indonesian President Suharto to bring the 27-year Ligitan and Sipadan dispute with Indonesia to the International Court of Justice for resolution.

In a shift from his predecessors, Mahathir frequently condemned Israel and ensured Malaysian support for the Palestine Liberation Organization, although toned down his criticisms after the Oslo Accords were agreed. He has been internationally acclaimed as the voice of the developing world. As Prime Minister, Mahathir undertook numerous international visits to enhance diplomatic relations, promote trade, and gather insights on foreign nations. In 1987, he was elected as the President of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking.

Mahathir was prominent at the 1992 Earth Summit, arguing against an international forest conservation treaty over what he saw as the undue impact on the development of poorer Global South countries. He had previously threatened to pull Malaysia out of the summit if environmentalists intended to criticise logging in the country. In 2003, Mahathir spoke to the Non-Aligned Movement in Kuala Lumpur, where he blamed Western nations and Israel for a global rise in terrorism. During his final 100 days in office, Mahathir remained focused on offering potent advice to Third World countries on nurturing healthy economies, among other issues.
====Sovereignty====
During his tenure as prime minister, Mahathir asserted Malaysia’s sovereignty over several features in the Spratly Islands, claiming Swallow Reef in 1983, Ardasier Reef and Mariveles Reef in 1986, and Investigator Shoal and Erica Reef in 1999. His administration cited Malaysia’s continental shelf limits and the 1982 UNCLOS as the basis for these claims, while also responding to Vietnam’s territorial activities in the region. To strengthen Malaysia’s position, Mahathir oversaw the transformation of Swallow Reef into an artificial island with military fortifications, establishing it as a permanent naval outpost. Despite this militarisation, he maintained diplomatic engagement with Beijing, balancing relations with ASEAN claimants and employing a hedging strategy involving China and the United States. 

Mahathir&#x27;s foreign policy towards China on the Spratlys was notably pragmatic. While Malaysia pursued its territorial claims, he emphasised dialogue over confrontation. In 1993, he stated that Malaysia had &quot;no problem with China&quot; regarding the Spratlys, and in 1994, he welcomed China’s proposal for joint exploration, opposing further internationalisation of the dispute.

==== Japan ====
In the early 1960s, Mahathir visited Japan and witnessed its remarkable recovery from the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, symbolized by the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Mahathir announced a &quot;Look East&quot; policy in December 1981. Under &quot;Look East&quot;, Mahathir particularly prioritised relations with Japan, hoping this would bolster Malaysia&#x27;s economy and that Japanese work ethic, values and moral norms would have a positive influence on Malaysians. He made over 100 visits to Japan. Consistent with the &quot;Look East&quot; strategy adopted under his leadership, there was a major push for heavy industries by Malaysia in the early 1980s.
====China and Taiwan====

Mahathir also strengthened political and economic cooperation with China, whilst maintaining diplomatic ambivalence on security issues to avoid escalating territorial disputes in the South China Sea. He openly criticised China&#x27;s involvement in Malaysia&#x27;s communist insurgency, but downplayed any military threat from China after the Cold War ended. In 1985, Mahathir visited China for the first time as Prime Minister, where he met Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, establishing a new level of trust that laid the foundation for Malaysia-China relations and set the stage for decades of economic and diplomatic growth. Later, he visited China again in 1993, 1994, 1996, 1999, and twice in 2001.

In the early 1990s, Mahathir played a key role in engaging China with ASEAN despite South China Sea disputes, particularly in the post-Tiananmen and post-Cold War contexts, paving the way for then Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to attend the ASEAN meeting’s opening ceremony in July 1991 as a guest of the Malaysian government, and eventually leading to China’s upgrade to ASEAN’s dialogue partner in 1996. Amidst the Asian financial crisis, Mahathir also led several large delegations to China and Russia to seek regional economic cooperation.

Besides that, Mahathir also had significant interactions with Taiwan, especially during the 1980s and 1990s, when economic ties between the two sides were at their strongest despite the lack of formal diplomatic relations. During this period, Taiwan was a major investor in Malaysia, ranking among its top five sources of foreign investment, even reaching the top spot in 1990 and 1994. Mahathir himself visited Taiwan in 1984, 1988, and 1997, with two of these visits involving transit diplomacy at Taoyuan Airport. In 1988, he led a delegation of three cabinet ministers on a discreet visit to Taiwan, which drew criticism from Beijing. However, Mahathir defended the trip by emphasizing that Malaysia’s engagement with Taiwan was based solely on economic considerations rather than political recognition. His government also facilitated closer ties by allowing Taiwan’s trade office in Malaysia to be upgraded and by engaging in high-level exchanges, such as meetings with Taiwanese leaders like Premier Lien Chan in 1993.

====United States====

The United States was the biggest foreign investment source and one of Malaysia&#x27;s closest allies during Mahathir&#x27;s rule. A 2003 house hearing by the Subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific of the U.S. House International Relations Committee (now called the House Committee on Foreign Affairs) summarises the relationship between the United States and Malaysia as follows: &quot;Despite sometimes blunt and intemperate public remarks by Prime Minister Mahathir, U.S.-Malaysian cooperation has a solid record in areas as diverse as education, trade, military relations, and counter-terrorism.&quot; Mahathir was publicly critical of the foreign policy of the United States, particularly during George W. Bush&#x27;s presidency. He has also condemned the US-led war on Iraq and Afghanistan.

In 1984, during his first visit to the United States, Mahathir received a warm welcome. He met President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office, followed by discussions, lunch, and a press conference. He also made a private visit to Tulsa, Oklahoma. In the years that followed, Mahathir held informal meetings with US presidents George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush at various locations to discuss issues related to palm oil and the United States&#x27; attitude towards Muslim countries. In January 1997, Mahathir visited the United States to promote Malaysia&#x27;s Multimedia Super Corridor. In May 1986, Nancy Reagan became the first First Lady of the United States to visit Malaysia.

In 1998, US vice-president Al Gore gave a speech expressing sympathy for the Reformasi movement at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference hosted by Malaysia, infuriating Mahathir and other ministers. Analysts interpreted Gore&#x27;s comments as criticism of Anwar&#x27;s imprisonment. Anwar, who was the preeminent Malaysian spokesperson for the economic policies and reforms preferred by the IMF, later faced criticism after becoming Prime Minister in 2022 for implementing many conservative and regressive policies.

====United Kingdom====
In September 1981, shortly after Mahathir assumed office as Prime Minister, the country carried out the &quot;Dawn Raid&quot;, a calculated operation orchestrated by Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB) to regain majority ownership of Guthrie, one of the largest British-owned plantation companies at the time. This move symbolized a broader effort under Mahathir&#x27;s leadership to reduce foreign dominance over Malaysia&#x27;s economy and reclaim control of national assets.

A month after the Dawn Raid, Mahathir introduced the &quot;Buy British Last&quot; (BBL) policy, which lasted from October 1981 to March 1983. The reason for this policy was rooted in several grievances with Britain. Britain’s decision to abolish tuition fee subsidies for Commonwealth students placed a heavy financial burden on Malaysia, which had to cover the increased costs for approximately 17,000 Malaysian students studying in the UK. Additionally, British media criticism of Malaysia’s internal policies further strained relations. The BBL policy, which directed government ministries and agencies to deprioritize British goods and services, significantly affected Britain, causing estimated losses of between £15.5 million and £50 million in the early months. This eventually led to negotiations, culminating in Mahathir and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher meeting in 1983 to resolve the tensions and end the policy. Mahathir later recalled persuading Thatcher that raising tuition fees was a mistake, leading Thatcher to introduce scholarships for Malaysian students.

Mahathir reclaimed Carcosa Hill, which had been given to the British by Tunku Abdul Rahman after independence as a sign of good faith, and was home to the British High Commissioner&#x27;s residence.

Mahathir developed a close friendship with Thatcher, leading to strengthened bilateral relations between the two countries during their tenure. Thatcher once praised Mahathir as a truly remarkable national leader and described Malaysia as a textbook example of how to build a prosperous nation. After Thatcher&#x27;s 1985 visit to Malaysia, bilateral ties improved significantly. Key progress included enhanced trade, particularly in palm oil exports and British technology imports, as well as increased educational cooperation through scholarships for Malaysian students in the UK. Malaysia-UK relations were back on track, leading to Malaysia being chosen to host two major world events — the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Langkawi in 1989 and the Commonwealth Games in 1998. Mahathir spoke of his good working relationship with Thatcher, saying, &quot;Malaysians should remember that she visited Kuala Lumpur three times — no other British PM has done this before or since.&quot; During John Major&#x27;s visit to Malaysia in September 1993, five memorandums of understanding, involving several billion ringgit, were signed between Malaysian and British companies.

====Australia====

Mahathir&#x27;s relationship with Australia and its political leaders was particularly rocky. Although Malaysia-Australia relations were collaborative, Mahathir was publicly critical of the country&#x27;s colonial history and close relations with the United States. Relations reached a low point in 1993 when Australian prime minister Paul Keating described Mahathir as &quot;recalcitrant&quot; for not attending the APEC summit. The Malaysian government threatened trade sanctions as a response, while the Australian government claimed that Keating&#x27;s description was a linguistic gaffe, and that what he had in mind was &quot;intransigent&quot;.

In November 2002, Mahathir opposed Australia’s bid for a seat at the ASEAN summit, emphasizing the need for a thorough study before expanding membership to non-Asian nations. His firm stance, along with Indonesia’s reservations, led ASEAN leaders to defer the decision. This marked the third time he had vetoed Australia’s efforts to expand its role in the region, having previously played a key role in excluding Australia from the ASEAN Free Trade Area and the regular ASEAN-EU talks.

====Singapore====

Not long after assuming office, Mahathir visited Singapore in December 1981 as part of a delegation to meet with Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. Among various bilateral discussions, the two leaders agreed to implement a coordinated time adjustment. This led to the passing of the Malaysian Standard Time Act (1981), initiated by Mahathir. Later, Lee paid a return visit to Malaysia in August 1982. In the early days of his tenure, Mahathir improved relations with Singapore, not only strengthening bilateral ties but also gaining the support of the Malaysian Chinese community.

During his time, Singapore&#x27;s requests to Malaysia to move its railway immigration checkpoint away from Tanjong Pagar and disputes over water payments were major disagreements between the two countries. The Points of Agreement of 1990 set out the terms for developing land for a Rapid Transit System, although disputes still continued throughout the following decade. Mahathir and Singaporean counterparts also oversaw a dispute over the ownership of Pedra Branca, several islets between the two countries, with an agreed exchange of documents to settle ownership of the islets in 1981 being delayed until at least 1992. The 1997 Asian financial crisis further escalated tensions, with Singapore offering high interest rates for ringgit deposits leading to cash flow issues in Malaysia. However, Lee remarked that he had made more progress resolving bilateral issues with Mahathir between 1981 and 1990 than during the previous 12 years under Mahathir&#x27;s two predecessors.

On Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s death in March 2015, Mahathir wrote an entry on his blog, expressing grief at the news. Although he often disagreed with Lee, Mahathir wrote that he bore him no enmity for the differences of opinion on the direction of Singapore&#x27;s development, and that ASEAN had lost the strong leadership of both Lee and Suharto of Indonesia, who had died in 2008. Some analysts observed that with Lee&#x27;s death, Mahathir was the last of the &quot;Old Guard&quot; of Southeast Asia. On the anniversary of Lee&#x27;s death, Mahathir told the media that Singaporeans must recognise Lee&#x27;s contributions towards industrialising Singapore. He said that he does not view Lee &quot;as an enemy and all that, but as a Singapore leader who had his own stand that was not the same with the stand of Malaysia&quot;.

====Myanmar====

In 1997, Mahathir strongly supported Myanmar&#x27;s inclusion into ASEAN, stating that &quot;we are going to work very hard to get Burma into ASEAN&quot; despite international criticism and American sanctions against the military regime. Mahathir presided as ASEAN chair over Myanmar’s admission, playing a key role in ensuring its membership.

However, by 2003, Mahathir&#x27;s stance toward Myanmar had shifted significantly, particularly following the prolonged detention of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. In an interview, he openly stated that if Myanmar&#x27;s military government continued to refuse Suu Kyi&#x27;s release, ASEAN might have to consider expelling the country. This marked the first time an ASEAN leader had raised the possibility of Myanmar&#x27;s expulsion, drawing considerable international attention.

====South Africa====
Mahathir and Nelson Mandela shared a close relationship, forged during South Africa&#x27;s struggle against apartheid. Malaysia played a crucial role in supporting South Africa&#x27;s transition to democracy, particularly in its preparations for the historic 1994 election that saw Mandela elected as the country&#x27;s first black president. Mahathir was the first international leader to visit Mandela following his release in 1990. During a meeting held at a Zambian government guest house, Mahathir presented Mandela with a silver keris, a symbol of Malaysia’s constitutional monarchy system of government.

Mandela visited Malaysia twice during Mahathir&#x27;s tenure as prime minister, first in 1993 and again in 1997. During his second visit, Mahathir hosted a private dinner for the South African president in Langkawi. The close relationship between the two leaders also benefited Malaysian businesses, granting them a &quot;most favoured&quot; status for securing contracts and business opportunities in South Africa. During Mandela&#x27;s visit, Mahathir further strengthened this partnership with him by jointly launching the Malaysia-South Africa Business Council (MSABC) in Kuala Lumpur. The strong bilateral relations also led to significant progress in political and economic cooperation, with key agreements signed in trade, air services, and shipping. Additionally, Malaysia supported South Africa&#x27;s development through scholarships for South African students and collaboration in science and technology.

Mahathir visited South Africa three times during his tenure as Prime Minister: a private visit in April 1994 to congratulate Mandela, an official visit in August 1995, and another in May 1997 when he received the Order of the Cape of Good Hope.

On 27 August 2013, the Mahathir Global Peace Foundation honored Mandela with the Mahathir Award for Global Peace. In the same year as Mandela’s passing, Mahathir expressed his deep sorrow, calling Mandela a great leader who dedicated his life to social justice. He admired Mandela&#x27;s magnanimity, noting that despite years of imprisonment, he focused on reconciliation and sharing opportunities between blacks and whites. Mahathir also paid his last respects to Mandela in Pretoria, where he attended as a personal representative of Malaysia.

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
Mahathir was a prominent international advocate for Bosniaks in Bosnia and Herzegovina during his tenure. His government permitted Bosnians to come to Malaysia without a visa during the Bosnian War. He was influential in the establishment of an OIC summit in Karachi in 1993 to discuss the need for weapons for Bosnia during the War. Malaysia sent UN Peacekeeping forces to Bosnia and was part of the Contact Group advocating for Bosnia at the UN.

In February 2007, Mahathir was nominated by four non-governmental organisations in Bosnia and Herzegovina for the Noble Peace Prize Award 2007. The nominations were made by the Serb Civic Council from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Croat National Council, the Sarajevo School of Science and Technology, and the Congress of Bosnik Intellectuals.

====Pan-Asia rail link plan====

Mahathir revived the plan for a “pan-Asian” railway network in 1995, an idea with roots in the early 1900s and later resurfaced in a 1960 UN proposal for a trans-Asian railway spanning 118,000 kilometers. In the post-Cold War era, as regional development cooperation gained momentum in East Asia, Mahathir proposed the construction of the Trans-Asian Railway linking Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and other countries in the central and southern peninsula to China. This was an early example of ASEAN&#x27;s approach to regional connectivity through infrastructure cooperation. His push led ASEAN to focus on three main routes from Kunming to Bangkok, with extensions south to Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. 

In 1996, during a visit to Kazakhstan, Mahathir emphasized the railway’s role in connecting Southeast Asia with China and, eventually, Central Asia, granting landlocked nations access to the sea. His comments also foreshadowed China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), highlighting Kazakhstan’s strategic position between China, Russia, and Europe.
====Antarctica====
In 1982, Mahathir discussed the governance of Antarctica at the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). He emphasized that Antarctica should be regarded as the common heritage of mankind, opposing any unilateral claims of sovereignty and advocating for international cooperation in its management and resource utilization. At the time, there were concerns that minerals could be exploited in Antarctica, and the media regarded Mahathir’s stance as the only political challenge ever mounted to the Antarctic Treaty in decades. In 1984, Mahathir stated that while the Antarctic Treaty system had contributed positively, there was a need to establish a broader foundation for international cooperation in Antarctica, and he proposed the formation of a &quot;special committee on Antarctica&quot; to conduct an in-depth study and build consensus on a new administrative framework for the continent and the mechanisms required to achieve it. Later, in October 1999, Malaysia sent four scientists to Antarctica to conduct research, focusing on air pollution as part of Universiti Malaya&#x27;s air pollution research unit. Then, in November 2001, Malaysia launched a second mission, sending two scientists from Universiti Malaya to conduct research on marine and biological sciences.

In February 2002, Mahathir led a Malaysian delegation, including his wife and several cabinet members, on a visit to Antarctica. They traveled from Ushuaia, Argentina, aboard the Russian icebreaker Kapitan Dranitsyn. Mahathir described the trip as a &quot;once in a lifetime&quot; experience and expressed his amazement at the continent’s cold yet beautiful landscape.

===Defence===
Under Mahathir&#x27;s leadership, Malaysia undertook significant military modernization efforts. As Minister of Defence from 1981 to 1986, he played a key role in shaping the country&#x27;s defense strategy. His administration oversaw the procurement of advanced military assets, including 18 Russian-made MiG-29N fighter jets and eight American-made F/A-18D Hornets, diversifying Malaysia’s defense partnerships beyond traditional suppliers. Malaysia also explored the purchase of submarines, with plans to acquire British Oberon-class submarines in 1988, although the deal was later canceled. Additionally, Mahathir strengthened Malaysia’s defense ties with various countries, including Poland, Brazil, India, and Pakistan, expanding the range of military equipment procurement. 

A major structural reform during Mahathir’s leadership was the establishment of the 10th Parachute Brigade (10 Briged Para) in 1994 as a Rapid Deployment Force (Pasukan Aturgerak Cepat). Internationally, Malaysia became a key contributor to United Nations peacekeeping missions, deploying around 18,000 military and police personnel between 1998 and 2003. The country’s active participation peaked between 1992 and 1996, with about 2,500 peacekeepers sent to Cambodia, Bosnia, and Somalia. In recognition of Malaysia’s commitment, the Malaysian Peacekeeping Training Centre (MPC) was established in Port Dickson in 1996, following an agreement with the UN to provide personnel for peacekeeping missions at any time.

===Indian Community Policies===

During Mahathir&#x27;s tenure, several initiatives were introduced that impacted the Indian Malaysian community. He allocated RM50 million for the establishment of AIMST University, along with 228 acres of government land at a low price, which was further supported by an additional RM250 million from the federal government. The university aimed to provide tertiary education for Malaysian Indian students. Mahathir also funded the technical TAFE College in Seremban and offered land at a low price. Additionally, the Public Works Department built 60 Tamil schools. His quota system for public university intake enabled many underprivileged Indian students with lower qualifications to pursue tertiary education.

==Retirement and post–first term premiership (2003–2015)==

On his retirement, Mahathir was named a Grand Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm, the highest honor in Malaysia, allowing him to adopt the title of &quot;Tun&quot;. Under Mahathir&#x27;s leadership, Malaysia was transformed into an industrialising nation. He pledged to leave politics &quot;completely&quot;, rejecting an emeritus role in Abdullah&#x27;s cabinet. Abdullah immediately made his mark as a quieter and less adversarial premier. With stronger religious credentials than Mahathir, he beat back PAS&#x27;s surge in the 1999 election and lead the Barisan Nasional in the 2004 election to its biggest win ever, taking 199 of 219 parliamentary seats. On 23 October, &quot;Mingguan Malaysia&quot; published an exclusive interview with Mahathir, marking his first since retiring as Prime Minister.

After retiring, Mahathir maintained a busy schedule, engaging in various activities and speaking engagements both locally and internationally. He emphasized the importance of staying active, stating, &quot;Never retire. You have to work. When you work, it will keep you alive.&quot;

Mahathir was the CEO and Chairman, and hence a senior adviser, for many flagship Malaysian companies such as Proton, Perdana Leadership Foundation and Malaysia&#x27;s government-owned oil and gas company Petronas. He did not receive any remuneration for his advisory positions. He was also made Universiti Teknologi Petronas (UTP) Chancellor in 2004, succeeding the late Raja Mohar Raja Badiozaman. On June 15 of the same year, Mahathir was appointed chairman of the NAM Business Council International Advisory Panel. In 2006, Mahathir co-founded The Loaf bakery with Motoko Resources Sdn Bhd, opening its first store in Telaga Harbor, Langkawi, before expanding to 12 outlets in locations such as KLCC, Pavilion, Sogo, and Empire Shopping Gallery. He also served as The Loaf’s chairman.

Despite his business ventures, Mahathir remained an influential figure, and his views on national matters continued to draw attention. Mahathir and Abdullah had a major fallout over Proton in 2005. While Abdullah was attempting to reform the company and implemented high import tariffs on foreign cars, Mahathir accused Abdullah&#x27;s government of cronyism in relation to import licences. Proton&#x27;s chief executive, a Mahathir ally, had been sacked by the company&#x27;s board. With Abdullah&#x27;s blessing, Proton then sold one of its prise assets, the motorcycle company MV Agusta, which was bought on Mahathir&#x27;s advice.

Mahathir criticised the awarding of import permits for foreign cars, which he claimed were causing Proton&#x27;s domestic sales to suffer, and attacked Abdullah for cancelling the construction of a second causeway between Malaysia and Singapore.

Mahathir complained that his views were not getting sufficient airing by the Malaysian press. In response, be began writing a column for &quot;Malaysiakini&quot; and starting his own blog. He unsuccessfully sought election from his local party division to be a delegate to UMNO&#x27;s general assembly in 2006, where he planned to initiate a challenge to Abdullah&#x27;s leadership. Mahathir had previously missed the Umno General Assembly twice since 2006 due to health reasons. After the 2008 election, in which UMNO lost its two-thirds majority in parliament, Mahathir resigned from the party. When Abdullah was replaced by his deputy Najib Razak in 2009, Mahathir re-joined the party.

Mahathir established the Kuala Lumpur Initiative to Criminalise War Forum in an effort to end war globally, as well as the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission to investigate the activities of the United States, Israel and its allies in Iraq, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. In March 2015, Mahathir attended a conference where he stated his belief in a &quot;New World Order&quot;, where an elite would attempt rule the planet in a single world government, and exterminate billions of humans.

==Return to politics (2015–2018)==

By 2015, even at 90 years old, Mahathir remained sharp and combative. He repeatedly called for prime minister Najib Razak to resign over the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) corruption scandal. On 30 August 2015, he and Siti Hasmah attended the Bersih 4 rally, a mass protest organised in response to the scandal. In 2016, Mahathir chaired the Malaysian Citizens&#x27; Declaration, which brought together several political figures and non-governmental organisations in calling for Najib&#x27;s resignation. In this declaration, Mahathir listed 37 points. Later, the Citizens&#x27; Declaration reached one million signatures in May of the same year.

Mahathir left UMNO in 2016, and formed Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (BERSATU). The new party was officially registered on 9 September 2016, and Mahathir became its chairman. By 2017, he had officially joined the opposition coalition Pakatan Harapan. Negotiations then took place between different factions of the coalition for Mahathir to become the chairman and prime ministerial candidate. He assumed the position of chairman on 14 July 2017, despite reservations from supporters of Anwar Ibrahim, who could not contest in polls himself while imprisoned.

In 2017, Mahathir referred to Najib as &quot;a prime minister who came from &#x27;Bugis pirates&#x27;&quot; and remarked, &quot;go back to Sulawesi&quot;. Bugis people in Malaysia and Indonesia criticised his language and protested against him.

In early 2018, Mahathir was announced as Pakatan Harapan&#x27;s prime ministerial candidate for the upcoming general election. Wan Azizah, wife of his former political enemy Anwar, ran as his deputy. Mahathir&#x27;s election promise was to seek a pardon for Anwar, in order to allow him to take over as prime minister after an interim period.

==Second term as prime minister (2018–2020)==


Pakatan Harapan defeated Barisan Nasional in the 2018 general election. Concerns for a smooth power transition emerged as Najib declared that no party had achieved a majority. The National Palace of Malaysia subsequently confirmed Mahathir would be sworn in as Malaysia&#x27;s seventh prime minister, refuting any claims of delaying the appointment. Immediately after the declaration of the results, people in Kuala Lumpur expressed their joy in celebration of the historic victory. Mahathir announced a two-day public holiday, adding: &#x27;But there will be no holidays for the winners.&#x27;

He became the world&#x27;s oldest serving state leader (aged at the time), and the first Malaysian prime minister not to represent UMNO. His deputy, Wan Azizah became the first female deputy prime minister of Malaysia.

In April 2019, Mahathir was listed among &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 most influential people.

===Domestic affairs===

Mahathir promised to &quot;restore the rule of law&quot;, and reopen investigations into the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, telling the press that Najib would face consequences if found guilty of corruption. Mahathir instructed the Department of Immigration to bar Najib and his wife, the notoriously extravagant Rosmah Mansor, from leaving the country after they attempted to fly to Indonesia.

Mahathir formed his cabinet of 29 ministers in June 2018. He abolished the unpopular Goods and Services Tax, reducing it from six to zero per cent. Mahathir implemented a “no gifts policy,” stating that he would only accept food, flowers, and fruits, while prohibiting government officials from receiving any other gifts to prevent corruption.

He also vowed to cut fiscal spending by firing thousands of civil servants, cancelling an expensive Kuala Lumpur–Singapore high-speed rail link and cutting back on large infrastructure projects initiated under Najib. Malaysia&#x27;s freedom of the press improved slightly under Mahathir&#x27;s tenure, and the country&#x27;s rank rose in the Press Freedom Index. The government announced palm oil cultivation would be limited to 6.55 million hectares by 2023, and began a lobbying campaign to improve palm oil&#x27;s reputation abroad.

On 20 June 2018, Mahathir met the father of murdered Mongolian woman Altantuya Shaariibuu and agreed that the case of her murder should be reopened.

A year into his term, Mahathir&#x27;s approval ratings had fallen as the economy slowed and several planned reforms, such as abolishing capital punishment and the Sedition Act 1948, were not realised amid divisions in the coalition. Mahathir announced the Shared Prosperity Vision 2030 in October 2019, which set out for Malaysia to become a high income country by 2030. Another priority of his administration was a more transparent approach to defence. The government prepared the country&#x27;s first defence policy white paper outlining long-term plans for the country.

===Foreign relations===
 

Early in his second tenure, Mahathir visited Japan and Indonesia to reaffirm good relations, and reignited a water dispute with Singapore. By the end of 2018, several disputes over maritime and airspace borders with Singapore had continued. Mahathir met twice with president Rodrigo Duterte in his first year in office to strengthen cooperation with the Philippines on a broad range of security, economic and political issues. Mahathir again prioritised relations with Japan and strengthened economic and defence ties with Russia. He visited Vladivostok for a meeting of the Eastern Economic Forum in late 2019, where he cast doubt on the Joint Investigation Team&#x27;s findings related to the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Mahathir called the murder charges brought to four Russians related to the flight &quot;ridiculous&quot;, calling it &quot;a political issue on how to accuse Russia of wrongdoing&quot;. Malaysia launched a foreign policy framework in late 2019. In response to European Union regulations phasing out palm-oil based biofuels, Mahathir discussed bringing a formal complaint to the World Trade Organization or a case to the European Court of Justice with Indonesian president Joko Widodo.

Mahathir condemned the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 and the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani by the United States in 2020.

Mahathir was supportive of the 2018–19 Korean peace process. He also indicated that Malaysia would re-open its embassy in North Korea, which had remained closed since the 2017 assassination of Kim Jong-nam.

====China====

Mahathir&#x27;s administration committed to retaining good relations with China, but promised to review all Belt and Road Initiative projects in Malaysia that were initiated by the previous government. He characterised these as &quot;unequal treaties&quot;. His government suspended work on the East Coast Rail Link, which recommenced after terms had been renegotiated. Mahathir cancelled approximately $2.8 billion worth of deals with China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau altogether, citing high repayment costs.

On 13 February 2020, Mahathir spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping to express solidarity and discuss cooperation in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Prior to this, Mahathir had expressed his hopes that 2020, the &#x27;Year of Culture and Tourism&#x27; between Malaysia and China, would further strengthen the ties and friendship between the two nations.

=== 2020 political crisis and resignation ===
By late 2019, disagreements emerged within Pakatan Harapan about Mahathir&#x27;s planned handover of power to Anwar Ibrahim, eventually culminating in a political crisis in 2020. Mahathir and a faction of the coalition felt that Anwar would be unable to command a parliamentary majority. MPs supporting Anwar demanded a timeframe for Mahathir&#x27;s resignation and handover of power.

In February 2020, MPs opposed to Anwar taking over met and agreed to form a new government. Anwar told the media that he had been &quot;betrayed&quot;. Anwar and Mahathir met to clarify the situation, where Mahathir insisted he had no involvement in a new government.

Mahathir, refusing to work with UMNO leaders, submitted his resignation to the Agong, Abdullah of Pahang, on 24 February 2020. The Agong appointed him interim prime minister until a replacement could be agreed. BERSATU President Muhyiddin Yassin declared the party&#x27;s withdrawal from Pakatan Harapan; Mahathir also resigned from the party in response.

On 29 February, the Agong appointed Muhyiddin prime minister, determining that he was most likely to be able to hold the support of a majority in parliament. Mahathir unsuccessfully attempted to challenge this with the Agong, but eventually left the prime minister&#x27;s office an hour before Muhyiddin was sworn in.

== Post–second term premiership (2020–present) ==
Despite his advanced age and having stepped down as prime minister, Mahathir remains active on the international stage, frequently traveling, delivering speeches, and continuing to voice his views and influence both domestically and globally. He formed the Homeland Fighter&#x27;s Party (PEJUANG) in August 2020. Four other MPs joined the new party, including Mahathir&#x27;s son Mukhriz. The party was registered in July 2021. In August 2021, Mahathir and other MPs protested in Merdeka Square, calling for Muhyiddin&#x27;s resignation over the government&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, after being blocked from entering parliament by police.

In April 2022, UMNO president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi filed a defamation lawsuit against Mahathir. In June 2022, Mahathir made irrendentist comments by stating that Singapore and the Riau Islands of Indonesia was once owned by Johor, and argued the state should claim them as part of Malaysia.

In September 2022, Mahathir said he was open to becoming the prime minister for a third time if there were no other suitable candidates. Having previously said he would not defend his Langkawi parliamentary seat, he announced he would contest the 2022 general election. In the election on 19 November, Mahathir lost his seat and election deposit, marking his first defeat in 53 years. No candidate from PEJUANG or Gerakan Tanah Air secured a seat. He later said that his party&#x27;s plans &quot;had to be dropped&quot; and he would shift his focus to writing about Malaysian history.

In February 2023, Mahathir and 13 other members of PEJUANG (leaving his own son as the sole leader of that party) left the party and joined Parti Bumiputera Perkasa Malaysia (Putra). Later in 2023, Mahathir began promoting a &quot;Malay Proclamation&quot;, aimed at uniting Malays. He met with PAS and PN leaders to garner support for the 12-point document listing political, economic and social issues. Mahathir was questioned by police over this campaign under the Malaysian Penal Code, for carrying out &quot;activities that undermine parliamentary democracy&quot;. Mahathir also left GTA, criticising the coalition for its poor performance in the election. He supported Perikatan Nasional, the coalition that had ousted him in 2020, in six state elections and was named its &quot;unofficial adviser&quot; for the four state governments under its control.

On 31 August 2024, Mahathir attended the Merdeka Day celebration in Putrajaya in his personal capacity, as he was not officially invited by the government. His presence at the event, where he was warmly received by the crowd, sparked public debate. Prominent academic Chandra Muzaffar criticized the government&#x27;s decision, describing it as a breach of Malaysian etiquette and values, particularly given Mahathir’s status as the country’s longest-serving prime minister. He stated that the exclusion contradicted the principles of the Rukun Negara, which emphasize courtesy and morality, and called for a clear explanation from the government.

==Political positions and views==


Mahathir&#x27;s political views have shifted during his lengthy career. During the 1980s and 1990s, he was a supporter of third-worldism, while during other periods he has been a proponent of &quot;Asian values&quot; and globalisation. A Muslim thinker, he holds Islamic political views. In 2002, he characterised himself as an Islamic fundamentalist. Mahathir is generally respected in developing and Islamic countries, particularly due to his oversight of Malaysia&#x27;s economic growth and his support of liberal Muslim values.

Mahathir has been described as a proponent of Malay nationalism. In &quot;The Malay Dilemma&quot;, he argued that the Malay race had been marginalised, and voiced his support for affirmative action policies for them. Upon his first resignation, he expressed his disappointment at the progress made towards his &quot;principle task&quot; of supporting the Malay race. In 2021, Mahathir said he did not believe in &quot;Ketuanan Melayu&quot;, calling it a &quot;fantasy&quot;, and said instead that he believed in the concept of &quot;Bangsa Malaysia&quot;, but later clarified in 2023 that his vision of Bangsa Malaysia meant the assimilation of non-Malay people into Malay culture and argued against multiculturalism. He has been described as anti-royalist by &quot;Libération&quot;, owing to his efforts to oppose immunity for members of Malaysia&#x27;s monarchies.

Mahathir is a vocal critic of neoliberalism and the Western world. In 2011, Mahathir suggested that the September 11 attacks might have been staged by the United States government. Mahathir condemned the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1997, suggesting it be revised to place greater importance on economic growth over civil liberties. In 2019, Mahathir stated that Malaysians should learn from the hard work of China’s citizens, which enabled their nation to achieve technological advancement within a few decades.

Mahathir has advocated for a balance between environmental protection and natural resource use for economic growth in developing countries. He referred to the outcomes of the Earth Summit as &quot;eco-imperialism&quot;, arguing that Global North countries put an undue burden on Global South countries for environmental degradation. In response to international scrutiny, he said in 2019 that linking palm oil production to deforestation was &quot;baseless, unfair and unjustified&quot; and that the Malaysian palm oil sector had developed sustainably.

=== Antisemitism ===

A strident critic of Israel, Mahathir has been accused of antisemitism throughout his political life. In &quot;The Malay Dilemma,&quot; he wrote that &quot;Jews are not merely hook-nosed, but understand money instinctively&quot;. In August 1983, Mahathir claimed in a speech that Jews control the international media. In March 1994, he banned the screening of &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; on the grounds that he viewed it as anti-German, pro-Jewish propaganda. During the collapse of the ringgit and the economic crisis in 1997, he made a series of remarks blaming Jews, in particular George Soros, a Jewish &quot;agenda&quot;, and &quot;an international Jewish conspiracy&quot; attempting to destroy the economies of Muslim countries.

During an Organization of Islamic Cooperation summit held in Kuala Lumpur in 2003, he accused Jews of &quot;ruling the world by proxy&quot; and getting &quot;others to fight and die for them&quot;. His speech was denounced by President George W. Bush. In 2012, he claimed he was &quot;glad to be labelled antisemitic&quot;. In a 2018 BBC interview he repeated similar statements, as well as disputing the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust. In 2019, when asked why he had previously claimed that Jews are &quot;inclined towards money&quot; he responded that he had Jewish friends, and that &quot;they are not like the other Jews, that&#x27;s why they are my friends.&quot; Mahathir has defended his comments about Jews as an exercise of free speech, and by claiming that &quot;the Jews do a lot of wrong things which force us to pass comment.&quot;

=== LGBT rights ===
Mahathir opposes an expansion of LGBT rights in Malaysia. In 2001, Mahathir said that any homosexual ministers from the United Kingdom would be barred from entering Malaysia. During an October 2018 lecture to university students in Bangkok, Mahathir contrasted Malaysian values with those of Western nations and cited &quot;the institution of marriage [and] the family&quot; in his opposition to LGBT.

=== Comment about 2020 Nice stabbing ===
In the aftermath of the 2020 Nice stabbing and murder of Samuel Paty, Mahathir posted remarks on his blog. Mahathir said that the attacks were wrong and against Islam, but also argued that Muslims had a right to be angry and kill French people for past massacres committed by the French. Mahathir&#x27;s post was later circulated on his Twitter account, where it was labelled for &quot;glorifying violence&quot;.

Mahathir was criticised for stoking tensions and hatred by the former Australian ambassador to France Brendan Berne, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, and French secretary of state for digital affairs Cédric O. Malaysian cleric and politician Fathul Bari Mat Jahya also condemned Mahathir&#x27;s remarks.

Mahathir responded that his comments were taken out of context and he was not &quot;promoting massacre of the French&quot;. Facebook and Twitter later removed his posts.

==Personal life==

Mahathir&#x27;s hobbies include sailing, horse riding and carpentry. He has built a functioning steam train and a boat. Mahathir attributed his longevity to disciplined eating habits, reading newspapers daily, exercising and maintaining upright posture. His favourite song is &quot;My Way&quot;. Mahathir once revealed that he owns close to 40 horses, which were gifted to him. An avid reader, his favourite authors are Wilbur Smith and Jeffrey Archer. Mahathir, known as a workaholic, humorously remarked in 2019 that KSM is the award he adores, explaining that it stood for &quot;Kerja Sampai Mati&quot; (work till death).

According to the United Press International (UPI), Mahathir enjoys activities such as cooking and driving his family to downtown restaurants, reflecting a preference for simplicity in his personal life. Despite Malaysian culture&#x27;s traditional emphasis on courtesy and tolerance, Mahathir is known for his focus on detail and emphasis on swift decision-making. Speaking to &quot;Malaysiakini&quot;, Mahathir&#x27;s granddaughter, Ineza, described him as a family-oriented man who enjoys spending time with his family and joking around with his grandchildren.

On 22 March 1976, Mahathir was involved in a car accident near Sekinchan. No one was injured, and he continued his journey in a police escort car to officiate school events.

Mahathir&#x27;s childhood home in Alor Setar, was opened to the public on 19 December, 1992. Named &quot;Rumah Kelahiran Mahathir Mohamad&quot;, it showcases items such as photographs, personal documents, and medical instruments from his early life. The restoration project, led by the National Archives, was their second after P. Ramlee&#x27;s house in Penang.
On 23 September 2024, Mahathir shared a video of himself driving at the Sepang International Circuit (SIC). In the three-minute video, he accelerated and reached a speed of 154 km per hour.

===Marriage and family===
While in college, he met his future wife, Siti Hasmah, who was also a medical student. They married in August 1956, when Mahathir was 31 and Siti Hasmah was 30. Their daughter, Marina, viewed this as progressive since it was considered a late marriage for their generation. He and Siti Hasmah had their first child, Marina, in 1957, before conceiving four others, Mirzan, Mokhzani, Melinda, and Mukhriz, as well as adopting three more, Melinda, Maizura and Mazhar, over the following 28 years. On 5 August 2021, Mahathir celebrated his 65th wedding anniversary with Siti Hasmah.

=== Health ===
Mahathir has faced several health challenges, including heart problems, pneumonia, and chronic coughs caused by lung infections. However, he mentioned during the International Convention on Biotechnology in 2002 that he successfully overcame his chronic cough by consuming a Chinese medicine containing Tiger Milk Mushroom.

On 22 August 1981, Mahathir fainted from exhaustion during a speech in Kedah but quickly recovered and resumed duties by meeting Thailand&#x27;s Prime Minister in Bangkok on August 23. Later, he took a two-week vacation in Spain and Portugal to rest.

On 18 January 1989, Mahathir was admitted to the hospital due to chest pains, and subsequently underwent bypass surgery. Despite his doctor’s recommendation for surgery in the US, he insisted on being treated in Malaysia to demonstrate confidence in local medical services. Reflecting on the decision, he noted, “As a doctor myself, I understood the risks, including the possibility of not surviving, as the procedure was not common at the time.” After his recovery, Mahathir left the country on March 12 for visits to London, Spain, and Morocco, where he also met with the Spanish Prime Minister Felipe González. He returned to the country on April 3 and resumed official duties the following day.

On 2 April 1999, Mahathir was admitted to the National Heart Institute (IJN) due to a lung infection after returning from Mecca. He was discharged on 12 April after 11 days of treatment and was advised to rest at home and avoid visitors. Mahathir resumed his duties on 19 April after a week of rest following his treatment.

On 13 September, he was moved out of the Intensive Care Unit to a regular ward. On 23 September, he underwent a three-hour procedure to remove infected tissue from a wound. On 25 September, the IJN stated that Mahathir is conscious with his vital parameters stable as he is eased off his support medication. After 50 days in hospital, Mahathir was discharged from the IJN on 21 October.

He was hospitalised for treatment of another chest infection in Australia in October 2010. On 18 November 2013, Mahathir was admitted to the IJN due to a chest infection and underwent treatment, physiotherapy, and monitoring. On 9 August 2016, he admitted to the IJN again to receive treatment for a chest infection. In February 2018, Mahathir was admitted to the IJN for a chest infection after experiencing a bout of coughing. The following year, as prime minister, he attracted attention when he suffered a nosebleed at a press conference.

On 7 March and 27 March 2021, Mahathir received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.

In December 2021, Mahathir was admitted to the IJN for a medical check-up and observation. He was discharged after several days. In January 2022, Mahathir underwent an unspecified elective medical procedure at the IJN. He was readmitted later the same month, and placed in the coronary care unit. He continued rehabilitation and treatment after being discharged.

In August 2022, Mahathir tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the IJN for observation. He was discharged after receiving treatment.

In August 2023, Mahathir was hospitalised with an infection, he was discharged days later. In January 2024, he was again hospitalised due to an infection, and again six months later in July due to coughing.

The production was well received and had an extended run. A sequel followed in 2011.

<text>Bar billiards is a form of billiards which involves scoring points by potting balls in holes on the playing surface of the table rather than in pockets. Bar billiards developed from the French/Belgian game &quot;billard russe&quot;, of Russian origin. The current form started in the UK in the 1930s and now has leagues in Norfolk, Sussex, Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Surrey, Kent, Cambridgeshire, Hampshire, Suffolk, Yorkshire and Northamptonshire. These counties comprise the All England Bar Billiards Association. There are also leagues in Guernsey and Jersey where the annual world championships take place.

==History==

The game of bar billiards developed originally from the French &quot;billiard&quot;, which due to the expensive tables in the fifteenth century was played only by the French monarchy and the very rich. The game was transformed into &quot;Billiard Russe&quot; during the 16th century for the Russian Tsars and a derivative of Bagatelle played by French royalty.

Bar billiards was first imported into the UK during the early 1930s when David Gill, an Englishman witnessed a game of &quot;billiard russe&quot; (Russian billiards) taking place in Belgium. He persuaded the Jelkes company of Holloway Road in London to make a similar table. Tables were also made by Sams, Riley, Burroughs &amp; Watts and Clare. It is now a traditional bar game played in leagues in the English counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Hampshire, Kent, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, Suffolk, Surrey, Sussex and Yorkshire, and also the Channel Islands. The game&#x27;s governing body is the All England Bar Billiards Association. There are also leagues in Guernsey and Jersey. The standard &quot;league&quot; tables have a playing surface approximately 32 inches (81 cm) wide. Sams also made a narrower version with a 28-inch (71 cm) width playing surface.

Earliest versions of the game used wooden mushrooms instead of pegs which have a thin curved stalk and a flattish rounded cap. These were normally placed in front of the 50 and 200 holes often with a fourth mushroom in front of the 100 hole. This version was often referred to as Russian billiards, probably named after the very similar French and Belgian game which has a longer history, neither are to be confused with the common billiards game in Russia. There are a couple of leagues that still play this version in East Anglia in the Norwich and Sudbury areas.

==Gameplay==
* Bar billiards is played on a table with no side or corner pockets, but with nine holes in the playing surface which are assigned various point values ranging from 10 to 200.
* There are eight balls in all, seven white and one red. 
* Potting the red ball in any hole scores double the points on that hole. 
* On the playfield are normally placed three pegs/mushrooms/skittles; There are two white pegs/skittles, one either side of the 100 hole, with one black peg/skittle in front of the 200 hole.
* If a white peg is knocked over then it is a foul shot resulting in the player&#x27;s break being ended and all score acquired during that break is discarded. 
* Knocking down the black peg ends that player&#x27;s break and overall score is zeroed. 
* In the case that a white and a black peg are both knocked over, then the first peg to be knocked over is counted.
* All shots are played from the front end of the table so access to all sides is not required which is ideal in a small bar or pub.
* At the start of the game or when there are no balls remaining on the table, a white ball is placed on the spot labelled D on the table and the red ball is placed on the spot in front of that. 

This break shot may be done a maximum of three times; if both balls are potted before, one ball must remain on the table known as the 1-up, failing to leave this one ball up results in a foul and loss of break. The next shot attempted is the &#x27;split shot&#x27; where the object ball is usually potted in the 50 hole and the cue ball is potted in the 100 hole. There are variants to this; sometimes it is necessary to pot the balls into the 50 and 10 holes for example. If successful the break shot, can be used again and so on.

Players take alternate turns or breaks at the table, playing from where their opponent has left off. If the player fails to pot a ball then the break has ended and the second player takes their break by placing another ball on the first spot. If all balls are in play, then the nearest ball to the D is removed and put on the spot. If a player fails to hit a ball, then the break ends and all points earned in that break are lost.

The play is time-limited. A coin will usually give around 17 minutes of play, dependent on region. After this time a bar drops inside the table stopping any potted balls from returning, leading to a steady decrease in the number of balls in play. The last ball can only be potted into either the 100 or 200 hole having been played off either side cushion.

The Bar Billiards world championship takes place each November on the island of Jersey.

<text>High-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) is the effect of a shaped charge explosive that uses the Munroe effect to penetrate heavy armor. The warhead functions by having an explosive charge collapse a metal liner inside the warhead into a high-velocity shaped charge jet; this is capable of penetrating armor steel to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the charge (charge diameters, CD). The shaped charge jet armor penetration effect is purely kinetic in nature; the round has no explosive or incendiary effect on the armor.

Unlike standard armor-piercing rounds, a HEAT warhead&#x27;s penetration performance is unaffected by the projectile&#x27;s velocity, allowing them to be fired by lower-powered weapons that generate less recoil.

The performance of HEAT weapons has nothing to do with thermal effects, with HEAT being simply an acronym.

== History ==
HEAT warheads were developed during World War II, from extensive research and development into shaped charge warheads. Shaped charge warheads were promoted internationally by the Swiss inventor Henry Mohaupt, who exhibited the weapon before World War II. Before 1939, Mohaupt demonstrated his invention to British and French ordnance authorities. Concurrent development by the German inventors’ group of Cranz, Schardin, and Thomanek led to the first documented use of shaped charges in warfare, during the successful assault on the fortress of Eben Emael on 10 May 1940.

Claims for priority of invention are difficult to resolve due to subsequent historic interpretations, secrecy, espionage, and international commercial interest.

The first British HEAT weapon to be developed and issued was a rifle grenade using a cup launcher on the end of the rifle barrel; the Grenade, Rifle No. 68 /AT which was first issued to the British Armed Forces in 1940. This has some claim to have been the first HEAT warhead and launcher in use. The design of the warhead was simple and was capable of penetrating of armor. The fuze of the grenade was armed by removing a pin in the tail which prevented the firing pin from flying forward. Simple fins gave it stability in the air and, provided the grenade hit the target at the proper angle of 90 degrees, the charge would be effective. Detonation occurred on impact, when a striker in the tail of the grenade overcame the resistance of a creep spring and was thrown forward into a stab detonator.

By mid-1940, Germany introduced the first HEAT round to be fired by a gun, the 7.5 cm Gr.38 Hl/A, (later editions B and C) fired by the KwK.37 L/24 of the Panzer IV tank and the StuG III self-propelled gun . In mid-1941, Germany started the production of HEAT rifle-grenades, first issued to paratroopers and, by 1942, to the regular army units (&quot;Gewehr-Panzergranate 40&quot;, &quot;46&quot; and &quot;61&quot;), but, just as did the British, soon turned to integrated warhead-delivery systems: In 1943, the &quot;Püppchen&quot;, &quot;Panzerschreck&quot; and &quot;Panzerfaust&quot; were introduced.

The &quot;Panzerfaust&quot; and &quot;Panzerschreck&quot; (tank fist and tank terror, respectively) gave the German infantryman the ability to destroy any tank on the battlefield from 50 to 150 meters with relative ease of use and training (unlike the British PIAT). The Germans made use of large quantities of HEAT ammunition in converted 7.5 cm Pak 97/38 guns from 1942, also fabricating HEAT warheads for the &quot;Mistel&quot; weapon. These so-called &quot;Schwere Hohlladung&quot; (heavy shaped charge) warheads were intended for use against heavily armored battleships. Operational versions weighed nearly two tons and were perhaps the largest HEAT warheads ever deployed. A five-ton version code-named &quot;Beethoven&quot; was also developed.
Meanwhile, the British No. 68 AT rifle grenade was proving to be too light to deal significant damage, resulting in it rarely being used in action. Due to these limits, a new infantry anti-tank weapon was needed, and this ultimately came in the form of the &quot;projector, infantry, anti-tank&quot; or PIAT. By 1942, the PIAT had been developed by Major Millis Jefferis. It was a combination of a HEAT warhead with a spigot mortar delivery system. While cumbersome, the weapon allowed British infantry to engage armor at range for the first time. The earlier magnetic hand-mines and grenades required them to approach dangerously near. During World War II the British referred to the Monroe effect as the &quot;cavity effect on explosives&quot;.

During the war, the French communicated Mohaupt&#x27;s technology to the U.S. Ordnance Department, and he was invited to the US, where he worked as a consultant on the bazooka project.

The need for a large bore made HEAT rounds relatively ineffective in existing small-caliber anti-tank guns of the era. Germany worked around this with the Stielgranate 41, introducing a round that was placed over the end on the outside of otherwise obsolete anti-tank guns to produce a medium-range low-velocity weapon.

Adaptations to existing tank guns were somewhat more difficult, although all major forces had done so by the end of the war. Since velocity has little effect on the armor-piercing ability of the round, which is defined by explosive power, HEAT rounds were particularly useful in long-range combat where slower terminal velocity was not an issue. The Germans were again the ones to produce the most capable gun-fired HEAT rounds, using a driving band on bearings to allow it to fly unspun from their existing rifled tank guns. The HEAT round was particularly useful to them because it allowed the low-velocity large-bore guns used on their many assault guns to also become useful anti-tank weapons.

Likewise, the Germans, Italians, and Japanese had in service many obsolescent &quot;infantry guns&quot;, short-barreled, low-velocity artillery pieces capable of direct and indirect fire and intended for infantry support, similar in tactical role to mortars; generally an infantry battalion had a battery of four or six. High-explosive anti-tank rounds for these old infantry guns made them semi-useful anti-tank guns, particularly the German guns (the Japanese 70  mm Type 92 battalion gun and Italian 65 mm mountain gun also had HEAT rounds available for them by 1944 but they were not very effective).

High-explosive anti-tank rounds caused a revolution in anti-tank warfare when they were first introduced in the later stages of World War II. One infantryman could effectively destroy any existing tank with a handheld weapon, thereby dramatically altering the nature of mobile operations. During World War II, weapons using HEAT warheads were termed &quot;hollow charge&quot; or &quot;shape charge&quot; warheads.

=== Post World War II ===
The general public remained in the dark about shape charge warheads, even believing that it was a new secret explosive, until early 1945 when the US Army cooperated with the US monthly publication &quot;Popular Science&quot; on a large and detailed article on the subject titled &quot;It makes steel flow like mud&quot;. It was this article that revealed to the American public how the fabled bazooka actually worked against tanks and that the velocity of the rocket was irrelevant.

After the war, HEAT rounds became almost universal as the primary anti-tank weapon. Models of varying effectiveness were produced for almost all weapons from infantry weapons like rifle grenades and the M203 grenade launcher, to larger dedicated anti-tank systems like the Carl Gustav recoilless rifle. When combined with the wire-guided missile, infantry weapons were able to operate at long-ranges also. Anti-tank missiles altered the nature of tank warfare from the 1960s to the 1990s; due to the tremendous penetration of HEAT munitions, many post-WWII main battle tanks, such as the Leopard 1 and AMX-30, were deliberately designed to carry modest armour in favour of reduced weight and better mobility. Despite subsequent developments in vehicle armour, HEAT munitions remain effective to this day.

== Design ==
=== Penetration performance and effects ===

The jet moves at hypersonic speeds in solid material and therefore erodes exclusively in the local area where it interacts with armor material. The correct detonation point of the warhead and spacing is critical for optimal penetration, for two reasons:

* If the HEAT warhead is detonated too near a target&#x27;s surface, there is not enough time for the jet to fully form. That is why most modern HEAT warheads have what is called a &quot;standoff&quot;, in the form of an extended nose cap or probe in front of the warhead.
* The jet stretches, breaks apart and disperses during travel, reducing effectiveness. Depending on the quality of the HEAT warhead, this happens around 6 to 8 times the charge diameter for low quality and around 12 to 20 times the charge diameter for high quality warheads. For example the 150 mm diameter warhead of the newer BGM-71 TOW (TOW 2) reaches a peak penetration of ~1000 mm RHA at 6.5x diameter (~1 m) and is down to ~500 mm RHA penetration at 19x diameter (~2.8 m).

An important factor in the penetration performance of a HEAT round is the diameter of the warhead. As the penetration continues through the armor, the width of the hole decreases leading to a characteristic &quot;fist to finger&quot; penetration, where the size of the eventual &quot;finger&quot; is based on the size of the original &quot;fist&quot;. In general, very early HEAT rounds could expect to penetrate armor of 150% to 250% of their diameters, and these numbers were typical of early weapons used during World War II. Since then, the penetration of HEAT rounds relative to projectile diameters has steadily increased as a result of improved liner material and metal jet performance. Some modern examples claim numbers as high as 700%.

As for any antiarmor weapon, a HEAT round achieves its effectiveness through three primary mechanisms. Most obviously, when it perforates the armor, the jet&#x27;s residual can cause great damage to any interior components it strikes. And as the jet interacts with the armor, even if it does not perforate into the interior, it typically causes a cloud of irregular fragments of armor material to spall from the inside surface. This cloud of behind-armor debris too will typically damage anything that the fragments strike. Another damage mechanism is the mechanical shock that results from the jet&#x27;s impact and penetration. Shock is particularly important for such sensitive components as electronics.

=== Stabilization and accuracy ===
Spinning imparts centrifugal force onto a warhead&#x27;s jet, dispersing it and reducing effectiveness. This became a challenge for weapon designers: for a long time, spinning a shell was the most standard method to obtain good accuracy, as with any rifled gun. Most hollow charge projectiles are fin-stabilized and not spin-stabilized.

In recent years, it has become possible to use shaped charges in spin-stabilized projectiles by imparting an opposite spin on the jet so that the two spins cancel out and result in a non-spinning jet. This is done either using fluted copper liners, which have raised ridges, or by forming the liner in such a way that it has a crystalline structure which imparts spin to the jet.

Besides spin-stabilization, another problem with any barreled weapon (that is, a gun) is that a large-diameter shell has worse accuracy than a small-diameter shell of the same weight. The lessening of accuracy increases dramatically with range. Paradoxically, this leads to situations when a kinetic armor-piercing projectile is &quot;more&quot; usable at long ranges than a HEAT projectile, despite the latter having a &quot;higher&quot; armor penetration. To illustrate this: a stationary Soviet T-62 tank, firing a (smoothbore) cannon at a range of 1000 meters against a target moving 19 km/h was rated to have a first-round hit probability of 70% when firing a kinetic projectile. Under the same conditions, it could expect 25% when firing a HEAT round. This affects combat on the open battlefield with long lines of sight; the same T-62 could expect a 70% first-round hit probability using HEAT rounds on target at 500 meters.

Additionally, a warhead&#x27;s diameter is restricted by a gun&#x27;s caliber if it is contained within the barrel. In non-gun applications, when HEAT warheads are delivered with missiles, rockets, bombs, grenades, or spigot mortars, the warhead size is no longer a limiting factor. In these cases, HEAT warheads often seem oversized in relation to the round&#x27;s body. Classic examples of this include the German Panzerfaust and Soviet RPG-7.

== Variants ==
Many HEAT-armed missiles today have two (or more) separate warheads (termed a tandem charge) to be more effective against reactive or multi-layered armor. The first, smaller warhead initiates the reactive armor, while the second (or other), larger warhead penetrates the armor below. This approach requires highly sophisticated fuzing electronics to set off the two warheads the correct time apart, and also special barriers between the warheads to stop unwanted interactions; this makes them cost more to produce.

The latest HEAT warheads, such as 3BK-31, feature triple charges: the first penetrates the spaced armor, the second the reactive or first layers of armor, and the third one finishes the penetration. The total penetration value may reach up to .

Some anti-armor weapons incorporate a variant on the shaped charge concept that, depending on the source, can be called an explosively formed penetrator (EFP), self-forging fragment (SFF), self-forging projectile (SEFOP), plate charge, or Misnay Schardin (MS) charge. This warhead type uses the interaction of the detonation waves, and to a lesser extent the propulsive effect of the detonation products, to deform a dish or plate of metal (iron, tantalum, etc.) into a slug-shaped projectile of low length-to-diameter ratio and project this towards the target at around two kilometers per second.

The SFF is relatively unaffected by first-generation reactive armor, it can also travel more than 1,000 cone diameters (CDs) before its velocity becomes ineffective at penetrating armor due to aerodynamic drag, or hitting the target becomes a problem. The impact of an SFF normally causes a large diameter, but relatively shallow hole (relative to a shaped charge) or, at best, a few CDs. If the SFF perforates the armor, extensive behind-armor damage (BAD, also called behind-armor effect (BAE)) occurs. The BAD is mainly caused by the high temperature and velocity armor and slug fragments being injected into the interior space and also overpressure (blast) caused by the impact.

More modern SFF warhead versions, through the use of advanced initiation modes, can also produce rods (stretched slugs), multi-slugs and finned projectiles, and this in addition to the standard short L to D ratio projectile. The stretched slugs are able to penetrate a much greater depth of armor, at some loss to BAD. Multi-slugs are better at defeating light or area targets and the finned projectiles have greatly enhanced accuracy. The use of this warhead type is mainly restricted to lightly armored areas of MBTs—the top, belly and rear armored areas, for example. It is well suited for use in the attack of other less heavily armored fighting vehicles (AFVs) and for breaching material targets (buildings, bunkers, bridge supports, etc.). The newer rod projectiles may be effective against the more heavily armored areas of MBTs.

Weapons using the SEFOP principle have already been used in combat; the smart submunitions in the CBU-97 cluster bomb used by the US Air Force and US Navy in the 2003 Iraq war used this principle, and the US Army is reportedly experimenting with precision-guided artillery shells under Project SADARM (Seek And Destroy Armor). There are also various other projectiles (BONUS, DM 642) and rocket submunitions (Motiv-3M, DM 642) and mines (MIFF, TMRP-6) that use the SFF principle.

===Multipurpose===

With the effectiveness of gun-fired single charge HEAT rounds being lessened, or even negated by increasingly sophisticated armoring techniques, a class of HEAT rounds termed &quot;high-explosive anti-tank multi-purpose&quot;, or HEAT-MP, has become more popular. These are HEAT rounds that are effective against older tanks and light armored vehicles but have improved fragmentation, blast and fuzing. This gives the projectiles an overall reasonable light armor and anti-personnel and material effect so that they can be used in place of conventional high-explosive rounds against infantry and other battlefield targets. This reduces the total number of rounds that need to be carried for different roles, which is particularly important for modern tanks like the M1 Abrams, due to the size of their rounds. The M1A1/M1A2 tank can carry only 40 rounds for its 120 mm M256 gun—the M60A3 Patton tank (the Abrams&#x27; predecessor), carried 63 rounds for its M68 gun. This effect is reduced by the higher first round hit rate of the Abrams with its improved fire control system compared to that of the M60.
Another variant of HEAT warheads surround the warhead with a conventional fragmentation casing, to increase its effectiveness against unarmored targets, while remaining effective in the anti-armor role. In some cases, this is merely a side effect of the armor-piercing design, whilst other designs specifically incorporate this dual role ability.

== Defense ==
Improvements to the armor of main battle tanks have reduced the usefulness of HEAT warheads by making effective man portable HEAT missiles heavier, although many of the world&#x27;s armies continue to carry man-portable HEAT rocket launchers for use against vehicles and bunkers. In unusual cases, shoulder-launched HEAT rockets are believed to have shot down U.S. helicopters in Iraq.

The reason for the ineffectiveness of HEAT munitions against modern main battle tanks can be attributed in part to the use of new types of armor. The jet created by the explosion of the HEAT round must be a certain distance from the target and must not be deflected. Reactive armor attempts to defeat this with an outward directed explosion under the impact point, causing the jet to deform and so greatly reducing penetrating power. Alternatively, composite armor featuring ceramics erode the liner jet faster than rolled homogeneous armor steel, the preferred material in constructing older armored fighting vehicles.

Spaced armor and slat armor are also designed to defend against HEAT rounds, protecting vehicles by causing premature detonation of the explosive at a relatively safe distance away from the main armor of the vehicle. Some cage defenses work by destroying the mechanism of the HEAT round.

== Deployment ==
Helicopters have carried anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) tipped with HEAT warheads since 1956. The first example of this was the use of the Nord SS.11 ATGM on the Aérospatiale Alouette II helicopter by the French Armed Forces. After then, such weapon systems were widely adopted by other nations.

On 13 April 1972—during the Vietnam War—Americans Major Larry McKay, Captain Bill Causey, First Lieutenant Steve Shields, and Chief Warrant Officer Barry McIntyre became the first helicopter crew to destroy enemy armor in combat. A flight of two AH-1 Cobra helicopters, dispatched from Battery F, 79th Artillery, 1st Cavalry Division, were armed with the newly developed M247 70 millimeter (2.8 in) HEAT rockets, which were yet untested in the theatre of war. The helicopters destroyed three T-54 tanks that were about to overrun a U.S. command post. McIntyre and McKay engaged first, destroying the lead tank.

<doc id="255971" wikidata="Q828296" url="?curid=255971" title="Death in Venice">
<text>Death in Venice () is a novella by German author Thomas Mann, published in 1912. It presents an ennobled writer who visits Venice and is liberated, uplifted, and then increasingly obsessed by the sight of a boy in a family of Polish tourists—Tadzio, a nickname for Tadeusz. Tadzio was likely based on a boy named Władzio whom Mann had observed during his 1911 visit to the city.

==Plot==
The main character is Gustav von Aschenbach, a famous Silesian author in his early 50s who recently has been ennobled in honor of his artistic achievement (thus acquiring the aristocratic &quot;&quot; in his name). He is a man dedicated to his art, disciplined and ascetic to the point of severity, who was widowed at a young age. 

As the story opens, he is strolling outside a cemetery and sees a coarse-looking, red-haired foreigner who stares back at him belligerently. Aschenbach walks away, embarrassed but curiously stimulated. He has a vision of a primordial swamp-wilderness, fertile, exotic and full of lurking danger. Soon afterward, he resolves to take a holiday.

After a false start in traveling to Pula on the Austro-Hungarian coast (now in Croatia), Aschenbach realizes he was &quot;meant&quot; to go to Venice and takes a suite in the Grand Hôtel des Bains on the island of Lido. While shipbound and en route to the island, he sees an elderly man in company with a group of high-spirited youths, who has tried hard to create the illusion of his own youth with a wig, false teeth, make-up, and foppish attire. Aschenbach turns away in disgust. Later, he has a disturbing encounter with an unlicensed gondolier—another red-haired, skull-faced foreigner—who repeats &quot;I can row you well&quot; when Aschenbach orders him to return to the wharf.

Aschenbach checks in to his hotel, where at dinner he sees an aristocratic Polish family at a nearby table. Among them is an adolescent boy of about 14 in a sailor suit. Aschenbach, startled, realizes that the boy is supremely beautiful, like a Greek sculpture. His elder sisters, by contrast, are so severely dressed that they look like nuns. 

Later, after spying the boy and his family at a beach, Aschenbach overhears Tadzio, the boy&#x27;s name, pronounced &quot;Tadjoo&quot; in Polish by his mother, and conceives what he first interprets as an uplifting, artistic interest.

Soon the hot, humid weather begins to affect Aschenbach&#x27;s health, and he decides to leave early and move to a cooler location. On the morning of his planned departure, he sees Tadzio again, and a powerful feeling of regret sweeps over him. When he reaches the railway station and discovers his trunk has been misplaced, he pretends to be angry, but is really overjoyed; he decides to remain in Venice and wait for his lost luggage. He happily returns to the hotel and thinks no more of leaving.

Over the next days and weeks, Aschenbach&#x27;s interest in the beautiful boy develops into an obsession. He watches him constantly and secretly follows him around Venice. One evening, the boy directs a charming smile at him, looking, Aschenbach thinks, like Narcissus smiling at his own reflection. Disconcerted, Aschenbach rushes outside, and in the empty garden whispers aloud &quot;I love you!&quot;

Aschenbach next takes a trip into the city of Venice, where he sees a few discreetly worded notices from the Health Department warning of an unspecified contagion and advising people to avoid eating shellfish. He smells an unfamiliar strong odor everywhere, later realising it is disinfectant. However, the authorities adamantly deny that the contagion is serious, and tourists continue to wander obliviously round the city. 

Aschenbach at first ignores the danger because it somehow pleases him to think that the city&#x27;s disease is akin to his own hidden, corrupting passion for the boy. During this period, a third red-haired and disreputable-looking man crosses Aschenbach&#x27;s path; this one belongs to a troupe of street singers who entertain at the hotel one night. Aschenbach listens entranced to songs that, in his former life, he would have despised—all the while stealing glances at Tadzio, who is leaning on a nearby parapet in a classically beautiful pose. The boy eventually returns Aschenbach&#x27;s glances, and although the moment is brief, it instills in the writer a sense that the attraction may be mutual.

Next, Aschenbach rallies his self-respect and decides to discover the reason for the health notices posted in the city. After being repeatedly assured that the sirocco is the only health risk, he finds a British travel agent who reluctantly admits that there is a serious cholera epidemic in Venice. 

Aschenbach considers warning Tadzio&#x27;s mother of the danger; however, he decides not to, knowing that if he does, Tadzio will leave the hotel and be lost to him. But Aschenbach is not rational; &quot;nothing is as abhorrent to anyone who is beside himself as returning into himself... The awareness that he was complicit, that he too was guilty, intoxicated him...&quot;

One night, a dream filled with orgiastic Dionysian imagery reveals to him the sexual nature of his feelings for Tadzio. Afterward, he begins staring at the boy so openly and following him so persistently that Aschenbach feels the boy&#x27;s guardians have finally noticed, and they take to warning Tadzio whenever he approaches too near the strange, solitary man. However, Aschenbach&#x27;s feelings, although passionately intense, remain unvoiced; he never touches Tadzio or speaks to him, and while there is some indication that Tadzio is aware of his admiration, the two exchange nothing more than occasionally surreptitious glances.

Aschenbach begins to fret about his aging face and body. In an attempt to look more attractive, he visits the hotel&#x27;s barber shop almost daily, where the barber persuades him to have his hair dyed and his face painted to look more youthful. The result is a fairly close approximation to the old man on the ship who had so appalled Aschenbach. 

Freshly dyed and rouged, he again shadows Tadzio through Venice in the oppressive heat. He loses sight of the boy in the heart of the city; then, exhausted and thirsty, he buys and eats some over-ripe strawberries and rests in an abandoned square, contemplating the Platonic ideal of beauty amid the ruins of his own once-formidable dignity.

A few days later, Aschenbach goes to the lobby in his hotel, feeling ill and weak, and discovers that the Polish family plans to leave after lunch. He goes to the beach to his usual deck chair. Tadzio is there, unsupervised for once, and accompanied by Jasiu, an older boy. A fight starts between the two boys, and Tadzio is quickly bested; afterward, he angrily leaves his companion and wades over to Aschenbach&#x27;s part of the beach, where he stands for a moment looking out to sea, then turns halfway around to look at his admirer. To Aschenbach, it is as if the boy is beckoning to him: He tries to rise and follow, only to collapse sideways into his chair.

His body is discovered minutes later.

==Origins==
Mann&#x27;s original intention was to write about &quot;passion as confusion and degradation&quot; after having been fascinated by the true story of Goethe&#x27;s love for 17-year-old Baroness Ulrike von Levetzow, which had led Goethe to write his &quot;Marienbad Elegy&quot;. The May 1911 death of composer Gustav Mahler in Vienna and Mann&#x27;s interest in the boy Władzio during a summer 1911 vacation in Venice were additional experiences occupying his thoughts. He used the story to illuminate certain convictions about the relationship between life and mind, with Aschenbach representing the intellect. Mann also was influenced by Sigmund Freud and his views on dreams, as well as by philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who had visited Venice several times.

==Allusions==
The novella is rife with allusions from antiquity forward, especially to Greek antiquity and to German works (literary, art-historical, musical, visual) from the 18th century.

The novella is intertextual, with the chief sources being first the connection of erotic love to philosophical wisdom traced in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot; and &quot;Phaedrus&quot;, and second the Nietzschean contrast between Apollo, the god of restraint and shaping form, and Dionysus, the god of excess and passion. The trope of placing classical deities in contemporary settings was popular at the time when Mann was writing &quot;Death in Venice&quot;.

Aschenbach&#x27;s name and character may be inspired by the homosexual German poet August von Platen-Hallermünde. There are allusions to his poems about Venice in the novella, and like Aschenbach, he died of cholera on an Italian island. Aschenbach&#x27;s first name is almost an anagram of August, and the character&#x27;s last name may be derived from Ansbach, Platen&#x27;s birthplace (however, Aschenbach is a real ancient German name, for instance, the founder of the Kishkin family). However, the name has another clear significance: Aschenbach literally means &quot;ash brook&quot;. It &quot;suggests dead ashes (&quot;Aschen&quot;) clogging the stream (&quot;Bach&quot;) of life&quot;.

The novella&#x27;s physical description of Aschenbach was based on a photograph of the composer Gustav Mahler. Mahler had made a strong personal impression on Mann when they met in Munich, and Mann was shocked by the news of Mahler&#x27;s death in Vienna. Mann gave Mahler&#x27;s first name and facial appearance to Aschenbach but did not talk about it in public. The soundtrack of the 1971 film based on the novella made use of Mahler&#x27;s compositions, particularly the &quot;Adagietto&quot; 4th movement from the Symphony No. 5, and made Aschenbach into a composer instead of a writer. 

Aschenbach&#x27;s name may be an allusion to Wolfram von Eschenbach, the author of the Middle High German medieval romance &quot;Parzival&quot;, whose reimagining and continuation of the Grail Quest romance of Chrétien de Troyes contained themes similar to those found in Mann&#x27;s novella, such as the author&#x27;s fascination with and idealization of the purity of youthful innocence and beauty, as well as the eponymous protagonist&#x27;s quest to restore healing and youthfulness to Anfortas, the wounded, old Fisher King. Given Mann&#x27;s obsession with the works of Richard Wagner, who famously adapted and transformed von Eschenbach&#x27;s epic into his opera &quot;Parsifal&quot;, it is possible that Mann was crediting Wagner&#x27;s opera by referencing the author of the work that had inspired the composer.

Modris Eksteins notes the similarities between Aschenbach and the Russian choreographer Sergei Diaghilev, writing that, although the two never met, &quot;Diaghilev knew Mann&#x27;s story well. He gave copies of it to his intimates&quot;. Diaghilev often stayed at the same hotel as Aschenbach, the Grand Hotel des Bains, and took his young male lovers there. Eventually, like Aschenbach, Diaghilev died in the hotel.

==The real Tadzio==
In her 1974 &quot;Unwritten Memories&quot;, Mann&#x27;s wife Katia recalls that the idea for the story came during an actual vacation in Venice at the Grand Hôtel des Bains on the Lido, which they took in the summer of 1911:

The boy who inspired &quot;Tadzio&quot; was perhaps Baron Władysław Moes, whose first name was usually shortened as Władzio or just Adzio. This story was uncovered by Andrzej Dołęgowski, Thomas Mann&#x27;s translator, around 1964, and was published in the German press in 1965.

Moes was born on 17 November 1900 in Wierbka, the second son and fourth child of Baron Aleksander Juliusz Moes. He was aged 10 when he was in Venice, significantly younger than Tadzio in the novella. Baron Moes died on 17 December 1986 in Warsaw and is interred at the graveyard of Pilica, Silesian Voivodeship. He was the subject of the biography &quot;The Real Tadzio&quot; (Short Books, 2001) by Gilbert Adair. Ironically, while in the novella Aschenbach is Silesian, it was Moes who was really Silesian.

However, serious doubts about this identification were raised in an article in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; in 2002, mainly because of the significant differences in age and physical appearance between the Tadzio figure of the novella and Moes. The same article offers another candidate in the form of Adam von Henzel-Dzieduszycki, a Polish-Austrian, who was also on vacation in the same hotel in the summer of 1911 and was 15 years old at the time.

==English translations==
An English translation by Kenneth Burke was published in periodical form in &quot;The Dial&quot; in 1924 over three issues (vol. LXXVI, March to May, issues # 3–5, Camden, NJ, USA). This translation was published in book form the following year by Alfred A. Knopf as &quot;Death in Venice and Other Stories&quot;. W. H. Auden called it the definitive translation, but it is unclear to what other translations Auden was comparing it.

Helen Tracy Lowe-Porter&#x27;s authorized translation, published in 1922 in Mann&#x27;s &quot;Stories of Three Decades&quot;, has been less well received by critics due to Lowe-Porter&#x27;s treatment of sexuality and homoeroticism. In the &quot;Oxford Guide to Literature in English Translation&quot; it is criticized for its &quot;puritanism&quot;, which saw Lowe-Porter &quot;tone down Mann&#x27;s treatment of sexuality, especially homoeroticism&quot;. The author considers the result &quot;disastrous&quot; and sees &quot;a reworked, sanitized version of the text&quot; by Mann.

A translation published in 2005 by Michael Henry Heim won the Helen and Kurt Wolff Translator&#x27;s Prize.

Other English translations include those by David Luke (1988), Clayton Koelb (1994), Stanley Applebaum (1995), Joachim Neugroschel (1998), Martin C. Doege (2010), and Damion Searls (2023). Lesley Chamberlain writes that her translation of &quot;Death in Venice&quot; in be published in 2026.

<doc id="255974" wikidata="Q5442458" url="?curid=255974" title="Fellfield">
<text>A fellfield or fell field comprises the environment of a slope, usually alpine or tundra, where the dynamics of frost (freeze and thaw cycles) and of wind give rise to characteristic plant forms in scree interstices.

==Soil dynamics==
The freeze-thaw cycles tend to push plants out of the soil. In addition, the high porosity of the soil makes a fellfield a difficult place for plants to grow. Fellfields often have typical patterns of rocks: lines of rocks that have been pushed out of the soil, and slid into a low region.

==Botany==
In botany the term &quot;fellfield&quot; describes an ecoregion, ecosystem, habitat, or plant community. The term frequently used is alpine fellfield. Fellfield is usually applied to an alpine tundra region of high altitude mountains, or high latitude islands, and the alpine plants there.

===Flora===
Fellfields are typically populated by cushion plants: perennials that grow close to the ground. Cushion plants are well-adapted to the dryness and short growing season of a fellfield. Cushion plants often have hairy foliage and long taproots, to gather and retain moisture. Examples of cushion plants include the lupines and buckwheats.

====Fellfield species====
*Alpine flora list
** &quot;Azorella selago&quot;
** &quot;Oenothera xylocarpa&quot;
** &quot;Calyptridium umbellatum&quot;

Some geologists find it is controversial to share the term for biology and geomorphology applications.

<doc id="255977" wikidata="Q5332" url="?curid=255977" title="Saratov">
<text>Saratov ( , ; , ) is the largest city and administrative center of Saratov Oblast, Russia, and a major port on the Volga River. Saratov had a population of 901,361, making it the 17th-largest city in Russia by population. Saratov is north of Volgograd, south of Samara, and southeast of Moscow.

The city stands near the site of Uvek, a city of the Golden Horde. Tsar Feodor I of Russia likely developed Saratov as a fortress to secure Russia&#x27;s southeastern border. Saratov developed as a shipping port along the Volga and was historically important to the Volga Germans, who settled in large numbers in the city before they were expelled before and during World War II.

Saratov is home to a number of cultural and educational institutions, including the Saratov Drama Theater, Saratov Conservatory, Radishchev Art Museum, Saratov State Technical University, and Saratov State University.

==Etymology==
The name Saratov may have been derived from, &quot;Sary Tau&quot; (Сары Тау), meaning &quot;Yellow Mountain&quot; in the Tatar language. Another version of the name originates from the words, &quot;Sar Atau&quot;, which means [the] &quot;Boggy Island&quot;.

==History==
Uvek, a city of the Golden Horde, stood near the site of the modern city of Saratov from the mid-13th century until its destruction by Tamerlane in 1395. While the exact date of the foundation of modern Saratov is unknown, plausible theories date it to ca. 1590, during the reign (1584–1598) of Tsar Fyodor Ivanovich, who constructed several settlements along the Volga River in order to secure the southeastern boundary of his state. Town status was granted to it in 1708.

By the 1800s, Saratov had grown to become an important shipping port on the Volga. The Ryazan-Ural Railroad reached Saratov in 1870. In 1896, the line crossed the Volga and continued its eastward expansion. A unique train-ferry, owned by the Ryazan-Ural railroad, provided the connection across the river between the two ends of the railroad for 39 years, before the construction of a railway bridge in 1935.

During January 1915, with World War I dominating the Russian national agenda, Saratov became the destination for deportation convoys of ethnic Germans, Jews, Hungarians, Austrians and Slavs whose presence closer to the western front was perceived as a potential security risk to the state.

During World War II, Saratov was a station on the north–south Volzhskaya Rokada, a specially designated military railroad supplying troops, ammunition and supplies to Stalingrad. In 1942-1943 the city was bombed by German aircraft. The main target was the Kirov oil refinery, which was heavily bombarded, seriously damaging the installation and destroying 80% of its plant and temporarily interrupting its work. The Luftwaffe was able to destroy all the fuel stock at bases in Saratov and eliminate the oil plant in the city.

Until the end of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Soviet authorities designated Saratov a &quot;closed city&quot;; off-limits to all foreigners due to its military importance as the site of a vital facility manufacturing military aircraft.

===German community===
Saratov played a prominent role in the history of the Volga Germans. Catherine II, through her two edicts published in Germany, had promised the settlers that they would remain German, enjoying a great deal of autonomy, even if they moved to the Volga region, and they did so. There, the Germans continued with their German language, their own education, their churches (for the Catholics the Diocese of Tiraspol was later founded and seated in Saratov), their publications, etc.

However, after more than a century living in that region, the living conditions of the Germans began to change. Catherine II was no longer alive, and the government began to apply an aggressive Russification policy, which meant that from 1878 some groups of Volga Germans began to emigrate to the United States, Canada, Brazil and Argentina. Those who could not leave or who remained in the hope conditions would improve suffered greatly. Hostilities did not stop even after the confiscation of their assets. In 1941, Stalin ordered the deportation of all ethnic Germans.

Today only a few reminders remain of the once prominent place for Volga Germans. The Roman Catholic St. Klemens Cathedral, which had been built by the Volga Germans on the main street of Saratov, the then called &quot;German Street&quot; (, ), has its steeples removed and was converted into the Pioneer Cinema by order of the Soviet government (religion was prohibited). Meanwhile, the old German Street, the pedestrian street of Saratov, was renamed &quot;Kirov Prospect&quot; in reference to the Bolshevik leader Sergei Kirov. On April 18, 2022, Kirov Prospect was officially renamed by decree of the city mayor to Stolypin Prospect.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Saratov is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Saratovsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the city of oblast significance of Saratov—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Saratov is incorporated as Saratov Urban Okrug.

Nearby Engels-2 (air base) is the main base for Russian strategic Tu-95 and Tu-160 bombers. Motorways link Saratov directly to Volgograd, Samara, and Voronezh. The railways also play an important role. The Privolzhskaya Railway is headquartered in Saratov. The Volga itself is an important inland waterway. Buses and trolleybuses form the backbone of public transport in the city.

Saratov has a tram network, which opened in 1908. Currently, there are two depots, while a third was closed in 2001. The rolling stock currently consists of 71-605, 71-619, 71-608 and a number of refurbished Tatra T3, renamed to MTTE and MTTCh.

==Culture==

One of the city&#x27;s most prominent landmarks is the 19th century neo-Gothic Conservatory. When it was built in 1912, the Conservatory was Russia&#x27;s third such institution (after Moscow and St. Petersburg). At the time, Saratov, with a population of 240,000, was the third-largest city in Russia. The main building of the conservatory had been built in 1902 by architect Alexander Yulyevich Yagn, and originally it housed a music school. Before the opening of the conservatory in 1912, the building was reconstructed by the architect Semyon Akimovich Kallistratov. When Saratov Conservatory opened in September 1912, it immediately had 1,000 students ready to begin their studies.

The Saratov Drama Theater was founded in 1802, making it one of Russia&#x27;s oldest. It is ranked as one of Russia&#x27;s National Theaters. In Soviet times, the theater was renamed in honor of Karl Marx, but now carries the name of Ivan Slonov (1882–1945), an actor, theatrical director and educator, born in the city. The full name in Russian is The I. A. Slonov Saratov State Academic Theater ().

Saratov is noted for several art museums, including the Radishchev Art Museum, named for Alexander Radishchev, Fedin Art Museum, named after Russian novelist Konstantin Fedin, Saratov Local History Museum, Chernyshevsky Estate Museum, named for Nikolay Chernyshevsky, and some others. The Radishchev Art Museum contains more than 20,000 exhibits, including ancient Russian icons, works by Camille Corot, Auguste Rodin, as well as works by some of the finest Russian painters (e.g. Ivan Kramskoy, Vasily Polenov, Ilya Repin, Ivan Shishkin, Aleksandra Ekster, Pavel Kuznetsov, Aristarkh Lentulov, Robert Falk, Pyotr Konchalovsky, Martiros Saryan, Fyodor Rokotov).

<doc id="255979" wikidata="Q204827" url="?curid=255979" title="Lianjiang County">
<text>Lianjiang (; BUC: Lièng-gŏng) is a county on the eastern coast in Fuzhou prefecture-level city, the provincial capital of Fujian Province, China. Most of the county is administered by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), while a number of outlying islands, collectively referred to as the Matsu Islands, are administered as [[Matsu Islands|Lienchiang County]] (same Chinese character name in traditional Chinese characters and referred to using Wade–Giles romanization) by the Republic of China (ROC) (now based in Taiwan) ever since their return to ROC control after Japanese occupation in World War II.

==History==
Lianjiang, in 282, during the Jin dynasty, was Wenma, named after a shipyard there, Wensha Ship-hamlet (溫麻船屯). It was incorporated into Min Prefecture (閩縣) in 607, during the Sui dynasty.

Wenma was changed to the present name and made its own county in 623, during the Tang dynasty, when Baisha (白沙) or Fusha (伏沙) of Aojiang was the capital of Lianjiang County. The capital was changed to Fengcheng as today in 742.

After the Republic of China was established, Lianjiang switched back and forth numerous times between two special regions:

* Minhou Special Region (閩侯專區): 18 years in total
* Fu&#x27;an (Ningde) Special Region (福安（寧德）專區): 16 years in total

During the Second Sino-Japanese War on September 10, 1937, Japan seized the two Lianjiang islands of Beigan and Nangan via the Collaborationist Chinese Army, making the islands the first in Fujian to fall to Japan. This led the county government to relocate to Danyang Township on April 19, 1941, before returning at the end of the war.

In 1949, the county was split in two due to the Chinese Civil War, as it remains today.

On March 4, 1964, a Chinese Nationalist commando raid on the Chinese Communist Party headquarters of the county captured and returned a commune file to Taipei.

Beginning on 1 July 1983, the PRC side reverted control to Fuzhou Municipality. In the late 1980s, people living in Lianjiang County began a massive emigration wave to western countries like the United Kingdom and the United States.

==Geography==

Gaodeng Island in Lienchiang County (the Matsu Islands), ROC (Taiwan), is located away from the Beijiao Peninsula () in Lianjiang County, China (PRC).

* Xiaocheng (Hsiao-ch&#x27;eng; – Xiǎochéng)
* Changlong (, formerly ) (&quot;Long Dragon&quot;)
* Kengyuan (K&#x27;eng-yüan; , formerly )

* &quot;Mazu ()&quot;*

These townships are divided into 266 villages.

==Culture==
Residents of Lianjiang – both on the Mainland and Matsu – speak the Lianjiang dialect, a subdialect of the Fuzhou dialect, a branch of Eastern Min. The dialect is also known as &quot;Bàng-uâ&quot; (平話).

=== Language ===
The Lianjiang dialect is a subdialect of Fuzhou dialect (the most prestigious dialect of Eastern Min). The Lianjiang dialect is mutually intelligible with Fuzhou dialect. It differs from Fuzhou dialect in its tonal sandhi pattern and vowel sandhi system. Small lexical differences also exist on object names, e.g. waxmelon is called &quot;卷瓜&quot; in Fuzhou but &quot;冬瓜&quot; in Lianjiang.

Generally speaking, the tonal sandhi system of Lianjiang is more conservative than that of Fuzhou, in that the Lianjiang tonal sandhi is still largely controlled by the Middle Chinese tonal registers, while the Fuzhou tonal sandhi shows more deviation and irregularity.

Lianjiang vowel sandhi is more complicated than that of Fuzhou. Both Lianjiang and Fuzhou have systematic vowel variations between citation forms and non-final forms of the same morpheme, e.g. &quot;地&quot; /tei/ &quot;land&quot; – &quot;地主&quot; /ti-tsuo/ &quot;landlord&quot;. However, not all morphemes have such variations. Only the morphemes with low-starting tones show such variation. The morphemes with high-starting tones instead only have the more close variant, e.g. &quot;迟&quot; /ti/ &quot;late&quot;- &quot;迟早&quot; /ti tsia/ &quot;early or late&quot;. However, some cognates are produced with different vowels in Lianjiang and Fuzhou, e.g. &quot;江 river&quot; is produced as /kyeŋ/ in Lianjiang, but /kouŋ/ in Fuzhou. Also, the rimes in Lianjiang are generally more close and front than that in Fuzhou, which is especially salient in the open vowels, e.g. &quot;下 down&quot; is [ɑ] in Fuzhou, but [a] in Lianjiang.

Surrounded by mountains, Lianjiang used to be a relatively isolated from the inland part of China for centuries. This explains why the Lianjiang phonological system is relatively more conservative. However, with the construction of the high-speed railway system and the improvement of tunnel system, northern migrants are flooding into Lianjiang in the past decade, which may bring language contact into perspective. Just like in Fuzhou, most young or middle-aged Lianjiang speakers speak Mandarin Chinese fluently, but usually with a local accent influenced by the local dialect. However, due to the misleading language policy (Not speaking Mandarin Chinese is taken as &quot;immoral&quot;.) and disadvantageous status of the dialect, both Fuzhou and Lianjiang dialects are losing speakers in the youngest generation. More and more young people and children are only receptive bilinguals in Lianjiang.

==Economy==

Food products:
* Farm: loquats, rice, sweet potato, bean, cotton, sugar cane, tea plant, jasmine, watermelon, mushroom, grapes, dragon fruit, rhubarb.
* Sea: hairtail, shad, pomfret, cuttlefish, garoupa, prawn, crab, clam, mudskippers.
* Other: Yuanhong wine (&quot;元紅&quot;)

==Transportation==
Luochang Expressway runs through Lianjiang&#x27;s section of National Highway 104 in . navigable river length.

Guantou and Kemen (可門) are the largest seaports in Lianjiang with national access.

Lianjiang railway station is serviced by the Wenzhou-Fuzhou railway, preceded by Luoyuan and followed by Fuzhou South.

==Tourism==
There are hot springs in Gui&#x27;an (貴安) and Tanghui (湯尾) of Pandu. There is a Dragon King Palace-Temple (龍宮廟) in the Xiaocang She Ethnic Township.

<doc id="255988" wikidata="Q3927" url="?curid=255988" title="Astrakhan">
<text>Astrakhan (, ) is the largest city and administrative centre of Astrakhan Oblast in southern Russia. The city lies on two banks of the Volga, in the upper part of the Volga Delta, on eleven islands of the Caspian Depression, from the Caspian Sea, with a population of 475,629 residents at the 2021 Census. At an elevation of below sea level, it is the lowest city in Russia. 

Astrakhan was formerly the capital of the Khanate of Astrakhan (a remnant of the Golden Horde) of the Astrakhan Tatars, and was located on the higher right bank of the Volga, from the present-day city. Situated on caravan and water routes, it developed from a village into a large trading centre, before being conquered by Timur in 1395 and captured by Ivan the Terrible in 1556 and in 1558 it was moved to its present site. 

The oldest economic and cultural center of the Lower Volga region, it is often called the southernmost outpost of Russia, and the Caspian capital. The city is a member of the Eurasian Regional Office of the World Organization United Cities and Local Governments. The great ethnic diversity of its population gives a varied character to Astrakhan. The city is the center of the Astrakhan metropolitan area.

==Etymology==
The name is a corruption of Hashtarkhan, itself a corruption of Haji Tarkhan ()—a name amply evidenced in the medieval writings.

==History==
===Medieval history===
Astrakhan is in the Volga Delta, which is rich in sturgeon and exotic plants. The fertile area formerly contained the capitals of Khazaria and the Golden Horde. Astrakhan was first mentioned by travelers in the early 13th century as Xacitarxan. Tamerlane burnt it to the ground in 1395 during his war with the Golden Horde. From 1459 to 1556, Xacitarxan was the capital of Astrakhan Khanate by the Astrakhan Tatars. The ruins of this medieval settlement were found by archaeologists 12 km upstream from the modern-day city.

Starting in A.D. 1324, Ibn Battuta, the famous Berber Muslim traveler, began his pilgrimage from his native city of Tangier, present-day Morocco to Mecca. Along the trek, which took nearly 29 years, Battuta came in contact with many new cultures, which he writes about in his diaries. One specific country that he passed through on his journey was the Golden Horde ruled by the descendants of Genghis Khan, located on the Volga River in southern Russia; which Battuta refers to as the river Athal. He then claims the Athal is, &quot;one of the greatest rivers in the world&quot;. In the winter, the Khan stays in Astrakhan. Due to the cold water, Özbeg Khan ordered the people of Astrakhan to lay many bundles of hay down on the frozen river. He does this to allow the people to travel over the ice. When Battuta and the Khan spoke about Battuta visiting Constantinople, which the Khan granted him permission to do, the Khan then gifted Battuta with fifteen hundred dinars, many horses, and a dress of honor.

In 1556, the khanate was conquered by Ivan the Terrible, who had a new fortress, or kremlin, built on a steep hill overlooking the Volga in 1558. This year is traditionally considered to be the foundation of the modern city.

In 1569, during the Russo-Turkish War, Astrakhan was besieged by the Ottomans, who had to retreat in disarray. A year later, the Ottoman sultan renounced his claims to Astrakhan, thus opening the entire Volga River to Russian traffic. The Ottoman Empire, though militarily defeated, insisted on safe passage for Muslim pilgrims and traders from Central Asia as well as the destruction of the Russian fort on the Terek River. In the 17th century, the city was developed as a Russian gate to the Orient. Many merchants from Armenia, Safavid Persia, Mughal India, and Khivan Khanate settled in the town, giving it a cosmopolitan character.

===Modern history===
For seventeen months in 1670–1671, Astrakhan was held by Stenka Razin and his Cossacks. Early in the following century, Peter the Great constructed a shipyard here and made Astrakhan the base for his hostilities against Persia, and later in the same century Catherine the Great accorded the city important industrial privileges.

The city was held from 1707 by the Cossacks under Kondraty Bulavin during the Bulavin Rebellion until they were defeated the next year. A Kalmuck khan laid an abortive siege to the kremlin several years before that.

In 1717, it became the seat of Astrakhan Governorate, whose first governors included Artemy Petrovich Volynsky and Vasily Nikitich Tatishchev. Six years later, Astrakhan served as a base for the first Russian venture into Central Asia. In 1702, 1718 and 1767, it suffered severely from fires; in 1719 it was plundered by the Safavid Persians; and in 1830, cholera killed much of the populace.

The Astrakhan Kremlin was built from the 1580s to the 1620s from bricks taken from the site of Sarai Berke. Its two impressive cathedrals were consecrated in 1700 and 1710, respectively. Built by masters from Yaroslavl, they retain many traditional features of Russian church architecture, while their exterior decoration is definitely baroque.

In March 1919 after a failed workers&#x27; revolt against Bolshevik rule, 3,000 to 5,000 people were executed in less than a week by the Cheka under orders from Sergey Kirov. Some victims had stones tied around their necks and were thrown into the Volga.

During Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the A-A line running from Astrakhan to Arkhangelsk was to be the eastern limit of German military operation and occupation. The plan was never carried out, as Germany captured neither the two cities nor Moscow. In the autumn of 1942, the region to the west of Astrakhan became one of the easternmost points in the Soviet Union reached by the invading German Wehrmacht, during Case Blue, the offensive which led to the Battle of Stalingrad. Light armored forces of German Army Group A made brief scouting missions as close as 35 km to Astrakhan before withdrawing. In the same period, elements of both the Luftwaffe&#x27;s KG 4 and KG 100 bomber wings attacked Astrakhan, flying several air raids and bombing the city&#x27;s oil terminals and harbor installations.

In 1943, Astrakhan was made the seat of a Soviet oblast within the RSFSR. The oblast was retained as a national province of the independent Russian Federation in the 1991 administrative reshuffle after the dismemberment of the Soviet Union.
In the present day, Astrakhan is a large industrial centre of the Volga country, Russia, with a population of over 500,000. Starting nearly 400 years ago and continuing to the present day, Astrakhan has been Russia&#x27;s main center of fish processing. The market for fish is a large component of the economy in this city.

Owing to shared Caspian borders, Astrakhan recently has been playing a significant role in the relations between Russia and Azerbaijan. As the latter&#x27;s government has been heavily investing into the wellbeing of the city, Astrakhan has recently begun to symbolize the friendship between both countries. In 2010 a bridge was constructed with donations from Azerbaijan, which was named &quot;Bridge of Friendship&quot;. Moreover, Azerbaijani government sponsored secondary school number 11, which carries the name of the national leader Heydar Aliyev, as well as a children&#x27;s entertainment center named &quot;Dream&quot;. Apart from that, a park has been built in the center of Astrakhan which is dedicated to friendship between the two countries. In the last 5 years Astrakhan has been visited by top Azerbaijani delegations on several occasions.

After fraud was alleged in the mayoral election of 2012 and the United Russia candidate was declared the winner, organizers of the 2011–2012 Russian protests supported the defeated candidate, Oleg V. Shein of Just Russia, in a hunger strike. Protestors, buoyed by celebrities who support the reform movement, attracted 5,000 people to a rally on April 14.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Astrakhan is the administrative center of the oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Astrakhan—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Astrakhan is incorporated as Astrakhan Urban Okrug.

The city of Astrakhan is further subdivided into four administrative districts: Kirovsky, Leninsky, Sovetsky and Truskovsky.

==Demographics==
===Religion===

Astrakhan is the archiepiscopal see of one of the metropolitanates and (as Astrakhan and Yenotayevka) eparchies of the Russian Orthodox Church, its only other suffragan being Akhtubinsk. There is also a Catholic community, served by the Church of the Assumption of Mary (Astrakhan). There is also a substantial Muslim population made up of Astrakhan Tatars and other Muslims. At 1777 the white Mosque was built, and the Baku Mosque was built in 1907–1909.

===Population===
According to the results of the 2021 Census, the population of Astrakhan was 475,629.

At the time of the official 2021 Census, the ethnic makeup of the city&#x27;s population was:
==Geography==
The city lies on two banks of the Volga, in the upper part of the Volga Delta, on eleven islands of the Caspian Depression, 60 miles (100 km) from the Caspian Sea. At an elevation of 28 meters (92 ft) below sea level, it is the lowest city in Russia.
===Climate===
Astrakhan features a continental cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSk&quot;) with cold winters and hot summers. Astrakhan is one of the driest cities in Europe. Rainfall is scarce but relatively evenly distributed throughout the course of the year with, however, more precipitation (58%) in the hot season (six hottest months of the year). 

The below sea-level elevation and long distance from the ocean of Astrakhan significantly influences the climate.
Winters are cold with average January temperature -3.6 °С (25.5 °F). Summer temperatures in Astrakhan are one of the highest in Russia with average July temperature 26.1 °С (79 °F) and may reach 40 °С (104 °F) and higher. The summers are much hotter than found further west on similar latitude in Europe and worldwide for 46°N with the notable exception of the interior Pacific Northwest of the United States. The mean annual temperature amplitude (difference between the mean monthly temperatures of the hottest and coldest months) is thus equal to 29.7 °С (85.5 °F) so the climate is truly continental. Spring and fall are basically transitional seasons between summer and winter. 
==Education==
Astrakhan has five institutions of higher education. Most prominent among these are Astrakhan State Technical University and Astrakhan State University.
==Transportation==

The city is served by Narimanovo Airport named after Soviet Azerbaijani politician Nariman Narimanov. It is managed by OAO Aeroport Astrakhan. After its reconstruction and the building of the international sector, opened in February 2011, Narimanovo Airport is one of the most modern regional airports in Russia. There are direct flights between Astrakhan and Aktau, Istanbul, St. Petersburg and Moscow.

There is also a military airbase nearby (Astrakhan (air base)). 

Astrakhan is linked by rail to the north (Volgograd and Moscow), the east (Atyrau and Kazakhstan) and the south (Makhachkala and Baku). There are direct trains to Moscow, Volgograd, Saint Petersburg, Baku, Kyiv, Brest and other towns. Intercity and international buses are available as well. Public local transport is mainly provided by buses and minibuses called &quot;marshrutkas&quot;. Until 2007 there were also trams, and until 2017 trolleybuses.

<doc id="255989" wikidata="Q1627169" url="?curid=255989" title="Honne and tatemae">
<text>In Japan, honne and tatemae are Japanese terms relating to a person&#x27;s feelings and outward behaviors. &#x27; refers to a person&#x27;s , and &#x27; refers contrastingly to . This distinction began to be made in the post-war era.

A person&#x27;s may be contrary to what is expected by society or what is required according to one&#x27;s position and circumstances, and they are often kept hidden, except with one&#x27;s closest friends. is what is expected by society and required according to one&#x27;s position and circumstances, and these may or may not match one&#x27;s . In many cases, leads to outright telling of lies in order to avoid exposing the true inward feelings. In English speaking countries they are telling “white lies.”

==Causes==
In Japanese culture, public failure and the disapproval of others are seen as particular sources of shame and reduced social standing, so it is common to avoid direct confrontation or disagreement in most social contexts. Traditionally, social norms dictate that one should attempt to minimize discord; failure to do so might be seen as insulting or aggressive. For this reason, the Japanese tend to go to great lengths to avoid conflict, especially within the context of large groups. By upholding this social norm, one is socially protected from such transgressions by others.

The conflict between and (social obligations) is one of the main topics of Japanese drama throughout the ages. For example, the protagonist would have to choose between carrying out his obligations to his family/feudal lord or pursuing a clandestine love affair.

==Effects==
Contemporary phenomena such as seclusion and parasite singles are seen as examples of late Japanese culture&#x27;s growing problem of the new generation growing up unable to deal with the complexities of and pressure of an increasingly consumerist society.

Though and are not a uniquely Japanese phenomenon, some Japanese people feel that it is unique to Japan, especially those who feel their culture is unique in having the concepts of &quot;private mind&quot; and &quot;public mind&quot;. Although there might not be direct single word translations for and in some languages, they do have two-word descriptions; for example in English, &quot;private mind&quot; and &quot;public mind&quot;.

A similar discord between one&#x27;s true feeling and public appearance is observed in , a phrase whose meaning literally translates as &quot;starving to [one&#x27;s] skeleton&quot;, referring to being content or pretending to be so. Nowadays, the phrase is used for two different meanings, expressing the samurai virtue of self-discipline, silent moral heroism, or ridiculing stubbornness, face-savingness.

== Criticisms ==
Many scholars assert that &quot;honne–tatemae&quot; is a concept integral to understanding Japanese culture, such as Professor Takeo Doi, who considered the &quot;honne–tatemae&quot; divide to be of paramount importance in Japanese culture as well as other researchers like Ozaki, who utilized the concept to study Japanese perceptions of class and status. Despite this, there remain criticisms regarding the concept&#x27;s uniqueness to Japan, as many argue that the concept is widespread rather than distinct to Japan.

Research has shown that many Japanese view the concept as unique and culturally significant. One study found that while foreign students&#x27; perceptions regarding examples of &quot;honne–tatemae&quot; were rather nuanced, Japanese students would often limit perspectives and reinforce stereotypes according to more rigid cultural prescriptions of the concept.

Some researchers suggest that the need for explicit words for &quot;tatemae&quot; and &quot;honne&quot; in Japanese culture is evidence that the concept is relatively new to Japan, whereas the unspoken understanding in many other cultures indicates a deeper internalization of the concepts. In any case, all cultures have conventions that help to determine appropriate communication and behavior in various social contexts which are implicitly understood without an explicit name for the social mores on which the conventions are based.

Hence other researchers have argued that this kind of dualism, separation of one&#x27;s true feelings and what they present outwardly, is not culturally specific, one scholar even suggests that the concepts &quot;honne&quot; and &quot;tatemae&quot; may have originally stemmed from Chinese concepts of &quot;Yang&quot; and &quot;Yin&quot;. Evidently similar concepts of &quot;face&quot; (as in &quot;saving face&quot;) have been observed in several different societies and cultures.

<text>Peter Morland Churchill, Croix de Guerre (1909 – 1972) was a British Special Operations Executive (SOE) officer in France during the Second World War. His wartime operations, which resulted in his capture and imprisonment in German concentration camps and his subsequent marriage to fellow SOE officer Odette Sansom, received considerable attention after the war, including a 1950 film.

On 29th December 2024 he was inducted into the Spengler Cup Ice Hockey Hall of Fame in Davos, Switzerland, in recognition of his exceptional ice hockey playing in the 1930’s and will be represented in the ice hockey museum there.

== Early life ==
He was born in Amsterdam on 14 January 1909, the son of William Algernon Churchill (1865–1947), a British Consul who served in Mozambique, Amsterdam, Pará in Brazil, Stockholm, Milan, Palermo, and Algiers. His father was also an art connoisseur, and author of what is still the standard reference work on early European paper and papermaking, &quot;Watermarks in Paper&quot;, and Violet (née Myers). He was a brother of Walter Churchill DSO DFC, a Royal Air Force pilot during the war, and Oliver Churchill DSO MC, also an SOE officer.

==Education and career==
He was educated at Malvern School from 1923–27, then spent 18 months at Chillon Castle, then went on to Geneva University. From 1929–32, he read Modern Languages at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. In addition to his native English, he was bilingual in French and fluent in Spanish and Italian.
He also excelled in sports – he had the reputation of being one of the finest ice-hockey blues the university had produced. Churchill was Captain of the Cambridge University Ice Hockey Club in 1932 and won 15 international caps. He was proficient at exhibition diving, a first-class skier, and played golf off a six handicap.

He moved into the British diplomatic service and served as British Vice-Consul in the Netherlands from 1934–5, and Pro-Consul in Oran, Algeria from 1935–6. From September 1939 to August 1940, he was Under Secretary to Sir Norman Birkett in the Home Office Advisory Committee, and later became President of the Committee.

==Wartime activities==
At the outbreak of the Second World War, he was commissioned into the Intelligence Corps and also underwent commando training. In April 1941, joined the Special Operations Executive as one of its early recruits and assigned to the French Section in June 1941.
He was infiltrated into France four times, twice by submarine and twice by aircraft, and spent 225 days behind enemy lines.

=== First mission ===
In Operation WILLOW, his mission was to inspect three SOE networks in the south of France, evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, assess their needs, and give them instructions. He was also given two million francs (equivalent to approximately £480,000 / €500,000 in 2019) to distribute between the three networks, with 400,000 francs for Francis Basin «Laurent» of the URCHIN network in Antibes, 300,000 francs for Georges Duboudin «Charles» of the SPRUCE network in Lyon, and 300,000 francs for Ted Coppin «Olivier» of the DONKEYMAN network in Marseille. The other million francs was destined for Colonel Deprez in Marseille to facilitate the release of 10 French patriots from Fort St Nicholas prison in Marseille.

On 1 January 1942, submarine P36 took him 2 miles offshore Miramar (Théoule-sur-Mer) from where he rowed to the shore by canoe at night. The next morning he walked 25 km to Antibes where he met his first contact, Dr Élie Lévy «Louis», who introduced him to Baron d&#x27;Astier de la Vigerie «Bernard», head of Lyon resistance group known as ‘The Last Column’.

Using false identity papers of an Argentinian journalist, he then travelled by train with «Bernard» to Lyon to meet Virginia Hall «Germaine», an American agent, who put him in contact with Duboudin. He then went by train to Marseille where Hall introduced him to Ted Coppin and Colonel Deprez.

Having completed his mission, Churchill returned to the UK. Travelling as a couple to reduce suspicion, Hall accompanied him on a train to Perpignan, and with a guide he crossed the Pyrenees overnight on foot and walked about 80 km to Bañolas near Figueras. He was then driven to Gibraltar, crossing the Spanish border hidden in the car’s boot, and on 14 February 1943 was flown back to London for debriefing.

=== Second mission ===

Operation DELAY II was a brief mission to deliver four SOE agents by submarine to the French Riviera.

In April 1942, Churchill travelled from Gibraltar in HM Submarine P 42 &quot;Unbroken&quot; with three radio operators, Isidore Newman «Julien» for the URCHIN network and Edward Zeff «Matthieu» for the SPRUCE network, Marcel Clech «Bastien» for the AUTOGIRO network, and Victor Gerson «René», an SOE agent on a special mission to organise the VIC Escape Line On the night of 21 April, Churchill led Newman and Zeff by canoe to the shore at Antibes with their radios and took them to the house of Dr Élie Lévy, who asked him to take «Bernard» back with him to the UK. Churchill returned to the submarine with «Bernard», after which Clech and Gerson were dropped off by canoe at the Pointe d’Agay and Churchill returned to the UK.

====Proposed next mission====
On his return Col Buckmaster gave Churchill his next mission which was to blow up a powerful radio transmitter at Sainte-Assise near Fontainebleau which the Nazis were using to direct their U-boat campaign, and was so powerful that the U-boats could pick up its messages without having to surface. He was to be accompanied by &#x27;The Twins&#x27; (SOE agents Alfred and Henry Newton) but, just as they were about to undertake the mission, a failed attempt by a French agent resulted in significantly increased security and Churchill’s mission was called off.

===Third mission===
His third mission was to organise and coordinate the SOE F Section &quot;Spindle&quot; Network in Cannes which directed the delivery of supplies to support the CARTE Organisation run by André Girard.

On 27 August 1942, he was parachuted near Montpellier and went to Cannes where he learned that Francis Basin had just been arrested. Churchill planned to rescue him when he was being transferred by train to Lyon but this attempt was called off, apparently at Basin’s request.

Among his couriers was Odette Sansom «Lise», with whom he was to develop a close relationship and subsequently marry after the war. Adolphe Rabinovitch «Arnaud» was his wireless operator. Churchill arranged an arms drop for General de Lattre de Tassigny, Commander of one of the sole French Divisions still in existence, based in Montpellier, and another for the Maquis des Glières, who operated near Lake Annecy in Haute-Savoie.

Several attempts were made to fly him back to the UK to report on his activities. The first attempt was for a Hudson bomber to land at Vinon near Aix-en-Provence to collect Churchill, Giraud and five French generals, however the terrain had not been surveyed properly by the French resistance and the runway proved inadequate, so Churchill aborted the landing.

Returning to Cannes, Churchill was informed that two police inspectors had called at his accommodation searching for him, and he had to change lodgings immediately. On 8 November 1942 Hitler ordered the occupation of Vichy France and as a result of increased security activities in Cannes, Giraud moved his CARTE operations to Arles.

In November 1942, a CARTE courier, André Marsac, was arrested in Paris by Abwehr intelligence officer Hugo Bleicher and his interrogation in Fresnes prison led to the arrest of another CARTE member, Roger Bardet. Bardet was interrogated in Fresnes, became a double agent, and released. From information provided by Marsac and Bardet, Bleicher came to know all about the SPINDLE network, including the names of Churchill and Sansom, and believed Marsac’s false claim that Churchill was related to Winston Churchill.

A second attempt from Arles in late December 1942 was unsuccessful due to the heavy presence of German soldiers.

In January 1943, Girard was dismissed as head of the CARTE Organisation, and Henri Frager «Paul» and André Marsac «End» were made Joint Commanders. The third attempt was on a small abandoned airfield near Tournus between Mâcon and Chalon-sur-Saône in January 1943 to collect Churchill and take Frager to London to clear up the confusion over the CARTE question and have a definite ruling on the matter from HQ. The Germans had obstructed the planned landing strip to prevent a landing and these obstacles had to be cleared quickly. The Hudson bomber collected 10 men, but it turned out that some of De Gaulle’s agents had planned this landing at the same time, and Churchill and Frager were not collected.

Churchill and Sansom returned to Cannes for the last time, and he arranged a further attempt for a Lysander to land near Périgueux. This entailed a journey of over 800 kilometres through German occupied France, changing trains at Marseille and Toulouse. The landing had to be aborted when it was realised that the Germans were lying in wait, and Churchill, Frager, Sansom and the others escaped on foot, narrowly missing capture.

Churchill and Sampson left Périgueux by train for Toulouse where they were provided accommodation in a safe house and informed that all passengers on an earlier train from Périgueux had been met by the Gestapo and questioned, and that his flat in Cannes has been raided and people arrested. He decided it was too dangerous to remain in Cannes and relocated the SPINDLE network to Saint-Jorioz on Lake Annecy in Haute-Savoie, and changed his cover name.

A further attempt was made to land a Lysander at Tournus north of Lyon, but the aircraft did not arrive. On 22/23 March 1943, a Lysander piloted by Hugh Verity landed at Estrées-Saint-Denis near Compiègne exfiltrated Churchill and Frager, while bringing Francis Cammaerts «Roger» to take over the SPINDLE network in his absence.

=== Fourth infiltration ===
On 14/15 April 1943, he returned by parachute onto the mountains above Saint-Jorioz where he was met by Sansom, and they stayed in the Hotel de la Poste in Saint-Jorioz.

===Arrest and imprisonment===
Later that morning Bleicher arrested Churchill and Sansom in their hotel. He claimed he was related to Winston Churchill and that they were a married couple to make themselves seem more valuable prisoners and less likely to be executed as spies.
They were sent to Fresnes Prison and then different concentration camps where each was sentenced to death, but both escaped execution, unlike the majority of captured SOE agents. Odette endured terrible torture but revealed nothing to her captors.

Churchill was initially taken under Italian custody to the barracks in Annecy, where he was badly beaten after an unsuccessful escape attempt during which he assaulted an Italian guard. He was then transferred to German custody and moved to Fresnes Prison near Paris where he was questioned by Bleicher, who believed Marsac’s false claim that Churchill was a nephew of the British Prime Minister and discussed a prisoner swap with Rudolf Hess.

On 13 February 1944, he was transferred to Berlin for questioning, and on 2 May sent to Sonderlager “A” Sachsenhausen, where he was held in solitary confinement for 10½ months.

On 1 April 1945, he was moved by train to Flossenbürg, 50 miles south-east of Bayreuth, where he was held for 3–4 days before being taken by truck on a 30-hour trip to Dachau where, rather than being taken to the notorious concentration camp, he was lodged in a former brothel along with 30 other officers. As an officer he was given better treatment than most of the 22,000 inmates of Flossenbürg, who were forcibly evacuated on the 200 km death march to Dachau concentration camp, during which one third died. The next day, as the Americans were approaching Dachau, he and 30 other officers were taken by bus to Innsbruck, where he was held in the Straflager. They were joined by over 100 other Prominenten (notable prisoners), including former heads of state and high-ranking military personnel.

On 24 April, Churchill was taken from Dachau over the Brenner Pass to Villabassa (Niederdorf in the Tyrol), together with many other prominent concentration camp inmates from different countries, where the SS left the prisoners behind as American forces were approaching.
On 27 April, he was taken 15 miles to the south to Pragser Wildsee, where on 4 May he was liberated by the Fifth United States Army. He was taken to Naples for debriefing by officers from the Crimes Investigations Departments and testified against his former captors, and on 12 May was flown back to England in the private plane of Air-Marshall Garrow.

===Post-war===
Peter Churchill and Odette Sansom married in 1947. In the 1950 film &quot;Odette&quot;, which recounted their wartime exploits, Anna Neagle played the title role and Churchill was played by Trevor Howard.

He wrote three books about his exploits in SOE, and a further fictitious book about the French resistance movement in Haute Savoie.

Some years after the war Peter and Odette Churchill met up with Hugo Bleicher, after inviting him to the UK.

Peter and Odette divorced in 1956, and the following year he married Australian Irene Hoyle, a former model, in Nice. He continued to live in France after the war, settling in Le Rouret near Cannes, where he worked in real estate, and lived there until his death on 1 May 1972.

==Legacy==

Peter&#x27;s brother, Walter, relocated his engineering business, JJ Churchill, from Coventry to Market Bosworth during the war. After the Market Bosworth Historical Society became aware of the wartime gallantry of not just Walter, but also of his brothers Peter and Oliver, it decided to fund a Memorial Cairn. The granite Cairn is located in front of the JJ Churchill factory, and was unveiled in autumn 2015.

Three of the four sides commemorate each of the Churchill brothers, while the fourth side commemorates the factory’s relocation from Coventry to Market Bosworth and Walter landing his Hurricane in the field opposite while overseeing the factory’s move.

<text>A narrative, story, or tale is any account of a series of related events or experiences, whether non-fictional (memoir, biography, news report, documentary, travelogue, etc.) or fictional (fairy tale, fable, legend, thriller, novel, etc.). Narratives can be presented through a sequence of written or spoken words, through still or moving images, or through any combination of these. The word derives from the Latin verb &quot;narrare&quot; (&quot;to tell&quot;), which is derived from the adjective &quot;gnarus&quot; (&quot;knowing or skilled&quot;). The formal and literary process of constructing a narrative—narration—is one of the four traditional rhetorical modes of discourse, along with argumentation, description, and exposition. This is a somewhat distinct usage from narration in the narrower sense of a commentary used to convey a story. Many additional narrative techniques, particularly literary ones, are used to build and enhance any given story.

The social and cultural activity of sharing narratives is called storytelling, and its earliest form is 
oral storytelling. During most people&#x27;s childhoods, these narratives are used to guide them on proper behavior, history, formation of a communal identity, and values from their cultural standpoint, as studied explicitly in anthropology today among traditional indigenous peoples. With regard to oral tradition, narratives consist of everyday speech where the performer has the licence to recontextualise the story to a particular audience, often to a younger generation, and are contrasted with epics which consist of formal speech and are usually learned word for word.

Narrative is found in all mediums of human creativity, art, and entertainment, including speech, literature, theatre, music and song, comics, journalism, film, television, animation and video, video games, radio, game-play, unstructured recreation, and performance in general, as well as some painting, sculpture, drawing, photography, and other visual arts, as long as a sequence of events is presented. Several art movements, such as modern art, refuse the narrative in favor of the abstract and conceptual.

Narrative can be organized into a number of thematic or formal categories: nonfiction (such as creative nonfiction, biography, journalism, transcript poetry, and historiography); fictionalization of historical events (such as anecdote, myth, legend, and historical fiction) and fiction proper (such as literature in the form of prose and sometimes poetry, short stories, novels, narrative poems and songs, and imaginary narratives as portrayed in other textual forms, games, or live or recorded performances). Narratives may also be nested within other narratives, such as narratives told by an unreliable narrator (a character) typically found in the genre of noir fiction. An important part of many narratives is its narrative mode, the set of methods used to communicate the narrative through a written or spoken commentary (see also &quot;Aesthetics approach&quot; below).

==Overview==
A narrative is a telling of some actual or fictitious event or connected sequence of events, sometimes recounted by a narrator to an audience (although there may be more than one of each). A personal narrative is a prose narrative relating personal experience. Narratives are to be distinguished from descriptions of qualities, states, or situations and also from dramatic enactments of events (although a dramatic work may also include narrative speeches). A narrative consists of a set of events (the story) recounted in the process of narration (or discourse), in which the events are selected and arranged in a particular order (the plot, which can also mean &quot;story synopsis&quot;). The term &quot;emplotment&quot; describes how, when making sense of personal experience, authors or other storytellers structure and order narratives. The category of narratives includes both the shortest accounts of events (for example, &quot;the cat sat on the mat&quot; or a brief news item) and the most extended historical or biographical works, diaries, travelogues, and so forth, as well as novels, ballads, epics, short stories, and other fictional forms. In the study of fiction, it is usual to divide novels and shorter stories into first-person and third-person narratives. As an adjective, &quot;narrative&quot; means &quot;characterized by or relating to storytelling&quot;; thus, &quot;narrative technique&quot; is any of the methods used for telling stories, and &quot;narrative poetry&quot; is the class of poems (including ballads, epics, and verse romances) that tell stories, as distinct from dramatic and lyric poetry. Some theorists of narratology have attempted to isolate the quality or set of properties that distinguishes narrative from non-narrative writings; this is called narrativity.

== Elements ==
Certain basic elements are necessary and sufficient to define all works of narrative, including, most well-studied, all narrative works of fiction. Thus, the following essential elements of narrative are also often referred to as the elements of fiction.

=== Character ===

Characters are the individual persons inside a work of narrative; their choices and behaviors propel the plot forward. They typically are named humans whose actions and speech sometimes convey important motives. They may be entirely imaginary, or they may have a basis in real-life individuals. The audience&#x27;s first impressions are influential on how they perceive a character, for example whether they empathize with a character or not, feeling for them as if they were real. The audience&#x27;s familiarity with a character results in their expectations about how characters will behave in later scenes. Characters who behave contrary to their previous patterns of behavior (their characterization) can be confusing or jarring to the audience. Narratives usually have main characters, protagonists, whom the story revolves around, who encounter a central conflict, or who gain knowledge or grow significantly across the story. Some stories may also have antagonists, characters who oppose, hinder, or fight against the protagonist. In many traditional narratives, the protagonist is specifically a hero: a sympathetic person who battles (often literally) for morally good causes. The hero may face a villain: an antagonist who fights against morally good causes or even actively perpetrates evil. Many other ways of classifying characters exist too.

=== Conflict ===

Broadly speaking, conflict is any tension that drives the thoughts and actions of characters. Narrowly speaking, the conflict is the major problem a protagonist, or main character, encounters across a story. Often, a protagonist additionally struggles with a sense of anxiety, insecurity, indecisiveness, or other mental difficulty as result of this conflict, which can be regarded as a secondary or &quot;internal&quot; conflict. Longer works of narrative typically involve many conflicts, or smaller-level conflicts that occur alongside the main one. Conflict can be classified into a variety of types, with some common ones being: character versus character, character versus nature, character versus society, character versus unavoidable circumstances, and character versus self. If the conflict is brought to an end towards the end of the story, this is known as resolution.

=== Narrative mode ===

The narrative mode is the set of choices and techniques the author or creator selects in framing their story: &quot;how&quot; the narrative is told. It includes the scope of information presented or withheld, the type or style of language used, the channel or medium through which the story is presented, the way and extent to which narrative exposition and other types of commentary are communicated, and the overall point of view or perspective. An example of narrative perspective is a first-person narrative, in which some character (often the main one) refers openly to the self, using pronouns like &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot;, in communicating the story to the audience. Contrarily, in a third-person narrative, such pronouns are avoided in the telling of the story, perhaps because the teller is merely an impersonal written commentary of the story rather than a personal character within it. Both of these explicit tellings of a narrative through a spoken or written commentary are examples of a technique called narration, which is required only in &quot;written&quot; narratives but optional in other types. Though narration is a narrower term, it is occasionally used as a synonym for narrative mode in a very broad sense.

=== Plot ===

The plot is the sequence of events that occurs in a narrative from the beginning to the middle to the end. It typically occurs through a process of cause and effect, in which characters&#x27; actions or other events produce reactions that allow the story to progress. Put another way, plot is structured through a series of scenes in which related events occur that lead to subsequent scenes. These events form plot points, moments of change that affect the characters&#x27; understandings, decisions, and actions. The movement of the plot forward often corresponds to protagonists encountering or realizing the conflict, and then working to resolve it, creating emotional stakes for the characters as well as the audience. (The audience&#x27;s anxious feeling of anticipation due to high emotional stakes is called suspense.)

=== Setting ===

The setting is the time, place, and context in which a story takes place. It includes the physical and temporal surroundings that the characters inhabit and can also include the social or cultural conventions that affect characters. Sometimes, the setting may resemble a character in the sense that it has specific traits, undergoes actions that affect the plot, and develops over the course of the story.

=== Theme ===

Themes are the major underlying ideas presented by a story, generally left open to the audience&#x27;s own interpretation. Themes are more abstract than other elements and are subjective: open to discussion by the audience who, by the story&#x27;s end, can argue about which big ideas or messages were explored, what conclusions can be drawn, and which ones the work&#x27;s creator intended. Thus, the audience may come to different conclusions about a work&#x27;s themes than what the creator intended or regardless of what the creator intended. They can also develop new ideas about its themes as the work progresses.

==History==
In India, archaeological evidence of the presence of stories is found at the Indus valley civilization site, Lothal. On one large vessel, the artist depicts birds with fish in their beaks resting in a tree, while a fox-like animal stands below. This scene bears resemblance to the story of &quot;The Fox and the Crow&quot; in the Panchatantra. On a miniature jar, the story of the thirsty crow and deer is depicted, of how the deer could not drink from the narrow mouth of the jar, while the crow succeeded by dropping stones into the jar. The features of the animals are clear and graceful.

==Human nature==
Owen Flanagan of Duke University, a leading consciousness researcher, writes, &quot;Evidence strongly suggests that humans in all cultures come to cast their own identity in some sort of narrative form. We are inveterate storytellers.&quot; Stories are an important aspect of culture. Many works of art and most works of literature tell stories; indeed, most of the humanities involve stories.
Stories are of ancient origin, existing in ancient Egyptian, ancient Greek, Chinese, and Indian cultures and their myths. Stories are also a ubiquitous component of human communication, used as parables and examples to illustrate points. Storytelling was probably one of the earliest forms of entertainment. As noted by Owen Flanagan, narrative may also refer to psychological processes in self-identity, memory, and meaning-making.

Semiotics begins with the individual building blocks of meaning called signs; semantics is the way in which signs are combined into codes to transmit messages. This is part of a general communication system using both verbal and non-verbal elements, and creating a discourse with different modalities and forms.

In &quot;On Realism in Art&quot;, Roman Jakobson attests that literature exists as a separate entity. He and many other semioticians prefer the view that all texts, whether spoken or written, are the same, except that some authors encode their texts with distinctive &quot;literary&quot; qualities that distinguish them from other forms of discourse. Nevertheless, there is a clear trend to address literary narrative forms as separable from other forms. This is first seen in Russian Formalism through Victor Shklovsky&#x27;s analysis of the relationship between composition and style, and in the work of Vladimir Propp, who analyzed the plots used in traditional folk-tales and identified 31 distinct functional components. This trend (or these trends) continued in the work of the Prague School and of French scholars such as Claude Lévi-Strauss and Roland Barthes. It leads to a structural analysis of narrative and an increasingly influential body of modern work that raises important theoretical questions:
* What is &quot;text?&quot;
* What is its role (culture)?
* How is it manifested as art, cinema, theater, or literature?
* Why is narrative divided into different genres, such as poetry, short stories, and novels?

==Literary theory==
In literary theoretic approach, narrative is being narrowly defined as fiction-writing mode in which the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. Until the late 19th century, literary criticism as an academic exercise dealt solely with poetry (including epic poems like the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Paradise Lost,&quot; and poetic drama like Shakespeare). Most poems did not have a narrator distinct from the author.

But novels, lending a number of voices to several characters in addition to narrator&#x27;s, created a possibility of narrator&#x27;s views differing significantly from the author&#x27;s views. With the rise of the novel in the 18th century, the concept of the narrator (as opposed to &quot;author&quot;) made the question of narrator a prominent one for literary theory. It has been proposed that perspective and interpretive knowledge are the essential characteristics, while focalization and structure are lateral characteristics of the narrator.

The role of literary theory in narrative has been disputed; with some interpretations like Todorov&#x27;s narrative model that views all narratives in a cyclical manner, and that each narrative is characterized by a three part structure that allows the narrative to progress. The beginning stage being an establishment of equilibrium—a state of non conflict, followed by a disruption to this state, caused by an external event, and lastly a restoration or a return to equilibrium—a conclusion that brings the narrative back to a similar space before the events of the narrative unfolded.

The school of literary criticism known as Russian formalism has applied methods that are more often used to analyse narrative fiction, to non-fictional texts such as political speeches.

Other critiques of literary theory in narrative challenge the very role of literariness in narrative, as well as the role of narrative in literature. Meaning, narratives, and their associated aesthetics, emotions, and values have the ability to operate without the presence of literature, and vice versa. According to Didier Costa, the structural model used by Todorov and others is unfairly biased toward a Western interpretation of narrative, and that a more comprehensive and transformative model must be created in order to properly analyze narrative discourse in literature. Framing also plays a pivotal role in narrative structure; an analysis of the historical and cultural contexts present during the development of a narrative is needed in order to more accurately represent the role of narratology in societies that relied heavily on oral narratives.

==Aesthetics approach==
Narrative is a highly aesthetic art. Thoughtfully composed stories have a number of aesthetic elements. Such elements include the idea of narrative structure, with identifiable beginnings, middles, and ends, or the process of exposition-development-climax-denouement, with coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality including retention of the past, attention to present action, and future anticipation; a substantial focus on character and characterization, &quot;arguably the most important single component of the novel&quot; (David Lodge &quot;The Art of Fiction&quot; 67); different voices interacting, &quot;the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms, and registers&quot; (Lodge &quot;The Art of Fiction&quot; 97; see also the theory of Mikhail Bakhtin for expansion of this idea); a narrator or narrator-like voice, which &quot;addresses&quot; and &quot;interacts with&quot; reading audiences (see Reader Response theory); communicates with a Wayne Booth-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, forming a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, &quot;arguing&quot; for and against various positions; relies substantially on the use of literary tropes (see Hayden White, &quot;Metahistory&quot; for expansion of this idea); is often intertextual with other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;, a description of identity development with an effort to evince &quot;becoming&quot; in character and community.

==Psychological approach==

Within philosophy of mind, the social sciences, and various clinical fields including medicine, narrative can refer to aspects of human psychology. A personal narrative process is involved in a person&#x27;s sense of personal or cultural identity, and in the creation and construction of memories; it is thought by some to be the fundamental nature of the self. The breakdown of a coherent or positive narrative has been implicated in the development of psychosis and mental disorders, and its repair said to play an important role in journeys of recovery. Narrative therapy is a form of psychotherapy.

Illness narratives are a way for a person affected by an illness to make sense of his or her experiences. They typically follow one of several set patterns: &quot;restitution&quot;, &quot;chaos&quot;, or &quot;quest&quot; narratives. In the narrative, the person sees the illness as a temporary detour. The primary goal is to return permanently to normal life and normal health. These may also be called cure narratives. In the chaos narrative, the person sees the illness as a permanent state that will inexorably get worse, with no redeeming virtues. This is typical of diseases like Alzheimer&#x27;s disease: the patient gets worse and worse, and there is no hope of returning to normal life. The third major type, the &quot;quest narrative&quot;, positions the illness experience as an opportunity to transform oneself into a better person through overcoming adversity and re-learning what is most important in life; the physical outcome of the illness is less important than the spiritual and psychological transformation. This is typical of the triumphant view of cancer survivorship in the breast cancer culture. Survivors may be expected to articulate a &quot;wisdom narrative&quot;, in which they explain to others a new and better view of the meaning of life.

Personality traits, more specifically the Big Five personality traits, appear to be associated with the type of language or patterns of word use found in an individual&#x27;s self-narrative. In other words, language use in self-narratives accurately reflects human personality. The linguistic correlates of each Big Five trait are as follows:
* Extraversion - positively correlated with words referring to humans, social processes, and family;
* Agreeableness - positively correlated with family, inclusiveness, and certainty; negatively correlated with anger and body (that is, few negative comments about health or body);
* Conscientiousness - positively correlated with achievement and work; negatively related to body, death, anger, and exclusiveness;
* Neuroticism - positively correlated with sadness, negative emotion, body, anger, home, and anxiety; negatively correlated with work;
* Openness - positively correlated with perceptual processes, hearing, and exclusiveness

==Social-sciences approaches==

Human beings often claim to understand events when they manage to formulate a coherent story or narrative explaining how they believe the event was generated. Narratives thus lie at the foundations of our cognitive procedures and also provide an explanatory framework for the social sciences, particularly when it is difficult to assemble enough cases to permit statistical analysis. Narrative is often used in case study research in the social sciences. Here it has been found that the dense, contextual, and interpenetrating nature of social forces uncovered by detailed narratives is often more interesting and useful for both social theory and social policy than other forms of social inquiry. Research using narrative methods in the social sciences has been described as still being in its infancy but this perspective has several advantages such as access to an existing, rich vocabulary of analytical terms: plot, genre, subtext, epic, hero/heroine, story arc (e.g., beginning–middle–end), and so on. Another benefit is it emphasizes that even apparently non-fictional documents (speeches, policies, legislation) are still fictions, in the sense they are authored and usually have an intended audience in mind.

Sociologists Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein have contributed to the formation of a constructionist approach to narrative in sociology. From their book The Self We Live By: Narrative Identity in a Postmodern World (2000), to more recent texts such as Analyzing Narrative Reality (2009) and Varieties of Narrative Analysis (2012), they have developed an analytic framework for researching stories and storytelling that is centered on the interplay of institutional discourses (big stories) on the one hand, and everyday accounts (little stories) on the other. The goal is the sociological understanding of formal and lived texts of experience, featuring the production, practices, and communication of accounts.

===Inquiry approach===
In order to avoid &quot;hardened stories&quot;, or &quot;narratives that become context-free, portable, and ready to be used anywhere and anytime for illustrative purposes&quot; and are being used as conceptual metaphors as defined by linguist George Lakoff, an approach called narrative inquiry was proposed, resting on the epistemological assumption that human beings make sense of random or complex multicausal experience by the imposition of story structures. Human propensity to simplify data through a predilection for narratives over complex data sets can lead to the narrative fallacy. It is easier for the human mind to remember and make decisions on the basis of stories with meaning, than to remember strings of data. This is one reason why narratives are so powerful and why many of the classics in the humanities and social sciences are written in the narrative format. But humans can read meaning into data and compose stories, even where this is unwarranted. Some scholars suggest that the narrative fallacy and other biases can be avoided by applying standard methodical checks for validity (statistics) and reliability (statistics) in terms of how data (narratives) are collected, analyzed, and presented. More typically, scholars working with narrative prefer to use other evaluative criteria (such as believability or perhaps interpretive validity) since they do not see statistical validity as meaningfully applicable to qualitative data: &quot;the concepts of validity and reliability, as understood from the positivist perspective, are somehow inappropriate and inadequate when applied to interpretive research&quot;. Several criteria for assessing the validity of narrative research was proposed, including the objective aspect, the emotional aspect, the social/moral aspect, and the clarity of the story.

===Mathematical-sociology approach===
In mathematical sociology, the theory of comparative narratives was devised in order to describe and compare the structures (expressed as &quot;and&quot; in a directed graph where multiple causal links incident into a node are conjoined) of action-driven sequential events.

Narratives so conceived comprise the following ingredients:
* A finite set of state descriptions of the world S, the components of which are weakly ordered in time;
* A finite set of actors/agents (individual or collective), P;
* A finite set of actions A;
* A mapping of P onto A;

The structure (directed graph) is generated by letting the nodes stand for the states and the directed edges represent how the states are changed by specified actions. The action skeleton can then be abstracted, comprising a further digraph where the actions are depicted as nodes and edges take the form &quot;action a co-determined (in context of other actions) action b&quot;.

Narratives can be both abstracted and generalised by imposing an algebra upon their structures and thence defining homomorphism between the algebras. The insertion of action-driven causal links in a narrative can be achieved using the method of Bayesian narratives.

====Bayesian narratives====
Developed by Peter Abell, the theory of Bayesian Narratives conceives a narrative as a directed graph comprising multiple causal links (social interactions) of the general form: &quot;action a causes action b in a specified context&quot;. In the absence of sufficient comparative cases to enable statistical treatment of the causal links, items of evidence in support and against a particular causal link are assembled and used to compute the Bayesian likelihood ratio of the link. Subjective causal statements of the form &quot;I did b because of a&quot; and subjective counterfactuals &quot;if it had not been for a I would not have done b&quot; are notable items of evidence.

==In music==
Linearity is one of several narrative qualities that can be found in a musical composition. As noted by American musicologist Edward Cone, narrative terms are also present in the analytical language about music. The different components of a fugue — subject, answer, exposition, discussion, and summary — can be cited as an example. However, there are several views on the concept of narrative in music and the role it plays.
One theory is that of Theodore Adorno, who has suggested that &quot;music recites itself, is its own context, narrates without narrative&quot;. Another, is that of Carolyn Abbate, who has suggested that &quot;certain gestures experienced in music constitute a narrating voice&quot;. Still others have argued that narrative is a semiotic enterprise that can enrich musical analysis.
The French musicologist Jean-Jacques Nattiez contends that &quot;the narrative, strictly speaking, is not in the music, but in the plot imagined and constructed by the listeners&quot;. He argues that discussing music in terms of narrativity is simply metaphorical and that the &quot;imagined plot&quot; may be influenced by the work&#x27;s title or other programmatic information provided by the composer. However, Abbate has revealed numerous examples of musical devices that function as narrative voices, by limiting music&#x27;s ability to narrate to rare &quot;moments that can be identified by their bizarre and disruptive effect&quot;. Various theorists share this view of narrative appearing in disruptive rather than normative moments in music.
The final word is yet to be said regarding narratives in music, as there is still much to be determined.

==In film==
Unlike most forms of narratives that are inherently language based (whether that be narratives presented in literature or orally), film narratives face additional challenges in creating a cohesive narrative. Whereas the general assumption in literary theory is that a narrator must be present in order to develop a narrative, as Schmid proposes; the act of an author writing his or her words in text is what communicates to the audience (in this case readers) the narrative of the text, and the author represents an act of narrative communication between the textual narrator and the narratee. This is in line with Fludernik&#x27;s perspective on what&#x27;s called cognitive narratology—which states that a literary text has the ability to manifest itself into an imagined, representational illusion that the reader will create for themselves, and can vary greatly from reader to reader. In other words, the scenarios of a literary text (referring to settings, frames, schemes, etc.) are going to be represented differently for each individual reader based on a multiplicity of factors, including the reader&#x27;s own personal life experiences that allow them to comprehend the literary text in a distinct manner from anyone else.

Film narrative does not have the luxury of having a textual narrator that guides its audience toward a formative narrative; nor does it have the ability to allow its audience to visually manifest the contents of its narrative in a unique fashion like literature does. Instead, film narratives utilize visual and auditory devices in substitution for a narrative subject; these devices include cinematography, editing, sound design (both diegetic and non-diegetic sound), as well as the arrangement and decisions on how and where the subjects are located onscreen—known as &quot;mise-en-scène&quot;. These cinematic devices, among others, contribute to the unique blend of visual and auditory storytelling that culminates to what Jose Landa refers to as a &quot;visual narrative instance&quot;. And unlike narratives found in other performance arts such as plays and musicals, film narratives are not bound to a specific place and time, and are not limited by scene transitions in plays, which are restricted by set design and allotted time.

==In mythology==
The nature or existence of a formative narrative in many of the world&#x27;s myths, folktales, and legends has been a topic of debate for many modern scholars; but the most common consensus among academics is that throughout most cultures, traditional mythologies and folklore tales are constructed and retold with a specific narrative purpose that serves to offer a society an understandable explanation of natural phenomena—oftentimes absent of a verifiable author. These explanatory tales manifest themselves in various forms and serve different societal functions, including life lessons for individuals to learn from (for example, the Ancient Greek tale of Icarus refusing to listen to his elders and flying too close to the sun), explaining forces of nature or other natural phenomena (for example, the flood myth that spans cultures all over the world), and providing an understanding of human nature, as exemplified by the myth of Cupid and Psyche.

Considering how mythologies have historically been transmitted and passed down through oral retellings, there is no qualitative or reliable method to precisely trace exactly where and when a tale originated; and since myths are rooted in a remote past, and are viewed as a factual account of happenings within the culture it originated from, the worldview present in many oral mythologies is from a cosmological perspective—one that is told from a voice that has no physical embodiment, and is passed down and modified from generation to generation. This cosmological worldview in myth is what provides all mythological narratives credence, and since they are easily communicated and modified through oral tradition among various cultures, they help solidify the cultural identity of a civilization and contribute to the notion of a collective human consciousness that continues to help shape one&#x27;s own understanding of the world.

Myth is often used in an overarching sense to describe a multitude of folklore genres, but there is a significance in distinguishing the various forms of folklore in order to properly determine what narratives constitute as mythological, as anthropologist Sir James Frazer suggests. Frazer contends that there are three primary categories of mythology (now more broadly considered categories of folklore): Myths, legends, and folktales, and that by definition, each genre pulls its narrative from a different ontological source, and therefore has different implications within a civilization. Frazer states:

&quot;If these definitions be accepted, we may say that myth has its source in reason, legend in memory, and folk-tale in imagination; and that the three riper products of the human mind which correspond to these its crude creations are science, history, and romance.&quot;

Janet Bacon expanded upon Frazer&#x27;s categorization in her 1921 publication—&quot;The Voyage of The Argonauts&quot;.

# Myth – According to Janet Bacon&#x27;s 1921 publication, &quot;Myth has an explanatory intention. It explains some natural phenomenon whose causes are not obvious, or some ritual practice whose origin has been forgotten.&quot; Bacon views myths as narratives that serve a practical societal function of providing a satisfactory explanation for many of humanity&#x27;s greatest questions. Those questions address topics such as astronomical events, historical circumstances, environmental phenomena, and a range of human experiences including love, anger, greed, and isolation.
# Legend – According to Bacon, &quot;Legend, on the other hand, is true tradition founded on the fortunes of real people or on adventures at real places. Agamemnon, Lycurgus, Coriolanus, King Arthur, Saladin, are real people whose fame and the legends which spread it have become world-wide.&quot; Legends are mythical figures whose accomplishments and accolades live beyond their own mortality and transcend to the realm of myth by way of verbal communication through the ages. Like myth, they are rooted in the past, but unlike the sacred ephemeral space in which myths occur, legends are often individuals of human flesh that lived here on earth long ago, and are believed as fact. In American folklore, the tale of Davy Crockett or debatably Paul Bunyan can be considered legends—they were real people who lived in the world, but through the years of regional folktales have assumed a mythological quality.
# Folktale – Bacon classifies folktale as such, &quot;Folk-tale, however, calls for no belief, being wholly the product of the imagination. In far distant ages some inventive story-teller was pleased to pass an idle hour with stories told of many-a-feat.&quot; Bacon&#x27;s definition assumes that folktales do not possess the same underlying factualness that myths and legends tend to have. While folktales still hold a considerable cultural value, they are simply not regarded as true within a civilization. Bacon says, like myths, folktales are imagined and created by someone at some point, but differ in that folktales&#x27; primary purpose is to entertain; and that like legends, folktales may possess some element of truth in their original conception, but lack any form of credibility found in legends.

===Structure===
In the absence of a known author or original narrator, myth narratives are oftentimes referred to as prose narratives. Prose narratives tend to be relatively linear regarding the time period they occur in, and are traditionally marked by its natural flow of speech as opposed to the rhythmic structure found in various forms of literature such as poetry and haikus. The structure of prose narratives allows it to be easily understood by many—as the narrative generally starts at the beginning of the story, and ends when the protagonist has resolved the conflict. These kinds of narratives are generally accepted as true within society, and are told from a place of great reverence and sacredness. Myths are believed to occur in a remote past—one that is before the creation or establishment of the civilization they derive from, and are intended to provide an account for things such as humanity&#x27;s origins, natural phenomenon, and human nature. Thematically, myths seek to provide information about oneself, and many are viewed as among some of the oldest forms of prose narratives, which grants traditional myths their life-defining characteristics that continue to be communicated today.

Another theory regarding the purpose and function of mythological narratives derives from 20th Century philologist Georges Dumézil and his formative theory of the &quot;trifunctionalism&quot; found in Indo-European mythologies. Dumèzil refers only to the myths found in Indo-European societies, but the primary assertion made by his theory is that Indo-European life was structured around the notion of three distinct and necessary societal functions, and as a result, the various gods and goddesses in Indo-European mythology assumed these functions as well. The three functions were organized by cultural significance, with the first function being the most grand and sacred. For Dumèzil, these functions were so vital, they manifested themselves in every aspect of life and were at the center of everyday life.

These &quot;functions&quot;, as Dumèzil puts it, were an array of esoteric knowledge and wisdom that was reflected by the mythology. The first function was sovereignty—and was divided into two additional categories: magical and juridical. As each function in Dumèzil&#x27;s theory corresponded to a designated social class in the human realm; the first function was the highest, and was reserved for the status of kings and other royalty. In an interview with Alain Benoist, Dumèzil described magical sovereignty as such,&quot;[Magical Sovereignty] consists of the mysterious administration, the &#x27;magic&#x27; of the universe, the general ordering of the cosmos. This is a &#x27;disquieting&#x27; aspect, terrifying from certain perspectives. The other aspect is more reassuring, more oriented to the human world. It is the &#x27;juridical&#x27; part of the sovereign function.&quot;This implies that gods of the first function are responsible for the overall structure and order of the universe, and those gods who possess juridical sovereignty are more closely connected to the realm of humans and are responsible for the concept of justice and order. Dumèzil uses the pantheon of Norse gods as examples of these functions in his 1981 essay—he finds that the Norse gods Odin and Tyr reflect the different brands of sovereignty. Odin is the author of the cosmos, and possessor of infinite esoteric knowledge—going so far as to sacrifice his eye for the accumulation of more knowledge. While Tyr—seen as the &quot;just god&quot;—is more concerned with upholding justice, as illustrated by the epic myth of Tyr losing his hand in exchange for the monster Fenrir to cease his terrorization of the gods. Dumèzil&#x27;s theory suggests that through these myths, concepts of universal wisdom and justice were able to be communicated to the Nordic people in the form of a mythological narrative.

The second function as described by Dumèzil is that of the proverbial hero or champion. These myths functioned to convey the themes of heroism, strength, and bravery and were most often represented in both the human world and the mythological world by valiant warriors. While the gods of the second function were still revered in society, they did not possess the same infinite knowledge found in the first category. A Norse god that would fall under the second function would be Thor—god of thunder. Thor possessed great strength, and was often first into battle, as ordered by his father Odin. This second function reflects Indo-European cultures&#x27; high regard for the warrior class, and explains the belief in an afterlife that rewards a valiant death on the battlefield; for the Norse mythology, this is represented by Valhalla.

Lastly, Dumèzil&#x27;s third function is composed of gods that reflect the nature and values of the most common people in Indo-European life. These gods often presided over the realms of healing, prosperity, fertility, wealth, luxury, and youth—any kind of function that was easily related to by the common peasant farmer in a society. Just as a farmer would live and sustain themselves off their land, the gods of the third function were responsible for the prosperity of their crops, and were also in charge of other forms of everyday life that would never be observed by the status of kings and warriors, such as mischievousness and promiscuity. An example found in Norse mythology could be seen through the god Freyr—a god who was closely connected to acts of debauchery and overindulging.

Dumèzil viewed his theory of trifunctionalism as distinct from other mythological theories because of the way the narratives of Indo-European mythology permeated into every aspect of life within these societies, to the point that the societal view of death shifted away from a primal perception that tells one to fear death, and instead death became seen as the penultimate act of heroism—by solidifying a person&#x27;s position in the hall of the gods when they pass from this realm to the next. Additionally, Dumèzil proposed that his theory stood at the foundation of the modern understanding of the Christian Trinity, citing that the three key deities of Odin, Thor, and Freyr were often depicted together in a trio—seen by many as an overarching representation of what would be known today as &quot;divinity&quot;.

==In cultural storytelling==
A narrative can take on the shape of a story, which gives listeners an entertaining and collaborative avenue for acquiring knowledge. Many cultures use storytelling as a way to record histories, myths, and values. These stories can be seen as living entities of narrative among cultural communities, as they carry the shared experience and history of the culture within them. Stories are often used within indigenous cultures in order to share knowledge to the younger generation. Due to indigenous narratives leaving room for open-ended interpretation, native stories often engage children in the storytelling process so that they can make their own meaning and explanations within the story. This promotes holistic thinking among native children, which works toward merging an individual and world identity. Such an identity upholds native epistemology and gives children a sense of belonging as their cultural identity develops through the sharing and passing on of stories.

For example, a number of indigenous stories are used to illustrate a value or lesson. In the Western Apache tribe, stories can be used to warn of the misfortune that befalls people when they do not follow acceptable behavior. One story speaks to the offense of a mother&#x27;s meddling in her married son&#x27;s life. In the story, the Western Apache tribe is under attack from a neighboring tribe, the Pimas. The Apache mother hears a scream. Thinking it is her son&#x27;s wife screaming, she tries to intervene by yelling at him. This alerts the Pima tribe to her location, and she is promptly killed due to intervening in her son&#x27;s life.

Indigenous American cultures use storytelling to teach children the values and lessons of life. Although storytelling provides entertainment, its primary purpose is to educate. Alaskan Indigenous Natives state that narratives teach children where they fit in, what their society expects of them, how to create a peaceful living environment, and to be responsible, worthy members of their communities. In the Mexican culture, many adult figures tell their children stories in order to teach children values such as individuality, obedience, honesty, trust, and compassion. For example, one of the versions of La Llorona is used to teach children to make safe decisions at night and to maintain the morals of the community.

Narratives are considered by the Canadian Métis community, to help children understand that the world around them is interconnected to their lives and communities. For example, the Métis community share the &quot;Humorous Horse Story&quot; to children, which portrays that horses stumble throughout life just like humans do. Navajo stories also use dead animals as metaphors by showing that all things have purpose. Lastly, elders from Alaskan Native communities claim that the use of animals as metaphors allow children to form their own perspectives while at the same time self-reflecting on their own lives.

American Indian elders also state that storytelling invites the listeners, especially children, to draw their own conclusions and perspectives while self-reflecting upon their lives. Furthermore, they insist that narratives help children grasp and obtain a wide range of perspectives that help them interpret their lives in the context of the story. American Indian community members emphasize to children that the method of obtaining knowledge can be found in stories passed down through each generation. Moreover, community members also let the children interpret and build a different perspective of each story.

==In the military field==
An emerging field of information warfare is the &quot;battle of the narratives&quot;. The battle of the narratives is a full-blown battle in the cognitive dimension of the information environment, just as traditional warfare is fought in the physical domains (air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace). One of the foundational struggles in warfare in the physical domains is to shape the environment such that the contest of arms will be fought on terms that are to one&#x27;s advantage. Likewise, a key component of the battle of the narratives is to succeed in establishing the reasons for and potential outcomes of the conflict, on terms favorable to one&#x27;s efforts.

==Historiography==
In historiography, according to Lawrence Stone, narrative has traditionally been the main rhetorical device used by historians. In 1979, at a time when the new social history was demanding a social-science model of analysis, Stone detected a move back toward the narrative. Stone defined narrative as organized chronologically; focused on a single coherent story; descriptive rather than analytical; concerned with people not abstract circumstances; and dealing with the particular and specific rather than the collective and statistical. He reported that, &quot;More and more of the &#x27;new historians&#x27; are now trying to discover what was going on inside people&#x27;s heads in the past, and what it was like to live in the past, questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative.&quot;

Some philosophers identify narratives with a type of explanation. Mark Bevir argues, for example, that narratives explain actions by appealing to the beliefs and desires of actors and by locating webs of beliefs in the context of historical traditions. Narrative is an alternative form of explanation to that associated with natural science.

Historians committed to a social science approach, however, have criticized the narrowness of narrative and its preference for anecdote over analysis, and clever examples rather than statistical regularities.

==Storytelling rights==
Storytelling rights may be broadly defined as the ethics of sharing narratives (including—but not limited to—firsthand, secondhand, and imagined stories). In &quot;Storytelling Rights: The uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents&quot;, author Amy Shuman offers the following definition of storytelling rights: &quot;the important and precarious relationship between narrative and event and, specifically, between the participants in an event and the reporters who claim the right to talk about what happened.&quot;

The ethics of retelling other people&#x27;s stories may be explored through a number of questions: whose story is being told and how, what is the story&#x27;s purpose or aim, what does the story promise (for instance: empathy, redemption, authenticity, clarification)—and at whose benefit? Storytelling rights also implicates questions of consent, empathy, and accurate representation. While storytelling—and retelling—can function as a powerful tool for agency and advocacy, it can also lead to misunderstanding and exploitation.

Storytelling rights is notably important in the genre of personal experience narrative. Academic disciplines such as performance, folklore, literature, anthropology, cultural studies, and other social sciences may involve the study of storytelling rights, often hinging on ethics.

Similar to metanarrative are masterplots or &quot;recurrent skeletal stories, belonging to cultures and individuals that play a powerful role in questions of identity, values, and the understanding of life.&quot;

<text>Pierre Brossolette (; 25 June 1903 – 22 March 1944) was a French journalist, politician and major hero of the French Resistance in World War II. 

Brossolette ran a Resistance intelligence hub from a Parisian bookshop on the Rue de la Pompe, before serving as a liaison officer in London, where he also was a radio anchor for the BBC, and carried out three clandestine missions in France. Arrested in Brittany as he was trying to reach the UK on a mission back from France alongside Émile Bollaert, Brossolette was taken into custody by the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (the security service of the SS). He committed suicide by jumping out of a window at their headquarters on 84 Avenue Foch in Paris as he feared he would reveal the lengths of French Resistance networks under torture; he died of his wounds later that day at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital.

On 27 May 2015, his ashes were transferred to the Panthéon with national honours at the request of President François Hollande, alongside politician Jean Zay and fellow Resistance members Germaine Tillion and Geneviève de Gaulle-Anthonioz.

== Biography ==
=== Education and journalism ===
Pierre Brossolette was born in the 16th arrondissement of Paris to a family deeply involved in the fights for laic schools in early 20th century France. His father was Léon Brossolette, General Inspector for Primary Education; his mother Jeanne Vial was the daughter of Francisque Vial, Director of Secondary Education, responsible for making secondary education free in France.

Brossolette ranked first at the entrance examination to the prestigious École Normale Supérieure; throughout his education held the title of &quot;cacique&quot; which was internally attributed to the most brilliant student, ahead of intellectuals such as philosopher Vladimir Jankélévitch and two years before Jean-Paul Sartre and Raymond Aron. In 1925 he graduated second to Georges Bidault after a small scandal on the dissertation themes for the final examination. His passion for history had led him to choose this &quot;agrégation&quot; instead of the more usual and prestigious philosophy one. During this time and while he was in his military service, he married Gilberte Bruel and had two children, Anne and Claude.

Instead of pursuing an academic career like most &quot;normaliens&quot;, he longed for action and decided to enter journalism and politics. He joined the Section française de l&#x27;Internationale ouvrière (SFIO), the main socialist party, in 1929, adhered to the LDH and LICA league and entered freemasonry. He worked as a journalist for &quot;Notre Temps&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Europe Nouvelle&quot;, the party newspaper &quot;Le Populaire&quot; and the state-owned Radio PTT but was fired when he violently opposed the Munich Agreement on air in 1939. In his newspaper columns, Brossolette had evolved from a resolute pacifist and europeanist, after Aristide Briand&#x27;s ideals, to a denunciator of both fascism and communism.

=== Resistance activities ===
When World War II broke out, he joined the army as a lieutenant of the 5th régiment d&#x27;infanterie; before the fall of France, he reached the rank of captain receiving two citations for the French War Cross for having retreated his battalion in an orderly way. After the Armistice, when the Vichy regime forbade him to teach, Brossolette and his wife took over a bookstore specialised in Russian literature at the Rue de la Pompe near Lycée Janson-de-Sailly, where he had attended high school. The bookstore became an intelligence hub of Parisian resistance where documents, such as Renault factory plans used for its bombing, were exchanged unnoticed, thanks to the extensive library available underground.

He was a popular voice on the radio before the war and his chronicles on Hitler&#x27;s rise led to being blacklisted early in the 1930s by the Nazis. It did not take long before he was approached by his friend Agnès Humbert and introduced to Jean Cassou and the &quot;Groupe du musée de l&#x27;Homme&quot;, the very first resistance network. He just had time to produce the last issue of the newsletter &quot;Résistance&quot; before narrowly escaping its dismantlement.

By then assuming a pivotal role in the ZO (&quot;Zone Occupée&quot;) Resistance, Brossolette coordinated contacts between groups such as Libération-Nord from Christian Pineau, the Organisation Civile et Militaire (OCM) and Comité d&#x27;Action Socialiste (CAS). He finally obtained a liaison with London and General Charles de Gaulle when he was hired by conservative Gilbert Renault also known as Colonel Rémy as press and propaganda manager of Confrérie Notre-Dame (CND), by then the most important network in Northern France.

In April 1942, Brossolette met De Gaulle in London as representative of the ZO Resistance and was hired to work on bringing political credibility to De Gaulle to back his recognition as the only Free French Forces leader by the Allies in his feud against Henri Giraud in Algiers. At the same time, he was promoted to major (&quot;commandant&quot;) and awarded &quot;Compagnon de la Libération&quot;.

Brossolette created the civilian arm of the BCRAM intelligence service, which became the Bureau Central de Renseignements et d&#x27;Action (BCRA), in liaison with the RF section of the British side, Special Operations Executive (SOE). Strong ties of camaraderie were forged between Brossolette (codenamed Brumaire, also known as Commandant Bourgat), BCRA&#x27;s chief André Dewavrin (codenamed Arquebuse, also known as Colonel Passy) and SOE&#x27;s Forest Frederick Edward Yeo-Thomas (codenamed Shelley, also known as The White Rabbit). De Gaulle set up his Free French intelligence system to combine both military and political roles, including covert operations. The policy was reversed in 1943 by Emmanuel d&#x27;Astier de La Vigerie (1900–1969), the Interior Minister, who insisted on civilian control of political intelligence.
The three friends were sent on a mission to France and united, under the CCZN (&quot;Comité de Coordination de Zone Nord&quot;), the various ZO Resistance groups which had been thoroughly divided by political views, including the communist-led Front National (mission Arquebuse-Brumaire); they were thus instrumental in the merging with the ZL (&quot;Zone Libre&quot;) Resistance similarly united by Jean Moulin under the MUR. This led to the creation of the Conseil National de la Résistance (CNR) by Moulin through the addition of the political parties and unions and ultimately to De Gaulle&#x27;s unequivocal recognition as Free France&#x27;s political representative to the Allies.

During this time, Pierre Brossolette resumed his radio chronicles on BBC with high-profile speeches to the &quot;army of shadows&quot;, replacing Maurice Schumann as anchor (38 times). In a speech at the Albert Hall on 18 June 1943, he famously praised the &quot;soutiers de la gloire&quot; (or &quot;stokers of glory&quot;) in a reference to the fallen anonymous soldiers and resistants. Brossolette also resumed his newspaper work through a series of articles on France&#x27;s situation, including one in &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; considered by many to be the doctrinal founding of the &quot;Gaullisme de guerre&quot; movement.

=== Politics ===
In addition to journalism, Pierre Brossolette was also a politician. He was a protégé of Léon Blum and was considered an up-and-coming star of the SFIO party, running elections on his Troyes (Champagne) base. He assumed cabinet functions during the Popular Front government and as a political pundit on official Radio PTT he was considered the &quot;de facto&quot; foreign policy spokesman of the socialist government. Already calling for deep rejuvenation of the political class before the war, he attributed French defeat in 1940 to the corrupt political system of the Third Republic.

As he politically structured the Parisian resistance, Brossolette succeeded in convincing the network leaders to create a temporary Resistance Party under De Gaulle&#x27;s leadership after the war, focused on promoting ambitious social transformations while avoiding the predictable enmity and chaos of post-Liberation times. This political and social plan, including nationalisations and price controls, inspired the March 1944 Conseil national de la Résistance programme and was implemented after war.

Brossolette&#x27;s criticism of the old parliamentarian system, together with the role of communist networks inside the CNR, became the main point of disagreement with his southern counterpart Jean Moulin. His desire to disband all the old parties through a complete reshuffle of ideological lines logically brought him into conflict with the party leaders. As a result, he was excluded from the newly reconstituted SFIO party by Daniel Mayer and Gaston Defferre a few days before being arrested, although the decision to remove him from the party was never enforced and was actually forgotten.

Despite this, most of his ideas were implemented in 1958 when De Gaulle established the Fifth Republic and established a presidentialist system based around his Rally of the French People (RPF) party. However, De Gaulle was pushed in the short term to decide in favour of Jean Moulin&#x27;s proposal as he still struggled to show the Allies (Americans in particular) that he was not a dictator. Brossolette&#x27;s ideas of a Resistance party raised many opponents&#x27; fears of a &quot;bonapartian&quot; drift, especially among fellow socialists in London including Pierre Cot and Raymond Aron. This seemed to be confirmed to his detractors&#x27; eyes when Brossolette succeeded a bold blow against the Vichy regime by exfiltrating from France Charles Vallin, deputy leader of conservative French Social Party (PSF) that had surged as the main French party with over 30% at pre-war elections, but deemed proto-fascist by the left. Hence the French Fourth Republic eventually reverted to the Third Republic&#x27;s pre-war parliamentarist system.

During his last missions, Brossolette worked on creating a new party that could be the major force of the left. He was inspired by the British Labour Party, using a non-Marxist or, at least, reformist approach (thus effectively challenging the French Socialist Party). For that, he spent his last days writing an ambitious critique of Marx&#x27;s political philosophy as a by-product of 18th-century rationalism that would provide the theoretical framework for this party. Unfortunately, at the time of his arrest the manuscripts were thrown overboard at sea over Brittany shores.

=== Arrest ===
Brossolette returned to Paris for a third mission to reorganise the Parisian resistance which was in disarray after successive Gestapo raids, especially by CND&#x27;s dismantling.

By then, his role and importance was already well known to the SS Intelligence Services after Moulin&#x27;s death and despite De Gaulle&#x27;s clear reluctance to appoint him as substitute CNR chief. He escaped arrest many times and was summoned to return to Britain by late 1943 to introduce the newly appointed CNR chief, Émile Bollaert, to De Gaulle. The bad winter weather cancelled many Lysander exfiltration attempts (conducted only under moonlight) or Lysanders would be shot down as in a December attempt near Laon, so in February 1944, they decided to return by boat from Brittany. However, the vessel, hit by a storm, shipwrecked at Pointe du Raz. They managed to reach the coast and to be hidden by local Resistance, but were betrayed by a local woman at a checkpoint.

Bollaert and Brossolette were not identified and were kept imprisoned in Rennes for weeks. F. F. E. Yeo-Thomas, when informed of Brossolette&#x27;s capture, decided to be immediately parachuted onto the continent and organise his escape. Nevertheless, they were recognised before the planned action and taken to the Intelligence Services (&quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot;) headquarters on Avenue Foch by senior SD officer Ernst Misselwitz in person on 19 March. It was recently confirmed that he was identified by a semi-coded report to London from CNR&#x27;s Claude Bouchinet-Serreules and Jacques Bingen written by the services of Daniel Cordier intercepted at the Pyrenees, tragically self-fulfilling the severe criticism of Brossolette and Yeo-Thomas about the lack of prudence inside the Parisian &quot;Délégation générale&quot;. Yeo-Thomas himself would be captured as he prepared a bold escape from Rennes Prison wearing German uniforms with the help of Brigitte Friang. Both Yeo-Thomas and Friang were captured before planned action as many Parisian networks were dismantled following the so-called &quot;Rue de la Pompe affair&quot; (after the location of the &quot;Delegation générale&quot;) and Pierre Manuel&#x27;s avows.

=== Torture and death ===

Brossolette was tortured at 84 Avenue Foch in Paris, enduring severe beatings and waterboardings over a two-and-a-half-day period. On 22 March, while he was left alone and recovered some consciousness, he threw himself through the window of the garret room of the building&#x27;s sixth floor. Since he had not swallowed his cyanide capsule when captured in Rennes, he was afraid of implicating others and probably chose to silence himself. There was a widespread belief among resistants that it was difficult, if not impossible, not to speak under torture.

He died later in the evening at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. On 24 March, he was cremated at Père Lachaise Cemetery. His ashes were kept at Père Lachaise Cemetery&#x27;s &quot;columbarium&quot;, urn 3913 according to official cemetery records. Brossolette&#x27;s reportedly last words were enigmatic: &quot;all will be fine Tuesday&quot;.

== Posterity ==

From after the war until the late 1950s, Brossolette was considered the main leader of the French Resistance, though many were claimed heroes by their political family (such as Honoré d&#x27;Estienne d&#x27;Orves by royalists and Gabriel Péri by communists). Brossolette&#x27;s fame was helped by his media notoriety before the war on Radio-PTT and on wartime BBC emissions, his networking role that made his name or codename known and remembered over almost every Resistance member in northern France and by flattering early accounts of BCRA&#x27;s chief Passy in his memoirs although he had also created, through his independent position and sarcastic wit, many enemies among party leaders, Gaullists, communists and even socialists that survived him.

De Gaulle himself thought otherwise and as he started writing his memoirs in 1954 and later assumed power, he attributed the main leading role to his by-then relatively unknown representative Jean Moulin rather than field leaders as De Gaulle emphasized the top-down unification that objectively allowed him to be recognized by the Allies. This was formalized in 1964 by the transfer of Moulin&#x27;s ashes to the Panthéon, and backed by an emotional speech by André Malraux.

With time, Brossolette was relegated to a second place and became the hero of his party SFIO while Moulin came to symbolize the myth of the French Resistance unity while the country struggled with the Algerian war and as De Gaulle tried to avoid civil war calling for union while noticing the growing popular clout of the Resistance legend on the postwar imagination.

Later, Brossolette&#x27;s memory suffered another blow when the 1981-elected socialist president François Mitterrand chose to honour Moulin at a Panthéon investiture ceremony instead of rehabilitating Brossolette&#x27;s role. This further enhanced his relegation – even inside the socialist political family, as evidenced by the modest celebrations of his birth centenary in 2003 and the SFIO/PS centenary. At the time, a senior party official Harlem Désir (currently secretary-general of the PS) anecdotally told that the most important figure of the party&#x27;s century was Jean Moulin – who actually never was a party member and deemed instead close to the Radical Party.

Since then, he has been fairly better remembered than heroes such as Bingen, Jean Cavaillès or Berty Albrecht or important leaders such as Henri Frenay, but overall eclipsed by Moulin&#x27;s popularity.

More recently in 2013, a support committee presided by historian Mona Ozouf was set up to bid for the transfer of Pierre Brossolette&#x27;s ashes to the Panthéon, backed by an internet petition at the committee&#x27;s site. On 21 February 2014, France&#x27;s President François Hollande announced the transfer of Pierre Brossolette&#x27;s ashes to the Panthéon with 3 other resistants Geneviève de Gaulle-Anthonioz and Germaine Tillion, as well as a former pre-war Minister Jean Zay. Brossolette&#x27;s ashes were kept at the columbarium of Père Lachaise Cemetery (urns 3902 or 3913) until his entrance to the Panthéon, which was celebrated on 27 May 2015.

=== Homages ===
In France today, Brossolette&#x27;s name is better known than the man himself or his life achievements, thanks to the great number of streets – nearly 500 out of which 127 in Greater Paris, schools and public facilities bearing it (see below). His widow Gilberte was prominent in relaying his political ideas. In the 1950s, she was the first woman to enter – and, as vice-president, occasionally preside over – the French Senate.

In Paris, a small street in the &quot;Quartier Latin&quot; between Rue Érasme and Rue Calvin, near École Normale Supérieure, was christened Rue Pierre-Brossolette in 1944 as among the very few celebrating a 20th-century person, together with Pierre and Marie Curie. A notable exception is Lyon, probably illustrating the rivalries between the two Zones as conversely no street in Paris had been christened after Jean Moulin until 1965.

Buildings in Paris such as the former bookstore and nearby &quot;Lycée&quot; Janson de Sailly&#x27;s court at Rue de la Pompe, the residence at Rue de Grenelle, his birthplace at rue Michel-Ange, the &quot;Maison&quot; de Radio France and the Ministry of the Interior&#x27;s court at Rue des Saussaies all feature commemorative plaques and his name is mentioned on a floor plaque at the Panthéon.

In Narbonne plage, a unique aeolian memorial attests to his popularity in the early postwar years and marks the place of his exfiltration by felucca Seadog. In Saint-Saëns, a stele commemorates the first Lysander exfiltration to London and nearby Plogoff another marks the failed Brittany exfiltration attempt.

Brossolette was also featured in the first series of Heroes of the Resistance by French PTT in 1957. The Saint-Cyr Military Academy ROTC Class of 2004 was christened after Brossolette, and a class song was created for the occasion. The masonic Grande Loge de France named its cultural circle after Condorcet-Brossolette.
