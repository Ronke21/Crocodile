<text>Mark Anthony Philippoussis (born 7 November 1976) is an Australian tennis coach, commentator and former professional tennis player of Greek and Italian descent. Philippoussis&#x27; greatest achievements are winning two Davis Cup titles with Australia in 1999 and 2003, winning the deciding rubber in the final of each. He also reached the final of the 1998 US Open and the 2003 Wimbledon singles tournaments. Philippoussis reached a career-high singles ranking of world No. 8.

Philippoussis has had a minor career in modelling and starred in the American reality television dating show &quot;Age of Love&quot;. He is nicknamed &#x27;the Scud&#x27;, after the Scud missile. He is also known in Australia as “The Pou”.

==Background==
Mark Philippoussis (, ) was born in Melbourne to a Greek father, Nikolaos (&quot;Nick&quot;), and an Italian mother, Rossana; and was educated at Maribyrnong College and later at Wesley College. He is of the Catholic faith.

==Career==
===Beginnings===
Coached by his father, Nick, the right-hander has played tennis since he was six years of age. He was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder. He was briefly coached by former 1987 Wimbledon champion Pat Cash, which ended in an acrimonious split in 2000. In 1994, he finished third in singles ranking for juniors. Philippoussis also finished as junior doubles champion with Ben Ellwood in Australia, Wimbledon, and Italy. He turned professional in 1994.

In 1995, at the age of 19, he was the youngest player in the year-end top 50. In 1996, he reached the 4th round of the Australian Open upsetting Pete Sampras in the 3rd round and in doubles with Patrick Rafter. On 25 May 1997, he recorded a personal best 229.0 km/h (142.3 mph) serve in a game he lost to Albert Costa. During the height of his career, Philippoussis was known as having one of the fastest serves in the game.

===Rise to top 10===
At the 1998 US Open U.S. Open, Philippoussis reached his first Grand Slam final, losing to fellow Australian Patrick Rafter. In January 1999, Philippoussis and Jelena Dokić won the Hopman Cup for Australia, defeating Sweden&#x27;s Åsa Carlsson and Jonas Björkman in the final tie. This was the first time that Australia won the Hopman Cup and the only time until Nick Kyrgios and Daria Gavrilova won in January 2016.

On March 14 1999, Mark Philippoussis defeated Carlos Moyá, 5–7, 6–4, 6–4, 4–6, 6–2 in final of Indian Wells Masters.
On 29 March 1999, Philippoussis entered the top 10 for the first time and stayed there for 10 weeks. He advanced to the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in 1999 for the second straight year, where he retired in the second set against Sampras after having won the first set. During that match, Philippoussis suffered a moderate cartilage tear in his left knee and underwent arthroscopic surgery four days later. Sampras later remarked that he &quot;dodged a bullet out there&quot;. Philippoussis returned to professional tennis seven weeks later at the Indianapolis Tennis Championships and lost his second-round match after receiving a bye in the first round. He did not play again until October in Singapore, where he lost in the second round. He finished 1999 at No. 19.

2000 was the fourth consecutive year in which Philippoussis finished in the top 20, at No. 11. He reached the fourth round at the Australian Open, losing to eventual champion Andre Agassi. He defeated No. 2 Sampras 8–6 in the fifth set at the French Open in a first-round match, but lost in the fourth round to Juan Carlos Ferrero. For the third consecutive year, he made it to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, losing again to Agassi. He appeared in his second Olympic Games in Sydney, losing in the third round to eventual gold medalist Yevgeny Kafelnikov.

Philippoussis finished 2002 in the top 100 (seventh time in eight years), despite not winning a title. He moved from Miami to the San Diego area in September 2002.

===Davis Cup===
Philippoussis has always claimed to be proud of representing his country in Davis Cup, but personal differences with John Newcombe and Tony Roche interfered with his commitment early in his career. Despite several highly publicised feuds, Philippoussis played a large part in giving Australia their 27th Davis Cup triumph—second only to the United States with 31—but it was their first since 1986. In 1999 he defeated Cédric Pioline, 6–3, 5–7, 6–1, 6–2, in Nice, France.

Injuries plagued Philippoussis&#x27;s availability for Davis Cup and was the cause of a public rift between team-mates Patrick Rafter and Lleyton Hewitt. Rafter publicly accused Philippoussis of jerking the team around after he withdrew from a Davis Cup tie in late 2000. Philippoussis said Rafter was ill-informed and upset by the lack of support and understanding from his team-mates.

Knee surgeries forced Philippoussis out of Davis Cup until February 2003. By then, Pat Rafter had retired, and John Fitzgerald and Wally Masur were the new Davis Cup captain and coach. Philippoussis sealed victory for Australia in the Melbourne Final against Spain. Philippoussis beat Spain&#x27;s Juan Carlos Ferrero in a 7–5, 6–3, 1–6, 2–6, 6–0 battle. Philippoussis suffered a pectoral tear at the end of the second set, which caused him to lose the third and fourth sets. He regrouped in the fifth set and beat Ferrero 6–0.

===2003–2005: Comeback===

After three knee operations, Philippoussis embarked on a protracted comeback. He made himself available regularly for Davis Cup, hired a new physical trainer, and took up surfing as his new recreation. He made the 2003 Wimbledon final, finally losing to Roger Federer, 6–7(5–7), 2–6, 6–7(3–7).

During a 2003 Wimbledon tennis match against Andre Agassi (6–3, 2–6, 6–7(4–7), 6–3, 6–4), he set a new Australian tennis record of 46 aces served in a match, three aces short of the overall ATP Tour record then held by Richard Krajicek.

Philippoussis broke a two-year singles-title drought by winning the Shanghai Open in 2003. On 30 November 2003, he defeated Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain to win the fourth match of the Davis Cup final in Melbourne, securing the title for Australia. At the end of 2003, Philippoussis received the ATP Comeback Player of the Year award.

The honeymoon period with the Australian public, however, did not last. 2004 proved a disastrous year in terms of his tennis career and public profile. After shouldering most of the blame for losing Australia&#x27;s Davis Cup tie with Sweden with an unexpected below-par performance, Philippoussis struggled through to the Wimbledon fourth round in June 2004. From Wimbledon in June until the end of the season in October, he failed to win a single ATP tennis match and finished with one of his lowest rankings since turning professional in 1994.

In October 2004, a much-publicised affair with Delta Goodrem had soured and seriously damaged his standing, after newspapers alleged that he had dated Paris Hilton while with Goodrem. In March 2005, he became engaged to actress and model Alexis Barbara. &quot;The Age&quot; reported the pair had split in July 2006, but Philippoussis denied this to Australian tabloid &quot;New Idea&quot;; they did split some time before he began filming &quot;Age of Love&quot;.

===2006: Return===
After some controversy over his wildcard selection after a disappointing 2006 Australian Open, Philippoussis made more headlines when he again earned entry into the 2006 Wimbledon. He was defeated in the second round.

Leading into the Campbell&#x27;s Hall of Fame Championships as a wildcard, his record was a modest 6–7. He had a fantastic run in the tournament, getting to the final, where he defeated Justin Gimelstob in straight sets to claim his first title in almost three years.

He confirmed to Sydney&#x27;s &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; on 23 August 2006, that he &quot;parted ways with&quot; his father as his coach and rehired Peter McNamara in an attempt to revive his career.

Philippoussis, then ranked No. 114, lost to Rafael Nadal as a wildcard entry in the first round of the 2006 US Open. The Australian Davis Cup team lost against Argentina in an unpredictable 5–0. On 22 September, Philippoussis was defeated by David Nalbandian 4–6, 3–6, 3–6, in the first match of the series.

Philippoussis played in a series of Challenger tournaments after the Davis Cup semifinals. Philippoussis won the Calabasas tournament, defeating Amer Delic, 6–7(4–7), 7–6(7–4), 6–3, in the final.

===2007===
Philippoussis beat Russian Dmitry Tursunov, 6–4, 7–6, at the 2007 Hopman Cup. However, during his second match against Jérôme Haehnel, he was forced to retire after hyperextending his knee. An MRI showed that he had torn cartilage in his knee, forcing him to miss the rest of the season.

===2008===
Philippoussis acquired a protected ranking of No. 119 and was allowed to use that ranking for entry into eight tournaments. Tennis Australia, not being happy with his lack of matchplay and unwillingness to play the Australian Open wildcard playoff, told him that he would not be given any special treatment and would have to earn his wildcard. This forced him to use one of his protected ranking tournament entries.

In his first match of the Australian Open Wildcard playoff, he was drawn against reigning Australian Open juniors champion Brydan Klein and had a fiery contest. After a remark from Klein, Philippoussis was quoted as saying, &quot;You say that to me again and you&#x27;re in trouble; you&#x27;re not playing juniors any more.&quot; He came out the victor in straight sets, 6–3, 7–5, and thus began his comeback in good form. Philippoussis then lost his second match to Sam Groth, 4–6, 3–6, but due to other players&#x27; injuries, he advanced to the quarterfinals, where he was to play Rameez Junaid. However, due to another knee injury requiring surgery, Philippoussis was unable to play.

===2010===
Philippousis appeared in a pro tour match for the first time since November 2006, when he lost to fifth seed Michael Yani, 4–6, 4–6, in the first round of the Challenger of Dallas. Philippousis also competed in some of the events on the Champions Series, winning two tournaments and topping the rankings for 2010.

===2012===
Philippoussis has played for the Philadelphia Freedoms of World Team Tennis this summer. The Freedoms used the No. 1 overall pick to draft Philippoussis, who previously played for the team in 2002. He was the team&#x27;s marquee player on 25 July 2012 when they faced the Boston Lobsters and travelled with the team to their matches against the Sacramento Capitals and Orange County Breakers.

===2015: Return to ATP World Tour===

Philippoussis contested his first match on the ATP World Tour in nine years since winning the 2006 Newport title, after receiving a wild card into the qualifying rounds of the 2015 Hall of Fame Tennis Championships at 38 years of age. He lost to Eric Quigley 6–7(1–7), 6–7(4–7). Philippoussis also played doubles in the tournament with Ryan Harrison, winning the first round to make it to the quarter-finals before losing to the second seeds Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram.
Afterwards, Philippousis said: &quot;It was just about playing one event. There&#x27;s no talk about a comeback. Down the line if I see something, maybe close to California, I might do that. It&#x27;s one event and that&#x27;s it.&quot;

===2017===
Philippoussis won the 2017 RPIA Championships in Toronto, defeating Andy Roddick in the finals.

==Equipment==
In early 2000s, Philippoussis wore apparel manufactured by Fila on court, and used Dunlop 200G racquet.

==Television==
In 2020, Philippoussis competed as the &#x27;Echidna&#x27; in the second season of &quot;The Masked Singer Australia&quot; and was the first contestant eliminated, placing 12th overall.

===Age of Love===
Philippoussis starred as the bachelor in the reality television dating show &quot;Age of Love&quot; on the NBC television network, in June 2007.

The show centred around women in or near their 40s and women in their 20s competing for his affection. At first Philippoussis, unaware of the special format of the show, was shocked at the ages of the &quot;cougars&quot; as the older women were called. He was shocked again after learning he would also be dating younger women (&quot;kittens&quot;). The final dates occurred in his hometown of Melbourne, Australia, including a date at Moonlit Sanctuary. In the end, Philippoussis chose Amanda Salinas (the 25-year-old Nashville Predators dancer) because it &quot;wouldn&#x27;t work out&quot; with Jen, the 48-year-old assistant to Jerry Buss.

==Personal life==
In 2004, he began a nine-month relationship with Australian singer Delta Goodrem. Her &quot;comeback&quot; single, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, was written about his support during her cancer battle. The couple&#x27;s relationship ended in controversy when newspapers reported Philippoussis had been unfaithful with famed American socialite Paris Hilton.

In May 2009, Philippoussis declared that all his money was gone and that he would lose his home of residence. In a writ lodged with the Supreme Court on 15 May 2009, it was alleged Philippoussis took out a loan through his company Mergis Pty Ltd which he personally guaranteed. The writ claims Mergis – of which Philippoussis is the sole director, secretary and shareholder – defaulted less than a year later. The lender is seeking $1,313,351.96, plus interest, costs and possession of the house, or is threatening to go to trial. The Perpetual Trustee Company Ltd is listed in court documents as the plaintiff, but a company spokesman said her firm had provided funds to another company which was the one foreclosing. The other company is not detailed on the writ, but Philippoussis said it was Pepper Home Loans – a company that provides loans through mortgage brokers. Philippoussis took out a mortgage in February 2008. He said he was three months behind, adding that each monthly payment was more than $10,000. &quot;I haven&#x27;t played tennis since 2006, and tennis is one of those sports where if you don&#x27;t play, you don&#x27;t get paid&quot;, he said. In September 2009, his father Nick Philippoussis – a tennis coach and accused sex offender – also faced the threat of bankruptcy over financial institution debts.

Later in 2009, while in the US attempting to restart his tennis career, he dated and was engaged to actress Jennifer Esposito but the engagement ended a year later.

Philippoussis&#x27; former stepmother is Yan Cui.

He married Romanian-born model Silvana Lovin in September 2013. Lovin gave birth to their first child, a boy, in 2014, and had their second child, a girl, in 2018.

In July 2023, Philippoussis was fined US$10,000 by the International Tennis Integrity Agency for breaching betting sponsorship rules.

<text>The tanagers (singular ) comprise the bird family Thraupidae, in the order Passeriformes. The family has a Neotropical distribution and is the second-largest family of birds. It represents about 4% of all avian species and 12% of the Neotropical birds.

Traditionally, the family contained around 240 species of mostly brightly colored fruit-eating birds. As more of these birds were studied using modern molecular techniques, it became apparent that the traditional families were not monophyletic. &quot;Euphonia&quot; and &quot;Chlorophonia&quot;, which were once considered part of the tanager family, are now treated as members of the Fringillidae, in their own subfamily (Euphoniinae). Likewise, the genera &quot;Piranga&quot; (which includes the scarlet tanager, summer tanager, and western tanager), &quot;Chlorothraupis&quot;, and &quot;Habia&quot; appear to be members of the family Cardinalidae, and have been reassigned to that family by the American Ornithological Society.
==Description==
Tanagers are small to medium-sized birds. The shortest-bodied species, the white-eared conebill, is long and weighs , barely smaller than the short-billed honeycreeper. The longest, the magpie tanager is and weighs . The heaviest is the white-capped tanager, which weighs and measures about . Both sexes are usually the same size and weight.

Tanagers are often brightly colored, but some species are black and white. Males are typically more brightly colored than females and juveniles. Most tanagers have short, rounded wings. The shape of the bill seems to be linked to the species&#x27; foraging habits.

==Distribution==
Tanagers are restricted to the Western Hemisphere and mainly to the tropics. About 60% of tanagers live in South America, and 30% of these species live in the Andes. Most species are endemic to a relatively small area.

==Behavior==
Most tanagers live in pairs or in small groups of three to five individuals. These groups may consist simply of parents and their offspring. These birds may also be seen in single-species or mixed flocks. Many tanagers are thought to have dull songs, though some are elaborate.

===Diet===
Tanagers are omnivorous, and their diets vary by genus. They have been seen eating fruits, seeds, nectar, flower parts, and insects. Many pick insects off branches or from holes in the wood. Other species look for insects on the undersides of leaves. Yet others wait on branches until they see a flying insect and catch it in the air. Many of these particular species inhabit the same areas, but these specializations alleviate competition.

===Breeding===
The breeding season is March through June in temperate areas and in September through October in South America. Some species are territorial, while others build their nests closer together. Little information is available on tanager breeding behavior. Males show off their brightest feathers to potential mates and rival males. Some species&#x27; courtship rituals involve bowing and tail lifting.

Most tanagers build cup nests on branches in trees. Some nests are almost globular. Entrances are usually built on the side of the nest. The nests can be shallow or deep. The species of the tree in which they choose to build their nests and the nests&#x27; positions vary among genera. Most species nest in an area hidden by very dense vegetation. No information is yet known regarding the nests of some species.

The clutch size is three to five eggs. The female incubates the eggs and builds the nest, but the male may feed the female while she incubates. Both sexes feed the young. Five species have helpers assist in feeding the young. These helpers are thought to be the previous year&#x27;s nestlings.

==Taxonomy==
The family Thraupidae was introduced (as the subfamily Thraupinae) in 1847 by German ornithologist Jean Cabanis. The type genus is &quot;Thraupis&quot;.

The family Thraupidae is a member of an assemblage of over 800 birds known as the New World, nine-primaried oscines. The traditional pre-molecular classification was largely based on the different feeding specializations. Nectar-feeders were placed in Coerebidae (honeycreepers), large-billed seed-eaters in Cardinalidae (cardinals and grosbeaks), smaller-billed seed-eaters in Emberizidae (New World finches and sparrows), ground-foraging insect-eaters in Icteridae (blackbirds) and fruit-eaters in Thraupidae. This classification was known to be problematic as analyses using other morphological characteristics often produced conflicting phylogenies. Beginning in the last decade of the 20th century, a series of molecular phylogenetic studies led to a complete reorganization of the traditional families. Thraupidae now includes large-billed seed eaters, thin-billed nectar feeders, and foliage gleaners as well as fruit-eaters.

One consequence of redefining the family boundaries is that for many species their common names are no longer congruent with the families in which they are placed. As of July 2020 there are 39 species with &quot;tanager&quot; in the common name that are not placed in Thraupidae. These include the widely distributed scarlet tanager and western tanager, which are both now placed in Cardinalidae. There are also 106 species within Thraupidae that have &quot;finch&quot; in their common name.

A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014 revealed that many of the traditional genera were not monophyletic. In the resulting reorganization six new genera were introduced, eleven genera were resurrected, and seven genera were abandoned.

As of July 2023 the family contains 386 species which are divided into 15 subfamilies and 105 genera. For a complete list, see the article List of tanager species.

===List of genera===
====Catamblyrhynchinae====
The plushcap has no close relatives and is now placed in its own subfamily. It was previously placed either in the subfamily Catamblyrhynchinae within the Emberizidae or in its own family Catamblyrhynchidae.
====Charitospizinae====
The coal-crested finch is endemic to the grasslands of Brazil and has no close relatives. It is unusual in that both sexes have a crest. It was formerly placed in Emberizidae.

====Orchesticinae====
Two species with large thick bills. &quot;Parkerthraustes&quot; was formerly placed in Cardinalidae.
====Nemosiinae====
Brightly colored, sexually dichromatic birds. Most form single-species flocks.
====Emberizoidinae====
Grassland dwelling birds that were formerly placed in Emberizidae.

====Porphyrospizinae====
Yellow billed birds. The blue finch (&quot;Rhopospina caerulescens&quot;) was formerly placed in Cardinalidae; the other species were formerly placed in Emberizidae.

====Hemithraupinae====
These species are sexually dichromatic and many have yellow and black plumage. Except for &quot;Heterospingus&quot;, they have slender bills.

====Dacninae====
Sexually dichromatic species—males have blue plumage and females are green.

====Saltatorinae====
Mainly arboreal with long tails and thick bills. Formerly placed in Cardinalidae.

====Coerebinae====
This subfamily includes Darwin&#x27;s finches that are endemic to the Galápagos Islands and Cocos Island. Most of these species were formerly placed in Emberizidae; the exceptions are the bananaquit that was placed in Parulidae and the orangequit that was placed in Thraupidae. These species build domed or covered nests with side entrances. They have evolved a variety of foraging techniques, including nectar-feeding (&quot;Coereba&quot;, &quot;Euneornis&quot;), seed-eating (&quot;Geospiza&quot;, &quot;Loxigilla&quot;, &quot;Tiaris&quot;), and insect gleaning (&quot;Certhidea&quot;).

Darwin&#x27;s finches:
====Tachyphoninae====
Most of these are lowland species. Many have ornamental features such as crests, and many have sexually dichromatic plumage.

====Sporophilinae====
These species were formerly placed in Emberizidae.

====Poospizinae====
Some of these species were formerly placed in Emberizidae.

====Diglossinae====
This is a morphologically diverse group that includes seed-eaters (&quot;Nesospiza&quot;, &quot;Sicalis&quot;, &quot;Catamenia&quot;, &quot;Haplospiza&quot;), arthropod feeders (&quot;Conirostrum&quot;), a bamboo specialist (&quot;Acanthidops&quot;), an aphid feeder (&quot;Xenodacnis&quot;), and boulder field specialists (&quot;Idiopsar&quot;). Many species live at high altitudes. &quot;Conirostrum&quot; was previously placed in Parulidae, &quot;Diglossa&quot; was placed in Thraupidae, and the remaining genera were placed in Emberizidae.

====Thraupinae====
Typical tanagers.

<text>Iligan Bay is a bay in Mindanao Island in the Philippines. The bay is part of the Bohol Sea, and curves into the northern coast of Mindanao Island.

A branch of the bay, Panguil Bay, forms a natural isthmus with Illana Bay and geographic boundary between the Zamboanga Peninsula and the rest of Mindanao island.

The provinces covered along its coast are Misamis Occidental, Misamis Oriental, and Lanao del Norte.

Iligan City is the most important port on Iligan Bay. Other important ports are in Oroquieta City, Plaridel, Misamis Occidental and Lugait, Misamis Oriental. To protect Iligan Bay from destruction and biodiversity degradation, eight local government units and the provincial government of Misamis Occidental organized the Iligan Bay Alliance of Misamis Occidental.

<text>Ione Skye Lee (; born September 4, 1970) is a British-American actress. She made her film debut in the thriller &quot;River&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1986) before gaining mainstream exposure by starring in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s &quot;Say Anything...&quot; (1989). She continued to appear in films throughout the 1990s, with notable roles in &quot;Gas Food Lodging&quot; (1992), &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; (1992), and &quot;One Night Stand&quot; (1997).

Other film credits include the comedy &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; (2005) and an uncredited role in &quot;Zodiac&quot; (2007). Skye also guest-starred on several television series, including &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (2002), &quot;Private Practice&quot;, and a recurring role on &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. She is featured in the NBC series &quot;La Brea&quot; (2021).

In addition to acting, Skye paints and has written several children&#x27;s books. In 2006, VH1 ranked her 84th on its list of the 100 Greatest Teen Stars.

== Early life ==
Born in Hampstead, London, Skye is the daughter of folk singer-songwriter Donovan and model Enid Karl (née Stulberger). Her father is Scottish-born with some Irish ancestry and grew up in England. Her mother is an American who was raised in the Bronx, New York City, and is Jewish. Her second name comes from the Isle of Skye. She is the younger sister of Camp Freddy singer Donovan Leitch. Skye&#x27;s parents were separated at the time of her birth, and she was raised by her mother, having little to no contact with her father.

Skye grew up primarily in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and also spent time in Connecticut. She attended Immaculate Heart High School and Hollywood High School in Los Angeles.

== Career ==
Skye made her film debut with a supporting role in &quot;River&#x27;s Edge&quot; in 1986, followed by a role as the title character in &quot;The Rachel Papers&quot; (1989). She played Diane Court, a withdrawn high school valedictorian, in the 1989 film &quot;Say Anything...&quot;, the feature film debut of director Cameron Crowe; the film attained a cult following and lent Skye international recognition.

In 1992, she played Eleanor Grey on the short-lived television series &quot;Covington Cross&quot;, starred in Allison Anders&#x27;s debut feature film &quot;Gas Food Lodging&quot; (which also featured Skye&#x27;s brother Donovan Leitch), and had a supporting role in the Stephen La Rocque film &quot;Samantha&quot;. She subsequently had supporting roles as Elise in the comedy &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; (1992) and the Mike Figgis-directed drama &quot;One Night Stand&quot; (1997).

She later appeared in the music video for the Harvey Danger song &quot;Sad Sweetheart of the Rodeo.&quot; In 2007, Skye had a small, well-received part in the David Fincher film &quot;Zodiac&quot;.

In a 2010 interview with &quot;mondo-video.com&quot;, Skye said she had not paid perfect attention to her career arc over the years, saying she &quot;never struck when the iron was hot&quot; when it came to going after big Hollywood roles in her 20s.

In 2013, she appeared in a supporting part in the independent horror film &quot;Haunt&quot;, with Jacki Weaver. In 2016, Skye directed the music video for the Against Me! single &quot;333&quot;. The same year, she appeared in the short film &quot;Kitty&quot;, directed by Chloë Sevigny.

== Other ventures ==
Skye is a painter, and sells her own works. She also wrote the children&#x27;s book &quot;My Yiddish Vacation&quot;, published by Henry Holt and Company in May 2014. Skye has cited comic book artist Daniel Clowes as an inspiration for her painting and writing.

== Personal life ==
For several years, beginning when she was 16, Skye had a relationship with Red Hot Chili Peppers singer Anthony Kiedis.

In 1992, Skye married Adam Horovitz, a member of the Beastie Boys. They separated in 1995, got back together in 1996, and separated for good later that year and divorced in 2000.

Skye then had a relationship with furniture designer David Netto. They had a daughter, Kate, born in December 2001. Skye&#x27;s Hollywood home and Netto&#x27;s New York City apartment were featured in the February 2003 issue of &quot;Vogue&quot;. The two were engaged, but eventually separated.

In 2008, Skye became engaged to Australian musician Ben Lee. On December 29, 2008, Skye and Lee married in a Hindu wedding ceremony in India. They have a daughter, Goldie Priya, born September 24, 2009.

In a 2015 interview, Skye discussed her struggle with addiction, including bouts with alcoholism and other drug use.

<doc id="261384" wikidata="Q254240" url="?curid=261384" title="Rosamunde Pilcher">
<text>Rosamunde Pilcher, OBE (&quot;née&quot; Scott; 22 September 1924 – 6 February 2019) was a British novelist, best known for her sweeping novels set in Cornwall. Her books have sold over 60 million copies worldwide. Early in her career she was published under the pen name Jane Fraser. In 2001, she received the Corine Literature Prize&#x27;s Weltbild Readers&#x27; Prize for &quot;Winter Solstice&quot;.

==Personal life==
She was born Rosamunde Scott on 22 September 1924 in Lelant, Cornwall. Her parents were Helen (&quot;née&quot; Harvey) and Charles Scott, a British civil servant. Just before her birth her father was posted in Burma, while her mother remained in England. She attended the School of St. Clare in Penzance and Howell&#x27;s School Llandaff before going on to Miss Kerr-Sanders&#x27; Secretarial College. She began writing when she was seven, and published her first short story when she was 18.

From 1943 until 1946, Pilcher served with the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service. On 7 December 1946, she married Graham Hope Pilcher, a war hero and jute industry executive who died in March 2009. They moved to Dundee, Scotland. They had two daughters and two sons. Her son, Robin Pilcher, is also a novelist.

Pilcher died on 6 February 2019, at the age of 94, following a stroke.

==Writing career==
In 1949, Pilcher&#x27;s first book, a romance novel, was published by Mills and Boon, under the pseudonym Jane Fraser. She published a further ten novels under that name. In 1955, she also began writing under her real name with &quot;Secret to Tell&quot;. By 1965 she had dropped the pseudonym and was signing her own name to all of her novels.

The breakthrough in Pilcher&#x27;s career came in 1987, when she wrote the family saga &quot;The Shell Seekers&quot;, her fourteenth novel under her own name. It focuses on an elderly British woman, Penelope Keeling, who relives her life in flashbacks, and on her relationship with her adult children. Keeling&#x27;s life was not extraordinary, but it spans &quot;a time of huge importance and change in the world.&quot; The novel describes the everyday details of what life during World War II was like for some of those who lived in Britain. &quot;The Shell Seekers&quot; sold around ten million copies and was translated into more than forty languages. It was adapted for the stage by Terence Brady and Charlotte Bingham. Pilcher was said to be among the highest-earning women in Britain by the mid-1990s.

Her other major novels include &quot;September&quot; (1990), &quot;Coming Home&quot; (1995) and &quot;Winter Solstice&quot; (2000). &quot;Coming Home&quot; won the Romantic Novel of the Year Award by Romantic Novelists&#x27; Association in 1996. The president of the association in 2019, the romance writer Katie Fforde, considers Pilcher to be &quot;groundbreaking as she was the first to bring family sagas to the wider public&quot;. Felicity Bryan, in her obituary for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, writes that Pilcher took the romance genre to &quot;an altogether higher, wittier level&quot;; she praises Pilcher&#x27;s work for its &quot;grittiness and fearless observation&quot; and comments that it is often more prosaic than romantic.

Pilcher retired from writing in 2000. Two years later, in the 2002 New Year Honours, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to literature.

===TV adaptations===
Her books are especially popular in Germany because the national television station ZDF (Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen) has produced more than a hundred of her stories as TV movies, starting with &quot;The Day of the Storm&quot; in 1993. A complete list can be found on the German Wikipedia: Rosamunde Pilcher (Filmreihe). These television films are some of the most popular programmes on ZDF. Pilcher was awarded the British Tourism Award in 2002 for the positive effect the books and the adaptations have had on Cornish tourism. Notable film locations include Prideaux Place, a 16th-century mansion near Padstow.

<text>Panguil Bay is an arm of Iligan Bay in Mindanao, Philippines. The bay forms the natural boundary separating the Zamboanga Peninsula from the rest of the island of Mindanao. It borders the provinces of Misamis Occidental, Zamboanga del Sur, and Lanao del Norte. Important cities and municipalities on its coast are Ozamiz and Tangub in Misamis Occidental, and Tubod, the capital of Lanao del Norte.

The entrance to the bay is marked by a lighthouse on the west side of Panguil Bay, located on a headland on the eastern side of Ozamiz harbor. The high concrete tower has a focal plane of with two red flashes every 10 seconds.

The Panguil Bay Bridge is a two-lane bridge connecting Tangub to Tubod. The bridge reduces the travel time between Tangub and Tubod from 2.5 hours to 7 minutes. The -billion construction project started in 2020 and was opened on September 27, 2024.

==Geography==
Panguil Bay is about long, and has an area of with a coastline of . At its narrowest point between Tangub and Tubod, the bay is wide, while it is wide at the bay&#x27;s mouth. The bottom topography is irregular with an average depth of and a maximum depth of about .

There are 29 major and 46 minor river tributaries into the bay, originating from two mountain ranges. In total the bay has a catchment area of .

At the mouth of the bay, there are two coral reefs: the Hulaw-Hulaw Reef on Loculan Shoals near Clarin, Misamis Occidental, and the Maigo Reef near Maigo, Lanao del Norte. Both reefs experience high sedimentation rates and are in fair to poor condition.

==History==

In the 1750s, the Fuerte de la Concepcion y del Triunfo in the town of Misamis, (now the modern city of Ozamiz) was built by the Spanish to guard the entrance to Panguil Bay. At that time Moro pirate raids were at their peak, and the bay was described as a &quot;never ending source of Muslim pirates&quot;. In 1917, a lighthouse was built on the eastern bastion of the Spanish Fort.

==Ecology==
The bay was once a rich fishing ground, with the most abundant species being the gray mullet (&quot;Mugil cephalus&quot;), anchovy (&quot;Stolephorus commersonnii&quot;) and oil sardine (&quot;Sardinella longiceps&quot;). Other important species are penaeid shrimps and prawns, gobies, pony fishes, blue crabs, therapons, carangids, lantern fishes, and hairtails. In 1980, there were about 4,000 fishermen, increasing to over 9,800 in 1995.

Panguil Bay has suffered for decades from overfishing and destructive fishing practices. One of the biggest contributor of over-exploitation was the extensive use of filter nets, locally called &quot;sanggab&quot;. These nets trap all marine organisms, even macroplankton, depleting the food chain in the bay. Compared to 1984, the number of fish species dropped from 201 to 121 by the mid 1990s.

Further degradation resulted from destruction of natural habitats (such as mangroves turned into fishponds), pollution by poisonous chemicals, and increasing human development along the bay&#x27;s shore. The sharp decline in fish catch prompted rehabilitation efforts that included the removal of illegal fishing structures such as the filter nets that numbered in the thousands in the 2010s.

<text>Together We Stand, also known as Nothing Is Easy, is an American sitcom that aired on the CBS network from 1986 to 1987. It was written by Stephen Sustarsic and directed by Andrew D. Weyman.

&quot;Together We Stand&quot; is about a married couple, David (Elliott Gould) and Lori Randall (Dee Wallace), and their array of adopted children from all walks of life. According to producer Sherwood Schwartz, the plot for this show was originally written as a spin-off of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; called &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Kids&quot;. In the January 4, 1974, episode of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, also titled &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Kids&quot; (season 5, episode 14), which served as a backdoor pilot, the Bradys&#x27; neighbors plan to adopt one child but end up adopting three boys of different ethnicities.

==Summary==
David Randall (Elliott Gould) and his wife Lori (Dee Wallace) had two kids, adopted daughter Amy (Katie O&#x27;Neill) and biological son Jack (Scott Grimes). After seeing how well the Randall family did with an adopted child and a biological child, a pushy social worker (Edie McClurg) gives them two more children: an Asian-American boy named Sam (Ke Huy Quan) and a little African-American girl named Sally (Natasha Bobo). The story lines centered on the cultural differences and adjustments that had to be made by all: Sam and Sally having parents for the first time, and Jack and Amy competing with the new arrivals for their parents&#x27; time and affection. After six episodes, Gould&#x27;s character was killed off, and the series focused on Lori&#x27;s struggles as a single mother.

==Cast==
* Elliott Gould as David Randall (in &quot;Together We Stand&quot; only)
* Dee Wallace as Lori Randall
* Scott Grimes as Jack Randall
* Katie O&#x27;Neill as Amy Randall
* Ke Huy Quan as Sam Randall
* Natasha Bobo as Sally Randall
* Julia Migenes as Marion Simmons (in &quot;Nothing Is Easy&quot; only)

==Episodes==

===&quot;Together We Stand&quot; (1986)===
===&quot;Nothing Is Easy&quot; (1987)===
==Network run==
Premiering on Monday, September 22, 1986, at 8:30 PM ET after &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot; where its ratings were initially strong, &quot;Together We Stand&quot; moved to Wednesdays at 8:00 PM ET beginning on October 1 to make room for &quot;My Sister Sam&quot;, putting it up against ABC&#x27;s &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot; instead. When the show&#x27;s ratings plunged, CBS pulled the series after six episodes had aired.

The show returned three months later with a new title – &quot;Nothing Is Easy&quot; – new opening credits, a new time slot (Sundays at 9:30 PM ET, after &quot;Designing Women&quot; and up against movies on the other two networks), a new theme song, and a new cast member – Julia Migenes as bitter divorced neighbor Marion Simmons. Elliott Gould did not appear in the revamped series – his character was killed off in an automobile accident, and Dee Wallace-Stone continued on as a single mother. After two weeks in that time slot, it went on hiatus again for a month only to resurface on Fridays at 8:00 PM beginning on March 27, competing with ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Charmings&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Roomies&quot;. The revamp lasted only for a total of seven episodes before CBS cancelled it for good. The remaining six unaired episodes are not known to have aired anywhere.

<doc id="261396" wikidata="Q72296" url="?curid=261396" title="Man in the Iron Mask">
<text>The Man in the Iron Mask (; died 19 November 1703) was an unidentified prisoner of state during the reign of Louis XIV of France (1643–1715). The strict measures taken to keep his imprisonment secret resulted in a long-lasting legend about his identity. Warranted for arrest on 19 July 1669 under the pseudonym of &quot;Eustache Dauger&quot;, he was apprehended near Calais on 28 July, incarcerated on 24 August, and held for 34 years in the custody of the same jailer, , in four successive French prisons, including the Bastille. When he died there on 19 November 1703, his inhumation certificate bore the pseudonym of &quot;Marchioly&quot;, leading several historians to conclude the prisoner was Italian diplomat Ercole Antonio Mattioli.

His true identity remains a mystery, even though it has been extensively debated by historians, and various theories have been expounded in numerous books, articles, poems, plays, and films. During his lifetime, it was rumoured that he was a Marshal of France or a President of &quot;Parlement&quot;; the Duke of Beaufort, or a son of Oliver Cromwell, and some of these rumours were initiated by Saint-Mars himself. Among the oldest theories is one proposed by French philosopher and writer Voltaire, who claimed in his (1771) that the prisoner was an older, illegitimate brother of Louis XIV. Other writers similarly believed he was the King&#x27;s twin or younger brother. In all, more than 50 candidates, real and hypothetical, have been proposed by historians and other authors aiming to solve the mystery.

What little is known about the prisoner is based on contemporary documents uncovered during the 19th century, mainly some of the correspondence between and his superiors in Paris, initially Louvois, Louis XIV&#x27;s secretary of state for war. These documents show that the prisoner was labelled &quot;only a valet&quot; and that he was jailed for &quot;what he was employed to do&quot; before his arrest. Legend has it that no one ever saw his face, as it was hidden by a mask of black velvet cloth, later misreported by Voltaire as an iron mask. Official documents reveal, however, that the prisoner was made to cover his face only when travelling between prisons after 1687, or when going to prayers within the Bastille in the final years of his incarceration; modern historians believe the latter measure was imposed by Saint-Mars solely to increase his own prestige, thus causing persistent rumours to circulate about this seemingly important prisoner.

In 1932, French historian Maurice Duvivier proposed that the prisoner was Eustache Dauger de Cavoye, a nobleman associated with several political scandals of the late 17th century. This solution, however, was disproved in 1953 when previously unpublished family letters were discovered by another French historian, Georges Mongrédien, who concluded that the enigma remained unsolved owing to the lack of reliable historical documents about the prisoner&#x27;s identity and the cause of his long incarceration.

He has been the subject of many works of fiction, most prominently in 1850 by Alexandre Dumas. A section of his novel &quot;The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later&quot;—the final installment of his D&#x27;Artagnan saga—features this prisoner, portrayed as Louis XIV&#x27;s identical twin and forced to wear an iron mask. In 1840, Dumas had first presented a review of the popular theories about the prisoner extant in his time in the chapter &quot;&quot;, published in the eighth volume of his non-fiction . This approach was adopted by many subsequent authors, and speculative works have continued to appear on the subject.
==Prisoner==
===Arrest and imprisonment===

The earliest surviving records of the masked prisoner are from 19 July 1669, when Louis XIV&#x27;s minister, the Marquis de Louvois, sent a letter to Bénigne Dauvergne de Saint-Mars, governor of the prison of Pignerol (which at the time was part of France). In his letter, Louvois informed Saint-Mars that a prisoner named &quot;Eustache Dauger&quot; was due to arrive in the next month or so.

He instructed Saint-Mars to prepare a cell with multiple doors, one closing upon the other, which were to prevent anyone from the outside listening in. Saint-Mars was to see Dauger only once a day to provide food and whatever else he needed. Dauger was to be told that if he ever spoke of anything other than his immediate needs he would be killed, but, according to Louvois, the prisoner should not require much since he was &quot;only a valet&quot;. Historians have noted that the name Eustache Dauger was written in a handwriting different from that used in the rest of the letter&#x27;s text, suggesting that a clerk wrote the letter under Louvois&#x27; dictation, while someone else, very likely Louvois, added the name afterward.

Dauger was arrested by Captain Alexandre de Vauroy, garrison commander of Dunkerque, on 28 July and taken to Pignerol, where he arrived on 24 August. Evidence has been produced to suggest that the arrest was actually made in Calais and that not even the local governor was informed of the event—Vauroy&#x27;s absence being explained away by his hunting for Spanish soldiers who had strayed into France via the Spanish Netherlands. The first rumours of the prisoner&#x27;s identity (specifically as a Marshal of France) began to circulate at this point.

===Dauger serves as a valet===
The prison at Pignerol, like the others at which Dauger was later held, was used for men who were considered an embarrassment to the state and usually held only a handful of prisoners at a time. Saint-Mars&#x27;s other prisoners at Pignerol included Count Ercole Antonio Mattioli, an Italian diplomat who had been kidnapped and jailed for double-crossing the French over the purchase of the important fortress town of Casale on the Mantuan border. There was Nicolas Fouquet, Marquis of Belle-Île, a former superintendent of finances who had been jailed by Louis XIV on the charge of embezzlement, and the Marquis de Lauzun, who had become engaged to the Duchess of Montpensier, a cousin of the king, without the king&#x27;s consent. Fouquet&#x27;s cell was above that of Lauzun. In his letters to Louvois, Saint-Mars describes Dauger as a quiet man, giving no trouble, &quot;disposed to the will of God and to the king&quot;, compared to his other prisoners, who were always complaining, constantly trying to escape, or simply mad.

Dauger was not always isolated from the other prisoners. Wealthy and important ones usually had manservants; Fouquet, for instance, was served by a man called La Rivière. These servants, however, would become as much prisoners as their masters and it was thus difficult to find people willing to volunteer for such an occupation. Because La Rivière was often ill, Saint-Mars applied for permission for Dauger to act as servant for Fouquet. In 1675, Louvois gave permission for such an arrangement on condition that he was to serve Fouquet only while La Rivière was unavailable and that he was not to meet anyone else; for instance, if Fouquet and Lauzun were to meet, Dauger was not to be present. Fouquet was never expected to be released; thus, meeting Dauger was no great matter, but Lauzun was expected to be set free eventually, and it would have been important not to have him spread rumours of Dauger&#x27;s existence or of secrets he might have known. The important fact that Dauger served as a valet to Fouquet strongly indicates he was born a commoner.

On 23 November 1678, Louvois wrote directly to Fouquet to inform him that the King was disposed to soften considerably the strictures of his incarceration, subject to Fouquet writing back to Louvois—without informing Saint-Mars of the contents of his reply—concerning whether or not Dauger had talked to him, Fouquet, in front of La Rivière, &quot;about what he was employed to do before being brought to Pignerol&quot;. From this revealing letter, French historian Mongrédien concluded that Louvois was clearly anxious that any details about Dauger&#x27;s former employment should not leak out if the King decided to relax the conditions of Fouquet&#x27;s or Lauzun&#x27;s incarceration. 

After Fouquet&#x27;s death on 23 March 1680, Saint-Mars discovered a secret hole between Fouquet and Lauzun&#x27;s cells. He was sure that they had communicated through this hole without detection by him or his guards and thus that Lauzun must have been made aware of Dauger&#x27;s existence. On 8 April 1680, Louvois therefore wrote to Saint-Mars and instructed him to move Lauzun to Fouquet&#x27;s cell and to tell him that Dauger and La Rivière had been released, after secretly relocating them to a new cell in the lower tower of Pignerol&#x27;s dungeon. They became henceforth identified in official correspondence only as &quot;the two gentlemen of the lower tower&quot; (&quot;les messieurs de la tour d&#x27;en bas&quot;). After La Rivière died in early 1687, Dauger continued to be referred to as &quot;La Tour&quot; by prison staff and as the &quot;old prisoner&quot; (&quot;l&#x27;ancien prisonnier&quot;) in correspondence.

===Dauger&#x27;s subsequent prisons===
Lauzun was freed in 1681. Later that same year, Saint-Mars was appointed governor of the prison of the Exiles Fort (now Exilles in Italy). He went there, taking Dauger and La Rivière with him. La Rivière&#x27;s death was reported in January 1687; in May, Saint-Mars and Dauger moved to Sainte-Marguerite, one of the Lérins Islands, half a mile offshore from Cannes. It was during the journey to Sainte-Marguerite that rumours spread that the prisoner was wearing an iron mask. Again, he was placed in a cell with multiple doors.
On 18 September 1698, Saint-Mars took up his new post as governor of the Bastille prison in Paris, bringing Dauger with him. He was placed in a solitary cell in the prefurnished third chamber of the Bertaudière tower. The prison&#x27;s second-in-command, de Rosarges, was to feed him. Lieutenant du Junca, another officer of the Bastille, noted that the prisoner wore &quot;a mask of black velvet&quot;. The masked prisoner died there on 19 November 1703 and was buried the next day under the name of &quot;Marchioly&quot;.

==Candidates==

In the third edition (2004) of his book on the subject, French historian Jean-Christian Petitfils collated a list of 52 candidates, real or imagined, whose names had been either mentioned as rumours in contemporary documents, or proposed in printed works, between 1669 and 1992.

===Contemporary rumours===
A week after Dauger&#x27;s arrival at Pignerol, Saint-Mars wrote to Louvois (31 August 1669), reporting that the prisoner was rumoured to be a &quot;Marshall of France or President of &quot;Parlement&quot;&quot;. Eight months later, Saint-Mars informed Louvois (12 April 1670) that he initiated some of these rumours himself, when asked about the prisoner: &quot;I tell them tall tales to make fun of them.&quot;

A few months after Dauger was relocated to his new prison cell at the Île Sainte-Marguerite Fort in January 1687, Saint-Mars wrote to Louvois about the latest rumours (3 May 1687): &quot;Everyone tries to guess who my prisoner might be.&quot; On 4 September 1687, the &quot;Nouvelles Écclésiastiques&quot; published a letter by Nicolas Fouquet&#x27;s brother Louis, quoting a statement made by Saint-Mars: &quot;All the people that one believes dead are not&quot;, a hint that the prisoner was the Duke of Beaufort. Four months later, Saint-Mars reiterated this &quot;rumour&quot; in writing to Louvois (8 January 1688), adding: &quot;(...) others say that he is a son of the late Cromwell&quot;.

===English milord===
On 10 October 1711, King Louis XIV&#x27;s sister-in-law, Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine, sent a letter to her aunt, Sophia, Electress of Hanover, stating that the prisoner had &quot;two musketeers at his side to kill him if he removed his mask&quot;. She described him as very devout, and stated that he was well treated and received everything he desired. In another letter sent less than two weeks later, on 22 October, she added having just learnt that he was &quot;an English milord connected with the affair of the Duke of Berwick against King William III.&quot; The Princess was clearly reporting rumours she had heard at court.

===King&#x27;s relative===
Some of the most enduring theories about the prisoner&#x27;s identity, outlined in the sections below, assume that he was a relative of Louis XIV, because of the importance attached to secrecy during his incarceration which, in turn, fed the legend that he must have been one of the most important persons in the realm. These theories emerged during the 1700s, long before historians were able to consult the archives revealing that the prisoner was &quot;only a valet&quot;, imprisoned for &quot;what he was employed to do&quot;, and for &quot;what he knew&quot;. These early theories arose solely from their author&#x27;s imagination, and boosted the romantic appeal of a sensational elucidation of the enigma. Historians such as Mongrédien (1952) and Noone (1988), however, pointed out that the solution whereby Louis XIV is supposed to have had an illegitimate brother—whether older, twin, or younger—does not provide a credible explanation, for example, on how it would have been possible for Queen Anne of Austria to conceal a pregnancy throughout its full course and bear, then deliver, a child in secret. Mongrédien concluded that &quot;historians cannot give it the slightest credence.&quot;
====King&#x27;s illegitimate son====
In 1745, an anonymous writer published a book in Amsterdam, &quot;Mémoires pour servir à l&#x27;Histoire de la Perse&quot;, romanticising life at the French Court in the form of Persian history. Members of the royal family and locations were given fictitious Persian names, and their key was published in the book&#x27;s third edition (1759). In this tale, Louis XIV&#x27;s illegitimate son, Louis, Count of Vermandois, is alleged to have struck his half-brother, Louis, Grand Dauphin, causing the King to banish him to life imprisonment, first at the Île Sainte-Marguerite and later at the Bastille. He was made to wear a mask whenever he was to be seen or attended to, when sick or in other circumstances. The theory of Vermandois as the prisoner in the mask was later mentioned by Henri Griffet, in 1769, as having circulated during the reign of Louis XIV, therefore long before 1745.

In reality, there are no historical records of gossip confirming that Vermandois ever struck the Grand Dauphin. In the memoirs of Louis XIV&#x27;s first cousin, the Duchess of Montpensier, there is mention of Vermandois having displeased the King for taking part in orgies in 1682, and being temporarily banished from court as a result. After promising to mend his way, he was sent—soon after his 16th birthday—to join the army in Courtrai during the War of the Reunions (1683–84), in early November 1683. He distinguished himself in the battle line, but died of a fever during the night of 17 November. The King was reported to be deeply affected by his son&#x27;s death, and Vermandois&#x27; sister, Marie Anne de Bourbon, was inconsolable while their mother, Louise de La Vallière, sought solace in endless prayer at her Carmelites convent in Paris.

====King&#x27;s elder brother====
During his two sojourns in the Bastille in 1717–18 and 1726, Voltaire became aware of the traditions and legends circulating among the staff at the fortress. On 30 October 1738, he wrote to the Abbé Dubos: &quot;I am somewhat knowledgeable about the adventure of the Man in the Iron Mask, who died at the Bastille; I spoke to people who had served him.&quot; In the second edition of his (1771), Voltaire claimed that the prisoner was an illegitimate first son of Anne of Austria and an unknown father, and therefore an older half-brother of Louis XIV. This assertion was partly based on the historical fact that the birth of Louis XIV on 5 September 1638 had come as a surprise: since Louis XIII and Anne of Austria had been childless for 23 years, it was believed they were unable to conceive, despite evidence to the contrary of the Queen&#x27;s well-known miscarriages. In fact, the royal couple had been living for years in mutual distrust and had become estranged since the mid-1620s. Furthermore, in August 1637, the Queen had been found guilty of treasonable correspondence with Spain and had been placed under house arrest at the Louvre Palace. However, contemporary accounts nonetheless indicate that the royal couple shared a bed and conceived the future Louis XIV, either in early December 1637 or, as historians deem more likely, sometime during the previous month. The Queen&#x27;s pregnancy was made public on 30 January 1638.

Based on the assumption that the royal couple were unable to conceive, Voltaire theorised that an earlier, secret birth of an illegitimate child persuaded the Queen that she was not infertile, in turn prompting Cardinal Richelieu to arrange an outing during which the royal couple had to share a bed, which led to the birth of Louis XIV.

The theme of an imagined elder brother of Louis XIV resurfaced in 1790, when French historian Pierre-Hubert Charpentier asserted that the prisoner was an illegitimate son of Anne of Austria and George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, supposedly born in 1626, two years before the latter&#x27;s death. Louis XIV was presumed to have had this elder brother imprisoned upon the Queen&#x27;s death in 1666. According to Charpentier, this theory had originated with a certain Mademoiselle de Saint-Quentin, a mistress of the Marquess of Barbezieux, son of Louvois and his successor as War Minister to Louis XIV in 1691. A few days before his sudden death on 5 January 1701, Barbezieux had told her the secret of the prisoner&#x27;s identity, which she disclosed publicly to several people in Chartres towards the end of her life in the mid-1700s. Charpentier also stated that Voltaire had heard this version in Geneva, but chose to omit Buckingham&#x27;s name when he began to develop his own variant of this theory in the first edition of &quot;The Age of Louis XIV&quot; (1751), finally revealed in full in (1771).

====King&#x27;s twin brother====
Many authors supported the theory of the prisoner being a twin brother of King Louis XIV: Michel de Cubières (1789), Jean-Louis Soulavie (1791), Las Cases (1816), Victor Hugo (1839), Alexandre Dumas (1840), Paul Lecointe (1847), and others. 

In a 1965 essay, &quot;Le Masque de fer&quot; (revised in 1973 under the title &quot;Le secret du Masque de Fer&quot;), French novelist and playwright Marcel Pagnol, proposing his hypothesis in particular on the circumstances of Louis XIV&#x27;s birth, claimed that the Man in the Iron Mask was indeed a twin brother, but born second, who would have been hidden in order to avoid any dispute over the throne holder. At the time, there was a controversy over which one of twins was the elder: the one born first, or the one born second, who was then thought to have been conceived first.

Historians who reject this hypothesis (including Jean-Christian Petitfils) highlight the conditions of childbirth for the queen: it usually took place in the presence of multiple witnesses—the main court&#x27;s figures. According to Pagnol, immediately after the birth of the future Louis XIV at 11 a.m. on 5 September 1638, Louis XIII took his whole court (about 40 people) to the &quot;Château de Saint-Germain&quot;&#x27;s chapel to celebrate a &quot;Te Deum&quot; in great pomp, contrary to the common practice of celebrating it several days before childbirth. Pagnol contends that the court&#x27;s removal to this &quot;Te Deum&quot; had been rushed to enable the queen to deliver the second twin in secret and attended only by the midwife. 

Pagnol&#x27;s solution—combining earlier theories by Soulavie (1790), Andrew Lang (1903), Arthur Barnes (1908), and Edith Carey (1924)—speculates that this twin was born a few hours after Louis XIV and grew up on the Island of Jersey under the name James de la Cloche, believing himself to be an illegitimate son of Charles II. During a hypothetical, secret meeting in January 1669, Charles is assumed to have recognised the twin for his resemblance to the French king and revealed to him his true identity. Shortly thereafter, the twin would supposedly have adopted the new identity of &quot;Martin&quot; as a valet to Roux de Marcilly, with whom he conspired against Louis XIV, which led to his arrest in Calais in July 1669. Historically, however, the real valet Martin (distinct from Pagnol&#x27;s reinterpreted &quot;Martin&quot;) could not have become &quot;Eustache Dauger&quot; because he had fled to London when the Roux conspiracy failed; this is well known because his extradition from England to France had at first been requested by Foreign Minister Hugues de Lionne on 12 June 1669, but subsequently cancelled by him on 13 July. Pagnol explained this historical fact away by claiming, without any evidence, that &quot;Martin&quot; must have been secretly abducted in London in early July and transported to France on 7 or 8 July, and that the extradition order had therefore been cancelled because it was no longer necessary, its objective having already been achieved.

====King&#x27;s younger brother====
In 1791, Jean Baptiste De Saint-Mihiel proposed that the prisoner was an illegitimate younger brother of Louis XIV, fathered by Cardinal Mazarin. This theory was based on the fact, mentioned by Voltaire in (1771), that the prisoner had told his doctor that he &quot;believed himself to be about 60 years old&quot;, a few days before his death in 1703. De Saint-Mihiel extrapolated that the prisoner was therefore born around 1643, and could therefore only be a younger brother to the King, born in 1638. It is a historical fact that, four days after Louis XIII&#x27;s death on 14 May 1643, the Queen was declared Regent and appointed Mazarin as her chief minister and head of government that evening. Mazarin was soon believed to be her lover, and even her secret morganatic husband. The theory of the prisoner being an imagined, younger son of the Queen and Mazarin was rekindled in 1868 by Charles-Henri, baron de Gleichen.

====King&#x27;s father====
In 1955, Hugh Ross Williamson argued that the Man in the Iron Mask was the natural father of Louis XIV. According to this theory, the &quot;miraculous&quot; birth of Louis XIV in 1638 would have come after Louis XIII had been estranged from his wife Anne of Austria for 14 years.

The theory then suggests that Cardinal Richelieu had arranged for a substitute, probably an illegitimate grandson of Henry IV, to become intimate with the queen and father an heir in the king&#x27;s stead. At the time, the heir presumptive was Louis XIII&#x27;s brother Gaston, Duke of Orléans, who was Richelieu&#x27;s enemy. If Gaston became king, Richelieu would quite likely have lost both his job as minister and his life, and so it was in his best interests to thwart Gaston&#x27;s ambitions.

Supposedly, the substitute father then left for the Americas but returned to France in the 1660s with the aim of extorting money for keeping his secret and was promptly imprisoned. This theory would explain the secrecy surrounding the prisoner, whose true identity would have destroyed the legitimacy of Louis XIV&#x27;s claim to the throne had it been revealed.

This theory had been suggested by British politician Hugh Cecil, 1st Baron Quickswood, who nonetheless added that the idea has no historical basis and is entirely hypothetical. Williamson held that: &quot;to say it is a guess with no solid historical basis is merely to say that it is like every other theory on the matter, although it makes more sense than any of the other theories. There is no known evidence that is incompatible with it, even the age of the prisoner, which Cecil had considered a weak point; and it explains every aspect of the mystery.&quot; His time spent as a valet to another prisoner renders this idea doubtful, however.

===Italian diplomat===
Another candidate, much favoured in the 1800s, was Fouquet&#x27;s fellow prisoner Count Ercole Antonio Mattioli ( Matthioli). He was an Italian diplomat who acted on behalf of the debt-ridden Charles IV, Duke of Mantua in 1678, in selling Casale, a strategic fortified town near the border with France. A French occupation would be unpopular, so discretion was essential, but Mattioli leaked the details to France&#x27;s Spanish enemies after pocketing his commission once the sale had been concluded, and they made a bid of their own before the French forces could occupy the town. Mattioli was kidnapped by the French and thrown into nearby Pignerol in April 1679. The French took possession of Casale two years later.

George Agar-Ellis reached the conclusion that Mattioli was the Man in the Iron Mask when he reviewed documents extracted from French archives in the 1820s. His book, published in English in 1826, was translated into French and published in 1830. German historian Wilhelm Broecking came to the same conclusion independently seventy years later. Robert Chambers&#x27; &quot;Book of Days&quot; supports the claim and places Matthioli in the Bastille for the last 13 years of his life. Since that time, letters sent by Saint-Mars, which earlier historians missed, indicate that Mattioli was held only at Pignerol and Sainte-Marguerite and was not at Exilles or the Bastille and, therefore, it is argued that he can be discounted.

===French general===
In 1890, Louis Gendron, a French military historian, came across some coded letters and passed them on to Étienne Bazeries in the French Army&#x27;s cryptographic department. After three years, Bazeries managed to read some messages in the Great Cipher of Louis XIV. One of them referred to a prisoner and identified him as General Vivien de Bulonde. One of the letters written by Louvois made specific reference to de Bulonde&#x27;s crime.

At the Siege of Cuneo in 1691, Bulonde was concerned about enemy troops arriving from Austria and ordered a hasty withdrawal, leaving behind his munitions and wounded men. Louis XIV was furious and in another of the letters specifically ordered him &quot;to be conducted to the fortress at Pignerol where he will be locked in a cell and under guard at night, and permitted to walk the battlements during the day with a 330 309.&quot; It has been suggested that the 330 stood for &quot;masque&quot; and the 309 for full stop. However, in 17th-century French &quot;avec un masque&quot; would mean &quot;in a mask&quot;.

Some believe that the evidence of the letters means that there is now little need for an alternative explanation of the man in the mask. Other sources, however, claim that Bulonde&#x27;s arrest was no secret and was actually published in a newspaper at the time. Bulonde was released by order of the king on 11 December 1691. His death is also recorded as happening in 1709, six years after that of the man in the mask.

===Son of Charles II===
In 1908, Monsignor Arthur Barnes proposed that the prisoner was James de la Cloche, the alleged illegitimate son of the reluctant Protestant Charles II of England, who would have been his father&#x27;s secret intermediary with the Catholic court of France. One of Charles&#x27;s confirmed illegitimate sons, the Duke of Monmouth, has also been proposed as the man in the mask. A Protestant, he led a rebellion against his uncle, the Catholic King James II. The rebellion failed and Monmouth was executed in 1685. However, in 1768, a writer named Saint-Foix claimed that another man was executed in his place and that Monmouth became the masked prisoner, it being in Louis XIV&#x27;s interests to assist a fellow Catholic like James, who would not necessarily want to kill his own nephew. Saint-Foix&#x27;s case was based on unsubstantiated rumours and allegations that Monmouth&#x27;s execution was faked.

===Eustache Dauger de Cavoye===
In his letter to Saint-Mars announcing the imminent arrival of the prisoner who would become the Man in the Iron Mask, Louvois gave his name as &quot;Eustache Dauger&quot;. Historically, this was deemed to be a prison pseudonym, and a succession of historians therefore attempted to find out the prisoner&#x27;s real identity. Among them, Maurice Duvivier (1932) wondered if, instead, &quot;Eustache Dauger&quot; might not be the real name of a person whose life and history could be traced; he therefore combed the archives for surnames such as Dauger, Daugers, d&#x27;Auger, d&#x27;Oger, d&#x27;Ogiers and similar forms. He discovered the family of François d&#x27;Oger de Cavoye, a captain of Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s guard of musketeers, who was married to Marie de Sérignan, a lady-in-waiting at the court of Louis XIV&#x27;s mother, Queen Anne of Austria. François and Marie had 11 children, of whom six boys and three girls survived into adulthood.

Their third son was named Eustache, who signed his name as &quot;Eustache Dauger de Cavoye&quot;. He was born on 30 August 1637 and baptised on 18 February 1639. When his father and two eldest brothers were killed in battle, Eustache became the nominal head of the family. In his 1932 book, Duvivier published evidence that this man had been involved in scandalous and embarrassing events, first in 1659, then again in 1665, and speculated that he had also been linked with &quot;l&#x27;Affaire des Poisons&quot;.

====Disgrace====
In April 1659, Eustache Dauger de Cavoye and others were invited by the duke of Vivonne to an Easter weekend party at the castle of Roissy-en-Brie. By all accounts, it was a debauched affair of merry-making, with the men involved in all sorts of sordid activities, including attacking an elderly man who claimed to be Cardinal Mazarin&#x27;s attorney. It was also rumoured, among other things, that a black mass was enacted and that a pig was baptised as &quot;Carp&quot; in order to allow them to eat pork on Good Friday.

When news of these events became public, an inquiry was held and the various perpetrators jailed or exiled. There is no record as to what happened to Dauger de Cavoye but, in 1665, near the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, he allegedly killed a young page boy in a drunken brawl involving the Duc de Foix. The two men claimed that they had been provoked by the boy, who was drunk, but the fact that the killing took place close to where Louis XIV was staying at the time meant that this crime was deemed a personal affront to the king and, as a result, Dauger de Cavoye was forced to resign his commission. His mother died shortly afterwards. In her will, written a year earlier, she passed over her eldest surviving sons Eustache and Armand, leaving the bulk of the estate to their younger brother Louis. Eustache was restricted in the amount of money to which he had access, having built up considerable debts, and left with barely enough for &quot;food and upkeep&quot;.

====Affair of the Poisons====

In his 1932 book, Duvivier also linked Eustache Dauger de Cavoye to the Affair of the Poisons, a notorious scandal of 1677–1682 in which people in high places were accused of being involved in black mass and poisonings. An investigation had been launched, but Louis XIV instigated a cover-up when it appeared that his mistress Madame de Montespan was involved. The records show that, during the inquiry, the investigators were told about a surgeon named Auger, who had supplied poisons for a black mass that took place before March 1668. Duvivier became convinced that Dauger de Cavoye, disinherited and short of money, had become Auger, the supplier of poisons, and subsequently &quot;Eustache Dauger&quot;.

In a letter sent by Louvois to Saint-Mars on 10 July 1680, a few months after Fouquet&#x27;s death in prison while &quot;Eustache Dauger&quot; was acting as his valet, the minister adds a note in his own handwriting, asking how it was possible that Dauger had made certain objects found in Fouquet&#x27;s pockets—which Saint-Mars had mentioned in a previous correspondence, now lost—and &quot;how he got the drugs necessary to do so&quot;. Duvivier suggested that Dauger had poisoned Fouquet as part of a complex power struggle between Louvois and his rival Colbert.

====Dauger de Cavoye in prison at Saint-Lazare====
In 1953, however, French historian Georges Mongrédien published historical documents confirming that, in 1668, Eustache Dauger de Cavoye was already held at the Prison Saint-Lazare in Paris—an asylum, run by monks, which many families used in order to imprison their &quot;black sheep&quot;—and that he was still there in 1680, at the same time that &quot;Eustache Dauger&quot;, was in custody in Pignerol, hundreds of miles away in the south. These documents include a letter dated 20 June 1678, full of self-pity, sent by Dauger de Cavoye to his sister, the Marquise de Fabrègues, in which he complains about his treatment in prison, where he had already been held &quot;for more than 10 years&quot;, and how he was deceived by their brother Louis and by Clérac, their brother-in-law and the manager of Louis&#x27;s estate. 

Dauger de Cavoye also wrote a second letter, this time to the King but undated, outlining the same complaints and requesting his freedom. The best the King would do, however, was to send a letter to the head of Saint-Lazare on 17 August 1678, telling him that &quot;M. de Cavoye should have communication with no one at all, not even with his sister, unless in your presence or in the presence of one of the priests of the mission&quot;. The letter was signed by the King and Colbert. A poem written by Louis-Henri de Loménie de Brienne, an inmate in Saint-Lazare at the time, indicates that Eustache Dauger de Cavoye died as a result of heavy drinking in the late 1680s. Historians consider all this proof enough that he was not involved in any way with the man in the mask.

===Valet===
In 1890, French historian Jules Lair published an extensive, two-volume biography of Nicolas Fouquet in which he relates Eustache Dauger&#x27;s arrival at Pignerol in August 1669, his subsequent role as Fouquet&#x27;s valet, and their secret interactions with Lauzun. Lair believed that &quot;Eustache Dauger&quot; was the new prisoner&#x27;s real name, that he was French, catholic and a professional valet who had been employed for a specific task which was never clarified: &quot;he was probably one of these men tasked with a shady mission—such as the removal of documents or kidnapping, or perhaps worse—and whose silence is secured by death or imprisonment once the deed is done.&quot; Lair also conjectured an explanation for Louvois&#x27;s obsessive insistence that Dauger and Lauzun should be kept apart at all times, by reference to the fact that Dauger was arrested near Dunkirk during the negotiations of the Secret Treaty of Dover, in which Lauzun had also participated. Lair asserted that the two men knew each other or, at the very least, had been aware of each other. 

In 2016, American historian Paul Sonnino speculated that Eustache Dauger could have been a valet of Cardinal Mazarin&#x27;s treasurer, Antoine-Hercule Picon. A native of Languedoc, Picon, upon entering the service of Colbert after Mazarin&#x27;s death, might have picked up a valet from Senlis, where the name &quot;Dauger&quot; abounds. In his book, Sonnino asserts that Mazarin led a double life, &quot;one as a statesman, the other as a loan shark&quot;, and that one of the clients he embezzled was Henrietta Maria, the widow of Charles I of England. According to Sonnino&#x27;s theory, Louis XIV was complicit and instructed his ambassador in England to stonewall Charles II over the return of his parents&#x27; possessions. In 1669, however, Louis wanted to enlist Charles in a war against the Dutch and therefore worried about the subject of Mazarin&#x27;s estate entering into the negotiations. Sonnino concludes by stating that Eustache Dauger, who might have been Picon&#x27;s valet, was arrested and incarcerated for revealing something about the disposition of Mazarin&#x27;s fortune, and that this is why he was threatened with death if he disclosed anything about his past.

In 2021, British historian Josephine Wilkinson mentioned the theory proposed by French historian Bernard Caire in 1987, whereby &quot;Eustache&quot; was not the prisoner&#x27;s first name but his real surname. Since French historian Jean-Christian Petitfils had earlier asserted that &quot;Dauger&quot; was a misspelling of &quot;Danger&quot; (or d&#x27;Angers), Caire suggested that this appellation was used to indicate the prisoner originated from the town of Angers. Wilkinson also supported the theory proposed by Petitfils—and by Jules Lair in 1890—that, as a valet (perhaps to Henrietta of England), this &quot;Eustache&quot; had committed some indiscretion which risked compromising the relations between Louis XIV and Charles II at a sensitive time during the negotiations of the Secret Treaty of Dover against the Dutch Republic. In July 1669, Louis had suddenly and inexplicably fallen out with Henrietta and, since the two had previously been very close, it did not go unnoticed. Wilkinson therefore suggested a link between this event and this valet&#x27;s arrest in Calais later that month.

==Historical documents and archives==
===History of the Bastille archives===
When the Bastille was stormed on 14 July 1789, the mob were surprised to find only seven prisoners, as well as a room full of neatly kept boxes containing documents that had been carefully filed since 1659. These archives held records, not only of all the prisoners who had been incarcerated there, but also of all the individuals who had been locked up, banished into exile, or simply tried within the limits of Paris as a result of a &quot;lettre de cachet&quot;. Throughout the 18th century, archivists had been working zealously at keeping these records in good order and which, on the eve of the French revolution, had amounted to hundreds of thousands of documents.

As the fortress was being ransacked, the pillaging lasted for two days during which documents were burned, torn, thrown from the top of towers into the moats and trailed through the mud. Many documents were stolen, or taken away by collectors, writers, lawyers, and even by Pierre Lubrowski, an attaché in the Russian embassy—who sold them to emperor Alexander I in 1805, when they were deposited at the Hermitage Palace—and many ended up dispersed throughout France and the rest of Europe. A company of soldiers was posted on 15 July to guard the fortress and, in particular, to prevent any more looting of the archives. On 16 July, the Electoral Assembly created a commission assigned to rescue the archives; on arrival at the fortress, they found that many boxes had been emptied or destroyed, leaving an enormous pile of papers in a complete state of disorder. During the session of 24 July, the Electoral Assembly passed a resolution enjoining citizens to return documents to the Hôtel de Ville; restitutions were numerous and the surviving documents eventually stored at the city&#x27;s library, then located at the convent of Saint-Louis-de-la-Culture.

On 22 April 1797, Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon was appointed chief librarian of the Bibliothèque de l&#x27;Arsenal and obtained a decree that secured the Bastille archive under his care. However, the librarians were so daunted by this volume of 600,000 documents that they stored them in a backroom, where they languished for over forty years. In 1840, François Ravaisson found a mass of old papers under the floor in his kitchen at the Arsenal library and realised he had rediscovered the archives of the Bastille, which required a further fifty years of laborious restoration; the documents were numbered, and a catalogue was compiled and published as the 20th century was about to dawn. Eventually, the archives of the Bastille were made available for consultation by any visitor to the Arsenal library, in rooms specially fitted up for them.

===Other archives===
In addition to the Bibliothèque de l&#x27;Arsenal, several other archives host historical documents that were consulted by historians researching the enigma of the Man in the Iron Mask: the Archives of the Foreign Ministry (Archives des Affaires étrangères),
the Archives Nationales, 
the Bibliothèque nationale de France,
the Sainte-Geneviève Library,
and the Service Historique de la Défense ( Anciennes Archives de la Guerre).

===Historians of the Man in the Iron Mask===

In his historical essay published in 1965 and expanded in 1973, Marcel Pagnol praised a number of historians who consulted the archives with the goal of elucidating the enigma of the Man in the Iron Mask: Joseph Delort (1789–1847), Marius Topin (1838–1895), Théodore Iung (1833–1896), Maurice Duvivier (18??–1936), and Georges Mongrédien (1901–1980). Along with Pierre Roux-Fazillac (1746–1833), François Ravaisson (1811–1884), Jules Loiseleur (1816–1900), Jules Lair (1836–1907), and Frantz Funck-Brentano (1862–1947), these historians uncovered and published the bulk of historical documents that enabled some progress to be made towards that goal.

In particular, Mongrédien was the first to publish (1952) a complete reference of historical documents on which previous authors had relied only selectively. He was also one of the few historians who did not champion any particular candidate, preferring instead to review and analyse objectively the facts revealed by the documents. Giving full credit to Jules Lair for being the first to propose the candidacy of &quot;Eustache Dauger&quot; in 1890, Mongrédien demonstrated that, among all the state prisoners who were ever in the care of Saint-Mars, only the one arrested under that pseudonym in 1669 could have died in the Bastille in 1703, and was therefore the only possible candidate for the man in the mask. Although he also pointed out that no documents had yet been found that revealed either the real identity of this prisoner or the cause of his long incarceration, Mongrédien&#x27;s work was significant in that it made it possible to eliminate all the candidates whose vital dates, or life circumstances for the period of 1669–1703, were already known to modern historians.

In October 1965, Mongrédien published a review, in the journal &quot;La Revue des Deux Mondes&quot;, of the first edition of Pagnol&#x27;s essay. At the end of this review, Mongrédien mentioned being told that the Archives of the Ministry of Defense located at the Château de Vincennes still held unsorted and uncatalogued bundles of Louvois&#x27;s correspondence. He speculated that, if this were the case, then these bundles might contain a letter from July 1669 revealing the reasons for &quot;Eustache Daugers arrest near Dunkirk.

==In popular culture==
===Literature===
In addition to being the subject of scholarly research carried out by historians, the Man in the Iron Mask inspired literary works of fiction, many of which elaborate on the legend of the prisoner being a twin brother of Louis XIV, such as Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s popular novel, &quot;Le Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot; (1850).

===Film and television=== 

Several films have been made around the mystery of the Man in the Iron Mask, including: 
&quot;The Iron Mask&quot; (1929) starring Douglas Fairbanks;
&quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (1939) starting Louis Hayward;
the British television production starring Richard Chamberlain (1977); and
the American film starring Leonardo DiCaprio (1998). These films were all loosely adapted from Dumas&#x27; book &quot;The Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot;, where the prisoner was an identical twin of Louis XIV and made to wear an iron mask, per the legend created by Voltaire.

The Man in the Iron Mask is portrayed as the Duc de Sullun (inversion of &quot;nullus&quot;, Latin for &#x27;no one&#x27;) in the first two episodes of the third season of the TV drama series &quot;Versailles&quot;. In the program, he is visited in the Bastille by Philippe I, Duke of Orléans on his search to find men to send to the Americas and is revealed to be the secret biological father of Louis XIV and Philippe I due to the inability of Louis XIII to produce an heir.

In &quot;What If... the Avengers Assembled in 1602?&quot;, the eighth episode of the second season of the Marvel Cinematic Universe Disney+ series &quot;What If...?&quot;, the Man in the Iron Mask is a variant of Bruce Banner, who is freed by Captain Peggy Carter, breaking the iron mask after transforming into the Hulk.

In the Japanese manga &quot;One Piece&quot;, one of the protagonists, Sanji, was imprisoned during childhood and forced to wear an iron mask, resembling the story of the French prisoner.

In the second season of the television show &quot;The Flash&quot; in 2014, the Man in the Iron Mask is held hostage by &quot;Hunter Zolomon&quot;/Zoom, who pretends to be the superhero &quot;Flash&quot;. The Man in the Iron Mask is eventually revealed to be the real Jay Garrick of his universe, and a doppelganger of Henry Allen, Barry Allen/The Flash&#x27;s father.

<text>Randall Wallace (born July 28, 1949) is an American screenwriter, film director and producer who came to prominence by writing the screenplay for the historical drama film &quot;Braveheart&quot; (1995). His work on the film earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and a Writers Guild of America Award in the same category. He has since directed films such as &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (1998), &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; (2002), &quot;Secretariat&quot; (2010) and &quot;Heaven Is for Real&quot; (2014).

==Early life and education==
Born in Jackson, Tennessee, he lived in Memphis and Henderson County, Tennessee before moving to Virginia. Wallace began writing stories at the age of seven. He graduated from E.C. Glass High School in Lynchburg, Virginia and attended Duke University, where he studied Russian, religion, and literature and was a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He put himself through a graduate year of seminary by teaching martial arts. Wallace holds a black belt in karate.

==Career==
After managing an animal show at Nashville&#x27;s Opryland, Wallace moved to Hollywood to pursue a career in singing and songwriting. He began writing short stories, novels and scripts for movies. Wallace was taken under the wing of leading television producer Stephen J. Cannell and spent several years writing for television in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

He gained recognition and commercial success by penning the screenplay for &quot;Braveheart&quot; (1995), which was inspired by a trip to Scotland to learn more about his Scottish roots. While there, he discovered the legend of the medieval Scottish patriot William Wallace; he is not, however, related to William Wallace in any way. &quot;Braveheart&quot; became Wallace&#x27;s first screenplay to be produced, after drawing the interest of Mel Gibson, who went on to produce, direct and star in the film. It ended up as one of the most successful films of 1995, earning over $200 million. It was nominated for ten Academy Awards, including a Best Original Screenplay nomination for Wallace, and won five, including the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. &quot;Braveheart&quot; also won one Golden Globe Award and four BAFTA Awards.

Wallace made his directorial debut with his own screenplay in &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (1998), starring Leonardo DiCaprio, John Malkovich, Gabriel Byrne, Jeremy Irons and Gérard Depardieu. Shortly after, he wrote the screenplay for &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001), directed by Michael Bay and starring Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale.

This was followed by Wallace&#x27;s second film as director &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; (2002), on which Wallace re-teamed with Mel Gibson. It was about the Battle of Ia Drang (1965) during the Vietnam War, based on the memoir by Lieutenant General Hal Moore.

Wallace directed Disney&#x27;s &quot;Secretariat&quot; (2010), the true story of the racehorse that won the Triple Crown in 1973. The film chronicled the struggles and courage of owner Penny Chenery-Tweedy, portrayed by Academy Award-nominated actress Diane Lane. Wallace also wrote the end title song, &quot;It&#x27;s Who You Are&quot;, which was released with the &quot;Secretariat&quot; soundtrack.

Wallace&#x27;s next directorial project was the religious drama &quot;Heaven Is for Real&quot; (2014), based on the story of the same name. In June 2016, Wallace stated that he and Gibson had begun work on a sequel to &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; (2004), which will focus on the resurrection of Jesus, and the events surrounding the resurrection.

==Other work==
Wallace is the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling author of seven novels and the lyricist of the hymn &quot;Mansions of the Lord&quot;, originally written for &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; and performed as the recessional for President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s national funeral.

In 2008, Wallace wrote several songs with singer/songwriter Richard Marx. One of those songs, &quot;Flame In Your Fire&quot;, appears on Marx&#x27;s album &quot;Emotional Remains&quot;.

In interviews he has acknowledged a deep commitment to Christianity, which he credits as an influence on his approach to filmmaking.

He appeared in the seventh season episode 3 &quot;Dramedy&quot; of HBO&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Entourage&quot; as himself.

In addition to his work as a filmmaker, Wallace is the founder of Hollywood for Habitat for Humanity and the father of two sons. In 1999, he formed his own company, Wheelhouse Entertainment, which is focused on creating entertainment for worldwide audiences based on the classic values of love, courage and honor.

Wallace was the speaker at the Fellowship Foundation National Prayer Breakfast on February 3, 2011.

Wallace served as the commencement speaker at the Liberty University graduation ceremony on May 14, 2011.

<text>The family Vangidae (from &quot;vanga&quot;, Malagasy for the hook-billed vanga, &quot;Vanga curvirostris&quot;) comprises a group of often shrike-like medium-sized birds distributed from Asia to Africa, including the vangas of Madagascar to which the family owes its name. Many species in this family were previously classified elsewhere in other families. Recent molecular techniques made it possible to assign these species to Vangidae, thereby solving several taxonomic enigmas. The family contains 40 species divided into 21 genera.

== Taxonomy ==
In addition to the small set of Malagasy species traditionally called the vangas, Vangidae includes some Asian groups: the woodshrikes (&quot;Tephrodornis&quot;), flycatcher-shrikes (&quot;Hemipus&quot;) and philentomas.

Vangidae belongs to a clade of corvid birds that also includes bushshrikes (Malaconotidae), ioras (Aegithinidae) and the Australian butcherbirds, magpies and currawongs (Cracticidae) and woodswallows (Artamidae), which has been defined as the superfamily Malaconotoidea. They seem closely related to some enigmatic African groups: the helmetshrikes (&quot;Prionops&quot;) and the shrike-flycatchers (&quot;Bias&quot; and &quot;Megabyas&quot;). 
On Madagascar, vangas were traditionally believed to be a small family of shrike-like birds. Recent research suggests that several Madagascan taxa most similar in appearance and habits (and formerly considered to be) Old World warblers, Old World flycatchers or Old World babblers may be vangas. Yamagishi &quot;et al.&quot; found in 2001 that &quot;Newtonia&quot; appeared to belong with the vangas rather than the warblers and also that &quot;Tylas&quot; was a vanga and not a bulbul. It also appears that Ward&#x27;s flycatcher and Crossley&#x27;s babbler belong with the vangas.

The phylogenetic relationships between the genera are shown below. The cladogram is based on a study by Sushma Reddy and collaborators that was published in 2012. The species in the subfamily Vanginae are endemic to Madagascar.
== Description ==
The vangas are an example of adaptive radiation, having evolved from a single founding population into a variety of forms adapted to various niches occupied by other bird families in other parts of the world. They differ in size, colour and bill shape but are similar in skull shape and bony palate structure. They are small to medium-sized birds, varying from 12 to 32 cm in length. Many have strong, hooked bills similar to those of shrikes. The helmet vanga has a particularly large bill with a casque on top. Other species, such as the newtonias, have a small, thin bill. The sickle-billed vanga is notable for its long, curved bill used to probe into holes and cracks.

Most vangas are largely black, brown or grey above and white below. Exceptions include the blue and white blue vanga and the blue-grey nuthatch vanga. The helmet vanga is mostly black with a rufous back. Male Bernier&#x27;s vangas are entirely black while the females are brown. It is one of several species with distinct male and female plumage while in other species the sexes are identical.

Most vangas have whistling calls.

== Distribution and habitat ==
They are native to Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indomalayan realm, although most are endemic to Madagascar in a variety of forest and scrub habitats. Several species including Van Dam&#x27;s vanga and sickle-billed vanga can be found in the dry deciduous forests in the west of the island. Some such as Crossley&#x27;s babbler, helmet vanga and Bernier&#x27;s vanga are restricted to rainforest in the east of the island. Lafresnaye&#x27;s vanga and the recently discovered red-shouldered vanga occur in subarid thorn scrub in the south-west.

== Behaviour ==

Their diet can include insects, earthworms, millipedes, lizards and amphibians. The blue vanga and chabert vanga occasionally eat fruit. Many species feed in small groups, often in mixed-species foraging flocks. The hook-billed vanga and Lafresnaye&#x27;s vanga tend to forage alone. Vangas have a variety of different foraging strategies. Many species glean food as they move through the branches. The nuthatch vanga climbs up trunks and branches like a nuthatch but does not climb downwards as nuthatches do. Crossley&#x27;s babbler forages by walking along the forest floor amongst the leaf litter. The chabert vanga and the tylas vanga often fly into the air to catch prey. The three &quot;Xenopirostris&quot; vangas use their laterally flattened bills to strip bark off trees to search for food underneath.

Most species nest in pairs, building cup-shaped nests using twigs, bark, roots and leaves. The sickle-billed vanga nests in groups and builds a large nest of sticks.

== Status and conservation ==
Some species of vanga are common such as the chabert vanga which can survive in secondary woodland and plantations of introduced trees. Several other species are threatened by loss of their forest habitat. Pollen&#x27;s vanga is classed as near-threatened by BirdLife International and the red-shouldered vanga, Bernier&#x27;s vanga, helmet vanga and red-tailed newtonia are regarded as vulnerable. Van Dam&#x27;s vanga is classed as endangered because it is restricted to a small area of north-west Madagascar where the forest is rapidly disappearing due to clearance for agriculture and uncontrolled bushfires.

== Species list ==

<doc id="261406" wikidata="Q675516" url="?curid=261406" title="Battle of Ivry">
<text>The Battle of Ivry was fought on 14 March 1590, during the French Wars of Religion. The battle was a decisive victory for Henry IV of France, leading French royal and English forces against the Catholic League by the Duc de Mayenne and Spanish forces under the Count of Egmont. Henry&#x27;s forces were victorious and he went on to lay siege to Paris.

The battle occurred on the plain of Épieds, Eure near Ivry (later renamed Ivry-la-Bataille), Normandy. Ivry-la-Bataille is located on the river Eure and about thirty miles west of Paris, at the boundary between the Île-de-France and the Beauce regions.

==Prelude==
Henry IV had moved rapidly to besiege Dreux, a town controlled by the League. As Mayenne followed intending to raise the siege, Henry withdrew but stayed within sight. He deployed his army on the plain of Saint André between the towns of Nonancourt and Ivry. Henry had been reinforced by English troops sent in support by Queen Elizabeth I.
* Henry had 12,000 foot soldiers (including English and Swiss) and 3,000 men on horseback.
* The army of the Catholic League, led by the Duke of Mayenne, had 13,000 foot soldiers and 4,000 cavalry which consisted of citizens led by priests and rebellious nobles, assortment of German and Swiss mercenaries under Appenzell, and the troopers of the Guise family. Included in this force were 2,000 wallon cavalry brought over from Flanders under Philip, Count of Egmont,

==Battle==

At first light on 14 March 1590, the two armies engaged.

Before the battle, the king famously spurred his troops:
&quot;Companions! If you today run at risk with me, I will also run at risk with you; I will be victorious or die. God is with us. Look at his and our enemies. Look at your king. Hold your ranks, I beg of you; and if the heat of battle makes you leave them, think also of rallying back: therein lies the key to victory. You will find it among those three trees that you can see over there on your right side. If you lose your ensigns, cornets or flags, do never lose sight of my panache; you will always find it on the road to honour and victory.&quot;

The action began with a few deadly cannon volleys from the six pieces of the royal artillery, which was under the command of the master, La Guiche. The cavalry of the two sides then clashed with a dreadful force. The Duke of Mayenne followed up with the mercenary troops of the Guelders across the open field. The mercenaries, who were mostly sympathetic to the Protestant cause, fired in the air and put their spears in rest.

Mayenne charged with such a fury that after a terrible fusillade and a struggle of a full quarter of an hour which left the field covered with dead, following the defection of his mercenaries, the opposing left flank fled and the right was pierced and gave way.

Aumont soon overcame the League&#x27;s light horse and their royalist counterparts retreated under the attack of a Walloon squadron backed up by two squadrons from the League. It was then the turn of the Jean VI d&#x27;Aumont, the Duc de Montpensier and the Baron de Biron to charge the foreign cavalry, forcing it into a retreat. Marshal de Biron, in command of the rear-guard with English and Swiss troops on both flanks, joined up with the king who, without stopping after his victory, had crossed the river Eure in pursuit of the enemy.

However, the decisive event took place elsewhere on the battlefield: the King charged the League&#x27;s lancers, who were unable to get far enough back to use their weapons.

Mayenne was driven back, the Duke of Aumale forced to surrender, and the Count of Egmont killed. The Duke of Mayenne had lost the battle. Henry pursued the losers, many of whom surrendered for fear of falling into worse hands, their horses being in no condition to get them away from danger. The countryside was full of Leaguers and Spaniards in flight, with the king&#x27;s victorious army pursuing and scattering the remnants of the larger groups that dispersed and re-gathered.

==Aftermath==

Henry defeated Mayenne at Ivry so that he would become the only credible claimant to the throne of France. However, he was unsuccessful in his subsequent siege of Paris. He would not be accepted into the city until 1594, following his conversion to Roman Catholicism the previous year. Henry was advised that the Parisians, like much of the French people, would not accept a Protestant king.

Thomas Babbington Macaulay wrote a famous poem about the battle, entitled &quot;The Battle of Ivry.&quot; It begins:
Now glory to the Lord of Hosts, from whom all glories are!
And glory to our Sovereign Liege, King Henry of Navarre!

<doc id="261407" wikidata="Q2189517" url="?curid=261407" title="Plasma cosmology">
<text>Plasma cosmology is a non-standard cosmology whose central postulate is that the dynamics of ionized gases and plasmas play important, if not dominant, roles in the physics of the universe at interstellar and intergalactic scales. In contrast, the current observations and models of cosmologists and astrophysicists explain the formation, development, and evolution of large-scale structures as dominated by gravity (including its formulation in Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity).

The original form of the theory, Alfvén–Klein cosmology, was developed by Hannes Alfvén and Oskar Klein in the 1960s and 1970s, and holds that matter and antimatter exist in equal quantities at very large scales, that the universe is eternal rather than bounded in time by the Big Bang, and that the expansion of the observable universe is caused by annihilation between matter and antimatter rather than a mechanism like cosmic inflation.

Cosmologists and astrophysicists who have evaluated plasma cosmology reject it because it does not match the observations of astrophysical phenomena as well as the currently accepted Big Bang model. Very few papers supporting plasma cosmology have appeared in the literature since the mid-1990s.

The term plasma universe is sometimes used as a synonym for plasma cosmology, as an alternative description of the plasma in the universe. Plasma cosmology is distinct from pseudoscientific ideas collectively called the &quot;Electric Universe,&quot; though proponents of each are known to be sympathetic to each other&quot;.&quot; These pseudoscientific ideas vary widely but generally claim that electric currents flow into stars and power them like light bulbs, contradicting well-established scientific theories and observations showing that stars are powered by nuclear fusion.

==Alfvén–Klein cosmology==
In the 1960s, the theory behind plasma cosmology was introduced by Alfvén, a plasma expert who won the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on magnetohydrodynamics. He proposed the use of plasma scaling to extrapolate the results of laboratory experiments and plasma physics observations and scale them over many orders of magnitude up to the largest observable objects in the universe (see box). In 1971, Oskar Klein, a Swedish theoretical physicist, extended the earlier proposals and developed the Alfvén–Klein model of the universe, or &quot;metagalaxy&quot;, an earlier term used to refer to the empirically accessible part of the universe, rather than the entire universe including parts beyond our particle horizon.

In this model, the universe is made up of equal amounts of matter and antimatter with the boundaries between the regions of matter and antimatter being delineated by cosmic electromagnetic fields formed by double layers, thin regions comprising two parallel layers with opposite electrical charge. Interaction between these boundary regions would generate radiation, and this would form the plasma. Alfvén introduced the term ambiplasma for a plasma made up of matter and antimatter and the double layers are thus formed of ambiplasma. According to Alfvén, such an ambiplasma would be relatively long-lived as the component particles and antiparticles would be too hot and too low-density to annihilate each other rapidly. The double layers will act to repel clouds of opposite type, but combine clouds of the same type, creating ever-larger regions of matter and antimatter. The idea of ambiplasma was developed further into the forms of heavy ambiplasma (protons-antiprotons) and light ambiplasma (electrons-positrons).

Alfvén–Klein cosmology was proposed in part to explain the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe, starting from an initial condition of exact symmetry between matter and antimatter. According to Alfvén and Klein, ambiplasma would naturally form pockets of matter and pockets of antimatter that would expand outwards as annihilation between matter and antimatter occurred in the double layer at the boundaries. They concluded that we must just happen to live in one of the pockets that was mostly baryons rather than antibaryons, explaining the baryon asymmetry. The pockets, or bubbles, of matter or antimatter would expand because of annihilations at the boundaries, which Alfvén considered as a possible explanation for the observed expansion of the universe, which would be merely a local phase of a much larger history. Alfvén postulated that the universe has always existed due to causality arguments and the rejection of &quot;ex nihilo&quot; models, such as the Big Bang, as a stealth form of creationism. The exploding double layer was also suggested by Alfvén as a possible mechanism for the generation of cosmic rays,
 X-ray bursts and gamma-ray bursts.

In 1993, theoretical cosmologist Jim Peebles criticized Alfvén–Klein cosmology, writing that &quot;there is no way that the results can be consistent with the isotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation and X-ray backgrounds&quot;. In his book he also showed that Alfvén&#x27;s models do not predict Hubble&#x27;s law, the abundance of light elements, or the existence of the cosmic microwave background. A further difficulty with the ambiplasma model is that matter–antimatter annihilation results in the production of high energy photons, which are not observed in the amounts predicted. While it is possible that the local &quot;matter-dominated&quot; cell is simply larger than the observable universe, this proposition does not lend itself to observational tests.

== Plasma cosmology and the study of galaxies ==
Hannes Alfvén from the 1960s to 1980s argued that plasma played an important if not dominant role in the universe. He argued that electromagnetic forces are far more important than gravity when acting on interplanetary and interstellar charged particles. He further hypothesized that they might promote the contraction of interstellar clouds and may even constitute the main mechanism for contraction, initiating star formation. The current standard view is that magnetic fields can hinder collapse, that large-scale Birkeland currents have not been observed, and that the length scale for charge neutrality is predicted to be far smaller than the relevant cosmological scales.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Alfvén and Anthony Peratt, a plasma physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, outlined a program they called the &quot;plasma universe&quot;. In plasma universe proposals, various plasma physics phenomena were associated with astrophysical observations and were used to explain contemporary mysteries and problems outstanding in astrophysics in the 1980s and 1990s. In various venues, Peratt profiled what he characterized as an alternative viewpoint to the mainstream models applied in astrophysics and cosmology.

For example, Peratt proposed that the mainstream approach to galactic dynamics which relied on gravitational modeling of stars and gas in galaxies with the addition of dark matter was overlooking a possibly major contribution from plasma physics. He mentions laboratory experiments of Winston H. Bostick in the 1950s that created plasma discharges that looked like galaxies. Perrat conducted computer simulations of colliding plasma clouds that he reported also mimicked the shape of galaxies. Peratt proposed that galaxies formed due to plasma filaments joining in a z-pinch, the filaments starting 300,000 light years apart and carrying Birkeland currents of 1018 amperes. Peratt also reported simulations he did showing emerging jets of material from the central buffer region that he compared to quasars and active galactic nuclei occurring without supermassive black holes. Peratt proposed a sequence for galaxy evolution: &quot;the transition of double radio galaxies to radioquasars to radioquiet QSO&#x27;s to peculiar and Seyfert galaxies, finally ending in spiral galaxies&quot;. He also reported that flat galaxy rotation curves were simulated without dark matter. At the same time Eric Lerner, an independent plasma researcher and supporter of Peratt&#x27;s ideas, proposed a plasma model for quasars based on a dense plasma focus.

==Comparison with mainstream astrophysics==
Standard astronomical modeling and theories attempt to incorporate all known physics into descriptions and explanations of observed phenomena, with gravity playing a dominant role on the largest scales as well as in celestial mechanics and dynamics. To that end, both Keplerian orbits and Albert Einstein&#x27;s General Theory of Relativity are generally used as the underlying frameworks for modeling astrophysical systems and structure formation, while high-energy astronomy and particle physics in cosmology additionally appeal to electromagnetic processes including plasma physics and radiative transfer to explain relatively small scale energetic processes observed in the x-rays and gamma rays. Due to overall charge neutrality, plasma physics does not provide for very long-range interactions in astrophysics even while much of the matter in the universe is plasma. (See astrophysical plasma for more.)

Proponents of plasma cosmology claim electrodynamics is as important as gravity in explaining the structure of the universe, and speculate that it provides an alternative explanation for the evolution of galaxies and the initial collapse of interstellar clouds. In particular plasma cosmology is claimed to provide an alternative explanation for the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies and to do away with the need for dark matter in galaxies and with the need for supermassive black holes in galaxy centres to power quasars and active galactic nuclei. However, theoretical analysis shows that &quot;many scenarios for the generation of seed magnetic fields, which rely on the survival and sustainability of currents at early times [of the universe are disfavored]&quot;, i.e. Birkeland currents of the magnitude needed (1018 amps over scales of megaparsecs) for galaxy formation do not exist. Additionally, many of the issues that were mysterious in the 1980s and 1990s, including discrepancies relating to the cosmic microwave background and the nature of quasars, have been solved with more evidence that, in detail, provides a distance and time scale for the universe.

Some of the places where plasma cosmology supporters are most at odds with standard explanations include the need for their models to have light element production without Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which, in the context of Alfvén–Klein cosmology, has been shown to produce excessive X-rays and gamma rays beyond that observed. Plasma cosmology proponents have made further proposals to explain light element abundances, but the attendant issues have not been fully addressed. In 1995 Eric Lerner published his alternative explanation for the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). He argued that his model explained the fidelity of the CMB spectrum to that of a black body and the low level of anisotropies found, even while the level of isotropy at 1:105 is not accounted for to that precision by any alternative models. Additionally, the sensitivity and resolution of the measurement of the CMB anisotropies was greatly advanced by WMAP and the Planck satellite and the statistics of the signal were so in line with the predictions of the Big Bang model, that the CMB has been heralded as a major confirmation of the Big Bang model to the detriment of alternatives. The acoustic peaks in the early universe are fit with high accuracy by the predictions of the Big Bang model, and, to date, there has never been an attempt to explain the detailed spectrum of the anisotropies within the framework of plasma cosmology or any other alternative cosmological model.

Doran landed her first work for an advertising agency at age fifteen. She attended Christopher Newport University for one year and the Art Institute of Pittsburgh online for one semester and used her professional works for curriculum credit. Science fiction artist Frank Kelly Freas was her mentor, and she apprenticed with him in the early 1980s

She broke into the comic book industry when still a teenager, scouted by Tom Long for his fanzine &quot;Graphic Showcase.&quot; Long hired Doran to draw a revival of the 1940s character Miss Fury. Underage Doran quit the assignment due to its adult content. She also contributed illustrations to the Hugo Award nominated fanzine Lan&#x27;s Lantern.

&quot;A Distant Soil&quot; was published in fanzines as early as 1979, then scouted by The Donning Company Starblaze imprint before it was contracted by WaRP Graphics. Doran left the company after nine issues due to an acrimonious dispute with WaRP, which attempted to claim copyright and trademark on her work. The WaRP version of the story has never been reprinted despite its unusual all-pencil style, and Doran&#x27;s ownership of the publishing rights.

==Career==
Doran discarded the 300 pages of work she did at Warp, and rewrote and redrew the entire &quot;A Distant Soil&quot; story from scratch, first with Donning, then as a self-publisher. A 1000-page long-form comics narrative, it has been published by Image Comics since 1996. It sold more than 700,000 copies in multiple printings. The production archives were destroyed by the printer, and an extensive restoration process brought the series back to publication in 2013.

Doran was scouted by Keith Giffen to work at DC Comics after he saw her work in the Legion of Superheroes fanzine Interlac. They went on to become frequent collaborators at DC on The Legion of Superheroes projects, &quot;Justice League 3001&quot;, and the series Reign of the Zodiac. Her art also appeared in Amethyst, Princess of Gemworld No. 12, multiple issues of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the DC Universe&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the Legion of Superheroes&quot;, &quot;Superman: Man of Steel Gallery&quot;, &quot;Christmas with the DC Superheroes&quot;, &quot;Captain Atom&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and &quot;Hawkman Annual&quot;. She did art for several &quot;Teen Titans&quot; and &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; projects.

She illustrated portions of the &quot;Dream Country&quot; and &quot;A Game of You&quot; story arcs in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; series. The character Thessaly in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s Sandman is based on Doran. Other Vertigo appearances include Shade, The Changing Man, Lucifer (DC Comics), Transmetropolitan and the original graphic novel Orbiter (comics) written by Warren Ellis.

Doran&#x27;s premiere at Marvel Comics was in 1986, &quot;Swords of the Swashbucklers&quot; No. 9 and 11, with issue 11 having the dubious distinction of being one of the books confiscated in the 1986 Friendly Franks &quot;obscene&quot; comics raid that precipitated the formation of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund. &quot;Swords of the Swashbucklers&quot; was eventually excluded from the prosecution proceedings.

Doran worked on other projects at Marvel including &quot;The Guardians of the Galaxy Annual&quot; No. 3, &quot;The Silver Surfer&quot;, &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot;, &quot;Excalibur&quot; No. 28, &quot;Captain America: Drug Wars&quot;, &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man&quot;, a &quot;Power Pack&quot; mini-series, &quot;Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot;, &quot;Mutant X&quot;, &quot;X-Factor&quot;, &quot;Marvel Girl Comics&quot;, and &quot;X-Men Millennial Visions&quot; for which she wrote and drew an entry. She also worked in the Special Projects Department on promotional, educational, and greeting card art, sometimes working directly with Stan Lee.

At Marvel Comics&#x27; Epic division, she worked on &quot;Clive Barker&#x27;s Nightbreed&quot; No. 21 and No. 22 as interior and cover artist, and &quot;Clive Barker&#x27;s Hellraiser&quot; No. 5 and No. 14, as artist and colorist.

Doran was a web columnist for &quot;Wizard Magazine&quot; in the early 1990s, and illustrated &quot;Super Idol&quot; for Warren Ellis in 2001, an early webcomics format experiment at Artbomb.

Doran is featured in the films &quot;Ringers&quot; (a documentary about &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; fans), &quot;Scenes From the Small Press: Colleen Doran&quot; by Rich Henn, &quot;Sex, Lies and Superheroes, &quot;the documentary &quot;The Cartoonist&quot; about &quot;Bone&quot; creator Jeff Smith, and &quot;Captured Ghosts&quot;, a documentary about writer Warren Ellis. She was also featured in the December 12, 2011 episode of &quot;Stalked: Someone&#x27;s Watching,&quot; a Discovery ID television series that profiles stalking incidents, focusing on interviews with victims.

Doran worked as a creator rights activist and as a lobbyist in Washington D.C., and served on the advocacy committee of the Graphic Artists Guild. Lecture venues include the Smithsonian Institution, The Singapore Writers Festival, the Comics Masterclass in Sydney, Australia, and the Maryland Institute College of Art. She spoke at &quot;CREATE: Protecting Creativity from the Ground Up&quot; at the Newseum in Washington DC, with Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, Rick Carnes President of the Songwriters Guild of America, musician Suzanne Vega, and other artists and technology policy specialists.

==2010s==
Doran illustrated young adult novelist Barry Lyga&#x27;s first graphic novel for Houghton Mifflin, &quot;Mangaman&quot; in 2011.

&quot;Gone to Amerikay&quot;, a graphic novel drawn by Doran and written by Derek McCulloch, was released in 2012 from DC/Vertigo. It is a &quot;multi-generational Irish saga.&quot; &quot;Gone to Amerikay&quot; themed cover art was featured in the St. Patrick&#x27;s Day edition of the &quot;Irish Echo&quot;, which was then presented to President Barack Obama by Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of Northern Ireland. An excerpt from &quot;Gone to Amerikay&quot; was chosen for inclusion in &quot;The Best American Comics 2013&quot;.

Doran produced cover art for &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; No. 1 (2015, Image Comics), &quot;Red Sonja&quot; (Dynamite, 2014), Marvel&#x27;s &quot;S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; No. 4 (2015), and &quot;Squirrel Girl&quot; No. 7 (2016). For DC Comics, she wrote and drew stories for &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; (2014), based on the TV show, and art for &quot;Justice League 3001&quot; No. 6, 9 and 10 (2015–2016). For IDW&#x27;s &quot;Womanthology&quot; (2012), she contributed biographical essays about classic cartoonists Rose O&#x27;Neill and Ethel Hays.

In 2015, she illustrated the autobiography &quot;Amazing Fantastic Incredible Stan Lee&quot;, co-written by Lee and Peter David.

With Alan Moore, she did the art for &quot;Big Nemo&quot;, a dystopian sequel to Winsor McCay&#x27;s &quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland&quot;, as a webcomic for the Electricomics app.

She wrote script and did the art for an adaptation of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s short story &quot;Troll Bridge&quot; as a graphic novel for Dark Horse, released in October 2016. She also worked on issues of &quot;Faith&quot; and &quot;X-O Manowar&quot; for Valiant Comics. She produced work for the adaptation of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;American Gods&quot;. She was the artist for the series &quot;Finality&quot; with Warren Ellis at Line Webtoon.

In 2019, Dark Horse Comics published Doran&#x27;s adaptation of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Snow, Glass, Apples&quot; which was described by The Comics Journal as a work which &quot;...solidifies her place as one of the greatest cartoonists of her generation.&quot; The Horror Writers Association presented &quot;Snow, Glass, Apples&quot; with the Bram Stoker Superior Achievement in a Graphic Novel award for 2019. It also won the Eisner Award for Best Adaptation from Another Medium, and the Ringo Award for Best Graphic Novel.

==2020s==
In 2020, For &quot;Wonder Woman 750&quot; Doran and Gail Simone teamed up for a story featuring their &quot;breakout&quot; character Star-Blossom, whose first appearance was the &quot;Wonder Woman 75th Anniversary Special&quot; in 2016. Doran wrote and illustrated a short story for &quot;Sensational Wonder Woman&quot;, and illustrated another Wonder Woman short story for &quot;Wonder Woman Black: and Gold&quot; in 2021. She also produced work for DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Generations: Forged&quot; and cover art for &quot;Batman: Urban Legends&quot;.

In 2021 Doran produced art for the Z2 Comics graphic novel anthology &quot;The Doors: Morrison Hotel&quot;, an official graphic novel collection based on the music of the band The Doors. Her work was also used for limited edition prints and the bookplate.

Doran wrote and illustrated work for &quot;Balmain: Dreams 10 OR&quot; a graphic novel dedicated to the French fashion house Balmain in celebration of the 10 year anniversary of creative director Olivier Rousteing.

In 2022, Z2 Comics contracted Doran to produce work for officially licensed graphic novels for Blondie (band), Melissa Etheridge, and the 30th Anniversary of the Tori Amos album &quot;Little Earthquakes&quot;.

&quot;Forbes Magazine&quot; announced another Neil Gaiman/Doran collaboration for the adaptation of the Gaiman prose short story &quot;Chivalry&quot; from Dark Horse Comics. Released in March 2022, Doran hand-painted the work in watercolor, ink, and 18K gold after studying illuminated manuscript techniques.

In April 2022, Doran was reported among the more than three dozen comics creators who contributed to Operation USA&#x27;s benefit anthology book, &quot;Comics for Ukraine: Sunflower Seeds&quot;, a project spearheaded by editor Scott Dunbier, whose profits would be donated to relief efforts for Ukrainian refugees resulting from the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

&quot;Neil Gaiman&#x27;s Chivalry&quot; was listed among the Ten Best Graphic Novels of the Year for 2022 by the Washington Post. Doran&#x27;s work for &quot;Chivalry&quot; was the subject of a solo exhibit at the Museum of Cartoon Art in San Francisco California.

In 2023, The Society of Illustrators announced a solo exhibit for Doran&#x27;s work entitled &quot;Colleen Doran Illustrates Neil Gaiman&quot; featuring work from &quot;Chivalry&quot;, &quot;Snow, Glass, Apples&quot;, &quot;Troll Bridge&quot;, &quot;Sandman&quot;, &quot;American Gods&quot;, and &quot;Norse Mythology&quot;.

&quot;Chivalry&quot; won the Eisner Award for Best Adaptation From Another Medium, and the Locus Award for Best Illustrated and Art Book for 2023. It was nominated for The Reuben Award for Best Graphic Novel, the Ringo Award, and The Excelsior Award.

In May 2023, it was announced that Doran would adapt the Terry Pratchett/Neil Gaiman novel &quot;Good Omens&quot; into a graphic novel.

Funded on Kickstarter, to be produced by the Terry Pratchett estate publishing company Dunmanifestin in 2024, the &quot;Good Omens&quot; graphic novel set a crowdfunding record for a comic book project with a final tally of approximately $3.1 million dollars.

In April 2024, it was announced the Good Omens project would be delayed to spring 2025 to allow Colleen Doran time to recover from cancer treatment.

<text>Tatiana Vladimirovna Grigorieva (; born 8 October 1975) is a retired Australian pole vaulter. She retired from the sport in 2007 after a 10-year career that saw her win Olympic, Commonwealth and World Championship medals. She went on to star in series six of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and as Olympia on the 2008 revival of &quot;Gladiators&quot;.

== Biography ==
Grigorieva was born in Leningrad, Soviet Union, today Saint Petersburg, Russia. As a former national level hurdler in Russia, Grigorieva took up pole vaulting when she migrated to Australia in 1997. Within 12 months of picking up a pole, she became one of the world&#x27;s best, placing third in the 1998 Goodwill Games in New York. In her first appearance at the 1999 World Championships in Athletics, she won the bronze medal.

But it was at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney when she stepped into the spotlight and became a household name. On a night when Cathy Freeman won gold, the Australian home audience had a real bonus in seeing Grigorieva jump a personal best and win silver. The ensuing fame saw Grigorieva take up a number of off-field commitments whilst still continuing to train and compete.

At the 2001 World Championships in Canada, competing against the odds due to an injury restricted campaign, Grigorieva equalled her personal best to claim fourth. In the final competition of the season, as she had done in the Olympics, she edged very close to the world record with a clearance of 4.56 m (a personal best jump) in Yokohama.

At her first Commonwealth Games in 2002, she went into the competition as the overwhelming favourite with enormous pressure on her. Grigorieva&#x27;s goal was to win gold and set a new games record – she achieved both.

In 2003 and 2004, despite maintaining a high standard and a place amongst the world&#x27;s best, injury, illness and the emotional strain of her marriage breakup, resulted in her missing opportunities to represent Australia in the World Championships and Olympics. In 2005, Grigorieva put all that behind her, changing her training regime, place of residence and focus in life. She had a successful season, making the finals of the World Championships and winning the Osaka Grand Prix to retain her Japanese record set in 2001.

In 2006 Grigorieva&#x27;s focus was defending her title at the Commonwealth Games in front of her home crowd. The untimely, mysterious loss of her vaulting poles and a nagging hamstring injury days before the event saw her competing at a slight disadvantage. However, she walked away with a silver medal in a performance that was close to her very best. 2006 was clearly her best ever international season where she jumped over 4.5 m six times and recorded two new personal best heights within days of each other and regained a place in the top five.

Since 2000 Grigorieva has appeared in numerous television programs and ad campaigns and magazines and on a number of magazines covers including from &quot;Inside Sport&quot; and &quot;Black+White&quot; to &quot;GQ&quot; in Italy and &quot;Esquire&quot; in the UK.

Her practical experience and desire to help others is now backed by her continuing studies towards a Health Science degree at the Australian College of Natural Medicine. She also had completed qualifications in Reiki, Pilates and Yoga.

In November 2007, Grigorieva and her partner Plamen Milanov opened the &quot;Caffe e Gelato Milany&quot; on Racecourse Road in the Brisbane suburb of Hamilton.

In December 2008 Grigorieva was named international spokesperson for the fruit bar CheekyChewz manufactured by the Australian company Australian Food Innovators. Her first project has been arranging an initiative that will see 50 cents from every bar sold through Variety&#x27;s website donated to that organisation.

<doc id="261417" wikidata="Q2458227" url="?curid=261417" title="Cabinet of Canada">
<text>The Cabinet of Canada () is a body of ministers of the Crown that, along with the Canadian monarch, and within the tenets of the Westminster system, forms the government of Canada. Chaired by the prime minister, the Cabinet is a committee of the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada and the senior echelon of the Ministry, the membership of the Cabinet and Ministry often being co-terminal; there were no members of the latter who were not also members of the former.

For practical reasons, the Cabinet is informally referred to either in relation to the prime minister in charge of it or the number of ministries since Confederation. The current Cabinet is the Cabinet of Justin Trudeau, which is part of the 29th Ministry. The interchangeable use of the terms &quot;cabinet&quot; and &quot; ministry&quot; is a subtle inaccuracy that can cause confusion.

==Composition==
===Governor-in-Council===
The Government of Canada, formally referred to as &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Government&quot;, is defined by the constitution as the King acting on the advice of his Privy Council; what is technically known as the &quot;Governor-in-Council&quot;, referring to the governor general as the King&#x27;s delegate. However, the Privy Council—composed mostly of former members of parliament, current and former chief justices of Canada, and other elder statesmen—rarely meets in full; as the stipulations of responsible government require that those who directly advise the monarch and governor general on how to exercise the Royal Prerogative be accountable to the elected House of Commons, the day-to-day operation of government is guided only by a sub-group of the Privy Council made up of individuals who hold seats in Parliament. This body of ministers of the Crown is the Cabinet, which has come to be the &quot;council&quot; in the phrase &quot;King-in-Council&quot;.
In the context of constitutional monarchy and responsible government, the ministerial advice tendered is typically binding; though, it is important to note that the royal prerogative belongs to the Crown, not to any of the ministers, and the royal and viceregal figures may unilaterally use these powers in exceptional constitutional crisis situations. There are also a few duties which must be specifically performed by, or bills that require assent by, the King. Royal assent has never been denied to a bill passed by the federal Parliament.

One of the main duties of the Crown is to appoint as prime minister the individual most likely to maintain the confidence of the House of Commons; this is usually the leader of the political party with a plurality of seats in that house. But, when no party or coalition holds a majority (referred to as a hung parliament), or similar scenario, the governor general&#x27;s judgment about the most suitable candidate for prime minister must be brought into play. The prime minister thereafter heads the Cabinet. The King is informed by his viceroy of the acceptance of the resignation of a prime minister and the swearing-in of a new ministry and he remains fully briefed through regular communications from his Canadian ministers and holds audience with them whenever possible.

===Selection and structure===
The governor general appoints to the Cabinet persons chosen by the prime minister—John A. Macdonald once half-jokingly listed his occupation as cabinet maker. While there are no legal qualifications of the potential ministers, there are a number of conventions that are expected to be followed. For instance, there is typically a minister from each province, ministers from visible minority, with disability and Indigenous groups, female ministers, and, while the majority of those chosen to serve as ministers of the Crown are members of Parliament, a cabinet sometimes includes a senator, especially as a representative of a province or region where the governing party won few or no ridings. Efforts are further made to indulge interest groups that support the incumbent government and the party&#x27;s internal politics must be appeased. It is not legally necessary for Cabinet members to have a position in parliament although they are almost always selected from the House of Commons.
As with other Westminster-derived governments, but unlike the United States Cabinet, the size and structure of the Canadian Cabinet is relatively malleable, the slate of Cabinet positions tending to be substantially restructured periodically, the last major period of realignment occurring between 1993 and 1996. Throughout the 20th century, cabinets had been expanding in size until the Cabinet chaired by Brian Mulroney, with a population of 40 ministers. Mulroney&#x27;s successor, Kim Campbell, reduced this number and Jean Chrétien eliminated approximately 10 members of the ministry from the Cabinet, so that, by 1994, there were a total of 23 persons in Cabinet. Under the chairmanship of Paul Martin, the number increased again to 39, in the vicinity of which it has remained. The Trudeau Cabinet comprised 37 ministers in 2021.

Cabinet itself—or full Cabinet—is further divided into committees. The Treasury Board, overseeing the expenditure of the sovereign&#x27;s state funds within every department, is one of the most important of these. The structure of Cabinet fluctuates between and within ministries. For example, the Priorities and Planning Committee, often referred to as the &quot;inner Cabinet&quot;, was the body that set the strategic directions for the government under Stephen Harper, approving key appointments and ratifying committee memberships. This committee ceased to exist under Justin Trudeau. Other Cabinet committees common across committee structures include operations, social affairs, a committee focused on economic growth, foreign affairs and security, the environment, and energy security. Each committee is chaired by a senior minister whose own portfolio may intersect with the mandate of the committee.

===Ministers, secretaries, and deputies===


Each minister of the Crown is responsible for the general administration of at least one government portfolio and heads a corresponding ministry or ministries, known in Canada as departments or agencies. The most important minister, following the first minister, is the minister of finance, while other high-profile ministries include foreign affairs, industry, justice, and health. The official order of precedence does not follow the same pattern, however, with ministers being listed in the order of their appointment to the Privy Council; if appointed on the same day, the individuals are placed in order of their election or appointment to Parliament.

Unique positions in Cabinet are those such as leader of the government in the House of Commons and president of the King&#x27;s Privy Council, who have no corresponding department and some ministers, such as the minister for international cooperation, head agencies under the umbrella of a department run by another minister. Further, the prime minister may recommend the governor general appoint to Cabinet some ministers without portfolio, which was last done in 2021, when Prime Minister Trudeau advised the appointment of Jim Carr as Special Representative to the Prairies. Unlike in many other Westminster model governments, ministers of state in Canada are considered full members of Cabinet, rather than of the ministry outside it, which has the effect of making the Canadian Cabinet much larger than its foreign counterparts. These individuals are assigned specific, but temporary, responsibilities on a more ad hoc basis, fulfilling tasks created and dissolved to suit short-term government priorities from within a department under a full minister of the Crown. Ministers of state may also be named, but not specified any particular responsibilities, thus giving them the effective appearance of ministers without portfolio, or be delegated problems or initiatives that cut across departmental boundaries, a situation usually described as &quot;having the [situation] file&quot;.

Members of the Cabinet receive assistance from both parliamentary secretaries—who will usually answer, on behalf of a minister, questions in the House of Commons—and deputy ministers—senior civil servants assigned to each ministry in order to tender non-partisan advice.

==Responsibilities==
Composed of advisors to the sovereign, the Cabinet has significant power in the Canadian system and, as the governing party usually holds a majority of seats in the legislature, almost all bills proposed by the Cabinet are enacted. Combined with a comparatively small proportion of bills originating with individual members of Parliament, this leads to Cabinet having almost total control over the legislative agenda of the House of Commons. Further, under the constitution, all legislation involving the raising or spending of public revenue must originate from the Cabinet.
Members of various executive agencies, heads of Crown corporations, and other officials are appointed by the Crown-in-Council; though, some of these may be made only by the Governor General-in-Council, specifically. Royal commissions and public inquiries are also called through a royal warrant issued by the King or Governor-in-Council.

All Cabinet meetings are held behind closed doors and the minutes are kept confidential for 30 years, with Cabinet members being forbidden from discussing what transpires. Decisions made must be unanimous; though, this often occurs at the prime minister&#x27;s direction and, once a decision has been reached, all Cabinet members must publicly support it. If any of these rules are violated, the offending minister is usually removed by the prime minister and, if the disagreement within the Cabinet is strong, a minister may resign, as did John Turner in 1975, over the subject of wage and price controls, and Michael Chong in 2006, over a parliamentary motion recognizing &quot;the Québécois&quot; as a nation within Canada.

However, the Cabinet&#x27;s collective influence has been seen to be eclipsed by that of the prime minister alone. Former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is credited with consolidating power in the Office of the Prime Minister (PMO) and, at the end of the 20th century and into the 21st, analysts, such as Jeffrey Simpson, Donald Savoie, and John Gomery, argued that both Parliament and the Cabinet had become overshadowed by prime ministerial power. Savoie quoted an anonymous minister from the Liberal Party as saying Cabinet had become &quot;a kind of focus group for the prime minister,&quot; while Simpson called cabinet a &quot;mini-sounding board&quot;. Coyne wrote in 2015: &quot;Cabinet does not matter [...] It does not govern: that is the job of the prime minister and of the group of political staff he has around him, and of the bureaucracy beyond them.&quot; John Robson criticised the use of the prime minister&#x27;s name to identify the Cabinet, calling it a &quot;bad habit&quot; that &quot;endorses while concealing the swollen pretension of the executive branch.&quot;

==Shadow cabinets==
Each party in His Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition creates a shadow cabinet, with each member thereof observing and critiquing one or more corresponding, actual Cabinet portfolios and offering alternative policies. The Official Opposition&#x27;s shadow cabinet comprises members of the party holding the second-largest number of seats and is appointed by the leader of the Opposition; it is generally regarded as a &quot;government in waiting&quot;. Its members are often, but not always, appointed to a Cabinet post, should the leader of their party be called to form a government.

==Current Cabinet==
The Liberal Party of Canada won the federal election of October 19, 2015, with a majority of seats in the House of Commons. The Cabinet, within the 29th Canadian Ministry, was sworn in on November 4, with Justin Trudeau appointed as prime minister.

The swearing-in of the new Cabinet also marked the first gender-balanced Cabinet in Canada&#x27;s history, wherein an equal number of female and male ministers (15 of each, including the Prime Minister) were appointed. Trudeau has continued to maintain a gender-balanced Cabinet throughout several Cabinet shuffles during his time in office.

Initially, five members of Cabinet were appointed by orders-in-council as ministers of state, but styled without the traditional &quot;of state&quot; in their titles. These were the Ministers of Science, Small Business and Tourism, Sport and Persons with Disabilities, Status of Women, and La Francophonie. (However, the new Minister of La Francophonie was, at the same time, appointed Minister of International Development.) Ministers of state had previously represented a second order within the Cabinet (determined by a lower salary as defined by the Salaries Act, despite the Ministries and Ministers of State Act giving them full authority for any government function delegated to them. However, after details of the aforementioned orders-in-council were published, the new Cabinet stated its intent for there to &quot;be no levels of Cabinet members&quot; and it would table in Parliament amendments to the salary statutes, but also that the new ministers would continue to work with the existing departments rather than forming new ones.

On July 18, 2018, Trudeau reshuffled Cabinet. This included adding five new ministry positions, expanding the size of Cabinet 35. The Prime Minister shuffled Cabinet again on October 26, 2021, following the federal election that year, increasing Cabinet&#x27;s membership to 39, thus upsetting the gender balance.

On July 26, 2023. Trudeau re-shuffled cabinet, adding 7 new ministers: Gary Anandasangaree as Minister of Crown–Indigenous Relations, Rechie Valdez as Minister of Small Business Ya&#x27;ara Saks as Minister of Mental Health and Addictions and Associate Minister of Health, Jenna Sudds as Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, Arif Virani as Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Terry Beech as the first Minister of Citizen&#x27;s Services, and Soraya Martinez Ferrada as Minister responsible for the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec. Ministers Joyce Murray, Omar Alghabra, Carolyn Bennett all announced they would not be seeking re-election. Ministers Mona Fortier, Marco Mendicino, and David Lametti were removed from cabinet. A total of over 30 changes were made. Notably Sean Fraser received a major promotion taking on the Housing file, and Pascale St-Onge took over at the Department of Canadian Heritage. This is the first major cabinet shuffle of Trudeau&#x27;s tenure as Prime Minister and resembled a cabinet after a new government is sworn in with how many significant changes were made. Notably, Southwestern Ontario was left without representation in a critical economic region. There have been no Ministers from Southwest Ontario since Bardish Chagger was removed from cabinet in 2021. Trudeau&#x27;s government is one of the first in decades to not have cabinet representation from the deeper Southwest of Ontario.

On July 19, 2024, Steven MacKinnon was appointed Minister of Labour and Minister of Seniors following the resignation of Seamus O&#x27;Regan.

<text>The Sinti (also &quot;Sinta&quot; or &quot;Sinte&quot;; masc. sing. &quot;Sinto&quot;; fem. sing. &quot;Sintesa&quot;) are a subgroup of Romani people. They are found mostly in Germany, France and Italy and Central Europe, numbering some 200,000 people. They were traditionally itinerant, but today only a small percentage of Sinti remain unsettled. In earlier times, they frequently lived on the outskirts of communities. 

The Sinti of Central Europe are closely related to the group known as Manouche in France. They speak the Sinti-Manouche variety of Romani, which exhibits strong German influence.

== Etymology and origin ==
The origin of the Sinti people, as with the broader Romani people, lies generally in the Indian subcontinent. While people from the western Indian subcontinent&#x27;s Sindh region were mentioned in 1100 by Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Maydani, it is unclear whether the Sindhi people were the ancestors of modern Sinti, though it is clear that Sinti and other Romani people originated in the northern Indian subcontinent.

The origin of the name is disputed. Scholar Jan Kochanowski, and many Sinti themselves, believed it derives from &quot;Sindhi&quot;, the name of a people of Sindh in medieval India (a region now in southeast Pakistan). Scholar Yaron Matras argued that &quot;Sinti&quot; is a later term in use by the Sinti from only the 18th century on, and is likely a European loanword. This view is shared by Romani linguist Ronald Lee who stated the name&#x27;s origin probably lies in the German word &quot;Reisende&quot; meaning &#x27;travellers&#x27;.

A recent study by Estonian and Indian researchers found genetic similarities between European Romani men and Indian men in their sample. Linguist N. B. G. Kazi stated that all Romani people are from Sindh.

== History ==
The Sinti are a subgroup of Romani people mostly found in Germany. They arrived in Austria and Germany in the Late Middle Ages as part of the Romani emigration from the Indian Subcontinent, eventually splitting into two groups: &quot;Eftavagarja&quot; (&quot;the Seven Caravans&quot;) and &quot;Estraxarja&quot; (&quot;from Austria&quot;). They arrived in Germany before 1540. The two groups expanded, the Eftavagarja into France and Portugal, where they are called &quot;Manouches&quot;, and to the Balkans, where they are called &quot;Ciganos&quot; (from Byzantine Greek &quot;τσιγγάνος&quot; and &quot;Ἀτσίγγανος&quot;, deriving from Ancient Greek &quot;ἀθίγγανος&quot;, meaning &quot;untouchable&quot;); and the Estraxarja into Italy and Central Europe, mainly what are now Croatia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, eventually adopting various regional names.

From 1926-1973, Pro Juventute, a Swiss children&#x27;s charity, with the support of Swiss authorities, committed crimes against humanity against the Yenish, Manouche, and Sinti people in Switzerland by forcibly removing children from their families and placing them in foster homes, adoptive families, and correctional institutions through the Kinder der Landstrasse (Children of the Open Road) project. This was part of a wider effort to forcibly assimilate these traditionally nomadic communities into the sedentary Swiss society. In February 2025, the Swiss government formally acknowledged that the forced removals and assimilation efforts constitute a crime against humanity under international law.

=== The Holocaust ===


The Sinti migrated to Germany in the early 15th century. Despite their long presence, they were still generally regarded as beggars and thieves, and, by 1899, the police kept a central register on Sinti, Roma, and Yenish peoples. Nazi Germany considered them racially inferior (see Nazism and race), and persecuted them throughout Germany during the Nazi periodthe Nuremberg Laws of 1935 often being interpreted to apply to them as well as the Jews.

Adolf Eichmann recommended that Nazi Germany solve the &quot;Gypsy Question&quot; simultaneously with the Jewish Question, resulting in the deportation of the Sinti to clear room to build homes for ethnic Germans. Some were sent to the territory of Poland, or elsewhere, including some deported to the territory of Yugoslavia by the Hamburg Police in 1939. Others were confined to designated areas, and many were eventually murdered in gas chambers. Many Sinti and Roma were taken to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where they were put in a special section, called the &quot;gypsy camp&quot;. Josef Mengele often performed some of his infamous experiments on Sinti and Roma. On 2 August 1944, the &quot;gypsy camp&quot; was closed, and approximately 4,000 Sinti and Roma were gassed during the night of 2–3 August and burnt in the crematoria. The date 2 August is commemorated as Roma and Sinti Holocaust Remembrance Day.

In the concentration camps, the Sinti were forced to wear either a black triangle, indicating their classification as &quot;asocial&quot;, or a brown triangle, specifically reserved for Sinti, Roma, and Yenish peoples.

<text>David Ernest McReynolds (October 25, 1929 – August 17, 2018) was an American politician and social activist who was a prominent democratic socialist and pacifist activist. He described himself as &quot;a peace movement bureaucrat&quot; during his 40-year career with the War Resisters League. He was a resident of New York City. McReynolds was twice a candidate for President of the United States, running atop the ticket of the Socialist Party USA in 1980 and 2000. He was the Socialist Party USA&#x27;s first openly gay presidential candidate. He was also America&#x27;s first gay presidential candidate if not counting John Hospers - although multiple sources, including the Libertarian Party, have referred to John Hospers, who was in 1972 the first presidential nominee of the newly formed Libertarian Party, as the first openly gay person to run for president of the United States, &quot;The Guardian’s&quot; obituary stated that his family “strenuously denied” he was gay. 

==Early life and education==
David Ernest McReynolds was born in Los Angeles to Elizabeth Grace (Tallon), a nurse, and Lt. Col. Charles McReynolds, an Air Force intelligence officer. Between 1957 and 1960, he worked for the editorial board of the left-wing magazine &quot;Liberation&quot;. He was openly gay and wrote his first article about living as a gay man in 1969.

McReynolds became a member of the Prohibition Party in 1946 or 1947 due to his upbringing as a fundamentalist Baptist, but left the party around the same time that it expelled its entire youth section for being communist. During his time in the Prohibitionist Party he became more left-wing and he later joined the Socialist Party of America in 1951. He became a pacifist in 1949, and attended a pacifist youth conference in Europe in the same year during which he realized that he was homosexual and became an atheist. He attended UCLA and graduated in 1953, and during his education he was arrested for refusing to serve in the Korean War, but the charges were dismissed. He was elected to the National Committee of the Socialist Party in 1954.

==War Resisters League==
McReynolds was staunchly anti-war and a draft resister, and in 1960 joined the staff of the War Resisters League (WRL), where he remained until his retirement in 1999. In 1965, he lectured on &quot;The Old Left and the New Left&quot; at the newly founded Free University of New York.

He edited the League&#x27;s bi-monthly, &quot;Liberation&quot;. In November 1965, he persuaded Casey Hayden to let him publish under the title &quot;Sex and Caste&quot; a paper she had been circulating among women questioning their role and position within Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. The publication of the article has since been regarded as a key bridge connecting civil rights to women&#x27;s liberation.

That same month, November 1965, McReynolds was one of five men who publicly burned their draft cards at an anti-war demonstration at Union Square in New York. This was one of the first public draft-card burnings after U.S. law was changed on August 30, 1965, to make such actions a felony, punishable by up to five years&#x27; imprisonment. He was close friends with Bayard Rustin and other prominent peace activists, as well as literary figures such as Quentin Crisp.

In 1968, he signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War, and later became a sponsor of the War Tax Resistance project, which practiced and advocated tax resistance as a form of anti-war protest.

McReynolds was particularly active internationally, both in War Resisters&#x27; International, of which he was chairperson for the term 1986–88, and in the International Confederation for Disarmament and Peace, which eventually merged into the International Peace Bureau.

==Socialist Party USA==
The SPA was renamed the Social Democrats USA by a majority vote at the 1972 convention. Michael Harrington resigned and then formed the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (now the Democratic Socialists of America, DSA) with the purpose of &quot;realignment&quot; strengthening the role of labor unions and other progressive organizations in the Democratic Party to pull it to the left. The smallest and the most left wing faction of the SPA, known as the Debs Caucus, including McReynolds, formed the Socialist Party USA (SPUSA). McReynolds was long a member of both DSA and SPUSA.

McReynolds&#x27; primary theoretical contribution to socialism came from his blending of a pacifist world-view with a commitment to re-distributive socialist economics. Politically, he was a staunch anti-authoritarian and collaborated with a diverse set of political formations on the democratic left. His widely read pamphlet, &quot;The Philosophy of Nonviolence&quot;, provides a unique window into the mind of a lifelong activist wrestling with the contradictions and pitfalls which plagued the political left in the 20th century. He concludes that &quot;...there is no living, vital philosophy which does not have &#x27;holes&#x27; in it.&quot; Consequently, he mapped out a pluralistic approach which is, on the one hand, socialist, yet is entirely engaged with thought systems as seemingly contradictory as Hindu philosophy. He concluded that a brand of pacifist-socialism is best suited for future socialist experiments since it offers the greatest opportunity to prefigure the kinds of democratic relations necessary to create a functional and free society.

In his political career, McReynolds ran for Congress from Lower Manhattan twice and for President twice. In 1958, he ran as a write-in SPA candidate and then in 1968 as a Peace and Freedom Party candidate for Congress in the 19th district pulling in 4.7% of the vote (3,969 votes).

The Socialist Party attempted to unite behind Barry Commoner as a presidential candidate with the Citizens Party during the 1980 presidential election, but was unsuccessful. The party gave its presidential nomination to McReynolds and vice-presidential nomination to Diane Drufenbrock, the party&#x27;s treasurer, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They were on the ballots in ten states and raised around $25,000 during the campaign. The purpose of his campaign was to increase the party&#x27;s membership. He received more votes than Frank Zeidler, the party&#x27;s presidential nominee in the 1976 presidential election, in every state except for Wisconsin which McReynolds stated was due to Zeidler&#x27;s name recognition in the state.

He was given the party&#x27;s presidential nomination again during the 2000 election. After the 2000 election, the &quot;Palm Beach Post&quot; speculated that the vast majority of the 2,908 voters who had voided their votes by punching the names of both McReynolds and Democratic candidate Al Gore on a &quot;confusing butterfly ballot&quot; (and also of the over 3,000 more who punched both Gore and Buchanan) had meant to vote for Gore and that mistaken voting on the Palm Beach County butterfly ballot had consequently cost Gore the state&#x27;s crucial electoral votes, and therefore the election as a whole.

In January 2015, the Socialist Party USA&#x27;s National Committee voted to censure McReynolds over alleged racist comments made on social media regarding the &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; shooting and shooting of Michael Brown. He resigned from the SPUSA shortly thereafter.

==2004 Senate campaign==

On July 10, 2004, McReynolds announced his candidacy running on the Green Party ticket for one of the New York seats in the Senate, running an anti-war campaign against Democratic incumbent Chuck Schumer, where he pulled in 36,942 votes for 0.5% of total.

==Later life==
McReynolds was active politically until just before his death, attending meetings, speaking in classrooms, being interviewed for films and research, and participating in peace, justice, antiwar, and antinuclear actions. His last arrest was at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in 2015 at an action calling for immediate nuclear disarmament.

He was an avid photographer throughout his adult life and spent time during the last three years of his life sorting his collection of more than 50,000 photos.

In 2015, McReynolds endorsed U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States, praising him as a &quot;serious candidate&quot; and for not personally attacking his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.

McReynolds died on August 17, 2018, aged 88, following a fall he sustained at his New York City home.

<text>The is a European bowed stringed instrument used in the medieval period, similar to a modern violin but with a somewhat longer and deeper body, three to five gut strings, and a leaf-shaped pegbox with frontal tuning pegs, sometimes with a figure-8 shaped body. Whatever external form they had, the box-soundchest consisted of back and belly joined by ribs, which experience has shown to be the construction for bowed instruments. The most common shape given to the earliest vielles in France was an oval, which with its modifications remained in favour until the Italian lira da braccio asserted itself as the better type, leading to the violin.

The instrument was also known as a &quot;fidel&quot; or a &quot;viuola&quot;, although the French name for the instrument, &quot;Vièle&quot;, is generally used; the word comes from the same root as &quot;fiddle&quot;. It was one of the most popular instruments of the medieval period, and was used by troubadours and jongleurs from the 13th through the 15th centuries. The &quot;vielle&quot; possibly derived from the lira, a Byzantine bowed instrument closely related to the rebab, an Arab bowed instrument. There are many medieval illustrations of different types of vielles in manuscripts, sculptures and paintings.

Starting in the middle or end of the 15th century, the word &quot;vielle&quot; was used to refer to the hurdy-gurdy, as a shortened form of its name: &quot;vielle à roue (&quot;vielle with a wheel&quot;).

Several modern groups of musicians have formed into bands to play early music (pre-Baroque), and they sometimes include vielles, or modern reproductions, in their ensembles, together with other instruments such as rebecs and saz.

<text>The Great Bear, number 111, was a locomotive of the Great Western Railway. It was the first 4-6-2 (Pacific) locomotive used on a railway in Great Britain, and the only one of its type built by the GWR.

==Origins==
There are differing views as to why Churchward and the GWR should have built a Pacific locomotive in 1908 when current and future locomotive practice for the railway was centred on the 4-6-0 wheel arrangement. One suggestion is that &quot;The Great Bear&quot; was built in 1908 to satisfy demands from the directors for the largest locomotive in Britain, and much was made of the locomotive by the GWR&#x27;s publicity department. However, O. S. Nock was adamant that the design &quot;was entirely due to Churchward, and not to outside influences that pressed the project upon him&quot;. Nock regarded the locomotive as &quot;primarily an exercise in boiler design&quot;, with Churchward looking forward to a time when his Star Class locomotives could no longer cope with increasing loads. Others have referred to a statement made to the GWR board in 1906 about the GWR-designed 4-4-2 North Star, where Churchward stated that a 4-6-2 would be bigger than required at that time but that such a design was being prepared. The order for &quot;The Great Bear&quot; was placed in January 1907.

==Design==
The front-end layout of the class was the same as that for the Star Class except that Churchward fitted diameter cylinders, the maximum possible without fouling the rear wheels of the front bogie. However, the design of the boiler was entirely new, and with a barrel of in length, which was exceptionally long both by contemporary and later standards. The main reason Churchward adopted the 4-6-2 wheel arrangement was to enable him to fit a wide firebox over the trailing wheels. With a firebox surface of , this was a 17.5% increase in size compared to the Star Class. It was also built with a Swindon No. 1 superheater.

==Power classification==
With the introduction of Great Western Railway Power Classification in 1920, the power classification was &quot;Special&quot; (denoted by a black &quot;+&quot; on the red route availability disc,) although the tractive effort of fell within the range for &quot;D&quot;.

==Performance==
In service, the performance of &quot;The Great Bear&quot; proved to be disappointing and not a significant improvement on existing classes. &quot;The excessive tube and barrel length of 23 feet made for bulk rather than efficiency&quot;. Also, the axle boxes of the trailing wheels tended to become overheated due to their proximity to the firebox. Churchward attempted to improve the locomotive&#x27;s performance by adding a Swindon No. 3 Superheater in 1913 and top-feed apparatus. However, the excellent performance of the Star Class and the advent of the First World War brought a stop to further experimentation without significant improvement.

==Route availability==
In addition to the disappointing performance, the locomotive had a highly restrictive route availability which limited its usefulness. The axle load restricted it to the Paddington to Bristol main line, although it was once recorded to have travelled as far west as Newton Abbot.
The GWR route availability colour code for &quot;The Great Bear&quot; was Red.

==Publicity value==
Although not a technical success, &quot;The Great Bear&quot; was considered the company&#x27;s flagship locomotive from its introduction until Churchward&#x27;s retirement in 1922. With the introduction of 4073 &quot;Caerphilly Castle&quot; in 1923 with a higher tractive effort, &quot;The Great Bear&quot; ceased to have any publicity value and became an embarrassment. It was due for heavy repairs in January 1924 and so was withdrawn from service by Churchward&#x27;s successor Charles Collett. It had run 527,272 miles by this time. Its regular engine driver was Thomas Blackall, originally from Aston Tirrold, Oxfordshire.

==Rebuilding==
&quot;The front portion of the original frames and the number plates were used again but probably little else&quot;. No. 111 emerged as a 4-6-0 in the Castle Class, given the name &quot;Viscount Churchill&quot;. Thereafter, the GWR did not use the Pacific wheel arrangement. No. 111 was withdrawn in July 1953 and scrapped later that year.
One of the original nameplates is in the Science Museum.

==Assessment==
According to Cecil J. Allen, &quot;&quot;The Great Bear&quot; was one of the very few locomotive types that Swindon has produced, and in particular among the Churchward designs, to which the word &#x27;failure&#x27; could be applied.&quot; Authorities differ as to Churchward&#x27;s attitude to his locomotive. According to Le Fleming, &quot;his dislike of &#x27;The Bear&#x27; was well known&quot;, but Nock said that he had &quot;a deep affection for the engine&quot;, although he came to regard it as &quot;a white elephant&quot; rather than a &quot;Great Bear&quot;. He was disappointed to hear of &quot;The Great Bear&quot;&#x27;s destruction, and, upon hearing of Nigel Gresley&#x27;s plans to construct a Pacific for the Great Northern Railway, is said to have replied: &quot;What did that young man want to build it for? We could have sold him ours!&quot;

<text>Rákoskeresztúr () is a former town in Hungary now part of District XVII of Budapest. Rákoskeresztúr was united with Budapest on January 1, 1950.

==Background==

The first written mark (the name &quot;Pousarakusa&quot;, in modern Hungarian &quot;Pósarákosa&quot;) was a title-deed written in 1265. The name was given by the region&#x27;s first occupant. In that title-deed the region was given to the Crusaders of Upper-Heviz. The village was almost destroyed in the Turkish assault. In 1662, only eight peasant- and 2 cotter families lived in it. From 1727 to 1950, it was counted as a town. In 1880, Rákoshegy and Rákosliget are cut off from Rákoskeresztúr. In 1950, Rákoskeresztúr, Rákoshegy, Rákosliget and the newly built Rákoskert were joined together as the XVII. district of Budapest.</text><links>

<doc id="261440" wikidata="Q205790" url="?curid=261440" title="Kemal Derviş">
<text>Kemal Derviş (; 10 January 1949 – 8 May 2023) was a Turkish economist and politician who was head of the United Nations Development Programme. He was honored by the government of Japan for having &quot;contributed to mainstreaming Japan&#x27;s development assistance policy through the United Nations&quot;. In 2005, he was ranked 67th in the Top 100 Public Intellectuals Poll conducted by &quot;Prospect&quot; and &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazines. He was vice president and director of the global economy and development program at the Brookings Institution and part-time professor of international economics at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva.

In March 2015, Derviş agreed to become the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey responsible for the economy in a cabinet led by Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu should his party form the government after the general election to be held in June. He declined to become a Member of Parliament however, stating that he would prefer to participate in the cabinet from outside the Parliament.

==Early life and career==
Kemal Derviş was born on 10 January 1949 in Istanbul, Turkey, to an Albanian and Georgian father and a German mother. From his father&#x27;s side, he is a descendant of Ottoman Grand Vizier Halil Hamid Pasha (1736–1785); and of Ottoman military physician Asaf Derviş Pasha (1868–1928) who is regarded as the founder of modern gynaecology in Turkey.

Derviş completed his early education in Institut Le Rosey. He later earned his bachelor (1968) and master&#x27;s degrees (1970) in economics from the London School of Economics. He received his Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University in 1973 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled &quot;&quot;Substitution, employment and intertemporal equilibrium in a non-linear multi-sector planning model for Turkey&quot;.&quot; From 1973 to 1976, he was member of the economics faculty of the Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey, and served also as an advisor to Bülent Ecevit during and after his Prime Ministerial duties. From 1976 to 1978, he was a member of the faculty, Department of Economics at Princeton University.

In 1977, he joined the World Bank, where he worked until he returned to Turkey in 2001. At the World Bank, he held various positions, including civision chief for industrial and trade strategy and director for the Central Europe Department after the fall of the Berlin Wall. In 1996, he became vice-president of the World Bank for the Middle East and North Africa Region, and in 2000, vice-president for poverty reduction and economic management.

==Political career==
Derviş took office as Minister of State for Economic Affairs in Turkey on 13 March 2001, when Bülent Ecevit was Prime Minister. Derviş is credited with being the architect of Turkey&#x27;s successful three-year economic recovery program launched in that year. The health condition of elder statesman Bülent Ecevit, the Prime Minister and leader of the party led to rumours that his Deputy Prime minister and Minister of State, Hüsamettin Özkan, was plotting to replace him. As a result, Özkan was forced to resign, prompting nearly half of DSP&#x27;s parliamentarians to follow him, including İsmail Cem, the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Özkan, Zeki Eker, Cem and Kemal Derviş, the Minister of State in charge of economy, then decided to establish a new social democratic party. İsmail Cem became the leader of the New Turkey Party (YTP).

However, the party showed signs of organizational weakness. Moreover, Derviş changed his mind and joined the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) instead. As a result, the YTP performed dismally in the 2002 general election (receiving only 1.2% of the eligible votes cast) and again in the 2004 local elections. In October 2004, the YTP was merged into the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP). Before being named to head the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), he was a member of the Turkish parliament, and a member of the joint commission of the Turkish and European Parliaments. He was a member of the Convention on the Future of Europe. A member of the Advisory Group at the Center for Global Development, member of the Task Force on Global Public Goods and the Special Commission on the Balkans and associated with the Economics and Foreign Policy Forum in Istanbul, Derviş was instrumental in strengthening Turkey&#x27;s prospects of starting membership negotiations with the European Union.

Strobe Talbott announced that Derviş joined the Brookings Institution on 30 March 2009 as vice president and director of the Global Economy and Development program.

On 10 June 2020, he published a Project Syndicate article titled &quot;Less Globalization, More Multilateralism.&quot; Derviş was also a regular contributor to Project Syndicate from 2003 to 2023.

==Ministry of Economic Affairs==
When Derviş became Turkey&#x27;s minister of economic affairs in March 2001, after a 22-year career at the World Bank, the country was facing its worst economic crisis in modern history and prospects for success were uncertain. Derviş used his independence from domestic interests and the support of domestic reformers and civil society to push through a stabilization program with far-reaching structural changes and bank reforms that protected state banks from political use. Derviş also strengthened the independence of the central bank and initiated deep structural reforms in agriculture, energy and the budget process. These reforms, and his reputation and high-level contacts in the U.S. and Europe, is said to have helped him to mobilize $20 billion in new loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Rapid economic growth resumed in 2002 and inflation came down from an average of nearly 70 percent in the 1990s to 12 percent in 2003; interest rates fell and the exchange rate for the Turkish lira stabilized.

Derviş resigned from his ministerial position on 10 August 2002 and was elected to parliament on 3 November of that year as a member of the main opposition Republican People&#x27;s Party.

==United Nations Development Program==
On 5 May 2005, the United Nations General Assembly, representing 191 countries, unanimously confirmed Kemal Derviş as the Administrator of the United Nations Development Program, which is also the chairperson of the United Nations Development Group. Derviş started his four-year term on 15 August 2005. The UNDP Administrator is the third-highest-ranking official in the United Nations, after the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General.

In 2006, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Derviş to a High-level Panel on United Nations Systemwide Coherence, which was set up to explore how the United Nations system could work more coherently and effectively across the world in the areas of development, humanitarian assistance and the environment.

In 2009, Derviş decided not to seek a second term as Administrator of UNDP.

==Personal life==
Kemal Derviş spoke Turkish, German, English and French fluently. He was married to Catherine Derviş, an American citizen.

According to press reports, when he was still single and working at the World Bank, Derviş had an affair with a married female subordinate (her identity was not revealed) who reportedly later started working at the IMF. This was speculated by the media as the possible reason why Derviş, despite being seen by many as the right person for the job, decided not to become a candidate to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn as the next managing director of the IMF, a position which was eventually taken by Christine Lagarde.

Kemal Derviş died in Washington, D.C., on 8 May 2023, at the age of 74.

<text>Yantai, formerly known as Chefoo, is a coastal prefecture-level city on the Shandong Peninsula in northeastern Shandong province of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Lying on the southern coast of the Bohai Strait, Yantai borders Qingdao on the southwest and Weihai on the east, with sea access to both the Bohai Sea (via the Laizhou Bay and the Bohai Strait) and the Yellow Sea (from both north and south sides of the Shandong Peninsula). It is the largest fishing seaport in Shandong. Its population was 7,102,116 during the 2020 census, of whom 3,184,299 lived in the built-up area made up of the 5 urban districts of Zhifu, Laishan, Fushan, Muping, and Penglai.

== Names ==
The name Yantai (&quot;Smoke Tower&quot;) derives from the watchtowers constructed on in 1398 under the reign of the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty. The towers were used to light signal fires and send smoke signals, called &quot;langyan&quot; from their supposed use of wolf dung for fuel. At the time, the area was troubled by the Japanese pirates (Wokou), initially raiders from the warring states in Japan but later principally disaffected Chinese. It was also formerly romanized as Yen-tai.

The major district of Yantai is Zhifu, which used to be the largest independent city in the area. It was variously romanized as Chefoo, Che-foo, Chi-fu, and Chih-fou. Although this name was used for the city by foreigners prior to the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, the locals referred to the settlement as Yantai throughout.

== History ==
During the Xia and Shang dynasties, the region was inhabited by indigenous people vaguely known to the Chinese as the &quot;Eastern Barbarians&quot; (&quot;Dongyi&quot;). Under the Zhou, they were colonized and sinicized as the state of Lai. Lai was annexed by Qi in Under the First Emperor (&quot;Shi Huangdi&quot;), the area was administered as the Qi Commandery. Under the Han, this was renamed as the Donglai Commandery (). Following the Three Kingdoms period, the area was organized by the Jin as the Donglai Kingdom or Principality, later returning to prefecture status as a &quot;jùn&quot; and then &quot;zhōu&quot;. Under the Tang and during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, it was known as Deng Prefecture and organized with the Henan Circuit. It was then organized as the Laizhou () and then, under the Qing, Dengzhou Prefecture ().

Up to the 19th century, however, the Zhifu area consisted of nothing but small unwalled fishing villages of little importance. Under the Ming, these were first troubled by the Wokou and then by the overreacting &quot;Sea Ban&quot;, which required coastal Chinese to give up trading and most fishing and relocate inland upon pain of death.

Following the Second Opium War, the Qing Empire was obliged to open more treaty ports by the unequal 1858 Treaty of Tianjin, including Tengchow (now Penglai). Its port being found inadequate, Zhifu—about away—was selected to act as the seat of the area&#x27;s foreign commerce. The mooring was at considerable distance from shore, necessitating more time and expense in loading and unloading, but the harbor was deep and expansive and business grew rapidly. The harbor opened in May 1861, with its status as an international port affirmed on 22 August. The official decree was accompanied by the construction of the Donghai Customs House (). It quickly became the residence of a circuit intendant (&quot;taotai&quot;), customs house, and a considerable foreign settlement located between the old native town and the harbor. Britain and sixteen other nations established consulates in the town. The town was initially expanded with well-laid streets and well-built stone houses, even for the poorer classes, a Catholic and a Protestant church were erected, and a large hotel did business with foreigners who employed the town as a summer resort.

The principal traders were the British and Americans, followed by the Germans and Thais. In the 1870s, the principal imports were woolen and cotton goods, iron, and opium and the principal exports were tofu, soybean oil, peas, coarse vermicelli, vegetables, and dried fruit from Zhifu itself, raw silk and straw braid from Laizhou, and walnuts from Qingzhou. The town also traded Chinese liquors and sundries for the edible seaweed grown in the shallows of the Russian settlements around Port Arthur (now Dalian&#x27;s Lüshunkou District). In 1875, the murder of the British diplomat Augustus Margary in Tengchong, Yunnan, led to a diplomatic crisis that was resolved in Zhifu by Thomas Wade and Li Hongzhang the next year. The resultant Chefoo Convention gave British subjects extraterritoriality throughout China and exempted the foreign merchants&#x27; enclaves from the likin tax on internal commerce. Its healthy situation and good anchorage made it a favorite coaling station for foreign fleets, giving it some importance in the conflicts over Korea, Port Arthur, and Weihaiwei.

Award-winning Chefoo bobbin lace was produced following the introduction of the craft by British missionaries, reportedly becoming a popular export. Chefoo lace was exhibited at the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair.

Yantai received German economic activities and investments for about 20 years. In the run-up to the First World War, its trade continued to grow but was limited by the poor roads of the area&#x27;s hinterland and the necessity of using pack animals for portage. The trade items remained largely the same as before. After the Germans were defeated by Allied forces in World War I, Qingdao and Yantai were occupied by the Japanese, who turned Yantai into a summer station for their Asian fleet. They also set up a trading establishment in the town. The different foreign influences that shaped this city are explored at the Yantai Museum, which used to be a guild hall. However, the city&#x27;s colourful history has not left a distinctive architectural mark, there has never been a foreign concession, and though there are a few grand 19th-century European buildings, most of the town is of much more recent origin. After 1949, the town&#x27;s name was changed from Chefoo to Yantai, and it was opened to the world as an ice-free trade port in 1984.

On 12 November 1911, the eastern division of Tongmeng Hui declared itself a part of the revolutionary movement. The next day, it established the Shandong Military Government () and, the day after that, renamed itself the Yantai Division of the Shandong Military Government (). In 1914, Jiaodong Circuit () was established with Yantai as the capital. Jiaodong Circuit was renamed Donghai Circuit () in 1925. On 19 January 1938, Yantai participated as part of an anti-Japanese revolutionary committee.

After the creation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Yantai was officially awarded city status with the outlying towns of Laiyang and Wendeng tacked on as &quot;Special Regions&quot; () in 1950. Wendeng was merged into Laiyang six years later, and this larger Laiyang Special Region was combined with Yantai City to become Yantai Prefecture (). Yantai is of strategic importance to China&#x27;s defense, as it and Dalian, directly across the Bohai Sea from it, are primary coastal guard points for Beijing. In November 1983, the prefecture became a prefecture-level city.

==Geography==
Yantai is located along the north coast of the Shandong Peninsula, south of the junction of Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea and parallel to the southern coast of Liaoning. The topographical breakdown consists of:
* 36.62% mountainous
* 39.7% hilly
* 50.23% plain
* 2.90% basin
About is urbanized. Only Qixia City is located entirely inland. All other county-level entities are coastal, with Changdao consisting entirely of islands. The total coastline of the prefecture is .

The summits in the hill country vary from ; the average peak in the mountainous region is , and the highest point of elevation is the summit of Mount Kunyu () at .

There are 121 rivers over in length, the largest being:
* Wulong River ()
* Dagu River ()
* Dagujia River ()
* Wang River ()
* Jie River ()
* Huangshui River ()
* Xin&#x27;an River ()
The core of the old town of Zhifu was located above the mouth of the Yi (, &quot;Yí Hé&quot;).

===Climate===
Yantai has a monsoon-influenced climate which under the Köppen climate classification, Yantai falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dwa&quot;) if the isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cwa&quot;) if the isotherm is used. Summers are hot, humid, and rainy while winters are cold and dry. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from (unofficial record of was set on 10 January 1931) to .
==Administration==
The prefecture-level city of Yantai administers 12 county-level divisions, including 5 districts, 6 county-level cities, and one development zone. ()

* Zhifu District (芝罘区)
* Fushan District (福山区)
* Muping District (牟平区)
* Laishan District (莱山区)
* Penglai District (蓬莱区)
* Laiyang City (莱阳市)
* Laizhou City (莱州市)
* Zhaoyuan City (招远市)
* Qixia City (栖霞市)
* Haiyang City (海阳市)
* Longkou City (龙口市)
* Yantai Economic and Technological Development Zone 
* Yantai Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone

These are further divided into 148 township-level divisions, including 94 towns, six townships, and 48 subdistricts.

==Economy==
Yantai is currently the second largest industrial city in Shandong, next to Qingdao. However, the region&#x27;s largest industry is agriculture. It is famous throughout China for a particular variety of apple and Laiyang pear, and is home to the country&#x27;s largest and oldest grape winery, Changyu.

The county-level city of Longkou is well known throughout China for its production of cellophane noodles.

===Power===
Yantai derives most of its energy from a large coal power plant using bituminous coal, and fitted with coal gasification technology to minimize pollution. The plant is located close to Yantai port. An attempt to switch northern China from coal to natural gas resulted in shortages, and in 2017 the Chinese government implemented a new plan to convert half of northern China to clean energy for winter heating. Haiyang, a city under Yantai&#x27;s prefecture, is anticipated to meet its total winter heating needs with nuclear power by 2021.
===Industrial zones===

The Qinggrong Intercity Railway, the first intercity high-speed railway in Shandong Province, has been put into operation, cutting the travel time of the fastest train from Qingdao to Yantai from about 4 hours and 30 minutes to about 1 hour and 15 minutes.

==Tourism==

Penglai City&#x27;s Dan Cliffs () is said to be the departure point of the Eight Immortals on their trip to the Conference of the Magical Peach. It is important to note that Penglai is around 80 km from the city centre of Yantai.

Yangma Island is located in the north of Muping District, Yantai and has a large area. The climate on the island is pleasant, with no severe cold in winter and no scorching heat in summer, making it suitable for leisure and vacation. It can be called the Maldives in China. Yangma Island has a long history. It is said that Emperor Qin Shihuang raised royal horses here during his eastward tour and was named the &quot;Royal Horse Island&quot;, hence the name of Yangma Island.

<text>Zhifu Island () or North Island (), is an islet with historical significance in Shandong Province, China. The name of the islet &quot;Chefoo&quot; was generalized to mean the entire Yantai region in older western literature.

==Etymologies==
Possibilities include:
# &quot;A Barrier in the Shape of a Magical Plant&quot;
#* &quot;Zhi&quot; is a magical and powerful plant, which the island&#x27;s shape resembles
#* &quot;Fu&quot; a barrier of ocean
# A magical mountain name (significance unknown)
#* From Qin dynasty&#x27;s Zhifu (), officially changed to the present character during the late Qing dynasty.

==Administration==
Administratively, Zhifu Island is a part of Dàtuǎn Village (), Xingfu Sub-district, Zhifu District, Yantai City, Shandong Province. Dàtuǎn has a part on the mainland, where the offices and most residents are.

== History ==
Archeological excavations have uncovered over 200 artifacts, including stone axes, and short axes (錛 : Bēn), pottery fragments, bone needles, and bone hairpins. These and Carbon-14 dating indicated that the island has been settled since the Neolithic period.

People were buried here during the Zhou dynasty, including Duke Kang of Qi, who died on the island in 379 BC. The ruins of the cemetery still exist today. The Lord Yang Temple (陽主廟 &quot;Yángzhǔ Miào&quot;) was built during the early Zhou dynasty by rulers of the State of Qí in honor of Lord Yang, the fifth deity of the Eight Divine Generals ().

Because of a legend of a Mountain of Immortality, China&#x27;s first emperor Qin Shi Huang visited the island three times looking for the elixir. He left a couple of stone inscriptions that are still visible today: 
* During his second visit in 218 BC, he left the inscription: &quot;Arrived at Fu, and carved the stone&quot; (登之罘，刻石).
* The last time he visited (210 BC) he wrote: &quot;Came to Fu, saw an enormous stone, and shot one fish&quot; (至之罘，見巨石，射殺一魚).
Today, there are places like Shihuang Avenue (始皇道 Shihuang Dao), and Fish-shooting Tower (射魚台 Sheyu Tai) named after the emperor. Having failed to discover the elixir, Qin Shihuang dispatched the court sorcerer Xu Fu from Yantai, to sail away and find the elixir of life with hundreds of men and women.

After performing a ceremony in the Yangzhu Temple, Emperor Wudi of the Han dynasty also left an inscription in 94 BC: &quot;Arrived at Zhifu, which floats on Great Ocean. Mountains call out &#x27;Ten thousand years!&quot; (登芝罘，浮大海，山稱萬歲).

Now, the island is mainly a tourist attraction where clams and abalone can be fished here in abundance.

== Geography ==
Located in the Bohai Sea, the island is 4 km from downtown Zhifu and is 10 km x 1 km. Part of Public Road No. 26 connects the western end of the island and the north part of the mainland peninsula. Originally, the island was disconnected from the mainland, but for a period of millennium of years, the sand and soil in the ocean floor built up a 600-metre wide pathway. Thus the island is called the &quot;Mainland-connecting Island&quot; in Chinese (); it could even be considered a small peninsula.

The island&#x27;s largest mountain is Laoye Mountain (老爺山 Lǎoyé Shān) at 294.1m. The Old Lady Stone (婆婆石 Pópó Shí) is on a cliff, at 43.49 metres above sea level, named because of its resemblance to a woman hugging the ocean waves. The southern part of the island is forested.

<text>William Dunbar (1459 or 1460 – by 1530) was a Scottish makar, or court poet, active in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. He was closely associated with the court of King James IV and produced a large body of work in Scots distinguished by its great variation in themes and literary styles. He was probably a native of East Lothian, as assumed from a satirical reference in &quot;The Flyting of Dumbar and Kennedie&quot;. His surname is also spelt &quot;Dumbar&quot;.

==Biography==
Dunbar first appears in the historical record in 1474 as a new student or &quot;determinant&quot; of the Faculty of Arts at the University of St Andrews. Since the customary age for entering a Scottish university at this time was fourteen, a birth-date of 1459 or 1460 has been assumed. At St Andrews, he obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1477 and a master&#x27;s degree in 1479. Details from his later life suggest that he was ordained as a priest at some point, but the date is unknown.

In 1491 and 1492, Dunbar accompanied an embassy to Denmark and France in an unknown capacity. In 1501 and 1502, he participated in an embassy to England in the staff of Andrew Forman, Bishop of Moray.

From 1500 the poet was employed at the court of King James in a role for which he received an annual pension. His duties are not recorded; he is referred to only as a or servant; but it is to this period that the bulk of his poetry can be dated.
Several of Dunbar&#x27;s poems were included in the Chepman and Myllar prints of 1508, the first books to be printed in Scotland.

In 1510, his pension was set at the substantial annual sum of eighty pounds Scots. In comparison, Dunbar&#x27;s contemporary Hector Boece received an annual salary of £26 13s for his role as Principal of King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen.

The last reliable reference to Dunbar is in the Treasurer&#x27;s Accounts for May 1513, where he is recorded receiving payment of his pension. James died at Flodden in September of the same year. In the dislocation that followed, the Treasurer&#x27;s accounts cease for a period and, when resumed in 1515, Dunbar is no longer recorded as being employed by the crown.

A poem, &quot;Quhen the Governour Past in France&quot;, describing the departure of the Regent Albany for France in 1517, is attributed to Dunbar in the Maitland Manuscripts, suggesting that he was still active at the time. But in Sir David Lyndsay&#x27;s work &quot;The Testament and Complaynt of the Papyngo&quot; of 1530, Dunbar is referred to as being deceased. The exact date of his death remains unknown.

==Dunbar&#x27;s poetry==
William Dunbar&#x27;s poetry contained a wide variety of subjects, moods and metres. He wrote many devout religious works and noble courtly pieces but he also produced comic pieces which often made use of scurrilous elements and uninhibited language.

===Commemorative and occasional works===
Some of Dunbar&#x27;s poems were clearly commissioned to mark public events. His allegory &quot;The Thrissil and the Rois&quot; commemorated the marriage of Margaret of England to King James in 1503 while the &quot;Eulogy to Bernard Stewart, Lord of Aubigny&quot; welcomed the arrival of a distinguished Franco-Scottish soldier as the French ambassador in 1508. Local events were also marked such as the visit of Queen Margaret to the &quot; in 1511.

The poem &quot;In Honour of the City of London&quot;, of the medieval urban description genre, was made into a cantata of the same name by William Walton in 1937.

===Religious and moral works===
Dunbar was an ordained priest of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland and several of his works have religious subject matter. &quot;Rorate Celi Desuper&quot;, &quot;Of the Passioun of Christ&quot; and &quot;Done is a Battell on the Dragon Blak&quot; deal with the Nativity, Passion and Resurrection respectively. &quot;Ane Ballat of Our Lady&quot; is a hymn in praise of the Blessed Virgin. &quot;The Table of Confession&quot; discusses sin and confession.

Poems with a secular moral theme also occur in his work such as &quot;Of Deming&quot; and the trilogy of short pieces &quot;Of Discretioun in Asking&quot;, &quot;Of Discretioun in Geving&quot; and &quot;Of Discretioun in Taking&quot;.

Dunbar&#x27;s poems The &quot;Tabill Of Confessioun&quot;, &quot;Rorate Celi Desuper&quot; and &quot;Done Is A Battell On The Dragon Blak&quot; were included in the &quot;Ballatis of Theologie&quot; section of the Bannatyne Manuscript.

===Court entertainment===
Many of the poet&#x27;s pieces appear to provide entertainment for the King, the Queen and his fellow courtiers with comic elements as a recurring theme. The well known &quot;Ane Dance in the Quenis Chalmer&quot; is a comic satire of court life. The notorious flyting with Kennedy was an exchange of outrageous poetic insults with his fellow makar Walter Kennedy while &quot;The Dance of the Seven Deadly Sins&quot; is a series of comic scenes set in Hell.

Poems in the tradition of courtly love are represented in Dunbar&#x27;s work including a short lyric &quot;Sweit Rois of Vertew&quot; and the extended allegory &quot;The Goldyn Targe&quot;.

Other court entertainments were more personal. &quot;Of James Dog&quot; and its sequel &quot;He Is Na Dog, He Is a Lam&quot; describe the poet&#x27;s dealings with the keeper of the Queen&#x27;s wardrobe.

===Satires and commentary on public life===
A recurring theme in Dunbar&#x27;s work is satire. He satirised colleagues of whom he disapproved such as in &quot;The Fenyeit Freir of Tungland&quot; and he urged the burgesses of Edinburgh to show greater civic pride in &quot;To the Merchantis of Edinburgh&quot;. &quot;Tydings Fra The Sessioun&quot; criticised corruption in the Court of Session. In &quot;The Treatise of Mr. Andro Kennedy,&quot; he directs satire at a member of the court of James IV.

Some of Dunbar&#x27;s satirical poems are preserved in the Bannatyne Manuscript, including &quot;The Dregy of Dunbar&quot;, &quot;The Twa Cummeris&quot;, and &quot;The Flyting of Dumbar and Kennedie&quot; to name a few.

===Petitions to the King and personal affairs===
William Dunbar was willing to reveal his personal affairs in his poetry and a number of his works are petitioned to the King asking for personal advancement. He often requested to be appointed to an office in the church, which he refers to as a &quot;benefice&quot;. A typical example is &quot;Quone Mony Benefices Vakit&quot;. On other occasions, his requests were more modest. In &quot;The Petition of The Gray Horse, Auld Dunbar&quot; the poet asked the King for a new suit of clothes to mark Christmas. The poem &quot;Schir, Ye Have Mony Servitouris&quot; makes clear his comparative value to the king and country.

Elsewhere, Dunbar seemed to reveal other aspects of his private life. His famous Memento mori poem &quot;Lament for the Makaris&quot; eulogised his fellow Scottish poets who had passed away. &quot;Meditatioun In Wyntir&quot; considers ageing and the poet&#x27;s frustrated ambitions while &quot;On His Heid-Ake&quot; is apparently an attempt to excuse a lack of productivity by recounting a migraine.

==Work and influence==

Dunbar&#x27;s reputation among his immediate successors was considerable. By later criticism, stimulated in some measure by Scott&#x27;s eulogy that he is &quot;unrivalled by any which Scotland has produced&quot;, he has held the highest place among the makars.

One hundred and one poems have been ascribed to Dunbar. Of these at least ninety are generally accepted as his; of the eleven attributed to him, it would be hard to say that they should not be considered authentic. Most doubt has clung to his verse tale &quot;The Freiris of Berwik&quot;, so much so that it seems unlikely that he was the author. The only copy manuscript of this text is in French, and although the style is very close to that of Dunbar&#x27;s, it is unlikely that he was the author of this anonymous text.

Dunbar&#x27;s chief allegorical poems are &quot;The Goldyn Targe&quot; and &quot;The Thrissil and the Rois&quot;. The motif of the former is the poet&#x27;s futile endeavour, in a dream, to ward off Dame Beauty&#x27;s arrows by Reason&#x27;s &quot;scheld of gold.&quot; When wounded and made prisoner, he discovers the true beauty of the lady: when she leaves him, he is handed over to Heaviness. The noise of the ship&#x27;s guns, as the company sails off, wakes the poet to the real pleasures of a May morning. Dunbar works on the same theme in a shorter poem, known as &quot;Beauty and the Prisoner&quot;. The &quot;Thrissil and the Rois&quot; is a in honour of King James and Queen Margaret.

The greater part of Dunbar&#x27;s work is occasional — personal and social satire, complaints, s and pieces of a humorous character. His best-known orison, usually remembered as &quot;Timor mortis conturbat me&quot; which is repeated as the fourth line of each verse, is titled &quot;Lament for the Makaris&quot; and takes the form of prayer in memory of the medieval Scots poets.

The humorous works show Dunbar at his finest. The best specimen of this work, of which the outstanding characteristics are sheer whimsicality and topsy-turvy humour, is &quot;The Ballad of Kynd Kittok&quot;. This strain runs throughout many of the occasional poems, and is not wanting in odd passages in Dunbar&#x27;s contemporaries; and it has the additional interest of showing a direct historical relationship with the work of later Scottish poets, and chiefly with that of Robert Burns. Dunbar&#x27;s satire often becomes invective. Examples of this type are &quot;The Satire on Edinburgh&quot;, &quot;The General Satire&quot;, the &quot;Epitaph on Donald Owre&quot;, and the powerful vision of &quot;The Dance of the Sevin Deidlie Synnis&quot;. Two satirical ballads lampoon a colleague at court, the would-be aviator John Damian. In &quot;The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedy&quot;, an outstanding specimen of a favourite northern form, analogous to the continental estrif, or tenzone, he and his rival reach a height of scurrility which is certainly without parallel in English literature. This poem has the additional interest of showing the antipathy between the Middle Scots-speakers in the Lothians and the Galwegian Gaelic-speaking population of Carrick, in the south of Ayrshire, where Walter Kennedy was from.

==&quot;Back to Dunbar&quot;==
For the Scottish Literary Renaissance in the mid-twentieth century, Dunbar was a touchstone. Many tried to imitate his style, and &quot;high-brow&quot; subject matter, such as Hugh MacDiarmid and Sydney Goodsir Smith. As MacDiarmid himself said, they had to go &quot;back to Dunbar&quot;. To make Dunbar more accessible to the modern reader &quot;Selected Poems of William Dunbar: An Interlinear Translation&quot; was published by Lawrence Siegler in 2010.

Dunbar is commemorated in Makars&#x27; Court, outside The Writers&#x27; Museum, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh.

<doc id="261450" wikidata="Q4412433" url="?curid=261450" title="Platonic epistemology">
<text>In philosophy, Plato&#x27;s epistemology is a theory of knowledge developed by the Greek philosopher Plato and his followers. 

Platonic epistemology holds that knowledge of Platonic Ideas is innate, so that learning is the development of ideas buried deep in the soul, often under the midwife-like guidance of an interrogator. In several dialogues by Plato, the character Socrates presents the view that each soul existed before birth with the Form of the Good and a perfect knowledge of Ideas. Thus, when an Idea is &quot;learned&quot; it is actually just &quot;recalled&quot;.

Plato drew a sharp distinction between knowledge, which is certain, and mere true opinion, which is not certain. Opinions derive from the shifting world of sensation; knowledge derives from the world of timeless Forms, or essences. In &quot;The Republic&quot;, these concepts were illustrated using the metaphor of the Sun, the analogy of the divided line, and the allegory of the cave.

==Platonic doctrine of recollection==

The &quot;Platonic doctrine of recollection,&quot; or &quot;anamnesis&quot; is the view that we are born possessing all knowledge and our realization of that knowledge is contingent on our discovery of it. Whether the doctrine should be taken literally or not is a subject of debate. The soul is trapped in the body. The soul was once directly acquainted with the Forms, but it is now embodied. It once knew all of the Forms, but forgot them. Recollection is the process of bringing to our attention this knowledge that we have forgotten. This doctrine implies that nothing is ever learned, it is simply recalled or remembered. In short it says that all that we know already comes pre-loaded on birth and our senses enable us to identify and recognize the stratified information in our mind. Recollection involves, on the one hand, overcoming the deceptions and distractions of the body, but, on the other hand, productively using the body&#x27;s deceptions to occasion or trigger the episodes of recollection. The main texts that develop the theory of recollection are the &quot;Phaedo&quot; and &quot;Meno&quot;, although the theory also plays an important role in the &quot;Phaedrus&quot;.

==Metaphor of the Sun==

In the &quot;Republic&quot; (VI 507b-509c), Plato&#x27;s character, Socrates, uses the Sun as a metaphor for the source of &quot;intellectual illumination,&quot; which he held to be &quot;The Form of the Good&quot;. The metaphor is about the nature of ultimate reality and how we come to know it. It starts with the eye, which Socrates says is unusual among the sense organs in that it needs a medium, namely light, in order to operate. The strongest and best source of light is the Sun; with it, we can discern objects clearly. Analogously, for intelligible objects The Form of the Good is necessary in order to understand any particular thing. Thus, if we attempt to understand why things are as they are, and what general categories can be used to understand various particulars around us, without reference to any forms (universals) we will fail completely. In contrast, &quot;the domain where truth and reality shine resplendent&quot; is none other than Plato&#x27;s world of forms, illuminated by the highest of the Forms, that of the Good.

==The divided line==

In the sixth book of the &quot;Republic&quot;, the divided line has two parts that represent the intelligible world and the smaller visible world. Each of those two parts is divided, the segments within the intelligible world represent higher and lower forms and the segments within the visible world represent ordinary visible objects and their shadows, reflections, and other representations. The line segments are unequal and their lengths represent &quot;their comparative clearness and obscurity&quot; and their comparative &quot;reality and truth,&quot; as well as whether we have knowledge or instead mere opinion of the objects.

==Allegory of the cave==

In his best-known dialogue, &quot;The Republic&quot;, Plato drew an analogy between human sensation and the shadows that pass along the wall of a cave - an allegory known as Plato&#x27;s allegory of the cave.

==Charioteer myth==

Along with these other allegories, Plato&#x27;s charioteer myth in the &quot;Phaedrus&quot; (245c-257b) certainly also deserves mention. The ascent of the mind to celestial and trans-celestial realms is likened to a charioteer and a chariot drawn by two winged horses, one dark and one white. Figuratively represented is the famous Platonic &quot;tripartite model&quot; of the soul: the charioteer represents reason, or intellect, the dark horse appetitive passions, and the white horse irascible nature. Only by taming and controlling the two horses can the charioteer ascend to the heavens and enjoy a banquet of divine knowledge. Key epistemological features of the charioteer myth are (1) an emphasis, as with the cave allegory, upon true knowledge as ascent, (2) and the need to tame one&#x27;s passionate nature to obtain true knowledge.

==An example: love and wisdom==
A good example of how Plato presents the acquiring of knowledge is contained in the &quot;Ladder of Love&quot;. In &quot;Symposium&quot; (210a-211b), Plato&#x27;s Socrates cites the priestess Diotima as defining a &quot;lover&quot; as someone who loves and love as a desire for something that one does not have. According to this ladder model of love, a lover progresses from to rung from the basest love to the pure form of love as follows:

#&quot;A beautiful body&quot; - The lover begins here at the most obvious form of love.
#&quot;All beautiful bodies&quot; - If the lover examines his love and does some investigating, he/she will find that the beauty contained in this beautiful body is not original, that it is shared by every beautiful body.
#&quot;Beautiful souls&quot; - After most likely attempting to have every beautiful body, the lover should realize that if a single love does not satisfy, there is no reason to think that many ones will satisfy. Thus, the &quot;lover of every body&quot; must, in the words of Plato, &quot;bring his passion for the one into due proportion by deeming it of little or of no importance.&quot; Instead, the passion is transferred to a more appropriate object: the soul.
#&quot;The beauty of laws and institutions&quot; - The next logical step is for the lover to love all beautiful souls and then to transfer that love to that which is responsible for their existence: a moderate, harmonious and just social order.
#&quot;The beauty of knowledge&quot; - Once proceeding down this path, the lover will naturally long for that which produces and makes intelligible good social institutions: knowledge.
#&quot;Beauty itself&quot; - This is the Form of Beauty. It is not a particular thing that is beautiful, but is instead the essence of beauty. Plato describes this level of love as a &quot;wondrous vision,&quot; an &quot;everlasting loveliness which neither comes nor ages, which neither flowers nor fades.&quot; It is eternal and isn&#x27;t &quot;anything that is of the flesh&quot; nor &quot;words&quot; nor &quot;knowledge&quot; but consists &quot;of itself and by itself in an eternal oneness, while every lovely thing partakes of it.&quot;

Knowledge concerning other things is similarly gained by progressing from a base reality (or shadow) of the thing sought (red, tall, thin, keen, etc.) to the eventual form of the thing sought, or the thing sought itself. Such steps follow the same pattern as Plato&#x27;s metaphor of the sun, his allegory of the cave and his divided line; progress brings one closer and closer to reality as each step explains the relative reality of the past.

<text>George Colley (18 October 1925 – 17 September 1983) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Tánaiste from 1977 to 1981, Minister for Energy from 1980 to 1981, Minister for Tourism and Transport from 1979 to 1980, Minister for the Public Service from 1977 to 1979, Minister for Finance from 1970 to 1973 and from 1977 to 1979, Minister for the Gaeltacht from 1969 to 1973, Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1966 to 1970, Minister for Education from 1965 to 1966 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands from 1964 to 1965. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1961 to 1983.

==Early life==
Colley was born in the Dublin suburb of Fairview, in 1925. He was the son of Harry Colley and Christina Colley (née Nugent). His father was a veteran of the 1916 Easter Rising and a former adjutant in the Irish Republican Army (IRA), who was elected to Dáil Éireann in 1944, as a Fianna Fáil candidate.

He was educated at St Joseph&#x27;s Secondary C.B.S. in Fairview, where one of his classmates and closest friends was Charles Haughey, who later became his political arch-rival. He studied law at University College Dublin and qualified as a solicitor in the mid-1940s. He remained friends with Haughey after leaving school and, ironically, encouraged him to become a member of Fianna Fáil in 1951. Haughey was elected to Dáil Éireann in the 1957 general election, ousting Colley&#x27;s father in the process. This put some strain on the relationship between the two young men.

==Political career==
Colley was elected to the Dáil at the 1961 general election, reclaiming his father&#x27;s old seat in the Dublin North-East constituency. Furthermore, he was elected in the same constituency as Haughey, thereby accentuating the rivalry. Thereafter, Colley progressed rapidly through the ranks of Fianna Fáil. He became a member of the Dáil at a time when a change from the older to the younger generation was taking place, a change facilitated by the Taoiseach Seán Lemass.

He was active in the Oireachtas as chairman of some of the Joint Labour Committees, which were set up under the Labour Court, to fix legally enforceable wages for groups of workers who had not been effectively organised in trade unions. He was also leader of the Irish parliamentary delegation to the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe. Colley&#x27;s work as a backbencher was rewarded by his appointment as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands in October 1964.

===Minister for Education (1965–1966)===
Following the return of Lemass&#x27;s government at the 1965 general election, Colley joined the cabinet as Minister for Education. He introduced a plan to establish comprehensive schools, set up an advisory council on post-primary school accommodation in Dublin, and introduced a school psychological service.

===Minister for Industry and Commerce (1966–1970)===
He was promoted as Minister for Industry and Commerce, in a cabinet reshuffle in July 1966, and he continued the government policy of economic expansion that had prevailed since the late 1950s.

In November 1966, Seán Lemass resigned suddenly as party leader. Colley contested the subsequent leadership election. He was the favoured candidate of party elders such as Seán MacEntee and Frank Aiken, the latter managing Colley&#x27;s campaign and annoyed at Lemass&#x27;s quick decision to retire before Colley had built up his support. Colley was considered to be in the same mould as the party founders, concerned with issues such as the peaceful reunification of the country and the cause of the Irish language. Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney, also declared their interest in the leadership; however, both withdrew when the Minister for Finance, Jack Lynch, announced his candidacy. Colley did not back down and the leadership issue went to a vote for the first time in the history of the Fianna Fáil party.

The leadership election took place on 9 November 1966, and Lynch beat Colley by 59 votes to 19. When the new Taoiseach announced his cabinet, Colley retained the Industry and Commerce portfolio.

Following Fianna Fáil&#x27;s success at the 1969 general election, Colley held onto his existing cabinet post and also took charge of the Gaeltacht portfolio, an area where he had a personal interest. He used this dual position to direct industrial investment to Gaeltacht areas. He set about changing the traditional view of the Irish-speaking regions as backward and promoted their equal claim to the more sophisticated industries being established in Ireland by foreign investment.

===Minister for Finance (1970–1973)===
In the wake of the Arms Crisis in 1970, a major reshuffle of the cabinet took place. Four Ministers, Charles Haughey, Neil Blaney, Kevin Boland and Mícheál Ó Móráin, were either removed, resigned, or simply retired from the government due to the scandal that was about to unfold. Despite his defeat by Jack Lynch in the leadership contest four years earlier, Colley had remained loyal to the party leader and had become a close political ally. He was rewarded by his appointment as Minister for Finance, the second most important position in government, while retaining the Gaeltacht portfolio.

Colley was regarded as a predictable Minister and the ultimate safe man, as a highly orthodox Keynesian. His decision to introduce budget deficits in his first three budgets was even welcomed by the opposition. He oversaw the decimalisation of the Irish currency in 1971. He also championed the introduction of RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta and argued the financial case for it in 1972, as the Minister with responsibility for the Gaeltacht.

===In opposition (1973–1977)===
In 1973, Fianna Fáil was ousted after sixteen years in government when the national coalition of Fine Gael and the Labour Party came to power. Colley was appointed opposition Spokesman on Finance, in the new Fianna Fáil front bench. He came to be regarded as a hard-working spokesman and was a constant critic of what he viewed as the coalition government&#x27;s restrictive economic policy and of the capital taxation which he believed discouraged investment.

As the 1977 general election approached, Colley and Martin O&#x27;Donoghue were the main architects of Fianna Fáil&#x27;s election manifesto. The party&#x27;s programme for government included several inducements, including the abolition of car tax and rates on houses, as it was believed that the coalition government would retain office.

===Tánaiste and Minister (1977–1981)===
Fianna Fáil swept to power at the 1977 general election, with a 20-seat Dáil majority, contrary to opinion polls and political commentators. Colley was re-appointed as Minister for Finance and Minister for the Public Service, and was also appointed as Tánaiste (Deputy Prime Minister). The latter appointment established him as the heir apparent to Taoiseach Jack Lynch.

During his second term as Finance Minister, Colley implemented controversial policies from the election manifesto. He immediately set about dismantling the previous government&#x27;s capital taxation programme while also abolishing the wealth tax and diluting the capital gains and capital acquisition taxes. His policy of low taxation and continued government investment resulted in massive foreign borrowing and a balance of payments deficit. In 1979, Fianna Fáil&#x27;s economic policies were derailed due to strikes, higher wage demands, and the 1979 energy crisis. The introduction of a two per cent levy on agricultural production angered some rural backbench TDs, and party tensions emerged.

In December 1979, Jack Lynch resigned unexpectedly as Taoiseach and as Fianna Fáil leader. It is said that Colley and his supporters encouraged Lynch to retire one month earlier than planned because he felt he had the support to win a leadership contest and that the quick decision would catch Charles Haughey and his supporters off guard.

Support for both candidates was evenly matched throughout the leadership contest. Colley had the backing of the majority of the Cabinet and the party hierarchy, while Haughey relied on support from the first-time backbenchers. A secret ballot was taken on Friday, 7 December 1979. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Michael O&#x27;Kennedy announced his support for Haughey on the eve of the election. This was believed to have swung the vote, and Haughey beat Colley by 44 votes to 38.

Colley remained as Tánaiste but demanded and received a veto on Haughey&#x27;s ministerial appointments to the departments of Justice and Defence. Colley was removed from his position as Minister for Finance and Minister for the Public Service. He declined the position of Minister for Foreign Affairs, preferring instead a domestic portfolio, which resulted in a demotion. He was temporarily appointed Minister for Transport and Tourism, before taking charge of the new Department of Energy. During his brief tenure, he blocked the Nuclear Energy Board&#x27;s controversial plan to build a nuclear power plant at Carnsore Point in County Wexford.

===Later career===
Fianna Fáil lost power at the 1981 general election when a short-lived Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition government took office. Haughey delayed naming a new opposition front bench, but Colley was still a key member of the Fianna Fáil hierarchy.

Fianna Fáil regained office at the February 1982 general election, but there was disquiet about Haughey&#x27;s leadership and the failure to secure an overall majority. Colley demanded the same veto as before on Haughey&#x27;s Defence and Justice appointments, but was refused. When it was revealed that Ray MacSharry would be appointed Tánaiste in his stead, he declined another ministerial position. This effectively brought his front-bench political career to an end, but he remained a vocal critic of the party leadership from the backbenches.

When the Fianna Fáil government collapsed and was replaced by another coalition government after the November 1982 general election, several TDs and Senators expressed a lack of confidence in Haughey&#x27;s leadership once again. Several unsuccessful leadership challenges took place in late 1982 and early 1983, with Colley now supporting Desmond O&#x27;Malley and the Gang of 22 who opposed Haughey.

==Later life and death==
Colley met his future wife, Mary Doolan, on Irish-language courses in the Kerry Gaeltacht. They married on 27 September 1950 and had three sons and four daughters, one of whom, Anne Colley, became a TD as a member of the Progressive Democrats party.

Colley died suddenly on 17 September 1983, aged 57, while receiving treatment for a heart condition at Guy&#x27;s Hospital, London.

<text>George Edward Bateman Saintsbury, FBA (23 October 1845 – 28 January 1933), was an English critic, literary historian, editor, teacher, and wine connoisseur. He is regarded as a highly influential critic of the late 19th and early 20th century.

==Biography==
Born in Lottery Hall, Southampton, he was educated at King&#x27;s College School, London, and at Merton College, Oxford, where he achieved a first class BA degree in Classical Mods, (1865), and a second class in &quot;literae humaniores&quot; (1867). 

He left Oxford in 1868 having failed to obtain a fellowship, and briefly became a master at the Manchester Grammar School, before spending six years in Guernsey as senior classical master of Elizabeth College, where he began his literary career by submitting his first reviews to &quot;The Academy&quot;. From 1874 until he returned to London in 1876, he was headmaster of the Elgin Educational Institute, with a brief period in 1877 on &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;.

From the early 1880s, until 1894 he worked as a writer and subeditor for the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;. Some of the critical essays contributed to the literary journals were afterwards collected in his &quot;Essays in English Literature&quot;, &quot;Essays on French Novelists&quot; (1891), &quot;Miscellaneous Essays&quot; (1892), and &quot;Corrected Impressions&quot; (1895).

In 1895, Saintsbury became professor of rhetoric and English literature at the University of Edinburgh, a position he held until 1915. During his time in Edinburgh, he was a member of the Scottish Arts Club.

In his retirement, he continued to write, while living at 1A Royal Crescent, Bath, Somerset. He died in 1933, at the age of 87, at Royal Crescent in Bath, Somerset.

==Literary criticism==
His first book, &quot;A Primer of French Literature&quot; (1880), and his &quot;Short History of French Literature&quot; (1882), were followed by a series of editions of French classics and of books and articles on the history of French literature, which made him the most prominent English authority on the subject. His studies in English literature were no less comprehensive, and included the valuable revision of Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s edition of John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot; (Edinburgh, 18 vols., 1882–1893), Dryden (1881) in the &quot;English Men of Letters&quot; series, &quot;History of Elizabethan Literature&quot; (1887), &quot;History of Nineteenth Century Literature&quot; (1896), &quot;A Short History of English Literature&quot; (1898, 3rd ed. 1903 – and a book that continued to be reprinted at least into the 1960s), an edition of the &quot;Minor Poets of the Caroline Period&quot; (1905, 1906, 1921), a collection of rare poems of great value, and editions of English classics. He coined the term &quot;Janeite&quot; for a fan of Jane Austen in his introduction to an 1894 edition of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.

He wrote numerous articles on literary subjects (including Pierre Corneille, Daniel Defoe, Clément Marot, Michel de Montaigne, Jean Racine, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire) for the ninth edition (1875–89) of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

In 1901 Saintsbury edited and introduced an English edition of Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s novel series &quot;La Comédie humaine&quot;, translated by Ellen Marriage and published in 1895–98 by J. M. Dent.

For the publisher William Blackwood and Sons, he edited the series of &quot;Periods of European Literature&quot;, contributing volumes on &quot;The Flourishing of Romance and the Rise of Allegory&quot; (1897) and &quot;The Earlier Renaissance&quot; (1901).

Saintsbury subsequently produced some of his most important works: &quot;A History of Criticism&quot; (3 vols., 1900–1904), with the companion volume &quot;Loci Critici: Passages Illustrative of Critical Theory and Practice&quot; (Boston, Mass., and London, 1903), and &quot;A History of English Prosody from the 12th Century to the Present Day&quot; (i., 1906; ii., 1908; iii., 1910); also &quot;The Later Nineteenth Century&quot; (1909). These were followed by a &quot;History of English Prose Rhythm (1912)&quot;, &quot;The English Novel&quot; (1913), &quot;A First Book of English Literature&quot; (1914), &quot;The Peace of the Augustans&quot; (1916), &quot;A History of the French Novel&quot; (2 volumes, 1917–9) and &quot;Notes on a Cellarbook&quot; (1920).

In 1925 he arranged for the publication of a lost recipe book by Anne Blencoe, which had been rediscovered in Weston Hall 200 years after her death. Saintsbury wrote a short introduction to the reissued book.

==Wine==
Although Saintsbury was best known during his lifetime as a scholar, he is also remembered today for his &quot;Notes on a Cellar-Book&quot; (1920), one of the great testimonials to drink and drinking in wine literature. When he was close to death, André Simon arranged a dinner in his honour. Although Saintsbury did not attend, this was the start of the Saintsbury Club, men of letters and members of the wine trade who continue to have dinners to this day.

==Political views==
Saintsbury espoused deeply conservative views in political and social matters. George Orwell calls him a &#x27;confessed reactionary&#x27; in his 1937 book &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot; and cites various extracts from the Scrapbooks which display Saintsbury&#x27;s class-based disdain for the welfare state and paupers.

==Legacy==
T.S. Eliot dedicated the publication of his book &quot;Homage to John Dryden: Three Essays on the Poetry of the 17th Century&quot; (1924) to Saintsbury.

1A Royal Crescent, where Saintsbury lived from 1915 until his death in 1933, was the subject of a restoration and renovation programme by the Bath Preservation Trust during 2012 to reincorporate it into 1 Royal Crescent, of which it was the original servants&#x27; quarters. It opened to visitors for the first time in 2013. An exhibition celebrating Saintsbury&#x27;s life was mounted in the house in 2014.

A biography of Saintsbury, written by Dorothy Richardson Jones and giving extensive commentary on his works, was published in 1992.

<text>A lime is a citrus fruit, which is typically round, lime green in colour, in diameter, and contains acidic juice vesicles.

There are several species of citrus trees whose fruits are called limes, including the Key lime (&quot;Citrus aurantiifolia&quot;), Persian lime, kaffir lime, finger lime, blood lime, and desert lime. Limes are a rich source of vitamin C, are sour, and are often used to accent the flavours of foods and beverages. They are grown year-round. Plants with fruit called &quot;limes&quot; have diverse genetic origins; limes do not form a monophyletic group. The term &quot;lime&quot; originated in other languages (from French , from Arabic , from Persian , ).

==Plants known as &quot;lime&quot;==
The difficulty in identifying exactly which species of fruit are called lime in different parts of the English-speaking world (the same problem applies to synonyms in other European languages) is increased by the botanical complexity of the &quot;Citrus&quot; genus itself, to which the majority of limes belong. Species of this genus hybridise readily; only recently have genetic studies started to shed light on the structure of the genus. The majority of cultivated species are in reality hybrids, produced from the citron (&quot;Citrus medica&quot;), the mandarin orange (&quot;Citrus reticulata&quot;), the pomelo (&quot;Citrus maxima&quot;) and in particular with many lime varieties, the micrantha (&quot;Citrus hystrix&quot; var. micrantha).
* Australian limes (former &quot;Microcitrus&quot; and &quot;Eremocitrus&quot;)
** Australian desert lime (&quot;Citrus glauca&quot;)
** Australian finger lime (&quot;Citrus australasica&quot;)
** Australian lime (&quot;Citrus australis&quot;)
** Blood lime (red finger lime × (sweet orange × mandarin))
* Makrut lime (&quot;Citrus hystrix&quot;); a papeda relative, is one of the three most widely produced limes globally.
* Key lime (&quot;Citrus&quot; × &quot;aurantiifolia&quot;=&quot;Citrus micrantha&quot; × &quot;Citrus medica&quot;) is also one of the three most widely produced limes globally.
* Philippine lime (&quot;Citrus&quot; × &quot;microcarpa&quot;), a kumquat × mandarin hybrid
* Persian lime (&quot;Citrus&quot; × &quot;latifolia&quot;) a key lime × lemon hybrid, is the single most widely produced lime globally, with Mexico being the largest producer.
* Rangpur lime (Mandarin lime, lemandarin, &quot;Citrus limonia&quot;), a mandarin orange × citron hybrid
* Spanish lime (&quot;Melicoccus bijugatus&quot;); not a citrus
* Sweet lime etc. (&quot;Citrus limetta&quot;, etc.); several distinct citrus hybrids
* Wild lime (&quot;Adelia ricinella&quot;); not a citrus
* Wild lime (&quot;Zanthoxylum fagara&quot;); not a citrus
* Limequat (key lime × kumquat)

The tree species known in Britain as lime trees (&quot;Tilia&quot; sp.), called &quot;linden&quot; or &quot;basswood&quot; in other dialects of English, are broadleaf temperate plants unrelated to the citrus fruits.

==History==

Most species and hybrids of citrus plants called &quot;limes&quot; have varying origins within tropical Southeast Asia and South Asia. They were spread throughout the world via migration and trade. The makrut lime, in particular, was one of the earliest citrus fruits introduced to other parts of the world by humans. They were spread into Micronesia and Polynesia via the Austronesian expansion (c. 3000–1500 BCE). They were also later spread into Middle East, and the Mediterranean region via the spice trade and the incense trade routes from as early as ~1200 BCE.

To prevent scurvy during the 19th century, British sailors were issued a daily allowance of citrus, such as lemon, and later switched to lime. The use of citrus was initially a closely guarded military secret, as scurvy was a common scourge of various national navies, and the ability to remain at sea for lengthy periods without contracting the disorder was a huge benefit for the military. British sailors thus acquired the nickname &quot;Limey&quot; because of their use of limes.

==Production==
In 2022, world production of limes (combined with lemons for reporting) was 21.5 million tonnes, led by India, Mexico, and China as the major producers (table).

== Uses ==
=== Culinary ===

Limes have higher contents of sugars and acids than lemons do. Lime juice may be squeezed from fresh limes, or purchased in bottles in both unsweetened and sweetened varieties. Lime juice is used to make limeade, and as an ingredient (typically as sour mix) in many cocktails.

Lime pickles are an integral part of Indian cuisine, especially in South India. In Kerala, the Onam Sadhya usually includes either lemon pickle or lime pickle. Other Indian preparations of limes include sweetened lime pickle, salted pickle, and lime chutney.

In cooking, lime is valued both for the acidity of its juice and the floral aroma of its zest. It is a common ingredient in authentic Mexican, Vietnamese and Thai dishes. Lime soup is a traditional dish from the Mexican state of Yucatan. It is also used for its pickling properties in ceviche. Some guacamole recipes call for lime juice.

The use of dried limes (called black lime or &quot;limoo&quot;) as a flavouring is typical of Persian cuisine, Iraqi cuisine, as well as in Eastern Arabian cuisine &quot;baharat&quot; (a spice mixture that is also called &quot;kabsa&quot; or &quot;kebsa&quot;).

Key lime gives the character flavouring to the American dessert known as Key lime pie. In Australia, desert lime is used for making marmalade.

Lime is an ingredient in several highball cocktails, often based on gin, such as gin and tonic, the gimlet and the Rickey. Freshly squeezed lime juice is also considered a key ingredient in margaritas, although sometimes lemon juice is substituted. It is also found in many rum cocktails such as the daiquiri, and other tropical drinks.

Lime extracts and lime essential oils are frequently used in perfumes, cleaning products, and aromatherapy.

==Nutrition and phytochemicals==
Raw limes are 88% water, 10% carbohydrates and less than 1% each of fat and protein (table). Only vitamin C content at 35% of the Daily Value (DV) per 100 g serving is significant for nutrition, with other nutrients present in low DV amounts (table). Lime juice contains slightly less citric acid than lemon juice (about 47 g/L), nearly twice the citric acid of grapefruit juice, and about five times the amount of citric acid found in orange juice.

Lime pulp and peel contain diverse phytochemicals, including polyphenols and terpenes.

==Toxicity==
Contact with lime peel or lime juice followed by exposure to ultraviolet light may lead to phytophotodermatitis, which is sometimes called margarita photodermatitis or lime disease (not to be confused with Lyme disease). Bartenders handling limes and other citrus fruits while preparing cocktails may develop phytophotodermatitis.

A class of organic chemical compounds called furanocoumarins are reported to cause phytophotodermatitis in humans. Limes contain numerous furanocoumarin compounds, including limettin (also called citropten), bergapten, isopimpinellin, xanthotoxin (also called methoxsalen), and psoralen. Bergapten appears to be the primary furanocoumarin compound responsible for lime-induced phytophotodermatitis.

Lime peel contains higher concentrations of furanocoumarins than lime pulp (by one or two orders of magnitude). Thus lime peels are considerably more phototoxic than lime pulp.

<text>The Human Development Index (HDI) is a statistical composite index of life expectancy, education (mean years of schooling completed and expected years of schooling upon entering the education system), and per capita income indicators, which is used to rank countries into four tiers of human development. A country scores a higher level of HDI when the lifespan is higher, the education level is higher, and the gross national income GNI (PPP) per capita is higher. It was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq and was further used to measure a country&#x27;s development by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)&#x27;s Human Development Report Office.

The 2010 Human Development Report introduced an inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI). While the simple HDI remains useful, it stated that &quot;the IHDI is the actual level of human development (accounting for this inequality), while the HDI can be viewed as an index of &#x27;potential&#x27; human development (or the maximum level of HDI) that could be achieved if there was no inequality.&quot;

The index is based on the human development approach, developed by Mahbub ul-Haq, anchored in Amartya Sen&#x27;s work on human capabilities, and often framed in terms of whether people are able to &quot;be&quot; and &quot;do&quot; desirable things in life. Examples include — being: well-fed, sheltered, and healthy; doing: work, education, voting, participating in community life. The freedom of choice is considered central — someone choosing to be hungry (e.g. when fasting for religious reasons) is considered different from someone who is hungry because they cannot afford to buy food, or because the country is going through a famine.

The index does not take into account several factors, such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country. This situation tends to lower the ranking of some of the most developed countries, such as the G7 members and others.

== Origins ==

The origins of the HDI are found in the annual Human Development Reports produced by the Human Development Report Office of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). These annual reports were devised and launched by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq in 1990, and had the explicit purpose &quot;to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people-centered policies&quot;. He believed that a simple composite measure of human development was needed to convince the public, academics and politicians that they can, and should, evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being.

== Dimensions and calculation ==
=== New method (2010 HDI onwards) ===
Published on 4 November 2010 (and updated on 10 June 2011), the 2010 Human Development Report calculated the HDI combining three dimensions:

* A long and healthy life: Life expectancy at birth
* Education: Mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling
* A decent standard of living: GNI per capita (PPP international dollars)
In its 2010 Human Development Report, the UNDP began using a new method of calculating the HDI. The following three indices are used:

1. Life Expectancy Index (LEI) formula_1
::LEI is equal to 1 when life expectancy at birth is 85 years, and 0 when life expectancy at birth is 20 years.
2. Education Index (EI) formula_2
:2.1 Mean Years of Schooling Index (MYSI) formula_3
:: Fifteen is the projected maximum of this indicator for 2025.
:2.2 Expected Years of Schooling Index (EYSI) formula_4
:: Eighteen is equivalent to achieving a master&#x27;s degree in most countries.
3. Income Index (II) formula_5
::II is 1 when GNI per capita is $75,000 and 0 when GNI per capita is $100.
Finally, the HDI is the geometric mean of the previous three normalized indices:

: formula_6


=== Old method (HDI before 2010) ===
The HDI combined three dimensions last used in its 2009 report:

* Life expectancy at birth, as an index of population health and longevity to HDI 
* Knowledge and education, as measured by the adult literacy rate (with two-thirds weighting) and the combined primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrollment ratio (with one-third weighting).
* Standard of living, as indicated by the natural logarithm of gross domestic product per capita at purchasing power parity.

This methodology was used by the UNDP until their 2011 report.

The formula defining the HDI is promulgated by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). In general, to transform a raw variable, say formula_7, into a unit-free index between 0 and 1 (which allows different indices to be added together), the following formula is used:

* formula_8

where formula_9 and formula_10 are the lowest and highest values the variable formula_7 can attain, respectively.

The Human Development Index (HDI) then represents the uniformly weighted sum with contributed by each of the following factor indices:

* Life Expectancy Index formula_12
* Education Index formula_13
** Adult Literacy Index (ALI) formula_14
** Gross Enrollment Index (GEI) formula_15
* GDP formula_16
== 2022 Human Development Index (2024 report) ==

The Human Development Report 2023/24 by the United Nations Development Programme was released on 13 March 2024; the report calculates HDI values based on data collected in 2022.

Ranked from 1 to 69 in the year 2022, the following countries are considered to be of &quot;very high human development&quot;:

== Past top countries ==
The list below displays the top-ranked country from each year of the Human Development Index. Norway has been ranked the highest sixteen times, Canada eight times, and Switzerland, Japan, and Iceland have each ranked twice.

=== In each original HDI ===
The year represents the time period from which the statistics for the index were derived. In parentheses is the year when the report was published.

== Geographical coverage ==
The HDI has extended its geographical coverage: David Hastings, of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, published a report geographically extending the HDI to 230+ economies, whereas the UNDP HDI for 2009 enumerates 182 economies and coverage for the 2010 HDI dropped to 169 countries.

== Criticism ==

The Human Development Index has been criticized on a number of grounds, including focusing exclusively on national performance and ranking, lack of attention to development from a global perspective, measurement error of the underlying statistics, and on the UNDP&#x27;s changes in formula which can lead to severe misclassification of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;high&quot; or &quot;very high&quot; human development countries.

There have also been various criticism towards the lack of consideration regarding sustainability (which later got addressed by the planetary pressures-adjusted HDI), social inequality (which got addressed by the inequality-adjusted HDI), unemployment or democracy.

=== Sources of data error ===
Economists Hendrik Wolff, Howard Chong and Maximilian Auffhammer discuss the HDI from the perspective of data error in the underlying health, education and income statistics used to construct the HDI. They have identified three sources of data error which are: (i) data updating, (ii) formula revisions and (iii) thresholds to classify a country&#x27;s development status. They conclude that 11%, 21% and 34% of all countries can be interpreted as currently misclassified in the development bins due to the three sources of data error, respectively. Wolff, Chong and Auffhammer suggest that the United Nations should discontinue the practice of classifying countries into development bins because the cut-off values seem arbitrary, and the classifications can provide incentives for strategic behavior in reporting official statistics, as well as having the potential to misguide politicians, investors, charity donors and the public who use the HDI at large.

In 2010, the UNDP reacted to the criticism by updating the thresholds to classify nations as low, medium, and high human development countries. In a comment to &quot;The Economist&quot; in early January 2011, the Human Development Report Office responded to an article published in the magazine on 6 January 2011 which discusses the Wolff &quot;et al.&quot; paper. The Human Development Report Office states that they undertook a systematic revision of the methods used for the calculation of the HDI, and that the new methodology directly addresses the critique by Wolff &quot;et al.&quot; in that it generates a system for continuously updating the human-development categories whenever formula or data revisions take place.

In 2013, Salvatore Monni and Alessandro Spaventa emphasized that in the debate of GDP versus HDI, it is often forgotten that these are both external indicators that prioritize different benchmarks upon which the quantification of societal welfare can be predicated. The larger question is whether it is possible to shift the focus of policy from a battle between competing paradigms to a mechanism for eliciting information on well-being directly from the population.

<text>Australian limes are species of the plant genus &quot;Citrus&quot; that are native to Australia and Papua New Guinea.

These species were formerly included in the genera &quot;Microcitrus&quot; and &quot;Eremocitrus&quot;. They have been used as a food source by indigenous Australians and Indigenous New Guineans as well as early settlers and are used in modern Australian cuisine, including marmalade and sauces.

Species include:


== Species from Australia ==
===Natural species===
*&quot;Citrus australasica&quot; (Finger lime), a species from rainforest regions of northern New South Wales and Southern Queensland with elongated yellow-green to purple fruits. 
*&quot;Citrus australis&quot; (Round lime or Dooja), a species from south-eastern Australia with round, green fruits
*&quot;Citrus glauca&quot; (Desert lime), from arid areas of inland Australia. Small round fruits are produced in summer. 
* &quot;Citrus garrawayi&quot;, (Mount White lime) is rare and endemic to the Cook District of Cape York Peninsula.
* &quot;Citrus gracilis&quot; (Kakadu lime or Humpty Doo lime) grows in eucalypt woodland in the Northern Territory and was first described in the scientific literature in 1998.
* &quot;Citrus inodora&quot; (Russell River lime or large-leaf Australian wild lime) is rare, and endemic to northern Queensland.
* &quot;Citrus maideniana&quot; (Maiden&#x27;s Australian wild lime) may be a subspecies of &quot;C. inodora&quot;.

===Cultivars===

A number of cultivars have been developed in recent years. These can be grafted on to standard citrus rootstocks. They may be grown as ornamental trees in the garden or in containers.
Grafted standards are available for some varieties. The cultivars include:
*&#x27;Australian Outback&#x27; (or &#x27;Australian Desert&#x27;), developed from several desert lime varieties
*&#x27;Australian Red Centre&#x27; (or &#x27;Australian Blood&#x27; or Blood Lime), a cross of finger lime and a mandarin-lemon or mandarin-sweet orange hybrid
*&#x27;Australian Sunrise&#x27;, a hybrid cross of finger lime and a calomondin which is pear shaped and orange inside
* &#x27;Rainforest Pearl&#x27;, a pink-fruited form of finger lime from Bangalow, New South Wales
* &#x27;Sunrise Lime &#x27;, parentage unknown
* &#x27;Outback Lime&#x27;, a desert lime cultivar

== Species from Papua New Guinea ==
* &quot;Citrus warburgiana&quot; (Kakamadu or New Guinea wild lime) grows on the south coast of the Papuan Peninsula near Alotau (pictures).
*&quot;Citrus wakonai&quot; (also locally called kakamadu) has been reported from Goodenough Island.
* &quot;Citrus wintersii&quot;, also known as &quot;Citrus papuana&quot; (Brown River finger lime) has, as the name suggests, a small, thin fruit, pointed at both ends (pictures, more pictures). It grows near Port Moresby.
* &quot;Clymenia sp.&quot; are native to the Bismarck Archipelago but are cultivated in other areas. &quot;Clymenia&quot; is now often considered to belong within the citrus genus.
**&quot;Clymenia platypoda&quot;
**&quot;Clymenia polyandra&quot; has a lemon-sized round fruit, pointed at one end (pictures).

Citrus species in Papua New Guinea have not been extensively studied, so the true number of species is unknown.

== Identification ==
An identification key (p. 6 or 338) exists for the known Australian limes (not including species from Papua New Guinea). The leaves of some species broaden dramatically with age.

<text>Tilia is a genus of about 30 species of trees or bushes, native throughout most of the temperate Northern Hemisphere. The tree is known as linden for the European species, and basswood for North American species. In Great Britain and Ireland they are commonly called lime trees, although they are not related to the citrus lime. The genus occurs in Europe and eastern North America, but the greatest species diversity is found in Asia. Under the Cronquist classification system, this genus was placed in the family Tiliaceae, but genetic research summarised by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group has resulted in the incorporation of this genus, and of most of the previous family, into the Malvaceae.

&quot;Tilia&quot; is the only known ectomycorrhizal genus in the family Malvaceae. Studies of ectomycorrhizal relations of &quot;Tilia&quot; species indicate a wide range of fungal symbionts and a preference toward Ascomycota fungal partners.

== Description ==
&quot;Tilia&quot; species are mostly large, deciduous trees, reaching typically tall, with oblique-cordate (heart-shaped) leaves across. As with elms, the exact number of species is uncertain, as many of the species can hybridise readily, both in the wild and in cultivation. They are hermaphroditic, having perfect flowers with both male and female parts, pollinated by insects.

The &quot;Tilia&quot; sturdy trunk stands like a pillar and the branches divide and subdivide into numerous ramifications on which the twigs are fine and thick. In summer, these are profusely clothed with large leaves and the result is a dense head of abundant foliage.

The leaves of all &quot;Tilia&quot; species are heart-shaped, and most are asymmetrical. The tiny, pea-like fruit hangs attached to a ribbon-like, greenish-yellow bract whose apparent purpose is to launch the ripened seed clusters just a little beyond the parent tree. The flowers of the European and American &quot;Tilia&quot; species are similar, except the American ones bear a petal-like scale among their stamens and the European varieties are devoid of these appendages. All of the &quot;Tilia&quot; species may be propagated by cuttings and grafting, as well as by seed. They grow rapidly in rich soil, but are subject to the attack of many insects. &quot;Tilia&quot; is notoriously difficult to propagate from seed unless collected fresh in fall. If allowed to dry, the seeds go into a deep dormancy and take 18 months to germinate.

=== Etymology ===
The Latin &quot;tilia&quot; is cognate to Greek πτελέᾱ, &quot;ptelea&quot;, &quot;elm tree&quot;, τιλίαι, &quot;tiliai&quot;, &quot;black poplar&quot; (Hes.), ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European word &quot;*ptel-ei̯ā&quot; with a meaning of &quot;broad&quot; (feminine); perhaps &quot;broad-leaved&quot; or similar.

The genus is generally called &quot;lime&quot; or &quot;linden&quot; in Britain and &quot;linden&quot;, &quot;lime&quot;, or &quot;basswood&quot; in North America.

&quot;Lime&quot; is an altered form of Middle English &quot;lind&quot;, in the 16th century also &quot;line&quot;, from Old English feminine &quot;lind&quot; or &quot;linde&quot;, Proto-Germanic &quot;*lindō&quot; (cf. Dutch/German &quot;Linde,&quot; plural &quot;Linden&quot;), cognate to Latin &quot;lentus&quot; &quot;flexible&quot; and Sanskrit &quot;latā&quot; &quot;liana&quot;. Within Germanic languages, English &quot;lithe&quot; and Dutch/German &quot;lind&quot; for &quot;lenient, yielding&quot; are from the same root.

&quot;Linden&quot; was originally the adjective, &quot;made from linwood or lime-wood&quot; (equivalent to &quot;wooden&quot; or &quot;oaken&quot;); from the late 16th century, &quot;linden&quot; was also used as a noun, probably influenced by translations of German romance, as an adoption of &quot;Linden&quot;, the plural of &quot;Linde&quot; in Dutch and German.
Neither the name nor the tree is related to &quot;Citrus&quot; genus species and hybrids that go by the same name, such as Key limes (&quot;Citrus × aurantifolia&quot;). Another common name used in North America is basswood, derived from &quot;bast&quot;, the name for the inner bark (see Uses, below). Teil is an old name for the lime tree.

== Ecology ==


Aphids are attracted by the rich supply of sap, and are in turn often &quot;farmed&quot; by ants for the production of the sap, which the ants collect for their own use, and the result can often be a dripping of excess sap onto the lower branches and leaves, and anything else below. Cars left under the trees can quickly become coated with a film of the syrup (&quot;honeydew&quot;) thus dropped from higher up. The ant/aphid &quot;farming&quot; process does not appear to cause any serious damage to the trees.

== Uses ==
The linden is recommended as an ornamental tree when a mass of foliage or a deep shade is desired. It produces fragrant and nectar-producing flowers and is an important honey plant for beekeepers, giving rise to a pale but richly flavoured monofloral honey. In European and North American herbal medicine, the flowers are also used for herbal teas and tinctures. The flowers are used for herbal tea in the winter in the Balkans. In China, dried &quot;Tilia&quot; flowers are also used to make tea. 

In English landscape gardens, avenues of linden trees were fashionable, especially during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Many country houses have a surviving &quot;lime avenue&quot; or &quot;lime walk&quot;, the example at Hatfield House was planted between 1700 and 1730. The fashion was derived from the earlier practice of planting lindens in lines as shade trees in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and northern France. Most of the trees used in British gardens were cultivars propagated by layering in the Netherlands. 

=== Wood ===
Linden trees produce soft and easily worked timber, which has very little grain and a density of 560 kg/m3. It was often used by Germanic tribes for constructing shields. It is a popular wood for model building and for intricate carving. Especially in Germany, it was the classic wood for sculpture from the Middle Ages onwards and is the material for the elaborate altarpieces of Veit Stoss, Tilman Riemenschneider, and many others. In England, it was the favoured medium of the sculptor Grinling Gibbons (1648–1721). The wood is used in marionette- and puppet-making and -carving. Having a fine, light grain and being comparatively light in weight, it has been used for centuries for this purpose; despite the availability of modern alternatives, it remains one of the main materials used . In China, it was also widely used in carving or furniture, interior decorating, handicrafts, etc. 

Ease of working and good acoustic properties also make limewood popular for electric and bass guitar bodies and for wind instruments such as recorders. Percussion manufacturers sometimes use &quot;Tilia&quot; as a material for drum shells, both to enhance their sound and for their aesthetics.

Linden wood is also the material of choice for window blinds and shutters. Real-wood blinds are often made from this lightweight but strong and stable wood, which is well suited to natural and stained finishes.

In China, 冻蘑/&quot;dongmo&quot; grows well on decomposing logs of &quot;Tilia&quot; trees in the old-growth forest; therefore, people use logs of &quot;Tilia&quot; trees to cultivate &quot;S. edulis&quot; and even black fungus or shiitake mushrooms with excellent results. Currently, &quot;椴木黑木耳/&quot;Tilia&quot;-logs-black fungus&quot; or &quot;椴木香菇/&quot;Tilia&quot;-logs-shiitake mushrooms&quot; has become a term for a method of cultivating black fungus and shiitake mushrooms and &quot;椴木/&quot;Tilia&quot;-logs&quot; no longer exclusively refers to &quot;Tilia&quot; tree wood but also to other woods suitable for black fungus or shiitake mushrooms cultivation.

In Russian, &quot;linden-made&quot; (липовый, &quot;lipoviy&quot;) is a term for forgery, due to the popularity of the material for making forged seals in the past centuries.

=== Bark ===
Known in the trade as basswood, particularly in North America, its name originates from the inner fibrous bark of the tree, known as bast. A strong fibre is obtained from the tree by peeling off the bark and soaking it in water for a month, after which the inner fibres can be easily separated. Bast obtained from the inside of the bark of the &quot;Tilia japonica&quot; tree has been used by the Ainu people of Japan to weave their traditional clothing, the &quot;attus&quot;. Excavations in Britain have shown that lime tree fibre was preferred for clothing there during the Bronze Age. The Manchu people in the mountains of Northeast China made ropes, baskets, raincoats, large fishing nets, and guide lines for gunpowder from the bast. Similar fibres obtained from other plants are also called bast: see Bast fibre.

=== Nectar ===
&quot;Tilia&quot; is a high-quality wild honey plant. In China, &quot;椴树蜜/&quot;Tilia&quot; honey&quot; is produced in the northeast region. White in color, it is called &quot;white honey&quot; or &quot;snow honey&quot;. Heilongjiang is well-known throughout the country for producing high-quality &quot;&quot;Tilia&quot; honey&quot;: Heilongjiang not only has lush &quot;Tilia&quot; trees, but also a rare and excellent bee species - &quot;东北黑蜂/Northeast Black Bee&quot; to collect honey（Raohe County is the location of the national &quot;东北黑蜂自然保护区/Northeast Black Bee Nature Reserve&quot;. It is the only nature reserve for bees in Asia.). &quot;&quot;Tilia&quot; honey&quot; mainly comes from &quot;Tilia amurensis&quot; and &quot;Tilia mandshurica&quot;. &quot;&quot;Tilia&quot; honey&quot; and southern &quot;longan honey&quot; and &quot;lychee honey&quot; are called &quot;China&#x27;s three famous honeys&quot;. &quot;&quot;Tilia&quot; honey&quot;, &quot;rape honey&quot; and &quot;black acacia honey&quot; are the three most productive honeys in China.

=== Phytochemicals ===
The dried flowers are mildly sweet and sticky, and the fruit is somewhat sweet and mucilaginous. Linden flower tea has a pleasing taste, due to the aromatic volatile oil found in the flowers. Phytochemicals in the &quot;Tilia&quot; flowers include flavonoids and tannins with astringent properties.

The nectar contains a major secondary metabolite with the trivial name tiliaside (1-[4-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-1,3-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate]-6-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-β-D-glucopyranose) which is transformed in the gut of bumblebees to the aglycone (i.e., the gentiobiose group is cleaved) which is bioactive against a common and debilitating gut parasite of bumblebees, &quot;Crithidia bombi&quot;. This naturally occurring compound may support bees to manage the burden of disease - one of the major contributors to pollinator decline.

===Other uses===
A beverage made from dried linden leaves and flowers is brewed and consumed as a folk medicine and relaxant in many Eastern European countries. Usually, the double-flowered species are used to make perfumes. The leaf buds and young leaves are also edible raw.

&quot;Tilia&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera; see List of Lepidoptera that feed on &quot;Tilia&quot;.

== In culture ==

In Europe, some linden trees reached considerable ages. A coppice of &quot;T. cordata&quot; in Westonbirt Arboretum in Gloucestershire is estimated to be 2,000 years old. In the courtyard of the Imperial Castle at Nuremberg is a &quot;Tilia&quot;, which by tradition recounted in 1900, was planted by the Empress Cunigunde, the wife of Henry II of Germany &quot;circa&quot; 1000. The &quot;Tilia&quot; of Neuenstadt am Kocher in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, was estimated at 1000 years old when it fell. The Alte Linde tree of Naters, Switzerland, is mentioned in a document in 1357 and described by the writer at that time as already &quot;magnam&quot; (large). A plaque at its foot mentions that in 1155, a linden tree was already on this spot. The Najevnik linden tree (), a 700-year-old &quot;T. cordata&quot;, is the thickest tree in Slovenia. Next to the 英華殿/Yinghua Temple in the Forbidden City in Beijing, there are two &quot;Tilia&quot; trees planted by Empress Dowager Li, the biological mother of Wanli Emperor about five hundred years ago. 

* The excellence of the honey of the far-famed Hyblaean Mountains was due to the linden trees that covered its sides and crowned its summit.
* Lime fossils have been found in the Tertiary formations of Grinnell Land, Canada, at 82°N latitude, and in Svalbard, Norway. Sapporta believed he had found there the common ancestor of the &quot;Tilia&quot; species of Europe and America.

It occupies three rooms in the central office of the Universal Esperanto Association (UEA) in Rotterdam, Netherlands.
The Swiss Esperanto Society opened the library in Switzerland in 1908. In 1912, the library came into the possession of Hector Hodler, the founder of UEA, and after Hodler&#x27;s death in 1920 the library remained under the management of UEA in Switzerland. In 1947, the library was renamed the Hector Hodler Library, and when UEA headquarters relocated to Rotterdam, the library was moved there in 1960.

By 2004, the library held over 15,000 volumes.

Other major collections of Esperanto books are at the International Esperanto Museum, the Montagu C. Butler Library, the Center for Documentation and Study about the International Language in Switzerland, and the German Esperanto Library.

<doc id="261472" wikidata="Q174341" url="?curid=261472" title="İskenderun">
<text>İskenderun (), historically known as Alexandretta (, ) and Scanderoon, is a municipality and district of Hatay Province, Turkey. Its area is 247 km2, and its population is 251,682 (2022). It is on the Mediterranean coast. Located on an alluvial plain, the city was heavily damaged by powerful earthquakes in February 2023 and subsequent aftershocks, floods and fires.

The city&#x27;s history dates back to 333 BC, when it was founded by Alexander the Great as Alexandretta. It subsequently fell under Seleucid rule before being conquered by the Romans. After defeating the Byzantines in the 8th century, the Abbasid Caliphate gained control of the city. During the First Crusade, it came under the control of the Principality of Antioch before being captured by the Mamluk Sultanate.

By the 15th century, the Ottomans had conquered the city, maintaining control over it until the partition of the Ottoman Empire after the Allied victory in World War I. It subsequently became a sanjak in the French mandate of Syria until 1938, when France granted the region independence. The city became part of the Hatay State which in turn united with Turkey in 1939.

==Name==
The city was founded as Alexandria (Ἀλεξάνδρεια) to commemorate Alexander the Great&#x27;s victory over the Persian Darius III at Issus (Cilicia) in (333 BC). Starting in the Middle Ages, Western pilgrims used the diminutive Romance form Alexandretta.

==History==
===Antiquity===
İskenderun preserves the name, but probably not the exact site, of &quot;Alexandria ad Issum&quot;. The settlement was so called having been founded by Alexander the Great in 333 BC to supersede Myriandus as the key to the Syrian Gates, about 37 km (23 miles) south of the scene of his victory at the Battle of Issus against the Persian King Darius III. Alexander camped in the highlands of İskenderun, around &quot;Esentepe&quot;, and then ordered the city to be established and named &quot;Alexandria&quot;. İskenderun is one of many cities founded on Alexander&#x27;s orders, including Alexandria, Egypt. A memorial, a monument and a bronze statue for the victory were raised at the city, and Herodian writes that they were there even during his time, .

The importance of the place comes from its relation to the aforesaid Syrian Gates, the easiest approach to the open ground of Hatay Province and Aleppo. Because of its hilly, rough surroundings, the city also went by the name of &quot;Alexandria Scabiosa&quot; (&#x27;Alexandria the Mountainous&#x27;).

===Ecclesiastical history===

The bishopric of Alexandria Minor was a suffragan of Anazarbus, the capital and so also the ecclesiastical metropolis of the Roman province of Cilicia Secunda. Greek menologia speak of Saint Helenus, and the martyr saints Aristio and Theodore as early bishops of the See. But the first documented one is Hesychius, who took part in the First Council of Nicaea in 325 and in a synod at Antioch in 341. Philomusus participated in the First Council of Constantinople in 381. Baranes is mentioned in connection with a synod at Antioch in 445. At the Council of Chalcedon in 451, Julianus was represented by his metropolitan, Cyrus of Anazarbus. Basilius was at the synod in Constantinople in 459 that condemned simoniacs. In 518, Paulus was deposed by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian for supporting the Jacobite Severus of Antioch.

No longer a residential diocese, Alexandria Minor is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see. In that list it was long named Cambysopolis, but the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; now gives the correct ancient name.

===Ottoman era===
There was fighting here under the Ottoman Empire: in 1606 the army of General Kuyucu Murat Pasha suppressed the Jelali revolts. The Ottomans continued to fortify the city, and the remains of the early 17th-century Ottoman castle walls can still be seen where the Güzün stream crosses the Varyant road. The city was well described in 1675 by the English naval chaplain Henry Teonge in his diary. The next army to cross the Belen Pass and attack Anatolia through here were the Egyptians of Muhammad Ali in 1832.
However, in the later Ottoman period the city developed as the main port on the Mediterranean for the overland trade from Baghdad and India, which had great importance until the establishment of the Egyptian overland route. Alexandretta served as a base, first for Genoese and Venetian merchants, then Western and Northern European merchants. The British Levant Company maintained an agency and factory here for 200 years, until 1825, in spite of high mortality among its employees because of regional disease, some due to lack of sanitation systems. During the 19th century the port grew, and the road to Aleppo was improved. Sanitation was also improved, and the railway was built in 1912.

At the outset of World War I, when Britain was contemplating the partition of the Ottoman Empire, Lord Kitchener considered the conquest of Alexandretta to be essential in providing Britain with a port and railhead from which to access Iraq. He proposed a new railway be built to the east from Alexandretta, which would greatly reduce the time for reaching India from the UK. The De Bunsen Committee (8 April – 30 June 1915), a British inter-departmental group which was set up to discuss the issue in greater detail, preferred Haifa for this purpose.

Ultimately the British decided not to attack the Ottoman Empire via Alexandretta. On 8 February 1915 the French foreign minister, Théophile Delcassé, protested to Britain&#x27;s Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey about such an attack, citing a commitment that Britain made in 1912 that it had no designs on Syria. The German field marshal, Hindenburg, later said that 
Perhaps not the whole course of the war, but certainly the fate of our Ottoman Ally, could have been settled out of hand, if England had secured a decision in that region, or even seriously attempted it. Possession of the country south of the Tauras [mountains] would have been lost to Turkey at a blow if the English had succeeded in landing at Alexandretta. Armenians, who have maintained a cultural and economic presence in Iskenderun for centuries, most notably due to trade, were wiped out in the Hamidian Massacres, Adana Massacres, and the Armenian genocide, after centuries of discrimination.

===Republic of Hatay===

Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of the First World War, most of Hatay including İskenderun was occupied by French troops.

In July 1920 the San Remo conference did not assign Alexandretta sanjak to Turkey.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi_10.1093/ia/iix118&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1921 and 1937, the city was part of the autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta within French-controlled Syria, under the League of Nations French Mandate of Syria and the Lebanon.

The Republic of Hatay was founded in 1938 and, in 1939, it joined the Republic of Turkey after a referendum. The referendum was, and still is, regarded as illegitimate, as the Turkish government moved supporters into the city and the Turkish Army &quot;expelled most of the province&#x27;s Alawite Arabs, Greek and Armenian majority&quot; to decide the referendum result.

In the 2010s Syria still claimed against Turkey its sovereignty on the Alexandretta region.

=== Modern era ===
At the 2013 reorganisation, İskenderun district lost a large part of its territory to the new district Arsuz.

In February 2023, the city was heavily damaged by powerful earthquakes and subsequent floods and fires. On 8 February 2023, the fire at the Port of Iskenderun was extinguished but broke out again the next day.

<doc id="261473" wikidata="Q1852987" url="?curid=261473" title="States of the German Confederation">
<text>The states of the German Confederation were member states of the German Confederation, from 20 June 1815 until 24 August 1866.

On the whole, its territory nearly coincided with that remaining in the Holy Roman Empire at the outbreak of the French Revolution, with the notable exception of Belgium. Except for the two rival major powers, Austria and Prussia, and the western left bank of the Rhine (which France had annexed, with tiny Katzenelnbogen), the other member states (or their precursors) had been within Napoleon&#x27;s Confederation of the Rhine. 

== Empire ==
1. The Austrian Empire, excluding the Kingdom of Hungary, the Principality of Transylvania, and the Kingdom of Croatia (all of which became parts of the apostolic kingdom of Hungary within the Danubian Dual Monarchy), the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia (constituting parts lost to Italy in 1859- viz. 1866), the Duchy of Bukovina, and the kingdoms of Dalmatia and Galicia (but including, from 1818 till 1850, Duchy of Oświęcim and Duchy of Zator)
#Archduchy of Austria (split into Upper Austria and Lower Austria in 1849)
#Kingdom of Bohemia
#Margraviate of Moravia

10. The Grand Duchy of Luxemburg (in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands; lost over half of its territory in the west to Belgium in the breakup of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1839, thereby resulting in the Duchy of Limburg becoming a member.)

11. The Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin

12. The Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz

13. The Grand Duchy of Oldenburg

14. The Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach

== Duchies ==
15. The Duchy of Brunswick (prior Brunswick-Lunenburgian Principality of Wolfenbüttel)

16. The Duchy of Holstein (in personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark; not a former member of the Confederation of the Rhine)

17. The Duchy of Limburg (became a member in 1839 in personal union with the Netherlands as compensation for territorial losses in the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg that were caused by the breakup of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.)

18. The Duchy of Nassau

19. The Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (Saxe-Coburg and Gotha from 1826)

20. The Duchy of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (Saxe-Altenburg from 1826)

21. The Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen (dissolved in 1826; territory merged with Saxe-Meiningen)

22. The Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg (in personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark)

23. The Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen

24. The Duchy of Anhalt-Bernburg (merged with Anhalt-Dessau in 1863)

26. The Duchy of Anhalt-Köthen (merged with Anhalt-Dessau in 1853)

The Duchy of Schleswig was never a member state. But Schleswig was traditionally connected to the duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg, which were member states. In 1848-51 (during the First Schleswig War), it was treated by the German states and the short-lived German Empire as a kind of member. In 1864, the Danish king transferred the three duchies to Austria and Prussia (after the Second Schleswig War).

<text>John Rastell (or Rastall) (c. 1475 – 1536) was an English printer, author, member of parliament, and barrister.

==Life==
Born in Coventry, he is vaguely reported by Anthony à Wood to have been &quot;educated for a time in grammaticals and philosophicals&quot; at Oxford. He became a member of Middle Temple, and practised as a barrister, but established a printing business in London c.1512. He also devised pagaentries for the king. Amongst works he published, in a preface to &quot;Liber assisarum et placitorum corone&quot; (1514?) he announced the forthcoming publication of Sir Anthony Fitzherbert&#x27;s &quot;Abbreviamentum librorum legum Anglorum&quot;, dated 1516. Among the works issued from the &quot;sygne of the meremayd at Powlysgate,&quot; where he lived and worked from 1520 onwards, are &quot;The Mery Gestys of the Wydow Edyth&quot; (1525), and &quot;A Dyaloge of Syr Thomas More&quot; (1529). The last of his dated publications was &quot;Fabyl&#x27;s Ghoste&quot; (1533), a poem. In 1529 he became M.P. (Member of Parliament) for Dunheved, Cornwall

In 1530 he wrote, in defence of the Catholic doctrine of Purgatory, &quot;A New Boke of Purgatory&quot; (1530), dialogues on the subject between &quot;Comyngs and Almayn a Christen man, and one Gyngemyn a Turke.&quot; This was answered by John Frith in &quot;A Disputacion of Purgatorie&quot;. Rastell replied with an &quot;Apology against John Fryth&quot;, also answered by the latter. Rastell had married Elizabeth, sister of Sir Thomas More, with whose Catholic theology and political views he was initially in sympathy. More had begun the controversy with John Frith, and Rastell joined him in attacking the Protestant writer, who, says John Foxe (&quot;Actes and Monuments&quot;, ed. G Townsend, vol. v. p. 9), did so &quot;overthrow and confound&quot; his adversaries that he converted Rastell to his side.

Separated from his Catholic friends, Rastell does not seem to have been fully trusted by the opposite party, for in a letter to Thomas Cromwell, written probably in 1536, he says that he had spent his time in upholding the king&#x27;s cause and opposing the pope, with the result that he had lost both his printing business and his legal practice, and was reduced to poverty. He was imprisoned in 1536, perhaps because he had written against the payment of tithes. He probably died in prison, and his will, of which Henry VIII had originally been appointed an executor, was proved on 18 July 1536. He left two sons: William Rastell and John Rastell the Younger, the latter of whom accompanied Richard Hore on his ill-fated expedition. The Jesuit, John Rastell (1532-77), who has been frequently confounded with him, was no relation.

==Works==

===&quot;The Pastyme of People&quot; (1529)===
Rastell&#x27;s best-known work is &quot;The Pastyme of People, the Chronycles of dyvers Realmys and most specially of the Realme of England&quot; (1529), a chronicle dealing with English history from the earliest times to the reign of Richard III, edited by Thomas Frognall Dibdin in 1811.

===Legal works: &quot;Abbreviacion&quot; (1519) and &quot;Expositiones&quot; (1527)===

His best known legal works are &quot;The Abbreviacion of Statutis&quot; (1519) and &quot;Expositiones terminorum legum Angliae&quot; (1527). The original Law French edition of the &quot;Expositiones&quot; did not appear again. However, in 1567 it was translated into English as &quot;Expositions of the terms of the laws of England&quot;. Many editions then followed over the next 150 years. After 1620, the &quot;Expositions&quot; was known as &quot;Les Termes de la Ley&quot;.

===&quot;The Four Elements&quot; (circa 1519)===
Rastell was also the author of a morality play, &quot;A new Interlude and a Mery of the Elements&quot;, or &quot;The Four Elements&quot; written about 1519, which is no doubt the &quot;large and ingenious comedy&quot; attributed to him by Wood.

The unique copy in the British Library is incomplete, and contains neither the date nor the name of the author, identified with John Rastell on the authority of John Bale, who catalogued &quot;Natura Naturata&quot; among his works, adding a Latin version of the first line of the piece. This interlude was printed in William Carew Hazlitt&#x27;s edition of &quot;Dodsley&#x27;s Old English Plays&quot;, by James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps for the Percy Soc. (&quot;Early English Poetry&quot;, vol. 22, 1848), and by Julius Fischer. See also an article by Henry R. Plomer, who unearthed in the Record Office an account of a lawsuit (1534–35) in connection with Rastell&#x27;s premises at the &quot;Mermaid&quot;. For the books issued from his press see a catalogue by Robert Proctor, in &quot;Handlists of English Printers&quot; (Bibliographical Soc., 1896).

==Printer of music==
He was also the first English printer of polyphonic music, which he began issuing in the 1520s. The practice of printing music from a single impression i.e. using pieces of type that print staves, notes and text together, was apparently first practiced by Rastell in London about 1520. Two different broadside songsheets printed by him survive, dated to about 1523; two survivals of ephemeral unbound works from such an early date suggest that he may have printed a considerable amount of music. The texts are in English, suggesting they were for the local market, not export. After his death, the musical type were acquired by John Gough.

<text>Ernest John Smeed Moeran (31 December 1894 – 1 December 1950) was an English composer whose work was strongly influenced by English and Irish folk music of which he was an assiduous collector. His output includes orchestral pieces, concertos, chamber and keyboard works, and a number of choral and song cycles as well as individual songs.

The son of a clergyman, Moeran studied at the Royal College of Music under Charles Villiers Stanford before service in the army during the First World War, in which he was wounded. After the war he was a pupil of John Ireland, and quickly established a reputation as a composer of promise with a number of well-received works. From 1925 to 1928 he shared a cottage with the composer Peter Warlock; the bohemian lifestyle and heavy drinking during this period interrupted his creativity for a while, and sowed the seeds of the alcoholism that would blight his later life. He resumed composing in the 1930s, and re-established his reputation with a series of major works, including a symphony and a violin concerto. From 1934 onwards he spent much of his time in Ireland, mainly in the coastal town of Kenmare.

In 1945 Moeran married the cellist Peers Coetmore, and for her he composed several works for cello. The marriage was not destined to last, and Moeran&#x27;s final years were lonely. He died at Kenmare on 1 December 1950, having fallen into the water after suffering a cerebral haemorrhage. A second symphony was left unfinished at the time of his death. Composer Anthony Payne declared that &quot;Moeran occupied a minor place in the music of his time, but his meticulously polished and ready technique is unsurpassed among his British contemporaries. This craftsmanship is evident in the clarity of his textures and processes, and in the superb sonority of his orchestral writing&quot;.

==Life==
===Early life===
Moeran was born on 31 December 1894, at the Spring Grove vicarage, Heston, Middlesex, the second son of an Anglo-Irish clergyman, The Rev. Joseph William Wright Moeran, vicar of St Mary&#x27;s, Spring Grove, and Ada Esther Smeed, née Whall, who came from Norfolk. Joseph subsequently served in several country parishes in southern and eastern England, including Salhouse in Norfolk, before his retirement on health grounds when Ernest was 13. The household was cultured; Ada was a talented pianist and singer, and Ernest began music lessons from the age of five or six. His initial education was under a governess at home, after which, in 1904, he attended Suffield Park preparatory school in Cromer. In 1908 he went to Uppingham School, where he studied music under Robert Sterndale Bennett, grandson of the composer William Sterndale Bennett. He became a proficient pianist, and learned the violin sufficiently to be able to perform in chamber groups; he also began to compose. In 1913 he entered the Royal College of Music (RCM), initially as a piano student, but switching to composition under Charles Villiers Stanford after his first year. He also became a member of the Oxford and Cambridge Musical Club, an important body whose members included Vaughan Williams, George Butterworth and Adrian Boult; Parry and Elgar were honorary members. A few sketches of piano compositions attempted in this prewar RCM period survive in manuscript form.

===First World War===
Moeran was 19 when his studies at the RCM were interrupted in August 1914 by the outbreak of the First World War. He enlisted as a motor cycle dispatch rider in the 6th (cyclist) battalion of the Royal Norfolk Regiment, and the following year was commissioned second lieutenant. He did not altogether abandon his musical activities; on leaves in Norfolk, he began to collect folk music. In early 1917 his unit was sent to France, and on 3 May, during the Second Battle of Bullecourt, he received a wound in the head. According to several accounts, this wound required emergency surgery, including the insertion of a metal plate into the skull, and commentators have attributed 
Moeran&#x27;s later instabilities and erratic behaviour, and his eventual development of alcoholism, to the primitive surgery and after-effects of this wound. However, other evidence suggests that the wound was less severe, that no metal plate was necessary, and that he made a rapid recovery. He was reported, in August 1917, as performing a very demanding piano piece at a London concert, indicating that he was in a reasonable state of fitness at that time.

After a period of convalescence he returned to military duty, and saw out the rest of the war in Ireland, at Boyle, County Roscommon, attached to a transport section of the Royal Irish Constabulary. He used this period in Ireland to engage with his Irish roots, and spent time collecting folk songs. In London, just before his discharge from the army in January 1919, Moeran met the composer Arnold Bax, who described him at that time &quot;as charming and as good-looking a young officer as one could hope to meet&quot;.

===Emerging composer===
Following demobilisation in January 1919, Moeran returned to England. Some accounts report that he was briefly employed as a music master at his old school, Uppingham, but there is no evidence from the school for this. He appears to have returned to Ireland for a while before resuming his studies at the RCM, under John Ireland. His association with the RCM did not last long, but he continued to receive tuition in composition from John Ireland in a private capacity. Moeran&#x27;s biographer Geoffrey Self observes that from this point &quot;the main influences to be heard in his music were now in place: his teacher, his Irish and East Anglian heritages, and his love of rural England.&quot;

An allowance from his mother relieved Moeran from the necessity of earning a living, and with this financial independence he was able to devote his time to study and composition. The Oxford &amp; Cambridge Musical Club gave him the means by which his works could be performed. In five productive years following the end of the war, he established his reputation as a composer with a steady stream of works across a range of genres. According to the critic Herbert Foss, these early pieces display a fluency that was often absent in later years. They include numerous songs, a number of piano and chamber works and, on a larger canvas, his first attempts at orchestral writing, the symphonic &quot;In The Mountain Country&quot; and two Rhapsodies. These early orchestral pieces indicate the influences of Delius and Vaughan Williams, but also demonstrate the emergence of a distinct, individual voice.

During this period, Moeran collected many folk tunes from rural pubs in Norfolk. His contribution to this area of work was recognised in 1923, when he was elected to the committee of the Folksong Society. As his reputation grew, he formed important friendships with leading figures on the musical scene, among whom was Hamilton Harty, who conducted a performance of Moeran&#x27;s second orchestral Rhapsody and afterwards commissioned a symphony from the young composer. Moeran struggled with this challenge, but at this stage in his career was unable to deliver to his own satisfaction, and the project was set aside for the time being. Another important friendship formed around this time was with the writer, critic and composer Philip Heseltine (better known by his pseudonym Peter Warlock), Moeran&#x27;s exact contemporary and like him a prolific songwriter. Heseltine was a great admirer of Moeran; in a 1924 review of the latter&#x27;s early work, he wrote: &quot;[T]here is no British composer from whom we may more confidently expect work of sound and enduring quality in the next ten years than from Jack Moeran; there is certainly no one of his years who has as yet achieved so much&quot;.

===Heseltine and Eynsford===
The friendship between Moeran and Heseltine deepened, and in 1925 they rented a cottage at Eynsford in Kent, together with the artist Hal Collins. The cottage attracted many visitors from the musical and artistic worlds, and soon became notorious as a centre for wild parties and other extravagances, involving heavy drinking. The excessive alcoholic consumption seemed to have little effect on Heseltine, who continued to work productively, but the opposite was true of Moeran, whose creativity soon began to suffer. He found it difficult to cope with the distractions provided by the cottage; his compositional output tailed off and finally ceased altogether, and he dropped out of the London musical scene, no longer attending the Oxford and Cambridge Musical Club. Furthermore, he was falling into alcoholism, and was also under the spell of Heseltine&#x27;s stronger personality. Moeran later admitted a loss of faith in his abilities, finding that the longer he delayed, the harder it was to resume work.

The few works completed during the Eynsford years (1925–1928) include his single collaboration with Heseltine, a drinking song called &quot;Maltworms&quot;, written for performance at a drama festival at the nearby village of Shoreham. Heseltine wrote a tune for the first two lines, Moeran continued with the next lines, and so on. Parts were scored for the village brass band, but in the event the song was withdrawn from the festival and the band parts have been lost, but a piano-accompanied version survived and was performed in the village pub.

Moeran left the cottage in 1928, but the effects of his alcoholism remained. In August 1929 he was fined £10 by the Watford magistrates for being drunk in charge of a motor vehicle; that same year he went with Heseltine and others to France, ostensibly to meet Delius. The trip degenerated into a drunken binge, during which Moeran passed out in the street. When Heseltine died in December 1930, probably by his own hand, Moeran was devastated. He wrote to Heseltine&#x27;s mother: &quot;His loss will mean a terrible gap to me when I get back to normal life and find he is no longer there&quot;.

===Re-establishment===
After leaving Eynsford, Moeran returned to his parents&#x27; home and began to pick up the threads of his compositional career. He had not been entirely forgotten by the musical establishment; in January 1930, the critic Hubert Foss wrote a reappraisal of Moeran&#x27;s earlier works, referring to the composer&#x27;s &quot;over-long silence&quot;, but saw hope for the future: &quot;One hopes that out of this &quot;corpus&quot; of early works a symphonic mind may grow, one that with intensity of form as well as intensity of utterance, will give us real music on a big scale&quot;.

An accident early in 1930 led to a period of convalescence which provided an opportunity for Moeran to reconsider his style. Gradually, new works were forthcoming: the Sonata for two violins (1930), the String Trio (1931), two orchestral pieces – &quot;Wythorne&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (1931), and &quot;Lonely Waters&quot; (1932). A choral work, &quot;Songs of Springtime&quot;, a setting of seven Elizabethan poems, followed in 1933. &quot;Wythorne&#x27;s Shadow&quot; was written possibly as a memorial for Heseltine. Several songs, including a cycle of six Suffolk folksongs, indicated the continuing importance of folk music to Moeran, and in 1931 he rejoined the committee of the Folksong Society. He also wrote some sacred music, to which he attached little value – &quot;this tripe for the church&quot;, he called it, adding that he only did it for the money.

Moeran led an itinerant life in the 1930s, staying at his parents&#x27; various homes or with friends. However, as the decade progressed, he became more interested in his Irish roots, and began to spend large parts of the year in a cottage in Kenmare, County Kerry, where he became a well known and popular figure; Arnold Bax recorded a local comment: &quot;If ever there was a move to elect a mayor of this town, Jack Moeran would be everybody&#x27;s first choice&quot;. The peace that he found in rural Ireland inspired him to return, in 1934, to the long-abandoned symphony project. In the midst of this burgeoning creativity, Moeran continued to experience problems with alcoholism. In January 1935 he was ordered to spend nine months in a nursing home, having been found guilty in Cambridge of being drunk in charge of a motor vehicle. This interrupted but did not derail his work on the symphony, which was finally completed in 1937 and received its premiere in January 1938 in the Queen&#x27;s Hall, under Leslie Heward. Heward went on to make an acclaimed recording of the Symphony with the Halle Orchestra at the end of 1942.

The years following the performance of the symphony were fruitful, and produced a number of significant works. These included the Violin Concerto (1937–41), written largely in Ireland and reflecting strong Irish influences; the madrigal suite &quot;Phyllida and Corydon&quot; (1939), possibly influenced by the music of Bernard van Dieren; the Rhapsody in F ♯ for piano and orchestra (1943), written for the pianist Harriet Cohen; the short Overture for a Masque (1944), commissioned by the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA); and the Sinfonietta (1944), inspired in part by the hills of the Welsh border country in Radnorshire, the latest location of the family home.

===Final years===
Possibly as early as 1930, Moeran had met the cellist (Kathleen) Peers Coetmore. In 1943 they renewed their acquaintance, and a relationship developed, which inspired two of Moeran&#x27;s important late works: the Cello Concerto (1945), and the Sonata for Cello and Piano (1947). They were married on 26 July 1945. Although the marriage brought Moeran some initial happiness and stability, Coetmore&#x27;s ambitions, and the demands for her services, meant that they were often apart, and the relationship became increasingly strained. Moeran was drinking heavily, which led to further estrangement. By 1949, when Coetmore departed for an extended tour of South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, the marriage was effectively over.

Moeran produced three further late works: the Fantasy Quartet for oboe and strings (1946), written for Leon Goossens; the orchestral Serenade in G (1948), and a final song collection, Songs from County Kerry (1950). Throughout these years he struggled to complete a second symphony, and although he composed a large part of this work, he was repeatedly dissatisfied with the results. In 1949 he was under further treatment for alcoholism; the first performance of the symphony had originally scheduled for the spring of 1949 but this was put back, first until 1950 and then for a further year. In March 1950 Moeran was in Ireland, writing to Coetmore of his hopes for finishing the symphony there. He settled first in a place near Dublin, but by June he was back in Kenmare. By now his mental state was poor, and he worried that he was losing his mind. There is no record of further work on the symphony project.

On 1 December 1950, during a heavy winter storm, Moeran left his cottage and walked along the Kenmare pier, where he was seen to fall into the water. His body was retrieved; at first it was thought that he had drowned, possibly in an act of suicide, but medical evidence indicated that he had suffered a cerebral haemorrhage and had died before entering the water. After a well-attended funeral he was buried in the churchyard at Kenmare.

==Music==
Moeran came late in the canon of last major British composers heavily influenced by folk-song and thus belongs to the lyrical tradition of such composers as Delius, Vaughan Williams and Ireland. The influence of the nature and landscapes of Norfolk and Ireland are also often evident in his music. Some of his larger-scale orchestral pieces were composed (or at least conceived) whilst Moeran walked the hills of western England, particularly in Herefordshire, and Ireland, where the grandness of the mountain ranges of Kerry inspired him greatly. Moeran was capable of conveying a wide range of emotions through his music and wasn&#x27;t afraid of writing in a darker and harsher idiom when it suited him. His style is conservative but not derivative.

By Moeran&#x27;s time, however, such a style was already seen as somewhat dated and he never made a big breakthrough as a composer despite the success of the sombre, Sibelian Symphony in G minor (1934–1937) that is generally regarded as his masterpiece. The Symphony stands along with the Symphony No. 1 of Sir William Walton as one of the two tightest and most controlled symphonies emanating from the British Isles of the inter-war era. The Moeran work demonstrates a robust sonata form in the first movement, along with a questioning harmonic structure, which, on first examination, may appear orthodox, but which on deeper analysis indicates the dichotomy of the interval of the fifth (which is European diatonic) with the interval of the fourth, which is both the completion of the European fifth, but also introduces the Irish dimension, in which the fourth can be the predominant interval.

Though he first received favourable critical attention for his chamber music and continued to compose significant works in this genre, his greatest achievements in general are to be found among his few large-scale orchestral works, including a Violin Concerto, Cello Concerto, Sinfonietta, and Serenade.

Moeran was very interested in &quot;folk&quot; music and used an extensive collection of songs that he had notated in Norfolk pubs as part of his creative material. He also made great use of Irish music. The Norfolk material can be sensed in the piano works of the early 1920s. The Irish influence is seen within the second movement of the Violin Concerto (Puck Fair at Killorglin?) and even more so in the second movement of the String Quartet in E-flat, as well as in the Cello Concerto, in which fragments of Irish music, in particular &quot;The Star of County Down&quot; (also used by Vaughan Williams in his &quot;Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus&quot;), are evident.

Another facet to the music of Moeran is the madrigal. He once stated to a friend that if he were ever arrested and thus forced to state his profession, he would have to say it was that of being a madrigalist. Moeran was capable of staggering harmonic invention whilst working within the madrigal form – in &quot;Spring the Sweet Spring&quot; the harmonies progress from those of the madrigal into harmonies of a jazz style reminiscent of Duke Ellington; full of contradictions and added-note chords. The Serenade, an orchestral work, evinces madrigalist harmony re-worked by Moeran into an astringent style in which acerbic tonal and harmonic patterns are grafted onto the madrigalist basis to produce music of outstanding freshness and originality that surely places Moeran into the genre of inventive twentieth-century music, rather than into the &quot;English Pastoral School&quot;, which, in itself, is arguably a misnomer.

Although he was not by any means a prolific church composer, his Services in D and E-flat are still performed today.

Recently, there has been more interest in and many recordings of Moeran&#x27;s works, but some of them, such as the songs to poems by A. E. Housman and James Joyce, still remain relatively unknown.

Over 40 of his manuscripts, including that of his unfinished Second Symphony in E-flat, were bequeathed by his widow Peers Coetmore to the Victorian College of the Arts, now part of the University of Melbourne.

Conductor Martin Yates has realised and completed the Symphony No. 2 from sketches. A recording of the work with Yates conducting the Royal Scottish National Orchestra was released in October 2011 on the Dutton Epoch label (together with the early Overture based on the G major Symphony, and Yates&#x27; own orchestration of &quot;Sarnia&quot; by John Ireland).

<doc id="261479" wikidata="Q185292" url="?curid=261479" title="Quipu">
<text>Quipu ( ), also spelled khipu, are recording devices fashioned from knotted cords. They were historically used by various cultures in the central Andes of South America, most prominently by the Inca Empire.

A &quot;quipu&quot; usually consists of cotton or camelid fiber cords, and contains categorized information based on dimensions like color, order and number. The Inca, in particular, used knots tied in a decimal positional system to store numbers and other values in &quot;quipu&quot; cords. Depending on its use and the amount of information it stored, a given &quot;quipu&quot; may have anywhere from a few to several thousand cords.

Objects which can unambiguously be identified as &quot;quipus&quot; first appear in the archaeological record during 1st millennium CE, likely attributable to the Wari Empire. &quot;Quipus&quot; subsequently played a key part in the administration of the Kingdom of Cusco of the 13th to 15th centuries, and later of the Inca Empire (1438–1533), flourishing across the Andes from to 1532. Inca administration used &quot;quipus&quot; extensively for a variety of uses: monitoring tax obligations, collecting census records, keeping calendrical information, military organization, and potentially for recording simple and stereotyped historical &quot;annales&quot;. 

It is not known exactly how many intact &quot;quipu&quot; still remain and where, as they were often stashed in ancient mausoleums. However, a recent survey of both museum and private collection inventories places the total number of known extant pre-Columbian &quot;quipus&quot; at a little under 1,400.

After the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, &quot;quipus&quot; were slowly replaced by European writing and numeral systems. Many &quot;quipus&quot; were identified as idolatrous and destroyed, but some Spaniards promoted the adaptation of the &quot;quipu&quot; recording system to the needs of the colonial administration, and some priests advocated the use of &quot;quipus&quot; for ecclesiastical purposes. Today, &quot;quipus&quot; continue to serve as important items in several modern Andean villages.

Various other cultures have used knotted strings, unrelated to South American &quot;quipu,&quot; to record information—these include, but are not limited to, Chinese knotting, and practiced by Tibetans, Japanese, and Polynesians.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Quipu&quot; is derived from a Quechua word meaning &#x27;knot&#x27; or &#x27;to knot&#x27;. The terms &quot;quipu&quot; and &quot;khipu&quot; are simply spelling variations on the same word. &quot;Quipu&quot; is the traditional spelling based on the Spanish orthography, while &quot;khipu&quot; reflects the recent Quechuan and Aymaran spelling shift. (pronounced , plural: ) comes from Cusco Quechua, while many other Quechua varieties use the term . Currently, the hispanicized spelling of &quot;quipu&quot; is the form most commonly used in both Spanish and English. 

== Purpose ==
The &quot;quipus&quot; held information, decipherable by officials called &quot;quipucamayocs&quot;, classified in various categories, narrated from the most important to the least important category, according to color, number, and order.

Most information recorded on the &quot;quipus&quot; studied to date by researchers consists of numbers in a decimal system, such as &quot;Indian chiefs ascertain[ing] which province had lost more than another and balanc[ing] the losses between them&quot; after the Spanish invasion. In the early years of the Spanish conquest of Peru, Spanish officials often relied on the &quot;quipus&quot; to settle disputes over local tribute payments or goods production. &quot;Quipucamayocs&quot; (Quechua &quot;khipu kamayuq&quot; &quot;khipu specialist&quot;, plural: &quot;khipu kamayuqkuna&quot;) could be summoned to court, where their bookkeeping was recognised as valid documentation of past payments.

In 2011, Gary Urton identified a potential match between six colonial-era &quot;quipus&quot; and a Spanish colonial census document. His student, Manny Medrano, expanded on this connection, proposing that the manner by which cords were attached to the main body of a &quot;quipu&quot; could encode moiety affiliation. Recent research has advanced this decipherment even further, revealing more detailed Andean social structures encoded in the six &quot;quipus&quot;.

Some knots — as well as other features, such as color, fiber type, cord attachments, etc. — are thought to represent non-numeric information, which has not been deciphered. It is generally thought that the system did not include phonetic symbols analogous to letters of the alphabet. However, Gary Urton has suggested that the &quot;quipus&quot; used a binary system which could record phonological or logographic data. According to Martti Pärssinen, &quot;quipucamayocs&quot; would learn specific oral texts, which in relation to the basic information contained in &quot;quipu&quot;, and pictorial representations, often painted on quiru vessels, similar to aztec pictograms, related simple &quot;episodes&quot;.

The lack of a clear link between any indigenous Andean languages and the &quot;quipus&quot; has historically led to the supposition that &quot;quipus&quot; are not a glottographic writing system and have no phonetic referent. Frank Salomon, at the University of Wisconsin, has argued that &quot;quipus&quot; are actually a semasiographic language, a system of representative symbolssuch as music notation or numeralsthat relay information but are not directly related to the speech sounds of a particular language, like ideograms and proto-writing.

Most recently, Sabine Hyland claims to have made the first phonetic decipherment of a &quot;quipu,&quot; challenging the assumption that &quot;quipus&quot; do not represent information phonetically. However, the &quot;quipu&quot; in question dates to the colonial period, suggesting its encoding could have been influenced by the introduction of European writing systems. After being contacted by local woman Meche Moreyra Orozco, the head of the Association of Collatinos in Lima, Hyland was granted access to the epistolary &quot;quipus&quot; of San Juan de Collata. These &quot;quipus&quot; were exchanged during an 18th-century rebellion against the Spanish government. A combination of color, fiber and ply direction leads to a total of 95 combinations in these &quot;quipus&quot;, which is within the range of a logosyllabic writing system. Exchanging information about the rebellion through &quot;quipus&quot; would have prevented the Spanish authorities from understanding the messages if they were intercepted, and the Collata &quot;quipus&quot; are non-numeric. With the help of local leaders, who described the &quot;quipu&quot; as &quot;a language of animals&quot;, Hyland was able to translate the names of the two &quot;ayllus&quot;, or family lineages, who received and sent the &quot;quipu&quot;. The translation relied on phonetic references to the animal fibers and colors of the relevant &quot;quipu&quot; cords.

=== Numeral system ===
While Spanish colonial chroniclers, such as Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, hinted at the numerical system of &quot;quipus&quot;, it is Leslie Leland Locke who is often credited with first demonstrating that many &quot;quipus&quot; encode numbers using a base-10 positional notation. Starting in the late 1960&#x27;s and building on Locke&#x27;s foundational work, Marcia Ascher and Robert Ascher analyzed several hundred &quot;quipus&quot;, revealing that most of the information recorded by &quot;quipu&quot; knots is numerical and can be systematically interpreted.
Most q&quot;uipus&quot; use three main types of knots: simple overhand knots; &quot;long knots&quot;, consisting of an overhand knot with one or more additional turns; and figure-eight knots. The Aschers’ also identified a fourth, and less common, type of knot—a figure-eight knot with an extra twist—which they refer to as an &quot;EE&quot; knot. On a given &quot;quipu&quot; cord, knots are grouped into clusters. Each cluster is tied at specific registers, or lengths, along the cord. These knot clusters represent digits in a base-10 number system. The units, or &quot;ones&quot; position is commonly tied at the bottom of a cord, followed by a space above it, then the &quot;tens&quot; position, then another space, then hundreds position, and so on. In other words:
* Powers of ten are denoted by position along the string, and this position is often aligned between successive strands.
* Digits in positions for 10 and higher powers are represented by clusters of simple knots (e.g., 40 is four simple knots in a row in the &quot;tens&quot; position).
* Digits 2–9 in the &quot;ones&quot; position are represented by long knots (e.g., 4 is a knot with four turns), and the digit 1 in the &quot;ones&quot; position is represented by a figure-eight knot.
* Zero is represented by the absence of a knot in the appropriate position.

For example, if 4s represents four simple knots, 3L represents a long knot with three turns, E represents a figure-eight knot, and X represents a space:
* The number 731 would be represented by 7s, 3s, E.
* The number 804 would be represented by 8s, X, 4L.
* The number 1493 would be represented by 1s, 4s, 9s, 3L.
Since the ones position on &quot;quipu&quot; cords are shown in a distinctive way (i.e., using long knots and figure-eight knots), it is usually clear where a number ends. Thus, it is possible that a single &quot;quipu&quot; cord could contain several numbers. For example:
* The number 107 followed by the number 51 would be represented by 1s, X, 7L, 5s, E.

The &quot;reading&quot; of &quot;quipu&quot; knots as numbers in the way outlined above is bolstered by the fortunate fact that &quot;quipus&quot; regularly contain sums in systematic ways. For instance, a cord may contain the sum of the next &quot;n&quot; cords, with this relationship being repeated throughout the &quot;quipu&quot;. In other cases, there are even cords which contain sums of sums. Such a relationship would be highly improbable if &quot;quipu&quot; knot values were being incorrectly interpreted.

Some data items are not numbers but what Ascher and Ascher call &quot;number labels&quot;. They are still composed of digits, but the resulting number seems to be used as a code, much as we use numbers to identify individuals, places, or things. For example, Carrie J. Brezine decoded that a particular three-number label at the beginning of some &quot;quipus&quot; may refer to Puruchuco, similar to a ZIP code.

=== Literary uses ===
Some have argued that far more than numeric information is present and that &quot;quipus&quot; are a writing system. This would be an especially important discovery as there is no surviving record of written Quechua predating the Spanish invasion. Possible reasons for this apparent absence of a written language include destruction by the Spanish of all written records, or the successful concealment by the Inca peoples of those records. Making the matter even more complex, the Inca &#x27;kept separate &quot;khipu&quot; for each province, on which a pendant string recorded the number of people belonging to each category.&#x27; This creates yet another step in the process of decryption in addition to the Spanish attempts at eradicating the system. Historians Edward Hyams and George Ordish believe quipus were recording devices, similar to musical notation, in that the notes on the page present basic information, and the performer would then bring those details to life.

In 2003, while checking the geometric signs that appear on drawings of Inca dresses from the &quot;First New Chronicle and Good Government&quot;, written by Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala in 1615, William Burns Glynn found a pattern that seems to decipher some words from &quot;quipus&quot; by matching knots to colors of strings.

The August 12, 2005, edition of the journal &quot;Science&quot; includes a report titled &quot;Khipu Accounting in Ancient Peru&quot; by anthropologist Gary Urton and mathematician Carrie J. Brezine. Their work may represent the first identification of a &quot;quipu&quot; element for a non-numeric concept, a sequence of three figure-eight knots at the start of a &quot;quipu&quot; that seems to be a unique signifier. It could be a toponym for the city of Puruchuco (near Lima), or the name of the &quot;quipu&quot; keeper who made it, or its subject matter, or even a time designator.

Beynon-Davies considers &quot;quipus&quot; as a sign system and develops an interpretation of their physical structure in terms of the concept of a data system.

&quot;Khipu kamayuqkuna&quot; (knot makers/keepers, i.e., the former Inca record keepers) supplied colonial administrators with a variety and quantity of information pertaining to censuses, tribute, ritual and calendrical organization, genealogies, and other such matters from Inca times. Performing a number of statistical tests for &quot;quipu&quot; sample VA 42527, one study led by Alberto Sáez-Rodríguez discovered that the distribution and patterning of S- and Z-knots can organize the information system from a real star map of the Pleiades cluster.

Laura Minelli, a professor of pre-Columbian studies at the University of Bologna, has discovered something which she believed to be a seventeenth-century Jesuit manuscript that describes literary &quot;quipus&quot;, titled . This manuscript consists of nine folios with Spanish, Latin, and ciphered Italian texts. Owned by the family of Neapolitan historian Clara Miccinelli, the manuscript also includes a wool &quot;quipu&quot; fragment. Miccinelli believes that the text was written by two Italian Jesuit missionaries, Joan Antonio Cumis and Giovanni Anello Oliva, around 1610–1638, and Blas Valera, a mestizo Jesuit sometime before 1618. Along with the details of reading literary &quot;quipus&quot;, the documents also discuss the events and people of the Spanish conquest of Peru. According to Cumis, since so many &quot;quipus&quot; were burned by the Spanish, very few remained for him to analyze. As related in the manuscript, the word Pacha Kamaq, the Inca deity of earth and time, was used many times in these &quot;quipus&quot;, where the syllables were represented by symbols formed in the knots. Following the analysis of the use of &quot;Pacha Kamaq&quot;, the manuscript offers a list of many words present in &quot;quipus&quot;. However, both Bruce Mannheim, the director of the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Michigan, and Colgate University&#x27;s Gary Urton, question its origin and authenticity. These documents seem to be inspired freely by a 1751 writing of Raimondo di Sangro, Prince of Sansevero.

== History ==

=== Possible proto-&quot;quipus&quot; ===
Claims of the earliest &quot;quipu,&quot; or possible proto-&quot;quipu,&quot; comes from the Late Preceramic (c. 3000–1800 BCE) site of Caral, though this claim has yet to be thoroughly evaluated. A more plausible candidate for the earliest known precursor to &quot;quipus&quot; may be the wrapped batons found at the site of Cerrillos from the Late Paracas Period (c. 350–200 BCE).

=== Wari Empire ===
The first undisputed evidence of &quot;quipu&quot; technology dates back to the Middle Horizon (c. 600–1000 CE), with these early &quot;quipus&quot; being used by the Wari Empire. Differing slightly from their Inca successors, extant Wari &quot;quipu&quot; specimens tend to be smaller, have brightly colored thread wrapped cords, and its own system of knots which scholars do not fully understand.

=== Inca Empire ===

&quot;Quipucamayocs&quot; (Quechua &quot;khipu kamayuq&quot;, &quot;khipu-authority&quot;), the accountants of Tawantin Suyu, created and deciphered the &quot;quipu&quot; knots. &quot;Quipucamayocs&quot; could carry out basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They kept track of mita, a form of taxation. The &quot;quipucamayocs&quot; also tracked the type of labor being performed, maintained a record of economic output, and ran a census that counted everyone from infants to &quot;old blind men over 80&quot;. The system was also used to keep track of the calendar. According to Guaman Poma, &quot;quipucamayocs&quot; could &quot;read&quot; the &quot;quipus&quot; with their eyes closed.

&quot;Quipucamayocs&quot; were from a class of people, &quot;males, fifty to sixty&quot;, and were not the only members of Inca society to use &quot;quipus&quot;. Inca historians used &quot;quipus&quot; when telling the Spanish about Tawantin Suyu history (whether they only recorded important numbers or actually contained the story itself is unknown). Members of the ruling class were usually taught to read &quot;quipus&quot; in the Inca equivalent of a university, the &quot;yachay wasi&quot; (literally, &quot;house of teaching&quot;), in the third year of schooling, for the higher classes who would eventually become the bureaucracy.

=== Spanish Empire ===
In 1532, the Spanish Empire&#x27;s conquest of the Andean region began, with several Spanish conquerors making note of the existence of &quot;quipus&quot; in their written records about the invasion. The earliest known example comes from Hernando Pizarro, the brother of the Spanish military leader Francisco Pizarro, who recorded an encounter that he and his men had in 1533 as they traveled along the royal road from the highlands to the central coast. It was during this journey that they encountered several &quot;quipu&quot; keepers, later relating that these keepers &quot;untied some of the knots which they had in the deposits section [of the khipu], and they [re-]tied them in another section [of the khipu].&quot;

Christian officials of the Third Council of Lima banned and ordered the burning of some q&quot;uipus&quot; in 1583 because they were used to record offerings to non-Christian gods and were therefore considered idolatrous objects and an obstacle to religious conversion.

=== Contemporary social importance ===
The &quot;quipu&quot; system operated as both a method of calculation and social organization, regulating regional governance and land use. While evidence for the latter is still under the critical eye of scholars around the world, the very fact that they are kept to this day without any confirmed level of fluent literacy in the system is testament to its historical &#x27;moral authority.&#x27; Today, &quot;khipu&quot; is regarded as a powerful symbol of heritage, only &#x27;unfurled&#x27; and handled by &#x27;pairs of [contemporary] dignitaries,&#x27; as the system and its &#x27;construction embed&#x27; modern &#x27;cultural knowledge.&#x27; Ceremonies in which they are &#x27;curated, even though they can no longer be read,&#x27; is even further support for the case of societal honor and significance associated with the &quot;quipu&quot;. Even today, &#x27;the knotted cords must be present and displayed when village officers leave or begin service, and draping the cords over the incoming office holders instantiates the moral and political authority of the past.&#x27; These examples are indicative of how the &quot;quipu&quot; system was not only fundamental mathematically and linguistically for the original Inca, but also for cultural preservation of the original empire&#x27;s descendants.

Anthropologists and archaeologists carrying out research in Peru have highlighted two known cases where &quot;quipus&quot; have continued to be used by contemporary communities, albeit as ritual items seen as &quot;communal patrimony&quot; rather than as devices for recording information. The &quot;quipu&quot; system, being the useful method of social management it was for the Inca, is also a link to the Cuzco census, as it was one of the primary methods of population calculation. This also has allowed historians and anthropologists to understand both the census and the &quot;decimal hierarchy&quot; system the Inca used, and that they were actually &#x27;initiated together,&#x27; due to the fact that they were &#x27;conceptually so closely linked.&#x27;

==== Tupicocha, Peru ====
In 1994, the American cultural anthropologist Frank Salomon conducted a study in the Peruvian village of Tupicocha, where &quot;quipus&quot; are still an important part of the social life of the village. As of 1994, this was the only known village where &quot;quipus&quot; with a structure similar to pre-Columbian &quot;quipus&quot; were still used for official local government record-keeping and functions, although the villagers did not associate their &quot;quipus&quot; with Inca artifacts.

==== San Cristóbal de Rapaz, Peru ====
The villagers of San Cristóbal de Rapaz (known as Rapacinos), located in the Province of Oyón, keep a &quot;quipu&quot; in an old ceremonial building, the &quot;Kaha Wayi&quot;, that is itself surrounded by a walled architectural complex. Also within the complex is a disused communal storehouse, known as the &quot;Pasa Qullqa&quot;, which was formerly used to protect and redistribute the local crops, and some Rapacinos believe that the &quot;quipu&quot; was once a record of this process of collecting and redistributing food. The entire complex was important to the villagers, being &quot;the seat of traditional control over land use, and the centre of communication with the deified mountains who control weather&quot;.

In 2004, the archaeologist Renata Peeters (of the UCL Institute of Archaeology in London) and the cultural anthropologist Frank Salomon (of the University of Wisconsin) undertook a project to conserve both the &quot;quipus&quot; in Rapaz and the building that it was in, due to their increasingly poor condition.

==== Jucul, Peru ====
The remote village of Jucul, Peru, has kept &quot;quipus&quot; in the attic of its colonial church for centuries, only recently being discovered by outsiders in 2024. These &quot;quipus&quot; are closely related to those of San Cristóbal de Rapaz, which is near by. 

== Archaeological investigation ==
In 1912, Leslie Leland Locke published &quot;The Ancient Quipu, A Peruvian Knot Record,&quot; &quot;American Anthropologist,&quot; New Series I4 (1912) 325–332. This was the first work to show how the Inca (Inka) Empire and its predecessor societies used the &quot;quipu&quot; for mathematical and accounting records in the decimal system.

The archaeologist Gary Urton noted in his 2003 book &quot;Signs of the Inka Khipu&quot; that he estimated &quot;from my own studies and from the published works of other scholars that there are about 600 extant &quot;quipu&quot; in public and private collections around the world.&quot;

According to the Khipu Database Project undertaken by Harvard University professor Gary Urton and his colleague Carrie Brezine, 751 &quot;quipus&quot; have been reported to exist across the globe. Their whereabouts range from Europe to North and South America. Most are housed in museums outside of their native countries, but some reside in their native locations under the care of the descendants of those who made the knot records. A table of the largest collections is shown below.

While patrimonial &quot;quipu&quot; collections have not been accounted for in this database, their numbers are likely to be unknown. One prominent patrimonial collection held by the Rapazians of Rapaz, Peru, was recently researched by University of Wisconsin–Madison professor, Frank Salomon.

=== Preservation ===
&quot;Quipus&quot; are made of fibers, either spun and plied thread such as wool or hair from alpaca, llama, guanaco or vicuña, though are also commonly made of cellulose like cotton. Archaeological evidence has also shown that, in some cases, finely carved wood was used as a supplemental base to which the color-coded cords could be attached. The knotted strings of &quot;quipus&quot; were often made with an &quot;elaborate system of knotted cords, dyed in various colors, the significance of which was known to the magistrates&quot;. Fading of color, natural or dyed, cannot be reversed, and may indicate further damage to the fibers. Colors can darken if damaged by dust or by certain dyes and mordants. &quot;Quipus&quot; have been found with adornments, such dried potatoes and beans, attached to the cords, and these non-textile materials may require additional preservation measures.

&quot;Quipus&quot; are now preserved using techniques that aim to minimize their future degradation. Museums, archives and special collections have adopted preservation guidelines from textile practices.

Environmental controls are used to monitor and control temperature, humidity and light exposure of storage areas. As with all textiles, cool, clean, dry and dark environments are most suitable. The heating, ventilating and air conditioning, or HVAC systems, of buildings that house &quot;quipu&quot; knot records are usually automatically regulated. Relative humidity should be 60% or lower, with low temperatures, as high temperatures can damage the fibres and make them brittle. Damp conditions and high humidity can damage protein-rich material. Textiles suffer damage from ultraviolet (UV) light, which can include fading and weakening of the fibrous material. When &quot;quipus&quot; are on display, their exposure to ambient conditions is usually minimized and closely monitored.

Despite best efforts, damage can occur during storage, or be from the result of earlier conservation efforts. The more accessible the items are during storage, the greater the chance of early detection. Storing &quot;quipus&quot; horizontally on boards covered with a neutral pH paper (paper that is neither acid or alkaline) to prevent potential acid transfer is a preservation technique that extends the life of a collection. The fibers can be abraded by rubbing against each other or, for those attached to sticks or rods, by their own weight if held in an upright position. Extensive handling of &quot;quipus&quot; can also increase the risk of further damage.

&quot;Quipus&quot; are also closely monitored for mold, as well as insects and their larvae. As with all textiles, these are major problems. Fumigation may not be recommended for fiber textiles displaying mold or insect infestations, although it is common practice for ridding paper of mold and insects.

Conservators in the field of library science have the skills to handle a variety of situations. Even though some &quot;quipus&quot; have hundreds of cords, each cord should be assessed and treated individually. &quot;Quipu&quot; cords can be &quot;mechanically cleaned with brushes, small tools and light vacuuming&quot;. Just as the application of fungicides is not recommended to rid &quot;quipus&quot; of mold, neither is the use of solvents to clean them.

Even when people have tried to preserve &quot;quipus&quot;, corrective care may still be required. If &quot;quipus&quot; are to be conserved close to their place of origin, local camelid or wool fibres in natural colors can be obtained and used to mend breaks and splits in the cords. Rosa Choque Gonzales and Rosalia Choque Gonzales, conservators from southern Peru, worked to conserve the Rapaz patrimonial &quot;quipus&quot; in the Andean village of Rapaz, Peru. These &quot;quipus&quot; had undergone repair in the past, so this conservator team used new local camelid and wool fibers to spin around the area under repair in a similar fashion to the earlier repairs found on the &quot;quipu&quot;.

When Gary Urton, professor of Anthropology at Harvard, was asked &quot;Are they [&quot;quipus&quot;] fragile?&quot;, he answered, &quot;some of them are, and you can&#x27;t touch them – they would break or turn into dust. Many are quite well preserved, and you can actually study them without doing them any harm. Of course, any time you touch an ancient fabric like that, you&#x27;re doing some damage, but these strings are generally quite durable.&quot;

Ruth Shady, a Peruvian archeologist, has discovered a &quot;quipu&quot; or perhaps &quot;proto-quipu&quot; believed to be around 5,000 years old in the coastal city of Caral. It was in quite good condition, with &quot;brown cotton strings wound around thin sticks&quot;, along with &quot;a series of offerings, including mysterious fiber balls of different sizes wrapped in &#x27;nets&#x27; and pristine reed baskets. Piles of raw cotton – uncombed and containing seeds, though turned a dirty brown by the ages – and a ball of cotton thread&quot; were also found preserved. The good condition of these articles can be attributed to the arid climate of Caral.

<text>Thomas Frognall Dibdin (177618 November 1847) was an English bibliographer, born in Calcutta to Thomas Dibdin, the sailor brother of the composer Charles Dibdin.

Dibdin was orphaned at a young age. His father and mother died in 1780 while returning to England, and an elderly maternal aunt eventually assumed responsibility for Dibdin. He was educated at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, and studied for a time at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. After an unsuccessful attempt to obtain practice as a provincial counsel at Worcester, he was ordained a clergyman at the close of 1804, being appointed to a curacy at Kensington. It was not until 1823 that he received the living of Exning in Sussex. Soon afterwards he was appointed by Lord Liverpool to the rectory of St Mary&#x27;s, Bryanston Square, which he held until his death.

The first of his numerous bibliographical works was his &quot;Introduction to the Knowledge of Editions of the Classics&quot; (1802), which brought him under the notice of the second Earl Spencer, to whom he owed much important aid in his bibliographical pursuits. The rich library at Althorp was thrown open to him; he spent much of his time in it, and in 1814–1815 published his &quot;Bibliotheca Spenceriana&quot;. As the library was not open to the general public, the information given in the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; was found very useful, but since its author was unable even to read the characters in which the books he described were written, the work was marred by the errors which more or less characterize all his productions. This fault of inaccuracy however was less obtrusive in his series of playful, discursive works in the form of dialogues on his favourite subject, the first of which, &quot;Bibliomania&quot; (1809), was republished with large additions in 1811, and was very popular, passing through numerous editions.

To the same class belonged the &quot;Bibliographical Decameron&quot;, a larger work, which appeared in 1817. In 1810 he began the publication of a new and much extended edition of Ames&#x27;s &quot;Typographical Antiquities&quot;. The first volume was a great success, but the publication was checked by the failure of the fourth volume, and was never completed. In 1818 Dibdin was commissioned by Earl Spencer to purchase books for him on the continent, an expedition described in his sumptuous &quot;Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in France and Germany&quot; (1821). In 1822 Dibdin sold &#x27;the entire collection of original drawings, executed by Lewis, and eminent artists, for the Bibliographical, Antiquarian, and Picturesque Tour, of the Rev. Mr. Dibdin&#x27; through London auctioneer R. H. Evans (sale 11–14 February 1822). A copy of the catalogue is in Cambridge University Library at the shelfmark Munby.c.124(9), annotated with prices; the total was £568 1s 6d.

In 1824 he made an ambitious venture in his &quot;Library Companion, or the Young Man&#x27;s Guide and Old Man&#x27;s Comfort in the Choice of a Library&quot;, intended to point out the best works in all departments of literature. His culture was not broad enough, however, to render him competent for the task, and the work was severely criticized. For some years Dibdin gave himself up chiefly to religious literature. He returned to bibliography in his &quot;Bibliophobia, or Remarks on the Present Depression in the State of Literature and the Book Trade&quot; (1832), and the same subject furnishes the main interest of his &quot;Reminiscences of a Literary Life&quot; (1836), and his &quot;Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in the Northern Counties of England and Scotland&quot; (1838).

Dibdin was the originator and vice-president—Earl Spencer being the president—of the Roxburghe Club, founded in 1812, the first &quot;book club&quot;.

<text>Joseph Ames (23 January 1689 – 7 October 1759) was an English bibliographer and antiquary. He purportedly wrote an account of printing in England from 1471 to 1600 entitled &quot;Typographical Antiquities&quot; (1749). It is uncertain whether he was by occupation a ship&#x27;s chandler, a pattern-maker, a plane iron maker or an ironmonger. Though never educated beyond grammar school, he prospered in trade and amassed valuable collections of rare books and antiquities.

==Life==
He was the eldest child of John Ames, a master in the merchant service and sixth son of Captain Joseph Ames, R.N. Joseph Ames was born at Yarmouth on 23 January 1689 and was educated at a small grammar school in Wapping. He lost his father at age 12 and three years later was apprenticed to a plane maker in King Street or Queen Street, near the Guildhall, City of London. He then moved to Wapping near the Hermitage, where his father had previously settled, and established a successful business there. In 1712 his mother died and was buried in Wapping church near her husband. Two years later Ames married Mary, daughter of William Wrayford, a merchant in Bow Lane. She died in 1734 after bearing six children, of whom only a daughter survived her.

Ames was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1736 and was appointed secretary five years later; he held the position until his death, the Rev. William Norris being associated with him in 1754. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1743, but his only contribution to the Society&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; was a letter relating to a case of &quot;plica polonica&quot; in 1747.

After dining with his old friend Sir Peter Thompson, Ames was seized with an attack that brought about his death that evening, 7 October 1759, in the seventy-first year of his life. He was buried in the churchyard of St George-in-the-East.

==Reputation==
Ames made no pretence to literary merit, and his position in the Society of Antiquaries generated a degree of antagonism. Edward Rowe Mores described him as &#x27;an arrant blunderer&#x27; and accused him, with justification, of tearing out the title-pages of rare books in his collection. Among the works he is thought to have thus mutilated is the British Library copy of William Tyndale&#x27;s 1526 New Testament, one of only two textually complete copies known. Francis Grose said that the history of printing published under his name actually was written by John Ward of Gresham College, though the materials probably were collected by Ames. William Cole thought he wrote like an illiterate and said he was an Independent by profession, but a deist in conversation. William Oldys (&quot;British Librarian&quot;, p. 374) acknowledges obligations to Ames, whom he styles &#x27;a worthy preserver of antiquities.&#x27;

==Collector==
Ames assembled a large collection of portraits, especially those of printers, although many were of doubtful authenticity. He also collected coins, &#x27;natural curiosities,’ inscriptions, antiquities and rare English books and manuscripts. Many of the books were annotated by former owners, and the manuscripts included a number of valuable historical transcripts. The collection was sold in 1760 after his death by Abraham Langford.

Among the collection was an interleaved copy of the &quot;Typographical Antiquities&quot; in two volumes, with manuscript additions. The lot, which included plates, blocks, and copyright, was purchased by Sir Peter Thompson and afterwards was sold by him to William Herbert, who made use of it for his own edition of the book (1785–1790). Another edition was by Thomas Frognall Dibdin (4 vols., 1810–1819).

==Works==
His works are: 
* &#x27;A Catalogue of English Printers, from the year 1471 to 1600, most of them at London, (without date or place), 4 pp.; the copy in the Society of Antiquaries Library is inscribed, &#x27;Presented by Mr. Ames, 20 March 1739–40.&#x27;
* &#x27;An Index to the Pembrokian Coins and Medals&#x27; (without date or place, ?1746), 8 pp., with device. The volume of engravings of the cabinet of coins belonging to the Earl of Pembroke, &quot;Numismata Antiqua&quot;, was brought out in 1746 without any text. Ames printed for private distribution an index of four leaves, a transcript of the names of the coins as shown upon the plates.
* &#x27;A Catalogue of English Heads, or an account of about two thousand prints describing what is particular on each; as the name, title, or office of the person, the habit, posture, age or time when done, the name of the painter, graver, scraper, &amp;c., and some remarkable particulars relating to their lives,’ London, 1748.
* &#x27;Typographical Antiquities, being an historical account of printing in England, with some memoirs of our antient printers, and a register of the books printed by them, from the year 1471 to 1600, with an appendix concerning printing in Scotland and Ireland to the same time,’ London, 1749.
* &#x27;Parentalia, or Memoirs of the Family of the Wrens, viz. of Matthew, bishop of Ely, Christopher, dean of Windsor, &amp;c., but chiefly of Sir Christopher Wren, late surveyor-general of the royal buildings, P.R.S. &amp;c., in which is contained, besides his works, a great number of original papers and records on religion, politics, anatomy, mathematics, architecture, antiquities, and most branches of polite literature, compiled by his son Christopher; now published by his grandson, Stephen Wren, Esq., with the care of Joseph Ames,’ London, 1750.
Ames owed his studious tastes to the Rev. John Russel of St John&#x27;s, Wapping and the Rev. John Lewis. He also made the acquaintance, while attending lectures by John Theophilus Desaguliers, of Peter Thompson, a Hamburg merchant and Member of Parliament for St Albans. Lewis had made collections for a history of printing in England, and suggested to Ames that he should undertake the work. Notes sent to Ames include lists of printers and facsimiles of their marks, copies of title-pages, extracts, &amp;c.

Samuel Palmer published a similar work; it appeared in 1732, but not to acclaim. In 1739–40 Ames circulated a preliminary list of English printers from 1471 to 1600, which included 215 names, most of them being those of London men, with the announcement: &#x27;As the history and progress of printing in England, from 1474 to 1600, is in good forwardness for the press; if any gentleman please to send the publisher, Jos. Ames in Wappin, some account of these printers, or add others to them, or oblige him with what may be useful in this undertaking, the favour will be gratefully acknowledged.&#x27;

In 1748[7] he printed a &#x27;Catalogue of English Heads,’ being an index to the collection of 2,000 prints, bound in ten volumes, belonging to John Nickolls, F.R.S., the Quaker antiquary of Ware, Hertfordshire. It formed the first attempt at a general description of English engraved portraits, a work resumed by James Granger twenty years later.

In 1749, the &quot;Typographical Antiquities&quot; appeared, a quarto of over 600 pages, dedicated to Lord Chancellor Hardwicke. The original proposals contemplated only 200 copies, but 301 were subscribed for, and the list shows that the book was supported by leading antiquaries and printers. Ames owed much to the investigations of others. A portion of his extensive bibliographical correspondence with Andrew Ducarel, John Anstis, Lewis, Bishop Lyttleton, Rawlinson and others is given by John Nichols. The libraries of Lord Orford, Sir Hans Sloane, Anstis, and other friends, were used for his researches. Ames earned the gratitude of subsequent bibliographers by disregarding printed lists and consulting the title pages of the books themselves.

&quot;Parentalia&quot; (1750) was a memoir of the Wrens, undertaken in conjunction with Sir Christopher Wren&#x27;s grandson, Stephen Wren. Part of his correspondence in bibliography is included in Nichols&#x27;s &quot;Literary Anecdotes and Illustrations&quot;.

<text>Charles Dibdin (before 4 March 1745 – 25 July 1814) was an English composer, musician, dramatist, novelist, singer and actor. With over 600 songs to his name, for many of which he wrote both the lyrics and the music and performed them himself, he was in his time the most prolific English singer-songwriter. He is best known as the composer of &quot;Tom Bowling&quot;, one of his many sea songs, which often features at the Last Night of the Proms. He also wrote about 30 dramatic pieces, including the operas &quot;The Waterman&quot; (1774) and &quot;The Quaker&quot; (1775), and several novels, memoirs and histories. His works were admired by Haydn and Beethoven.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life and early successes ===
The son of a silversmith, Dibdin was privately baptised on 4 March 1745 in Southampton and is often described as the youngest child of eighteen born to a 50-year-old mother. His parents, intending him for the clergy, sent Dibdin to Winchester College, but his love of music soon diverted his thoughts from the clerical profession. He possessed &#x27;a remarkable good voice&#x27; at a young age and was in demand for concerts even as a boy. Anthems were composed for him by James Kent and his successor Peter Fussell, organists of Winchester Cathedral, where he was a chorister between 1756 and 1759. He went to London at the age of fifteen at his brother&#x27;s invitation, and was first employed tuning harpsichords in a music warehouse in Cheapside. Through Mr. Berenger he was introduced to John Rich (of whom he became a favourite) and John Beard, and, growing addicted to theatre-going, he soon became a singing actor at Theatre Royal, Covent Garden. As his voice was not yet settled, Rich thought he would become a bass, and marked out the pantomime roles of Richard Leveridge for him. Dibdin held back from this path, but made the most of his introductions: when Rich died in 1761 and Beard succeeded him as manager and part-proprietor, fresh opportunities arose.

With Beard&#x27;s encouragement Dibdin wrote his first work, both words and music of &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Artifice&quot;, an operetta in two acts, which was produced as Dibdin&#x27;s benefit at Covent Garden on 21 May 1762 and repeated in 1763. As an actor, Dibdin had constant opportunities to study Garrick&#x27;s performances, and befriended his associates, notably his prompter, who could remember Cibber. He enjoyed two seasons touring at the Vauxhall in Birmingham, and another at Richmond. Beard exercised a benign and encouraging influence over Dibdin&#x27;s early career, choosing him, in his first important appearance, for the part of Ralph, in the 1765 premiere of Samuel Arnold&#x27;s opera &quot;The Maid of the Mill&quot; at Covent Garden. He gained so much success over a run of more than fifty nights, that &#x27;Ralph&#x27; handkerchiefs were worn in compliment to him. He agreed to article himself, both as actor and musician, to Beard for three years at a salary rising from three to five pounds a week. However, his contract established a precedent by which actors were not paid in case of absence through sickness.

The script for &quot;The Maid of the Mill&quot; was by playwright Isaac Bickerstaffe, who had written the libretto for &quot;Love in a Village&quot;, the highly popular opera (called the first English comic opera) by Dr. Thomas Arne, produced in 1762. For Dibdin the next turning-point was in the 1767 premiere and short run of Bickerstaffe&#x27;s &quot;Love in the City&quot;, in which he played Watty Cockney, and for which he produced a good deal of the music and airs. He had already confided to Beard that he disliked acting because of the jealousy and spite which his success brought upon him from other actors. Hence he had turned again to composition. But now some of the orchestra complained to Beard that his music was discreditable to the theatre: whereupon Dibdin obtained the direct intervention of Dr. Arne, who (according to Dibdin) pronounced that this was a scandalous attempt to ruin the reputation of a young man whom it was their duty to encourage and protect. &quot;Love in the City&quot; was abandoned, but Dibdin&#x27;s music was successful and was transferred into a play called &quot;The Romp&quot;. The association with Bickerstaffe continued in Dibdin&#x27;s music for the play &quot;Lionel and Clarissa&quot; at Covent Garden in 1767, the year of Beard&#x27;s retirement.

=== Drury Lane with Garrick ===
By 1768, his articles completed, and receiving harsh treatment from his new manager George Colman, Dibdin was ready to part company with Covent Garden. Garrick, who had coached him a little at Richmond in the previous year, was eager to win over Bickerstaffe to Drury Lane: and as hopes for his new play &quot;The Padlock&quot; projected for the Haymarket Theatre faded, Garrick acquired it, and acquired Dibdin as composer, whose music for this work was, at Garrick&#x27;s suggestion, given anonymously. Dibdin made only £40 from it while Bickerstaffe made a fortune. &quot;The Padlock&quot; was produced at Drury Lane under Garrick&#x27;s management in 1768, Dibdin taking the part of Mungo (a blackface role) so as to cause &quot;that degree of sensation in the public which is called a &quot;rage&quot;.&quot;

In 1769 for Garrick (who had placed him under some financial obligation) he also composed for Garrick&#x27;s Shakespeare Jubilee at Stratford, but found that Garrick had quietly substituted commissions to Arne and to Boyce. Garrick, it seemed, wished to control both Bickerstaffe and Dibdin, in case their work should find other patrons, and busied them both, inducing Dibdin to revise and write new music for Cibber&#x27;s &quot;Damon and Phillida&quot;. In addition he provided the score for Bickerstaffe&#x27;s burletta &quot;The Recruiting Serjeant&quot;, and for his &quot;The Maid the Mistress&quot;, and &quot;The Ephesian Matron&quot; in that year, which were all produced in 1769 at Ranelagh Gardens under a two-year contract with the Ranelagh managers for £100 per annum for whatever music he should supply them with.

Dibdin set a text by Garrick for &quot;The Installation of the Garter&quot; in 1771. In February 1773 the comic opera &quot;The Wedding Ring&quot; based on an Italian opera &quot;Il filosofo di campagna&quot; was brought out, but was almost withdrawn on the first night owing to the rumour that it was written by Bickerstaffe, who had fled to France, utterly ruined by the accusation of an &#x27;abominable (i.e. homosexual) attempt&#x27;. Dibdin was obliged to appear on stage and claim authorship of both words and music, while salacious tittle-tattle (and worse) sought to embroil both him and Garrick in Bickerstaffe&#x27;s offence. In November 1773, in a production of the musical drama &quot;The Deserter&quot; which he had adapted from the French opera of 1769 by Michel-Jean Sedaine and Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny, he introduced the song &#x27;There was a miller&#x27;s daughter&#x27; and modified other songs without Garrick&#x27;s knowledge or consent, but with great success. During the same year he worked closely with Garrick at Hampton to compose songs and music for Garrick&#x27;s winter piece, &quot;The Christmas Tale&quot;. From this ordeal he acquired the technique of composing the music entire in his mind, writing down nothing until the finished manuscript was needed: to this method he afterwards adhered.

Meanwhile, from 1772 he was also engaged by Thomas King to write regularly for Sadler&#x27;s Wells, and in that year produced songs for the Musical Dialogues &quot;The Palace of Mirth&quot; and Bickerstaffe&#x27;s &quot;The Brickdustman&quot;. He followed that in 1773 with the interlude &quot;The Mischance&quot;, and the dialogues &quot;The Grenadier&quot; (text by Garrick), &quot;The Ladle&quot;, &quot;England against Italy&quot;, and &quot;None so blind as those who won&#x27;t see&quot;: and furthermore in the same year he wrote songs for &quot;The Trip to Portsmouth&quot; (words by G. A. Stevens), performed by Charles Bannister at the Haymarket, for which the overture and dances were written by Thomas Arne.

Dibdin&#x27;s most lasting opera, &quot;The Waterman&quot;, a comic opera, the music of which he sold for £30, was produced first at the Haymarket Theatre in 1774. His dialogues and songs for &quot;The Cobbler, or, A Wife of Ten Thousand&quot; (based on Sedaine&#x27;s &quot;Blaise le savetier&quot;), were acted as a ballad opera at Drury Lane in 1774, and his famous short opera &quot;The Quaker&quot; was produced there on 3 May 1775, which Dibdin had sold to Brereton for £70, who sold it on to Garrick for a hundred. Charles Bannister was again prominent in the cast of all three operas. After being connected with Drury Lane both as composer and as actor for several years, a series of disagreements with Garrick, partly over Dibdin&#x27;s desertion of his second partner Mrs Davenet and his children by her, led to the termination of his engagement.

===Sadler&#x27;s Wells, Haymarket and Covent Garden===
Despite the rift with Garrick, Dibdin&#x27;s output continued successfully. The dialogue &quot;The Imposter, or, All&#x27;s not gold that glitters&quot;, was written for Sadler&#x27;s Wells in 1776, and his comic opera &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; modelled on Molière&#x27;s &quot;Sicilian&quot;, but with songs and music his own, was performed at the Haymarket in the same year. His comic opera &quot;The Seraglio&quot;, incorporating the famous rondeau song &#x27;Blow High, Blow Low&#x27; (written during a gale returning from Calais) was first acted at Covent Garden in November 1776. The productive season of 1777 included songs for &quot;The vineyard revels&quot; (a pantomime), &quot;She is mad for a husband&quot;, &quot;Yo, Yea, or, The friendly tars&quot;, &quot;The old woman of eighty&quot; and &quot;The razor grinder&quot;, all at Sadler&#x27;s Wells. In 1778 the important burletta &quot;Poor Vulcan&quot; was produced at Covent Garden, but in Dibdin&#x27;s absence in France many of the songs were altered by another hand. There also he wrote the libretto of &quot;The Gipsies&quot;, for which Thomas Arne wrote the music, first performed at the Haymarket in 1778.

On his return from France in 1778 Thomas Harris, the Theatre Manager, appointed him Musical Director at Covent Garden (to write exclusively for him) at the then huge salary of £10 () a week. Attempting to introduce a taste for the French variety theatre, he had adapted six short interludes, with his own music, with a view that one should be introduced between the play and the farce usually presented on the same evening. They included &quot;Rose and Colin&quot;, &quot;Wives revenged&quot; and &quot;Annette and Lubin&quot;; but Harris instead lumped them together as an after-piece and Dibdin&#x27;s subtler intention was thwarted. In the following January his speaking pantomime &quot;The Touchstone&quot; (with songs) was produced, but Mr Pilon, Mr Cumberland, Mrs Cowley and Mr Lee Lewis were permitted to alter it so much that it became almost unrecognisable. However, Dibdin did accept two clever emendations suggested by Garrick, which resulted in a reconciliation between the two men: it is claimed that Garrick&#x27;s very last step upon the stage was during a rehearsal for &quot;The Touchstone&quot; a night or two before the opening.

Covent Garden productions continued with &quot;The Chelsea pensioners&quot;, and &quot;The Mirror, or, Harlequin everywhere&quot; (a pantomime) (both 1779), and in 1780 the comic opera &quot;The Shepherdess of the Alps&quot;, and the three-act opera &quot;The Islanders&quot;, most of which was re-presented as a two-act farce called &quot;The Marriage Act&quot; in 1781. After the British victory at the Siege of Savannah, he added a scene in &quot;The Mirror&quot; depicting British grenadiers (one of whom was played by Frederick Charles Reinhold) defeating the Comte d&#x27;Estaing, leader of the French forces during the battle, and then singing &quot;The British Grenadiers.&quot; He also arranged, wrote and composed the 1780 Christmas pantomime, &quot;Harlequin freemason&quot;, for which Messink (Garrick&#x27;s pantomime specialist) contributed the inventions. In 1781 Dibdin adapted John Dryden&#x27;s play &quot;Amphytrion, or Juno and Alcmena&quot; into an opera. He attempted to rewrite it so as to avoid some of the impropriety of the original, and was at first encouraged by Harris, who later changed his mind. Dibdin was left with a difficult task and the result was not a popular success.

===The Royal Circus and other ventures===
There was then an argument between Dibdin and Harris over payment for the work, with the result that Dibdin instead embarked on a project to construct the Royal Circus, (afterwards known as the Surrey Theatre) for mixed entertainments of various kinds, he planning to form a combination of the stage and an equestrian ring or hippodrome. Several parties including the landowner advanced the funds and became proprietors, and Dibdin was appointed sole manager for life, to receive a quarter of the profits. Dibdin is credited with coining the term &quot;circus&quot;.

Meanwhile, a dialogue, &quot;The Fortune Hunter&quot;, had appeared at Sadler&#x27;s Wells in 1780, and at the Haymarket. Dibdin had contributed songs to an entertainment called &quot;Pasquin&#x27;s Budget&quot; in which characters were represented by puppets, and their songs were performed by singers behind the scenes. It is said that in &quot;The Comic Mirror&quot; Dibdin had ridiculed prominent contemporary figures through the medium of a puppet show. Such things had been tried elsewhere, for instance at the Marylebone Gardens: but on the first night at the Haymarket &#x27;the puppets were goosed off, and the manager made to apologise for the insult offered to the audience.&#x27; Nonetheless some of the songs, including Dibdin&#x27;s &#x27;Reasonable animals&#x27; and &#x27;Pandora&#x27;, became very popular, and &quot;Pandora&quot; was later acted at the Circus.
Between 1782 and 1783 he engaged some sixty children to act as dancers and singers for his various lively productions at the Circus, for which he supplied many airs, pantomimes, intermezzi and ballets, under such titles as &quot;Clump and Cudden&quot;, &quot;The benevolent tar&quot;, &quot;The saloon&quot;, &quot;The talisman&quot;, &quot;The graces&quot;, &quot;Long odds&quot;, &quot;Tom Thumb&quot;, &quot;The Passions&quot;, &quot;The Lancashire witches&quot;, &quot;The Barrier of Parnassus&quot;, &quot;The Milkmaid&quot;, &quot;The Refusal of Harlequin&quot;, &quot;The Land of Simplicity&quot;, &quot;The Statue&quot;, &quot;The regions of Accomplishment&quot;, and &quot;Cestus&quot; (a kind of mythological burlesque in which the Homeric gods discoursed in a low vernacular). His opera &quot;Liberty Hall&quot;, containing the successful songs &quot;Jock Ratlin&quot;, &quot;The Highmettled Racer&quot; and &quot;The Bells of Aberdovey&quot;, was produced at the Drury Lane theatre on 8 February 1784.

After three years at the circus, in which Dibdin fell out with his partners and became entangled in litigation; in 1785, he withdrew, and, instead, entered into a speculation to build a theatre at St. Pancras. However, while under construction this was blown down during a storm, and the project had to be abandoned. He then came to an arrangement to supply the manager of the Dublin theatre with music at a cost of £600, of which he received only £140; at the same time he began publishing a weekly magazine, called &quot;The Devil&quot;, which failed after 21 issues. His last opera of this period was &quot;Harvest Home&quot;, a two-act comic opera first performed at the Haymarket in 1787.

=== Monodramatic entertainments at King Street and Leicester Place ===

In 1788, having dissolved his connection with the existing theatres and in financial straits, Dibdin considered moving to India. His eldest brother, Captain Thomas Dibdin, had formerly invited him to visit, but had since died, prompting Dibdin to write his greatest song, &quot;Tom Bowling&quot;. He now hoped to be received by his brother&#x27;s old friends, and perhaps to collect certain debts owing to him. Therefore, he made a tour of England to raise money by giving entertainments of songs and recitations, and he sold the musical compositions he had available at very unfavourable rates to the greedy publishers. He set sail for the East Indies in summer 1788, but the vessel was forced to put in at Torbay because of bad weather.

Dibdin then changed his mind and returned to London, resolving to put himself before the public rather than applying again to the theatres. Instead, building on what he had done in his tour, he commenced a new kind of one-man-show, musical variety entertainments, in which he appeared in his own person on the stage seated at a harpsichord and played the accompaniments to his own songs, without attempting any theatrical personification of his characters. &quot;The Whim of the Moment&quot; was such an entertainment consisting of recitations and songs, and played from October 1788 until the following April, during the whole of which time Dibdin was a prisoner in the King&#x27;s Bench. This was first given at the Lyceum Theatre in The Strand, and afterwards at Fisher&#x27;s or Stevens&#x27; Auction Room in King Street, in Covent Garden. For several years he also repeated the entertainments in the daytime at the Paul&#x27;s Head Assembly Rooms in Cateaton Street.

His monodramatic entertainments continued after 1795 at a theatre which he built, the Sans Souci Theatre in Leicester Place. Dibdin introduced very many songs which gained wide popularity, including &quot;Poor Jack,&quot; &quot;&#x27;Twas in the good ship &#x27;Rover&#x27;,&quot; &quot;Saturday Night at Sea,&quot; and &quot;I sailed from the Downs in the &#x27;Nancy.&#x27;&quot; His songs, music and recitations here finally established his fame as a lyric poet. He continued this form of entertainment for nearly twenty years, usually between October and April, in which time he produced eighteen entirely original three-act or three-part productions, as well as several one-act pieces on contemporary themes, or in which to re-introduce some of his popular songs. At Christmas-time or during the spring he commonly cut short the main production to make room for a revival of some items brought out in previous years. Dibdin states that in all these entertainments, he had only the words before him, never having written down the music which was, however, fully composed in his mind.

The three-act novelties of each season, or Entertainments Sans-Souci, and their sequels, were as follows:
* &quot;The Whim of the Moment, or, Nature in Little&quot; – Auction rooms, King Street, Covent Garden.
* &quot;The Oddities&quot; (1789) – Lyceum.
* &quot;The Wags, or, The Camp of Pleasure&quot; (1790) – Lyceum.
* &quot;Private Theatricals, or Nature in Nubibus&quot; (1791) – Royal Polygraphic Rooms, The Strand; followed by &quot;The Coalition&quot;, a compilation from the preceding. 
* &quot;The Quizzes, or, A Trip to Elysium&quot; (1792); followed by a compilation from all the preceding.
* &quot;Castles in the Air&quot; (1793)
* &quot;Great News, or, A Trip to the Antipodes&quot; (1794) – followed by an &quot;Ode&quot; in honour of the royal marriage.
* &quot;The Will o&#x27; the Wisp&quot; (1795) – followed by &quot;Christmas Gambols&quot;
* &quot;The General Election&quot; (1796) – the first production at Dibdin&#x27;s new Theatre Sans Souci; followed by &quot;Datchet mead&quot;, in honour of the marriage of the Princess Royal.
* &quot;The Sphinx&quot; (1797); followed by a Christmas piece &quot;The Goose and the Gridiron&quot;.
* &quot;The Tour to the Land&#x27;s End&quot; (1798); followed by &quot;King and Queen&quot; (one act).
* &quot;Tom Wilkins&quot; (1799).
* &quot;The Cake-house&quot; (1800).
* &quot;A Frisk&quot; (1801).
* &quot;Most Votes&quot; (1802).
* &quot;Britons, Strike Home&quot; (1803). This included a series of war-songs with military-band accompaniments.
* In 1804 there was a one-act novelty &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;, and three compilations of older pieces, namely &quot;The Election&quot; (from &quot;Most Votes&quot;); &quot;The Frolic&quot; (from &quot;Britons, Strike Home&quot;); and, &quot;A trip to the Coast&quot;.
* &quot;Heads and Tails&quot; (1805); followed by &quot;Cecilia, or the Progress of Industry.&quot;
* &quot;Professional Volunteers&quot; (1808). (Given at the Lyceum during Lent, supported by professional assistants, though still, after 48 years before the public, playing his own accompaniments).
* &quot;The Rent-day, or, The Yeoman&#x27;s Friend&quot; (1808) – Sans-Pareil Theatre (later the Adelphi Theatre) in the Strand.
* &quot;Commodore Pennant&quot; (1809) – the last of these entertainments, a slight piece, was given in a room in the author&#x27;s shop in the Strand.

John Adolphus, writing of Dibdin&#x27;s involvement in the entertainment &quot;Bannister&#x27;s Budget&quot;, wrote: &quot;Charles Dibdin, year after year... had been giving delight and, for a time, acquiring great emolument, by means of entertainments under different names, in which he not only pleased but instructed the public; advancing the cause of morals by natural and energetic sentiments, and raising the flame of patriotism and loyalty by songs and speeches, just in conception and illustration, and impressive on the memory and the judgement by vivid imagery and pointed expression. His sea-songs form a class by themselves: they are calculated alike to cheer solitude and to animate social assemblages, to raise the laugh and the tear, and to engrave on the heart benevolence, courage, and a trust in Providence.&quot; Charles&#x27;s son Thomas Dibdin, a close associate of John Bannister, wrote that &quot;Charles Bannister, and his exemplary son John, were two of [Dibdin&#x27;s] most intimate friends.&quot;

===An impression of Dibdin===
The author of his memoir, who witnessed one of Dibdin&#x27;s Entertainments Sans Souci when a lad, offers the following picture: &#x27;Dibdin was then a handsome man, of middle size, with an open pleasing countenance, and a very gentlemanlike appearance and address. His costume was a blue coat, white waistcoat, and black silk breeches and stockings; and he wore his hair, in the fashion of the day, fully dressed and profusely powdered. His manner of speaking was easy and colloquial; and his air was more that of a person entertaining a party of friends in a private drawing-room, than of a performer exhibiting to a public audience. He was near-sighted; and, when seated at his instrument, he would bend his head close to his book for a few moments, and then, laying it down, throw himself back in his chair, and deliver his song without further reference to book or music. His voice was a &quot;baryton&quot; (a medium between the tenor and the bass) of no great power or compass, but of a sweet and mellow quality. He sang with simplicity, without any attempt at ambitious ornament, but with a great deal of taste and expression; and, being a poet as well as a musician, he was particularly attentive to a clear and emphatic utterance of the words... In singing, he accompanied himself with facility and neatness, on an instrument of a peculiar kind, combining the properties of the pianoforte and the chamber organ, and so constructed that the performer could produce the tones of either instrument separately, or of both in combination. To this instrument were attached a set of bells, a side drum, a tambourine, and a gong, which he could bring into play by various mechanical contrivances, so as to give a pleasing variety to his accompaniments.&#x27;

&#x27;His manner of coming upon the stage was in a happy style; he ran on sprightly and with nearly a laughing face, like a friend who enters hastily to impart to you some good news.&#x27;

=== War songs and later years ===
Dibdin&#x27;s patriotic sea songs and their melodious refrains powerfully influenced the national spirit and were officially appropriated to the use of the British navy during the war with France. They were not shanties or working songs, but a form of distinctively English ballad combining the tonality of the hornpipe with vivid if sentimentalized depictions of the comradeship, the separations from love, the simple patriotism, loyalty and manly courage of Tom, England&#x27;s Jack Tar. In 1803 he was induced by Pitt&#x27;s government, with a pension of £200 a year (), to abandon provincial engagements to compose and sing &#x27;War Songs&#x27; to keep up the ferment of popular feeling against France. This was withdrawn for a time under the administration of Lord Grenville, but afterwards partly restored.

Dibdin still provided texts for operas, including &quot;The Cabinet&quot;, which was presented at Covent Garden in February 1803 with John Braham, Nancy Storace and Charles Incledon, and in December &quot;The British Fleet in 1342&quot;. At least two further operas appeared: &quot;Broken Gold&quot; was a farce in two acts on the occasion of Lord Nelson&#x27;s victory and death, produced at Drury Lane with John Bannister in 1806, which was &#x27;damned on the first night, and never published&#x27;. His last production, &quot;The Round Robin&quot;, was first acted at the Haymarket in June 1811. This incorporated his highly successful song &#x27;The standing toast,&#x27; which had been written some time before.

During this period, in 1805, he sold Sans Souci and opened a music shop in the Strand (opposite the &quot;Lyceum&quot;), but the venture was a failure and he was declared bankrupt. He retired from public life in 1805, disposing of his stock (including the copyright of 360 songs) to a firm in Oxford Street for £1,800, with £100 a year for the next three years in consideration of whatever songs he might write. He took up residence in Arlington Road in Camden Town, where he suffered a paralytic stroke in 1813 after which the government granted him a pension of £200. In 1810 a subscription dinner and concert was held for his benefit. This raised £640, of which £560 was invested in long annuities for himself and his family. He died on 25 July 1814 in comparative poverty, and was buried in St Martin&#x27;s churchyard there. His widow placed a stone over his grave inscribed with a quatrain from &quot;Tom Bowling&quot;.

=== Other writings ===
Besides his &quot;Musical Tour through England&quot; (1788), his &quot;Professional Life&quot;, an autobiography published in 4 volumes in 1803, a &quot;Complete History of the British Stage&quot; (5 vols, 1795), &quot;Observations on a Tour&quot; through England and Scotland (2 vols, 1803) and several smaller works, he wrote upwards of 1400 songs and about thirty dramatic pieces. He also wrote the following novels: &quot;The Devil&quot; (2 vols, 1785); &quot;Hannah Hewitt&quot; (3 vols, 1792); &quot;The Younger Brother&quot; (3 vols, 1793) and &quot;Henry Hooka&quot; (3 vols, 1806). An edition of his songs by G. Hogarth (1843) contains a memoir of his life.

== Allusions in music and literature ==
The tune of &quot;Tom Bowling&quot; forms part of Sir Henry Wood&#x27;s 1905 &quot;Fantasia on British Sea Songs&quot; customarily played on the Last Night of the Proms. Verdant Green, eponymous hero of the novel by Cuthbert Bede, learns to row and &#x27;feathers his oars with skill and dexterity&#x27; (Part II Chapter VI), borrowing a line from Dibdin&#x27;s song &quot;The Jolly Young Waterman.&quot; The great Victorian baritone Sir Charles Santley made his farewell performance at Covent Garden in 1911 in the role of Tom Tug in Dibdin&#x27;s opera &quot;The Waterman&quot;. And in James Joyce&#x27;s story &quot;Eveline&quot; (from &quot;Dubliners&quot;), Frank &#x27;sang about the lass that loves a sailor&#x27; from the song of the same name (also called &#x27;The standing toast&#x27;) by Dibdin.

Just before his marriage, James Boswell wrote a song, &quot;A Matrimonial Thought&quot; which was given a tune &quot;by the very ingenious Mr. Dibden.&quot;

In the blithe days of honey-moon,&lt;br&gt;
With Kathe&#x27;s allurements smitten,&lt;br&gt;
I lov&#x27;d her late, I lov&#x27;d her soon&lt;br&gt;
And I called her dearest kitten.&lt;br&gt;
But now my kitten&#x27;s grown a cat,&lt;br&gt;
And cross like other wives,&lt;br&gt;
O! by my soul, my honest Mat,&lt;br&gt;
I fear she has nine lives.
==Family==
Dibdin had married early in life, but deserted his first wife and left her destitute. He then formed an illicit connection with Harriett Pitt (stage name Mrs. Davenet), a chorus-singer at Covent Garden Theatre, and had some children by her. In time he deserted Harriet in favour of Ann Wyld, with whom he remained and had several further children during his wife&#x27;s lifetime, and finally married Wyld in 1798 after his first wife died. She and only one daughter of that union survived him. 

Dibdin&#x27;s two sons with Harriet − Charles and Thomas John Dibdin, whose works are often confused with those of their father − were also popular dramatists in their day. Through his son Thomas, Dibdin was an ancestor of the British politician Michael Heseltine.

He was also the uncle of the bibliographer Thomas Frognall Dibdin.

==Public memorials ==
Seven years after his death a subscription to raise a monument to Dibdin was set in train under the patronage of the Duke of Clarence and Admiral Sir George York. At a public dinner and concert a large sum was raised, but insufficient to complete the project. A second grand musical entertainment, &quot;The Feast of Neptune,&quot; raised a further £400 and the monument was eventually raised in the Veterans&#x27; Library at the Royal Hospital, Greenwich, which is now the Peacock Room, part of the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance.

British politician Michael Heseltine is a distant descendant of Dibdin, having &#x27;Dibdin&#x27; as one of his middle names. He is a fan of Dibdin&#x27;s works, and was responsible for the government&#x27;s erection of a statue of Dibdin in Greenwich.

On the west face of the tower of Holyrood Church in Southampton is a memorial plaque to Dibdin, where he is described as a &quot;native of Southampton, poet, dramatist and composer, author of Tom Bowling, Poor Jack and other sea songs&quot;.

In 1889 a Celtic cross memorial was erected, by public subscription, in St Martin&#x27;s Gardens, Camden Town, after his original tomb collapsed. A verse from &quot;Tom Bowling&quot; is inscribed upon it:
:His form was of the manliest beauty,
:His heart was kind and soft,
:Faithful, below, he did his duty;
:But now he&#x27;s gone aloft.

Also in Camden, in Joseph Grimaldi Park a grave-style musical memorial for Dibdin is placed next to one for Joseph Grimaldi.

== Recordings ==
Three recent discs of Dibdin&#x27;s music have been recorded and released by Retrospect Opera. The first, which appeared in 2017, comprises &quot;Christmas Gambols&quot; and &quot;The Musical Tour of Mr Dibdin&quot;. The second, released in 2019, includes Dibdin&#x27;s &quot;The Jubilee&quot;, &quot;Queen Mab&quot; and &quot;Datchet Mead&quot;. 
The third, &quot;The Wags&quot;, was released in late 2021. All feature the singer Simon Butteriss and the keyboardist Stephen Higgins. &quot;The Jubilee&quot; also features the singers Soraya Mafi, Robert Murray and Heather Shipp.

A previous disc featuring Dibdin&#x27;s &quot;The Ephesian Matron&quot;, &quot;The Brickdust Man&quot; and &quot;The Grenadier&quot;, conducted by Peter Holman, was released on the Hyperion label in 1992. There have also been many recordings of Dibdin&#x27;s most famous song, &quot;Tom Bowling&quot;.

<text>Thomas John Dibdin (21 March 1771 – 16 September 1841) was an English dramatist and songwriter.

==Life==
Dibdin was the son of Charles Dibdin, a songwriter and theatre manager, and of &quot;Mrs Davenet&quot;, an actress whose real name was Harriett Pitt. He was introduced to the stage at five years old, in his godfather David Garrick’s pageant of ‘’Jubilee of Shakespeare’’. Mrs Siddons was The Venus and the Young Tom Cupid. He was apprenticed to his maternal uncle, a London upholsterer, and later to William Rawlins, afterwards sheriff of London. He summoned his second master unsuccessfully for rough treatment; and after a few years of service he ran away to join a company of country players. From 1789 to 1795 he played all sorts of parts; he worked as a scene painter at Liverpool in 1791; and during this period he composed more than 1,000 songs.

His first work as a dramatist was &quot;Something New&quot;, followed by &quot;The Mad Guardian&quot; in 1795. He returned to London in 1795, having married two years before; and in the winter of 1798–99 &quot;The Jew and the Doctor&quot; was produced at Theatre Royal, Covent Garden. From this time he contributed a very large number of comedies, operas, farces, etc., to the public entertainment, including (in 1802) the comic opera &quot;Family Quarrels&quot;. Some of these brought immense popularity to the writer and immense profits to the theatres. It is stated that the pantomime of &quot;Mother Goose&quot; (1807) produced more than £20,000 for the management at Covent Garden theatre, and the &quot;High-mettled Racer&quot;, adapted as a pantomime from his father&#x27;s play, £18,000 at Astley&#x27;s.

Dibdin was prompter and pantomime writer at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane until 1816, when he took over the Surrey Theatre. This venture proved disastrous, and he became bankrupt. After this, he was manager of the Haymarket Theatre, but without his old success, and his last years were passed in comparative poverty. In 1827 he published two volumes of &quot;Reminiscences&quot;; and at the time of his death he was preparing an edition of his father&#x27;s sea songs, for which a small sum was allowed him weekly by the Lords of the Admiralty. Of his own songs, &quot;The Oak Table&quot; and &quot;The Snug Little Island&quot; were popular at the time. He died leaving a widow (second wife) and young family.

Charles Dickens quotes from Dibdin&#x27;s patriotic song &quot;The Snug Little Island&quot; in &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;:

Daddy Neptune one day to Freedom did say,&lt;br&gt;
&quot;If ever I lived upon dry land.&lt;br&gt;
The spot I should hit on would be little Britain!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Says Freedom, &quot;Why that&#x27;s my own island!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Oh, it&#x27;s a snug little island!&lt;br&gt;
A right little, tight little island,&lt;br&gt;
Search the globe round, none can be found&lt;br&gt;
So happy as this little island.&lt;br&gt;

The song was published posthumously in 1841 in the Addenda (containing songs of T. Dibdin) to &quot;Songs of the Late Charles Dibdin&quot;, a collection arranged by Thomas Dibdin with sketches by George Cruikshank. A copy was found in Dickens&#x27;s library after his death.

==Family==
Dibdin married Nancy Hilliar in 1793. Their granddaughter Eve Mary Dibdin married the tea salesman William Heseltine and was the great grandmother of the British politician Michael Heseltine.

<text>The todies are a family, Todidae, of tiny Caribbean birds in the order Coraciiformes, which also includes the kingfishers, bee-eaters and rollers. The family has one living genus, &quot;Todus&quot;, and one genus known from the fossil record, &quot;Palaeotodus&quot;.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The todies were originally placed in the kingfisher genus &quot;Alcedo&quot; before being placed in the genus &quot;Todus&quot; in 1760 by Mathurin Jacques Brisson. They have been linked to a large number of potential relatives since then, including nightjars, trogons, barbets, jacamars, puffbirds, kingfishers, motmots and even some passerine species such as broadbills, cotingas and flowerpeckers. The todies were placed in their own order, Todiformes, before being placed in the Coraciiformes.

Genetic analysis of the extant (living) species suggests that they diversified between 6-7 million years ago. The fossil record of the family is sparse, but three species of tody have been described from fossils found in North America, Germany and France, showing that the family was once more widespread than it is today. Species from the fossil genus, &quot;Palaeotodus&quot;, are larger than living species and may have been closer in size to the tody motmot.

The phylogenetic relationship between the six families that make up the order Coraciiformes is shown in the cladogram below. The number of species in each family is taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).
==Distribution and habitat==
The todies are endemic to the islands of the Caribbean. These are small, near passerine species of forests of the Greater Antilles: Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and Cuba, with adjacent islands, have one species each, and Hispaniola has two: the broad-billed tody (&quot;Todus subulatus&quot;) in the lowlands (including Gonâve Island), and the narrow-billed tody (&quot;Todus angustirostris&quot;) in the highlands.

==Description==
Todies range in weight from 5 to 7 g and in length from 10 to 11.5 cm. They have colourful plumage, and resemble kingfishers in their general shape. They have green heads, backs and wings, red throats (absent in immature Puerto Rican, broad-billed, and narrow-billed todies) with a white and blue-grey stripe on each side, and yellow undertail coverts; the colour of the rest of the undersides is pale and varies according to species. The irises are pale grey. They have long, flattened bills (as do many flycatching birds) with serrated edges; the upper mandible is black and the lower is red with a little black. The legs, and especially the feet, are small. Todies are highly vocal, except that the Jamaican tody seldom calls in the non-breeding season (August to November); they give simple, unmusical buzzing notes, beeps, and guttural rattles, puffing their throats out with every call. Their wings produce a &quot;strange, whirring rattle&quot;, though mostly when courting or defending territory in the Puerto Rican tody.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Diet===
Todies eat small prey such as insects and lizards. Insects, from 50 families have been identified in their diet, particularly grasshoppers, crickets, beetles, bugs, butterflies, bees, wasps, and ants, form the greater part of the diet. Spiders and millipedes may also be taken, as is a small amount of fruit (2% of the diet).

Their preferred habitat for foraging is in the forest understory. Todies typically sit on a low, small branch, singly or in pairs, keeping still or stepping or hopping sideways. When they see prey moving on the lower surface of a leaf, they fly a short distance (averaging 2.2 m in the broad-billed tody and 1.0 m in the Puerto Rican tody), diagonally upward to glean it. They may also take prey from the ground, occasionally chasing it with a few hops. Todies are generally sedentary; the longest single flight known for the broad-billed tody is 40 m. Their activity is greatest in the morning when sunny weather follows rain, and in March and September.

Todies are highly territorial but will join mixed-species foraging flocks composed of resident species and migrants from North America, when they pass through their territories.

===Breeding===
Like most of the Coraciiformes, todies nest in tunnels, which they dig with their beaks and feet in steep banks or rotten tree trunks. The tunnel is 30 cm long in the Cuban and narrow-billed todies, 30 to 60 cm in the broad-billed tody, and ends in a nest chamber, generally not reused. They lay about four round white eggs in the chamber. Both parents incubate but are surprisingly inattentive to the eggs. The young are altricial and stay in the nest until they can fly. Both parents also care for the nestlings, much more attentively; they may feed each chick up to 140 times per day, the highest rate known among birds.

<text>James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps (born James Orchard Halliwell; 21 June 1820 – 3 January 1889) was an English writer, Shakespearean scholar, antiquarian, and a collector of English nursery rhymes and fairy tales.

==Life==
The son of Thomas Halliwell, he was born at Sloane Street, Chelsea, London and was educated privately and at Jesus College, Cambridge. He devoted himself to antiquarian research, particularly of early English literature. Beginning at the age of 16, between 1836 and 1837, he contributed 47 articles to &quot;The Parthenon. A Weekly Journal of English and Foreign Literature, the Arts, and Sciences&quot;; in 1839 he edited Sir John Mandeville&#x27;s &quot;Travels&quot;; in 1842 published an &quot;Account of the European manuscripts in the Chetham Library&quot;, besides a newly discovered metrical romance of the 15th century (&quot;Torrent of Portugal&quot;).

In 1841, while at Cambridge, Halliwell dedicated his book &quot;Reliquae Antiquae&quot; to Sir Thomas Phillipps, the noted bibliomaniac. Phillipps invited Halliwell to stay at his estate, Middle Hill. There Halliwell met Phillipps&#x27;s daughter, Henrietta, to whom he soon proposed marriage. However, also around this time, Halliwell was accused of stealing manuscripts from Trinity College, Cambridge. Although no prosecution was brought, Phillipps&#x27;s suspicions were aroused and he refused to consent to the marriage. This led to the couple&#x27;s elopement in 1842. Phillipps refused ever to see his daughter or Halliwell again.

In 1842, Halliwell published the first edition of &quot;Nursery Rhymes of England&quot; followed by &quot;Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Tales&quot;, containing the first printed version of the &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; and a version of the Christmas carol &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;.

From 1845, Halliwell was excluded from the library of the British Museum on account of the suspicion concerning his possession of some manuscripts which had been removed from the library of Trinity College, Cambridge. He published privately an explanation of the matter in 1845. Halliwell also had a habit, detested by bibliophiles, of cutting up seventeenth-century books and pasting parts he liked into scrapbooks. During his life he destroyed 800 books and made 3,600 scraps.

In 1848, he published his &quot;Life of Shakespeare&quot;, illustrated by John Thomas Blight (1835–1911), which had several editions; in 1853–1865 a sumptuous edition, limited to 150 copies, of Shakespeare in folio, with full critical notes. After 1870 he entirely gave up textual criticism, and devoted his attention to elucidating the particulars of Shakespeare&#x27;s life. He collated all the available facts and documents in relation to it, and exhausted the information to be found in local records in his &quot;Outlines of the Life of Shakespeare&quot;. He was instrumental in the purchase of New Place for the corporation of Stratford-on-Avon, and in the formation there of the Shakespeare museum.

He assumed the name of Phillipps in 1872, under the will of the grandfather of his first wife, Henrietta Phillipps. He took an active interest in the Camden Society, the Percy Society and the Shakespeare Society, for which he edited many early English and Elizabethan works. He died on 3 January 1889 at his home, and was buried in Patcham churchyard, near Hollingbury in East Sussex.

His house, Hollingbury Copse, near Brighton, was full of rare and curious works, and he generously gave many of them to Chetham&#x27;s Library, Manchester, to the Morrab Library of Penzance, to the Smithsonian Institution, and to the library of the University of Edinburgh.

His company Heinkel Flugzeugwerke produced the Heinkel He 178, the world&#x27;s first turbojet-powered aircraft, and the Heinkel He 176, the first rocket aircraft.

==Early life==
Heinkel was born in Grunbach, today a part of Remshalden. As a young man he became an apprentice machinist at a foundry. Heinkel studied at the Technical Academy of Stuttgart, where he initially became interested in aviation through a fascination with Zeppelins, and in 1909 attended an international airshow in Frankfurt am Main. He decided that flight was the future of transportation, and the following year he built his first aircraft, working from a set of plans by Henri Farman. Heinkel crashed it in 1911 and suffered severe injuries.

==Albatros Flugzeugwerke==
Soon afterwards, he got a job at Luft-Verkehrs Gesellschaft (LVG), who were building Farman aircraft. From there, he went to Albatros. After the war Heinkel claimed to have designed the Albatros B.II, a successful reconnaissance and trainer aircraft used during the early stages of the First World War, but its main designer was in fact Robert Thelen. His aircraft were used by the Austro-Hungarian army and Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; during the war. After leaving Albatros, Heinkel designed several land- and seaplanes for the Hansa-Brandenburg company starting in 1914.

==Heinkel-Flugzeugwerke==
In 1921, Heinkel was appointed head designer of the recently re-established Caspar-Werke, but soon left after a dispute over ownership of a design. In 1922 he established the Heinkel-Flugzeugwerke company at Warnemünde. Due to the restrictions placed on German aircraft manufacturing by the Treaty of Versailles, Heinkel looked overseas for contracts, with some seaplane designs being licence-built in Sweden and working on catapult-launched seaplanes for the Imperial Japanese Navy. He installed a similar catapult on the ocean liner Bremen for launching mail planes.

===Versailles Treaty violations===
Between 1921 and 1924, the Japanese government placed several orders with Heinkel&#x27;s company, and helped him skirt the Versailles Treaty, which banned the construction of military aircraft in Germany, by informing the company of facility inspections by allied commissions in advance. Japan was part of the inspection commission. Heinkel hid his aircraft in dunes behind his plant and they were never discovered during inspections. Heinkel noted in his memoirs that his company&#x27;s relationship with Japan in the 1920s led to decades of cooperation.

==1933–1945==

After Adolf Hitler came to power, designs by Heinkel&#x27;s firm formed a vital part of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s growing strength in the years leading up to the Second World War. This included the Heinkel He 59, the Heinkel He 115 and the Heinkel He 111. He was designated a &quot;Wehrwirtschaftführer&quot; (defence industry leader) by the German government for his commitment to rearmament.

Heinkel was passionate about high-speed flight, and was keen on exploring alternative forms of aircraft propulsion. He donated aircraft to Wernher von Braun who was investigating rocket propulsion for aircraft, as well as sponsoring the research of Hans von Ohain into turbojet engines, leading to the flight of the Heinkel He 178, the first aircraft to fly solely under turbojet power, on August 27, 1939.

Heinkel had been a critic of Hitler&#x27;s regime, having been forced to fire Jewish designers and staff in 1933; he was, however, a member of the Nazi Party, and was awarded the German National Prize for Art and Science in 1938, one of the rarest honors of the German government. Heinkel Flugzeugwerke used forced Jewish labor, starting in 1941.

In 1943, the armaments authority finally ordered him to transform the company into &quot;Ernst Heinkel AG&quot;. Heinkel retained two-thirds of the capital, but became chairman of the supervisory board. Heinkel moved to Vienna and started a new design bureau and corporate offices in Vienna&#x27;s Schwechat suburb, establishing manufacturing facilities in Zwölfaxing and Floridsdorf as the &quot;Heinkel-Sud&quot; complex for his firm, the original Rostock-&quot;Marienehe&quot; plant (today&#x27;s Rostock-Schmarl neighborhood) becoming the &quot;Heinkel-Nord&quot; facility. It was at the &quot;Heinkel-Sud&quot; offices that Dr. Heinkel worked on the Heinkel He 274 four-engined high-altitude heavy bomber design—as one of the trio of proposals for aircraft designs to succeed his firm&#x27;s failed Heinkel He 177A heavy bomber—including an unbuilt &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; design—until the war&#x27;s end concluded the production of the firm&#x27;s &quot;Spatz&quot; single-seat jet fighter.

==Post-war==
In July 1945 Heinkel was captured by American troops and held for possible exploitation and/or possible trial under Operation Dustbin, and was held for a time at Kransberg Castle, near Frankfurt.

With Germany forbidden from manufacturing aircraft by the Allies, Heinkel used his company&#x27;s facilities to build private transportation. In 1953 Heinkel began production of the Tourist scooter, followed by the Perle moped in 1954. In 1956 he introduced the Heinkel Kabine bubble car. Bubble car and moped production ceased shortly after the restriction on aircraft manufacture was lifted, but scooter production continued until 1965. In 1959, Heinkel&#x27;s company was sued by Edmund Bartl for being enriched by slave labour during World War II; however, the German Supreme Court dismissed his claims for filing too late, and ordered Bartl to pay court costs and attorney&#x27;s fees.

==Death and legacy==
Heinkel died in 1958 in Stuttgart. His autobiography, &quot;Stürmisches Leben&quot;, was published in 1956 and translated into English as &quot;He1000&quot; in its British edition and &quot;Stormy Life: Memoirs of a Pioneer of the Air Age&quot; in its US edition.

In 1981, Heinkel was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

<doc id="261525" wikidata="Q7200372" url="?curid=261525" title="Plachutta">
<text>The Plachutta is a device found in chess problems wherein a piece is sacrificially positioned in blockade to deny coverage of multiple distant squares required by the opposition. For example, two of an opponent&#x27;s bishops, queen, or rooks are defending locations through an intersection square, and an enemy unit moved into that square blocks disrupts coverage in such a way that, even if captured, the previous defensive situation cannot be restored.

The Plachutta is named after Joseph Plachutta (1827–1883), and related to a number of other problem themes: it can be regarded as a Würzburg–Plachutta brought about by a sacrifice on the critical square (a Würzburg-Plachutta itself being a pair of Holzhausen interferences); or it can be thought of as a Novotny with similarly moving (rather than differently moving) black pieces involved (a Novotny itself being a Grimshaw brought about by a white sacrifice on the critical square). It can also be compared to the anti-Bristol, in which two similarly moving black pieces interfere with each other along the same line.

==Examples==
===1.===
The problem to the right is a relatively simple example by William Shinkman, published in &quot;White Rooks&quot;, 1910. It is a mate in three (white moves first and must checkmate black in three moves against any defence). The (first move of the solution) is 1.d5!. Examining the initial position reveals why this works: white would like to play either 1.Ra8 or 1.Rg8, but the former is prevented by black&#x27;s bishop and the latter is prevented by black&#x27;s queen. 1.d5 blocks the paths of both black pieces to these squares, and whichever black piece takes the pawn interferes with the other and has to defend against both threats itself (to use chess jargon, it becomes overloaded). So, if 1...Qxd5 white can play 2.Ra8+ Qxa8, when the queen is deflected from her defence of g8, allowing 3.Rg8#, while if 1...Bxd5 white can play 2.Rg8+ Bxg8, deflecting the bishop from defence of a8, allowing 3.Ra8#.
===2.===

To the right is another relatively simple example, but this time it is two rooks, rather than bishop and queen, involved in the interferences. The problem, by D. J. Densmore, published in the &quot;Gazette-Times&quot;, 1916, is another mate in three. The key is 1.Nb7!, which interferes with both rooks and so threatens both 2.Rh7# and 2.Rb1#. Black can defend with Raxb7, but this overloads the capturing rook, so white can play 2.Rb1+ Rxb1 3.Rh7#. The other capture is similar: 1...Rbxb7 2.Rh7+ Rxh7 3.Rb1#. Whichever rook captures, it interferes with the other and becomes overloaded, having to defend against two threats on its own.
===3.===

A more sophisticated modern example is the award-winning mate-in-four problem to the right by Aleksandr N. Pankrat&#x27;ev and Josip Varga, which was published in &quot;Sahovski Glasnik&quot; in 1991 and won 1st prize. White begins with 1.e3, adding protection to d4 and threatening 2.Rc5#. Black&#x27;s two main defenses are the two captures on e3, but each one allows a different Plachutta interference by White on move 2. If 1...Rxe3, White plays 2.f4!, a Plachutta interference with the queen and bishop: 2...Qxf4 allows 3.Nxe3+ Qxe3 4.Nxe5# and 2...Bxf4 allows 3.Nxe5+ Bxe5 4.Nxe3#. If 1...Bxe3, White plays 2.Bb3+!, a Plachutta interference with the two black rooks: 2...Rbxb3 allows 3.Nxe3+ Rxe3 4.Nb6# and 2...Raxb3 allows 3.Nb6+ Rxb6 4.Nxe3#.

* 1.e3 anything-else 2. Rc5#
* 1.e3 Rxe3 2.f4 Qxf4 allows 3.Nxe3+ Qxe3 4.Nxe5#.
* 1.e3 Rxe3 2.f4 Bxf4 allows 3.Nxe5+ Bxe5 4.Nxe3#.
* 1.e3 Bxe3 2.Bb3+ Rbxb3 allows 3.Nxe3+ Rxe3 4.Nb6#. 
* 1.e3 Bxe3 2.Bb3+ Raxb3 allows 3.Nb6+ Rxb6 4.Nxe3#

===4.===

Although the term &quot;Plachutta&quot; is confined to the world of chess problems, not being used in a wider chess context, the underlying Plachutta pattern does occasionally (though rarely) appear in an actual game. One example is to the right, a position which occurred in a 1914 game between Siegbert Tarrasch (with white) and a team of opponents consisting of Davide Marotti (who became the champion of Italy in 1921), E. Napoli, de Simone, and del Giudice. In the diagrammed position, the black queen defends against Qb7 and the rook on c8 defends against Rxc5. Tarrasch played 31.Bc7!, a Plachutta interference after which black cannot maintain control over both b7 and c5 (Black actually resigned after this move). If 31...Rxc7 the rook is overloaded, having to look after both the key squares: 32.Qb7+ Rxb7 and the rook is deflected from defence of c5, allowing 33.Rxc5#. If instead 31...Qxc7 it is the queen which is overloaded: 32.Rxc5+ Qxc5 deflects the queen from defence of b7, allowing 33.Qb7+ Kxa5 34.Ra1#.

<text>The Alphabet Synthesis Machine (2002) is a work of interactive art which makes use of genetic algorithms to &quot;evolve&quot; a set of glyphs similar in appearance to a real-world alphabet. Users create initial glyphs and the program takes over. As the creators of the project put it, their goal was &quot;to bring about the specific feeling of semi-sense one experiences when one recognizes—- but cannot read—- the unfamiliar writing of another culture.&quot; The project was developed by Golan Levin, a new-media artist, in collaboration with Cassidy Curtis and Jonathan Feinberg.

<text>Jymie Merritt (; May 3, 1926 – April 10, 2020) was an American jazz bassist, bandleader, and composer. Merritt was a member of Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers group from 1957 until 1962. The same year he left Blakey&#x27;s band, Merritt formed his own group, The Forerunners, which he led sporadically until his death in 2020. Merritt also worked as a sideman for blues and jazz musicians such as Bull Moose Jackson, B.B. King, Chet Baker, Max Roach, Dizzy Gillespie, and Lee Morgan.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Philadelphia, Jymie Merritt, was the son of Agnes Merritt (née Robinson), a choral director, voice and piano teacher, and Raleigh Howard &quot;RH&quot; Merritt, a businessman and author. After serving in the U.S. Army during World War II from 1944 to 1946 Jymie returned home to work for a short time in his father&#x27;s real estate business, and after a brief flirtation with the clarinet he was inspired by a Duke Ellington recording featuring bassist Jimmy Blanton. Encouraged by his mother he studied with Carl Torello, double bassist for the Philadelphia Orchestra, and at the Ornstein School of Music in Philadelphia.

==Career highlights==
Merritt worked in jazz, R&amp;B, and blues. In the early 1950s he toured with rock and roll musicians Bull Moose Jackson and Chris Powell moving on to work with bluesman BB King from 1955 to 1957.

In 1957, Merritt moved to Manhattan, New York, to work with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. The Messenger ensemble Merritt joined featured his friend Benny Golson as well as Bobby Timmons and Lee Morgan. Merritt&#x27;s touring and recording with Blakey extended until 1962, when an unknown ailment forced him to stop touring.

By 1964, Merritt was back, working with the trumpeter and vocalist Chet Baker, and is featured prominently in Baker&#x27;s unfinished autobiography published under the title &quot;As Though I Had Wings: The Lost Memoir&quot;.

From 1965 to 1968, Merritt worked with the drummer, composer and activist Max Roach, not only in the rhythm section but as a composer, recording &quot;Nommo&quot; on Roach&#x27;s Atlantic album &quot;Drums Unlimited&quot; (1966). &quot;Nommo&quot; would earn Merritt a nomination for Best Jazz Composer in &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine&#x27;s Critics Poll.

Merritt left Max Roach in the late 1960s to work with trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, appearing with Gillespie&#x27;s band on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;.

One of Jymie Merritt&#x27;s most productive showcases as a composer was when he reunited with his former Jazz Messenger Lee Morgan. Morgan&#x27;s Blue Note album &quot;Live at the Lighthouse&quot; (1970) featuring Merritt&#x27;s composition &quot;Absolutions&quot; (recorded earlier by Max Roach).

In 1962, Jymie Merritt formed and fronted the Forerunners in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The band, which evolved into a music cooperative exploring Merritt&#x27;s own system of chord inversions, harmonics, and unique approaches to composition and rehearsals, produced a lexicon of its own known as the &quot;Forerunner system&quot; or concept. The Forerunner concept in its early days culminated in Merritt&#x27;s expansive composition &quot;Visions of the Ghost Dance&quot;.

Among the original members of the Forerunner band were Odean Pope, Kenny Lowe, Donald Bailey, and September Wrice. This group performed regularly in and around Philadelphia for five years, until Merritt joined Max Roach&#x27;s band. Pope also joined Roach&#x27;s band, playing with him into the 1970s. Forerunner was on and off periodically from the 1960s through the 1980s, depending on what band Merritt was playing with at the time as well as how his health was. Saxophonist Bobby Zankel was a member of the second incarnation of the band when he joined in 1982, which also included Alan Nelson, Odean Pope, Julian Pressley, Colmore Duncan, and Warren McLendon. Zankel is primarily known as an alto saxophonist, but played baritone sax with the band, and described the role of the sax section over solos as taking on an accompanying role, where they would always play under the soloist, comparing it to the typical role of the bassist but in the sax section.&quot; Approaching his 90th birthday Merritt continued to rehearse and perform with the current incarnation of The Forerunners, some of whom had been with the ensemble from its inception.

==Pioneer of the electric bass==
Merritt joined the Bull Moose Jackson band in 1949, and was an early adopter of the Ampeg Baby bass (a hybrid acoustic-electric instrument).
Merritt recalls when he first bought a Fender bass guitar:

&quot;Now all this time, I had been playing electric bass, from about the first year of service with the Bull Moose band. We were out in Oklahoma somewhere, when Benny Golson saw this Western band, what you call a hillbilly band, with a fellow
playing what looked like a guitar and sounded like a bass. Benny got me over to hear this and we later saw one in a music store. Benny went in for some reeds or something, so I tried a Fender electric bass and that night I took it to work. The
owner let me take it and I tried it out working and nobody raised any objection. I had been having trouble with my own bass, one of the assembly line types, so I was in the market for a new bass. Anyway, I got curious and bought the thing and
played it for the next seven years or so. I guess at the time I was the only one in jazz playing an electric bass. Certainly, I’m pretty sure Monk Montgomery wasn’t playing one because we used to see him in Minneapolis and he was always
interested to see the instrument.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
In November 2013, along with friend and fellow bassist Reggie Workman, Jymie Merritt received the Clef Club of Philadelphia&#x27;s Living Legend, Jazz Award.

At the 2009 Philadelphia Jazz Fair, produced by musician and professor Don Glanden, Philadelphia&#x27;s University of the Arts and the Jazz Heritage Project honored Jymie Merritt and the jazz organist Trudy Pitts with the Jazz Heritage Award. Merritt&#x27;s award was presented to him by another great Philadelphia bassist, the late Charles Fambrough.

In addition, Jymie Merritt was honored with the Don Redman Heritage Award in June 2008 at a ceremony and concert in Harper&#x27;s Ferry, West Virginia at the annual event sponsored by the Harpers Ferry Historical Association and the Jefferson County NAACP in cooperation with the Don Redman Heritage Society of Piedmont, West Virginia.

==Personal life==
Merritt&#x27;s marriage to Dorothy Viola Small (d. 2008) produced five children: Mharlyn Merritt, a writer and vocalist who received a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship for Jazz Performance in 1988; Marlon Merritt, an accomplished guitarist and retired career Army veteran of the Iraqi War; Martyn Merritt (deceased), world traveler, bon vivant and classical pianist who studied with internationally acclaimed pianist Leon Bates; Marvon Merritt, percussionist and drummer, and Mike Merritt, a renowned bassist in his own right who has performed and recorded with Levon Helm, Phoebe Snow, Johnny Copeland, B. B. King and many other world-class musicians. Mike is best known as the bassist for the Basic Cable Band on Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s TBS talk-show. Continuing the family&#x27;s musical heritage in 2005 Mike co-produced along with his sister Mharlyn an independent CD on the EMerrittus label featuring brother Marlon on guitar, Uri Caine, Al Kooper, Lew Soloff and the Vivino Brothers entitled &quot;Alone Together&quot;.

Merritt had a younger brother, LeRoy Merritt, an amateur artist and arts and crafts enthusiast who lived in West Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Merritt lived in Center City, Philadelphia, with his wife Ave and his cat Jazzie. He died on April 10, 2020, of liver cancer in Philadelphia, aged 93.

<text>A winch is a mechanical device that is used to pull in (wind up) or let out (wind out) or otherwise adjust the tension of a rope or wire rope (also called &quot;cable&quot; or &quot;wire cable&quot;).

In its simplest form, it consists of a spool (or drum) attached to a hand crank. Traditionally, winches on ships accumulated wire or rope on the drum; those that do not accumulate, and instead pass on the wire/rope (see yacht photo above), are called capstans. Despite this, sailboat capstans are most often referred to as winches. Winches are the basis of such machines as tow trucks, steam shovels and elevators. More complex designs have gear assemblies and can be powered by electric, hydraulic, pneumatic or internal combustion drives. It might include a solenoid brake and/or a mechanical brake or ratchet and pawl which prevents it unwinding unless the pawl is retracted. The rope may be stored on the winch. When trimming a line on a sailboat, the crew member turns the winch handle with one hand, while tailing (pulling on the loose tail end) with the other to maintain tension on the turns. Some winches have a &quot;stripper&quot; or cleat to maintain tension. These are known as &quot;self-tailing&quot; winches.

==History==

===In the Ancient World===

The earliest literary reference to a winch can be found in the account of Herodotus of Halicarnassus on the Persian Wars (&quot;Histories&quot; 7.36), where he describes how wooden winches were used to tighten the cables for a pontoon bridge across the Hellespont in 480 BCE. Winches may have been employed even earlier in Assyria. 

By the 4th century BCE, winch and pulley hoists were regarded by Aristotle as common for architectural use (&quot;Mech&quot;. 18; 853b10-13).

===In the 20th Century===
The yacht &quot;Reliance&quot;, American defender of the 1903 America&#x27;s Cup, was the first racing boat to be fitted with modern winches below decks. The &quot;Reliance&#x27;s&quot; competitors relied on muscle power using topside mounted capstans and windlasses, which would soon be replaced in most applications by winches, including on fishing boats, where they are used to bring in the fishing nets.

==Other applications ==
===Vehicle recovery===

The main feature that legally distinguishes a tow truck from a conventional truck in many jurisdictions is the presence of a winch, which is used to either extract disabled or immobilized vehicles, or to load them onto flatbed/tilt and load type tow trucks. These may be electrically or hydraulically powered from a power take-off, and is wound with a wire cable and equipped with a hook. Snatch blocks may be used to change direction or increase the pulling power and a variety of specialized hooks may be attached to the main hook, including hooks which attach to specific parts of the car. J-hooks, which look somewhat like blunt meat hooks are used to hook around axles. Mini-J hooks can be used if there is a tow loop provided, and R and T hooks are designed to hook into slots cut by the manufacturer in the underside of the frame on many cars. Axle straps may also be used, when there are few other places to attach.

===Off-road vehicles===
Off-road vehicles may be equipped with recovery tools such as winches on the front and back bumpers, usually mounted to a winch bar or frame mounted metal bumper. Less commonly it is mounted on a specialised metal plate &quot;hidden winch mount&quot; behind the vehicle&#x27;s stock bumper, this is referred to as a &quot;hidden winch&quot; as the hook and fairlead hides behind a flip-up front number plate, the winch itself is not visible. The snubbing winch is used to pull vehicles out of mud, snow, sand, rocks, and water, and to pull vehicles through or over obstacles. The winch is made of cable made up of a braided synthetic rope, or a steel cable wrapped around a motorized drum. Each is controlled electronically, allowing the operator to control the winch speed. Modern vehicles typically use electric winches running off the car&#x27;s 12V starter or 24V secondary battery. The winch is either controlled with a detachable cable, a button inside the car or wireless remote. Older vehicles may have a PTO winch, controlled via the car&#x27;s transmission, a secondary clutch maybe used so the vehicle does not need to be moving while winching. Some winches are powered by the pressure generated in the hydraulic steering system. The high lift jack or come-along is used for manual winching.

===Aircraft use===
Gliders are often launched using a winch mounted on a trailer or heavy vehicle. This method is widely used at many European gliding clubs, as an inexpensive alternative to aerotowing. The engine is usually a gas/petrol, LPG or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in of high-tensile steel wire or a synthetic fibre cable, attached at the other end to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about after a short, steep climb.

Search and Rescue helicopters are often equipped with winches to avoid having to get the helicopter dangerously close to obstacles, or into ocean troughs, allowing rescue teams to be lowered and evacuees to be extricated while the helicopter hovers overhead. Helicopter winches are also used for heli-logging and for airlifting oversized cargo, such as vehicles and other aircraft, although the winch in these cases is only used to reduce the hazards to flying with a loose cable hanging below the helicopter.

Stationary balloons, such as the barrage balloons used during the Second World War to discourage marauding aircraft, and the Kite balloons used during the First World War for artillery spotting are usually tethered with a winch, which can be used to lower the balloon, either to relocate it, or to bring it down quickly to prevent it being shot down by enemy aircraft. Larger man carrying kites often used winches to raise and lower them.

Towed gunnery targets, used to train anti-aircraft gunners, and both fighter pilots and aircraft gunners, are run out behind the target tug aircraft for practice, and winched in for take-off and landing.

Before advances were made in antennas in the 1950s, radio aerials were quite long, and needed to be winched out for use, and winched back in for landing. Failure to do so would then damage the aerial, as happened to Amelia Earhart on one of the legs of her last flight.

===Theatre===
Winches are frequently used as elements of backstage mechanics to move scenery in large theatrical productions. They are often embedded in the stage floor and used to move large set pieces on and off.

===Wakeskate winch===

Wakeskate winching is a sport where a person on a waterski or snowboard is propelled across the water with a winch. The winch consists of a gas-powered engine, spool, rope, frame, and sometimes a simple transmission. The person being towed walks (or swims) away from the winch, while extending the rope. When the winch is engaged, it pulls the boarder in at a speed ranging from . The winch may be mounted to a vehicle, set into the ground by stakes, or tied to a tree. The cable may also be run through pulleys mounted offshore so that it pulls the person away from where the winch is located, and multiple pulleys may be used to multiply the force applied by a small but high revving motor instead of using a transmission.

==Winch types==
===Lever winch===

Lever winches are winches that use self-gripping jaws instead of spools to move rope or wire through the winch. Powered by moving a handle back and forth, they allow one person to move objects several tons in weight.

===Snubbing winch===
This is a vertical spool with a ratchet mechanism similar to a conventional winch, but with no crank handle or other form of drive. The line is wrapped around the spool and can be tightened or reeled in by pulling the tail line. The winch takes the load once the pull is stopped with little operator tension needed to hold it. These also allow controlled release of the tension by the operator using the friction of the line around the ratcheted spool. They are used on small sailing boats and dinghies to control sheets and other lines, and in larger applications to supplement and relieve tension on the primary winches.

===Air winch===

An air winch, sometimes known as an air hoist or air tugger, is an air-powered version of a winch. It is commonly used for the lifting and the suspension of materials. In the oil and gas, construction, and maritime industries, air winches are frequently preferred to electric, diesel, and hydraulic winches because of their durability, versatility, and safety.

<text>Gaspare Luigi Pacifico Spontini (14 November 177424 January 1851) was an Italian opera composer and conductor from the classical era. During the first two decades of the 19th century, Spontini was an important figure in French &quot;opera&quot;, and composed over twenty works. 

==Biography==

Born in Maiolati, Papal State (now Maiolati Spontini, Province of Ancona), he spent most of his career in Paris and Berlin, but returned to his place of birth at the end of his life. During the first two decades of the 19th century, Spontini was an important figure in French &quot;opera&quot;. In his more than twenty operas, Spontini strove to adapt Gluck&#x27;s classical &quot;tragédie lyrique&quot; to the contemporary taste for melodrama, for grander spectacle (in &quot;Fernand Cortez&quot; for example), for enriched orchestral timbre, and for melodic invention allied to idiomatic expressiveness of words.

As a youth, Spontini studied at the Conservatorio della Pietà de&#x27; Turchini, one of four active music conservatories of Naples. Working his way from Italian city to city, he got his first break in Rome, with his successful comedy &quot;Li Puntigli delle Donne&quot; (Carnival 1793). In 1803, he went to Paris, where, on 11 February 1804, debuted his comic opera &quot;La Finta Filosofa&quot;, his Neapolitan success of 1799. In part on the recommendation of the comte de Rémusat and his literary countess, a &quot;dame du palais&quot;, Spontini circulated in the Imperial court, was made a member of the Académie Impériale de Musique and gained a court position as &quot;compositeur particulier de la chambre&quot; of the Empress in 1805.

Though Spontini&#x27;s earlier successes were comedies, with the encouragement of Empress Joséphine in 1807, Spontini wrote his greatest success, the &quot;tragédie lyrique&quot; &quot;La Vestale&quot;, which has remained his best-known work. Its premiere at the Opéra in Paris established Spontini as one of the greatest Italian composers of his age. His contemporaries Cherubini, Beethoven, Weber, Rossini, Donizetti and Meyerbeer all considered it a masterpiece, and later composers such as Berlioz, Verdi, and Wagner admired it.

During the Peninsular War, Napoleon promoted works such as Gasparo Spontini&#x27;s &quot;Fernand Cortez&quot; (1809), which concerned the Spanish conquest of Mexico under the reign of Charles V. In 1811, Spontini married Celeste Érard, the niece of the Parisian maker of pianos and harps Sébastien Érard; it was a happy marriage, though childless. He was made a &quot;chevalier&quot; of Napoleon&#x27;s Legion of Honor; its Maltese cross hangs round his neck in the portrait by Nicolas-Eustache Maurin (&quot;illustration&quot;).

Under the changed political climate of the Bourbon Restoration, Spontini, closely identified with the former Empire, saw his opera &quot;Olimpie&quot; (1819, revised 1821, 1826) meet with indifference, leading him to leave Paris for Berlin, where his operas had already achieved success. There he became Kapellmeister and chief conductor at the Königliches Opernhaus, and in this period he composed the Prussian National Anthem &quot;Borussia&quot;. There he also met the young Mendelssohn, but deprecated the 17-year old&#x27;s opera &quot;Die Hochzeit des Camacho&quot;.

In 1842, a disillusioned Spontini, chagrined at the success of Giacomo Meyerbeer and others in Germany, returned to Italy, where he died in 1851.

==Modern revivals==
During the 20th century, Spontini&#x27;s operas were only rarely performed, although several had their first revivals in years. Perhaps the most famous modern production was the revival of &quot;La vestale&quot; with Maria Callas at La Scala at the opening of the 1954 season, to mark the 180th anniversary of the composer&#x27;s birth. The stage director was famed cinema director Luchino Visconti. That production was also the La Scala debut of tenor Franco Corelli. Callas recorded the arias &quot;Tu che invoco&quot; and &quot;O Nume tutelar&quot; from &quot;La vestale&quot; in 1955 (as did Rosa Ponselle in 1926). In 1969, conductor Fernando Previtali revived the opera, with soprano Leyla Gencer and baritone Renato Bruson. (An unofficial recording is in circulation.) In 1993, conductor Riccardo Muti recorded it in the original French language with Karen Huffstodt, Denyce Graves, Anthony Michaels-Moore and Dimitri Kavrakos.

Other revivals of Spontini include &quot;Agnes von Hohenstaufen&quot; in Italian as &quot;Agnese di Hohenstaufen&quot; at the Maggio Musicale festival in Florence in 1954, starring Franco Corelli and conducted by Vittorio Gui, and in Rome in 1970, with Montserrat Caballé and Antonietta Stella, conducted by Riccardo Muti, both recorded live. &quot;Fernand Cortez&quot; was revived in 1951, with a young Renata Tebaldi, at the San Carlo in Naples, conducted by Gabriele Santini. The premiere of the integral version of the work took place at the Erfurt (Germany) opera house (2006, Jean-Paul Penin, conductor).

<doc id="261545" wikidata="Q543639" url="?curid=261545" title="Saarburg">
<text>Saarburg (, ) is a city of the Trier-Saarburg district, in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, on the banks of the river Saar in the hilly country a few kilometers upstream from the Saar&#x27;s junction with the Moselle. Now known as a tourist attraction, the river Leuk flows into the town centre and makes a spectacular drop of some 60 feet before joining the larger Saar that bisects the town. The waterfall is the result of a 13th-century project to redirect the Leuk through the city centre.

Saarburg is the seat of the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; (&quot;collective municipality&quot;) Saarburg-Kell. The area around Saarburg is noted for the cultivation of Riesling grapes.

==History==

The history of the city begins with the construction of the now-ruined castle by Graf Siegfried of Luxembourg in 964. It received its town charter in 1291. The city has a bell foundry, the Glockengießerei Mabilion, which has been in operation since the 1770s, and the only one in Germany that produces bronze bells.

From 1945 to 1948 Saarburg was occupied by troops from Luxembourg. From 18 July 1946 to 6 June 1947 Onsdorf, in its then municipal boundary, formed part of the Saar Protectorate. French troops complemented the occupation until 1955.

Saarburg has a proud history with bells, being the producers of bells for many German cathedrals.

<doc id="261546" wikidata="Q545464" url="?curid=261546" title="Billy Eckstine">
<text>William Clarence Eckstine (July 8, 1914 – March 8, 1993) was an American jazz and pop singer and a bandleader during the swing and bebop eras. He was noted for his rich, almost operatic bass-baritone voice. In 2019, Eckstine was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award &quot;for performers who, during their lifetimes, have made creative contributions of outstanding artistic significance to the field of recording&quot;. His recording of &quot;I Apologize&quot; (MGM, 1951) was given the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as an &quot;influential band leader&quot; whose &quot;suave bass-baritone&quot; and &quot;full-throated, sugary approach to popular songs inspired singers such as Earl Coleman, Johnny Hartman, Joe Williams, Arthur Prysock, and Lou Rawls.&quot;

==Early life and education==

Eckstine was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, the son of William Eckstein, a chauffeur, and Charlotte Eckstein, a seamstress. Eckstine&#x27;s paternal grandparents were William F. Eckstein and Nannie Eckstein, a mixed-race, married couple who lived in Washington, D.C.; both were born in 1863. William was born in Prussia (now Germany), and Nannie in Virginia. Billy&#x27;s sister, Maxine, was a high school teacher.

Eckstine attended Peabody High School in Pittsburgh. Other notables who were educated there include the artist Romare Bearden, Gene Kelly, pianist Dodo Marmarosa and Lorin Maazel. During this time, Eckstine moved to Washington, D.C., attending Armstrong High School (where his sister taught), St. Paul Normal and Industrial School, and Howard University. In 1933, aged 19, he left Howard to start a music career, after winning first place and $10 in an amateur talent contest at Washington&#x27;s Howard Theatre, where he imitated Cab Calloway singing a nursery rhyme with interpolated scatting.

==Career==
Heading to Chicago, Illinois, Eckstine joined Earl Hines&#x27; Grand Terrace Orchestra in 1939, staying with the band as vocalist and trumpeter until 1943. By that time, Eckstine had begun to make a name for himself through the Hines band&#x27;s juke-box hits, such as &quot;Stormy Monday Blues&quot;, and his own &quot;Jelly, Jelly&quot;.

In 1944, Eckstine formed his own big band, and it became the finishing school for adventurous young musicians who would shape the future of jazz including Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Dexter Gordon, Gene Ammons, Miles Davis, Art Blakey, Cecil Payne, Fats Navarro, Lucky Thompson, John Malachi, Sarah Vaughan, Pearl Bailey, and Lena Horne. Tadd Dameron, Gil Fuller and Jerry Valentine were among the band&#x27;s arrangers. The Billy Eckstine Orchestra is considered to be the first bebop big-band, and had Top Ten chart entries that included &quot;A Cottage for Sale&quot; and &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot;. Both were awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.

Dizzy Gillespie, in reflecting on the band in his 1979 autobiography &quot;To Be or Not to Bop&quot;, gives this perspective: &quot;There was no band that sounded like Billy Eckstine&#x27;s. Our attack was strong, and we were playing bebop, the modern style. No other band like this one existed in the world.&quot; In 1946 Eckstine starred as the hero in the musical film &quot;Rhythm in a Riff&quot;, which also starred Ann Baker and Lucky Millinder.

Eckstine became a solo performer in 1947, with records featuring lush, sophisticated orchestrations. Even before folding his band, Eckstine had recorded solo to support it, scoring two million-sellers in 1945 with &quot;Cottage for Sale&quot; and a revival of &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot;. Far more successful than his band recordings, these prefigured Eckstine&#x27;s future career. Eckstine would go on to record over a dozen hits during the late 1940s. He signed with the newly established MGM Records, and had immediate hits with revivals of &quot;Everything I Have Is Yours&quot; (1947), Rodgers and Hart&#x27;s &quot;Blue Moon&quot; (1948), and Juan Tizol&#x27;s &quot;Caravan&quot; (1949).

Eckstine had further success in 1950 with Victor Young&#x27;s theme song to &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot;, and the next year with a revival of the 1931 Bing Crosby hit, &quot;I Apologize&quot;.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, his 1950 appearance at the Paramount Theatre in New York City drew a larger audience than Frank Sinatra had done at his performance there. He was even called &quot;the sepia Sinatra&quot; for his rivalry of the country&#x27;s most popular vocalist.

Eckstine was the subject of a three-page profile in the April 24, 1950 issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine, in which the photographer Martha Holmes accompanied Eckstine and his entourage during a week in New York City. One photograph taken by Holmes and published in &quot;Life&quot; showed Eckstine with a group of white female admirers, one of whom had her hand on his shoulder and her head on his chest while she was laughing. Eckstine&#x27;s biographer, Cary Ginell, wrote of the image that Holmes &quot;...captured a moment of shared exuberance, joy, and affection, unblemished by racial tension&quot;. Holmes would later describe the photograph as the favorite of the many she had taken in her career, because it &quot;...told just what the world should be like&quot;. The photograph was considered so controversial that an editor at &quot;Life&quot; sought personal approval from Henry Luce, the magazine&#x27;s publisher, who said it should be published. The publication of the image caused letters of protest to be written to the magazine, and singer Harry Belafonte subsequently said of the publication that &quot;When that photo hit, in this national publication, it was if a barrier had been broken&quot;. The controversy that resulted from the photograph had a severe effect on the trajectory of Eckstine&#x27;s career. Tony Bennett would recall that &quot;It changed everything...Before that, he had a tremendous following...and it just offended the white community&quot;, a sentiment shared by pianist Billy Taylor who said that the &quot;coverage and that picture just slammed the door shut for him&quot;.

In 1951, Eckstine performed at the seventh Cavalcade of Jazz concert held on July 8 at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. Also featured were Lionel Hampton and his Revue, Percy Mayfield, Jimmy Witherspoon, Joe Liggins and The Honeydrippers and Roy Brown.

Among Eckstine&#x27;s recordings of the 1950s was a 1957 duet with Sarah Vaughan, &quot;Passing Strangers&quot;, a minor hit for them in 1957, but an initial No. 22 success in the UK Singles Chart.

The 1960 Las Vegas live album, &quot;No Cover, No Minimum&quot;, featured Eckstine taking a few trumpet solos and showcasing his nightclub act. He recorded albums for Mercury and Roulette in the early 1960s and appeared on Motown albums during the mid to late years of the decade. After recording sparingly during the 1970s for Al Bell&#x27;s Stax/Enterprise imprint, the international touring Eckstine made his last recording, the Grammy-nominated &quot;Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter&quot; in 1986.

Eckstine made numerous appearances on television variety shows, including on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Nat King Cole Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Steve Allen, Jack Paar, and Johnny Carson, &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, &quot;The Art Linkletter Show&quot;, &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;, &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot;, and &quot;Playboy After Dark&quot;. He also performed as an actor in the television sitcom &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, and in such films as &quot;Skirts Ahoy&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot;, and &quot;Jo Jo Dancer&quot;. He performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; prior to Game 4 of the 1979 World Series at Three Rivers Stadium in his native Pittsburgh.

Culturally, Eckstine was a fashion icon. He was famous for his &quot;Mr. B. Collar&quot; – a high roll collar that formed a &quot;B&quot; over a Windsor-knotted tie (or without a tie at all). The collars were worn by many a hipster in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

In 1984, Eckstine recorded his penultimate album, &quot;I Am a Singer&quot;, arranged and conducted by Angelo DiPippo and featuring Toots Thielemans on harmonica. In November 1986, Eckstine recorded with saxophonist Benny Carter for his 1987 album &quot;Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter&quot;. Eckstine made his final recordings for Motorcity Records, a label for ex-Motown artists founded by Ian Levine.

==Personal life==
He married his first wife June in 1942. After their divorce in 1952, he married actress and model Carolle Drake in 1953, and they remained married until his death. He was the father of four children by his second marriage including Ed Eckstine, a president of Mercury Records; Guy Eckstine, a Columbia and Verve Records A&amp;R executive and record producer; international singer Charlotte Eckstine; and singer Gina Eckstine.

==Illness and death==
Eckstine suffered a stroke while performing in Salina, Kansas, in April 1992, and never performed again. Though his speech improved in the hospital, Eckstine had a heart attack and died nearly a year later on March 8, 1993, in Pittsburgh, aged 78. In the weeks leading up to his death, his family members played music for him in his room. His final word was &quot;Basie&quot;.

A State Historical Marker was placed at 5913 Bryant Street in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Highland Park neighborhood to mark the house where Eckstine grew up.
==Tributes==
His friend Duke Ellington recalled Eckstine&#x27;s artistry in his 1973 autobiography &quot;Music is My Mistress&quot;: 
Eckstine-style love songs opened new lines of communication for the man in the man-woman merry-go-round, and blues a la B were the essence of cool. When he made a recording of &quot;Caravan&quot;, I was happy and honored to watch one of our tunes help take him into the stratosphere of universal acclaim. And, of course, he hasn&#x27;t looked back since. A remarkable artist, the sonorous B. ... His style and technique have been extensively copied by some of the neocommercial singers, but despite their efforts, he remains out front to show how and what should have been done.

Sammy Davis Jr. made several live appearances and impersonated Eckstine. Eckstine was a pallbearer at Davis&#x27; funeral in 1990.

And, in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, Quincy Jones stated:
I looked up to Mr. B as an idol. I wanted to dress like him, talk like him, pattern my whole life as a musician and as a complete person in the image of dignity that he projected... As a black man, Eckstine was not immune to the prejudice that characterized the 1950s.

Jones is quoted in Leonard Feather&#x27;s book &quot;The Pleasures of Jazz&quot; as also saying of Eckstine: 
If he&#x27;d been white, the sky would have been the limit. As it was, he didn&#x27;t have his own radio or TV show, much less a movie career. He had to fight the system, so things never quite fell into place.&quot;

Lionel Hampton said: 
He was one of the greatest singers of all time... We were proud of him because he was the first Black popular singer singing popular songs in our race. We, the whole music profession, were so happy to see him achieve what he was doing. He was one of the greatest singers of that era... He was our singer.&quot;

<text>Hoddesdon () is a town in the Borough of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, lying entirely within the London Metropolitan Area and Greater London Urban Area. The area is on the River Lea and the Lee Navigation along with the New River.

Hoddesdon is the second most populated town in Broxbourne with a population of 42,253 according to the United Kingdom&#x27;s 2011 census.

It borders Ware to the north, Nazeing in Essex to the east, and Broxbourne to the south. The Prime Meridian passes just to the east of Hoddesdon. The town is served by Rye House railway station and nearby Broxbourne railway station.

==History==
=== Early history ===
The name &quot;Hoddesdon&quot; is believed to be derived from a Saxon or Danish personal name combined with the Old English suffix &quot;don&quot;, meaning a down or hill. The earliest historical reference to the name is in the Domesday Book within the hundred of Hertford.

Hoddesdon was situated about north of London on the main road to Cambridge and to the north. The road forked in the centre of the town, with the present High Street dividing into Amwell Street and Burford Street, both leading north to Ware. From an early date there were a large number of inns lining the streets to serve the needs of travellers. A market charter was granted to Robert Boxe, lord of the manor, in 1253. By the 14th century the Hospital of St Laud and St Anthony had been established in the south of Hoddesdon. The institution survived the dissolution of the monasteries, but had ceased to exist by the mid 16th century, although it is commemorated in the name of Spital Brook which divides Hoddesdon from Broxbourne.

In 1336 William de la Marche was licensed to build a chapel of ease in the town. The building, known as St Katharine&#x27;s Chapel, was used by pilgrims to the shrine at Walsingham. It survived until the 17th century, when it was demolished. In 1835, a single-storey building, known as Hoddesdon Town Hall, was built on the site: only the clock tower now survives. 
The town was considerably enlarged in the reign of Elizabeth I, and a number of inns in the High Street date from this time. The monarch granted a royal charter in 1559/60, placing the town government under a bailiff, warden and eight assistants. The charter also established a free grammar school based on the site of the former hospital, and this was placed under the care of the corporation. Neither the borough nor the school flourished, however, and both had ceased to exist by the end of the century. In 1567 Sir William Cecil acquired the manor of Hoddesdonsbury and two years later Elizabeth granted him the neighbouring manor of Baas. From that date the Cecils maintained a connection with the town which is recorded by the naming of The Salisbury Arms (anciently the &quot;Black Lion&quot; Inn) : the title Marquess of Salisbury was granted to James Cecil in 1789.

In 1622 Sir Marmaduke Rawdon built Rawdon House, a red-brick mansion which still survives. Rawdon also provided the town with its first public water supply, flowing from a statue known as the &quot;Samaritan Woman&quot;.

In 1683 there was an alleged Whig conspiracy to assassinate or mount an insurrection against Charles II of England because of his pro-Roman Catholic policies. This plot was known as the Rye House Plot, named from Rye House at Hoddesdon, near which ran a narrow road where Charles was supposed to be killed as he travelled from a horse meeting at Newmarket. By chance, according to the official narrative, the king&#x27;s unexpectedly early departure in March foiled the plot. Ten weeks later, on 1 June, an informer&#x27;s allegations prompted a government investigation.

The subsequent history of Rye House has been considerably less dramatic. In 1870 the current owner, William Henry Teale, opened a pleasure garden, displaying the Great Bed of Ware, which he had recently acquired. It was such a popular destination for excursions from London that an extra station was built on the Liverpool Street to Hertford East line to serve it.

By the early 20th century, however, the tourist trade had fallen off, and Rye House was demolished, apart from the Gatehouse; the Great Bed was moved to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum.

Rye House Gatehouse still stands today, and is now a Grade 1 listed building. It is open to the public at weekends and bank holidays during the summer, featuring displays about the Plot and the early history of brick-building. The rest of the grass-covered site has the floor-plan of the house marked out.

A new chapel of ease, dedicated to St Paul, was built in 1732. This was subsequently enlarged, and in 1844 become the parish church when Hoddesdon was created a separate ecclesiastical parish. Previously the town had been divided between the two parishes of Broxbourne and Great Amwell. The boundary between the two parishes ran through an archway in the town&#x27;s High Street. When this building was demolished in the 1960s, a specially inscribed stone was set into the pavement marking the historic boundary.

Brewing was first established in the town in about 1700. In 1803, William Christie established a brewery in the town, and it became a major employer and one of the largest breweries in England. The brewery continued in operation until 1928. Most of the brewery buildings were demolished in 1930, although part was converted into a cinema itself since demolished. Some remnants of the establishment remain in Brewery Road.

By the mid-19th century the town still consisted principally of one street, and had a population of 1,743. Malt was being produced and transported to London via the River Lea. There were also a number of flour mills. Trade in Hoddesdon was centred on the hops market each Thursday. As time went on, more and more hops were carried on the river rather than the roads and the Wednesday meat market took predominance. The Wednesday market has survived and a Friday market was added in the late 20th century.

=== After the Second World War ===
After the Second World War Hoddesdon increasingly became a dormitory town, forming part of the London commuter belt. Much of the town centre was demolished in the 1960s and 1970s, with the construction of the Tower Centre and Fawkon Walk shopping centres. The opening of a bypass in 1974 changed the nature of the town, with through traffic curtailed.

Hoddesdon has a sizeable Italian community. Many Sicilian families emigrated to the Lea Valley in the 1950s and 60s to work in the nearby garden nurseries, and they and many of their descendants still live in the area. Since the 18th century the Lea Valley has had a reputation for fine produce from its market gardens and green houses. The owners and growers of the majority of the Lea Valley&#x27;s cucumber farms come primarily from two villages in Sicily: Cianciana and Mussomeli. The Lee Valley Growers Association estimates that more than 70% of the 100 or so nurseries in the Lea Valley are now owned by Sicilian descendants, producing 75% of UK-grown cucumbers and 50% of its peppers in their glasshouses.

Part of a wave of immigration to the UK after the Second World War, the Italian community has grown to become part of the fabric of the area, with migrants and their descendants still celebrating their rich Italian heritage. The Festival of San Antonio is celebrated in June with a street procession, although nowadays it is a low-key festival since many of the participants are elderly.

In 1951 Hoddesdon was the seemingly unlikely location for the eighth meeting of CIAM (Congrès Internationaux d&#x27;Architecture Moderne), referred to as CIAM 8, which was an international organization of the world&#x27;s most significant architects and town planners of the time. The participants gathered in the High Leigh country house in Hoddesdon to discuss the theme &quot;The Heart of the City&quot;, a response to issues regarding cities badly damaged during World War Two.

=== Recent changes ===
In 2007 Rye House Kart Raceway was taken over by two local family businessmen. It was recently described as the &quot;Silverstone of Karting&quot; by David Coulthard. The Book It Now diary based calendar system was developed here in 2013.

In 2014 JD Wetherspoon&#x27;s first pub in Hoddesdon opened at the former Salisbury Arms on the High Street. During renovations at the renamed Star, a series of important 16th century wall paintings was uncovered. They are located on the north wall of the bar, with some additional detail found on one of the beams supporting the ceiling. The paintings depict half-figures and biblical verses. Roof beams dating to the mid-1400s have also been revealed, suggesting that The Star is older than previously thought.

==Governance==
Hoddesdon has two tiers of local government, at district (borough) and county level: Broxbourne Borough Council and Hertfordshire County Council. There has been no parish or town council for Hoddesdon since 1974.

Hoddesdon was formerly classed as a hamlet within the parish of Broxbourne. A separate ecclesiastical parish of Hoddesdon was created in 1844, but for civil purposes the town continued to straddle Broxbourne and Great Amwell parishes. The hamlet of Hoddesdon had its own overseers of the poor and from 1835 appointed its own guardians to the Ware Poor Law Union. As such, the hamlet of Hoddesdon became a civil parish on 10 August 1866 with the passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1866.

Hoddesdon was included in the Ware Rural Sanitary District from 1872. Under the Local Government Act 1894 rural sanitary districts were converted into rural districts, but before that Act came into force an order was made to convert Hoddesdon into an urban district. A new parish called &quot;Hoddesdon Urban&quot; was created from most of the old Hoddesdon parish and part of Great Amwell, whilst the sparsely populated western part of Hoddesdon became a separate parish called Hoddesdon Rural, which became part of Ware Rural District. Hoddesdon Urban District Council came into being on 31 December 1894.

On 1 April 1935 a County Review Order enlarged the urban district. The neighbouring parishes of Broxbourne, Hoddesdon Rural, and Wormley were all abolished, with most of their territory being absorbed into the parish and urban district of Hoddesdon. Parts of the parishes of Great Amwell and Stanstead Abbotts were transferred into Hoddesdon at the same time. Much of the western boundary of the urban district then coincided with the track of the Roman Ermine Street.

In its early years, Hoddesdon Urban District Council met at the Coffee Tavern Hall on Lord Street. In 1936 the council built itself a new building called Council Offices at the southern end of the High Street. The Council Offices were formally opened on 21 December 1936, and remained the headquarters of the council until its abolition.

Hoddesdon Urban District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, merging with Cheshunt Urban District on 1 April 1974 to become the Borough of Broxbourne. No successor parish was created for the town. The former offices of Hoddesdon Urban District Council were converted to residential use in 1988 and renamed Belvedere Court.

==Education==

* The John Warner School is a community, foundation comprehensive for 11- to 18-year-olds.

In 2016 Sheredes became Robert Barclay Academy, a comprehensive school for 11- to 18-year-olds. John Warner has specialist status in science and sport and Sheredes was well regarded in the arts.

In 2007 the John Warner School received congratulations from Mr Jim Knight, Minister of State for Education for being placed 24th in the &#x27;100 most improved schools in the country&#x27;. This award is a combination of eight years continuous improvement in examination results.

<doc id="261550" wikidata="Q1394451" url="?curid=261550" title="Halyard">
<text>In sailing, a halyard or halliard is a line (rope) that is used to hoist a ladder, sail, flag or yard. The term &quot;halyard&quot; derives from the Middle English &quot;halier&quot; (&quot;rope to haul with&quot;), with the last syllable altered by association with the English unit of measure &quot;yard&quot;. Halyards, like most other parts of the running rigging, were classically made of natural fibre like manila or hemp.

==Sail types==
* A square rig sail with a halyard is mounted on a lifting yard that is free to slide on a short section of the mast. The halyard is used to raise (hail or hal) the yard when setting the sail.
* A gaff rigged sail has two; a throat halyard to lift the end of the gaff nearer the mast, and a peak halyard to lift the outer end.
* A more modern triangular (Bermuda or &quot;Marconi&quot;) sail has only one halyard which is attached at its uppermost point (the &quot;head&quot;).

==Fastenings==
Halyards can be attached a number of ways to the head of a triangular sail. The most common methods are as follows:
# A shackle through a headboard on the sail.
# A bowline through a hole in the head.
# A half hitch with a figure-eight knot, preferred over a bowline because it allows the sail to get closer to the top of the mast.

The other end of the halyard is usually attached to the mast at its foot by way of a cleat. It is convention in some places to fasten the main halyard (for the mainsail) on the starboard side of the mast and the jib halyard to the port side. This allows quicker access to the lines in a time-critical situation.

==Jumping/sweating the halyard==
&quot;Jumping the halyard&quot; is a technique used to raise a large sail quickly by employing a few crew members to work simultaneously on the halyard. The person &quot;jumping&quot; stands next to the mast and manually grabs the halyard as high as they can (sometimes this necessitates jumping) and pulling it down as fast and far as possible. While this crew member reaches for the next heave, a second crew member &#x27;tails&#x27; or takes up the slack created by the jumper, on a winch. When the person jumping can no longer pull up the sail simply by hanging on the halyard, they must &quot;sweat&quot; the line.

To &quot;sweat&quot; the halyard is to take as much slack out of it as possible. This may be done with a winch, or manually. To manually sweat a halyard, the sweater grasps the line and, in a fluid motion, hauls it laterally towards themself, then down toward the deck, letting the &quot;tailer&quot; take up the new slack.

<text>Mean Business is the second and final studio album by The Firm, released by Atlantic Records on 3 February 1986. Repeating the same bluesy formula as on the first album, &quot;The Firm&quot; (1985), &quot;Mean Business&quot; did not achieve the same commercial success.

One of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Live in Peace&quot;, was first recorded on Paul Rodgers&#x27; first solo album in 1983, &quot;Cut Loose&quot;. The versions differ in that Chris Slade played the drums at half tempo compared to the original version, apart from the ending. Paul Rodgers has recently played a new version on his new compilation album Live in Peace.

The album&#x27;s title was intended to have a double meaning: that the music business is a hard one, and that the band was serious about its music (&quot;The Firm mean business&quot;). However, perhaps due to the lukewarm-at-best critical and financial success which the band met, Page and Rodgers decided to disband The Firm within months of this album&#x27;s release.

The album peaked at #22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. and at #46 on the UK Albums Chart. The single &quot;All the King&#x27;s Horses&quot; spent four weeks at the top of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

&quot;Fortune Hunter&quot; was originally co-written by Page and Chris Squire for the aborted XYZ project in 1981. Squire was not credited on The Firm&#x27;s version.

<doc id="261556" wikidata="Q126677" url="?curid=261556" title="Mary Lou Williams">
<text>Mary Lou Williams (born Mary Elfrieda Scruggs; May 8, 1910 – May 28, 1981) was an American jazz pianist, arranger, and composer. She wrote hundreds of compositions and arrangements and recorded more than one hundred records (in 78, 45, and LP versions). Williams wrote and arranged for Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman, and she was friend, mentor, and teacher to Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Tadd Dameron, Bud Powell, and Dizzy Gillespie.

She has been noted for her 1954 conversion to Catholicism, which led to a musical hiatus and a later transformation in the nature of her music. She continued to perform and work as a philanthropist, educator, and youth mentor until her death from bladder cancer in 1981.

==Early years==
The second of eleven children, Williams was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and grew up in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A child prodigy, at the age of two she was able to pick out simple tunes and by the age of three, she was taught piano by her mother. Mary Lou Williams played piano out of necessity at a very young age; her white neighbors were throwing bricks into her house until Williams began playing the piano in their homes. At the age of six, she supported her ten half-brothers and sisters by playing at parties. She began performing publicly at the age of seven when she became known admiringly in Pittsburgh as &quot;The Little Piano Girl&quot;. She became a professional musician at the age of 15, citing Lovie Austin as her greatest influence. She married jazz saxophonist John Overton Williams in November 1926.

==Career==
In 1922, at the age of 12, Williams went on the Orpheum Circuit of theaters. During the following year she played with Duke Ellington and his early small band, the Washingtonians. One morning at three o&#x27;clock, she was playing with McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers at Harlem&#x27;s Rhythm Club. Louis Armstrong entered the room and paused to listen to her.&quot;

In 1927, Williams married saxophonist John Overton Williams. She met him at a performance in Cleveland where he was leading his group, the Syncopators, and moved with him to Memphis, Tennessee. He assembled a band in Memphis, which included Williams on piano. In 1929, 19-year-old Williams assumed leadership of the Memphis band when her husband accepted an invitation to join Andy Kirk&#x27;s band in Oklahoma City. Williams joined her husband in Oklahoma City but did not play with the band. The group, Andy Kirk&#x27;s Twelve Clouds of Joy, moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where Williams, when she wasn&#x27;t working as a musician, was employed transporting bodies for an undertaker. When the Clouds of Joy accepted a longstanding engagement in Kansas City, Missouri, Williams joined her husband and began sitting in with the band, as well as serving as its arranger and composer. She provided Kirk with such songs as &quot;Froggy Bottom&quot;, &quot;Walkin&#x27; and Swingin, &quot;Little Joe from Chicago&quot;, &quot;Roll &#x27;Em&quot;, and &quot;Mary&#x27;s Idea&quot;.

Williams was the arranger and pianist for recordings in Kansas City (1929) Chicago (1930), and New York City (1930). During a trip to Chicago, she recorded &quot;Drag &#x27;Em&quot; and &quot;Night Life&quot; as piano solos. She used the name &quot;Mary Lou&quot; at the suggestion of Jack Kapp at Brunswick Records. The records sold quickly, raising Williams to national prominence. Soon after the recording session she became Kirk&#x27;s permanent second pianist, playing solo gigs and working as a freelance arranger for Earl Hines, Benny Goodman, and Tommy Dorsey. In 1937, she produced &quot;In the Groove&quot; (Brunswick), a collaboration with Dick Wilson, and Benny Goodman asked her to write a blues song for his band. The result was &quot;Roll &#x27;Em&quot;, a boogie-woogie piece based on the blues, which followed her successful &quot;Camel Hop&quot;, named for Goodman&#x27;s radio show sponsor, Camel cigarettes. Goodman tried to put Williams under contract to write for him exclusively, but she refused, preferring to freelance instead.

In 1942, Williams, who had divorced her husband, left the Twelve Clouds of Joy, returning again to Pittsburgh. She was joined there by bandmate Harold &quot;Shorty&quot; Baker, with whom she formed a six-piece ensemble that included Art Blakey on drums. After an engagement in Cleveland, Baker left to join Duke Ellington&#x27;s orchestra. Williams joined the band in New York City, then traveled to Baltimore, where she and Baker were married. She traveled with Ellington and arranged several tunes for him, including &quot;Trumpet No End&quot; (1946), her version of &quot;Blue Skies&quot; by Irving Berlin. She also sold Ellington on performing &quot;Walkin&#x27; and Swingin&#x27;&quot;. Within a year she had left Baker and the group and returned to New York.
Williams accepted a job at the Café Society Downtown, started a weekly radio show called &quot;Mary Lou Williams&#x27;s Piano Workshop&quot; on WNEW and began mentoring and collaborating with younger bebop musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie and Thelonious Monk. In 1945, she composed the bebop hit &quot;In the Land of Oo-Bla-Dee&quot; for Gillespie. &quot;During this period Monk and the kids would come to my apartment every morning around four or pick me up at the Café after I&#x27;d finished my last show, and we&#x27;d play and swap ideas until noon or later&quot;, Williams recalled in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;.

In 1945, Williams composed the classically-influenced &quot;Zodiac Suite&quot;, in which each of the twelve parts corresponded to a sign of the zodiac, and were accordingly dedicated to several of her musical colleagues, including Billie Holiday, and Art Tatum. She recorded the suite with Jack Parker and Al Lucas and performed it December 31, 1945, at The Town Hall in New York City with an orchestra and tenor saxophonist Ben Webster.

In 1952, Williams accepted an offer to perform in England and ended up staying in Europe for two years. By this time, her musical career had left Williams mentally and physically drained.

=== Conversion to Catholicism and hiatus ===
A three-year hiatus from performing began when she suddenly backed away from the piano during a performance in Paris in 1954. She returned to the United States, converting to Catholicism in 1954 alongside Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s wife Lorraine. In addition to spending several hours at Mass, her energies were then devoted mainly to the Bel Canto Foundation, an effort she initiated using her savings as well as help from friends to turn her apartment in Hamilton Heights into a halfway house for the poor as well as musicians who were grappling with addiction; she also made money over a longer period of time for the halfway house by way of a thrift store in Harlem.

Her hiatus may have been triggered by the death of her long-time friend and student Charlie Parker in 1955 who also struggled with addiction for the majority of his life. Father John Crowley and Father Anthony aided in persuading Williams to return to playing music. They told her that she could continue to serve God and the Catholic Church by utilizing her exceptional gift of creating music. Moreover, Gillespie convinced her to return to playing, which she did at the 1957 Newport Jazz Festival with Gillespie&#x27;s band.

Father Peter O&#x27;Brien, a Catholic priest, became her close friend and manager in the 1960s. Gillespie also introduced her to Pittsburgh&#x27;s Bishop John Wright. O&#x27;Brien helped her establish new venues for jazz performance at a time when no more than two clubs in Manhattan offered jazz full-time. In addition to club work, she played at colleges, formed her own record label and publishing companies, founded the Pittsburgh Jazz Festival (with the bishop&#x27;s help), and made television appearances. Bishop Wright let her teach at Seton High School on the city&#x27;s North Side. It was there that she wrote her first Mass, called &quot;The Pittsburgh Mass&quot;. Williams eventually became the first jazz composer commissioned by the church to compose liturgical music in the jazz idiom.

=== Return to music ===
Following her hiatus, Willams&#x27; first piece of music was a Mass she wrote and performed named &quot;Black Christ of the Andes&quot;, based around a hymn in honor of the Peruvian saint Martin de Porres, and two other short works, &quot;Anima Christi&quot; and &quot;Praise the Lord&quot;. It was first performed in November 1962 at St. Francis Xavier Church in Manhattan. She recorded it in October of the next year.

Throughout the 1960s, Williams&#x27; composing concentrated on sacred music, hymns, and Masses. One of the Masses, &quot;Music for Peace,&quot; was choreographed by Alvin Ailey and performed by the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater as &quot;Mary Lou&#x27;s Mass&quot; in 1971&quot;.&quot; About the work, Ailey commented, &quot;If there can be a Bernstein Mass, a Mozart Mass, a Bach Mass, why can&#x27;t there be &quot;Mary Lou&#x27;s Mass&quot;?&quot; Williams performed the revision of &quot;Mary Lou&#x27;s Mass,&quot; her most acclaimed work, on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; in 1971. She also made a guest appearance on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 1975.

Williams put much effort into working with youth choirs to perform her works, including &quot;Mary Lou&#x27;s Mass&quot; at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York City in April 1975 before a gathering of over three thousand. It marked the first time a jazz musician had played at the church. She opened a charitable organization and opened thrift stores in Harlem, directing the proceeds, along with ten percent of her own earnings, to musicians in need. As a 1964 &quot;Time&quot; article explained, &quot;Mary Lou thinks of herself as a &#x27;soul&#x27; player — a way of saying that she never strays far from melody and the blues, but deals sparingly in gospel harmony and rhythm. &#x27;I am praying through my fingers when I play,&#x27; she says. &#x27;I get that good &quot;soul sound&quot;, and I try to touch people&#x27;s spirits.&#x27;&quot; She performed at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1965, with a jazz festival group.

Throughout the 1970s, Williams&#x27; career flourished. She released numerous albums, including as solo pianist and commentator on the recorded &quot;The History of Jazz&quot;. She returned to the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1971. She could also be seen playing nightly in Greenwich Village at The Cookery, a new club run by her former boss from the Café Society, Barney Josephson. That engagement too, was recorded.

Williams had a two-piano performance with avant-garde pianist Cecil Taylor at Carnegie Hall on April 17, 1977. Despite onstage tensions between Williams and Taylor, their performance was released on a live album titled &quot;Embraced&quot;.

Williams instructed school children on jazz. She then accepted an appointment at Duke University as artist-in-residence (from 1977 to 1981), teaching the History of Jazz with Father O&#x27;Brien and directing the Duke Jazz Ensemble. With a light teaching schedule, she also made many concert and festival appearances, conducted clinics with youth, and in 1978 performed at the White House for President Jimmy Carter and his guests. She participated in Benny Goodman&#x27;s 40th-anniversary Carnegie Hall concert in 1978.

==Later years==
Williams&#x27; final recording, &quot;Solo Recital&quot; (Montreux Jazz Festival, 1978), three years before her death, had a medley encompassing spirituals, ragtime, blues and swing. Other highlights include Williams&#x27;s reworkings of &quot;Tea for Two&quot;, &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot;, and her two compositions &quot;Little Joe from Chicago&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;s Your Story Morning Glory&quot;. Other tracks include &quot;Medley: The Lord Is Heavy&quot;, &quot;Old Fashion Blues&quot;, &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, &quot;Offertory Meditation&quot;, &quot;Concerto Alone at Montreux&quot;, and &quot;The Man I Love&quot;.

In 1980, she founded the Mary Lou Williams Foundation.

In 1981, Mary Lou Williams died of bladder cancer in Durham, North Carolina at the age of 71. Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Goodman, and Andy Kirk attended her funeral at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola. She was buried in the Calvary Catholic Cemetery in Pittsburgh. Looking back at the end of her life, Mary Lou Williams said: &quot;I did it, didn&#x27;t I? Through muck and mud.&quot; She was known as &quot;the first lady of the jazz keyboard&quot;. Williams was one of the first women to be successful in jazz.

Her final work for wind symphony, &quot;History...&quot;, reconstructed and recomposed by Duke faculty member Anthony Kelley, was premiered in 2024.

<text>Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta is a disease of the immune system. It is the more severe version of pityriasis lichenoides chronica. The disease is characterized by rashes and small lesions on the skin. The disease is more common in males and usually occurs in young adulthood, although it has been seen in every age group and every race. It is possible for the disease to go into remission for short periods of time or forever.

==Causes==
There is no known cause of this disease; however, there is some evidence associating it with parvovirus B19.

==Diagnosis==
It is commonly misdiagnosed as chickenpox or rosacea, or misidentified as a form of staphylococcal infection. The most accurate way to diagnose it is by biopsy. This disease has not been known to be life-threatening.

==Treatment==
It is not contagious and currently there is no cure for the disease, although the lesions can be treated with phototherapy as well as antibiotics, including erythromycin, azithromycin and tetracycline. Treatment often involves multiple therapies that address the immune system and bacterial, viral, or dermatological causes.

==Eponym==
Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta is also known as Mucha–Habermann disease. It is named for Rudolf Habermann (1884–1941), a German dermatologist, and Viktor Mucha, an Austrian dermatologist.
