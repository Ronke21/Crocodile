<text>Richard Assheton Cross, 1st Viscount Cross, (30 May 1823 – 8 January 1914), known before his elevation to the peerage as R. A. Cross, was a British Conservative politician. He was Home Secretary from 1874 to 1880, and from 1885 to 1886.

==Background and education==
Cross was born in Red Scar, near Preston, Lancashire, the fifth child and third son of William Cross JP (1771–1827), Deputy Prothonotary for the Court of Common Pleas at Lancaster and landed proprietor, and his wife Ellen, daughter of Edward Chaffers. He was educated at Rugby School, matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1842 where he graduated B.A. in 1846, and was the President of the Cambridge Union in 1845. He was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1844, and was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in 1849, attaching himself to the Northern Circuit.

==Political career==

Cross entered Parliament as one of two representatives for Preston in 1857, a seat he held until 1862. 

In 1868 Cross was elected for South West Lancashire, topping the poll and defeating Gladstone, and continued to represent this constituency until 1885. He then briefly represented Newton, until his elevation to the peerage in 1886.

Cross was Home Secretary in Disraeli&#x27;s second government (1874–1880), to which post he had been appointed without first holding junior office. He was again Home Secretary in Lord Salisbury&#x27;s first government (1885–1886). 

In 1886 Cross was raised to the peerage, as Viscount Cross of Broughton-in-Furness in the County Palatine of Lancaster, He was moved over to the India Office (1886–1892), where he oversaw the passage of the Indian Councils Act 1892. He was very briefly Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in Salisbury&#x27;s third government (1895–1902) before being elevated to the sinecure post Lord Privy Seal. In 1898 he chaired the Joint Select Committee on Electrical Energy (Generating Stations and Supply), which recommended granting compulsory purchase powers for the building of power stations. He retired in 1900.

==Business interests==
After the death of his father-in-law Thomas Lyon (the younger) in 1859, Cross was involved in the affairs of Parr&#x27;s Bank, of which Thomas Lyon the elder, uncle of the younger Thomas Lyon, was a founder. He became a partner, and dropped out of Parliament for six years. He was one of the group who changed the bank into a joint stock company in 1865, of which he acted as deputy chairman. He became its chairman in 1870.

In 1884, Cross was elected to the Board of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, and he remained a Director of that company, and of its successor the Great Central Railway (GCR), until his death. During Board meetings, he would occasionally murmur &quot;Where is the money to come from?&quot; In June 1909, when he was senior Director of the GCR, that railway named one of its class 8D express passenger locomotives &quot;The Rt. Hon. Viscount Cross G.C.B., G.C.S.I.&quot; in his honour.

==Family==

Cross married Georgiana, daughter of Thomas Lyon of Appleton Hall, in 1852; they had three daughters and four sons. The eldest son, the Hon. William Cross, represented Liverpool West Derby in Parliament. The second son, Thomas Richard Cross, died young in 1873; Charles Francis Cross, the third son, was a cleric; and John Edward Cross, the fourth son, was a land agent. 

Lady Cross died in January 1907. Lord Cross survived her by seven years and died in January 1914, aged 90. He was succeeded in the viscountcy by his grandson, Richard Assheton Cross, the only son of the Honourable William Cross.

<doc id="467942" wikidata="Q5448996" url="?curid=467942" title="Film at 11">
<text>&quot;Film at 11&quot; or &quot;Pictures at 11&quot; is a US idiom from television news broadcasting, in which viewers are informed that footage of a breaking news story will be screened later that day. The word &quot;film&quot; in the phrase dates back to the early decades of TV news when footage was regularly recorded on film. 11 PM is the traditional time for late evening local news broadcasts in the Eastern and Pacific time zones of the United States, while the late evening news comes at 10 PM in the middle time zones (Mountain and Central).

== History ==
Television news gathering originally involved crews using 16 mm film (or, at lower-budget stations, Super 8 mm film) that would be processed at the station and had to be edited before it could be aired. The time taken for this process meant that film of an early evening event would only be available in time for the late newscast.

The purpose of these &quot;Film at 11&quot; promotions was to attract viewers and increase the program&#x27;s ratings. However, news broadcasts were not counted in ratings during the time 16mm film was used in newsgathering and hence promotions typically took the form of &quot;newsflashes&quot; or &quot;special reports&quot; that conveyed the facts of the story.

The phrase entered popular culture in the 1970s, often describing ordinary or mundane events with an implication that the said events were being overly sensationalized, or as a short-hand expression akin to &quot;tell you later.&quot; The phrase was used in many TV shows and movies from the 1960s through the 1980s, for instance The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977), WKRP in Cincinnati (1978), and Short Circuit (1986).

Whether or not he is to be credited with originating the phrase, in West Coast local news the phrase is commonly attributed to Jerry Dunphy during his time with KABC-TV in Los Angeles.

The phrase became obsolete with the advent of videotape as the medium of choice for news reporting, which made playing back news stories instantaneous.

<doc id="467946" wikidata="Q350044" url="?curid=467946" title="German orthography">
<text>German orthography is the orthography used in writing the German language, which is largely phonemic. However, it shows many instances of spellings that are historic or analogous to other spellings rather than phonemic. The pronunciation of almost every word can be derived from its spelling once the spelling rules are known, but the opposite is not generally the case.

Today, Standard High German orthography is regulated by the (Council for German Orthography), composed of representatives from most German-speaking countries.

== Alphabet ==

The modern German alphabet consists of the twenty-six letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet plus four special letters.

=== Basic alphabet ===

=== Special letters ===
German has four special letters; three are vowels accented with an umlaut sign () and one is derived from a ligature of (long s) and (; called &quot;ess-zed/zee&quot; or &quot;sharp s&quot;). They have their own names separate from the letters they are based on.

* Capital ẞ was declared an official letter of the German alphabet on 29 June 2017. Previously represented as .
* Historically, long s (ſ) was used as well, as in English and many other European languages.

While the Council for German Orthography considers distinct letters, disagreement on how to categorize and count them has led to a dispute over the exact number of letters the German alphabet has, the number ranging between 26 (considering special letters as variants of ) and 30 (counting all special letters separately).

== Use of special letters ==
===Umlaut diacritic usage===

The accented letters are used to indicate the presence of umlauts (fronting of back vowels). Before the introduction of the printing press, frontalization was indicated by placing an after the back vowel to be modified, but German printers developed the space-saving typographical convention of replacing the full with a small version placed above the vowel to be modified. In German Kurrent writing, the superscripted was simplified to two vertical dashes (as the Kurrent consists largely of two short vertical strokes), which have further been reduced to dots in both handwriting and German typesetting. Although the two dots of umlaut look like those in the diaeresis (trema), the two have different origins and functions.

When it is not possible to use the umlauts (for example, when using a restricted character set) the characters should be transcribed as respectively, following the earlier postvocalic- convention; simply using the base vowel (e.g. instead of ) would be wrong and misleading. However, such transcription should be avoided if possible, especially with names. Names often exist in different variants, such as and , and with such transcriptions in use one could not work out the correct spelling of the name.

Automatic back-transcribing is wrong not only for names. Consider, for example, (&quot;the new book&quot;). This should never be changed to , as the second is completely separate from the and does not even belong in the same syllable; () is (the root for &quot;new&quot;) followed by , an inflection. The word does not exist in German.

Furthermore, in northern and western Germany, there are family names and place names in which lengthens the preceding vowel (by acting as a ), as in the former Dutch orthography, such as , which is pronounced with a long , not an . Similar cases are and .

In proper names and ethnonyms, there may also appear a rare and , which are not letters with an umlaut, but a diaeresis, used as in French and English to distinguish what could be a digraph, for example, in , in , in , in and (although Hoëcker added the diaeresis himself), and in . Occasionally, a diaeresis may be used in some well-known names, i.e.: (usually written as ).

Swiss keyboards and typewriters do not allow easy input of uppercase letters with umlauts (nor ) because their positions are taken by the most frequent French diacritics. Uppercase umlauts were dropped because they are less common than lowercase ones (especially in Switzerland). Geographical names in particular are supposed to be written with plus , except . The omission can cause some inconvenience, since the first letter of every noun is capitalized in German.
Unlike in Hungarian, the exact shape of the umlaut diacritics – especially when handwritten – is not important, because they are the only ones in the language (not counting the tittle on and ). They will be understood whether they look like dots (), acute accents () or vertical bars (). A horizontal bar (macron, ), a breve (), a tiny or , a tilde (), and such variations are often used in stylized writing (e.g. logos). However, the breve – or the ring () – was traditionally used in some scripts to distinguish a from an . In rare cases, the was underlined. The breved was common in some Kurrent-derived handwritings; it was mandatory in Sütterlin.

===Sharp s===

 or () represents the “s” sound. The German spelling reform of 1996 somewhat reduced usage of this letter in Germany and Austria. It is not used in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

As derives from a ligature of lowercase letters, it is exclusively used in the middle or at the end of a word. The proper transcription when it cannot be used is ( and in earlier times). This transcription can give rise to ambiguities, albeit rarely; one such case is &quot;in moderation&quot; vs. &quot;en masse&quot;. In all-caps, is replaced by or, optionally, by the uppercase. The uppercase was included in Unicode 5.1 as U+1E9E in 2008. Since 2010 its use is mandatory in official documentation in Germany when writing geographical names in all-caps. The option of using the uppercase in all-caps was officially added to the German orthography in 2017.

Although nowadays substituted correctly only by , the letter actually originates from a distinct ligature: &quot;long s&quot; with &quot;(round) z&quot; (). Some people therefore prefer to substitute by , as it can avoid possible ambiguities (as in the above vs example).

Incorrect use of the letter is a common type of spelling error even among native German writers. The spelling reform of 1996 changed the rules concerning and (no forced replacement of to at word&#x27;s end). This required a change of habits and is often disregarded: some people even incorrectly assumed that the had been abolished completely. However, if the vowel preceding the is long, the correct spelling remains (as in &quot;&quot;). If the vowel is short, it becomes , e.g. &quot;I think that…&quot;. This follows the general rule in German that a long vowel is followed by a single consonant, while a short vowel is followed by a double consonant.

This change towards the so-called Heyse spelling, however, introduced a new sort of spelling error, as the long/short pronunciation differs regionally. It was already mostly abolished in the late 19th century (and finally with the first unified German spelling of 1901) in favor of the Adelung spelling. Besides the long/short pronunciation issue, which can be attributed to dialect speaking (for instance, in the northern parts of Germany is typically pronounced short, i.e. &quot;Spass&quot;, whereas particularly in Bavaria elongated may occur as in which is pronounced &quot;Geschoß&quot; in certain regions), Heyse spelling also introduces reading ambiguities that do not occur with Adelung spelling such as (Adelung: ) vs. (Adelung: ). It is therefore recommended to insert hyphens where required for reading assistance, i.e. vs. .

===Long s===

In the Fraktur typeface and similar scripts, a long s () was used except in syllable endings (cf. Greek sigma) and sometimes it was historically used in antiqua fonts as well; but it went out of general use in the early 1940s along with the Fraktur typeface. An example where this convention would avoid ambiguity is () &quot;guardhouse&quot;, written and () &quot;tube of wax&quot;, written .

==Sorting==
There are three ways to deal with the umlauts in alphabetic sorting.
# Treat them like their base characters, as if the umlaut were not present (DIN 5007-1, section 6.1.1.4.1). This is the preferred method for dictionaries, where umlauted words ( &quot;feet&quot;) should appear near their origin words ( &quot;foot&quot;). In words which are the same except for one having an umlaut and one its base character (e.g. vs. ), the word with the base character gets precedence.
# Decompose them (invisibly) to vowel plus (DIN 5007-2, section 6.1.1.4.2). This is often preferred for personal and geographical names, wherein the characters are used unsystematically, as in German telephone directories ().
# They are treated like extra letters either placed
## after their base letters (Austrian phone books have between and etc.) or
## at the end of the alphabet (as in Swedish or in extended ASCII).
Microsoft Windows in German versions offers the choice between the first two variants in its internationalization settings.

A sort of combination of nos. 1 and 2 also exists, in use in a couple of lexica: The umlaut is sorted with the base character, but an in proper names is sorted with the umlaut if it is actually spoken that way (with the umlaut getting immediate precedence). A possible sequence of names then would be in this order.

 is sorted as though it were . Occasionally it is treated as , but this is generally considered incorrect. Words distinguished only by vs. are rare. The word with gets precedence, and (story of a building; South German pronunciation) would be sorted before &quot;Geschoss&quot; (projectile).

Accents in French loanwords are always ignored in collation.

In rare contexts (e.g. in older indices) (phonetic value equal to English ) and likewise and are treated as single letters, but the vocalic digraphs (historically ), and the historic never are.

===Personal names with special characters===
German names containing umlauts () and/or are spelled in the correct way in the non-machine-readable zone of the passport, but with and/or in the machine-readable zone, e.g. becomes , becomes , and becomes . The transcription mentioned above is generally used for aircraft tickets et cetera, but sometimes (like in US visas) simple vowels are used (). As a result, passport, visa, and aircraft ticket may display different spellings of the same name. The three possible spelling variants of the same name (e.g. ) in different documents sometimes lead to confusion, and the use of two different spellings within the same document may give persons unfamiliar with German orthography the impression that the document is a forgery.

Even before the introduction of the capital , it was recommended to use the minuscule as a capital letter in family names in documents (e.g. , today&#x27;s spelling: ).

German naming law accepts umlauts and/or in family names as a reason for an official name change. Even a spelling change, e.g. from to or from to is regarded as a name change.

==Features of German spelling==

===Capitalization===
A typical feature of German spelling is the general capitalization of nouns and of most nominalized words. In addition, capital letters are used: at the beginning of sentences (may be used after a colon, when the part of a sentence after the colon can be treated as a sentence); in the formal pronoun &#x27;you&#x27; and the determiner &#x27;your&#x27; (optionally in other second-person pronouns in letters); in adjectives at the beginning of proper names (e.g. &#x27;the Pacific Ocean&#x27;); in adjectives with the suffix &#x27;-er&#x27; from geographical names (e.g. ); in adjectives with the suffix &#x27;-sch&#x27; from proper names if written with the apostrophe before the suffix (e.g. &#x27;Ohm&#x27;s law&#x27;, also written ).

===Compound words===
Compound words, including nouns, are usually written together, e.g. ( + ; &#x27;house door&#x27;), ( + ; &#x27;table lamp&#x27;), ( + + ; &#x27;cold water tap/faucet). This can lead to long words: the longest word in regular use, (&#x27;legal protection insurance companies&#x27;), consists of 39 letters. 

====Hyphen in compound words====
Compounds involving letters, abbreviations, or numbers (written in figures, even with added suffixes) are hyphenated: &#x27;A major&#x27;, &#x27;US embassy&#x27;, &#x27;with 10 percent&#x27;, &#x27;group of ten&#x27;. The hyphen is used when adding suffixes to letters: &#x27;nth&#x27;. It is used in substantivated compounds such as 
 &#x27;alternative&#x27; (literally &#x27;either-or&#x27;); in phrase-word compounds such as &#x27;equinox&#x27;, &#x27;postponing&#x27; (substantivation of &#x27;to postpone&#x27;); in compounds of words containing hyphen with other words: &#x27;A major scale&#x27;; in coordinated adjectives: &#x27;German-English dictionary&#x27;. Compound adjectives meaning colours are written with a hyphen if they mean two colours: &#x27;red and brown&#x27;, but without a hyphen if they mean an intermediate colour: &#x27;reddish brown&#x27; (from the spelling reform of 1996 to the 2024 revision of the orthographic rules, both variants could be used in both meanings). Optionally the hyphen can be used to emphasize individual components, to clarify the meaning of complicated compounds, to avoid misunderstandings or when three identical letters occur together (in practice, in this case it is mostly used when writing nouns with triple vowels, e.g. &#x27;elephant seal&#x27;).

The hyphen is used in compounds where the second part or both parts are proper names, e.g. &#x27;the photographer Hansen&#x27;, &#x27;Lüdenscheid, the city of millers&#x27;, double-barrelled surnames such as ; geographical names such as . Double given names are variously written as . Some compound geographical names are written as one word (e.g. &#x27;North Korea&#x27;) or as two words (e.g. geographical names beginning with or ). The hyphen is not used when compounds with a proper name in the second part are used as common nouns, e.g. &#x27;crybaby&#x27;; also in the name of the fountain . The hyphen is used in words derived from proper names with hyphen, from proper names of more than one word, or from more than one proper name (optional in derivations with the suffix from geographical names from more than one word). Optionally the hyphen can be used in compounds where the first part is a proper name. Compounds of the type &quot;geographical name+specification&quot; are written with a hyphen or as two words: or .

===Vowel length===
Even though vowel length is phonemic in German, it is not consistently represented. However, there are different ways of identifying long vowels:

*A vowel in an open syllable (a free vowel) is long, for instance in (&#x27;to give&#x27;), (&#x27;to say&#x27;). The rule is unreliable in given names, cf. .
*It is rare to see a bare used to indicate a long vowel . It occurs mainly in loanwords, e.g. &#x27;crisis&#x27;, but also in some native German words, e.g. &#x27;we&#x27;, &#x27;give (imperative)&#x27;. Mostly, the long vowel is represented in writing by the digraph , for instance in (&#x27;love&#x27;), (&#x27;here&#x27;). This use is a historical spelling based on the Middle High German diphthong which was monophthongized in Early New High German. It has been generalized to words that etymologically never had that diphthong, for instance (&#x27;much&#x27;), (&#x27;peace&#x27;) (Middle High German , ). Occasionally – typically in word-final position – this digraph represents as in the plural noun (&#x27;knees&#x27;) (cf. singular ). In the words (&quot;viertel&quot;) (&#x27;quarter&#x27;), (&#x27;fourteen&#x27;), (&#x27;forty&#x27;), represents a short vowel, cf. (&#x27;four&#x27;). In Fraktur, where capital and are identical or near-identical formula_1, the combinations &quot;Ie&quot; and &quot;Je&quot; are confusable; hence is not used at the start of a word, for example (&#x27;hedgehog&#x27;), (&#x27;Irishman&#x27;).
*A silent indicates the vowel length in certain cases. That derives from an old in some words, for instance (&#x27;to see&#x27;) (&#x27;ten&#x27;), but in other words it has no etymological justification, for instance (&#x27;to go&#x27;) or (&#x27;to mill&#x27;). Occasionally a digraph can be redundantly followed by , either due to analogy, such as (&#x27;sees&#x27;, from ) or etymology, such as (&#x27;cattle&#x27;, MHG ), (&#x27;rough&#x27;, pre-1996 spelling, now written , MHG ).
*The letters are doubled in a few words that have long vowels, for instance (&#x27;seed&#x27;), (&#x27;sea&#x27;/&#x27;lake&#x27;), (&#x27;moor&#x27;).
*A doubled consonant after a vowel indicates that the vowel is short, while a single consonant often indicates the vowel is long, e.g. (&#x27;comb&#x27;) has a short vowel , while (&#x27;came&#x27;) has a long vowel . Two consonants are not doubled: , which is replaced by (until the spelling reform of 1996, however, was divided across a line break as ), and , which is replaced by . In loanwords, (which may correspond with in the original spelling) and can occur.
*For &quot;different&quot; consonants and for sounds represented by more than one letter ( and ) after a vowel, no clear rule can be given, because they can appear after long vowels, yet are not redoubled if belonging to the same stem, e.g. &#x27;moon&#x27;, &#x27;hand&#x27;. On a stem boundary, reduplication usually takes place, e.g., &#x27;takes&#x27;; however, in fixed, no longer productive derivatives, this too can be lost, e.g., &#x27;business&#x27; despite &#x27;to get something done&#x27;.
* indicates that the preceding vowel is long, e.g. &#x27;street&#x27; vs. a short vowel in &#x27;mass&#x27; or &#x27;host&#x27;/&#x27;lot&#x27;. In addition to that, texts written before the 1996 spelling reform also use at the ends of words and before consonants, e.g. &#x27;wet&#x27; and &#x27;had to&#x27; (after the reform spelled and ), so vowel length in these positions could not be detected by the , cf. &#x27;measure&#x27; and &#x27;was based&#x27; (both unaffected by the reform).

===Double or triple consonants===
Even though German does not have phonemic consonant length, there are many instances of doubled or even tripled consonants in the spelling. A single consonant following a checked vowel is doubled if another vowel follows, for instance &#x27;always&#x27;, &#x27;let&#x27;. These consonants are analyzed as ambisyllabic because they constitute not only the syllable onset of the second syllable but also the syllable coda of the first syllable, which must not be empty because the syllable nucleus is a checked vowel.

By analogy, if a word has one form with a doubled consonant, all forms of that word are written with a doubled consonant, even if they do not fulfill the conditions for consonant doubling; for instance, &#x27;to run&#x27; → &#x27;he runs&#x27;; &#x27;kisses&#x27; → &#x27;kiss&#x27;.

Doubled consonants can occur in composite words when the first part ends in the same consonant the second part starts with, e.g. in the word (&#x27;sheepskin&#x27;, composed of &#x27;sheep&#x27; and &#x27;skin, fur, pelt&#x27;).

Composite words can also have tripled letters. While this is usually a sign that the consonant is actually spoken long, it does not affect the pronunciation per se: the in (&#x27;oxygen bottle&#x27;, composed of &#x27;oxygen&#x27; and &#x27;bottle&#x27;) is exactly as long as the ff in . According to the spelling before 1996, the three consonants would be shortened before vowels, but retained before consonants and in hyphenation, so the word (&#x27;navigation, shipping&#x27;, composed of &#x27;ship&#x27; and &#x27;drive, trip, tour&#x27;) was then written , whereas already had a triple . With the aforementioned change in spelling, even a new source of triple consonants , which in pre-1996 spelling could not occur as it was rendered , was introduced, e.g. (&#x27;compulsory round&#x27; in certain card games, composed of &#x27;must&#x27; and &#x27;game&#x27;).

===Typical letters===
* : This digraph represents the diphthong . The spelling goes back to the Middle High German pronunciation of that diphthong, which was . The spelling is found in only a very few native words (such as &#x27;string&#x27;, &#x27;orphan&#x27;) but is commonly used to romanize in foreign loans from languages such as Chinese.
* : This digraph represents the diphthong , which goes back to the Middle High German monophthong represented by . When the sound is created by umlaut of (from MHG ), it is spelled .
* : This letter alternates with . For more information, see above.
* : At the beginning of a word or syllable, these digraphs are pronounced . In the Middle Ages, the sibilant that was inherited from Proto-Germanic was pronounced as an alveolo-palatal consonant or unlike the voiceless alveolar sibilant that had developed in the High German consonant shift. In the Late Middle Ages, certain instances of merged with , but others developed into . The change to was represented in certain spellings such as &#x27;snow&#x27;, &#x27;cherry&#x27; (Middle High German , ). The digraphs , however, remained unaltered.
* : The letter occurs only in a few native words and then, it represents . That goes back to the 12th and 13th century, when prevocalic was voiced to . The voicing was lost again in the late Middle Ages, but the still remains in certain words such as in (cf. Scandinavian fugl&quot; or English fowl&quot;) &#x27;bird&#x27; (hence, is sometimes called ), &#x27;much&#x27;. For further information, see Pronunciation of v in German.
* : The letter represents the sound . In the 17th century, the former sound became , but the spelling remained the same. An analogous sound change had happened in late-antique Latin.
* : The letter represents the sound . The sound, a product of the High German consonant shift, has been written with since Old High German in the 8th century.

===Foreign words===
For technical terms, the foreign spelling is often retained such as or in the word (physics) of Greek origin. For some common affixes however, like or , it is allowed to use or instead. Both and are correct, but the mixed variants or are not.

For other foreign words, both the foreign spelling and a revised German spelling are correct such as / or / , though in the latter case the revised one does not usually occur.

For some words for which the Germanized form was common even before the reform of 1996, the foreign version is no longer allowed. A notable example is the word &quot;photograph&quot;, which may no longer be spelled as . Other examples are (telephone) which was already Germanized as some decades ago or (office) which got replaced by the Germanized version even earlier.

Except for the common sequences (), ( or ) and (), the letter appears only in loanwords or in proper nouns. In many loanwords, including most words of Latin origin, the letter pronounced () has been replaced by . Alternatively, German words which come from Latin words with before are usually pronounced with () and spelled with . However, certain older spellings occasionally remain, mostly for decorative reasons, such as instead of .

The letter in German appears only in the sequence () except for loanwords such as or (the latter is also written ).

The letter (, ) occurs almost exclusively in loanwords such as (xylophone) and names, e.g. and . Native German words now pronounced with a sound are usually written using or , as with (fox). Some exceptions occur such as (witch), (mermaid), (axe) and .

The letter (, ) occurs almost exclusively in loanwords, especially words of Greek origin, but some such words (such as ) have become so common that they are no longer perceived as foreign. It used to be more common in earlier centuries, and traces of this earlier usage persist in proper names. It is used either as an alternative letter for , for instance in / (a common family name that occurs also in the spellings / ), or especially in the Southwest, as a representation of that goes back to an old IJ (digraph), for instance in or (an Alemannic variant of the name ). Another notable exception is (&quot;Bavaria&quot;) and derived words like (&quot;Bavarian&quot;); this actually used to be spelt with an until the King of Bavaria introduced the as a sign of his philhellenism (his son would become King of Greece later).

The Latin and Ancient Greek diphthongs and are normally rendered as and in German, whereas English usually uses a simple (but see List of English words that may be spelled with a ligature): &#x27;present tense&#x27; (Latin ), &#x27;federation&#x27; (Latin ).

The etymological spelling for the sounds before vowels is used in many words of Latin origin, mostly ending in , but also , etc. Latin in feminine nouns is typically simplified to in German; in related words, both and are allowed: &#x27;power&#x27; (from Latin ), &#x27;potential&#x27; (noun), &#x27;potential&#x27; (adj.). Latin in neuter plural nouns may be retained, but is also Germanized orthographically and morphologically to : &#x27;ingredient&#x27;, plural ; &#x27;expectorant&#x27;, plural or .

In loan words from the French language, spelling and accents are usually preserved. For instance, &quot;café&quot; in the sense of &quot;coffeehouse&quot; is always written in German; accentless &quot;Cafe&quot; would be considered erroneous, and the word cannot be written , which means &quot;coffee&quot;. ( is normally pronounced ; is mostly pronounced in Germany but in Austria.) Thus, German typewriters and computer keyboards offer two dead keys: one for the acute and grave accents and one for circumflex. Other letters occur less often such as in loan words from French or Portuguese, and in loan words from Spanish.

A number of loanwords from French are spelled in a partially adapted way: (quarantine), (communiqué), (overture) from French . In Switzerland, where French is one of the official languages, people are less prone to use adapted and especially partially adapted spellings of loanwords from French and more often use original spellings, e.g. .

In one curious instance, the word (&#x27;ski&#x27;) is pronounced as if it were all over the German-speaking areas (reflecting its pronunciation in its source language Norwegian), but only written that way in Austria.

==Grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences==
This section lists German letters and letter combinations, and how to pronounce them transliterated into the International Phonetic Alphabet. This is the pronunciation of Standard German. Note that the pronunciation of standard German varies slightly from region to region. In fact, it is possible to tell where most German speakers come from by their accent in standard German (not to be confused with the different German dialects).

Foreign words are usually pronounced approximately as they are in the original language.

===Consonants===
Double consonants are pronounced as single consonants, except in compound words.
===Vowels===


====Short vowels====
Consonants are often doubled in writing to indicate the preceding vowel is to be pronounced as a short vowel, mostly when the vowel is stressed. Only consonants written by single letters can be doubled; compare to , not *. Hence, short and long vowels before the digraph are not distinguished in writing: , .

Most one-syllable words that end in a single consonant are pronounced with long vowels, but there are some exceptions such as , and . The suffixes -, - and the word endings -, -, -, - contain short unstressed vowels, but duplicate the final consonants in the plurals: — , — .

*: as in 
*: as in 
*: as in ;
* : as in 
* : only in the words 
* : as in 
* : as in 
* : as in 
* : as in 
* : as in 

====Unstressed short vowels====
The in the ending - is often silent, as in . The ending - is often pronounced , but in some regions, people say or . The in the endings - (, e.g. , ) and - ( in the dative case of adjectives, e.g. from ) is pronounced as a schwa (after which consonant letters are usually not doubled) or is mute altogether.

* : as in or mute, making the following sound syllabic as in ;
* or , as in , in and derivatives

====Long vowels====
A vowel usually represents a long sound if the vowel in question occurs:
* as the final letter (except for )
* in any stressed open syllable as in &quot;car&quot;
* followed by a single consonant as in &quot;offered&quot;
* doubled as in &quot;boat&quot;
* followed by an as in &quot;pain&quot;

Long vowels are generally pronounced with greater tenseness than short vowels.

The long vowels map as follows:
* : as in &quot;Bahn&quot; &#x27;railway&#x27;
* : or as in &quot;regelmäßig&quot; &#x27;regularly&#x27;
* : as in &quot;Meer&quot; &#x27;sea&#x27;
* : as in &quot;wir&quot; &#x27;we&#x27;
* : as in &quot;riesig&quot; &#x27;huge&#x27;
* : as in &quot;Sohn&quot; &#x27;son&#x27;
* : as in &quot;Österreich&quot; &#x27;Austria&#x27;
* : as in &quot;Kuh&quot; &#x27;cow&#x27;
* : as in &quot;über&quot; &#x27;above/about&#x27;
* : as in &quot;psychisch&quot; &#x27;psychological&#x27;

====Diphthongs====
*: as in &#x27;loud&#x27;
*: as in &#x27;Germany&#x27;
*: as in &#x27;side&#x27;

====Shortened long vowels====
A pre-stress long vowel shortens, mostly in the unstressed position:
*: 
*: 
*: 

A vowel bearing secondary stress may also shorten, as in . Phonemically, they are typically analyzed as allophones of the long (thus etc.) and are mostly restricted to loanwords.

====Unusual spellings in proper names====
In some German proper names, unusual spellings occur, e. g. : &quot;Duisburg&quot; ;
 : &quot;Treptow&quot; .

==Punctuation==
The period (full stop) is used at the end of sentences, for abbreviations, and for ordinal numbers, such as for (the first). It is omitted before a full stop at the end of a sentence.

The comma is used between for enumerations (but the serial comma is not used), before adversative conjunctions, after vocative phrases, for clarifying words such as appositions, before and after infinitive and participle constructions, and between clauses in a sentence. A comma may link two independent clauses without a conjunction. The comma is not used before the direct speech; in this case, the colon is used. Using the comma in infinitive phrases was optional before 2024, when the revision of the orthographic rules made it mandatory.

The exclamation mark and the question mark are used for exclamative and interrogative sentences. The exclamation mark may be used for addressing people in letters.

The semicolon is used for divisions of a sentence greater than that with the comma.

The colon is used before direct speech and quotes, after a generalizing word before enumerations (but not when the words are inserted), before explanations and generalizations, and after words in questionnaires, timetables, etc. (e.g. ).

The em dash is used for marking a sharp transition from one thought to another one, between remarks of a dialogue (as a quotation dash), between keywords in a review, between commands, for contrasting, for marking unexpected changes, for marking an unfinished direct speech, and sometimes instead of parentheses in parenthetical constructions.

The ellipsis is used for unfinished thoughts and incomplete citations.

The parentheses are used for parenthetical information.

The square brackets are used instead of parentheses inside parentheses and for editor&#x27;s words inside quotations.

The quotation marks are written as »…« or „…“. They are used for direct speech, quotes, names of books, periodicals, films, etc., and for words in unusual meaning. Quotation inside a quotation is written in single quotation marks: ›…‹ or ‚…‘. If a quotation is followed by a period or a comma, it is placed outside the quotation marks.

The apostrophe is used for contracted forms (such as for ) except forms with omitted final (was sometimes used in this case in the past) and preposition+article contractions. It is also used for genitive of proper names ending in , but not if preceded by the definite article.

==History of German orthography==

===Middle Ages===
The oldest known German texts date back to the 8th century. They were written mainly in monasteries in different local dialects of Old High German. In these texts, along with combinations such as was chosen to transcribe the sounds and , which is ultimately the origin of the modern German letters and (an old ligature). After the Carolingian Renaissance, however, during the reigns of the Ottonian and Salian dynasties in the 10th century and 11th century, German was rarely written, the literary language being almost exclusively Latin.

Notker the German is a notable exception in his period: not only are his German compositions of high stylistic value, but his orthography is also the first to follow a strictly coherent system.

Significant production of German texts only resumed during the reign of the Hohenstaufen dynasty (in the High Middle Ages). Around the year 1200, there was a tendency towards a standardized Middle High German language and spelling for the first time, based on the Franconian-Swabian language of the Hohenstaufen court. However, that language was used only in the epic poetry and minnesang lyric of the knight culture. These early tendencies of standardization ceased in the interregnum after the death of the last Hohenstaufen king in 1254. Certain features of today&#x27;s German orthography still date back to Middle High German: the use of the trigraph for and the occasional use of for because around the 12th and 13th century, the prevocalic was voiced.

In the following centuries, the only variety that showed a marked tendency to be used across regions was the Middle Low German of the Hanseatic League, based on the variety of Lübeck and used in many areas of northern Germany and indeed northern Europe in general.

===Early modern period===
By the 16th century, a new interregional standard developed on the basis of the East Central German and Austro-Bavarian varieties. This was influenced by several factors:

*Under the Habsburg dynasty, there was a strong tendency to a common language in the chancellery.
*Since Eastern Central Germany had been colonized only during the High and Late Middle Ages in the course of the by people from different regions of Germany, the varieties spoken were compromises of different dialects.
*Eastern Central Germany was culturally very important, being home to the universities of Erfurt and Leipzig and especially with the Luther Bible translation, which was considered exemplary.
*The invention of printing led to an increased production of books, and the printers were interested in using a common language to sell their books in an area as wide as possible.

Mid-16th century Counter-Reformation reintroduced Catholicism to Austria and Bavaria, prompting a rejection of the Lutheran language. Instead, a specific southern interregional language was used, based on the language of the Habsburg chancellery.

In northern Germany, the Lutheran East Central German replaced the Low German written language until the mid-17th century. In the early 18th century, the Lutheran standard was also introduced in the southern states and countries, Austria, Bavaria and Switzerland, due to the influence of northern German writers, grammarians such as Johann Christoph Gottsched or language cultivation societies such as the Fruitbearing Society.

===19th century and early 20th century===

Though, by the mid-18th century, one norm was generally established, there was no institutionalized standardization. Only with the introduction of compulsory education in late 18th and early 19th century was the spelling further standardized, though at first independently in each state because of the political fragmentation of Germany. Only the foundation of the German Empire in 1871 allowed for further standardization.

In 1876, the Prussian government instituted the to achieve a standardization for the entire German Empire. However, its results were rejected, notably by Prime Minister of Prussia Otto von Bismarck.

In 1880, Gymnasium director Konrad Duden published the (&#x27;Complete Orthographic Dictionary of the German Language&#x27;), known simply as the &quot;Duden&quot;. In the same year, the Duden was declared to be authoritative in Prussia. Since Prussia was, by far, the largest state in the German Empire, its regulations also influenced spelling elsewhere, for instance, in 1894, when Switzerland recognized the Duden.

In 1901, the interior minister of the German Empire instituted the Second Orthographic Conference. It declared the Duden to be authoritative, with a few innovations. In 1902, its results were approved by the governments of the German Empire, Austria and Switzerland.

In 1944, the Nazi German government planned a reform of the orthography, but because of World War II, it was never implemented.

After 1902, German spelling was essentially decided &quot;de facto&quot; by the editors of the Duden dictionaries. After World War II, this tradition was followed with two different centers: Mannheim in West Germany and Leipzig in East Germany. By the early 1950s, a few other publishing houses had begun to attack the Duden monopoly in the West by putting out their own dictionaries, which did not always hold to the &quot;official&quot; spellings prescribed by Duden. In response, the Ministers of Culture of the federal states in West Germany officially declared the Duden spellings to be binding as of November 1955.

The Duden editors used their power cautiously because they considered their primary task to be the documentation of usage, not the creation of rules. At the same time, however, they found themselves forced to make finer and finer distinctions in the production of German spelling rules, and each new print run introduced a few reformed spellings.

===German spelling reform of 1996===
German spelling and punctuation was changed in 1996 () with the intent to simplify German orthography, and thus to make the language easier to learn, without substantially changing the rules familiar to users of the language. The rules of the new spelling concern correspondence between sounds and written letters (including rules for spelling loan words), capitalization, joined and separate words, hyphenated spellings, punctuation, and hyphenation at the end of a line. Place names and family names were excluded from the reform.

The reform was adopted initially by Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, and later by Luxembourg as well.

The new orthography is mandatory only in schools. A 1998 decision of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany confirmed that there is no law on the spelling people use in daily life, so they can use the old or the new spelling. While the reform is not very popular in opinion polls, it has been adopted by all major dictionaries and the majority of publishing houses.

<text>The Sopwith Pup is a British single-seater biplane fighter aircraft built by the Sopwith Aviation Company. It entered service with the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps in the autumn of 1916. With pleasant flying characteristics and good manoeuvrability, the aircraft proved very successful. The Pup was eventually outclassed by newer German fighters, but it was not completely replaced on the Western Front until the end of 1917. The remaining Pups were relegated to Home Defence and training units. The Pup&#x27;s docile flying characteristics also made it ideal for use in aircraft carrier deck landing and takeoff experiments and training.

==Design and development==
In 1915, Sopwith produced a small aircraft, known as &quot;Hawker&#x27;s Runabout&quot; (or the SL.T.B.P), for the company&#x27;s test pilot Harry Hawker. It was a single-seat, tractor biplane powered by a seven-cylinder Gnome rotary engine. Another four similar aircraft have been tentatively identified as Sopwith Sparrows. Sopwith next developed a more powerful aircraft as a fighter that was heavily influenced by this design, although controlled laterally with ailerons rather than by wing warping.

The resulting aircraft was a single-bay, single-seat biplane with a fabric-covered wooden framework and staggered equal-span wings. The cross-axle type main landing gear was supported by V-struts attached to the lower fuselage longerons. The prototype and most production Pups were powered by the Le Rhône 9C rotary engine. The armament was a single Vickers machine gun synchronized with the Sopwith-Kauper synchronizer.

A prototype was completed in February 1916 and sent to Upavon for testing in late March. The Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) quickly ordered two more prototypes, then placed a production order. Sopwith was heavily engaged in the production of the Sopwith 1½ Strutter, and produced only a small number of Pups for the RNAS. Deliveries commenced in August 1916.

The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) also placed large orders for Pups. The RFC orders were undertaken by sub-contractors Standard Motor Co. and Whitehead Aircraft. Deliveries did not commence until the beginning of 1917. 1,796 Pups were built, including 96 by Sopwith, 850 by Standard Motor Co., 820 by Whitehead Aircraft, and 30 by William Beardmore &amp; Co.

==Operational history==

In May 1916, the RNAS received its first Pups for operational trials with &quot;A&quot; Naval Squadron. The first Pups reached the Western Front in October 1916 with No. 8 Squadron RNAS, and proved successful, with the squadron&#x27;s Pups claiming 20 enemy machines destroyed in operations over the Somme battlefield by the end of the year. The first RFC Squadron to re-equip with the Pup was No. 54 Squadron, which arrived in France in December. The Pup quickly proved its superiority over the early Fokker, Halberstadt and Albatros biplanes. After encountering the Pup in combat, Manfred von Richthofen said, &quot;We saw at once that the enemy aeroplane was superior to ours.&quot;

The Pup&#x27;s light weight and generous wing area gave it a good rate of climb. Agility was enhanced by having ailerons on both wings. The Pup had half the horsepower and armament of the German Albatros D.III, but was much more manoeuvrable, especially over due to its low wing loading. Ace James McCudden stated that &quot;When it came to manoeuvring, the Sopwith [Pup] would turn twice to an Albatros&#x27; once ... it was a remarkably fine machine for general all-round flying. It was so extremely light and well surfaced that after a little practice one could almost land it on a tennis court.&quot; However, the Pup was also longitudinally unstable.

At the peak of its operational deployment, the Pup equipped only four RNAS squadrons (Nos. 3, 4, 8 and 9), and three RFC squadrons (Nos. 54, 46 and 66). By the spring of 1917, the Pup had been outclassed by the newest German fighters. The RNAS replaced their Pups, first with Sopwith Triplanes, and then with Sopwith Camels. The RFC soldiered on with Pups, despite increasing casualties, until it was possible to replace them with Camels in December 1917.

===Home Defence duties===
The raids on London by Gotha bombers in mid-1917 caused far more damage and casualties than the earlier airship raids. The ineffective response by British interceptor units had serious political repercussions. In response, No. 66 Squadron was withdrawn to Calais for a short period, and No. 46 was transferred for several weeks to Sutton&#x27;s Farm airfield near London. Two new Pup squadrons were formed specifically for Home Defence duties, No. 112 in July, and No. 61 in August.

The first Pups delivered to Home Defence units utilised the Le Rhône, but subsequent Home Defence Pups standardised on the more powerful Gnome Monosoupape, which provided an improved rate of climb. These aircraft were distinguishable by the addition of vents in the cowling face. In 1917, the Admiralty acquired the Sopwith Pup. 

===Shipboard use===

Sopwith Pups were also used in many pioneering carrier experiments. On 2 August 1917, a Pup flown by Sqn Cdr Edwin Harris Dunning became the first aircraft to land aboard a moving ship, . Dunning was killed on his third landing when the Pup fell over the side of the ship. The Pup began operations on the carriers in early 1917; the first aircraft were fitted with skid undercarriages in place of the standard landing gear. Landings utilised a system of deck wires to &quot;trap&quot; the aircraft. Later versions reverted to the normal undercarriage. Pups were used as ship-based fighters on three carriers: , &quot;Furious&quot; and . Some other Pups were deployed to cruisers and battleships where they were launched from platforms attached to gun turrets. A Pup flown from a platform on the cruiser shot down the German Zeppelin &quot;L 23&quot; off the Danish coast on 21 August 1917.

The U.S. Navy also employed the Sopwith Pup with Australian pilot Edgar Percival testing the use of carrier-borne fighters. In 1926, Percival flew a Pup from a platform on turret &quot;B&quot; on the battleship at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba prior to the ship undergoing a major refit that added catapults on the stern.

===Training duties===
The Pup saw extensive use as a trainer. Student pilots completing basic flight training in the Avro 504k often graduated to the Pup as advanced trainers. The Pup was also used in Fighting School units for instruction in combat techniques. Many training Pups were reserved by senior officers and instructors as their runabouts while a few survived in France as personal or squadron &#x27;hacks&#x27; long after the type had been withdrawn from combat.

==Nomenclature==
The Pup was officially named the Sopwith Scout. The &quot;Pup&quot; nickname arose because pilots considered it to be the &quot;pup&quot; of the larger two-seat Sopwith 1½ Strutter. The name never had official status as it was felt to be &quot;undignified,&quot; but a precedent was set, and all later Sopwith types apart from the Triplane acquired animal names (Camel, Dolphin, Snipe etc.), which ended up with the Sopwith firm being said to have created a &quot;flying zoo&quot; during the First World War.

==Surviving aircraft==

* B1807 – Pup under restoration to airworthy condition. Built by Standard Motors in 1917 and delivered to a Home Defence squadron. This aircraft was originally fitted with a Gnome Monosoupape engine, along with the distinctive three-quarter vented cowling. It was refitted by the Le Rhône engine sometime in 1918. B1807 was sold at Croydon in 1920 and entered the civil register as G-EAVX. It appeared on 16 July at the 1921 Aerial Derby at Hendon, where it was groundlooped by its pilot. The wings were removed and the fuselage disappeared until 1973, when the current owner discovered the remains of the aircraft in a barn in Dorset.
* N5182 – Pup on static display at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford in Cosford, Shropshire. Built by Sopwith Aviation Co. at Kingston upon Thames in 1916. N5182 was operated by several RNAS squadrons in Belgium and Northern France. It was flown by the noted aces Edward Grange and Robert A. Little, both of whom scored victories with the aircraft. A private collector acquired N5182 from the French Air Force in 1959 and restored it to airworthy condition. N5182 was acquired by the museum in 1982.
* N5195 – Pup on static display at the Museum of Army Flying in Middle Wallop, Hampshire. Served in the Royal Naval Air Service in France.
* 3004/14 – Dove maintained in airworthy condition by the Shuttleworth Collection in Old Warden, Bedfordshire. Delivered in 1919 as a 2-seater Dove, then converted to Pup configuration in the 1930s. It is powered by a Le Rhône 9C rotary engine. In 2004/5 the aircraft was extensively refurbished in the colours of 9917, a Beardmore-built aircraft which was fitted with Le Prieur rockets when it served for a time on HMS Manxman, a seaplane carrier. It is registered as G-EBKY.

=== Native Americans ===
* Urban Indians, communities developed by small enclaves of Native Americans/First Nations and Alaskan Natives since the 1930s. They tend to form small percentages of the urban areas&#x27; population. Virtually every major city in the US has an American Indian community. See Rancherie/ Ranchería for urban Indian parts of Las Vegas, Nevada and Reno, Nevada. Urban Indian reserves in Canada have also been located within Canadian cities.

The highest concentration of urban Indians in the United States is believed to be in Anchorage, Alaska where over 10 percent of the population identify themselves in the census as having some Native ancestry, with 7.3 percent identifying that as their only ancestry. In the mainland USA, Indian Alley in downtown Los Angeles, California, may be the most dense Native American population of any major city.

The second highest concentration of urban Indians in the U.S. is Albuquerque, New Mexico where at least 5 percent of the population belong to recognized Native American tribes such as the Navajo, Apache and Pueblo (Keresan, Tiwa, Tewa, Towa, Zuni). Southeast Albuquerque has the largest Native American community in the city but Native communities can also be found on the Westside and Rio Rancho. Albuquerque also has a Cherokee diaspora community known as the Cherokee Southwest Township. A much larger percentage of the population possess some Native ancestry but identity as Hispanos, Mestizos or Genizaros. This population lives all over the Albuquerque metro area but is concentrated in the South Valley and Bernalillo.

Winnipeg, Manitoba has the largest indigenous population of any major city in Canada both in terms of percentage (12.2 percent) and total number. Other Canadian cities with significant First Nations populations include Prince George, British Columbia and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

<text>Professional wrestling throws are the application of professional wrestling techniques that involve lifting the opponent up and throwing or slamming them down. They are sometimes also called &quot;power&quot; maneuvers, as they are meant to emphasize a wrestler&#x27;s strength. Many of these moves are used as finishers by various wrestlers, who refer to them by several different names that reflect their gimmick. Moves are listed under general categories whenever possible.

==Armbreaker==
An armbreaker is any move in which the wrestler slams the opponent&#x27;s arm against a part of the wrestler&#x27;s body, usually a knee or shoulder.

===Diving armbreaker===
A wrestler dives from the ropes and lands on the opponent&#x27;s arm.

===Double knee armbreaker===
The wrestler grabs one of the opponent&#x27;s arms, jumps and connects both their knees against the opponent&#x27;s stretched arm. As the wrestler falls onto their back, this forces the opponent&#x27;s arm down into both knees, thus damaging it.

==Arm drag==
A move in which the wrestler uses their opponent&#x27;s momentum to the opponent&#x27;s disadvantage. The wrestler hooks the opponent&#x27;s arm and flips them over on to the mat. The wrestler may roll on to their side to give the move extra momentum.

===Japanese arm drag===
This move is performed when an opponent runs towards the wrestler facing them. When the opponent is in range, the wrestler hooks the opponent&#x27;s near arm with both hands and falls backwards, forcing the wrestler&#x27;s own momentum to cause them to flip forwards over the head of the wrestler and on to their back. Despite its name, it actually originates from Mexican &quot;lucha libre&quot;, not Japanese &quot;puroresu&quot;.

===Over-the-shoulder arm drag===
The wrestler grabs their opponent&#x27;s arm, then turns to face the other direction and pulls the opponent over their shoulder. It is essentially the same as the &quot;ippon seoi nage&quot; found in judo.

===Tilt-a-whirl arm drag===
An arm drag which sees the wrestler being spun in front of the opponent&#x27;s body in a tilt-a-whirl, and then ending it with an arm drag.

===Wheelbarrow arm drag===
This arm drag sees the wrestler being held in a wheelbarrow hold by the opponent, and then going for an over the shoulder arm drag as they free their legs off of the opponent&#x27;s waist. It was used by AJ Lee as a transition move.

==Arm wringer==
An arm wringer or spinning wristlock is a move in which the wrestler grabs the opponent&#x27;s wrist with both hands and twists it over the wrestler&#x27;s head to spin the arm around, either with enough force to flip the opponent to the mat or just to hyperrotate the joints while standing. When used as a hold, the wrestler often yanks the arm for added effect.

==Atomic drop==
A move in which the wrestler goes behind an opponent, then puts their head under the opponent&#x27;s shoulder. They then lift their opponent up, and drops them tailbone-first on the wrestler&#x27;s knee. Known in Mexico&#x27;s &quot;lucha libre&quot; as &quot;silla eléctrica&quot; (Spanish for electric chair).

===Inverted atomic drop===
Also known as a &quot;Manhattan drop&quot;, this is a move in which the wrestler puts their head under the opponent&#x27;s shoulder and lifts the opponent up and then drops their groin on the wrestler&#x27;s knee.

===Sitout full nelson atomic drop===
Better known as a full nelson bomb, this move sees the wrestling apply a full nelson hold to the opponent from behind. The wrestler then lifts the opponent into the air and falls into a seated position, driving the opponent tailbone-first on to the mat. This move is used by Bubba Ray Dudley, who dubbed it the &quot;Bubba Bomb/Bully Bomb&quot;.

==Backbreaker==

A backbreaker refers to professional wrestling moves in which a wrestler drops an opponent so that the opponent&#x27;s back impacts or is bent backwards against a part of the wrestler&#x27;s body, usually the knee.

==Back body drop==
A back body drop or backdrop (also sometimes called a shoulder back toss), is a move in which a wrestler bends forward or crouches in front of their opponent, grabs hold of the opponent, and stands up, lifting the opponent up and over and dropping them behind the back. It is applied frequently against a charging opponent. In Japan, a backdrop is the term for what is called a belly-to-back suplex in America, so in Japan, it is called shoulder throw.

=== Mountain bomb ===
Innovated by Hiroyoshi Tenzan. This move sees the opponent runs towards the wrestler. The wrestler ducks, hooks one of the opponent&#x27;s legs with one of their arms, stands up and falls backwards, flipping the opponent and driving them back first down to the mat, with the wrestler landing on top of the opponent.

==Biel throw==
The wrestler stands slightly to the side of their opponent, grabs the opponent by the nape in a single or double collar tie, and throws them forward, causing the opponent to flip over onto their back. It is considered a very basic technique, so basic that a forward rolling fall is commonly called a biel bump and is mainly used by very large wrestlers to emphasize power and strength over finesse.

==Brainbuster==
A brainbuster is a move in which a wrestler puts their opponent in a front facelock, hooks their tights, and lifts them up as if they were performing a vertical suplex. The wrestler then either jumps up or quickly falls onto their back so that the opponent lands on their head while remaining vertical.

==Bulldog==
A bulldog, originally known as bulldogging or a bulldogging headlock or the headlock jawbreaker, is any move in which the wrestler grabs an opponent&#x27;s head and jumps forward, so that the wrestler lands, often in a sitting position, and drives the opponent&#x27;s face into the mat. This move plus some other variations are sometimes referred to as facebusters.

===Cobra Clutch bulldog===
The wrestler applies a Cobra Clutch and then leaps forward, falling into a sitting position and driving the face of the opponent into the ground.

===Diving bulldog===
The wrestler jumps from the turnbuckle behind the opponent, then applies a headlock, driving the opponent&#x27;s face into the mat. Popularized by Rick Steiner. It is also used by Trevor Murdoch as a finisher.

==== Diving leg drop bulldog ====
Also known as a &quot;Diving Famouser&quot;. The wrestler springboards off one of the ropes or jumps from the top turnbuckle, dropping a leg across the nape of a leaning forward opponent. This was popularized by both Billy Gunn and John Cena as one of their signature moves. Carmelo Hayes currently uses this move under the name &quot;Nothing But Net.&quot;

===Fireman&#x27;s carry bulldog===
The attacking wrestler picks up the opponent in a fireman&#x27;s carry. The wrestler then proceeds by holding their opponent&#x27;s legs with one arm and applying a headlock with their other arm in a similar fashion to an Air Raid Crash. From here, the attacking wrestler twists the opposite way and quickly switches back, throwing the opponent&#x27;s legs out backwards and drops down to the mat while holding the opponent&#x27;s head, forcing them to fall face first into a bulldog position. This variation was used and popularized by TNA wrestler James Storm, who dubbed it the &quot;Eight Second Ride&quot;.

===Full nelson bulldog===
This variation begins with the wrestler holding the opponent in a full nelson. The wrestler then leaps forward into a sitting position, driving the opponent face-first. The move was popularized by Jillian Hall.

===Half nelson bulldog===
The wrestler hooks a half nelson hold on their opponent with one arm and their opponent&#x27;s waist with the other, then leaps forward into a sitting position, driving the face of the opponent into the ground. This move is a signature of Edge, who calls it &quot;Winning Edge&quot;.

===Inverted bulldog===
The attacking wrestler stands side-to-side and slightly behind the opponent, facing in the opposite direction, then leaps in the air and drops to a seated position, driving the opponent neck- and back-first to the mat. In another variation, the attacker runs to the opponent and executes the move. This is usually referred to as a lariat takedown.

===Knee drop bulldog===
A version that involves the wrestler placing one knee against the base of a bent over opponent&#x27;s neck, then dropping to force the opponent down to the mat, landing on the opponent&#x27;s upper body. There is also a diving version.

===Leg drop bulldog===
The wrestler jumps in the air and uses one leg to push down on the head of an opponent who is leaning forward, which drives the opponent face-first into the mat. The move was innovated by Johnny Ace, calling it the &quot;Ace Crusher II&quot;, popularized by Billy Gunn, who called it the &quot;Famouser&quot; (or the fame-ass-er when he was wrestling as ‘Mr.Ass.) Nic Nemeth/Dolph Ziggler used the move as well. Marty Jannetty performed a version of the move where he applied a wristlock to the opponent first, which became known as the &quot;Rocker Dropper&quot;. Kelly Kelly later adopted the same variation as her finishing maneuver, calling it &quot;K2&quot;.

====Inverted leg drop bulldog====

An inverted version of this sees the attacking wrestler drop the opponent on the back of their head, as done in a reverse bulldog. This can be achieved by first holding an opponent in an inverted facelock or by simply grabbing the opponent and forcibly leaning them back before lifting their far (or sometimes inside) leg, rotating so the leg is over the opponent&#x27;s head, and dropping to a sitting position, kneeling, or a split-legged position and maintained into a pin. WWE wrestler Melina popularized this move.

===One-handed bulldog===

The one-handed bulldog is in fact more of a facebuster than an actual bulldog and generally sees a wrestler run up from behind their opponent, grab the opponent&#x27;s head with one hand, and leap forward. Kenny Omega has used a variation, called the &quot;Kotaro Krusher,&quot; where he performed a jump from the canvas over the opponent, usually jumping upwards of 6 feet before hitting the bulldog.

===Reverse bulldog===
Standing next to or diagonally behind an opponent, the attacking wrestler leaps up, grabs the opponent&#x27;s head and pulls backwards, resulting in both individuals landing supine. Current TNA wrestler Nic Nemeth uses and popularized this move, which he calls the &quot;Danger Zone&quot;. It was previously known as the &quot;Zig Zag&quot; during his tenure in WWE as Dolph Ziggler.

===Slingshot bulldog===
Similar to a hangman, where the wrestler catches the opponent in a side headlock, running towards any set of ropes. The wrestler then jumps over them and bulldogs the opponent, driving the chin/face of the opponent into the top rope. The wrestler would eventually either land standing or seated on the apron or the outside of the ring.

The same maneuver can be used on a cornered opponent (who is facing away from the ring) to drive their face into the top turnbuckle.

===Spinning bulldog===
The wrestler stands to the side of the opponent and applies a side headlock. The wrestler then spins around in a circle and drops into a seated position, driving the opponent face-first into the mat.

===Springboard bulldog===

The wrestler applies a headlock on the opponent, then runs towards the ropes and bounces off, driving the opponent face-first into mat as they land. WWE Hall of Famer Trish Stratus popularized this move and dubbed it the &quot;Stratusfaction&quot; and it was also used by Bo Dallas as the &quot;Bo-Dog&quot;.

===Two-handed bulldog===
The wrestler places both hands behind the opponent&#x27;s head, then falls into a seated position, slamming the opponent&#x27;s face into the canvas. Another variation sees the wrestler placing one hand behind the opponent&#x27;s head and the other behind the back, then falling backwards into a bulldog. WWE Hall of Famer Mick Foley used this move as one of his signature moves. The move was also used by Scotty 2 Hotty as a signature move.

===Wheelbarrow bulldog===
This bulldog sees the opponent clutching the wrestler in a wheelbarrow bodyscissors. The wrestler then falls downwards, while still scissoring their legs around the opponent&#x27;s waist, and pushes against the canvas. As they rebound back to the opponent, the attacker releases their legs, quickly places their hand behind the opponent&#x27;s head, and goes for a bulldog. The bulldog is usually one-handed rather than a headlock bulldog.

==Catapult==
A catapult or slingshot catapult is a throw that typically starts with the opponent on their back, and the wrestler standing and facing them. The wrestler hooks each of the opponent&#x27;s legs in one of their arms, then falls backwards to slingshot the opponent into a turnbuckle, ladder, rope, mat, etc. This can also be held for a backbreaker.

==Chokeslam==

A chokeslam is any body slam in which the wrestler grasps their opponent&#x27;s neck, lifts them up, and slams them to the mat, causing them to land on their back. The move is used by numerous wrestlers, often larger ones who portray &quot;monster&quot; characters.

==Cobra Clutch slam==
In this slam a wrestler places the opponent in a Cobra Clutch and then lifts the opponent into the air by his/her neck before jumping backwards to drive the opponent back-first down to the mat while remaining standing, falling forward, or dropping into a seated or kneeling position. The fall-forward version of the move were both used by Billy Gunn as the &quot;One &amp; Only&quot; and later popularized by Ted DiBiase Jr., who used a modified version in which he dropped the opponent to one side, naming it the &quot;Dream Street&quot;. Jinder Mahal currently uses the kneeling side slam version of this move, calling it the &quot;Khallas&quot;.

==DDT==
The DDT is a move innovated by Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts, performed by putting the opponent&#x27;s head underneath the attacker&#x27;s arm in a front facelock and then falling back, driving the opponent&#x27;s head into the mat.

==Driver==
A driver is a move in which the wrestler clutches the opponent&#x27;s body in some form before falling into a sitout position while dropping the opponent on their back, neck, and/or shoulders.

===Abdominal stretch driver===
First the wrestler applies an Abdominal stretch. They then uses their free arm to creating momentum by raising it skywards and bringing down quickly in between the opponent&#x27;s legs while using their own body weight to fall sideways, flipping the opponent over them to slam them on the back of their head and neck. NXT wrestler Gigi Dolin uses this move as a finisher called the &quot;Gigi Driver&quot;.

===Black Fire driver===

Used as a finisher by Rey Fenix, this move starts with the wrestler having their opponent up on their shoulders as if they are going to perform a muscle buster, but then spin their opponent around into a Michinoku driver II-B.

===Cobra Clutch driver===
The wrestler stands behind an opponent and applies a cobra clutch on their opponent, placing one of their hands against the opponent&#x27;s neck after hooking the opponent&#x27;s arm with it. They then scoop the opponent&#x27;s near leg with their other arm and lift the opponent up, flip the opponent upside down, and then either kneel or sit down, driving the opponent down to the mat on their neck. Another variation has the attacking wrestler apply a pumphandle prior to executing this technique and is used by wrestlers like Jinder Mahal.

===Electric chair driver===
Also known as a &quot;Joker Driver.&quot; In this variation of a driver, the wrestler lifts the opponent on their shoulders in an electric chair sitting position and then takes hold of the opponent and pulls them over their shoulder and down to the mat while falling to a sit out position so that the opponent lands on their upper back and neck between the legs of the wrestler, facing towards them, usually resulting in a pin. A one-handed variation is used by Kenny Omega, known as the &quot;One-Winged Angel&quot; and by Big Damo known as the &quot;Ulster Plantation&quot;. Chris Hero has also used this move as well, calling it the &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot;, as well as &quot;Speedball&quot; Mike Bailey, who uses a cross-legged version of the move called the &quot;Flamingo Driver&quot;.

===Fisherman driver===
This move was innovated by Shiro Koshinaka and it was called a &quot;Samurai Driver &#x27;94&quot; as a finisher. The wrestler places the opponent in a front facelock and hooks one of the opponent&#x27;s legs with their free arm. The wrestler then lifts the opponent upside down or on to their shoulders, and then sits down, driving the opponent between their legs, head and shoulder first. A wrist-clutch variation of this driver exists which sees the wrestler lift the opponent on to their shoulders, and while the opponent is on their shoulders, he/she uses the hand hooking the opponent&#x27;s leg to reach upwards and clutch the wrist of the arm opposite the hooked leg. While maintaining the wrist-clutch, they then perform the driver. There is a further variation that does not include the shoulder lift that sees the wrestler hook the leg and wrist while the opponent is standing in front of him/her, lift the opponent upside down and then fall to the sitout position. This move was made popular by wrestler Low Ki who calls it the &quot;Ki Krusher&quot;. A cross legged version is used by CIMA, who calls it the &quot;Perfect Driver&quot;.

====Wrist-clutch fisherman driver====
This variation involves grabbing and pulling by the opponent&#x27;s wrist, then lifting them up into the air, before falling to their back, driving the opponent to the ground on the back of their head/neck. This was popularized by Shingo Takagi as &quot;The Last Falconry&quot;, now known as &quot;The Last of the Dragon&quot;.

===Half nelson driver===
This was invented by Kensuke Sasaki. The wrestler stands behind an opponent and applies a half nelson hold on their opponent, placing one of their hands against the opponent&#x27;s neck after hooking the opponent&#x27;s arm with it. They then scoop the opponent&#x27;s near leg with their other arm and lift the opponent up, flip the opponent upside down, and then either kneel or sit down, driving the opponent down to the mat on their neck. Another variation has the attacking wrestler apply a pumphandle prior to executing this technique. This variation has been used by Jordynne Grace (&quot;Juggernaut Driver&quot;), Pénta El Zero M (&quot;Pénta Driver&quot;), Yoshi-Hashi (&quot;Karma)&quot;, Shingo Takagi (&quot;Made in Japan&quot;) and several other wrestlers.

===Michinoku Driver II===
Innovated by Taka Michinoku, and technically known as a sitout scoop slam piledriver. Facing their opponent, the wrestler reaches between their opponent&#x27;s legs with their right arm and reaches around the opponent&#x27;s neck from the same side with their left arm. They then lift the opponent up and turn them around so that they are held upside down, as in a scoop slam, before dropping down into a sitout position, driving the opponent down to the mat neck and shoulder first. Many people call it the Michinoku Driver because it is used more often than the original Michinoku Driver. This variation of the move was also used by Vampiro under the name &quot;Nail in the Coffin&quot;.

====Michinoku Driver II-B====
A variation of the Michinoku Driver II in which the wrestler stands behind the opponent, applies an inverted facelock, lifts them upside down, and then drops down to a sitting position, driving the opponent down to the mat between the wrestler&#x27;s legs upper back first. AEW wrestler Ricochet uses a spinning version of the move called &quot;Vertigo&quot;.

===Samoan driver===
The attacking wrestler drapes an opponent over their shoulders in a fireman&#x27;s carry position and then takes hold of the opponent and pulls them over their shoulder and down to the mat while falling to a sitting position so that the opponent lands on their upper back and neck between the legs of the wrestler, facing towards them. A cross-legged and wrist-clutch version of this move also exists. It is used as finishing moves by wrestlers such as TNA wrestlers Su Yung (&quot;Panic Switch&quot;), and Ash by Elegance (formerly known as Dana Brooke in WWE), and is also used by WWE superstars Chris Sabin (&quot;Cradle Shock&quot;), Santos Escobar (&quot;Phantom Driver&quot;) and Lyra Valkyria (&quot;Nightwing&quot;). Former WWE Diva Ivory uses this as a signature move. Shinsuke Nakamura formerly used the move as a finisher as &quot;Landslide&quot;, only to later change his primary finisher to the &quot;Bomaye/Kinshasa&quot;, although he stills occasionally uses the move as a signature.

===Wheelbarrow driver===
Similar to the wheelbarrow facebuster but instead of dropping their opponent face first, they drop their opponent so that the opponent lands on their upper back and neck between the legs of the wrestler, facing towards them, usually resulting in a pin. Swerve Strickland is well known for using this move as his finisher, using a half-nelson variation dubbed &quot;Big Pressure&quot; (formerly known as the &quot;JML Driver&quot;).

==Electric chair drop==
The wrestler lifts the opponent on their shoulders in an electric chair sitting position and then falls backwards driving the opponent back-first into the mat. There is also a driver, a facebuster and a suplex variation of the move.

==Facebreaker==
A facebreaker is any move in which the wrestler slams their opponent&#x27;s face against a part of the wrestler&#x27;s body, usually the knee.

===Double knee facebreaker===
This facebreaker involves an attacking wrestler, who is standing face-to-face with an opponent, hooking both hands around the opponent&#x27;s head and then leaping to bring both knees up to the face of the opponent. The wrestler then falls backwards to the mat, thus forcing the opponent to fall forwards and impact the exposed knees. The move was originated by Phillip Michael Grant, and later popularized by Chris Jericho, who named it the &quot;Codebreaker&quot;. It would also be used by Asuka, James Storm and Carmelo Hayes as signature moves, with Storm referring to the move as &quot;Bottoms Up!&quot; and Hayes referring to it as &quot;The First 48&quot;. Bushi uses a diving variation called &quot;MX&quot; where he dives from the top rope to hit the double knee facebreaker, as well as Tessa Blanchard, who calls the move &quot;Magnum&quot;, also as an hommage to her stepfather Magnum T.A.. Liv Morgan&#x27;s &quot;201/Jersey Codebreaker&quot; is a variation where she stands 90 degrees from the opponent, and delivers the double knees or shins while she is landing on her back.

===Fireman&#x27;s carry facebreaker===
This move is performed in a manner similar to the TKO, but instead of dropping their opponent face first on the mat, they would be dropped face first on the knee of the wrestler performing the move. Austin Theory is currently using this move as a finisher initially dubbed as the &quot;Austin Theory Lift&quot; (ATL) during his time in NXT, but now has been dubbed the &quot;A-Town Down&quot; ever since moving up to the main roster.

===Inverted stomp facebreaker===
Also known as the &quot;Foot Stunner&quot;. The user applies a standing wrist lock on their opponent, then places their foot on the opponent&#x27;s face and falls backwards, forcing the opponent&#x27;s face into their foot. This move is used as a finishing move by Gail Kim (&quot;Eat Defeat&quot;), Chuck Taylor (&quot;Sole Food&quot;), Xavier Woods (&quot;Lost in the Woods&quot;), Enzo Amore (&quot;JawdonZo&quot;), Colt Cabana (&quot;Eat The Feet&quot;) and Mia Yim (&quot;Seoul Food&quot; [formerly known as &quot;Eat Defeat&quot;]).

===Knee smash facebreaker===
The move is a standard facebreaker which involves the wrestler facing an opponent and grabbing him or her by the head or hair and pulling the opponent&#x27;s face down, dropping it on to the wrestler&#x27;s knee. Often used by a wrestler to stun an opponent and set him or her up for another move. Many other facebreakers use the knee to inflict the damage; one variation sees the wrestler apply a standing side headlock, and simultaneously pull the opponent forward and smash the wrestler&#x27;s knee to the opponent&#x27;s head. Triple H popularized this move.

===Shoulder facebreaker===
Also described as a hangman&#x27;s facebreaker or an over the shoulder facebreaker, this facebreaker is performed when an attacking wrestler, who is standing in a back to back position with an opponent, reaches back to pull the opponent&#x27;s head over their shoulder before (while keeping a hold of the opponent&#x27;s head) spinning round to twist the opponent&#x27;s head over as they drop down to one knee forcing the opponent face-first into the wrestlers exposed knee in one quick fluid motion.

===Single knee facebreaker===
Similar to the double knee facebreaker, but with only one knee. Shawn Spears used this move during his second tenure in the WWE as &quot;Tye Dillinger&quot;, calling it &quot;Perfect 10&quot;. Ricochet uses this move, calling it &quot;Recoil&quot; and Gregory Helms also uses it

==Facebuster==

A facebuster, also known as a faceplant, is any move in which the wrestler forces their opponent&#x27;s face down to the mat which does not involve a headlock or facelock.

==Fireman&#x27;s carry throws==
A fireman&#x27;s carry involves the wrestler holding the opponent in place over both shoulders. From this position, various throws can be performed.

===Airplane spin===

A wrestler lifts the opponent on to their shoulders and spins around and around until they get dizzy and crash to the ground. This move has been made famous notably by WWE Hall of Famer Gorilla Monsoon and NXT&#x27;s Tyler Bate. This move was the finisher of Mike Rotunda during his time in the WWF in the mid-80s.

==== Inverted airplane spin ====
This move is performed from an Argentine Backbreaker Rack Hold. Occasionally, the person doing the move can do it without their hands on their opponent, typically on the hips. Used by Claudio Castagnoli as the &quot;UFO&quot; (&quot;Unidentified Flying Opponent&quot;).

===Death Valley driver===
 Also known as the &quot;Death Valley Bomb&quot; in Japan, this move is performed from a fireman&#x27;s carry. The wrestler throws the opponent off their shoulders and falls in the direction that the opponent&#x27;s head is facing, driving the opponent&#x27;s head or back into the mat. Similar to the fireman&#x27;s carry takeover, with more of an emphasis on targeting the neck. The Death Valley driver was innovated by Louie Spicolli (although he credited Etsuko Mita as the move&#x27;s originator). Kazuchika Okada uses this move as &quot;Heavy Rain.&quot; Buddy Murphy uses a pumphandle lift version called &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Law&quot;. Velveteen Dream uses a cartwheel version of the move itself called the &quot;Dream Valley Driver&quot;. Sean O&#x27;Haire used a variation that saw him toss his opponent to the opposite side, landing flat onto their back, called the &quot;Widow Maker&quot;.

====Inverted Death Valley driver====
Also known as the &quot;Victoria Driver&quot; or &quot;Burning Hammer&quot;, this move is executed from an Argentine backbreaker rack position. The wrestler then falls sideways, driving the opponent&#x27;s head to the mat. This is considered an extremely dangerous move, as the opponent&#x27;s body cannot roll with the natural momentum of the move to absorb the impact. In a cut-throat variation of this driver, instead of holding the body of the opponent, a wrestler holds the far arm of the opponent across the opponent&#x27;s own throat and maintains it by holding the opponent&#x27;s wrist before performing the inverted Death Valley driver. The Inverted Death Valley Driver was innovated by Kotetsu Yamamoto in the 1970s but popularized by Kenta Kobashi as the &quot;Burning Hammer&quot;. Michael Elgin uses a sit-out variation of the &quot;Burning Hammer&quot; so as not to hurt the head or neck of his opponent allowing them to roll left or right, while Tyler Reks&#x27; &quot;Burning Hammer&quot; saw hers flip the opponent onto their stomach before impact (as in an inverted Fireman&#x27;s Carry Takeover).

====Side Death Valley driver====
A variation between the regular Death Valley driver and the inverted one. The opponent lies on their side on the shoulders of the wrestler, facing either the opposite or the same direction as the wrestler, with the wrestler holding the opponent by the lower leg and either the head or lower arm. The wrestler then falls sideways, driving the opponent down to the mat shoulder and neck first. Claudio Castagnoli used this move a few times and now uses it as his signature move, named the &quot;Swissblade&quot;.

===Fireman&#x27;s carry drop===
The attacking wrestler first lifts their opponent over their shoulders in a fireman&#x27;s carry position. The attacking wrestler then pushes the opponent forward and off their body, slamming the opponent face-down onto the mat. The wrestler may land in a kneeling or squatting position. This move was used by Mojo Rawley.

===Fireman&#x27;s carry headlock spinning elbow drop===
The wrestler performs the fireman&#x27;s carry from a standing position, then tosses the opponent off their shoulders and drops the opponent into a Headlock Elbow Drop. It is currently used by Hirooki Goto as the &quot;GTW.&quot;

===Fireman&#x27;s carry sitout side powerslam=== 
The wrestler performs the fireman&#x27;s carry from a standing position, then swings the opponent around and drops them &quot;Sitout side powerslam&quot;. The move is used by Hiromu Takahashi as the &quot;Dynamite Plunger&quot; and JD McDonagh as the &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Call&quot;.

===Fireman&#x27;s carry slam===

The wrestler first drapes an opponent over their shoulders in a fireman&#x27;s carry position. The wrestler then takes hold of the thigh and arm of the opponent, which are hung over the front side of the wrestler, and leans forward, pulling the opponent over their head and shoulders, slamming them down on their back in front of the wrestler. A rolling fireman&#x27;s carry slam is a variation that sees the wrestler keep hold of the opponent and run forward before slamming the opponent to the ground, using the momentum to roll over the opponent and is referred to as a &quot;Steam Roller&quot;, &quot;Rolling Hills&quot; or Finlay Roll&quot;. A variation of this move from corner middle rope exist and has been used by Mr. Kennedy which he called the &quot;Green Bay Plunge&quot;. A swinging leghook fireman&#x27;s carry slam is another variation that involves a wrestler holding the wrist of the opponent while putting their head under the opponent&#x27;s chest. Then after grabbing the opponents nearest leg, the wrestler lifts the opponent&#x27;s leg outward before swinging forward using the opponent&#x27;s momentum and slamming them down back-first. A neckbreaker variation also exists where the wrestler lifts the opponent on their shoulders in a fireman&#x27;s carry, then lifts their opponent over and grabs the head before slamming them down in a neckbreaker slam. Bobby Roode used the neckbreaker version as a finisher, which he calls &quot;Roode Bomb&quot;. Keith Lee uses a powerslam or jackhammer version as a finisher that he calls the &quot;Big Bang Catastrophe&quot;.

Another version of this move sees the wrestler using which ever near hand on the opponent&#x27;s chest to push and throw them upwards while maintaining the hold on the opponent&#x27;s inside thigh to slam them over to one&#x27;s side while remaining standing. Diamond Dallas Page used the standing version. This move has also been transitioned into a sidewalk slam, a fall forward side slam, and a chokeslam.

===Fireman&#x27;s carry takeover===

There are two versions of the fireman&#x27;s carry takeover used in professional wrestling. The first is borrowed from amateur wrestling and sees the wrestler kneel down on one knee and simultaneously grab hold of one of the opponent&#x27;s thighs with one arm and one of the opponent&#x27;s arms with their other arm. The wrestler then pulls the opponent onto their shoulders and rises up slightly, using the motion to push the opponent off their shoulders, flipping them to the mat onto their back. The other closely resembles a Death Valley driver. The wrestler performs the fireman&#x27;s carry from a standing position, then tosses the opponent off their shoulders as they drop down to their knees, causing the opponent to land on their back. The standing variant is a higher impact version of the move because the wrestler falls from a greater height, and is a move closely associated with John Cena through his use of it as his finishing maneuver, which he calls the &quot;Attitude Adjustment&quot; (formerly the &quot;F.U.&quot;). Another variation sees the move done from the top or middle rope, used occasionally by Cena as the &quot;Super Attitude Adjustment&quot; or &quot;Avalanche Attitude Adjustment&quot;.

====Olympic slam====
The wrestler holds the opponent&#x27;s wrist while putting their head underneath the opponent&#x27;s chest, grabs the inside of one of the opponents legs, then lifts the opponent up onto their shoulders while falling backwards. This move was popularized by and named in reference to Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle, who also dubbed it the &quot;Angle Slam&quot; as an alternate name.

====Samoan drop====

The wrestler drapes an opponent over their shoulders in a fireman&#x27;s carry position then falls backwards, driving the opponent down to the mat on their back. A one-handed, swinging leg hook, and a twisting version are also possible. This move is most often performed by wrestlers of Samoan heritage (typically from the Anoaʻi family, including The Rock, Rikishi and Roman Reigns (who uses the one-handed variant), as well as a pop-up version used by Umaga, Nia Jax, Jacob Fatu and The Usos). A top rope variant was also regularly performed by Scott Steiner, while Ronda Rousey uses the twisting version as a finisher, calling it &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit.&quot; This move was not only used just by wrestlers of Samoan heritage. Wrestlers such as Terry Gordy and Viscera have used this move as well. Mike Rotunda also used this move as a finisher during his run as VK Wallstreet and I.R.S., calling it the &quot;Stock Market Crash&quot;. WWE Legend Tatanka also used this as a finisher, calling it the &quot;End of the Trail&quot;.

===Flapjack===
Also can be called a pancake slam, this maneuver involves the attacking wrestler lifting their opponent up in a quick motion while holding a single leg or both legs. Usually, the opponent&#x27;s upper body and head is lifted above a shoulder of the attacker, while the legs have been caught. The attacker then falls on their back, bringing opponent&#x27;s legs with them. The opponent lands face-first into the mat, with their upper body damaged. The Single-leg version is more commonly used. Former NXT Rookie Percy Watson used a variant in which he holds his opponent in a fireman&#x27;s carry before transitioning into a flapjack, dubbing this move &quot;Percycution&quot;.

A hotshot is referred to when a flapjack is performed so that the opponent falls across the ring ropes. The fireman&#x27;s carry flapjack sees the wrestler lift the opponent on to a fireman&#x27;s carry, and then throw the upper body of the opponent away from the wrestler while the wrestler falls backwards, driving the opponent down to the mat chest first.

====Pop-up====
Also called a &quot;free-fall&quot; or &quot;push-up flapjack&quot;. A pop-up is a flapjack where the attacker, upon facing an opponent rushing towards them, flings the opponent vertically up into the air without holding on to the opponent. The standing attacker or the airborne opponent is free to carry out an attack after the pop-up. Examples of attacks from the standing wrestler include performing a European uppercut to the falling opponent, or catching the opponent and then performing a sitout powerbomb. Examples of attacks from the airborne opponent include executing a dropkick on the standing opponent. Tag teams may also utilize the pop-up by throwing an opponent to a teammate who would execute an attack.

==Full nelson==
===Full nelson slam===
In this move, the attacker places their opponent in a full nelson hold and uses it to lift them off the ground. With the opponent in the air, the attacker removes one arm (so their opponent is now in a half nelson) and slams the opponent back-first into the mat. Another similar variation, known as a double chickenwing slam, sees the wrestler apply double chickenwing instead of a full nelson before slamming the opponent. Aron Stevens used the full nelson version.

====Inverted full nelson slam====
Also known as the reverse full nelson slam, this variation sees the attacker tuck and slide their arms under the opponent&#x27;s armpits and then clutch the opponent&#x27;s lower jaw. Then, the attacker lifts the opponent before falling forward to slam the opponent back-first into the mat. This move is used as a finisher by Luke Gallows, dubbed the &quot;Gallows Pole&quot;

===Half nelson slam===
The wrestler stands behind, slightly to one side of and facing the opponent. The wrestler reaches under one of the opponent&#x27;s arms with their corresponding arm and places the palm of their hand on the back of the opponent&#x27;s neck, thereby forcing the arm of the opponent up into the air to complete the half nelson. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up, turns, and falls forward, slamming the opponent back-first into the mat.

==Giant swing==

A giant swing starts with an opponent lying on the mat, face up, and the wrestler at the opponent&#x27;s feet. The wrestler takes the opponent&#x27;s legs up under their arms, similar to the setup for a catapult, but instead pivots, spinning around to lift the opponent off the mat. The attacker may release the opponent to send them flying, or simply slow until the back of the opponent returns to the ground. AEW&#x27;s Claudio Castagnoli uses the giant swing as a signature move.

==Guillotine drop==
This move sees the attacking wrestler lift the opponent in a standing guillotine choke and drop the opponent to the mat, lower spine first. This causes an effect to the whole spine and neck. A variation involving a standing double underhook rather than the guillotine choke also exists. It is used by Angel Garza as the &quot;Wing Clipper.&quot;

==Gorilla press==
Also known as a &quot;Military press&quot;, the attack sees the wrestler lift their opponent up above their head with an overhead press as used in weight lifting. The attacking wrestler may repeatedly press the opponent overhead to show their strength prior to dropping them.
===Gorilla press drop===
The wrestler lifts their opponent up over their head with arms fully extended, then drops the opponent down face-first in front or back. This was the finisher for wrestlers Chyna and the Ultimate Warrior. It is a popular technique for very large wrestlers because it emphasizes their height and power.

===Gorilla press slam===
This slam sees a wrestler first lift their opponent up over their head with arms fully extended, before lowering the arm under the head of the opponent so that the opponent falls to that side while flipping over and landing on their back. This move is also called the &quot;military press slam&quot;. Some wrestlers perform this maneuver by doing a lifting motion up and down or may hold the opponent in place before dropping them as a way to emphasize their raw strength. The British Bulldog used it regularly as signature move.

Another variation of this move called a &quot;Deadly Driver&quot; sees the attacker performing this move to an opponent who is positioned on the top rope by the attacker themselves or as a counter to the opponent attempting a diving attack. This move can be done in the standard fashion or in a smooth throwing motion. A double-team version of this move also exists.

==Gutbuster==
A gutbuster is any move in which the wrestler lifts their opponent up and jumps or drops him/her so that the opponent&#x27;s stomach impacts against part of the wrestler&#x27;s body, usually the knee. A basic gutbuster is often called a stomach breaker and is essentially the same as a backbreaker but with the opponent facing the opposite direction. This similarity with backbreakers is reflected in almost every gutbuster variation, which if inverted would become backbreakers and vice versa.

===Elevated gutbuster===

This variation of a gutbuster sees an opponent first elevated into a high lifting transition hold before being dropped down for a gutbuster. Taiji Ishimori uses a Single underhook version of the move as his finisher calling it the &quot;Bloody Cross&quot; while T. J. Perkins uses a double chickenwing version.

====Fireman&#x27;s carry gutbuster====
This is the most common version of the elevated gutbuster and sees the attacking wrestler first lift the opponent up across their shoulders; a position known as a fireman&#x27;s carry, before then dropping down to one knee while simultaneously elevating the opponent over their head forcing them to drop down and impact their exposed knee. Wrestler Kaitlyn uses this as one of her signature move. A slight variation of this uses a modified double knee gutbuster and sees the attacking wrestler drop down to their back while bringing &quot;both&quot; knees up for the opponent to land on. Darren Young used the move as his finisher calling it &quot;Gut Check&quot;. The move was popularized by Roderick Strong, who calls it &quot;Death By Roderick&quot;.

====Gutbuster drop====
An elevated gutbuster in which an attacking wrestler would lift an opponent up, stomach-first, across one of their shoulders before dropping down to their knees forcing the opponent&#x27;s stomach to impact on the wrestler&#x27;s shoulder.

===Gorilla press gutbuster===
A maneuver in which the user drops the opponent directly in front of them while putting their own knee out in front of them. The victim lands stomach or ribs first on the knee, made more impactful by the long drop. the double-knee variant was popularized by Xavier Woods.

===Rib breaker===
A rib breaker is a version of a gutbuster that involves the wrestler scooping the opponent up by reaching between the legs of the opponent with one arm and reaching around their back from the same side with their other arm. The wrestler then lifts their opponent up so they are horizontal across the wrestler&#x27;s body. From here the wrestler drops down to one knee, forcing the opponent to drop stomach/rib-first against the wrestler&#x27;s raised knee.

==Headlock takedown==
Also known as a spinning headlock takedown and side headlock takeover. This throw starts with the wrestler catching the opponent in a side headlock. The wrestler turns and twists their body so their back is horizontally against the opponent&#x27;s torso. The wrestler turns to one side (depending on which hand is used to catch the opponent) while still catching the opponent with the headlock. Therefore, the opponent is slammed back-first into the mat after being almost &quot;forcibly flipped&quot; over the wrestler&#x27;s back (as the wrestler turns to their sides).

===Headlock driver===

Similar to the snapmare driver, the wrestler applies a side headlock before dropping down on either their chest or their knees and driving the opponent&#x27;s head down to the mat forehead first, with the side headlock usually using whichever near leg on the same side the opponent is standing on, lifting it upwards and swinging behind them to power the throw and drives the opponent&#x27;s head down to the mat forehead first. The wrestling may also sweep one or both the opponent&#x27;s legs with their own leg for greater impact.. This was the original version of the finisher used by Jon Moxley (formerly as Dean Ambrose), known as &quot;Dirty Deeds&quot; before reusing as a regular move (Paradigm Shift) in 2019. Ethan Carter III (EC3) uses this as his finisher and he calls it the &quot;One Percenter&quot;. WWE superstar Bayley utilized this move during her indie days (then known as Davina Rose) dubbing it the &quot;Rose Plant.&quot; She started using a variant of this move where she hooks the opponents arm around the leg and planting the opponent in the canvas. She started using this move again in late 2019.

==Headscissors takedown==

Known as &quot;tijeras&quot; (scissors) in Lucha Libre. This move is performed with the wrestler&#x27;s legs scissored around the opponent&#x27;s head, dragging the opponent into a forced forward somersault as the wrestler falls to the mat. It is often erroneously called the Hurricanrana in American wrestling, but due to the lack of a double leg cradle pinning combination, it is a standard headscissors takedown.

Rey Mysterio uses a standing spinning version of this move which sees him, while standing behind the a standing opponent facing same direction, he jumps placing himself on both the opponents shoulders, spins around 180 degrees, and executes the backflip to land chest first to flip the opponent onto their back. This version is known as the &quot;Mysterio Rana&quot;. He was also known to transition into this move from a cartwheel to then jump onto the opponent&#x27;s shoulders in his earlier career. It&#x27;s possible to stay seated to reach back to hook the opponents legs to attempt to score a pinfall.

===Handstand headscissors takedown===
This move is performed when the attacking wrestler, in a handstand position, scissors their legs around the opponent&#x27;s head and follows with the headscissors takedown. There are multiple variations of the handstand headscissors takedown. For example, in one variation, the attacking wrestler rolls forward after scissoring their legs around their opponent&#x27;s head; in another, the opponent rolls backwards into a handstand position to follow with a headscissors and the takedown.
It is commonly used by Kalisto and Cedric Alexander. This move was also popularized by Trish Stratus, who used it as a signature move, called the &quot;Stratusphere&quot;.

===Tilt-a-whirl headscissors takedown===
This move is actually a counter. Usually, the opponent grabs the attacking wrestler (as if he were performing a sidewalk slam), the attacking counters and swings their body upwards, then scissors their legs around the opponent&#x27;s head, spins around the opponent&#x27;s body, and swings their legs downwards, resulting in the headscissors takedown.

===Hurricanrana===
Though it is commonly referred to as a &quot;Hurricanrana&quot;, the original Spanish name for this maneuver is the &quot;Hurracarrana&quot;. The name was taken from its innovator, Mexican luchador Huracán Ramírez. Sometimes referred to as a reverse victory roll, it is a headscissors takedown that ends in a double leg cradle pinning hold. (A rana is any double-leg cradle.) A somersault version also exists, called the Dragonrana.

====Frankensteiner====
This move is derived from the original hurricanrana. It is described as a head scissors take down that is performed against a running opponent. The wrestler jumps on the shoulders of the charging opponent and performs a back flip. The move varies from the hurricanrana as when the opponent lands – he/she would land on their head as opposed to their back.

It was named the &quot;Frankensteiner&quot; by Scott Steiner, who used it as a finishing move. The move also has a variation where the opponent is sitting on the top rope, that variation is also referred to as a &quot;Frankensteiner&quot; that Scott has used as a finisher also.

Another variation of the Frankensteiner sees a grounded wrestler first &quot;kip-up&quot; on to a standing opponent&#x27;s shoulders, this is where a wrestler rolls on to the back of their shoulders bringing their legs up and kicking forward to build momentum to lift themselves off the floor and on to the standing opponent.

====Hurricanrana driver====
The wrestler performs a headscissors takedown to a seated or kneeling opponent, driving them head first into the mat. Ruby Soho and Kalisto use this move in some of their matches.

=====Reverse Frankensteiner=====
Also known as an inverted frankensteiner or a poison rana, this move uses a standard Frankensteiner, but instead of performing the move facing the opponent&#x27;s face, it is done facing the back of the opponent.

====Rope-aided hurricanrana====

This maneuver is also known as &quot;swinging hurricanrana&quot;. The attacking wrestler, beginning on the corner, uses the top ropes for leverage to scissor their legs around the opponent (usually an oncoming opponent) and swings to perform the hurricanrana. This hurricanrana variation was popularized by Mickie James, as she named the move herself &quot;Mick-a-rana&quot;.

==Hip toss==
The wrestler stands next to the opponent with both facing the same direction, and the wrestler hooks their closest arm underneath and behind the opponent&#x27;s closest armpit. The wrestler then quickly lifts the opponent up with that arm and throws them forward, which would lead the wrestler to flip the opponent on to their back to end the move. There is also a sitout variation, in which the wrestler performs a normal hip toss and then lands in a seated position.

==Iconoclasm==
This top rope flipping slam sees a wrestler stand under an opponent, who is situated on the top turnbuckle, turn their back to this opponent while taking hold of the opponent&#x27;s arms from below, often holding underneath the opponent&#x27;s arm pits. The wrestler would then throw the opponent forward while falling to a seated position, flipping the opponent over in midair, and slamming them down to the mat back first. CIMA uses both this move as well as a straight jacket version called the &quot;Goriconoslasm&quot;. The wrestler may fall forward, kneel down, or remain standing while executing this move also.

Lance Archer, while using the original move as well, also uses a variation of this move referring to both called the &quot;Blackout&quot;. From a standing position, he reaches between an opponent&#x27;s legs with his stronger arm and reaches around their back from the same side with their weaker arm before then lifting the opponent up over his shoulder. He then lifts the opponent holding underneath their armpits to execute a kneeling version of the slam.

==Irish whip==

Also called a hammer throw. A move in which the wrestler grabs one of their opponent&#x27;s arms and spins, swinging the opponent into an obstacle such as the ring ropes, a turnbuckle, or the stairs leading into the ring. An Irish whip into the ring ropes is usually used to set the opponent up for another technique as he/she bounces off. An Irish whip into the turnbuckles usually sees the opponent remain in the corner, allowing a follow-up attack from the wrestler; the opponent may remain standing or slump to the ground, usually in a seated position, which will vary the attack. One occasional use of the Irish whip is to try to &quot;hit for the cycle&quot; by whipping one&#x27;s opponent into each corner in turn. Some professional wrestlers can use this move as an advantage by running up the turnbuckle and using a high flying move.

The move acquired its name due to its association with Irish wrestler Danno O&#x27;Mahony.

==Jawbreaker==
A jawbreaker is any move in which the wrestler slams their opponent&#x27;s jaw against a part of the wrestler&#x27;s body, usually their knee, head or shoulder.

===Shoulder jawbreaker===
Also known as an inverted stunner, the wrestler stands facing the opponent, places their shoulder under the jaw of the opponent and holds the opponent in place before falling into a sitting or kneeling position, driving the jaw of the opponent into their shoulder.

===Sitout jawbreaker===
A standard jawbreaker is seen when a wrestler (either stands facing or not facing opponent) places their head under the jaw of the opponent and holds the opponent in place before falling into a sitting or kneeling position, driving the jaw of the opponent into the top of their head. Sometimes it is also used to counter a headlock by the opponent.

===Stunner===

A stunner is a three-quarter facelock jawbreaker. It involves an attacking wrestler applying a three-quarter facelock (reaching behind the head of an opponent, thus pulling the opponent&#x27;s jaw above the wrestler&#x27;s shoulder) before falling to a seated position and forcing the defender&#x27;s jaw to drop down on the shoulder of the attacking wrestler. This move was innovated by Mikey Whipwreck and popularized by Stone Cold Steve Austin.

==Mat slam==
A mat slam is any move in which the wrestler forces the back of the opponent&#x27;s head into the mat which does not involve a headlock or facelock. If these are used then the move is considered a type of DDT (if the wrestler falls backwards) or bulldog. Some neckbreakers also slam the back of the opponent&#x27;s head into the mat, but the attacker is back-to-back with the attack&#x27;s receiver. A standard mat slam involves the wrestler grabbing hold of the opponent by their head or hair and pulling back, forcing the back of the opponent&#x27;s head into the mat.

===Belly-to-back inverted mat slam===

From a position in which the opponent is bent forward against the wrestler&#x27;s midsection, the wrestler grabs around his or her opponent&#x27;s midsection and lifts so that the opponent is held upside down, facing in the same direction as the wrestler. The wrestler then hooks both arms of the opponent using his or her legs, and then falls forward planting the opponent&#x27;s body into the mat face-first. The move often sees the wrestler keep their legs hooked under the arms of the opponent after hitting the move, using the underhooking technique to turn the opponent on to their back into a Rana style pinning position. This move was innovated by Col. DeBeers and was made famous by A.J. Styles, who refers to the move as the &quot;Styles Clash&quot;. Styles performs the maneuver with a variation, as seen in the photos to the right: he does not hook the opponent&#x27;s arms before performing the slam, but takes two steps and moves his legs in front of the opponent&#x27;s arms enabling him to use his legs to cover the shoulders for a pin. This variant is later utilized by former WWE Diva Michelle McCool, who referred to the move as the &quot;Faith Breaker&quot;. Claudio Castagnoli uses a variation called the &quot;Neutralizer&quot; where he grapevines the opponents leg with his arm similar to a cradle piledriver. El Phantasmo uses a cross-arm Variation called CRII, where he lifts his opponent up and he lets him fall face first into the mat.

===Cobra clutch mat slam===
In this standing version of the normal mat slam, the wrestler stands behind the opponent and uses one arm to place the opponent in a half nelson. The wrestler then uses their free arm to pull the opponent&#x27;s arm (the same arm to which the wrestler is applying the half nelson) across the face of the opponent. The wrestler then locks their hand to their wrist behind the opponent&#x27;s neck. The wrestler then pulls back, releasing the hold to force the back of the opponent&#x27;s head into the mat. Drew McIntyre used a variation of the move earlier in his career in which after placing and holding the opponent in the cobra clutch, saw him walk the opponent backwards to bounce them of the ropes forcing them forwards to then slam them on the back of their head for greater force.

===Double underhook mat slam===
The wrestler faces an opponent, overhooks both arms, and then pivots 180° so that the opponent is facing upwards with his or her head pressed against the upper back or under an arm of the wrestler. The wrestler then drops down to their back, driving the back of the opponent&#x27;s head and neck into the mat.

===Rear mat slam===
As well known as a falling rear mat slam. This move starts with the wrestler standing behind the opponent, and then takes hold of the front of the neck or head, and then falls onto his stomach, driving the opponent&#x27;s back of the head into the mat first. Another variation of this move sees the wrestler performing a backflip from the top turnbuckle, and as he floats over the opponent, he quickly grabs the opponent&#x27;s head or neck with both hands and falls on his stomach to complete the rear mat slam.

====Sitout rear mat slam====
The wrestler takes hold of their opponent from behind, holding them by either their hair or head. The wrestler then jumps backwards and falls to a sitting position, driving the back of the opponent&#x27;s head into the ground between their legs. This was a signature move for Edge, which he called &quot;Edge-O-Matic&quot;. A variation sees the wrestler run up the corner turnbuckles, perform a backflip over a chasing opponent, and at the same time grab hold of the opponents head and perform the slam. Dustin Rhodes during his time in the WWF/WWE as Goldust used this move dubbing it &quot;Oscar&quot;.

===Sleeper slam===
This slamming version of a headlock takedown sees a wrestler apply a sleeper hold to the opponent, then falls face first to the ground, pulling the opponent down with them and driving the back and head of the opponent into the ground. Heath uses a jumping variation of the move. A lifting version also exists, where a wrestler applies a sleeper hold to the opponent, lifts the opponent up and slams the opponent into the ground.

===Slingblade===
A spinning sit-out variation of a sleeper slam that makes use of the wrestler&#x27;s own momentum. The attacking wrestler starts by running and extending his arm like a lariat takedown but instead performs a revolution around the opponent&#x27;s shoulders. This causes the wrestler to switch to his opposite arm before taking his opponent down to the mat while simultaneously landing in a seated position. Another variation involves the wrestler leaping off the ropes before performing the movement. The move is used by Hiroshi Tanahashi, with some commentators even calling the move a &#x27;Tanahashi&#x27; when anybody performs it due to how associated it is with him. Other users include Pentagon Jr., JTG, Seth Rollins, Masato Yoshino and Finn Bálor, with JTG calling it &quot;Da Shout Out&quot; and Bálor using it as the first move in a signature three-move combo to set up for his finisher. Richie Steamboat even used this as a finisher move during his time in FCW and NXT.

===Tilt-a-whirl mat slam===
As the name suggests the wrestler would first use a tilt-a-whirl to raise the opponent into a belly-to-belly (piledriver) position, from here the wrestler would fall forward planting the opponent into the mat back-first. Matt Riddle uses a cradle variant dubbed the &quot;Bro-Derek&quot;.

==Monkey flip==
This move, often referred to as a monkey climb in British wrestling, involves an attacking wrestler, who is standing face-to-face with an opponent, hooking both hands around the opponent&#x27;s head before then bringing up both legs so that they place their feet on the hips/waist of the opponent, making the head hold and the wrestlers&#x27; sense of balance the only things allowing both wrestlers to be in an upright position. At this point, the attacking wrestler shifts their weight so that they fall backwards to the mat while forcing the opponent to fall forwards with them, only to have the attacking wrestler push up with their legs, forcing the opponent to flip forward, over the wrestler&#x27;s head and onto their back. This move is most commonly performed out of a ring corner. This is due to it being easier to climb on an opponent while in the corner as balance is easily retained, and it allows the maximum length of ring to propel the opponent across.

==Muscle buster==

Invented by Kodo Fuyuki and inspired by Chamaco Valaguez&#x27;s &quot;La Valagueza&quot; submission maneuver, this move is performed when an attacking wrestler hooks both an opponent&#x27;s legs with their arms and tucks their head in next to the opponent&#x27;s before standing and lifting the opponent up, so that they are upside down with their head resting on the attacking wrestler&#x27;s shoulder. From this position, the attacking wrestler jumps up and drops down to the mat, driving the opponent shoulder first down to the mat with the opponent&#x27;s neck impacting both the wrestler&#x27;s shoulder and the mat. This can see the wrestler pick up an opponent who is standing but bent forward, but it often begins with an opponent who is sitting on an elevated position, usually on a top turnbuckle, because it is easier to hook and lift an opponent when they are positioned higher than the wrestler. The move also has a neckbreaker variation, which focuses more of the attack on the opponent&#x27;s neck. This move originated from the &quot;Kinnikuman&quot; manga, originally known as the Kinniku Buster (&quot;kinniku&quot; being Japanese for &quot;muscle&quot;), with the move ending with the opponent crashing down on their neck against the attacking wrestler&#x27;s shoulder. This variation is currently used by Jungle Kyona as the “Jungle Buster”.

Popularized by Samoa Joe as one of his finishers (he uses an electric chair version falling backwards, sparing the opponent&#x27;s neck) until 2015 when he accidentally injured Tyson Kidd, which ended his wrestling career and almost paralyzed him. He would re-use the move in 2022 at AEW. Ryback uses a different variation as his finisher, called &quot;Shell Shocked&quot;, where he lifts the opponent into position with a fisherman&#x27;s suplex and only hooks one of the opponent&#x27;s legs before running forward and dropping them off his shoulders, in a Samoan drop-esque motion.

==Neckbreaker==

There are two general categories of neckbreaker, which are related only in that they attack the opponent&#x27;s neck. One category of neckbreaker is the type of move in which the wrestler slams their opponent&#x27;s neck against a part of the wrestler&#x27;s body, usually their knee, head or shoulder. A neckbreaker slam is another technique in which the wrestler throws their opponent to the ground by twisting the opponent&#x27;s neck.

===Cutter===

A cutter is a three-quarter facelock neckbreaker. This move sees an attacking wrestler, while facing away from the opponent, apply a three-quarter facelock (reaching back and grabbing the head of the opponent, thus pulling the opponent&#x27;s jaw above the wrestler&#x27;s shoulder) before falling backwards (sometimes after running forwards first) to force the opponent face-first to the mat below. The most notable users of this move are Diamond Dallas Page, referring to the move as the &quot;diamond cutter&quot;, and Randy Orton, best known as the &quot;RKO&quot;.

==Piledriver==

Whilst giving the illusions of slamming the opponent&#x27;s head into the ground, a properly executed standard piledriver has the opponent&#x27;s head barely touching the ground, if at all. The technique is said to have been innovated by Wild Bill Longson.

==Powerbomb==

A powerbomb is a move in which an opponent is lifted into the air and then slammed down back-first to the mat. The standard powerbomb sees the opponent placed in a standing headscissors position (bent forward with their head placed between the wrestler&#x27;s thighs), lifted on the wrestler&#x27;s shoulders, and slammed back-first down to the mat. The move was innovated by Lou Thesz. This move was used as a finisher for wrestlers such as Batista, The Undertaker, Kevin Nash, Chyna, JBL, among others.

==Powerslam==

A powerslam is any slam in which the wrestler performing the technique falls face-down on top of their opponent. The use of the term &quot;powerslam&quot; usually refers to the front powerslam and the scoop powerslam.

==Pumphandle==

===Pumphandle drop===
Also known as a tilt slam or a pumphandle falling powerslam, the wrestler stands behind their opponent and bends them forward. One of the opponent&#x27;s arms is pulled back between their legs and held, while the other arm is hooked. The wrestler then lifts their opponent up until they are parallel with the wrestler&#x27;s chest, then throws themselves forward, driving the back of the opponent into the ground with the weight of the wrestler atop them.

===Pumphandle fallaway slam===
The wrestler hooks up the opponent as a pumphandle slam, then the wrestler goes through the body movements for the fallaway slam, executing the release of the opponent as they enter the apex of the throw, instead of at or just past the apex of the throw like when one executes the fallaway slam. Usually the opponent then adds effort to gain extra rotations in the air for effect or to ensure that they do not take the bump on their side.

===Pumphandle slam===
The wrestler stands behind their opponent and bends them forward. One of the opponent&#x27;s arms is pulled back between their legs and held, while the other arm is hooked (pumphandle). The attacking wrestler uses the hold to lift the opponent up over their shoulder, while over the shoulder the attacking wrestler would fall forward to slam the opponent against the mat back-first, normally the type of powerslam delivered is a front powerslam. The move can also see other variations of a powerslam used, particularly into a sidewalk slam position. Rhea Ripley uses the move itself or a powerbomb version called &quot;Riptide&quot;.

====Sitout pumphandle slam====
The wrestler lifts the opponent as with a pumphandle slam, but falls to a sitting position and drops the opponent between their legs as with a michinoku driver II. Kenta Kobashi also used this move as a finisher as well, but his looked more like a sitout Powerbomb but with a pumphandle, he called this move the &quot;Kentucky Bomb&quot;.

==Scoop==

===Body slam===
A body slam is any move in which a wrestler picks up and throws an opponent down to the ground limp back-first. When used by itself, this term generally refers to a very basic variant for a scoop slam.

===Scoop slam===

Facing their opponent, the wrestler reaches between their opponent&#x27;s legs with their stronger arm and reaches around their back from the same side with their weaker arm. The wrestler lifts their opponent up and turns them upside down so that they are held up by the wrestler&#x27;s arm cradling their back. The wrestler then throws the opponent to the ground so that they land on their back. The opponent will often assist the slammer by placing their arm on the slammer&#x27;s thigh.

==Shin breaker==
The wrestler faces the opponent from the side, slightly behind, then tucks their head under the opponent&#x27;s near armpit and grabs hold of the opponent&#x27;s near leg, bending it fully. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up and slams them downwards, driving one of the wrestler&#x27;s knees into the opponent&#x27;s bent leg. This move is used to weaken the leg for a submission manoeuvre.

==Shoulderbreaker==
A shoulderbreaker is any move in which the wrestler slams their opponent&#x27;s shoulder against any part of the wrestler&#x27;s body, usually the shin or knee. This move is normally used to weaken the arm for a submission maneuver or to make it more difficult for the opponent to kick out of a possible pinfall attempt. The most common version sees the wrestler turn the opponent upside-down and drop the opponent shoulder-first on the wrestler&#x27;s knee. Usually the opponent is held over the wrestler&#x27;s shoulder in either a powerslam position, or less commonly an inverted powerslam position for what is sometimes called the inverted shoulderbreaker.

==Snake eyes==
This move sees the standing wrestler place the opponent stomach down on their shoulder so that they both are facing the same direction. The attacking wrestler then drops the opponent face-first into the turnbuckle or ropes. This move is most commonly used by The Undertaker. Johnny Gargano uses a variation called &quot;Lawn Dart&quot;, where he throws the opponent face first onto the second turnbuckle.

==Snapmare==
With the wrestler&#x27;s back to the opponent, he/she applies a three-quarter facelock (also known as a cravate) and, either kneeling down or bending over, pulls the opponent forward, flipping them over their shoulder down to the mat, back first. Another variation, sometimes called a &quot;flying mare&quot;, sees the wrestler pull the opponent by the hair over their shoulder before slamming them to the mat.

===Rolling snapmare===
This variation of the snapmare sees the application of the facelock with the takeover to the opponent, but rather than the wrestler remaining stationary, he rolls with the opponent&#x27;s momentum.

===Snapmare driver===
A high impact variation of the snapmare where instead of flipping the opponent over, the wrestler drops down either on their chest or down on their knees, usually using whichever near leg on the same side the opponent is standing on, lifting it upwards and swinging behind them to power the throw and drives the opponent&#x27;s head down to the mat forehead first, with the three-quarter facelock much like a cutter. The wrestling may also sweep one or both the opponent&#x27;s legs with their own leg for greater impact. An inverted variation of this move also exists. However, the wrestler holds their opponent&#x27;s head in a back to back position, before performing the move. Adam Rose used this as the &quot;Party Foul&quot;. Melina used this move after her return in 2010, most notably to win her second Diva&#x27;s championship at SummerSlam 2010. . Madcap Moss uses a reverse neckbreaker like variation of this move, calling it the &quot;Punchline&quot;.

===Snapmare neckbreaker===
A high impact combination of the snapmare and the falling neckbreaker. With the wrestler&#x27;s back to the opponent, he/she applies a three-quarter facelock and then pulls the opponent forward, flipping them over their shoulder, before turning to land in a neckbreaker. Tyson Kidd briefly used this as his finisher in 2009.

==Spinebuster==
A spinebuster is a move in which the wrestler starts by facing his opponent and then grabs him around his waist, lifts him up, and then either slams the opponent down while landing on top of them, or tosses them forward on to their back. It was used as a signature and a finisher by wrestlers such as The Rock, Batista, Ron Simmons, Arn Anderson among others.

==Spinning crucifix toss==
The attacker lifts the opponent above his back with the opponent&#x27;s arm spread out in a crucifix hold, spins around multiple times in place, pushes the opponent up, and moves out of the way, dropping the opponent down to the mat. Kevin Nash used this move as a finisher during his time as his character Oz and called it the &quot;Oz Twister&quot;. James Storm currently uses this move calling it the &quot;Eye Of The Storm&quot;.

==Suplex==

A suplex is the same as the amateur suplex, a throw which involves arching/bridging either overhead or twisting to the side, so the opponent is slammed to the mat back-first. Though there are many variations, the term suplex (without qualifiers) can also refer specifically to the vertical suplex, Made famous by Terence Travis from Mossley Hill.

==Trips and sweeps==

===Armbar legsweep===
The wrestler stands beside their opponent to either side, crosses their arm against the opponent&#x27;s opposite hand in front of it (as the wrestler stands beside the opponent, and uses for example their right arm, they would cross it against the opponent&#x27;s left arm, and vice versa). From this point, the wrestler places their leg in front of the opponent&#x27;s opposite leg, and falls backwards, causing the opponent&#x27;s arm to be slammed into the mat.

===Double leg takedown===

A tackle where the intention is to force the opponent down on their back by tackling them at their waist or upper thighs. This usually involves grabbing the opponent with both arms around the opponent&#x27;s legs while keeping the chest close to the opponent, and using this position to force the opponent to the floor .

===Dragon screw legwhip===
Dragon screw legwhip (or simply Dragon screw) is a legwhip where a wrestler grabs an opponent&#x27;s leg and holds it parallel to the mat while they are facing each other. The attacking wrestler then spins the leg inwards causing the opponent to fall off balance and twist in the air bringing them to the ground in a turning motion. It is used by the &quot;Ace of the Universe&quot; Hiroshi Tanahashi

===Drop toe-hold===
The wrestler falls to the ground, placing one foot at the front of the opponent&#x27;s ankle and the other in the back of the calf. This causes the opponent to fall face first into the ground. It is sometimes used illegally to force an opponent into a chair or other elevated weapon; it is also used occasionally to force an opponent face-first into the turnbuckles, stunning them momentarily. This move can also be used by an already grounded wrestler as a counter to a standing or charging opponent.

===Half nelson legsweep===
The wrestler stands behind, slightly to one side of and facing the opponent. The wrestler reaches under one of the opponent&#x27;s arms with their corresponding arm and places the palm of their hand on the neck of the opponent, thereby forcing the arm of the opponent up into the air (the half nelson). The wrestler then uses their other arm to pull the opponent&#x27;s other arm behind the opponent&#x27;s head, so both opponent&#x27;s arms are pinned. The wrestler then hooks the opponent&#x27;s near leg and throws themselves backwards, driving the opponent back-first to the ground. This was the finisher of Byron Saxton, dubbed &quot;Saxonation&quot;.

===Russian legsweep===

Also known as a side Russian legsweep and called a neckbreaker by Gorilla Monsoon. This is a move in which a wrestler stands side-to-side and slightly behind with the opponent, facing in the same direction, and reaches behind the opponent&#x27;s back to hook the opponent&#x27;s head with the other hand extending the opponent&#x27;s nearest arm, then while hooking the opponent&#x27;s leg the wrestler falls backward, pulling the opponent to the mat back-first. There is also a jumping variation of the Russian legsweep, which is similar in execution to that of the leaping flatliner and different modified versions of the move.

====Cobra clutch legsweep====
Also called a &quot;Cobra clutch buster&quot;, the wrestler places their opponent in a cobra clutch, then stands to one side of the opponent, hooks their nearest foot behind their opponent&#x27;s nearest leg and throws themselves backwards, forcing their opponent backwards to the ground. Ted DiBiase and his son Ted DiBiase Jr have used this move as a finisher. Corporal Robinson uses this move as a finisher calling it the Boot Camp.

====Forward Russian legsweep====
The wrestler grabs the opponent by the arm and goes behind him while holding the arm and hooking the opponent&#x27;s leg. The wrestler then bends the opponent&#x27;s back and slams their face to the mat. The forward Russian legsweep was popularized by Jeff Jarrett, who began using the maneuver as a finisher in the late 1990s and calls it &quot;The Stroke&quot;.

=====Full nelson forward Russian legsweep=====
A slight variation of the forward Russian legsweep, the wrestler approaches the opponent from behind and places them in a full nelson before hooking their leg. The wrestler then falls forward in an almost identical way, slamming the opponent face-first into the mat. The most notable practitioner of this variant is The Miz, who calls the move the &quot;Skull Crushing Finale&quot; and has used it as a finisher since August 2009.

====Three-quarter facelock Russian legsweep====
The wrestler stands in front of, facing away from and slightly to one side of the opponent. The wrestler then reaches behind themselves and applies a three-quarter facelock to the opponent. The wrestler then hooks the opponent&#x27;s near leg with their own near leg and sweeps the leg away, simultaneously throwing themselves backwards, thus driving the opponent to the ground (with the weight of the wrestler on top of them) and wrenching the opponent&#x27;s neck. Former WCW wrestler Lash Leroux is best known for using this move as a finisher which he calls the &quot;Whiplash &#x27;00&quot;.

===Schoolboy sweep===

This technique gives its name to the schoolboy bump and is performed when the wrestler gets behind their opponent, drops down to their knees, puts their hand through the opponent&#x27;s legs, hooking the opponent&#x27;s hips, and pulls backwards. This pulls the opponent backwards, with straightened and trapped legs, forcing the opponent to fall backwards, over the wrestler, flat on the floor.

===STO===
The STO (Space Tornado Ogawa) is a sweep in which a wrestler wraps one arm across the chest of their opponent and sweeps the opponent&#x27;s leg with their own leg to slam the other wrestler back-first. This can also be a lariat-legsweep combination to slam down the opponent. This is also a move used often in Judo and in other grappling martial arts. This maneuver can be used running and standing. Innovated by &quot;Black Gordman&quot; during the 70s and 80s before utilized by Japanese silver medalist judoka Naoya Ogawa. Evil currently used this as &quot;Evil&quot;. Shad Gaspard used a high impact variant of this move called &quot;Thugnificent&quot;. Johnny Gargano uses a Full Nelson and reverse variant of this move called &quot;Hurts Donut&quot; (formerly referred to as &quot;Uniquely You&quot;).

====Arm trap cradle somersault STO====
The wrestler faces the opponent, ducks under the opponent&#x27;s arm closest to them, wraps their closest arm around the waist of the opponent and then quickly performs a forward flip whilst sweeping the opponent&#x27;s leg, thereby dropping the opponent on their back, ending up in a cradle pin. This move was innovated by Madoka as &quot;Ranhei&quot;. It was also made popular by Kofi Kingston, who calls it the &quot;S.O.S&quot;.

====Chokehold STO====

This move is an STO where the wrestler would first apply a chokehold with one hand before sweeping their opponent&#x27;s leg. Alexa Bliss uses this as a signature move, normally followed by her rope-assisted repeated stomps.

====Front facelock STO====
This variation of the STO sees the attacker apply a front facelock on his opponent and sweeping the opponent&#x27;s leg and falling forward, with the opponent landing on his neck and shoulders. A pinning variation also exists where the attacker keeps the front facelock applied as he covers the opponent slightly.

===Flatliner===
Well known as the complete shot or reverse STO, this is a move in which a wrestler stands side-to-side and slightly behind with the opponent, facing in the opposite direction, and reaches around the opponent&#x27;s torso with one arm across the opponent&#x27;s chest with their hand holding on to their other hand which is behind the opponent&#x27;s head. The wrestler then falls backward, driving the opponent into the mat face-first. The wrestler can also cross their leg between the opponent&#x27;s leg before hitting the reverse STO, with this slight variation being known as a leg hook reverse STO.It was innovated by Gedo.

==== Arm trap flatliner ====
This move sees the wrestler stand side to side with the opponent, tucking his arm behind the opponent&#x27;s head at a 90° angle and putting his near leg in front of the opponent&#x27;s closest leg. The wrestler then pushes the opponent forward and quickly pulls them backward, with the attacker landing on their back whilst the opponent falls face first.

==== Elevated flatliner ====
In this variation the wrestler first locks the opponent in a standard flatliner lock, then sees the opponent and put his ankles on some elevated surface (usually top rope, or turnbuckle, or barricade outside of the ring), the wrestler then falls backward, driving the opponent face-first into the mat. Another variation of this move including the opponent standing on the apron outside of the ring, and attacking wrestler first grabs opponent and pulls him over the top rope until opponent&#x27;s ankles match the ropes, the attacking wrestler then falls backward, driving the opponent face-first into the mat. Tommaso Ciampa used this move at NXT TakeOver: Toronto in a match against Scott Dawson.

==== Gory Special Swinging flatliner ====
The wrestler locks a back-to-back backbreaker submission in (better known as the &quot;Gory Special&quot;) and then drops the opponent into a Swinging flatliner. Popularized by Brian Cage as &quot;Weapon X&quot;.

==== Leaping flatliner ====
A variation of the flatliner, this move see the wrestler jumping up towards the side of an opponent and grabbing his head before falling backwards onto the mat, planting the opponent face-first. The move has been used by various professional wrestlers like Mil Muertes (&quot;Straight to Hell&quot;), Shelton Benjamin (&quot;Paydirt&quot;), Montel Vontavious Porter (the &quot;Play of the Day/305&quot;) and R-Truth (&quot;Lil&#x27; Jimmy&quot;). Liv Morgan uses this move as her finisher when her opponent is standing with the support of the ring ropes which she calls the &quot;ObLIVion&quot;.

==== Lifting flatliner ====
A slight variation of the flatliner, this move sees a wrestler perform exactly the same set-up but instead of falling backward immediately, they lift the opponent before dropping them face-first into the mat, making it similar to a flapjack. It was innovated by Chris Kanyon. Baron Corbin&#x27;s finisher is a variant of this move called the &quot;End of Days&quot; while Angelina Love uses the move as a signature (previously a finisher) called &quot;Lights Out&quot;. Another variation of this move involves using a pumphandle lift where the wrestler sets the opponent up for a pumphandle hold and then lifts them into the execution of the move. Pete Dunne uses this variation as a finisher previously calling it &quot;Drop Dead&quot; but now known as the &quot;Bitter End&quot;. Damian Priest recently started using this move as a finisher after Cody Rhodes returned to the WWE in 2022.

Austin Theory uses a flipping version of this move in which, to a bent over opponent, he hooks his opponent&#x27;s near arm with his far arm and hooks their near leg with his near arm. He then lifts the opponent off the mat flipping them in a 450 style motion forwards while simultaneously falling backwards to catch the falling them with his near arm completing the rotation and dropping them into the facebuster. He calls this move &quot;Ataxia&quot;.

==== Sliding flatliner ====
Also known as a &quot;low flatliner&quot;, this variation sees the opponent perform a flatliner on a kneeling opponent, either by normally setting up a flatliner, leaping or running towards the opponent before executing the move.

==== Swinging flatliner ====
Another variation of the flatliner, this move sees a wrestler grab their opponent around their neck and lean them backwards. The wrestler then swings their opponent around, slamming them face-first into the mat. Alex Shelley uses it as one of his pinfall finishers which is called &quot;Shellshock&quot;. Bray Wyatt used this maneuver as his finisher, which was referred to as &quot;Sister Abigail&quot;. NJPW/AEW wrestler Switchblade Jay White uses a variation called &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Knux calls it the &quot;Knuxout&quot;. Alexa Bliss currently uses this move as a finisher but with a different twist. Lexis King uses a snap variation of the move called &quot;The Coronation&quot;.

<doc id="467966" wikidata="Q2423981" url="?curid=467966" title="Żupan">
<text>Żupan (; , , , , , ) is a long lined garment of West or Central Asian origin which was widely worn by male nobles in the multi-ethnic Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and by the Ukrainian Cossacks in the Cossack Hetmanate. It was a typical upper class male attire from the late 16th to the first half of the 18th century.

== Derivation ==
The name żupan has other spelling variations—&quot;czupan&quot; (from czupkan, a Crimean Tatar word or alternatively from zuban or ziban—a Turkic word according to Julian Horoszkiewicz), etymologically related to the Central Asian chapan and also the Japanese juban. Alternatively, the name originates from the Italian word &quot;giuppa&quot; (gown) which in turn might have come from Arabic (jubba), although the garment itself probably is of Central Asian nomadic origin. or from Middle English / Middle French jupon (an overcoat for armour). Whether the garment came from Central Asia or Ottoman Turkey or Iran still remains a question, and the same applies to the allied male garment—the kontusz. The Central Asian origin of this garment may be also deduced from the method of closure of the pre-1680s zupans, for they were closed from right to left—typical to Central Asian fashion, while the sleeve-ends terminated with dog-ears that were almost like gloves without covering the fingers, and were usually upturned to show the differently colored lining. Eventually an agraffe (clasp) or button was attached to this dog-ear sleeve-end to pin it to a sleeve once upturned and thus a cuff was created. This style of cuff was known in the Louis XIV period in France as the Polish cuff and might have led to the development of colorful military cuffs used in West European armies from 18th century onwards.

After the partition of Ukraine in 1663 (The Ruin), the inhabitants of Left Bank Ukraine continued to wear żupan, the name transliterated into , and also adopted the kontusz from their Right Bank counterparts as part of their dress, and therefore żupan was worn by Ukrainian nobility, wealthy merchants, cossacks, wealthier peasants and town dwellers.

== Development ==
During the 16th century the żupan was a popular male costume worn in the territory of the Polish Kingdom and Grand Duchy of Lithuania, these being after 1569 the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Males of all social classes wore it, although only those of the nobility (szlachta) were made of the most expensive and colorful textiles, whilst sumptuary laws and expense restricted the colors and richness of the constituent textiles of żupan of men of lesser social class. The earliest known mention of żupan was in 1393, and the costume gradually was adopted during the 16th century as the customary national garment for men, first by nobility and later by the lesser social classes.

The żupan was a long, robe-like, long-sleeved garment that opened and closed in the front with a row of buttons. Later these buttons were frequently decorative buttons denominated &quot;guzy&quot;. Since the 1570s the garment also had a collar. This basic design did not change except for the size and cut of the collar, and the kind of composing fabric. Until the 1660s the collars were tall, and then gradually they were shortened and their corners rounded and framed an opening. At first the żupan served as an outer garment and was made from sturdy cloth or wool, was often lined with fur, and was worn with a belt from which nobility hung a sword. Nobles and the affluent, such as merchants, wore it underneath customary outer garments like the bekiesza, delia, ferezja, szuba, and burka. Gradually the garment was made lighter for wear underneath the kontusz, while the belt became a colorful affair that was worn over the kontusz. In case of poorer nobles and men of lesser social class it remained an outer garment until its abandonment, while affluent burghers wore it as an inner garment along with the kontusz and other outer garments, in the fashion of nobility.

In Polish military use both cavalry and infantry wore the żupan as the sole outer garment. Polish heavy cavalry (hussars) and medial cavalry (pancerni) wore it immediately beneath armor. A padded iteration derived from Central Asian custom was perhaps denominated an &quot;arming coat&quot;; an example of this is in the Polish Army Museum. The common, shorter, iteration for cavalry was denominated the &quot;żupanik&quot;.

After the 1680s the żupan was customarily worn beneath a kontusz, and in such combination the two garments became the customary attire for Ukrainian cossacks and the Polish national costume for men until the mid-19th century.

== Construction and color ==
Żupans were made of many fabrics as were available to the szlachta or the lower classes. Magnates generally wore żupans sporting golden or jewelled buttons, and tailored from the most expensive fabrics of their times such as the very expensive Persian fabric known as crimson, which won their wearers the name, &quot;karmazyni&quot; or &quot;crimson men&quot;, then from various expensive silkbased fabrics like satins, brocades and damascs. Richer szlachta emulated the magnates with cheaper versions of silk-and-linen fabrics while the lower levels of szlachta usually wore żupans made out of cheaper white linen (summer) or duller in colour varieties of wool (winter), hence their nickname, &quot;szaraczkowie&quot; — &quot;grey men&quot;. Colors of Żupan varied, however the lining was always of a different color than the outer fabric.

Other social classes tried to emulate the szlachta. Poorer townsfolk often wore yellowish żupans made from hemp, which resulted in them being nicknamed &quot;łyczki&quot;. Polish Jews wore black żupans, and peasants wore simple, white (summer) and greyish (winter) żupans from wool or simple cloth.

In 18th-century Poland, the żupan became even lighter, with long and narrow sleeves, while the unseen back was tailored from some inexpensive fabrics such as linen or cotton. It then assumed its final version (when worn with the kontusz and wide, colourful fabric belt) and survived into the 19th century as a part of the Polish &quot;national dress&quot; — integral to regional male costumes, including those of peasants.

<text>Earl of Verulam is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1815 for James Grimston, 4th Viscount Grimston. He was made Viscount Grimston (in the peerage of the United Kingdom) at the same time. Verulam had previously represented St Albans (Roman Verulamium) in the House of Commons. In 1808 he had also succeeded his maternal cousin as tenth [[Lord Forrester]] (in the Peerage of Scotland). He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl.

Grimston was a Tory politician and held minor office in the first two governments of the Earl of Derby. His son, the third Earl, represented St Albans in Parliament as a Conservative. His grandson, the sixth Earl (who succeeded his elder brother) was nominated to the traditionally safe seat of St Albans for the party. the titles are held by his son, the seventh Earl, who succeeded in 1973.

The titles of Viscount Grimston and Baron Dunboyne had been created in 1719 in the Peerage of Ireland for William Grimston, Member of Parliament for St Albans. Born William Luckyn, he was the great-nephew of Sir Samuel Grimston, 3rd Baronet, of Bradfield (a title which became extinct upon his death in 1700), whose surname he assumed on succeeding to his estates. In 1737 he also succeeded his elder brother as fifth Baronet of Little Waltham (see below). He was succeeded by his son, the second Viscount. He also represented St Albans in the House of Commons. His son, the third Viscount, was Member of Parliament for St Albans and Hertfordshire. In 1790 he was created Baron Verulam, of Gorhambury in the County of Hertford, in the Peerage of Great Britain. He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned fourth Viscount, who was created Earl of Verulam in 1815.

The Luckyn Baronetcy, of Little Waltham in the County of Essex, was created in the Baronetage of England in 1629 for William Luckyn. The second Baronet represented Harwich in Parliament. The fourth Baronet was succeeded by his younger brother, the aforementioned William Grimston, 1st Viscount Grimston.

Lord Verulam thus holds titles in England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom.

Another member of the Grimston family was Robert Grimston, 1st Baron Grimston of Westbury. He was the son of Reverend Canon the Hon. Robert Grimston, third son of the second Earl of Verulam.

The family seat is Gorhambury House, near St Michael, Hertfordshire.

<text>A župa, or zhupa, is a historical type of administrative division in Southeast Europe and Central Europe, that originated in medieval South Slavic culture, commonly translated as &quot;county&quot; or &quot;parish&quot;. It was mentioned for the first time in the eighth century and was initially used by the South and West Slavs, denoting various territorial units of which the leader was the župan. In modern Serbo-Croatian and Slovene, the term &quot;župa&quot; also refers to an ecclesiastical parish, while the related &quot;županija&quot; is used in Croatia and by Croats from Bosnia and Herzegovina (as a synonym for &quot;kanton&quot;) for lower administrative subdivisions.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;župa&quot; or &#x27; (Slovak and Czech: župa; Polish: żupa; Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian: жупа; adopted into and rendered in Greek as &quot;ζουπανία&quot; (, &quot;land ruled by a župan&quot;)), is derived from Slavic. Its medieval Latin equivalent was &#x27;. It is mostly translated into &quot;county&quot; or &quot;district&quot;. According to Kmietowicz, it seems that the territorial organization had been created in Polish territories before the Slav Migrations. Some Slavic nations changed its name into &quot;opole&quot;, &quot;okolina&quot;, &quot;kraj&quot; and &quot;vierw&quot;, but it has survived in &quot;župan&quot;. Some scholars consider the word&#x27;s older meaning was &quot;open area in the valley&quot;. This interpretation is confirmed by the Bulgarian &quot;župa&quot; (tomb), Polish &quot;zupa&quot; and Ukrainian &quot;župa&quot; (salt mine), and Old Slavonic &quot;župište&quot; (tomb). As such, the Proto-Slavic &quot;*župa&quot; wouldn&#x27;t derive from &#x27; (with &#x27; meaning &quot;bend, distort&quot;), yet from Indo-European &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;cavity, pit&quot;, which derives from Nostratic &quot;*gopa&quot; meaning &quot;hollow, empty&quot;. However, Aleksander Brückner suggested the opposite evolution; &quot;župa&quot; as a back formation from title &quot;župan&quot; (for the etymology see corresponding article), which is a borrowing from Iranian languages (*&quot;fsu-pāna&quot;, &quot;shepherd&quot;).

==Usage==
The division had a widespread distribution and did not always had a concrete institutional definition. The term &quot;župa&quot; was at first the territorial and administrative unit of a tribe but was later only an administrative unit without tribal features. The South Slavs that settled in Roman lands to a certain degree adopted Roman state organization, but retained their own tribal organization. Slavic tribes were divided into fraternities, each including a certain number of families. The territory inhabited by a tribe was a &quot;župa&quot;, and its leader was the &quot;župan&quot;.

The &quot;zhupa&quot; (plural &quot;zhupi&quot;) was an administrative unit in the First Bulgarian Empire, a subdivision of a larger unit called &quot;comitatus&quot;. In these countries, the equivalent of &quot;county&quot; is &quot;judet&quot; (from Latin &quot;judicium&quot;). The Croats and the Slovaks used the terms županija and župa for the counties in the Kingdom of Croatia and Kingdom of Hungary. German language translation of the word for those counties was &quot;komitat&quot; (from Latin &quot;comitatus&quot;, &quot;countship&quot;) during the Middle Ages, but later it was &quot;gespanschaft&quot; (picking up the &quot;span&quot; root that previously came from &quot;župan&quot;).

===Bosnia===

Territorial-political organization in medieval Bosnia was intricate, and composed on several levels. In this scheme in the territorial-political organizational order of the medieval Bosnian state, &quot;župa&quot; was basic unit of the state organization, with feudal estate at the bottom, followed by village municipality, both below &quot;župa&quot;, and &quot;zemlja&quot; above it, with the state monarch at the top. During the 15th century, disappearance of the old organization based on &quot;župas&quot; is observed. It is obvious that at some point the Bosnian largest landowning barons no longer needed them in its old organizational capacity.

===Croatia===
The Croatian word župa signifies both a secular unit (county) and a religious unit (parish), ruled over by a &quot;župan&quot; (count) and &quot;župnik&quot; (parish priest).

Croatian medieval state was divided into eleven &quot;ζουπανίας&quot; (zoupanias; župas), and the ban ruled over additional three župas Krbava, Lika, and Gacka).

Today the term &quot;županija&quot; is the name for the Croatian regional government, the counties of Croatia. Mayors of counties hold the title of &quot;župan&quot; (pl. &quot;župani&quot;), which is usually translated as &quot;county prefect&quot;. In the 19th century, the counties of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia were called &quot;županija&quot;. The Croats preserved the term &quot;župa&quot; until the modern times as the name for local clerical units, parishes of the Catholic Church and of the Protestant churches. The parish priest is called &quot;župnik&quot;.

===Hungary===
In c. 1074, the župa is mentioned in Hungary as &quot;-spán&quot;, also as &quot;határispánságok&quot; (march, frontier county). The derivative titles were &quot;ispán&quot;, nominated by the king for not defined time, and gradually replaced by &quot;főispán&quot; in the 18-19th century; &quot;megyésispán&quot;, also nominated by the king but could be expelled anytime; &quot;alispán&quot; was the leader of the jurisdiction in the county if the &#x27;megyésispán&#x27; was not available; &quot;várispán&quot; was more linked to the &quot;vár&quot; (fortress) in Hungary in the times of Árpád.

===Serbia===
The Serbs in the Early Middle Ages were organized into &quot;župe&quot;, a confederation of village communities (roughly the equivalent of a county), headed by a local &quot;župan&quot; (a magistrate or governor). Thus the title of Grand Župan in Raška in 11th-12th century meant &quot;supreme župan&quot; of župans who ruled over župas.

&quot;Dušan&#x27;s Code&quot; (1349) named the administrative hierarchy as following: &quot;land(s), city(ies), župa(s) and krajište(s)&quot;, the župa(s) and krajište(s) were one and the same, with the župa on the border were called krajište (&quot;frontier&quot;). The župa consisted of villages, and their status, rights and obligations were regulated in the constitution. The ruling nobility possessed hereditary allodial estates, which were worked by dependent &quot;sebri&quot;, the equivalent of Greek &quot;paroikoi&quot;; peasants owing labour services, formally bound by decree.

Though the territorial unit today is unused, there are a number of traditional župe in Kosovo, around Prizren: Sredačka Župa, Sirinićka Župa, Gora, Opolje and Prizrenski Podgor. The Serbian language maintains the word in toponyms, the best known being that of the Župa Aleksandrovačka.

===Slovakia===
The term &quot;župa&quot; was popularized in Slovak professional literature in the 19th century as a synonym to contemporary Slovak term &quot;stolica&quot; (county). After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, it was used as the official name of administrative units of Slovakia within Czechoslovakia in 1919 – 1928 and then again in the Slovak Republic during WWII in 1940–1945. Nowadays, the term is used semi-officially as a short alternative name for the self-governing regions of Slovakia. The president of the self-governing region is semi-officially called &quot;župan&quot;.

===Slovenia===

In Slovenia, the mayor of a municipality has the title &quot;župan&quot;.
The name also survived in the clerical context, as parishes are called župnija (dual: župniji, plural: župnije). Colloquial parishes are also called &quot;fara&quot; (dual: fari, plural: fare).
A parish priest is called župnik (dual: župnika, plural: župniki).

<text>Earl of Oxford and Asquith is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1925 for the Liberal politician H. H. Asquith. He was Home Secretary from 1892 to 1895, Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1905 to 1908, Leader of the Liberal Party from 1908 to 1926 and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1908 to 1916. Asquith was made Viscount Asquith, of Morley in the West Riding of the County of York, at the same time, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title is used as a courtesy title by the heir apparent to the earldom.

Asquith had originally wanted to be created simply Earl of Oxford. However, this greatly offended the collaterals of the de Vere family, members of which had been earls of Oxford, for centuries and of the Harley family, members of which had been earls of Oxford and earls Mortimer. In the face of opposition from them, another title had to be selected – the formal title &#x27;Earl of Oxford and Asquith&#x27; was finally decided as a compromise, with it being abbreviated to &#x27;Earl of Oxford&#x27; in everyday conversation and letters, which still irritated the other families.

The first Earl was succeeded in 1928 by his grandson, his eldest son Raymond Asquith having been killed in World War I. The second Earl was a diplomat and administrator and served as Governor of the Seychelles from 1962 to 1967. He died in 2011 and was succeeded by his son, the third Earl and current holder of the title. The current Lord Oxford and Asquith is a retired diplomat.

Several other members of the Asquith family have also gained distinction. Raymond Asquith, eldest son of the first Earl and father of the second, was a barrister and intellectual. Herbert Asquith, second son of the first Earl, was a poet, novelist and lawyer. Arthur Melland Asquith (1883–1939), third son of the first Earl, was a Brigadier-General in the Army. Cyril Asquith, fourth son of the first Earl, was a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and was created a life peer as Baron Asquith of Bishopstone in 1951. Violet Asquith, better known under her married name of Violet Bonham Carter, was a Liberal politician and was created a life peer as Baroness Asquith of Yarnbury in 1964. Her eldest son Mark Bonham Carter was a publisher and politician and was created a life peer as Baron Bonham-Carter in 1986. His daughter is the life peer Jane Bonham Carter, Baroness Bonham-Carter of Yarnbury.

Raymond Bonham Carter, second son of Baroness Asquith of Yarnbury, was a banker and the father of the noted actress Helena Bonham Carter and of Edward Bonham Carter. Elizabeth Asquith (better known by her married name of Elizabeth Bibesco), the only daughter from the second marriage of the first Earl, was a moderately celebrated author who, for a short while, dated the Spanish grandee José Antonio Primo de Rivera (founder of FET y de las JONS) before marrying the Romanian lawyer, diplomat and writer Prince Antoine Bibesco in 1919. Anthony Asquith, only son from the second marriage of the first Earl, became a successful film director. Dominic Asquith, second son of the second Earl, is a prominent diplomat and served as British Ambassador to Iraq from 2006 to 2007. Margot Asquith (&quot;née&quot; Tennant), second wife of the first Earl, a socialite, author and wit, became the Countess of Oxford and Asquith upon her husband&#x27;s becoming the first Earl.

The family seat is Mells Manor, near Mells, Somerset.

<doc id="467974" wikidata="Q1678809" url="?curid=467974" title="Jamaica ginger">
<text>Jamaica ginger extract, known in the United States by the slang name Jake, was a late 19th-century patent medicine that provided a convenient way to obtain alcohol during the era of Prohibition, since it contained approximately 70% to 80% ethanol by weight. In the 1930s, a large number of users of Jamaica ginger were afflicted with a paralysis of the hands and feet that quickly became known as Jamaica ginger paralysis or jake paralysis.

==Composition==

While Jamaica ginger was essentially an infusion of ginger, the US government required solids to be added with the intention of making it less palatable as a way to obtain alcohol legally. The solids expected to be added were particles of ginger root, which made the &quot;medicine&quot; unpalatable. Manufacturers sought solids which impaired the taste less; tricresyl phosphate was used, which the producers later found to be a potent neurotoxin; adulterated Jake is estimated to have caused 30,000 to 50,000 people to lose function in their limbs. Trust in Jamaica Ginger was lost, and its production was discontinued.

==Early use and Prohibition==

Since the 1860s, Jamaica ginger had been widely sold at drug stores and roadside stands in bottles. In small doses, mixed with water, it was used as a remedy for headaches, upper respiratory infections, menstrual disorders, and intestinal gas. Despite its strong ginger flavour, it was popular as an alcoholic beverage in dry counties in the United States, where it was a convenient and legal method of obtaining alcohol. It was often mixed with a soft drink to improve the taste.

When Prohibition was enacted in 1920, sale of alcohol became illegal nationwide, prompting consumers to search for substitutes. Patent medicines with a high alcohol percentage, such as Jamaica ginger, became obvious choices, as they were legal and available over the counter without prescriptions. By 1921, the United States government made the original formulation of Jamaica ginger prescription-only. Only a fluid extract version defined in the United States Pharmacopeia, with a high content of bitter-tasting ginger oleoresin, remained available in stores. Because of the taste, it was classified as nonpotable, and was therefore legal to sell despite the alcohol content.

United States Department of Agriculture agents audited Jamaica ginger manufacturers by boiling samples and weighing the resulting solids, to make sure their products contained sufficiently high quantities of the bitter-tasting ginger. To make their products more palatable, manufacturers of Jamaica ginger began to illegally replace the ginger oleoresin with cheaper ingredients like molasses, glycerin, and castor oil, cutting costs and significantly diminishing the unpleasant ginger flavor.

==Victims==

=== Organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy ===
When the price of castor oil increased in the latter portion of the 1920s, Harry Gross, president of Hub Products Corporation, sought an alternative additive for his Jamaica ginger formula. He discarded ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol as being too volatile, eventually selecting a mixture containing triorthocresyl phosphate (TOCP), a plasticizer used in lacquers and paint finishing. Gross was advised by the manufacturer of the mixture, Celluloid Corporation, that it was non-toxic.

TOCP was originally thought to be non-toxic; however, it was later determined to be a neurotoxin that causes axonal damage to the nerve cells in the nervous system of human beings, especially those located in the spinal cord. The resulting type of paralysis is now referred to as organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy, or OPIDN.

In 1930, large numbers of Jake users began to find they were unable to use their hands and feet. Some victims could walk, but they had no control over the muscles which would normally have enabled them to point their toes upward. Therefore, they would raise their feet high with the toes flopping downward, which would touch the pavement first followed by their heels. The toe first, heel second pattern made a distinctive &quot;tap-click, tap-click&quot; sound as they walked. This very peculiar gait became known as the jake walk and the jake dance and those afflicted were said to have jake leg, jake foot, or jake paralysis. Additionally, the calves of the legs would soften and hang down and the muscles between the thumbs and fingers would atrophy.

Within a few months, the TOCP-adulterated Jake was identified as the cause of the paralysis, and the contaminated Jake was recovered. But by that time, it was too late for many victims. Some did recover full, or partial, use of their limbs. But for most, the loss was permanent. The total number of victims was never accurately determined, but is frequently quoted as between 30,000 and 50,000. Many victims were immigrants to the United States, and most were poor, with little political or social influence. The victims received very little assistance. Harry Gross and his part-owner of Boston-Hub Products, Max Reisman, were ultimately fined $1,000 each and given a two-year suspended jail sentence.

Several blues songs on the subject were recorded in the early 1930s, such as &quot;Jake Walk Papa&quot; by Asa Martin, and &quot;Jake Liquor Blues&quot; by Ishman Bracey.

Although this incident became well known, later cases of organophosphate poisoning occurred in Germany, Spain, Italy, and, on a large scale, in Morocco in 1959, where cooking oil adulterated with jet engine lubricant from an American airbase led to paralysis in approximately 10,000 victims, and caused an international incident.

==Cultural references==
=== Books ===
* In Sara Gruen&#x27;s 2006 novel &quot;Water for Elephants&quot; jake paralysis afflicts one character, Camel, after drinking contaminated Jamaica Ginger.
* In the novel &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;, the protagonist reveals early on that his mother went blind and fell to her death after drinking jake, leading to his resentment of his father for purchasing it.
* In his autobiography &quot;On the Move: A Life,&quot; Oliver Sacks describes research that he conducted to develop an animal model of jake paralysis. He was able to duplicate the toxic effects of TOCP on myelinated neurons in earthworms and chickens.
* In Jamie Ford&#x27;s novel &quot;Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet&quot; the two young characters Henry and Keiko are given a prescription for Jamaican Ginger in the 1942 portion of the story. They go to the pharmacy, pick up the bottles, and return to the Black Elks club. Due to war rationing and systemic oppression at the time, the black jazz club is not allowed to have a liquor license, so the proprietor uses Jamaican Ginger to make bathtub gin.

=== Music ===
Songs were recorded at the time about &quot;jake&quot; and its effects; in a variety of musical styles, including blues and country. Several have been included on the compilation albums &quot;Jake Walk Blues&quot; (1977, 14 songs) and &quot;Jake Leg Blues&quot; (1994, 16 songs) There is a marked but unsurprising duplication of songs between those albums. In some cases, different artists used the same title for different songs. The songs on one or both of those albums are, in alphabetic order by title:

<text>Earl Jellicoe is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created, along with the subsidiary title Viscount Brocas, of Southampton in the County of Southampton, on 29 June 1925 for Admiral of the Fleet John Jellicoe, 1st Viscount Jellicoe, on his return from being Governor-General of New Zealand, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. He had already been created Viscount Jellicoe, of Scapa in the County of Orkney, on 15 January 1918, created with remainder to the heirs male of his body, and in default of such issue to his eldest daughter and the heirs male of her body, with the like remainder in default of such issue to every other daughter successively in order of priority of birth, and to the heirs male of their bodies. The Jellicoe viscountcy was created with remainder to his daughters and their heirs male because, at the time of the creation, Jellicoe had five daughters and no sons. His only son was born three months later.

The title of Viscount Brocas is used as a courtesy title for the earl&#x27;s eldest son and heir apparent. Brocas was chosen due to the descent of Admiral Jellicoe&#x27;s great-grandmother, Jane Elizabeth, daughter of Sir James Whalley-Smythe-Gardiner, 2nd Baronet, of Roche Court, Fareham, from the last of the Brocases of Beaurepaire (purchased 1353, sold 1873), Sherborne St John, Hampshire. This was a family with Gascon roots that produced two masters of the horse and a 300-year (14th to 17th century) line of hereditary masters of the king&#x27;s buckhounds.

The 1st Earl Jellicoe was succeeded by his only son, George. The second earl served in the Coldstream Guards, No. 8 Commando, the Special Air Service and commanded the Special Boat Service during the Second World War. He later became a diplomat and a Conservative politician and served as the last First Lord of the Admiralty from 1963 to 1964 and as Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords from 1970 to 1973. In 1999 he was given a life peerage as Baron Jellicoe of Southampton, of Southampton, in the County of Hampshire, and remained a member of the House of Lords despite the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999 which removed the hereditary peerage&#x27;s automatic right to sit in the Lords. Until his death in 2007, the second Earl Jellicoe was the longest-serving member of the Lords, and technically the longest-serving parliamentarian in the world, having taken his seat in 1939.

==Arms==
*Shield: Argent three bars wavy azure, over all a whale hauriant sable.
*Crest: Out of a naval crown or a demi-wolf azure.
*Supporters: On either side a sea griffin or [gold].
*Motto: &quot;Sui memores alios fecere merendo&quot;: Remembered for their merits: Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, VI, 664].

==Earl Jellicoe (1925)==
*John Rushworth Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe (1859–1935).
*George Patrick John Rushworth Jellicoe, 2nd Earl Jellicoe (1918–2007).
*Patrick John Bernard Jellicoe, 3rd Earl Jellicoe (b. 1950).

==Present peer==
Patrick John Bernard Jellicoe, 3rd Earl Jellicoe (born 29 April 1950), is the eldest son of the 2nd Earl and his wife Patricia Christine O&#x27;Kane. Formally styled as Viscount Brocas from birth, he was educated at Eton College. In 2003 he was living in Tiverton, Devon.

On 22 February 2007, he succeeded his father as Earl Jellicoe (U.K., 1925), Viscount Brocas (U.K., 1925) and Viscount Jellicoe, of Scapa, Orkney (U.K., 1918).

In 1971, as Lord Brocas, he married Geraldine Ann FitzGerald Jackson; they were divorced in 1981, having one son, Justin Amadeus Jellicoe (born 1970).

Jellicoe also has a son with Clare Fisher, Jack Jellicoe (born 1977).

As both sons were born outside wedlock, the heir presumptive to the peerages is the present holder&#x27;s brother, the Hon. Nicholas Charles Joseph Jellicoe (born 1953).

==Line of succession==
#Hon. Nicholas Charles Joseph John Jellicoe (b. 1953), second son of the 2nd earl
#Hon. John Philip Jellicoe (b. 1966), third and youngest son of the 2nd earl

The above are in the line of succession for both the earldom and the viscountcies. There are further heirs to the viscountcy of Jellicoe (but not that of Brocas) in accordance with the special remainder granted in that title to the heirs male of the first viscount&#x27;s daughters in order of birth.

<doc id="467982" wikidata="Q1761743" url="?curid=467982" title="Red tape">
<text>Red tape is usually defined as excessive and/or unnecessary government regulations and bureaucracy that generate financial or time compliance costs.
Red tape is in excess of the necessary &quot;administrative burden,&quot; or cost to the public, of implementing government policies and procedures. 
This definition is also consistent with popular usage, which generally views red tape as negative.

Red tape can hamper the ability of firms to compete, grow, and create jobs.
Research finds red tape has a cost to public sector workers, and can reduce employee well-being and job satisfaction.

In 2005, the UK&#x27;s &quot;Better Regulation Task Force&quot; suggested that red tape reforms could lead to an increase in income of 16 billion pounds per year, an amount greater than 1% of GDP.
The Canadian Federation of Independent Business estimated the cost to business of red tape arising from federal, provincial and municipal government regulations was $11 billion in 2020.
This represented about 28% of the total burden of regulation for businesses in Canada.

Some governments have introduced initiatives to limit or cut red tape, such as a one-for-one rule that removes one regulation each time a new administrative burden is imposed on business.
Experience from British Columbia, Canada suggests a successful red tape reduction initiative requires strong political commitment.

== Red tape definition ==
The term &quot;red tape&quot; is sometimes employed as &quot;an umbrella term covering almost all imagined ills of bureaucracy,&quot; both public and private.
However, red tape is usually defined more narrowly as government policies, guidelines, and forms that are excessive, duplicative and/or unnecessary, and that generate a financial or time-based compliance cost.
This definition is consistent with popular usage, which generally views red tape as negative.

Whereas red tape refers to unnecessary rules, &quot;administrative burden&quot; (sometimes called &quot;white tape&quot;) recognizes that regulations that are intended for useful purposes may nonetheless entail a compliance cost.
Determining whether a regulation is justified rather than red tape can be difficult. Nevertheless, making the proper distinction is relevant when implementing reforms, and cutting red tape differs from deregulation.

==Origins and history==

It is generally believed that the term &quot;red tape&quot; originated in the early 16th century with the Spanish administration of Charles V, King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor, who started to use red tape in an effort to modernize the administration that was running his vast empire. The red tape was used to bind the most important administrative dossiers that required immediate discussion by the Council of State, and separate them from files that were treated in an ordinary administrative way, which were bound with ordinary string.

In Britain, Charles Dickens spoke of red tape in &quot;David Copperfield&quot;: &quot;Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and foot with red tape.&quot; The English practice of binding documents and official papers with red tape was popularized in Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s writings, protesting against official inertia with expressions like &quot;Little other than a red tape Talking-machine, and unhappy Bag of Parliamentary Eloquence&quot;.

As of the early 21st century, Spanish bureaucracy continued to be notorious for extreme levels of red tape (in the figurative sense). In 2013, the World Bank ranked Spain 136 out of 185 countries for ease of starting a business, which took on average 10 procedures and 28 days.
Similar issues persist throughout Latin America. 
In Mexico in 2009, it took six months and a dozen visits to government agencies to obtain a permit to paint a house. 
To obtain a monthly prescription for gamma globulin for X-linked agammaglobulinemia, a patient had to obtain signatures from two government doctors and stamps from four separate bureaucrats before presenting the prescription to a dispensary.
Mexico was the original home of Syntex, one of the greatest pharmaceutical firms of the 20th century—but in 1959, the company left for the American city of Palo Alto, California (in what is now Silicon Valley) because its scientists were fed up with the Mexican government&#x27;s bureaucratic delays which repeatedly impeded their research. 

==Cost of red tape==
It is impossible to know exactly how much of the burden of government regulations is red tape — ie, is excessive and delivers little or no benefit. 
However, a survey by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) found red tape represented about 28% of the total burden of regulation in Canada in 2020.
The total cost of regulation for U.S. business was estimated in 2021 at US$364.3 billion, and for Canadian business in 2020 at US$31.9 billion, or CAN$38.8 billion.
This cost represents 1.5% of GDP for the U.S. and 1.7% for Canada.

The CFIB estimated that the cost of red tape arising from Canadian federal, provincial and municipal government regulations was $11 billion in 2020. (This excluded covid-19 related costs, to make the amount more comparable to previous years.)
The annual cost of red tape per employee was higher for firms with fewer than 5 employees, at $1945, versus $398 for firms with 100 or more employees. 

The &quot;Better Regulation Task Force&quot; suggested in 2005 that red tape reforms could potentially deliver an increase in income of 16 billion pounds per year, an amount greater than one percent of UK GDP.
The European Union&#x27;s (EU) &quot;Cutting Red Tape in Europe&quot; report presented suggestions on how to reduce the administrative burden when member states implement EU legislation.
The total administrative burden reduction potential of all recommendations in the report was estimated to exceed 41 billion euros annually.

While a regulation may be useful, the cost of imposing it may exceed the benefits. The Canadian federal government applies a cost-benefit analysis to most regulatory proposals, which takes into account the cost of the policy to consumers, businesses, and other sectors of society.
Since the 1970s, Australian governments have sought to subject regulation to rigorous cost-benefit analysis so as to constrain both the stock and flow of the regulatory burden.

==Red tape reduction initiatives==
It can be difficult to distinguish between justified regulatory costs and unneeded regulations. For this reason, the expression &quot;cutting red tape&quot; has been used to refer to both initiatives to reduce &quot;unnecessary&quot; regulation, and to policies to reduce the overall regulatory burden. 

Canada&#x27;s &quot;Red Tape Reduction Act&quot; of 2015 implemented a one-for-one rule that requires the removal of a regulation each time regulators impose a new administrative burden on business.
Nevertheless, while &quot;Regulations&quot; decreased from 684 to 605 between 2014 and 2023, regulatory &quot;Requirements&quot; increased from 129,860 to 149,401.
A more successful reduction in red tape took place in the province of British Columbia, Canada, following a 2001 election promise to reduce the regulatory burden by 33%. 
At the time, regulation was heavy, with rules imposed on, for example, the size of televisions in restaurants, the number of par-four holes at golf courses, and the maximum seating capacity of ski hill lounges.
After three years, a 37% reduction was achieved. A central element of the program was a strong commitment from the minister responsible and the provincial premier.

In the United States, cutting red tape was a central principle of a 1993 National Performance Review study requested by the Clinton Administration.
In November 2024, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy would co-lead a new Department of Government Efficiency which would provide advice from outside government on methods to &quot;slash excess regulations&quot;, among other objectives.

==Perceptions of red tape==
Applying rules consistently can affect the extent to which individuals perceive that red tape exists in a government agency.
A survey-based experiment in the context of a jury duty summons found inconsistently-applied rules may be viewed as ineffective or unfair, fueling the perception of a high level of red tape.

Perception of red tape (as opposed to useful regulation) may be relevant in the public service context, since employees may be more willing to comply with rules that they perceive as valuable.

==Red tape and public sector employee job satisfaction==
Red tape can reduce employee flexibility and autonomy, thereby reducing job satisfaction.
A 2022 study that used survey data from 354 school principals in Chile found they experienced increased emotional exhaustion and risk of burnout when they were advised of a potential increase in red tape in the form of compliance tasks. 
Research conducted into experiences of public-school leaders and teachers in Belgium found that when employees were faced with high levels of red tape from utilising digital tools, they were more likely to experience emotional exhaustion and, therefore, have higher turnover intention.

A study of Dutch child welfare employees showed red tape reduced interactions with clients and job effectiveness, which decreased job satisfaction. Highly motivated employees were found to be more sensitive to burdensome rules and procedures.

In 2020, the Canadian government released the Blueprint 2020 report, which brought together insights from engagements with over 2,000 public servants about their experiences with internal red tape. This report found that internal red tape is a significant concern for public servants. Key issues included having unclear direction on rules, policies, and guidelines; and poor internal client service.

==Red tape, economic growth, and corruption==
===Red tape and economic growth===
While efficient government institutions can foster economic growth, cumbersome and/or unnecessary bureaucracy that delays permits and licenses slows technological advances.
Red tape has been found to be an obstacle to investment and growth in a study using data for 68 countries.

Policies that require government regulation and bureaucratic intervention can stifle economic progress, as has been documented by economist Anne Krueger in the context of an import-substitution development strategy.
This type of policy reduces the incentive to produce exports, thereby generating a foreign exchange &quot;shortage&quot; that puts pressure on governments to restrict imports to high priority areas such as medicines over consumer luxuries.
These restrictions require increased intervention, such as additional customs inspections and import approvals. In turn, this leads to delays and greater complexity of the system, which raises costs for importers.
The higher costs create an incentive for black-market activity, thereby leading to political pressure to tighten still further the restrictive import regime. 
Over time, regulation and red tape promote more red tape and regulation in a vicious circle, as supporters of import substitution become more entrenched, while those who oppose it, such as exporters, cannot survive in the new environment.
Rising costs of administration in the private sector, along with costs of delays and market inefficiency, weigh on economic performance and often result in an economic crisis.

===Red tape and corruption===
The existence of regulations and authorizations provides a kind of monopoly power to the officials who must approve or inspect regulated activities.
When regulations are not transparent, or an authorization can be obtained only from a specific office or individual (that is, there is no competition in the granting of these authorizations), bureaucrats have a great deal of power which may lead to corruption.
Officials may even intentionally introduce new regulations and red tape in order to be able to extract more bribes by threatening to deny permits. Particularly in developing and transition economies, surveys indicate that a large proportion of an enterprise manager&#x27;s time (especially for small enterprises) requires dealing with bureaucracies, and this time can be reduced through the payment of bribes.

<text>&lt;section begin=&quot;Aus infobox&quot; /&gt;
&lt;section end=&quot;Aus infobox&quot; /&gt;

The 1996 Australian federal election was held to determine the members of the 38th Parliament of Australia. It was held on 2 March 1996. All 148 seats of the House of Representatives and 40 seats of the 76-seat Senate were up for election. The Liberal/National Coalition led by Opposition Leader John Howard of the Liberal Party and coalition partner Tim Fischer of the National Party defeated the incumbent Australian Labor Party government led by Prime Minister Paul Keating in a landslide victory. The Coalition won 94 seats in the House of Representatives, which is the largest number of seats held by a federal government to date, and only the second time a party had won over 90 seats at a federal election.

The election marked the end of the five-term, 13-year Hawke-Keating Government that began in 1983. Howard was sworn in as the new prime minister of Australia on 11 March 1996, along with the First Howard Ministry. This election was the start of the 11-year Howard Government; the Labor party would spend this period in opposition and would not return to government until the 2007 election.

This was the first federal election that future prime minister Tony Abbott contested as a member of parliament, having entered parliament at the 1994 Warringah by-election. Future prime minister Anthony Albanese and future opposition leader Brendan Nelson also entered parliament at this election.

Future prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard were unsuccessful candidates for the House of Representatives and Senate respectively at this election and would eventually be elected to the House of Representatives at the next election in 1998.

Howard became the first Liberal leader to win an election from opposition since Robert Menzies in 1949. (Malcolm Fraser was caretaker prime minister in the 1975 election.) The victory also saw the Liberal Party gain enough seats to not require the support of the National Party, though John Howard opted to stay in the Coalition. As of 2023 this is the last time the Liberal Party has won an overall majority of seats in federal parliament and also the last when both major party leaders born prior to 1946, the first year of the Post-war era.

==Background==
John Howard, who had previously led the Liberal Party from 1985 to 1989, returned to the leadership in January 1995 following the party&#x27;s disastrous eight months under the leadership of Alexander Downer. Downer and deputy PM Peter Costello had succeeded John Hewson and Michael Wooldridge early in 1994 and were touted as the leaders of the new-generation Liberals. In the end, the party opted for the seasoned Howard, perhaps an acknowledgment that he was the only one left standing after a decade of party infighting.

==Campaign==
Howard approached the campaign with a determination to present as small a target as possible. Throughout 1995 he refused to detail specific policy proposals, focusing the Coalition&#x27;s attacks mainly on the longevity and governing record of the Labor government. By 1996, however, it was clear that the electorate had tired of Labor and in particular of Paul Keating. The line &quot;The recession we had to have&quot; resonated with deadly force throughout the electorate. Although Keating&#x27;s big-picture approach to republicanism, reconciliation with Australia&#x27;s Indigenous peoples and engagement with Asia galvanised support within Labor&#x27;s urban constituencies, Howard was able to attract support amongst disaffected mainstream Australians, uniting middle-class suburban residents with traditionally Labor-voting blue-collar workers. He also promised to retain Medicare and hold a constitutional convention to decide whether Australia would become a republic.

The election-eve Newspoll reported the Liberal/National Coalition held an estimated 53.5 percent two-party-preferred vote.

On election day, the news was dominated by the Ralph Willis letter. Treasurer Ralph Willis had released a letter purporting to be secret correspondence between Howard and Liberal Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett. Howard quickly denounced the letter as a forgery and claims of Labor skulduggery dominated the last day, drowning out anything Keating said. The letter was subsequently revealed to be the work of university students. Left-wing writer Bob Ellis claimed that the Ralph Willis letter was the cause of Keating&#x27;s crushing defeat.

==Analysis==
Overall the coalition won 29 seats from Labor while the ALP won 4 seats from the Liberals. These 4 seats were Canberra and Namadgi in the ACT and Isaacs and Bruce in Victoria. The ACT seats, which had been won by the Liberals in a by-election, fell to Labor due to a strong return to the ALP in a traditional Labor town by public servants fearing conservative cuts. The division of Brendan Smyth&#x27;s seat of Canberra into the two new (of the three) ACT seats limited his campaign to the southernmost Tuggeranong seat of Namadgi where the ACT Labor right wing stood former MLA Annette Ellis who ran a tight grassroots campaign. Isaacs and Bruce fell to Labor due to demographic changes due to a redistribution of electoral boundaries.
Labor lost five percent of its two-party vote from 1993, and tallied its lowest primary vote since 1934 (an additional eight percent coming from preferences). The swing against Labor would not normally have been enough in and of itself enough to cause a change of government. However, Labor lost 13 of its 33 seats in New South Wales, and all but two of its 13 seats in Queensland. The 29-seat swing was the second-largest defeat, in terms of seats lost, by a sitting government in Australia. Three members of Keating&#x27;s government – including Attorney-General Michael Lavarch – lost their seats. Keating resigned as Labor leader on the night of the election, and was succeeded by former deputy prime minister and Finance Minister Kim Beazley.

Due in part to this large swing, Howard entered office with a 45-seat majority, the second-largest in Australian history (behind only the 55-seat majority won by Malcolm Fraser in 1975). The Liberals actually won a majority in their own right at this election with 75 seats, the most the party had ever won. Although Howard had no need for the support of the Nationals, the Coalition was retained. , this was the last time the Liberals have won a majority in their own right at a federal election.

Exit polling showed the Coalition winning 47 percent of the blue-collar vote, compared with Labor&#x27;s 39 percent; there was a 16-point drop in Labor&#x27;s vote among members of trade unions. The Coalition won 48 percent of the Catholic vote and Labor 37 percent, a reversal of the usual figures.

<doc id="467994" wikidata="Q157339" url="?curid=467994" title="Fritillaria meleagris">
<text>Fritillaria meleagris is a Eurasian species of flowering plant in the lily family Liliaceae. Its common names include snake&#x27;s head fritillary, snake&#x27;s head (the original English name), chess flower, frog-cup, guinea-hen flower, guinea flower, leper lily (because its shape resembled the bell once carried by lepers), Lazarus bell, chequered lily, chequered daffodil, drooping tulip or, in the British Isles, simply fritillary. The plant is a bulbous perennial native to the flood river plains of Europe where it grows in abundance.

==Etymology==
The Latin specific epithet &quot;meleagris&quot; means &quot;spotted like a guineafowl&quot;. The common name &quot;snake&#x27;s head&quot; probably refers to the somewhat snakelike appearance of the nodding flower heads, especially when in bud, on their long stems.

==Description and habitat==
The flower has a chequered pattern in shades of purple, or is sometimes pure white. It flowers from March to May and grows between in height. The plant has a button-shaped bulb, about in diameter, containing poisonous alkaloids. It grows in grasslands in damp soils and river meadows at altitudes up to .

==Distribution==
&quot;Fritillaria meleagris&quot; is native to Europe and western Asia but in many places it is an endangered species that is rarely found in the wild but is commonly grown in gardens. In Croatia, the flower is known as and is associated by some with the country&#x27;s national symbol. It is the official flower of the Swedish province of Uppland, where it grows in large numbers every spring in the meadows of &quot;Kungsängen&quot; (“King’s Meadow”), just outside Uppsala, which gives the flower its Swedish name, (“king&#x27;s meadow lily”). It is also found, for example, in Sandemar Nature Reserve, a nature reserve west of Dalarö in the Stockholm Archipelago.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom there is some disagreement amongst botanists as to whether &quot;F. meleagris&quot; is a native species or a long-established garden escapee that has become naturalised over time. The plant was first described in the 16th century by herbalist John Gerard who had known of it only as a garden plant, and it was not recorded in the wild until 1736, which has led some to argue that it must be an escapee. However, the fact that its habitat is usually confined to ancient hay meadows, and it does not easily spread to adjoining land, leads others to the conclusion that it is a native species which became isolated from the European population when Britain was cut off from mainland Europe after the last glacial period. Clive Stace (2010) says that it is &quot;doubtfully native&quot;.

The plant was once abundant in the UK, particularly in the Thames Valley and parts of Wiltshire, and was collected in vast quantities to be sold as a cut flower in the markets of London, Oxford and Birmingham. During World War II most of the ancient meadows were ploughed up and turned over to the production of food crops, destroying much of the plant&#x27;s habitat. A popular garden plant, it is now rare in the wild, although there are some notable sites where it is still found, such as the meadows at Magdalen College, Iffley Meadows, Oxford and the Oxfordshire village of Ducklington, which holds a &quot;Fritillary Sunday&quot; festival. It is also found in the North Meadow National Nature Reserve, Wiltshire, Clattinger Farm Nature Reserve, Wiltshire, on Portholme in Cambridgeshire and Fox Fritillary Meadow and Mickfield Meadow nature reserves in Suffolk. In 2002 it was chosen as the County flower of Oxfordshire following a poll by the wild flora conservation charity Plantlife.

== Cultivation ==
Now easily available as an ornamental spring bulb for the garden, it is commonly sold as a mixture of different coloured cultivars. The species and the pure white-flowered variety &quot;F. meleagris&quot; var. &quot;unicolor&quot; subvar. &quot;alba&quot; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<doc id="467996" wikidata="Q699076" url="?curid=467996" title="ISO 9241">
<text>ISO 9241 is a multi-part standard from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) covering ergonomics of human-system interaction and related, human-centered design processes (see also human-computer interaction). It is managed by the ISO Technical Committee 159. It was originally titled &quot;Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs)&quot;. 
From 2006 onwards, the standards were retitled to the more generic &quot;Ergonomics of Human System Interaction&quot;.

As part of this change, ISO is renumbering some parts of the standard so that it can cover more topics, e.g. tactile and haptic interaction. For example, two zeros in the number indicate that the document under consideration is a generic or basic standard. Fundamental aspects are regulated in standards ending with one zero. A standard with three digits other than zero in the number regulate specific aspects. The first part to be renumbered was part 10 (now renumbered to part 110). 

Part 1 is a general introduction to the rest of the standard. Part 2 addresses task design for working with computer systems. Parts 3 to 9 deal with physical characteristics of computer equipment. Part 110 and parts 11 to 19 deal with usability aspects of software, including Part 110 (a general set of usability heuristics for the design of different types of dialogue) and Part 11 (general guidance on the specification and measurement of usability).

==Ergonomics of Human System Interaction==
The revised multipart standard is numbered in series as follows:
*100 series: Software ergonomics
*200 series: Human system interaction processes
*300 series: Displays and display related hardware
*400 series: Physical input devices - ergonomics principles
*500 series: Workplace ergonomics
*600 series: Environment ergonomics
*700 series: Application domains - Control rooms
*900 series: Tactile and haptic interactions

Within those series, the standard currently includes the following parts:
*Part 100: Introduction to standards related to software ergonomics
*Part 110: Dialogue principles
*Part 112: Principles for the presentation of information
*Part 125: Guidance on visual presentation of information
*Part 129: Guidance on software individualization
*Part 151: Guidance on World Wide Web user interfaces
*Part 143: Forms
*Part 154: Interactive voice response (IVR) applications
*Part 161: Guidance on visual user interface elements
*Part 171: Guidance on software accessibility
*Part 210: Human-centred design for interactive systems
*Part 300: Introduction to electronic visual display requirements
*Part 302: Terminology for electronic visual displays
*Part 303: Requirements for electronic visual displays
*Part 304: User performance test methods for electronic visual displays
*Part 305: Optical laboratory test methods for electronic visual displays
*Part 306: Field assessment methods for electronic visual displays
*Part 307: Analysis and compliance test methods for electronic visual displays
*Part 308: Surface-conduction electron-emitter displays (SED)
*Part 309 (TR): Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays
*Part 310 (TR): Visibility, aesthetics and ergonomics of pixel defects
*Part 400: Principles and requirements for physical input devices
*Part 410: Design criteria for physical input devices
*Part 910: Framework for tactile and haptic interaction
*Part 920: Guidance on tactile and haptic interactions

=== ISO 9241-110 ===
:(&quot;formerly ISO 9241-10:1996 Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs) -- Part 10: Dialogue principles.&quot; / withdrawn) 
:&quot;(formerly ISO 9241-110:2006 Ergonomics of human-system interaction — Part 110: Dialogue principles. / withdrawn)&quot;
The first edition of ISO 9241-110 was issued in 2006. In 2020, a revised version (second edition) was published, titled &quot;Ergonomics of human-system interaction — Part 110: Interaction principles&quot;. The core idea of the standard was not changed. Interaction principles are design guidelines for user interfaces that embody principles. The seven interaction principles are applicable to the design of any user interface, whether it is software, hardware or a combination of both. 

Some principles have been refined to be more appropriate to today&#x27;s possibilities or forms of interaction and User Engagement has been introduced as a new interaction principle. For each interaction principle, general design recommendations are given, which helps to follow them when designing user interfaces.

* Suitability for the user’s tasks
* Self-descriptiveness
* Conformity with user expectations
* Learnability
* Controllability
* Use error robustness
* User engagement

The 2020 revision tied the earlier principle of individualisation into the principle of controllability, and introduced the principle of user engagement.

=== ISO 9241-210 ===
:(&quot;formerly ISO 13407:1999&quot; Human-centred design processes for interactive systems, withdrawn)

Part 210: Human-centred Design; This part, updated in 2019, provides guidance on human-system interaction as holistic approach to plan, research, conceptualize, specify, design, develop, deploy and maintain interactive systems throughout their life cycle. It also covers the importance of sustainability and accessibility within the human-centered approach. 

With its introduction in 2008, it revised ISO 13407, Human-centred design for interactive systems.

=== ISO-9241-302, 303, 305, 307:2008 pixel defects ===
Of particular interest to the lay computer user are the definitions of flat-panel TV and monitor pixel defects provided in the ISO-9241-3xx series of standards (which renders obsolete ISO 13406-2). These identify three classes for measuring pixel defects in flat panel monitors:
* Class 0 panels are completely defect-free, including no full pixel or sub-pixel defects.
* Class 1 panels permit any or all of the following:
** 1 full bright (“stuck on white”) pixel
** 1 full dark (“stuck off”) pixel
** 2 single or double bright or dark sub-pixels
** 3 to 5 “stuck on” or “stuck off” sub-pixels (depending on the number of each)
* Class 2 panels permit any or all of the following:
** 2 full bright pixels
** 2 full dark pixels
** 5-10 single or double bright or dark sub-pixels (again, depending on the number of each; no more than 5 bright (“stuck on”) subpixels are permitted).
* Class 3 panels permit any or all of the following:
** 5 full bright pixels
** 15 full dark pixels
** 50 single or double sub-pixels stuck on or off

(allowed pixed defects per 1 (one) million pixels in the TFT/LCD matrix)

As of 2010, most premium branded panel manufacturers specify their products as Class 0, expecting a small number of returns due to early failure where a particular item fails to meet Class 0 but would meet Class 1. Budget panel manufacturers tend to specify their products as Class 1. Most premium branded finished product manufacturers (retail TVs, monitors, laptops, etc.) tend to specify their products as meeting Class 1 even when they have a Class 0 specified panel inside. Some premium branded finished product manufacturers have started to specify their products as Class 0 or offer a Class 0 guarantee for an additional premium.

===ISO 9241-1===
Part 1: (1997) Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs) : General Introduction
This part introduces the multi-part standard ISO 9241 for the ergonomic requirements for the use of visual display terminals for office tasks and explains some of the basic underlying principles. It provides some guidance on how to use the standard and describes how conformance to parts of ISO 9241 should be reported.

===ISO 9241-2===
Part 2: (1993) Guidance on task requirements
This part deals with the design of tasks and jobs involving work with visual display terminals. It provides guidance on how task requirements may be identified and specified within individual organisations and how task requirements can be incorporated into the system design and implementation process.

===ISO 9241-3===
Part 3: (1993, deprecated) Visual display requirements
This part specifies the ergonomics requirements for display screens which ensure that they can be read comfortably, safely and efficiently to perform office tasks. Although it deals specifically with displays used in offices, it is appropriate to specify it for most applications that require general purpose displays to be used in an office-like environment.

===ISO 9241-4===
Part 4: (1998) Keyboard requirements
This part specifies the ergonomics design characteristics of an alphanumeric keyboard which may be used comfortably, safely and efficiently to perform office tasks. Keyboard layouts are dealt with separately in various parts of ISO/IEC 9995: 1994 Information Processing - Keyboard Layouts for Text and Office Systems

===ISO 9241-5===
Part 5: (1998) Workstation layout and postural requirements
This part specifies the ergonomics requirement for a Visual Display Terminal workplace which will allow the user to adopt a comfortable and efficient posture.

===ISO 9241-6===
Part 6: (1999) Environmental requirements
This part specifies the ergonomics requirements for the Visual Display Terminal working environment which will provide the user with comfortable, safe and productive working conditions.

===ISO 9241-7===
Part 7: (1998, deprecated) Display requirements with reflections
This part specifies methods of measurement of glare and reflections from the surface of display screens, including those with surface treatments.

===ISO 9241-8===
Part 8: (1997, deprecated) Requirements for displayed colors
This part specifies the requirements for multicolour displays which are largely in addition to the monochrome requirements in Part 3.

===ISO 9241-9===
Part 9: (2000) Requirements for non-keyboard input devices
This part specifies the ergonomics requirements for non-keyboard input devices which may be used in conjunction with a visual display terminal. It also includes a suggestion for a user-based performance test as an alternative way of showing conformance. The standard covers such devices as the mouse, trackball and other pointing devices, but it does not address voice input.

===ISO 9241-10===
Part 10 (1996, withdrawn) &quot;Dialogue principles&quot;: 
Gives ergonomic principles formulated in general bhhhh terms; they are presented without reference to situations of use, application, environment or technology. These principles are intended to be used in specifications, design and evaluation of dialogues for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs).

===ISO 9241-11===
Part 11: (1998) To examine the quality of how well tasks are fulfilled by the users (usability testing), ISO 9241-11 framework can be employed.

There are three components in the framework: System Effectiveness to examine the users’ ability to complete the given tasks, System Efficiency to examine the required user resources to complete the tasks, and System Satisfaction to record the users’ opinions and feedback.

System Effectiveness: Participants are asked to complete six tasks, and the success or failure rate of completing each task is measured to evaluate the app’s efficiency. Task completion is considered successful when the user completed the task without producing an error or asking for assistance.

System Efficiency: For evaluating system efficiency, the researcher records the time (in seconds) that participants took to complete each task. Each task is initiated by expressing the word ‘start’ and finished when the user mentioned the end. Upon completing each task, the user is asked to fill out the Single Ease Questionnaire (SEQ) to examine the level of task difficulty. The questionnaire is a seven-point Likert scale in which scale 1 indicates the task as ‘very difficult’, and scale 7 indicates the task as ‘very easy’.

System Satisfaction is used to evaluate the overall usability of the apps through System Usability Scale (SUS), which is a usability assessment questionnaire with reliable and valid results. It includes ten questions, each with five items ranging from ‘strongly agree’ to ‘strongly disagree’. The score range is from 0 to 100 and scores higher than 80 are considered high usability while those below 70 are considered low usability.

===ISO 9241-12===
Part 12: (1998) Presentation of information

This part contains specific recommendations for presenting and representing information on visual displays. It includes guidance on ways of representing complex information using alphanumeric and graphical/symbolic codes, screen layout, and design as well as the use of windows.

===ISO 9241-13===
Part 13: (1998) User guidance

This part provides recommendations for the design and evaluation of user guidance attributes of software user interfaces including Prompts, Feedback, Status, On-line Help and Error Management.

===ISO 9241-14===
Part 14: (1997) Menu dialogues

This part provides recommendations for the ergonomic design of menus used in user-computer dialogues. The recommendations cover menu structure, navigation, option selection and execution, and menu presentation (by various techniques including windowing, panels, buttons, fields, etc.).

===ISO 9241-15===
Part 15: (1998) Command language dialogues

This part provides recommendations for the ergonomic design of command languages used in user-computer dialogues. The recommendations cover command language structure and syntax, command representations, input and output considerations, and feedback and help.

===ISO 9241-16===
Part 16: (1999) Direct manipulation dialogues

This part provides recommendations for the ergonomic design of direct manipulation dialogues, and includes the manipulation of objects, and the design of metaphors, objects and attributes. It covers those aspects of graphical user interfaces that are directly manipulated, and not covered by other parts of ISO 9241.

===ISO 9241-17===
Part 17: (1998) Form-filling dialogues

This part provides recommendations for the ergonomic design of form filling dialogues. The recommendations cover form structure and output considerations, input considerations, and form navigation.

<doc id="468001" wikidata="Q1593782" url="?curid=468001" title="FASTA format">
<text>In bioinformatics and biochemistry, the FASTA format is a text-based format for representing either nucleotide sequences or amino acid (protein) sequences, in which nucleotides or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes.

The format allows for sequence names and comments to precede the sequences. It originated from the FASTA software package and has since become a near-universal standard in bioinformatics.

The simplicity of FASTA format makes it easy to manipulate and parse sequences using text-processing tools and scripting languages.

== Overview ==
A sequence begins with a greater-than character (&quot;&gt;&quot;) followed by a description of the sequence (all in a single line). The lines immediately following the description line are the sequence representation, with one letter per amino acid or nucleic acid, and are typically no more than 80 characters in length.

For example:
&gt;MCHU - Calmodulin - Human, rabbit, bovine, rat, and chicken

FPEFLTMMARKMKDTDSEEEIREAFRVFDKDGNGYISAAELRHVMTNLGEKLTDEEVDEMIREA
DIDGDGQVNYEEFVQMMTAK*
=== Original format ===
The original FASTA/Pearson format is described in the documentation for the FASTA suite of programs. It can be downloaded with any free distribution of FASTA (see fasta20.doc, fastaVN.doc, or fastaVN.me—where VN is the Version Number).

In the original format, a sequence was represented as a series of lines, each of which was no longer than 120 characters and usually did not exceed 80 characters. This probably was to allow for the preallocation of fixed line sizes in software: at the time most users relied on Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VT220 (or compatible) terminals which could display 80 or 132 characters per line. Most people preferred the bigger font in 80-character modes and so it became the recommended fashion to use 80 characters or less (often 70) in FASTA lines. Also, the width of a standard printed page is 70 to 80 characters (depending on the font). Hence, 80 characters became the norm.

The first line in a FASTA file started either with a &quot;&gt;&quot; (greater-than) symbol or, less frequently, a &quot;;&quot; (semicolon) was taken as a comment. Subsequent lines starting with a semicolon would be ignored by software. Since the only comment used was the first, it quickly became used to hold a summary description of the sequence, often starting with a unique library accession number, and with time it has become commonplace to always use &quot;&gt;&quot; for the first line and to not use &quot;;&quot; comments (which would otherwise be ignored).

Following the initial line (used for a unique description of the sequence) was the actual sequence itself in the standard one-letter character string. Anything other than a valid character would be ignored (including spaces, tabulators, asterisks, etc...). It was also common to end the sequence with an &quot;*&quot; (asterisk) character (in analogy with use in PIR formatted sequences) and, for the same reason, to leave a blank line between the description and the sequence. Below are a few sample sequences:

A multiple-sequence FASTA format, or multi-FASTA format, would be obtained by concatenating several single-sequence FASTA files in one file. This does not imply a contradiction with the format as only the first line in a FASTA file may start with a &quot;;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&quot;, forcing all subsequent sequences to start with a &quot;&gt;&quot; in order to be taken as separate sequences (and further forcing the exclusive reservation of &quot;&gt;&quot; for the sequence definition line). Thus, the examples above would be a multi-FASTA file if taken together.

Modern bioinformatics programs that rely on the FASTA format expect the sequence headers to be preceded by &quot;&gt;&quot;. The sequence is generally represented as &quot;interleaved&quot;, or on multiple lines as in the above example, but may also be &quot;sequential&quot;, or on a single line. Running different bioinformatics programs may require conversions between &quot;sequential&quot; and &quot;interleaved&quot; FASTA formats.

==Description line==

The description line (defline) or header/identifier line, which begins with &quot;&gt;&quot;, gives a name and/or a unique identifier for the sequence, and may also contain additional information. In a deprecated practice, the header line sometimes contained more than one header, separated by a ^A (Control-A) character. In the original Pearson FASTA format, one or more comments, distinguished by a semi-colon at the beginning of the line, may occur after the header. Some databases and bioinformatics applications do not recognize these comments and follow the NCBI FASTA specification. An example of a multiple sequence FASTA file follows:

ATIGENLVVRRFATLKAGANGVVNGYIHTNGRVGVVIAAACDSAEVASKSRDLLRQICMH
=== NCBI identifiers ===
The NCBI defined a standard for the unique identifier used for the sequence (SeqID) in the header line. This allows a sequence that was obtained from a database to be labelled with a reference to its database record. The database identifier format is understood by the NCBI tools like codice_1 and codice_2. The following list describes the NCBI FASTA defined format for sequence identifiers.

The vertical bars (&quot;|&quot;) in the above list are not separators in the sense of the Backus–Naur form but are part of the format. Multiple identifiers can be concatenated, also separated by vertical bars.

==Sequence representation==

Following the header line, the actual sequence is represented. Sequences may be protein sequences or nucleic acid sequences, and they can contain gaps or alignment characters (see sequence alignment). Sequences are expected to be represented in the standard IUB/IUPAC amino acid and nucleic acid codes, with these exceptions: lower-case letters are accepted and are mapped into upper-case; a single hyphen or dash can be used to represent a gap character; and in amino acid sequences, U and * are acceptable letters (see below). Numerical digits are not allowed but are used in some databases to indicate the position in the sequence. The nucleic acid codes supported are:
The amino acid codes supported (22 amino acids and 3 special codes) are:
==FASTA file==

===Filename extension===
There is no standard filename extension for a text file containing FASTA formatted sequences. The table below shows each extension and its respective meaning.

===Compression===
The compression of FASTA files requires a specific compressor to handle both channels of information: identifiers and sequence. For improved compression results, these are mainly divided into two streams where the compression is made assuming independence. For example, the algorithm MFCompress performs lossless compression of these files using context modelling and arithmetic encoding. Genozip, a software package for compressing genomic files, uses an extensible context-based model. Benchmarks of FASTA file compression algorithms have been reported by Hosseini et al. in 2016, and Kryukov et al. in 2020.

===Encryption===
The encryption of FASTA files can be performed with various tools, including Cryfa and Genozip. Cryfa uses AES encryption and also enables data compression. Similarly, Genozip can encrypt FASTA files with AES-256 during compression.

==Extensions==
FASTQ format is a form of FASTA format extended to indicate information related to sequencing. It is created by the Sanger Centre in Cambridge.

A2M/A3M are a family of FASTA-derived formats used for sequence alignments. In A2M/A3M sequences, lowercase characters are taken to mean insertions, which are then indicated in the other sequences as the dot (&quot;) character. The dots can be discarded for compactness without loss of information. As with typical FASTA files used in alignments, the gap (&quot;) is taken to mean exactly one position. A3M is similar to A2M, with the added rule that gaps aligned to insertions can too be discarded.

==Working with FASTA files==

A plethora of user-friendly scripts are available from the community to perform FASTA file manipulations. Online toolboxes, such as FaBox or the FASTX-Toolkit within Galaxy servers, are also available. These can be used to segregate sequence headers/identifiers, rename them, shorten them, or extract sequences of interest from large FASTA files based on a list of wanted identifiers (among other available functions). A tree-based approach to sorting multi-FASTA files (TREE2FASTA) also exists based on the coloring and/or annotation of sequences of interest in the FigTree viewer. Additionally, the Bioconductor &quot;Biostrings&quot; package can be used to read and manipulate FASTA files in R.

Several online format converters exist to rapidly reformat multi-FASTA files to different formats (e.g. NEXUS, PHYLIP) for use with different phylogenetic programs, such as the converter available on phylogeny.fr.

<text>Sandra Hall Magnus (born October 30, 1964) is an American engineer and a former NASA astronaut. She flew to space three times, as mission specialist on STS-112, as ISS crewmember during Expedition 18 and as mission specialist on STS-135. She is also a licensed amateur radio operator with the call sign KE5FYE. From 2012 until 2018 Magnus was the executive director of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Magnus was born and raised in Belleville, Illinois. She earned degrees in physics and electrical engineering from the University of Missouri–Rolla (now known as the Missouri University of Science and Technology) before earning a PhD in materials science and engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1996. Research for her dissertation, entitled &quot;An Investigation of the relationship between the thermochemistry and emission behavior of thermionic cathodes based on the BaO-ScO-WO ternary system,&quot; was supported by a fellowship from the NASA Lewis Research Center.

===Engineering career===
During the 1980s, Magnus worked on stealth aircraft design as an engineer for McDonnell Douglas. She worked on the propulsion system for the A-12 Avenger II until the project was canceled by the Navy in 1991.

===NASA career===
Magnus was selected as an astronaut candidate in 1996. Following training for two years from January 1997 until May 1998, Magnus was assigned to the Payloads/Habitability branch in the Astronaut office. Her work included coordinating with the European Space Agency and the Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) and Brazil. In May 1998 she was assigned to work in Russia supporting payload hardware development and testing. In 2000 she was CAPCOM for the International Space Station.

====STS-112====
She flew her first space mission, STS-112, in October 2002 as a mission specialist. The main objective of Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; mission was the installation of the S1 truss section on the International Space Station (ISS) and consumables delivery. Magnus operated the space station&#x27;s robotic arm during the three spacewalks required to install and activate the S1 truss. The flight duration was 10 days 19 hours 58 minutes and 44 seconds.

====Survival training====
From January 29–31, 2006, together with Oleg Artemiev and Michael Barratt, Magnus took part in a two-day examination for the ability to survive in an uninhabited area in case of the Soyuz descent module making an emergency landing. She passed this examination in the forest near Moscow.

====NEEMO 11====
From September 16–22, 2006, Magnus served as the commander of NASA&#x27;s NEEMO 11 mission, an undersea expedition at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s Aquarius laboratory located off the coast of Florida. With fellow astronaut/aquanauts Timothy Kopra, Robert Behnken and Timothy Creamer, all of whom were training for possible assignment to missions to the International Space Station, Magnus imitated moonwalks, tested concepts for mobility using various spacesuit configurations and weights to simulate lunar gravity. Techniques for communication, navigation, geological sample retrieval, construction and using remote-controlled robots on the Moon&#x27;s surface also were tested. National Undersea Research Center support crew members Larry Ward and Roger Garcia provided engineering support inside the habitat.

====Expedition 18====
Magnus served as flight engineer on board the International Space Station as part of Expedition 18. Magnus was a mission specialist on STS-126 for the trip to the station, which launched on November 14, 2008. She served as mission specialist on STS-119 when it returned on March 28, 2009. She logged 133 days in orbit and received warm greetings from NASA on her return. Her replacement, JAXA astronaut Koichi Wakata, was launched aboard &quot;Discovery&quot; on March 15, 2009.

====STS-135====

On September 14, 2010, NASA announced Magnus to be one of four astronauts assigned to the STS-135 &quot;launch on need&quot; crew that was, if needed, to fly a rescue mission for STS-134, which was originally the last scheduled shuttle flight. Other members assigned to that crew were commander Christopher Ferguson, pilot Douglas G. Hurley, and fellow mission specialist Rex J. Walheim. In January 2011, NASA added STS-135 to the manifest as the final Space Shuttle mission, scheduled to launch in July 2011; STS-134 was conducted successfully in May 2011, requiring no rescue flight. The mission launched successfully on 8 July 2011 and landed on July 21.

In September 2012, Magnus became deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office.

===After NASA===
In October 2012, Magnus left NASA Astronaut corps to become the executive director of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). She was the executive director until January 2018.

From 2018 to 2019, Magnus was a principal at AstroPlanetView. In 2019, she became the deputy director for Engineering within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serving under former NASA Administrator Michael Griffin.

On February 9, 2021, Virgin Galactic announced that Magnus would be joining their Space Advisory Board to help &quot;provide advice to senior management as the company moves forward to open space for the benefit of all.&quot; Magnus will be joined by former astronaut Chris Hadfield and Chief Scientist of Cubic Corporation David A. Whelan.

<text>Piers John Sellers (11 April 1955 – 23 December 2016) was a British-American meteorologist, NASA astronaut and Director of the Earth Science Division at NASA/GSFC. He was a veteran of three Space Shuttle missions.
Sellers attended Cranbrook School, Cranbrook, Kent, United Kingdom, until 1973, and achieved a bachelor&#x27;s degree in ecological science from the University of Edinburgh in 1976. In 1981 he gained a doctorate in biometeorology from the University of Leeds. In 2011, Sellers retired from the NASA Astronaut Corps.

Before joining the astronaut corps, Sellers worked at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center on research into how the Earth&#x27;s biosphere and atmosphere interact. This work involved climate system computer modelling and field work utilising aircraft, satellites and ground support input.

==Personal life and death==
Sellers was born in Crowborough, Sussex, the second born of five boys for mother Lindsey. His education started at Tyttenhanger Lodge Pre-preparatory School in Seaford, East Sussex, and Cranbrook School, Kent, from which he graduated in 1973 and where he was trained as a Royal Air Force cadet to pilot gliders and powered aircraft. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in ecological science from the University of Edinburgh and a doctorate in biometeorology from the University of Leeds. Sellers married Amanda Lomas, a nurse from Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, before they moved to the US. This marriage ended in divorce.

Sellers appeared in the Leonardo DiCaprio-produced documentary film &quot;Before the Flood&quot;.

In January 2016, he revealed that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. Sellers died 23 December 2016 at the age of 61.

==Career==
Sellers and his wife left the UK in 1982, moving to the United States, where he began his NASA career as a research meteorologist at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Sellers&#x27; work in the field of meteorology focused primarily on computer modelling of climate systems, but he maintained his aircraft pilot skills. Sellers began applying annually to become an astronaut in 1984, but his lack of US citizenship was a problem. In 1991 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

==NASA career==
Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in April 1996, Sellers reported to the NASA Johnson Space Center in August 1996. He completed two years of training and evaluation and was initially assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Computer Support Branch, followed by service in the Astronaut Office Space Station Branch. During that time, he worked part-time in Moscow as a technical liaison on ISS computer software. Sellers logged over 559 hours in space, including almost 41 EVA hours in 6 spacewalks. He retired as an astronaut in 2011 and then served as deputy director of sciences and exploration at NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.

===Spaceflight experience===
&quot;STS-112&quot; (7–18 October 2002) was an International Space Station assembly mission during which the crew conducted joint operations with the Expedition-5 in delivering and installing the S-One Truss (the third piece of the station&#x27;s 11-piece Integrated Truss Structure). To outfit and activate the new component, Sellers performed three spacewalks and logged a total of 19 hours and 41 minutes of EVA. The crew also transferred cargo between the two vehicles and used the shuttle&#x27;s thruster jets during two manoeuvres to raise the station&#x27;s orbit. STS-112 was the first shuttle mission to use a camera on the External Tank, providing a live view of the launch to flight controllers and NASA TV viewers. The mission was accomplished in 170 orbits, travelling 4.5 million miles in 10 days, 19 hours, and 58 minutes.

&quot;STS-121&quot; (4–17 July 2006) was a return-to-flight test mission and assembly flight to the International Space Station. During the 13-day flight, the crew of &quot;Discovery&quot; tested new equipment and procedures that increased the safety of space shuttles, and produced never-before-seen, high-resolution images of the Shuttle during and after its 4 July launch. The crew also performed maintenance on the space station and delivered and transferred more than 28,000 pounds of supplies and equipment, and a new Expedition 13 crew member to the station. Sellers and Mike Fossum performed three EVAs to test the 50-foot robotic arm boom extension as a work platform. They removed and replaced a cable that provides power, command and data and video connections to the station&#x27;s mobile transporter rail car. They also tested techniques for inspecting and repairing the reinforced carbon-carbon segments that protect the shuttle&#x27;s nose cone and leading edge of the wings. The STS-121 mission was accomplished in 306 hours, 37 minutes and 54 seconds.

Sellers brought a velvet patch of the University of Edinburgh crest into space on this flight, which was sewn to the graduating bonnet used during the university&#x27;s graduation ceremonies.

&quot;STS-132&quot; (14–26 May 2010) was an International Space Station assembly mission. The primary payload was the Russian &quot;Rassvet&quot; Mini-Research Module along with an Integrated Cargo Carrier-Vertical Light Deployable (ICC-VLD). This was the final scheduled mission of &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Sellers took a four-inch wood sample of Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s apple tree, a piece from the original tree that supposedly inspired Newton&#x27;s theory of gravity, along with a picture of Newton. The wood is part of the collection of the Royal Society archives in London, and was returned after the flight. He also took an original watercolor portrait of Cranbrook School painted by Brenda Barratt.

==Honours and awards==
* 1994 NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal
* 1995 Arthur Fleming Award
* 1996 Fellow of the American Geophysical Union
* 1997 American Meteorological Society Houghton Award &amp; Fellow of the American Meteorological Society
Sellers was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to science, and in June 2016 received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal.

In April 2017, James Ellis, the retired U.S. Navy admiral and chair of the Space Foundation&#x27;s Board of Directors, honored Sellers posthumously with the General James E. Hill Lifetime Space Achievement Award.

In honor of Piers Sellers, the Priestley International Centre of Climate at the University of Leeds, awards the Piers Sellers Prizes for a &#x27;World leading contribution to solution-focused climate research&#x27;, and for &#x27;exceptional PhD research&#x27;. Laureates include Joeri Roegelj (2016), Felix Creutzig (2017), Mark New (2018), Petra Tschakert (2019), and Katharine Mach (2020). In 2022, Joyeeta Gupta was awarded the main prize, with the PhD prize jointly awarded to Angus Naylor and Adele Dixon.

<text>Pamela Ann Melroy (born September 17, 1961) is an American retired United States Air Force officer and NASA astronaut serving as the deputy administrator of NASA. She served as pilot on Space Shuttle missions STS-92 and STS-112 and commanded mission STS-120 before leaving the agency in August 2009. After serving as deputy program manager of Space Exploration Initiatives with Lockheed Martin, Melroy joined the Federal Aviation Administration in 2011, where she was a senior technical advisor and director of field operations for the FAA&#x27;s Office of Commercial Space Transportation.

In 2013, she left the FAA and joined DARPA as deputy director of the Tactical Technology Office. She left the agency in February 2017.

In November 2021, Melroy was inducted into the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. The ceremony, planned for May 2020, was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Early life and education==
Melroy was born in Palo Alto, California, and graduated from Bishop Kearney High School in Rochester in 1979. She received a Bachelor of Arts in Physics and Astronomy from Wellesley College in 1983. She then earned her Master of Science in Earth and Planetary Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1984. On May 18, 2008, Melroy received an honorary degree from Iona College in New Rochelle, New York.

== Career ==

===Military===
Melroy was commissioned through Air Force ROTC, Detachment 365, in 1984. After completing a master&#x27;s degree, she attended Undergraduate Pilot Training at Reese Air Force Base in Lubbock, Texas and was graduated in 1985. She flew the KC-10 for six years at Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, Louisiana, as a copilot, aircraft commander and instructor pilot. Melroy is a veteran of the United States invasion of Panama and Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, with over 200 combat and combat support hours. In June 1991, she attended the Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Upon her graduation, she was assigned to the C-17 Combined Test Force, where she served as a test pilot until her selection for the astronaut program. She has logged over 5,000 hours of flight time in over 50 different aircraft. Melroy retired from the Air Force in February 2007.

===NASA===

Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in December 1994, Melroy reported to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995. She completed a year of training and evaluation and was qualified for flight assignment as a shuttle pilot. Initially assigned to astronaut support duties for launch and landing, she also worked Advanced Projects for the Astronaut Office. She also performed CAPCOM duties in mission control. Melroy served on the &quot;Columbia&quot; Reconstruction Team as the lead for the crew module and served as deputy project manager for the &quot;Columbia&quot; crew survival investigation team. In her final position, she served as branch chief for the Orion branch of the Astronaut Office.

Melroy served as pilot on two flights (STS-92 in 2000 and STS-112 in 2002), and was the mission commander on STS-120 in 2007, making her the second woman to command a Space Shuttle mission (after Eileen Collins). The STS-120 crew visited the station during Expedition 16, commanded by Peggy Whitson. Whitson was the first female ISS commander, making the STS-120 mission the first time that two female mission commanders were in orbit at the same time.

She has logged over 924 hours (over 38 days) in space.

====Spaceflight experience====

* STS-92 &quot;Discovery&quot; (October 11–24, 2000) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the 13-day flight, the seven member crew attached the Z1 Truss and Pressurized Mating Adapter 3 to the International Space Station using &quot;Discovery&quot;″s robotic arm and performed four spacewalks to configure these elements. This expansion of the ISS opened the door for future assembly missions and prepared the station for its first resident crew. The STS-92 mission was accomplished in 202 orbits, traveling 5.3 million miles in 12 days, 21 hours, 40 minutes and 25 seconds.

* STS-112 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (October 7–18, 2002) launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. STS-112 was an International Space Station assembly mission during which the crew conducted joint operations with the Expedition-5 by delivering and installing the S1 Truss (the third piece of the station&#x27;s 11-piece Integrated Truss Structure). It took three spacewalks to outfit and activate the new component, during which Melroy acted as internal spacewalk choreographer. STS-112 was the first shuttle mission to use a camera on the External Tank, providing a live view of the launch to flight controllers and NASA TV viewers. The mission was accomplished in 170 orbits, traveling 4.5 million miles in 10 days, 19 hours, and 58 minutes.

* STS-120 &quot;Discovery&quot; (October 23 – November 7, 2007) launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center. During the mission, the Node 2 element named &quot;Harmony&quot; was delivered to the International Space Station. This element opened up the capability for future international laboratories to be added to the station. In addition, the P6 Solar Array was re-located from the Z1 Truss to the end of the port side of the Integrated Truss Structure. During the re-deploy of the array, the array panels snagged and were damaged. An unplanned spacewalk was successfully performed to repair the array. The mission was accomplished in 238 orbits, traveling 6.2 million miles in 15 days, 2 hours, and 23 minutes.

====Deputy administrator====

In November 2020, Melroy was announced as a member of President-elect Joe Biden&#x27;s presidential transition Agency Review Team, where her role was to support transition efforts related to NASA. This fueled speculation that Melroy was under consideration for the role of NASA Administrator in the Biden administration (then-Administrator James Bridenstine had indicated that he did not intend to stay in the role under Biden, even if asked). 

On April 16, 2021, The White House announced their intent to nominate Melroy to be NASA&#x27;s deputy administrator, under former Democratic Senator Bill Nelson, who was nominated by the White House on March 19, 2021, to be the agency&#x27;s administrator. On April 22, 2021, her nomination was sent to the Senate. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing on May 20, 2021, in which Melroy won strong bipartisan support to be deputy administrator. During her hearing, Melroy expressed support for extending the lifetime of the International Space Station, and said she would work closely with Administrator Bill Nelson in running the agency. 

On June 16, 2021, her nomination was reported out of the Senate Commerce Committee by voice vote, and the following day, her nomination was confirmed by the full Senate by unanimous consent. On June 21, 2021, she was sworn into office by administrator Bill Nelson.

== Personal life ==
Melroy is married to Douglas Hollett, a geologist, who was previously acting assistant secretary for fossil energy in the United States Department of Energy and vice president for Southeast Asia exploration at Marathon Oil.

<text>Jeffrey Shears Ashby (born June 16, 1954) is an American mechanical engineer, and former naval officer and aviator, test pilot and NASA astronaut, a veteran of three Space Shuttle missions. He is a retired Captain in the U.S. Navy. He currently works for Blue Origin as chief of mission assurance.

==Personal data==
Jeff Ashby was born on June 16, 1954, in Dallas, Texas, and grew up in Evergreen, Colorado, southwest of Denver. He graduated from Evergreen High School in 1972. He attended the University of Idaho as a member of the school&#x27;s joint Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) program, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering in 1976. He later earned a Master of Science degree in aviation systems from the University of Tennessee in 1993.

==Naval career==
Ashby is a 1986 graduate of the Navy Fighter Weapons School, also known as &quot;TOPGUN&quot;, and the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. As a test pilot in the U.S. Navy, Ashby helped develop the F/A-18 aircraft and flew the aircraft in combat missions as part of Operation Desert Storm and Operation Southern Watch during and after the Gulf War and as part of Operation Continue Hope in Somalia. He was the Navy Attack Aviator of the Year in 1991. Ashby commanded a Fighter Squadron stationed aboard the aircraft carrier ; in 1994, his squadron was designated the top F/A-18 squadron in the Navy.

During Desert Storm while based on the &quot;USS&quot; Midway (CV-41), Ashby became the first F/A-18 pilot to deploy the Walleye TV guided bomb in combat. During that mission, his F/A-18A Hornet from VFA-195 deployed a Walleye II to attack a T-shaped building at Umm Qasr Naval Base. According to him, it was also the first time that his Air Wing (Carrier Air Wing 5) had used the Walleye in combat. 

Later in the war, on February 13, 1991, Ashby and his wingman found and destroyed a camouflaged Iraqi Super Frelon helicopter which had been armed with Exocet cruise missiles that could&#x27;ve attacked the &quot;Midway&quot;. Ashby released a Walleye I into the helicopter and brought back TV footage of the attack back to &quot;Midway&quot;. This allowed the Persian Gulf carriers to move closer to Kuwait. After the war, the aircraft he flew on the Super Frelon strike (&quot;NF-104&quot;), was displayed at NAF Atsugi in Japan in May 1991.

Ashby accumulated over 7,000 flight hours and 1,000 carrier landings during six aircraft carrier deployments in his Navy career.

==NASA career==
Ashby was selected as an astronaut candidate in December 1994 at age 40. He was initially scheduled to be the pilot on STS-85 in 1997 but was replaced due to a family illness. He piloted Space Shuttle missions STS-93 in July 1999 and STS-100 in April 2001, and commanded STS-112 in October 2002.

His first flight, aboard &quot;Columbia&quot;, deployed the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Ashby&#x27;s latter two flights aboard &quot;Endeavour&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot; were the sixth and ninth assembly missions for the International Space Station. He has traveled over 11 million miles, flown 436 orbits around the Earth, and logged over 660 hours (27.5 days) in space.

==Post-NASA career==
Ashby was hired by Jeff Bezos&#x27;s private spaceflight company Blue Origin as the Chief of Mission Assurance, where he works to assure safety for human space flight. He lives in Twin Lakes, Lake County, Colorado.

On July 15, 2019, Ashby sustained severe injuries after falling 500 feet near the summit of La Plata Peak mountain. He was located later that night and transported to the hospital after being recovered the following morning.

<text>David Alexander Wolf (born August 23, 1956) is an American astronaut, medical doctor and electrical engineer. Wolf has been to space four times. Three of his spaceflights were short-duration Space Shuttle missions, the first of which was STS-58 in 1993, and his most recent spaceflight was STS-127 in 2009. Wolf also took part in a long-duration mission aboard the Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot; which lasted 128 days, and occurred during Mir EO-24. He was brought to &quot;Mir&quot; aboard STS-86 in September 1997, and landed aboard STS-89 in January 1998. In total Wolf has logged more than 4,040 hours in space. He is also a veteran of seven spacewalks totaling 41hrs 17min in both Russian and American spacesuits.

==Education==
David A. Wolf was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States and graduated from North Central High School. Wolf then went on to earn a degree in electrical engineering from Purdue University, where he graduated with distinction and became a brother in the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. In 1982, he earned a medical degree from Indiana University School of Medicine. He subsequently trained as a flight surgeon with the United States Air Force. Wolf joined the staff of Johnson Space Center in 1983 and investigated the physiological effects of microgravity.

==Honors and organizations==
David Wolf has received numerous awards and honors. He is a recipient of the NASA Exceptional Engineering Achievement Medal in 1990 and NASA Inventor of the Year in 1992. Wolf received an Academic Achievement Award upon graduation from medical school. He received the Carl R. Ruddell scholarship award for research in medical ultrasonic signal and image processing. He is a member of Eta Kappa Nu and Phi Eta Sigma honorary societies. Wolf has received 15 U.S. Patents and over 20 Space Act Awards primarily for 3-dimensional tissue engineering technologies, earning the Texas State Bar Patent of the Year in 1994. He has published over 40 technical papers.

Dave Wolf is a member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the Aerospace Medical Association, the Experimental Aircraft Association, the International Aerobatic Club, and the Indiana Air National Guard (retired).

The City of Indianapolis honored Wolf by naming Marion County Bridge 0501F (carrying E. 82nd St. over the White River) the &quot;Astronaut David Wolf Bridge.&quot;

==NASA career==
David Wolf began his NASA career in the Medical Sciences Division at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. He was responsible for engineering development and spacecraft avionics integration of the American Flight Echocardiograph for investigating cardiovascular physiology in microgravity. Upon completion, he was assigned as chief engineer for design of the Space Station medical facility, directly responsible for multidisciplinary team management, requirements definition, system design, spacecraft systems integration, project schedule, functional and safety verification, and budgetary authority. Dave Wolf was selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate in 1990. He completed 18 months of training before being qualified for flight. He was assigned to Kennedy Space Center in Florida where he was involved in Orbiter vehicle processing and testing and as a Capcom (including for the historic docking of Space Shuttle Atlantis with Space Station Mir in 1995). He is an expert in Extravehicular Activity (Spacewalk), Spacesuit design, and Rendezvous navigation. Some of his other qualifications include Robotic Manipulator System (Robot Arm) operations, on-orbit systems repair, computer networking, and as Shuttle re-entry flight deck engineer.

During his training for a Mir expedition, he lived and trained in Star City, Russia at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. Wolf became fluent in Russian, as all of his training there was in Russian.

Wolf and fellow Jewish astronaut Jeffrey A. Hoffman had &quot;a running battle, a running argument on who has the longest dreidel spin.&quot; Other Jewish artifacts he took into space and brought back include &quot;a yad – a Torah pointer, and .. a small menorah.&quot;

==Spaceflight experience==

===STS-58===
David Wolf served as mission specialist 3 aboard &quot;Columbia&quot; during the STS-58 mission. STS-58, designated Spacelab Life Sciences 2, was the second dedicated mission to study regulatory physiology, cardiovascular/cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and neuroscience. The mission lasted 14 days, 0 hours, 12 minutes and 32 seconds. &quot;Columbia&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California. At the time of landing STS-58 was the longest duration mission flown.

===Mir Expedition 24===
Wolf flew aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot; on STS-86 in September 1997. Wolf was only on board for a short time as he was being transported to the Russian &quot;Mir&quot; space station. &quot;Atlantis&quot; docked with the &quot;Mir&quot; space station on September 27, 1997, which marked the start of Dave Wolf&#x27;s stay on &quot;Mir&quot;.

David Wolf spent 128 days aboard space station &quot;Mir&quot;. He conducted a number of experiments and studies including, advanced microgravity tissue engineering techniques, electromagnetic levitation platform capability, colloid behavior, radio-tracer studies of altered human erythropoetic function, and human microgravity physiology studies. During his stay, there were a number of systems failures including multiple failed spacecraft systems, including atmospheric life support, three total power system failures, loss of attitude control, primary computer system failure, humidity separation system loss. An emergency ingress had to be made during an EVA performed in the Russian Orlan space suit due to airlock hatch failure. The entire mission and training were conducted solely in Russian.

While aboard &quot;Mir&quot;, Wolf became the first American to vote from space, casting a ballot in a 1997 local election.

STS-89 was David Wolf&#x27;s return ride home to earth. STS-89 docked with &quot;Mir&quot; on January 24, 1998, marking the end of Wolf&#x27;s stay on &quot;Mir&quot;. &quot;Endeavour&quot; touched down on January 31, 1998.

===STS-112===
Dave Wolf flew aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot; during the STS-112 mission. STS-112 delivered the S1 truss segment the International Space Station (ISS). &quot;Atlantis&quot; launched on October 7, 2002, from Kennedy Space Center. Wolf conducted 3 spacewalks, to install the S1 truss segment and other EVA hardware. He spent a total of 19hrs and 1 minute outside the ISS. &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed on October 18, 2002, ending STS-112 at 10 days, 19 hours, 58 minutes and 44 seconds.

===STS-127===
David Wolf last flew on &quot;Endeavour&quot; during the STS-127 (2J/A) mission. The STS-127 launched on July 15, 2009, and the mission delivered the Japanese Experiment Logistics Module – Exposed Section (ELM-ES) and new expedition member Timothy Kopra. STS-127 was originally scheduled to launch in June 2009 but was delayed after a leak was detected at the gaseous hydrogen vent line. A second attempt was made 3 days after the first try but was scrubbed for the same problem. A third launch attempt was canceled due to bad weather and a further delay occurred when lightning struck near the pad. Wolf conducted 3 spacewalks, totaling 18hrs 24min. STS-127 landed on July 31, 2009, and lasted 15 days, 16hrs, 44min and 58seconds.

<text>Gary Bruce Bettman (born June 2, 1952) is an American sports executive who serves as the commissioner of the National Hockey League (NHL), a post he has held since February 1, 1993. Previously, Bettman was a senior vice president and general counsel to the National Basketball Association (NBA). Bettman is a graduate of Cornell University and New York University School of Law. Bettman was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2018.

He oversaw the expansion of the NHL&#x27;s footprint across the United States, with eight new teams added during his tenure, bringing the NHL to 32 teams since the start of the 2021–22 season. In May 2014, Bettman was named &quot;sports executive of the year&quot; by the &quot;SportsBusiness Journal&quot; and &quot;SportsBusiness Daily&quot;. In 2016, Bettman was inducted as a member of the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

Bettman&#x27;s tenure in the NHL has been controversial. He has often been criticized for attempting to give the game a mass appeal, and for expanding the league into non-traditional hockey markets such as the Sun Belt at the expense of the more traditional markets in Canada and the Northern United States. Bettman has also been a central figure of three labor stoppages, including the 2004–05 NHL lockout that saw the entire season canceled. These controversies have made him unpopular with many fans around the league.

==Education and family==
Bettman was born to a Jewish family in Queens, New York. He studied industrial and labor relations at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he was a brother of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, and graduated in 1974. After receiving a Juris Doctor degree from New York University School of Law in 1977, Bettman joined the New York City law firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz &amp; Mendelsohn.

Bettman lives with his wife, Shelli, and their three children Lauren, Jordan, and Brittany. He is a resident of Saddle River, New Jersey. His half-brother Jeffrey Pollack is also a sports executive and served as President of the XFL from 2018 to 2021.

==NBA==
Bettman joined the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1981, serving mainly in the marketing and legal departments. Bettman rose to third in command of the NBA, spending many years as the league&#x27;s general counsel and senior vice president. Bettman played a key role in the development of the soft salary cap system implemented and agreed by the NBA in 1983, a system it continues to use today.

==NHL commissioner==
On December 12, 1992, Bettman was elected as the first commissioner of the National Hockey League (NHL). He took office on February 1, 1993; until July 1 he served alongside Gil Stein, who served as the NHL&#x27;s final president. The owners hired Bettman with the mandate of selling the game in the U.S. market, ending labor unrest, completing expansion plans, and modernizing the views of the &quot;old guard&quot; within the ownership ranks.

===Expansion, relocation and realignment===
When Bettman started as commissioner, the league had already expanded by three teams to 24 starting with the 1991–92 season, and two more were set to be announced by the expansion committee: the Florida Panthers and Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, who would begin play in 1993–94. Led by Bettman, the league focused expansion and relocation efforts during the rest of the 1990s on the American South, working to expand the league&#x27;s footprint across the country. The Nashville Predators (1998), Atlanta Thrashers (1999), Minnesota Wild (2000), and Columbus Blue Jackets (2000) completed this expansion period, bringing the NHL to 30 teams. In addition, four franchises relocated during the 1990s under Bettman: The Minnesota North Stars to Dallas (1993), the Quebec Nordiques to Denver (1995), the original Winnipeg Jets to Phoenix (1996), and the Hartford Whalers to North Carolina (1997).

This move towards southern markets was heavily criticized as well, however, with fans in Canada and the Northern United States lamenting the move away from &quot;traditional hockey markets&quot;. Critics have also accused Bettman of having an &quot;anti-Canadian&quot; agenda, citing the relocation of the franchises in Quebec City and Winnipeg and his apparent refusal to help stop it, along with the aborted sale of the Nashville Predators in 2007 to interests that would have moved the team to Hamilton, Ontario. Jim Balsillie accused Bettman of forcing the Predators to end negotiations with him to purchase the team. Bettman was satirized in this vein as the character &quot;Harry Buttman&quot; in the 2006 Canadian movie &quot;Bon Cop, Bad Cop&quot;.

However, Bettman also championed the Canadian assistance plan, a revenue sharing agreement that saw American teams give money to help support the four small-market Canadian teams—Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa, and Vancouver—throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s.

The results of expanding to southern markets has been mixed. There has been significant growth in the sport of hockey at the grassroots level with children in the U.S. South playing the game in increasing numbers.

However, some of these southern teams have not been financially successful. The Phoenix Coyotes eventually filed for bankruptcy in May 2009, after incurring several hundred million dollars of losses since their 1996 move from Winnipeg. Under Bettman, the league then took control over the team later that year in order to stabilize the club&#x27;s operations and then resell it to a new owner who would be committed to stay in the Phoenix market. It took several years for the League to find a viable ownership group, even then the new ownership group was unable to secure a new arena for the team in the 2020s and they relocated to Salt Lake City in 2024.

After joining the league in 1999, the Atlanta Thrashers suffered financial losses and ownership struggles, while appearing in the playoffs only one time. In 2011 they were sold to True North Sports and Entertainment, who then relocated the team to Winnipeg, a stark reversal of the league&#x27;s attempts to expand into the southern markets.

During the late 1990s round of expansion, the league revised its four-division alignment into one containing six divisions that eventually each contained five teams. At the time, seventeen of the league&#x27;s thirty teams were based in the Eastern Time Zone, meaning that the two westernmost such teams (Detroit Red Wings and Columbus Blue Jackets) were compelled to compete in the Western Conference, which gave a large proportion of their road games an unfavorably late start on local television. There were other grievances with the alignment—for example, the Dallas Stars, being in the Central Time Zone, were not pleased to be in the same division as the Coyotes and the three Californian teams.

Detroit and Columbus were fierce opponents of Balsillie&#x27;s bids for a team in Hamilton (proposals which would have seen another team added to the Eastern Time Zone) but also strong backers of Winnipeg&#x27;s bid for the Thrashers, largely since this took the franchise out of the Eastern Time Zone and thus provided them a path to be realigned into the Eastern Conference. Following intense negotiations brokered by Bettman among the owners and with the players, the NHL reverted to a four-division alignment in time for the 2013–14 season, with two divisions of seven teams each for the West and two divisions containing the sixteen remaining Eastern Time Zone teams for the East.

An expansion occurred in the summer of 2017, with Las Vegas, Nevada, gaining the league&#x27;s 31st team, the Vegas Golden Knights. Bettman later explained that the NHL&#x27;s new divisional alignment precluded the adding of more franchises in the Eastern Time Zone, at least for the time being.

The most recent expansion occurred on December 4, 2018, with the announcement that Seattle would be the league&#x27;s 32nd team. The Seattle Kraken started in the 2021–22 NHL season. Bettman chose Seattle as it is one of the fastest growing cities.

===Labor unrest===
Although Bettman was tasked with putting an end to the NHL&#x27;s labor problems, the league has locked out its players three times during Bettman&#x27;s tenure.

====1994–95 lockout====
The 1994–95 lockout lasted 104 days, causing the season to be shortened from 84 to 48 games. A key issue during the lockout was the desire to aid small-market teams. Led by Bettman, the owners insisted on a salary cap, changes to free agency, and arbitration in the hopes of limiting escalating salaries. The union instead proposed a luxury tax system. The negotiations were at times bitter, with Chris Chelios famously issuing a veiled threat against Bettman, suggesting that Bettman should be &quot;worried about [his] family and [his] well-being&quot;, because &quot;Some crazed fans, or even a player [...] might take matters into their own hands and figure they get Bettman out of the way.&quot;

Last-ditch negotiations saved the season in January 1995. And while the owners failed to achieve a full salary cap, the union agreed to a cap on rookie contracts, changes to arbitration, and restrictive rules for free agency that would not grant a player unrestricted free agency until he turned 31. The deal was initially hailed as a win for the owners.

====2004–05 lockout====
By the end of the deal in 2004, the owners were claiming that player salaries had grown far faster than revenues, and that the league as a whole lost over US$300 million in 2002–03.

As a result, on September 15, 2004, Bettman announced that the owners again locked the players out prior to the start of the 2004–05 season. Five months later, Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season:
The NHL therefore became the first North American professional sports league to cancel an entire season because of a labor stoppage, and the second league to cancel a postseason (the first being Major League Baseball, which lost its postseason in 1994 due to a strike).

As in 1994, the owners&#x27; position was predicated around the need for a salary cap. In an effort to ensure solidarity amongst the owners, the league&#x27;s governors voted to give Bettman the right to unilaterally veto any union offer as long as he had the backing of just eight owners. The players initially favored a luxury tax system, and a 5% rollback on player salaries—later increased to 24 percent. As the threat of a canceled season loomed, the players agreed to accept a salary cap, but the two sides could not come to terms on numbers before the deadline expired.

Following the cancellation of the season, negotiations progressed quickly, as a revolt within the union led to National Hockey League Players Association president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin taking negotiations over from executive director Bob Goodenow. Goodenow would resign from the NHLPA in July 2005. By early July, the two sides had agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement. The deal featured a hard salary cap, linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues, a 24% rollback on salaries, and free agency beginning after seven years of service. After being panned as one of the worst managers in business in 2004 for canceling the season, Bettman was lauded as one of the best in 2005 for his role in bringing &quot;cost certainty&quot; to the NHL.

====2012–13 lockout====
The 2012–13 NHL lockout lasted from September 15, 2012, to January 19, 2013, after the owners and players failed to agree on a new collective bargaining agreement. The owners&#x27; original offer retained the framework established following the 2004–05 NHL lockout but made numerous changes to player salary and movement rights, including reducing the players&#x27; share of hockey-related revenues from 57 percent to 46 percent, introducing term limits on contracts, eliminating salary arbitration, and changing free agency rules. As the deadline for a work stoppage approached, the union unsuccessfully challenged the league&#x27;s ability to lock out players of the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers (appealing to the Alberta Labour Relations Board), and the Montreal Canadiens (appealing to the Quebec Labour Relations Board).

After unsuccessful negotiations, the NHL and NHLPA agreed to mediation under the auspices of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service on November 26. The sides met with mediators on November 28 and 29, but the mediators quit after that point, determining they could not make any progress reconciling the two parties&#x27; demands, and thus both sides were on their own again. After talks broke down again in December, rumors leaked that the NHLPA planned on filing a &quot;disclaimer of interest&quot; (a quicker, less formal way to dissolve the players&#x27; union, compared with decertification)
and, with collective bargaining no longer in effect, pursuing an antitrust lawsuit against the NHL. The NHL responded on December 14 by filing a class action suit with the U.S. District Court in New York seeking to establish that its lockout was legal. Included in the lawsuit was a request for all existing player contracts to be &quot;void and unenforceable&quot;, should the NHLPA be dissolved, resulting in all NHL players becoming free agents. The league also filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board, stating that the union had been negotiating in bad faith and that its threat to disclaim interest was a negotiating ploy that violated the collective bargaining process. In a vote conducted from December 17 to 21, the players authorized the union&#x27;s executive board to file a disclaimer of interest until January 2, 2013, though it did not proceed with the filing.

On January 6, 2013, a tentative deal was reached on a new collective bargaining agreement to end the lockout. The terms included a limit of eight years on contract extensions and seven years on new contracts, a salary floor of US$44 million and a salary cap of US$60 million (a two-year transition period allowed teams to spend up to US$70.2 million in the deal&#x27;s first season, prorated for the season length, and up to a salary cap of US$64.3 million in the second season), a maximum 50-percent variance in the salaries over the course of a contract, mandatory acceptance of arbitration awards under US$3.5 million, no realignment, and an amnesty period to buy out contracts that did not fit under the salary cap. After the union ratified the deal, the lockout ended.

A 48-game regular season schedule was then played, starting on January 19, 2013, and ending on April 28, 2013, with no inter-conference games. Despite the lockout, the average attendance for the season was 17,768, up 2.6 percent from the previous year, while TV ratings in both Canada and the United States also increased.

===Television===
Bettman quickly accomplished one of his stated goals, signing a five-year, $155 million deal with the Fox Broadcasting Company to broadcast NHL games nationally in the U.S. beginning in the 1994–95 season. The deal was significant, as a network television contract in the United States was long thought unattainable during the presidency of John Ziegler. The Fox deal is perhaps best remembered for the FoxTrax puck, which while generally popular according to Fox Sports, generated a great deal of controversy from longtime fans of the game.

Canadians were also upset as the league gave preference to Fox ahead of CBC for scheduling of playoff games, as Pat Hickey of the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; wrote that the schedule was &quot;just another example of how the N.H.L. snubs its nose at the country that invented hockey and its fans.&quot; The controversy repeated itself in 2007, as CBC was once again given second billing to Versus&#x27;s coverage of the playoffs.

Despite falling ratings, Bettman negotiated a five-year, $600 million deal with ABC and ESPN in 1998. It was the largest television contract the NHL ever signed. The $120 million per year that ABC and ESPN paid for rights dwarfed the $5.5 million that the NHL received from American national broadcasts in 1991–92.

The NHL&#x27;s television fortunes faded after the ABC/ESPN deal. In 2004, the league could manage a revenue sharing deal with only NBC, with no money paid up front by the network. Also, coming out of the lockout, ESPN declined its $60 million option for the NHL&#x27;s cable rights in 2005–06. While wishing to retain the NHL, it stated the cost was overvalued. However, Bettman was able to negotiate a deal with Comcast to air the NHL on the Outdoor Life Network channel, which was later renamed Versus in 2006. The three-year deal was worth $207.5 million. Bettman was heavily criticized for the move to Versus, as detractors argued that the league lost a great deal of exposure since moving to the much smaller network. The TV deal with Versus was later extended through the 2010–11 season.

In January 2011, Comcast acquired NBC Universal, and then in April of that year Bettman negotiated a new 10-year deal with the merged media company, worth nearly $2 billion. Comcast/NBC also announced that both Versus and NBC would increase their number of games. In signing this new TV deal, Bettman rejected offers from ESPN and others. Reaction to this new TV deal was mixed, noting that the NHL still lacked the exposure that ESPN could provide, while at the same time acknowledging that ESPN might not devote as much attention and promotion as Comcast/NBC would since the former was committed to various other sports properties. Comcast/NBC then renamed Versus as the NBC Sports Network on January 2, 2012.

On November 26, 2013, Bettman announced that the NHL had sold twelve seasons&#x27; worth of exclusive Canadian national broadcast rights to Rogers Media, who would broadcast games across its numerous platforms, including Sportsnet, Sportsnet One, and City, at a price of CAD$5.2 billion. &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; would continue on the CBC for the next four seasons, but under a sub-licensing deal the public broadcaster would give Rogers free airtime to air the broadcasts. CBC would be allotted time during the broadcasts to promote its other programming. These moves left Bell Media and its TSN networks shut out of NHL broadcasts except for its regional properties.

===XM Satellite Radio===
Bettman hosts an hour-long weekly radio show on NHL Home Ice (XM 204). The show provides fans with an opportunity to speak directly with the commissioner and voice any questions, comments, or concerns related to ice hockey.

===NHL at the Olympic Games===
The NHL first participated in ice hockey at the Olympic Games in the 1998 tournament in Nagano. The hockey tournament has since become one of the biggest and most profitable events at the Olympics. Bettman spoke at the World Hockey Summit in 2010, and stated that being in the Olympics was a &quot;mixed bag&quot; for the NHL, and its experiences outside of North America tended not to be positive. He gave a list of issues that he wanted to see resolved in consultation with the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association, which included more control over marketing and promotion, timing of games being televised in North America, the hiatus in the NHL regular season schedule, ability for NHL team executives to access their players, travel concerns, and risk of injuries.

===Salary===
For the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, Bettman received $8.8 million in total compensation by the NHL. By 2013–14, his salary had increased to $9.5 million, according to the NHL&#x27;s filings with the Internal Revenue Service.

For the 2008–09 season, Bettman was paid $7.23 million, of which $5,529,490 was his base salary. It was $3.77 million prior to the 2004–05 lockout.

===Public perception===

Bettman&#x27;s controversial decisions, as well as presiding over three labor stoppages, have made him unpopular among many NHL fans. He is regularly booed in various arenas around the league, ranging from his appearances at the yearly NHL Entry Draft to his annual presentation of the Stanley Cup to the league champions at the end of the playoffs. When asked if the booing ever bothers him, Bettman said, &quot;Not doing this job, no. You&#x27;re always going to have critics. What I&#x27;ve always told people: If I take the ice and it&#x27;s completely silent, then I&#x27;ll know I&#x27;m in trouble.&quot;

In another interview, he replied that he says to himself, &quot;You know what, [the fans] got an opinion. We may not agree on everything, but they care, and I&#x27;ll take that.&quot; Still, writers such as Adam Proteau of &quot;The Hockey News&quot; and James O&#x27;Brien of NBC Sports&#x27; &quot;Pro Hockey Talk&quot; have advocated that someone else should hand out the Cup instead of Bettman so that the incessant booing does not spoil the ceremony. In 2013, the sports blog &quot;Grantland&quot; stated that Bettman&#x27;s Cup presentations have &quot;evolved into one of the most awkward traditions in all of sports&quot;.

Playing upon those perceptions, 2006 Canadian movie &quot;Bon Cop, Bad Cop&quot; cast Rick Howland as &quot;Harry Buttman&quot;, a Gary Bettman parody, a hockey league commissioner who wants to move Montreal&#x27;s hockey team to Houston.

In April 2017, Bettman announced that the NHL would not be taking part in the 2018 Winter Olympics, a decision that was confirmed in November 2017 and was widely unpopular among players.

==Honors==
On May 21, 2014, Bettman was named &quot;Sports Executive of the Year&quot; by the SportsBusiness Journal and SportsBusiness Daily at the publications&#x27; annual Sports Business Awards event in New York. At the same ceremony, the NHL was named &quot;Sports League of the Year&quot;, the second time in four years the NHL had been so honored. The 2014 Bridgestone NHL Winter Classic was named &quot;Sports Event of the Year&quot;. Bettman said, &quot;It&#x27;s almost an out-of-body experience. This time of year, I&#x27;m normally presenting a trophy and getting booed. To receive one and get applause is really quite novel.&quot;

CBS Sports hockey writer Chris Peters said, &quot;There&#x27;s no question the game has grown throughout the United States with participation in the sport at an all-time high, in addition to rising revenues for the NHL itself. The game is also reaching its best exposure through its TV deal with NBC Sports. That could be one of Bettman&#x27;s crowning achievements. The remarkable thing about the NHL is that it remains incredibly strong, if not stronger coming out of two lockouts in the last decade. Gary Bettman…may not be perfect…but (he) is a good leader for the NHL and probably deserves some recognition for it.&quot;

In 2016, Bettman was inducted as a member of the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

Following the retirements of David Stern on February 1, 2014, and Bud Selig on January 25, 2015, Bettman became the longest-serving active commissioner in professional sports.

In November 2018, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

In January 2023, Bettman was the recipient of SportsBusiness Journal&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement award.

<doc id="468055" wikidata="Q4951523" url="?curid=468055" title="Box Hill, Victoria">
<text>Box Hill is an eastern suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, east of the city&#x27;s Central Business District (CBD), located within the City of Whitehorse local government area. Box Hill recorded a population of 14,353 at the 2021 census.

Founded as a township in the 1850s, Box Hill has grown over the following century into a small city with its own central business district (CBD). It formed the centre of the former local government of the City of Box Hill and has its own suburbs, including Box Hill North and Box Hill South. In the 1950s, Box Hill was absorbed into Melbourne as part of its eastward expansion. 

Today, Box Hill is notable for its large Chinese community, being one of the largest in Melbourne, and is home to the city&#x27;s tallest high-rise buildings outside the CBD.

A major transport hub for Melbourne&#x27;s eastern suburbs, Box Hill is home to one of the city&#x27;s busiest train stations, located beneath Box Hill Central. It is also served by the route 109 tram and numerous bus routes.

== History ==
=== Pre-European settlement ===
The Wurundjeri Woiwurrung people lived in the area now called Box Hill for many thousands of years. They used the many creeks in the area as a source of food and water, including Bushy Creek in the north.

=== 19th century ===

Box Hill was first settled by the squatter Arundel Wrighte, formerly of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, who, in 1838 took up a pastoral lease on the land he had previously explored in the Bushy Creek area. The first permanent settlers, Thomas Toogood and his wife Edith, purchased in 1841 and Wrighte built a house on his property, &quot;Marionvale&quot;, in 1844. The Pioneers&#x27; Memorial, which can be found in front of the town hall, is made from a chimney stone, taken from Wrighte&#x27;s original house. It was not until after 1850, however, that Crown lands were subdivided and sold. Traffic along a main road running through the district encouraged the building of a hotel at Box Hill in 1853. Its owner named it the White Horse hotel and the name was bestowed on the road. Box Hill Post Office opened on 1 February 1861, being the first official use of the name. The postmaster, Silas Padgham proposed the name, derived from Box Hill, Surrey, England, near his birthplace.

In 1871, Box Hill township&#x27;s population was 154 and the district relied on orchards, vineyards and mixed farming. The extension of the railway line from Camberwell to Lilydale in 1882 included a station at Box Hill, but there were also stations at Canterbury and Surrey Hills, to the west. They attracted subdivisions and development ahead of Box Hill. Growth came, though, with a school opening in Box Hill in 1887, then known as State School 2838. The town became the seat of the Nunawading Shire Council, which met at the Box Hill Courthouse.

In the mid-1880s, Box Hill became a favoured area for landscape artists who wanted to paint the Australian bush &quot;en plein air&quot;. These artists, among them Arthur Streeton, Tom Roberts and Frederick McCubbin, established the Box Hill artists&#x27; camp, and formed what would become known as the Heidelberg School, the first distinctively Australian movement in Western art.

=== 20th century ===

Unlike suburbs closer to Melbourne, Box Hill lacked the web of tramlines, which promoted residential development beyond the reach of the railway line. In 1916–17, tramlines reached the western edge of what in a short time would be the Box Hill Municipality, at Burwood, Mont Albert and Wattle Park. The years after World War I saw Box Hill&#x27;s turn for residential growth. A girls&#x27; technical school was built in 1924 and a boys&#x27; high school in 1930. During World War II a boys&#x27; technical school was opened.

The new town hall on Whitehorse Road opened in April 1935. One of the arguments for its construction was that &quot;the boon it would prove to the local brickworks, which had just resumed production after a period of suspension&quot;.

The Box Hill Presbyterian (now Uniting) Church building was originally the West Melbourne Presbyterian Church built 1867 on the corner of Lonsdale and William Streets; a final service was held on 3 February 1935, following which the building was dismantled and re-erected on its present site, being opened in late 1935.

After the end of the Second World War, Box Hill was suburbanised, but Box Hill South and Box Hill North remained comparatively undeveloped.

==== Post-war development ====

Post-war housing expansion included a Housing Commission estate in Box Hill South. A district hospital opened in 1956. The shopping area enjoyed growth and prosperity which placed a significant strain upon its parking infrastructure by the end of the 1950s.

In 1954, the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Board of Works designated Box Hill as one of five district centres for metropolitan Melbourne. The plan has succeeded in Box Hill. In addition to the shopping centre, the Box Hill TAFE and several office buildings have strengthened its centrality in the region. Apart from commercial functions there are large reserves, with ovals in three directions, about a kilometre from Box Hill Central. Box Hill South lies between Canterbury Road and Burwood East, about two kilometres square. Its proximity to trams was better than Box Hill North&#x27;s and its residential growth was substantially pre- and early post-war. The Box Hill Golf Club is nearby and a linear park continues along Gardiners Creek. There have also been church-run or affiliated educational institutions, such as Kingswood College, Christian Brothers&#x27; Teachers&#x27; College and St. Leo&#x27;s College (1952 and 1957).

In 1971, a sister city relationship was forged with Matsudo, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. &quot;Box Hill&quot; is the name of a department store in Matsudo (:ja:ボックスヒル).

Box Hill City was amalgamated with Nunawading City on 15 December 1994, to form Whitehorse City, renewing the boundaries that began with the Nunawading Parish and subsequent Shire.

=== 21st century ===
More recently, Box Hill has experienced a construction boom, and is now home to high-rise buildings. These include the Australian Taxation Office&#x27;s Box Hill Tower, the Whitehorse Towers and the 36-storey Sky One, standing at 122 metres tall. More high-rises are under construction, including New Chinatown, a $450 million twin tower project which will serve as a modern &quot;sibling&quot; of the historic Chinatown in the CBD, with this development to consist of 10,000 square metres of mixed-purpose storefronts over three levels, a 4000-square-metre “Hawker Hall” containing street-style food stalls, a 1500-square-metre childcare centre, a Chinese language school and bookshop, Chinese herbalists, and a handful of Chinese and Western medicine clinics.

== Geography ==
=== Urban structure ===
Box Hill has a large central core that serves as one of the largest metropolitan centres outside of the Melbourne central business district. It has been a designated major centre in state and local planning documents since 1954 designed to serve as the main retail and commercial hub of Melbourne&#x27;s eastern suburbs.

Box Hill railway station forms the core of the central area. Taller residential and commercial buildings are clustered around this area which is surrounded on three sides by major roads. Through 2015 to the present, new taller residential buildings have been constructed on the north side of Whitehorse Road adjacent to Box Hill Gardens, including state and Commonwealth government offices.

=== Landmarks ===
Box Hill has a large shopping district, primarily concentrated along Station Street and Whitehorse Road and the two Box Hill Central shopping centres. Other smaller centres are located on Whitehorse Road near Middleborough Road and Station Street near Canterbury Road. 

In late 2007, the two shopping centres merged as a part of a large-scale redevelopment project of the precincts. They are now known as buildings &quot;South&quot; (Formerly Central Box Hill) and &quot;North&quot; (formerly Central Whitehorse,) or &quot;Box Hill Central&quot;, which further hosts the Box Hill Railway Station, and a bus interchange. 

Box Hill Hospital serves surrounding suburbs together with Epworth Eastern, a private hospital, which opened in 2005 in the same precinct.

Box Hill Library, part of the Whitehorse Manningham Regional Library Corporation, is a government funded library located near Box Hill Town Hall.

=== Parks and gardens ===
There are three main open spaces in Box Hill. These are the Box Hill Gardens, Surrey Park and R.H.L. Sparks Reserve. The majority of parks have sporting facilities and fields, including for baseball, archery and Australian football.

There are several smaller parks and gardens throughout the residential areas around the central business district.

Mandarin Chinese is the second most commonly spoken language (28.3%), followed by Cantonese (9.8%), Korean (1.7%), Hindi (1.3%) and Vietnamese (1.2%). Self-described non-religious people made up the largest single group at 46.3% of the population, followed by Catholics (13.5%), Buddhists (7.8%) and Anglicans (4.5%). 10.1% of Box Hill residents did not state their religious affiliation in the census. Compared to Australia as a whole, Box Hill residents are much less likely to be Australian-born, and are more likely to have stated &quot;No Religion&quot; on the census.

The complex also includes a large bus interchange, linking commuters to a broad range of destinations across most Melbourne suburbs.

Tram route 109, which runs along Whitehorse Road, was extended from Union Road, Mont Albert, to Box Hill and opened in May 2003. It runs to Port Melbourne via the city.

There are V/Line coaches that run from Melbourne (Southern Cross) to Mansfield / Mount Buller. The coach stop is opposite the Box Hill Town Hall on Whitehorse Road.

The final station on the first section of the Suburban Rail Loop railway is under construction at Box Hill, providing direct rail services to Cheltenham.

<text>Andrzej Ziemiański, also known as Patrick Shoughnessy (born 17 February 1960), is a Polish author of fantasy, science fiction, thriller and crime, who by 2012 have sold over 500,000 copies of his books. Ziemiański was educated as an architect and he holds a PhD in architecture.

Ziemiański is best known for his epic fantasy/sci-fi series Achaia. His &quot;Achaia&quot; series was deemed to be one of the most important novels in modern Polish fantasy and it was called by Science Fiction magazine a series, which started a new era. Ziemiański fashioned a world that transgressed the border between life and fiction. The main protagonist of the series, Achaia, became synonymous with a certain type of female character and numerous readers identified with her. The novel entered Polish fantasy canon, and the author became one of the most recognizable brands in the Polish publishing market.
His novels and short stories often top bestseller lists and popularity rankings. The author has been called the creator of &quot;Polish urban fantasy&quot; genre.

In 1997 he was one of the creators and the first chief editor of &quot;Fahrenheit&quot;, the first Polish Internet science fiction fanzine. In 2004, as he claims, he was thrown out by Eugeniusz Dębski. According to other members of the editorial office, Ziemiański left it himself.

== Biography ==
Andrzej Ziemiański was born in Wrocław, Poland, where he grew up and settled. He graduated from the Faculty of Architecture at Wroclaw University of Technology in 1983. Subsequently, he worked as a fellow researcher and professor in various institutions. In 1992, he acquired a PhD in technical sciences.

Ziemiański started publishing short stories and novels in 1978, at first in the sci-fi genre. However, his focus gradually changed and he wrote a mainstream novel &quot;Miecz Orientu&quot;, which was published in episodes in the prestigious &quot;Twórczość&quot; magazine. The novel was later published as a whole in 2006. During that time, Ziemiański would also publish using a pen name Patrick Shoughnessy (&quot;Przesiadka w piekle&quot;, 1991). Subsequently, the author withdrew from having his work published and remained silent for a decade.
Ziemiański returned to writing at the turn of the century instantly gaining fame and raising controversy. He quickly became one of the most prominent Polish writers. His short stories, such as &quot;Bomba Heisenberga&quot;, &quot;Autobahn nach Poznań&quot; or &quot;Zapach szkła&quot;, would win first prize in popularity polls among readers, and two of them (&quot;Autobahn nach Poznań&quot; and &quot;Zapach szkła&quot;) won Janusz A. Zajdel Award. At the 2002 Sfinks Awards, four various Ziemiański’s short stories won subsequently: seventh, third, second and first prize.
During that time, the first part of &quot;Achaia&quot; (2002) trilogy was published and it quickly became the bestselling book at the main Polish chain bookstore, Empik. The trilogy strengthened the author&#x27;s position by settling into the Polish canon of fantasy genre. The following &quot;Achaia&quot; volumes (as well as their continuation – &quot;Pomnik cesarzowej Achai&quot; [2012]) would top bestseller lists. Ziemiański&#x27;s other novels were also well-received leading publishers&#x27; books rankings .
From 2010, Ziemiański writes a blog regarding railways, which was awarded the first prize by the Social Media, Poland, in the category of Corporate Blog.

Since 2010, the author teaches Creative Writing at the Faculty of Journalism at University of Wroclaw.

Ziemiański&#x27;s novels and short stories were translated into Czech, Slovak and Russian language.

<doc id="468063" wikidata="Q1376047" url="?curid=468063" title="Algonquin Round Table">
<text>The Algonquin Round Table was a group of New York City writers, critics, actors, and wits. Gathering initially as part of a practical joke, members of &quot;The Vicious Circle&quot;, as they dubbed themselves, met for lunch each day at the Algonquin Hotel from 1919 until roughly 1929. At these luncheons they engaged in wisecracks, wordplay, and witticisms that, through the newspaper columns of Round Table members, were disseminated across the country.

Daily association with each other, both at the luncheons and outside of them, inspired members of the Circle to collaborate creatively. The entire group worked together successfully only once, however, to create a revue called &quot;No Sirree!&quot; which helped launch a Hollywood career for Round Tabler Robert Benchley.

In its ten years of association, the Round Table and a number of its members acquired national reputations, both for their contributions to literature and for their sparkling wit. Although some of their contemporaries, and later in life even some of its members, disparaged the group, its reputation has endured long after its dissolution.

==Origin==
The group that would become the Round Table began meeting in June 1919 as the result of a practical joke carried out by theatrical press agent John Peter Toohey. Toohey, annoyed at &quot;The New York Times&quot; drama critic Alexander Woollcott for refusing to plug one of Toohey&#x27;s clients (Eugene O&#x27;Neill) in his column, organized a luncheon supposedly to welcome Woollcott back from World War I, where he had been a correspondent for &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;. Instead, Toohey used the occasion to poke fun at Woollcott on a number of fronts. Woollcott&#x27;s enjoyment of the joke and the success of the event prompted Toohey to suggest that the group in attendance meet at the Algonquin each day for lunch.

The group first gathered in the Algonquin&#x27;s Pergola Room (later called the Oak Room) at a long rectangular table. As they increased in number, Algonquin manager Frank Case moved them to the Rose Room and a round table. Initially the group called itself &quot;The Board&quot; and the luncheons &quot;Board meetings&quot;. After being assigned a waiter named Luigi, the group re-christened itself &quot;Luigi Board&quot;. Finally, they became &quot;The Vicious Circle&quot; although &quot;The Round Table&quot; gained wide currency after a caricature by cartoonist Edmund Duffy of the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; portrayed the group sitting at a round table and wearing armor.

==Membership==

==Activities==
In addition to the daily luncheons, members of the Round Table worked and associated with each other almost constantly. The group was devoted to games, including cribbage and poker. The group had its own poker club, the Thanatopsis Literary and Inside Straight Club, which met at the hotel on Saturday nights. Regulars at the game included Kaufman, Adams, Broun, Ross and Woollcott, with non-Round Tablers Herbert Bayard Swope, silk merchant Paul Hyde Bonner, baking heir Raoul Fleischmann, actor Harpo Marx, and writer Ring Lardner sometimes sitting in. The group also played charades (which they called simply &quot;The Game&quot;) and the &quot;I can give you a sentence&quot; game, which spawned Dorothy Parker&#x27;s memorable sentence using the word &quot;horticulture&quot;: &quot;You can lead a horticulture but you can&#x27;t make her think.&quot;

Members often visited Neshobe Island, a private island co-owned by several &quot;Algonks&quot;—but governed by Woollcott as a &quot;benevolent tyrant&quot;, as his biographer Samuel Hopkins Adams charitably put it—located on several acres in the middle of Lake Bomoseen in Vermont. There they would engage in their usual array of games including wink murder, which they called simply &quot;Murder&quot;, plus croquet.

A number of Round Tablers were inveterate practical jokers, constantly pulling pranks on one another. As time went on the jokes became ever more elaborate. Harold Ross and Jane Grant once spent weeks playing a particularly memorable joke on Woollcott involving a prized portrait of himself. They had several copies made, each slightly more askew than the last, and would periodically secretly swap them out and then later comment to Woollcott &quot;What on earth is wrong with your portrait?&quot; until Woollcott was beside himself. Eventually they returned the original portrait.

==&quot;No Sirree!&quot;==
Given the literary and theatrical activities of the Round Table members, it was perhaps inevitable that they would write and stage their own revue. &quot;No Sirree!&quot;, staged for one night only in April 30, 1922, was a take-off of a then-popular European touring revue called &quot;La Chauve-Souris&quot;, directed by Nikita Balieff.

&quot;No Sirree!&quot; had its genesis at the studio of Neysa McMein, which served as something of a salon for Round Tablers away from the Algonquin. Acts included: &quot;Opening Chorus&quot; featuring Woollcott, Toohey, Kaufman, Connelly, Adams and Benchley with violinist Jascha Heifetz providing offstage, off-key accompaniment; &quot;He Who Gets Flapped&quot;, a musical number featuring the song &quot;The Everlastin&#x27; Ingenue Blues&quot; written by Dorothy Parker and performed by Robert Sherwood accompanied by &quot;chorus girls&quot; including Tallulah Bankhead, Helen Hayes, Ruth Gillmore, Lenore Ulric and Mary Brandon; &quot;Zowie, or the Curse of an Akins Heart&quot;; &quot;The Greasy Hag, an O&#x27;Neill Play in One Act&quot; with Kaufman, Connelly and Woollcott; and &quot;Mr. Whim Passes By—An A. A. Milne Play.&quot;

The only item of note to emerge from &quot;No Sirree!&quot; was Robert Benchley&#x27;s contribution, &quot;The Treasurer&#x27;s Report&quot;. Benchley&#x27;s disjointed parody so delighted those in attendance that Irving Berlin hired Benchley in 1923 to deliver the &quot;Report&quot; as part of Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Music Box Revue&quot; for $500 a week. In 1928, &quot;Report&quot; was later made into a short sound film in the Fox Movietone sound-on-film system by Fox Film Corporation. The film marked the beginning of a second career for Benchley in Hollywood.

With the success of &quot;No Sirree!&quot; the Round Tablers hoped to duplicate it with an &quot;official&quot; Vicious Circle production open to the public with material performed by professional actors. Kaufman and Connelly funded the revue, named &quot;The Forty-niners&quot;. The revue opened in November 1922 and was a failure, running for just 15 performances.

==Decline==
As members of the Round Table moved into ventures outside New York City, inevitably the group drifted apart. By the early 1930s the Vicious Circle was broken. Edna Ferber said she realized it when she arrived at the Rose Room for lunch one day in 1932 and found the group&#x27;s table occupied by a family from Kansas. Frank Case was asked what happened to the group. He shrugged and replied, &quot;What became of the reservoir at Fifth Avenue and Forty-Second Street? These things do not last forever.&quot; Some members of the group remained friends after its dissolution. Parker and Benchley in particular remained close up until his death in 1945, although her political leanings did strain their relationship. Others, as the group itself would come to understand when it gathered following Woollcott&#x27;s death in 1943, simply realized that they had nothing to say to one another.

==Public response and legacy==
Because a number of the members of the Round Table had regular newspaper columns, the activities and quips of various Round Table members were reported in the national press. This brought Round Tablers widely into the public consciousness as renowned wits.

Not all of their contemporaries were fans of the group. Their critics accused them of &quot;logrolling&quot;, or exchanging favorable plugs of one another&#x27;s works, and of rehearsing their witticisms in advance. James Thurber (who lived in the hotel) was a detractor of the group, accusing them of being too consumed by their elaborate practical jokes. H. L. Mencken, who was much admired by many in the Circle, was also a critic, commenting to fellow writer Anita Loos that &quot;their ideals were those of a vaudeville actor, one who is extremely &#x27;in the know&#x27; and inordinately trashy&quot;.

The group showed up in the 1923 best-seller &quot;Black Oxen&quot; by Gertrude Atherton. She sarcastically described a group she called &quot;the Sophisticates&quot;:

Groucho Marx, brother of Round Table associate Harpo, was never comfortable amidst the viciousness of the Vicious Circle. Therein he remarked &quot;The price of admission is a serpent&#x27;s tongue and a half-concealed stiletto.&quot; Even some members of the Round Table disparaged it later in life. Dorothy Parker in particular criticized the group.

Despite Parker&#x27;s bleak assessment and while it is true that some members of the Round Table are perhaps now &quot;famous for being famous&quot; instead of for their literary output, Round Table members and associates contributed to the literary landscape, including Pulitzer Prize-winning work by Circle members Kaufman, Connelly and Sherwood (who won four) and by associate Ferber and the legacy of Ross&#x27;s &quot;New Yorker&quot;. Others made lasting contributions to the realms of stage and screen — Tallulah Bankhead and Eva Le Gallienne became Broadway greats and the films of Harpo and Benchley remain popular; and Parker has remained renowned for her short stories and literary reviews.

The Algonquin Round Table, as well as the number of other literary and theatrical greats who lodged there, helped earn the Algonquin Hotel its status as a New York City Historic Landmark. The hotel was so designated in 1987. In 1996 the hotel was designated a national literary landmark by the Friends of Libraries USA based on the contributions of &quot;The Round Table Wits&quot;. The organization&#x27;s bronze plaque is attached to the front of the hotel.
Although the Rose Room was removed from the Algonquin in a 1998 remodel, the hotel paid tribute to the group by commissioning and hanging the painting &quot;A Vicious Circle&quot; by Natalie Ascencios, depicting the Round Table and also created a replica of the original table. The hotel occasionally stages an original musical production, &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot;, in the Oak Room. Its latest production started September 11, 2007 and ran through the end of the year.

A film about the members, &quot;The Ten-Year Lunch&quot; (1987), won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.
The dramatic film &quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot; (1994) recounts the Round Table from the perspective of Dorothy Parker.

<text>Earl of Kimberley, of Kimberley in the County of Norfolk, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1866 for the prominent Liberal politician John Wodehouse, 3rd Baron Wodehouse. During his long political career, he notably held office as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Secretary of State for the Colonies, Secretary of State for India and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. At first a Liberal like his father, he later joined the Labour Party, becoming the first Labour member of the House of Lords. His eldest son, the third Earl, represented Norfolk Mid in the House of Commons as a Liberal. Since 2002, the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the fifth Earl.

==Background==
The title of Baron Wodehouse, of Kimberley in the County of Norfolk, was created in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1797 for Sir John Wodehouse, 6th Baronet, of Wilberhall. He had previously represented Norfolk in Parliament. His son, the second Baron, sat as Member of Parliament for Great Bedwyn and Marlborough. He was succeeded by his grandson, the aforementioned third Baron (son of the Hon. Henry Wodehouse), who was created Earl of Kimberley in 1866.

The Wodehouse baronetcy, of Wilberhall in the County of Norfolk, was created in the Baronetage of England in 1611 for Philip Wodehouse, previously Member of Parliament for Castle Rising. His son, the second Baronet, was Member of Parliament for Thetford. He was succeeded by his son, the third Baronet, who represented Thetford as well as Norfolk in the House of Commons. His grandson, the fourth Baronet, was also Member of Parliament for these constituencies. His son, the fifth Baronet, represented Norfolk in Parliament. He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned sixth Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage in 1797.

Several other members of the Wodehouse family have also gained distinction. The author P. G. Wodehouse was the great-grandson of the Reverend Philip Wodehouse, second son of the fifth Baronet. The politician Edmond Wodehouse was the son of Thomas Wodehouse, third son of the fifth Baronet. His eldest son was the colonial administrator Sir Philip Wodehouse, Governor of Bombay from 1872 to 1877. Sir Philip Wodehouse&#x27;s son Edmond Wodehouse represented Bath in the House of Commons as a Unionist. The Hon. Armine Wodehouse, younger son of the first Earl, was a civil servant and Liberal politician.

The family seat is Hailstone House, near Cricklade, Wiltshire.

<text>The American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) is an American nonprofit organization of more than 200,000 motorcyclists that organizes numerous motorcycling activities and campaigns for motorcyclists&#x27; legal rights. Its mission statement is &quot;to promote the motorcycling lifestyle and protect the future of motorcycling.&quot; The organization was founded in 1924 and as of October 2016 had more than 1,100 chartered clubs.

For clubs and promoters it provides guidance and advice on running events and rallies, and allows affiliated members to vote on AMA matters. It also has a corporate membership category with representatives from the US motorcycle industry.

The AMA is the official national federation representative (FMN) for the United States of America in the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and organizes the US teams and riders for FIM-sanctioned events, including the International Six Day Enduro, Motocross Des Nations and Trials Des Nations.

==History==
The AMA was a whites-only organization from its inception in 1924 until the 1950s, not allowing African Americans to join for its first 30 years. A 1930 AMA membership application form, on display at the Harley-Davidson Museum, included the statement &quot;membership is limited to white persons only&quot;. This segregation occurred at a time in American history when many motorcycle dealerships refused to sell motorcycles to black riders, forcing an entire population to create their own culture. The museum exhibit has examples of distinctive uniforms worn by motorcycle clubs, both AMA sanctioned, and those from the separate culture of black or racially desegregated clubs that proliferated as a consequence of the AMA segregation policy, such as the Berkeley Tigers MC from the San Francisco Bay Area.

Prior to the acceptance of black members, the term outlaw motorcycle club could refer to either a white counterculture biker club that was &quot;uninterested in &#x27;square&#x27; events and competitions&quot;, or else a club that accepted non-white members and was therefore not allowed to participate in the AMA. In the 1920s and 1930s, black hillclimbing racer William B. Johnson evaded the whites-only restriction and obtained an AMA membership card, which allowed him to compete around the Northeastern United States and become perhaps the first black AMA member. 

After the racist policy was abolished, AMA-sanctioned motorcycle clubs thrived in the era after World War II when motorcycle sales soared and club membership appealed to &quot;better-adjusted&quot; American veterans who enjoyed group participation and operated under strict bylaws that held club meetings and riding events.

In 1995, AMA President Ed Youngblood said that as a consequence of this racist policy from 1924 to the 1950s, blacks continued to be underrepresented in AMA events for decades after the segregationist policy was rescinded. That year, Youngblood presented black AMA member Norman Gaines in their membership advertisement in the campaign &quot;I want to protect my rights as a motorcyclist. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m an AMA member&quot; in both the AMA member magazine and &quot;Motorcyclist&quot; magazine.

==Outlaw and one-percenter==
The term &quot;one-percenter&quot; was coined after the 1947 Hollister riot in Hollister, California. The AMA is said to have responded that 99% of motorcyclists were law-abiding citizens, implying the last one percent were outlaws. The AMA now says they have no record of such a statement to the press, and call this story apocryphal. One-percenter motorcycle clubs are often also known as outlaw motorcycle gangs or OMGs according to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

==Competitions==
The AMA sanctions over 2,000 events each year hosted by chartered clubs and promoters alike across the entire country in the disciplines of Motocross, Off-Road and Track Racing. Each discipline is guided by the AMA Racing Rule Book which is organized, written and voted on each year by AMA congress which is made up of AMA delegates from across the entire country representing their areas, disciplines and districts. In addition to a yearly congress the AMA also organizes the AMA National Awards Banquet that awards championships to all of the AMA Amateur National championship from across the country in addition to naming the AMA Racer of the Year, AMA Youth Racer of the Year, AMA Womens Racer of the Year, AMA Club of the Year and more. The AMA Board of Directors annually gives out non-competition awards for those that carry on the AMA mission. Those awards include the AMA Dud Perkins Lifetime Achievement Award, the AMA Bessie Stringfield Award, the AMA Hazel Kolb Brighter Image Award, and the Jim Viverito Friend of the AMA Award.

===AMA Pro Racing===
The AMA is the largest motorsports organization in the world, overseeing 80 professional and more than 4,000 amateur events each year. The AMA also maintains the Motorcycle Hall of Fame located near Columbus, Ohio. It is the designated governing body of motorcycle sport in the US by the world governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM).

AMA Pro Racing was formed in 1994 to respond to the growth of motorcycle racing in United States and holds many events. The AMA Road Racing Series includes the AMA American Superbike Championship, the AMA Daytona Sportbike Championship (which incorporates the former AMA Supersport Championship and the now inactive AMA Formula Xtreme), and the new AMA Supersport Championship, which is limited to riders of age 16-21 on near stock 600cc motorcycles.

Off-road racing series include AMA Grand National Championship, AMA Supercross, AMA Motocross Championship, AMA Hillclimb, AMA Supermoto Championship and AMA EnduroCross Championship.

On March 7, 2008, the AMA Pro Racing series was sold to the Daytona Motorsports Group (DMG), headed by Roger Edmondson and Jim France. The DMG became responsible for the AMA Superbike Series, AMA Motocross Series, AMA Flat Track Series, AMA Supermoto Series, AMA Hillclimb Series and ATV Pro Racing. The sale did not include the AMA Supercross and AMA Arenacross Series, whose rights are currently owned by Feld Entertainment. DMG would license the AMA name and trademarks to promote the motorcycle racing series. The new management sparked criticism among some of the press and fans for allegedly alienating the factory teams and for introducing NASCAR style rules such as rolling start and pace car. DMG was replaced by MotoAmerica as AMA Superbikes promoter in 2015.

==&quot;American Motorcyclist&quot;==
&quot;American Motorcyclist&quot; magazine is published by the AMA. It has a monthly circulation of 260,000 copies.

<doc id="468072" wikidata="Q816706" url="?curid=468072" title="Southern African Development Community">
<text>The Southern African Development Community (SADC) is an inter-governmental organization headquartered in Gaborone, Botswana.

== Goals ==
The SADC&#x27;s goal is to further regional socio-economic cooperation and integration as well as political and security cooperation among 16 countries in southern Africa. Although its primary objectives are development, economic growth, and poverty alleviation, peacekeeping has become increasingly important to the SADC.

== History ==

The origins of SADC are in the 1960s and 1970s, when the leaders of majority-ruled countries and national liberation movements coordinated their political, diplomatic and military struggles to bring an end to colonial and white-minority rule in southern Africa. The immediate forerunner of the political and security cooperation leg of today&#x27;s SADC was the informal Frontline States (FLS) grouping. It was formed in 1980.
The Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) was the forerunner of the socio-economic cooperation leg of today&#x27;s SADC. The adoption by nine majority-ruled southern African countries of the Lusaka declaration on 1 April 1980 paved the way for the formal establishment of SADCC in April 1980.

Membership of the FLS and SADCC sometimes differed.

SADCC was transformed into SADC on 17 August 1992, with the adoption by the founding members of SADCC and newly independent Namibia of the Windhoek declaration and treaty establishing SADC. The 1992 SADC provided for both socio-economic cooperation and political and security cooperation. In reality, the FLS was dissolved only in 1994, after South Africa&#x27;s first democratic elections. Subsequent efforts to place political and security cooperation on a firm institutional footing under SADC&#x27;s umbrella failed.

On 14 August 2001, the 1992 SADC treaty was amended. The amendment heralded the overhaul of the structures, policies and procedures of SADC, a process which is ongoing. One of the changes is that political and security cooperation is institutionalised in the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security (OPDS); one of the principal SADC bodies. It is subject to the oversight of the organisation&#x27;s supreme body, the Summit, which comprises the heads of state or government.

The organisation holds its own multi-sport event in the form of the SADC Games, which was first held in 2004 in Maputo. Originally planned for an earlier date in Malawi and Lesotho, organisational issues led to abandonment of the plan and the SADC issuing a fine of $100,000 against Malawi. The first event in 2004 in Maputo resulted in over 1000 youths under-20 from 10 countries taking part in a sports programme including athletics, football, netball, boxing and basketball.

In 2012, the SADC deployed peacekeepers to the Democratic Republic of Congo in order to counter a rebel threat. The deployed troops were supplied by Tanzania, Malawi, and South Africa.

In August 2019 SADC adopted Swahili as its fourth working language, alongside English, French and Portuguese. Kiswahili – a lingua franca in the African Great Lakes region, other parts of East Africa, and to a lesser degree, parts of Southern Africa – is an official language of Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda and of the African Union.

== Member states ==
As of 2022, the SADC has a total of 16 member states:
Burundi has requested to join.

== Protocols ==

SADC has 27 legally binding protocols dealing with issues such as Defence, Development, Illicit Drug Trade, Free Trade and Movement of People.

* Protocol on Energy (1996) – Intended to promote harmonious development of national energy policies. These development strategies set out tangible objectives for SADC and its Member States for infrastructure development in energy and its subsectors of woodfuel, petroleum and natural gas, electricity, coal, renewable energy, and energy efficiency and conservation.
* Protocol on Gender and Development – Member states are urged to accelerate implementation efforts towards the achievements of concrete and transformative changes in the lives of women and girls in the region. H.E. President Mutharika also expressed concern on the escalating incidents of gender based violence in the region, especially those perpetrated against women and girls, and used this occasion to sign a commitment to end child marriages, as part of the AU campaign to end Child Marriages in Africa.
* Protocol on Politics, Defence and Security Co-operation (2001) – Intended to foster regional security and defence cooperation, promote peace, political stability and conflict-management. The protocol initiated also an institutional reform of the SADC&#x27;s Organ for Politics, Defence and Security (OPDS).

== SADC FTA ==

The SADC Free Trade Area was established in August 2008, after the implementation of the SADC Protocol on Trade in 2000 laid the foundation for its formation. Its original members were Botswana, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, with Malawi and Seychelles joining later. Of the 15 SADC member states, only Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo are not yet participating, however Angolan trade minister Joffre Van-Dúnen Júnior said in Luanda that his ministry is working to create conditions for Angola&#x27;s accession to the SADC Free Trade Area in 2019. The SADC-Customs Union, scheduled to be established by 2010 according to SADC&#x27;s Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP), is unlikely to become reality in the near future. This is because the European Union&#x27;s Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) with their inherent extra-regional freetrade regimes provided for several SADC members more benefits than deeper regional market integration within the framework of a SADC-Customs Union. Since these SADC countries formed four different groupings to negotiate and implement different Economic Partnership Agreements with the European Union, the chance to establish a SADC-wide common external tariff as prerequisite for a regional customs union is missed.

On Wednesday 22 October 2008, SADC joined with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa and the East African Community to form the African Free Trade Zone, including all members of each of the organizations. The leaders of the three trading blocs agreed to create a single free trade zone, the African Free Trade Zone, consisting of 26 countries with a GDP of an estimated $624bn (£382.9bn). It is hoped the African Free Trade Zone agreement would ease access to markets within the zone and end problems arising from the fact that several of the member countries belong to multiple groups.

The African Free Trade Zone effective has been more than a hundred years in the making—a trade zone spanning the whole African continent from Cape to Cairo and envisioned by Cecil Rhodes and other British imperialists in the 1890s. The only difference is that the African Free Trade Zone is the creation of independent African Countries. The idea is a free trade zone spanning the whole continent from the Cape to Cairo (Cape Town in the Republic of South Africa to Cairo in Egypt).

In addition to eliminating duplicative membership and the problem member states also participating in other regional economic cooperation schemes and regional political and security cooperation schemes that may compete with or undermine each other, the African Free Trade Zone further aims to strengthen the bloc&#x27;s bargaining power when negotiating international deals.

Pursuant to the SADC goal of more integration, Botswana and Namibia signed an agreement in February 2023 allowing citizens to travel between the two countries using only identity cards, with passports no longer being needed. Botswana has held talks with Zimbabwe to achieve a similar deal, and expects to open talks with Zambia.

== Challenges facing member countries ==

SADC countries face many social, development, economic, trade, education, health, diplomatic, defence, security and political challenges. Some of these challenges cannot be tackled effectively by individual members. Cattle diseases and organised-crime gangs know no boundaries. War in one country can suck in its neighbours and damage their economies. The sustainable development that trade could bring is threatened by the existence of different product standards and tariff regimes, weak customs infrastructure and bad roads. The socio-economic and political and security cooperation aims of SADC are equally wide-ranging, and intended to address the various common challenges.

One significant challenge is that member states also participate in other regional economic cooperation schemes and regional political and security cooperation schemes that may compete with or undermine SADC&#x27;s aims. For example, South Africa and Botswana both belong to the Southern Africa Customs Union, Zambia is a part of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, and Tanzania is a member of the East African Community.

According to Human Rights Watch, &quot;SADC has been criticized for its laxity on making human rights compliance within its member states a priority&quot;.

== Structure and decision-making procedures ==
The organization has six principal bodies:

* The Summit, comprising heads of state or heads of government
* Organ on Politics, Defense and Security
* Council of Ministers
* SADC Tribunal
* SADC National Committees (SNCs)

Except for the Tribunal (based in Windhoek, Namibia), SNCs and Secretariat, decision-making is by consensus.

<text>Earl Kitchener, of Khartoum and of Broome in the County of Kent, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1914 for the famous officer Field Marshal Herbert Kitchener, 1st Viscount Kitchener of Khartoum. He had already been created Baron Kitchener of Khartoum, and of Aspall in the County of Suffolk, in 1898, Viscount Kitchener of Khartoum, and of the Vaal River in the Transvaal Colony, and of Aspall in the County of Suffolk, in 1902, and was made Baron Denton, of Denton in the County of Kent, and Viscount Broome, of Broome in the County of Kent, at the same time he was granted the earldom. These titles were also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The barony of 1898 was created with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. However, all the other titles (those of 1902 and 1914) were created with remainder to
#the heirs male of his body, failing which to
#his first daughter and the heirs male of her body, failing which to
#his other daughters and the heirs male of their bodies, failing which to
#his elder brother Colonel Henry Kitchener and the heirs male of his body, failing which to
#his youngest brother Lieutenant-General Sir Walter Kitchener (who was alive at the time of the 1902 creation but deceased at the time of the 1914 creations) and the heirs male of his body.

A third brother, Arthur Kitchener (also alive at the time of the 1902 creation but deceased at the time of the 1914 creations), was not included in either special remainder.

The first earl died unmarried and childless in 1916, which resulted in the extinction of the barony created in 1898. However, he was succeeded in the other titles under the special remainder by his elder brother, Colonel Henry Kitchener, as second earl. His only son, Henry, Viscount Broome, predeceased him, and so he was succeeded by his grandson, also Henry, Viscount Broome, as third earl. The third earl died unmarried and childless in 2011. His younger brother, the Hon. Charles Kitchener, had died in 1982, and the line of Lieutenant-General Sir Walter Kitchener had failed on the death of his younger son, Squadron Leader Henry Kitchener, in 1984. The titles therefore became extinct.

The Hon. Charles Kitchener, brother of the third earl, had one daughter, Emma Kitchener (born 1963), who on the third earl&#x27;s death became the first earl&#x27;s heir general. She is a lady-in-waiting to Princess Michael of Kent and is married to the actor, screenwriter, film director and novelist Lord Fellowes. Fellowes publicly expressed his dissatisfaction that the proposals to change the rules of royal succession were not extended to peerages, which would have allowed his wife to succeed as 4th Countess on her uncle&#x27;s death. On 9 May 2012 the Queen issued a Royal Warrant of Precedence allowing Lady Fellowes to enjoy the same rank and title of the daughter of an earl, as if her late father had survived his brother and therefore succeeded to the title.

The family seat was Westergate Wood, near Arundel, Sussex.

<doc id="468080" wikidata="Q1156406" url="?curid=468080" title="Ōzu, Kumamoto">
<text>is a town located in Kikuchi District, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 36,053 in 16240 households, and a population density of 520 persons per km2. The total area of the town is .

==Geography==
Ōzu is located about 19 kilometers east-northeast from the center of Kumamoto City, the prefectural capital, at the eastern edge of the Kumamoto Plain and the Kumamoto metropolitan area. The town lies at the base of Mt Aso, to the west of the mountain. The Shirakawa River flows west through the southern part of the town. The urban center of Ōzu is located in the western part of the town&#x27;s geographic area.

Ōzu was near the epicenter of the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes.

=== Neighboring municipalities ===

* Aso
* Kikuchi
* Kikuyō
* Kōshi
* Mashiki
* Minamiaso
* Nishihara

===Climate===
Ōzu has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Ōzu is 14.0 °C. The average annual rainfall is 2000 mm with September being the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 24.9 °C, and lowest in January, at around 3.1 °C.

===Demographics===
According to Japanese census data, the historical population of Ōzu is as shown below

==History==
The area of Ōzu was part of the ancient Higo Province. During the Edo Period it was part of the holdings of the Kumamoto Domain. After the Meiji restoration, the town of Ōzu was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889.

==Government==
Ōzu has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 16 members. Ōzu, collectively with the other municipalities of Kikuchi District contributes two members to the Kumamoto Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of the Kumamoto 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
Ōzu has an economy dominated by agriculture and manufacturing. Notably, there is a large Honda motorcycle factory located in Ōzu that employs people from around the world. There are many cattle farms in the area, and local farmers both raise cattle, and grow crops to provide feed for them. Ōzu is also known for its sweet potatoes (&quot;karaimo&quot;).

In 2024, after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) chose neighbouring Kikuyō as the location to build its second Japanese plant, Ōzu experienced the sharpest increase in commercial and industrial land prices of any area of Japan for the period ending July 1. This demand for land has caused problems for local farmers who rent farmland, since land owners have been asked to end their rental agreements early, giving up the land. In addition, local farmers are feeling a tension between possible short-term financial returns, and a wish to pass their farms on to their heirs as working farms.

==Education==
Ōzu has seven public elementary schools and two public junior high schools operated by the town government, and two public high schools operated by the Kumamoto Prefectural Board of Education. The prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped.

Ōzu has one of the oldest homes in Kikuchi District that opens twice a year for tourists, and a racing track. Ōzu’s location on the edge of the caldera that surrounds Mount Aso provides scenic views, and access to the mountain.

<doc id="468087" wikidata="Q1877200" url="?curid=468087" title="Jolly Cola">
<text>Jolly Cola is an original Danish soft drink dating back to 1959. Jolly is owned by the 
limited company &#x27;Dansk Coladrik A/S&#x27; (Danish Coladrink Ltd). Jolly Cola is now produced by Brewery Vestfyen, which also produces Jolly Light, Jolly Time (a sports drink), and Jolly Orange. 

Dansk Coladrik was founded in 1959 to compete with the American brands before they hit the Danish markets, especially Coca-Cola. Many products from the United States were copied in this way shortly before they were introduced in Denmark, so people already had a connection with the Danish brand. Dansk Coladrink is an independent company owned by the stock holders; however, Brewery Vestfyen owns a majority of stock in the company. Up until the 1980s, Jolly Cola had a market share of about 40% of the Danish cola market. This was extraordinary, as Denmark is one of a few countries in the world, where another cola than the original Coca-Cola has had a larger market share. 

Jolly Cola&#x27;s longtime slogan &quot;Say Jolly to your cola!&quot; was changed to &quot;Free your taste&quot; on its 50th birthday in 2009. The bottles and cans today has the slogan “EN ÆGTE DANSK ORIGINAL – SIDEN 1959” meaning &quot;A REAL DANISH ORIGINAL - SINCE 1959&quot;

==History==
Following World War II, many countries in the world viewed Coca-Cola as synonymous with the US and an American life-style, and as the US developed and increased its influence on society, so did Coca-Cola. In the meantime, the Danish population still had to wait until 1959, before they could buy a bottle of Coca-Cola.

Coca-Cola had been marketed with moderate success from the middle of the 1930s, but then came a war, followed by rationing of sugar and finally a special tax on cola, which made the soft drink just as expensive as a beer, and therefore kept it out of the Danish market. The taxation came as a result of skilled lobbyism, carried out by breweries and producers of mineral water – and it worked as intended.

Following the implementation of the tax in 1953, only 10,000 litres of cola soft drinks were sold in Denmark a year, primarily produced by minor Danish producers of mineral water, avoiding the competition from the American giant. However, the opposition against the taxation grew, and by the end of the 1950s it was only the communists and conservative powers in Danish politics, which had close connections to the brewing industry, that wanted a prohibitive surtax on what a member of the Danish Communist Party called “a bitter cup”.
When the Danish producers finally realised that they could not keep Coca-Cola out of the Danish market anymore, they quickly changed their strategy. In January 1959 18 breweries and producers of mineral water went together to form ‘Dansk Coladrik A/S’. This initiative was instigated by Carlsberg and Tuborg so as to produce an original Danish cola that was to be sold nationwide. The soft drink was named Jolly Cola and was an all-out copy product. This regarded not only the taste, but also the organisation behind the product, which completely resembled Coca-Cola, especially in terms of having a strong and centralised control of quality and marketing, combined with local bottling departments. Suddenly, the strategy seemed to be that if you could not get rid of Coca-Cola, the least you could do was to ensure that the Danish population drank Danish produced cola. To a great extent, this was a success, and when the taxation was removed and ‘the great Danish cola war’ broke out in July 1959, Jolly Cola actually conquered a significant part of the new market.

In July 1959 alone, nine million bottles of Jolly Cola were sold, compared to five million bottles of Coca-Cola. This was an incredible number compared to an annual sale of 40 to 50,000 bottles in 1958. Naturally, the sheer interest of the news explains a part of the increased sale, but so does the summer of 1959, which was exceptionally good. Nevertheless, when the market finally stabilised, roughly every fifth sold soft drink in Denmark was a cola, and approximately 40% was Jolly Cola.

Jolly Cola maintained this market share until the 1980s.

There are several explanations for Jolly Cola’s success. However, the most important one is that ‘Dansk Coladrik’ could make use of the brewing industry’s comprehensive network, distributing system and knowledge of the Danish market. Another reason is that it was only possible to buy Coca-Cola in Copenhagen and a few larger cities in Jutland in the early years of the hectic ‘cola war’. Hence, it was not until the 1960s that it was possible to buy Coca-Cola nationwide. This ensured that Jolly Cola was a well-established product in many places when Coca-Cola finally ventured into the market. Thirdly, it was due to great marketing. Dansk Coladrik had tapped their cola in regular soft drink bottles. This made it easier for the retail industry to administer the returnable bottle system, but it also made it possible to launch Jolly Cola as “The Big Cola” (a slogan that not coincidentally resembled Pepsi’s successful 1930s US slogan for its big 12 ounce bottle). A Danish soft drink bottle contained exactly 25 cl, whereas the characteristic ‘chubby’ Coca-Cola bottle only contained 19 cl. The argument about value for your money was important in a time where a soft drink was considered to be a luxury product. (The story of Jolly Cola is based on the work of Klaus Petersen and Niels Arne Sørensen from the Institute of History, Culture and Society).

==Today’s Jolly Cola==
In the 1980s Jolly Cola still had around 60% of the Danish cola market, but in the 1990s they experienced a decrease in sales. In 1999 the failing sales numbers forced the Danish Consumers Cooperative Society (Coop amba) to remove Jolly Cola from its shelves. Following this, Jolly Cola only made up 6% of the total Danish soft drink market in 2002, which was again reduced to 2% in 2003. In the same year, a trial between the brewery Vestfyen and the association of Danish breweries almost compromised Jolly Cola’s existence. Vestfyen believed that the association of Danish breweries would rather market Pepsi Cola at the expense of Jolly Cola. In September 2003, however, Vestfyen took over all stocks dealing with the struggling soft drink so as to engage in a turn-around of the product. This became an immense success, and in 2004 Jolly Cola made up 25% of Coop amba&#x27;s cola sales.

==Labels==
Jolly’s labels have changed a couple of times during the years. However, what they have in common is a retro design. It is the same look/design which is reappearing in the new logo. In the 1980s and 1990s there were quizzes, crossword puzzles and common proverbs on the back of Jolly’s labels.

<doc id="468089" wikidata="Q4922714" url="?curid=468089" title="Blackburn South, Victoria">
<text>Blackburn South is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 16 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Whitehorse local government area. Blackburn South recorded a population of 10,939 at the 2021 census.

Blackburn South is bordered by Canterbury Road, Middleborough Road, Eley Road, and by an irregular line to the east of Blackburn Road. 

==History==

Prior to development in the 1950s, Blackburn was primarily covered by orchards. Orchard Grove, an important access road through the suburb, was named so for this reason. Some original farm houses still stand in the area. During the 1960s and 1970s Blackburn South was a working-class neighbourhood before becoming a more middle-class neighbourhood in the early 1980s. South Blackburn Post Office on Canterbury Road opened around February 1954 and was renamed Blackburn South around 1957. Kinkuna Post Office on Vicki Street near Blackburn Road opened on 8 October 1960 and closed in 1979.

The Blackburn South Sharps were the most prominent of the 1972-1977 Melbourne sharpie gangs. Sharpies were an early precursor to the Australian phenomenon of bogans. The Blackburn South Sharps have been the subject of several modern exhibitions and documentaries due to the numerous photographs they took around Blackburn South landmarks.

==Transport==

The major east–west thoroughfare through Blackburn South is Canterbury Road. From the south, it is also accessible from Burwood Highway. Major north–south roads through the suburb include Middleborough Road and Blackburn Road; both connect to the Eastern Freeway.

Blackburn south has also Laburnum Train station and not far from Blackburn and Box Hill Station.

Melbourne PTV bus routes service the area.

==Recreation==

Blackburn South, and its surrounding areas features several excellent parks. These include Wurundjeri Walk Trail, which provides an excellent creek-side walk. There are cricket ovals at Mirrabooka Oval and Eley Park, the latter also featuring a tennis club. Other smaller parks are also tucked away in the suburb, including Edinburgh Patch and one at Wardle Close, a green corridor between McCracken Avenue and Shawlands Avenue and the Fulton Road – Finch Place link.

==Education==

Blackburn South is home to Laburnum Primary School, Orchard Grove Primary School, St. Luke the Evangelist School, Indra Pre-School, Holbury Children&#x27;s Centre, True Maple Bilingual Early Learning Centre, Aurora School and Blackburn English Language School.

Its high school, Blackburn South High, was amalgamated into Forest Hill Secondary College as the Blackburn South campus in the early 1990s, but has since been closed and demolished. The Aurora School now sits on the site of the old high school.

Blackburn South was also home to several small primary schools, four of which were amalgamated into Orchard Grove Primary School in 1991. These were Blackburn South (demolished to build housing), Killoura (now the Blackburn English Language School), Mirrabooka (the site that Orchard Grove Primary now sits) and Warrawong (demolished to build housing, although the art room still stands and is now the Eley Park Community Association Warrawong Annex). Blackburn East Primary School, which was not part of the initial amalgamation, closed in 1993.

==Retail==

Blackburn South itself features shops along Canterbury Road, including a Woolworths Supermarket and a McDonald&#x27;s Restaurant. There are also smaller shops, known as milk bars at the corner of Fulton and Holland Road, Indra Road, Vicki Street and Eley Road. It does feature proximity to Blackburn, Box Hill and Forest Hill; easily accessible by either car or bus.

<doc id="468102" wikidata="Q1185865" url="?curid=468102" title="Democratic National Convention">
<text>The Democratic National Convention (DNC) is a series of presidential nominating conventions held every four years since 1832 by the United States Democratic Party. They have been administered by the Democratic National Committee since the 1852 national convention. The primary goal of the Democratic National Convention is to officially nominate a candidate for president and vice president, adopt a comprehensive party platform, and unify the party. Pledged delegates from all fifty U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and the American territories, and superdelegates which are unpledged delegates representing the Democratic establishment, attend the convention and cast their votes to choose the party&#x27;s presidential candidate. Like the Republican National Convention, the Democratic National Convention marks the formal end of the primary election period and the start of the general election season. Since the 1980s, national conventions have become mostly inaugural events for the winning candidate, since winners are announced long before the convention. In 2020, both major parties, and many minor parties, replaced their usual in-person conventions with virtual programs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Delegations==
The party&#x27;s presidential nominee is chosen primarily by pledged delegates, which are in turn selected through a series of individual state caucuses and primary elections. Pledged delegates are classified into three categories:
* At-large pledged delegates are allocated and elected at the statewide level.
* District pledged delegates are allocated and elected at a district level, usually the congressional district, but sometimes by state or territory legislative district.
* Add-on or PLEO pledged delegates, which allow for representation by party leaders and elected officials within the state.

Unpledged superdelegates, delegates whose votes are not bound to the outcome of a state&#x27;s caucus or primary, only vote in the event of a contested nomination. These superdelegates may also be called unpledged PLEO (party leaders and elected officials) delegates.

The size of delegations to the Democratic National Convention, for each state, territory, or other political subdivision, are described in the party&#x27;s quadrennial &quot;Call for the Democratic National Convention&quot;.

===Pledged delegate allocation===
====Allocation formula for the 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C.====
Since 2012, the number of pledged delegates allocated to each of the 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. is based on two main factors: (1) the proportion of votes each state gave to the Democratic candidate in the last three presidential elections, and (2) the number of electoral votes each state has in the Electoral College.

The calculations for the 2020 convention basically consist of the following three steps:

Step 1: The following formula is first used to determine each jurisdiction&#x27;s &quot;allocation factor&quot;:

formula_1

where
: SDV = The state&#x27;s Democratic vote in the indicated presidential election
: TDV = The nationwide total Democratic vote in the indicated presidential election
: SEV = The state&#x27;s electoral votes

Step 2: The &quot;base delegation&quot; for each state and the District of Columbia is then determined by multiplying its &quot;allocation factor&quot; by 3,200 (rounded to the nearest integer):

formula_2

Step 3: Finally, the jurisdiction&#x27;s &quot;base delegation&quot; is used to calculate the number of its District, At-Large, and pledged PLEO (&quot;party leaders and elected officials&quot; who are not superdelegates) delegates (fractions 0.5 and above are rounded to the next highest integer):

formula_3

formula_4

formula_5

====Allocations to other jurisdictions====
Jurisdictions without electoral votes are instead given a fixed amount of pledged delegates. In 2020, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands each get six at-large delegates. Democrats Abroad gets 12 at-large and one pledged PLEO.

Puerto Rico is assigned 44 base votes in 2020, then the same formulas used in Step 3 above for U.S. states are used to calculate the territory&#x27;s at-large, district, and PLEO pledged delegates:

formula_6

formula_7

formula_8

====Bonus delegates====
The Democratic Party awards bonus pledged delegates to each jurisdiction based on two factors: timing and clustering. The timing criterion is based on when the state holds its primaries or caucuses with those states scheduling their contests in May and June getting the higher bonus. For clustering, three or more neighboring states must concurrently begin on the same date.

The bonus awarded is then a percentage increase in the jurisdiction&#x27;s delegation (rounded to the nearest integer). A fourth of the bonus delegates are then designated as District, and the other three-fourths become At-Large.

The bonuses are:
* Timing Stage 1 (before April): &quot;No bonus&quot;
* Timing Stage 2 (April): 10 percent increase
* Cluster: 15 percent increase
* Both Timing Stage 2 and Cluster: 25 percent increase
* Timing Stage 3 (May and June): 30 percent increase
* Both Timing Stage 3 and Cluster: 35 percent increase

====Awarding delegates to the candidates====
Based on the results of each of the primaries and caucuses, pledged delegates are awarded to the candidates under proportional representation, where candidates who get 15 percent or more of the popular vote in a state or one of its districts divide the respective delegates proportionally to the votes on the respective level (those who get under 15 percent of the votes in a state and all of its districts do not get any delegates). Statewide and district delegates are strictly separate, they are both proportionally allocated based on the popular vote in the state or the respective districts. The statewide delegates are furthermore separated into two groups, at-large delegates and pledged PLEO delegates, which are both allocated proportionally based on the statewide vote but calculated separately. This amounts to in fact three different delegate groups, allocated proportionally but separately, leading to contortion and slightly unproportional results.

===Superdelegates===
A &quot;superdelegate&quot; is an unpledged delegate to the Democratic National Convention who is seated automatically and chooses for themselves for whom they vote. These superdelegates include elected officials, and party activists and officials. They make up slightly under 15 percent of all convention delegates.

Superdelegates fall into four categories:
* Elected members of the Democratic National Committee
* Democratic Governors, including territorial governors and the Mayor of the District of Columbia
* Democratic Members of Congress, District of Columbia shadow senators and non-voting House members.
* Distinguished party leaders (consisting of current and former Presidents, Vice Presidents, congressional leaders, and DNC chairs)

Democratic superdelegates are free to support any candidate for the presidential nomination. On August 25, 2018, the Democratic National Committee agreed to reduce the influence of superdelegates by generally preventing them from voting on the first ballot at the Democratic National Convention, allowing their votes only in a contested nomination.

In the 2024 presidential election cycle, the Democratic National Committee held a virtual nomination vote in the first week of August to select its nominee. The virtual nomination rules allowed superdelegates to vote for a presidential candidate during the first ballot of the virtual roll call.

==Presidential candidate nomination==

From 1832 to 1936, any nomination for president or vice-president was required to have a majority of two-thirds of the total number of delegates. Unless there was a popular incumbent, something that only happened three times between the Civil War and World War II, getting that many votes on the first ballot were virtually impossible.

This resulted in often contentious debate that riled the passions of party leaders, with delegates being forced to vote for a nominee until someone could receive the minimum number of delegates required. This situation occurred at the conventions of 1852, 1856, 1868, 1912, 1920 and most notoriously, 1924, where the voting went for at least a dozen ballots.

In 1860, the convention deadlocked after 57 ballots, during which 50 Southern delegates walked out; subsequently, second and third conventions nominated separate Northern and Southern tickets.

Backroom deals by party bosses were normal and often resulted in compromise nominees that became known as dark horse candidates, people who never imagined they would run for president until the last moments of the convention. Dark horse candidates were chosen in order to break deadlocks between more popular and powerful prospective nominees that blocked each other from gaining enough delegates to be nominated.

One of the most famous dark horse candidates nominated at a Democratic National Convention was James K. Polk, who was chosen to become the candidate for president only after being added to the eighth and ninth delegate ballot.

The rules were changed to a simple majority in 1936. Since then, only one multi-ballot convention (in the 1952) has taken place.

==Vice-presidential candidate nomination==

Before 1980, the party&#x27;s choice of the vice-presidential nominee was usually not known until the last evening of the convention. This was because the presidential nominee had little to do with the process, and in many cases was not known at the start of the convention.

In 1944 and 1956, the nominee let the convention choose the running mate without any recommendation, which led to two ballots of voting being required in each case.

However, since 1984 (Mondale was the incumbent VP in 1980), vice-presidential nominees have always been announced by the presumptive nominee prior to the convention.

==History==

By 1824, the congressional nominating caucus had fallen into disrepute and collapsed as a method of nominating presidential and vice-presidential candidates. A national convention idea had been brought up, but nothing occurred until the next decade: state conventions and state legislatures emerged as the nomination apparatus until they were supplanted by the national convention method of nominating candidates. President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Kitchen Cabinet&quot; privately carried out the plan for the first Democratic National Convention: the public call for the first national convention emanated from Jackson&#x27;s supporters in New Hampshire in 1831.

The first national convention of the Democratic Party began in Baltimore on May 21, 1832, only to nominate a vice-presidential candidate as it was clear that Jackson as the party&#x27;s natural leader would run for the presidency again. In that year the rule requiring a two-thirds vote to nominate a candidate was created, and Martin Van Buren was nominated for vice president on the first ballot. Although this rule was waived in the 1836 and 1840 conventions – when Van Buren was nominated as presidential candidate by acclamation – in 1844, it was revived by opponents of former President Van Buren, who had the support of a majority (but not two-thirds) of the delegates, in order to prevent him from receiving the nomination after his 1840 defeat. The rule then remained in place until 1936, when the renomination of President Franklin D. Roosevelt by acclamation allowed it finally to be put to rest.

On seven occasions, this rule led to Conventions which dragged on for over a dozen ballots. The most infamous examples of this were in 1860 at Charleston, when the convention deadlocked after 57 ballots: the delegates adjourned, and reconvened in separate Northern and Southern groups six weeks later, and in 1924, where &quot;Wets&quot; and &quot;Drys&quot; deadlocked between the frontrunners, Alfred E. Smith and William G. McAdoo, for 102 ballots over 16 days before finally agreeing on John W. Davis as a compromise candidate on the 103rd ballot. Also, in 1912, Champ Clark received a majority of the votes, but did not subsequently go on to achieve a two-thirds vote and the nomination (Woodrow Wilson won the nomination on the 46th ballot), the only time this happened.

Since 1932, only one convention (in 1952) has required multiple ballots. While the rule was in force, it virtually assured that no candidate without support from the South could be nominated. The elimination of the two-thirds rule made it possible for liberal Northern Democrats to gain greater influence in party affairs, leading to the disenfranchisement of Southern Democrats, and defection of many of the latter to the Republican Party, especially during the Civil Rights struggles of the 1960s.

William Jennings Bryan delivered his &quot;Cross of Gold&quot; speech at the 1896 convention, while the most historically notable and tumultuous convention in recent memory was the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois, which was fraught with highly emotional battles between conventioneers and Vietnam War protesters and an outburst by Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley. Other confrontations between various groups, such as the Yippies and members of the Students for a Democratic Society, and the Chicago police in city parks, streets and hotels marred this convention.

Following the 1968 convention, in which many reformers had been disappointed that Vice President Hubert Humphrey, despite not having competed in a single primary, easily won the nomination over Senators Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern (who was announced after the assassination of another candidate, Senator Robert F. Kennedy), a commission headed by Senator McGovern reformed the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominating process to increase the power of primaries in choosing delegates in order to increase the democracy of the process. Not entirely coincidentally, McGovern himself won the nomination in 1972. The 1972 convention was significant in that the new rules put into place as a result of the McGovern commission also opened the door for quotas mandating that certain percentages of delegates be women or members of minority groups, and subjects that were previously deemed not fit for political debate, such as abortion and lesbian and gay rights, now occupied the forefront of political discussion.

The nature of Democratic (and Republican) conventions has changed considerably since the 1972 McGovern reforms (which have largely influenced the Republican primaries as well). Every four years, the nominees are essentially selected earlier and earlier in the year, so the conventions now officially ratify the nominees instead of choose them (even the close race of 2008, which was not decided until early June, did not change the modern function of the convention, as superdelegates and Hillary Clinton&#x27;s withdrawal ensured Barack Obama&#x27;s win before the convention).

The 1980 convention was the last convention for the Democrats that was seriously contested (when Ted Kennedy forced a failed vote to free delegates from their commitment to vote for Jimmy Carter). The 1976 convention was the last where the vice-presidential nominee was announced during the convention, after the presidential nominee was chosen (Carter chose Walter Mondale). The 1996 convention that nominated Bill Clinton was accompanied by protests resulting in the arrest of 11 people including Civil Rights Movement historian Randy Kryn.

Prior to the 2020 convention in Milwaukee (which due to COVID-19 was moved from the larger Fiserv Forum to the smaller Wisconsin Center), the 1984 convention at the Moscone Center in San Francisco was the last Democratic Convention to be held in a convention center complex; all the intervening years saw their conventions held in sports arenas.

<doc id="468115" wikidata="Q195839" url="?curid=468115" title="Mardi Gras in New Orleans">
<text>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in southern Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Mardi Gras is French for Fat Tuesday, the season is known as Carnival and begins on 12th Night, January 6th, and extends until midnight before Ash Wednesday. Club, or Krewe, balls start soon after, though most are extremely private, with their Kings and Queens coming from wealthy old families and their courts consisting of the season&#x27;s debutantes. Most of the high society Krewes do not stage parades. As Fat Tuesday gets nearer, the parades start in earnest. Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).

The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern &quot;super krewes&quot; are well known for holding large parades and events (often featuring celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social Aid &amp; Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss &quot;throws&quot; into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic &quot;throw cups&quot;, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the Spanish Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and &#x27;tit Rex - also take place downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and Spanish Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras Day. Mardi Gras Day traditionally concludes with the &quot;Meeting of the Courts&quot; between Rex and Comus.

==History==

===Early history===
The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River in what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing). An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned.

In 1833, Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration. James R. Creecy in his book &quot;Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous Pieces&quot; describes New Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835:
Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun, frolic, and comic masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and boys, women and girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and appear in grotesque, quizzical, diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and birds, beasts and birds with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes&#x27; heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the moon; mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts, coaches, cars, &amp;c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming, fiddling, fifeing, and all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.

In 1856, 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to observe Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans&#x27; first and oldest krewe, the Mistick Krewe of Comus. According to one historian, &quot;Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what New Orleans had always considered a French festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the holiday had passed from French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans &#x27;Americanized&#x27; New Orleans and its Creoles. To a certain extent, New Orleans &#x27;creolized&#x27; the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of how their business prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized Carnival passed from Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the course of the nineteenth century. The spectacle of Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms and on the streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely American.&quot;

In 1875, Louisiana declared &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; a legal state holiday. War, economic, political, and weather conditions sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American Civil War, World War I and World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.

The 1898, Rex parade, with the theme of &quot;Harvest Queens&quot;, was filmed by the American Mutoscope Co. The rumored but long-lost recording was rediscovered in 2022. The two-minute film records 6 parade floats, including one transporting a live ox. In December 2022, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.

===20th and 21st centuries===
In 1979, the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or moved to surrounding communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual came to the city. Masking, costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops maintaining order. Guardsmen prevented crimes against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating morality or drug use; for these reasons, some in the French Quarter bohemian community recall 1979 as the city&#x27;s best Mardi Gras ever.

In 1991, the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations, including Mardi Gras Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, to obtain parade permits and other public licenses. Shortly after the law was passed, the city demanded that these krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing traditions of secrecy and the distinctly private nature of these groups. In protest—and because the city claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction to demand otherwise-private membership lists—the 19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading. Proteus did parade in the 1992 Carnival season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in 2000.

Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two federal courts later declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights of free association, and an unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the ordinance. The US Supreme Court refused to hear the city&#x27;s appeal from this decision.

Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays dues, and any member can have a place on a parade float.

====Effects of Hurricane Katrina====
The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, caused a few people to question the future of the city&#x27;s Mardi Gras celebrations. Mayor Nagin, who was up for reelection in early 2006, tried to play this sentiment for electoral advantage. However, the economics of Carnival were, and are, too important to the city&#x27;s revival.

The city government, essentially bankrupt after Hurricane Katrina, pushed for a scaled back celebration to limit strains on city services. However, many krewes insisted that they wanted to and would be ready to parade, so negotiations between krewe leaders and city officials resulted in a compromise schedule. It was scaled back but less severely than originally suggested.
The 2006 New Orleans Carnival schedule included the Krewe du Vieux on its traditional route through Marigny and the French Quarter on February 11, the Saturday two weekends before Mardi Gras. There were several parades on Saturday, February 18, and Sunday the 19th a week before Mardi Gras. Parades followed daily from Thursday night through Mardi Gras. Other than Krewe du Vieux and two Westbank parades going through Algiers, all New Orleans parades were restricted to the Saint Charles Avenue Uptown to Canal Street route, a section of the city which escaped significant flooding. Some krewes unsuccessfully pushed to parade on their traditional Mid-City route, despite the severe flood damage suffered by that neighborhood.

The city restricted how long parades could be on the street and how late at night they could end. National Guard troops assisted with crowd control for the first time since 1979. Louisiana State troopers also assisted, as they have many times in the past. Many floats had been partially submerged in floodwaters for weeks. While some krewes repaired and removed all traces of these effects, others incorporated flood lines and other damage into the designs of the floats.

Most of the locals who worked on the floats and rode on them were significantly affected by the storm&#x27;s aftermath. Many had lost most or all of their possessions, but enthusiasm for Carnival was even more intense as an affirmation of life. The themes of many costumes and floats had more barbed satire than usual, with commentary on the trials and tribulations of living in the devastated city. References included MREs, Katrina refrigerators and FEMA trailers, along with much mocking of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and local and national politicians.

By the 2009 season, the Endymion parade had returned to the Mid-City route, and other Krewes expanding their parades Uptown.

====2020 tandem float incidents====
In 2020, two parade attendees—one during the Nyx parade, and one during the Endymion parade, were killed after being struck and run over in between interconnected &quot;tandem floats&quot; towed by a single vehicle. Following the incident during the Nyx parade, there were calls for New Orleans officials to address safety issues with these floats (including outright bans, or requiring the gaps to be filled in using a barrier). Following the second death during the Endymion parade on February 22, 2020 (which caused the parade to be halted and cancelled), city officials announced that tandem floats would be banned effective immediately, with vehicles restricted to one, single float only.

====Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic====
Unknown to the participants and local leaders at the time, the 2020 Carnival season (with parades running from January through Mardi Gras Day on February 25) coincided with increasing spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States as part of what was then classified as a global epidemic. At the time, scrutiny over large public gatherings had yet to emerge, while scrutiny over international travel primarily placed an emphasis on restricting travel from China—the country from which the disease originated. The first case of COVID-19 in Louisiana was reported on March 9, two weeks after the end of Mardi Gras.

Subsequently, the state of Louisiana saw a significant impact from the pandemic, with New Orleans in particular seeing a high rate of cases. Louisiana State University (LSU) associate professor Susanne Straif-Bourgeoi suggested that the rapid spread may have been aided by Mardi Gras festivities. Researchers of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette determined that Louisiana had the fastest growth rate of cases (67.8%, overtaking New York&#x27;s 66.1% growth) in the 14 days since its first reported case than any region in the entire world.

Mayor LaToya Cantrell stated that she would have cancelled Mardi Gras festivities had she been provided with sufficient warning by the federal government, and criticized the Trump administration for downplaying the threat. Amid continued spread of COVID-19 across the country, in early-November 2020 Cantrell stated that celebrations in 2021 would have to be &quot;something different&quot;, as Mardi Gras could not be canceled outright since it is a religious observance. A sub-committee of the Mardi Gras Advisory Committee focused on COVID-19 proposed that parades still be held but with strict safety protocols and recommendations, including enforcement of social distancing, highly recommending the wearing of face masks by attendees, discouraging &quot;high value&quot; throws in order to discourage crowding, as well as discouraging the consumption of alcohol, and encouraging more media coverage of parades to allow at-home viewing.
On November 17, 2020, Mayor Cantrell&#x27;s communications director Beau Tidwell announced that the city would prohibit parades during Carnival season in 2021. Tidwell once again stressed that Mardi Gras was not &quot;cancelled&quot;, but that it would have to be conducted safely, and that allowing parades was not &quot;responsible&quot; as they can be superspreading events. This marked the first large-scale cancellation of Mardi Gras parades since the 1979 police strike. Other krewes subsequently announced that they would cancel their in-person balls, including Endymion and Rex (who therefore did not name a King and Queen of Mardi Gras for the first time since World War II). 

Socially-distanced festivities were established by residents, including &quot;house floats&quot;–a trend of decorating homes in the style of parade floats. A Facebook group known as the &quot;Krewe of House Floats&quot; shared photos of the homes and provided maps, recording participation in the movement in both New Orleans and abroad, including at least one in Australia.

On February 5, 2021, in response to continued concerns surrounding &quot;recent large crowds in the Quarter&quot; and variants of SARS-CoV-2 as Shrove Tuesday neared, Mayor Cantrell ordered all bars in New Orleans (including those with temporary permits to operate as restaurants) to close from February 12 through February 16 (Mardi Gras), and prohibited to-go drink sales by restaurants, and all packaged liquor sales in the French Quarter. To discourage gatherings, pedestrian access to Bourbon Street, Decatur Street, Frenchmen Street between 7:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m., and Claiborne Avenue under the bridge, was restricted by checkpoints to those accessing businesses and homes within the areas. Mayor Cantrell stated that she would &quot;rather be accused of doing too much than doing too little.&quot; The move caught some establishments off-guard, as they had been preparing for and anticipating business on Mardi Gras.

Parades were allowed to return for 2022. In December 2021, the city announced that parades would have modified routes in 2022 due to New Orleans Police Department staffing shortages. On January 6, 2022, Mayor Cantrell stated during a kickoff event that &quot;without a doubt, we will have Mardi Gras in 2022&quot;, citing high COVID-19 vaccination rates, and customarily asked residents to &quot;do everything that we know is necessary to keep our people safe.&quot; The Krewe de Jeanne D&#x27;Arc ceremonially led their parade with a group of marchers with brooms wearing plague doctor outfits, tasked to &quot;sweep the plague away&quot;.

The city announced COVID-19 protocols for Mardi Gras 2022 in February 2022, which requires, at a minimum, all participants in a parade (including marchers, performers, and those a riding a float) to present proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test from within the past 72 hours. Some krewes chose to not accept negative tests at all, while some krewes (such as the Krewe of Muses, which also announced plans to have COVID-19 rapid tests as throws) had already announced vaccination requirements for parade participants ahead of the official requirement. Despite the presence of Omicron variant, city health director Jennifer Avegno stated that she was confident Mardi Gras could be conducted in a more normal fashion over 2021.

==Traditional colors==
The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are purple, green, and gold. The colors were first specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were chosen; some accounts suggest that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true symbolism. Each color also has meaningful representation: purple for justice, green for faith, and gold for power. 

Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors in that order symbolized justice, power, and faith. Mardi Gras historian and WYES-TV Rex ball co-host Errol Laborde presented a theory that the colors were based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and Rex&#x27;s goal may have been to create a tricolor to represent their &quot;kingdom&quot;. Purple was widely associated with royalty, while white was already heavily used on other national flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and purple in that order complies with the rule of tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to other colors, and that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as purple, green, and gold, in that order—even though this order technically violates the rule of tincture.

==Contemporary Mardi Gras==

===Epiphany===
Epiphany on January 6, has been recognized as the start of the New Orleans Carnival season since at least 1900; locally, it is sometimes known as Twelfth Night although this term properly refers to Epiphany Eve, January 5, the evening of the twelfth day of Christmastide. The Twelfth Night Revelers, New Orleans&#x27; second-oldest Krewe, have staged a parade and masked ball on this date since 1870. A number of other groups such as the Phunny Phorty Phellows, La Société Pas Si Secrète Des Champs-Élysées and the Krewe de Jeanne D&#x27;Arc have more recently begun to stage events on Epiphany as well.

Many of Carnival&#x27;s oldest societies, such as the Independent Strikers&#x27; Society, hold masked balls but no longer parade in public.

Mardi Gras season continues through Shrove Tuesday or &quot;Fat Tuesday&quot;.

===Days leading up to Mardi Gras Day===
A 2020 study estimated that Mardi Gras brings 1.4 million visitors to New Orleans.

Wednesday night begins with Druids, and is followed by Alla.

Thursday night starts off with The Knights of Babylon, and then another all-women&#x27;s parade featuring the Krewe of Muses. The parade is relatively new, but its membership has tripled since its start in 2001. It is popular for its throws (highly sought-after decorated shoes and other trinkets) and themes poking fun at politicians and celebrities.

Friday night is the occasion of the large Krewe of Hermes and satirical Krewe D&#x27;État parades, ending with one of the fastest-growing krewes, the Krewe of Morpheus. There are several smaller neighborhood parades like the Krewe of Barkus and the Krewe of OAK.

Several daytime parades roll on Saturday (including Krewe of Tucks and Krewe of Iris) and on Sunday (Thoth, Okeanos, and Krewe of Mid-City).

The first of the &quot;super krewes&quot;, Endymion, parades on Saturday night, with the celebrity-led Bacchus parade on Sunday night.

===Mardi Gras Day===
The celebrations begin early on Mardi Gras Day, which can fall on any Tuesday between February 3 and March 9 (depending on the date of Easter, and thus of Ash Wednesday).

In New Orleans, the Zulu parade rolls first, starting at 8:00 a.m. on the corner of Jackson and Claiborne and ending at Broad and Orleans, Rex follows Zulu as it turns onto St. Charles following the traditional Uptown route from Napoleon to St. Charles and then to Canal St. Truck parades follow Rex and often have hundreds of floats blowing loud horns, with entire families riding and throwing much more than just the traditional beads and doubloons. Numerous smaller parades and walking clubs also parade around the city. The Jefferson City Buzzards, the Lyons Club, the Irish Channel Corner Club, Pete Fountain&#x27;s Half Fast Walking Club and the KOE all start early in the day Uptown and make their way to the French Quarter with at least one jazz band. At the other end of the old city, the Society of Saint Anne journeys from the Bywater through Marigny and the French Quarter to meet Rex on Canal Street. The Pair-O-Dice Tumblers rambles from bar to bar in Marigny and the French Quarter from noon to dusk. Various groups of Mardi Gras Indians, divided into uptown and downtown tribes, parade in their finery.

==Costumes and masks==
In New Orleans, costumes and masks are seldom publicly worn by non-Krewe members on the days before Fat Tuesday (other than at parties), but are frequently worn on Mardi Gras. Laws against concealing one&#x27;s identity with a mask are suspended for the day. Banks are closed, and some businesses and other places with security concerns (such as convenience stores) post signs asking people to remove their masks before entering.

==Throws==

A &#x27;throw&#x27; is the collective term used for the objects that are thrown from floats to parade-goers. Until the 1960s, the most common form was multi-colored strings of glass beads made in Czechoslovakia.

Glass beads were supplanted by less expensive and more durable plastic beads, first from Hong Kong, then from Taiwan, and more recently from China. Lower-cost beads and toys allow float-riders to purchase greater quantities, and throws have become more numerous and common.

In the 1990s, many people lost interest in small, cheap beads, often leaving them where they landed on the ground. Larger, more elaborate metallic beads and strands with figures of animals, people, or other objects have become the sought-after throws. David Redmond&#x27;s 2005 film of cultural and economic globalization, , follows the production and distribution of beads from a small factory in Fuzhou, China to the streets of New Orleans during Carnival. The publication of Redmon&#x27;s book, &quot;Beads, Bodies, and Trash: Public Sex, Global Labor, and the Disposability of Mardi Gras&quot;, follows up on the documentary by providing an ethnographic analysis of the social harms, the pleasures, and the consequences of the toxicity that Mardi Gras beads produce.

In addition to the toxicity of tons of plastic, eye injuries from Mardi Gras parade throws are commonplace, and more severe injuries—such as a fractured skull in an infant struck by a coconut—have also been known to occur.

==Other Mardi Gras traditions==

===Social clubs===
New Orleans Social Clubs or Gentlemen&#x27;s Clubs play a very large part in the Mardi Gras celebration. The oldest is The Boston Club (third oldest in the United States), founded in 1841 as a place for its members to congregate and partake in the fashionable card game of Boston, Rex Royalty is chosen from among its ranks. The Pickwick Club began as the public face of The Mistick Krewe, but later officially severed ties, still presents debutante balls annually. The Louisiana Club or officially the Louisiana Debating and Literary Association is still the public facade of the Knights of Momus, while the Stratford Club serves as the face of the Order of Mythras.

The two main Mardi Gras parades, Zulu and Rex, are both social club parades. Zulu is a mostly African-American club and Rex is mostly Caucasian. Social clubs host Mardi Gras balls, starting in late January. At these social balls, the queen of the parade (usually a young woman between the ages of 18 and 21, not married and in high school or college) and the king (an older male member of the club) present themselves and their court of maids (young women aged 16 to 21), and different divisions of younger children with small roles in the ball and parade, such as a theme-beformal neighborhood Carnival club ball at local bar room.

After their exclusion from Rex, in 1909 Black Creole and other African American New Orleanians, led by a mutual aid group known as &quot;The Tramps&quot;, adorned William Storey with a tin can crown and banana stalk scepter and named him King Zulu. This display was meant as a mockery of Rex&#x27;s overstated pageantry but in time, Zulu became a grand parade in its own right. By 1949, as an indication of Zulu&#x27;s increase in prestige, the krewe named New Orleans&#x27; native son Louis Armstrong as its king.

Being a member of the court requires much preparation, usually months ahead. Women and girls must have dress fittings as early as the May before the parade, as the season of social balls allows little time between each parade. These balls are generally by invitation only. Balls are held at a variety of venues in the city, large and small, depending on the size and budget of the organization. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the French Opera House was a leading venue for New Orleans balls. From the mid 20th century until Hurricane Katrina the Municipal Auditorium was the city&#x27;s most famous site for Carnival balls. In more recent years, most are at the ballrooms of various hotels throughout the city. The largest &quot;Super Krewes&quot; use larger venues; Bacchus the Morial Convention Center and Endymion the Superdome.

===Doubloons===

One of the many Mardi Gras throws which krewes fling into the crowds, doubloons are large coins, either wood or metal, made in Mardi Gras colors. Artist H. Alvin Sharpe created the modern doubloon for The School of Design (the actual name of the Rex organization). According to the krewe history, in January 1959 Sharpe arrived at the offices of the captain of the krewe with a handful of aluminum discs. Upon entering the office, he threw the doubloons into the captain&#x27;s face to prove that they would be safe to throw from the floats. Standard krewe doubloons usually portray the Krewe&#x27;s emblem, name, and founding date on one side, and the theme and year of the parade and ball on the other side. Royalty and members of the court may throw specialty doubloons, such as the special Riding Lieutenant doubloons given out by men on horseback in the Rex parade. In the last decade, krewes have minted doubloons specific to each float. Krewes also mint special doubloons of cloisonné or pure silver for its members. They never throw these from the floats. Original Rex doubloons are valuable, but it is nearly impossible for aficionados to find a certified original doubloon. The School of Design did not begin dating their doubloons until a few years after their introduction.

===Flambeau carriers===

The &quot;flambeau&quot; (pronounced &quot;flahm-bo&quot;, meaning flame-torch) carrier originally, before electric lighting, served as a beacon for New Orleans parade goers to better enjoy the spectacle of night parades. The first flambeau carriers were slaves. Today, the flambeaux are a connection to the New Orleans version of Carnival and a valued contribution. Many people view flambeau-carrying as a kind of performance art – a valid assessment given the wild gyrations and flourishes displayed by experienced flambeau carriers in a parade. Many individuals are descended from a long line of carriers. Parades that commonly feature flambeaux include Babylon, Bacchus, Chaos, Le Krewe d&#x27;Etat, Druids, Endymion, Hermes, Krewe of Muses, Krewe of Orpheus, Krewe of Proteus, Saturn, and Sparta. Flambeaux are powered by naphtha, a highly flammable aromatic. It is a tradition, when the flambeau carriers pass by during a parade, to toss quarters to them in thanks for carrying the lights of Carnival. In the 21st century, though, handing dollar bills is common.

===Rex===
Rex was formed to create a daytime spectacle not only for the residents of the city but for special guest Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia. The Rex motto is, &quot;Pro Bono Publico—for the public good.&quot;

===New Orleans Zulu or Mardi Gras Coconut===
One of the most famous and the most sought after throws, is the Zulu Coconut also known as the Golden Nugget and the Mardi Gras Coconut. The coconut is mentioned as far back as 1910, where they were given in a natural &quot;hairy&quot; state. The coconut was thrown as a cheap alternative, especially in 1910 when the bead throws were made of glass. Before the Krewe of Zulu threw coconuts, they threw walnuts that were painted gold. This is where the name &quot;Golden Nugget&quot; originally came from. It is thought that Zulu switched from walnuts to coconuts in the early 1920s when a local painter, Lloyd Lucus, started to paint coconuts. Most of the coconuts have two decorations. The first is painted gold with added glitter, and the second is painted like the famous black Zulu faces. In 1988, the city forbade Zulu from throwing coconuts due to the risk of injury; they are now handed to onlookers rather than thrown. In the year 2000, a local electronics engineer, Willie Clark, introduced an upgraded version of the classic, naming them Mardi Gras Coconuts. These new coconuts were first used by the club in 2002, giving the souvenirs to royalty and city notables.

===Ojen liqueur===
&quot;Aguardiente de Ojén&quot; (es), or simply &quot;ojen&quot; (&quot;OH-hen&quot;) as it is known in English, is a Spanish anisette traditionally consumed during the New Orleans Mardi Gras festivities. In Ojén, the original Spanish town where it is produced, production stopped for years, but it started again in early 2014 by means of the distillery company Dominique Mertens Impex. S.L.

===House floats===
In 2021 due to the cancellation of parades due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the practice of decorating homes in the style of parade floats emerged as an alternative, dubbed &quot;home floats&quot; or &quot;house floats&quot;. The concept was popularized immediately after the announcement that in-person parades would be prohibited, stemming from a post on Twitter by Megan Boudreaux. She later established a formal &quot;Krewe of House Floats&quot;, with participants being listed in an interactive map on its website so local residents can tour them. The revised celebration was nicknamed &quot;Yardi Gras&quot; by residents. Even the dog parade, held by the Mystic Krewe of Mardi Paws in Covington, opted to make &quot;dog house floats&#x27; in 2021.

===Public nudity===

Wearing less clothing than considered decent in other contexts during Mardi Gras has been documented since 1889, when the &quot;Times-Democrat&quot; decried the &quot;degree of immodesty exhibited by nearly all female masqueraders seen on the streets.&quot; Risqué costumes, including body painting, are fairly common. The practice of exposing female breasts in exchange for Mardi Gras beads, however, was mostly limited to tourists in the upper Bourbon Street area. In the crowded streets of the French Quarter, generally avoided by locals on Mardi Gras Day, flashers on balconies cause crowds to form on the streets.

In the last decades of the 20th century, the rise in producing commercial videotapes catering to voyeurs helped encourage a tradition of women baring their breasts in exchange for beads and trinkets. Social scientists studying &quot;ritual disrobement&quot; found, at Mardi Gras 1991, 1,200 instances of body-baring in exchange for beads or other favors.

<text>In bioinformatics, sequence clustering algorithms attempt to group biological sequences that are somehow related. The sequences can be either of genomic, &quot;transcriptomic&quot; (ESTs) or protein origin.
For proteins, homologous sequences are typically grouped into families. For EST data, clustering is important to group sequences originating from the same gene before the ESTs are assembled to reconstruct the original mRNA.

Some clustering algorithms use single-linkage clustering, constructing a transitive closure of sequences with a similarity over a particular threshold. UCLUST and CD-HIT use a greedy algorithm that identifies a representative sequence for each cluster and assigns a new sequence to that cluster if it is sufficiently similar to the representative; if a sequence is not matched then it becomes the representative sequence for a new cluster. The similarity score is often based on sequence alignment. Sequence clustering is often used to make a non-redundant set of representative sequences.

Sequence clusters are often synonymous with (but not identical to) protein families. Determining a representative tertiary structure for each sequence cluster is the aim of many structural genomics initiatives.

<text>The sheltopusik (Pseudopus apodus), also commonly called Pallas&#x27;s glass lizard, the European legless lizard, or the European glass lizard, is a species of large glass lizard found from Southern Europe to Central Asia.

==Etymology==
 comes from Greek , literally meaning &quot;fake-legged&quot; or without legs.

The common name &quot;sheltopusik&quot; comes from Russian (), which translates most directly as &quot;yellow-bellied&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The sheltopusik was previously included in the genus &quot;Ophisaurus&quot;, but has since been placed in its own genus &quot;Pseudopus&quot;. It was originally described in 1775 by Peter Simon Pallas as &quot;Lacerta apoda&quot;.

There are three subspecies:

* &quot;P. a. apodus&quot; – the type subspecies, ranging from Crimea through Transcaucasia, east to Central Asia as far as Kazakhstan 
* &quot;P. a. levantinus&quot; – restricted to the Levant, from southern Turkey south to Israel and Palestine
* &quot;P. a. thracicus&quot; – the westernmost subspecies, ranging from Croatia to Greece, east to western Turkey

Despite only being described in 2021, &quot;P. a. levantinus&quot; is the largest and most genetically diverse of the subspecies, indicating an older and more complex evolutionary history compared to its sister subspecies.

==Description==

The sheltopusik can reach a length of . It is tan colored, paler on the ventral surface and the head, with a ring-like/segmented appearance that makes it look like a large earthworm with a distinctive fold of skin down each side called a lateral groove. Small (2-mm) rear legs are sometimes visible near the cloaca. Though the legs are barely discernible, the sheltopusik can be quickly distinguished from a snake by its ears, eyelids, and ventral scales.

==Habitat and behaviour==
&quot;P. apodus&quot; inhabits open country, such as short grassland or sparsely wooded hills. It consumes arthropods and small mammals. Snails and slugs appear to be its favorite prey, which may explain why it is particularly active in wet weather, although it prefers a dry habitat. Breaking through the shells of snails is an especially easy task due to their teeth and jaw structure. 

==Defensive behaviour==
Due to its size, the sheltopusik tends to respond to harassment by hissing, biting, and musking. It is less likely to drop off its tail than some other species that display caudal autotomy. However, these occasional displays of caudal autotomy are responsible for the name &quot;glass lizard&quot; (or &quot;glass snake&quot;). The released tail may break into pieces, leading to the myth that the lizard can shatter like glass and reassemble itself later. In reality, if the tail is lost, it grows back slowly, but is shorter and darker. The replacement tail may grow back to full length after an extended period of time. 

==In captivity==
Sheltopusiks are frequently available in the exotic pet trade, though rarely captive-bred. They do not typically tolerate a large amount of handling, but they adapt to captivity well, feeding on crickets, meal worms, small mice, eggs, snails, or pieces of meat. They are even known to accept these meals from a keeper&#x27;s tweezers, or even from their hands once they become used to captivity. However, sheltopusiks do get excited around food and have surprisingly powerful jaws. They make hardy captives, capable of living up to 50 years.

==Reproduction==
About 10 weeks after mating, the female &quot;P. apodus&quot; lays about eight eggs, which she hides under bark or a stone, and often guards them. The young hatch after 45 to 55 days. They are typically about long and usually start to eat after four days.

== Relationship with humans ==
Remains of the Levant subspecies (&quot;P. a. levantinus&quot;) are known from Natufian sites in Israel, suggesting that it was eaten by the local population at the time.

Mifune is located in central Kumamoto Prefecture.

=== Palaeontology ===
In March 2014, a piece of sandstone was found in Mifune that was revealed to contain a tooth dated to the Late Cretaceous, 90 million years ago. The tooth is the oldest thus found in Japan and is assumed to be a back tooth from the left, upper jaw of a carnivore similar to a &quot;Deltatheridium&quot;, an ancient marsupial relative that lived in what is now Mongolia between 145 and 66 million years ago. The find was announced by the Mifune Dinosaur Museum in August 2017. The museum and town also partner with Montana State University&#x27;s Museum of the Rockies.

<text>Ronald Jack Mix (born March 10, 1938) is an American former professional football player who was an offensive tackle. He is a member of the American Football League All-Time Team, and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979. Mix played college football for the USC Trojans, where he was named to the All American team. He played at right tackle and guard for the Los Angeles / San Diego Chargers of the American Football League (AFL) and also played for the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). While playing in Oakland for the Raiders he was a part of the only offensive line in NFL history to be composed entirely all Hall of Famers. Art Shell, Gene Upshaw, Jim Otto, Ron Mix, and Bob Brown from left to right. An eight-time AFL All-Star (1961–1968) and a nine-time All-AFL (1960–1968) selection, he is also a member of the Los Angeles Chargers Hall of Fame.

== Early and personal life ==
Mix was born in Los Angeles, California, grew up in its Boyle Heights neighborhood, and is Jewish. He attended Hawthorne High School in Hawthorne, California.

Mix, who was listed at 6&#x27; 5&quot; and 270 pounds, was an early proponent of weightlifting to enhance athletic power. He was years ahead of the curve that soon saw lineman and other football players taking up that practice to become better athletes. His lifts included a military press of 300 pounds, a clean and jerk of 325 pounds, and a bench press of 425 pounds, all of the lifts considered to be exceptionally strong for that era of play.

Mix went to the University of San Diego Law School in the off-season and earned a Juris Doctor degree in 1971. He was nicknamed &quot;The Intellectual Assassin&quot; for his combination of intellectual excellence with his style of physical play.

== College career ==

Mix attended the University of Southern California (USC) on a football scholarship. There in 1959 he was a First Team All American, AP First Team All-Pacific Coast, First Team All Big Five, and won the USC Lineman Award. He was a member of the Delta Chi fraternity. At USC he minored in English. During his career Mix wrote a number of articles for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. He was elected the National Jewish College Athlete of the Year.

== Professional career ==

Mix was selected in the first round by two teams in 1960. The Baltimore Colts picked him as the tenth pick in 1960 on November 30 in the National Football League. He was drafted by the Boston Patriots in the first round of the American Football League draft, but the rights to Mix were traded to the Los Angeles Chargers, who felt they had a worthy chance at getting the local player to sign with them. Baltimore offered him an $8,000 salary and a $1,000 signing bonus while Los Angeles offered $12,000 and a $5,000 bonus. Mix said he would&#x27;ve signed with Baltimore if they countered with a deal of $10,000 salary and $2,000 bonus. The Colts, telling him the league would flop in a year, declined, and Mix elected to sign with Los Angeles.

He was a factor in the Chargers&#x27; early domination of the AFL&#x27;s Western Division, and in San Diego helped them win an American Football League Championship in 1963, when they defeated the Boston Patriots 51–10 in the championship game. Mix was called for a mere two holding penalties in ten years. His coach in Sid Gillman once called him &quot;the best offensive lineman I’ve ever seen.&quot;

Mix was the first white player in the 1965 AFL All-Star game in New Orleans to step forward and join his black teammates in a civil rights boycott. The racist environment of New Orleans caused the black players to say they weren&#x27;t playing in a city that denied them the most basic rights (to eat, to get a cab, etc.). He made it clear that if the black players were not going to play, neither would he. That caused other white players to join the boycott. The game was then moved to Houston.

He was elected to the AFL All-Star team for eight straight years as a Charger, was a nine-time All-AFL selection, is a member of the All-time All-AFL Team, and is one of only 20 men who played the entire 10 years of the AFL. He was the first Charger to have his number retired in 1969 after he announced he was quitting football after playing injured that season. He earned a J.D. degree from the University of San Diego School of Law in 1970.

Mix told the Chargers he wanted to play again, but they had found a replacement in Gene Ferguson. After he asked to be traded to the New York Jets, San Diego dealt him to the Oakland Raiders for two high draft picks in 1970 and 1971. The deal was contingent upon Mix unretiring and agreeing to play for Oakland; he played with the Raiders in 1971. Chargers owner Eugene V. Klein, who hated the Raiders, unretired Mix&#x27;s number 74.

Mix was also the general manager of the WFL Portland Storm in 1974.

==Halls of fame==
In 1969 Mix was unanimously voted to the All-Time AFL Team by the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and named to the Chargers Hall of Fame in 1978.

He was voted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979. Mix was also elected a member of the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1980, inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1990, inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2008, and inducted into the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame of Northern California in 2010. He was the second player from the AFL to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Lance Alworth was the first in 1978.

== After football ==

Mix practiced law in San Diego, California with his business focused on representing retired professional athletes in claims for workers&#x27; compensation benefits. Prior to that, he was a civil litigator.

In 2016, the IRS accused Mix of filing a false tax return. Federal prosecutors said Mix got referrals for clients from a non-lawyer, a former professional basketball player client of his named Kermit Washington and that Mix made contributions to two charitable foundations run by Washington that supported a school and other causes in Africa. Mix took tax deductions for the contributions. Court records alleged that Washington diverted most of money donated to his charities for his own personal use. Mix pled guilty to one count of filing a false tax return. The plea agreement specifically said that Mix believed the charity was legitimate and did not know the funds were being diverted. Nonetheless, claiming the charitable contributions were wrong because Mix got something of value—the referrals. US District Judge Greg Kays imposed a time-served sentence (less than probation). On February 24, 2019, Mix was permanently disbarred.
