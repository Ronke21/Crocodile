<text>General Magnus André de Merindol Malan (30 January 1930 – 18 July 2011) was a South African military figure and politician during the last years of apartheid in South Africa. He served respectively as Minister of Defence in the cabinet of President P. W. Botha, Chief of the South African Defence Force (SADF), and Chief of the South African Army. Rising quickly through the lower ranks, he was appointed to strategic command positions. His tenure as chief of the defence force saw it increase in size, efficiency and capabilities. 

As P.W. Botha&#x27;s cabinet minister, he posited a total communist onslaught, for which an encompassing national strategy was devised. This entailed placing policing, intelligence and aspects of civic affairs under control of generals. The ANC and SWAPO were branded as terrorist organizations, while splinter groups (UNITA and RENAMO) were bolstered in neighbouring and Frontline States. Cross-border raids targeted suspected bases of insurgents or activists, while at home the army entered townships from 1984 onwards to stifle unrest. Elements in the Inkhata Freedom Party were used as a proxy force, and rogue soldiers and policemen in the CCB assassinated opponents.

==Personal life==

Malan&#x27;s father was a professor of biochemistry at the University of Pretoria and later a member of parliament (1948–1966) and Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees (1961–1966) of the House of Assembly. He started his high school education at the Afrikaanse Hoër Seunskool but later moved to Dr Danie Craven’s Physical Education Brigade in Kimberley, where he completed his matriculation. He wanted to join the South African armed forces immediately after his matriculation, but his father advised him first to complete his university studies. As a result of this advice, Malan enrolled at the University of Stellenbosch in 1949 to study for a Bachelor of Commerce degree. However, he later abandoned his studies in Stellenbosch and went to University of Pretoria, where he enrolled for a BSc Mil. degree. He graduated in 1953.

In 1962, Malan married Magrietha Johanna van der Walt; the couple had two sons and one daughter.

==Military career==

At the end of 1949, the first military degree course for officers was advertised and Malan joined the Permanent Force as a cadet, going on to complete his BSc Mil at the University of Pretoria in 1953.

Malan was commissioned in the Navy and served in the Marines based on Robben Island. When they were disbanded, he was transferred back into the Army as a lieutenant.

Malan was earmarked for high office from early on in his military career; one of the many courses he attended was the Regular Command and General Staff Officers Course at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in the United States of America from 1962 to 1963. During this time he was introduced to President J.F. Kennedy and spent time doing manouvres with an American Armoured Division. In 1967, at age 36, while stationed in Windhoek and holding the rank of colonel, Malan joined the secretive Broederbond organization. He went on to serve as commanding officer of various formations, including Western Province Command, South West Africa Command, and the South African Military Academy.

In 1973, Malan was appointed as Chief of the South African Army and three years later as Chief of the South African Defence Force (SADF). As Chief of the SADF he implemented many administrative changes that earned him great admiration in military circles. During this period he became very close to P.W. Botha, the then Minister of Defence and later Prime Minister and State President of South Africa.

===Awards and decorations===

Malan was awarded the following awards and decorations:

*

==Political career==

In October 1980, Botha appointed Malan defence minister in the National Party government, a post he held until 1991. As a result of this appointment, he joined the National Party and became Member of Parliament for Modderfontein. He was also elected to be a member of the Executive Council of the National Party.

During Malan&#x27;s tenure in parliament as defence minister, his greatest opposition came from MPs of the Progressive Federal Party such as Harry Schwarz and Philip Myburgh, who both served as shadow defence ministers at various points during the 1980s.

In July 1991, following a scandal involving secret government funding to the Inkatha Freedom Party and other opponents of the African National Congress, President F. W. de Klerk removed Malan from his influential post of defence minister and appointed him as the minister for water affairs and forestry.

The strike craft of the South African Navy was named after him prior to the change of government in 1994.

==Later life==

On 2 November 1995, Malan was charged together with 19 other former senior military officers for murdering 13 people (including seven children) in the KwaMakhutha massacre in 1987. The murders were said to have been part of a conspiracy to create war between the African National Congress (ANC) and the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), and maintaining white minority rule. The charges related to an attack in January 1987 on the home of Victor Ntuli, an ANC activist, in KwaMakhutha township near Durban in KwaZulu-Natal.

Malan and the other accused were bailed and ordered to appear in court again on 1 December 1995. A seven-month trial then ensued and brought hostility between black and white South Africans to the fore once again. All the accused were eventually acquitted. President Mandela called on South Africans to respect the verdict. Nonetheless in South Africa, the Malan trial has come to be seen by some as a failure of the legal process.

Malan also had to appear before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

On 26 January 2007, he was interviewed by shortwave/Internet talk radio show &quot;The Right Perspective&quot;. It is believed to be one of the very few, if not the only, interviews Malan gave outside of South Africa. In 2006, he published an autobiography titled &quot;My Life With the SA Defence Force.&quot;

Malan died at his home in Pretoria on 18 July 2011. He was survived by his wife, 3 children and 9 grandchildren.

== Controversy ==


In August 2018, a book by a former apartheid-era policeman Mark Minnie and journalist Chris Steyn alleged that Malan had been involved in a paedophilia ring in the 1980s. The book, &quot;The Lost Boys of Bird Island&quot; contains testimony that Malan used his position as Defence Minister to kidnap and ferry young Coloured boys to an island off the coast of South Africa by helicopter, under the pretext of going on a fishing trip. They were then allegedly raped and otherwise sexually abused by Malan and other members of the ring who purportedly included local businessman Dave Allen, former minister of environmental affairs John Wiley, and at least one other government minister who is not named but is still alive. The book, however, contained sufficient information for readers to conclude that former finance minister, Barend du Plessis, was the implicated living minister.

Dave Allen was later arrested for paedophilia but was found dead from an apparent suicide before he was due to appear in court. Wiley was found dead just weeks later. Mark Minnie, one of the authors of &quot;Lost Boys&quot; was found dead in August 2018.

The allegations were met with scepticism and rejected by those who were intimately acquainted with Malan, including his surviving family. In a review by investigative journalist Jacques Pauw, Minnie is described as &quot;a sloppy, negligent and careless policeman&quot;. Pauw criticised the book&#x27;s authors, especially Minnie, for the quality of the investigation and research supporting the allegations and Steyn for having a conflict of interest; and asserted that this has had a negative impact on the victims getting justice. In April 2019, a major South African newspaper, Rapport, published an apology for their reporting based on the book. The newspaper apologised to the surviving relatives of Malan as new evidence had emerged that cast doubt on the contents of the book and the key allegations were based on unsubstantiated hearsay. On the morning of 3 March 2020, Johan Victor Attorneys, who represented Barend du Plessis and the surviving families of Malan and Wiley, released a press statement revealing that, after a forensic investigation was conducted into the allegations made in the book, major concessions and a lack of concrete evidence implicating any of the ministers had been found. The publishers of The Lost Boys of Bird Island, Tafelberg, a subsidiary of NB Publishers, retracted the book from the market in both its hard copy and e-book form later on the same afternoon. They issued a statement in which an apology was extended to Barend du Plessis, but not to any other person identified in the book.

<text>James Reynolds Bath (born August 18, 1936) is a Texas businessman who has business interests in aircraft sales and leasing and real estate. He is best known for his business relationships with Saudi businessmen Salem bin Laden and Khalid bin Mahfouz.

==Biography==
Bath was born in 1936 in Natchitoches, Louisiana. In 1965, he moved to Houston, where he became an aircraft broker.

In 1975, Bath met Salem bin Laden when bin Laden was interested in purchasing a used aircraft. Salem bin Laden was the son of Mohammed bin Laden, founder of the Saudi Binladin Group, one of the largest construction companies in the world. Through this acquaintance, Bath eventually became bin Laden&#x27;s business representative in the United States, representing him in a number of business deals, including real estate, aircraft services, and banking. Through bin Laden, Bath also met Khalid bin Mahfouz, the son of Salem Bin Mahfouz, founder of National Commercial Bank, now the largest bank in Saudi Arabia, and for a time represented him as well.

==Bath and George W. Bush==
Bath is an acquaintance of former president George W. Bush, whom he met when both men were serving in the Texas Air National Guard in the early 1970s. After Bush started his first business, Arbusto Energy, Bath invested $50,000 in the firm. A former business partner of Bath, Charles White, who was involved in a number of suits against Bath, claimed in a 2003 interview with Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that the investment in fact came from bin Mahfouz and bin Laden, and amounted to over a million dollars, reiterating allegations that previously appeared in &quot;The Outlaw Bank&quot;, a 1993 book regarding the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) authored by &quot;Time&quot; journalists S.C. Gwynne and Jonathan Beaty. Both Bush and Bath have denied this, and according to journalist Craig Unger, who examined the relationship between the Bushes and Saudi financiers in his 2004 book &quot;House of Bush, House of Saud&quot;, there is no evidence to support it. Similar conclusions have been reached by journalist Steve Coll in his 2008 book &quot;The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century&quot;.

==Plot==
Junta Momonari is a high school student with a very unusual problem. Whenever he becomes sexually aroused by a woman, his &quot;female allergy&quot; kicks in, causing him to throw up. One day, Junta is confronted by a girl in strange clothing who claims to be from the future. The girl, called Karin Aoi, tells him about how the world has become terribly overpopulated in her time, to the point where having more than one child is a crime punishable by death. At the root of the problem is a family of &quot;Mega-Playboys&quot;: people with sexual charisma and impulses that lead each of them to have 100 children that carry the Mega-Playboy DNA, causing them and all their descendants to each have 100 children as well. All this started with a single Mega-Playboy, whom Karin has travelled back into the past to deal with. Karin reveals to Junta that she is a &quot;DNA Operator&quot;. Her job is to make alterations in people&#x27;s DNA that will change their nature for the greater good of society. She intends to shoot the original Mega-Playboy with a DCM (&quot;DNA Control Medicine&quot;) bullet that will alter his DNA in order to relieve him of his mega-playboy qualities, thus preventing the overpopulation problem from ever happening. She can then return to the future to receive the reward that will allow her to finally get the &quot;nice husband, cute pet, and sweet, sweet home&quot; she yearns for. She confirms Junta&#x27;s identity, then, to his shock, promptly shoots him.

Junta, the boy who could not look at a naked woman without throwing up, was destined to become the original Mega-Playboy later in his life. Escaping back to her time machine, Karin arrives to a message from her boss in the future. Her hopes for a commendation on a job well done are dashed when her rather upset employer points out that the DCM bullet she was supposed to use on the Mega-Playboy was left behind in the future. By shooting Junta with the wrong DCM bullet—one which Karin planned on using to create an ideal husband—rather than eliminating the Mega-Playboy, Karin actually created him. Now unable to return to the future until she sets things right, Karin decides to improvise by making Junta get together with the only girl who does not give him an allergic reaction: his childhood friend Ami Kurimoto, for whom he does not feel any romantic affection, since he sees her more as a sister.

==Characters==
:
:A high school boy with a peculiar allergy to girls: he vomits when sexually aroused. He gains the ability to transform into the Mega-Playboy, practically at will, after being shot by Karin&#x27;s first DCM bullet. However, each time he transforms, his Mega-Playboy DNA stabilizes more and more.
:
:A sixteen-year-old DNA Operator from the overcrowded future, sent back in time in order to prevent the advent of the Mega-Playboy using DCM, however she brings back the wrong bullet from the future which accelerates Junta in becoming the Mega-Playboy. All she wants out of life is a nice husband, a cute pet, and a sweet home, but when she met Junta, she falls in love with him–at first because of his Mega-Playboy powers, and finally because of him as a person.
:
:Junta&#x27;s childhood friend and schoolmate, and, except for two instances, the only girl who doesn&#x27;t bring about an allergic reaction in him. She is also the only girl immune to the Mega-Playboy&#x27;s ability to seduce women, something Karin considers a key part in the plan to stop the Mega-Playboy. If Junta and Ami stay together, she can nullify the Mega-Playboy&#x27;s charms and the future won&#x27;t be overcrowded.
:

<text>Qibla Cola was a cola-flavored carbonated beverage produced by the Qibla Cola Company, based in Derby, England. The company differentiated itself and its products from its rivals by making an ethical stance in all its operations including giving 10% of its profits to worthy charitable causes. The company expanded distribution into North America, Netherlands, Pakistan and Malaysia before the UK company went into receivership in September 2005.

==Founders==
The two founders of the company were cousins, Zahida Parveen and Zafer Iqbal from Derby. Zahida Parveen had been involved in a number of charitable projects and decided to initiate this company with a social aim of giving 10% of all profits to charity.
Abid Hussain was a public face and an investor in the company.

==Launch==
Qibla Cola was launched onto the UK market in February 2003, with a nationwide distribution established within months. Strong media interest resulted in reports appearing in the global media and distribution and investment offers coming worldwide.

The company made agreements with distributors in other countries in Europe, North America and Asia, including Canada, Netherlands, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Turkey and Malaysia.

==Philosophy==

Qibla Cola&#x27;s marketing strategy and corporate vision reflected an attempt to tap into a desire for responsible consumption. They claimed to offer a genuine alternative for those cola-drinkers who are wary about the practices and ethics of the major multinational soft-drink companies. Qibla&#x27;s ethical stance manifested itself in the company&#x27;s pledge to donate 10% of its net profits to humanitarian causes around the world.

The company said that its name, &quot;qibla&quot; was used in its primary linguistic sense, to mean &quot;direction&quot;. Qibla Cola was thus aimed at consumers of all faiths and ethnic backgrounds, although the company noted that they have had more success on Muslim markets and that all their products are halal.

The word qibla is also a reference to the word Qibla used by Muslims to indicate the direction of the Masjid al Haram in the holy city of Makkah, towards which all Muslims turn when praying.

Additionally it has been suggested Qibla is a play in the surname of one of the founders as it is an anagram of Iqbal.

In addition to its two cola varieties, the company produced and sold the following products:

*Qibla Mango
*Qibla Guava
*Qibla Fantasy (orange flavour)
*Qibla 5 (lemon-lime)
*Qibla Water (premium spring water)

Qibla&#x27;s chief competitors included Mecca-Cola, Iran&#x27;s Zamzam Cola, in addition to the US-originating products of the Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola families.

In a blind taste test conducted by The Guardian UK, Qibla was pitted against Pepsi, Coke and Sainsbury&#x27;s Classic Cola. Most tasters could not differentiate between any of the colas.

==Progress==

Operations in Turkey, Malaysia, Pakistan and Bangladesh are ongoing as independent entities.

The UK arm of the company was put into administration in September 2005 following claims by the owners of anti-competitive practices of competitors.

<text>HMPNGS &quot;Lakekamu is [[landing craft]] heavy (LCH) operated by the [[Papua New Guinea Defence Force#Maritime Operations Element|Maritime Operations Element]] of the [[Papua New Guinea Defence Force]] (PNGDF). The vessel was one of eight built for the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) in the 1970s, and was commissioned into the RAN asHMAS &quot;Labuan&quot; (L 128)in March 1973. &quot;Labuan&quot; was decommissioned in November 2014. She was transferred to the PNGDF for use as a [[training ship]] and was commissioned asHMPNGS &quot;Lakekamu in December 2014.

==Design and construction==

The eight-vessel &quot;Balikpapan&quot; class was ordered as a locally manufactured replacement for the Australian Army&#x27;s LSM-1-class landing ship medium and ALC 50 landing craft. They are long, with a beam of , and a draught of . The landing craft have a standard displacement of 316 tons, with a full load displacement of 503 tons. They are propelled by two G.M. Detroit 6–71 diesel motors, providing 675 brake horsepower to the two propeller shafts, allowing the vessels to reach . The standard ship&#x27;s company is 13-strong. The &quot;Balikpapan&quot;s are equipped with a Decca RM 916 navigational radar, and fitted with two machine guns for self-defence.

The LCHs have a maximum payload of 180 tons; equivalent to 3 Leopard 1 tanks, 13 M113 armoured personnel carriers 23 quarter-tonne trucks, or four LARC-V amphibious cargo vehicles. As a troop transport, a &quot;Balikpapan&quot;-class vessel can transport up to 400 soldiers between a larger amphibious ship and the shore, or embark 60 soldiers in six-berth caravans for longer voyages. The vessel&#x27;s payload affects the range: at 175 tons of cargo, each vessel has a range of , which increases to with a 150-ton payload, and when unladen. The flat, box-like keel causes the ships to roll considerably in other-than-calm conditions, limiting their ability to make long voyages.

The vessel was laid down by Walkers Limited, at Maryborough, Queensland on 1 November 1971, and launched on 29 December 1971. She was commissioned into the RAN as HMAS &quot;Labuan&quot; (pennant number L 128) on 9 March 1973. &quot;Labuan&quot; is named after the World War II amphibious landings at the Borneo island of Labuan. On entering service, she was homeported at in Brisbane.

==Operational history==
After completing working-up exercises, in May 1973, &quot;Labuan&quot; transported Clearance Diving Team One (CDT1) to Moreton Island to destroy a World War II era torpedo. In August, CDT1 was embarked again aboard &quot;Labuan&quot;, this time for a two-month deployment to Papua New Guinea. Between 15 August and 12 October, the landing craft visited communities around Papua New Guinea, with the clearance divers clearing reef passages and disposing of unexploded ordnance from World War II. After CDT1 flew back to Australia on 12 October, &quot;Labuan&quot; surveyed the Fly River, reaching . On 19 October, the vessel left Papua New Guinea and sailed to Cairns with sister ship . In November, &quot;Labuan&quot; was used for the Army exercise Temple Tower. On 21 November, &quot;Labuan&quot; and two fishing boats towed the rafts of the Las Balsas Expedition into the mouth of the Richmond River, after the rafts drifted off course on the final leg of their trans-Pacific voyage.

Between March and May 1974, the landing craft was based in Singapore, and was used to transport military materiel and stores to and from Belawan, Indonesia. Several major exercises were participated in during the rest of 1974: Kangaroo One in June, and Kentia Palm in September. During October and November, &quot;Labuan&quot; was stationed on the Great Barrier Reef with clearance divers embarked, as part of a project tracking the spread of the Crown of Thorns starfish. &quot;Labuan&quot; was the only RAN &quot;Balikpapan&quot;-class ship not involved in Operation Navy Help Darwin (the RAN response following Cyclone Tracy&#x27;s destruction of Darwin in December 1974), as she was undergoing refit at the time. In late February 1975, &quot;Labuan&quot; collided with a lighter during Exercise Wagon Train II. The damage was limited to patching a hole above the waterline. During April and May, the landing craft operated in southern Australian waters in support of Army training exercises. &quot;Labuan&quot; returned to Sydney, and during 12 and 13 May transported the RAN&#x27;s first two Sea King helicopters to Jervis Bay. The rest of 1975 and most of 1976 was spent on training exercises.

During September and October 1977, &quot;Labuan&quot; visited ports throughout South East Asia, cumulating in Biak on 6 October, where materiel used for Operation Cenderawasih – mapping and charting of Irian Jaya – was loaded aboard. The ship returned to Townsville on 25 October. During June and July 1978, &quot;Labuan&quot; was deployed on Operation Beachcomber – surveying of northern Queensland beaches. The rest of 1978 was spent on exercises. On 12 February 1979, &quot;Labuan&quot; began a refit. After the refit&#x27;s conclusion, the vessel was transferred to the Royal Australian Navy Reserve (RANR) on 15 June 1979 to serve as the training vessel for the Port Brisbane Division. In RNVR service, &quot;Labuan&quot; was used to provide training and seagoing experience to Reserve personnel, generally on two-week deployments. Despite being operated by the RANR, &quot;Labuan&quot; maintained a heavy schedule of exercise deployments and operations in support of the Army and RAN. During September and October 1980, clearance divers were embarked aboard &quot;Labuan&quot; for three weeks of shipping channel clearing around the Solomon Islands.

On 9 April 1987, &quot;Labuan&quot; rescued the 11 crew of the yacht &quot;Madame de Farge&quot;, which had run aground during the Sydney to Mooloolaba Yacht Race. During January 1988, the vessel was in Ballina, New South Wales for Bicentenary celebrations. In September, &quot;Labuan&quot; was in Sydney for the Bicentennial Naval Salute. &quot;Labuan&quot; was granted the right of Freedom of Entry to Ballina, New South Wales in 1988. At the start of 1992, the final RANR training cruise occurred, after which the vessel was docked in Cairns for a refit. On 17 August, &quot;Labuan&quot; was reassigned to the Permanent Naval Force, but because she was still undergoing refit, no permanent command team was assigned, and the post-refit trials were conducted under frequently-changing commanding officers.

From March until May 1993, &quot;Labuan&quot; was at Forgacs&#x27; Newcastle shipyard for removal of asbestos. In August, the ship&#x27;s home base was relocated to in Cairns, Queensland. On 31 December, the ship was forced to sail to avoid Tropical Cyclone Rewa. During 1995, &quot;Labuan&quot; provided logistical support to NORFORCE. On 14 May 1996, while returning from Exercise Thunder Bay 96, the landing craft ran aground on a reef off South Harrison Island. She was refloated on the next high tide, and returned to Cairns for repairs. In March 1997, the ship was placed on standby to evacuate Australian citizens from political unrest in Papua New Guinea; this need did not eventuate, and &quot;Labuan&quot; resumed normal operations in early April. During November, &quot;Labuan&quot; and &quot;Tarakan&quot; delivered humanitarian supplies to drought-stricken areas in northern Papua New Guinea. From December 1997 to February 1998, the vessel was berthed in Cairns for communications upgrades.

During 1998 and 1999, &quot;Labuan&quot; made four deployments to Bougainville Island as part of Operation Bel Isi: March to April and August to October in 1998, and January to March and July to August in 1999. In between these deployments, the ship continued on a program of training exercises and logistical support for other defence units. &quot;Labuan&quot; sailed to Dili, East Timor on 18 September 1999 as part of INTERFET. The ship provided logistic support, beach landing capability, and rest facilities for INTERFET forces. She remained in the area until 14 October, and was redeployed in support of INTERFET during November–December 1999, February–April 2000, June–July 2000, August–September 2000 and November–December 2000. These deployments were later recognised with the battle honour &quot;East Timor 1999–2000&quot;. On returning to Cairns at the end of 2000, the ship was prepared for a Life of Type Extension refit; the refit itself lasted from late February 2001 to early September 2001. On 15 October, &quot;Labuan&quot; sailed on another deployment to Bougainville, under Operation Bel Isi II.
During January 2002, &quot;Labuan&quot; was sent to Dili with a cargo of military vehicles. From April to July, she was deployed to Bougainville as part of Operation Bel Isi II. Subsequent deployments as part of the operation were made during September to October 2002, and April to May 2003. From July until September, the ship was in the Solomon Islands as part of the RAN contribution to the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), with &quot;Labuan&quot; undertaking logistic support operations, patrols, and assisting in the collection of weapons under the gun amnesty. A second RAMSI deployment occurred from April until May 2004. In November 2004, the ship visited Ballina. In March 2006, &quot;Labuan&quot; was involved in humanitarian operations following Cyclone Larry (after having ridden out the storm herself in Wahday Creek), moving supplies and equipment from Townsville to Mourilyan. In June 2006, the ship transported materiel between Darwin and Dili in support of Operation Astute. During August, &quot;Labuan&quot; was deployed on border patrol operations under Operation Resolute. Further Resolute deployments occurred during September and October, and in June 2007.

During August and September 2008, &quot;Labuan&quot; hosted scientists from the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Curtin University, and the Universities of Queensland and Sydney during a research survey of Beaked Whales. From April until June 2009, &quot;Labuan&quot; and &quot;Tarakan&quot; were deployed to the southwest Pacific, visiting Vanuatu, Tonga, and Western Samoa. In July 2010, the ship was involved in the US Navy&#x27;s Pacific Partnership humanitarian assistance operation, providing over-the-shore support and acting as a forward base for medical and dental personnel during visits to Indonesia and Timor Leste. In October 2013, &quot;Labuan&quot; participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney.

&quot;Labuan&quot; visited Ballina in August 2014, during the ship&#x27;s final cruise before decommissioning. After participating in Exercise Croix Du Sud off New Caledonia, &quot;Labuan&quot; and &quot;Tarakan&quot; delivered humanitarian supplies to remote coastal settlements in the Solomon Islands in September 2014 as part of Australian support efforts in the region.

&quot;Labuan&quot;, along with &quot;Brunei&quot; and &quot;Tarakan&quot;, were decommissioned on 20 November 2014. The ship&#x27;s bell and ceremonial life ring are to be put on display at the Ballina Naval and Maritime Museum.

In 2013, the Australian government had promised to gift one of the &quot;Balikpapan&quot;-class vessels due to leave RAN service to Papua New Guinea. To this end, &quot;Labuan&quot; was sailed to Port Moresby by a combined RAN and PNGDF complement, and was commissioned into the PNGDF Maritime Operations Element on 4 December 2014. The ship&#x27;s new name comes from the Lakekamu River, in Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Gulf Province.

HMPGS &quot;Lakekamu&quot; is used as a training ship. As part of Australia&#x27;s assistance to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, the Royal Australian Navy provides her commanding officer and a chief of the boat.

<text>Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus (4 May 1772 – 20 August 1823) was a German encyclopedia publisher and editor, famed for publishing the &quot;Conversations-Lexikon&quot;, which is now published as the Brockhaus encyclopedia.

==Biography==
Brockhaus was educated at the gymnasium of his native Dortmund, and from 1788 to 1793 served an apprenticeship in a mercantile house at Düsseldorf. He then devoted two years at the University of Leipzig to the study of modern languages and literature, after which he set up in Dortmund an emporium for English goods. In 1801, he transferred this business to Arnheim, and in the following year to Amsterdam.

In 1805, having given up his first line of trade, Brockhaus began business as a publisher. Two journals projected by him were not allowed by the government to survive for any length of time, and in 1810 the complications in the affairs of Holland induced him to return homewards. In 1811 he settled at Altenburg. About three years previously he had purchased the copyright of the bankrupt &quot;Conversations-Lexikon&quot;, an encyclopedia started in 1796, and in 1810-1811 he completed the first edition of this celebrated work. It was widely imitated as a model for encyclopedias, and is still published today, known as the &quot;Brockhaus Encyclopedia&quot;.

A second edition under Brockhaus&#x27;s editorship was begun in 1812, and was received with universal favour. His business extended rapidly, and in 1818 Brockhaus moved to Leipzig, where he established a large printing-house. Among the more extensive of his many literary undertakings were the critical periodicals — &quot;Hermes&quot;, the &quot;Literarisches Konversationsblatt&quot; (afterwards the &quot;Blätter für literarische Unterhaltung&quot;) and the &quot;Zeitgenossen&quot;, and some large historical and bibliographical works, such as Friedrich Ludwig Georg von Raumer&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte der Hohenstaufen&quot;, and Friedrich Adolf Ebert&#x27;s &quot;Allgemeines bibliographisches Lexikon&quot;.

Brockhaus died in Leipzig. The business was carried on by his sons, Friedrich Brockhaus (1800–1865), who retired in 1850, and Heinrich Brockhaus (1804–1874), under whom it was considerably extended. Heinrich especially rendered great services to literature and science, which the University of Jena recognized by making him, in 1858, honorary Doctor of Philosophy. In the years 1842–1848, Heinrich Brockhaus was member of the Saxon second chamber, as representative for Leipzig, was made honorary citizen of that city in 1872, and died there on 15 November 1874.

His firm continues under the name F. A. Brockhaus AG in his honor. He is also the eponym of 27765 Brockhaus, a main-belt asteroid discovered in 1991.

<text>Chilognatha is a subclass of the class Diplopoda, which includes the vast majority of extant millipedes, about 12,000 species.

==Taxonomy==
The classification of Chilognatha presented below is based on Shear, 2011, and Shear &amp; Edgecombe, 2010 (extinct groups). Recent cladistic and molecular studies have challenged the traditional classification schemes above, and in particular the position of the orders Siphoniulida and Polyzoniida is not yet well established. The placement and positions of extinct groups (†) known only from fossils is tentative and not fully resolved. After each name is listed the author citation: the name of the person who coined the name or defined the group, even if not at the current rank.

<doc id="472700" wikidata="Q7455403" url="?curid=472700" title="Serre's multiplicity conjectures">
<text>In mathematics, Serre&#x27;s multiplicity conjectures, named after Jean-Pierre Serre, are certain problems in commutative algebra, motivated by the needs of algebraic geometry. Since André Weil&#x27;s initial definition of intersection numbers, around 1949, there had been a question of how to provide a more flexible and computable theory, which Serre sought to address. In 1958, Serre realized that classical algebraic-geometric ideas of multiplicity could be generalized using the concepts of homological algebra.

Let &quot;R&quot; be a Noetherian, commutative, regular local ring and let &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; be prime ideals of &quot;R&quot;. Serre defined the intersection multiplicity of &quot;R&quot;/&quot;P&quot; and &quot;R&quot;/&quot;Q&quot; by means of their Tor functors. Below, formula_1 denotes the length of the module formula_2, and we assume for the remainder of the article that 

:formula_3

Serre defined the intersection multiplicity of &quot;R&quot;/&quot;P&quot; and &quot;R&quot;/&quot;Q&quot; by the Euler characteristic-like formula:

:formula_4

In order for this definition to provide a good generalization of the classical intersection multiplicity, one would want that certain classical relationships would continue to hold. Serre singled out four important properties, which became the multiplicity conjectures, and are challenging to prove in the general case. (The statements of these conjectures can be generalized so that &quot;R&quot;/&quot;P&quot; and &quot;R&quot;/&quot;Q&quot; are replaced by arbitrary finitely generated modules: see Serre&#x27;s &quot;Local Algebra&quot; for more details.)

==Dimension inequality==
: formula_5

Serre proved this for all regular local rings. He established the following three properties when &quot;R&quot; is either of equal characteristic or of mixed characteristic and unramified (which in this case means that characteristic of the residue field is not an element of the square of the maximal ideal of the local ring), and conjectured that they hold in general.

==Nonnegativity==

: formula_6

This was proven by Ofer Gabber in 1995.

==Vanishing==

If

: formula_7

then

: formula_8

This was proven in 1985 by Paul C. Roberts, and independently by Henri Gillet and Christophe Soulé.

==Positivity==

If

: formula_9

then

: formula_10

This remains open.

<text>HMS &quot;Kelvin&quot; was a K-class destroyer of the Royal Navy laid down by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Limited, at Govan in Scotland on 5 October 1937, launched on 19 January 1939 and commissioned on 27 November 1939 with the pennant number F37.

==Service history==

&quot;Kelvin&quot; fought in several theatres during the Second World War. In September 1940, as part of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla she scuttled , which had struck a mine off Texel during the Texel Disaster. In October, she was part of the escort for the battleship when she shelled Cherbourg.

Under Admiral James Somerville, she was involved at the action off Cape Spartivento on 27 November 1940, and for the next two years she was busy in the Mediterranean Sea, being involved in many engagements.

In May 1941, she bombarded Benghazi in company with the destroyers , , and before heading to Crete on 20 May 1941. She survived the withdrawal with comparatively light casualties, but required repairs and was sent to Bombay during which time her crew had sufficient time to tour India as far north as the Khyber Pass. By March 1942 she was back in the Mediterranean escorting convoy MW10 which took part in the Second Battle of Sirte. Later in the year she was involved in diversionary attacks in support of Operation Pedestal and bombarded Rhodes.
On 16 April 1942, &quot;Kelvin&quot; landed troops from the 11th Battalion of the Royal Marines at Koufonisi near Crete to destroy a W/T station (Operation Lighter). In December, in company with , and , she sank the off Kerkennah Bank, Tunisia.

In January 1943, she bombarded Zuwara and in company with was responsible for sinking a variety of Italian supply ships and minesweepers. Then along with &quot;Javelin&quot;, &quot;Kelvin&quot; destroyed an Italian convoy on the night of 19 January 1943. Several members of her crew were decorated for their part in destroying enemy ships and aircraft in the Mediterranean.

She returned to the UK for refit in Chatham in July 1943, recommissioning in March 1944. In June 1944 she carried Winston Churchill and various other dignitaries across the English Channel during Operation Overlord. She returned to the Mediterranean and took part in operations to liberate the Dodecanese. She bombarded Tilos and landed a party of Special Boat Service troops in November 1944.

==Post-war fate==
Unlike many of the other J-, K- and N-class destroyers, &quot;Kelvin&quot; survived the war and was sold for scrap on 6 April 1949 and broken up at Troon in Scotland.

<doc id="472715" wikidata="Q1136699" url="?curid=472715" title="Tang-class submarine">
<text>The &quot;Tang&quot;-class submarines were the first submarines designed (under project SCB 2) and built by the United States Navy after World War II. They incorporated the best features of the high-speed German Type XXI U-boat and the venerable U.S. Navy fleet submarine. The &quot;Tang&quot; class, with the fleet submarines converted under the Greater Underwater Propulsion Power (GUPPY) program, had much higher submerged performance than their predecessors, but were quickly surpassed by the nuclear-propelled submarines that entered service beginning in 1954. Six units in total were built.

==Design==
Probably the most important innovation of the &quot;Tang&quot;s, and their primary advantage over contemporary GUPPY conversions, was an increase in test depth from to , achieved with the same High Tensile Steel (HTS; yield strength) as the &quot;Balao&quot; and &quot;Tench&quot; classes. This allowed the class to take advantage of deeper ocean conditions to evade sonar, as well as maneuver more safely at moderate depths.

An unsuccessful innovation of the &quot;Tang&quot; design was the General Motors EMD 16-338 lightweight, compact, high-speed &quot;pancake&quot; engine, rated at 1,000 bhp. Very different from the classic diesel engines that nearly all preceding submarines used, which were laid out with a horizontal crankshaft, this new engine had a vertical crankshaft, and the cylinders were arranged radially like an aircraft engine. Four of these , , eight-ton engines could be installed in a single engine room, thus deleting an entire compartment from the submarine&#x27;s design. The goal was to reduce overall length, as testing had shown that shorter submarines were more maneuverable, especially in depth, and had less submerged drag. Four compact Guppy-type 126-cell lead–acid batteries were installed to provide a high sustained submerged speed. The overall design allowed for a top speed and possible future propulsion replacement with a Type XVII U-boat-derived hydrogen peroxide turbine, closed-cycle diesel system, or even a nuclear power plant. However, attempts to develop the first two systems were unsuccessful, and nuclear power plants proved too large to be accommodated in the &quot;Tang&quot;-class hull.

When the boats went to sea in the early 1950s, the new engines did not work well. Their compact, high-speed design made them difficult to maintain, and they tended to leak oil into their generators. In 1956, the Navy decided to replace the pancake engines with three ten-cylinder Fairbanks-Morse opposed-piston 38D 8-1/8 diesels. These were similar to those of late-war World War II boats, but uprated from to each. To accommodate the larger engines, the boats had to be lengthened some nine feet in the engine room (three additional frames between frames 69 and 70). Accordingly, in 1957 and 1958, the first four &quot;Tang&quot;s were lengthened, while &quot;Gudgeon&quot; and &quot;Harder&quot;, still on the ways, were built to the new length with the new engines. This propulsion plant was used for almost all subsequent US conventional submarines.

The torpedo tubes were also redesigned. The six forward tubes now used air-powered piston ejection pumps, which forced a slug of water through a slide valve behind the torpedo to push it out, rather than the pulse of air used in previous designs. Because this design is somewhat quieter and does not release an air bubble every time a torpedo is fired, it has been used in all subsequent submarine designs throughout the world. The four stern tubes of previous classes were reduced to two shorter, simpler tubes that could not accommodate the longer anti-ship torpedoes and had no capability to actively eject torpedoes. Rather, they were designed for the Mark 27 and planned Mark 37 swim-out torpedoes.
==Boats in class==
In October 1946, the first two boats were ordered. was built at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard; at the Electric Boat yard in Groton, Connecticut. In 1947, contracts were awarded to Portsmouth for and to Electric Boat for . Then in 1948, a similar pair of contracts were awarded to Portsmouth for and to Electric Boat for . They are named for six US submarines lost during World War II, of which most of their commanding officers were killed in action while combating Japanese surface vessels.

In 1967, &quot;Tang&quot;, &quot;Wahoo&quot;, &quot;Gudgeon&quot;, and &quot;Harder&quot; received an additional 15-foot () section (five additional frames between frames 42 and 43) to accommodate the BQG-4 Passive Underwater Fire Control Feasibility System (PUFFS) passive ranging sonar installation, with three tall domes added topside, and additional fire control equipment that enabled the use of the Mark 45 nuclear torpedo. This left the boats similar in size and capability to the GUPPY III conversions.

==Museum ships==
Two boats of this class, TCG &quot;Pirireis&quot; (ex-&quot;Tang&quot;) and TCG &quot;Hizirreis&quot; (ex-&quot;Gudgeon&quot;), are preserved as museum ships in Turkey. &quot;Pirireis&quot; is at the İnciraltı Sea Museum in İzmir, and &quot;Hizirreis&quot; is at the Kocaeli Museum Ships Command in Izmit.

<text>HMS &quot;Kingston&quot; was a K-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s.

==The early years==
&quot;Kingston&quot; was laid down by J. Samuel White and Company at Cowes on the Isle of Wight on 6 October 1937 as part of an order for six similar destroyers. She was launched at East Cowes on 9 January 1939 and named by the Mayoress of Kingston upon Thames. Commissioned on 14 September 1939 with the pennant number F64, she joined the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, Home Fleet, for convoy defence and anti-submarine duties in the North Sea.

In company with the destroyers and , &quot;Kingston&quot; attacked with depth charges in the North Sea off Shetland on 29 November 1939, and forced her to scuttle. All the crew of the U-boat were rescued and taken prisoner.

==Red Sea operations==
In May 1940 she was transferred to the Red Sea. Her pennant number for visual signalling purposes was changed to G64. In June she took part in the sinking of the off Perim Island, and later attacked the . On 17 March 1941 she supported landings at Berbera, British Somaliland. On 5 April &quot;Kingston&quot; found the s and aground south of Jeddah whose hulls, having been scuttled by the Italians, were destroyed by gunfire and air attack.

==Force C and the battles of Sirte==
In April 1941 &quot;Kingston&quot; was deployed to Alexandria to join the Eastern Mediterranean Fleet. There, she was involved in the evacuation of Allied troops from mainland Greece to Crete. On 20 May she deployed as part of Force C to the Battle of Crete.

On the night of 21 May 1941 Force C intercepted a convoy of 20 troop carrying caiques escorted by the heading for Crete. Ten of the caiques were sunk and the landing prevented, but &quot;Lupo&quot; successfully covered the withdrawal of the remainder of the convoy. Cruiser was damaged in the action.

On 22 May 1941 Force C was sent to the Aegean Sea through the Kasos Strait to intercept a further invasion convoy of 30 caiques, escorted by the . One detached caique was sunk and, although the British did not press the attack on the main convoy, the Germans were forced to abort their attempt to reach Crete. Nonetheless, &quot;Sagittario&quot; covered the convoy&#x27;s retreat by lying a smoke screen and firing her guns and torpedoes at the British squadron. According to British sources, &quot;Kingston&quot; suffered no damage from the naval engagement but splinter damage was reported from German air attacks. Force C was the target of fierce airstrikes which continued when they joined up with Force A1 at the Kithera channel. &quot;Kingston&quot; and were sent to pick up survivors when the destroyer was bombed and sunk. Later the same day the cruisers and were also lost to air attacks. On 23 May &quot;Kingston&quot; and &quot;Kandahar&quot; returned and rescued 523 survivors.

She returned to Alexandria on 24 May 1941, and was taken in hand for repairs and modifications, among which was the replacement of the aft set of torpedo tubes with a four-inch anti-aircraft gun in recognition of the devastating effect of the air attacks suffered by Force C.

&quot;Kingston&quot; was engaged in defensive convoy duties to Tobruk and often as part of the escort for &quot;Breconshire&quot; on runs to Malta. She was also in action against Axis convoys and against the Vichy French in Syria.
On 17 December 1941 she took part in a brief engagement with the Italian Fleet, known as the First Battle of Sirte.

On 22 March 1942 &quot;Kingston&quot; took part of the escort of convoy MW10 in the Second Battle of Sirte, where, as the destroyers turned to fire their torpedoes on the Italian battle fleet, she was hit by a 15-inch shell fired by the which passed right through the foremost starboard whaleboat and burst under the anti-aircraft guns mounting, leaving a big hole in the deck; despite this, she launched three torpedoes. Fifteen men of her crew were killed in this incident, which left the destroyer temporarily dead in the water, the whaleboat torn to pieces, her anti-aircraft guns, searchlight tower and torpedo launchers smashed by the explosion, her starboard boiler and port engine out of action. According to some authors, like James Sadkovich and Vincent O&#x27;Hara, she was instead struck by an 8-inch round from the heavy cruiser . Maurizio Brescia instead credits the heavy cruiser with the hit. With an engine in flames and a flooded boiler, she managed to recover her speed with the remaining engine, reaching Malta the next day.

==Air raids and loss==
On 4 April 1942, whilst the destroyer was in dock at Malta repairing the damage from the naval encounter, a bomb fell directly at the entrance of the Corradino tunnel, where part of her crew had taken shelter. Fourteen crewmen were killed by the blast including Commander Philip Somerville DSO., Lieutenant P. Hague, and Yeoman of Signals John Murphy, who was at their side, whilst directing the men into the safety of the Corradino tunnel. All 14 crewmen are buried at either the Mtarfa Military Cemetery or the Capuccini Naval Cemetery. Approximately 35 dock workers were also wounded.

&quot;Kingston&quot; was attacked by German aircraft on 5 April and was further damaged by a near miss. On 8 April she was hit by a bomb, forward. This penetrated the decks and passed out of the ships bottom without exploding. But now the destroyer needed to go into dry dock for underwater repairs. On 9 April she was placed in No. 4 dock, but remained afloat. By 11 April she was still afloat in the dock. – perhaps plates bent outwards by the passage of the bomb through the bottom made it impossible to dock-down and these plates were being burnt away by divers. At about 17.30 on 11 April 1942 she was hit on the port side amidships in the area of the bulkhead between the engine-room and the gearing-room by Junkers Ju 87 aircraft from Sturzkampfgeschwader 3. She rolled over on her port side and sank in the dock. The ship was declared a constructive total loss. On 21 January 1943 the No. 4 dock was dried-out. The damaged midships part of the destroyer was scrapped, thus separating the destroyer in two sections. Dummy bulkheads were fitted to make the two sections float-able while an amount of the superstructure was burnt away. The two sections of &quot;Kingston&quot; were floated out of the dock on 5 April 1943 and in June were scuttled as a blockship between the Selmun headland and Selmunett Island (St Paul&#x27;s Island) in northern Malta in the preparations for making a safe anchorage before the invasion of Sicily. In the early 1950s the two sections of the &quot;Kingston&quot; were scrapped, where sunk, by Italian shipbreakers.

<text>The Williamsburg Bridge is a suspension bridge across the East River in New York City, connecting the Lower East Side of Manhattan with the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. Originally known as the East River Bridge, the Williamsburg Bridge was completed in 1903 and, at long, was the longest suspension bridge span in the world until 1924.

Proposed in January 1892, the bridge project was approved in 1895. Work began on June 19, 1896, under chief engineer Leffert L. Buck. Despite delays and funding shortfalls, the bridge opened on December 19, 1903. In addition to roads, walkways, and New York City Subway tracks, the bridge had four trolley tracks, which were replaced with roads in 1936 and 1949. The bridge underwent a substantial renovation in the 1980s and 1990s following the discovery of severe structural defects, and it was again being renovated in the 2020s.

The Williamsburg Bridge&#x27;s main span is long and is carried on four main cables, which are suspended from two towers. Unlike similar suspension bridges, the side spans are supported by trusswork and additional towers. The deck carries eight lanes of vehicular traffic, two subway tracks, and two walkway and bike paths that merge in Manhattan. The bridge is one of four vehicular bridges directly connecting Manhattan Island and Long Island, along with the Queensboro Bridge to the north and the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges to the south. The bridge also serves as a connector highway to and from the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (I-278) in Brooklyn.

== Development ==

=== Planning ===
Legislation to incorporate the East River Bridge Company was introduced in the New York State Legislature in January 1892. The company wished to build a suspension bridge across the East River from Manhattan, within New York City, to the then-separate city of Brooklyn. The company was incorporated on March 9, 1892. The East River Bridge Company, led by Frederick Uhlmann, was authorized to construct two bridges from Manhattan to Brooklyn, one of which would run to Broadway in the Eastern District of Brooklyn (later known as Williamsburg). The United States Secretary of War approved the span to Williamsburg in January 1893 under the condition that the bridge be at least high at its center.

The East River Bridge Company&#x27;s capital stock was set at $2 million in mid-1893, and three men were appointed as bridge commissioners. An elevated rapid transit line on the bridge was approved in September. The commissioners submitted a report on the planned bridge to the New York Supreme Court in October, but the Supreme Court ruled in January 1894 that the $2 million in capital stock was not sufficient to fund the bridge&#x27;s construction. The East River Bridge Company dug a hole for one of the bridge&#x27;s piers in Brooklyn on February 15, 1894, to prevent the company&#x27;s charter from expiring. The New York Court of Appeals, the state&#x27;s high court, upheld the Supreme Court ruling October. The company&#x27;s directors held a meeting that November to devise a timeline for the bridge&#x27;s construction. Concurrently, a London-based firm offered to finance the bridge, and the company moved to condemn a property in the path of the bridge&#x27;s Manhattan approach.

In March 1895, Charles A. Schieren, mayor of Brooklyn, requested that his corporation council draft a bill for the East River Bridge between Broadway in Brooklyn and Grand Street in Manhattan. The same month, the State Legislature considered a bill to terminate the East River Bridge Company&#x27;s charter. Schieren and New York City mayor William L. Strong agreed in April to jointly fund the bridge and appoint a group of commissioners. Schieren appointed three commissioners that June, and the commissioners proposed hiring an engineer and issuing bonds the next month. Uhlmann proposed turning over his company&#x27;s assets to the commissioners, who initially rejected his offer. The commission decided to buy Uhlmann&#x27;s charter in December 1895. A State Supreme Court justice issued an injunction against this purchase in March 1896; this decision was reversed on appeal, and another Supreme Court justice ratified this purchase that June.

=== Initial construction ===

==== Borings and land negotiations ====

Leffert L. Buck was hired as the East River Bridge&#x27;s chief engineer at the beginning of August 1895. The next month, a contractor was hired to create five preliminary borings for the bridge. Early the next year, the mayors of Brooklyn and New York City agreed to appropriate $250,000 each for the bridge&#x27;s construction. Buck presented revised plans for the East River Bridge in February 1896, lowering its maximum height to . The revisions were approved by the War Department and the New York Harbor Line Board shortly thereafter, and the commissioners decided to issue $1 million in bonds to fund construction. In March, the East River Bridge Commission requested bids for the excavation of holes for the bridge&#x27;s caissons. As workers excavated the holes, Buck prepared plans for the bridge&#x27;s anchorages and piers.

As late as June 1896, the commissioners considered placing the bridge&#x27;s Manhattan terminus at Grand Street. That month, the commissioners decided to move the bridge&#x27;s Manhattan terminus to Delancey and Clinton streets to avoid the narrowness of Grand Street. In Brooklyn, the approach was straightened to avoid the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Building. Work on the bridge commenced in earnest on June 19, 1896, when contractors began excavating holes for the towers&#x27; foundations in the East River. The final plans were adopted on July 22, allowing the commissioners to request bids for construction contracts. Buck&#x27;s plans were adopted that August. By September 1896, the bridge&#x27;s completion had been delayed by one year due to a lack of money. The Brooklyn government and the New York City government both attempted to sell bonds to little avail.

As part of the Williamsburg Bridge&#x27;s construction, a strip of land next to Delancey Street was to be condemned. This strip included St. Rose of Lima Church, several schools, and Dutch row houses. The bridge commissioners took over a ferry slip at the end of Delancey Street that had belonged to the Brooklyn and New York Ferry Company in October 1896. In Williamsburg, the bridge commissioners considered either closing or widening South 5th Street. The commissioners negotiated with the American Sugar Refining Company to acquire the latter&#x27;s land on the Brooklyn shoreline; the commissioners offered the company $350,000 in late 1896, but the firm refused to sell. Negotiations for the land in Brooklyn were still ongoing, complicated by that city&#x27;s lack of money.

==== Caisson and anchorage contracts ====
The commissioners requested bids for the caissons in October 1896, and Patrick H. Flynn received the contract for the caissons the same month. Flynn obtained land at North 2nd Street in Brooklyn soon afterward and manufactured his caissons at a shipyard there. Caisson workers toiled in three eight-hour shifts of 30 to 50 men each. After the caissons were complete, they were floated to either side of the river. During February 1897, the bridge commissioners took over the land at the end of Delancey Street. New York governor Frank S. Black signed two bills in May 1897, which allowed the bridge commissioners to lease space under the approaches and close part of South 5th Street for the bridge&#x27;s Brooklyn approach. The first caisson was completed the same month and towed to Delancey Street in Manhattan on May 15. The contract for the Brooklyn suspension tower&#x27;s foundation was put up for bidding the following day. A cofferdam was built around each caisson to prevent them from being flooded, and workers excavated dirt for the foundations from within the caissons. Colin McLean was hired to build the Brooklyn suspension tower&#x27;s foundations in June, and the last of the bridge&#x27;s four caissons was launched in December 1897.

The state legislature passed a bill in May 1897 to straighten the bridge&#x27;s Brooklyn approach. The East River Bridge Commission paid the American Sugar Refining Company $350,000 for their land in July. The next month, the mayors of Brooklyn and New York City sued several property owners whose land was in the path of the bridge&#x27;s approaches, and a judge ruled that one Brooklyn landowner who had refused to sell had to give up their land. The commissioners began soliciting bids for the anchorages in September. The Degnon-McLean Construction Company was hired to build the Brooklyn anchorage; a state judge refused to re-award the contract to a competing bidder. Shanly &amp; Ryan, who had been hired to build the Manhattan anchorage, began constructing their anchorage that October. The next month, the bridge commissioners obtained underwater land on the Brooklyn side for the bridge&#x27;s abutments.

=== Progress between 1898 and 1901 ===
By the end of 1897, Brooklyn and Manhattan were about to be merged into the City of Greater New York. The first mayor of the unified city, Robert Anderson Van Wyck, removed the existing bridge commissioners in January 1898, citing extravagance and delays; he appointed six new commissioners. The old commissioners&#x27; removal prompted state legislation for their reinstatement and a lawsuit against the New York City government. A New York Supreme Court justice ruled in June that the old commissioners had to be reinstated, although the decision was overturned on appeal the following month. A state senator proposed a bipartisan state commission in January 1899 to oversee the bridge&#x27;s construction, but the bill was rejected. The state&#x27;s high court, the New York Court of Appeals, ruled against the original commissioners in February 1899. Following the passage of further legislation in 1901, the East River Bridge commissioners were replaced with the city&#x27;s Commissioner of Bridges effective January 1, 1902.

There had been several deaths during construction, with the first fatal accident in December 1897. Another worker was killed by a derrick&#x27;s boom in 1898; two workers were killed in separate falls from the bridge in May 1900; the main steelwork engineer died after falling from the Brooklyn approach in September 1900; and a foreman drowned in March 1902.

==== Financial shortfalls ====
The commissioners had planned to award a contract for the suspension towers in February 1898, but this was delayed because of the commission&#x27;s financial shortfalls. Although the commission was promised $500,000 at the beginning of that March, it had less than $1,000 in its bank account and needed $4.14 million to award contracts and pay debts. By April 1898, work was progressing on the anchorages and the piers above each caisson, but the commission had so little money that it could not pay commissioners&#x27; salaries or even the rent for its headquarters. Work on the anchorages was also delayed by labor strikes and stormy weather. The commissioners finally received $200,000 that May to pay off existing debts, but the city had yet to issue $4 million in bonds for the bridge&#x27;s continued construction. The Board of Estimate approved $2.487 million in bonds in July 1898, which was used to pay for the anchorages and foundations. The commission still needed another $640,000 to compensate landowners; the design was nearly completed at this point.

The bridge commission again met in August 1898 to decide whether to solicit bids for the towers and decks. That September, workers complained that they were not being paid; by then, the foundations were near completion. The commission received $2 million the same month, enough to pay off debts through the end of the year. The bridge commission would still be $500,000 in debt at the beginning of 1899, and contracts for the side spans had not even been awarded. A continued lack of funds slowed down construction on the bridge during most of 1899. The Board of Estimate approved $1.5 million in bonds for the towers and side spans in January 1899; it also approved $500,000 in bonds that May for land acquisition and $4 million for cables and land acquisition in July, though the New York City Council delayed a vote on the latter issue, which Van Wyck could not approve until December. Buck estimated that the funding delays had pushed construction back by two and a half years.

==== Tower, deck, and cable contracts ====
In February 1899, the New Jersey Steel and Iron Company received a $1,220,230 contract to build the towers and side spans; the contract was nearly twice the $620,000 cost estimate. A granite cutters&#x27; strike the next month slowed progress on the anchorages briefly. By late 1899, falsework was being installed in advance of the suspension towers&#x27; construction. That November, the bridge commissioners began requesting bids for the construction of the cables. Washington Roebling, the sole bidder, received the cable contract in December 1899 for $1.4 million, nearly $600,000 more than the bridge commission&#x27;s original estimate. The pier foundations and anchorages were almost complete by the beginning of 1900. The foundation of the Brooklyn suspension tower was finished that February, while the Manhattan tower&#x27;s foundations were still under construction. Workers used derricks to erect the pieces of the suspension towers, which measured . Because of the extreme heights of each tower, one reporter for the &quot;Buffalo Courier-Express&quot; described the workers as &quot;giving daily performances of a most daring character&quot;, while a reporter for the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; described the workers as performing &quot;daily circus feats&quot;.

The suspension towers on either side of the river were half complete by May 1900, but work was delayed later that year by an ironworkers&#x27; strike. The cable contract was &quot;well under way&quot; by that November, and workers began planning four temporary footbridges to help them construct the main cables. The cable saddles on the tops of the towers were completed the next month. The Carbon Steel Company received a contract in January 1901 for of steel wire. The wires were manufactured in pieces measuring long and weighing . The first wires were ready to be installed by February 1901, after the wooden falsework had been disassembled. Work on temporary cables for the footbridges began in April and was completed within a month. The first footbridge was completed in June and was quickly followed by the footbridges for the three other cables.

By mid-1901, workers were ready to weave wires for the main cables, and the Roebling Company had received of wire. A machine was placed on the Manhattan anchorage to weave the wires. The Roeblings also ordered eight guide wires for the wheels that would carry the main cables&#x27; wires across the river. The first wire was strung across the East River on November 27, 1901. The Roeblings requested ten months to finish the wires, but city bridge commissioner Gustav Lindenthal refused to extend the deadline past April 1902. Work on each of the four cables proceeded simultaneously. Workers were able to string 50 wires in each strand during a 10-hour workday, or 400 wires per day in total. After each strand was completed, it was permanently attached to the eyebars in either anchorage. To save money, the wires were covered with oil and graphite, rather than galvanized; the Roebling Company was hesitant to use ungalvanized wire, but city officials claimed that the oil and graphite mix was adequate.

The last major contract for the bridge was for the central span&#x27;s deck. The bridge commissioners solicited bids for the deck in April 1901, and the Pennsylvania Steel Company submitted the lowest bid. Though a local resident sued to stop Pennsylvania Steel from receiving the contract, the city allowed the firm to sublease the work to the United Engineering and Construction Company.

==== Approach contracts and plans ====
The bridge commissioners were authorized to finalize the purchase of land for the Brooklyn approach in December 1899, but it took seven months for the Board of Estimate to approve bonds for the purchase. Buck estimated that it would take four to six months to raze all the buildings in the bridge&#x27;s path. The bridge commissioners began soliciting bids for the approach viaducts in April 1900 and received bids the next month. More property was acquired for the approaches in June, but the viaducts&#x27; construction were delayed because bonds had not been issued and because of disputes over the bids. The commissioners rejected the initial bids for the viaducts and solicited new proposals in July 1900. The following month, a state justice placed an injunction preventing the commissioners from awarding a contract for the viaducts. The injunction was lifted that October, and the Pennsylvania Steel Company received the contract for the viaducts. Van Wyck approved another bond issue of $4 million in November 1900, most of which was to be used to pay the Pennsylvania Steel Company.

For the approaches, the commissioners acquired hundreds of land lots and relocated 10,000 people. Condemnation commissioners were appointed to seize land for the viaducts in both Manhattan and Brooklyn. The Brooklyn commissioners were appointed in November 1900. There were disputes over the qualifications of the Manhattan commissioners, so condemnation in Manhattan did not begin until March 1901. Work on the Brooklyn viaduct began in May 1901, and Pennsylvania Steel began delivering steel for the viaducts that July. The Manhattan viaduct commenced the next month, but a lack of steel delayed further work, and the buildings in Manhattan took longer to demolish than those in Brooklyn. The &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; estimated that it would cost about $10 million to construct of approach viaducts. Although landowners on the Brooklyn side were supposed to have been compensated in 1902, the compensation was delayed by one year.

A street (now Borinquen Place) was planned to run diagonally from the end of the Brooklyn approach viaduct to the intersection of Grand Street and Union Avenue, and the bridge commissioners and local merchants agreed to build the street in 1900. South 5th Street in Brooklyn, which had been replaced by the Brooklyn approach viaduct, was realigned during early 1902. A plaza was also to be created to the east of Driggs Avenue; the city acquired land for the plaza in July 1902. Roebling Street, which led to the bridge&#x27;s Brooklyn plaza, was to be widened. In Manhattan, several competing proposals were put forth for a street connecting to the Manhattan approach viaduct, each of which cost several million dollars. One particularly contentious proposal was for a street running from the intersection of Delancey and Norfolk Street to Cooper Square. In December 1901, the city agreed to widen Delancey Street, build a plaza between Norfolk and Clinton streets, and extend Delancey Street west to Lafayette Street. A smaller plaza in Manhattan was approved between Suffolk and Clinton streets in early 1903, but there were delays in the widening of Delancey Street. To distribute traffic across the Lower East Side, Allen Street was also widened after the bridge was finished.

=== Lindenthal takeover and completion ===
 Gustav Lindenthal took office as the city&#x27;s bridge commissioner on January 1, 1902, and predicted the bridge could be finished within 20 months. The anchorages, towers, and approaches were finished at the time, but the main cables were only one-fifth completed. Edward M. Grout, who became city controller the same year, decided to acquire the remaining land for the bridge via private purchase rather than via condemnation. The East River Bridge was renamed the Williamsburg Bridge in March 1902. Soon after, several engineers working on the bridge resigned, and Lindenthal also asked for Buck&#x27;s resignation. Lindenthal promised to fine the Roeblings $1,000 a day once their contract expired that April. He made his first official visit to the bridge at the beginning of that May, and he agreed to retain Buck as a consulting engineer. Mayor Seth Low visited the bridge in June, and the main cables were completed later that month.

Hornbostel filed modified plans for the piers and anchorages in July and announced that the bridge would be illuminated at night. Railings were being installed on the nearly-complete Brooklyn approach viaduct, workers began installing vertical suspender cables, and the Manhattan viaduct was proceeding slowly due to steel shortages. That September, public hearings on the widening and extension of Delancey Street were held, and Low approved changes of grade for several streets around the bridge&#x27;s approach viaducts. The Roebling Company negotiated a contract with Lindenthal in October to avoid paying a fine for the cables, and they also began wrapping the cables with duck cloth. A judge ruled in 1905 that the city could not penalize the Roeblings for the delays.

Following a fire on the Brooklyn side in November 1902, the cables sustained $50,000 in damage. Work on the cables resumed in mid-December 1902. By the beginning of 1903, the Manhattan approach was still less than half complete; workers were also constructing the main span across the East River, starting at either suspension tower and progressing toward the middle. The same month, the waterproofing of the main cables was finished, and the Municipal Art Commission approved some of Henry Hornbostel&#x27;s proposed decorations for the bridge. After asking Hornbostel to redesign minarets atop the towers, although the revised plans were rejected as too expensive. The Manhattan and Brooklyn halves of the main span were riveted together at the end of February 1903. Contracts for the main span&#x27;s steel underfloor and wood pavements were awarded that June. The Williamsburg Bridge was 98 percent complete as of that month, and the damaged cables were still being repaired, and workers were painting and riveting the bridge and its approach viaducts.

The Board of Estimate appropriated $1.55 million for the bridge at the beginning of July. By then, residents of Williamsburg had expressed concerns that the bridge would not open as scheduled at the end of that year. The next month, Lindenthal requested bids to infill the tops of the anchorages with concrete, and he received bids for the completion of the roadways and the approach viaducts&#x27; decks. Workers also cleared land for the Williamsburg Bridge&#x27;s Brooklyn plaza and began constructing a playground beneath the Brooklyn approach viaduct. Lindenthal requested bids for the footpaths that September. The flooring and pavement of the bridge&#x27;s north roadway was laid first, followed by that of the south roadway. By late October, paving had commenced at the Brooklyn end, and Lindenthal had received bids for the paving of the Brooklyn plaza. Almost everything was complete the following month, aside from paving, some riveting, and anchorage arches. Local civic organizations planned celebrations in advance of the bridge&#x27;s opening. Low inspected the bridge on December 12, a week before its scheduled opening.

== Operational history ==

=== Opening and 1900s ===

The bridge opened on December 19, 1903, with fireworks and parades. The span had cost $11 million ($ million in ). The footpaths and northern roadway were not complete. No streetcar tracks had been laid, and the rapid transit tracks (carrying the New York City Subway) ended in midair on the Manhattan side and could not be used. Both pedestrians and vehicles shared the southern roadway; pedestrians were allowed to use the northern roadway starting January 21, 1904. George B. McClellan Jr., who had become mayor at the beginning of the year, wanted streetcar service across the bridge as soon as possible. The city&#x27;s bridge commissioner received bids for the construction of streetcar tracks that April, and one of the dedicated pedestrian paths opened without ceremony on April 23.

At the end of May, the north roadway formally opened to vehicles, and the bridge&#x27;s lights were turned on for the first time. A street vendors&#x27; market opened under the Manhattan approach in mid-1904, despite opposition from some street vendors. Streetcar service on the bridge commenced November 4, 1904; there were surface-level streetcar terminals at both ends. After streetcar service began on the bridge, the Manhattan end became congested. By 1905, officials planned to build underground terminals for both rapid transit and streetcar lines. Upon the bridge&#x27;s second anniversary in December 1905, the bridge received over $100,000 annually in revenue, but, by the next year, the bridge&#x27;s revenues were almost entirely canceled out by its expenses. In addition, the bridge&#x27;s main span had shifted toward Brooklyn by late 1906, and rapid transit service on the bridge could not run until the misalignment was fixed.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote in 1907 that, even as the rapid transit tracks lay unused, vehicular congestion on the Williamsburg Bridge rivaled that on the Brooklyn Bridge; another critic said that only ten percent of the bridge&#x27;s capacity was actively being used. The underground streetcar terminal in Manhattan opened in May 1908. When rapid transit service began running across the bridge that September, the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; wrote that the bridge&#x27;s capacity had increased by several hundred percent. The opening of the bridge&#x27;s rapid transit tracks had been expected to draw passengers away from the streetcars. The City Club of New York, later that year, requested that engineers inspect the bridge. Engineers were planning to strengthen the bridge by late 1909, amid a sharp increase in traffic; the city&#x27;s bridge commissioners denied that the bridge was unsafe.

=== 1910s and 1920s ===

By 1912, some of the smaller cables in the bridge&#x27;s anchorages had already snapped, as they had not been galvanized during construction. To strengthen the bridge, workers installed new pins to connect the trusses of the approach spans and main span, which was completed in 1914. Workers also added several support towers under either side span. The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) threatened to stop operating streetcars across the bridge in 1915 due to disagreements over streetcar fees. A state judge ruled the next year that the BRT did not have to pay any fees because it also ran rapid transit across the bridge. Through the late 1910s, there were continued disputes over whether streetcar companies should pay to use the bridge. One city official claimed in 1918 that congestion on the Williamsburg Bridge had worsened because the BRT sent streetcars across the bridge without paying any fees.

Plant and Structures commissioner John H. Delaney proposed constructing an extra roadway for motor vehicles in 1919; the southern walkway would have been converted for vehicular use, and all pedestrians would have been required to use the northern walkway. The bridge underwent emergency repairs in mid-1920 following a fire. At the time, commercial vehicles used the north roadway and personal vehicles used the south roadway in both directions. In an attempt to alleviate congestion, during September 1920, the bridge carried westbound traffic only in the morning and eastbound traffic only in the afternoon; it carried traffic in both directions at other times. The next month, mayor John Francis Hylan decreed that all westbound vehicles use the north roadway and all eastbound vehicles use the south roadway. There was an unsuccessful petition in 1921 to rename the bridge after former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt; another effort in 1922 sought to rename the span the Broadway Bridge, after the street at its Brooklyn end. A galvanized sheath was placed around each of the main cables in 1922 to reduce damage, but water in the main cables caused the wires to rust.

In 1925, Plant and Structures commissioner William Wirt Mills announced plans to construct two vehicular roadways on the bridge for $1.5 million. One of the roadways would have replaced the underused streetcar tracks on the north side of the bridge, while the other roadway would have been built above the remaining tracks on the south side. The same year, the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), the BRT&#x27;s successor, announced that it would replace the Williamsburg Bridge&#x27;s subway tracks. The span carried an average of 35,000 vehicles daily by 1926. An engineering report, commissioned for the city government in November 1929, suggested that an overpass be built over Clinton Street in Manhattan, and that trolley tracks on the Brooklyn side be rerouted, to reduce congestion. City alderman Stephen A. Rudd also proposed linking the Brooklyn approach to Bushwick Avenue to alleviate congestion in that borough.

=== 1930s and 1940s ===

The trolley lines on the north side of the Williamsburg Bridge stopped running in January 1932 because the operators could not afford to repair the degraded tracks. City officials immediately announced plans to convert the tracks into an roadway; later that year, workers began strengthening the bridge to accommodate the roadway. The tracks were being removed by 1933, but further progress was delayed because of a labor shortage, and work was halted at one point due to a lack of funds. The work also involved correcting the settlement of seven columns in Manhattan, as well as new recreation areas at the bridge&#x27;s Brooklyn end. Workers also discovered in 1934 that the portions of the cables in the anchorages were leaking. The two additional lanes, forming the northern inner roadway, ultimately cost $400,000 and opened on December 22, 1936, bringing the bridge&#x27;s vehicular capacity to six lanes. The northern inner roadway initially functioned as a reversible traffic lane. By then, the bridge carried up to 50,000 vehicles a day (up from 2,900 daily vehicles in 1904), and other East River bridges were similarly congested.

In June 1938, the Public Works Administration provided a grant to help fund the replacement of the outer roadways, which was to cost $334,000. The pedestrian path was also to be replaced for $200,000. The city&#x27;s Department of Public Works closed the northern outer roadway in April 1939 for reconstruction, and it reopened that June. Work on the southern outer roadway began in September, and that roadway reopened two months later, although workers were still rebuilding the railings on both of the outer roadways. As part of a Works Progress Administration project, the approach viaducts of all three roadways were repaved in concrete in 1941. Workers poured of linseed oil onto the cables during the 1940s in attempts to prevent corrosion.

By 1946, the city government planned to spend $127,000 on structural repairs to the bridge. The southern outer roadway was closed for repairs starting in April 1947, and rollers under the bridge&#x27;s suspension towers were replaced the same year. The south outer roadway was completed in November 1947, and the north outer roadway was closed in February 1948. Meanwhile, the New York City Board of Estimate allocated $2.6 million in the city&#x27;s 1948 capital budget to replace the bridge&#x27;s south-side streetcar tracks with a roadway. All streetcar service ceased in December 1948, and construction on the south inner roadway began immediately after streetcar service ended. The new roadway opened October 31, 1949. In conjunction with these projects, Delancey Street in Manhattan was widened to reduce congestion at the bridge&#x27;s entrance.

=== 1950s to 1970s ===
The Horn Construction Company was hired in late 1949 to construct a short viaduct from the bridge&#x27;s Brooklyn end to the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway. This viaduct was completed in 1952, along with a section of the expressway to the Kosciuszko Bridge. During that decade, the city government employed one man to inspect the bridge regularly for cracks in the steelwork and the roadway. The bridge&#x27;s roadways were repaved, and the structure itself was repainted, starting in late 1961; workers again poured oil treatments on the Williamsburg Bridge&#x27;s cables a few years later. During the 1966 New York City transit strike, four of the lanes were converted to reversible lanes. Inspectors found varying degrees of corrosion under the bridge&#x27;s outer roadways in 1969, and the approach viaducts were again repaved the next year.

An engineering consultant recommended in 1971 that the steelwork for the approaches be repaired. Although the approaches were repainted in 1973, the steelwork was not repaired; the bridge was repainted only haphazardly afterward, even though elements vulnerable to corrosion should have been painted every one or two years. The state government started inspecting the Williamsburg Bridge and five others in 1978; the same year, city controller Harrison J. Goldin said the bridge had structural deterioration. The study found that the bridge&#x27;s main cables were experiencing varying degrees of corrosion, as the anti-rust treatment was actually trapping water in the cables rather than keeping water out. Cracks were also found in the bridge structure, and the bridge was also found to have corroded suspension cables. The city&#x27;s transportation commissioner predicted that large holes would form on the outer roadways by the early 1980s if the bridge were not repaired immediately. By 1980, the bridge was used by about 82,400 vehicles per day, and an engineering study found severe corrosion in some of the bridge&#x27;s supports. The city was planning to repair the four free bridges across the East River, including the Williamsburg Bridge, for a combined $1 billion.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
==== Initial reconstruction and increasing decay ====
In the early 1980s, the city planned to spend $85 million to repair the bridge. One suspension cable had already snapped, while others were rusting; the accumulations of rust on many cables were very hard to remove. The city announced plans to rebuild the outer roadways in early 1981, and mayor Ed Koch provided $4.5 million that May for initial work on the bridge. The North Star Electrical Contracting Corporation was hired to rebuild the outer roadways. The eastbound outer roadway closed that October as part of the project, which was supposed to take 18 months. During that time, all eastbound truck traffic was banned from the bridge. Eastbound trucks were again allowed in July 1982, when the westbound outer roadway was closed. The city government estimated that one out of three suspension cables needed to be replaced. At the end of the year, Congress passed a bill providing $10 million for the replacement of the bridge&#x27;s suspension cables. The reconstruction of the outer roadways was finished in 1983.

To reduce congestion, in the 1980s, the New York City Department of Transportation contemplated converting some lanes to reversible lanes and placing high-occupancy vehicle restrictions on the bridge during rush hours. The Karl Koch Erecting Co. received a $3.2 million contract for further repairs in early 1983, and some of the main span&#x27;s steel was replaced that year. By then, state engineers were considering building an entirely new bridge. The cost of repairs had increased to $200 million because all four main cables likely needed full replacement; the Association for Bridge Construction and Design had listed the Williamsburg Bridge as one of the 15 most deteriorated in the New York City area. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) announced plans in early 1984 to replace the bridge&#x27;s subway tracks. One out of every three suspension cables had been replaced by 1985, even as the bridge remained open. The towers, anchorages, and main cables also had to be replaced, and new stiffening trusses had to be installed. Engineers conducted a stress test in 1984, which indicated that the weight of traffic was stretching the cables by up to . An inspection in 1984–1985, which focused on the cables, rated the bridge&#x27;s structural integrity at 1.6 on a scale of 1 to 7.

By January 1987, engineers had determined that the main cables were only two-thirds as strong as they were supposed to be. Without any repairs to the cables, engineers predicted that the bridge might have to be closed by 1995. The eastbound outer roadway was repaired after two bars fell from the deck in May 1987. At the time, engineers were still drawing up plans for replacing the main cables, and the bridge was also slated for a repainting. Regular inspections of the bridge found that one of the main cables was decaying much more rapidly than the others; in addition, large cracks had formed on approach viaducts. Traffic engineer Sam Schwartz attributed the issues to the bridge&#x27;s lack of galvanization. After the New York State Department of Transportation started examining four alternatives for replacing the bridge entirely, the Federal Highway Administration provided $1 million to allow the state to study the replacement of the cables. Through late 1987, city, state, and federal officials discussed whether to replace or repair the bridge. Engineers conducted another stress test of the bridge that year and found that it might be possible to repair the bridge.

==== Emergency repairs and design work ====
Thirty engineering firms were invited in early 1988 to submit designs for a potential replacement of the span, which by then was carrying 104,000 vehicles and 85,000 subway passengers a day. The bridge was closed to motor and subway traffic on April 12, 1988, after large cracks were found in floor beams and cables. Inspectors discovered that at least 30 support beams were severely corroded; the damage to the beams had not been detected during the 1984–1985 inspection. The businessman Donald Trump offered to fix the span, while U.S. presidential candidate Jesse L. Jackson walked across the bridge shortly after its closure. An inspection found over 400 instances of hazardous conditions on the bridge, mainly on the approach viaducts. The bridge underwent emergency repairs, which included steel supports under the approaches. The bridge partially reopened to cars at the end of May, then to subways that June; all lanes were reopened by July 1988.

After five finalists were selected in an architectural design competition for a new bridge in June 1988, mayor Koch decided the same month to rebuild the bridge instead of replacing it. Part of the $350 million repair cost was to be funded by $30 million from a statewide bond issue that voters approved in November 1988. By early 1989, design work was underway for the deck, cables, and approach viaducts. Nets were also installed under the viaducts to catch falling concrete pieces.

==== 1990s renovations ====
During the 1990s, the bridge underwent a seven-phase renovation that cost $750 million. A joint venture named NAB/Koch was hired in 1990 to install new suspender cables and retrofit ungalvanized wires with rubber sheaths for $95 million. The cast iron stairway on the Manhattan side, and the steep ramp from Driggs Avenue on the Williamsburg side, were replaced to allow handicapped access in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. A decrepit walkway on the Williamsburg Bridge was closed in June 1991, and it reopened as a bike path in March 1992. Cable replacement started in April 1992. A painting crew began sandblasting the bridge in June 1992. This work was halted after Brooklyn residents complained about lead dust, and city officials subsequently found dangerously high levels of lead in soil near the bridge.

The northern roadway was replaced in 1996, followed by the southern roadway. Workers planned to construct a temporary viaduct for subway trains while the southern roadway was being rebuilt, but the NYCDOT decided to close the subway line entirely for five months. The subway tracks along the bridge were closed from April to September 1999. Also in 1999, Gandhi Engineering designed and rebuilt the other pedestrian pathway along the Williamsburg Bridge. The rebuilt walkways carried both pedestrian and bike traffic because the pathways were only wide, and were too narrow to carry segregated traffic. The final two vehicular lanes on the renovated span were reopened in 2002.

=== 21st century ===

A celebration with a parade was held on June 22, 2003, to mark the bridge&#x27;s 100th anniversary. The ornamental lights on the bridge were re-lighted in November of that year after being turned off for eight months due to a lack of funds. The bridge was designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2009. During 2011, the NYCDOT rebuilt the Manhattan end of the bridge with a concrete barrier, despite opposition from cyclists.

In 2016, a local resident launched a campaign to rename the bridge for jazz musician Sonny Rollins, whose 1962 album &quot;The Bridge&quot; was named in its honor. City officials announced in 2017 that the entire bridge would be restricted to high-occupancy vehicles during the daytime, in anticipation of the 14th Street Tunnel shutdown during 2019 and 2020, but these restrictions were canceled after officials announced in 2019 that the 14th Street Tunnel would not shut down completely.

The New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) contracted Skanska to renovate the bridge in November 2022. The project, budgeted at $167 million, was partially funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Work began in late 2022 and is expected to be complete in 2025. The project involved replacing corroded steel beams, pipes, joints, and valves; patching concrete; and repairing the towers.

== Description ==
The bridge, including approaches, is long and wide. The bridge reaches a maximum height of above mean high water at the middle of the river, and the deck is around above mean high water at either shoreline. Leffert L. Buck was the chief engineer, Henry Hornbostel was the architect, and Holton D. Robinson was the assistant engineer. The bridge required an estimated of concrete, of timber, of masonry, and at least of steel. From its opening until the Bear Mountain Bridge opened in 1924, the bridge was the longest suspension bridge span in the world.

The bridge once carried New York State Route 27A. There had been plans to extend Interstate 78 onto the bridge as part of the Lower Manhattan Expressway, which was first proposed in the 1940s. The Lower Manhattan Expressway was approved in 1960 and would have led directly onto the bridge&#x27;s Manhattan approach; the Brooklyn approach would have connected with the Bushwick Expressway, approved in 1954. Both expressways were canceled in 1971, amid extensive local opposition.


=== Deck ===
The deck measures wide. It was originally divided into five sections of roughly equal width. There are two rapid transit tracks at the center, which originally were flanked by two pairs of streetcar tracks (now the inner roadways). The outermost sections of the deck were used as vehicular roadways from the outset, measuring wide. There is also an upper deck used by pedestrian and bicycle traffic. The center suspension span measures long and mostly hangs from cables, as in similar suspension bridges. A section of the center span is cantilevered outward from either tower.

The side spans (also known as the end spans), between the tower and the corresponding anchorage on either side, are supported by their trusswork. This was done to reduce the size, cost, and length of the main cables. Intermediate towers support both of the side spans, in contrast to the Brooklyn Bridge, where the side spans were supported by cables. Each of the intermediate towers is composed of two piers with four columns each; the piers rest on masonry footings, while the tops of the columns support the decks of the side spans.

The deck is placed above transverse floor beams measuring deep and long and spaced at intervals of . Vertical ties connect the transverse floor beams with the trusses, and the floor beams themselves hang from the suspender cables. Two parallel trusses on the deck reduce the loads carried by the floor beams. The trusses are placed apart and measure deep. The trusses were three times as deep as those on the Brooklyn Bridge, since the deck was to carry four times the Brooklyn Bridge&#x27;s loads. The trusswork runs continuously from one anchorage to the other and is not rigidly connected to either the towers or the anchorages. Originally, there were heavy lattice railings on the north and south edges of the deck, while the roadway was paved with wooden blocks.

The approach spans, between the anchorages and either end of the bridge, have a 3 percent grade. They were originally composed of viaducts with braced columns and masonry foundations. The extreme end of either approach span, where the bridge descended to the street, was made of masonry. The approach viaducts were originally paved with granite. There was once a street market under the Manhattan span. In reference to Williamsburg&#x27;s large Yiddish-speaking population, a sign on the westbound approach to the bridge reads, &quot;Leaving Brooklyn: Oy Vey!&quot; Another sign says &quot;Leaving Brooklyn: &quot;. The two signs were proposed by former Brooklyn borough president Marty Markowitz in the early 2000s.

==== Subway tracks ====
In the middle of the deck are the rapid transit (subway) tracks, which connect the New York City Subway&#x27;s Nassau Street Line in Manhattan with the Jamaica Line in Brooklyn. The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) initially proposed extending the tracks on an elevated structure west to Bowery in 1903, but these plans were canceled in 1905. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) also proposed using the tracks in 1905, which would have connected to a subway under Broadway, Sumner Avenue, and Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn. On the Brooklyn side, the city&#x27;s bridge commissioners solicited bids for the connection to the Jamaica Line in early 1907. The tracks were first put into use as part of the BRT&#x27;s Centre Street Loop (now part of the Nassau Street Line), which partially opened on September 16, 1908, with the completion of the underground Essex Street station at the west end of the Williamsburg Bridge.

The subway tracks are laid to standard gauge, and their centers are spaced apart. The subway tracks are generally higher than the roadway, except at the center of the bridge (where they are at the same level) and at the Manhattan end (where the tracks enter a tunnel). As of 2023, the New York City Subway&#x27;s use the bridge&#x27;s tracks at the following times:

In 1995, a fatal collision between a J train and an M train occurred on the bridge&#x27;s tracks; the crash led to widespread changes in the subway&#x27;s signaling system.

==== Streetcar tracks ====

The bridge carried streetcars from November 4, 1904, to December 5, 1948. The streetcar tracks occupied what are now the inner roadways, between the trusses and the rapid transit tracks. When the Williamsburg Bridge was built, streetcar lines from the Eastern District of Brooklyn and the former town of Newtown (now the neighborhoods surrounding Elmhurst in western Queens) converged at the bridge&#x27;s Brooklyn end. The Metropolitan Street Railway, BRT, and Coney Island and Brooklyn Rail Road (CI&amp;B) shared the tracks. Each streetcar track was laid to standard gauge, and the centers of each track were spaced apart. Overhead catenary wires provided electrification for the southern pair of tracks.

BRT and CI&amp;B streetcars originated at various points in Brooklyn and terminated in Manhattan, while Metropolitan streetcars originated at various points in Manhattan and terminated in Brooklyn. The Brooklyn streetcars used two tracks on the south side, and the Manhattan streetcars used two tracks on the north side. After the New York City government took over operation of streetcar lines that used the bridge, the BMT (the BRT&#x27;s successor) did not operate any service across the bridge from 1923 to 1931.

At the Manhattan end of the bridge was the Williamsburg Bridge Trolley Terminal, which opened on May 19, 1908, under the south side of Delancey Street between Clinton and Norfolk streets. At ground level was an additional terminal for through trolley service; the last trolley lines stopped operating through the Manhattan terminal in 1948. At the Brooklyn end is the Williamsburg Bridge Plaza Terminal (also known as Washington Plaza), an at-grade former trolley terminal that has existed since at least 1903. After trolley service was discontinued, the Brooklyn trolley terminal became a bus terminal. The B39 bus, which replaced a trolley line, is the only surface-transit line that continues to use the bridge as of 2023. There was an additional proposal to establish a trolley stop on the bridge above Bedford Avenue in 1901 and again in 1913, but this never occurred.

==== Pedestrian and bicycle paths ====

From the Manhattan end, a shared bike and pedestrian pathway begins in the median of Delancey Street at Clinton Street. The path is split into separate paths for bikes and pedestrians. Between the two anchorages, the pedestrian and bike paths are placed above the inner roadways and are supported by plate steel floor beams. The pathway to the north ends on South 5th Street at Continental Army Plaza, while the pathway to the south ends at Bedford Avenue.

Initially, the northern pathway was supposed to be used by pedestrians and cyclists heading to Manhattan, and the southern pathway was supposed to be used by pedestrians and cyclists heading to Brooklyn. The pathways were connected by an overpass at the center of the main span. On both pathways, pedestrian and bike traffic was separated by an iron railing. The bike paths measured wide, while the pedestrian paths measured wide. By 2002, the bridge had a shared bike and pedestrian path that was only wide. The bridge carried over 6,200 cyclists a day in 2010, making it the busiest bridge for cyclists in New York City at the time; , the bridge carries over 7,800 daily cyclists.

As planned, there were supposed to have been two staircase entrances at Bedford Avenue and one bicycle entrance near Driggs Avenue. A moving walkway was proposed for the bridge in 1902 and approved in 1903.

=== Caissons and towers ===
The suspension tower on each side of the East River is supported by two foundations, which are built to a height of above mean high water. The foundations are placed atop caissons that descend to the underlying layer of gneiss. The centers of each pair of caissons are placed apart. The construction of the caissons required of timber and of steel. The caissons measure wide, long, and high. The caissons in Manhattan are deep, while those on the Brooklyn side are deep. The walls of each caisson are composed of four layers of timber planks and measure thick. At the bottom of each caisson was a chamber measuring high, while at the top were seven access shafts and a set of air locks. Concrete was placed on each caisson&#x27;s roof after it was sunk.

Each foundation supports a masonry pier that rises to above mean high water. The piers are clad with limestone masonry below the mean low water level, and they are clad with granite on a limestone backing above that level. There is a massive dressed-granite block at the corner of each pier, supporting the columns in each leg of the suspension tower. Above each of these granite blocks are heavy steel pedestals, which measure high, at their bases, and at their tops. There are legs on the south and north sides of both suspension towers; each leg comprises four columns that are diagonally braced together. Viewed from above, each leg forms a rectangle measuring west–east and north–south. The lowest portion of each column tapers to a square cross-section measuring , upon which the columns in the leg rise vertically to the bridge&#x27;s deck. Above the bridge&#x27;s deck, the upper sections of the towers&#x27; legs are slanted inward and are stiffened by a pair of trusses measuring high. The tops of each tower are about narrower than at the deck level, and they measure about or above mean high water.

Each tower uses of steel in total. When Buck was designing the bridge, he decided to use steel for the suspension towers, as stone towers would have required larger foundations, taken much longer to build, and necessitated a widening of the bridge. According to the principal assistant engineer, O. F. Nichols, the steel towers could also rise higher than masonry towers and allowed the use of smaller main cables, thereby allowing a stiffer bridge. The &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; wrote that the steel towers would &quot;appear much lighter and, of course, more graceful&quot; than the Brooklyn Bridge&#x27;s masonry towers.

=== Cables ===

==== Main cables ====
The bridge&#x27;s cables carry a dead load of and were designed to carry another of moving traffic. The bridge is built with four main cables, which descend from the tops of the suspension towers and help support the deck. The main cables are grouped in two pairs, one each on the north and south sides of the bridge. At the anchorages on either end, each pair of cables is spaced apart; they narrow to apart at the top of the towers and apart at the middle of the span. The main cables are &quot;cradled&quot; together at the center of the span, which was intended to strengthen the bridge against wind pressure, and are connected to the ends of large plate girders. The main cables each measure between and across. The saddles at the tops of the suspension towers, which are placed over the main cables, each weigh or . The saddles measure across.

Almost of steel wire strands were manufactured for the bridge. Each main cable is composed of 37 strands of 208 wires, amounting to 7,696 wires in each cable. The strands themselves measure in diameter and are hexagonal; the wires are across. The wires were supposed to have a breaking strength of at least . The strands were tied together at intervals of . The ends of each strand were wrapped around a horseshoe-shaped steel casting that in turn was attached to an anchor bar. The main cables were wrapped with duck cloth, which was supposed to make them waterproof, and steel plates were then placed over the duck cloth.

A filling, made of graphite and linseed oil, was poured into the strands themselves and into the air pockets between the strands. This filling was also poured into the saddles and within joints. Although Roebling Company engineers claimed the cables were eight to ten times stronger than those on the Brooklyn Bridge, the filling had weakened the cables by one-third by the late 20th century. When the bridge was being built, there were plans to install incandescent light bulbs along the main cables. The lamps, which were first illuminated in 1904, were powered by a waste incineration plant directly under the Manhattan approach.

==== Suspender cables ====
On the main span, there are suspender castings on the main cables, placed at intervals of . The suspension cables, which hang from the suspension castings, are each composed of seven strands of rope measuring in diameter.

==== Anchorages ====
At either end of the main span are massive masonry anchorages placed or inland of the shore. The anchorage in Manhattan was between Mangin and Tompkins streets, the latter of which was located near what is now FDR Drive, and the anchorage near Brooklyn is between Wythe and Kent avenues. At its base, the Manhattan anchorage measures across, while the Brooklyn anchorage measures across. Each anchorage rises above street level and has a foundation deep. Yellow pine pilings were placed at the bottom of the anchorages&#x27; foundations and were covered with a layer of concrete with embedded timbers. Above were a steel and another layer of concrete, the latter of which contained the &quot;sleeves&quot; at the ends of each main cable. The above-ground sections of the anchorages were clad with masonry.

The anchorages had to be capable of withstanding a total pull of from the four cables. Within each anchorage, the main cables pass through a splay casting, where each of the strands separates. There are two anchor chains at the end of each main cable, each of which are composed of 44 eyebars of varying length. The ends of each strand are attached to the eyebars. The lower sections of the chains are held by plate girders. Each girder measures between approximately deep. Beneath each girder are anchor plates, which weigh ; these plates are used to secure the eyebars at the end of each anchor chain.

===Plazas===

==== Brooklyn side ====

At the foot of the bridge in Williamsburg, between South 5th Street and Havemeyer Street, are three public areas that collectively comprise a plaza alternatively known as the Williamsburg Bridge Plaza, Washington Plaza, or George Washington Monument Park. It contains Continental Army Plaza and two sections of LaGuardia Playground, both operated by the Parks Department.

The plaza is named after the large statue of George Washington in Continental Army Plaza, sculpted by Henry Merwin Shrady The statue, a gift from Kings County register James R. Howe, was dedicated in 1906. A playground between South 4th, South 5th, Roebling, and Havemeyer streets was proposed in 1932 (replacing part of the trolley terminal there) and opened in July 1935 as LaGuardia Playground. Following the construction of LaGuardia Playground, the plot around the Washington statue was renovated into Monument Park, which was dedicated in July 1937. The playground is split into two pieces by the ramp to the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway.

==== Manhattan side ====
At the Manhattan end of the bridge, the walkway terminated at an elevated promenade at Delancey and Clinton streets, which opened in 1914 and measured across. This promenade was above street level.

== Tolls ==

The Williamsburg Bridge was initially a toll bridge, charging the same fees as the Brooklyn Bridge did. In 1911, the city government conducted a study and found that it had no authority to charge tolls on the Queensboro and Manhattan bridges. Tolls on all four bridges across the East River—the Queensboro, Williamsburg, Manhattan, and Brooklyn bridges—were abolished in July 1911 as part of a populist policy initiative headed by New York City mayor William Jay Gaynor.

In 1970, the federal government enacted the Clean Air Act, a series of federal air pollution regulations. As part of a plan by mayor John Lindsay and the federal Environmental Protection Agency, the city government considered implementing tolls on the four free East River bridges, including the Williamsburg Bridge, in the early 1970s. The plan would have raised money for New York City&#x27;s transit system and allowed the city to meet the Clean Air Act. Abraham Beame, who became mayor in 1974, refused to implement the tolls, and the United States Congress subsequently moved to forbid tolls on the free East River bridges. The United States Department of Transportation determined that the Williamsburg Bridge was built partially with federal funds and, under federal law, could not be tolled.

A plan for congestion pricing in New York City was approved in mid-2023, allowing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to toll drivers who enter Manhattan south of 60th Street. Congestion pricing was implemented in January 2025; all Manhattan-bound drivers pay a toll after using the bridge, which varies based on the time of day. Although no toll is charged upon exiting the congestion zone, all Brooklyn-bound drivers must pay a toll to access streets leading to the bridge.

== Impact ==
When the Williamsburg Bridge was under construction, one critic wrote for the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; that the crossing &quot;is to surpass the Brooklyn Bridge as an engineering marvel&quot; and would serve as a model for three other bridges in New York City. The &quot;Brooklyn Citizen&quot; described the Williamsburg Bridge as the eighth wonder of the world just before the span opened. Despite this, the aesthetics of the Williamsburg Bridge were rarely regarded favorably compared to those of the Brooklyn Bridge.

=== Effect on development and infrastructure ===
After the bridge opened, it became easier to access northern Brooklyn from Manhattan than from Downtown Brooklyn. Jewish and Italian immigrants moved to Williamsburg from Manhattan in large numbers following the bridge&#x27;s opening. The bridge in particular helped spur the growth of Williamsburg&#x27;s Jewish community: one newspaper nicknamed the bridge the &quot;Jews&#x27; Highway&quot;. &quot;The American Hebrew &amp; Jewish Messenger&quot; wrote in 1910 that, in part because of the bridge&#x27;s opening, &quot;South Third and neighboring streets [in Williamsburg] are Jewish streets&quot;, and several synagogues had been developed near the Brooklyn end of the bridge.

The bridge&#x27;s completion prompted increased development in Williamsburg, as many residents of Manhattan&#x27;s East Side moved to the neighborhood, and property values around the bridge&#x27;s Brooklyn plaza increased after its opening. On the Lower East Side, the bridge&#x27;s construction led to the development of industrial buildings. After the widening of Delancey Street was completed in conjunction with the bridge&#x27;s opening, new apartment buildings were built around that street over the next two decades. The bridge supplanted five ferry routes between Williamsburg and Manhattan, which had gone out of business by 1908.

=== Media ===
The Williamsburg Bridge has appeared in several media works. The 1928 Edward Hopper painting &quot;From Williamsburg Bridge&quot; depicts a now-demolished building as seen from the bridge&#x27;s walkway. From 1959 to 1961, American jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins would go to the Williamsburg Bridge for practice sessions while living on the Lower East Side of Manhattan; his 1962 album &quot;The Bridge&quot; was titled after the bridge. In 1996, artist Chris Doyle gilded the steps to the pedestrian walkway of the bridge; the project, known as &quot;Commutable&quot;, was sponsored by the Public Art Fund. The bridge appears in the background of the opening sequence of American police sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine, where the cast walks away from the bridge.

<doc id="472723" wikidata="Q7838943" url="?curid=472723" title="Trevelyan College, Durham">
<text>Trevelyan College (known colloquially as Trevs) is a college of Durham University, England. Founded in 1966, the college takes its name from social historian George Macaulay Trevelyan (pronounced &quot;Trevillian&quot;), Chancellor of the university from 1950 to 1957. Originally an all-female college (the last to open in England), the college became fully mixed in 1992.

Trevelyan is noted in Durham for its hexagon-featuring architecture and for the display of daffodils that surrounds it every spring. As a constituent college of Durham University, Trevelyan is listed as a higher education institution under the Education Reform Act 1988. It is owned and for the most part run by the university.

==History==
During the early 1960s, the British Government commissioned the Robbins Report to look into the future of higher education in the UK. When published, the report recommended the expansion of universities and the student population. This was accepted as government policy. In 1963, the University of Newcastle was officially established as a separate entity from the University of Durham, which meant that new colleges within Durham were required in order to meet the number of new university places that the Government wished to create. As a result, the university planned for three new colleges on Elvet Hill; these went on to become Collingwood, Trevelyan and Van Mildert.

===New women&#x27;s college===
Trevelyan was planned to become an all-women college, similar to St Mary&#x27;s and St Aidan&#x27;s, so as to increase the female population of the student body. The college was built on farmland south of St Mary&#x27;s off Elvet Hill Road, which was owned by a local family, the Carpenters. Originally this land was intended to accommodate not only the new college, but also a University Assembly Hall with a capacity of 1,500 persons; however, the site was too small to accommodate both buildings.

After much delay, the college was opened in October 1966 with 78 students. The official opening took place on 12 March 1968 by Lord Butler, Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, who was invited in view of the connection G. M. Trevelyan also held with Trinity. During the opening, a serenade in three movements composed by Sir Malcolm Arnold (whose daughter was in the first intake of students), called &quot;The Trevelyan Suite&quot;, was played. Other people at the opening include the Chancellor, the Vice-Chancellor, two Pro-Vice-Chancellors, the Bishops of Durham and of Ripon (whose wife, Mary Moorman, was a relative of Trevelyan and also present) and the Mayor and Mayoress of Durham. Trevelyan was the last purpose-built all-female college to be built for a British university.

===Since opening===
In 1973, a 300-person capacity hall, the Sir James Knott Hall, (known colloquially as the &quot;JKH&quot;) was opened in the presence of the Duke of Northumberland. The purpose of the hall was to provide more facilities for Trevelyan students, such as a badminton court and extra music rooms, as well as to create a conference facility for the purpose of wealth creation for the college. In 1988 an extension to the hall, the Dowrick Suite, was added, named after a professor of the law department, Frank Dowrick, who was a longtime member of the Senior Common Room. Inside the main college building is the Mowlam Room, a postgraduate common room which previously housed a bust of Mo Mowlam, a well-known Trevs alumna. This bust is currently located in the entrance hall of the college.

In 1981, the bar, which had previously been located within the small area now hosting the buttery was moved to its present location in the former cloisters of the college. In order to make this a practical bar environment the cloisters were roofed over. The area above this new roof is nicknamed &quot;The Goldfish Bowl&quot; by students, due to the proximity of the windows looking into other rooms.

In 1987, the Governing Body of the college voted to follow Hatfield and Castle in becoming mixed-sex, despite 68% of college members voting against such a change. In 1991 a new accommodation block was added to the main building. This block, the K block, is entirely ensuite and now typically reserved for final year and postgraduate students.

The college became fully mixed in 1992. In 1993, and again in 2010, the bar underwent refurbishment. In 2000, a tennis court was added to the grounds at the back of the college. In 2021 Adekunle Adeyeye (College Principal) was reported to have created a culture of bullying, sexism and intimidation of staff 

==Buildings==
The internal construction of Trevelyan is unusual, comprising a string of hexagon-shaped blocks, resulting in most rooms containing unusual angles.

At the opening of the college, its architect John Eastwick-Field said of the design of the college:

The original blocks are labelled &quot;A&quot; to &quot;J&quot;, though there is no I Block to be found and there is also a modern block of ensuite bedrooms, K Block, also called the Macaulay Suite, named after Lord Macaulay, G. M. Trevelyan&#x27;s great-uncle.

The layout features rooms based around staircases, landings and courtyards. The entrance hall is referred to as &quot;the Cobbles&quot;, although said cobbles are no longer there, having been removed during a recent modern refit. A third of the college was fully refurbished in 2005.

Approximately 320 fully catered students can be housed in the building, and around 790 are members of the college, making Trevelyan the third-smallest of Durham&#x27;s seventeen colleges, and the smallest of those maintained by the university council.

The building&#x27;s design has won it a Civic Design Award.

===Facilities===
Trevs has its own comprehensive library, which is open 24 hours a day; music practice room; recording studio; cinema room; computer room; bar; buttery; and fitness suite; it also possesses a chapel, the Barn, which is used for prayer, talks and musical and dramatic rehearsals.

The Undercroft, a relaxing seating area, links the bar with the rear of the college. The college also has a central quad, although it is actually an irregular icosagon, a setting for the college&#x27;s musical events and formal ball. To the rear of the college there are landscaped lawns and a tennis court.

The Sir James Knott Hall, catering for sports, theatrical and conference events is situated just across the college main entrance.

==Student life==
=== Common rooms ===
All members of college are members of a common room. Undergraduates are members of the Junior Common Room (JCR). They may opt out of the common room if they wish, although if they do so they are not allowed to attend JCR events, such as the informal and formal ball, or Formal Hall. The JCR annually elects an executive committee consisting of eleven members as well as an impartial chair. The executive committee ensures the successful running of the JCR, in conjunction with the College Officers. The rules of the JCR are stated in the standing orders, which can only be amended by resolution of the JCR members during general meetings.

Postgraduate and some senior undergraduate students, including mature students, are members of the Middle Common Room (MCR), which hosts its own events and operates similarly to the JCR. The MCR has its own standing orders and executive committee consisting of eleven elected members.

Administrative, academic and other members of college are members of the Senior Common Room (SCR).

===Arts===
The college has a strong history of music, art, and the performing arts. The college has hosted, and continues to host, art viewings both of local and international artists, as well as boasting a large art collection of its own. This collection includes six specially commissioned John Walker paintings which hang in the dining hall. The college hosts at least one musical per year, with recent productions including &quot;Anything Goes&quot; (2012), &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; (2013), &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; (2014), &quot;My Favourite Year&quot; (2015), &quot;Shout!&quot; (2015), &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (2016), &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot; (2016), Guys and Dolls (2017), How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (2018), The Addams Family (2019), Footloose (cancelled in 2020), Legally Blonde (2022), Gypsy (2023). The college has an orchestral society, a chamber choir, a flute choir, a popular music choir, an &quot;a cappella&quot; group, chamber singers and a jazz band; The Manglers, who are regular performers at jazz evenings across the university. The college also has a theatre company, Sixth Side Theatre, which puts on productions several times a year.

===Sport===
The college also has a strong sporting profile, finishing 5th in the college league table in 2008/9. The college has also in recent years been college champions of women&#x27;s hockey, Women&#x27;s astro football, Basketball (both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s) and Badminton, which saw Men&#x27;s A finish the session undefeated. The college cheer team has also found success; winning both All Girl Groups Stunt and Co-Ed Level 2, at the 2019 Intercollegiate Comp. They were also crowned Grand Champions in the same year. Trevelyan College Boat Club is one of the few college rowing teams to qualify for Henley Royal Regatta. The college rugby club made headlines in 2017 after planning to hold a &#x27;Miners versus Thatcher&#x27; social. As a result of the controversy the club was suspended for the remainder of the season.

===Other===
Student societies play an important role in college life, with active Board Games, and LGBT societies. Previously, the college ran a monthly magazine called &quot;Hex&quot; magazine, named in tribute to the college&#x27;s interesting hexagonal shape.

===Traditions===
The college holds Formal Hall once a fortnight, in which students enter the dining hall in their academic gowns, which must remain worn until the end of silent grace. The formal is signalled over when the JCR and MCR presidents bow out formally to the Principal and student body. Traditionally, &quot;spoon banging&quot; (in which student attendees loudly bang their spoons on the table) occurs immediately following the departure of high table.
JCR events are held every year, with an informal ball being held at the end of Michaelmas term, and a summer ball being held after exams in Easter term.
Academic gowns are also worn at university matriculation, at college matriculation and at graduation.

The annual Trevs Day takes place after exams in Easter term, and is a focus of much celebration and revelry for students. Each year it receives a different theme, with recent themes including &#x27;Heroes and Villains&#x27; (2014), &#x27;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&#x27; (2015), &#x27;Rio 2016&#x27; (2016), &#x27;Tropical Beach Party&#x27; (2017) and &#x27;Wild West&#x27; (2018). The college also hosts TrevStock, an annual music festival for college and university bands which takes place in the quad.

The college regulations once stated that &quot;any student found picking the daffodils shall be hanged, drawn and quartered at dawn on Palace Green.&quot;

===Coat of arms===
The college arms are modelled closely on the arms of the Trevelyan family, whose crest features a swimming horse, commemorating the legend of the first Trevelyan, who swum his horse from St Michael&#x27;s Mount to the mainland of Cornwall for a wager, the other knights of Arthur&#x27;s court having drowned.

The arms of Trevelyan College are blazoned as follows:

Shield: &quot;Gules issuant from water in base barry wavy of four Argent and Azure a demi horse forcene Or, in chief three Saint Cuthbert&#x27;s crosses Argent&quot;

Crest: &quot;Out of a coronet composed of sixteen fleurs-de-lis set upon a rim alternately large and small a lyre Or, mantled Gules doubled Argent&quot;

===Motto===
The college motto, &quot;Vera Fictis Libentius&quot;, was taken from the inscription of the 1875 statue of Lord Macaulay in the antechamber of the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge. In the early 1980s, a competition was held to name the horse. Its eventual name, &quot;Vera&quot;, stems from a student innocently assuming that the college motto, &quot;Vera Fictis Libentius&quot;, was referring to the horse.

==Connections with the Trevelyan family==

<doc id="472724" wikidata="Q3029053" url="?curid=472724" title="The Narrows (Zion National Park)">
<text>The Narrows is the narrowest section of Zion Canyon in Zion National Park, Utah, United States. Situated on the North Fork of the Virgin River and upstream of the main canyon, The Narrows is one of the premier hikes in the park and on the Colorado Plateau. &quot;The Narrows&quot; refers to both the bottom-up hike from the Temple of Sinawava to Big Springs, as well as the top-down hike from Chamberlain&#x27;s Ranch back to the Temple of Sinawava.

==History==
Mormon Pioneer and Explorer Nephi Johnson was guided to Zion Canyon in November 1858 by a friendly Paiute Indian, and was probably the first European-American to see The Narrows. Soon after, in 1861 and 1862, the towns of Virgin and Springdale, just south of Zion Canyon, were founded. The next year, Isaac Behunin built a cabin in upper Zion Canyon for summer farming.

The Narrows was descended (and named) in 1872 by geologist and explorer Grove Karl Gilbert as part of the Wheeler Survey. His party traveled from Navajo Lake through the Narrows to Zion Canyon and Springdale on horseback. John Wesley Powell had traversed the nearby Parunaweap Canyon (the East Fork of the Virgin) earlier in the same year.

From when Zion became a National Park (1919), tourists were guided up the Narrows on horseback well into the 1960s. The through-hike of The Narrows became popular starting in the late 1960s.

==Description==
The Virgin River runs south through upland aspen forest from near Navajo Lake at elevation, to Chamberlain&#x27;s Ranch, where the through-hike of The Narrows starts. The river turns west and a gorge starts to form within . By the time the North Fork enters Zion National Park, from Chamberlain&#x27;s Ranch, the gorge is deep. further, at the confluence with Deep Creek, the gorge is deep, and the combined river turns south. The gorge from here is continuous and has vertical sandstone walls from apart, with pockets of forest on both sides. From Deep Creek to Big Spring is . At Big Spring, the canyon narrows again, and the true Narrows begin. For most of the next stretch to the Mouth of the Narrows, the river runs wall to wall, with vertical sandstone cliffs on both sides. A mile (1.6 km) south of the Mouth of the Narrows is the Temple of Sinawava, where the river enters main Zion Canyon, a flat-floored, quarter- to half-mile-wide (400 to 800 m) canyon with sandstone mountains on each side, their summits above. further south, where the canyon widens again, is the town of Springdale and the southern boundary of Zion National Park.
Hiking The Narrows is arguably the quintessential Zion experience. The Narrows can be hiked either as a top-down through-hike from Chamberlain Ranch to the Temple of Sinawava, or as an up-and-back bottom-up hike from the Temple of Sinawava. Hiking is done largely in the river as, for a third of the route, the river runs canyon wall to canyon wall. Water levels change from season to season; most hikers will wade at least waist-deep and many will swim a few short sections.

The Narrows hike from the bottom up starts at the Temple of Sinawava and ends as far as Big Springs at the 4.3-mile mark. This hike requires a permit. Around the first bend is Mystery Falls, the exit point for Mystery Canyon. At the 2.5-mile point is Orderville Canyon, beyond which lies the Wall Street section of the Narrows, named after the sheer cliff walls surrounding the trail. After this section, the water gets periodically deeper and may require swimming in certain areas. One will need to negotiate a series of boulders at the 4-mile mark, and reach Big Springs at the 4.3-mile mark, where one is required to turn around. The entire hike up to Big Springs is 8.6 miles and may require up to 8 hours.

The through-hike can be done in a day or as a two-day backpack trip. Chamberlain&#x27;s Ranch is accessed by the dirt North Fork Road east of the Park, and is situated in a rolling forest of aspen and scrub oak. No sign of the gorge ahead can be seen from the ranch. The hiker proceeds down the river and into an ever-deepening gorge, eventually getting to The Narrows and ending at the Temple of Sinawava. The hike is long and is very tiring because it is in the river itself. Permits are required before hiking the Narrows from the top and can be obtained at the Zion National Park Wilderness Desk. Reservations should be made ahead of time as permits can be difficult to get during the summer months.

Hiking in the river is strenuous. The water is often murky and the bottom of the river is covered with rocks about the size of bowling balls. This makes proper footwear and bringing in trekking poles or a walking stick essential. The Narrows may be closed in the spring due to flooding while the snow melts off the upland areas to the north if the flow rate is higher than . Thunderstorms can cause The Narrows to flash flood during the summer. Rain showers upriver can cause flash floods in the canyon without it raining over the canyon itself. Thus, hikers should exercise caution when hiking The Narrows during rainy periods as the winding canyon and sheer walls make approaching flash floods all the more sudden and difficult to evade.

<text>Buddhist socialism is a political ideology which advocates socialism based on the principles of Buddhism. Both Buddhism and socialism seek to provide an end to suffering by analyzing its conditions and removing its main causes through praxis. Both also seek to provide a transformation of personal consciousness (respectively, spiritual and political) to bring an end to human alienation and selfishness.

People who have been described as Buddhist socialists include Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, B. R. Ambedkar, Han Yong-un, Girō Senoo, Uchiyama Gudō, Inoue Shūten, Norodom Sihanouk, Takagi Kenmyo and Peljidiin Genden.

== Buddhadāsa Bhikkhu ==
Buddhadāsa Bhikkhu coined the phrase Dhammic socialism. He believed that socialism is a natural state meaning all things exist together in one system:

== Han Yong-un ==
Korean Buddhist reformer Han Yong-un felt that equality was one of the main principles of Buddhism. In an interview published in 1931, Yong-un spoke of his desire to explore Buddhist Socialism:

<doc id="472743" wikidata="Q1331296" url="?curid=472743" title="Gameplay">
<text>Gameplay is the specific way in which players interact with a game. The term applies to both video games and tabletop games. Gameplay is the connection between the player and the game, the player&#x27;s overcoming of challenges, and the pattern of player behavior defined through the game&#x27;s rules. 

==History==

Arising alongside video game development in the 1980s, the term &quot;gameplay&quot; was initially used solely within the context of video games, though now it is also used for tabletop games.

==Definition of term==
There is no consensus on the precise definition of gameplay. It has been differently defined by different authors, but all definitions refer to player interaction with a game. For example:
* &quot;The structures of player interaction with the game system and with other players in the game.&quot;
* &quot;Gameplay here is seen as the interactive gaming process of the player with the game.&quot;
Theorists also agree that video game gameplay is distinct from graphics and audio elements.

Some theorists add more specific elements to the basic definition of gameplay as the interaction between players and games. For example:
* &quot;One or more causally linked series of challenges in a simulated environment.&quot;
* &quot;The experience of gameplay is one of interacting with a game design in the performance of cognitive tasks, with a variety of emotions arising from or associated with different elements of motivation, task performance and completion.&quot;
* In &quot;The Videogame Theory Reader&quot;, G. Frasca identifies three components to gameplay: &quot;Manipulation rules&quot; ( defining what the player can do in the game) &quot;Goal Rules&quot; (defining the goal of the game), and &quot;Metarules&quot; (defining how a game can be tuned or modified).

==Types==
Gameplay can be divided into several types. For example, &quot;cooperative gameplay&quot; involves two or more players playing together, often on a team. Below is a non-exhaustive list of various gameplay types:

* Asymmetric video game
* Cooperative video game
* Emergent gameplay
* Nonlinear gameplay

==Playability==
Playability is a measure of the quality of gameplay. Playability represents the ease, quantity, or duration that a game can be played. Playability evaluative methods target games to improve design, while player experience evaluative methods target players to improve gaming. 

Different scholars analyze playability according to different sets of criteria. For example, in &quot;Playability: analyzing user experience in video games&quot;, the researchers define playability as a set of properties that describe player experience using a specific game system: satisfaction, learning, efficiency, immersion, motivation, emotion, and socialization. However, in &quot;A video game&#x27;s elements ontology&quot;, the researchers define the facets of playability as: intrinsic, mechanical, interactive, artistic, personal, and social.

These concepts of &quot;playability&quot; are not to be confused with the ability to control (or play) characters in multi-character games such as role playing games or fighting games, or factions in real-time strategy games.

<text>Baron Herbert of Lea, of Lea in the County of Wiltshire, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, since 1862 a subsidiary title of the earldom of Pembroke. 

The barony was created in 1861 for the politician Sidney Herbert, the fourth son of George Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke, and the territorial designation referred to Lea, Wiltshire.

Lord Herbert of Lea died only a few months after his elevation to the peerage and was succeeded by his son George, the second Baron, who the following year succeeded a cousin in the earldom of Pembroke. The titles remain united, the current holder being William Alexander Sidney Herbert, 18th Earl of Pembroke, 15th Earl of Montgomery. The heir apparent is his son, Reginald Henry Michael Herbert, Lord Herbert, born on 21 October 2012.

<text>ʿApiru (, ), also known in the Akkadian version Ḫabiru (sometimes written Habiru, Ḫapiru or Hapiru; Akkadian: 𒄩𒁉𒊒, &quot;ḫa-bi-ru&quot; or &quot;*ʿaperu&quot;) is a term used in 2nd-millennium BCE texts throughout the Fertile Crescent for a social status of people who were variously described as rebels, outlaws, raiders, mercenaries, bowmen, servants, slaves, and laborers.

== Etymology ==

The term was first discovered in its Akkadian version &quot;ḫa-bi-ru&quot; or &quot;ḫa-pi-ru&quot;. Due to later findings in Ugaritic and Egyptian which used the consonants ʿ, p and r, and in light of the well-established sound change from Northwest Semitic ʿ to Akkadian ḫ, the root of this term is proven to be ʿ-p-r. This root means &quot;dust, dirt&quot;, and links to the characterization of the ʿApiru as nomads, mercenaries, people who are not part of the cultural society. The morphological pattern of the word is qatilu, which point to a status, condition.

=== The Sumerogram ===
The Akkadian term Ḫabiru occasionally alternates with the sumerograms . Akkadian dictionaries for sumerograms added to the gloss &quot;ḫabatu&quot; &quot;raider&quot;, which raised the suggestion to read the sumerograms as this word. However, the Amarna letters attested the spelling , and letters from Ugarit attested the spelling , which points that these sumerograms were read as written and did not function as ideograms. The only Akkadian word that fits such spelling is &quot;šagašu&quot; (barbarian), but an Akkadian gloss to an Akkadian word seems odd, and the meaning of &quot;šagašu&quot; doesn&#x27;t fit the essence of the Ḫabiru. Therefore, the meaning of should probably be found in a West Semitic word such as Aramaic , which means &quot;muddy, restless&quot;, while the word &quot;ḫabatu&quot; should be interpreted as &quot;nomad,&quot; which fits the meaning of the word Ḫabiru/ʿApiru.

== Hapiru, Habiru, and ʿApiru ==
In the time of Rim-Sin I (1822 BCE to 1763 BCE), the Sumerians knew a group of Aramaean nomads living in southern Mesopotamia as , which meant &quot;trespassers&quot;. The later Akkadians inherited the term, which was rendered as the calque &quot;Ḫabiru&quot;, properly &quot;ʿApiru&quot;. The term occurs in hundreds of 2nd millennium BCE documents covering a 600-year period from the 18th to the 12th centuries BCE and found at sites ranging from Egypt, Canaan and Syria, to Nuzi (Upper Mesopotamia near Kirkuk, northern Iraq) and Anatolia (now Turkey).

Not all Habiru were brigands: in the 18th century BCE, a north Syrian king named Irkabtum (c. 1740 BCE) &quot;made peace with [the warlord] Shemuba and his Habiru,&quot; while the ʿApiru, Idrimi of Alalakh, was the son of a deposed king, and formed a band of ʿApiru to make himself king of Alalakh. What Idrimi shared with the other ʿApiru was membership of an inferior social class of outlaws, mercenaries, and slaves leading a marginal and sometimes lawless existence on the fringes of settled society. ʿApiru had no common ethnic affiliations and no common language, their names being most frequently West Semitic, but also East Semitic, Hurrian or Indo-European.
In the Amarna letters from the 14th century BCE, the petty kings of Canaan describe them sometimes as outlaws, sometimes as mercenaries, and sometimes as day labourers and servants. Usually they are socially marginal, but Rib-Hadda of Byblos calls Abdi-Ashirta of Amurru (modern Lebanon) and his son ʿApiru, with the implication that they have rebelled against their common overlord, the pharaoh. In &quot;The Taking of Joppa&quot; (now Jaffa), an Egyptian work of historical fiction from around 1440 BCE, they appear as brigands, and General Djehuty asks at one point that his horses be taken inside the city lest a passing ʿApir steal them.

== Habiru and the biblical Hebrews ==
Since the discovery of the 2nd millennium BCE inscriptions mentioning the Habiru, there have been many theories linking these to the Hebrews of the Bible. Most of these theories were based on the supposed etymological link and were widely denied basing on the Egyptian sources and later following the Ugaritic and Hittite discoveries. There are two main barriers, linguistic and group identity.

Some scholars, Anson Rainey and R. Steven Notley among them, deny any linguistic relationship between Abiru and Hebrew, or at most admit only &quot;a bare possibility.&quot; But this view remains short of academic consensus. Philologically, argued Moshe Greenberg, Apiru and Hebrew though not transparently related are not irreconcilable. Nadav Na’aman had no doubt that the term “Hebrew” was derived from “Habiru.” The Christian priestly scholars, such as Manfred Weippert, Henry Cazelles and Oswald Loretz, are the least ready to give up the relation between Apiru and Hebrew. For them the linguistic equation between Apiru and Hebrew is easy and comfortable. Loretz, however, admits the etymological possibility despite denying all equations between Apiru and Hebrew.

Regarding the identity, the academic consensus is well established that Apiru and Hebrews represent two different groups. The Biblical Hebrews are an ethnic group while Apiru were a much wider multi-ethnic group distinguished by social status. The morphological pattern of the word ʿApiru is, as mentioned above, qatilu, which point a status, as opposed to the morphological pattern of the ethnonym עִבְרִי (Hebrew) which is based on nisba (like מִצְרִי – Egyptian). Moreover, Meredith Kline finds that Apiru were not even Semitic peoples.

The matter was complicated when, in the light of the research on Apiru, scholars examined the context of Hebrews in the Bible. The new analysis indicated a group broader than the Israelites and more associating with Apiru, best seen in 1 Samuel 13, 14. Na’aman and Yoel Bin-Nun point out that “Hebrew” is typically used to describe “Israelites in exceptional circumstances,” in particular, wandering, oppressed or enslaved Israelites struggling for liberation.
 Naaman finds that all biblical references to the &quot;Hebrews&quot; reflect some traits borrowed from the image of the second millennium Apiru. Greenberg confirms that Hebrew is an archaic term predating Israelites. Professor Albert D. Friedberg concurs, arguing that Apiru refers to a social class found in every ancient Near Eastern society but in the texts that describe the early periods of the Patriarchs and the Exodus the term Hebrew refers to a broad group of people in the Levant (like the Apiru), among whom the Israelites were a part.

Joseph Blenkinsopp makes one exception: Except for its first appearance (Gen. 14:13), the biblical word &quot;Hebrew&quot;, can be interpreted as a social category. For some scholars, however, the passage is confirmation rather than exception. Here Abram appears as a leader of host in a military alliance. He pursues and smites his enemy. The passage presents a warrior Abram, with a rather different character from that of Genesis other episodes, in which Abram is never a warrior. This associates with Apiru too. In the earliest Mesopotamian texts mentioning Apiru they appear as military contingents, auxiliaries, or bands of raiders. Babylonian and Mari tablets mention them particularly as military auxiliaries. Elsewhere in the Fertile Crescent they are also often depicted as auxiliary warriors. In the Amarna letters, Apiru are most prominent in military activity. Some hypotheses on Genesis 14 suggested a foreign, perhaps Babylonian, document at the core, or a memory of time when Abram belonged to Apiru before the term Hebrew obtained an ethnic meaning. Elsewhere in the Bible, the Israelites are called Hebrews when enslaved or oppressed and struggling for liberation. The military context associates with one of the interpretations suggested for Apiru. In Sumerogram SA.GAZ, SA could mean &quot;muscle&quot; and GAZ &quot;to strike&quot; or &quot;kill.&quot; The meaning &quot;murderer&quot; or &quot;killer&quot; was suggested for the combination SA.GAZ, or literally &quot;muscle killer.&quot; SA.GAZ was supposed to be a transliteration of the Accadian pseudo-ideogram šaggāšum or murderer. The &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; (1:4:7) uses saggasum for Enkidu describing him as a military leader and nomad native of the wild steppe-lands. In the Old Babylonian tradition, Šaggāšu is a ghost-murderer of the steppe. As stated above, the research defined &quot;dust&quot; or &quot;dirt&quot; as the most probable meaning of Apiru. The wandering Apiru, Rainey suggested, had to &quot;hit the road,&quot; thus they were covered with dust and were called dusty. But this is a hypothetical suggestion not found in primary sources. The sources attested another meaning. In Sumerian there was a verb &quot;to dust,&quot; meaning &quot;to fight&quot; or &quot;to struggle.&quot; Gilgamesh and Aga twice (70-81, 92-99) says &quot;myriad dusted,&quot; meaning &quot;myriad fought.&quot; Andrew R. George translated this literally as &quot;myriad rolled in the dust,&quot; and the Sumerian Corpus, less successfully, as &quot;multitudes were smeared with the dust.&quot; Whether borrowed from Sumer or not, a similar combination is present in Hebrew, with &quot;abak&quot; (אבק) for &quot;dust&quot; and &quot;maabak&quot; (מאבק) for &quot;struggle.&quot; Another link between Apiru and struggle is found in the cuneiform SA of SA.GAZ. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, it is a logogram for Akkadian &quot;šer&#x27;ānu&quot;, translated as &quot;muscle.&quot; The root is present in Hebrew with &quot;srir&quot; (שריר) for &quot;muscle&quot; and a verb was derived from it meaning &quot;to struggle.&quot; &quot;Isra&quot; (in Israel) means &quot;struggling&quot; (with God). In this light, Abram the Hebrew in Genesis 14 means Abram the warrior rather than Abram the dust, the earliest and one of prominent functions of Apiru.

The consensus remains that Apiru and Hebrews were not identical groups, but scholars became divided whether the two groups were related. Some scholars remained unmoved and deny any relation. Those relating Apiru and Hebrews were mistaken, states Rainey. All attempts to relate the two are wishful thinking. He notes that while ʿApiru covered the regions from Nuzi to Anatolia as well as Northern Syria, Canaan and Egypt, they were distinguished from Shutu (Sutu) or Shasu (Shosu), Syrian pastoral nomads named in the Amarna letters and likely more closely associated with the Hebrews. Kline suggests that Apiru, besides being non-Semitic, were foes of Israel and their first oppressors in Canaan.

Other scholars, by contrast, allowed the possibility of relation. As pointed out by Moore and Kelle, while the ʿApiru/Ḫabiru appear to be composed of many different peoples, including nomadic Shasu and Shutu, the biblical Midianites, Kenites, and Amalekites, as well as displaced peasants and pastoralists, they also may be related to the biblical Hebrews. A hypothesis emerged that Hebrews were one offshoot of Apiru, a larger whole from which the Hebrews originated. It has become a commonplace assumption that all Israelites were Hebrews but not all Hebrews were Israelites.

The ethnic connotation of the term Hebrew synonymous with the people of Israel were attributed to the later Jewish tradition. &quot;It could well be&quot;, writes Stuart A. West, &quot;that the word Hebrew was originally only a sociological designation, indicating status or class - in which case the words Hebrew and Habiru are synonymous. The fact that in the later Books of the Bible and in its usage in post-biblical times, the word Hebrew has been used as an ethnic designation simply means that the original meaning of the word has been changed.&quot; Loretz assigns all mentions of Hebrew in the Bible to post-exilic period centuries after Apiru disappeared from the sources.

Greenberg concluded his research: The ʿApiru were ethnically diverse but this term can be related to the term &quot;Hebrew&quot; both in etymology and meaning. The ethnic and social spheres may have met in Abraham the Hebrew, who may at once have been an Apiru as well as the ancestor of the Israelites. &quot;Hebrew&quot; will then be a peculiarly Biblical adaptation of the social term. A considerable possibility remains that the beginnings of the Israelite history are bound with the wandering Apiru. The Bible might have preserved a vague memory that the Patriarchs had once been Apiru.

<text>A honeypot site is a location attractive to tourists who, due to their numbers, place pressure on the environment and local people.

Honeypots are often used by cities or countries to manage their tourism industry. The use of honeypots can protect fragile land away from major cities while satisfying tourists. One such example is the construction of local parks to prevent tourists from damaging more valuable ecosystems further from their main destination. Honeypots have the added benefit of concentrating many income-generating visitors in one place, therefore developing that area, and in turn making it more appealing to tourists.

However, honeypots can suffer from problems of overcrowding, including litter, vandalism, and strain on facilities and transport networks. Honeypots attract tourists because of parking spaces, shopping centres, parks and public toilets. The tourist shops are normally placed all over the shopping centre, which creates pressure on the whole centre to keep the area looking tidy. For example, Stratford-upon-Avon has shops that are aimed mostly at tourists. On a particular street, there were five shops which were aimed towards the locals and ten shops catering to tourists, reflecting the business opportunity that tourism presents for shopkeepers and other business people in the local economy.

<doc id="472776" wikidata="Q1877911" url="?curid=472776" title="Lutheran Church – Canada">
<text>Lutheran Church – Canada (LCC) is a confessional Lutheran denomination in Canada. It is the second largest Lutheran body in Canada after the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada (ELCIC). Together with the ELCIC and the Canadian Association of Lutheran Congregations, it is one of only three all-Canadian Lutheran denominations. LCC was founded in 1988 when Canadian congregations of the St. Louis–based Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod (LCMS) formed an autonomous church body with a synodical office in Winnipeg, Manitoba. LCC has no substantial theological divisions from LCMS and the two church bodies are in full altar and pulpit fellowship with each other.

== History ==
Lutheranism in Canada dates back to Danish explorers in 1619 and German settlers in Nova Scotia in 1749, the latter encouraged to populate the territory by George II of Great Britain; a first church was raised in Halifax in 1752. As Canadian settlement spread west, Ontarian congregations followed in the late 1700s, Manitoban ones in the 1800s, and Albertan ones in the early 1900s. For two centuries Lutheran churches in Canada tended to be organized under shifting arrangements of sponsorship from various American synods and conferences until coalescing into LCMS in 1958 and ELCIC in 1967, and from 1958 to 1988 LCC existed as a federated group under the LCMS umbrella.

Following its independent establishment in January 1988, LCC created three districts: The Alberta-British Columbia (ABC) District, with offices in Edmonton, Alberta; the Central District, in Winnipeg, Manitoba; and the East District, in Kitchener, Ontario. At present LCC has a congregational roster of 58 churches in British Columbia; 78 in Alberta; 62 in Saskatchewan; 20 in Manitoba; 124 in Ontario; 11 in Quebec; 1 in New Brunswick; and 2 in Nova Scotia; one in Prince Edward Island. Services are variously offered in English, German, Spanish, French, and Korean. Sixteen Canadian congregations – one in Montreal, and the rest in Ontario – remain affiliated with the LCMS in either of that body&#x27;s non-geographic districts, namely the SELC District or the English District.

On July 5, 2015, the Alberta-British Columbia (ABC) District announced it had a &quot;sufficient cash flow shortage&quot;. The district&#x27;s Church Extension Fund (CEF), which was originally instituted in order to provide low-interest loans to congregations, was insolvent. The ABC District entered CCAA (bankruptcy protection) on January 23, 2015. Estimates are that the ABC District&#x27;s church extension fund was underfunded by between C$60M and C$80M dollars. Because of poor administrative practices, many key records have not been found. Several lawsuits to determine the ownership of various congregation properties have been the result.

On August 13, 2018, the Alberta Securities Commission convened a hearing and set 32 days of hearings in May 2019 to explore the merits of the allegations. The hearings are intended to clarify multiple securities allegations against The Alberta British - Columbia District and five former leaders including Rev. Donald Robert Schiemann (District President), Kurtis Francis Robinson (Financial Executive), James Theodore Kentel (chairman, Board of Directors), Rev. Mark David Ruf (First Vice-president), Harold Carl Schmidt (Board of Directors). The Alberta Securities Commission &quot;Staff allege that each of the Respondents breached, or authorized, permitted, or acquiesced in the breach of section 92(4.1) of the Act&quot;, and that &quot;they knew or ought to have known did not state all of the facts required to be stated to make the statements not misleading, and which would reasonably be expected to have a significant effect on the market price or value of the securities distributed by the District and DIL&quot;.

On September 12, 2019, the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; reported that, &quot;The Alberta Securities Commission has reached a settlement with the Lutheran Church-Canada, the Alberta-British Columbia District and others in connection with an investment program that collapsed into insolvency in 2015.

In the settlement agreement, the parties admitted to breaching Alberta securities laws by making statements “they knew or ought to have known did not state all of the facts required,” as stated in a release from the ASC.

A side-effect of the financial collapse of the Alberta-British Columbia District is that LCC decided to restructure the national church body. As a result, the ABC District, Central District, and East District were dissolved into one national synod effective January 2, 2019.

== Doctrines ==
Like other confessional Lutheran bodies, LCC believes the Bible is the inerrant and inspired Word of God. It professes the Lutheran Confessions as contained in the Book of Concord &quot;because&quot; they are a faithful expression of the Scriptures. LCC practices closed communion, viewing communion as an intimate act shared only with other Christians who subscribe to LCC&#x27;s doctrines. LCC practices infant baptism and normally requires confirmation instruction for full congregational participation. The church body is in communion with some member synods of the International Lutheran Council (e.g. LCMS). Many LCC congregations use the &quot;Lutheran Service Book&quot; as their hymnal.

While LCC churches do not permit women in ministerial roles, women serve in elected or appointed lay offices in churches, such as teachers and deaconesses.

== Activities ==
The church body has two seminaries established for the training of pastors, Concordia Lutheran Theological Seminary in St. Catharines, Ontario (opened 1976), and Concordia Lutheran Seminary in Edmonton, Alberta (opened 1984).

Concordia University of Edmonton is an independent university in Edmonton established by the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod in 1921 to train Lutheran pastors. It became an auxiliary of LCC in 1988 and remained so until 2010. Concordia provided training programs for church workers until their suspension in 2015. Concordia as of November 2015 is no longer Lutheran in its outlook or affiliations. In the mid-20th century, health care initiatives also grew with the establishment of auxiliary hospitals and senior citizens&#x27; homes under LCC auspices, as well as military and prison chaplaincies.

The official archive of Lutheran Church – Canada, the underlying districts, and auxiliaries was the Lutheran Historical Institute, Edmonton. It closed in August 2015 after Concordia University of Edmonton and the Alberta British Columbia District of the LCC refused to provide funding. This occurred due to administrative and financial irregularities within Lutheran entities.

LCC is involved with foreign missions in Nicaragua, where work begun in 1997, which resulted in the founding of the Lutheran Church Synod of Nicaragua () in 2008; southeast Asia, where it assists in providing theological education for future pastors in Thailand and Cambodia; Venezuela; and Ukraine, where it partners with the Synod of Evangelical Lutheran Churches of Ukraine in the training of pastors at Concordia Seminary in Usatovo (near Odesa) in the southern part of the country.

<text>Arkhangelsk Oblast () is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast). It includes the Arctic archipelagos of Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya, as well as the Solovetsky Islands in the White Sea. Arkhangelsk Oblast also has administrative jurisdiction over the Nenets Autonomous Okrug (NAO). Including the NAO, Arkhangelsk Oblast has an area of , it&#x27;s the largest of first-level administrative divisions in Europe. Its population (including the NAO) was 1,227,626 as of the 2010 Census.

The city of Arkhangelsk, with a population of 301,199 as of the 2021 Census, is the administrative center of the oblast. The second largest city is the nearby Severodvinsk, home to Sevmash, a major shipyard for the Russian Navy. Among the oldest populated places of the oblast are Kholmogory, Kargopol, and Solvychegodsk; there are a number of Russian Orthodox monasteries, including the Antoniev Siysky Monastery and the World Heritage Site of the Solovetsky Islands in the White Sea.

Plesetsk Cosmodrome is one of three spaceports in Russia (the other two are Kapustin Yar in Astrakhan Oblast and Yasny in Orenburg Oblast).

==Geography==
Arkhangelsk Oblast, which includes the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, borders Kirov Oblast, Vologda Oblast, the Republic of Karelia, the Komi Republic, and the White, Pechora, Barents and Kara seas. Cape Fligely in Franz Josef Land (the northernmost point of Russia, Europe and Eurasia) and Cape Zhelaniya in Novaya Zemlya (the easternmost point of Europe) are both located within Arkhangelsk Oblast. Mount Kruzenshtern is the highest point of the oblast.

Arkhangelsk Oblast is located on the East European Plain, and most of it is forested, hilly landscape. The north-eastern part belongs to the Timan Ridge, a highland mostly situated east from the oblast. The Nenets Autonomous Okrug is essentially a flat tundra (Bolshezemelskaya Tundra) with several hill chains like Pay-Khoy Ridge. The Arctic islands including Novaya Zemlya and Franz Joseph Land are mountainous with glaciers and eternally snow-covered. This region has a genetically distinct population of polar bears associated with the Barents Sea area.
Almost all of the area of the Oblast belongs to the basin of the Arctic Ocean, with the major rivers being the (from west to east) Onega River, the Northern Dvina (with the major tributaries the Vychegda, the Vaga, and the Pinega), Kuloy River, Mezen River, and Pechora Rivers. A minor area in the west of the Oblast, most notably the basin of the Ileksa River, drains into Lake Onega and eventually to the Baltic Sea. A very minor area in Kargopolsky District in the south-west of the Oblast drains into the Kema River which belongs to the basin of the Caspian Sea. The area in the Onega River basin containing the biggest lakes in the oblast, such as Lake Lacha, Lake Kenozero, Lake Undozero, and Lake Kozhozero. The tundra of the Nenets Autonomous Okrug also contains a number of bigger lakes. The river basin of the Pinega is characteristic of the karst, with a number of caves in the region.

The White Sea coast within the Oblast is split into the Onega Bay (where the Onega is the major tributary), the Dvina Bay (the Northern Dvina), and the Mezen Bay (comprising the Mezen and the Kuloy). The Solovetsky Islands, as well as a number of smaller islands, are located in Onega Bay. Onega Bay and the Dvina Bay are separated by the Onega Peninsula. The Mezen Bay is separated from the main body of the White Sea by Morzhovets Island. Other major islands in the oblast include Shogly, Zhizgin, Yagry, Lyasomin, Layda, Nikolskiy, and Mudyugskiy islands.

Almost all of the oblast is covered by taiga, the coniferous forest dominated by pine, spruce, and larch. Large areas in the middle of taiga are devoid of trees and covered by swamps. In the floodplains of the rivers, there are meadows.

A number of areas in Arkhangelsk Oblast have been designated as protected natural areas. These are subdivided into national parks, nature reserves (zapovedniks), and zakazniks of the federal level. The following protected areas have been designated,
*Kenozersky National Park;
*Onezhskoye Pomorye National Park
*Russkaya Arktika National Park (which included previously established Franz Joseph Land Zakaznik);
*Vodlozersky National Park (shared with the Republic of Karelia);
*Pinezhsky Nature Reserve;
*Siysky Zakaznik.

Kenozersky and Vodlozersky National Parks have the status of UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. In addition, there are two protected areas in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, adjacent to each other: Nenetsky Nature Reserve and Nenetsky Zakaznik.

==History==

The area of Arkhangelsk Oblast has been settled by Finno-Ugric peoples since prehistoric times, and most of the toponyms in the region are in fact Finno-Ugric. It was subsequently colonized by the Novgorod Republic. Kargopol was first mentioned in the chronicles in 1146, Shenkursk was mentioned in 1315, and Solvychegodsk was founded in the 14th century.

By the 13th century the Novgorodian merchants had already reached the White Sea, attracted to the area for fur trading. The Novgorodians penetrated the area using the waterways, and this is why most of the ancient (as well as the modern) settlements were located into the main river valleys. The main historical areas of the Arkhangelsk region were Poonezhye () along the Onega, the Dvina Land along the Northern Dvina, Pinezhye () along the Pinega, Mezen Lands along the Mezen, and Pomorye () on the White Sea coast.

The main waterway was the Northern Dvina, and Novgorod merchants used the Volga and its tributary, the Sheksna, along the Slavyanka River into Lake Nikolskoye, then the boats were taken by land to Lake Blagoveshchenskoye, from there downstream along the Porozovitsa River into Lake Kubenskoye and further to the Sukhona and the Northern Dvina. Portages from the Northern Dvina Basin led further to the Mezen and the Pechora.

After the fall of Novgorod in 1478, all these lands became a part of the Great Duchy of Moscow. Until 1703, the Northern Dvina served as the main export trading route of Muscovy. The local centers were Veliky Ustyug and Kholmogory; however, during the 17th century, Kholmogory lost its significance, and its role was gradually replaced by Arkhangelsk.

In 1708, when the governorates were established by Tsar Peter the Great, Arkhangelsk became the seat of one of the seven governorates of the Russian Empire.

At the same time, Arkhangelsk lands were one of the most remote areas in Russia. This fact was attractive for monks fleeing the crowds. In 1436, Solovetsky Monastery was founded, and it quickly became one of the richest and most influential Russian monasteries. Other monasteries followed. For instance, Kozheozersky Monastery, founded in 1552, still remains one of the most remote Russian Orthodox monasteries. After the great schism in the Russian Orthodox Church in 1653, the area attracted many Old Believers, who were persecuted by the state. Most would later flee to even more remote locations such as Siberia.

In 1703, with the construction of St. Petersburg, Arkhangelsk, which lacked St. Petersburg&#x27;s geographical proximity to Europe and the non-freezing harbour of Murmansk, lost its significance as the main trading harbour of the Russian Empire. However, in the early 20th century Arkhangelsk was an important starting point for Russian Arctic expeditions. For instance, in the 1830s Pyotr Pakhtusov sailed twice from Arkhangelsk to investigate and map Novaya Zemlya.
In 1918 and 1919, Arkhangelsk Governorate became one of the most active battlegrounds of the Civil War in Russia. On 2 August 1918 Arkhangelsk was occupied by British and American troops, allied with the White movement. Administratively, they established the Northern Oblast with the center in Arkhangelsk. This episode of the Civil War is known as the North Russia Intervention. The troops advanced to the south, occupied the station of Obozerskaya in September 1918, and moving along the Northern Dvina and the Vaga Rivers. The southernmost points occupied by the allies were Shenkursk and Verkhnyaya Toyma. The allies were hoping that the Aleksandr Kolchak&#x27;s forces would move in the direction of Kotlas, however, the White Army was unable to advance in this direction. In January 1919, after the Battle of Shenkursk, the allied forces were driven out of the Shenkursk area. Battles around the station of Plesetskaya followed. On 20 February 1920 the Red Army entered Arkhangelsk, by which time all allied troops had already been evacuated.

In the 1930s, the Soviets carried out the same experiments in economics as elsewhere in Soviet Union. The peasants and fishermen were forcibly organized into collective farms. These were heavily subsidized, which eventually brought the agriculture to the collapse in the 1990s, when the subsidies stopped. Arkhangelsk Oblast was and remains attractive as an area for exile, forcible resettlement, and prison camps. Actually, the first prison camp, Solovki prison camp, was created in 1920 on the premises of the former Solovetsky Monastery. Novaya Zemlya from the 1950s, when its population (mostly the Nenets) was strongly recommended to leave, became the military ground for nuclear bomb testing.

In 1932, the icebreaker &quot;Sibiryakov&quot; under the command of Vladimir Voronin, sailing from Arkhangelsk, crossed the Northern Sea Route in a single navigation.

Arkhangelsk Oblast proper was established in 1937. Before 1991, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: the first secretary of the Arkhangelsk Oblast CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). In 1991 the CPSU lost all power. The head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor, came to be elected or appointed.

The economic crisis of 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, struck Arkhangelsk Oblast very badly. Although there remains a strong demand for timber, the basis of the oblast&#x27;s economy, the population of Arkhangelsk Oblast has steadily declined, especially in rural areas. Many villages either have been deserted, or are on the verge of disappearing.

==Politics==
During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Arkhangelsk CPSU Committee (who in reality had the highest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Arkhangelsk Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Arkhangelsk Oblast is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

===First secretaries of the Arkhangelsk Oblast CPSU Committee===
In the period when they were the most important authority in the oblast (1937 to 1991), the following first secretaries were appointed

==Administrative divisions==
The oblast is administratively divided into six cities and towns under the oblast&#x27;s jurisdiction (Arkhangelsk, Koryazhma, Kotlas, Novodvinsk, Onega, and Severodvinsk), one city under the federal jurisdiction (Mirny), twenty-one districts (one of which is Novaya Zemlya), and two island territories (Franz Josef Land and Victoria Island). Another six towns (Kargopol, Mezen, Nyandoma, Shenkursk, Solvychegodsk, and Velsk) have the status of the towns of district significance.

Nenets Autonomous Okrug, which is administratively subordinated to the oblast, is administratively divided into one district (Zapolyarny District) and one town of okrug significance (Naryan-Mar).

===Restricted access===
Huge areas within the limits of the oblast are included in the border security zone, intended to protect the borders of the Russian Federation from unwanted activity. These restricted areas include all islands in the Arctic Ocean and in Barents Sea, Morzhovets Island, and most of the White Sea coast in Mezensky District. In particular, the area includes the town of Mezen and the urban type settlement of Kamenka. In order to visit the zone, a permit issued by the local FSB department is required.

==Economy==
===Industry===
Arkhangelsk Oblast is one of the industrial regions of Russia. The region has a developed fishery, forestry, woodworking, cellulose, and paper industry. There are large reserves of natural resources: Lumber, oil, bauxite, titanium, gold, manganese, and basalt. In 2011, the paper production and related industries were responsible for 55% of all industrial production of the Oblast, food production – 11%, timber processing (excluding paper production) and furniture production – 12%.

The principal industrial enterprises in Arkhangelsk Oblast are shipyards in Arkhangelsk and Severodvinsk (including Sevmash), pulp and paper mills in Koryazhma and Novodvinsk, and bauxite extraction plant in Severoonezhsk. Almost any town has some timber works.

===Agriculture===

Fishery traditionally was the main means of subsistence in the Pomor villages at the White Sea coast. During the Soviet times, the fishermen were organized into collective and state farms (Sovkhoz&#x27;s) and the fishery was heavily subsidized. In the 1990s the subsidies were stopped, and the fishery went into a serious crisis, some of the villages were deserted.

In the valleys of the main rivers, there is some cattle breeding and crop and potato growing, which is, however, difficult due to the cold climate. Ustyansky District is notable for bee-keeping. Two notable breeds originate from Arkhangelsk Oblast. The Kholmogory cattle, from Kholmogory and Arkhangelsk countryside, mostly black and white, was particularly stable against cold climate in Northern Russia and eventually spread well beyond the Arkhangelsk Region. The Mezen horses, bred in the Mezen River valley, are rather small but suitable for difficult work and easily survive cold winters.

===Transportation===
The area of current Arkhangelsk Oblast has always been located on the trading routes connecting central Russia to the White Sea, and, in fact, in the 17th century the White Sea was the main sea export route for Russia. The whole course of the Northern Dvina is navigable, as well as the lower course of some of its tributaries, most notably the Vychegda, the Vaga, and the Pinega. The Mezen is also navigable in the lower course. The Onega is not navigable except for the two relatively short stretches because of the rapids. However, except for the lower course of the Vychegda and some parts of the Northern Dvina, there is currently very little or no regular passenger navigation on these rivers. They are used for cargo traffic though.

In 1765, a road was built between Saint-Petersburg and Arkhangelsk, mainly for postal service. The road still exists and passes Kargopol and Plesetsk, and it was paved in 2011. One of the principal highways in Russia, M8, connects Moscow and Arkhangelsk, and passes Velsk. This highway is paved and heavily used. In general, the road network is grossly underdeveloped. Only several all-season highways, in addition to M8, cross the oblast boundaries: the one (partially unpaved) connecting Kotlas with Syktyvkar; the one (paved) connecting Kotlas to Veliky Ustyug and eventually with Vologda and Nikolsk, the one (paved) from Konosha southwards, and two (unpaved) from Kargopol to Pudozh and to Solza and Belozersk. Most of the local roads are unpaved. Until 2008, there were no all-season roads connecting the main road network with the north-east of the oblast, including the town of Mezen and the selo of Leshukonskoye, and there are still no roads into the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, on the left bank of the Onega downstream from Severoonezhsk, and very few roads on the right bank of the Northern Dvina. Many rivers can be crossed only by ferry boats, which means they cannot be crossed during the ice melting period. There is regular bus service on the main roads.
The principal railway line in the oblast is the railroad connecting Moscow and Arkhangelsk. The piece between Vologda and Arkhangelsk was constructed in 1890s and passed through previously uninhabited areas between the valleys of the Northern Dvina and the Onega. The railroad construction gave the momentum to the population and exploitation of these areas. A branch from Konosha eastwards to Kotlas and further to Vorkuta was constructed in the 1940s to facilitate the transport of coal from the Komi Republic. From Kotlas, another branch continues south to Kirov. A branch from Obozersky to the west, to Onega and further to Belomorsk, was built during World War II to secure the transport of goods from the harbour of Murmansk to central Russia. A piece of railroad between Arkhangelsk and Karpogory was also built in the 1970s and is expected to become part of the Belkomur project — a railway line connecting Arkhangelsk via the Komi Republic with the Perm Krai and the Ural Mountains. Almost the entire rail network belongs to the Northern Railway, which west of Onega connects to the Oktyabrskaya Railway. There is also a railway line from Severoonezhsk west to Yangory (an extension of the line from Puksa to Navolok), which belongs to the Department of Corrections. A large number of narrow-gauge railways were built in the 1950s and 1960s to facilitate the transport of timber, but since then most of these became unprofitable and have been destroyed.

In the 1970s and 1980s the aviation was active, with all district centers connected to Arkhangelsk with regular flights, Kotlas being the second important hub. Currently, it has almost disappeared. There are two airports in Arkhangelsk, but regular local flights are only carried out to the destinations which do not have rail or road connections, such as Novaya Zemlya, Solovetsky Islands, the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, the Onega Peninsula, and the north of the oblast. The exceptions with functioning airports are Mezen, Leshukonskoye, and Onega.

The oil transport system, Baltic Pipeline System, runs through the oblast, with two oil-pumping station located at Urdoma and Privodino.

The Kudemskaya narrow-gauge railway in 2010 has appeared in Forbes ranking, of 10 most beautiful railway routes of the world.
*The Konetsgorskaya narrow-gauge railway for hauling felled logs operates in the Vinogradovsky District.
*The Loyginskaya narrow-gauge railway for hauling felled logs operates in the Ustyansky District.
*The Nyubskaya narrow-gauge railway for hauling felled logs operates in the Kotlassky District.
*The Udimskaya narrow-gauge railway for hauling felled logs operates in the Kotlassky District.
*The Zelennikovskaya narrow-gauge railway for hauling felled logs operates in the Verkhnetoyemsky District.

A notable subgroup of Russian population are the Pomors, who reside along the White Sea coast and in the valleys of major rivers, speak Pomor dialects and are in fact the descendants of the Novgorod population who colonized the Russian North in 12th–13th centuries. In 2002 Census, approximately 6,500 residents of Arkhangelsk Oblast indicated their ethnicity as Pomors.

===Settlements===
===Religion===
According to a 2012 survey 29.1% of the population of Arkhangelsk Oblast adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, 6% are unaffiliated generic Christians, 1% are Orthodox Christian believers without belonging to any church or members of other Orthodox churches, 1% adheres to the Slavic native faith (Rodnovery). In addition, 32% of the population declared to be &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;, 16% is atheist, and 17.9% follows other religions or did not give an answer to the question.
==Arts and culture==
===Architecture===
Arkhangelsk Oblast is famous for its wooden buildings which include churches, chapels, peasant houses and farms, and city houses. The choice of wood as the construction material is natural for a region almost exclusively covered by taiga and still being one of the biggest timber producers. Some of these buildings date from the 17th century. Churches and chapels are considered particularly fine, and almost all of these constructed prior to 1920s have been declared the cultural heritage at the federal or local levels. More than 600 buildings (both of timber and stone) are protected on the federal level. An open-air ethnographic museum was open in the village of Malye Korely close to Arkhangelsk, with the purpose of preserving this heritage.
The most notable wooden churches are triple church ensembles, which consist of two churches (a bigger, not heated, church used in the summer, and a smaller, heated church used in the winter) and a bell-tower. Not more than a dozen of these triple wooden ensembles survived, the best known being the one located in the Kizhi Pogost in the Republic of Karelia and is classified as World Heritage. Most of these ensembles are located in the Arkhangelsk Oblast, in particular, in the villages of Varzogory and Abramovskaya (Onezhsky District). Other notable wooden churches are located in Kargopolsky (Oshevenskoye, Krasnaya Lyaga, Saunino and others), Verkhnetoyemsky (Soyezerskaya Pustyn), Onezhsky, Primorsky, and Plesetsky (Porzhensky Pogost) districts.
Despite being listed as cultural heritage, most of these buildings are neglected and regularly burn down. As a matter of fact, the majority of the churches considered as masterpieces has been lost. For instance, Verkhnemudyugsky Pogost in Onezhsky District, a triple church ensemble, burned down in 1997. A church and the bell-tower of the triple ensemble in Lyadiny (Kargopolsky District) burned down on 6 May 2013.

The oblast preserves some of the best stone architectural ensembles in Russia. The ensemble of the Solovetsky Monastery (founded 1436, the earliest surviving buildings stem from the 16th century) has been designated as the World Heritage. The town of Kargopol contains a number of white-stone churches, the earliest of which, the Cathedral of the Nativity of Christ, originates from 1552. The Presentation Church (1688–1712) in Solvychegodsk is an acclaimed baroque masterpiece and one of the five surviving Stroganov baroque churches.

Two of the towns in the oblast – Kargopol and Solvychegodsk – are classified as historical towns by the Ministry of Culture of Russian Federation, which implies certain restrictions on construction in their historical centers.

===Arts===
The monasteries facilitated the development of icon painting which existed in the area well until the 19th century. No single unified icon style arose, and icons produced in current Arkhangelsk and Vologda Oblasts are commonly known as Northern icon painting (&quot;Северные письма&quot;). Icons were produced in Solovetsky, Antoniev Siysky, Kozheozersky and other monasteries, as well as in the towns of Kholmogory and Solvychegodsk. Solvychegodsk icon painting was sponsored by Stroganovs and generated the Stroganov icon painting school, which in the end of the 17th century was principally active in Moscow.

The icon-painting techniques were transferred to the traditional wood painting known since the 17th century in the valleys of the Northern Dvina (Nizhnyaya Toyma, Borok, Puchuga, Permogorye), the Pinega, and the Mezen. It was used to decorate various wooden surfaces such as, for example, spinning distaffs or chests, and employed geometrical figures as well as images of plants, animals, and humans. The Arkhangelsk traditional wooden painting is special since the surface was prepared in a particular way before the painting started, similar to icons.

Despite the fact that several notable Russian artists including Vasily Vereshchagin traveled into the region in the 19th century, professional (non-icon) painting did not develop in Arkhangelsk until the 1890s. Aleksandr Borisov, Stepan Pisakhov, and Tyko Vylka, all of them landscape painters interested in Northern and Arctic landscapes, are considered as the founders of Arkhangelsk painting.

Various handicrafts were developed in the area. The most notable ones are the Kholmogory bone carving, existing since the 17th century, and Kargopol toys, moulded painted clay figures of people and animals.

===Literature===
Like other areas of Northern Russia, Arkhangelsk Oblast is notable for its folklore. Until the mid-20th century, fairy tales and bylinas were still performed on a daily basis by professional performers, some of whom, like Mariya Krivopolenova, achieved prominence in Moscow and St. Petersburg. One of the first Arkhangelsk folklore collectors was Alexander Hilferding, who actually died in Kargopol during his journey. Starting from the 1890s, folkloric expeditions were organized to the White Sea area, and later to other areas of the Arkhangelsk Governorate, in order to write down the tales and the bylinas, in particular, in Pomor dialects. In the 1920s, mostly due to the efforts of Anna Astakhova, these expeditions became systematic. The results have been published. By the 1960s, the performing art was basically extinct. However, these folkloric motives and fairy tales inspired the literary works of Stepan Pisakhov and Boris Shergin, who were both natives of Arkhangelsk.

Protopope Avvakum, a 17th-century monk, who led the opposition (&quot;raskol&quot;) against the reforms of the Russian Orthodox Church, was exiled to Mezen for two years in 1664, and in 1667 was imprisoned in Pustozyorsk, currently in Nenets Autonomous Okrug, for 14 years before being burned alive. Avvakum is an author of about sixty literary works, including the &quot;Life of Avvakum&quot;, most of which were written in Pustozyorsk and are considered among the most notable Russian literary pieces of the 17th century.

Mikhail Lomonosov, a polymath and poet who created the basis of the modern Russian literary language, was born in 1711 in the village of Denisovka, close to Kholmogory, though he left the area to pursue his studies at the age of 18 and spent most of his career in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg. Denisovka was later renamed into Lomonosovo in his honour.

Aleksey Chapygin, a historical novelist, was born in what is now Kargopol District. His first novels describe the peasant life of the Arkhangelsk Governorate.

In the 20th century, two of the authors of the Village prose movement in Soviet literature, which predominantly described rural life, were tightly connected with Arkhangelsk Region: Fyodor Abramov was born in the peasant family in the village of Verkola in Pinezhsky Uyezd, and Aleksander Yashin lived in Arkhangelsk for some time. In their literary works, as well as in the works of Yury Kazakov, a short story writer who traveled extensively in the Russian North, the life of Arkhangelsk peasants features prominently. The name of one of the Kazakov&#x27;s books of short stories is &quot;Poedemte v Lopshengu&quot; — Let us go to Lopshenga; Lopshenga is a selo on the White Sea coast.

Some of the Nenets authors lived in Nenets Autonomous Okrug. In particular, Tyko Vylka was born in Novaya Zemlya and was even the chairman of the Novaya Zemlya Island Soviet. Vasily Ledkov lived in Naryan Mar.

One sport in which the oblast achieved prominence is bandy. The Vodnik Bandy Club from Arkhangelsk has become the Russian champion nine times (1996–2000 and 2002–2005) and won the Bandy World Cup in 2003 and 2004. Arkhangelsk hosted the 1999 Bandy World Championship and the same in 2003.

==Emergency handling==
In 1998, the Arkhangelsk Regional Rescue Service was established by the governor. The responsibility of the Rescue Service is to handle emergency situations, such as forest fires.

Polar bears are entering into human-occupied areas more frequently than in the past due to climate change effects. Global warming reduces sea-ice, forcing bears to come in to land to find food. An invasion of polar bears took place in February 2019 in northeastern Novaya Zemlya, with dozens of polar bears seen entering homes, public buildings, and inhabited areas. Arkhangelsk regional authorities declared a state of emergency.

<text>Quercus virginiana, also known as the southern live oak, is an evergreen oak tree endemic to the Southeastern United States. Though many other species are loosely called live oak, the southern live oak is particularly iconic of the Old South. Many very large and old specimens of live oak can be found today in the Deep South region of the United States.

== Description ==

Although live oaks retain their leaves nearly year-round, they are not true evergreens. Live oaks drop their leaves immediately before new leaves emerge in the spring. Occasionally, senescing leaves may turn yellow or contain brown spots in the winter, leading to the mistaken belief that the tree has oak wilt, whose symptoms typically occur in the summer. A live oak&#x27;s defoliation may occur sooner in marginal climates or in dry or cold winters.

The bark is dark, thick, and furrowed longitudinally. The leaves are stiff and leathery, with the tops shiny dark green and the bottoms pale gray and very tightly tomentose, simple and typically flattish with bony-opaque margins, with a length of and a width of , borne alternately. The male flowers are green hanging catkins with lengths of . The acorns are small, , oblong in shape (ovoid or oblong-ellipsoid), shiny and tan-brown to nearly black, often black at the tips, and borne singly or in clusters.
Depending on the growing conditions, live oaks vary from a shrub-size to large and spreading tree-size: typical open-grown trees reach in height, with a limb spread of nearly . Their lower limbs often sweep down towards the ground before curving up again. They can grow at severe angles; Native Americans used to bend saplings over so that they would grow at extreme angles, to serve as trail markers.

The southern live oak has a deep taproot that anchors it when young and eventually develops into an extensive and widespread root system. This, along with its low center of gravity and other factors, makes the southern live oak extremely resistant to strong sustained winds, such as those seen in hurricanes.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Quercus virginiana&quot; is placed in the southern live oaks section of the genus &quot;Quercus&quot; (section &quot;Virentes&quot;).

A large number of common names are used for this tree, including &quot;Virginia live oak&quot;, &quot;bay live oak&quot;, &quot;scrub live oak&quot;, &quot;plateau oak&quot;, &quot;plateau live oak&quot;, &quot;escarpment live oak&quot;, and (in Spanish) &quot;roble&quot;. It is also often just called &quot;live oak&quot; within its native area, but the full name &quot;southern live oak&quot; helps to distinguish it from other live oaks, a general term for any evergreen species of oak.

This profusion of common names partly reflects an ongoing controversy about the classification of various live oaks, in particular its near relatives. Some authors recognize as distinct species the forms others consider to be varieties of &quot;Quercus virginiana&quot;. Notably, the following two taxa, treated as species in the &quot;Flora of North America&quot;, are treated as varieties of southern live oak by the United States Forest Service: the escarpment live oak, &quot;Quercus fusiformis&quot; (&quot;Q. virginiana&quot; var. &quot;fusiformis&quot;) and
the sand live oak, &quot;Quercus geminata&quot; (&quot;Q. virginiana&quot; var. &quot;geminata&quot;).

Matters are further complicated by southern live oaks hybridizing with both of the above two species, and also with the dwarf live oak (&quot;Q. minima&quot;), swamp white oak (&quot;Q. bicolor&quot;), Durand oak (&quot;Q. durandii&quot;), overcup oak (&quot;Q. lyrata&quot;), bur oak (&quot;Q. macrocarpa&quot;), and post oak (&quot;Q. stellata&quot;).

==Distribution and habitat==

Live oak can be found in the wild growing and reproducing on the lower coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico and lower East Coast of the United States. Its native range begins in southeast Virginia, and then continues south in a narrow band through North Carolina along the coast to the interior South Carolina coast, where its range begins to expand farther inland. The range of live oak continues to expand inland as it moves south, growing across southern Georgia and covering all of Florida south to the northernmost Florida Keys. Live oak grows along the Florida panhandle to Mobile Bay, then westward across the southernmost two tiers of counties in Mississippi. Live oak grows across the southern third of Louisiana, except for some barrier islands and scattered parts of the most southern parishes. Live oak&#x27;s range continues into Texas and narrows to hug the coast until just past Port Lavaca, Texas.

There is a misconception that the southern live oak reaches its northwestern limit in the granite massifs and canyons in Southwestern Oklahoma. However, this actually belongs to the closely related and much more cold-hardy Escarpment Live Oak (&quot;Quercus fusiformis&quot;), a rare remnant from the last glaciation also found around Norman, Oklahoma.

Along the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic United States, live oak is found in both single and mixed species forests, dotting the savannas, and as occasional clumps in the grasslands along the lower coastal plain. Live oak grows in soils ranging from heavy textures (clay loams), to sands with layers of organic materials or fine particles. Live oak can be found dominating some maritime forests, especially where fire periodicity and duration are limited. Live oak is found on higher topographic sites as well as hammocks in marshes and swamps. In general, southern live oak hugs the coastline and is rarely found more than above sea level. Live oaks grow across a wide range of sites with many moisture regimes – ranging from dry to moist. Live oak will survive well on both dry sites and in wet areas, effectively handling short duration flooding if water is moving and drainage is good. Good soil drainage is a key resource component for sustained live oak growth. The usual precipitation range is of water per year, preferably in spring and summer. Soil is usually acidic, ranging between pH of 5.5 and 6.5. A live oak on Tyler Avenue in Annapolis, Maryland or one on Cherrywood Lane in Bowie, Maryland is the northernmost known mature specimen, although a number of saplings can be found growing around nearby Towson. Multiple healthy young examples can be found in the Bolton Hill neighborhood of Baltimore.

== Ecology ==
One source states that the southern live oak responds &quot;with vigorous growth to plentiful moisture on well-drained soil.&quot; They tend to survive fire, because often a fire will not reach their crowns. Even if a tree is burned, its crowns and roots usually survive the fire and sprout vigorously. Furthermore, live oak forests discourage entry of fire from adjacent communities because they provide dense cover that discourages the growth of a flammable understory. They can withstand occasional floods and hurricanes, and are resistant to salt spray and moderate soil salinity. Although they grow best in well-drained sandy soils and loams, they will also grow in clay.

The branches frequently support other plant species such as rounded clumps of ball moss (&quot;Tillandsia recurvata&quot;), thick drapings of Spanish moss (&quot;Tillandsia usneoides&quot;), resurrection fern (&quot;Pleopeltis polypodioides&quot;), and parasitic mistletoe.

== Cultivation ==
Southern live oak is cultivated in warmer climates as a specimen tree or for shade in the southern United States (zone 8 and south), Nuevo León and Tamaulipas states in Mexico, and in the warmer parts of the United States, Europe, and Australia. Cultivation is relatively simple, as southern live oak seedlings grow fast with ample soil moisture. Planting depth has little effect on the success of the tree. After a few years live oak needs only occasional supplemental water. Southern live oak is very long lived, and there are many specimens that are more than 400 years old in the deep southern United States. The southern live oak is reliably hardy to USDA Hardiness Zone 8a, which places its northern limit for long-term cultivation inland around Atlanta, Memphis, and Washington, D.C.

== Uses ==
Live oak wood is hard, heavy, and difficult to work with, but very strong. In the days of wooden ships, live oaks were the preferred source of the framework timbers of the ship, using the natural trunk and branch angles for their strength. The frame of was constructed from southern live oak wood harvested from St. Simons Island, Georgia, and the density of the wood grain allowed it to survive cannon fire, thus earning her the nickname &quot;Old Ironsides&quot;. Even today, the U.S. Navy continues to own extensive live oak tracts.

The primary uses for southern live oaks today are providing food and shelter for wildlife. Among the animals for which live oak acorns are an important food source are the bobwhite quail, the threatened Florida scrub jay, the wood duck, yellow-bellied sapsucker, wild turkey, black bear, various species of squirrel, and the white-tailed deer. The tree crown is very dense, making it valuable for shade, and the species provides nest sites for many mammal species. Native Americans extracted a cooking oil from the acorns, used all parts of live oak for medicinal purposes, leaves for making rugs, and bark for dyes. The roots of seedlings sometimes form starchy, edible tubers. People in past centuries harvested and fried these tubers for human consumption much as one might use a potato.

In 1937, the southern live oak was designated the official state tree of Georgia (U.S. state).

<text>Kholmogory () is a historic rural locality (a &quot;selo&quot;) and the administrative center of Kholmogorsky District of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia. It lies on the left bank of the Northern Dvina, along the Kholmogory Highway, southeast of Arkhangelsk and north of the Antonievo-Siysky Monastery. The name is derived from the Finnish &quot;Kalmomäki&quot; for &quot;corpse hill&quot; (&quot;cemetery&quot;). Population: 

The Kholmogory area was at first in historical times inhabited by the Finno-Ugrians &quot;Zavolochskaya Chud&quot;, (i.e. &quot;the Chud [who live] beyond the portage&quot;), known also as Yems in old Novgorod chronicles, and Karelians. The first Slavonic population to enter Kalmamäki were Pomors from Vologda area after 1220. As early as the 14th century, the village (the name of which was then spelled &quot;Kolmogory&quot;) was an important trading post of the Novgorod Republic in the Far North of Russia. Its commercial importance further increased in 1554 when the English Muscovy Company made it a center of its operations in furs. The Polish-Lithuanian irregular forces known as Lisowczycy besieged the wooden fort during the Time of Troubles (1613), but had to retreat in failure.

==Exile and prison camps==
During the 17th and 18th centuries, the settlement was also a place of exile, notably for ex-regent Anna Leopoldovna and her children including Ivan VI. The use of the location for political prisoners was revived by Mikhail Kedrov, after he was appointed Cheka plenipotentiary for the region. He turned the Kholmogory prison camp into a death camp where mass executions of former officers of the White Army and others he deemed to be political opponents of the Bolshevik regime. The death toll was so large and Kedrov&#x27;s behaviour so cruel that he was relieved of his duties and put in psychiatric care.

==Cathedral==
In 1682, the six-pillared Kholmogory cathedral was consecrated; the biggest in the region. It was disfigured by the Communists in the 1930s. Many ancient wooden shrines and mills, however, still survive in the neighborhood. One of the nearby villages is the birthplace of the Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov. Local artisans—such as Fedot Shubin—have been famed for their craft of carving the tusks of mammoths and walruses.

In Kholmogory, a craft of Kholmogory bone carving was developed in the 17th century. The bone carvings from Kholmogory were notable for excellent craftsmanship and perfected technique. The best carving masters from Kholmogory were invited to work in the Kremlin Armoury, which performed orders for the tsar&#x27;s court. The handicraft reached its peak under the reign of Peter the Great. Currently the carving is being performed at the Lomonosov Bone Carving Factory.

<text>IBM System R is a database system built as a research project at IBM&#x27;s San Jose Research Laboratory beginning in 1974. System R was a seminal project: it was the first implementation of SQL, which has since become the standard relational data query language. It was also the first system to demonstrate that a relational database management system could provide good transaction processing performance. Design decisions in System R, as well as some fundamental algorithm choices (such as the dynamic programming algorithm used in query optimization), influenced many later relational systems.

System R&#x27;s first customer was Pratt &amp; Whitney in 1977.

<doc id="472802" wikidata="Q900665" url="?curid=472802" title="Tōhoku Shinkansen">
<text>The is a Japanese high-speed Shinkansen rail line that runs through the more sparsely populated Tōhoku region of Japan&#x27;s main island, Honshu. Operated by the East Japan Railway Company, it links Tokyo in the south to Aomori in the north, with stops in population centers such as Morioka, Koriyama, Fukushima, Hachinohe, and Sendai. With a route length of , it is Japan&#x27;s longest Shinkansen line. It also has the highest operating speeds on the Shinkansen network, reaching a maximum of on a section between Utsunomiya and Morioka.

The first section of the Tōhoku Shinkansen opened in 1982 between Ōmiya and Morioka, with additional sections gradually built over the following decades; the final section between Hachinohe and Shin-Aomori was completed in 2010. A continuation of the line opened as the Hokkaido Shinkansen in 2016, which links Shin-Aomori to Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto via the Seikan Tunnel. The Tōhoku Shinkansen also has two Mini-Shinkansen branch lines, the Yamagata Shinkansen and Akita Shinkansen. Future plans include ongoing upgrade work to increase operating speeds throughout the line.

Four services currently operate on the Tōhoku Shinkansen, the all-stop &quot;Nasuno&quot;, and the limited-stop &quot;Yamabiko&quot;, &quot;Hayate&quot;, and &quot;Hayabusa&quot;, with the latter two providing through service onto the Hokkaido Shinkansen. As of 2021, the fastest travel times between Tokyo and Shin-Aomori are on the &quot;Hayabusa&quot; service, at 2 hours and 58 minutes. The Mini-Shinkansen also provides through service from Tokyo via the Tōhoku Shinkansen; typically, &quot;Tsubasa&quot; and &quot;Komachi&quot; trains are coupled to &quot;Hayabusa,&quot; &quot;Yamabiko,&quot; or &quot;Nasuno&quot; trains at Tokyo and are decoupled at Fukushima and Morioka respectively, where they continue on to their Mini-Shinkansen lines.

==Services==
There are four services in operation:
* &quot;Hayabusa&quot;, Tokyo – Shin-Aomori/Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto limited-stop, starting 5 March 2011
* &quot;Hayate&quot;, Morioka/Shin-Aomori – Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto limited-stop, starting 26 March 2016 (the name has been in use since 1 December 2002)
* &quot;Yamabiko&quot;, Tokyo – Sendai limited-stop, and all-stations to Morioka, starting June 1982
* &quot;Nasuno&quot;, Tokyo – Oyama/Nasushiobara/Kōriyama all-stations, starting 1995
One service has been discontinued:
* &quot;Aoba&quot;, Tokyo – Sendai all-stations, June 1982 – October 1997 (consolidated with &quot;Nasuno&quot;)

Through trains on the Akita Shinkansen and Yamagata Shinkansen lines also run on Tōhoku Shinkansen tracks from Morioka and Fukushima respectively.

As of March 2021, the maximum line speed is between Tokyo and Ueno, between Ueno and Ōmiya, between Ōmiya and Utsunomiya, between Utsunomiya and Morioka, and between Morioka and Shin-Aomori.

On 30 October 2012, JR East announced that it is pursuing research and development to increase speeds to on the Tohoku Shinkansen. Work seems to be ongoing to upgrade the section between Morioka and Shin-Aomori to , primarily in the form of improved sound barriers. This should make operating at possible, if the improved noise dampening techniques being tested using the ALFA-X test train are successful. Upgrade works on this section started in October 2020, and are expected to take seven years to complete.

===Timeline===
==History==
* 28 November 1971: Construction starts on the line.
* 23 June 1982: The – section opens.
* 14 March 1985: The – section opens.
* 20 June 1991: The – section opens.
* October 1998: 1 billionth passenger carried on Tōhoku, Joetsu and Nagano Shinkansen lines.
* 1 December 2002: The – section opens.

* 4 December 2010: The extension from Hachinohe to Shin-Aomori opens.
* 5 March 2011: New &quot;Hayabusa&quot; services operating at commence operation between Tokyo and Shin-Aomori using new E5 series trainsets.
* 23 June 2012: The line&#x27;s 30th anniversary was celebrated, with approximately 1.93 billion passengers having been transported on the line.

From Shin-Aomori, the line continues to Shin-Hakodate in Hokkaido (, since March 26, 2016 under the name Hokkaido Shinkansen), passing through the world&#x27;s longest undersea railway tunnel, the Seikan Tunnel. A further to Sapporo is due to open by 2030.

The mountainous terrain that the line passes through has necessitated heavy reliance on tunnels. The Iwate-Ichinohe Tunnel on the Morioka–Hachinohe stretch, completed in 2000, was briefly the world&#x27;s longest land rail tunnel at , but in 2005 it was superseded by the Hakkōda Tunnel on the extension to Aomori, at . In 2007 the Lötschberg Base Tunnel (), and in 2010 the Gotthard Base Tunnel (, bored through and due in service by 2016) in Switzerland superseded both.

===2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami===
On the afternoon of 11 March 2011, services on the Tohoku Shinkansen were suspended as a result of the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. JR East estimated that around 1,100 repairs would be required for the line between Omiya and Iwate-Numakunai, ranging from collapsed station roofs to bent power pylons.

Limited service on the line was restored in segments: Tokyo to was re-opened on 15 March, and Morioka to Shin-Aomori was re-opened on 22 March. The line between Morioka and Ichinoseki re-opened on 7 April, Nasushiobara and Fukushima on 12 April, and the rest of the line on or around 30 April, although not at full speed or a full schedule. The trains returned to full-speed operations on 23 September 2011.

=== 2021 Tohoku earthquake ===
A magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the Tohoku area approximately east of Namie on the evening of 13 February 2021. Following the quake, infrastructure damage was discovered between Shin-Shirakawa and Furukawa stations.

East Japan Railway closed the Tohoku Shinkansen between Nasushiobara and Morioka. The section between Ichinoseki and Morioka re-opened on 16 February, Sendai and Ichinoseki on 22 February, and the remaining section between Nasushiobara and Sendai on 24 February. Trains operated at 80% the usual timetable with top speeds reduced until 26 March, when repairs were completed and the normal timetable was restored.

==Special event train services==

===25th anniversary===

On 23 June 2007, 10-car set K47 was used for a special &quot;Yamabiko&quot; 931 service from Omiya to Morioka to mark the 25th anniversary of the opening of the Tohoku Shinkansen.

===30th anniversary===
On 23 June 2012, 10-car set K47 was used for a special &quot;Yamabiko&quot; 235 service from Omiya to Morioka to mark the 30th anniversary of the opening of the Tohoku Shinkansen.

<text>A system programming language is a programming language used for system programming; such languages are designed for writing system software, which usually requires different development approaches when compared with application software. Edsger Dijkstra referred to these languages as machine oriented high order languages, or mohol.

General-purpose programming languages tend to focus on generic features to allow programs written in the language to use the same code on different platforms. Examples of such languages include ALGOL and Pascal. This generic quality typically comes at the cost of denying direct access to the machine&#x27;s internal workings, and this often has negative effects on performance.

System languages, in contrast, are designed not for compatibility, but for performance and ease of access to the underlying hardware while still providing high-level programming concepts like structured programming. Examples include ESPOL and SPL, both of which are similar to ALGOL in syntax but tuned to their respective platforms. Others are cross-platform but designed to work close to the hardware, like BLISS, JOVIAL and BCPL.

Some languages straddle the system and application domains, bridging the gap between these uses. The canonical example is C, which is used widely for both system and application programming. Some modern languages also do this such as Rust and Swift.

== Features ==
In contrast with application languages, system programming languages typically offer more-direct access to the physical hardware of the machine: an archetypical system programming language in this sense was BCPL. System programming languages often lack built-in input/output (I/O) facilities because a system-software project usually develops its own I/O mechanisms or builds on basic monitor I/O or screen management facilities. The distinction between languages used for system programming and application programming became blurred over time with the widespread popularity of PL/I, C and Pascal.

== History ==
The earliest system software was written in assembly language primarily because there was no alternative, but also for reasons including efficiency of object code, compilation time, and ease of debugging. Application languages such as FORTRAN were used for system programming, although they usually still required some routines to be written in assembly language.

===Mid-level languages===
Mid-level languages &quot;have much of the syntax and facilities of a higher level language, but also provide direct access in the language (as well as providing assembly language) to machine features.&quot; The earliest of these was ESPOL on Burroughs mainframes in about 1960, followed by Niklaus Wirth&#x27;s PL360 (first written on a Burroughs system as a cross compiler), which had the general syntax of ALGOL 60 but whose statements directly manipulated CPU registers and memory. Other languages in this category include MOL-360 and PL/S.

As an example, a typical PL360 statement is codice_1, signifying that registers 8 and 7 should be and&#x27;ed together, the result shifted left 8 bits, the result of that or&#x27;ed with the contents of register 6, and the final result placed into register 9.

===Higher-level languages===
While PL360 is at the semantic level of assembly language, another kind of system programming language operates at a higher semantic level, but has specific extensions designed to make the language suitable for system programming. An early example of this kind of language is LRLTRAN, which extended Fortran with features for character and bit manipulation, pointers, and directly addressed jump tables.

Subsequently, languages such as C were developed, where the combination of features was sufficient to write system software, and a compiler could be developed that generated efficient object programs on modest hardware. Such a language generally omits features that cannot be implemented efficiently, and adds a small number of machine-dependent features needed to access specific hardware abilities; inline assembly code, such as C&#x27;s statement, is often used for this purpose. Although many such languages were developed, C and C++ are the ones which survived.

<text>Mitchell William Miller (July 4, 1911 – July 31, 2010) was an American choral conductor, record producer, record-industry executive, and professional oboist. He was involved in almost all aspects of the industry, particularly as a conductor and artists and repertoire (A&amp;R) man. Miller was one of the most influential people in American popular music during the 1950s and early 1960s, both as the head of A&amp;R at Columbia Records and as a best-selling recording artist with an NBC television series, &quot;Sing Along with Mitch&quot;. A graduate of the Eastman School of Music of the University of Rochester in the early 1930s, Miller began his musical career as a player of the oboe and English horn, making numerous highly regarded classical and popular recordings.

==Early life==
Mitchell William Miller was born to a Jewish family in Rochester, New York, on July 4, 1911. His mother was Hinda (Rosenblum) Miller, a former seamstress, and his father, Abram Calmen Miller, a Russian-Jewish immigrant wrought-iron worker. Mitch had four siblings, two of whom, Leon and Joseph, survived him. He attended East High School.

==Career==

===Classical and jazz oboe===
Miller took up the oboe at first as a teenager, because it was the only instrument available when he went to audition for his junior high school orchestra. After graduating from East High School he attended the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, where he met and became a lifelong friend of Goddard Lieberson, who became president of the CBS music group in 1956.

After graduating from Eastman, Miller played with the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra and then moved to New York City, where he was a member of the Alec Wilder Octet (1938–41 and occasionally later), as well as performing with David Mannes, Andre Kostelanetz, Percy Faith, George Gershwin, and Charlie Parker. He worked with Frank Sinatra on the 1946 recording of &quot;Frank Sinatra Conducts the Music of Alec Wilder&quot;.

Miller played the English horn part in the Largo movement of Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;New World Symphony&quot; in a 1947 recording conducted by Leopold Stokowski. In 1948 he performed Mozart&#x27;s Oboe Concerto in C major with the CBS Symphony Orchestra conducted by Alfredo Antonini in a broadcast for Voice of America.

Miller gave the American premiere of Richard Strauss&#x27;s Oboe Concerto in a 1948 radio broadcast. Strauss had originally assigned rights to the premiere to John de Lancie, who gave him the idea for the concerto while stationed near Strauss&#x27;s villa in Garmisch. However, since meeting the composer, de Lancie had won a section oboist position with the Philadelphia Orchestra, and as a junior player to the orchestra&#x27;s principal oboist Marcel Tabuteau was unable to fulfill Strauss&#x27;s wishes. De Lancie then gave the rights for the premiere to Miller.

As part of the CBS Symphony, Miller participated in the musical accompaniment on the 1938 radio broadcast of Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Mercury Theater on the Air&quot; production of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. He also performed in Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 in C minor.

===A&amp;R man===
Miller joined Mercury Records as a classical music producer and served as the head of Artists and Repertoire (A&amp;R) at Mercury in the late 1940s, and then joined Columbia Records in the same capacity in 1950. This was a pivotal position in a recording company, because the A&amp;R executive decided which musicians and songs would be recorded and promoted by that particular record label.

He defined the Columbia style through the early 1960s, signing and producing many important pop standards artists for Columbia, including Johnnie Ray, Percy Faith, Ray Conniff, Jimmy Boyd, Johnny Mathis, Tony Bennett, and Guy Mitchell (whose pseudonym was based on Miller&#x27;s first name).

After arriving at Columbia, Miller enticed Frankie Laine to join the label after his early successes at Mercury. Miller helped direct the careers of artists who were already signed to the label, such as Doris Day, Dinah Shore, and Jo Stafford. Miller also discovered Aretha Franklin, and signed her to the first major recording contract of her career. She left Columbia after five years, when Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records promised Franklin artistic freedom to create records outside the pop mainstream in a more rhythm-and-blues-driven direction.

Mitch Miller disapproved of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll—one of his contemporaries described his denunciation of it as &quot;The Gettysburg Address of Music&quot;—and passed not only on Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly, who became stars on RCA and Coral, respectively, but on The Beatles as well, creating a fortune in revenue for rival Capitol. Previously, Miller had offered Presley a contract but balked at the amount Presley&#x27;s manager, Colonel Tom Parker, was asking. However, in 1958 he signed Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins, two of Presley&#x27;s contemporaries at Sun Records.

According to former &quot;Newsweek&quot; music critic Karen Schoemer, Miller&#x27;s refusal to record in the genre was also due to his fear that the label, and its corporate parent CBS, would be implicated in the scandal surrounding payola if he did so, remarking: I knew what was going on—everybody in the business knew what was going on. You had to pay to play.

In defense of his anti-rock stance, he once told &quot;NME&quot; in January 1958: &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll is musical baby food: it is the worship of mediocrity, brought about by a passion for conformity.&quot;

Despite his distaste for rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, Miller emphasized emotional expression over vocal perfection and often produced records for Columbia artists that were rockish in nature. Two examples are &quot;A White Sport Coat (and a Pink Carnation)&quot; by Marty Robbins and &quot;Rock-a-Billy&quot; by Guy Mitchell.

===Record producer===
As a record producer, Miller gained a reputation for both innovation and gimmickry. Although he oversaw dozens of chart hits, his relentlessly cheery arrangements and his penchant for novelty material—for example, &quot;Come On-a My House&quot; (Rosemary Clooney), &quot;Mama Will Bark&quot; (Frank Sinatra and Dagmar)—have drawn criticism from some admirers of traditional pop music. Music historian Will Friedwald wrote in his book &quot;Jazz Singing&quot; thatMiller exemplified the worst in American pop. He first aroused the ire of intelligent listeners by trying to turn—and darn near succeeding in turning—great artists like Sinatra, Clooney, and Tony Bennett into hacks. Miller chose the worst songs and put together the worst backings imaginable—not with the hit-or-miss attitude that bad musicians traditionally used, but with insight, forethought, careful planning, and perverted brilliance.

At the same time, Friedwald acknowledges Miller&#x27;s great influence on later popular music production:

Miller established the primacy of the producer, proving that even more than the artist, the accompaniment, or the material, it was the responsibility of the man in the recording booth whether a record flew or flopped. Miller also conceived the idea of the pop record &quot;sound&quot; per se: not so much an arrangement or a tune, but an aural texture (usually replete with extramusical gimmicks) that could be created in the studio and then replicated in live performance, instead of the other way around. Miller was hardly a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roller, yet without these ideas there could never have been rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. &quot;Mule Train&quot;, Miller&#x27;s first major hit (for Frankie Laine) and the foundation of his career, set the pattern for virtually the entire first decade of rock. The similarities between it and, say, &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot;, need hardly be outlined here.

While some of Columbia&#x27;s performers, including Harry James, Frank Sinatra, and Rosemary Clooney, resented Miller&#x27;s methods, the label maintained a high release-to-hit ratio during the 1950s. Sinatra particularly blamed his temporary fall from popularity while at Columbia on Miller; the crooner felt that he was forced by Miller to record material like &quot;Mama Will Bark&quot; and &quot;The Hucklebuck&quot;. Miller countered that Sinatra&#x27;s contract gave him the right to refuse any song.

===Recording artist===

In the early 1950s, Miller recorded with Columbia&#x27;s house band as &quot;Mitchell Miller and His Orchestra.&quot; He also recorded a string of successful albums and singles, featuring a male chorale and his own arrangements, under the name &quot;Mitch Miller and the Gang&quot; beginning in 1950. The ensemble&#x27;s hits included &quot;The Children&#x27;s Marching Song&quot; (more commonly known as &quot;This Old Man&quot;), &quot;Tzena, Tzena, Tzena&quot;, and &quot;The Yellow Rose of Texas&quot;, which topped the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, sold over one million copies in the United States alone, and reached No. 2 on the UK singles chart. Miller&#x27;s medley of the two marches from &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, &quot;The River Kwai March&quot; and &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot;, lasted 29 weeks on the Billboard pop charts in 1958, longer than any other record completely within that year.

In 1957, Miller&#x27;s orchestra and chorus recorded &quot;U.S. Air Force Blue&quot;, a United States Air Force recruiting song. He and his orchestra also recorded children&#x27;s music for the Golden Records label. A choral group called The Sandpiper Singers provided the vocals for these recordings, including an album of Mother Goose nursery rhymes.

In 1961, Miller also provided two choral tracks set to Dimitri Tiomkin&#x27;s title music on the soundtrack to &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;. Followed by the theme of &quot;The Longest Day&quot; over the end credits in 1962 and the &quot;Major Dundee March&quot;, the theme song to Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s 1965 &quot;Major Dundee&quot;. Though the film was a boxoffice bomb, the song remained popular for years.

In 1987, Miller conducted the London Symphony Orchestra with pianist David Golub in a well-received recording of Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;An American in Paris&quot;, &quot;Concerto in F&quot; and &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;. What made this recording special was that it was produced using the original sheet music that was handed out by Gershwin to his band for an early U.S. tour, along with Gershwin&#x27;s performance directions as noted by then band member Miller.

===&quot;Sing Along with Mitch&quot;===

Initially airing as a one-shot episode of the NBC television show &quot;Startime&quot; (season 1, episode 32) on May 24, 1960, &quot;Sing Along with Mitch&quot; went on to become a weekly series in 1961 as a community sing-along program hosted by Mitch Miller and featuring a male chorus. The program, videotaped in New York, was basically an extension of Miller&#x27;s series of Columbia &quot;Sing Along with Mitch&quot; record albums. In keeping with the show&#x27;s title, viewers were presented with lyrics at the bottom of the television screen at the beginning and ending of each episode. While many insist there was a bouncing ball to keep time, Miller correctly said this was something they remembered from movie theater &quot;Screen Songs&quot; and &quot;Song Car-Tunes&quot; sing-along cartoons. 

Each weekly episode concluded with the same abruptly-ending nonsense choral song, to the tune of The Stars and Stripes Forever:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Be kind to your web-footed friends,
For a duck may be somebody&#x27;s mother.
Be kind to your friends in the swamp,
Where the weather is very, very domp.
Now, you may think that this is the end,
Well, it is!&lt;/poem&gt;

Singer Leslie Uggams, pianist Dick Hyman, accordionist Dominic Cortese, and the singing Quinto Sisters were regularly featured on &quot;Sing Along with Mitch&quot;. One of the tenors in Miller&#x27;s chorale, Bob McGrath, later went on to a long and successful career on the PBS children&#x27;s show &quot;Sesame Street&quot; (he was a founding member of the &quot;human&quot; cast in 1969 and McGrath became its longest-serving cast member until his enforced retirement in 2016).

&quot;Sing Along with Mitch&quot; occasionally featured celebrity guests who would appear throughout the hour, and whose repertoire would be worked into the episode&#x27;s list of songs: George Burns, Milton Berle, and Shirley Temple among them. The show also offered cameos by uncredited celebrities not necessarily known for their singing ability, who were either visiting or working in New York. These surprise guests were dressed like the male chorus members and hidden among them for the closing sing-along, including Johnny Carson, Jerry Lewis, Wally Cox, Buddy Hackett, and Joe E. Ross (in his police uniform from the &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; sitcom).

As the popularity of the TV show rose, Miller continued to produce and record several &quot;Sing Along with Mitch&quot; record albums, complete with tear-out lyric sheets. The album series ultimately comprised 20 titles, released from 1958 to 1963.

&quot;Sing Along with Mitch&quot; ran on television from 1961 until the network canceled it in 1964, a victim of changing musical tastes. Selected repeats aired briefly on NBC during the spring of 1966. The show&#x27;s primary audience was over the age of 40 and it did not gain the favor of advertisers targeting the youth market. Miller&#x27;s lawyers continued to defend his Sing-Along trademark for years, even down to the level of a small community theater advertising a sing-along &quot;Mikado&quot; in 1997.

Miller left Columbia Records in 1965 and joined MCA Inc. as a consultant, signing the same year with MCA&#x27;s Decca Records subsidiary.

In later years, Miller carried on the sing-along tradition, leading crowds in song in personal appearances. For several years, Miller was featured in a popular series of Christmas festivities in New Bedford, Massachusetts, leading large crowds singing carols. Miller hosted a 1981 TV reunion of the Sing Along Gang for NBC (featuring veterans from the original gang, including Bob McGrath, Andy Love, Paul Friesen, Victor Griffin, and Dominic Cortese). Miller also appeared as host of two PBS television specials, &quot;Keep America Singing&quot; (1994) and &quot;Voices In Harmony&quot; (1996), featuring champion quartets and choruses of SPEBSQSA and Sweet Adelines International. He also appeared conducting regional orchestras and filled in many times as guest conductor of the Boston Pops orchestra.

===Conducting style, and parodies===
At his first rehearsal for television, Miller took his position in front of the chorus and began conducting in the usual choirmaster manner: arms outstretched with hands gesturing, so the singers could see his signals. The TV director stopped him, objecting that Miller&#x27;s arms were out of the camera&#x27;s range and could not be seen on the television screen. Miller pulled his arms closer to his body, but the director stopped him once more. It was not until Miller&#x27;s elbows were almost touching his body, and his arms extremely restricted, that the director was satisfied. Miller dutifully adopted the jerky, confined style of conducting and kept it for the duration of the series.

The rigid format of &quot;Sing Along with Mitch&quot; lent itself to parodies. Steve Allen once performed a pointed satire, with the comedian made up as Miller and robotically bending his arms &quot;à la&quot; Miller while conducting. The sketch spoofed the show&#x27;s production values, including cameras panning among the vocalists, going out of control and knocking them over, then chasing Allen out of the studio and onto the roof. Ross Bagdasarian produced an animated spoof in a segment of &quot;The Alvin Show&quot;, with the David Seville character conducting Alvin and the Chipmunks in Miller&#x27;s herky-jerky style, singing &quot;Down in the Valley&quot; while scrambled lyrics appeared on-screen. Stan Freberg, who had previously recorded &quot;Wunnerful! Wunnerful!&quot;, a scathing satire of &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;, presented an equally brutal satire of the show, &quot;Sing Along with Freeb&quot;, on his February 1962 ABC special, &quot;The Chun King Chow Mein Hour&quot;. Jonathan and Darlene Edwards (Paul Weston and Jo Stafford) produced an entire album (&quot;Sing Along with Jonathan and Darlene Edwards,&quot; 1962) of sing-along in the Miller style but deliberately off-key, which supposedly greatly angered Miller. On the cartoon series &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, Fred and Barney appeared on the &quot;Hum Along with Herman&quot; show (for people who do not know the words), another satire of Miller&#x27;s show. Bigtop Records in 1963 released a record by The Dellwoods and under the aegis of &quot;Mad&quot;, titled &quot;Fink Along with Mad&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Miller was married for 65 years to the former Frances Alexander, who died in 2000. They had two daughters, a son, two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. His son, Mike (Mitchell) Miller Jr., is a respected children&#x27;s book illustrator who featured in several of Jack Sendak&#x27;s books.

Miller lived in New York City for many years, where he died on July 31, 2010, after a short illness, nearly four weeks after his 99th birthday.

<text>Brazil Red (; ) is a 2001 French historical novel by Jean-Christophe Rufin which recounts the unsuccessful French attempt to conquer Brazil in the 16th century, against a background of wars of religion and a rite-of-passage discovery of the charms and secrets of the Amerindian world. It won the 2001 Prix Goncourt.

==Plot==
The plot is set in 1555, on a small island in the Guanabara Bay of Rio de Janeiro, where a French expeditionary force, made up of sailors, craftsmen, priests, ex-convicts and a knight, has just landed. Their objective is twofold: on the one hand, to set up a French colony on this far-off continent to compete with the Portuguese, on the other hand, to convert the Indigenous population to Christianity. Ill-prepared for the realities of the New World and torn apart by theological controversy (which sets the Catholics and Calvinists among them against one another), the French see their dreams of colonization gradually dissipate.

<doc id="472823" wikidata="Q4050521" url="?curid=472823" title="Syskey">
<text>The SAM Lock Tool, better known as Syskey (the name of its executable file), is a discontinued component of Windows NT that encrypts the Security Account Manager (SAM) database using a 128-bit RC4 encryption key.

Introduced in the Q143475 hotfix for Windows NT 4.0 SP3, the tool was removed in Windows 10&#x27;s Fall Creators Update in 2017 because its method of cryptography is considered insecure by modern standards and the fact that the tool has been widely employed in scams as a form of ransomware. Microsoft officially recommended use of BitLocker disk encryption as an alternative.

==History==
Introduced in the Q143475 hotfix included in Windows NT 4.0 SP3, Syskey was intended to protect against offline password cracking attacks by preventing the possessor of an unauthorized copy of the SAM file from extracting useful information from it.

Syskey can optionally be configured to require the user to enter the key during boot (as a startup password) or to load the key onto removable storage media (e.g., a floppy disk or USB flash drive).

In mid-2017, Microsoft removed syskey.exe from future versions of Windows. Microsoft recommends using &quot;BitLocker or similar technologies instead of the syskey.exe utility.&quot;

==Security issues==

===The &quot;Syskey Bug&quot;===
In December 1999, a security team from BindView found a security hole in Syskey that indicated that a certain form of offline cryptanalytic attack is possible, making a brute force attack appear to be possible. Microsoft later issued a fix for the problem (dubbed the &quot;Syskey Bug&quot;). The bug affected both Windows NT 4.0 and pre-RC3 versions of Windows 2000.

===Use as ransomware===
Syskey is commonly abused by technical support scammers to lock victims out of their own computers in order to coerce them into paying a ransom.

<doc id="472824" wikidata="Q883217" url="?curid=472824" title="James Iredell Jr.">
<text>James Iredell Jr. (November 2, 1788 – April 13, 1853) was the 23rd Governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina between 1827 and 1828.

==Early life==
Iredell was born in Chowan County, North Carolina. He was the son of well-known parents: his father, James Iredell, was a statesman and U.S. Supreme Court justice, and his mother was the sister of former Governor Samuel Johnston. In 1806, young Iredell graduated from the College of New Jersey (today Princeton University).

On his way toward political prominence, Iredell commanded a company of volunteers during the War of 1812, practiced law in Chowan County, served in the state House of Commons, as a representative from Edenton, and was appointed a Superior Court judge.

Iredell kept a diary, which was rare among the North Carolina gentry at that time and provides researchers with a glimpse into the life of that time period.

==Governor and U.S. Senator==
During his short term as governor, he pushed for better infrastructure and education. Reacting to an interest of the day—horse-drawn railroad carriages—he suggested the construction of a trial railroad from Campbellton to Fayetteville.

However, his brief time in office (and the inherent weaknesses of the governor under the Constitution of North Carolina) did not allow him to accomplish much. He left office after a few months to serve in the U.S. Senate, a post he held from 1828 to 1831. He was completing the term of Nathaniel Macon, who had resigned. By that time, Iredell was a Jacksonian, or member of the Democratic Party. Iredell did not seek to be re-elected by the state General Assembly to a full term in the Senate. He moved to Raleigh, practiced law, and served as court reporter for the North Carolina Supreme Court from 1840 to 1852. He died in Edenton and is buried there in the Johnston Burial Ground.

<doc id="472833" wikidata="Q388927" url="?curid=472833" title="SyQuest Technology">
<text>SyQuest Technology, Inc. () was an early entrant into the hard disk drive market for personal computers. The company was founded on January 27, 1982 by Syed Iftikar who had been a founder of Seagate, along with Ben Alaimo, Bill Krajewski, Anil Nigam and George Toldi. Its earliest products were the SQ306R, a 5 MB 3.9&quot; (100 mm) cartridge disk drive and associated Q-Pak cartridge for IBM XT compatibles. Subsequently a non-removable medium version was announced, the SQ306F.
For many years, SyQuest was the most popular means of transferring large desktop publisher documents such as advertisements to professional printers. SyQuest marketed its products as able to give personal computer users &quot;endless&quot; hard drive space for data-intensive applications like desktop publishing, Internet information management, pre-press, multimedia, audio, video, digital photography, fast backup, data exchange and archiving, along with confidential data security and easy portability for the road.

The introduction of lower-cost options like the Zip drive which offered similar capacity, and later the CD-R which was much less expensive once it reached mass-market, seriously eroded SyQuest&#x27;s sales and the company went bankrupt in 1998. Sales of their existing inventory continued until 2003.

==History==
The company was named partially after the founder, Syed Iftikar, because of a company meeting wherein it was decided that &quot;SyQuest&quot; ought to be a shortened name for &quot;Sy&#x27;s Quest&quot;.

The company announced its first product family of 3.9&quot; (100 mm) cartridge disk drives and associated Q-Pak cartridges at the 1982 National Computer Conference, surprising observers with the low price of $750 for the drive and $35 for a cartridge. They achieved limited success in government markets where removable media were required for security purposes.

In 1986, SyQuest announced the SQ555 and its SQ400 associated cartridge, a 44 MB 5¼-inch removable cartridge hard disk drive, using the industry standard 130 mm disk as its medium. Double capacity versions, the SQ5110 and SQ800 were introduced in 1991. This generation of products became the &quot;de facto&quot; standard in the Apple Macintosh world to store, transfer and backup large amounts of data such as generated by graphic artists, musicians and engineers.

SyQuest went public on the NASDAQ in 1991.

===Bankruptcy===
In early 1996, the company cut 60% of its workforce; later that year, company namesake Syed Iftikar was fired &quot;in a management shakeup.&quot;

After 1997, SyQuest did not fare well in the market. Their core desktop publishing customers began increasingly to use CD-R media and FTP to transfer files, while Iomega&#x27;s Zip drives dominated the small office/home office (SOHO) market. Over the period 1995 to 1997, sales declined, resulting in a series of losses. In the first quarter of 1997 those losses had been reduced to $6.8 million with net revenues increasing to $48.3 million. This compares to a net loss of $33.8 million, or $2.98 per share, on net revenues of $78.7 million for the same period the year before.

They company laid off half of its staff in August 1998 before filing for bankruptcy by the end of the year. Portions of the company were purchased by Iomega Corp. in January 1999, with SyQuest retaining the right to sell its remaining inventory on condition of renaming themselves SYQT. While the company&#x27;s original &quot;syquest.com&quot; website continued to provide technical support for its original products until 2003, its rebranded &quot;syqt.com&quot; website became a digital disk drive and media retailer. By 2009 that website ceased to exist, with its domain (www.syqt.com) put up for sale in the Chinese market.

<text>A natural nuclear fission reactor is a uranium deposit where self-sustaining nuclear chain reactions occur. The idea of a nuclear reactor existing &quot;in situ&quot; within an ore body moderated by groundwater was briefly explored by Paul Kuroda in 1956. The existence of an extinct or fossil nuclear fission reactor, where self-sustaining nuclear reactions have occurred in the past, are established by analysis of isotope ratios of uranium and of the fission products (and the stable daughter nuclides of those fission products). The first such fossil reactor was first discovered in 1972 in Oklo, Gabon, by researchers from the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) when chemists performing quality control for the French nuclear industry noticed sharp depletions of fissile in gaseous uranium made from Gabonese ore.

Oklo is the only location where this phenomenon is known to have occurred, and consists of 16 sites with patches of centimeter-sized ore layers. There, self-sustaining nuclear fission reactions are thought to have taken place approximately 1.7 billion years ago, during the Statherian period of the Paleoproterozoic. Fission in the ore at Oklo continued off and on for a few hundred thousand years and probably never exceeded 100 kW of thermal power. Life on Earth at this time consisted largely of sea-bound algae and the first eukaryotes, living under a 2% oxygen atmosphere. However even this meager oxygen was likely essential to the concentration of uranium into fissionable ore bodies, as uranium dissolves in water only in the presence of oxygen. Before the planetary-scale production of oxygen by the early photosynthesizers groundwater-moderated natural nuclear reactors are not thought to have been possible.

== Discovery of the Oklo fossil reactors ==
In May 1972, at the Tricastin uranium enrichment site at Pierrelatte, France, routine mass spectrometry comparing UF6 samples from the Oklo mine showed a discrepancy in the amount of the isotope. Where the usual concentrations of were 0.72% the Oklo samples showed only 0.60%. This was a significant difference—the samples bore 17% less than expected. This discrepancy required explanation, as all civilian uranium handling facilities must meticulously account for all fissionable isotopes to ensure that none are diverted into the construction of unsanctioned nuclear weapons. Further, as fissile material is the reason for mining uranium in the first place, the missing 17% was also of direct economic concern. 

Thus the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) began an investigation. A series of measurements of the relative abundances of the two most significant isotopes of uranium mined at Oklo showed anomalous results compared to those obtained for uranium from other mines. Further investigations into this uranium deposit discovered uranium ore with a concentration as low as 0.44% (almost 40% below the normal value). Subsequent examination of isotopes of fission products such as neodymium and ruthenium also showed anomalies, as described in more detail below. However, the trace radioisotope did not deviate significantly in its concentration from other natural samples. Both depleted uranium and reprocessed uranium will usually have concentrations significantly different from the secular equilibrium of 55 ppm relative to . This is due to being enriched together with and due to it being both consumed by neutron capture and produced from by fast neutron induced (n,2n) reactions in nuclear reactors. In Oklo any possible deviation of concentration present at the time the reactor was active would have long since decayed away. must have also been present in higher than usual ratios during the time the reactor was operating, but due to its half life of years being almost two orders of magnitude shorter than the time elapsed since the reactor operated, it has decayed to roughly its original value and thus basically nothing and below any abilities of current equipment to detect.

This loss in is exactly what happens in a nuclear reactor. A possible explanation was that the uranium ore had operated as a natural fission reactor in the distant geological past. Other observations led to the same conclusion, and on 25 September 1972 the CEA announced their finding that self-sustaining nuclear chain reactions had occurred on Earth about 2 billion years ago. Later, other natural nuclear fission reactors were discovered in the region.

== Fission product isotope signatures ==
=== Neodymium ===
The neodymium found at Oklo has a different isotopic composition to that of natural neodymium: the latter contains 27% , while that of Oklo contains less than 6%. The is not produced by fission; the ore contains both fission-produced and natural neodymium. From this content, we can subtract the natural neodymium and gain access to the isotopic composition of neodymium produced by the fission of . The two isotopes and lead to the formation of and by neutron capture. This excess must be corrected (see above) to obtain agreement between this corrected isotopic composition and that deduced from fission yields.
=== Ruthenium ===

Similar investigations into the isotopic ratios of ruthenium at Oklo found a much higher concentration than otherwise naturally occurring (27–30% vs. 12.7%). This anomaly could be explained by the decay of to . In the bar chart, the normal natural isotope signature of ruthenium is compared with that for fission product ruthenium which is the result of the fission of with thermal neutrons. The fission ruthenium has a different isotope signature. The level of in the fission product mixture is low because fission produces neutron rich isotopes which subsequently beta decay and would only be produced in appreciable quantities by double beta decay of the very long-lived (half life years) molybdenum isotope . On the timescale of when the reactors were in operation, very little (about 0.17 ppb) decay to will have occurred. Other pathways of production like neutron capture in or (quickly followed by beta decay) can only have occurred during high neutron flux and thus ceased when the fission chain reaction stopped.
== Mechanism ==
The natural nuclear reactor at Oklo formed when a uranium-rich mineral deposit became inundated with groundwater, which could act as a moderator for the neutrons produced by nuclear fission. A chain reaction took place, producing heat that caused the groundwater to boil away; without a moderator that could slow the neutrons, however, the reaction slowed or stopped. The reactor thus had a negative void coefficient of reactivity, something employed as a safety mechanism in human-made light water reactors. After cooling of the mineral deposit, the water returned, and the reaction restarted, completing a full cycle every 3 hours. The fission reaction cycles continued for hundreds of thousands of years and ended when the ever-decreasing fissile materials, coupled with the build-up of neutron poisons, no longer could sustain a chain reaction.

Fission of uranium normally produces five known isotopes of the fission-product gas xenon; all five have been found trapped in the remnants of the natural reactor, in varying concentrations. The concentrations of xenon isotopes, found trapped in mineral formations 2 billion years later, make it possible to calculate the specific time intervals of reactor operation: approximately 30 minutes of criticality followed by 2 hours and 30 minutes of cooling down (exponentially decreasing residual decay heat) to complete a 3-hour cycle. Xenon-135 is the strongest known neutron poison. However, it is not produced directly in appreciable amounts but rather as a decay product of iodine-135 (or one of its parent nuclides). Xenon-135 itself is unstable and decays to caesium-135 if not allowed to absorb neutrons. While caesium-135 is relatively long lived, all caesium-135 produced by the Oklo reactor has since decayed further to stable barium-135. Meanwhile, xenon-136, the product of neutron capture in xenon-135 decays extremely slowly via double beta decay and thus scientists were able to determine the neutronics of this reactor by calculations based on those isotope ratios almost two billion years after it stopped fissioning uranium.

A key factor that made the reaction possible was that, at the time the reactor went critical 1.7 billion years ago, the fissile isotope made up about 3.1% of the natural uranium, which is comparable to the amount used in some of today&#x27;s reactors. (The remaining 96.9% was and roughly 55 ppm , neither of which is fissile by slow or moderated neutrons.) Because has a shorter half-life than , and thus decays more rapidly, the current abundance of in natural uranium is only 0.72%. A natural nuclear reactor is therefore no longer possible on Earth without heavy water or graphite.

The Oklo uranium ore deposits are the only known sites in which natural nuclear reactors existed. Other rich uranium ore bodies would also have had sufficient uranium to support nuclear reactions at that time, but the combination of uranium, water, and physical conditions needed to support the chain reaction was unique, as far as is currently known, to the Oklo ore bodies. It is also possible that other natural nuclear fission reactors were once operating but have since been geologically disturbed so much as to be unrecognizable, possibly even &quot;diluting&quot; the uranium so far that the isotope ratio would no longer serve as a &quot;fingerprint&quot;. Only a small part of the continental crust and no part of the oceanic crust reaches the age of the deposits at Oklo or an age during which isotope ratios of natural uranium would have allowed a self sustaining chain reaction with water as a moderator.

Another factor which probably contributed to the start of the Oklo natural nuclear reactor at 2 billion years, rather than earlier, was the increasing oxygen content in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Uranium is naturally present in the rocks of the earth, and the abundance of fissile was at least 3% or higher at all times prior to reactor startup. Uranium is soluble in water only in the presence of oxygen. Therefore, increasing oxygen levels during the aging of the Earth may have allowed uranium to be dissolved and transported with groundwater to places where a high enough concentration could accumulate to form rich uranium ore bodies. Without the new aerobic environment available on Earth at the time, these concentrations probably could not have taken place.

It is estimated that nuclear reactions in the uranium in centimeter- to meter-sized veins consumed about five tons of and elevated temperatures to a few hundred degrees Celsius. Most of the non-volatile fission products and actinides have only moved centimeters in the veins during the last 2 billion years. Studies have suggested this as a useful natural analogue for nuclear waste disposal. The overall mass defect from the fission of five tons of is about . Over its lifetime the reactor produced roughly in thermal energy, including neutrinos. If one ignores fission of plutonium (which makes up roughly a third of fission events over the course of normal burnup in modern human-made light water reactors), then fission product yields amount to roughly of technetium-99 (since decayed to ruthenium-99), of zirconium-93 (since decayed to niobium-93), of caesium-135 (since decayed to barium-135, but the real value is probably lower as its parent nuclide, xenon-135, is a strong neutron poison and will have absorbed neutrons before decaying to in some cases), of palladium-107 (since decayed to silver), of strontium-90 (long since decayed to zirconium), and of caesium-137 (long since decayed to barium).

== Relation to the atomic fine-structure constant ==
The natural reactor of Oklo has been used to check if the atomic fine-structure constant &quot;α&quot; might have changed over the past 2 billion years. That is because α influences the rate of various nuclear reactions. For example, captures a neutron to become , and since the rate of neutron capture depends on the value of &quot;α&quot;, the ratio of the two samarium isotopes in samples from Oklo can be used to calculate the value of &quot;α&quot; from 2 billion years ago.

Several studies have analysed the relative concentrations of radioactive isotopes left behind at Oklo, and most have concluded that nuclear reactions then were much the same as they are today, which implies that &quot;α&quot; was the same too.

<text>An afterburner (or reheat in British English) is an additional combustion component used on some jet engines, mostly those on military supersonic aircraft. Its purpose is to increase thrust, usually for supersonic flight, takeoff, and combat. The afterburning process injects additional fuel into a combustor (&quot;burner&quot;) in the jet pipe behind (i.e., &quot;after&quot;) the turbine, &quot;reheating&quot; the exhaust gas. Afterburning significantly increases thrust as an alternative to using a bigger engine with its added weight penalty, but at the cost of increased fuel consumption (decreased fuel efficiency) which limits its use to short periods. This aircraft application of &quot;reheat&quot; contrasts with the meaning and implementation of &quot;reheat&quot; applicable to gas turbines driving electrical generators and which reduces fuel consumption.

Jet engines are referred to as operating &quot;wet&quot; when afterburning and &quot;dry&quot; when not. An engine producing maximum thrust wet is at &quot;maximum power,&quot; while an engine producing maximum thrust dry is at &quot;military power&quot;.

== Principle ==

The first jet engine with after-burner was the E variant of Jumo 004.
Jet-engine thrust is an application of Newton&#x27;s reaction principle, in which the engine generates thrust because it increases the momentum of the air passing through it. Thrust depends on two things: the velocity of the exhaust gas and the mass of the gas exiting the nozzle. A jet engine can produce more thrust by either accelerating the gas to a higher velocity or ejecting a greater mass of gas from the engine. Designing a basic turbojet engine around the second principle produces the turbofan engine, which creates slower gas, but more of it. Turbofans are highly fuel efficient and can deliver high thrust for long periods of time, but the design tradeoff is a large size relative to the power output. Generating increased power with a more compact engine for short periods can be achieved using an afterburner. The afterburner increases thrust primarily by accelerating the exhaust gas to a higher velocity.

The following values and parameters are for an early jet engine, the Pratt &amp; Whitney J57, stationary on the runway, and illustrate the high values of afterburner fuel flow, gas temperature and thrust compared to those for the engine operating within the temperature limitations for its turbine.

The highest temperature in the engine (about ) occurs in the combustion chamber, where fuel is burned (at an approximate rate of ) in a relatively small proportion of the air entering the engine. The combustion products have to be diluted with air from the compressor to bring the gas temperature down to a specific value, known as the Turbine Entry Temperature (TET) (), which gives the turbine an acceptable life. Having to reduce the temperature of the combustion products by a large amount is one of the primary limitations on how much thrust can be generated (). Burning all the oxygen delivered by the compressor stages would create temperatures () high enough to significantly weaken the internal structure of the engine, but by mixing the combustion products with unburned air from the compressor at () a substantial amount of oxygen (fuel/air ratio 0.014 compared to a no-oxygen-remaining value 0.0687) is still available for burning large quantities of fuel () in an afterburner. The gas temperature decreases as it passes through the turbine (to ). The afterburner combustor reheats the gas, but to a much higher temperature () than the TET (). As a result of the temperature rise in the afterburner combustor, the gas is accelerated, firstly by the heat addition, known as Rayleigh flow, then by the nozzle to a higher exit velocity than that which occurs without the afterburner. The mass flow is also slightly increased by the addition of the afterburner fuel. The thrust with afterburning is .

The visible exhaust may show &quot;shock diamonds&quot;, which are caused by shock waves formed due to slight differences between ambient pressure and the exhaust pressure. This interaction causes oscillations in the exhaust jet diameter over a short distance and causes visible banding where pressure and temperature are highest.

==Thrust augmentation by heating bypass air==
Thrust may be increased by burning fuel in a turbofan&#x27;s cold bypass air, instead of the mixed cold and hot flows as in most afterburning turbofans.

An early augmented turbofan, the Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30, used separate burning zones for the bypass and core flows with three of seven concentric spray rings in the bypass flow. In comparison, the afterburning Rolls-Royce Spey used a twenty chute mixer before the fuel manifolds.

Plenum chamber burning (PCB) was partially developed for the vectored thrust Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine for the Hawker Siddeley P.1154 until the program was cancelled in 1965. The cold bypass and hot core flows were split between two pairs of nozzles, front and rear, in the same manner as the Rolls-Royce Pegasus, and fuel was burned in the fan air before it left the front nozzles. It would have given greater thrust for take-off and supersonic performance in an aircraft similar to, but bigger than, the Hawker Siddeley Harrier.

Duct heating was used by Pratt &amp; Whitney for their JTF17 turbofan proposal for the U.S. Supersonic Transport Program in 1964 and a demonstrator engine was run. The duct heater used an annular combustor and would be used for takeoff, climb and cruise at Mach 2.7 with different amounts of augmentation depending on aircraft weight.

==Design==
A jet engine afterburner is an extended exhaust section containing extra fuel injectors. Since the jet engine upstream (i.e., before the turbine) will use little of the oxygen it ingests, additional fuel can be burned after the gas flow has left the turbines. When the afterburner is turned on, fuel is injected and igniters are fired. The resulting combustion process increases the afterburner exit (nozzle entry) temperature, resulting in a significant increase in engine thrust. In addition to the increase in afterburner exit stagnation temperature, there is also an increase in nozzle mass flow (i.e. afterburner entry mass flow plus the effective afterburner fuel flow), but a decrease in afterburner exit stagnation pressure (owing to a fundamental loss due to heating plus friction and turbulence losses).

The resulting increase in afterburner exit volume flow is accommodated by increasing the throat area of the exit nozzle. Otherwise, if pressure is not released, the gas can flow upstream and re-ignite, possibly causing a compressor stall (or fan surge in a turbofan application). The first designs, e.g. Solar afterburners used on the F7U Cutlass, F-94 Starfire and F-89 Scorpion, had 2-position eyelid nozzles. Modern designs incorporate not only variable-geometry (VG) nozzles but multiple stages of augmentation via separate spray bars.

To a first order, the gross thrust ratio (afterburning/dry) is directly proportional to the root of the stagnation temperature ratio across the afterburner (i.e. exit/entry).

==Limitations==

Due to their high fuel consumption, afterburners are only used for short-duration, high-thrust requirements. These include heavy-weight or short-runway take-offs, assisting catapult launches from aircraft carriers, and during air combat. A notable exception is the Pratt &amp; Whitney J58 engine used in the SR-71 Blackbird which used its afterburner for prolonged periods and was refueled in-flight as part of every reconnaissance mission.

An afterburner has a limited life to match its intermittent use. The J58 was an exception with a continuous rating. This was achieved with thermal barrier coatings on the liner and flame holders and by cooling the liner and nozzle with compressor bleed air instead of turbine exhaust gas.

==Efficiency==

In heat engines such as jet engines, efficiency is highest when combustion occurs at the highest pressure and temperature possible, and expanded down to ambient pressure (see Carnot cycle).

Since the exhaust gas already has a reduced oxygen content, owing to previous combustion, and since the fuel is not burning in a highly compressed air column, the afterburner is generally inefficient in comparison to the main combustion process. Afterburner efficiency also declines significantly if, as is usually the case, the inlet and tailpipe pressure decreases with increasing altitude.

This limitation applies only to turbojets. In a military turbofan combat engine, the bypass air is added into the exhaust, thereby increasing the core and afterburner efficiency. In turbojets the gain is limited to 50%, whereas in a turbofan it depends on the bypass ratio and can be as much as 70%.

However, as a counterexample, the SR-71 had reasonable efficiency at high altitude in afterburning (&quot;wet&quot;) mode owing to its high speed (Mach 3.2) and correspondingly high pressure due to ram intake.

==Influence on cycle choice==
Afterburning has a significant influence upon engine cycle choice.

Lowering the fan pressure ratio decreases specific thrust (both dry and wet afterburning), but results in a lower temperature entering the afterburner. Since the afterburning exit temperature is effectively fixed, the temperature rise across the unit increases, raising the afterburner fuel flow. The total fuel flow tends to increase faster than the net thrust, resulting in a higher specific fuel consumption (SFC). However, the corresponding dry power SFC improves (i.e. lower specific thrust). The high temperature ratio across the afterburner results in a good thrust boost.

If the aircraft burns a large percentage of its fuel with the afterburner alight, it pays to select an engine cycle with a high specific thrust (i.e. high fan pressure ratio/low bypass ratio). The resulting engine is relatively fuel efficient with afterburning (i.e. Combat/Take-off), but thirsty in dry power. If, however, the afterburner is to be hardly used, a low specific thrust (low fan pressure ratio/high bypass ratio) cycle will be favored. Such an engine has a good dry SFC, but a poor afterburning SFC at Combat/Take-off.

Often the engine designer is faced with a compromise between these two extremes.

==History==
The Caproni Campini C.C.2 motorjet, designed by the Italian engineer Secondo Campini, was the first aircraft to incorporate an afterburner. The first flight of a C.C.2, with its afterburners operating, took place on 11 April 1941.

Early British afterburner (&quot;reheat&quot;) work included flight tests on a Rolls-Royce W2/B23 in a Gloster Meteor I in late 1944 and ground tests on a Power Jets W2/700 engine in mid-1945. This engine was destined for the Miles M.52 supersonic aircraft project.

Early American research on the concept was done by NACA, in Cleveland, Ohio, leading to the publication of the paper &quot;Theoretical Investigation of Thrust Augmentation of Turbojet Engines by Tail-pipe Burning&quot; in January 1947.

American work on afterburners in 1948 resulted in installations on early straight-wing jets such as the Pirate, Starfire and Scorpion.

The new Pratt &amp; Whitney J48 turbojet, at 8,000 lbf (36 kN) thrust with afterburners, would power the Grumman swept-wing fighter F9F-6, which was about to go into production. Other new Navy fighters with afterburners included the Chance Vought F7U-3 Cutlass, powered by two 6,000 lbf (27 kN) thrust Westinghouse J46 engines.

In the 1950s, several large afterburning engines were developed, such as the Orenda Iroquois and the British de Havilland Gyron and Rolls-Royce Avon RB.146 variants. The Avon and its variants powered the English Electric Lightning, the first supersonic aircraft in RAF service. The Bristol-Siddeley/Rolls-Royce Olympus was fitted with afterburners for use with the BAC TSR-2. This system was designed and developed jointly by Bristol-Siddeley and Solar of San Diego. The afterburner system for the Concorde was developed by Snecma.

Afterburners are generally used only in military aircraft, and are considered standard equipment on fighter aircraft. The handful of civilian planes that have used them include some NASA research aircraft, the Tupolev Tu-144, Concorde and the White Knight of Scaled Composites. Concorde flew long distances at supersonic speeds. Sustained high speeds would be impossible with the high fuel consumption of afterburner, and the plane used afterburners at takeoff and to minimize time spent in the high-drag transonic flight regime. Supersonic flight without afterburners is referred to as supercruise.

A turbojet engine equipped with an afterburner is called an &quot;afterburning turbojet&quot;, whereas a turbofan engine similarly equipped is sometimes called an &quot;augmented turbofan&quot;.

A &quot;dump-and-burn&quot; is an airshow display feature where fuel is jettisoned, then intentionally ignited using the afterburner. A spectacular flame combined with high speed makes this a popular display for airshows, or as a finale to fireworks. Fuel dumping is used primarily to reduce the weight of an aircraft to avoid a heavy, high-speed landing. Other than for safety or emergency reasons, fuel dumping does not have a practical use.

<text>The Afterburner lighting kit by Triton Labs is an aftermarket modification to the Game Boy Advance in which a frontlight is installed into the unit. 

Afterburner was discontinued after the Game Boy Advance SP released because it had a built-in light (front light).

<text>is a rail shooter arcade video game developed and released by Sega in 1987. The player controls an American F-14 Tomcat fighter jet and must clear each of the game&#x27;s eighteen unique stages by destroying incoming enemies. The plane is equipped with a machine gun and a limited supply of heat-seeking missiles. The game uses a third-person perspective, as in Sega&#x27;s earlier &quot;Space Harrier&quot; (1985) and &quot;Out Run&quot; (1986). It runs on the Sega X Board arcade system which is capable of surface and sprite rotation. It is the fourth Sega game to use a hydraulic &quot;taikan&quot; motion simulator arcade cabinet, one that is more elaborate than their earlier &quot;taikan&quot; simulator games. The cabinet simulates an aircraft cockpit, with flight stick controls, a chair with seatbelt, and hydraulic motion technology that moves, tilts, rolls and rotates the cockpit in sync with the on-screen action.

Designed by Sega veteran Yu Suzuki and the Sega AM2 division, &quot;After Burner&quot; was intended as being Sega&#x27;s first &quot;true blockbuster&quot; video game. Development began in December 1986, shortly after the completion of &quot;Out Run&quot;, and was kept as a closely guarded secret within the company. Suzuki was inspired by the 1986 films &quot;Top Gun&quot; and &quot;&quot;; he originally planned for the game to have an aesthetic similar to &quot;Laputa&quot;, but instead went with a &quot;Top Gun&quot; look to make the game approachable for worldwide audiences. It was designed outside the company in a building named &quot;Studio 128&quot;, due to Sega adopting a flextime schedule to allow for games to be worked on outside company headquarters. An updated version with the addition of throttle controls, After Burner II, was released later the same year.

&quot;After Burner&quot; was a worldwide commercial success, becoming Japan&#x27;s second highest-grossing large arcade game of 1987 and overall arcade game of 1988 as well as among America&#x27;s top five highest-grossing dedicated arcade games of 1988. It was acclaimed by critics for its impressive visuals, gameplay and overall presentation, and is seen as being important and influential. It was followed by a series of sequels and ports for many platforms, including the Master System, ZX Spectrum, and Famicom. Sega also produced several successors to the game to capitalize on its success, such as &quot;G-LOC: Air Battle&quot;. &quot;After Burner&quot; has also been referenced in many other Sega video games, such as &quot;Fighters Megamix&quot;, &quot;Shenmue&quot;, and &quot;Bayonetta&quot;.

==Gameplay==

The game allows the player to control an F-14 Tomcat jet airplane. At the start of the game, the player takes off from an aircraft carrier called the &quot;SEGA Enterprise&quot; on a mission to destroy enemy jets over 18 stages.

In the arcade version, the jet employs a machine gun and a limited number of heat-seeking missiles (in the Master System version the player has unlimited missiles). These weapons are replenished by another aircraft, after beating a few stages. The aircraft, cannon and missile buttons are all controlled from an integrated flight stick.

The game itself was released in two variations in the US: a standard upright cabinet and a closed rotating cockpit &quot;deluxe&quot; version. In the cockpit version, the seat tilted forward and backwards, and the cockpit rotated from side to side. It featured two speakers at head-level for stereo sound, and had a seatbelt to hold the player when the cockpit moved. Both cabinets contained a grey monitor frame with flashing lights at the top that indicated an enemy&#x27;s &quot;lock&quot; on the player&#x27;s craft. Japan also received a commander cabinet that moved left and right. A third variation, called &quot;commander&quot;, released elsewhere, featured an open cabinet.

==Development and release==
&quot;After Burner&quot; was designed by Yu Suzuki of Sega AM2, with assistance by programmer Satoshi Mifune and composer Hiroshi &quot;Hiro&quot; Kawaguchi. Development of the game begin in early December 1986 shortly after work on &quot;Out Run&quot; was completed, with much of the development team having worked on &quot;Out Run&quot;. &quot;After Burner&quot; was intended as Sega&#x27;s first &quot;true blockbuster&quot; video game; as such, the project was kept as a closely guarded secret within the company during the entirety of its development cycle. When the game was in its initial concept stages, Sega had adopted a flextime work system, allowing development of games to be done outside the company; &quot;After Burner&quot; was one of the first games to be produced under this new system, with development taking place in a building named &quot;Studio 128&quot;.

Suzuki was inspired by the film &quot;&quot; and initially wanted to employ a similar aesthetic for &quot;After Burner&quot;, but this idea was scrapped early on in favor of a style akin to the movie &quot;Top Gun&quot;, as Suzuki wanted the game more approachable for a worldwide audience. The game was programmed and tested on a PC-98 system, making it the first Sega-published video game to be developed using personal computers rather than workstations.

One of the biggest challenges the team had to overcome was researching and implementing sprite and surface rotation, which for the time was considered a milestone in video games. The team also struggled with creating the smoke trails made by firing missiles, seeing several tweaks and revisions as development progressed. Unlike their earlier game &quot;Out Run&quot;, which featured real-world locations in its levels, Suzuki lacked the time to visit any specific places or landmarks, so he and his team made up their own stage settings. Suzuki toyed with the idea of having the Soviet Union as the antagonists to potentially increase sales in the west, but decided against it later on after struggling to tie it together with the game&#x27;s level designs and settings. The refueling and landing sequences were created to add variety.

The &quot;After Burner&quot; arcade cabinet was significantly more expensive than most of Sega&#x27;s other machines at the time. The first prototype unit constructed, which consisted of the monitor attached to a steel frame, was claimed by Mifune to have &quot;amazing power&quot;, but was considered too dangerous to operate and had the power levels lowered. Suzuki also thought of the game using a gyroscopic arcade cabinet that spun the player around, an idea that later became the R-360. A throttle control was briefly considered, but was abandoned as it would have destroyed the game&#x27;s difficulty balance. It uses the Sega X Board, which was also used for games such as &quot;Thunder Blade&quot; (1987) and &quot;Super Monaco GP&quot; (1989). &quot;After Burner&quot; was officially released in Japan in July 1987, and in October of that year in North America. In Europe, it was released in September 1987, with the hydraulic sit-in cabinet costing £4,000, or , in the United Kingdom.

==&quot;After Burner II&quot;==
&quot;After Burner&quot; was followed by &quot;After Burner II&quot;, which was released in the same year (1987), also released for the Sega X Board arcade system. Some consider this game to be more of a revision of its predecessor, rather than an entirely new game, a practice later repeated by Sega for &quot;Galaxy Force&quot; and &quot;Galaxy Force II&quot;. In the game, players fly an F-14 Tomcat jet fighter, gunning down enemies while avoiding incoming fire. &quot;After Burner II&quot; came both a standard arcade cabinet and a servo actuated, sit-down motion simulator version which moved according to the motion of the plane onscreen. The cockpit would bank in the same direction the on-screen aircraft was banking. It is an updated version of &quot;After Burner&quot;, with the addition of throttle controls, and some of the music being changed, for example in the song After Burner, the rock guitars were added, and the xylophone and chords were put an octave up. It was a commercial success, becoming Japan&#x27;s highest-grossing arcade game of 1988.

The game was mostly created by three men: Yu Suzuki, Satoshi Mifune, and Kawaguchi. During development, it was codenamed &quot;Studio 128&quot; to specify the secrecy of the project.

==Reception==
===Arcade===
&quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;After Burner&quot; as being the most popular arcade game of August 1987 in Japan, where it went on to be the second highest-grossing large arcade game of 1987 (just below &quot;Out Run&quot;) and the overall highest-grossing arcade game of 1988. In the United States, it was one of the top five highest-grossing dedicated arcade games of 1988, and remained a top ten earner at various arcades through 1990. In the United Kingdom, it was the top-grossing arcade game upon release in September 1987.

The arcade game received positive reviews from critics. Clare Edgeley of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; called it a &quot;fabulous game&quot; with praise for the gameplay and motion cabinet while noting it has a lock-on mechanic similar to the Data East arcade game &quot;Lock-On&quot; (1986). &quot;Top Score&quot; said it has &quot;all the finger-numbing action of the best arcade shoot-em-ups, combined with some of the most stunning animation ever seen in a video game&quot; and that it was &quot;a glossy air combat game that ranks higher than similar efforts that have preceded it&quot;. The review called it &quot;one of the most beautiful and realistic shooting games ever produced&quot; with &quot;somewhat shallow&quot; gameplay that is nevertheless &quot;definitively worth the price of admission&quot; especially in the &quot;cockpit simulator&quot; cabinet.

&quot;Sinclair User&quot; reviewed the arcade game, scoring it 8 out of 10. Ciarán Brennan of &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; said that, despite the higher price point, do not &quot;let a little thing like a pound coin stand between you and action like this&quot;. Robin Hogg of &quot;The Games Machine&quot; called it the &quot;hottest Sega release so far&quot; with praise for the graphics and gameplay, but with some criticism towards the £1 UK price.

At the 1987 &quot;Gamest&quot; Awards in Japan, &quot;After Burner&quot; won the Best Graphics award, while being a runner-up for Game of the Year (2nd place), Best Ending (6th place), Best VGM (4th place), Best Sound Synthesis (8th place) and Most Popular Game (3rd place). &quot;After Burner&quot; also won a Special Award at the 1988 &quot;Gamest&quot; Awards. In the United States, &quot;After Burner&quot; won the award for &quot;Most Innovative Game&quot; at the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association&#x27;s 1988 AMOA Games Awards.

===After Burner II===

In Japan, &quot;After Burner II&quot; was tied with &quot;After Burner&quot; as the highest-grossing arcade game of 1988.

&quot;Mega&quot; placed the Mega Drive version at number 38 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time. &quot;MegaTech&quot; magazine praised the smooth and fast gameplay, as well as the sound.

==Ports==

The game was ported to the Amiga, MS-DOS, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, X68000, FM Towns, Commodore 64, Master System, PC Engine, Sega Saturn, MSX, ZX Spectrum. The C64 has two versions: a European version by U.S. Gold, and a US version by Activision and Weebee Games. A port of &quot;After Burner&quot; to the 32X was done by Rutubo Games, and was known as &quot;After Burner Complete&quot; in Japan and Europe. An unlicensed NES port of the game developed by Tengen also exists, which was reworked by Sunsoft for their Japanese-exclusive port to the same console. A port of &quot;After Burner&quot; to the Game Boy Advance was included in an arcade 4 pack named &quot;Sega Arcade Gallery&quot;.

&quot;After Burner&quot; for the Master System was a best-seller for Sega in the United States during 1988.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; reviewed &quot;After Burner&quot; on the Master System, citing aircraft depicted in &quot;remarkable detail&quot;, &quot;spectacular&quot; scenery, and excellent explosions. On the ZX Spectrum the 1988 conversion of &quot;After Burner&quot; by Activision was well-received, with Sinclair User describing it as &quot;top-class coin-op conversion destined for the top of the charts&quot; and giving it 90%, whilst &quot;Crash&quot; magazine gave it 86% overall. Zzap!64&#x27;s reviewers were unimpressed with the Commodore 64 version which was described as &quot;incredibly disappointing&quot; with &quot;laughably bad&quot; graphics and sound. It was given an overall rating of 17%. A later &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; review for the PC was much more critical, giving the game one star out of five and stating that it was inferior to the arcade version.

Reviewing the 32X version, &quot;GamePro&quot; commented that the graphics, sound, and gameplay are all great, but that the only difference between it and the Genesis version of &quot;After Burner II&quot; are some minor graphical and audio enhancements, making it only worthwhile to gamers who have never played an &quot;After Burner&quot; game before.

&quot;After Burner II&quot; has been translated and ported to numerous home systems: PC Engine, X68000, Mega Drive/Genesis, Famicom, FM Towns Marty, Atari ST, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and Sega Saturn.

The game was rebuilt with stereoscopic 3D feature as one of 3D Classics for Nintendo 3DS.

==Legacy==
===Sequels and related games===
Although the &quot;After Burner&quot; brand was long dormant, Sega created a number of aerial combat games centered on the F-14 Tomcat with many similar features, which are frequently regarded as part of the series. These include &quot;G-LOC: Air Battle&quot; and its sequel &quot;Strike Fighter&quot; (later rebranded &quot;After Burner III&quot; in its home release). Later games associated with the series include &quot;Sky Target&quot; (which retained similar gameplay and presentation to the original, but with the addition of 3D graphics) and &quot;Sega Strike Fighter&quot; (an arcade flight combat game which featured free-roaming movement, boasting similar music but with an F/A-18 Hornet as the main plane).

In 2006, Sega released a new sequel on Sega Lindbergh hardware, &quot;After Burner Climax&quot;, the first arcade game to bear the brand since &quot;After Burner II&quot;.

&quot;After Burner Climax&quot; was later ported to Xbox Live Arcade and PSN. It was followed by the spin-off &quot;After Burner: Black Falcon&quot; for the PSP in 2007. &quot;After Burner Climax&quot; was de-listed in December 2014, leaving the game no longer available for purchase, only to be brought back in March 2019 to digital mobile platforms for free, with ads, under the &quot;Sega Forever&quot; brand.

In Japan, &quot;After Burner II&quot; was released on the PlayStation 2 as part of the &quot;Sega Ages&quot; classic series.

M2 ported &quot;After Burner II&quot; in Sega&#x27;s 3D Classics series to the Nintendo 3DS eShop in Japan on 2013 and worldwide in 2015. This version is faithful to the original arcade game with additions, including Touch Controls and screen layouts that resemble the Upright as well as the Commander and Deluxe cabinets. An unlockable new Special mode was also added, which used a time-slowing &quot;Burst&quot; system similar to &quot;After Burner Climax&quot;, and featured a different story and altered stages. This mode has no stage select or continues, and instead depends on frequent acquisition of extra lives over the course of the game in order to complete it.

===In other games===
An emulated version of &quot;After Burner&quot; is playable at the in-game arcade in &quot;Shenmue 2&quot;.

The plane from &quot;After Burner&quot; makes a cameo in &quot;Fighters Megamix&quot;, accessed with a cheat code.

The music from &quot;After Burner&quot; appears in a remix in Chapter 8, entitled &quot;Route 666&quot;, of &quot;Bayonetta&quot; (developed by PlatinumGames and published by Sega). This remix is reused in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Wii U&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; on the &quot;Bayonetta&quot; stage, Umbra Clock Tower.

An area based on &quot;After Burner&quot;, &quot;Carrier Zone&quot;, appears as a tennis court in &quot;Sega Superstars Tennis&quot; and as a race track in &quot;Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed&quot;. The latter also features a playable racer, AGES, whose vehicle transforms into an &quot;After Burner&quot;-inspired F-14 Tomcat during flight segments.

A remix of &quot;After Burner&quot; appears in &quot;Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA&quot; on both the arcade &amp; console versions, complete with Vocaloid vocals.

<text>John Motley Morehead (July 4, 1796 – August 27, 1866) was an American lawyer and politician who became the 29th governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina (1841 to 1845). He became known as &quot;the Father of Modern North Carolina.&quot;

==Early and family life==
Born in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, Morehead was the son of Obedience (Motley) and John Morehead. His parents moved to Rockingham County, North Carolina when Morehead was two.

After a private education including private tutors around Greensboro, Morehead attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. There he became a member of the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies, and graduated in 1817.

==Career==
Morehead read law under Archibald Murphey and was admitted to the North Carolina bar in 1819. He practiced law in Wentworth, North Carolina. In 1821, Rockingham County voters first elected him to serve in the North Carolina House of Commons. Beginning in 1826, Guilford County voters twice elected Morehead to represent them in the North Carolina House of Commons. In 1835, Morehead was chosen to be a delegate to the state Constitutional Convention, where he advocated representation based on population (which benefitted western North Carolina because of its relatively few enslaved people).

Voters elected Morehead governor in 1840, and he became the first governor inaugurated in the new State Capitol. During his two gubernatorial terms, Morehead supported the new public school system, extending railroad lines, river and harbor improvements and constructing canals and turnpikes, but the Democrats in the state legislature passed few of those measures. During his final year, Morehead supported creation of a school for the deaf, which would be named in his honor.

After his term as governor ended in 1845, Morehead returned to his home, Blandwood, in Greensboro, North Carolina, designed by New York City architect Alexander Jackson Davis. There, Morehead entertained numerous politicians and personalities of the day, including Dorothea Dix.

Morehead helped raise private funds for a railroad line to accompany $2 million finally authorized by the legislature, which became the North Carolina Railroad. In 1854, Morehead became the first president and the railroad&#x27;s terminus was named Morehead City, North Carolina in his honor in 1860. His successor at the railroad, Charles Frederick Fisher, however, endured significant criticism during the intervening years. Morehead also built a cotton mill in Leaksville, and served on the Board of Trustees of UNC, his alma mater.

Morehead returned to the North Carolina house in 1858. In 1861, he represented North Carolina at a conference to avoid war. With the failure of the conference and the secession of North Carolina, Morehead served in as the Representative to the Provisional Confederate Congress from North Carolina.

==Death==
Morehead died at Rockbridge Springs, Virginia in 1866. He is buried in the Old First Presbyterian Church Cemetery located at the Greensboro Historical Museum in Greensboro.

==Legacy==

His grandson, John Motley Morehead III (United States Ambassador to Sweden 1930–33), bequeathed to the University of North Carolina $130 million, commissioned the university&#x27;s planetarium, and funded the John Motley Morehead Foundation. His granddaughter Lily Morehead Mebane was decorated by the governments of France and Serbia for her relief work after World War I; she later served two terms in the North Carolina state legislature. His great grandson Gordon Johnston was a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor. Governor Morehead School, a state school for the blind, is named after him.

He is the namesake of Morehead City, a major city in Eastern North Carolina.

<text>Westport is a village in Eastern Ontario, Canada. It lies at the west end of Upper Rideau Lake, at the head of the navigable Rideau Canal system, southwest of Ottawa.

The village of Westport was incorporated as an independent municipality in 1904. Surrounded by the Township of Rideau Lakes, within Leeds County, Westport is Ontario&#x27;s smallest municipality (by land area).

==History==

The first settlers to the Westport area arrived in the period between 1810 and 1820. The land on which Westport now sits was originally granted by the Crown to a Mr. Hunter, but he never settled in the area and it was eventually purchased by Reuben Sherwood in 1817. Some of this land was later purchased by the Stoddard and Manhard families. The small community was known as Head of the Lake. In 1828, Stoddard built a saw mill and in 1829 the Manhards built a saw mill and grist mill. It became known at that time as Manhard&#x27;s Mills. Two local merchants, Aaron Chambers and Lewis Cameron, named the village Westport in 1841, the name reflecting its location at the west end of Upper Rideau Lake. The post office dates from 1845. The village of Westport was incorporated in 1904 when it separated from North Crosby Township.

Like much of the surrounding area, Westport received a large number of Irish immigrants in the 1840s through the 1860s, following the Great Famine. St. Edward&#x27;s Catholic Church at the corner of Concession and Bedford, built in 1859, was an early cultural centre for the largely Catholic Irish immigrants.

Westport remained a thriving commercial centre through the 19th century and into the 20th century. The building of the Rideau Canal allowed goods to be shipped north to Ottawa and south to Kingston. In 1882, an entrepreneur named R.G. Harvey proposed an ambitious project to build a railway from Brockville to Sault Ste. Marie. The project ran out of money after the section from Brockville to Westport had been completed in 1888. The Brockville-Westport line moved goods, mail and people to and from the St. Lawrence River and Westport. Many cheese factories were located between Brockville and Westport. The train was therefore known as the &quot;cheese run.&quot; The rail line also brought tourists north to Westport starting a tradition of Westport as a tourist destination. The last train travelled the Brockville, Westport and North-Western Railway line in 1952.

===Recent events===
In June 2013, longtime Mayor Bill Thake died of a stroke at age 77; the village council appointed councillor Dan Grunig to take his place in July and called an election for September 30 to fill the vacant councillor&#x27;s seat. Elected as mayor is Robin Jones,

In June, 2021, Westport celebrated its first Pride Week.

==Services==
Westport has its own volunteer fire department. The &quot;Review Mirror&quot;, the community newspaper, is published on Thursdays. With a subscription base of only 700, it is one of Ontario&#x27;s smallest weekly newspapers.

Westport has an online only community internet radio station called &quot;Rideau Lakes Radio&quot;. Established in 2022, the station broadcasts a mix of country, blues, soft rock, rock, oldies and much more.

==Tourism and attractions==

A public wharf on a man-made island has dock space for up to 30 vessels. The Westport Harbour also has a picnic area, barbecues, and sewage pumpout facilities.

Fishing in the area is particularly good because of the fish-rearing ponds set up by the Provincial Government in 1957. Yellow perch, smallmouth bass, pickerel, and Northern pike populate the waters.

Foley Mountain Conservation Area, the highest conservation area in the Rideau Valley, is a picturesque park overlooking Westport. It features a variety of wildlife in 308 hectares (2.4 km2) of woods and fields. The area also has a sandy beach with changing facilities. The 300 km Rideau Trail, linking Kingston and Ottawa, passes through the conservation area.

Westport is part of PorchFest, featuring its own local festival in late September, named WestPORCH. WestPORCH is a free community festival, which began in 2021, it was created by John Pringle &amp; Trevor Connell.

<doc id="472866" wikidata="Q41766" url="?curid=472866" title="Ctesibius">
<text>Ctesibius or Ktesibios or Tesibius (; BCE) was a Greek inventor and mathematician in Alexandria, Ptolemaic Egypt. Very little is known of Ctesibius&#x27; life, but his inventions were well known in his lifetime. He was likely the first head of the Museum of Alexandria. He wrote the first treatises on the science of compressed air and its uses in pumps (and even in a kind of cannon). This, in combination with his work &quot;On pneumatics&quot; on the elasticity of air, earned him the title of &quot;father of pneumatics.&quot; None of his written work has survived, including his &quot;Memorabilia,&quot; a compilation of his research that was cited by Athenaeus. Ctesibius&#x27; most commonly known invention today is a pipe organ (hydraulis), a predecessor of the modern church organ.

==Inventions==
Ctesibius was the son of a barber, born BCE, probablybut not certainlyin Alexandria. He began his career as a barber, following his father.

During this first career, he invented a counterweight-adjustable mirror. Another of his inventions was the hydraulis, a water organ that is considered the precursor of the modern pipe organ and the first keyboard instrument. He and his wife Thais were reputed to be highly-skilled players of the instrument. He improved the water clock or clepsydra (&#x27;water thief&#x27;), which for more than 1,800 years was the most accurate clock ever constructed, until the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens&#x27; invention of the pendulum clock in 1656. Ctesibius described one of the first force pumps for producing a jet of water, or for lifting water from wells. Examples have been found at various Roman sites, such as at Silchester in Britain. The principle of the siphon has also been attributed to him.
==Reputation==
According to Diogenes Laërtius, Ctesibius was miserably poor. Laërtius details this by recounting the following concerning the philosopher Arcesilaus:
Ctesibius&#x27;s work is chronicled by Vitruvius, Athenaeus, Pliny the Elder, and Philo of Byzantium who repeatedly mention him, adding that the first mechanicians such as Ctesibius had the advantage of being under kings who loved fame and supported the arts. Proclus (the commentator on Euclid) and Hero of Alexandria (the last of the engineers of antiquity) also mention him.

== Commemoration ==
* In 1976, the crater on the far side of the Moon was named Ctesibius by the International Astronomical Union.

<doc id="472870" wikidata="Q147068" url="?curid=472870" title="Funny Face">
<text>Funny Face is a 1957 American musical romantic comedy film directed by Stanley Donen and written by Leonard Gershe, containing assorted songs by George and Ira Gershwin. Although having the same title as the 1927 Broadway musical &quot;Funny Face&quot; by the Gershwin brothers, and featuring the same male star (Fred Astaire), the plot is completely different and only four of the songs from the stage musical are included. Alongside Astaire, the film stars Audrey Hepburn and Kay Thompson.

==Plot==
Maggie Prescott, a fashion magazine publisher and editor for &quot;Quality&quot; magazine, is looking for the next big fashion trend. She wants a new look which is to be both &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;intellectual&quot;. She and top fashion photographer Dick Avery want models who can &quot;think as well as they look.&quot; The two brainstorm and come up with the idea to use a book store in Greenwich Village as backdrop.

They find what they want in &quot;Embryo Concepts&quot;, which is being run by the shy shop assistant and amateur philosopher, Jo Stockton. Jo thinks the fashion and modelling industry is nonsense, calling it &quot;, and an unrealistic approach to self-impressions as well as economics&quot;. Maggie decides to use Jo but after the first shot Jo is locked outside to keep her from interrupting Maggie’s take-over of the shop. The crew leaves the store in a shambles; Dick stays behind to help clean up and apologizes to Jo, then kisses her impulsively. Jo dismisses him, but her song &quot;How Long Has This Been Going On?&quot; shows that she feels the stirrings of romance.

What Jo wants above all is to go to Paris and attend the famous Professor Émile Flostre&#x27;s philosophy lectures about empathicalism. When Dick gets back to the darkroom, he sees something in Jo&#x27;s face which is new and fresh and would be perfect for the campaign, giving it &quot;character&quot;, &quot;spirit&quot;, and &quot;intelligence&quot;. They send for Jo, pretending they want to order some books from her shop. Once she arrives, they try to make her over and attempt to cut her hair. She is outraged and runs away, only to hide in the darkroom where Dick is working. When Dick mentions Paris, Jo becomes interested in the chance to see Professor Flostre and is finally persuaded to model for the magazine. Dick sings &quot;Funny Face&quot;.

Soon, Maggie, Dick, and Jo are off to Paris to prepare for a major fashion event, shooting photos at famous landmarks from the area. During the various shoots, Jo and Dick fall in love (&quot;He Loves and She Loves&quot;). One night, when Jo is getting ready for a gala, she learns Flostre is giving a lecture at a cafe nearby, which she attends. Eventually, Dick brings her back and they get into an argument at the gala&#x27;s opening, which results in Jo being publicly embarrassed and Maggie outraged.

Jo goes to talk to Flostre at his home. Through some scheming, Maggie and Dick gain entrance to the soirée there. After performing an impromptu song and dance (“Clap Yo’ Hands” from the Gershwins’ 1926 musical &quot;Oh, Kay!&quot;) for Flostre&#x27;s disciples, they confront Jo and Flostre. This leads to Dick causing Flostre to fall and knock himself out. Jo urges them to leave but when Flostre comes round, he tries to seduce her. Shocked at the behavior of her &quot;idol&quot;, she smashes a vase over his head and runs out, returning just in time to take part in the final fashion show. During this, Maggie tries to get in touch with Dick, who has made plans to leave Paris. Before her wedding gown finale, Jo looks out the window and sees the plane Dick was supposed to be on flying over the city. Believing that he has refused to return to her, she runs off the runway in tears at the conclusion of the show.

Meanwhile, Dick is still at the airport. He runs into Flostre and learns how Jo had attacked him. Realizing how much Jo cares, Dick returns to the fashion show, but Jo is nowhere to be found. Finally, after applying the insights of empathicalism at Maggie&#x27;s behest, Dick guesses that Jo would return to the church where he had photographed her in a wedding dress and they shared their first romantic moment. On his arrival there himself, he finds Jo (in the wedding gown) by a little brook. They join in the duet &quot;&#x27;S Wonderful&quot; and embrace.

==Production==
The plot of the film version is drastically different from that of the Broadway musical, and only four of the songs remain. Astaire also starred in the stage version alongside his sister, Adele Astaire. The film plot is actually adapted from another Broadway musical, &quot;Wedding Bells&quot;, by Leonard Gershe. The original title for the film was &quot;Wedding Day&quot;.

Hepburn sings the songs herself in this, her first musical. She performs one solo, &quot;How Long Has This Been Going On?&quot;; a duet with Astaire, &quot;&#x27;S Wonderful&quot;; a duet with Kay Thompson called &quot;On How to Be Lovely&quot;; and takes part in an ensemble performance of &quot;Bonjour, Paris!&quot;. Her previous dance training is also called into play, not only in the two dance numbers she performs with Astaire but also for a Bohemian-style solo dance in a nightclub.

As was the case with many of her leading men, Astaire was much older than Hepburn. At 58, three decades Hepburn&#x27;s senior, he was approaching the end of his musical film career, in this, the second in a consecutive series of three French-themed musicals he made in the 1950s. He performs a song and dance solo with umbrella and cape to Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Kiss and Make Up&quot;. According to Hepburn, she insisted on Astaire as a precondition for her participation. Thompson, who usually worked behind the scenes as a musical director for films, makes a rare appearance on camera as Maggie Prescott, a fashion magazine editor loosely based on Diana Vreeland. (Architectural historian Francis Morrone says it was Carmel Snow, editor-in-chief of &quot;Harper’s Bazaar&quot;, who was the inspiration for the Maggie Prescott character.) Besides her duet with Hepburn, she performs the solo number &quot;Think Pink!&quot; in the presence of a dance chorus, and Thompson and Astaire perform a comic dance duet to &quot;Clap Yo&#x27; Hands&quot;. (While at &quot;Vogue&quot;, Vreeland once sent a memo to staff urging them to &quot;Today let&#x27;s think pig white! Wouldn&#x27;t it be wonderful to have stockings that were pig white! The color of baby pigs, not quite white and not quite pink!&quot;)

Astaire&#x27;s character was loosely based on the career of Richard Avedon, who provided a number of the photographs seen in the film, including the stills for the opening credits, which were also used in the halls of &quot;Quality&quot; magazine. Probably the most famous single image from the film is the intentionally overexposed close-up of Hepburn&#x27;s face in which only her facial features—her eyes, eyebrows, nose and mouth—are visible. This image is seen briefly in black-and-white at the very beginning of the opening title sequence, which was designed by Avedon, during the &quot;Funny Face&quot; musical number which takes place in a darkroom, and when Dick (Astaire) presents it to Maggie (Thompson).

==Release==

===Box office===
On initial release, &quot;Funny Face&quot; was a box office disappointment and failed to break even. However, in 1964, when &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (also starring Hepburn) was released to excellent reviews and huge box office grosses, Paramount theatrically reissued &quot;Funny Face&quot;. As a result, the film drew substantial crowds and finally turned a profit.

===Critical reception===
The film was generally well received in the United States. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, for example, lauded it as &quot;delightfully balmy,&quot; &quot;colorful and glittering,&quot; and &quot;extraordinarily stylish,&quot; &quot;with class in every considerable department on which this sort of picture depends.&quot; The reviewer for &quot;The Times&quot;, however, was not impressed when the film opened at the Odeon in London on April 25, 1957: &quot;...a displeasing piece of work, pseudo-sophisticated, expensive and brash in approach, vulgar in taste and insensitive in outlook. This, in fact, is the American &#x27;musical&#x27; at its worst; not even the presence of Mr Fred Astaire, who was in the original stage production, can save the day. It may seem extravagant to discuss a &#x27;musical&#x27; in terms proper to a serious creative work, yet there is that in the film&#x27;s attitude towards the &#x27;intellectual&#x27;, whether in Greenwich Village or Paris, which offends. It is not amiable parody and it is not telling satire; it has its roots in the ill-based instinct to jeer, and its jeers are offensive.&quot;

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 88% rating, based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The consensus summarizes: &quot;A timeless and elegant musical feast, &quot;Funny Face&quot; thrives on the agile and vibrant performances from legendary screen titans Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire.&quot;

===Accolades===
The National Board of Review gave the film Special Citation award for the photographic innovations. Leonard Gershe was nominated for &quot;Best Written American Musical&quot; by the Writers Guild of America. Stanley Donen was nominated by the Directors Guild of America for &quot;Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures&quot; and for a &quot;Golden Palm&quot; at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival. Fred Astaire received a Golden Laurel nomination for &quot;Top Male Musical Performance&quot;. The film received four Academy Award &quot;Oscar&quot; nominations: Leonard Gershe for &quot;Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen&quot;; Edith Head and Hubert de Givenchy (Hepburn&#x27;s costume designer) for &quot;Best Costume Design&quot;; Ray June for &quot;Best Cinematography&quot;; and Hal Pereira, George W. Davis, Sam Comer, and Ray Moyer for &quot;Best Art Direction-Set Decoration&quot;.

==Home media==
To date, &quot;Funny Face&quot; has been released to DVD in Region 1 (North America) in three editions from Paramount Home Entertainment: in 2001 as part of the &quot;Audrey Hepburn Widescreen Collection&quot; series, in 2007 in a 50th Anniversary edition, and in 2009 as part of Paramount&#x27;s Centennial Collection. The 2007 version has additional featurettes as well as improved picture and sound quality from the 2001 edition. The 2009 release is spread over two discs and includes a few additional featurettes not included in the 2007 edition such as Kay Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Think Pink&quot;, &quot;This is VistaVision&quot; and &quot;Fashion Photographers Exposed&quot;.

The Wilmington Airport (ILG) is the largest air facility operated by the DRBA and is an FAA back-up facility to Philadelphia International Airport (PHL).

The agency headquarters are in the Delaware Memorial Bridge Plaza, in unincorporated New Castle County, Delaware, with a New Castle postal address.

==Police department==
The Delaware River and Bay Authority Police Department is a law enforcement agency of the DRBA with limited jurisdiction in both New Jersey and Delaware. The department is mainly responsible for the Delaware Memorial Bridge and surrounding highway, but also provides police services at the Wilmington Airport (and the Corporate Complex located adjacent to the Wilmington Airport), the Civil Air Terminal at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware Airpark in Dover, the Forts Ferry Crossing in Delaware City, the Cape May−Lewes Ferry, Millville Municipal Airport and Cape May Airport.

===History===
The Department was formed in 1951 as the Delaware Memorial Bridge Police Department. After a compact between the states of Delaware and New Jersey was signed in 1962, the Delaware River and Bay Authority (DRBA) was created. The compact authorized the DRBA to operate the Delaware Memorial Bridge and to form its own police force. DRBA bridge officers were given powers of investigation, detention and arrest on the crossings, transportation or terminal facilities and other projects and the approaches thereto, owned, operated, or controlled by the DRBA. As a result of the compact the Delaware Memorial Bridge Police Department was renamed the Delaware River and Bay Authority Police.

In 1964 a ferry service between Cape May, New Jersey, and Lewes, Delaware, was begun by the DRBA. In April 1984 a police station was opened in Cape May establishing a security presence. Another police station was opened in Lewes in January 1986.

The Authority took over airport management and operations at Wilmington Airport following a 30-year lease agreement with New Castle County Council in May 1995 and the FAA&#x27;s approval in June 1995. In November 1996, the department received the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies&#x27; national accreditation award. In November 2005, the Department was re-accredited by CALEA.

<text>Cross-cultural studies, sometimes called holocultural studies or comparative studies, is a specialization in anthropology and sister sciences such as sociology, psychology, economics, political science that uses field data from many societies through comparative research to examine the scope of human behavior and test hypotheses about human behavior and culture.

Cross-cultural studies is the third form of cross-cultural comparisons. The first is comparison of case studies, the second is controlled comparison among variants of a common derivation, and the third is comparison within a sample of cases. Unlike comparative studies, which examines similar characteristics of a few societies, cross-cultural studies uses a sufficiently large sample so that statistical analysis can be made to show relationships or lack of relationships between the traits in question. These studies are surveys of ethnographic data, or involve qualitative data collection.

Cross-cultural studies are applied widely in the social sciences, particularly in cultural anthropology and psychology.

==History==
The first cross-cultural studies were carried out by 19th-century anthropologists such as Edward Burnett Tylor and Lewis H. Morgan. One of Edward Tylor&#x27;s first studies gave rise to the central statistical issue of cross-cultural studies: phylogenetic autocorrelation also known as &quot;Galton&#x27;s problem&quot;. In the recent decades historians and particularly historians of science started looking at the mechanism and networks by which knowledge, ideas, skills, instruments and books moved across cultures, generating new and fresh concepts concerning the order of things in nature. In &quot;Cross-Cultural Scientific Exchanges in the Eastern Mediterranean 1560–1660&quot; Avner Ben-Zaken has argued that cross-cultural exchanges take place at a cultural hazy locus where the margins of one culture overlaps the other, creating a &quot;mutually embraced zone&quot; where exchanges take place on mundane ways. From such a stimulating zone, ideas, styles, instruments and practices move onward to the cultural centers, urging them to renew and update cultural notions.

==Modern era==

The modern era of cross-cultural studies began with George Murdock (1949), who set up a number of foundational data sets, including the Human Relations Area Files, and the &quot;Ethnographic Atlas.&quot; Together with Douglas R. White, he developed the widely-used Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, which is currently maintained by the open access electronic journal World Cultures.

Hofstede&#x27;s cultural dimensions theory is a framework for cross-cultural communication, developed by Geert Hofstede in the 1970s. It describes the effects of a society&#x27;s culture on the values of its members, and how these values relate to behavior, using a structure derived from factor analysis. The original theory proposed four dimensions along which cultural values could be analyzed: individualism-collectivism; uncertainty avoidance; power distance (strength of social hierarchy) and masculinity-femininity (task-orientation versus person-orientation). It has been refined several times since then.

With the widespread access of people to the Internet and the high influence of online social networks on daily life, users behavior in these websites have become a new resource to perform cross-cultural and comparative studies. A study on Twitter examined the usage of emoticons from users of 78 countries and found a positive correlation between individualism-collectivism dimension of Hofstede&#x27;s cultural dimensions theory and people&#x27;s use of mouth-oriented emoticons. Another user experience study on the usage of smileys from users of 12 countries showed that emoji-based scales may ease the challenges related to translation and implementation for brief cross-cultural surveys.

<text>A prior probability distribution of an uncertain quantity, simply called the prior, is its assumed probability distribution before some evidence is taken into account. For example, the prior could be the probability distribution representing the relative proportions of voters who will vote for a particular politician in a future election. The unknown quantity may be a parameter of the model or a latent variable rather than an observable variable.

In Bayesian statistics, Bayes&#x27; rule prescribes how to update the prior with new information to obtain the posterior probability distribution, which is the conditional distribution of the uncertain quantity given new data. Historically, the choice of priors was often constrained to a conjugate family of a given likelihood function, so that it would result in a tractable posterior of the same family. The widespread availability of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, however, has made this less of a concern.

There are many ways to construct a prior distribution. In some cases, a prior may be determined from past information, such as previous experiments. A prior can also be &quot;elicited&quot; from the purely subjective assessment of an experienced expert. When no information is available, an uninformative prior may be adopted as justified by the principle of indifference. In modern applications, priors are also often chosen for their mechanical properties, such as regularization and feature selection.

The prior distributions of model parameters will often depend on parameters of their own. Uncertainty about these hyperparameters can, in turn, be expressed as hyperprior probability distributions. For example, if one uses a beta distribution to model the distribution of the parameter &quot;p&quot; of a Bernoulli distribution, then:
* &quot;p&quot; is a parameter of the underlying system (Bernoulli distribution), and
* &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; are parameters of the prior distribution (beta distribution); hence &quot;hyper&quot;parameters.
In principle, priors can be decomposed into many conditional levels of distributions, so-called &quot;hierarchical priors&quot;.

== Informative priors ==
An &quot;informative prior&quot; expresses specific, definite information about a variable.
An example is a prior distribution for the temperature at noon tomorrow.
A reasonable approach is to make the prior a normal distribution with expected value equal to today&#x27;s noontime temperature, with variance equal to the day-to-day variance of atmospheric temperature,
or a distribution of the temperature for that day of the year.

This example has a property in common with many priors, namely, that the posterior from one problem (today&#x27;s temperature) becomes the prior for another problem (tomorrow&#x27;s temperature); pre-existing evidence which has already been taken into account is part of the prior and, as more evidence accumulates, the posterior is determined largely by the evidence rather than any original assumption, provided that the original assumption admitted the possibility of what the evidence is suggesting. The terms &quot;prior&quot; and &quot;posterior&quot; are generally relative to a specific datum or observation.

===Strong prior===
A strong prior is a preceding assumption, theory, concept or idea upon which, after taking account of new information, a current assumption, theory, concept or idea is founded. A strong prior is a type of informative prior in which the information contained in the prior distribution dominates the information contained in the data being analyzed. The Bayesian analysis combines the information contained in the prior with that extracted from the data to produce the posterior distribution which, in the case of a &quot;strong prior&quot;, would be little changed from the prior distribution.

== Weakly informative priors ==
A &quot;weakly informative prior&quot; expresses partial information about a variable, steering the analysis toward solutions that align with existing knowledge without overly constraining the results and preventing extreme estimates. An example is, when setting the prior distribution for the temperature at noon tomorrow in St. Louis, to use a normal distribution with mean 50 degrees Fahrenheit and standard deviation 40 degrees, which very loosely constrains the temperature to the range (10 degrees, 90 degrees) with a small chance of being below -30 degrees or above 130 degrees. The purpose of a weakly informative prior is for regularization, that is, to keep inferences in a reasonable range.

== Uninformative priors == 
An &quot;uninformative&quot;, &quot;flat&quot;, or &quot;diffuse prior&quot; expresses vague or general information about a variable. The term &quot;uninformative prior&quot; is somewhat of a misnomer. Such a prior might also be called a &quot;not very informative prior&quot;, or an &quot;objective prior&quot;, i.e. one that is not subjectively elicited.

Uninformative priors can express &quot;objective&quot; information such as &quot;the variable is positive&quot; or &quot;the variable is less than some limit&quot;. The simplest and oldest rule for determining a non-informative prior is the principle of indifference, which assigns equal probabilities to all possibilities. In parameter estimation problems, the use of an uninformative prior typically yields results which are not too different from conventional statistical analysis, as the likelihood function often yields more information than the uninformative prior.

Some attempts have been made at finding a priori probabilities, i.e. probability distributions in some sense logically required by the nature of one&#x27;s state of uncertainty; these are a subject of philosophical controversy, with Bayesians being roughly divided into two schools: &quot;objective Bayesians&quot;, who believe such priors exist in many useful situations, and &quot;subjective Bayesians&quot; who believe that in practice priors usually represent subjective judgements of opinion that cannot be rigorously justified (Williamson 2010). Perhaps the strongest arguments for objective Bayesianism were given by Edwin T. Jaynes, based mainly on the consequences of symmetries and on the principle of maximum entropy.

As an example of an a priori prior, due to Jaynes (2003), consider a situation in which one knows a ball has been hidden under one of three cups, A, B, or C, but no other information is available about its location. In this case a &quot;uniform prior&quot; of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) = &quot;p&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) = &quot;p&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) = 1/3 seems intuitively like the only reasonable choice. More formally, we can see that the problem remains the same if we swap around the labels (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;) of the cups. It would therefore be odd to choose a prior for which a permutation of the labels would cause a change in our predictions about which cup the ball will be found under; the uniform prior is the only one which preserves this invariance. If one accepts this invariance principle then one can see that the uniform prior is the logically correct prior to represent this state of knowledge. This prior is &quot;objective&quot; in the sense of being the correct choice to represent a particular state of knowledge, but it is not objective in the sense of being an observer-independent feature of the world: in reality the ball exists under a particular cup, and it only makes sense to speak of probabilities in this situation if there is an observer with limited knowledge about the system.

As a more contentious example, Jaynes published an argument based on the invariance of the prior under a change of parameters that suggests that the prior representing complete uncertainty about a probability should be the Haldane prior &quot;p&quot;−1(1 − &quot;p&quot;)−1. The example Jaynes gives is of finding a chemical in a lab and asking whether it will dissolve in water in repeated experiments. The Haldane prior gives by far the most weight to formula_1 and formula_2, indicating that the sample will either dissolve every time or never dissolve, with equal probability. However, if one has observed samples of the chemical to dissolve in one experiment and not to dissolve in another experiment then this prior is updated to the uniform distribution on the interval [0, 1]. This is obtained by applying Bayes&#x27; theorem to the data set consisting of one observation of dissolving and one of not dissolving, using the above prior. The Haldane prior is an improper prior distribution (meaning that it has an infinite mass). Harold Jeffreys devised a systematic way for designing uninformative priors as e.g., Jeffreys prior &quot;p&quot;−1/2(1 − &quot;p&quot;)−1/2 for the Bernoulli random variable.

Priors can be constructed which are proportional to the Haar measure if the parameter space &quot;X&quot; carries a natural group structure which leaves invariant our Bayesian state of knowledge. This can be seen as a generalisation of the invariance principle used to justify the uniform prior over the three cups in the example above. For example, in physics we might expect that an experiment will give the same results regardless of our choice of the origin of a coordinate system. This induces the group structure of the translation group on &quot;X&quot;, which determines the prior probability as a constant improper prior. Similarly, some measurements are naturally invariant to the choice of an arbitrary scale (e.g., whether centimeters or inches are used, the physical results should be equal). In such a case, the scale group is the natural group structure, and the corresponding prior on &quot;X&quot; is proportional to 1/&quot;x&quot;. It sometimes matters whether we use the left-invariant or right-invariant Haar measure. For example, the left and right invariant Haar measures on the affine group are not equal. Berger (1985, p. 413) argues that the right-invariant Haar measure is the correct choice.

Another idea, championed by Edwin T. Jaynes, is to use the principle of maximum entropy (MAXENT). The motivation is that the Shannon entropy of a probability distribution measures the amount of information contained in the distribution. The larger the entropy, the less information is provided by the distribution. Thus, by maximizing the entropy over a suitable set of probability distributions on &quot;X&quot;, one finds the distribution that is least informative in the sense that it contains the least amount of information consistent with the constraints that define the set. For example, the maximum entropy prior on a discrete space, given only that the probability is normalized to 1, is the prior that assigns equal probability to each state. And in the continuous case, the maximum entropy prior given that the density is normalized with mean zero and unit variance is the standard normal distribution. The principle of &quot;minimum cross-entropy&quot; generalizes MAXENT to the case of &quot;updating&quot; an arbitrary prior distribution with suitable constraints in the maximum-entropy sense.

A related idea, reference priors, was introduced by José-Miguel Bernardo. Here, the idea is to maximize the expected Kullback–Leibler divergence of the posterior distribution relative to the prior. This maximizes the expected posterior information about &quot;X&quot; when the prior density is &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;); thus, in some sense, &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the &quot;least informative&quot; prior about X. The reference prior is defined in the asymptotic limit, i.e., one considers the limit of the priors so obtained as the number of data points goes to infinity. In the present case, the KL divergence between the prior and posterior distributions is given by
formula_3

Here, formula_4 is a sufficient statistic for some parameter formula_5. The inner integral is the KL divergence between the posterior formula_6 and prior formula_7 distributions and the result is the weighted mean over all values of formula_4. Splitting the logarithm into two parts, reversing the order of integrals in the second part and noting that formula_9 does not depend on formula_4 yields
formula_11

The inner integral in the second part is the integral over formula_4 of the joint density formula_13. This is the marginal distribution formula_7, so we have
formula_15

Now we use the concept of entropy which, in the case of probability distributions, is the negative expected value of the logarithm of the probability mass or density function or formula_16 Using this in the last equation yields
formula_17

In words, KL is the negative expected value over formula_4 of the entropy of formula_5 conditional on formula_4 plus the marginal (i.e. unconditional) entropy of formula_5. In the limiting case where the sample size tends to infinity, the Bernstein-von Mises theorem states that the distribution of formula_5 conditional on a given observed value of formula_4 is normal with a variance equal to the reciprocal of the Fisher information at the &#x27;true&#x27; value of formula_5. The entropy of a normal density function is equal to half the logarithm of formula_25 where formula_26 is the variance of the distribution. In this case therefore formula_27 where formula_28 is the arbitrarily large sample size (to which Fisher information is proportional) and formula_29 is the &#x27;true&#x27; value. Since this does not depend on formula_4 it can be taken out of the integral, and as this integral is over a probability space it equals one. Hence we can write the asymptotic form of KL as
formula_31
where formula_32 is proportional to the (asymptotically large) sample size. We do not know the value of formula_29. Indeed, the very idea goes against the philosophy of Bayesian inference in which &#x27;true&#x27; values of parameters are replaced by prior and posterior distributions. So we remove formula_29 by replacing it with formula_5 and taking the expected value of the normal entropy, which we obtain by multiplying by formula_7 and integrating over formula_5. This allows us to combine the logarithms yielding
formula_38

This is a quasi-KL divergence (&quot;quasi&quot; in the sense that the square root of the Fisher information may be the kernel of an improper distribution). Due to the minus sign, we need to minimise this in order to maximise the KL divergence with which we started. The minimum value of the last equation occurs where the two distributions in the logarithm argument, improper or not, do not diverge. This in turn occurs when the prior distribution is proportional to the square root of the Fisher information of the likelihood function. Hence in the single parameter case, reference priors and Jeffreys priors are identical, even though Jeffreys has a very different rationale.

Reference priors are often the objective prior of choice in multivariate problems, since other rules (e.g., Jeffreys&#x27; rule) may result in priors with problematic behavior.

Objective prior distributions may also be derived from other principles, such as information or coding theory (see e.g. minimum description length) or frequentist statistics (so-called probability matching priors). Such methods are used in Solomonoff&#x27;s theory of inductive inference. Constructing objective priors have been recently introduced in bioinformatics, and specially inference in cancer systems biology, where sample size is limited and a vast amount of prior knowledge is available. In these methods, either an information theory based criterion, such as KL divergence or log-likelihood function for binary supervised learning problems and mixture model problems.

Philosophical problems associated with uninformative priors are associated with the choice of an appropriate metric, or measurement scale. Suppose we want a prior for the running speed of a runner who is unknown to us. We could specify, say, a normal distribution as the prior for his speed, but alternatively we could specify a normal prior for the time he takes to complete 100 metres, which is proportional to the reciprocal of the first prior. These are very different priors, but it is not clear which is to be preferred. Jaynes&#x27; method of transformation groups can answer this question in some situations.

Similarly, if asked to estimate an unknown proportion between 0 and 1, we might say that all proportions are equally likely, and use a uniform prior. Alternatively, we might say that all orders of magnitude for the proportion are equally likely, the , which is the uniform prior on the logarithm of proportion. The Jeffreys prior attempts to solve this problem by computing a prior which expresses the same belief no matter which metric is used. The Jeffreys prior for an unknown proportion &quot;p&quot; is &quot;p&quot;−1/2(1 − &quot;p&quot;)−1/2, which differs from Jaynes&#x27; recommendation.

Priors based on notions of algorithmic probability are used in inductive inference as a basis for induction in very general settings.

Practical problems associated with uninformative priors include the requirement that the posterior distribution be proper. The usual uninformative priors on continuous, unbounded variables are improper. This need not be a problem if the posterior distribution is proper. Another issue of importance is that if an uninformative prior is to be used &quot;routinely&quot;, i.e., with many different data sets, it should have good frequentist properties. Normally a Bayesian would not be concerned with such issues, but it can be important in this situation. For example, one would want any decision rule based on the posterior distribution to be admissible under the adopted loss function. Unfortunately, admissibility is often difficult to check, although some results are known (e.g., Berger and Strawderman 1996). The issue is particularly acute with hierarchical Bayes models; the usual priors (e.g., Jeffreys&#x27; prior) may give badly inadmissible decision rules if employed at the higher levels of the hierarchy.

== Improper priors ==
Let events formula_39 be mutually exclusive and exhaustive. If Bayes&#x27; theorem is written as
formula_40
then it is clear that the same result would be obtained if all the prior probabilities &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;) and &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot;&quot;j&quot;) were multiplied by a given constant; the same would be true for a continuous random variable. If the summation in the denominator converges, the posterior probabilities will still sum (or integrate) to 1 even if the prior values do not, and so the priors may only need to be specified in the correct proportion. Taking this idea further, in many cases the sum or integral of the prior values may not even need to be finite to get sensible answers for the posterior probabilities. When this is the case, the prior is called an improper prior. However, the posterior distribution need not be a proper distribution if the prior is improper. This is clear from the case where event &quot;B&quot; is independent of all of the &quot;A&quot;&quot;j&quot;.

Statisticians sometimes use improper priors as uninformative priors. For example, if they need a prior distribution for the mean and variance of a random variable, they may assume &quot;p&quot;(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) ~ 1/&quot;v&quot; (for &quot;v&quot; &gt; 0) which would suggest that any value for the mean is &quot;equally likely&quot; and that a value for the positive variance becomes &quot;less likely&quot; in inverse proportion to its value. Many authors (Lindley, 1973; De Groot, 1937; Kass and Wasserman, 1996) warn against the danger of over-interpreting those priors since they are not probability densities. The only relevance they have is found in the corresponding posterior, as long as it is well-defined for all observations. (The Haldane prior is a typical counterexample.)

By contrast, likelihood functions do not need to be integrated, and a likelihood function that is uniformly 1 corresponds to the absence of data (all models are equally likely, given no data): Bayes&#x27; rule multiplies a prior by the likelihood, and an empty product is just the constant likelihood 1. However, without starting with a prior probability distribution, one does not end up getting a posterior probability distribution, and thus cannot integrate or compute expected values or loss. See for details.

=== Examples ===
Examples of improper priors include:
* The uniform distribution on an infinite interval (i.e., a half-line or the entire real line).
* Beta(0,0), the beta distribution for &quot;α&quot;=0, &quot;β&quot;=0 (uniform distribution on log-odds scale).
* The logarithmic prior on the positive reals (uniform distribution on log scale).

These functions, interpreted as uniform distributions, can also be interpreted as the likelihood function in the absence of data, but are not proper priors.

==Prior probability in statistical mechanics==
While in Bayesian statistics the prior probability is used to represent initial beliefs about an uncertain parameter, in statistical mechanics the a priori probability is used to describe the initial state of a system. The classical version is defined as the ratio of the number of elementary events (e.g. the number of times a die is thrown) to the total number of events—and these considered purely deductively, i.e. without any experimenting. In the case of the die if we look at it on the table without throwing it, each elementary event is reasoned deductively to have the same probability—thus the probability of each outcome of an imaginary throwing of the (perfect) die or simply by counting the number of faces is 1/6. Each face of the die appears with equal probability—probability being a measure defined for each elementary event. The result is different if we throw the die twenty times and ask how many times (out of 20) the number 6 appears on the upper face. In this case time comes into play and we have a different type of probability depending on time or the number of times the die is thrown. On the other hand, the a priori probability is independent of time—you can look at the die on the table as long as you like without touching it and you deduce the probability for the number 6 to appear on the upper face is 1/6. 

In statistical mechanics, e.g. that of a gas contained in a finite volume formula_41, both the spatial coordinates formula_42 and the momentum coordinates formula_43 of the individual gas elements (atoms or molecules) are finite in the phase space spanned by these coordinates. In analogy to the case of the die, the a priori probability is here (in the case of a continuum) proportional to the phase space volume element formula_44 divided by formula_45, and is the number of standing waves (i.e. states) therein, where formula_46 is the range of the variable formula_47 and formula_48 is the range of the variable formula_49 (here for simplicity considered in one dimension). In 1 dimension (length formula_50) this number or statistical weight or a priori weighting is formula_51. In customary 3 dimensions (volume formula_52) the corresponding number can be calculated to be formula_53. In order to understand this quantity as giving a number of states in quantum (i.e. wave) mechanics, recall that in quantum mechanics every particle is associated with a matter wave which is the solution of a Schrödinger equation. In the case of free particles (of energy formula_54) like those of a gas in a box of volume formula_55 such a matter wave is explicitly
formula_56
where formula_57 are integers. The number of different formula_58 values and hence states in the region between formula_59 is then found to be the above expression formula_60 by considering the area covered by these points. 
Moreover, in view of the uncertainty relation, which in 1 spatial dimension is
formula_61
these states are indistinguishable (i.e. these states do not carry labels). An important consequence is a result known as Liouville&#x27;s theorem, i.e. the time independence of this phase space volume element and thus of the a priori probability. A time dependence of this quantity would imply known information about the dynamics of the system, and hence would not be an a priori probability. Thus the region
formula_62
when differentiated with respect to time formula_63 yields zero (with the help of Hamilton&#x27;s equations): The volume at time formula_63 is the same as at time zero. One describes this also as conservation of information. 

In the full quantum theory one has an analogous conservation law. In this case, the phase space region is replaced by a subspace of the space of states expressed in terms of a projection operator formula_65, and instead of the probability in phase space, one has the probability density
formula_66
where formula_67 is the dimensionality of the subspace. The conservation law in this case is expressed by the unitarity of the S-matrix. In either case, the considerations assume a closed isolated system. This closed isolated system is a system with (1) a fixed energy formula_68 and (2) a fixed number of particles formula_67 in (c) a state of equilibrium. If one considers a huge number of replicas of this system, one obtains what is called a &quot;microcanonical ensemble&quot;. It is for this system that one postulates in quantum statistics the &quot;fundamental postulate of equal a priori probabilities of an isolated system.&quot; This says that the isolated system in equilibrium occupies each of its accessible states with the same probability. This fundamental postulate therefore allows us to equate the a priori probability to the degeneracy of a system, i.e. to the number of different states with the same energy.

===Example===
The following example illustrates the a priori probability (or a priori weighting) in (a) classical and (b) quantal contexts.
{\sin^2\theta}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The formula_70-curve for constant E and formula_71 is an ellipse of area 
formula_72
By integrating over formula_71 and formula_74 the total volume of phase space covered for constant energy E is 
formula_75
and hence the classical a priori weighting in the energy range formula_76 is
:formula_77 (phase space volume at formula_78) minus (phase space volume at formula_68) is given by formula_80
| 2 = Quantum a priori probability

Assuming that the number of quantum states in a range formula_81 for each direction of motion is given, per element, by a factor formula_82, the number of states in the energy range dE is, as seen under (a) formula_83 for the rotating diatomic molecule. From wave mechanics it is known that the energy levels of a
rotating diatomic molecule are given by
formula_84
each such level being (2n+1)-fold degenerate. By evaluating formula_85
one obtains
formula_86
Thus by comparison with formula_87 above, one finds that the approximate number of states in the range dE is given by the degeneracy, i.e.
formula_88
Thus the a priori weighting in the classical context (a) corresponds to the a priori weighting here in the quantal context (b).
In the case of the one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator of natural frequency formula_89 one finds correspondingly: (a) formula_90, and (b) formula_91 (no degeneracy).
Thus in quantum mechanics the a priori probability is effectively a measure of the degeneracy, i.e. the number of states having the same energy. 

In the case of the hydrogen atom or Coulomb potential (where the evaluation of the phase space volume for constant energy is more complicated) one knows that the quantum mechanical degeneracy is formula_92 with formula_93. Thus in this case formula_94.
===Priori probability and distribution functions===

In statistical mechanics (see any book) one derives the so-called distribution functions formula_95 for various statistics. In the case of Fermi–Dirac statistics and Bose–Einstein statistics these functions are 
respectively
formula_96
These functions are derived for (1) a system in dynamic equilibrium (i.e. under steady, uniform conditions) with (2) total (and huge) number of particles formula_97 (this condition determines the constant formula_98), and (3) total energy formula_99, i.e. with each of the formula_100 particles having the energy formula_101. An important aspect in the derivation is the taking into account of the indistinguishability of particles and states in quantum statistics, i.e. there particles and states do not have labels. In the case of fermions, like electrons, obeying the Pauli principle (only one particle per state or none allowed), one has therefore
formula_102
Thus formula_103 is a measure of the fraction of states actually occupied by electrons at energy formula_101 and temperature formula_105. On the other hand, the a priori probability formula_106 is a measure of the number of wave mechanical states available. Hence
formula_107
Since formula_100 is constant under uniform conditions (as many particles as flow out of a volume element also flow in steadily, so that the situation in the element appears static), i.e. independent of time formula_109, and formula_106 is also independent of time formula_109 as shown earlier, we obtain
formula_112
Expressing this equation in terms of its partial derivatives, one obtains the Boltzmann transport equation. How do coordinates formula_113 etc. appear here suddenly? Above no mention was made of electric or other fields. Thus with no such fields present we have the Fermi-Dirac distribution as above. But with such fields present we have this additional dependence of formula_95.

<text>The State University of New York at Albany (commonly referred to as the University at Albany, UAlbany, or SUNY Albany) is a public research university in Albany, New York, United States. Founded in 1844, it is one of four &quot;university centers&quot; of the State University of New York (SUNY) system.

The university enrolls 16,849 students in nine schools and colleges, which offer 50 undergraduate majors and 125 graduate degree programs. Through the UAlbany and SUNY-wide exchange programs, students have more than 600 study-abroad programs to choose from, as well as government and business internship opportunities in New York&#x27;s capital and surrounding region. Portions of the campus extend into Guilderland, and the health sciences campus is located in neighboring Rensselaer, New York.

It is classified among &quot;Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. The research enterprise totaled expenditures of $115 million in fiscal year 2021 and was focused in four areas: social science, public law and policy, life sciences and atmospheric sciences. UAlbany is home to the New York State Writers Institute.

==History==
The University at Albany was an independent state-supported teachers&#x27; college for most of its history until SUNY was formed in 1948. The institution began as the New York State Normal School (or Albany Normal School) on May 7, 1844, by a vote of the State Legislature. Beginning with 29 students and four faculty in an abandoned railroad depot on State Street in the heart of the city, the Normal School was the first New York State-chartered public institution of higher education.

Originally dedicated to training New York students as schoolteachers and administrators, by the early 1890s the &quot;School&quot; had become the New York State Normal College at Albany and, with a revised four-year curriculum in 1905, became the first public institution of higher education in New York to be granted the power to confer the bachelor&#x27;s degree.

A new campus—today, UAlbany&#x27;s Downtown Campus—was built in 1909 on a site of between Washington and Western avenues. By 1913, the institution was home to 590 students and 44 faculty members, offered a master&#x27;s degree for the first time, and bore a new name—the New York State College for Teachers at Albany. Enrollment grew to a peak of 1,424 in 1932. By this time, the College for Teachers, or &quot;Albany State&quot; as it was often called for short, had developed a curriculum similar to those found at four-year liberal arts colleges, but it did not abandon its primary focus on training teachers.

In 1948 the State University of New York system was created, with the College for Teachers and the state&#x27;s other teacher-training schools serving as the nuclei. SUNY, including the Albany campus, became a manifestation of the vision of Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, who wanted a public university system to accommodate the college students of the post–World War II baby boom. To do so, he launched a massive construction program that developed more than 50 new campuses. Reflecting a broadening mission, the College for Teachers changed its name to SUNY College of Education at Albany in 1959. In 1961, it became a four-year liberal arts college as the State University College at Albany.
In 1962, the State University College was designated a doctoral-degree granting university center. The same year, Rockefeller broke ground for the current Uptown Campus on the former site of the Albany Country Club. The new campus&#x27; first dormitory opened in 1964, and the first classes on the academic podium in the fall of 1966. By 1970, enrollment had grown to 13,200 and the faculty to 746. That same year, the growing protest movement against the Vietnam war engulfed the university when a student strike was called for in response to the killing of protesters at Kent State. In 1985, the university added the School of Public Health, a joint endeavor with the state&#x27;s Department of Health.

In 1983, the New York State Writers Institute was founded by Pulitzer Prize-winning author William Kennedy. As of 2013, the Institute had hosted, over time, more than 1,200 writers, poets, journalists, historians, dramatists and filmmakers. The list includes eight Nobel Prize winners, nearly 200 Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award winners, several Motion Picture Academy Award winners and nominees, and numerous other literary prize recipients. In addition, the institute has hosted up-and-coming writers to provide them with exposure at the beginning of their writing careers.

During the 1990s, the university built a $3 billion, Albany NanoTech complex, extending the Uptown Campus westward. By 2006, this addition became home to the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering, which in 2014 merged with the State University of New York Institute of Technology in Utica, New York, to become a separate SUNY institution: the SUNY Polytechnic Institute. This was reversed in 2023, when the college rejoined UAlbany as part of the College of Nanotechnology, Science, and Engineering.

In 1996, a third campus—the East Campus, renamed the Health Sciences Campus in 2016—was added east of the Uptown Campus in Rensselaer County, when the university acquired former Sterling-Winthrop laboratories and converted them into labs, classrooms, and a business incubator concentrating on advances in biotechnology and other health-related disciplines. In 2005, this campus became home to the university&#x27;s Gen*NY*Sis Center for Excellence in Cancer Genomics.

In 2004, the university launched the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE), the first college in the nation to focus exclusively on nanotechonology, semiconductor development and chip manufacturing. In 2014, the college merged with SUNY IT to become SUNY Polytechnic Institute. In 2023, CNSE was reunified with UAlbany to form the College of Nanotechnology, Science, and Engineering.

In 2005, the university created a College of Computing and Information, with faculty on both the Uptown and Downtown campuses. In the fall of 2015, the college was replaced and its programs incorporated into the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. At the same time, the university opened another new college, the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security and Cybersecurity.

In 2016, the university launched its first undergraduate degree in computer engineering as part of the newly formed College of Engineering &amp; Applied Sciences. The college later added undergraduate and graduate programs in electrical and computer engineering, environmental and sustainable engineering along with preexisting programs in computer science.

On June 21, 2017, Havidan Rodriguez, founding provost of the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley and former interim president of the University of Texas-Pan American, was named the 20th president of the university, a position he assumed in September 2017. Rodríguez, became the first Hispanic/Latino president of any of the four-year SUNY campuses.

==Campuses==

===Uptown Campus===

The Uptown Campus, the university&#x27;s main campus, is located mostly in Albany, with a small portion (a dorm &quot;quad&quot; and the athletics complex) spilling into the McKownville neighborhood in the neighboring town of Guilderland (official address: 1400 Washington Avenue in Albany). Its visual effect has been described as &quot;Dazzling one-of-a-kind&quot; by architectural critic Thomas A. Gaines, who called it &quot;a formal masterpiece&quot; and &quot;a study in classical romanticism.&quot; Designed in 1961–1962 by noted American architect Edward Durell Stone and constructed from 1963 to 1964, the campus bears Stone&#x27;s signature style that includes towers, domes, fountains, soaring colonnades, sweeping canopies, and other architectural features typical for the era. Stone&#x27;s campus layout emphasizes residential quadrangles, also known as &quot;quads&quot;, surrounding the academic buildings.

At the hub of the Uptown Campus is the rectangular &quot;Academic Podium&quot;, featuring 13 three-story buildings under a single overhanging canopy roof. The Podium&#x27;s showpiece is a central pool with fountains and an off-center circular bell tower, or &quot;Carillon&quot;, which also serves as a water storage reservoir. In April 2012, the university undertook a complete renovation of the main fountain and water tower area, as well as of the Campus Center fountain. There is LED lighting in the base of the fountain, and a new, more interactive center element with seating areas. Completion of the project is scheduled for fall 2013.

The domed Main Library, the Performing Arts Center, and Campus Center face the pool from the west, east and south, respectively. The Campus Center was under construction from Spring 2015 and was finally completed Fall of 2017 adding more space and dining options for students. To the north is a grand entrance, which welcomes visitors by way of a &quot;great lawn&quot; (Collins Circle) and the university&#x27;s Entry Plaza. Four residential quadrangles are located adjacent to the four corners of the academic podium. Each quad consists of a 23-story high-rise dormitory surrounded by a square of low-rise buildings.

On the west end of the Uptown Campus is the university&#x27;s meteorology and characterization tools, the National Weather Service (NWS), and the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC).

In addition to the Main Library, the Uptown Campus became home in 1999 to the third of the three libraries comprising UAlbany&#x27;s University Libraries: the Science Library. Further growth occurred on the Uptown Campus in the fall of 2004, when a new Life Sciences Building opened, dedicated to basic research and education. New residence halls, Empire Commons and Liberty Terrace, opened in 2002 and 2012, housing up to 1,200 and 500 students, respectively, Ground was broken for a new School of Business building in October 2008. The 80,000-square-foot facility, located on the west side of Collins Circle, opened in August 2013.

===Downtown Campus===

The Downtown Campus, located at 135 Western Ave., Albany, just one mile (1.6 km) from the New York State Capitol building and Empire State Plaza, is the site of the original New York State College for Teachers. Construction began in 1909 on the first three buildings: Draper, Husted and Hawley halls, after the previous location on Willett Street burned down. Later additions to the campus were Richardson Hall, Page Hall and The Milne School (all in 1929), as well as 1960s&#x27; additions to Draper and Richardson halls. Husted Hall underwent major renovations in 2009. A subsequent energy efficiency project at Husted Hall was awarded a High Performance Building Plaque from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA).

The Downtown Campus is home to the university&#x27;s Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy, School of Criminal Justice, College of Computing and Information, and School of Social Welfare. It also houses one of the university&#x27;s three libraries, the Thomas E. Dewey Graduate Library, located in Hawley Hall.

UAlbany purchased the Old Albany High School, also known as the Schuyler Building, in 2013 and is renovating it as the home for the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. It will house the Dean&#x27;s Office as well as the Departments of Computer Science and Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering.

===Health Sciences Campus===

The university&#x27;s Health Sciences Campus, located in the City of Rensselaer, is home to UAlbany&#x27;s School of Public Health and the Cancer Research Center (CRC) which opened in 2005. Located also on the campus—which contains of lab, support and associated office space—is the Center for Functional Genomics, which does research in the areas of microarrays, proteomics, molecular biology and transgenics. Also based at the campus are 15 private biotechnology companies, both established and those which form part of the university&#x27;s business incubator program. Biopharmaceutical giant Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility adjacent to the campus where it produces investigational products for all its clinical trials.

===Uptown Campus housing===
The Uptown Campus is home to seven of the university&#x27;s eight residential complexes. Four of these—Indigenous Quad, Dutch Quad, Colonial Quad, and State Quad—sit at the Academic Podium&#x27;s corners; each consists of eight three-story, low-rise buildings encircling a 22-story tower with a capacity of 1,200 students each, as well as a game room and fitness center. Originally, each quad consisted of a dining hall but as of the Fall 2017 semester, Dutch Quad and Colonial Quad no longer maintain a dining hall. The four quads serve as a chronological timeline of New York State history, beginning with Indigenous Quad, moving clockwise to Dutch, then Colonial, and finally, State. The other three, Freedom Apartments, Empire Commons, and Liberty Terrace, are reserved for juniors and seniors. These are &quot;apartment-style&quot; residences and include kitchens, furnished living rooms, and, on Empire Commons, washers, dryers, dishwashers, single bedrooms, and central air conditioning. The university&#x27;s newest apartment-style residential complex, Liberty Terrace, opened in the fall of 2012.

The Uptown Campus also contains special housing for students enrolled in UAlbany&#x27;s Honors College. This housing, offered to incoming freshmen and returning sophomores, is found on State Quad in the Melville and Steinmetz halls, which were renovated in 2010. Renovations were completed on Indigenous Quad during the summer of 2013, State and Alumni Quads are still undergoing work. In March 2021, Indian Quad was renamed to Indigenous Quad following a series of petitions and complaints from students, faculty, and alumni.

==Buildings and facilities==

===Campus Center===
The Campus Center, located on the Uptown Campus Podium, has traditionally been the community center of the University at Albany, serving students, faculty, professional staff, alumni, and guests. Considered the &quot;hearthstone&quot; or &quot;living room&quot; of the campus, the Campus Center has provided services that include lounging areas, cafeterias, a Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore, and national chain eateries operated and staffed by Sodexo. The structure has been the site for informal and formal interactions, the latter including the meetings of student-run clubs, academic conferences, and cultural functions.

A $62.2 million renovation and expansion project includes the Campus Center East addition, completed in September 2015, and a West addition which opened in June 2017. The latter includes a new 400-seat auditorium and, as of the fall of 2018, enhanced dining facilities with market-style food service venues. Current students are using the new food court that arrived with Campus Center East. The Campus Center has many restaurants for a variety of dining options, such as pizza, Thai cuisine, sushi, etc.

===Performing Arts Center===
The Performing Arts Center is a facility on the Uptown Campus containing five performance spaces. Music, dance, theater, international artists, guest lecturers, and collaborations occur in the Main Theater, Recital Hall, Arena Theatre, Studio Theatre, and Lab Theatre. The Main Theatre is the largest theater space on the Uptown campus, capable of seating 500 people. Designed for music performance, the Recital Hall seats 242 people, 197 on the orchestra level and 45 in the nine circular theater boxes along the periphery on the second level. The Arena Theatre is used primarily for small theater performances and acting classes and seats 196. The Studio Theatre seats 153 people.

===The Athletic Complex===
UAlbany unveiled a new football stadium, Bob Ford Field, on September 14, 2013, as part of a $19 million multi-sport complex. The Great Danes opened against the University of Rhode Island. The stadium, named for the coach who guided the football program to 265 victories from 1973 to 2013, is an 8,500-seat facility which includes a press level with four luxury suites, a print media area, and booths for radio, television, coaches, and replay, as well as 20 high-definition televisions distributed throughout the level. In the summer of 2015, following a multimillion-dollar donation by Tom and Mary Casey, the complex was officially renamed the Bob Ford Field at Casey Stadium.

===Broadview Arena===
In the fall of 2023, the university opened Broadview Arena, which had been known as SEFCU Arena since 1992 when the RACC (Recreation and Convocation Center) was renamed. The RACC was an $11 million arena for UAlbany&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball and track teams. It has a 0.11 mile indoor track. They also in 2017 added a $1.4 million scoreboard. The 4,538-seat arena also serves as a major venue for community events such as rock, pop, and hip hop concerts, sporting events and University activities. Although it has an Albany address, it is actually located in the Town of Guilderland.

==Organization==
The university is a first-tier component of the State University of New York. It receives annual appropriations as a part of the SUNY budget, and the New York State University Construction Fund manages and finances buildings and capital improvements. Although the university is governed by the SUNY Board of Trustees, the university does have a separate 10-member council that is appointed by the governor, with one student-elected member. The governor designates the council&#x27;s chair. 

The university has a separate University at Albany Foundation, which conducts fundraising on behalf of the university. For example, when the new library was built, state funds paid for the construction of the building, but the foundation raised $3.5 million to equip the new facility. The foundation has a Board of Directors, which includes three voting member elected by the faculty and one elected by students.

===Massry School of Business===
UAlbany&#x27;s Massry School of Business is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) in both business and accounting (less than 1.2% of all AACSB programs). It was also the first School to be accredited by AACSB at both undergraduate and graduate levels in 1974. Founded in 1962, the School&#x27;s bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and certificate programs enroll full-time and part-time students from all over the world. 

The Digital Forensics B.S. curriculum and research done at the school&#x27;s Department of Information Security and Digital Forensics was used to receive dual designation as a NSA Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education and Research. Since 2011, the school has also offered a Graduate Certificate in Information Security, which is a 15-credit program.
The Financial Market Regulation program works with the Institute for Financial Market Regulation, a cooperative project of professionals involved in financial market regulation and supervision from UAlbany and Albany Law School who develop interdisciplinary research and education in the field. The program concentrates upon four fields: Business, Technology, Law, and Public Policy.

The Massry Center for Business building was unveiled on August 19, 2013. It was structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates.

===School of Criminal Justice===
UAlbany&#x27;s School of Criminal Justice offers programs in criminal justice on the bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral levels. The school was founded in 1966, and spurred what came to be called &quot;the Albany model&quot; for other Ph.D. programs in major universities across the nation and the world.

The school concentrates on crime and societal reactions to crime, including the political, economic and cultural patterns that influence policy choices on the response to crime. A focus of study is the social and personal forces that lead to criminal conduct and the analysis of the organization and operation of crime control systems. Particular emphasis is placed on the interactions among the many agencies which comprise criminal justice systems.

In 2020, the SCJ was integrated into the Rockefeller College of Public Policy, in order to build stronger interdisciplinary connections between the faculty and students in criminal justice, political science, and public policy &amp; administration. 

===School of Education===
The university was founded as the New York Normal School of Teachers in 1844 with David Perkins Page as its first principal. It expanded to become the New York State College for Teachers in 1914, and then, in 1962, the State University of New York at Albany. The School of Education was created that year as part of a multidisciplinary university center and remained the home of the original teacher training programs and faculty, including, from 1845 until its closing in 1977, the Milne School, the university&#x27;s campus laboratory school where prospective teachers carried out their practice teaching.

The school is home to 1,500 graduate students in more than 30 master&#x27;s, certificate, and doctoral programs housed within four departments: Educational Policy &amp; Leadership, Educational and Counseling Psychology, Educational Theory and Practice, and Literacy Teaching and Learning. The school is also home to 15 centers and institutes which aid Capital Region schools and research educational issues. These include the school&#x27;s outreach arm, the Capital Area School Development Association, which provides services to 120 school districts; the Center for the Elimination of Minority Health Disparities, which was funded in 2006 by a three-year $1.24 million grant from the National Institutes of Health; the Center for Urban Youth and Technology; and the National Research Center on English Learning &amp; Achievement, which since 1987 has been funded by the U.S. Department of Education to conduct research dedicated to improving students’ English and literacy achievement.

===College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security and Cybersecurity===
The College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security and Cybersecurity (CEHC), created in 2015, offers interdisciplinary academic programs for undergraduate and graduate students in fields designed to protect against, respond to, and recover from a growing array of natural and man-made risks and threats in New York State and around the world.

Research will be conducted by CEHC faculty and also through faculty-student collaborations and cross-disciplinary research groups. Training programs will be offered to current homeland security and emergency preparedness professionals.

In 2017, the college participated in the New York Excelsior Challenge, a three-and-a half day training event. The Excelsior Challenge consists of training exercises designed to help first responders improve their response capabilities.

===School of Public Health===
The School of Public Health, created in 1985 as a partnership between the University at Albany, State University of New York and the New York State Department of Health. Its mission is to provide education, research, service and leadership to improve public health and eliminate health disparities.

Accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health, the school offers MPH, MS, DrPH and PhD degrees in each of four academic departments: Biomedical Sciences; Environmental Health Sciences; Epidemiology &amp; Biostatistics; and Health Policy, Management &amp; Behavior.

Research interests of the more than 200 doctoral-level faculty include AIDS, GIS, maternal and child health, hospital epidemiology, infectious diseases, environmental and occupational health, eldercare, minority health and health disparities. Both research faculty and students benefit from additional affiliations with Albany Medical Center and Bassett Healthcare.

The School of Public Health&#x27;s partnership with the New York State Department of Health (DOH) has life sciences researchers as part of the university&#x27;s research productivity. Awards for life scientists at the DOH&#x27;s Wadsworth Center make up roughly a third of UAlbany&#x27;s total of $391.7 million

In September 2023, the School of Public Health expanded to include a Department of Nursing. After a nationwide search, the School of Public Health expanded to take the helm of the new College of Integrated Health Sciences, with Erin Bell from the Public Health program named as the new Dean of the College in 2024.

===School of Social Welfare===
The School of Social Welfare (SSW), created in 1965, is currently ranked #43 among programs of social work in the U.S. News &amp; World Report (2024). This is a slight rise of 3 spots from its 2022 ranking. This ranking is second among SUNY schools behind University at Buffalo and 6th among schools and/or programs of social work in New York State (Columbia [#4], NYU [#12], U Buffalo [#24], CUNY Hunter [#28], Fordham [#28]). In addition, it is ranked 177 among social work programs in College Factual (2024).

The school offers bachelor, masters and Ph.D. programs in social work. Past linkages have included those with an Albany elementary school challenged by poverty, an outlier regional community comprising one of the largest Latino populations in the state outside of New York City and other major population centers such as Buffalo. Multiple partnerships with Italy, South Africa and Scotland were active until 2019 before the COVID pandemic, and are planned for re-engagement at an appropriate time in the near future.

The school has a history of dedication in the area of gerontological social work, the creation of aging friendly communities in 2006 and improving pathways to higher education for inner city youth and families through the New York State-funded Liberty Partnership Program. The creation of family support agendas for the region and re-professionalization campaigns in child welfare through the National Child Welfare Workforce Institute were funded from the Children&#x27;s Bureau from 2008 until its termination in 2024.

Features of SSW include the Internships in Aging Program, the Center for Innovations in Mental Health, and the Social Work Education Consortium. In September 2023, it was announced that the School of Social Welfare will be subsumed into the planned College of Integrated Health Sciences. Dr. Victoria Rizzo was named Vice Dean of the new College and Director of Social Welfare, and reports to Dean Erin Bell from Public Health.

===The Honors College===
Planning for the Honors College began in 2003 and first accepted students in fall 2006. Its mission is to create a &quot;small college experience&quot; by fostering and encouraging the creation of closely knit cohorts of motivated students. The Honors College seeks to increase faculty-student interaction early in a student&#x27;s stay at the university.

The Honors College comprises coursework, research, internships, and field-placements. All involve intense collaborations among students and professors. Rather than having a small number of professors teach an honors curriculum, professors from across the UAlbany campus teach honors courses in many disciplines. During the college&#x27;s first three academic years, more than 50 UAlbany professors offered courses.

During their first two years, honors students at explore the range of disciplines through six or more honors courses. During their next two years, students move into the honors program in their major. The Honors College offers special lectures, tours, retreats to Camp Dippikill, and other trips to expand their learning opportunities, and also student social events.

===Libraries===
The university contains three full size libraries. The main library is set in the center of the Academic Podium and contains study areas, classrooms and research centers. The second, called the Science Library, is located on the south side of the Campus Center and focuses on strictly scientific literature and media used in much of the university&#x27;s research. The third library is the Thomas E. Dewey Graduate Library, on the downtown campus. Together, the libraries provide more than two million volumes and rank among the top 100 research libraries in the U.S., according to the Association of Research Libraries. Users from around the world access services and collections through the libraries&#x27; online systems and Web site. The university&#x27;s libraries offer a program of information literacy with instruction that ranges from a focus on traditional bibliographic access to collaborative classes integrated into the curriculum.

===Rankings===
The &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; 2025 edition of &quot;Best Colleges&quot; ranked the university tied for 121st among national universities and tied for 61st among public universities.

In its 2022 rankings, Times Higher Education World University Rankings and The Wall Street Journal ranked the university 188th among national universities and 351st-400th among international universities.

The 2022 &quot;Forbes&quot; &quot;America&#x27;s Best Colleges&quot; ranking placed Albany at 281st overall among 500 universities, at the 56th percentile of schools that were ranked. This represents a drop of 94 spots from its 2021 ranking at 187. 

==Research==

===Cancer Research Center===
UAlbany&#x27;s Cancer Research Center (CRC) runs research that focuses on the underlying biology associated with tumor initiation and progression, and the development and evaluation of chemopreventive regimens and therapeutic approaches for common cancers. The center fosters the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in cancer biology. Located on the university East Campus in Rensselaer, N.Y., the center combines UAlbany research expertise in genomics and biomedical sciences with technology in a new facility.

The center opened in October 2005 with $45 million in support through New York State&#x27;s Gen*NY*Sis Program. Additional funds currently being raised from the private sector for the center&#x27;s Fund for Memory and Hope will be used for special equipment and needs of the research program. In September 2009 the Center recruited scientist Ramune Reliene from the University of California Los Angeles to its research team and faculty of the School of Public Health&#x27;s Department of Environmental Health Sciences. Reliene, who received her doctorate from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich in Switzerland, expands the scientific portfolio of the Center in the genetic and environmental causes of cancer.
===Atmospheric Sciences Research Center===
The Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC), based at UAlbany, is a center for research in the atmospheric sciences. Established on February 16, 1961, by the Board of Trustees of the State University of New York, its mission is to promote programs in basic and applied sciences, especially as they relate to the atmospheric environment. The center is connected to and shares faculty and resources with the university&#x27;s Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.

ASRC performs research to study the physical and chemical nature of the atmosphere and its implications to the environment. Research areas include boundary layers, solar radiation, radiative transfer, atmospheric chemistry, aerosol physics, air quality, solar energy, cloud physics, climate systems, and air quality monitoring. In addition the center has a large &quot;jungle research group&quot; exploring atmosphere and biosphere relationships in the Amazon rainforest, the Alaskan Tundra, the Canadian Boreal Forest, and the Eastern U.S.

The Climate System Sciences Section of ASRC, started in November 1989, conducts research to understand the Earth&#x27;s global and regional climate system and to assess and evaluate the effects of climatic change caused by both human activities and nature.

===The Center for Social and Demographic Analysis===
UAlbany&#x27;s Center for Social and Demographic Analysis (CSDA) was established in 1981 to provide a research infrastructure for scholarship in the social sciences at the University at Albany, State University of New York. CSDA has since become the nexus for further investments by university administration and state and federal agencies. Positioned by these developments, CSDA joined the roster of NICHD Population Centers in September 1997.

The center offers researchers access to computing facilities and statistical software, computing and statistical consulting, assistance with grant preparation and administration, and other related services. It collaborates with the Lewis Mumford Center—the university institute devoted to urban research—in efforts to disseminate data and fresh analyses of population trends revealed in the census and continuing census-related databases such as the Current Population Survey and the American Community Survey.

CSDA has 41 faculty associates drawn from 15 departments that span the array of academic disciplines at the university. Among major research initiatives sponsored by the center is the Urban China Research Network (funded by the Mellon Foundation), which brings together scholars and graduate students from around the world to study implications of urban change in China. New collaborative projects include initiatives on health disparities and the environmental impacts of metropolitan growth.

===The RNA Institute===
On June 4, 2010, the university unveiled a new $12.5 million biomedical research center, The RNA Institute, whose mission would be to form an alliance of genetic scientists and biomedical investigators from New York&#x27;s Capital Region to spur research and development into RNA and its implications for medicines, drug therapies and technologies, and curing disease. On November 5, 2010, UAlbany announced The RNA Institute had received a $5.37 million grant from the National Institutes of Health/National Center for Research Resources (NIH/NCRR) and $2 million in matching funds from the State of New York to fund the design, engineering and construction of of research facilities on par with those of modern pharmaceutical companies. On the same day, the institute announced the establishment of The RNA Institute MassSpec Center, dedicated to the development of mass spectrometry-based technologies for investigating the structure-function relationships of natural and synthetic RNA as tools for drug discovery.

==Study abroad==
The Office of International Education Study Abroad &amp; Exchanges sponsors 70 study abroad programs in 34 countries directly through UAlbany, but students can take advantage of more than 300 programs in over 80 countries throughout the SUNY system. Among the most popular international programs for UAlbany students have been Italy, Great Britain, Ireland, France and Spain. Students study abroad any time after their freshman year, up to and including their final semester senior year. Programs are available semester-long and for the full academic year, as well as in summer and during winter session.

==Environmental sustainability==
Its UAlbany Green Scene initiative is conducted through AT&amp;T grant-funded research. UAlbany researchers study coordination of traffic signals and transportation patterns, with the goals of minimizing car-engine idling times, forging new carpooling connections, and communicating more effectively alternative transportation options to the campus community.

Campus efforts were on display on September 22, 2009, with &quot;Destination Green,&quot; a day focusing on encouraging sustainable transportation. It highlighted the campus&#x27;s alternative transportation options, which include hybrid buses, global electric motorcars (GEMs), public bus systems, carpooling, and bike-and-ride sharing programs.

The campus designated April 2010 as UAlbany environmental sustainability month, with lectures, a regional student competition for the best renewable energy business plan, and campus greening projects.

UAlbany and its College of Engineering &amp; Applied Sciences house the only degree programs in the US that focus on both environmental and sustainable engineering.

==Student life==
===Student Association===
The University at Albany Student Association is a student run, non-profit, corporation which organizes and funds much of the student oriented activities on campus. The SA funds and recognizes 200 student groups, plans concerts, speaking engagements, and comedy shows. The SA impacts students in the classroom as well, through funding of general education courses. Modeled after the U.S. government, SA consists of three branches: executive, legislative (unicameral Student Association Senate), and judicial (Supreme Court).

The Student Association is funded directly by the undergraduate student body of the University at Albany, State University of New York.

The Student Association owns a wilderness retreat facility in the Adirondack Mountains called Camp Dippikill. 

===Greek life===
The University at Albany is currently home to 37 Greek-lettered organizations and six councils. According to &quot;Niche&quot;, the University at Albany is ranked the #2 Best Greek Life Colleges and the #2 Top Party School in New York State. The party scene at the University at Albany has become more restrained since the Albany Kegs N&#x27; Eggs 2011 Riot, where the Pine Hills neighborhood incurred substantial property damage.

===Safety===
In 2019, UAlbany was ranked &quot;the least safe college in New York.&quot; Among Upstate New York colleges, the university reported the highest number of campus rapes in the region.

===Student media===
The &quot;Albany Student Press&quot;, commonly known as &quot;The ASP&quot;, is an independent student-run newspaper. It began as the &quot;State College News&quot; and has been published continuously since 1916. The newspaper has a circulation of more than 10,000 and serves student body and the surrounding community.

==Athletics==

University at Albany&#x27;s intercollegiate athletics date back to the late 1890s, but its development was hampered for several decades by inadequate facilities, uncertain financial support, and the small number of male students in an institution designed to develop elementary school teachers. Tennis remained a constant from 1898 on and men&#x27;s basketball dates back to 1909, but attempts to field teams in football (1922), baseball (1896–1901), swimming, and ice hockey were aborted.

Expansion into men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports increased after World War II, and then expanded greatly in the 1960s (men&#x27;s sports of lacrosse, track and field, cross-country, and swimming moved from club to varsity status, and women&#x27;s tennis, softball, field hockey, basketball and swimming were introduced), a direct result of the introduction of the new Uptown campus and its expanded athletic facilities. A nickname change also occurred, the Pedagogues becoming the Great Danes—making UAlbany the only American college or university with that mascot. The school&#x27;s colors are purple and gold.

After the 1972 NCAA restructuring, UAlbany competed in Division III athletics until the 1995–96 school year, when it moved to the Division II level as part of a transition to Division I competition. That process was completed in the fall of 1999; UAlbany now has 19 varsity sports (8 men, 11 women) competing at the Division I level. All athletic programs are run by the university&#x27;s Department of Athletics and Recreation.

Other than the sport of football, the school&#x27;s teams have been members of the America East Conference since 2001. Football participates in the Football Championship Subdivision level (formerly Division I-AA). The Danes were an associate member of the Northeast Conference, winning championships in that league in 2002, 2007, 2008, 2011 and 2012. Beginning with the 2013 season, the Danes moved their football program to the Colonial Athletic Association.

On February 15, 2012, university president George Philip announced that a new $24 million athletic and recreational complex would be completed in three phases, consisting of a new synthetic turf field for students (finished in Fall 2012), a combined new football and soccer facility (completed in Fall 2013), and a refurbished track and field venue (finished in Spring 2014). President Philip also announced $6 million fundraising campaign to support the project.

The coach of the UAlbany men&#x27;s basketball team Dwayne Killing was indicted on January 23, 2023, for 4th degree assault on a player in 2021. The incident took place in the locker room of Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond, Ky., where UAlbany was playing in a tournament. This the second legal action relating to the incident. The player involved filed a lawsuit against Killings, athletic director Mark Benson and the school alleging that Killings &quot;violently and viciously grabbed him, threw him up against a locker and struck him in the face, drawing blood.&quot; The suit also alleges that Benson and UAlbany instead of protecting a student as a victim of the assault &quot;showed preference to the assaulter because of his race,&quot; violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.

==Notable alumni and faculty==
The university has been home to scholars, scientists, and writers, including 2017 Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry Joachim Frank; 2018 Wolf Prize co-recipient Omar Yaghi, a University of California, Berkeley chemist; Herman Aguinis, a George Washington University School of Business professor and president of the Academy of Management; Alanna Schepartz, a Yale University chemist and a National Academy of Arts and Sciences inductee; Nobel Prize laureate Toni Morrison; Pulitzer Prize winner William Kennedy; gay rights pioneer Harvey Milk; Broadway actress and three-time Tony Award nominee Carolee Carmello; Turing Award winner Richard E. Stearns; Harvard sociologist Robert J. Sampson and Scott Waldman (biochemist, MD) Samuel M.V. Hamilton Professor of Medicine at Sidney Kimmel Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University.

<text>War All the Time is the third studio album by American rock band Thursday. Following the release of their second album &quot;Full Collapse&quot; (2001), the group had a series of negative experiences with their label Victory Records regarding promotion. While this was happening, the group was contacted by major labels, and in May 2002, signed to Island Records. The signing was made official later in the year when an exit agreement was made with Victory Records. In November, the group started writing new material. In January 2003, they began recording their next album with Sal Villanueva at Big Blue Meenie Recording Studios in Jersey City, New Jersey. Sessions lasted six months, aside from a break in April to play shows. In late April, &quot;For the Workforce, Drowning&quot; was released as a single, followed by &quot;Signals Over the Air&quot; in August.

&quot;War All the Time&quot; was released through Island Records on September 16. Selling 74,000 copies in the first week, the album charted at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In addition, it charted within the top 75 in the UK. Following this, keyboardist Andrew Everding, who had performed on a few songs on the album, became a member of the group. The group then went on a short US tour, before embarking on a UK tour. Between October and December, the group went on another US tour, toured with Deftones, and filmed a video for &quot;War All the Time&quot;. In early 2004, the group toured Japan, Australia and New Zealand, before supporting AFI in North America in February and March. In April, the band went on another tour and appeared on Warped Tour.

==Background==
In 2001, Thursday signed to independent label Victory Records. After signing, the band received warnings from their friends that they would find themselves in &quot;a situation that we would regret.&quot; The group was unsure what they meant, but thought things would turn out fine due to their contract with the label. They initially thought that part of the contract meant they could sign with a different label if they chose to. However, they realized the deal had in fact stated they could only leave Victory if it was to join a major label, which they thought was &quot;a far-fetched idea to say the least.&quot; Later in the year, they released their second album &quot;Full Collapse&quot; through the label, eventually reaching number 178 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Before appearing on Warped Tour, the group visited Victory&#x27;s offices and learned about Thursday-branded whoopee cushions that the label was planning to sell at the tour. Vocalist Geoff Rickly discussed this matter with Victory founder Tony Brummel, and according to the band, responded that Victory &quot;was a big company and that they didn&#x27;t have time to run everything by the band.&quot; The band were perplexed when the label suggested releasing singles and making music videos, as they felt hardcore bands did not need to do singles and believed they would not appear on radio.

On a number of occasions, the group attempted to have better communication with the label in regards to promotion. On one occasion, Brummel informed them they were not living up to his expectations. Sometime afterwards, the group was touring with Saves the Day. Around this time, Thursday had started writing material for their next album; guitarist Tom Keeley said they had two older songs that were almost close to completion before they had started promoting &quot;Full Collapse&quot;. Also during this period, Brummel became more positive in his interactions, frequently calling the band &quot;just to say hello, or to ask how record sales at shows were going.&quot; The group was disappointed that his positivity &quot;wasn&#x27;t there from the beginning. ... Instead of Tony&#x27;s relationship with us being based on a love for music, it was based entirely on numbers.&quot; While all the interactions with the label were occurring, the group was being contacted by major labels. The group, who &quot;didn&#x27;t understand [anything] about major labels&quot;, pondered about other independent labels they would join. However, due to their contract they wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to move to another independent label. Throughout 2001, people from major label Island Records had been to the band&#x27;s shows since they became a full-time touring act. Soon after, the label expressed interest in signing the band. In February 2002, keyboardist Andrew Everding joined the band.

In late May 2002, the group announced they had signed to Island Records, following a bidding war between other major labels. Victory tried to get the band to sign to a different major label in a deal that would have enabled Victory to serve as a sub-label for them. Up to this point, &quot;Full Collapse&quot; had sold 111,000 copies. On September 9, the group&#x27;s signing to Island Records was made official following negotiations of an exit agreement with Victory Records. The agreement required parent company Island/Def Jam to buy out Victory&#x27;s contract claim for the group&#x27;s next two albums. Rickly said as a result of the deal, Victory Records received $1,200,000, which meant the band would be &quot;[paying off] that bill for as long as we were on the new label.&quot; In addition, their next two albums were required to feature the Victory logo. With expectation building for their follow-up album, Rickly wanted their next album to be &quot;really aggressive and progressive ... and have all these boundary pushing ideas&quot;. In September and October, the group went on the Plea for Peace Tour, and were planning to work on their next album following its conclusion. They said they had accumulated a lot of ideas but were unable to work on them due to touring. In mid-November, the group continued writing new material; over the course of the next two months, they wrote the majority of what would become the album. Up to now, the members had made notes on their laptops and made Pro Tools set-ups in the back of their touring buses to record ideas they had accumulated. While the band did have writer&#x27;s block, they worked through it as they were short on time.

==Production==
In January 2003, &quot;Kludge&quot; reported that Thursday were in the process of recording their next album, which was expected for release in summer or fall. Recording took place at Big Blue Meenie Recording Studios in Jersey City, New Jersey and lasted six months. Though they had thought about working with other producers, they decided to work with &quot;Full Collapse&quot; producer Sal Villanueva again. Joe Pedulla, Arun Venkatesh, Erin Farley and Villanueva engineered the sessions with assistance from Lee Zappas and Mike LaPierre. With &quot;Full Collapse&quot;, the band members&#x27; home lives felt separate from the recording, according to Rickly. However, for &quot;War All the Time&quot;, &quot;Life resumed for each of us ... and all the stresses of life came in.&quot; He mentioned that some of the members got married, and family members had died. He added, &quot;I feel like all the stress is reflected in the way the album sounds.&quot;

Rickly thought they were &quot;doing things that were kind of excessive&quot;, mentioning that they recorded four different recordings of every track &quot;just to see which one turned out the best.&quot; While this was occurring, the group was writing new material. Rickly said three of these new songs would not have been tracked had they not had the time, specifically mentioning &quot;Division St.&quot; and &quot;Signals Over the Air&quot;. Villanueva noticed the group getting burned out and took them to a farmhouse studio, which was Longview Farm Studios in North Brookfield, Massachusetts. Rickly said it was located in the &quot;woods, basically it’s a log cabin with a fireplace, it’s just really beautiful.&quot; The studio had a grand piano on which the group fleshed out a piano part that Everding had previously written. Rickly said Everding repeatedly played the part and recorded it. The group took a break from recording to play a few shows in late April.

While working on lyrics for the final three songs, he was unable to write any words and became unhappy with the songs. He subsequently suffered from writer&#x27;s block for a month. Rickly said that after recording was completed, the rest of the band wrote three more songs, which they &quot;liked even better&quot;. The label gave the band money to record the new tracks; sessions continued into May 2003. The recordings were mixed by Rumblefish with assistance from Coady Brown, and then mastered by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering in Portland Maine. Everding played keyboards on &quot;Division St.&quot;, &quot;Marches and Maneuvers&quot;, &quot;Asleep in the Chapel&quot;, &quot;This Song Brought to You by a Falling Bomb&quot;, &quot;Steps Ascending&quot;, &quot;M. Shepard&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow I&#x27;ll Be You&quot;. Tim Gilles played keyboards on &quot;Between Rupture and Rapture&quot; and &quot;Signals Over the Air&quot;. Gretta Cohn of Cursive and Jonah Matranga of Onelinedrawing appeared on &quot;Steps Ascending&quot;, providing cello and vocals respectively. Arun Venkatesh performed programming on &quot;M. Shepard&quot;. Keri Levens, Marc Meltser and Dave Ciancio provided vocals on &quot;War All the Time&quot;.

==Composition==
===Overview===
All of the music was written by Thursday except for &quot;This Song Brought to You by a Falling Bomb&quot;, which was co-written between Everding and the band. All of the lyrics were written by Geoff Rickly. The material on &quot;Full Collapse&quot; was written over a two-year period, while for &quot;War All the Time&quot;, the tracks were done in two months. During this time period, they spent every day working on songs from 11AM to 8PM. Guitarist Steve Pedulla said they expanded further on ideas from &quot;Full Collapse&quot;, in addition to channelling the music they were listening to. He explained that what someone listens to can influence their playing, and despite the group listening to &quot;a lot of mellower stuff&quot;, the music came out &quot;a lot heavier&quot;. While on tour, they listened to Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Mogwai. Prior to the album, the group was asked if it would sound closer to &quot;Jet Black New Year&quot;, a track Pedulla called &quot;the heaviest song we wrote&quot;. Pedulla and Keeley initially denied it; the former stated that the song was a direction they &quot;went for a little while, and we are going somewhere else now.&quot; Keeley added that it &quot;definitely runs thematically&quot; throughout &quot;War All the Time&quot;.

Speaking of the title, Rickly said: &quot;I think a title like &quot;War All the Time&quot; for a record about love seems to demonstrate what our band is about — that balance between violence and grace.&quot; He added that he had been &quot;afraid to talk about the idea of romantic love in songs because I feel like it&#x27;s such a cliché&quot;. Rickly got the notion of tackling romance from writer Charles Bukowski, who wrote a poem where the album took its title from. He said it soon became a substantial part of his life, and he &quot;felt like I was stifling myself by not writing about it.&quot; Discussing the lack of hooks on the album, Rickly said &quot;When you write music, you hear what you&#x27;ve done, and you immediately find what you&#x27;re missing with what you did.&quot; He added, &quot;If this were a really hooky record, I&#x27;d say it weren&#x27;t complex enough.&quot; Musically, the album&#x27;s sound has been classified as post-hardcore and emo.

===Songs===
Rickly compared &quot;For the Workforce, Drowning&quot; to a &quot;super heavy&quot; Fugazi. &quot;Division St.&quot; describes an evening in which Rickly visited a group of his friends. Upon learning they were using heavy drugs, he left and was mugged and stabbed in the leg. When he went to visit a girl he liked for help, he found out she was with someone else. He said the track was about how &quot;it can sometimes seem like your whole world is coming apart and you find out that everything you thought you knew is not how you thought it was.&quot; The music for the song was influenced by Sigur Rós. When Rickly showed the song to the rest of the group, they were only partially interested in it. After they saw Sigur Rós at a concert, they &quot;decided to bring in some of their noisy qualities into our music&quot;, according to Rickly. Rickly said &quot;Signals Over the Air&quot; was about &quot;being scared of sexuality&quot;, which he has &quot;always kind of had issues with&quot; to the point &quot;where it always seemed very predatory to me&quot;. &quot;Marches and Maneuvers&quot; talks about Rickly and his ex-girlfriend&#x27;s opinions on abortion and children. He said it &quot;addresses living together and having all those pressures, and then eventually blaming each other for things that happen&quot;. Discussing &quot;This Song Brought to You by a Falling Bomb&quot;, Rickly said he had &quot;this feeling of wanting to escape the outside world and escape the news.&quot; He added that, &quot;On the news every day there would be all these things about the war going on and that terrified me ... It gave an impulse for me to want to block it out.&quot; It was intended to solely be an instrumental interlude; however, Rickly &quot;kept hearing things&quot;, and asked Everding if it was alright to sing over it.

Referring to the title-track, Rickly said they had the phrase &quot;War All the Time&quot; as the album title first before it appeared in the song. He said that it wasn&#x27;t the first title they had in mind, but soon realized that the song &quot;really is the center of the record.&quot; Rickly said the song was about his upbringing in New Jersey. He added that it was &quot;sort of like love all the time, and the price of trying to have love all the time.&quot; The song talks about three important occasions in Rickly&#x27;s life, which he attempted to model it after &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999). The first part details moving to a town where one of his friends&#x27; brothers fell off a cliffside, and some of his friends subsequently committed suicide. The second part discusses Rickly discovering music, and the third part talks about love and how that can affect a person&#x27;s sense of self and confidence. The rhythm and melody of the song came out during a soundcheck. Keeley was playing a part repeatedly and drummer Tucker Rule joined playing a variety of beats. Pedulla then began playing along, playing what Rickly called &quot;these beautiful, glistening guitar parts&quot;. Rickly said &quot;M. Shepard&quot; was &quot;not directly&quot; about Matthew Shepard, but also about his friend who was afraid to come out and &quot;how complex sexuality is&quot;. &quot;Tomorrow I&#x27;ll Be You&quot; was originally going to be the opening track as the group adored the song. However, they soon realized that it &quot;didn&#x27;t seem right to have this redeeming, beautiful&quot; track began an album that had a &quot;lot of ugliness and darkness in it.&quot;
It initially started out as an ending to &quot;Jet Black New Year&quot;, as it was a &quot;redemption for that song in a lot of ways.&quot;

==Release==

Keeley said that upon showing their label the album, he was unsure how they would react to it. He said that &quot;for the most part it was a very positive&quot; reaction. On March 25, 2003, &quot;War All the Time&quot; was announced for release in August. On April 28, &quot;For the Workforce, Drowning&quot; was released as a single; around this, the band performed at Skate and Surf Fest. In June and July, the group toured the US alongside Rival Schools, This Day Forward, Murder by Death and Every Time I Die. In addition, they performed at the Field Day and Hellfest festivals. &quot;For the Workforce, Drowning&quot; was released on a split 7-inch vinyl record with &quot;Under a Killing Moon&quot; by Thrice on July 1. Following this, the band took a two-week break, their first since November 2002, and then spent the next four weeks rehearsing. &quot;Signals Over the Air&quot; was released to radio on August 12. Having the song as a single, Rickly said he &quot;like[d] the idea of a song about the exploitation of sexuality being on major media outlets like radio and television.&quot; The music video for the track, released on August 28, was directed by Joakim Åhlund. Initially announced for release on August 19, the album&#x27;s release was delayed so that the group could record new material. &quot;War All the Time&quot; was eventually released on September 16 through Island Records. It was previously made available for streaming nine days prior to release. The UK version of the album was released through Mercury Records. The Japanese version included a cover of Sigur Rós&#x27; &quot;Ný batterí&quot; (2000) as a bonus track. Bassist Tim Payne said they were listening to that band&#x27;s &quot;Ágætis byrjun&quot; (1999) album when he suggested Thursday should cover one of their songs.

Later in September, the group went on a brief tour of North America with Year of the Rabbit and Death by Stereo. In October, the group went on a UK tour with Coheed and Cambria and Further Seems Forever. In October and November, the group went on a tour of North America with Thrice and Coheed and Cambria. On October 31, the band performed on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. Following this, the group toured with Deftones until early December. On December 15, a music video was filmed for &quot;War All the Time&quot; in New Jersey with director Marc Klasfeld. Jon Wiederhorn of MTV said the video uses &quot;war-coverage techniques to create an atmosphere of extreme urgency&quot; and &quot;infrared and green night-vision filters to imitate war footage&quot;. Some of the scenes in the video were styled after films by Godfrey Reggio: &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot; (1983), &quot;Powaqqatsi&quot; (1988), and &quot;Naqoyqatsi&quot; (2002). In January 2004, the group went on a tour of Japan, followed by appearances at Big Day Out in New Zealand and Australia. Following this, the group supported AFI on their North American tour in February and March, and played a handful of shows with the Bronx, Head Automatica, and Piebald. A tour with Poison the Well, Engine Down, and Spitalfield started in April, which lead into an appearance on the main stage at the Warped Tour. A music video was released for &quot;For the Workforce, Drowning&quot; on June 18, 2004, directed by Pedulla and filmed on the tour with Poison the Well. They supported the Cure on their US tour in July and August 2004, and appeared at Strhessfest.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Critics gave the album a varied response. AllMusic reviewer Johnny Loftus wrote that the record &quot;rocks on the dynamics between singing and screaming, between rage unleashed and thoughts cast inward.&quot; He also said that in spite of the album&#x27;s &quot;righteous gospel, startling dynamic shifts, and hurtling minor-chord choruses&quot;, it unavoidably starts to &quot;resemble one long, 40-minute song.&quot; &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; Amy Sciarretto compared the band to Bruce Springsteen in that they use &quot;vivid detail and gruff emotion to paint pictures that aren&#x27;t beautiful&quot;. She mentioned that the tracks were &quot;more like emotional earthquakes than songs, making an album for today&#x27;s youth looking to art for salvation and survival.&quot; &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; writer James Parrish said the album, when compared to &quot;Full Collapse&quot;, &quot;falls flat on its face through trying too hard.&quot; He added that the melodies were &quot;haphazard and overtly awkward and the instrumentation, while competent and intricate, is nothing you couldn&#x27;t hear&quot; before on &quot;Full Collapse&quot;.

Contactmusic.com reviewer Mark Danson wrote &quot;there&#x27;s just nothing special here, either in the playing, writing or the production.&quot; He also said the group&#x27;s &quot;only saving grace&quot; was &quot;their vocalist &#x27;sounds-a-bit-like-the-guy-from-The-Cure&#x27;.&quot; In a review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Greg Kot called the album &quot;[s]ensitive as a teardrop, but hitting with the impact of a two-by-four across the jaw&quot;, adding that it gave &quot;good elegy with its mix of emo-punk sincerity and metal-tinged-roar.&quot; Stuart Green of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; said the album &quot;suffer[s] the same terminal fate&quot; as the group&#x27;s contemporaries – &quot;one of tedious sameness ... [happy to] rehash the stuff they&#x27;ve done in the past.&quot; IGN&#x27;s Jesse Lord said it was a &quot;really good CD that verges on being great&quot;, however, &quot;there are simply too many songs that sound alike.&quot; He noted that while the intros on the majority of the songs reveal &quot;the diversity of the band&quot;, they then revert to &quot;the screaming and the overdriven guitars.&quot; &quot;Ink19&quot; reviewer Daniel L. Mitchell gave a very positive review of the album, praising the writing (especially &quot;Division St.&quot;, &quot;For The Workforce, Drowning&quot; and &quot;M. Shepard&quot;) and production on the record. Mitchell also appreciated &quot;This Song Brought to You by a Falling Bomb&quot;, despite that in his opinion, it &quot;should, in theory, suck&quot;. He concluded, &quot;War All The Time is &quot;emo&quot; done correctly, and while others will try to copy it, they will undoubtedly fail.&quot;

&quot;Kludge&quot; magazine reflected positively on &quot;War All the Time&quot;, with reviewer Adam Newman stating &quot;The CD is truly commanding as its abrupt and urgent conclusions are as nicely inserted as the dramatic ups and downs of the chorus.&quot; Newman chose &quot;Division St.&quot; and &quot;Signals Over the Air&quot; as highlights from the album. &quot;Melodic&quot; writer Kaj Roth said the group lacked &quot;the same heavyweight production&quot; as contemporary act From Autumn to Ashes, and that the songs felt like &quot;an enduro to get through&quot;. Punknews.org founder Aubin Paul wrote that a &quot;leap in songwriting prowess is apparent&quot; in a number of tracks where &quot;things are more toned down, but the dynamic range is clearly larger.&quot; Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a &quot;dud&quot;. Music journalist Christian Hoard wrote that, in a review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the album &quot;brims over with all the jagged guitars and bad thoughts a bunch of suburban New Jersey kids can muster.&quot; He also said that the group created an album that was &quot;desperate and intense enough to resonate outside their corner of the underground.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; Andrew Beaujon said Rickly &quot;sings like Ben Folds after a particularly messy breakup&quot;, and manages to fill the beginning &quot;moment [of each song] with starved romanticism.&quot; Beaujon mentioned that the record&#x27;s &quot;artier tracks ... will probably enervate longtime fans who worry that major-label cash is clouding their heroes’ worldview.&quot;

===Commercial performance and legacy===
The album sold over 74,000 copies, giving the band their best sales week. It charted at number seven on the Billboard 200 in the process. In the UK, it charted at number 62. By April 2004, the album had sold 259,000 copies and 355,000 copies by mid-2006. As of April 2007, it had sold 364,000 copies. &quot;Signals Over the Air&quot; charted at number 30 on the Alternative Songs chart in the US, and at number 62 in the UK. &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; included it on their top albums of 2003 list, while &quot;Exclaim!&quot; ranked it at number two on their Best Punk Album of the year list behind &quot;Scandinavian Leather&quot; by Turbonegro.

In a retrospective review for Sputnikmusic in 2008, staff member Davey Boy said it was &quot;rather inconsistent, but gets by on its highlights and its ability to grow on the listener over time&quot; and in &quot;an attempt at crossover appeal, this release is only partially successful.&quot; In 2014, Rickly was asked to rank the band&#x27;s albums and discuss his thoughts on them. He listed &quot;War All the Time&quot; at number four, saying that he hated the album upon release. He then added, &quot;In retrospect I think that&#x27;s a mistake. I think it’s a really cool record&quot;. They performed the album in its entirety in October 2009, while in the midst of promoting their fifth studio album, &quot;Common Existence&quot;. From April 2018 to December 2019, the group performed a run of two-night shows where they played &quot;Full Collapse&quot; on the first night, and &quot;War All the Time&quot; on the other, in their entirety.

<text>3C 279 (also known as 4C–05.55, NRAO 413, and PKS 1253–05) is an optically violent variable quasar (OVV), which is known in the astronomical community for its variations in the visible, radio and X-ray bands. The quasar was observed to have undergone a period of extreme activity from 1987 until 1991. The Rosemary Hill Observatory (RHO) started observing 3C 279 in 1971, the object was further observed by the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory in 1991, when it was unexpectedly discovered to be one of the brightest gamma ray objects in the sky. It is also one of the brightest and most variable sources in the gamma ray sky monitored by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. It was used as a calibrator source for Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87* that resulted in the first image of a black hole.
==Observations==
* The apparent superluminal motion was detected during observations first made in 1973 in a jet of material departing from the quasar, though it should be understood that this effect is an optical illusion caused by naive estimations of the speed, and no truly superluminal motion is occurring.
* 16 June 2015, the 3C 279 had a large gamma-ray outburst, believed to be caused by the injection of high-speed electrons in the central, high-density region.
* Further observations with the Event Horizon Telescope during April 2017 provided a high level of detail to the radio jet, with a resolution as small as 20 micro-arcseconds. They indicated a bent or rotating jet shaped by shock waves.

<text>The Universal Wrestling Federation was a 1986 re-branding of wrestler-turned-owner Bill Watts&#x27; Mid-South Wrestling promotion. Watts&#x27; goal was to elevate his promotion from a relatively smaller, regional-level business, to a national-level rival of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as WWE). However, Watts&#x27; business strategy quickly swung from &quot;overnight&quot; success to catastrophic failure, resulting in the 1987 sale of the UWF to another rival: Jim Crockett Promotions (owner of Mid-Atlantic Wrestling, Georgia Championship Wrestling, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)&#x27;s most important championships, and the predecessor of World Championship Wrestling). The promotion began as an NWA territory, NWA Tri-State, founded by Leroy McGuirk in the 1950s. Tri-State/Mid-South/UWF promoted in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi until 1987.

Because Watts did not register the &quot;Universal Wrestling Federation&quot; name with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, businessman Herb Abrams was able to use it to launch an unrelated wrestling promotion of the same name in 1990.

==History==

===NWA Tri-State (1950s–1979)===
A former territory wrestler who was blinded in a 1950 auto accident, Leroy McGuirk eventually took over promoting a wrestling circuit covering Oklahoma, Louisiana and Mississippi. Until 1973, &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bill Watts had been one of Tri-State&#x27;s most popular wrestlers. After leaving Tri-State for Eddie Graham&#x27;s Championship Wrestling from Florida, Watts returned to Tri-State in 1975. NWA Tri-State fought a two-year promotional war against International Championship Wrestling that included the &quot;outlaw&quot; promotion filing an antitrust lawsuit against McGuirk and Watts.

===Mid-South Wrestling (1979–1986)===
In 1979, Bill Watts acquired the Tri-State Wrestling territory from Leroy McGuirk, and re-branded it Mid-South Wrestling (MSW; officially, the Mid-South Wrestling Association). One of Watts&#x27; first acts as owner was to withdraw the company from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). However, MSW would remain loosely aligned with the NWA, continuing to have the NWA World Heavyweight Champion defend the title on MSW shows, which spiked live event sales. (During the &quot;territory&quot; system [1940s-1980s], the NWA World Heavyweight Champion would travel to each NWA-affiliated territory to defend the title against its top-drawing local star.) MSW then added Arkansas to its circuit. In 1982, MSW expanded to Oklahoma when McGuirk closed his personal, Oklahoma-based promotion. McGuirk also formed an alliance with Houston promoter Paul Boesch to feature Mid-South talent on shows at the Sam Houston Coliseum (one of the most famous arenas in professional wrestling), and other parts of southeastern Texas. Mid-South used Shreveport, Louisiana as the base for its television tapings, which were first housed in the studios of KTBS-TV until they were moved around 1982 to the Irish McNeel Sports for Boys club, located on the Louisiana State Fairgrounds.

Instead of the cartoon-ish characters and interviews common to the Hulkamania-era WWF, Mid-South Wrestling&#x27;s content focused on: energetic matches performed before raucous and packed crowds; characters whose personas blurred the line between good and evil; an intensely physical, athletic wrestling style; and an episodic TV show format. The promotion ran shows in a mix of small venues and gigantic arenas. In 1980, a card pitting a &quot;blinded&quot; Junkyard Dog against Freebird Michael Hayes in the main event drew nearly 30,000 fans for a show presented by a promotion less than one year old. In 1984, Watts came out of retirement to team with a masked Junkyard Dog (under the name Stagger Lee) to face the Midnight Express to cap an angle in which the Express and manager Jim Cornette beat Watts on TV. Its undercard featured a showdown between Magnum T.A. and Mr. Wrestling II. The 1984 show drew 22,000 fans—an unimaginably large crowd for a regional territory show.

In the mid-1980s, MSW began to expand nationally. In 1985, longtime wrestling fan Ted Turner invited Watts to air MSW&#x27;s weekly TV show on Turner&#x27;s SuperStation TBS network. Turner wanted an alternative to the World Wrestling Federation show airing in the coveted 2-hour, Saturday-evening timeslot, which the WWF had acquired when it bought out the majority ownership of Georgia Championship Wrestling. (see: Black Saturday) Turner was angered by the WWF show because McMahon had promised him it would feature matches and promos taped in TBS&#x27; Atlanta studios (as Georgia Championship Wrestling had done for years). But instead of fresh, locally-produced content, the WWF&#x27;s TBS show only presented clips and highlights from &quot;other&quot; WWF TV shows – some, depending on TV market, airing at the same time the TBS show did. (Eventually, the WWF would shoot local, in-studio matches, but only infrequently, and they were usually predictable squash matches.) MSW quickly became TBS&#x27; highest-rated show, so Watts positioned MSW to take over once Turner could force the WWF off his network. Watts&#x27; luck ran out, however, when former Georgia Championship Wrestling co-owner Jim Barnett helped broker a deal enabling North Carolina–based Jim Crockett Promotions&#x27; (led by Jim Crockett, Jr.) to buy the Saturday timeslot from McMahon, and become TBS&#x27; sole pro wrestling show. Watts made one more attempt at going national the following year. As part of that plan, Watts replaced Mid-South Wrestling&#x27;s parochial brandname with a more corporate, ambitious (and WWF-like) one: the Universal Wrestling Federation.

===Universal Wrestling Federation (1986–1987)===
In March 1986, MSW &quot;went national&quot; (the goal of the most ambitious regional promotions of this era), re-launching as the Universal Wrestling Federation, and securing a syndication deal airing their two one-hour, weekly TV programs (the lesser show, &quot;Power Pro Wrestling&quot; debuted in 1984) in major markets across the United States. The TV tapings were also taken out of Shreveport and moved on location at various live shows throughout the Mid-South/UWF territory. New wrestlers, mostly from World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW), joined the company, as did former WCCW co-promoter Ken Mantell. Despite the UWF&#x27;s strong early ratings and critical praise, it could not compete nationally with Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) and the WWF, as both had stronger TV distribution and larger live event, pay-per-view (and, in the WWF&#x27;s case, merchandise licensing) revenue streams. The UWF was further hurt when the oil-based economy of its richest local market—Oklahoma—fell into a severe recession in late 1986. This left the blue collar core of the UWF&#x27;s fanbase with far less disposable income to spend on things like attending wrestling shows. 

Watts sold the UWF to JCP on April 9, 1987, and many of the UWF&#x27;s top stars were either retained by JCP, or immediately left for the WWF or WCCW. Unlike the other NWA-affiliated promotions JCP had bought out in the mid-1980s, the UWF did not immediately end; JCP kept its brand—and its three championships—alive in TV storylines until December 1987, when JCP&#x27;s NWA-affiliated characters defeated all of the UWF characters in a series of &quot;title vs. title&quot; unification matches, among others. Only a few UWF wrestlers were well-received by JCP&#x27;s fanbase; they included: the Fabulous Freebirds, Shane Douglas, Rick Steiner, Eddie Gilbert, and UWF centerpiece &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams. Most UWF imports were gone from JCP&#x27;s roster within a year; however, one wrestler would go from UWF midcarder/tag team act, to breakout star in JCP, and the wrestling industry as a whole: Sting. Sting&#x27;s UWF tag team (as The Blade Runners) partner would later become a WWF wrestling legend, too: The Ultimate Warrior.

In October 1988, JCP, one of the biggest and late stage casualties of the &quot;going national&quot; war with the WWF, sold its collection of territories and titles to Ted Turner&#x27;s TBS. Turner re-branded JCP &quot;World Championship Wrestling,&quot; naming the new company after its TBS TV show. Ironically, &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bill Watts ended up running the same business that had swallowed his own: In spring of 1992, WCW hired Watts as its latest Executive Vice President; he held the role less than a year.

World Wrestling Entertainment acquired most of the Mid-South/UWF video archive, absorbing it into its WWE Libraries collection in 2012—with a notable exception: Mid-South/UWF matches taped for &quot;Houston Wrestling&quot; which aired on KHTV in Houston. Those rights are held by the estate of Paul Boesch, who was the Houston territory&#x27;s promoter. Select episodes of Mid-South are available for viewing on the WWE Network and on the NBCUniversal-owned Peacock streaming service in the United States.

==Storylines==
The &quot;Battle of New Orleans&quot; was a long-playing brawl between Eddie Gilbert, Terry Taylor, Chris Adams and Sting, which began in the ring and spilled out into the concession area. Beer kegs, chairs, tables, popcorn machine and anything the four wrestlers could get their hands on were used in the brawl which lasted nearly 15 minutes. Sting and Gilbert fought outside the ring, when Rick Steiner came in and piledrived Shane Douglas. With Taylor on top, referee Randy Anderson made the pinfall. Later, Adams came out and told Anderson what had happened, which prompted Gilbert and Taylor to gang-up on Adams. Sting came in to even the sides, and that resulted in an all-out brawl outside the ring. Gilbert was the mastermind of this famous angle and received huge praise from fellow promoters and wrestlers.

Adams was engaged in a storyline involving Iceman King Parsons and Taylor, which evolved out of the UWF Tag Team Championship tournament in February 1987. Originally, Adams and Iceman were one of the eight teams participating, and Taylor was teamed with Sam Houston. In a semi-finals match, Adams and Iceman wrestled against &quot;Dr Death&quot; Steve Williams and Ted DiBiase until Skandor Akbar&#x27;s Devastation Inc. charged the ring to attack Williams and DiBiase. The match ended when Williams and DiBiase were counted out, and Adams and Parsons won the match. Adams, who was helping Williams and DiBiase fight off Akbar and his army, wanted the match to continue, but Parsons wanted the win. After a lengthy argument, Adams and Parsons split, and Chris chose Savannah Jack as his new tag team partner. Iceman sucker-punched Savannah during a match and injured him, thus Adams had to choose another tag partner. He chose Terry Taylor, whose team lost a semi-final match to Rick Steiner and Sting. Taylor and Adams eventually won the UWF tag team titles, and held the belts for two months.

Meanwhile, Adams and Parsons engaged in a lengthy feud, which lasted for more than a decade (the two had feuded earlier in WCCW when Adams was the heel and Parsons was the babyface), with Parsons frequently referring to Adams as &quot;Jailbird,&quot; a reference to Adams serving jail time in 1986 on an assault conviction. Taylor and Adams, who dominated the UWF tag team scene, lost a match to Steiner and Sting when Taylor kicked Adams foot off the rope as he was being pinned by Sting. A face-vs-face bout between Adams and Taylor marked Taylor&#x27;s heel turn as he piledrived Adams on the floor. The Taylor-Adams war proved to be one of the most violent feuds in the UWF, with an equal intensity to the feud Adams had with the Von Erichs in World Class. The feud did have a short interruption when Taylor was injured in an automobile accident, but picked up again by the summer and carried over to World Class by 1988. Taylor and Adams promoted a famous angle in August which involved a press conference, where Taylor spoke about his situation with Adams and then left. Chris later took questions, which prompted Taylor to attack Adams with a chair. The following week, Adams conducted an interview vowing revenge against both Taylor and Eddie Gilbert.

Other famous UWF angles included promoter Bill Watts being attacked and having the flag of the Soviet Union draped on him by Eddie Gilbert, Missy Hyatt cold-cocking John Tatum after joining forces with Gilbert, Skandor Akbar throwing a fireball at Hacksaw Jim Duggan (&quot;blinding&quot; him temporarily), and the Freebirds breaking Steve Williams&#x27; arm. Williams recruited Oklahoma Sooners (and future Dallas Cowboys head coach) Barry Switzer into training and getting back into the ring. It paid off on July 11, 1987, when Dr. Death defeated Big Bubba Rogers (Ray Traylor) to win the UWF Heavyweight Championship. The Freebirds became faces around that time, as they began feuding with Skandor Akbar&#x27;s army as well as The Angel of Death.

A prelim wrestler, Mike Boyette, wrestled in the UWF and is believed to be one of the very few wrestlers to never win a match. Video editors for the show even put together a music video of his various losses in the ring, set to the Little River Band song &quot;Lonesome Loser&quot;. &quot;Gorgeous&quot; Gary Young also competed in the UWF, claiming that he was a rookie. He actually had five years experience under his belt. Young&#x27;s claims prompted Jim Ross to begin referring to him as a &quot;five-time rookie of the year.&quot;

As the UWF&#x27;s merge with &quot;the NWA&quot; was taking place, Terry Taylor, who held the UWF Television Championship, began an angle with the NWA World Television Champion, Nikita Koloff. Taylor stole the NWA TV title belt during an NWA show, but Koloff (with help from Dusty Rhodes) reclaimed it before their official in-ring encounter. They met at Starrcade 1987, and Nikita unified the two titles as the final leg of the NWA-UWF merger was finished. Williams would successfully defend the UWF Heavyweight Title on the same show versus Barry Windham. Williams immediately left to do a series of lucrative performances in Japan; the title was retired while he was in Asia.

Sting, Rick Steiner, Eddie Gilbert, Missy Hyatt, announcer Jim Ross, Brad Armstrong and the aforementioned Taylor became permanent NWA roster members, among others. The Freebirds, Savannah Jack, Iceman King Parsons, matchmaker Frank Dusek, and promoter Ken Mantell joined the new Wild West Wrestling promotion, which later merged with World Class Championship Wrestling. &quot;Gentleman&quot; Chris Adams, who initially stayed with Jim Crockett Promotions post-UWF, left due to a money dispute and returned to World Class in November 1987. DiBiase, Big Bubba Rogers, One Man Gang, and Sam Houston joined the WWF, joining fellow UWF alumnus &quot;Hacksaw Jim Duggan&quot;, who the WWF had signed in February 1987. The Sheepherders, who originally joined Crockett after the merger, left in mid-1988 for the WWF, where they were renamed the Bushwhackers. Terry Taylor also departed, appearing in World Class for a few months (feuding with Chris Adams and Kevin Von Erich), then the WWF in mid-1988 as &quot;The Red Rooster&quot;. Taylor would go on to have a long WWF/WWE career behind-the-scenes, holding various management and creative team roles.

==Former personnel==
===Announcers===
Mid-South&#x27;s main television broadcasting team included Bill Watts and Boyd Pierce, with KTBS-TV staff announcer Reisor Bowden serving as ring announcer. Jim Ross joined Mid-South after the closure of Leroy McGuirk&#x27;s Tri-State promotion in Oklahoma, and remained through the transition to UWF. Bill Watts&#x27;s son Joel Watts was later added to the Mid-South/UWF broadcasting team, and also worked behind-the-scenes as a producer of the TV program.

Following Jim Crockett Promotions&#x27; purchase of the UWF, both Bill and Joel Watts exited the promotion and Jim Ross was joined by various partners including Magnum T. A., Michael P.S. Hayes and Missy Hyatt. Veteran JCP announcer Bob Caudle became Ross&#x27;s permanent partner near the closure of UWF. Frank Dusek and Toni Adams also served as ringside commentators during the course of its UWF tenure; both of whom moved on to World Class.

<text>The Nitobe Memorial Garden is a -acre (one hectare) traditional Japanese garden located at the University of British Columbia, just outside the city limits of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Although it is part of the UBC Botanical Garden, Nitobe Memorial Garden is located next to UBC&#x27;s Asian Centre, two kilometres from the main UBC Botanical Garden.

== Background and history ==

The garden honours Japanese agronomist, diplomat, political scientist, politician, and writer Nitobe Inazō (1862–1933), who died in Victoria, British Columbia (now the sister city of Nitobe&#x27;s home town Morioka), and whose goal was &quot;to become a bridge across the Pacific&quot;.

In recognition of his distinguished international service and his efforts to promote a closer understanding between Japan and Canada, friends of Dr. Nitobe and members of the Japanese community in Vancouver, and the Government of Japan erected a permanent stone memorial on the campus of UBC.

However, the memorial garden was ruined during World War II, possibly due to anti‐Japanese feelings at the time. Afterwards, the Japanese community in Vancouver and the Government of Japan agreed to build the current Nitobe Memorial Garden. Most of the construction costs were covered by the Japan–Canada Society in Tokyo, and a fund‐raising campaign by the Japanese community in Vancouver, although some grants were received from The Canada Council and The Leon and Thea Koerner Foundation. The Japan–Canada Society in Tokyo contributed over $21 000 and the Japanese Canadian community in B.C. collected over $7000. Through the offices of the Japan Consul, the Government of Japan selected Kannosuke Mori (1894–1960) from Chiba University to design the Garden. Mori arrived early in 1959 and stayed at the University until after the official opening of the garden in June, 1960. 

The case of Nitobe Memorial Garden&#x27;s restoration represents the problems all historic preservation can face. As Mori recognized, the maintenance of a Japanese garden, more than any other style of garden in the world, requires significant collaboration. With a proper maintenance plan, the Japanese garden outside of Japan can be a place where an institution and community collaborate, promoting cultural understanding through the process. However, once a garden lacks proper management, it can become a place of humiliation and cultural misunderstanding.

The Nitobe Memorial Garden has also been the subject of more than fifteen years&#x27; study by a UBC professor, who believes that its construction hides a number of impressive features, including references to Japanese philosophy and mythology, shadow bridges visible only at certain times of year, and positioning of a lantern that is filled with light at the exact date and time of Nitobe&#x27;s death each year. The garden is behind the university&#x27;s Asian Centre, which is built with steel girders from Japan&#x27;s exhibit at the 1970 Osaka Expo.

== Features ==
The Nitobe Memorial Garden features a fully functional Japanese tea house called Ichibō-an, surrounded by an outer roji tea garden with a waiting bench, and an inner garden.

The garden also features several lanterns of different varieties, including a snow viewing lantern and the Nitobe Lantern, featuring carvings of a zodiac, chrysanthemums, a dog (Nitobe&#x27;s birth sign), and the inscription &quot;I.M., Inazo Nitobe, 1861–1933, Apostle of Goodwill Among Nations&quot;, erected by his friends&quot;. Another feature of the garden is its pond, which supports a small ecosystem of fish as well as some water skimming insects.

First time visitors to the garden will benefit from reading the self-guided tour handout, as the Zen garden has no signs indicating the correct way to walk its irregular paths, as signs would be considered a distraction. It is recommended to spend around 45-minutes to fully immerse into and appreciate the natural beauty and symbolism the Nitobe Garden offers to travellers, which also offers alternative paths other than the gravel path surrounding the perimeter of the pond. 

== Local engagement and community events ==
The garden attracts visitors in many different ways. From daily tour groups, visitors, and weddings, the garden attracts visitors from all over the world. The garden is set on one of the largest university campuses in Canada and Vancouver is a world famous city. For both of these reasons, the garden is able to attract year round visitors. An active marketing and communications department at the UBC Botanical Garden also serves an important role in attracting visitors to the garden. 

Centennial Celebrations at Nitobe 2016 marked the 100th anniversary of the UBC Botanical Garden. Included in the celebrations were events at the Nitobe Memorial Garden, with a Tanabata event on July 7, 2016. Other events in the year were to run concurrently with events at UBC Botanical Garden to serve as a means of attracting visitors to both the Nitobe Memorial Garden and the UBC Botanical Garden as the gardens move into their second century.

<text>Oyster Bay is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) within – and the Town Seat of – the Town of Oyster Bay, in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 7,049 at the time of the 2020 census.

The hamlet&#x27;s area was considerably larger before several of its parts incorporated as separate villages. At least six of the 36 villages and hamlets of the Town of Oyster Bay have shores on Oyster Bay Harbor and its inlets, and many of these were previously considered part of the hamlet of Oyster Bay; three of those are now known as Mill Neck, Bayville &amp; Centre Island. The Oyster Bay Post Office (ZIP code 11771) serves portions of the surrounding villages also, including Oyster Bay Cove, Laurel Hollow, Mill Neck, Muttontown, Centre Island, Cove Neck, and Upper Brookville.

== History ==
The first mention of Oyster Bay comes from Dutch Captain David Pietersz. de Vries, who in his journal recalls how on June 4, 1639, he &quot;came to anchor in Oyster Bay, which is a large bay which lies on the north side of the Great Island… There are fine oysters here, whence our nation has given it the name of Oyster Bay.&quot;

Oyster Bay was settled by the Dutch, and was the boundary between the Dutch New Amsterdam colony and the English New England colonies. The English, under Peter Wright, first settled in the area in 1653. The boundary between the Dutch and English was somewhat fluid which led to each group having their own Main Street. Many Quakers came to Oyster Bay, escaping persecution from Dutch authorities in New Amsterdam. These included Elizabeth Feake and her husband Captain John Underhill, whom she converted to Quakerism.

Other notable Quakers to settle in Oyster Bay were the brothers John Townsend and Henry Townsend. Noted dissenter and founder of Quakerism George Fox visited Oyster Bay in 1672, where he spoke with the Wrights, Underhill and Feake at a Quaker gathering on the site of Council Rock, facing the Mill Pond.

During the Revolutionary War, Raynham Hall was owned by the irredentist Townsend family. For a six-month period from 1778 to 1779, the Townsend home served as British headquarters for the Queen&#x27;s Rangers led by Lt. Col. John Graves Simcoe. Simcoe was often visited by British officer Major John Andre. According to legend, on one of these visits Samuel Townsend&#x27;s daughter Sally Townsend overheard the two officers discussing Benedict Arnold&#x27;s traitorous plot to surrender the fort at West Point to the British. The plot was thwarted when three Americans on patrol captured Andre near West Point, preventing what would have been a disastrous defeat for the colonists in the Revolutionary War.

In the 1880s, the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) extended rail service from Locust Valley as a means to establish a connection between New York and Boston, via steamboat on Long Island Sound. On June 21, 1889, the first LIRR train arrived in Oyster Bay. In the following year, service commenced with the train coaches being loaded onto a ferry for a connection to the New Haven Railroad at Norwalk, CT. Service lasted less than a year. 

Around the time railroad service was introduced, Theodore Roosevelt, the future 26th President of the United States, chose to make his home at Sagamore Hill, in present-day Cove Neck, a neighboring incorporated village (Cove Neck was not incorporated until 1927). Sagamore Hill was completed in 1886. This is where Roosevelt lived until his death in 1919. His wife Edith Roosevelt continued to occupy the house until her death, nearly three decades later, in September 1948. On July 25, 1962, Congress established the Sagamore Hill National Historic Site to preserve the house.

Efforts to honor Theodore Roosevelt in Oyster Bay have greatly improved the hamlet. These include design of the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Park. Other Roosevelt-related landmarks have been restored including Snouder&#x27;s Drug Store – location of the first telegraph in Oyster Bay, Moore&#x27;s Building – today the Wild Honey restaurant, and proposals to restore the Oyster Bay Long Island Rail Road Station – home station of TR and the Octagon Hotel – built in 1851 and once home to offices of Governor Roosevelt. A local non-profit, the Oyster Bay Main Street Association, developed an audio tour of these historic sites and many others called the Oyster Bay History Walk.

The oysters that give the bay its name are now the only source of traditionally farmed oysters from Long Island, providing up to 90% of all the oysters harvested in New York State.

When Hurricane Sandy hit Oyster Bay in 2012, West Shore Road was demolished. Due to the damages, commuters between Bayville and Oyster Bay had to take a detour through Mill Neck, on-and-off for 4 years.

==Notable people==
Oyster Bay is known for the residence and summer White House of Theodore Roosevelt, Sagamore Hill (though that residence is in a nearby area known since 1927 as the &quot;Village of Cove Neck&quot;).

Many well-known American celebrities spent their youth in this town; among its better known former residents are musician Billy Joel, who mentions the town in his song &quot;The Ballad of Billy the Kid&quot;, tennis players John McEnroe and his brother Patrick, actress Heather Matarazzo, authors Thomas Pynchon and Tracy Kidder, basketball coach Rick Pitino of Bayville, who attended St. Dominic&#x27;s School here, and Sonic Youth guitarist Lee Ranaldo (Pynchon and Ranaldo attended Oyster Bay High School). 

A less distinguished figure from the hamlet&#x27;s past is Typhoid Mary, whose contagiousness was discovered following an investigation into her employment at a summer home in Oyster Bay in 1906. Composer John Barry lived in Oyster Bay until his death in 2011. William Woodward Jr., accidental victim of 1955&#x27;s &quot;Shooting of the Century&quot; and subject of Dominic Dunne&#x27;s book and NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Two Mrs. Grenvilles&quot; was also a resident of Oyster Bay.

It was also the setting of the 2000 film &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;.

==Library==

The Oyster Bay-East Norwich Public Library is a public library serving the residents of the communities of Oyster Bay and East Norwich. Today the library provides a variety of services for youth and adults.

===History===
For over two hundred years the residents of Oyster Bay did not have a public library as we know it today. Before the turn of the twentieth century there were &quot;reading rooms&quot; instead. One of the earliest was opened by the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1873, called the Oyster Bay Reading Room and Lyceum, with a focus on history and genealogy.

Others included one run by Christ Church, begun in 1889 by Reverend Henry Homer Washburn, to encourage people to spend less time at saloons. He gave up on the idea when his reading room was used more for card playing than reading.

Then in 1893 the People&#x27;s Library and Reading Room opened on east Main Street and it is that collection of books which would later be brought to this building.

The Oyster Bay-East Norwich Public Library was originally constructed in 1901, through the efforts and donations of many community leaders, notably Andrew Snouder of Snouder&#x27;s Drug Store. One of the early fundraising efforts was the laying of a cornerstone by Theodore Roosevelt in 1899, when the land had been donated by Mrs. Harriet Swan, but no plans for the building itself had yet been developed. In the time between the laying of that cornerstone, and the construction of the actual building, the symbolic masonry corner was lost and has still never been found.

Another early contributor was Andrew Carnegie, the industrialist and philanthropist. He had a niece who lived near the village and when he heard of the efforts to begin a library here he donated $1,000 to help the cause. Carnegie continued this thousand dollar annual contribution for many years afterwards, which helped greatly during the early years of the library&#x27;s history. The brick building to the left as you face the front of the library represents the original structure, which was wood frame until 1949, when an extensive renovation took place.

To the right is a frame house built around 1890 which for many generations was a doctor&#x27;s office. It was purchased by the library and connected to the original building in 1975. This house is often referred to as the Bishop house, named for Dr. Bishop who had a medical practice there. In 1994 the brick and glass additions behind the Bishop House were added on to further expand the facilities which now include a spacious and sunny children&#x27;s room.

==Economy==
Acclaim Entertainment was originally located in the hamlet of Oyster Bay. It originally occupied a one-room office in Oyster Bay. At a later time it occupied a brick structure with two stories. In 1994 Acclaim bought a headquarters building in Glen Cove.
