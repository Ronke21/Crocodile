<text>The &quot;Centaur&quot; class aircraft carrier was the final iteration of the 1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier developed by the United Kingdom for the Royal Navy during the Second World War. They were designed in 1943 to operate higher-performance aircraft than the preceding . Four ships were laid down in 1944-1945 and completed in 1953-1959. Rapid developments in carrier warfare and technology overtook the ships even as they were under construction, and the associated costs of modernisation led to ships being completed to different specifications. Only the last ship, , was fitted as a modern fixed-wing carrier; she was also the last of the class to retire in 2017 as .

==Development==
Britain hoped to order eight light fleet carriers in 1943 to supplement the . Matters were complicated by the demand to operate larger and higher performing aircraft; at the end of 1942, the Joint Technical Committee recommended that carriers be able to operate aircraft with a landing speed of . A new light carrier design was required as the could not be modified to handle the new requirements; it became the first British carrier design to be dominated by aircraft operations. A sketch design was prepared by the end of May 1943, and the final design was approved in March 1944; it was revised in 1947.

Eight of the new light carriers were ordered in 1943. It quickly became apparent that wartime demands on shipyard capacity made it impossible to complete the ships in 1946. Only three - &quot;Albion&quot;, &quot;Centaur&quot;, &quot;Elephant&quot; - started construction in 1944; &quot;Bulwark&quot; started in 1945; the remainder were cancelled on 15 October 1945 with &quot;Elephant&quot; being renamed &quot;Hermes&quot; after one of the cancelled ships. The remainder were completed in the 1950s

The cost of modernisation saw the ships diverge in capability even before completion. &quot;Albion&quot; and &quot;Bulwark&quot; were completed with interim angled flight decks and hydraulic catapults. They were not modernised to operate modern aircraft, instead being converted into helicopter assault ships (&quot;commando carriers&quot;). &quot;Centaur&quot; was partially modernised with steam catapults shortly after being commissioned and limited to operating mainly de Havilland Sea Vixen fighters until retirement in 1965. &quot;Hermes&quot; was the last ship completed - in 1959 - and the only one to be fully modernised. Her career as a conventional carrier ended in 1970 while operating Sea Vixens and Blackburn Buccaneers; afterwards, she served as a helicopter carrier and then as a V/STOL carrier operating Sea Harrier fighters. &quot;Hermes&quot; was sold to India as , and continued to operate Sea Harriers from 1987 until retiring in 2017.

==Design==

The 1942 light fleet carrier was conceived as a wartime expedient to respond to the Royal Navy&#x27;s desperate need for fast carriers. The design was ruthlessly simplified to reduce cost and construction times; the hull was unarmoured and built to merchant standards, armament was limited to light anti-aircraft guns, and it used existing cruiser machinery. During requirements discussions, it was suggested that durability was needed for just three years of service.

From the initial 1943 sketches, the &quot;Centaur&quot; was designed for longer post-war careers to a hybrid of merchant and warship standards. The flight deck, longitudinal protective bulkhead, middle deck over the machinery, and lower decks over aviation fuel were constructed with hardened steel. The magazines and bomb rooms were covered by 2-inch non-cemented armour. The remainder of the hull was made of mild steel. The hull was enlarged to accommodate larger aircraft; the 1-inch hardened steel construction of the flight deck also supported heavier aircraft. The axial flight deck included one catapult. The machinery was half the set used on the for 76,000 shaft horsepower on two shafts; there was no capacity to develop new machinery. Armament neared fleet carrier standards with 4 twin 4.5-inch BD guns.

The design was modified in 1947. Living arrangements were upgraded to peacetime standards and to include centralised messing; the aft hangar was converted into additional living space. The addition of a second catapult may have also contributed to the hangar length being reduced from to 381 ft. The 4.5 inch guns were removed. The island was redesigned to add the new two-deck configuration for the action information organisation. The intended radar suite was an air warning Type 980, a gunnery air search Type 293, and two pairs of air control Type 277Q; none of these were actually used.

==Ships==
===&quot;Hermes&quot; (cancelled)===
&quot;Hermes&quot; was the original name-ship of the class. She was ordered from Cammell Laird of Birkenhead on 12 July 1943. No work had been done when construction was ordered to be deferred in early 1944. The ship was cancelled on 15 October 1945. The name was transferred to &quot;Elephant&quot;.

===&quot;Centaur&quot;===

&quot;Centaur&quot; was the first ship completed and the only one completed to the original design. She was ordered from Harland &amp; Wolff on 12 July 1943 and laid down on 30 May 1944. Construction was halted for two years. The ship was completed on 1 September 1953 and commissioned on 17 September. An interim 5.5-degree angled deck was fitted at Portsmouth Dockyard from October 1953 to May 1954. &quot;Centaur&quot; underwent a limited modernisation refit from September 1956 to September 1958 during which the hydraulic catapults were replaced by BS-4 steam catapults; features required to operate modern strike aircraft, like a fully angled flight deck, were not fitted due to yard capacity issues. Afterwards, she was limited to mainly Sea Vixen fighters and Fairey Gannet anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft.

&quot;Centaur&quot; operated as an aircraft carrier and a helicopter assault ship during the suppression of the Tanganyika Rifles in 1964. She decommissioned for the last time on 27 September 1965 and became an accommodation ship for the remainder of her life. Plans to convert the ship into a helicopter carrier were cancelled in 1966. The hulk was sold for scrapping on 11 August 1972.

===&quot;Albion&quot;===

&quot;Albion&quot; was ordered from Swan Hunter on 12 July 1943 and laid down at Wallsend-on-Tyne on 23 March 1944. Work slowed after 1945. The hull was launched on 6 May 1947 and then laid-up with machinery installed; construction resumed after August 1949. She was commissioned on 26 May 1954 as the first carrier ever to be completed with both an angled flight deck - an interim 5.5-degree one - and mirror landing aids. She participated in Operation Musketeer during the Suez Crisis in 1956.

&quot;Albion&quot; was to have been modernised with steam catapults after &quot;Centaur&quot;, but this was cancelled after the 1957 defence policy review. Instead, she became the second ship of the class - after &quot;Bulwark&quot; - to be converted into a helicopter assault ship; the refit was done at Portsmouth Dockyard from February 1961 to July 1962. &quot;Albion&quot; could carry 900 troops, a greater number than her sister&#x27;s due to a more extensive conversion; &quot;Bulwark&quot; was later refitted to a similar standard. Another defence review in 1973 led to &quot;Albion&quot; being discarded - rather than being refitted - to pay for . She was decommissioned for the last time on 2 March 1973, to be replaced by when the latter&#x27;s conversion to a helicopter assault ship was completed in August 1973. &quot;Albion&quot; was sold on 22 October 1973 to be converted into a heavy-lift crane to support the North Sea oil industry; the scheme fell through and the hull was sold for scrapping a few weeks later.

===&quot;Bulwark&quot;===

&quot;Bulwark&quot; was ordered from Harland &amp; Wolff on 12 July 1943, but deferred in early 1944. She was laid down on 10 May 1945, becoming the fourth ship of the class instead of &quot;Monmouth&quot; which Fairfield had been unable to start construction of in 1944. Work slowed after the war. The carrier was commissioned on 29 October 1954, and was completed with an interim 5.5-degree angled flight deck on 4 November. &quot;Bulwark&quot; served as a trials and training carrier in 1955 and 1956, replacing which was laid up in December 1954 and sold for scrapping in November 1956. The carrier returned to operational status in August 1956 and participated in Operation Musketeer during the Suez Crisis in November.

The 1957 defence policy review led to &quot;Bulwark&quot; being converted into a helicopter assault ship rather than being modernised for fixed-wing aircraft. The initial conversion was done at Portsmouth Dockyard from January 1959 to January 1960, with another refit occurring in 1963 to match the more extensive conversion of &quot;Albion&quot;. In June 1968, she demonstrated - for the first time - the reinforcement of Norway by assault carriers during NATO Exercise &quot;Polar Express&quot;.

The carrier was reduced to reserve in April 1976. In 1978, was retired before the s entered service; &quot;Bulwark&quot; was refitted in 1977-1979 and returned to service on 23 February 1979 to fill the gap. The ship suffered a boiler room fire in March 1980; the damage was not fully repaired and her maximum speed was decreased. Another major fire, coupled with the ship&#x27;s poor material state, led to her retirement six months earlier than planned; she decommissioned for the last time on 27 March 1981. The hull was used for demolitions training by the Royal Marines. A proposal to convert the hull into an aircraft maintenance carrier for the Falklands War was rejected due to her poor condition and insufficient equipment. &quot;Bulwark&quot; was sold for scrapping in 1984.

===&quot;Hermes&quot; (ex-&quot;Elephant&quot;)===

&quot;Elephant&quot; was ordered from Vickers-Armstrongs on 12 July 1943 and laid down at Barrow-in-Furness on 21 June 1944. She was renamed as &quot;Hermes&quot; on 5 November 1945 following the cancellation of the name-ship of the class. Construction was protracted due to work on the higher-priority and major design revisions. The ship was launched in 1953 only to undergo full modernisation that required partial disassembly and reconstruction; steam catapults, a full 8-degree angled flight deck, a side lift instead of a forward centreline lift, the Comprehensive Display System (CDS), and the Type 984 radar were installed. &quot;Hermes&quot; completed builder&#x27;s trials on 18 November 1959 and was commissioned on 25 November.

&quot;Hermes&quot; was converted into a helicopter assault ship at Portsmouth Dockyard from 1 March 1971 to 14 August 1973; the steam catapults, arrestor gear, CDS, and the Type 984 were removed. She was refitted as an ASW carrier in 1977. The carrier trialled the Sea Harrier in 1977-1978. From May 1980 to 9 May 1981 she was refitted at Portsmouth into a general-purpose carrier operating Sea Harriers, and ASW and air assault helicopters; a 12-degree ski-jump and Ferranti 1600E computer were installed. She was the flagship of the British task force during the Falklands War in 1982.

&quot;Hermes&quot; paid off for the last time on 22 November 1983 and sold to India after the completion of . She was refitted at Devonport Dockyard for a year and then commissioned into the Indian Navy as INS &quot;Viraat&quot; on 12 May 1987. &quot;Viraat&quot; decommissioned on 6 March 2017, and scrapped starting in 2020.

===&quot;Arrogant&quot;===
&quot;Arrogant&quot; was ordered from Swan Hunter on 12 July 1943, deferred in early 1944, and then cancelled on 15 October 1945. No work appears to have been done. She was to be built at Wallsend-on-Tyne.

===&quot;Monmouth&quot;===
&quot;Monmouth&quot; was ordered from the Fairfield Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company on 12 July 1943. She was to have been one of the four ships to start construction in 1944, but Fairfield was too overloaded to do so; &quot;Bulwark&quot; replaced &quot;Monmouth&quot; as the fourth ship in 1945. &quot;Monmouth&quot; was cancelled on 15 October 1945 with no work apparently having been done.

===&quot;Polyphemus&quot;===
&quot;Polyphemus&quot; was ordered from Devonport Dockyard on 11 August 1943, to be constructed after HMS &quot;Terrible&quot;. Construction was deferred in late 1943 and cancelled on 15 October 1945. Parsons Marine Engineering received orders for machinery before the deferral; the orders were cancelled before the ship was. The slipway would have required a slight extension to build the carrier; Fore Street was purchased to make room and walled off, and was only returned to Plymouth in 2005.

<text>Gideon Moshe Sa&#x27;ar (; born 9 December 1966) is an Israeli politician currently serving as Israel&#x27;s Foreign Minister and member of the Knesset for the party New Hope.

Sa&#x27;ar was first elected to the Knesset as a member of Likud in 2003, serving until 2014. During that period, he served as Education Minister (2009–2013) and Minister of the Interior (2013–2014). After a political hiatus, he returned to the Knesset in 2019, and unsuccessfully challenged Benjamin Netanyahu for the leadership of Likud. He subsequently formed his own party, New Hope, and became Minister of Justice (2021–2022) and Deputy Prime Minister (2021) in the Bennett-Lapid government. In 2022, Sa&#x27;ar formed an electoral pact with Benny Gantz&#x27;s Blue and White faction named National Unity. As a member of the National Unity alliance, he returned to the opposition following the 2022 election. 

Following the breakout of the Israel–Hamas war, National Unity joined the governing coalition and Sa&#x27;ar was named minister without portfolio and an observer in the war cabinet. In March 2024, Sa&#x27;ar withdrew New Hope from National Unity and from the coalition, and resigned as minister, before returning to the government in September 2024. In November 2024 Sa&#x27;ar replaced Israel Katz as Foreign Minister.

==Biography==
Gideon Moshe Serchensky (later Sa&#x27;ar) was born in Tel Aviv. His mother Bruriah was born in Israel to a seventh-generation Bukharian Jewish family, whose ancestors arrived during the Ottoman Empire. His father Shmuel is an Ashkenazi Jew who was born in Ukraine and moved to Argentina as a child before immigrating to Israel. He has two siblings, a brother and a sister. His father was a doctor, while his mother was a teacher. Sa&#x27;ar grew up primarily in Tel Aviv, but as a child, he lived for a number of years in Mitzpe Ramon, where his father worked as a pediatrician, and in kibbutz Sde Boker, where he was the kibbutz doctor. At the time, Sde Boker was the residence of Israel&#x27;s founding prime minister, David Ben-Gurion. His father was frequently in contact with Ben-Gurion as the kibbutz doctor, and the young Gideon Sa&#x27;ar met Ben-Gurion numerous times when accompanying his father on visits to his home, during which Ben-Gurion gave him geography quizzes. After serving in the Israel Defense Forces as an intelligence NCO in the Golani Brigade, Sa&#x27;ar studied political science at Tel Aviv University and then went on to study law at the same institution.

In May 2013 Sa&#x27;ar married Israeli news anchor Geula Even, with whom he has two children, David and Shira. Geula was born to Lithuanian-Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union. Sa&#x27;ar has another two children, Alona and Daniela, from his first wife Shelly, as well as one grandchild.

==Political career==

Sa&#x27;ar worked as an aide to the Attorney General between 1995 and 1997, and then as an aide to the State Attorney until 1998.
Sa&#x27;ar was appointed cabinet Secretary in 1999 and again from 2001–2 after Likud&#x27;s Ariel Sharon won a special election for Prime Minister. In the 2003 elections he won a seat in the Knesset on Likud&#x27;s list, and was appointed Likud Parliamentary Group Chairman as well as Chairman of the Coalition. He was opposed to Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement plan, and attempted to pass a bill demanding a referendum on the subject.

After retaining his seat in the 2006 elections he was reappointed Group Chairman and also became a deputy Knesset speaker.

While in the Knesset, Sa&#x27;ar proposed bills to jail employers who fire pregnant women, (he chaired the Knesset Committee on the Status of Women) and to ban cosmetics testing on animals.

In December 2008 Sa&#x27;ar won the Likud primaries for its list going into the 2009 elections, giving him second place on the Likud list after leader Benjamin Netanyahu. He retained his seat, and was appointed Minister of Education on 31 March.

In September 2014, Sa&#x27;ar announced that he would be resigning his post before the next election; with rumors of alleged sexual harassments background for his sudden resignation. He said he would still remain a member of the Likud. On 17 September, he took a hiatus from politics. He left the Knesset on 5 November, and was replaced by Leon Litinetsky.

On 3 April 2017 Sa&#x27;ar announced his return to politics and intention to run in the next Likud primaries. He was seen as a potential candidate for party leadership and eventually prime minister.

In September 2017, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; ranked him 5th on its &quot;50 most influential Jews&quot; list, calling him the &quot;heir apparent to the Likud throne&quot;. In September 2018, he was ranked 25th along with fellow Likud members Yisrael Katz and Gilad Erdan.

=== Likud leadership run ===
In October 2019, amid coalition talks, Prime Minister Netanyahu indicated he was considering holding a snap election for party leadership. In a terse tweet, Sa&#x27;ar responded &quot;I&#x27;m ready.&quot; After Netanyahu decided against holding a leadership election, Sa&#x27;ar confirmed he would run in the next election and would support Netanyahu until then.

On 24 November 2019, Sa&#x27;ar asked the Likud Central Committee to schedule a party leadership race within two weeks, allowing the winner to try to form a coalition government before the Knesset would be dissolved which would trigger new Knesset elections, the third in a year. After the Knesset was dissolved and elections set for 2 March 2020, leadership elections were set for 26 December 2019. Sa&#x27;ar received the endorsement of a few Likud Members of Knesset, including Haim Katz, the powerful head of the Likud central committee. Netanyahu was endorsed by Minister of Public Security Gilad Erdan while Knesset speaker Yuli Edelstein declined to endorse either candidate.

During the campaign, Netanyahu&#x27;s campaign slammed Sa&#x27;ar on Twitter saying he &quot;has aligned with the Left and the media in order to remove the prime minister from the leadership of the state&quot;. At a conference the week before, Sa&#x27;ar had spoken against the &quot;two state illusion&quot; and criticized Netanyahu for offering territorial concessions to the Palestinians despite them being uninterested in peace talks, saying, &quot;Around the world, the words &#x27;two-state solution&#x27; remain a kind of certificate of acceptance. I have to tell you this is not a helpful position.&quot;

As widely expected, Netanyahu won handily with 72.5% to Sa&#x27;ar&#x27;s 27.5%.

=== New Hope ===
In December 2020, Sa&#x27;ar announced that he would leave Likud and will form his own party, called New Hope. He submitted his Knesset resignation on 9 December, which went into effect on 11 December. The party contested the 2021 Israeli legislative election, with the intent of forming a governing coalition, and removing Netanyahu from office. He regained his seat in the Knesset, as New Hope gained six seats at the elections. Following the election, Sa&#x27;ar became Minister of Justice in the thirty-sixth government of Israel.

On 10 July 2022 Sa&#x27;ar announced that New Hope would form an electoral alliance with Benny Gantz&#x27;s Blue and White, to be named National Unity. Sa&#x27;ar was second on the list. National Unity contested the 2022 Israeli legislative election, where it placed fourth with 12 seats and did not join the thirty-seventh government.

Following the outbreak of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Sa&#x27;ar was one of five members of National Unity to join the emergency war government. Sa&#x27;ar was sworn in as a minister without portfolio on 12 October 2023. On 12 March, Sa&#x27;ar announced that New Hope would leave the National Unity alliance. On 16 March, Sa&#x27;ar threatened to withdraw New Hope from the coalition if Prime Minister Netanyahu did not appoint him to the war cabinet; Netanyahu did not do so, and nine days later, Sa&#x27;ar and the rest of New Hope left the government.

On 29 September 2024, Sa&#x27;ar rejoined the Netanyahu cabinet as a minister without portfolio following a request from Netanyahu, with Sa&#x27;ar saying that his decision to return was “the patriotic and right thing to do now”.

On 5 November 2024, it was announced that Sa&#x27;ar would replace Israel Katz as Foreign Minister.

===Foreign Minister===
On 13 February 2025, Sa&#x27;ar spoke with New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters by phone about the ongoing ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the need for its full implementation including the release of all hostages and the resumption of humanitarian aid to the Palestinians. Sa&#x27;ar also thanked New Zealand for designating Hamas and the Houthis as terrorist organisations, and extended an invitiation for Peters to visit Israel.

==Personal awards==
In 2004 Saar was awarded the Italian honor of Ufficiale.

In 2009 he was awarded the OMC badge, for &quot;being a politician who has not been blemished to this day&quot; and for his action to strengthen the rule of law and his firm stand against political appointments.

In 2011 he was awarded an honorary degree by the President of Italy - Commendatore (Trustee) by the Italian Ambassador to Israel, Luigi Mattiolo, in recognition of his contribution to strengthening the relationship between Italy and Israel. 

On 17 April 2012 Sa&#x27;ar received the Orden del Mérito Civil, a first class honor awarded by the King of Spain, Juan Carlos I, for his contribution to Israel–Spain relations.

==Views and opinions==

Sa&#x27;ar has stated that he is opposed to a two-state solution, arguing &quot;There is no two-state solution; there is at most a two-state slogan&quot;, and that it would be &quot;a mistake to return to the idea of establishing a Palestinian state in Judea and Samaria as a solution to the conflict.&quot; He has expressed support for a long-term solution involving Jordan. He supported annexation of the West Bank, and supported the idea of Palestinian autonomy in a federation with Jordan. In 2020 he declared &quot;Between the Jordan River and the sea there won’t be another independent state&quot;. 
As a teenager, Saar joined the ultra-nationalist Tehiya movement protesting the 1982 evacuation of Israeli settlements in the Sinai Peninsula as per the Egypt–Israel peace treaty.

On 14 October 2023, in an interview with Israel&#x27;s Channel 12 News, Sa&#x27;ar said that the Gaza Strip &quot;must be smaller at the end&quot; of the war between Israel and Hamas, stating &quot;Whoever starts a war against Israel must lose territory.&quot;

During the Israel-Hamas war, he stated that he would insist that the war not be stopped until Hamas is defeated, and said that after the war the Palestinian Authority would not be able to control the Gaza Strip.

As he started working as foreign minister, Sa&#x27;ar stated &quot;Israel should look to Kurds, Druze and other minorities in neighbouring countries, in addition to Saudi Arabia, for support&quot;. &quot;The Kurdish people are a great nation, one of the great nations without political independence,&quot; he said at his ministerial exchange and inauguration ceremony on Sunday, describing Kurds as &quot;our natural ally&quot;. &quot;It is a national minority in four different countries, in two of which it enjoys autonomy: de facto in Syria and de jure in the Iraqi constitution.&quot; Sa&#x27;ar said Kurds are &quot;a victim of oppression and aggression from Iran and Turkey&quot;, and that Israel needed to strengthen ties to them. &quot;This has both political and security aspects,&quot; he added.

<text>Robert Falco (26 February 1882 – 14 January 1960) was a French judge at the Nuremberg trials, who later sat in the Cour de Cassation.

==Biography==
Falco was born in Paris into a Jewish family. His great-grandfather was decorated by Louis Philippe in 1831, and his maternal grandfather Alfred-Philibert Aldrophe worked as an architect for Leopold II of Belgium and Gustave de Rothschild. His father fought in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71, for which he was made a member of the Légion d&#x27;honneur, and later became the President of the Paris commercial court.

After the end of his legal studies Falco worked from 1903 as a barrister. In 1907 he gained his doctorate with a work on the &quot;Duties and Rights of Theatre Audiences&quot; and then worked as a judge at the court of chancery, but continued to plead until 1919.

He was later appointed to the Paris Court of Appeal. He was dismissed from this post in 1940 because of his Jewish origin. 

During the preparation of the Nuremberg Trials in June 1945 in London at the International Conference on Military Trials he represented France together with André Gros, professor of international law, and was one of the main authors of the London Charter of the International Military Tribunal, defining the procedures and protocols observed during the Nuremberg Trials, where he was one of the two French judges, as the alternative to Henri Donnedieu de Vabres.

On the basis of his work during the trials he was elected an Honorary Bencher of Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1946.

In 1947 Falco was reinstated in the French judiciary, at the Cour de Cassation.

He was awarded the Croix de Guerre and made a Commander of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. He died in Paris in 1960.

==Memoirs==
During the year he spent in Nuremberg, Falco kept notes which he later used in his memoirs of the trials. These memoirs remained unpublished for decades, but, illustrated with sketches by Jeanne Falco, the judge&#x27;s second wife, who accompanied him throughout the trials, are due to be published in September 2012 under the title &quot;Juge à Nuremberg&quot; by Editions Arbre bleu , with a preface by the historian Annette Wieviorka and an introduction by Guillaume Mouralis, an historian specialising in the history of international penal justice.

<doc id="485360" wikidata="Q3782071" url="?curid=485360" title="HMS Bulwark (R08)">
<text>The sixth HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot; of the Royal Navy was a 22,000 ton light fleet aircraft carrier. Initially commissioned as a light aircraft carrier in 1954, the ship was converted into a commando carrier in 1958 and recommissioned as such in 1960. &quot;Bulwark&quot; remained in this capacity until 1979 following failed efforts to sell the ship, &quot;Bulwark&quot; re-entered service as an anti-submarine warfare carrier and remained as such until being decommissioned in 1981. The ship was scrapped in 1984.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Bulwark&quot; was laid down by the Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard in Belfast on 10 May 1945. She was launched on 22 June 1948, but was not commissioned into the Royal Navy until 4 November 1954.

===1950s===

In 1956, &quot;Bulwark&quot; took part in her first combat operation, during the Suez Crisis, when she launched up to 600 sorties in what was then known as Operation Musketeer. On 13 September 1958, &quot;Bulwark&quot; was exercising with the frigate in the Gulf of Oman when the tankers and &quot;Fernand Gilabe&quot; collided in the Persian Gulf and caught fire, the tankers&#x27; crews abandoning ship. &quot;Bulwark&quot; went to the aid of the two blazing tankers, with her helicopters landing fire fighting parties onto the tankers. &quot;Bulwark&quot;, with the aid of the frigate , towed &quot;Melika&quot;, to Muscat. &quot;Bulwark&quot;″s Whirlwind helicopter squadron, 845 Naval Air Squadron, was awarded the Boyd Trophy for the squadron&#x27;s role in the rescue.

The final fixed wing complement, as embarked in 1957 (the Gannet squadron was dropped in 1958), was as follows:

In 1958 she paid off at Portsmouth for conversion into a commando carrier. Her sister ship, , did likewise in 1961.

===1960s===
In 1960, &quot;Bulwark&quot; was recommissioned with 42 Commando Royal Marines and 848 Squadron attached to the carrier. In 1961, due to an increasing threat of invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, &quot;Bulwark&quot; landed 42 Commando in Kuwait. In the same year, she became the first Royal Navy warship since the Second World War to commission outside the UK, commissioning instead in Singapore. She also took part in the campaign against Indonesia, during the Indonesian Confrontation. In June 1966 she carried out sea trials with the Kestrel: the forerunner of the Harrier fighter aircraft made famous during the Falklands War.

In 1967, she again commissioned in Singapore Naval Dockyard (HMS &quot;Sembawang&quot;), and following her work up, proceeded to Aden to cover the withdrawal and relieve &quot;Albion&quot;. By this time, &quot;Bulwark&quot;″s nickname &quot;The Rusty B&quot; had become firmly established.

In 1968, after service in the Arctic with 45 Commando embarked for Exercise Polar Express, the ship spent some time in dry dock in Portsmouth Dockyard for a refit. For the duration of the refit, the ship&#x27;s company was accommodated in .

In Spring 1969, with commanding officer Captain J.A. Templeton-Cotill (who would later become a rear admiral and Flag Officer Malta), &quot;Bulwark&quot; left for the Mediterranean Sea and Exercise Olympic Express in the Aegean, with visits to Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, Salonica, Venice, Villefranche, and Toulon. For the later part of this voyage, a TV crew embarked to shoot a documentary &#x27;Captain R.N.&#x27;. She returned to Devonport Dockyard to decommission in August 1969 for a four-month refit.

===1970s and 1980s===

In January 1970, &quot;Bulwark&quot; recommissioned and sailed to Singapore via Gibraltar, Cape Town, Gan, and Brunei. After a minor refit in Singapore Naval Dockyard (to repair damage sustained in Tropical Storm Diane after leaving Cape Town), the ship sailed for Kobe, Japan (EXPO 70), Hong Kong, Jakarta and Perth Australia before returning to Plymouth.

The ship visited Liverpool from 1 July to 7 July 1971.

In September 1971 &quot;Bulwark&quot; took part in exercises in the eastern Mediterranean with 845 Squadron embarked. Whilst at anchor off Trieste she suffered a boiler room fire, in &#x27;B&#x27; boiler room, and limped home on one set of boilers. The repairs were started in Plymouth by the dockyard but were then completed in Malta by the ships own company while involved in Operation Exit between January and end of March 1972.

In 1972, &quot;Bulwark&quot;, like her sister ship &quot;Albion&quot;, was involved in withdrawals across the declining empire. In 1972 she was headquarters ship for Operation Exit, the withdrawal from Malta, an emotional withdrawal for the Royal Navy. &quot;Bulwark&quot; lay in Grand Harbor for 11 weeks and flew more than 1,000 missions.

Later in 1972 she took part in exercises in the Caribbean Sea and visited Florida with 845 Squadron embarked. On the return journey, &quot;Bulwark&quot; had to discharge all remaining aviation fuel and transfer on to accompanying Royal Fleet Auxiliaries all ammunition to prepare to move in to dry dock after entering Plymouth. The spell in dry dock was extended due to dock yard strikes and she did not sail again until October.

In the January 1973 &quot;Bulwark&quot; sailed for exercises in the Caribbean Sea and suffered damage due to heavy storms during the 10-day crossing of the Atlantic. The first port of call was a 10-day visit to Charleston, South Carolina, which meant sailing under the Cooper Bridge. &quot;Bulwark&quot; became the largest warship to have sailed under that bridge. The following day brought a snow storm, the worst in this area for more than 80 years, which did not stop for about eight days. After the visit came the exercises in the Caribbean, with visits in between to Viaques and Puerto Rico.

Under the command of Captain Derek Bazalgette, she saw service in the Mediterranean in 1973 visiting Malta, Piraeus, Istanbul, Gibraltar and, in December 1973, Travemünde, the port of Lübeck. Owing to a delayed start date for refit, she embarked a company of Netherlands Marine Corps and spent early 1974 in the Dutch Caribbean, also visiting Cartagena, Colombia; she suffered damage during the storms of January 1974 in the eastern Atlantic. The 1974 refit was undertaken in Devonport Dockyard, during which time command transferred to Captain Johnnie R C Johnston. In 1975 she returned to the Mediterranean, visiting Gibraltar, Villefranche and Malta before returning to her home port of Plymouth in July.

In March 1976, &quot;Bulwark&quot; was withdrawn from service and placed in Reserve. Also during this year the Ministry of Defence offered &quot;Bulwark&quot; to the Peruvian Navy. After two years of negotiations finally the Royal Navy decided to keep the ship. Furthermore, she underwent a refit at Portsmouth in 1978, and was recommissioned as an anti-submarine warfare carrier on 23 February 1979, due to delays with the new aircraft carrier .

On 28 June 1979, &quot;Bulwark&quot; was involved in exercise Whiskey Venture, with 820 Squadron (flying Sea Kings) and 45 Royal Marine Commando embarked. Also during 1979, &quot;Bulwark&quot; was involved in trials of the Sea Harrier. At the start of 1980, &quot;Bulwark&quot; visited the United States of America; participating in Exercise Safe Passage off the east coast of the United States in late February. On 15 March, while alongside in Philadelphia, a fire destroyed one boiler, which could not be repaired to operational status. The carrier returned to Portsmouth on 2 April, and on 15 April embarked 45 Commando for Exercise Dawn Patrol off Sardinia. In August, &quot;Bulwark&quot; was involved in Exercise Teamwork 80 off Norway. On 9 November, a major fire damaged the forward hangar and some messdecks. Minimal repairs were performed to both areas in order for her to stay in service until HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; was commissioned in the spring of 1981.

==Decommissioning and fate==
On 27 March 1981, &quot;Bulwark&quot; returned to Portsmouth for the final time. She was decommissioned into unmaintained reserve without any repairs being attempted to the damaged boiler or other fire damage. The carrier would however, remain intact for the next two years. During the early stages of the Falklands War it was announced that &quot;Bulwark&quot; would be reactivated and sent south to support the fleet, and then remain as a headquarters hulk at Port Stanley following the war. A rapid ship survey, however, determined that in addition to the only minimally repaired fire damage suffered in 1980, her machinery and structure had deteriorated such that it would have taken as much as eight months and a significant amount of funds to get her minimally seaworthy.

She was finally declared for disposal in April 1983 and some material was removed as potential spares for . She remained anchored in harbour until she was towed from Portsmouth to Cairnryan to be scrapped in April 1984.

<text>HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot; (R21) was a &quot;Majestic&quot;-class light aircraft carrier operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) from 1955 until 1982, and was the third and final conventional aircraft carrier to serve in the RAN. &quot;Melbourne&quot; was the only Commonwealth naval vessel to sink two friendly warships in peacetime collisions.

&quot;Melbourne&quot; was laid down for the Royal Navy as the lead ship of the &quot;Majestic&quot; class in April 1943, and was launched as HMS &quot;Majestic&quot; (R77) in February 1945. At the end of the Second World War, work on the ship was suspended until she was purchased by the RAN in 1947. At the time of purchase, it was decided to incorporate new aircraft carrier technologies into the design, making &quot;Melbourne&quot; the third ship to be constructed with an angled flight deck. Delays in construction and integrating the enhancements meant that the carrier was not commissioned until 1955.

&quot;Melbourne&quot; never during her service career, having only peripheral, non-combat roles in relation to the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation and the Vietnam War. She was, however, involved in two major collisions with allied vessels; though &quot;Melbourne&quot; was not found to be the primary cause of either incident. The first collision occurred on the evening of 10 February 1964, in which &quot;Melbourne&quot; rammed and sank the RAN destroyer , when the latter altered course across her bow. 82 of &quot;Voyager&quot;″s personnel were killed, and two Royal Commissions were held to investigate the incident. The second collision occurred in the early morning of 3 June 1969, when &quot;Melbourne&quot; also rammed the United States Navy (USN) destroyer in similar circumstances. 74 American personnel died, and a joint USN–RAN Board of Inquiry was held. These incidents, along with several minor collisions, shipboard accidents and aircraft losses, led to the belief that &quot;Melbourne&quot; was jinxed.

&quot;Melbourne&quot; was paid off from RAN service in 1982. A proposal to convert her for use as a floating casino failed, and a 1984 sale was cancelled, before she was sold for scrap in 1985 and towed to China for breaking. The scrapping was delayed so &quot;Melbourne&quot; could be studied by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) as part of a secret project to develop a Chinese aircraft carrier and used to train PLAN aviators in carrier flight operations.

==Construction and acquisition==
&quot;Melbourne&quot; was constructed by Vickers-Armstrongs at their Naval Construction Yard in Barrow-in-Furness, North West England. The ship was laid down as HMS &quot;Majestic&quot; on 15 April 1943, and was launched on 28 February 1945 by Lady Anderson, the wife of Sir John Anderson, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. Following the end of World War II, the Admiralty ordered the suspension of many British shipbuilding projects, including the fitting out of &quot;Majestic&quot; and her five sister ships. Construction resumed in 1946, and major modifications to the design were incorporated.

A review by the Australian Government&#x27;s Defence Committee held after recommended that the post-war forces of the RAN be structured around a Task Force incorporating multiple aircraft carriers. Initial plans were for three carriers, with two active and a third in reserve, although funding cuts led to the purchase of only two carriers in June 1947: &quot;Majestic&quot; and sister ship HMS &quot;Terrible&quot;, for the combined cost of AU£2.75 million, plus stores, fuel, and ammunition. As &quot;Terrible&quot; was the closer of the two ships to completion, she was finished without modification, and was commissioned into the RAN on 16 December 1948 as . Work progressed on &quot;Majestic&quot; at a slower rate, as she was upgraded with the latest technology and equipment. The &quot;Colossus&quot;-class carrier was loaned to the RAN from 13 November 1952 until 12 August 1955 to cover &quot;Majestic&quot;″s absence.

The &quot;Majestic&quot; experienced delays in its construction due to labour difficulties, late delivery of equipment, additional requirements for Australian operations and the prioritisation of the construction of merchant ships. Incorporation of new systems and enhancements caused the cost of the RAN carrier acquisition program to increase to AU£8.3 million. Construction and fitting out did not finish until October 1955. As the carrier neared completion, a commissioning crew was formed in Australia and first used to return &quot;Vengeance&quot; to the United Kingdom.

The completed carrier was commissioned into the RAN as HMAS &quot;Majestic&quot; on 26 October 1955. Two days later, the ship was renamed &quot;Melbourne&quot; by Lady White, the wife of Sir Thomas White, the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, and recommissioned.

==Design==

As the lead ship of the &quot;Majestic&quot;-class of light aircraft carriers, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was conceived as a modified version of the &quot;Colossus&quot;-class carrier, incorporating improvements in flight deck design and habitability. &quot;Majestic&quot;- and &quot;Colossus&quot;-class carriers were almost identical in hull design and both were considered subclasses of the &quot;1942 design&quot; light aircraft carrier program. These carriers were intended as &quot;disposable warships&quot;: to be disposed of at the end of World War II or within three years of entering service.

&quot;Melbourne&quot; had a standard displacement of , which increased to at full load. At launch, the carrier was long overall, but this was increased by during a refit in 1969. She had a beam of , and a draught of . &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s two propellers were driven by two Parsons single-reduction geared turbine sets providing 40,000 shp, which were powered by four Admiralty 3-drum boilers. The carrier could achieve a top speed of , and a range of at or at . The size of the ship&#x27;s company averaged 1,350 officers and sailors, including 350 personnel from the embarked Fleet Air Arm squadrons.

===Modifications during construction===

Following the recommencement of construction, modifications were made to the ship, based on wartime experience and Britain&#x27;s post-war carrier warfare technology and innovations. These included an angled flight deck, steam catapult and a mirror landing aid, making &quot;Melbourne&quot; the third aircraft carrier (following and ) to be constructed with these features, instead of having them added later.

The main modifications centred around the need to operate jet aircraft, which were larger and heavier than those propeller-driven aircraft that the carrier was originally designed for. The flight deck was angled 5.5 degrees left of the carrier&#x27;s centreline, to allow for the simultaneous launch and recovery of aircraft. Despite an increase to approximately one acre (4,000 square metres, 4,800 square yards) in area, the deck was still significantly smaller than other Cold War era carriers; S-2 Trackers, with their wingspan, had less than a metre&#x27;s clearance for their starboard wingtip when landing, and pilots from other navies often refused to attempt landing. Water rationing was required in the early years of the carrier&#x27;s operation, as the ship&#x27;s fresh water supply was insufficient to freely provide for the steam catapult, propulsion turbines and crew. The flight deck, hangar deck and aircraft lifts were strengthened, and reinforced arrestor cables were installed. Flight direction radar was included, making &quot;Melbourne&quot; the only military airfield in the Australasian region at the time capable of operating aircraft at night and in poor weather.

===Refits===

Early in her career, &quot;Melbourne&quot; underwent a series of short annual refits, commencing in September and ending in January or February of the next year. As time passed, the refits increased in duration or were replaced by major upgrades or overhauls.

&quot;Melbourne&quot;″s first major refit started in December 1967 and continued until February 1969, during which she was upgraded to operate S-2 Tracker and A-4 Skyhawk aircraft. The modifications cost A$8.5 million, and included an overhaul of the hull and machinery, strengthening of the flight deck, improvements to the catapult and arrestor cables, modification of the aviation fuel systems and flight control arrangements, and upgrades of the navigational aids and radar. Air conditioning systems and a liquid oxygen generation plant were also installed. &quot;Melbourne&quot; re-entered service at the conclusion of the refits on 14 February, and performed sea trials in Jervis Bay from 17 February until 5 May. This was the largest project undertaken by Garden Island Dockyard to that date.

The next major refit was required in 1971 for the scheduled rebuilding of the catapult, which was only possible after components were sourced from and . The flight deck was again reinforced and strengthened, and attempts were made to increase the effectiveness of the air conditioning system installed in 1969. &quot;Melbourne&quot; had been designed to operate in North Atlantic and Arctic climates, and the original ventilation systems were inappropriate for her primary operating climate, the tropics. The 1969 and 1971 refits did improve conditions, although there was little scope for upgrade, and the system was still inadequate: temperatures inside the ship continued to reach over , and on one occasion a hold reached . The refit took seven months to complete, and cost A$2 million.

More large-scale refits occurred throughout the rest of the 1970s. &quot;Melbourne&quot; was back in dock from November 1972 until August 1973, with further work done to her catapult. The next major refit ran from April 1975 to June 1976, and was intended to increase the operational lifespan of the carrier to at least 1985. The refit was lengthened by industrial action at the dockyard. &quot;Melbourne&quot; underwent another refit from late 1978 until August 1979. A refit scheduled to begin in late 1981 was postponed in September until a decision regarding the new carrier was made, then cancelled in January 1982, after the announcement that the RAN would be acquiring HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;.

==Armament==
&quot;Melbourne&quot; carried a defensive armament of anti-aircraft guns and an air group comprising both attack and anti-submarine aircraft. As the ship was never directly involved in a conflict, her weapons and embarked aircraft did not fire a shot in anger.

===Weapons and systems===
&quot;Melbourne&quot;″s initial armament included 25 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns: six twin and thirteen single mountings. The radar suite consisted of three Type 277Q height-finding sets, a Type 293Q surface search set, and a Type 978 navigational set. Between entering service and 1959, four of the single Bofors were removed.

During the 1967–1969 refit, thirteen Bofors were removed, leaving four twin and four single mountings. The three 277Q radars were replaced with updated American and Dutch designs: a LW-02 air search set and a SPN-35 landing aid radar. A TACAN aerial and electronic countermeasures pods were also installed during this refit. The four Bofors twin mountings were removed in 1980.

===Aircraft===

&quot;Melbourne&quot; carried three Fleet Air Arm squadrons. Initially, she had up to 22 fixed wing and 2 rotary wing aircraft embarked at any time. The number of aircraft gradually increased until 1972, when the air group peaked at 27 aircraft. Approximately 350 Fleet Air Arm personnel were stationed aboard the carrier.

Initially, two types of fixed-wing aircraft were operated from &quot;Melbourne&quot;. de Havilland Sea Venom FAW.53 fighter aircraft were flown by 805 Squadron RAN and 808 Squadron RAN, while Fairey Gannet anti-submarine strike aircraft were operated by 816 Squadron RAN and 817 Squadron RAN. At the time of their arrival, the Sea Venoms were the only radar equipped and all-weather combat aircraft in the Southern Hemisphere. At &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s commissioning, the standard air group consisted of eight Sea Venoms and two squadrons of eight Gannets, with two Bristol Sycamore search-and-rescue helicopters added shortly after the carrier entered service.

These aircraft were due to become obsolete in the late 1950s, and the RAN considered purchasing modern aircraft of French or Italian design, which were better suited to light carrier operations than equivalent British aircraft, or replace &quot;Melbourne&quot; with a larger carrier. Instead of pursuing either alternative, the Australian government announced in 1959 that &quot;Melbourne&quot; would be reconfigured during her 1963 refit to operate as a helicopter carrier. The fixed-wing aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm were marked for replacement by 27 Westland Wessex anti-submarine helicopters. A reduction of embarked plane numbers to four Sea Venoms and six Gannets, along with regular rotation and careful use of the aircraft, extended their service life until the mid-1960s, while the size of the air group was maintained by carrying up to ten Wessex helicopters. The decision to retire the fixed-wing component of the Fleet Air Arm was rescinded in 1963, and on 10 November 1964, a AU£212 million increase in defence spending included the purchase of new aircraft for &quot;Melbourne&quot;.
The RAN planned to acquire 14 Grumman S-2E Tracker anti-submarine aircraft, and modernise &quot;Melbourne&quot; to operate the aircraft. The acquisition of 18 Douglas A-4 Skyhawk fighter-bombers was also suggested, but these were dropped from the initial plan. A separate proposal to order 10 A-4G Skyhawks, a variant of the Skyhawk designed specifically for the RAN and optimised for air defence, was approved in 1965. Both aircraft types entered RAN service in 1968, with the Trackers operated by 816 Squadron RAN and 851 Squadron RAN, and the Skyhawks by 805 Squadron RAN and 724 Squadron RAN. The aircraft did not fly from &quot;Melbourne&quot; until the conclusion of her refit in 1969. In 1969, the RAN purchased another ten A-4G Skyhawks, instead of the proposed seventh and eighth &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines. &quot;Melbourne&quot; operated a standard air group of four Skyhawks, six Trackers, and ten Wessex helicopters until 1972, when the Wessexes were replaced with ten Westland Sea King anti-submarine warfare helicopters and the number of Skyhawks doubled. Although replaced by the Sea King, up to three Wessex helicopters could be carried as search-and-rescue aircraft.

On 5 December 1976, a fire at the Naval Air Station destroyed or heavily damaged 12 of the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s 13 S-2E Trackers. The carrier was sent to the United States in 1977 to transport back 16 S-2G Tracker aircraft as replacements.

Over the course of her career, over thirty aircraft were either lost or heavily damaged while operating from &quot;Melbourne&quot;. The majority of the aircraft ditched or crashed over the side, but some losses were due to catapult or arrestor cable failures. After &quot;Melbourne&quot; was decommissioned, the Fleet Air Arm ceased fixed-wing combat aircraft operation in 1984, with the final Tracker flight saluting the decommissioned carrier.

==Role==

&quot;Melbourne&quot; was the third and final conventional aircraft carrier to operate with the RAN. Following the first decommissioning of sister ship in 1958, &quot;Melbourne&quot; became the only aircraft carrier in Australian service. &quot;Melbourne&quot; was unavailable to provide air cover for the RAN for up to four months in every year; this time was required for refits, refuelling, personnel leave, and non-carrier duties, such as the transportation of troops or aircraft. Although one of the largest ships to serve in the RAN, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was one of the smallest carriers to operate in the post-World War II period. A decision was made in 1959 to restrict &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s role to helicopter operations only, but was reversed shortly before its planned 1963 implementation.

As well as an operational aircraft carrier, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was Flagship of the RAN, a role she received almost immediately following her 1956 arrival in Australia, and fulfilled until her decommissioning in 1982. During her service, the carrier was deployed overseas on 35 occasions, visited over 22 countries, and was seen as the physical and psychological centrepiece of the RAN fleet.

As &quot;Melbourne&quot; was the only ship of her size (both in dimensions and ship&#x27;s company) in the RAN, the carrier underwent a regular rotation of commanding officers to give them experience. Commanding officers were changed on average every fifteen months, with few remaining on board for more than two years. The majority of &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s commanders later reached flag rank. The carrier was also called on to perform underway replenishments and command and control functions.

==Operational history==
===1955–1964===
Following a working-up period in British waters, &quot;Melbourne&quot; departed Glasgow on 11 March 1956 on her maiden voyage to Australia via the Suez Canal. Aboard were the 64 aircraft of RAN squadrons 808, 816, and 817, as well as the racing yacht &quot;Samuel Pepys&quot; (named after the English naval administrator and diarist), which was a gift to the RAN Sailing Association from the Royal Navy. The ship visited Gibraltar, Naples, Malta, Port Said, Aden, and Colombo, before arriving in Fremantle on 24 April 1956. &quot;Melbourne&quot; sailed east via the Great Australian Bight, meeting sister ship near Kangaroo Island a week later. After visiting Melbourne and Jervis Bay, where the aircraft were offloaded and sent to Naval Air Station , the carrier concluded her maiden voyage in Sydney on 10 May. The role of flagship was transferred from &quot;Sydney&quot; to &quot;Melbourne&quot; three days later. The carrier immediately underwent a two and a half-month refit, allowing for the inspection of machinery and repair of defects detected during the maiden voyage. &quot;Melbourne&quot; spent from September to November in Southeast Asian waters, during which she participated in Exercise Albatross and received an official visit by Philippines president Ramon Magsaysay. On return to Australia in mid-November, the carrier visited Melbourne for the 1956 Olympics, where 200 of &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s complement were provided to work as signallers, event marshals, carpenters, and medical workers.

In February 1957, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was sent to the Royal Hobart Regatta. Following this, she travelled to New Zealand, where she participated in exercises with HMNZS &quot;Royalist&quot; and visited several New Zealand ports. The first of several annual three-month deployments to Southeast Asia as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve began in April, with &quot;Melbourne&quot; returning to Darwin at the end of June. The carrier spent the rest of the year visiting Australian ports for open inspections by the public. During the visit to Port Adelaide, on 28 October 1957, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was slightly damaged when she was struck by MV &quot;Straat Lanka&quot;—the first of several minor collisions the carrier would experience throughout her career. Operations for the year concluded with participation in Exercise Astrolabe off Lord Howe Island, with ships from the RAN, Royal Navy, and Royal New Zealand Navy, before returning to Sydney on 13 December.
From February until July 1958, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was deployed on a flag-showing cruise. During this cruise the carrier participated in four inter-fleet exercises and visited Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Japan, Pearl Harbor and Fiji. On return to Sydney, &quot;Melbourne&quot; entered a short refit, which concluded on 13 October and was immediately followed by a visit to Port Phillip, where the carrier was displayed to Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force officer cadets before the carrier returned to Sydney. At the start of 1959, &quot;Melbourne&quot; spent four days in her namesake city, where she was used for the filming of &quot;On The Beach&quot;, based on Nevil Shute&#x27;s post-apocalyptic novel of the same name. After filming concluded, the carrier participated in a demonstration exercise off the coast of Sydney before embarking on a Far East Strategic Reserve deployment from March until May. The rest of the year was spent visiting Australian and New Zealand ports.

The following year, 1960, was a bad year for the carrier&#x27;s air group, with four Sea Venoms and two Gannets damaged in separate incidents aboard &quot;Melbourne&quot;. All four Sea Venom incidents occurred in March, with three attributed to aircrew error and one to brake failure. The year began with exercises en route to Adelaide, followed by a visit to the Royal Hobart Regatta. The carrier&#x27;s Strategic Reserve deployment ran from April to June, and was followed by manoeuvres along the east coast of Australia until September. In the lead up to &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s 1961 deployment to the Strategic Reserve, the carrier visited Bombay, Karachi, and Trincomalee. It was the first time a flagship of the RAN had entered Indian waters. &quot;Melbourne&quot; returned to Australia in June, and on 15 June led several ships in a ceremonial entry to Sydney Harbour to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the RAN. In August, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was called upon to lead Exercise Tuckerbox, in the Coral Sea. Following the conclusion of Tuckerbox, the carrier visited several New Zealand ports before returning to Sydney for demonstration exercises and public relations activities.

In 1962, &quot;Melbourne&quot; began the year&#x27;s activities at the Royal Hobart Regatta, before sailing to her Strategic Reserve deployment, by way of Adelaide and Fremantle. After Strategic Reserve duties were completed, the carrier visited Japan, Guam, and Manus Island before returning to Sydney in late July. In September, &quot;Melbourne&quot; reprised her role as the leader of Exercise Tuckerbox II. The 10,000th catapult launch from &quot;Melbourne&quot; occurred in late 1962. The carrier&#x27;s annual refit began in Sydney on 1 October. At the beginning of 1963, &quot;Melbourne&quot; again visited to the Royal Hobart Regatta, which was immediately followed by a deployment to the Strategic Reserve, including involvement in SEATO Exercise Sea Serpent. The 20,000th landing on &quot;Melbourne&quot; was performed in April by a Gannet, and in September, &quot;Melbourne&quot; participated in Exercise Carbine near Hervey Bay, Queensland.

===&quot;Voyager&quot; collision===

On 10 February 1964, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was performing trials in Jervis Bay under the command of Captain John Robertson, following the annual refit. The &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyer was also present, undergoing her own trials following refit, under the command of Captain Duncan Stevens. The trials involved interactions between both ships, and when &quot;Melbourne&quot; performed night-flying exercises that evening, &quot;Voyager&quot; acted as the carrier&#x27;s plane guard escort. This required &quot;Voyager&quot; to maintain a position 20° off &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s port quarter at a distance from the carrier of .
Early in the evening, &quot;Voyager&quot; had no difficulties maintaining her position during the manoeuvres both ships performed. Following a series of turns intended to reverse the courses of both ships beginning at 8:40 pm, &quot;Voyager&quot; ended up to starboard of &quot;Melbourne&quot;. At 8:52 pm, &quot;Voyager&quot; was ordered to resume the plane guard station. The procedure to accomplish this required &quot;Voyager&quot; to turn away from &quot;Melbourne&quot; in a large circle, cross behind the carrier, then take position off &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s port side. Instead, &quot;Voyager&quot; first turned to starboard, away from &quot;Melbourne&quot;, then turned to port without warning. It was initially assumed by &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s bridge crew that &quot;Voyager&quot; was conducting a series of tight turns to lose speed before swinging behind &quot;Melbourne&quot;, but &quot;Voyager&quot; did not alter course again. At 8:55 pm, with &quot;Voyager&quot; approaching, &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s navigator ordered the carrier&#x27;s engines to half astern speed, with Robertson ordering an increase to full astern a few seconds later. At the same time, Stevens, having just become aware of the situation, gave the order &quot;Full ahead both engines. Hard-a starboard.&quot;, before instructing the destroyer&#x27;s Quartermaster to announce that a collision was imminent. Both ships&#x27; measures were too late to avoid a collision; &quot;Melbourne&quot; hit &quot;Voyager&quot; at 8:56 pm.

&quot;Melbourne&quot; struck &quot;Voyager&quot; just aft of the destroyer&#x27;s bridge, rolling the destroyer to starboard before cutting her in half. &quot;Voyager&quot;″s forward boiler exploded, briefly setting fire to the bow of the carrier before it was extinguished by seawater. The destroyer&#x27;s forward section sank quickly, under the weight of the two gun turrets. The aft section did not begin sinking until half an hour after the collision, completely submerging just after midnight. Messages were immediately sent to the Fleet Headquarters in Sydney, although staff in Sydney initially underestimated the extent of the damage to &quot;Voyager&quot;. &quot;Melbourne&quot; launched her boats to recover survivors, and the carrier&#x27;s wardroom and C Hangar were prepared for casualties. At 9:58 pm, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was informed that search-and-rescue boats from , helicopters from , and five &quot;Ton&quot;-class minesweepers had been despatched to assist in the search.
&quot;Melbourne&quot; arrived in Sydney with the survivors on 14 February, and after spending time alongside at Garden Island, was moved to Cockatoo Island Dockyard on 25 March, where repairs were undertaken; the damaged section of the bow was cut away and repairs to the ship&#x27;s internal structure were undertaken in drydock, while a 40-ton prefabricated bow was constructed. Once this was completed, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was removed while the new bow was put in place in the drydock. The work was completed on 27 April, with the shipyard receiving a commendation.

Of the 314 personnel aboard &quot;Voyager&quot; at the time of the collision, 14 officers, 67 sailors, and 1 civilian dockyard worker were killed, including Stevens and all but two of the bridge team. A Royal Commission into the events of the collision was held in 1964, and found that while &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s crew was primarily at fault for neglecting to maintain an effective lookout and awareness of the larger ship&#x27;s location, &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s bridge crew was also at fault, for failing to alert &quot;Voyager&quot; and not taking measures to avoid the collision. Robertson was posted to the training base —a move that he and the Australian media saw as tantamount to a demotion—but resigned instead. The Royal Commission and its aftermath were poorly handled, and following pressure from the public, media, and politicians, combined with revelations by &quot;Voyager&quot;″s former executive officer that Stevens may have been unfit for command, a second Royal Commission was opened in 1967. This is the only time in Australian history two Royal Commissions have been held for a single incident. The second commission found that Stevens was medically unfit for command and that some of the findings of the first Royal Commission were therefore based on incorrect assumptions. Robertson and the other officers of &quot;Melbourne&quot; were absolved of blame for the incident.

===1964–1969===
&quot;Melbourne&quot; spent ten weeks at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, having her new bow fitted. Following the repairs, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was involved in Strategic Reserve deployments and exercises in Southeast Asia from June until September 1964. During this deployment, the carrier visited Subic Bay, where the RAN performed flight deck trials with S-2 Tracker anti-submarine aircraft and A-4 Skyhawk attack fighters. The success of the trials, along with the discovery that &quot;Melbourne&quot; was able to operate both aircraft with relatively minor modification, led the Australian Government to approve the purchase of these aircraft.
From March 1965 until mid-1967, &quot;Melbourne&quot; underwent a regular pattern of deployments to Southeast Asia, exercises, and flag-showing visits to nations in the Asia-Pacific region. Several of the Southeast Asian deployments were related to the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, and involved participation in show of force exercises off the coast of Malaysia. During 1965 and 1966, &quot;Melbourne&quot; escorted sister ship , which had been recommissioned as a troop transport, for short periods during the latter&#x27;s first, third, and fourth transport voyages to Vietnam. Despite the carrier being the centrepiece of several plans to involve Australian forces in the Vietnam War, the escort runs were the extent of &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s participation in the conflict, and the carrier remained outside the Market Time area while &quot;Sydney&quot; and her other escorts proceeded to Vũng Tàu. As the carrier was optimised for anti-submarine warfare, there was little need for her at the start of the war. Utilising the carrier was suggested again by RAN officials in March 1966, when the United States Seventh Fleet was having difficulties maintaining anti-submarine patrols around Yankee Station, but &quot;Melbourne&quot; could only remain on station for a single, ten-day period, a third of the time that US carriers were operational for on rotating deployments. Seventh Fleet staff suggested in April 1967 that &quot;Melbourne&quot; deploy in the anti-submarine role, but nothing came of these talks. Consideration was also given to using &quot;Melbourne&quot; as a floating helicopter base, but only ten Wessex helicopters could be provided, and modifications were required for them to operate as troop carriers. Both options were made more prohibitive by the need to supply at least two escorts for the carrier at a time when the RAN was having difficulty meeting deployment commitments with the available destroyers and destroyer escorts.

In September 1967, &quot;Melbourne&quot; travelled to the United States to collect new aircraft: 14 Trackers and 10 Skyhawks. To operate the new aircraft, the carrier received a major refit on her return to Sydney, which began in December 1967. In May 1967, it was proposed that while &quot;Melbourne&quot; was out of service, A-4 Skyhawk pilots and maintenance personnel could be attached to a United States Marine Corps Skyhawk squadron in South Vietnam. Australian aircraft were not to be provided, as the A-4G Skyhawks used by the RAN were optimised for air defence, not the fighter-bomber role performed by the Marines, and would have suffered heavy losses from North Vietnam&#x27;s heavy anti-aircraft defences. This deployment did not occur; the Skyhawk pilot training program was experiencing delays because US squadrons were being shipped training equipment and replacement parts in priority to the RAN, and sending qualified pilots overseas would have caused further holdups with the program, while also disrupting &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s post-refit reactivation. &quot;Melbourne&quot; re-entered service at the conclusion of the refit on 14 February 1969. She performed sea trials in Jervis Bay from 17 February until 5 May, then sailed for Subic Bay, Philippines, to participate in SEATO Exercise Sea Spirit.

===&quot;Frank E. Evans&quot; collision===

&quot;Melbourne&quot;″s commanding officer during the SEATO exercise was Captain John Phillip Stevenson. Rear Admiral John Crabb, the Flag Officer Commanding Australian Fleet, was also embarked on the carrier. During Sea Spirit, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was assigned five escorts: US Ships , , and , HMNZS &quot;Blackpool&quot;, and . Stevenson held a dinner for the five escort captains at the start of the exercise, during which he recounted the events of the &quot;Melbourne&quot;–&quot;Voyager&quot; collision, emphasised the need for caution when operating near the carrier, and provided written instructions on how to avoid such a situation developing again. Additionally, during the lead up to the exercise, Admiral Crabb had strongly warned that all repositioning manoeuvres performed by the escorts had to commence with a turn away from &quot;Melbourne&quot;. Despite these warnings, a near-miss occurred in the early hours of 31 May when &quot;Larson&quot; turned towards the carrier after being ordered to the plane guard station. Subsequent action narrowly prevented a collision. The escorts were again warned about the dangers of operating near the carrier and informed of Stevenson&#x27;s expectations, while the minimum distance between carrier and escorts was increased from .
On the night of 2–3 June 1969, &quot;Melbourne&quot; and her escorts were involved in anti-submarine training exercises in the South China Sea. In preparation for launching a Tracker, Stevenson ordered &quot;Evans&quot; to the plane guard station, reminded the destroyer of &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s course, and instructed the carrier&#x27;s navigational lights to be brought to full brilliance. &quot;Evans&quot; had performed the manoeuvre four times over the course of the night. &quot;Evans&quot; was positioned on &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s port bow, but began the manoeuvre by turning starboard, towards the carrier. A radio message was sent from &quot;Melbourne&quot; to &quot;Evans&quot;″ bridge and Combat Information Centre, warning the destroyer that she was on a collision course, which &quot;Evans&quot; acknowledged. Seeing the destroyer take no action and on a course to place herself under &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s bow, Stevenson ordered the carrier hard to port, signalling the turn by both radio and siren blasts. At approximately the same time, &quot;Evans&quot; turned hard to starboard to avoid the approaching carrier. It is uncertain which ship began to manoeuvre first, but each ship&#x27;s bridge crew claimed that they were informed of the other ship&#x27;s turn after they commenced their own. After having narrowly passed in front of &quot;Melbourne&quot;, the turns quickly placed &quot;Evans&quot; back in the carrier&#x27;s path. &quot;Melbourne&quot; hit &quot;Evans&quot; amidships at 3:15 am, cutting the destroyer in two.

Seventy-four of the 273 personnel from &quot;Evans&quot; were killed in the collision, with the majority of these believed to have been asleep or trapped inside the bow section, which sank within minutes. &quot;Melbourne&quot; deployed her boats, life rafts, and lifebuoys, before carefully manoeuvring alongside the stern section of &quot;Evans&quot;, where both ships&#x27; crews used mooring lines to lash the ships together. Sailors from &quot;Melbourne&quot; dived from the flight deck into the water to rescue overboard survivors close to the carrier, while the carrier&#x27;s boats and helicopters collected those farther out. All of the survivors were located within 12 minutes of the collision and rescued before half an hour had passed, although the search continued for fifteen more hours. After &quot;Evans&quot;″ stern was evacuated, it was cast off, while the carrier moved away to avoid damage. The stern did not sink, and was later recovered, stripped of parts, and sunk for target practice.
Following the collision, &quot;Melbourne&quot; travelled to Singapore for temporary repairs to her bow, arriving on 6 June. &quot;Melbourne&quot; departed Singapore on 27 June and arrived in Sydney on 9 July, where the carrier underwent almost identical repairs at Cockatoo Island Dockyard as in 1964 (primarily the installation of a new bow section). However, an industrial dispute amongst the shipyard workers meant that, although the work was completed in early September, the ship remained in the drydock until 11 October.

A Joint RAN-USN board of inquiry was established to investigate the incident, and was in session over June and July 1969. The board found &quot;Evans&quot; partially at fault for the collision, but also faulted &quot;Melbourne&quot; for not taking evasive action sooner, even though international sea regulations dictated that in the lead-up to a collision, the larger ship was required to maintain course and speed. It was learned during the inquiry that &quot;Evans&quot;″ commanding officer was asleep in his quarters at the time of the incident, and charge of the vessel was held by Lieutenants Ronald Ramsey and James Hopson; the former had failed the qualification exam to stand watch, while the latter was at sea for the first time. Subsequent to the inquiry, the three USN officers and Stevenson were court-martialled by their respective navies on charges of negligence, with the three USN officers found guilty and Stevenson &#x27;Honourably Acquitted&#x27;. Despite the findings, Stevenson&#x27;s next posting was as a minor flag officer&#x27;s chief of staff, seen by him as a demotion in all but name. In a repetition of the aftermath of the &quot;Voyager&quot; collision, &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s captain resigned amid accusations of scapegoating. In December 2012, Stevenson announced that he had received a letter from the Minister for Defence, apologising for his treatment by the RAN and the government of the day.

===1970–1976===

During the 1970s and early 1980s, replacing parts became an increasing problem. Components were failing due to wear and age, but the companies responsible for manufacturing the parts had gone out of business during the previous twenty years, sometimes immediately after World War II ended. The carrier&#x27;s engineers often resorted to making replacements from scratch. The ship&#x27;s catapult was replaced with parts from the decommissioned HMCS Bonaventure in 1970.

In 1970, &quot;Melbourne&quot; participated in three major inter-navy exercises: Sea Rover with SEATO forces in the South China Sea, Bersatu Padu with British Commonwealth forces off Malaysia, and Swan Lake with the Royal Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy off Western Australia. During this year, the carrier also visited Japan to participate in Expo &#x27;70, and was hit by Manly ferry &quot;South Steyne&quot; while alongside at Garden Island, causing minor damage to both vessels. &quot;Melbourne&quot; was out of service for most of 1971 while she underwent refits, which concluded in early August. In mid-1971, the Australian military&#x27;s Joint Planning Committee considered using &quot;Melbourne&quot; as a transport to help complete the withdrawal of the Australian Task Force from Vietnam before the end of 1971. While the Army supported this proposal, the Navy successfully argued against its implementation, claiming that transporting troops and cargo would be misusing Australia&#x27;s only active aircraft carrier, and would prevent &quot;Melbourne&quot; from participating in several major multi-national exercises. The refit concluded in late 1971, with the carrier participating in the first RIMPAC exercise, RIMPAC 71, before the end of the year.

Operations in 1972 commenced with a three-month deployment to Southeast Asia. During this deployment, &quot;Melbourne&quot; led a fleet of 17 ships from the RAN, Royal Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy, US Navy, Philippine Navy, and Royal Thai Navy in Exercise Sea Hawk. This was followed by goodwill visits to numerous Southeast Asian ports, including Hong Kong, Jakarta, Manila, Singapore, and Surabaya, before &quot;Melbourne&quot; returned to Sydney at the end of April. The carrier spent May performing exercises off the New South Wales coast, during which she was called on to rescue three fisherman who had been stranded at sea for the previous two days. In August, &quot;Melbourne&quot; sailed for Hawaii to participate in RIMPAC 72. At the conclusion of this exercise, &quot;Melbourne&quot; proceeded to Japan on a diplomatic visit, then sailed to the Philippines to exercise with SEATO ships. During this deployment, a fire ignited inside the ship&#x27;s main switchboard. The carrier returned to Australia on 27 November after 101 days at sea, and underwent a seven-month refit. On 24 August 1973, &quot;Melbourne&quot; returned to Hawaii to participate in RIMPAC 73. She returned to Australia on 12 October, but sailed out ten days later to participate in Exercise Leadline off Malaysia, before reaching Sydney again in December.
&quot;Melbourne&quot; began 1974 by transporting 120 Australian soldiers to a temporary assignment with an American infantry battalion based in Hawaii. She then sailed to San Francisco to collect 12 new Chinook and five UH-1 Iroquois helicopters for the Royal Australian Air Force, arriving in Australia with her cargo in April. In June, the carrier took part in Exercise Kangaroo in the Coral Sea, before returning to Sydney in July. On 11 July, the passenger liner SS &quot;Australis&quot; hit and damaged &quot;Melbourne&quot; in Sydney Harbour. In November, the carrier took part in disaster relief exercises. These were prophetic, as on the night of 24–25 December 1974, Cyclone Tracy destroyed the city of Darwin. &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s ship&#x27;s company was recalled immediately from leave, the ship was loaded with supplies, and the carrier departed Sydney on 26 December in the company of . &quot;Melbourne&quot;, &quot;Brisbane&quot;, and eleven other ships were deployed as part of the largest peacetime rescue effort ever organised by the RAN: Operation Navy Help Darwin. &quot;Melbourne&quot; remained off Darwin until 18 January 1975, acting as operational headquarters and a helicopter base. During this operation, the seven Wessex helicopters embarked on &quot;Melbourne&quot; performed 2,493 flights, carrying 7,824 passengers and 107 tons of cargo.

Following Navy Help Darwin, &quot;Melbourne&quot; participated in RIMPAC 75, then returned to Sydney for a fourteen-month refit, which was delayed by industrial action at the dockyard. While moored in Sydney Harbour, on 24 July, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was struck by Japanese cargo ship &quot;Blue Andromeda&quot;. While working up following the refit, &quot;Melbourne&quot; and provided assistance to MV &quot;Miss Chief&quot; off the coast of Bundaberg, Queensland on 16 August 1976. In October, &quot;Melbourne&quot; participated in Exercise Kangaroo II, before sailing to her namesake city for the carrier&#x27;s 21st birthday celebrations, then returning to Sydney on 5 November.

===1976–1983===

On 5 December 1976, a fire deliberately lit at by a member of the Fleet Air Arm damaged or destroyed all but one of Australia&#x27;s S-2 Trackers. Following participation in RIMPAC 77, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was sent to San Diego to collect replacement aircraft. Arriving back in Sydney on 5 April, the carrier was sent on a five-month deployment to the United Kingdom on 28 April, accompanied by and . En route, &quot;Melbourne&quot; lost a Sea King in the Indian Ocean on 9 May, with the aircrew recovered by &quot;Brisbane&quot;. A Tracker from &quot;Melbourne&quot; located the disabled Dutch vessel &quot;Impala Princess&quot; in the Gulf of Aden on 25 May and directed a French destroyer to assist. Two Bofors naval guns were deposited by &quot;Melbourne&quot; at Souda Bay, Crete on 2 June, marking the first visit of an Australian warship to Crete since June 1941. These weapons were donated to the Australian War Memorial at Stavromenos, in Crete&#x27;s Rethymno regional unit. The highlight of the deployment saw the three ships represent Australia and New Zealand at the Silver Jubilee Naval Review on 28 June 1977. A two-seat Harrier jump jet demonstrator undertook a series of trial takeoffs and landings aboard &quot;Melbourne&quot; on 30 June: a trial organised as part of the project overseeing the ship&#x27;s potential replacement. Following the Jubilee Review and participation in Exercise Highwood in July, &quot;Melbourne&quot; and her escorts returned to Australia, arriving in Fremantle on 19 September and Sydney on 4 October. &quot;Melbourne&quot; was docked in Garden Island&#x27;s drydock on arrival, where she remained until January 1978.
At the end of March 1978, &quot;Melbourne&quot; left Sydney for RIMPAC 78. During this exercise, &quot;Melbourne&quot; acquired the nickname &#x27;Little M&#x27; after working with &#x27;Big E&#x27; —the smallest and largest aircraft carriers (respectively) in operation at the time. On return in July, the carrier entered a major refit, which continued until 3 August 1979. During this refit, on 3 March, a boiler explosion caused minor damage to the carrier. The remainder of the year involved participation in three exercises, Tasmanex off Wellington, New Zealand, Sea Eagle I in the Tasman Sea, and Kangaroo III in the Coral Sea. During Tasmanex, &quot;Melbourne&quot; lost her LW-02 radar aerial and a Skyhawk (N13-154907), both of which fell overboard during heavy seas.

During February and March 1980, &quot;Melbourne&quot; participated in RIMPAC 80, as the flagship of Battle Group Two. This was immediately followed by a visit to the Solomon Islands in early April. The carrier was in Sydney from mid-April until mid-August, during which the 25th anniversary of &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s service in the RAN was celebrated on 15 August with a cocktail party aboard the carrier, popularly referred to as &#x27;The Night of the Admirals&#x27;. On 18 August, &quot;Melbourne&quot; sailed for Fremantle to participate in Exercise Sandgroper 80. On 8 September, &quot;Melbourne&quot;, accompanied by , , , , and deployed to the Indian Ocean as the Australian Squadron for a flag-showing cruise. During this cruise two Skyhawks were lost: on 2 and 21 October. On 24 October, a Tracker from &quot;Melbourne&quot; observed Soviet warships &quot;Storozhevoy&quot; and &quot;Ivan Rogov&quot; shadowing the squadron. The squadron&#x27;s return in November 1980 concluded the largest and longest RAN deployment since World War II.

Following her return, the carrier spent six months in Australian waters, before a two-month deployment to Southeast Asia. During this deployment, on 21 June 1981, &quot;Melbourne&quot; rescued 99 Vietnamese refugees from a disabled fishing vessel in the South China Sea. The carrier&#x27;s deployments for the second half of the year consisted of two exercises, Sea Hawk and Kangaroo 81. A major refit scheduled to begin in late 1981 was postponed pending the decision on a replacement carrier. After docking at Garden Island in December, the carrier was accidentally flooded by an officer who was impatient to commence leave. In his haste to shut down the carrier, he failed to deactivate the water pumps, and over 180 tons of fresh water were pumped in before a maintenance party discovered the flooding the next day. &quot;Melbourne&quot; remained in dock at the start of 1982, and did not leave before the decision regarding her replacement was made.

==Replacement==


A replacement for &quot;Melbourne&quot; was under consideration as early as 1956, and the question was revisited on several occasions until the 1980s. In every situation, a new aircraft carrier was turned down due to the increases in manpower and operating costs required to operate the ship when compared to &quot;Melbourne&quot;.

Between 1956 and 1959, the RAN considered acquiring a larger carrier to replace &quot;Melbourne&quot;, as the Fleet Air Arm was becoming obsolete and the RAN did not believe the ship could be modified to operate newer, heavier aircraft. Under consideration were British carrier and a ship of the United States&#x27; &quot;Essex&quot; class. Both options were turned down, and it was instead proposed to operate &quot;Melbourne&quot; as a helicopter carrier.

In 1960, the United States Navy offered an &quot;Essex&quot;-class carrier to the Australian government, in the interest of improving relations between the two nations and their navies. The only cost to the RAN would have been the modifications required to make the carrier operationally compatible with the RAN&#x27;s primarily British-designed fleet. In the late 1960s, the British made a similar offer, following a 1966 review indicating that was a superfluous naval unit. In 1968, &quot;Hermes&quot; took part in a combined exercise with the RAN, during which the carrier was visited by RAN and Australian government officials, while RAN Skyhawks and Trackers practised landings on the larger carrier. Both offers were turned down due to operating and manpower costs.

The need to secure a replacement for &quot;Melbourne&quot; grew as the carrier&#x27;s age caused the operating costs to increase to over A$25 million per year. In June 1977, the Defence Force Development Committee approved an investigation into acquiring a STOVL/helicopter carrier. By August 1979, the decision was limited to three ships: a modified American &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;-class amphibious assault ship, an Italian &quot;Giuseppe Garibaldi&quot;-class carrier, and a Sea Control Ship design that later became the Spanish Navy&#x27;s &quot;Principe de Asturias&quot;. By February 1981, the &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; class was the preferred option.

===HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;===

Plans to replace &quot;Melbourne&quot; changed in July 1981; the British 1981 Defence White Paper had marked the recently commissioned as surplus to requirements, and she was offered to the RAN for the &#x27;bargain&#x27; price of GB£175 million (A$285 million). The &quot;Invincible&quot; class had been considered and discarded during the investigation, but the decreased price and the fact the already-constructed carrier would be ready for RAN service in 1983 prompted the Australian government to announce its intention to purchase &quot;Invincible&quot; on 25 February 1982 and close the carrier acquisition program. The government also announced that the ship would be renamed and operated as a helicopter carrier, and that a decision on the purchase of fixed wing aircraft would be made after acquisition.

The deal was put on hold in April 1982, following the outbreak of the Falklands War. The performance of &quot;Invincible&quot; and other Royal Navy aircraft carriers during the conflict showed that the report which suggested reductions in the size of Britain&#x27;s carrier fleet—with the follow-on effect of making &quot;Invincible&quot; available for sale—was flawed, and both sides withdrew from the deal in July. The RAN was again offered HMS &quot;Hermes&quot;, and again declined due to the carrier&#x27;s age and manpower requirements. The Australian government began to reconsider the previous contenders for replacement, as well as considering requesting the United Kingdom or United States to build a simple carrier capable of operating F/A-18 Hornet strike fighters, but the issue was suspended at the commencement of the 1983 Australian Federal Election. On 14 March, following the election of Bob Hawke&#x27;s Labor Government, the announcement was made that &quot;Melbourne&quot; would not be replaced.

==Decommissioning and fate==
Following the decision to replace &quot;Melbourne&quot; with HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;, the postponed refit was cancelled outright. The Australian carrier was prepared for disposal, and was decommissioned and placed in reserve on 30 June 1982. She was towed to the mooring dolphins near Bradley&#x27;s Head, where she remained until 1985. &quot;Melbourne&quot; was capable of being reactivated as a helicopter-equipped anti-submarine warfare carrier within 26 weeks, but was never required to do so. A Sydney-based group proposed in 1984 to purchase &quot;Melbourne&quot; and operate her as a floating casino moored in international waters off Eden, New South Wales, but nothing came of this. &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s air wing was disbanded at HMAS &quot;Albatross&quot; on 2 July 1982, with the transfer of 805 Squadron&#x27;s Skyhawks to 724 Squadron and 816 Squadron being absorbed into 851 Squadron. The Skyhawks remained in service as fleet support aircraft until 30 June 1984, while the Trackers were withdrawn from service on 31 August 1984 after being used as land-based maritime patrol aircraft.

The carrier was initially sold for breaking up as scrap metal for A$1.7 million, although the sale fell through in June 1984. She was sold again in February 1985 to the China United Shipbuilding Company for A$1.4 million, with the intention that she be towed to China and broken up for scrap. Prior to the ship&#x27;s departure for China, the RAN stripped &quot;Melbourne&quot; of all electronic equipment and weapons, and welded her rudders into a fixed position so that she could not be reactivated. Her steam catapult, arresting equipment and mirror landing system were not removed. At this time, few western experts expected that the Chinese government would attempt to develop aircraft carriers in the future. The carrier departed Sydney on 27 April 1985, heading for Guangzhou, under the tow of tug &quot;De Ping&quot;. The journey was delayed when the towing line began to part, requiring the carrier and tug to shelter in Queensland&#x27;s Moreton Bay, on 30 April. The towing gear broke a day later, requiring a second tug to secure the carrier while repairs were made to &quot;De Ping&quot;. Three days later, &quot;Melbourne&quot; ran aground while still in Moreton Bay. &quot;Melbourne&quot; arrived in China on 13 June. The Australian government received a Telex on this day, reading: 
The ship was not scrapped immediately; instead she was studied by Chinese naval architects and engineers as part of the nation&#x27;s top-secret carrier development program. It is unclear whether the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) orchestrated the acquisition of &quot;Melbourne&quot; or simply took advantage of the situation; Rear Admiral Zhang Zhaozhong, a staff member at the National Defence College, has stated that the Navy was unaware of the purchase until &quot;Melbourne&quot; first arrived at Guangzhou. &quot;Melbourne&quot; was the largest warship any of the Chinese experts had seen, and they were surprised by the amount of equipment which was still in place. The PLAN subsequently arranged for the ship&#x27;s flight deck and all the equipment associated with flying operations to be removed so that they could be studied in depth. Reports have circulated that either a replica of the flight deck, or the deck itself, was used for clandestine training of PLANAF pilots in carrier flight operations. It has also been claimed that the Royal Australian Navy received and &quot;politely rejected&quot; a request from the PLAN for blueprints of the ship&#x27;s steam catapult. The carrier was not dismantled for many years; according to some rumours she was not completely broken up until 2002. A 2012 article in &quot;Jane&#x27;s Navy International&quot; stated that the large quantity of equipment recovered from &quot;Melbourne&quot; &quot;undoubtedly helped&quot; Admiral Liu Huaqing secure the Chinese government&#x27;s support for his proposal to initiate an aircraft carrier development programme.

&quot;Melbourne&quot;″s service is commemorated with a stained-glass window at the Garden Island Naval Chapel. One of the ship&#x27;s anchors is incorporated into a memorial to naval aviation at Nowra, New South Wales. Another anchor and the starboard side ship&#x27;s bell are on display at the RAN Heritage Centre at Garden Island. Memorabilia from &quot;Melbourne&quot;&#x27;s voyages with the Fleet Air Arm embarked, and examples of all the types of aircraft deployed on &quot;Melbourne&quot;, are on permanent static display in the Fleet Air Arm Museum at HMAS &quot;Albatross&quot;.

Following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system completed in 2010, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was retroactively awarded the honour &quot;Malaysia 1965–66&quot; for her service during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation.

<text>The 1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier, commonly referred to as the British Light Fleet Carrier, was a light aircraft carrier design created by the Royal Navy during the Second World War, and used by eight naval forces between 1944 and 2001. They were designed and constructed by civilian shipyards to serve as an intermediate step between the expensive, full-size fleet aircraft carriers and the less expensive but limited-capability escort carriers.

Sixteen Light Fleet carriers were ordered, and all were laid down to the Colossus&quot; classdesign during 1942 and 1943. However, only eight were completed to this design; of these, four entered service before the end of the war, and none saw front line operations. Two more were fitted with maintenance and repair facilities instead of [[aircraft catapult]]s and [[arresting gear]], and entered service as aircraft maintenance carriers. The final six were modified during construction to handle larger and faster aircraft, and were re-designated as the Majestic&quot; class. The construction of the six ships was suspended at the end of the war. Five were eventually completed with the last commissioning in 1961; however, the sixth, &quot;Leviathan&quot;, was dismantled for spare parts and scrap.

Although not completed in time to fight in the war, the carriers in Royal Navy service participated in the Korean War and the Suez Crisis. During the latter, two &quot;Colossus&quot;-class ships performed the first ship-based helicopter assault in history. Four &quot;Colossus&quot;es and all five completed &quot;Majestic&quot;s were loaned or sold to seven foreign nations – Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, India, and the Netherlands – with three ships serving in three different naval forces during their careers. Foreign-operated Light Fleets took part in the Korean War, the First Indochina War, the Vietnam War, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, and the Falklands War.

Despite being intended as &#x27;disposable warships&#x27;, all of the completed Light Fleet carriers exceeded their planned three-year service life. The maintenance carriers were the first to be paid off in the 1950s, and by the 1960s, all of the Royal Navy carriers, (bar , which was later recommissioned as a repair ship) had been sold to other nations or for ship breaking. The carriers in other navies had longer service lives. At the time of her decommissioning in 2001, &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; was the oldest active aircraft carrier in the world. Despite attempts to preserve several of these carriers as museum ships, the last surviving example, , was sold for scrapping in 2014.

==Design and construction==
Experiences during the early part of the Second World War had demonstrated to the British that the Royal Navy needed access to defensive air cover for Allied fleets and convoys, which could only be provided by more aircraft carriers. In mid-1941, the Director of Naval Construction was instructed to investigate how best to achieve this without the lengthy construction times normally associated with carriers. The options were to refit the surviving &quot;Hawkins&quot;-class cruisers with flight decks and aviation facilities, convert additional merchant vessels and passenger liners into vessels similar to but more capable than previous merchant aircraft carriers, or create a new design for a cheap, lightly armed, and unarmoured ship similar to the American escort carriers. In December 1941, it was decided that a new design was the best option.

This ship was conceived as an intermediate step between the expensive fleet carriers and the limited-capability escort carriers. The design had to be as simple as possible so construction time was kept to a minimum and so more shipyards (particularly those with no naval construction experience) could be used. However, the ships had to be capable of operating in fleet actions. Originally designated the &#x27;Intermediate Aircraft Carrier&#x27;, the ships were reclassified as &#x27;Light Fleet Carriers&#x27;. Because naval design staff were overworked, the carrier was primarily designed by shipbuilders at Vickers-Armstrong.

The Light Fleet design, completed at the start of 1942, was effectively a scaled-down &quot;Illustrious&quot;. Each carrier would displace 13,190 tons at standard load and 18,040 tons at full load, have a length of at the flight deck and overall, a maximum beam of , and a draught of at standard displacement, and at full load displacement. The hull was built to Lloyd&#x27;s specifications for merchant vessels from keel to maindeck, but incorporated better subdivision of compartments to reduce secondary damage by flooding.

The propulsion machinery was of a similar design to that used in cruisers—some of the steam turbines were sourced from cancelled cruisers. The machinery was arranged in two compartments (each containing two Admiralty 3-drum boilers and a Parsons geared turbine), which were staggered &quot;en echelon&quot;, with the starboard compartment forward of the port. These provided 40,000 shaft horsepower to two propeller shafts, driving the carriers at a maximum speed of , with as the designated economical speed.

The carriers were intended to be &#x27;disposable warships&#x27;: to be scrapped and replaced at the end of the war or within three years of entering service. However, all exceeded this planned service life, with one ship operating from 1945 to 2001.

===&quot;Colossus&quot; class===
Construction was approved by the Naval Board in February 1942, with the first two ships, and , laid down in March. During 1942 and 1943, another fourteen Light Fleet carriers (named the &quot;Colossus&quot; class after the lead ship) were laid down under the 1942 Programme, to be constructed by eight British shipyards. Although it was originally planned that each Light Fleet would be ready for service in 21 months, modifications to the design saw the planned construction time increase to 27 months. Even with the omission of several important pieces of backup equipment, only two ships met this target.

The ships were launched from late 1943 onwards, with the first commissioned in December 1944. However, the delays meant that only four ships (, , , and ; formed up as the 11th Aircraft Carrier Squadron) were completed before the end of the Second World War, and only eight of the sixteen planned Light Fleets were completed as &quot;Colossus&quot;-class carriers.

During operational service, the living conditions aboard the &quot;Colossus&quot;-class ships were criticised, which resulted in the abolition of hammocks in favour of fixed bunks and the introduction of centralised eating arrangements in later warship designs.

===Maintenance carriers===
The impracticality of shore-based repair establishments in the Far East and Pacific theatres of the Second World War saw a requirement for aircraft maintenance carriers. Instead of building new ships from scratch, two under-construction &quot;Colossus&quot;es, and , were marked for conversion as they would enter service quicker, and could be converted back into operational aircraft carriers if required, a need which never arose. Both ships were completed before the end of the war, with &quot;Pioneer&quot; sailing to the Pacific in company with the 11th Aircraft Carrier Squadron; &quot;Pioneer&quot; had repaired 24 aircraft since her arrival in the Pacific.

As the ships were designed with the repair and transportation of aircraft in mind, much of the equipment required for carrier flight operations, including control facilities, arresting gear, and catapult, were not installed. This space was instead used for additional hangar room, repair and maintenance workshops, and system testing facilities.

===&quot;Majestic&quot; class===
The six remaining Light Fleet hulls were originally to be completed as &quot;Colossus&quot;-class ships, but the rapid development of carrier-based aircraft and anti-aircraft weapons required modifications to the original design. The catapult, arrestor cables, and aircraft lifts had to be upgraded to handle faster and heavier aircraft, while the flight deck was reinforced. Improved weapons and radars were fitted, and equipment to perform replenishment at sea was installed. The modifications increased the full-load displacement by 1,500 tons, and the draught by . This led to the six ships being reclassified as the &quot;Majestic&quot; class in September 1945. Five carriers were launched before the end of the Second World War, with the sixth launched in late September 1945.

Following the war&#x27;s end, work on the &quot;Majestic&quot; class was suspended, then restored to a low-priority status, with the rate of work increasing as foreign nations purchased the ships. Two, &quot;Magnificent&quot; and &quot;Terrible&quot;, entered service more-or-less as designed, but the next three were heavily upgraded with three British developments allowing the operation of larger, faster, jet-propelled aircraft: the angled flight deck, the steam catapult, and the mirror landing aid. The sixth, &quot;Leviathan&quot;, was not completed. Work was suspended in May 1946, and plans to convert her into a commando carrier or missile cruiser, or sell her to a foreign buyer, fell through. During the 1950s, she was used as an accommodation ship in Portsmouth Harbour and, in 1966, her boilers were removed and sold to the shipyard refitting the &quot;Colossus&quot;-class for Argentine service. &quot;Leviathan&quot; was scrapped in May 1968. None of the completed &quot;Majestic&quot;-class vessels saw service in the Royal Navy.

In 1943, eight &#x27;Improved &quot;Majestic&quot;s&#x27; were planned, but developments in carrier aviation and the rapid obsolescence of the Light Fleets and the wartime armoured carriers required a larger and more capable design, which became the four-ship &quot;Centaur&quot; class.

==Weapons==

===Aircraft===

In the original design, each ship was capable of carrying 41 aircraft. A redesign of the available parking area on the flight deck in March 1942 saw the ships&#x27; air group expanded to 24 Fairey Barracuda torpedo bombers and 24 Supermarine Seafire fighters, or 18 Barracudas and 34 Seafires. In RN service, the Barracuda was later replaced by the Fairey Firefly, and the Seafire was superseded by the Hawker Sea Fury during the Korean War. Early in their careers, and were fitted out for night flying operations: these carriers were to embark a 32-strong air group; mixed between Fireflies and Grumman F6F Hellcats supplied by the United States as part of the Lend Lease program.

To launch and recover aircraft, the carriers were initially equipped with hydraulic catapults, arresting gear, and crash barriers. Aircraft were stored in a single hangar measuring , with a height clearance of . This allowed the Light Fleets to later operate aircraft that the fleet carriers, which generally had two hangars with lower clearance in each, could not. The hangar was serviced by two aircraft lifts.

===Armament===
The Light Fleets were the first British aircraft carriers where the ship&#x27;s air group was seen as the &#x27;main armament&#x27;; any mounted weapons were to be for close-range anti-aircraft defence. The &quot;Colossus&quot; design called for six quadruple barrelled 2 pounder gun mounts, and 16 twin Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. Two 4-inch (102 mm) guns were originally included, but an increase in the design&#x27;s flight deck length in March 1942 saw them displaced. The ships were unarmoured, as increasing the size of the vessels was deemed more important than protection.
Lessons learned during the early part of the Pacific War showed the superiority of the Bofors 40 mm gun to other anti-aircraft weapons. By the end of the war, all &quot;Colossus&quot;-class ships had swapped all their other weapons for Bofors in single and twin mountings, and the &quot;Majestic&quot; design had been modified to carry 30 of the guns: 18 single mountings, and 6 twin mountings. The number of Bofors carried by the Light Fleets was reduced after the war, with British ships carrying only eight.

==Royal Navy service==

===Second World War and aftermath===
Although four &quot;Colossus&quot;-class ships were completed before the end of the war, they did not see front-line action: the war in Europe had proceeded to the point where aircraft carriers were of limited use, and by the time the carriers reached the Pacific, Japan had surrendered. The four ships, assigned to the British Pacific Fleet, were instead used for the transportation of returning soldiers and rescued prisoners-of-war, to help alleviate the shortage of troopships and liners. As with the &quot;Colossus&quot; class, the maintenance carriers were completed but did not enter active service before the end of the war. They were reclassified as Ferry Carriers, and used to transport aircraft to British bases and ships across the world.

During the late 1940s and early 1950s, the carriers were used as testbeds for new aircraft and technology. Throughout late 1945, &quot;Ocean&quot; was used to test several new aircraft: the Hawker Sea Fury and de Havilland Sea Hornet piston-engine fighters during August, and the de Havilland Sea Vampire jet-propelled fighter-bomber in December. On 3 December 1945, a de Havilland Sea Vampire became the first jet aircraft to land on a carrier—two months before, &quot;Ocean&quot;″s flight deck saw the last landing of a Fairey Swordfish torpedo bomber. The angled flight deck concept (which would later be installed on several of the &quot;Majestic&quot;-class carriers) was first trialled aboard &quot;Triumph&quot;: the straight-line deck markings were removed, and markings for an angled landing painted on. After a two-year loan to Canada, &quot;Warrior&quot; served as a testbed for rubberised flexible decks and skid-like landing gear during 1948 and 1949. During 1951 and 1952, &quot;Perseus&quot; was used as a trials ship for the under-development steam catapult.

===Korean War===
The &quot;Colossus&quot; class first saw combat during the Korean War. Following the invasion of South Korea by North Korea on 25 June, ships of the British Far East Fleet that were operating in Japanese waters, including the carrier , were placed under the United States Far East Commander, to operate in retaliation to the invasion under the instructions of the United Nations Security Council. The first carrier attack began on 3 July 1950, with aircraft from &quot;Triumph&quot; and United States carrier performing air strikes on North Korean airfields.
Between them, the &quot;Colossus&quot;-class carriers &quot;Triumph&quot;, , , and , along with the &quot;Majestic&quot;-class , maintained a constant Anglo-Australian aircraft carrier presence for the duration of the Korean War. The Light Fleets were cheaper to operate than the armoured fleet carriers while providing a similar sized air group, but during the war proved to be slower, less comfortable, and more prone to wear-and-tear than other RN carriers. Financial and manpower restrictions meant that only one Light Fleet could be deployed to Korea at a time. also contributed to the Korean War effort by transporting replacement aircraft from the United Kingdom to British bases throughout the Far East region, which were then drawn upon by the active carriers.

Following the end of the Korean War, &quot;Warrior&quot; and &quot;Sydney&quot; returned to Korean waters on separate deployments, to ensure that the armistice was enforced and hostilities did not re-ignite.

===Suez Crisis===
 and were part of the British response to the 1956 Suez Crisis. The two ships were not used as aircraft carriers; instead they were equipped with helicopters and tasked with transporting ashore 45 Commando, a battalion of the Royal Marines, in order to secure harbours and other landing points for heavy equipment. This, the first ship-based helicopter assault, was successful, and prompted the development of the amphibious assault ship.

===Decommissioning and disposal===
The two maintenance carriers were decommissioned during the 1950s and scrapped: &quot;Pioneer&quot; was sold in 1954, and &quot;Perseus&quot; in 1958. With the exception of HMS &quot;Triumph&quot;, the &quot;Colossus&quot;-class carriers that remained in RN service were disposed of during the early 1960s. None was significantly modernised during its service life. &quot;Triumph&quot; left service in 1958, underwent a major conversion into a Heavy Repair Ship, and re-entered service in 1965.

==Foreign service==
As Britain was unable to maintain the size of her wartime fleet after the end of the Second World War, several &quot;Colossus&quot;-class ships were placed into reserve, while work on the &quot;Majestic&quot; class was initially halted at the end of the war, then restored to a low-priority status. Demands for fiscal cutbacks, combined with the rapid obsolescence of the carriers by the development of jet aircraft, saw four of the eight &quot;Colossus&quot;es and all five completed &quot;Majestic&quot;s sold off to other nations.

The majority of the Light Fleets in foreign service were modernised, either during construction or afterwards, to operate jet aircraft. This usually consisted of the installation of an angled flight deck, upgrading the aircraft catapult to be steam-powered, and installing an optical landing system: Australian &quot;Majestic&quot;-class carrier HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot; was the third aircraft carrier in the world, after and , to be constructed with these features instead of having them added later.

===Argentina===

After a two-year loan to Canada, and a second period in Royal Navy commission, &quot;Warrior&quot; was sold to the Argentine Navy in 1958, and commissioned as on 11 November. She was equipped with Vought F4U Corsair, and she was proved unsuitable for the Grumman F9F Panther jet fighters incorporated in 1963. &quot;Independencia&quot; served as the Argentine flagship until she was replaced by the Dutch &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; (formerly ), which was sold on to Argentina in 1969 and commissioned as . &quot;Independencia&quot; was struck from service in 1971 and broken up for scrap.
&quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; was initially equipped with F9F Panther and later with Douglas A-4 Skyhawk jet fighters; these were replaced with French Dassault Super Étendards in the 1980s. The carrier provided air cover for the Occupation of the Falkland Islands in April 1982. After hostilities broke out on 1 May 1982, it attempted an attack on the Royal Navy Task Force which did not take place, as poor winds prevented the heavily laden A-4Q jets from being launched. She remained confined to port for the rest of the Falklands War, particularly after the British submarine sank the Argentine cruiser . Problems with her propulsion machinery meant that &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; was effectively inoperable from June 1986, although it was not until the start of 1999 that she was marked for scrapping.

===Australia===
In 1944, the Australian government suggested that Australian personnel be used to help counteract a personnel shortage in the Royal Navy by manning an aircraft carrier, one or more cruisers, and six destroyers. The Admiralty deemed a &quot;Colossus&quot;-class Light Fleet to be the most appropriate aircraft carrier, and &quot;Venerable&quot; was initially proposed for transfer to the Royal Australian Navy as a gift or on loan. The plan was deferred on the Australian end until a review of manpower requirements across the entire war effort was completed. The ship manning proposal was revisited in mid-1945, but the surrender of Germany in May meant that British shortages were not as problematic; as a counteroffer, the purchase of the &quot;Colossus&quot;-class &quot;Ocean&quot; by Australia was suggested. The Australian government decided against the purchase of &quot;Ocean&quot; in June.

Following the Second World War, a post-war review suggested that the Royal Australian Navy acquire three aircraft carriers as the core of a new fleet; funding restrictions saw the number of proposed carriers dropped to two. To this end, Australia acquired two &quot;Majestic&quot;-class ships: , which was commissioned in 1948 as ; and , which was upgraded for jet operations and commissioned in 1955 as . While waiting for &quot;Majestic/Melbourne&quot; to finish modernisation, the &quot;Colossus&quot;-class was loaned to Australia from 1952 until 1955, allowing it to operate a two-carrier fleet.
The first aircraft carrier acquired by the Royal Australian Navy, &quot;Sydney&quot; was deployed to Korea in order to maintain a consistent Commonwealth carrier presence in the conflict. Operating between September 1951 and January 1952, &quot;Sydney&quot; was the first carrier owned by a Commonwealth Dominion to see combat. Reclassified as a training ship in 1955, &quot;Sydney&quot; was decommissioned in 1958 but reactivated in 1962 as a fast troop transport. In her troopship role, &quot;Sydney&quot; travelled to Vietnam 25 times between 1965 and 1972. She was decommissioned in November 1973, and sold to a South Korean company for scrapping in 1975.

Although deployed to the Far East Strategic Reserve on several occasions, and assigned to escort &quot;Sydney&quot; to and from Vietnam on three occasions, &quot;Melbourne&quot; was not directly involved in any conflict during her career. However, she collided with and sank two plane guard destroyers— in 1964, and in 1969—which, along with several minor collisions and incidents, led to the reputation that the carrier was jinxed. &quot;Melbourne&quot; was sold to China for scrapping in 1985; instead of being broken up, she was studied as part of the nation&#x27;s top-secret carrier development program, and may not have been dismantled until 2002. There were plans to replace &quot;Melbourne&quot; with the British carrier , but &quot;Invincible&quot; was withdrawn from sale following her service in the Falklands War, and a 1983 election promise to not replace the carrier saw the end of Australian carrier-based fixed-wing aviation.

===Brazil===

After &quot;Vengeance&quot; was returned from her loan to Australia, she was sold to the Brazilian Navy on 14 December 1956. From mid-1957 until December 1960, the carrier underwent a massive refit and reconstruction at Verolme Dock in Rotterdam; the work performed included the installation of an 8.5-degree angled flight deck and a steam catapult, strengthening of arresting gear, and reinforcing of the hangar lifts. The carrier was commissioned into the &quot;Marinha do Brasil&quot; (MB, Brazilian Navy) as &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; on 6 December 1960.

The Brazilian carrier was equipped with Grumman S-2E Tracker fixed-wing aircraft, and Sikorsky ASH-3D Sea King, AS-355 Ecureuil, and AS332 Super Puma helicopters. Brazilian law prevented the MB from operating fixed-wing aircraft, so two separate air groups had to be embarked. In 1999, the MB acquired Douglas A-4KU Skyhawks—the first time Brazilian naval aviators were permitted to operate fixed-wing aircraft until the carrier&#x27;s 2001 decommissioning. &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; was replaced by NAe &quot;São Paulo&quot; (the former French carrier ).

&quot;Minas Gerais&quot; was the last of the Second World War-era light aircraft carriers to leave service, and at the time of her decommissioning was the oldest active aircraft carrier in the world. The carrier was marked for sale in 2002, and was actively sought after by British naval associations for return to England and preservation as a museum ship, although they were unable to raise the required money. In December 2003 the carrier was listed for sale on auction website eBay, but was removed because the site&#x27;s rules prevented the sale of military ordnance. Sometime between February and July 2004, the carrier was towed to the ship breaking yards at Alang, India, for dismantling.

===Canada===

Following wartime experience showing the effectiveness of naval aviation, the Royal Canadian Navy decided to acquire an aircraft carrier. The Canadian government decided to purchase the &quot;Majestic&quot;-class carrier &quot;Powerful&quot;, and have her upgraded to modern standards. The &quot;Colossus&quot;-class was transferred on a two-year loan from 1946 to 1948, so the experience gained by providing ship&#x27;s companies for two British escort carriers during the war could be maintained. The upgrading of &quot;Powerful&quot; took longer than expected, and as &quot;Warrior&quot; had to be returned by 1948, &quot;Magnificent&quot; was completed to the basic &quot;Majestic&quot; design and loaned to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1948 as . On her return to Britain, &quot;Warrior&quot; was used as a trials ship, then modernised before her sale to Argentina. The loan of &quot;Magnificent&quot; continued until the completion of &quot;Powerful&quot; in 1957, at which point &quot;Magnificent&quot; was returned to the British. She was to be sold to another nation, but after no buyers came forward, the carrier was scrapped.

In the meantime, &quot;Powerful&quot; had been upgraded to operate jet aircraft. The modifications included an 8° angled flight deck and steam catapult, and she was equipped with American weapons, radars, and jet aircraft instead of their British equivalents. She was commissioned in 1957 as . The carrier&#x27;s design could not keep up with the advances in naval aircraft during the early 1960s, and in 1962, the ship&#x27;s McDonnell F2H Banshee fighters were retired, leaving an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) focused air group of Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King helicopters and Grumman S-2 Tracker ASW aircraft. &quot;Bonaventure&quot; received a major mid life refit in 1967, but was withdrawn in 1970 after defence cuts. Her departure marked the end of Canadian carrier-based aviation.

===France===
Lead ship was loaned to the French Navy in August 1946 and renamed . The vessel remained in French service, and was purchased outright in 1951. She was deployed to French Indochina, and operated during the First Indochina War from 1949 to 1954. After the war&#x27;s end, the carrier was assigned to the Mediterranean. She participated in the 1956 Suez Crisis, operating air strikes against Egyptian positions around Port Said. A modernisation from 1957 to 1958 saw the installation of a 4° angled flight deck and an optical landing system, allowing &quot;Arromanches&quot; to operate Breguet Alizé anti-submarine aircraft.

&quot;Arromanches&quot; was replaced in active service by the French-built &quot;Clemenceau&quot; class, and was converted into a training ship in 1960. Apart from a short stint as an anti-submarine carrier in 1968, the ship remained in this role until her 1974 decommissioning. &quot;Arromanches&quot; was broken up for scrap in 1978.

===India===

Work on the &quot;Majestic&quot;-class was suspended in May 1946, with the ship about 75% complete. The carrier remained in an unfinished condition until January 1957, when she was purchased by the Indian Navy. Fitted with an angled flight deck, &quot;Hercules&quot; was commissioned into the Indian Navy as in 1961. &quot;Vikrant&quot; was not involved in the 1962 Sino-Indian War or the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War because she was docked for maintenance and refits on both occasions. She did operate during the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War, with her air group performing strike and interdiction operations in East Pakistan.

A major upgrade between 1979 and 1982 saw the carrier fitted with a new propulsion system, an updated radar suite, and a 9.75° ski-jump ramp to be used by Sea Harriers. The carrier was last deployed in 1994, and she was decommissioned in 1997. &quot;Vikrant&quot; helped the Indian Navy to become the dominant regional power.
Following her decommissioning, &quot;Vikrant&quot; was marked for preservation as a museum ship. &quot;Vikrant&quot; was opened to the public by the Indian Navy for short periods, but the inability to find an operating partner, lack of funds, and the deterioration of the ship led to the closure of the museum in 2012, and the sale of the vessel for ship breaking in early 2014.

===Netherlands===
The Royal Netherlands Navy acquired the &quot;Colossus&quot;-class in 1948, and commissioned her as . Initially, the carrier operated piston-engined aircraft, but underwent modernisation from 1955 to 1958, including a steam catapult, reinforced flight deck and aircraft lifts, and an 8° angled deck. Between the upgrade and 1964, &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; possessed a mixed air group of jet fighters, anti-submarine aircraft, and helicopters; the fixed-wing aircraft were removed in that year.

In 1968, &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; was heavily damaged by fire. She was repaired with equipment stripped from other Light Fleet carriers in reserve and awaiting disposal. However, before the fire, the Royal Netherlands Navy was reconsidering carrier-based operation, and instead of returning her to service, &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; was sold to Argentina.

<doc id="485374" wikidata="Q2081717" url="?curid=485374" title="Amboyna massacre">
<text>The Amboyna massacre (also known as the Amboyna trial) was the 1623 torture and execution on Ambon Island (present-day Ambon, Maluku, Indonesia) of twenty-one men, including ten in the service of the English East India Company, as well as Japanese and Portuguese traders and a Portuguese man, by agents of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), on accusations of treason. It was the result of the intense rivalry between the East India companies of England and the United Provinces in the spice trade and remained a source of tension between the two nations until late in the 17th century.

==Background==
From its inception, the Dutch Republic was at war with the Spanish crown (which was in a dynastic union with the Portuguese crown from 1580 to 1640). In 1598 the king of Spain embargoed Dutch trade with Portugal, and so the Dutch went looking for spices themselves in the areas that had been apportioned to Portugal under the Treaty of Tordesillas. In February, 1605 Steven van der Hagen, admiral of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), conquered the Portuguese fortress of Victoria at Amboyna, thereby taking over the Portuguese trading interests at Victoria. Like other European traders they tried to obtain a local monopsony in the spice trade by keeping out the factors of other European countries by force of arms. This especially caused strife with the English East India Company while the actions of the interloper Sir Edward Michelborne incensed the Dutch. Unavoidably, the national governments got involved, and this threatened the congenial relations between James I of England and the Dutch States General.

King James I and the Netherlands States General caused the two warring companies to conclude a Treaty of Defence in London in 1619 creating cooperation in the East Indies. The market in spices was divided between them in a fixed proportion of two to one (both companies having legal monopolies in their home markets); a Council of Defence was instituted in Batavia that was to govern the merchants of both companies; most important, those merchants were now to share trading posts peacefully, though each company was to retain and police the posts it had occupied. The Dutch interpreted this latter provision to mean that each company had legal jurisdiction over the employees of both companies in the places it administered. Contrarily, the English maintained, on the basis of the arbitration-article 30 of the treaty, that only the Council of Defence would have jurisdiction over employees of the &quot;other&quot; company. This proved to be an important difference of opinion in the ensuing events.

==The incident==

Despite the treaty, relations between the two companies remained tense. Both parties developed numerous grievances against each other including bad faith, non-performance of treaty-obligations, and &quot;underhand&quot; attempts to undercut each other in the relations with the indigenous rulers with whom they dealt. In the Amboyna region, local VOC-governor Herman van Speult had trouble, in late 1622, with the Sultan of Ternate, who showed signs of intending to switch allegiance to the Spanish. Van Speult suspected the English of secretly stirring up these troubles.

As a result, the Dutch at Amboyna became suspicious of the English traders that shared the trading post with them. These vague suspicions became concrete when in February 1623 one of the Japanese mercenary soldiers (ronin, or masterless samurai in the employ of the VOC) was caught in the act of spying on the defenses of the fortress Victoria. When questioned under torture the soldier confessed to a conspiracy with other Japanese mercenaries to seize the fortress and assassinate the governor. He also implicated the head of the English factors, Gabriel Towerson, as a member of the conspiracy. Subsequently, Towerson and the other English personnel in Amboyna and adjacent islands were arrested and questioned. In most, but not all cases, torture was used during the questioning. Torture consisted of having water poured over the head, around which a cloth was draped, bringing the interrogated repeatedly close to suffocation (this is today called waterboarding). This was the usual interrogative procedure in the Dutch East Indies at the time. According to the English version of events, even more sadistic forms of torture were used. The accused conspirators were stretched on the rack, subjected to flame, stabbed, and several had their limbs blown off by gunpowder. This was later disputed by the Dutch. According to Dutch trial records, most suspects confessed that they were guilty as charged, with or without being tortured. Since the accusation was treason, those that had confessed (confession being necessary for conviction under Roman Dutch law) were sentenced to death by a court consisting of the governor and Council of the VOC at Amboina. However, four of the English and two of the Japanese condemned were subsequently pardoned. Consequently, ten Englishmen, nine Japanese and one Portuguese (the latter being employees of the VOC), were executed. On 9 March 1623 they were beheaded, and the head of the English captain, Gabriel Towerson, was impaled on a pole for all to see. The incident ended any hope of Anglo-Dutch cooperation in the area, a goal that both governments had been pursuing for several years, and marked the beginning of Dutch ascendancy in the Indies.

==Aftermath==
In the summer of 1623, the Englishmen who had been pardoned and acquitted sailed to Batavia and complained to the Dutch governor-general Pieter de Carpentier and the Council of Defence about the Amboyna affair, which they said was a false accusation based upon a fantasy and that the confessions had been obtained only by severe torture. When they were unable to obtain redress in Batavia, they traveled to England, accompanied by the English factor at Batavia. Their story caused an uproar in England. The directors of the EIC asked that the English government demand reparations from the VOC and exemplary punishment of the Amboina judges from the Dutch government.

According to the English ambassador Sir Dudley Carleton, the version of events as he presented it also caused much anger at the VOC in Dutch government circles. However, the VOC soon presented its version of events which contradicted the English version in essential respects. The Dutch States General proposed a joint Anglo-Dutch commission of inquiry to establish the facts, but the suggestion was rejected by the English as too time-consuming. The Dutch did not want to execute the culprits of the torture and executions summarily as the English wished, so the States General commissioned an inquiry by &quot;delegated judges&quot; from the highest courts in the Dutch republic to investigate the matter. The Amboyna judges were recalled from the East-Indies and put under house arrest.

The trial progressed slowly because the court of inquiry wished to cross-examine the English witnesses. The English government balked at this demand because it felt it could not compel the witnesses to travel to the Republic. Besides, as the English based their case on the incompetence of the court to try employees of the EIC (according to the English interpretation of the Treaty of Defence), the executions were &quot;ipso facto&quot; illegal in the English view and, therefore, constituted a judicial murder. This contention could be decided without an examination of the witnesses. The Dutch, however, maintained that the court at Amboyna had been competent and therefore concentrated their inquiry on possible misconduct of the judges.

The English witnesses traveled to the Dutch republic in 1630 with Sir Henry Vane the Elder. They were made available to the court under restrictive conditions. The draft-verdict of the court (an acquittal of the accused) was presented to the new English king Charles I in 1632 for approval (as agreed beforehand by the two governments). It was rejected, but the accused judges were released by the Dutch authorities.

As part of Treaty of Westminster (1654) which ended the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–1654), a binational arbitration committee was established which ordered that reparations be paid by the VOC to the heirs of the English victims of the massacre. Towerson&#x27;s heirs and others received £3,615 and the EIC £85,000 from the VOC.

==War of pamphlets==
The East India Company was unhappy with the outcome, and in 1632 its directors published an exhaustive brochure, comprising all the relevant papers, with extensive comments and rebuttals of the Dutch position. The Dutch had already sought to influence public opinion with an anonymous pamphlet, probably authored by its secretary, Willem Boreel in 1624. At the time, ambassador Carleton had procured its suppression as a &quot;libel&quot; by the States General. However, an English minister in Flushing, John Winge, inadvertently translated it and sent it to England, where it displeased the East India Company.

The East India Company brochure contained the gruesome details of the tortures, as related in its original &quot;Relation&quot;. The massacre was used as casus belli for the First Anglo-Dutch War, and the brochure was reprinted as &quot;A Memento for Holland&quot; (1652). The Dutch lost the war and were forced to accept a condition in the 1654 Treaty of Westminster, calling for the exemplary punishment of any surviving culprits. However, no culprits appear to have been still alive at the time. Moreover, after arbitration on the basis of the treaty, the heirs of the English victims were awarded a total of £3615 in compensation.

The brochure and its allegations also played a role at the start of the Second Anglo-Dutch War. One of the casus belli used for the annexation of the Dutch colony New Netherland was the Amboyna Massacre. The Treaty of Breda (1667) ending this war appeared to have finally settled the matter.

However, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the matter was again raised in a propagandistic context. John Dryden wrote a play, entitled &quot;Amboyna or the Cruelties of the Dutch to the English Merchants&quot;, apparently at the behest of his patron who had been one of the chief negotiators of the Secret treaty of Dover that caused England&#x27;s entry into that war. The play embellishes the affair by attributing the animus of Governor Van Speult against Gabriel Towerson to an amorous rivalry between the (fictitious) son of the governor and Towerson over an indigenous princess. After the son rapes the princess, Towerson kills the son in a duel. The governor then takes his revenge in the form of the massacre.

Jonathan Swift refers to the massacre in Book 3, Chapter 11 of Jonathan Swift&#x27;s novel &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1726). Lemuel Gulliver pretends to be a &quot;Hollander&quot; and boards a Dutch ship named the &quot;Amboyna&quot; when he leaves Japan. He conceals from the crew the fact that he has not performed the ceremony demanded by the Japanese of &quot;trampling upon the Crucifix&quot; because, &quot;if the secret should be discovered by my countrymen, the Dutch, they would cut my throat in the voyage.&quot;

<text>HMS &quot;Glory&quot; (R62) was a of the British Royal Navy laid down on 27 August 1942 by Harland &amp; Wolff at Belfast. She was launched on 27 November 1943 by Lady Cynthia Brooke, wife of the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland.

==Operational service==
The ship was commissioned on 2 April 1945, and left for the Pacific with an air wing of Barracudas (837 Naval Air Squadron) and Corsairs (1831 Naval Air Squadron). At Sydney, she joined the 11th Aircraft Carrier Squadron of the British Pacific Fleet as the war was ending. &quot;Glory&quot; under the command of Anthony Wass Buzzard came to Rabaul shortly thereafter on 6 September 1945 to accept the surrender of the Japanese garrison there.

One member of her crew on this first voyage was Charles Causley, the Cornish poet and broadcaster, who served as a Chief Petty Officer Coder. In 1945, whilst serving in &quot;Glory&quot;, he wrote the poem &#x27;The Song of the Dying Gunner AA1&#x27; He published two further poems about the ship and this period: &#x27;HMS &quot;Glory&quot;&#x27; (a description, in the ship&#x27;s personified own &#x27;voice&#x27;, of Belfast and of its departure from that city for the Far East) and &#x27;HMS &quot;Glory&quot; at Sydney&#x27; (a longer piece from the writer&#x27;s own perspective reminiscing about his experience of the ship&#x27;s spell in Australia, and his shipmates). In various prose pieces, he also describes several other aspects and episodes of the time, such as the Japanese surrender.

After the surrender at Rabaul, &quot;Glory&quot; assisted in the retaking of Hong Kong, and then sailed to Australia and Canada to return Commonwealth troops to their respective countries. The ship returned to the United Kingdom in 1947 and was then placed in reserve. In November 1949, the ship was taken out of reserve and fully returned to service just over a year later in December 1950.

&quot;Glory&quot; then deployed to Korea in April 1951 for the first of three wartime deployments. The first deployment ended in September of that year, but &quot;Glory&quot; was back on station from January to May 1952 and November 1952 to May 1953. After the very active service of the Korean War, &quot;Glory&quot; saw out 1954 as a ferry, troop carrier and helicopter base. 1956 was the end of the ship&#x27;s active career, as she was placed in reserve. In 1961, &quot;Glory&quot; was sold to Thos. W. Ward for scrapping at Inverkeithing.

== Saluting guns ==

Whilst in reserve at Rosyth, four guns were removed and supplied to for use as a saluting battery. The four guns were described as &quot;Ordnance, quick firing, Hotchkiss, 3 pdr, Mark 1&quot; and were dated as being manufactured in 1888, 1898, 1904 &amp; 1915. These guns were used by the apprentices in HMS &quot;Caledonia&quot; to salute visiting royalty and ships until the closure of the Marine Engineering School in 1985. HMS Caledonia (1946 shore establishment) was an artificers&#x27; training establishment commissioned in 1946 and paid off in 1985.

<doc id="485377" wikidata="Q3267611" url="?curid=485377" title="HMS Vengeance (R71)">
<text>HMS &quot;Vengeance&quot; (R71) was a light aircraft carrier built for the Royal Navy during World War II. The carrier served in three navies during her career: the Royal Navy, the Royal Australian Navy (as HMAS &quot;Vengeance&quot;, from 1952 to 1955), and the Brazilian Navy (as NAeL &quot;Minas Gerais&quot;, from 1956 to 2001).

Constructed during World War II, &quot;Vengeance&quot; was one of the few ships in her class to be completed before the war&#x27;s end, but she did not see active service. The ship spent the next few years as an aircraft transport and training carrier before she was sent on an experimental cruise to learn how well ships and personnel could function in extreme Arctic conditions. In late 1952, &quot;Vengeance&quot; was loaned to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) as a replacement for the delayed aircraft carrier . She remained in Australian waters, operating as an aircraft carrier and training ship, for the majority of her three-year loan, and was returned to the Royal Navy (RN) in August 1955.

Instead of returning to RN service, the carrier was sold in 1956 to Brazil, and entered service after major upgrades, which allowed the ship to operate jet aircraft. Renamed &quot;Minas Gerais&quot;, the carrier remained in operation until 2001. Several attempts were made to sell the ship, including a listing on eBay, before she was sold for scrap and taken to Alang for breaking up.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Vengeance&quot; was constructed by Swan Hunter. She was laid down on 16 November 1942, and launched on 23 February 1944. Construction was completed on 15 January 1945, and &quot;Vengeance&quot; was commissioned into the RN.

The &quot;Colossus&quot;-class carriers were intended to be &#x27;disposable warships&#x27;: they were to be operated during World War II and scrapped at the end of hostilities or within three years of entering service. Despite this prediction, &quot;Vengeance&quot; had a service life of over 55 years.

===Weapons and systems===
Her initial armament consisted of six quadruple QF 2 pounder naval guns (known as pom-poms) and 19 Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. In 1945, after being assigned to the British Pacific Fleet, eight of the Oerlikons were replaced with eight single Bofors 40 mm guns; these guns provided better protection against Japanese &quot;kamikaze&quot; aircraft.

When commissioned into the RAN in 1952, the weapons outfit included 12 Bofors 40 mm guns and 32 Oerlikon 20 mm cannon.

===Aircraft===
During her service in the RAN, &quot;Vengeance&quot; carried a squadron each of Hawker Sea Furies and Fairey Fireflies. The carrier&#x27;s air group included three Bristol Sycamore, acquired by the RAN after observing the performance of a United States Navy Sycamore operating from during her Korean War deployment. Although not the first helicopters to see military service in Australia (that title belonging to a Sikorsky S-51 of the Royal Australian Air Force), the Sycamores formed the first Australian military helicopter squadron, and led to the establishment of Australia&#x27;s first helicopter pilot school. All three helicopters were brought out from England aboard &quot;Vengeance&quot;.

==Operational history==

===RN service===

On 11 March 1945, &quot;Vengeance&quot; left the River Clyde for working-up trials in Malta. These were completed by 21 May, when she was assigned to the 11th Aircraft Carrier Squadron of the British Pacific Fleet. The carrier sailed to Sydney via Alexandria, Port Said, Trincomalee, and Fremantle, arriving on 26 July. While alongside in Sydney, eight Oerlikons were replaced with eight single Bofors 40 mm guns; these guns provided better protection against Japanese &quot;kamikaze&quot; aircraft. &quot;Vengeance&quot; was assigned to Task Group 111.2 of the British Pacific Fleet, and was to be deployed as part of the force attacking Japanese-held Truk, but did not leave Sydney until the war ended. Following the end of the war &quot;Vengeance&quot; was ordered to Hong Kong, and on 3 September was used as the venue for the Japanese surrender of the territory.

She remained in the area until the end of 1945, sailed to Australia for a refit, then returned to Hong Kong. In April 1946, &quot;Vengeance&quot; delivered No. 11 and No. 17 Squadrons of the Royal Air Force to Miho, Ibaraki in Japan, where they were assigned as part of British Commonwealth Occupation Force. &quot;Vengeance&quot; remained in Eastern waters until 20 July 1946, when she departed for England. The ship arrived at Devonport on 13 August after visiting Trincomalee, and at the end of the year was reassigned as a Scotland-based training carrier.

&quot;Vengeance&quot; visited Oslo and Trondheim in June 1947, with First Sea Lord Sir John Cunningham aboard. During early 1948, the carrier was attached to the 3rd Aircraft Carrier Squadron, part of the British Home Fleet.
She visited St Helena in October, and cruised with the Squadron in South African waters until mid-November. On her return to the UK, &quot;Vengeance&quot; was converted for Arctic conditions, and from 5 February 1949 to 8 March 1949 operated in Arctic waters as part of Operation Rusty: an experimental cruise to determine how well ships, aircraft, and personnel functioned in extreme cold.

===Loan to Australia===
In June 1951, following the receipt of advice that the Australian aircraft carrier would not be completed until at least March 1954, the Australian Defence Committee recommended that Australia request the RN loan a carrier to the RAN. The new predicted date of completion for &quot;Melbourne&quot; was 21 months later than previous predictions, on which the establishment of two-carrier naval aviation in the RAN had been dependent. The Navy sought a four-year loan of an aircraft carrier from late 1952 to late 1956, to cover both the delays with &quot;Melbourne&quot; and the planned upgrading of once &quot;Melbourne&quot; was in service. The Australian government proposed that the loaned carrier be modified to operate both Sea Venom and Gannet aircraft, so that &quot;Melbourne&quot; and the loaned carrier could both see active service while &quot;Sydney&quot; was upgraded, but withdrew the suggestion when informed by the Admiralty that providing such capability would require the installation of a new arrestor cable system, prevent the loaned carrier from entering service until at least March 1954, and would be paid for entirely by Australia. Several smaller modifications were approved and paid for by Australia, including the installation of additional aircrew accommodation.

&quot;Vengeance&quot; was the carrier selected for the loan, and modifications for Australian service were completed in January 1952. In order to provide personnel for the loaned carrier, the RAN had to place the light cruiser into reserve. The loan was approved, with the British government choosing not to charge Australia for the loan, but stating that all operational costs would be met by the RAN, including the initial outfit of stores. In mid-1952, the liner &quot;Asturias&quot; was chartered by the RAN to transport a commissioning crew to England.

===RAN service===
&quot;Vengeance&quot; was transferred to the Royal Australian Navy on 13 November 1952. She was recommissioned as an Australian ship on this date, and received the prefix HMAS. Departing from Devonport at the end of 1952, the carrier sailed to Australia via the Mediterranean, and arrived in Fremantle on 26 February 1953. She reached Sydney in March, and was marked as fully operational in June. In late 1953, &quot;Vengeance&quot; was prepared for a deployment to Korea, to support the United Nations enforcement of the July 1953 armistice. The deployment did not go ahead: HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot; was sent instead.
From February until April 1954, &quot;Vengeance&quot; was tasked with escorting the royal yacht through Australian waters during the Royal Visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Australia. On 9 March 1954, while in Port Philip Bay, a whaler transporting 30 sailors to the carrier hit a series of freak waves and capsized. Two sailors were killed. Navy divers were involved in rescuing the survivors, with one earning the British Empire Medal for his efforts. On 3 April, while escorting &quot;Gothic&quot; to the Cocos Islands with the destroyers and accompanying, &quot;Vengeance&quot;″s ship&#x27;s company assembled on the flight deck and positioned themselves to form the Queen&#x27;s signature. After later seeing an aerial photograph of this, Her Majesty had a message sent to the carrier, saying &quot;Thank you for the original forgery.&quot; On 5 April, after arriving at the Cocos Islands, &quot;Vengeance&quot; was involved in a collision with &quot;Bataan&quot; while the destroyer attempted to refuel from the carrier. &quot;Bataan&quot;″s bow made contact with &quot;Vengeance&#x27;s&quot; side, but the damage was minor, and both ships returned to Sydney in May without assistance, after visiting Manus Island and Rabaul.

In June 1954, &quot;Vengeance&quot; was removed from active service and reclassified as the RAN&#x27;s primary training ship. The previous training ship, the cruiser , had been earmarked in mid-1953 to be decommissioned and scrapped, as modernising her would have been uneconomical. At the same time, the RAN was exploring avenues to reduce operating costs: the reduction of naval aviation from two active carriers to one would provide significant savings. The removal of &quot;Vengeance&quot; from active service, combined with the need to find a replacement training ship for &quot;Australia&quot; which was large enough to accommodate the large number of National Service trainees, saw the carrier placed in the training role. On 31 August, &quot;Vengeance&quot; accompanied &quot;Australia&quot; during the latter&#x27;s final voyage before decommissioning. The carrier sailed to Japan in late October; her first departure from Australian waters while in RAN service. &quot;Vengeance&quot; returned to Australia in November, after collecting No. 77 Squadron RAAF.

===Return to Britain and sale to Brazil===
In May 1955, &quot;Sydney&quot; assumed &quot;Vengeance&quot;″s training carrier duties as well as her own flagship and operation duties, while the latter carrier was prepared for the return to England. &quot;Vengeance&quot; left for the UK in June, stopping in Singapore to collect a squadron of RN helicopters. Arriving on 13 August, her RAN crew prepared the carrier for reserve, and &quot;Vengeance&quot; was decommissioned on 25 October. The personnel were used as the first ship&#x27;s company of , which was commissioned on 28 October 1955.

&quot;Vengeance&quot; was not reactivated for RN use, and on 14 December 1956, the carrier was sold by the Admiralty to Brazil for US$9 million. From mid-1957 until December 1960, the carrier underwent a massive refit and reconstruction at Verolme Dock in Rotterdam, which cost US$27 million. Modifications included the installation of an 8.5-degree angled flight deck, a more powerful steam catapult, stronger arresting gear, reinforced hangar lifts and a mirror landing aid. This was to allow the operation of jet aircraft, which were larger, faster, and heavier than the propeller aircraft previously operated by the carrier. A new superstructure was fitted, including a large lattice mast to support a new radar suite and fire control system. Boiler capacity was increased, and the internal electrics were converted to AC power. The length of the modernisation refit meant that while the carrier was the first purchased by a Latin American nation, she was the second to enter service; another &quot;Colossus&quot;-class carrier entered service with the Argentine Navy as in July 1959.

The carrier was commissioned into the &quot;Marinha do Brasil&quot; (MB, Brazilian Navy) as NAeL &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; on 6 December 1960. She departed Rotterdam for Rio de Janeiro on 13 January 1961.

===MB service===

In 1965, President Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco outlawed the operation of fixed-wing aircraft by the MB; this remained the responsibility of the &quot;Força Aérea Brasileira&quot; (FAB, Brazilian Air Force). As a result, &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; was required to embark two air groups: the Navy operated helicopters while the Air Force operated S-2 Tracker aircraft. Consequently, the ship spent most of her Brazilian career operating as an anti-submarine warfare carrier.
&quot;Minas Gerais&quot; underwent another major refit from 1976 to 1981, during which her radar suite was updated, datalinks were installed, and the ship&#x27;s life expectancy was increased to the 1990s. From 1986, engine and funding problems saw the Argentine Navy&#x27;s confined to port, making &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; the only operating carrier in the South American region.

From July 1991 to October 1993, the carrier underwent another modernisation refit; the work included refurbishment of her propulsion system, upgrades to the command and control system and radars, and replacement of the ship&#x27;s Bofors with Mistral surface-to-air missiles. In 1999, the MB acquired 20 A-4KU Skyhawks and 3 TA-4KU trainer aircraft from the Kuwait Air Force; the first time since the carrier&#x27;s commissioning that &quot;Forca Aeronaval da Marinha&quot; (Brazilian Navy Aviation) had been permitted to own and operate fixed-wing aircraft.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Minas Gerais&quot; was decommissioned on 16 October 2001: the last of the World War II-era light aircraft carriers to leave service. At the time of her decommissioning, she was the oldest active aircraft carrier in the world (a title passed on to the 1961-commissioned ). The carrier was marked for sale in 2002, and was actively sought after by British naval associations for return to England and preservation as a museum ship, although they were unable to raise the required money.

Just before Christmas 2003, the carrier was listed for sale on auction website eBay by a user claiming to be a shipbroker representing the owner. Bidding reached £4 million before the auction was removed from the website under rules preventing the sale of military ordnance. An auction in Rio de Janeiro in February 2004 also failed to sell the ship. Sometime between February and July 2004, the carrier was towed to the ship breaking yards at Alang, India, for dismantling.

<text>HMS &quot;Pioneer&quot; was a built for the Royal Navy during World War II. She was modified whilst under construction into an aircraft maintenance carrier. The ship arrived in Australia in mid-1945 to support operations by the British Pacific Fleet against Japanese forces. She supported the British attacks on the Japanese Home Islands from mid-June until the end of the war in August from a base in the Admiralty Islands. The ship and her facilities were used to help repair Hong Kong&#x27;s infrastructure in late 1945 and she returned to the UK in early 1946. &quot;Pioneer&quot; was immediately placed in reserve upon her arrival and she was sold in 1954 for scrap.

==Design, description and construction==
The &quot;Colossus&quot;-class aircraft carriers were intended to meet a shortage of naval flight decks. Their design was based on that of the s, but modified to permit rapid construction in commercial yards. &quot;Pioneer&quot; was not completed to her original design; the success of the maintenance aircraft carrier prompted modification of the ship, whilst under construction, to an aircraft maintenance ship without aircraft catapults.

&quot;Pioneer&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at standard load. Each of the ship&#x27;s two sets of Parsons geared steam turbines drove one propeller shaft. Steam was supplied by four Admiralty three-drum water-tube boilers operating at a pressure of . The turbines were designed for a total of and gave &quot;Pioneer&quot; a speed of . The ship carried of fuel oil which gave her a range of at .

In order to maximize space for workshops and stores, the ship&#x27;s arresting gear and catapult were not fitted; two large deckhouses were added to port of the island and on the rear of the flight deck. The ship had a single hangar, high. Aircraft were transported between the hangars and the flight deck by two aircraft lifts; each measured . Two large cranes were mounted on the flight deck to move aircraft and stores to and from the flight deck. The ship carried two small self-propelled lighters to allow unflyable aircraft to be transferred between ships or to shore facilities. Bulk petrol storage consisted of . The ship&#x27;s crew totaled 854, plus 222 in her aircraft repair department.

The ship was equipped with six quadruple mounts for the QF 2-pounder Mk VIII gun (&quot;pom-pom&quot;). These gun mounts could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of +80°. The Mk VIII 2-pounder gun fired a shell to a distance of at a rate of fire of approximately 96–98 rounds per minute per barrel. She was also fitted with 19 Bofors 40 mm guns in single mounts. The Bofors had a rate of fire of about 120 rounds per minute and a maximum range of . All of the guns were mounted on the flight deck, not in sponsons on the side of the hull like her half-sisters that were completed as aircraft carriers. Each &quot;pom-pom&quot; mount was provided with a separate fire-control director fitted with a Type 262 gunnery radar.

&quot;Pioneer&quot; was ordered on 7 August 1942 under the name &quot;Ethalion&quot;, but was renamed &quot;Mars&quot; later in 1942. She was laid down at Vickers-Armstrong in Barrow-in-Furness on 2 December and was launched on 20 May 1944 The ship was renamed &quot;Pioneer&quot; in July 1944 after the decision had been made to convert her to an aircraft maintenance ship. and was completed on 8 February 1945.

==Service==
After working up, &quot;Pioneer&quot; sailed for Australia on 30 March 1945. She arrived in Sydney on 13 May and was transferred to Manus Island, in the Admiralty Islands, on 21 June to prepare for operations off Japan. She was still there when Japan surrendered on 15 August and had repaired 24 aircraft since her arrival. &quot;Pioneer&quot; arrived in Hong Kong in late September to help with the rebuilding of the colony&#x27;s infrastructure. Her sailors restored power, telephone service and repaired trains and buses. She made one trip back to Manus, but was back in Hong Kong in late November. The ship sailed for Sydney the following month and departed for the UK on 17 February 1946. Upon her arrival, she was placed in reserve. &quot;Pioneer&quot; was sold to Thos. W. Ward for scrap in September 1954 and broken up in Inverkeithing.

<text>HMS &quot;Venerable&quot; (R63) was a of the Royal Navy. She served for only the last few months of World War II, and in 1948 she was sold to the Netherlands and renamed , taking part in the military clash in 1962 in Western New Guinea. Subsequently, she was sold to Argentina and renamed , later taking part in the Falklands War.

==Description==
The &quot;Colossus&quot;-class was developed to meet a need for more aircraft carriers to protect the fleets of the Royal Navy. As the major naval shipyards were already fully occupied, it was decided to design a simpler &quot;Fighter Carrier&quot; (which later became known as an &quot;Intermediate Aircraft Carrier&quot; and then a &quot;Light Fleet Carrier), which would be quicker and cheaper to build than the existing Fleet Carriers, and by using commercial rather than naval standards for the ships&#x27; structures, could be built by commercial shipyards (including the merchant divisions of major shipyards).

&quot;Venerable&quot; was long overall, long at the waterline and between perpendiculars, with a beam at the waterline of and an overall width of , and a mean draught of , which increased to at deep load. Displacement was standard and at full load. The ship&#x27;s flight deck was long and wide, and was made of mild steel. The flight deck was served by two centreline lifts with dimensions of with a capacity of , and had a single aircraft catapult capable of launching aircraft at . Ten arrestor wires and two safety barriers were fitted. A single hangar was provided. The ship was powered by steam created by four Admiralty 3-drum type boilers driving two Parsons geared turbines, each turning one shaft. The machinery was laid out in a unit arrangement, with two sets of two boilers and a turbine being widely separated to minimise the potential for a single torpedo hit to completely disable the ship. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of .

The carrier could operate 42 aircraft when built, while 84 aircraft could be carried when the carrier was used as an aircraft ferry. Defensive armament of the Colossus-class was limited to short-range anti-aircraft guns, with &quot;Venerable&quot; being fitted with six quadruple 2-pounder (40 mm) &quot;pom-pom&quot; autocannon, backed up by 11 twin and 10 single 20 mm Oerlikon cannon. Four 3-pounder saluting guns were also fitted. Armour was limited to steel mantlets over torpedo warheads, although extensive subdivision of designed to minimise the effects of flooding. The ship had a crew of 1300 officers and other ranks.

==Construction and career==
HMS &quot;Venerable&quot; was ordered on 7 August 1942 as Admiralty Job number J3697, and was laid down at Cammell Laird in Birkenhead as yard number 1126 on 3 December 1942. The ship was launched on 30 December 1943 and was commissioned on 17 January 1945. &quot;Venerable&quot;″s build time of 25 months was the shortest of the class.

After sea trials and working up the ship&#x27;s crew, the carrier&#x27;s air group, 1851 Naval Air Squadron, equipped with Vought Corsair fighters and 814 Naval Air Squadron, with Fairey Barracuda torpedo bombers, embarked and &quot;Venerable&quot; joined the 11th Aircraft Carrier Squadron, intended for operations with the British Pacific Fleet. &quot;Venerable&quot;, together with sister ships &quot;Colossus&quot; and left British waters on 12 March 1945. The three carriers carried out intensive training operations in the Mediterranean until 28 May 1945, when they left for the Far East. The three carriers reached Australia in July 1945, where and joined the squadron.

The Surrender of Japan changed plans to use the 11th Carrier Squadron for strikes against Japan, with &quot;Venerable&quot;, together with &quot;Indomitable&quot;, the battleship , the cruisers and , were sent to take the surrender of Japanese forces at Hong Kong. On 31 August, aircraft from &quot;Venerable&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; were launched to destroy Japanese suicide boats that had sortied against the British force, with other boats hidden north of Hong Kong Island also being attacked. Japanese forces in Hong Kong formally surrendered on 2 September. Landing parties from &quot;Venerable&quot; were used to help restore British rule to Hong Kong, duties including guarding a POW camp set up at Whitfield Barracks to hold Japanese personnel. In October 1945, &quot;Venerable&quot; repatriated Indian ex-prisoners of war from Haiphong, Vietnam to Madras, Transport and repatriation duties continued for the rest of the year before the ship was refitted at Garden Island, Sidney in January–February 1946.

After the refit, &quot;Venerable&quot; returned to service as a carrier of the British Pacific Fleet, with the same squadrons embarked, although 814 Squadron&#x27;s Barracudas had been replaced by Fairey Firefly fighter-reconnaissance aircraft. In April &quot;Venerable&quot; temporarily returned to transport duties, replacing the escort carrier which had mechanical problems with her boilers. Trooping duties continued until the end of June 1946, while 1851 Squadron transferred to &quot;Vengeance&quot; in the same month, being replaced by the Supermarine Seafires of 802 Naval Air Squadron which embarked in September that year.

In February 1947, &quot;Venerable&quot; ended her service with the British Pacific Fleet and set out to return to Britain, arriving at Plymouth Sound on 26 March 1947. She was decommissioned at Devonport on 1 April that year. While &quot;Venerable&quot; had been in service for less than three years, the Royal Navy was in the process of demobilising after the end of the Second World War, and the carrier was placed in reserve and placed on the Disposal List.

==Royal Netherlands Navy==

The Royal Netherlands Navy had a requirement to replace the escort carrier &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; (formerly the British ), and in January 1948, &quot;Venerable&quot; started a refit at Devonport to prepare the carrier for her potential new owner. The purchase was completed on 1 April 1948, and the carrier was commissioned into the Royal Netherlands Navy as . &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; continued in use until 1968, when she suffered a serious fire and was laid up, before being purchased by Argentina.

==Argentine Navy==

After repair, the carrier was commissioned into the Argentine Navy as the . &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; remained in service during the Falklands War in 1982, although the threat of British submarines resulted in the carrier being withdrawn to port after the sinking of the cruiser . By 1988, &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot;″ machinery was in poor condition, and the carrier entered a refit, but this was never completed, and she subsequently provided spare parts for her sister ship, . The remaining part of the ship was scrapped at the Alang Ship Breaking Yard, India, in 2000.

<text>HMS &quot;Perseus&quot; was a light fleet aircraft carrier built for the Royal Navy during World War II. The ship was initially named HMS &quot;Edgar&quot;, but she was renamed in 1944 when the Admiralty decided to convert her into an aircraft maintenance carrier. She was completed in 1945, after the end of World War II, and she made a trip to Australia late in the year. Upon her return to the UK in early 1946, &quot;Perseus&quot; was placed in reserve. The ship was recommissioned in 1950 to serve as the trials ship for the steam catapult then under development. Over 1,600 test launches were conducted before the catapult was removed in 1952 and she was converted for use as a ferry carrier to transport aircraft, troops and equipment overseas. She was reduced to reserve again in 1954 and sold for scrap in 1958.

==Design, description and construction==
The &quot;Colossus&quot;-class carriers were intended to meet a shortage of naval flight decks. Their design was based on that of the , but modified to permit rapid construction in commercial yards. &quot;Perseus&quot; was not completed to her original design; the success of the maintenance aircraft carrier prompted modification of the ship, whilst under construction, to an aircraft maintenance ship without aircraft catapults.

&quot;Perseus&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at standard load. Each of the ship&#x27;s two sets of Parsons geared steam turbines drove one propeller shaft. Steam was supplied by four Admiralty three-drum water-tube boilers operating at a pressure of . The turbines were designed for a total of and gave &quot;Perseus&quot; a speed of . The ship carried of fuel oil which gave her a range of at .

In order maximize space for workshops and stores, the ship&#x27;s arresting gear and catapult were not fitted and all the facilities required for flying operations were removed. Two large deckhouses were added to port of the island and on the rear of the flight deck. The ship had a single hangar, high. Aircraft were transported between the hangars and the flight deck by two aircraft lifts (elevators); each measured . Two large cranes were mounted on the flight deck to move aircraft and stores to and from the flight deck. The ship carried two small self-propelled lighters to allow unflyable aircraft to be transferred between ships or to shore facilities. Bulk petrol storage consisted of . The ship&#x27;s crew totalled 854, plus 222 in her aircraft repair department.

Aircraft could undergo maintenance, and most functional and equipment tests carried out aboard - either in the hangar or on the deck. Some components could be repaired on board, but other work was to be carried out by the workshops on the engine repair and component repair ships that would accompany the maintenance carrier.

The ship was equipped with six quadruple mounts for the QF 2-pounder Mk VIII gun (&quot;pom-pom&quot;). These gun mounts could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of +80°. The Mk VIII 2-pounder gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a distance of . The gun&#x27;s rate of fire was approximately 96–98 rounds per minute. She was also fitted with 19 Bofors 40 mm autocannon in single mounts. The Bofors fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . It had a rate of fire of about 120 rounds per minute and a maximum range of . All of the guns were mounted on the flight deck, not in sponsons on the side of the hull like her half-sisters that were completed as aircraft carriers. Each &quot;pom-pom&quot; mount was provided with a separate fire-control director fitted with a Type 262 gunnery radar.

&quot;Perseus&quot; was ordered on 14 March 1942 under the name &quot;Edgar&quot;. She was laid down at Vickers-Armstrong in Newcastle-upon-Tyne on 1 January 1943 and was launched on 26 March 1944. The ship was renamed &quot;Perseus&quot; in July 1944, after the decision had been made to convert her to an aircraft maintenance ship, and she was completed on 19 October 1945.

==Service==

&quot;Perseus&quot; arrived in Portsmouth on 24 October 1945, after the end of World War II, to begin working up and sailed on 17 November for Australia. She arrived in Sydney on 21 December, just in time to take charge of winding up the &quot;Air Train&quot; that had supported the British Pacific Fleet. The ship departed Melbourne on 26 March 1946, carrying a load of aircraft to return to the United Kingdom, and arrived at Rosyth on 17 May where she was placed in reserve.

In 1950, &quot;Perseus&quot; was fitted with an experimental steam catapult. The catapult was placed on top of the carrier&#x27;s existing flight deck and the deckhouse to port of the island was removed to accommodate it. Some 1,560 launches were made by the catapult, beginning with over 1,000 wheeled dead-loads, of gradually increasing weight, and moving on to unmanned aircraft with their wings truncated to reduce their ability to glide. The final tests were made by manned aircraft of every type flown by the Fleet Air Arm. After this, the ship arrived in Philadelphia on 14 January 1952 to demonstrate the catapult to the United States Navy. Between them, some 127 launches of manned aircraft were made by the British and the Americans. &quot;Perseus&quot; arrived back at Portsmouth on 21 March and had the catapult removed. All of her remaining maintenance equipment was removed and she was converted for use as a ferry carrier.

On 10 December, the ship carried the Westland Whirlwinds of 848 Squadron to Singapore, arriving on 8 January 1953. She arrived back at Portsmouth on 11 February and then embarked part of the 100 Grumman Avengers transferred to the Royal Navy under the terms of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act in Norfolk, Virginia, on 16 March. She arrived back in Norfolk to load the remaining aircraft on 29 April. &quot;Perseus&quot; was fitted with temporary grandstand seating (&quot;bleachers&quot;) in June for Very Important Persons and the press during Elizabeth II&#x27;s Coronation Fleet Review in Spithead. Later in the year she made a trip transporting troops and equipment to the Far East.

On 20 January 1954, 706 Squadron, a second-line unit, flew aboard to conduct trials of the anti-submarine version of the Whirlwind helicopter. They were successful enough that the squadron was redesignated as 845 Squadron afterwards and &quot;Perseus&quot; ferried them to Malta in April. The ship continued on to deliver relief supplies to Singapore intended for Korea and was reduced to reserve again upon her return on 12 July. The Admiralty intended to convert her to a submarine depot ship and she was towed to Belfast to begin work in 1955. The cutbacks from the 1957 Defence White Paper caused the conversion to be cancelled and the ship was towed to Gare Loch to await a decision on the ship&#x27;s disposition. &quot;Perseus&quot; sold for scrap in May 1958 and towed to Port Glasgow to begin demolition.

<doc id="485381" wikidata="Q7237912" url="?curid=485381" title="Prairie Island Indian Community">
<text>Prairie Island Indian Community (Dakota: &quot;Tinta Winta&quot;) is a Mdewakanton Sioux Indian Reservation

The reservation was established in 1889, with boundaries modified after that time. The federally recognized tribe has lost much reservation land to the requirements of two major federal projects of the 20th century. The United States Army Corps of Engineers was authorized by Congress to construct Lock and Dam No. 3 along the river to improve navigation, and took over reservation land to support this. Later, the federal government authorized construction in 1973 of the Prairie Island Nuclear Power Plant nearby, taking more reservation land for this project. 

The main reservation lies within the city of Red Wing. Off-reservation trust lands are located both within Red Wing and in Welch Township in northern Goodhue County, as well as in Ravenna Township in eastern Dakota County. These more than double the total landholdings of the tribe. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the combined reservation and off-reservation trust land have a land area of The reservation had 310 residents in the 2020 census, including off-reservation trust lands. The tribe operates Treasure Island Resort &amp; Casino on its land near the Mississippi River north of Red Wing.

==History==

===Termination efforts===
As part of the Indian termination policy that was followed by the US government from the 1940s to the 1960s, four Native American Groups in Minnesota were targeted. A memo dated 19 January 1955 for the BIA issued from the Department of the Interior indicates additional terminations were being reviewed in proposed legislation for four Indian communities of southern Minnesota including the Lower Sioux Community in Redwood and Scott counties, the New Upper Sioux Community in Yellow Medicine County, the Prairie Island Community in Goodhue County and about 15 individuals living on restricted tracts in Yellow Medicine County.

Discussions between the BIA and the Indians from the targeted area began in 1953 and continued throughout 1954. Though the Prairie Island and Lower Sioux communities drafted agreements with individual land ownership, the Upper Sioux strongly opposed fee simple title to tribal lands. On 26 January 1955 Senator Edward Thye introduced into Congress a bill (S704) to provide for termination of the tribes. Opposition, not only of the Indians, but of other citizens who realized their state expenditures might increase, were made to the committee reviewing the bill. The Minnesota Governor&#x27;s Commission on Human Rights also opposed the legislation, indicating that it would &quot;not adequately protect the interests of the Indians...&quot; The bill died in committee, never reaching the Senate floor.

===Controversial construction===
The Community has lost land to major federal projects. United States Army Corps of Engineers was authorized by Congress to construct Lock and Dam No. 3 along the river to improve navigation, and took over reservation land to support this. Later, the federal government authorized construction in 1973 of the Prairie Island Nuclear Power Plant nearby, taking more reservation land for this project.

The plant&#x27;s owner and operator, Xcel Energy, has stored radioactive waste in above-ground steel casks on the site since 1991. As this area is in the floodplain of the Mississippi River, the Prairie Island Community and others feared that seasonal flooding could damage the casks, resulting in contamination of this important river.

In 2003 Xcel gained legislative authority in Minnesota to expand the number of radioactive waste casks it had on site. The legislature granted the request, but required the company to make greater use of renewable energy in generating power, such as wind power. In addition, it was required to pay the adjacent Prairie Island Community up to $2.25 million per year to help with improvements to their evacuation plan (in case of a nuclear accident), as well as the acquisition and development of new land for their reservation. In addition, this money was to help pay for a health study and emergency management activities by the small tribe.

In the 21st century, the Prairie Island Community and others in the area opposed renewal by the NRC of the operating license of this plant, but it was approved in June 2011.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the combined reservation and off-reservation trust land have a total area of , of which is land and is water. The land area of the reservation alone was , while the land area of the off-reservation trust land was .

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2020, the combined population of Prairie Island Indian Community and Off-Reservation Trust Land was 310. The population density was . There were 115 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the reservation and off-reservation trust land was 80.0% Native American, 6.8% White, 1.3% Black or African American, 0.6% Asian, 1.0% from other races, and 10.3% from two or more races. Ethnically, the population was 10.3% Hispanic or Latino of any race.

<text>The Madawaska River is a tributary of the Ottawa River in the St. Lawrence River drainage basin in Ontario, Canada. The river is long and drains an area of . Its name comes from an Algonquian band of the region known as &quot;Matouweskarini&quot;, meaning &quot;people of the shallows&quot;.

==Geography==
The Madawaska River rises at Source Lake in geographic Canisbay Township in the Unorganized South Part of Nipissing District, in the highlands of southern Algonquin Park. It flows east, dropping before emptying into the Ottawa River at Arnprior.

===Tributaries===
* Opeongo River
* York River

===Lakes and reservoirs===
The lower portion of the Madawaska River supports several large lakes, including:
* Centennial Lake
* Black Donald Lake
* Calabogie Lake
* Madawaska Reservoir (Arnprior Head Pond)
* Kamaniskeg Lake

==History==
In the late 19th century, the river was used to transport logs from the forested areas surrounding the river. Beginning in the 1960s, the river was used to generate hydroelectric power. Undammed sections of the river are also used for canoeing, kayaking and recreational fishing.
Around 1916, artist Tom Thomson followed the log drive down the river, painting the subject in &quot;The Drive&quot; (1916-17).

==Fauna==
The most common species of game fish found in this river include walleye (yellow pickerel), northern pike, muskellunge, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass.

==Hydroelectric Power==
Ontario Power Generation (OPG) has 5 stations on the Madawaska. 

In June 2002 sluice gates at the Barrett Chute Generating Station were accidentally opened, killing two people, and injuring seven. OPG and two employees were charged with criminal negligence. Procedures at the plant were reviewed, and fencing added or repaired.

The Calabogie station is being upgraded in 2022 to double capacity from 5 MW to 10 MW. The original station was badly damaged by a tornado in September 2018. Clean up was completed in 2020. The project is expected to cost 100 million dollars. 

==Provincial parks==
Two sections of the river are designated and protected as provincial waterway parks:
*Upper Madawaska River Provincial Park, between Whitney and Madawaska; .
*Lower Madawaska River Provincial Park, between Latchford Bridge and Griffith; .

Both parks are administered by Ontario Parks but are non-operating, meaning there are no visitor facilities or services available. Both are ideal for whitewater canoeing.

<doc id="485394" wikidata="Q1137642" url="?curid=485394" title="Courageous-class aircraft carrier">
<text>The Courageous&quot; class, sometimes called the Glorious&quot; class, was the first multi-ship class of aircraft carriers to serve with the Royal Navy. The three ships—, and —were originally laid down as &quot;Courageous&quot;-class battlecruisers as part of the Baltic Project during the First World War. While very fast, their minimal armour and few guns limited their long-term utility in the post-war Royal Navy, and they were laid up after the war. They were considered capital ships by the terms of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty and were included in the total amount of tonnage allowed to the Royal Navy. Rather than scrap them, the Navy decided to convert them to aircraft carriers as permitted under the Treaty.

&quot;Furious&quot;, already partially converted during the war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In an attempt to minimise air turbulence, she was given no superstructure or island. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem was that she lacked a standard funnel; instead, her boiler uptakes ran along the sides of the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the flight deck, or at the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the exhaust gases were as much of a problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been. Her half-sisters, &quot;Courageous&quot; and &quot;Glorious&quot;, began their conversions to aircraft carriers as &quot;Furious&quot; neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since &quot;Furious&quot; had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel, increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.

As the first large carrier completed by the Royal Navy, &quot;Furious&quot; was extensively used to evaluate aircraft handling and landing procedures, including the first-ever carrier night landing in 1926. &quot;Courageous&quot; became the first warship lost by the Royal Navy in the Second World War when she was torpedoed in September 1939 by a German submarine. &quot;Glorious&quot; participated in the Norwegian campaign in 1940, but she was sunk by two German battleships in June as she sailed home with a minimal escort. &quot;Furious&quot; participated in many major operations during the war, including the Norwegian campaign in 1940, the Malta Convoys and &quot;Operation Torch&quot; in 1942, and airstrikes on the and other targets in Norway in 1944. The ship was worn out by 1944 and was placed in reserve status in September 1944 before being paid off in 1945 and sold for scrap in 1948.

== Careers as battlecruisers ==

The first two ships of the class, &quot;Courageous&quot; and &quot;Glorious&quot;, spent the First World War on North Sea patrols, climaxing in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in November 1917. Their half-sister &quot;Furious&quot; was designed with a pair of guns—as opposed to four —but was modified while being built to hold a flying-off deck and hangar in lieu of her forward turret and barbette. She made some patrols in the North Sea before her rear turret was removed and another flight deck added. Her aircraft attacked Zeppelin sheds during the Tondern raid in July 1918.

All three ships were reduced to reserve after the war. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the signatory nations to a set amount of capital ship tonnage; all ships in excess of this figure had to be scrapped. Up to of existing ships could be converted into aircraft carriers, and the Royal Navy decided to use the &quot;Courageous&quot;-class ships due to their high speed. Each ship was reconstructed with a flight deck during the 1920s.

== Conversions ==
 had been fitted during the First World War with a flying-off and landing deck, but the latter proved largely unusable because of the strong air currents around the superstructure and exhaust gases from the funnel. She was laid up after the war, but was converted to an aircraft carrier between June 1921 and September 1925. Her design was based on the very limited experience gained with the first two British carriers: , less than three years old, and , which had carried out only 143 deck landings during preliminary sea trials in 1920.

&quot;Furious&quot;″s superstructure, masts, funnel and landing deck were removed and she was given a flight deck that extended over three-quarters of her length. This flight deck was not level; it sloped upwards about three-quarters of the way from the stern to help slow down landing aircraft, which had no brakes at the time it was designed. That era&#x27;s fore-and-aft arresting gear, initially long on &quot;Furious&quot;, was not intended to stop landing aircraft—the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind—but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and potentially falling off the flight deck. Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the National Physical Laboratory which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges minimised turbulence. To minimise any turbulence over the flight deck, &quot;Furious&quot; was flush-decked and lacked an island, like &quot;Argus&quot;; instead she was provided with a retractable charthouse at the forward end of the flight deck.

A two-storey hangar was built under the flight deck, each level being high. The lower hangar was long by wide and the upper was . Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers. Her boilers were ducted down the side of the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck, or, when landing operations were in progress, out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship. This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like fighters so that the ship could simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck and could speedily launch her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck. Two lifts (elevators) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and hangars. Two ready-use petrol tanks were provided for aircraft and the ship&#x27;s boats on the upper deck. An additional of petrol were in bulk storage. The longitudinal arresting gear proved unpopular in service and it was ordered removed in 1927 after tests aboard &quot;Furious&quot; in 1926 had shown that deck-edge palisades were effective in reducing cross-deck gusts that could blow aircraft over the side. &quot;Furious&quot;″s long exhaust ducting hampered landing operations, and restricted the size of the hangars and thus the number of aircraft that she could carry.

&quot;Glorious&quot; and &quot;Courageous&quot; were converted to aircraft carriers after &quot;Furious&quot; began her reconstruction, &quot;Courageous&quot; at Devonport starting on 29 June 1924, and &quot;Glorious&quot; at Rosyth on 14 February 1924. The latter was moved to Devonport to complete the conversion after &quot;Furious&quot; was finished. Their design was based on &quot;Furious&quot; with a few improvements based on experience gained since she was designed. All superstructure, guns, and fittings down to the main deck were removed. A two-storey hangar, each level high and long, was built on top of the remaining hull; the upper hangar level opened onto a short flying-off deck, below and forward of the main flight deck. Two slightly larger lifts were installed fore and aft in the flight deck. An island was added on the starboard side with the bridge, flying control station, and funnel, as an island did not create as much turbulence as had been earlier feared. By 1939 both ships could carry of petrol.

== Description ==

The &quot;Courageous&quot;-class ships had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. These were increases of in beam and over in draught compared to their earlier incarnations as battlecruisers. They displaced at normal load and at deep load, increases of over . Their metacentric height declined from at deep load to and the ships had a complete double bottom. In 1939, &quot;Courageous&quot; had a complement of 807 officers and ratings, plus 403 men in her air group.

Their half-sister &quot;Furious&quot; was the same length, but had a beam of , and an average draught of at deep load, two feet deeper than before the conversion. She displaced at normal load and at deep load, over 3,000 long tons more than her previous displacement of at load and at deep load. &quot;Furious&quot;″s metacentric height was at deep load, a reduction of after her conversion. In 1932, &quot;Furious&quot; had a complement of 738 officers and ratings, plus 468 men in her air group.

=== Propulsion ===
The &quot;Courageous&quot;-class ships were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared steam turbines. Arranged in two engine rooms, each of the turbines drove one of the four propeller shafts. &quot;Furious&quot;″s propellers were in diameter. The turbines were powered by 18 Yarrow small-tube boilers equally divided among three boiler rooms. The turbines were designed to produce a total of at a working pressure of . No significant changes to the machinery were made during the conversion process to any of the three ships, but their increased displacement reduced their speed to approximately .

&quot;Furious&quot;″s fuel capacity was increased by during her reconstruction, which increased her range to at a speed of . The maximum fuel capacity of &quot;Courageous&quot; and &quot;Glorious&quot; was increased during the conversion to of fuel oil, giving them an endurance of at 10 kn.

=== Armament ===

&quot;Furious&quot; retained ten of her original eleven breech-loading BL 5.5-inch Mk I guns, five on each side, for self-defence from enemy warships. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . Their maximum range was at their maximum elevation of 25°, and the rate of fire was 12 rounds per minute.

Half a dozen QF 4-inch Mark V guns replaced her original anti-aircraft guns. Four were mounted on the sides of the flying-off deck and two on the quarterdeck. They had a maximum depression of −5° and a maximum elevation of 80°. The guns fired a high explosive (HE) shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of 10 to 15 rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of , but an effective range of much less. The four guns on the flying-off deck were removed during trials of the lower flight deck in 1926–1927, but only two were replaced when the trials were concluded.

Four single QF 2-pounder &quot;pom-poms&quot; were installed by 1927. During &quot;Furious&quot;″s September 1930 – February 1932 refit, her anti-aircraft outfit was changed by the substitution of two 8-barrel 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounts for the forward 4-inch guns on the flying-off deck removed earlier. The Mark V mount could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of 80°. The Mark VIII 2-pounder gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a distance of . The gun&#x27;s rate of fire was approximately 96–98 rounds per minute.

The and guns were replaced during &quot;Furious&quot;″s refit in early 1939 by a dozen QF 4-inch Mk XVI guns in twin dual-purpose Mark XIX mounts. One mount each was on the former flying-off deck and the quarterdeck while the other four were mounted two per side. The Mark XIX mount could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of 80°. The Mark XVI gun fired fifteen to twenty HE shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of . Against surface targets it had a range of and a maximum ceiling of , but an effective anti-aircraft range of much less. Two more Mark V 2-pounder mounts were added fore and aft of the newly added island at the same time.

During the Second World War, &quot;Furious&quot;, the only surviving ship of the three, received an eventual total of 22 manually operated automatic 20 mm Oerlikon light anti-aircraft (AA) guns, which replaced the single quadruple Vickers 0.50-calibre machine gun mount. The Oerlikon fired a HE shell at a muzzle velocity of . The maximum ceiling was 10,000 ft and the maximum range was although the effective range was under . The cyclic rate of fire was 450 rounds per minute, but the practical rate was between 250 and 320 rounds per minute owing to the need to reload magazines.

A mix of single-purpose anti-surface and anti-aircraft guns in various sizes was considered for &quot;Courageous&quot; and &quot;Glorious&quot; by the Admiralty, but was ultimately rejected for a dual-purpose armament of sixteen QF 4.7-inch Mark VIII guns in single high-angle mounts. One mount was on each side of the lower flight deck and a pair were on the quarterdeck. The remaining twelve mounts were distributed along the sides of each ship. These mounts could depress to −5° and elevate to a maximum of 90°. The Mark VIII guns fired a HE shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of 8–12 rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of , but an effective range of much less. They had a maximum range of against surface targets.

During refits in the mid-1930s, both ships received multiple 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounts. &quot;Courageous&quot; received three quadruple Mark VII mounts, one on each side of the flying-off deck, forward of the 4.7-inch guns, and one behind the island on the flight deck (two of these were transferred from the battleship ). &quot;Glorious&quot; received three octuple Mark VI mounts in the same locations. Both ships received four water-cooled 0.50-calibre Mark III machine guns in a single quadruple mounting. This mount could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of 70°. The machine guns fired a bullet at a muzzle velocity of . This gave the gun a maximum range of about , although its effective range was only . Neither ship had any further guns added before they were sunk early in the war, in 1939 and 1940, respectively.

=== Fire control and radar ===
To assist its weapon systems in hitting their target, &quot;Furious&quot; was completed with one fire-control system for each side, with separate directors for low-angle and high-angle guns. The 5.5-inch guns were centrally controlled by a Dreyer Fire-Control Table on the lower deck while the 4-inch guns had their mechanical computers next to their directors. The existing fire-control directors were removed when &quot;Furious&quot; received her new dual-purpose 4-inch mountings in 1939. New high-angle directors, including two for the &quot;pom-poms&quot;, were mounted on top of the new island and on the former lower flight deck. Over the course of the war Type 285 gunnery radars were mounted on top of the high-angle directors. She also received a Type 290 air-search radar.

&quot;Courageous&quot; was initially fitted only with low-angle directors for her guns, but these were replaced by dual-purpose directors when she was refitted in 1930. (&quot;Glorious&quot;, completed later, had hers from the beginning.) Neither ship was fitted with radar before its early loss.

=== Protection ===
Little armour other than that of the barbettes was removed during their conversion to aircraft carriers. The transverse bulkheads were carried through the locations of the former barbettes. The flight deck was in thickness.

Unlike other British battlecruisers, the bulk of the armour of the &quot;Courageous&quot;-class ships was made from high-tensile steel (HTS), a type of steel used structurally in other ships. Their waterline belt consisted of of HTS covered by a thick mild steel skin. It protected roughly the middle two-thirds of the ship with a one-inch extension forward to the two-inch forward transverse bulkhead well short of the bow. The belt had a height of , of which was below the designed waterline. From the former forward barbette, a 3-inch bulkhead extended out to the ship&#x27;s side between the upper and lower decks and a comparable bulkhead was in place at the former location of the rear barbette as well. Four decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from , thickest over the magazines and the steering gear. After the Battle of Jutland, of extra protection was added to the deck around the magazines.

The torpedo bulkheads were increased during building from 0.75– in thickness. All three ships were fitted with a shallow anti-torpedo bulge integral to the hull, which was intended to detonate the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and deflect the underwater explosion to the surface, away from the ship. Later testing proved that it was not deep enough to accomplish its task and that it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion.

=== Air groups ===

Normally, &quot;Furious&quot; could carry only about 36 aircraft. In the 1920s this commonly meant one flight (squadrons after 1932) of fighters (Fairey Flycatcher), two of spotters (Blackburn Blackburn or Avro Bison), one spotter reconnaissance (Fairey IIID) and two flights of torpedo bombers (Blackburn Dart). In 1935 there was one squadron of fighters with Hawker Nimrods and Hawker Ospreys, one squadron of Blackburn Baffin torpedo bombers and one squadron of Fairey IIIF spotters. During the Second World War, the carrier typically carried a single fighter squadron and two of strike aircraft of various types, although the mix was often adjusted for specific missions.

&quot;Courageous&quot; and &quot;Glorious&quot; were generally similar except that they carried a total of 48 aircraft. They commonly flew the same types of aircraft as &quot;Furious&quot;, although they are also known to have flown the Fairey Seal, the Blackburn Shark, and the Blackburn Ripon.

== Pre-war service ==
&quot;Furious&quot; was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet after commissioning in 1925, although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher floatplanes, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty. A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily. The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge palisades (windbreaks) were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather. The first carrier night-landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard &quot;Furious&quot;.

The ship was reduced to reserve status on 1 July 1930 in preparation for a lengthy overhaul at Devonport from September 1930 to February 1932, focused on refitting her machinery and re-tubing her boilers. In addition her quarterdeck was raised by one deck, the AA armament was revised and water spraying facilities were fitted in the hangars. Upon completion she ran a full-power trial on 16 February 1932 where her maximum speed was from a total of .

&quot;Furious&quot; was recommissioned in May 1932 as part of the Home Fleet with a reduced crew before being brought up to full complement in November. Transverse arresting gear was fitted sometime during the mid-1930s. She was detached to the Mediterranean Fleet from May to October 1934. &quot;Furious&quot; was present at the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May 1937 for King George VI. She became a deck-landing training carrier in 1937, although she was refitted between December 1937 and May 1938 in Devonport, where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward. During the Munich Crisis in September 1938, she embarked Nos. 801, 821 and 822 Squadrons and joined the fleet at Scapa Flow, before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair.

She was given a more extensive refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5.5-inch guns and palisades, mounted AA guns on her flying-off deck, plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar, and gave her a small island on the starboard side. &quot;Furious&quot; resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939.
&quot;Courageous&quot; was recommissioned on 21 February 1928 and assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet from May 1928 to June 1930. She was relieved by &quot;Glorious&quot; and refitted from June to August 1930. The ship was assigned to the Atlantic and Home Fleets from 12 August 1930 to December 1938 aside from a temporary attachment to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1936. In the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed and she received two hydraulic catapults on the upper flight deck before March 1934. &quot;Courageous&quot; was refitted again between October 1935 and June 1936 and received her &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounts. She was also present at the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review. She became a training carrier in December 1938 when joined the Home Fleet and continued on that duty until the start of the Second World War.
&quot;Glorious&quot; was recommissioned on 24 February 1930 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet, but was attached to the Home Fleet from March to June 1930. She relieved &quot;Courageous&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet in June 1930 and remained there until October 1939. In a fog on 1 April 1931 &quot;Glorious&quot; rammed SS &quot;Florida&quot; amidships while steaming at . The impact crumpled of the flying-off deck and forced &quot;Glorious&quot; to put into Gibraltar for temporary repairs. She had to sail to Malta for permanent repairs which lasted until September 1931. Sometime in the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed. She was refitted at Devonport from July 1934 to July 1935 where she received two catapults, her flight deck was extended to the rear, her quarterdeck was raised one deck and she received her multiple &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounts. &quot;Glorious&quot; also participated in the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review before returning to the Mediterranean.

== Second World War ==
=== &quot;Courageous&quot; ===

In the early days of the war, hunter-killer groups were formed around the fleet aircraft carriers to find and destroy U-boats. On 17 September 1939, U-boat struck the ship with two torpedoes, and &quot;Courageous&quot; became the first British warship sunk to enemy action in the Second World War. As &quot;Ark Royal&quot; had been surprised by a near-miss seven days earlier, the fleet carriers were withdrawn from this duty.

=== &quot;Glorious&quot; ===
Force J, including &quot;Glorious&quot;, was organised to hunt for the in the Indian Ocean. They were not successful, and &quot;Glorious&quot; remained in the Indian Ocean until December when she was transferred to the Mediterranean.

&quot;Glorious&quot; was recalled to the Home Fleet in April 1940 to provide air cover for British forces landing in Norway. Gloster Gladiators of No. 263 Squadron RAF were flown aboard to be transferred to Norwegian airbases. &quot;Glorious&quot; and &quot;Ark Royal&quot; arrived off central Norway on 24 April where 263 Squadron was flown off and their organic aircraft attacked targets in the Trondheim area before &quot;Glorious&quot; had to return to Scapa Flow on 27 April to refuel and embark new aircraft. She returned on 1 May, after failing to load new aircraft because of poor weather. The task force was under heavy air attack by the Luftwaffe all day and was withdrawn that evening.

&quot;Glorious&quot; returned on 18 May with six Supermarine Walrus amphibious flying boats of 701 Squadron and 18 Hawker Hurricanes of No. 46 Squadron RAF. The Walruses were flown off to Harstad, but the airfield in Skånland Municipality was not yet ready for the Hurricanes and they were still aboard when &quot;Glorious&quot; returned to Scapa on 21 May. &quot;Glorious&quot; came back to the Narvik area on 26 May and the Hurricanes were flown off.

British forces were ordered withdrawn a few days later. The evacuation (&quot;Operation Alphabet&quot;) began in the north on the night of 3/4 June, and &quot;Glorious&quot; arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support. She carried only nine Sea Gladiators of 802 Squadron and six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of 823 Squadron for self-defence, as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems in the early evening despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes. This was the first time that high performance monoplanes without tailhooks had been landed on an aircraft carrier.

Captain Guy D&#x27;Oyly-Hughes requested and was granted permission to proceed independently to Scapa Flow in the early hours of 8 June. On the way back across the North Sea, &quot;Glorious&quot; and her two escorting destroyers, and , were found by the two German battleships and . No combat air patrol was being flown, no aircraft were spotted on the deck for quick take off and there was no lookout in the crow&#x27;s nest. The German heavy ships sank all three British vessels with most of their crews, although &quot;Acasta&quot; managed to torpedo &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; before she was sunk. Only 43 men from &quot;Glorious&quot; survived.

=== &quot;Furious&quot; ===
Until 2 October 1939, &quot;Furious&quot; remained on training duties, combined with anti-submarine sweeps off the east coast of Scotland. She was then assigned to the Home Fleet to replace the sunken &quot;Courageous&quot; and sortied on 8 October with the fleet to hunt unsuccessfully for the &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and escorting ships which had been spotted off southern Norway. &quot;Furious&quot; departed her berth adjacent to the battleship in Scapa Flow for more futile searches for German ships on 13 October, the day before &quot;Royal Oak&quot; was sunk by in Scapa Flow. &quot;Furious&quot; served as the flagship for the convoy bringing most of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division to Britain in mid-December 1939.

&quot;Furious&quot; joined the Home Fleet off the coast of Norway on 10 April 1940 and her Swordfish made several attacks on German ships in Narvik on the following days. She refuelled at Tromsø on the 14th and remained behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April, her aircraft flying reconnaissance missions until ordered home on 25 April. Her port inner turbine had been damaged by the shock wave from a near miss on 18 April, and the damage was more serious than initially thought. After quick repairs, &quot;Furious&quot; returned on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed 263 Squadron; they were flown off on 21 May once their base at Bardufoss was ready. She sailed to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off.

On 14 June, carrying only half of 816 Squadron for her own protection, &quot;Furious&quot; sailed unescorted for Halifax, Nova Scotia carrying £18,000,000 in gold bullion. On 1 July she escorted a convoy of Canadian troops bound for Iceland from Halifax and ferried over almost 50 aircraft, spare parts and munitions. On his own initiative, Captain Troubridge ordered all available space should be used for sugar bound for Britain. She reembarked her aircraft upon her arrival and made a number of air strikes on shipping in Norwegian waters and on the seaplane base at Tromsø through October 1940. &quot;Furious&quot; loaded 55 aircraft in Liverpool on 7 November and sailed for Takoradi, Gold Coast, on 15 November where the aircraft were flown off on 27 November to reinforce fighter units defending Egypt. By 15 December, &quot;Furious&quot; was back in Liverpool, where she embarked 40 Hurricanes for Takoradi. She sailed on 21 December and joined up with Convoy WS 5A which encountered the on 25 December. The German ship was driven off by the escorts, and &quot;Furious&quot; reached Takoradi on 10 January 1941. She arrived in Britain on 5 February where she was given a brief refit. She made another ferry trip to Takoradi between 4 and 22 March.

Now with a new destination for her ferry trips, &quot;Furious&quot; transported two dozen Hurricanes to Gibraltar on 25 April where they were transferred to &quot;Ark Royal&quot; to be flown off for Malta. She returned for another load of Hurricanes and arrived back in Gibraltar on 18 May. Some of these fighters were moved to &quot;Ark Royal&quot; via planks between the flight decks of the carriers berthed stern to stern. This time she accompanied &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and the two carriers flew off their fighters from a position south of Sardinia. She would repeat this ferry mission three more times from June to September 1941. In July and August, &quot;Furious&quot; and attacked German installations in the Arctic areas of Norway and Finland with limited success and heavy losses. Following her last ferry mission she was sent to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to refit.

&quot;Furious&quot; arrived back in the UK in April 1942 and spent the next three months working up. In August she was detailed to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in Operation Pedestal, but she was to sail with them only far enough to allow her 38 Supermarine Spitfires to reach Malta. This she did, just as &quot;Eagle&quot; was torpedoed, but &quot;Furious&quot; turned around after flying off her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully. She loaded another batch of 32 Spitfires on 16 August and they were flown off the following day south-east of the Balearic Islands. After this mission &quot;Furious&quot; was sent back to Home Fleet for training. One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before Operation Torch, and she arrived on 27 October. She loaded 32 Spitfires and launched them on the 29th before returning to Gibraltar to participate in Torch.

Providing cover for the Central Task Force, &quot;Furious&quot;″s aircraft neutralised the airfields at La Senia and Tafraoui, both near Oran, Algeria. She remained with Force H until February 1943 before transferring to Home Fleet where she remained for the rest of the war. In July the Home Fleet demonstrated off the coast of Norway in strength to distract attention from the Allied invasion of Sicily; &quot;Furious&quot;″s role was to allow a German reconnaissance aircraft to spot the British ships and make a report then shoot it down. She was refitted in August and spent the rest of the year training.

On 3 April 1944, Fairey Barracudas from &quot;Furious&quot; and &quot;Victorious&quot; attacked the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; in Altafjord, Norway, as part of Operation Tungsten. &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was hit 14 times and needed three months to complete her repairs, although four aircraft were lost in the attack. The Home Fleet tried another attack on &quot;Tirpitz&quot; later in the month, but bad weather prevented any attack from being made. Instead the aircraft attempted to attack installations at Bodø, but found a German convoy instead and sank three ships. Three operations against targets in northern Norway, including two against &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, had to be abandoned or diverted to other targets in May, but three German ships were sunk and two more were set afire. &quot;Furious&quot; and other carriers made another attempt to sink the &quot;Tirpitz&quot; on 17 July, but were unsuccessful against the fully alerted German defences. Four more attacks on &quot;Tirpitz&quot; were made in August, but only the attack on the 24th was even partially successful as two minor hits were made.

As the war progressed, the ship&#x27;s age and limitations became increasingly apparent, and &quot;Furious&quot; was placed in reserve on 15 September 1944. She was paid off in April 1945 and used to evaluate the effects of aircraft explosives on the ship&#x27;s structure. She was sold in 1948 for scrap, which was completed in 1954 at Troon.

<text>HMS &quot;Glorious&quot; was the second of the three s built for the Royal Navy during the First World War. Designed to support the Baltic Project championed by the First Sea Lord, Lord Fisher, they were relatively lightly armed and armoured. &quot;Glorious&quot; was completed in late 1916 and spent the war patrolling the North Sea. She participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in November 1917 and was present when the German High Seas Fleet surrendered a year later.

&quot;Glorious&quot; was paid off after the war, but was rebuilt as an aircraft carrier during the late 1920s. She could carry 30 per cent more aircraft than her half-sister which had a similar tonnage. After re-commissioning in 1930, she spent most of her career operating in the Mediterranean Sea. After the start of the Second World War in 1939, &quot;Glorious&quot; spent the rest of the year hunting for the commerce-raiding in the Indian Ocean before returning to the Mediterranean. She was recalled home in April 1940 to support operations in Norway. While evacuating British aircraft from Norway in June, the ship was sunk by the German battleships and in the North Sea with the loss of over 1,200 lives.

== Design and description ==

During the First World War, Admiral Fisher was prevented from ordering an improved version of the preceding s by a wartime restriction that banned construction of ships larger than light cruisers. To obtain ships suitable for traditional battlecruiser roles, such as scouting for fleets and hunting enemy raiders, he settled on a design with the minimal armour of a light cruiser and the armament of a battlecruiser. He justified their existence by claiming he needed fast, shallow-draught ships for his Baltic Project, a plan to invade Germany via its Baltic coast.

&quot;Glorious&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at load and at deep load. &quot;Glorious&quot; and her sisters were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared steam turbines. The Parsons turbines were powered by eighteen Yarrow boilers. During the ship&#x27;s abbreviated sea trials, she reached . The ship was designed to normally carry of fuel oil, but could carry a maximum of . At full capacity, she could steam for an estimated at .

&quot;Glorious&quot; carried four BL 15-inch (381 mm) Mark I guns in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore (&#x27;A&#x27;) and aft (&#x27;Y&#x27;). Her secondary armament was 18 BL 4-inch (102 mm) Mark IX guns mounted in six triple mounts. These mounts had the three breeches too close together and the 23 loaders tended to interfere with one another. This negated the mount&#x27;s intended high rate of fire against torpedo boats and other smaller craft. A pair of QF 3-inch (76 mm) 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast of the mainmast on &quot;Glorious&quot;. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and 10 torpedoes were carried.

== First World War ==

&quot;Glorious&quot;&#x27; keel was laid down on 1 May 1915 by Harland and Wolff at their Belfast shipyard. She was launched on 20 April 1916 and completed on 14 October at a cost of £1,967,223. During her sea trials the following month, her sister &quot;Courageous&quot; sustained structural damage while running at full speed in a rough head sea and had the damaged areas stiffened shortly afterwards to prevent a recurrence. &quot;Glorious&quot; did not suffer similar damage and did not receive her stiffening until 1918. Upon commissioning, &quot;Courageous&quot; served with the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet. After most of the 1st Cruiser Squadron was sunk at the Battle of Jutland, the squadron was re-formed with &quot;Courageous&quot; and &quot;Glorious&quot;. &quot;Glorious&quot; received six twin-tube torpedo mounts in mid-1917: one mount on each side of the mainmast on the upper deck and two mounts on each side of &#x27;Y&#x27; turret on the quarterdeck.

On 16 October 1917 the Admiralty received word of German ship movements, possibly indicating some sort of raid. Admiral Beatty, commander of the Grand Fleet, ordered most of his light cruisers and destroyers to sea in an effort to locate the enemy ships. &quot;Courageous&quot; and &quot;Glorious&quot; were not initially ordered to sea, but were sent to reinforce the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron patrolling the central part of the North Sea later that day. Two German light cruisers slipped through the gaps in the British patrols and destroyed a convoy bound for Norway during the morning of 17 October, but the British warships received no word of the engagement until that afternoon. The 1st Cruiser Squadron was ordered to intercept, but was unsuccessful as the German cruisers were faster than expected.

=== Second Battle of Heligoland Bight ===

Throughout 1917 the Admiralty was becoming more concerned about German efforts to sweep paths through the British-laid minefields intended to restrict the actions of the High Seas Fleet and German submarines. A preliminary raid on German minesweeping forces on 31 October by light forces destroyed 10 small ships and the Admiralty decided on a larger operation to destroy the minesweepers and their light cruiser escorts. Based on intelligence reports, the Admiralty allocated the 1st Cruiser Squadron on 17 November 1917, with cover provided by the reinforced 1st Battlecruiser Squadron and distant cover by the battleships of the 1st Battle Squadron.

The German ships, four light cruisers of II Scouting Force, eight destroyers, three divisions of minesweepers, eight &quot;sperrbrecher&quot; (cork-filled trawlers) and two trawlers to mark the swept route, were spotted at 7:30 am, silhouetted by the rising sun. &quot;Courageous&quot; and the light cruiser opened fire with their forward guns seven minutes later. The Germans responded by laying a smoke screen and this made spotting targets very difficult. The British continued in pursuit, but lost track of most of the smaller ships in the smoke and concentrated fire on the light cruisers as opportunity permitted. One 15-inch shell hit a gun shield of , but it did not affect her speed. At 8:33 the left-hand gun in &quot;Glorious&quot;″s forward turret was wrecked when a shell detonated inside the gun barrel. At 9:30 the 1st Cruiser Squadron broke off their pursuit to avoid a minefield marked on their maps. The ships turned south, playing no further role in the battle. &quot;Glorious&quot; required five days of repairs to fix damage caused by premature detonation and her own muzzle blast. She fired 57 15-inch and 213 four-inch shells during the engagement.
&quot;Glorious&quot; received flying-off platforms on top of her turrets in 1918. A Sopwith Camel was carried on the rear turret and a Sopwith 1½ Strutter on the forward turret. On 5 November 1918, &quot;Glorious&quot; was anchored off Burntisland in the Firth of Forth together with the seaplane tender and the battleship when a sudden Force 10 squall caused &quot;Campania&quot; to drag her anchor and collide first with &quot;Royal Oak&quot; and then with &quot;Glorious&quot;. Both &quot;Royal Oak&quot; and &quot;Glorious&quot; suffered only minor damage, but &quot;Campania&quot; was holed by her collision with &quot;Royal Oak&quot;. &quot;Campania&quot;′s engine rooms flooded, and she settled by the stern and sank five hours later without loss of life.

&quot;Glorious&quot; was present at the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet on 21 November 1918. She was placed in reserve at Rosyth, Scotland, on 1 February 1919 and served as a turret drill ship, being also flagship of the rear-admiral commanding the Devonport Reserve between 1921 and 1922.

== Conversion ==

The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the amount of capital ship tonnage and the Royal Navy was forced to scrap many of its older battleships and battlecruisers. However up to of existing ships could be converted into aircraft carriers, for which the &quot;Courageous&quot;-class ships&#x27; large hulls and high speeds made them ideal candidates. &quot;Glorious&quot; began her conversion at Rosyth in 1924, and was towed to Devonport where she was completed on 24 February 1930. During the ship&#x27;s post-conversion sea trials, she reached . Her 15-inch turrets were placed into storage and later reused during the Second World War for , the world&#x27;s last battleship to be built.

Her new design improved on her half-sister which lacked an island and a conventional funnel. All superstructure, guns, torpedo tubes, and fittings down to the main deck were removed. A two-storey hangar, each level high and long, was built on top of the remaining hull; the upper hangar level opened on to a short flight deck, below and forward of the main flight deck. The lower flying-off deck improved launch and recovery cycle flexibility until heavier fighters requiring longer takeoff rolls made the lower deck obsolete in the 1930s. Two lifts were installed fore and aft in the flight deck. An island with the bridge, flying-control station, and funnel was added on the starboard side as islands had been found not to contribute significantly to turbulence. By 1939 the ship could carry of petrol for her aircraft.
&quot;Glorious&quot; received a dual-purpose armament of sixteen QF 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark VIII guns in single mounts. One mount was on each side of the lower flight deck and a pair was on the quarterdeck. The remaining twelve mounts were distributed along the sides of the ship. During her 1935 refit, the ship received three octuple QF two-pounder (40 mm) &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounts, one on each side of the flying-off deck, forward of the 4.7-inch guns, and one behind the island on the flight deck. She also received a single quadruple mount for water-cooled Vickers machineguns for anti-aircraft use.

The ship recommissioned on 24 February 1930 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet, but was attached to the Home Fleet from March to June 1930. She relieved &quot;Courageous&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet in June 1930 and remained there until October 1939. In a fog on 1 April 1931 &quot;Glorious&quot; rammed the French ocean liner amidships while steaming at . The impact crumpled of the flying-off deck and killed 1 seaman aboard &quot;Glorious&quot; and 24 passengers and crew aboard &quot;Florida&quot;. The ship was forced to put into Gibraltar to temporary repairs. She had to sail to Malta for permanent repairs which lasted until September 1931. Sometime in the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed. She was refitted at Devonport from July 1934 to July 1935 where she received two hydraulic accelerators (catapults) on her upper flight deck, which was also extended to the rear, her quarterdeck was raised one deck and she received her multiple &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounts. &quot;Glorious&quot; participated in the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May 1937 for King George VI before returning to the Mediterranean.

=== Air group ===

The ship could carry up to 48 aircraft; when first recommissioned, she carried Fairey Flycatcher fighters, Blackburn Dart and Blackburn Ripon torpedo bombers, and Fairey IIIF reconnaissance planes of the Fleet Air Arm. From 1933 until &quot;Glorious&quot; returned to the United Kingdom in April 1940, aside from a period when refitting in the mid-1930s, she carried 802 Squadron which flew a mixture of nine Hawker Nimrod and three Hawker Osprey fighters, until re-equipping with a dozen Gloster Sea Gladiators in May 1939. 812 and 823 Squadrons were embarked for reconnaissance and anti-ship attack missions. They flew the Blackburn Ripon, the Blackburn Baffin and the Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers and as well as Fairey IIIF and Fairey Seal reconnaissance aircraft. When &quot;Glorious&quot; recommissioned after her refit in 1935, 825 Squadron was embarked, initially with Fairey IIIFs, but the squadron converted to Fairey Swordfish in May 1936.

== Second World War ==
&quot;Glorious&quot; served briefly with the Mediterranean Fleet for a time after the Second World War broke out. In October 1939, she moved through the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean where she became part of Force J which was organised to hunt for the in the Indian Ocean. It was not successful and &quot;Glorious&quot; remained in the Indian Ocean until December when she returned to the Mediterranean.

=== Norwegian Campaign ===
She was recalled to the Home Fleet in April 1940 to provide air cover for British forces landing in Norway. Eighteen Gloster Gladiators of No. 263 Squadron RAF were flown aboard to be transferred to Norwegian airbases. Eleven Blackburn Skuas of 803 Squadron, plus eighteen Sea Gladiators from 802 and 804 Squadrons were also embarked. &quot;Glorious&quot; and arrived off central Norway on 24 April where 263 Squadron was flown off and their own aircraft attacked targets in and south of Trondheim before &quot;Glorious&quot; had to return to Scapa Flow late on 27 April to refuel and embark new aircraft. &quot;Glorious&quot;″s Sea Gladiators provided air cover for the two carriers. They damaged one Heinkel He 111 bomber on a reconnaissance mission. Before departing she transferred four serviceable Skuas to &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. She returned on 1 May, but had been unable to load many new aircraft because of poor weather. Only a dozen Swordfish of 823 Squadron, three Skuas and one Blackburn Roc managed to be flown aboard. The task force was under heavy air attack by the Luftwaffe all day and was withdrawn that evening. One Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber was shot down after it dropped its bomb by the Sea Gladiators on patrol.

&quot;Glorious&quot; returned on 18 May with six Supermarine Walrus flying boats of 701 Squadron and 18 Hawker Hurricanes of No. 46 Squadron RAF. The latter aircraft had been loaded aboard by crane. The Walruses were quickly flown off to Harstad, but the airfield in Skånland was not yet ready for the Hurricanes and they were still aboard when &quot;Glorious&quot; returned to Scapa on 21 May. &quot;Glorious&quot; came back to the Narvik area on 26 May and the Hurricanes were quickly flown off.
Even this success proved ephemeral and British forces were ordered to withdraw a few days later. The evacuation (Operation Alphabet) began in the north on the night of 3/4 June and &quot;Glorious&quot; arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support, although she only carried nine Sea Gladiators of 802 and six Swordfish from 823 Squadrons for self-defence as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if at all possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard from their base at Bardufoss during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were landed without significant problems in the early evening despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes. These had been flown off from land bases to keep them from being destroyed in the evacuation after the pilots discovered that a sandbag carried in the rear of the Hurricane allowed full brakes to be applied immediately on landing. This was the first time that high-performance monoplanes without tailhooks had landed on an aircraft carrier.

The commanding officer of &quot;Glorious&quot;, Captain Guy D&#x27;Oyly-Hughes, was a former submariner who had been executive officer of &quot;Courageous&quot; for 10 months. He was granted permission to proceed independently to Scapa Flow in the early hours of 8 June. Howland maintains the reason was to hold a court-martial of his Commander (Air), J. B. Heath, who had refused an order to carry out an attack on shore targets on the grounds that the targets were at best ill-defined and his aircraft were unsuited to the task. Heath had been left behind in Scapa to await trial. Another rationale was that &quot;Glorious&quot; was running short of fuel. One possibility was that &quot;Glorious&quot;, with her Swordfish detachment equipped with long-range fuel tanks, had been selected for Operation Paul, the mining of Luleå harbor, which had to happen before Narvik was evacuated.

=== Sinking ===
Unknown to the British, the German Navy had launched Operation Juno: the German battleships and , the heavy cruiser and four destroyers were ordered to attack the British base at Harstad and support the German advance towards Narvik. Whilst preparing to attack on 7 June, the German commander realized the British were evacuating Norway and instead of attacking Harstad, he choose to intercept the evacuation convoys on 8 June. During the morning of 8 June some ships were intercepted but no convoy was found. The German force then split up. &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; and the four destroyers were sent to Trondheim to refuel and then provide artillery support for the German force (&quot;Gruppe&quot; Feuerstein) advancing to Narvik.

&quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; continued to search for convoys in the Norwegian Sea. At 15:45 a lookout at the highest platform on &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; sighted a dust cloud, and then the mast of &quot;Glorious&quot; at a distance of . The German battleships gave chase immediately and at 16:10 the two escorting destroyers, and were detected as well.

The British spotted the German ships shortly after 16:00 and &quot;Ardent&quot; was dispatched to investigate. &quot;Glorious&quot; did not alter course or increase speed. Five Swordfish were ordered to the flight deck and Action Stations were ordered 16:20. No combat air patrol was being flown, no aircraft were ready on the deck for quick take-off and there was no lookout in &quot;Glorious&quot;″s crow&#x27;s nest. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; opened fire on &quot;Ardent&quot; at 16:27 at a range of , causing the destroyer to withdraw, firing torpedoes and making a smoke screen. &quot;Ardent&quot; scored one hit with her 4.7-inch guns on &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; but was hit several times by the German ships&#x27; secondary armament and sank at 17:25.
&quot;Scharnhorst&quot; switched her fire to &quot;Glorious&quot; at 16:32 and scored her first hit six minutes later on her third salvo, at a range of , (or 15 miles), when one hit the forward flight deck and burst in the upper hangar, starting a large fire. This hit destroyed two Swordfish being prepared for flight and the hole in the flight deck prevented any other aircraft from taking off. Splinters penetrated a boiler casing and caused a temporary drop in steam pressure. At 16:58 a second shell hit the homing beacon above the bridge and killed or wounded the captain and most of the personnel stationed there. &quot;Ardent&quot;″s smokescreen became effective enough to impair the visibility of the Germans from about 16:58 to 17:20 so they ceased fire on &quot;Glorious&quot;.

&quot;Glorious&quot; was hit again in the centre engine room at 17:20 and this caused her to lose speed and commence a slow circle to port. She also developed a list to starboard. The German ships closed to within 16,000 yards and continued to fire at her until 17:40. &quot;Glorious&quot; sank at 18:10, approximately at , with 43 survivors.

As the German ships approached &quot;Glorious&quot;, &quot;Acasta&quot;, which had been trying to maintain the smokescreen, broke through her own smoke and fired two volleys of torpedoes at &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;. One of these hit the battleship at 17:34 abreast her rear turret and badly damaged her. &quot;Acasta&quot; also managed one hit from her 4.7-inch guns on &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, but was riddled by German gunfire and sank at around 18:20.

Survivors estimated that about 900 men abandoned &quot;Glorious&quot;. With &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; damaged by the torpedo hit and unaware that Allied ships were not in contact with &quot;Glorious&quot; the German force withdrew and did not try to pick up survivors. The Royal Navy meanwhile, knew nothing of the sinking until it was announced on German radio. The Norwegian ship &quot;Borgund&quot;, on passage to the Faroe Islands, arrived late on 10 June and picked up survivors, eventually delivering 37 alive to Tórshavn of whom two later died. Another Norwegian ship, &quot;Svalbard II&quot;, also making for the Faeroes, picked up five survivors but was sighted by a German aircraft and forced to return to Norway, where the four still alive became prisoners of war for the next five years. Another survivor from &quot;Glorious&quot; was rescued by a German seaplane. Therefore, the total of survivors was 40, including one each from &quot;Acasta&quot; and &quot;Ardent&quot;. The total killed or missing was 1,207 from &quot;Glorious&quot;, 160 from &quot;Acasta&quot; and 152 from &quot;Ardent&quot;, a total of 1,519.
The sinkings and the failure to mount a rescue were embarrassing for the Royal Navy. All ships encountering enemies had been ordered to broadcast a sighting report, and the lack of such a report from &quot;Glorious&quot; was questioned in the House of Commons. It emerged that the heavy cruiser had passed within of the battle, flying the flag of Vice-Admiral John Cunningham, who was carrying out orders to evacuate the Norwegian royal family to the UK and maintain radio silence. Some survivors from &quot;Glorious&quot; and &quot;Devonshire&quot; testified that a sighting report had been correctly sent, and received by &quot;Devonshire&quot;, but that it had been suppressed by Cunningham, who departed at high speed in accordance with his orders. It was also alleged that there was confusion over the use of wireless telegraphy frequencies on board &quot;Glorious&quot; which could have contributed to the failure of any other ship or shore-station to receive a sighting report. The absence of normal airborne patrols over &quot;Glorious&quot; and its destroyers, in conditions of maximum visibility, was named as a contributor to the sinkings.

The circumstances of the sinking were the subject of a debate in the House of Commons on 28 January 1999. After the existence of the Bletchley Park intelligence activities was made public in the 1970s, it was revealed that Naval Section personnel at Bletchley Park predicted a breakout into the Baltic by German warships based on traffic analysis but the RN Operational Intelligence Centre did not agree on the interpretation, and did not inform the Home Fleet.

=== Memorials ===
The most prominent memorial for the lost crew of HMS &quot;Glorious&quot;, HMS &quot;Ardent&quot; and HMS &quot;Acasta&quot; is situated in Southsea Common, Portsmouth, overlooking the promenade and is accessible to the public at all times. There are 176 memorials from the 1,531 servicemen lost with HMS &quot;Glorious&quot;, HMS &quot;Ardent&quot; and HMS &quot;Acasta&quot; at the Portsmouth Naval Memorial.

For many years the only memorial to the seamen lost in the three ships was a stained-glass window in the church of St Peter Martindale in Cumbria, on the east side of Ullswater. A new memorial plaque dedicated to HMS &quot;Glorious&quot;, and her escort destroyers &quot;Ardent&quot; and &quot;Acasta&quot;, was unveiled in St. Nicholas&#x27;s Church, in HMS &quot;Drake&quot;, Devonport in 2002. On 8 June 2010, 70 years after the loss of &quot;Glorious&quot;, &quot;Acasta&quot; and &quot;Ardent&quot;, a memorial plaque inscribed in English and Norwegian was unveiled near the Trondenes Historical Centre in Harstad, Norway, the two destroyers&#x27; last port of call. A memorial plaque is mounted on a stone plinth next to a memorial tree, in the National Memorial Arboretum in Alrewas, Staffordshire. It can be found in the gardens in location 19-81. On 8 June 2019, a memorial plaque was unveiled in the Belvedere Gardens, Plymouth Hoe, dedicated to all crew members who lost their lives onboard HM Ships &quot;Glorious, Ardent&quot; and &quot;Acasta.&quot;

A model of HMS &quot;Glorious&quot; by model maker Norman A. Ough built for the Royal United Services Museum is now on display in the Fleet Air Arm Museum at RNAS Yeovilton.

<text>HMS &quot;Courageous&quot; was the lead ship of her class of three battlecruisers built for the Royal Navy in the First World War. Designed to support the Baltic Project championed by First Sea Lord John Fisher, the ship was very lightly armoured and armed with only a few heavy guns. &quot;Courageous&quot; was completed in late 1916 and spent the war patrolling the North Sea. She participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in November 1917 and was present when the German High Seas Fleet surrendered a year later.

&quot;Courageous&quot; and were decommissioned after the war and laid up, then rebuilt as aircraft carriers in the mid-1920s. &quot;Courageous&quot; and &quot;Glorious&quot; could carry 48 aircraft, compared with 36 carried by their half-sister on about the same displacement. After recommissioning &quot;Courageous&quot; spent most of her career operating off Great Britain and Ireland. She briefly became a training ship, but reverted to her normal role a few months before the start of the Second World War in September 1939. Later that month, German U-boat torpedoed &quot;Courageous&quot; which sank with the loss of more than 500 of her crew.

==Origin and construction==
In the First World War, Admiral Fisher was prevented from ordering an improved version of the preceding s by a wartime restriction that banned construction of ships larger than light cruisers in 1915. To obtain ships suitable for the doctrinal roles of battlecruisers, such as scouting for fleets and hunting enemy raiders, he settled on ships with the minimal armour of a light cruiser and the armament of a battlecruiser. He justified their existence by claiming he needed fast, shallow-draught ships for his Baltic Project, a plan to invade Germany via its Baltic coast.

&quot;Courageous&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at load and at deep load. &quot;Courageous&quot; and her sisters were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared steam turbines. To save design time, the installation used in the light cruiser , the first cruiser in the navy with geared turbines, was simply replicated for four turbine sets. The Parsons turbines were powered by eighteen Yarrow small-tube boilers. They were designed to produce a total of at a working pressure of . The ship reached an estimated on sea trials.

The ship&#x27;s normal design load was of fuel oil, but she could carry a maximum of . At full capacity, she could steam for an estimated at a speed of .

&quot;Courageous&quot; carried four BL 15-inch Mk I guns in two hydraulically powered twin gun turrets, designated &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen BL 4-inch Mk IX guns mounted in six manually powered mounts. The mount placed three breeches too close together, causing the 23 loaders to get in one another&#x27;s way, and preventing the intended high rate of fire. A pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast the mainmast on &quot;Courageous&quot;. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and carried 10 torpedoes for them.

==First World War==
&quot;Courageous&quot; was laid down on 26 March 1915, launched on 5 February 1916 and completed on 4 November. On her sea trials later that month, she sustained structural damage while running at full speed in a rough head sea; the exact cause is uncertain. The forecastle deck was deeply buckled in three places between the breakwater and the forward turret. The side plating was visibly buckled between the forecastle and upper decks. Water had entered the submerged torpedo room and rivets had sheared in the angle irons securing the deck armour in place. The ship was stiffened with of steel in response. As of 23 November 1916, she cost £2,038,225 to build.

Upon commissioning, &quot;Courageous&quot; was assigned to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet. She became flagship of the 1st Cruiser Squadron near the end of 1916 when that unit was re-formed after most of its ships had been sunk at the Battle of Jutland in May. The ship was temporarily fitted as a minelayer in April 1917 by the addition of mine rails on her quarterdeck that could hold over 200 mines, but never laid any mines. In mid-1917, she received half a dozen torpedo mounts, each with two tubes: one mount on each side of the mainmast on the upper deck and two mounts on each side of the rear turret on the quarterdeck. On 30 July 1917, Rear-Admiral Trevylyan Napier assumed command of the 1st Cruiser Squadron and was appointed Acting Vice-Admiral Commanding the Light Cruiser Force until he was relieved on 26 October 1918.

On 16 October 1917, the Admiralty received word of German ship movements, possibly indicating a raid. Admiral Beatty, the commander of the Grand Fleet, ordered most of his light cruisers and destroyers to sea in an effort to locate the enemy ships. &quot;Courageous&quot; and &quot;Glorious&quot; were not initially included amongst them, but were sent to reinforce the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron patrolling the central part of the North Sea later that day. Two German light cruisers managed to slip through the gaps between the British patrols and destroy a convoy bound for Norway on the morning of 17 October, but no word was received of the engagement until that afternoon. The 1st Cruiser Squadron was ordered to intercept, but was unsuccessful as the German cruisers were faster than expected.

===Second Battle of Heligoland Bight===

Throughout 1917 the Admiralty was becoming more concerned about German efforts to sweep paths through the British-laid minefields intended to restrict the actions of the High Seas Fleet and German submarines. A preliminary raid on German minesweeping forces on 31 October by light forces destroyed ten small ships. Based on intelligence reports, the Admiralty allocated the 1st Cruiser Squadron on 17 November 1917, with cover provided by the reinforced 1st Battlecruiser Squadron and distant cover by the battleships of the 1st Battle Squadron, to destroy the minesweepers and their light cruiser escorts.

The German ships—four light cruisers of II Scouting Force, eight destroyers, three divisions of minesweepers, eight &quot;Sperrbrecher&quot;s (cork-filled trawlers) and two other trawlers to mark the swept route—were spotted at 7:30 am. &quot;Courageous&quot; and the light cruiser opened fire with their forward guns seven minutes later. The Germans responded by laying an effective smoke screen. The British continued in pursuit, but lost track of most of the smaller ships in the smoke and concentrated fire on the light cruisers. &quot;Courageous&quot; fired 92 fifteen-inch shells and 180 four-inch shells in the battle, and the only damage she received was from her own muzzle blast. One fifteen-inch shell hit a gun shield of the light cruiser but did not affect her speed. At 9:30 the 1st Cruiser Squadron broke off their pursuit so that they would not enter a minefield marked on their maps; the ships turned south, playing no further role in the battle.

After the battle, the mine fittings on &quot;Courageous&quot; were removed, and she spent the rest of the war intermittently patrolling the North Sea. In 1918, short take-off platforms were fitted for a Sopwith Camel and a Sopwith 1½ Strutter on both turrets. The ship was present at the surrender of the German High Seas fleet on 21 November 1918. &quot;Courageous&quot; was placed in reserve at Rosyth on 1 February 1919 and she again became Napier&#x27;s flagship as he was appointed Vice-Admiral Commanding the Rosyth Reserve until 1 May, The ship was assigned to the Gunnery School at Portsmouth the following year as a turret drill ship. She became flagship of the Rear-Admiral Commanding the Reserve at Portsmouth in March 1920. Captain Sidney Meyrick became her Flag Captain in 1920. He was relieved by Capt John Casement in August 1921.

==Between the wars==

===Conversion===
The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 severely limited capital ship tonnage, and the Royal Navy was forced to scrap many of its older battleships and battlecruisers. The treaty allowed the conversion of existing ships totalling up to into aircraft carriers, and the &quot;Courageous&quot; class&#x27;s combination of a large hull and high speed made these ships ideal candidates. The conversion of &quot;Courageous&quot; began on 29 June 1924 at Devonport. Her fifteen-inch turrets were placed into storage and reused in the Second World War for , the Royal Navy&#x27;s last battleship. The conversion into an aircraft carrier cost £2,025,800.

The ship&#x27;s new design improved on her half-sister HMS &quot;Furious&quot;, which lacked an island and a conventional funnel. All superstructure, guns, torpedo tubes, and fittings down to the main deck were removed. A two-storey hangar was built on top of the remaining hull; each level was high and long. The upper hangar level opened onto a short flying-off deck, below and forward of the main flight deck. The flying-off deck improved launch and recovery cycle flexibility until new fighters requiring longer takeoff rolls made the lower deck obsolete in the 1930s. Two lifts were installed fore and aft in the flight deck. An island with the bridge, flying control station and funnel was added on the starboard side, since islands had been found not to contribute significantly to turbulence. By 1939 the ship could carry of petrol for her aircraft.

&quot;Courageous&quot; received a dual-purpose armament of sixteen QF 4.7-inch Mk VIII guns in single HA Mark XII mounts. Each side of the lower flight deck had a mount, and two were on the quarterdeck. The remaining twelve mounts were distributed along the sides of the ship. In refits in the mid-1930s, &quot;Courageous&quot; received three quadruple Mk VII mounts for 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; anti-aircraft guns, two of which were transferred from the battleship . Each side of the flying-off deck had a mount, forward of the 4.7-inch guns, and one was behind the island on the flight deck. She also received four water-cooled .50-calibre Mk III anti-aircraft machine guns in a single quadruple mounting. This was placed in a sponson on the port side aft.

The reconstruction was completed on 21 February 1928, and the ship spent the next several months on trials and training before she was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet to be based at Malta, in which she served from May 1928 to June 1930. In August 1929, the 1929 Palestine riots broke out, and &quot;Courageous&quot; was ordered to respond. When she arrived off Palestine, her air wing was disembarked to carry out operations to help to suppress the disorder. The ship was relieved from the Mediterranean by &quot;Glorious&quot; and refitted from June to August 1930. She was assigned to the Atlantic and Home Fleets from 12 August 1930 to December 1938, aside from a temporary attachment to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1936. In the early 1930s, traverse arresting gear was installed and she received two hydraulic aircraft catapults on the upper flight deck before March 1934. &quot;Courageous&quot; was refitted again between October 1935 and June 1936 with her pom-pom mounts. She was present at the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May 1937 for King George VI. The ship became a training carrier in December 1938 when joined the Home Fleet. She was relieved of that duty by her half-sister &quot;Furious&quot; in May 1939. &quot;Courageous&quot; participated in the Portland Fleet Review on 9 August 1939.

===Air group===
&quot;Courageous&quot; could carry up to 48 aircraft; following completion of her trials and embarking stores and personnel, she sailed for Spithead on 14 May 1928. The following day, a Blackburn Dart of 463 Flight made the ship&#x27;s first deck landing. The Dart was followed by the Fairey Flycatchers of 404 and 407 Flights, the Fairey IIIFs of 445 and 446 Flights and the Darts of 463 and 464 Flight. The ship sailed for Malta on 2 June to join the Mediterranean Fleet.

From 1933 to the end of 1938 &quot;Courageous&quot; carried No. 800 Squadron, which flew a mixture of nine Hawker Nimrod and three Hawker Osprey fighters. 810, 820 and 821 Squadrons were embarked for reconnaissance and anti-ship attack missions in the same period. They flew the Blackburn Baffin, the Blackburn Shark, the Blackburn Ripon and the Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers as well as Fairey Seal reconnaissance aircraft. As a deck landing training carrier, in early 1939 &quot;Courageous&quot; embarked the Blackburn Skua and Gloster Sea Gladiator fighters of 801 Squadron and the Swordfish torpedo bombers of 811 Squadron, although both of these squadrons were disembarked when the ship was relieved of her training duties in May.

==Second World War and sinking==

&quot;Courageous&quot; served with the Home Fleet at the start of World War II with 811 and 822 Squadrons aboard, each squadron equipped with a dozen Fairey Swordfish. In the early days of the war, hunter-killer groups were formed around the fleet&#x27;s aircraft carriers to find and destroy U-boats. On 31 August 1939 she went to her war station at Portland and embarked the two squadrons of Swordfish. &quot;Courageous&quot; departed Plymouth on the evening of 3 September 1939 for an anti-submarine patrol in the Western Approaches, escorted by four destroyers. On the evening of 17 September 1939, she was on one such patrol off the coast of Ireland. Two of her four escorting destroyers had been sent to help a merchant ship under attack and all her aircraft had returned from patrols. , commanded by Captain-Lieutenant Otto Schuhart, stalked &quot;Courageous&quot; for more than two hours. The carrier then turned into the wind to launch her aircraft. This put the ship right across the bow of the submarine, which fired three torpedoes. Two of the torpedoes struck the ship on her port side before any aircraft took off, knocking out all electrical power, and she capsized and sank in 20 minutes with the loss of 519 of her crew, including her captain. The US cargo ship &quot;Collingsworth&quot;, Ellerman Lines cargo ship &quot;Dido&quot;, and Dutch ocean liner rescued survivors. The two escorting destroyers counterattacked &quot;U-29&quot; for four hours, but the submarine escaped.
An earlier unsuccessful attack on &quot;Ark Royal&quot; by on 14 September, followed three days later by the sinking of &quot;Courageous,&quot; the first British ship sunk in the war in enemy action, prompted the Royal Navy to withdraw its carriers from anti-submarine patrols. &quot;Courageous&quot; was the first British warship to be sunk by German forces. (The submarine had been sunk a week earlier by friendly fire from the British submarine .) The commander of the German submarine force, Commodore Karl Dönitz, regarded the sinking of &quot;Courageous&quot; as &quot;a wonderful success&quot; and it led to widespread jubilation in the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; (German navy). Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, commander of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, directed that Schuhart be awarded the Iron Cross First Class and that all other members of the crew receive the Iron Cross Second Class.

<doc id="485400" wikidata="Q2744761" url="?curid=485400" title="Jim Bacon (politician)">
<text>James Alexander Bacon, AC (15 May 195020 June 2004) was an Australian politician who served as Premier of Tasmania from 1998 to 2004.

==Early life==
Bacon was born on 15 May 1950 in Melbourne; his father Frank, a doctor, died when Jim was twelve, leaving him to be raised by his mother Joan. He was educated at Scotch College and later studied politics at Monash University, but did not graduate. At Monash, Bacon was a Maoist student leader. Bacon moved to Western Australia and, after taking a job as a labourer, became an official of the Builders Labourers Federation, which then sent him to Tasmania as an organiser. He later became leader of the trade union movement as Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades &amp; Labor Council.

Bacon joined the Tasmanian branch of the Labor Party, and was elected to the House of Assembly in 1996, representing the Hobart-based seat of Denison. He became leader of the Tasmanian Labor Party in 1997 and narrowly won the state election in 1998, defeating the Liberal Party government under Tony Rundle. It was the first Labor majority since 1982. His government was re-elected in 2002 in a landslide victory for his party.

==Premier==
Bacon&#x27;s time in office was said to have been hugely successful, for the state economy as a whole, for his popularity with the people of the state, and also for tourism with the introduction of two more Bass Strait ferries, and beginning a ferry run between Devonport and Sydney. He controversially appointed Richard Butler to the office Governor of Tasmania in 2003. One of the Bacon Government&#x27;s most notable achievements was to wipe out a $1.6 billion state net debt in only six years. Other achievements included huge increases in tourist numbers, leading social policies, partnerships between state and local governments, turning Tasmanian Government entities, such as Hydro Tasmania, into profit-generating businesses (one of the election-winning strategies was to propose this as opposed to selling them), bringing two Australian Football League (AFL) clubs to play regular home and away matches in Tasmania (Hawthorn Football Club and St Kilda Football Club) and improving the general feeling of confidence in individuals and businesses within the state of Tasmania.

==Illness and death==
On Friday 13 February 2004, Bacon received the diagnosis that he was suffering from inoperable lung cancer. On 23 February 2004, he announced that he would take a four-week leave of absence from his role of Premier so that he could explore treatment options. After news that he had little time left, Bacon stood aside as Premier in March 2004, to spend whatever time was left to him with his family and friends. Paul Lennon, who had been Deputy Premier, succeeded Bacon to become Tasmania&#x27;s 42nd Premier.

Bacon, a 35-year smoker, died as a result of his cancer on 20 June 2004, at Calvary Hospital in Hobart. A state funeral was held on 24 June; many state and federal politicians (from both major parties) attended, including Liberal Prime Minister John Howard, all the state Premiers, Opposition Leader Mark Latham, former Opposition Leader Simon Crean, and former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.

==Honours and legacy==
In 2001 Bacon was awarded an honorary citizenship by Xi Jinping, then governor of Fujian Province. Bacon had first visited China while at university.

He was posthumously awarded the degree of Doctor of Laws honoris causa from the University of Tasmania in August 2004.

His appointment as a Companion of the Order of Australia was announced in June 2005 but made effective from 13 May 2004. The Order of Australia is not awarded posthumously, but Bacon had been nominated before his death.

The Jim Bacon Foundation was established in his honour to &quot;provide practical support and financial assistance to cancer patients and their families by making funds available to organisations that offer cancer treatment and palliative care services&quot;. The Foundation was absorbed into the Ricky Ponting Foundation in May 2013. The State Government will continue to fund the $30,000 Jim Bacon Memorial Scholarship at the University of Tasmania.

==Personal==
Jim Bacon had four sisters: Jenny, Wendy, Janet and Mary.

Bacon had a twenty-year partnership with Lynnette Francis, and they had two sons, Mark and Scott. Scott Bacon was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly at the 2010 state election.

Later Bacon married Honey Hogan, who had been a croupier and the public face of Australia&#x27;s first casino: Wrest Point Hotel Casino when it opened in 1973. That marriage gave him a stepson, Shane.

<doc id="485404" wikidata="Q10548391" url="?curid=485404" title="List of Sudbury schools">
<text>[[Sudbury school]]s practice a form of schooling in which students individually decide what to do with their time, and learn as a by-product of ordinary experience rather than through classes or a standard curriculum. Students have complete responsibility for their own education and the school is run by a direct democracy in which students and staff have an equal vote.

The &#x27;Sudbury&#x27; name refers to Sudbury Valley School, founded in 1968 in Framingham, Massachusetts. The Sudbury Valley School has been the inspiration for numerous schools many of which refer to themselves as &#x27;Sudbury schools.&#x27;

The Sudbury Valley School formally rejects the idea that there can be an official definition or official list of Sudbury schools and in 2016 ended its earlier practice of linking to other schools which claimed to operate in a manner similar to them. Daniel Greenberg, one of the founders of the Sudbury Valley School has written that there are two things that distinguish a Sudbury Model school: everyone is treated equally and there is no authority other than that granted by the consent of the school community.

<doc id="485405" wikidata="Q4115113" url="?curid=485405" title="List of superseded scientific theories">
<text>This list includes well-known general theories in science and pre-scientific natural philosophy and natural history that have since been superseded by other scientific theories. Many discarded explanations were once supported by a scientific consensus, but replaced after more empirical information became available that identified flaws and prompted new theories which better explain the available data. Pre-modern explanations originated before the scientific method, with varying degrees of empirical support. 

Some scientific theories are discarded in their entirety, such as the replacement of the phlogiston theory by energy and thermodynamics. Some theories known to be incomplete or in some ways incorrect are still used. For example, Newtonian classical mechanics is accurate enough for practical calculations at everyday distances and velocities, and it is still taught in schools. The more complicated relativistic mechanics must be used for long distances and velocities nearing the speed of light, and quantum mechanics for very small distances and objects.

Some aspects of discarded theories are reused in modern explanations. For example, miasma theory proposed that all diseases were transmitted by &quot;bad air&quot;. The modern germ theory of disease has found that diseases are caused by microorganisms, which can be transmitted by a variety of routes, including touching a contaminated object, blood, and contaminated water. Malaria was discovered to be a mosquito-borne disease, explaining why avoiding the &quot;bad air&quot; near swamps prevented it. Increasing ventilation of fresh air, one of the remedies proposed by miasma theory, does remain useful in some circumstances to expel germs spread by airborne transmission, such as SARS-CoV-2.

Some theories originate in, or are perpetuated by, pseudoscience, which claims to be both scientific and factual, but fails to follow the scientific method. Scientific theories are testable and make falsifiable predictions. Thus, it can be a mark of good science if a discipline has a growing list of superseded theories, and conversely, a lack of superseded theories can indicate problems in following the use of the scientific method. &quot;Fringe science&quot; includes theories that are not currently supported by a consensus in the mainstream scientific community, either because they never had sufficient empirical support, because they were previously mainstream but later disproven, or because they are preliminary theories also known as &quot;protoscience&quot; which go on to become mainstream after empirical confirmation. Some theories, such as Lysenkoism, race science or female hysteria have been generated for political rather than empirical reasons and promoted by force.

==Science==
===Discarded scientific theories===

====Biology====
* Spontaneous generation – a principle regarding the spontaneous generation of complex life from inanimate matter, which held that this process was a commonplace and everyday occurrence, as distinguished from univocal generation, or reproduction from parent(s). Falsified by an experiment by Louis Pasteur: where apparently spontaneous generation of microorganisms occurred, it did not happen on repeating the process without access to unfiltered air; on then opening the apparatus to the atmosphere, bacterial growth started.
* Transmutation of species, Inheritance of acquired characteristics, Lysenkoism – first theories of evolution. Not supported by experiment, and rendered obsolete by Darwinian evolution and Mendelian genetics, combined in the modern synthesis which finds that genes in the form of DNA are the primary way parental characteristics are passed to descendants. Discoveries in epigenetics have shown that in some very limited ways, the life experiences of organisms can affect the development of their children.
* Vitalism – the theory that living things are alive because of some &quot;vital force&quot; independent of matter, as opposed to because of some appropriate assembly of matter. It was gradually discredited by the rise of organic chemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology, fields that failed to discover any &quot;vital force.&quot; Friedrich Wöhler&#x27;s synthesis of urea from ammonium cyanate was only one step in a long road, not a great refutation.
* Maternal impression – the theory that the mother&#x27;s thoughts created birth defects. No experimental support (a notion rather than a theory), and rendered obsolete by genetic theory (see also fetal origins of adult disease, genomic imprinting).
* Preformationism – the theory that all organisms have existed since the beginning of life, and that gametes contain a miniature but complete preformed individual, and in the case of humans, a homunculus. No support when microscopy became available. Rendered obsolete by cytology, discovery of DNA, and atomic theory.
* Recapitulation theory – the theory that &quot;ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny&quot;. See Baer&#x27;s laws of embryology.
* Telegony – the theory that an offspring can inherit characteristics from a previous mate of its mother&#x27;s as well as its actual parents, often associated with racism.
* Out of Asia theory of human origin – The majority view is of a recent African origin of modern humans, although a multiregional origin of modern humans hypothesis has much support (which incorporates past evidence of Asian origins).
* Scientific racism – the theory that humanity consists of physically discrete superior or inferior races. Rendered obsolete by Human evolutionary genetics and modern anthropology.
* Mendelian genetics, classical genetics, Boveri–Sutton chromosome theory – first genetic theories. Not invalidated as such, but subsumed into molecular genetics.
* Germ line theory, explained immunoglobulin diversity by proposing that each antibody was encoded in a separate germline gene.

====Chemistry====
* Energeticism – a theory that attempted to reinterpret all chemistry in terms of energy, rejecting the concept of atoms.
* Caloric theory – the theory that a self-repelling fluid called &quot;caloric&quot; was the substance of heat. Rendered obsolete by the mechanical theory of heat. Origin of the calorie&#x27;s name, a unit of energy still used for nutrition in some countries.
* Classical elements – All matter was once thought composed of various combinations of classical elements (most famously air, earth, fire, and water). Antoine Lavoisier finally refuted this in his 1789 publication, &quot;Elements of Chemistry&quot;, which contained the first modern list of chemical elements.
* Electrochemical dualism – the theory that all molecules are salts composed of basic and acidic oxides
* Phlogiston theory – The theory that combustible goods contain a substance called &quot;phlogiston&quot; that entered air during combustion. Replaced by Lavoisier&#x27;s work on oxidation.
* Point 2 of Dalton&#x27;s Atomic Theory was rendered obsolete by discovery of isotopes, and point 3 by discovery of subatomic particles and nuclear reactions.
* Radical theory – the theory that organic compounds exist as combinations of radicals that can be exchanged in chemical reactions just as chemical elements can be interchanged in inorganic compounds.
* Vitalism – See section on Biology.
* Nascent state refers to the form of a chemical element (or sometimes compound) in the instance of their liberation or formation. Often encountered are atomic oxygen (Onasc) and nascent hydrogen (Hnasc), and chlorine (Clnasc) or bromine (Brnasc).
* Polywater, a hypothesized polymer form of water, the properties of which actually arose from contaminants such as sweat.

====Physics====
* Emission theory of vision – the belief that vision is caused by rays emanating from the eyes was superseded by the intro-mission approach and more complex theories of vision.
* Aristotelian physics – superseded by Newtonian physics.
* Ptolemy&#x27;s law of refraction, replaced by Snell&#x27;s law.
* Luminiferous aether – failed to be detected by the sufficiently sensitive Michelson–Morley experiment, made obsolete by Einstein&#x27;s work.
* Caloric theory – Lavoisier&#x27;s successor to phlogiston, discredited by Rumford&#x27;s and Joule&#x27;s work.
* Contact tension – a theory on the source of electricity.
* Vis viva – Gottfried Leibniz&#x27;s elementary and limited early formulation of the principle of conservation of energy.
* &quot;Purely electrostatic&quot; theories of the generation of voltage differences.
* Emitter theory – another now-obsolete theory of light propagation.
* – the original theory by Alessandro Volta misunderstood the active agent of a voltaic cell to be a new type of force acting on the charges generated merely from contact of the electrodes. Michael Faraday later correctly explained the active agent was chemical reactions.
* Balance of nature – superseded by catastrophe theory and chaos theory.
* Progression of atomic theory
** Democritus, the originator of atomic theory, held that everything is composed of atoms that are indestructible. His claim that atoms are indestructible is not the reason it is superseded—as it was later scientists who identified the concept of atoms with particles, which later science showed are destructible. Democritus&#x27; theory is superseded because of his position that several kinds of atoms explain pure materials like water or iron, and characteristics that science now identifies with molecules rather than with indestructible primary particles. Democritus also held that between atoms, an empty space of a different nature than atoms allowed atoms to move. This view on space and matter persisted until Einstein described spacetime as being relative and connected to matter.
** John Dalton&#x27;s model of the atom, which held that atoms are indivisible and indestructible (superseded by nuclear physics) and that all atoms of a given element are identical in mass (superseded by discovery of atomic isotopes).
** Plum pudding model of the atom—assuming the protons and electrons were mixed together in a single mass
** Rutherford model of the atom with an impenetrable nucleus orbited by electrons
** Bohr model with quantized orbits
** Electron cloud model following the development of quantum mechanics in 1925 and the eventual atomic orbital models derived from the quantum mechanical solution to the hydrogen atom

====Astronomy and cosmology====
* Ptolemaic system – superseded by Nicolaus Copernicus&#x27; heliocentric model.
* Geocentric universe – superseded by Copernicus
* Copernican system – superseded by Tychonic system
* Heliocentric universe – made obsolete by discovery of the structure of the Milky Way and the redshift of most galaxies. Heliocentrism only applies to the selected Solar System, and only approximately, since the Sun&#x27;s center is not at the Solar System&#x27;s center of mass. Superseded by barycentric coordinates.
* Aristotelian Dynamics of the celestial spheres superseded by the Elliptic orbit and Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion 
* Tychonic system – superseded by Newton&#x27;s laws of motion
* Luminiferous aether theory
* Static Universe theory
* Steady state theory, a model developed by Hermann Bondi, Thomas Gold, and Fred Hoyle whereby the expanding universe was in a steady state, and had no beginning. It was a competitor of the Big Bang model until evidence supporting the Big Bang and falsifying the steady state was found.

====Geography and climate====
* Buenaventura River
* Flat Earth theory, generally known to be false among educated people in various ancient and medieval societies
* Terra Australis, which technically is Antarctica, but the original idea was based on an unproven belief that land in the Northern hemisphere must have a Southern counterpart for balance.
* Hollow Earth theory
* The Open Polar Sea, an ice-free sea once supposed to surround the North Pole
* Rain follows the plow – the theory that human settlement increases rainfall in arid regions (only true to the extent that crop fields evapotranspirate more than barren wilderness)
* Island of California – the theory that California was not part of mainland North America but rather a large island
* Inland sea of Australia
* Pre-modern environmental determinism (as explanations for moral behavior, as opposed to modern theories such as factor endowments, state formation, and theories of the social effects of global warming)
**Climatic determinism
**Topographic determinism
**Moral geography
**Cultural acclimatization
* Global cooling
* Drainage divides as always being made up by hills and mountains.
* Ancient and medieval concepts surrounding the antipodes, including the related theories of antichthones and the alleged existence of a torrid zone

====Geology====
* Abiogenic petroleum origin – While some petroleum or natural gas is almost certainly abiogenic, the vast majority has origins as living organisms
* Catastrophism was largely replaced by uniformitarianism and neocatastrophism
* Cryptoexplosion craters, now discarded in favour of impact craters and ordinary volcanism.
* Flood geology replaced by modern geology and stratigraphy
* Neptunism replaced by plutonism and volcanism
* Granitization, a discredited alternative to a magmatic origin of granites
* Monoglaciation, the idea that the Earth had a single ice age, replaced by polyglaciation, the idea that the Earth has gone through several periods of widespread ice cover.
* Oscillation theory of land-level rise and subsidence during deglaciation
* The following were superseded by plate tectonics:
** Elevation crater theory
** Expanding Earth theory (superseded by subduction)
** Contracting Earth
** Geosyncline theory
** Haarman&#x27;s Oscillation theory
** Various lost landmasses including Lemuria

====Psychology====
* Pure behaviorist explanations for language acquisition in infancy, falsified by the study of cognitive adaptations for language.
* Psychomotor patterning, a pseudoscientific approach to the treatment of intellectual disabilities, brain injury, learning disabilities, and other cognitive diseases.

====Medicine====
* Theory of the four bodily humours (see also Four temperaments)
** Heroic medicine – a therapeutic method derived from the belief in bodily humour imbalances as the cause of ailments.
* Miasma theory of disease – the theory that diseases are caused by &quot;bad air&quot;. No experimental support, and rendered obsolete by the germ theory of disease.
* Phrenology – a theory of highly localised brain function popular in 19th century medicine.
* Homeopathy – a theory according to which a disease can be cured by infinitesimal doses of the substance that caused it
* Eclectic medicine – transformed into alternative medicine, and is no longer considered a scientific theory
* Physiognomy, related to phrenology, held that inner character was strongly correlated with physical appearance
* Tooth worm, an erroneous theory of the cause of dental caries, periodontitis, and toothaches

===Obsolete branches of enquiry===
* Alchemy, which led to the development of chemistry
* Astrology, which led to the development of astronomy
* Phrenology, a pseudoscience
* Numerology, a pseudoscience

===Theories now considered incomplete===
These theories that are no longer considered the most complete representation of reality but remain useful in particular domains or under certain conditions. For some theories, a more complete model is known, but for practical use, the coarser approximation provides good results with much less calculation.
* Newtonian mechanics was extended by the theory of relativity and by quantum mechanics. Relativistic corrections to Newtonian mechanics are immeasurably small at velocities not approaching the speed of light, and quantum corrections are usually negligible at atomic or larger scales; Newtonian mechanics is totally satisfactory in engineering and physics under most circumstances. The anomalous perihelion precession of Mercury was the first observational evidence that relativity was a more accurate model than Newtonian gravity.
* Classical electrodynamics is a very close approximation to quantum electrodynamics except at very small scales and low field strengths.
* The Bohr model of the atom was extended by the quantum mechanical model of the atom.
* The formula known as Newton&#x27;s sine-square law of air resistance for the force of a fluid on a body was not actually formulated by Newton but by others using a method of calculation used by Newton; it has been found incorrect and not useful except for high-speed hypersonic flow.
* The once-popular cycle of erosion is now considered one of many possibilities for landscape evolution.
* The theory of continental drift was incorporated into and improved upon by plate tectonics.
* Rational choice theory as a model of human behavior.

<text>The Irish Statute Book, also known as the electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB), is a database produced by the Office of the Attorney General of Ireland. It contains copies of Acts of the Oireachtas and statutory instruments. It also contains a Legislation Directory which includes chronological tables of pre-1922 legislation. It is published on a website (irishstatutebook.ie) and was formerly published on CD-ROM.

In 2001, the &quot;Irish Law Times&quot; said that, whilst the Attorney General&#x27;s staff deserved to be congratulated for the Irish Statute Book, the CD-ROM version contained a &quot;significant number of errors&quot;.

On 31 December 2021, Etisalat reported consolidated revenue of AED 53.3 billion and net profits of AED 11.1 billion. The total market capitalization of the company currently is AED329 billion. In May 2023, Etisalat reported revenue of AED13 billion for Q1.

Etisalat is one of the Internet hubs in the Middle East (AS8966), providing connectivity to other telecommunications operators in the region. It is also the largest carrier of international voice traffic in the Middle East and Africa and the 12th largest voice carrier in the world. As of October 2008, Etisalat has 510 roaming agreements covering 186 countries and enabling BlackBerry, 3G, GPRS and voice roaming. Etisalat operates Points of Presence (PoP) in New York, London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Paris, and Singapore. In December 2011 Etisalat announced the commercial launch of Etisalat 4G LTE Network. In May 2018 Etisalat announced the commercial launch of Etisalat 5G LTE Network, becoming the first telecom operator in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to do so. Etisalat also has &quot;check your mobile number&quot; service code for its user by dialing *101#.

On 24 February 2022, Etisalat Group launched a new brand identity called e&amp;. The group also announced that it will keep the previous branding identity in the UAE and internationally.

==History==

Etisalat was founded in 1976 as a joint-stock company between International Aeradio Limited, a British Company, and local partners. In 1983, the ownership structure changed – United Arab Emirates government held a 60% share in the company and the remaining 40% were publicly traded.

In 1991, the UAE central government issued Federal Law No. 1, which gave the corporation the right to provide the telecommunications wired and wireless services in the country and between UAE and other countries. It also gave the firm the right to issue licenses for owning, importing, manufacturing, using, or operating telecommunication equipment. This practically gave Etisalat both regulatory and control powers, which completed the monopoly of the telecom giant in the UAE. In order to safeguard the country&#x27;s economic development, the law made provisions for the development of the telecommunication sector in the country.

The increase of exchange lines from 36,000 in 1976 to more than 737,000 in 1998 was one of the important indicators of Etisalat network&#x27;s growth and development. Today Etisalat stands 140th among the Financial Times Top 500 Corporations in the world in terms of market capitalisation, and is ranked by The Middle East magazine as the 6th largest company in the Middle East in terms of capitalization and revenues. The Corporation is the largest contributor outside the oil sector to the development programmes of the UAE Federal Government. Etisalat has also won accolades from across the region for its nationalization programme. In November 2013, it was also announced that Etisalat would be the official sponsor of Cyprus First Division side Anorthosis Famagusta.

==e&amp;==

e&amp; is headquartered in Abu Dhabi and includes three regional offices – Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Northern Emirates. The Northern Emirates regional center is based in Sharjah and covers the telecom&#x27;s operations in the emirates of Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Fujairah, and Ras Al Khaimah.

In the UAE, e&amp; operates where mobile penetration is already among the highest in the world &quot;200%&quot;, Etisalat became known for its efforts to roll out its Fibre-To-The-Home (FTTH) network in the UAE. By the end of 2009, Etisalat had completed the FTTH roll-out for 85% of households in Abu Dhabi, positioning the UAE&#x27;s capital as the first in the world to be covered by fibre.

Some of the Internet services for home users that Etisalat offers include:
*3G Mobile Internet access
*4G Mobile Internet access
*Broadband Internet services (Al Shamil and eLife)
*Prepaid and post-paid dialup Internet access
*Cloud gaming services in partnership with Gamestream

e&amp; also operates iZone, a system of Wi-Fi hotspots in central locations, such as shopping malls, restaurants, and sheesha cafes. iZone can be accessed by either purchasing prepaid cards or using an existing account. Dial-up and ISDN Internet access services are billed by the hour, whereas the domestic and residential cable and DSL connections have a fixed monthly rate depending on speed. Etisalat has launched different internet packages for residential customers such as; Elife 10G and 5G, Ultra Fusion, and eLife Family. Other Internet links, aimed at business users, have traffic utilization plans and relatively high rates when exceeding the allocated bandwidth quota. This has caused bad publicity for Etisalat and is a major source of criticism. 

In addition to its telecommunication service provider and carrier units, e&amp; incorporates a number of additional non-telecom business units under the umbrella of Etisalat Services Holding LLC. These units support the company&#x27;s operations and even provide services to other operators and organizations in the UAE, namely: training and consultancy services (Etisalat Academy), SIM/smart card manufacturing and payment solutions (Ebtikar), data clearing house services (EDCH), peering/voice and data transit (Emirates Internet Exchange – EMIX), call center (The Contact Centre), cable TV (eVision), facilities management (EFM), as well as submarine cable laying services (eMarine).

Etisalat is a major investor in Thuraya (34.5%), a satellite geo-mobile communication systems provider. In 2006 Etisalat started a major restructuring program that resulted in the de-merger of many of its non-core business units operating under the telecom&#x27;s centralized and direct management; core services were consolidated and streamlined, reflecting the company&#x27;s shift from a technology-driven telecom to a customer-focused services provider. As part of the program, Etisalat launched a re-branding campaign, releasing a new corporate logo and identity in May 2006. The restructuring culminated in the incorporation of Etisalat Services Holding LLC, which as of 2008 oversees the operation of Etisalat&#x27;s non-telecom business units with huge success stories. On 27 March 2016, Saleh Al Abdooli was appointed the Group CEO, extending his responsibility to international operations. Al Abdooli resigned from the organization for personal reasons in May 2020 and Hatem Dowidar was appointed as the interim Group CEO who was later confirmed as the Group CEO on 16 December 2020.

On 1 June 2013, Etisalat introduced free local and national HD calls across the UAE. Later that week, corporate, private, public, and government sectors in the country were provided with better business IT solutions when Etisalat launched its first cloud service in the UAE.

* e&amp;&#x27;s telecommunications division in the UAE recently announced a groundbreaking achievement, setting a new world record for the fastest speed on a live 5G network, reaching 30.5 Gbps.

* This milestone was revealed during a demonstration at the 2024 SAMENA Leaders&#x27; Summit, where e&amp; showcased the successful carrier aggregation of high-band and mid-band spectrums (1600 MHz in mm Wave and 300 MHz in C-band), achieving unprecedented network speeds of 30.5 Gbps.

==International presence==

Etisalat International Investments was the business unit of Etisalat that operated telecom operations outside the UAE and managed the corporation&#x27;s stakes in telecommunications carriers in Afghanistan, Egypt, Niger, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan. The International Investments unit, and its management team, were re-structured into Etisalat Group, and Ahmad Abdulkarim Julfar was appointed as Group CEO in 2011, followed by Saleh Al Abdooli in 2016.

As of July 2021, Etisalat has presence and operations in 15 countries outside the United Arab Emirates.

As of 2023, Etisalat owns a stake of 14.6% in Vodafone Group one of Europe&#x27;s largest telecommunication groups. In 2024, the British government warned that e&amp;’s association with Vodafone poses a national security risk. Robert Buckland and Oliver Dowden also urged for measures to address national security concerns. They also asked for the establishment of an independent committee to monitor the risks associated with the stake held by e&amp; in Vodafone. Dowden said the committee should consist of Vodafone employees, while Buckland said the it should be independent of both e&amp; and Vodafone. Buckland said the committee members should be experts in national security, telecoms and human rights, pointing at the UAE’s “history of repressive activity and espionage”.

Etisalat also has a stake in PPF Telecom Group with a percentage of 50.1% which is active in Bulgaria, Hungary, Serbia and Slovakia as a telecommunications provider under the brand Yettel. In June 2024, Brussels announced its first anti-subsidy investigation, targeting e&amp;’s €2.2bn deal to acquire PPF group’s telecoms assets that was approved by national competition regulators. The European commission was concerned that to complete the acquisition, e&amp; received state funds, amounting to unfair subsidies. Another concern was if the state funds would allow E&amp; to outperform the EU rivals and undermine the competition.

===Mobily – Saudi Arabia===
One of Etisalat&#x27;s first international investments was the bid to become the second mobile services operator in Saudi Arabia. &quot;Mobily&quot;, the brand name of Etihad Etisalat founded in 2005 is currently the second largest mobile service provider in Saudi Arabia with over 20 million subscribers.

The venture, e&amp; Egypt, competes with existing service providers Vodafone and Orange. On 12 September 2006, it was announced that the network would be built by Ericsson of Sweden, and Huawei of China, at a cost of approximately 1 billion USD.

==Controversies==

===VoIP ban===
The United Arab Emirates blocks many popular voice over IP services like Skype. The only licensed VoIP service is BOTIM, which is operated by Etisalat.

===BlackBerry controversy===

In July 2009, Etisalat pushed an update to BlackBerry devices operating on the telecom&#x27;s national network, citing performance improvements. However, it was later discovered that the update contained eavesdropping software, developed by the US-based software development company SS8, which specializes in electronic surveillance. It is reported that the software enabled the company to monitor and forward communications on BlackBerry devices to their servers. Research in Motion, BlackBerry&#x27;s developer, acknowledged that the patch was a form of spyware, and issued a removal patch on 20 July.

On 27 December 2009, both Etisalat and du have been mandated by the UAE telecom regulator to start filtering BlackBerry users&#x27; web access and block illegal content. Due to concerns with the security and the provisioning of legal interception for Blackberry non-voice services, on 1 August 2010, the Telecommunication Regularity Authority of the UAE instructed Etisalat that all Blackberry e-mail, internet and messenger functions must be suspended on 1 October 2010. However, an agreement between Blackberry&#x27;s developer Research in Motion and UAE&#x27;s telecom regulator has been reached, and the announced BlackBerry services suspension has been canceled.

===Etisalat Iran===

In January 2009 Etisalat in consortium with Tamin Telecom (a subsidiary of the Iranian Social Security Organization (SSO)) won the bid for running the third mobile services operator in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The license included an exclusive two-year agreement for 3G services provisioning, but in Sep 2009 the license was revoked and given to its local partner, Tamin Telecom.

Etisalat had planned to invest over billion (AED 18.39 billion) over a period of five years, but following the license suspension all plans for launching operations in Iran have been put on hold.

===Etisalat India===

In 2009, Etisalat announced that its Indian unit, erstwhile Swan Telecom (owned by Dynamix Balwas Realty and Reliance Communications), headquartered in Mumbai, is renamed to Etisalat DB Telecom India Pvt. Ltd. The business unit has been awarded Unified Services Access License in 15 telecom circles (Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Mumbai, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu (including Chennai), Uttar Pradesh (East), Uttar Pradesh (West), Madhya Pradesh and Bihar). The brand name was &quot;Cheers Mobile&quot;.

In April 2010, Etisalat began signal testing in Chennai [IND 922], Delhi &amp; NCR [IND 913], Maharashtra &amp; Goa [IND 919], Mumbai [IND 916], and Gujarat [IND 914]. In May 2010, Etisalat was in talks to buy a 25% stake in Reliance Communications, but the deal was not finalised.

In 2010, following the billion 2G spectrum case, Etisalat DB, the Indian subsidiary of the company, was stopped from buying a stake in a Chennai-based company due to objections raised by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). Etisalat DB was not allowed to buy back the 5.27 percent stake held by Chennai-based Genex Exim Ventures since the home ministry raised objections based largely on security concerns. The MHA had pointed out four issues that needed to be resolved before allowing the company to come into Etisalat DB, a company that got scarce 2G spectrum at allegedly throwaway prices.

It raised objections about Etisalat&#x27;s presence in Pakistan and its connection with Pakistan&#x27;s intelligence agency ISI. Etisalat owns a 26% stake in Pakistan Telecommunications and has a subscriber base of 3 million in Afghanistan. The MHA has also expressed concerns about the telecom surveillance software Etisalat had used in a Blackberry service it had introduced in the UAE and recommended that the company should not be allowed to offer Blackberry services in India.

On 22 February 2012, Etisalat announced that it will cease operations in India post-cancellation of its licenses by the Supreme Court of India. It issued notice to its subscribers, giving them 30 days to change operators. On 5 September 2012, Etisalat announced that it would not bid for spectrum in the November 2012 2G spectrum auction. In a released statement the company said, &quot;Etisalat Group has decided not to participate in the auction as it is not willing to re-participate after being canceled its owned licenses. Following the publication by the Department of Telecomm (DoT) – India’s Ministry of Communications and Information Technology of the information memorandum for the planned auction of spectrum in 1800 MHz and 800 MHz bands, the Emirates Telecommunications Corporation (Etisalat) wishes to confirm that it has decided not to participate in the auction&quot;.

<text>In linear algebra, a Householder transformation (also known as a Householder reflection or elementary reflector) is a linear transformation that describes a reflection about a plane or hyperplane containing the origin. The Householder transformation was used in a 1958 paper by Alston Scott Householder.

Its analogue over general inner product spaces is the Householder operator.

==Definition==

===Transformation===

The reflection hyperplane can be defined by its &quot;normal vector&quot;, a unit vector formula_1 (a vector with length formula_2) that is orthogonal to the hyperplane. The reflection of a point formula_3 about this hyperplane is the linear transformation:

: formula_4

where formula_1 is given as a column unit vector with conjugate transpose formula_6, and considering formula_7 as a vector from the origin to the point formula_8.

===Householder matrix===

The matrix constructed from this transformation can be expressed in terms of an outer product as:

: formula_9

is known as the Householder matrix, where formula_10 is the identity matrix.

====Properties====

The Householder matrix has the following properties:
* it is Hermitian: formula_11,
* it is unitary: formula_12 (via the Sherman-Morrison formula),
* hence it is involutory: formula_13.
* A Householder matrix has eigenvalues formula_14. To see this, notice that if formula_15 is orthogonal to the vector formula_1 which was used to create the reflector, then formula_17, i.e., formula_2 is an eigenvalue of multiplicity formula_19, since there are formula_19 independent vectors orthogonal to formula_1. Also, notice formula_22 (since formula_23 is by definition a unit vector), and so formula_24 is an eigenvalue with multiplicity formula_2.
* The determinant of a Householder reflector is formula_24, since the determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues, in this case one of which is formula_24 with the remainder being formula_2 (as in the previous point), or via the Matrix determinant lemma.

====Example====

consider the normalization of a vector of 1&#x27;s 

formula_29

Then the Householder matrix corresponding to this vector is

formula_30

formula_31

formula_32

formula_33

Note that if we have a vector representing a coordinate in the 2D plane

formula_34

Then in this case formula_35 flips and negates the x and y coordinates, in other words

formula_36

Which corresponds to reflecting the vector across the line formula_37, which our original vector formula_38 is normal to.

==Applications==

===Geometric optics===

In geometric optics, specular reflection can be expressed in terms of the Householder matrix (see &quot;&quot;).

===Numerical linear algebra===

Householder transformations are widely used in numerical linear algebra, for example, to annihilate the entries below the main diagonal of a matrix, to perform QR decompositions and in the first step of the QR algorithm. They are also widely used for transforming to a Hessenberg form. For symmetric or Hermitian matrices, the symmetry can be preserved, resulting in tridiagonalization.

====QR decomposition====

Householder transformations can be used to calculate a QR decomposition. Consider a matrix tridiangularized up to column formula_39, then our goal is to construct such Householder matrices that act upon the principal submatrices of a given matrix

formula_40

via the matrix

formula_41.

(note that we already established before that Householder transformations are unitary matrices, and since the multiplication of unitary matrices is itself a unitary matrix, this gives us the unitary matrix of the QR decomposition)

If we can find a formula_23 so that

formula_43

we could accomplish this. Thinking geometrically speaking, we are looking for a plane so that the reflection of formula_44 about the plane happens to land directly on the basis vector. In other words,

for some constant formula_45. However, this also shows that

formula_46.

And since formula_23 is a unit vector, this means that

Now if we apply equation () back into equation ().

formula_48

Or, in other words, by comparing the scalars in front of the vector formula_49 we must have

formula_50.

Or

formula_51

Which means that we can solve for formula_45 as

formula_53

This completes the construction; however, in practice we want to avoid catastrophic cancellation in equation (). To do so, we choose the sign of formula_45 so that

formula_55
==== Tridiagonalization (Hessenberg) ====


This procedure is presented in Numerical Analysis by Burden and Faires, and works when the matrix is symmetric. In the non-symmetric case, it is still useful as a similar procedure can result in a Hessenberg matrix.

It uses a slightly altered formula_56 function with formula_57.
In the first step, to form the Householder matrix in each step we need to determine formula_58 and formula_59, which are:
:formula_60

From formula_58 and formula_59, construct vector formula_63:

:formula_64

where formula_65, formula_66, and 
:formula_67 for each formula_68

Then compute:
:formula_69

Having found formula_70 and computed formula_71 the process is repeated for formula_72 as follows:

:formula_73

Continuing in this manner, the tridiagonal and symmetric matrix is formed.

====Examples====

In this example, also from Burden and Faires, the given matrix is transformed to the similar tridiagonal matrix A3 by using the Householder method.

: formula_74

Following those steps in the Householder method, we have:

The first Householder matrix:
: formula_75

Used formula_76 to form
: formula_77

As we can see, the final result is a tridiagonal symmetric matrix which is similar to the original one. The process is finished after two steps.

====Quantum Computation====

As unitary matrices are useful in quantum computation, and Householder transformations are unitary, they are very useful in quantum computing. One of the central algorithms where they&#x27;re useful is Grover&#x27;s algorithm, where we are trying to solve for a representation of an oracle function represented by what turns out to be a Householder transformation:

formula_78

(here the formula_79 is part of the Bra-ket notation and is analogous to formula_7 which we were using previously)

This is done via an algorithm that iterates via the oracle function formula_81 and another operator formula_82 known as the &quot;Grover diffusion operator&quot; defined by

formula_83
and formula_84.

== Computational and theoretical relationship to other unitary transformations ==

The Householder transformation is a reflection about a hyperplane with unit normal vector formula_63, as stated earlier. An formula_86-by-formula_86 unitary transformation formula_88 satisfies formula_89. Taking the determinant (formula_86-th power of the geometric mean) and trace (proportional to arithmetic mean) of a unitary matrix reveals that its eigenvalues formula_91 have unit modulus. This can be seen directly and swiftly:
:formula_92

Since arithmetic and geometric means are equal if the variables are constant (see inequality of arithmetic and geometric means), we establish the claim of unit modulus.

For the case of real valued unitary matrices we obtain orthogonal matrices, formula_93. It follows rather readily (see orthogonal matrix) that any orthogonal matrix can be decomposed into a product of 2 by 2 rotations, called Givens Rotations, and Householder reflections. This is appealing intuitively since multiplication of a vector by an orthogonal matrix preserves the length of that vector, and rotations and reflections exhaust the set of (real valued) geometric operations that render invariant a vector&#x27;s length.

The Householder transformation was shown to have a one-to-one relationship with the canonical coset decomposition of unitary matrices defined in group theory, which can be used to parametrize unitary operators in a very efficient manner.

Finally we note that a single Householder transform, unlike a solitary Givens transform, can act on all columns of a matrix, and as such exhibits the lowest computational cost for QR decomposition and tridiagonalization. The penalty for this &quot;computational optimality&quot; is, of course, that Householder operations cannot be as deeply or efficiently parallelized. As such Householder is preferred for dense matrices on sequential machines, whilst Givens is preferred on sparse matrices, and/or parallel machines.

<text>The Advanced Boolean Expression Language (ABEL) is an obsolete hardware description language (HDL) and an associated set of design tools for programming programmable logic devices (PLDs). It was created in 1983 by Data I/O Corporation, in Redmond, Washington.

ABEL includes both concurrent equation and truth table logic formats as well as a sequential state machine description format. A preprocessor with syntax loosely based on Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s MACRO-11 assembly language is also included.

In addition to being used for describing digital logic, ABEL may also be used to describe test vectors (patterns of inputs and expected outputs) that may be downloaded to a hardware PLD programmer along with the compiled and fuse-mapped PLD programming data.

Other PLD design languages originating in the same era include CUPL and PALASM. Since the advent of larger field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), PLD-specific HDLs have fallen out of favor as standard HDLs such as Verilog and VHDL gained adoption.

The ABEL concept and original compiler were created by Russell de Pina of Data I/O&#x27;s Applied Research Group in 1981. The work was continued by ABEL product development team (led by Dr. Kyu Y. Lee) and included Mary Bailey, Bjorn Benson, Walter Bright, Michael Holley, Charles Olivier, and David Pellerin.

After a series of acquisitions, the ABEL toolchain and intellectual property were bought by Xilinx. Xilinx discontinued support for ABEL in its ISE Design Suite starting with version 11 (released in 2010).

<text>Chinese martial arts, commonly referred to with umbrella terms [[Kung fu (term)|kung fu]] (; ), kuoshu () or [[wushu (sport)|wushu]] (), are multiple fighting styles that have developed over the centuries in Greater China. These fighting styles are often classified according to common traits, identified as &quot;families&quot; of martial arts. Examples of such traits include &quot;Shaolinquan&quot; () physical exercises involving All Other Animals () mimicry or training methods inspired by Old Chinese philosophies, religions and legends. Styles that focus on qi manipulation are called &quot;internal&quot; (; ), while others that concentrate on improving muscle and cardiovascular fitness are called &quot;external&quot; (; ). Geographical associations, as in &quot;northern&quot; (; ) and &quot;southern&quot; (; ), is another popular classification method.

==Terminology==

&quot;Kung fu&quot; and &quot;wushu&quot; are loanwords from Cantonese and Mandarin respectively that, in English, are used to refer to Chinese martial arts. However, the Chinese terms &quot;kung fu&quot; and &quot;wushu&quot; (; ) have distinct meanings. The Chinese equivalent of the term &quot;Chinese martial arts&quot; would be &quot;Zhongguo wushu&quot; () (Mandarin).

In Chinese, the term &quot;kung fu&quot; refers to any skill that is acquired through learning or practice. It is a compound word composed of the words 功 (gōng) meaning &quot;work&quot;, &quot;achievement&quot;, or &quot;merit&quot;, and 夫 (fū) which is a particle or nominal suffix with diverse meanings.

&quot;Wushu&quot; literally means &quot;martial art&quot;. It is formed from the two Chinese characters : (), meaning &quot;&quot; or &quot;military&quot; and or 术 (), which translates into &quot;art&quot;, &quot;discipline&quot;, &quot;skill&quot; or &quot;&quot;. The term &quot;wushu&quot; has also become the name for the modern sport of &quot;wushu&quot;, an exhibition and full-contact sport of bare-handed and weapon forms (), adapted and judged to a set of aesthetic criteria for points developed since 1949 in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

&quot;Quánfǎ&quot; () is another Chinese term for Chinese martial arts. It means &quot;fist method&quot; or &quot;the law of the fist&quot; (&quot;quán&quot; means &quot;boxing&quot; or &quot;fist&quot;, and &quot;fǎ&quot; means &quot;law&quot;, &quot;way&quot; or &quot;method&quot;), although as a compound term it usually translates as &quot;boxing&quot; or &quot;fighting technique.&quot; The name of the Japanese martial art kempō is represented by the same hanzi characters.

==History==
The genesis of Chinese martial arts has been attributed to the need for self-defense, hunting techniques and military training in ancient China. Hand-to-hand combat and weapons practice were important in training ancient Chinese soldiers.

Detailed knowledge about the state and development of Chinese martial arts became available from the Nanjing decade (1928–1937), as the Central Guoshu Institute established by the Kuomintang regime made an effort to compile an encyclopedic survey of martial arts schools.
Since the 1950s, the People&#x27;s Republic of China has organized Chinese martial arts as an exhibition and full-contact sport under the heading of &quot;&quot;wushu&quot;&quot;.

===Legendary origins===
According to legend, Chinese martial arts originated before the semi-mythical Xia dynasty over 4,000 years ago. It is said that the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi), who ascended to power in 2698 BC, introduced the earliest fighting systems to China. The Emperor is renowned as a great general who, prior to becoming China&#x27;s leader, authored extensive treatises on medicine, astrology, and the martial arts. One of his primary adversaries was Chi You, credited as the progenitor of jiao di, a precursor to modern Chinese wrestling.

===Early history===
The earliest references to Chinese martial arts are found in the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot; (5th century BC), where a hand-to-hand combat theory, one that integrates notions of &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; techniques, is mentioned. A combat wrestling system called &quot;juélì&quot; or &quot;jiǎolì&quot; () is mentioned in the &quot;Classic of Rites&quot;. This combat system included techniques such as strikes, throws, joint manipulation, and pressure point attacks.
Jiao Di became a sport during the Qin dynasty (221–207 BC). The &quot;Han History Bibliographies&quot; record that, by the Former Han (206 BC – 8 AD), there was a distinction between no-holds-barred weaponless fighting, which it calls &quot;shǒubó&quot; (), for which training manuals had already been written, and sportive wrestling, then known as juélì ().
Wrestling is also documented in the Shǐ Jì, &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, written by Sima Qian (ca. 100 BC).

In the Tang dynasty, descriptions of sword dances were immortalized in poems by Li Bai. In the Song and Yuan dynasties, xiangpu(相扑) contests were sponsored by the imperial courts. The modern concepts of wushu were fully developed by the Ming and Qing dynasties.

====Philosophical influences====
The ideas associated with Chinese martial arts changed with the evolution of Chinese society and over time acquired some philosophical bases: Passages in the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; (), a Taoist text, pertain to the psychology and practice of martial arts. Zhuangzi, its eponymous author, is believed to have lived in the [4th century BC]. The &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, often credited to Laozi, is another Taoist text that contains principles applicable to martial arts. According to one of the classic texts of Confucianism, &quot;Zhou Li&quot; (), Archery and charioteering were part of the &quot;six arts&quot; (, including rites, music, calligraphy and mathematics) of the Zhou dynasty (1122–256 BC). &quot;The Art of War&quot; (), written during the [6th century BC] by Sun Tzu (), deals directly with military warfare but contains ideas that are used in the Chinese martial arts.

Taoist practitioners have been practicing &quot;daoyin&quot; (physical exercises similar to qigong that was one of the progenitors to tai chi) from as early as 500 BC. In 39–92 AD, &quot;Six Chapters of Hand Fighting&quot;, were included in the &quot;Han Shu&quot; (history of the Former Han dynasty) written by Ban Gu. Also, the noted physician, Hua Tuo, composed the &quot;Five Animals Play&quot;—tiger, deer, monkey, bear, and bird, around 208 AD. Taoist philosophy and their approach to health and exercise have influenced the Chinese martial arts to a certain extent. Direct reference to Taoist concepts can be found in such styles as the &quot;Eight Immortals,&quot; which uses fighting techniques attributed to the characteristics of each immortal.

===Southern and Northern dynasties (420–589 AD)===

====Shaolin temple established====
In 495 AD, the first Shaolin temple was constructed on Song Mountain in Henan province. The initial Buddhist monk who propagated Buddhism there was an Indian monk named Buddhabhadra, known as Batuo in Chinese. Historical records suggest that Batuo&#x27;s first Chinese disciples, Huiguang and Sengchou, possessed exceptional martial skills. For instance, Sengchou&#x27;s proficiency with the tin staff is documented in the Chinese Buddhist canon. Following Buddhabhadra, another Indian monk named Bodhidharma, also known as Damo in Chinese, arrived at Shaolin in 527 AD. His Chinese disciple, Huike, was likewise a highly skilled martial artist. There are indications that these first three Chinese Shaolin monks—Huiguang, Sengchou, and Huike—may have had a military background prior to embracing monastic life.

===Shaolin and temple-based martial arts===

The Shaolin style of kung fu is considered one of the earliest organized Chinese martial arts. The oldest documented evidence of Shaolin&#x27;s involvement in combat dates back to a stele from 728 AD, which records two significant events: the defense of the Shaolin Monastery against bandits around 610 AD and their subsequent contribution to the defeat of Wang Shichong at the Battle of Hulao in 621 AD. However, between the 8th and 15th centuries, there are no surviving records that provide concrete proof of Shaolin&#x27;s involvement in combat activities.

Between the 16th and 17th centuries, at least forty sources exist to provide evidence both that monks of Shaolin practiced martial arts, and that martial practice became an integral element of Shaolin monastic life. The earliest appearance of the frequently cited legend concerning Bodhidharma&#x27;s supposed foundation of Shaolin kung fu dates to this period. The origin of this legend has been traced to the Ming period&#x27;s &quot;Yijin Jing&quot; or &quot;Muscle Change Classic&quot;, a text written in 1624 attributed to Bodhidharma. 
References of martial arts practice in Shaolin appear in various literary genres of the late Ming: the epitaphs of Shaolin warrior monks, martial-arts manuals, military encyclopedias, historical writings, travelogues, fiction, and poetry. However, these sources do not point out any specific style that originated in Shaolin. These sources, in contrast to those from the Tang period, refer to Shaolin methods of armed combat. These include a skill for which Shaolin monks became famous: the staff (&quot;gùn&quot;, Cantonese &quot;gwan&quot;). The Ming general Qi Jiguang included a description of Shaolin kung fu and staff techniques in his book, &quot;Jixiao Xinshu&quot;, which can translate as &quot;New Book Recording Effective Techniques&quot;. When this book spread across East Asia, it had a great influence on the development of martial arts in regions such as Okinawa and Korea.

===Modern history===
====Republican period====
Most fighting styles that are being practiced as traditional Chinese martial arts today reached their popularity within the 20th century. Some of these include Baguazhang, Drunken Boxing, Eagle Claw, Five Animals, Xingyi, Hung Gar, Monkey, Bak Mei Pai, Northern Praying Mantis, Southern Praying Mantis, Fujian White Crane, Jow Ga, Wing Chun and tai chi. The increase in the popularity of those styles is a result of the dramatic changes occurring within the Chinese society.

In 1900–01, the Righteous and Harmonious Fists rose against foreign occupiers and Christian missionaries in China. This uprising is known in the West as the Boxer Rebellion due to the martial arts and calisthenics practiced by the rebels. Empress Dowager Cixi gained control of the rebellion and tried to use it against the foreign powers. The failure of the rebellion led ten years later to the fall of the Qing dynasty and the creation of the Chinese Republic.

The present view of Chinese martial arts is strongly influenced by the events of the Republican period (1912–1949). In the transition period between the fall of the Qing dynasty as well as the turmoil of the Japanese invasion and the Chinese Civil War, Chinese martial arts became more accessible to the general public as many martial artists were encouraged to openly teach their art. At that time, some considered martial arts as a means to promote national pride and build a strong nation. As a result, many training manuals (拳譜) were published, a training academy was created, two national examinations were organized and demonstration teams traveled overseas. Numerous martial arts associations were formed throughout China and in various overseas Chinese communities. The Central Guoshu Academy (Zhongyang Guoshuguan, 中央國術館) established by the National Government in 1928 and the Jing Wu Athletic Association (精武體育會) founded by Huo Yuanjia in 1910 are examples of organizations that promoted a systematic approach for training in Chinese martial arts. A series of provincial and national competitions were organized by the Republican government starting in 1932 to promote Chinese martial arts. In 1936, at the 11th Olympic Games in Berlin, a group of Chinese martial artists demonstrated their art to an international audience for the first time.

The term &quot;kuoshu&quot; (or &quot;guoshu&quot;, meaning &quot;national art&quot;), rather than the colloquial term gongfu was introduced by the Kuomintang in an effort to more closely associate Chinese martial arts with national pride rather than individual accomplishment.

====People&#x27;s Republic====
Chinese martial arts experienced rapid international dissemination with the end of the Chinese Civil War and the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on October 1, 1949. Many well known martial artists chose to escape from the PRC&#x27;s rule and migrate to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other parts of the world. Those masters started to teach within the overseas Chinese communities but eventually they expanded their teachings to include people from other ethnic groups.

Within China, the practice of traditional martial arts was discouraged during the turbulent years of the Chinese Cultural Revolution (1969–1976). Like many other aspects of traditional Chinese life, martial arts were subjected to a radical transformation by the People&#x27;s Republic of China to align them with Maoist revolutionary doctrine. The PRC promoted the committee-regulated sport of Wushu as a replacement for independent schools of martial arts. This new competition sport was disassociated from what was seen as the potentially subversive self-defense aspects and family lineages of Chinese martial arts.

In 1958, the government established the All-China Wushu Association as an umbrella organization to regulate martial arts training. The Chinese State Commission for Physical Culture and Sports took the lead in creating standardized forms for most of the major arts. During this period, a national Wushu system that included standard forms, teaching curriculum, and instructor grading was established. Wushu was introduced at both the high school and university level. The suppression of traditional teaching was relaxed during the Era of Reconstruction (1976–1989), as Communist ideology became more accommodating to alternative viewpoints. In 1979, the State Commission for Physical Culture and Sports created a special task force to reevaluate the teaching and practice of Wushu.
In 1986, the Chinese National Research Institute of Wushu was established as the central authority for the research and administration of Wushu activities in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Changing government policies and attitudes towards sports, in general, led to the closing of the State Sports Commission (the central sports authority) in 1998. This closure is viewed as an attempt to partially de-politicize organized sports and move Chinese sport policies towards a more market-driven approach. As a result of these changing sociological factors within China, both traditional styles and modern Wushu approaches are being promoted by the Chinese government.

Chinese martial arts are an integral element of 20th-century Chinese popular culture.
Wuxia or &quot;martial arts fiction&quot; is a popular genre that emerged in the early 20th century and peaked in popularity during the 1960s to 1980s. Wuxia films were produced from the 1920s. The Kuomintang suppressed wuxia, accusing it of promoting superstition and violent anarchy. Because of this, wuxia came to flourish in British Hong Kong, and the genre of kung fu movie in Hong Kong action cinema became wildly popular, coming to international attention from the 1970s. The genre underwent a drastic decline in the late 1990s as the Hong Kong film industry was crushed by economic depression.

In the wake of Ang Lee&#x27;s &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; (2000), there has been somewhat of a revival of Chinese-produced wuxia films aimed at an international audience, including Zhang Yimou&#x27;s &quot;Hero&quot; (2002), &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; (2004) and &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower&quot; (2006), as well as Su Chao-pin and John Woo&#x27;s &quot;Reign of Assassins&quot; (2010).

==Styles==

China boasts a rich history of martial arts traditions encompassing numerous styles, totaling in the hundreds. Over the course of the past two millennia, a multitude of distinct styles have been developed, each with its own unique techniques and philosophies. These styles are often categorized into &quot;families&quot; (家; jiā), &quot;schools&quot; (派; pai), or &quot;sects&quot; (門; men). While each style possesses its own characteristics, there are also common themes that thread through different styles.

Some styles draw inspiration from animal movements, replicating the agility and power of creatures such as tigers, snakes, or monkeys. Others derive their inspiration from Chinese philosophies, myths, and legends, incorporating their principles and symbolism into their techniques. Certain styles place significant emphasis on harnessing and manipulating &quot;qi&quot;, while others prioritize competitive aspects, focusing on sparring and tournaments.

Chinese martial arts can be split into various categories to differentiate them: For example, &quot;external&quot; () and &quot;internal&quot; (). Chinese martial arts can also be categorized by location, as in &quot;northern&quot; and &quot;southern&quot; as well, referring to what part of China the styles originated from, separated by the Yangtze River; Chinese martial arts may even be classified according to their province or city. The main perceived difference between northern and southern styles is that the northern styles tend to emphasize fast and powerful kicks, high jumps and generally fluid and rapid movement, while the southern styles focus more on strong arm and hand techniques, and stable, immovable stances and fast footwork. Examples of the northern styles include changquan and xingyiquan. Examples of the southern styles include Bak Mei, Wuzuquan, Choy Li Fut, and Wing Chun. Chinese martial arts can also be divided according to religion, imitative-styles (), and family styles such as Hung Gar (). There are distinctive differences in the training between different groups of the Chinese martial arts regardless of the type of classification. However, few experienced martial artists make a clear distinction between internal and external styles, or subscribe to the idea of northern systems being predominantly kick-based and southern systems relying more heavily on upper-body techniques. Most styles contain both hard and soft elements, regardless of their internal nomenclature. Analyzing the difference in accordance with yin and yang principles, philosophers would assert that the absence of either one would render the practitioner&#x27;s skills unbalanced or deficient, as yin and yang alone are each only half of a whole. If such differences did once exist, they have since been blurred.

==Training==

Chinese martial arts training consists of the following components: basics, forms, applications and weapons; different styles place varying emphasis on each component. In addition, philosophy, ethics and even medical practice are highly regarded by most Chinese martial arts. A complete training system should also provide insight into Chinese attitudes and culture.

Moreover, many Chinese martial arts styles integrate traditional medical practices into their training. This includes the understanding of meridians, pressure points, and herbal remedies, as well as exercises that promote health, vitality, and longevity. The holistic approach to training seeks to cultivate both internal and external strength, promoting overall well-being and balance.

Furthermore, Chinese martial arts serve as a vessel for preserving and transmitting cultural values and attitudes. Respect for teachers, dedication, discipline, and perseverance are instilled in practitioners, fostering a sense of community and loyalty within martial arts schools and lineages. Chinese martial arts also often incorporate cultural elements such as music, costumes, and rituals, further deepening the connection to Chinese heritage and traditions.

Overall, Chinese martial arts encompass not just physical techniques but a comprehensive system that encompasses philosophy, ethics, medical knowledge, and cultural appreciation. It is this holistic approach that distinguishes Chinese martial arts as not just a means of self-defense but as a way of life, promoting personal growth, cultural understanding, and the pursuit of harmony and excellence.

===Basics===
The &quot;Basics&quot; () are a vital part of any martial training, as a student cannot progress to the more advanced stages without them. Basics are usually made up of rudimentary techniques, conditioning exercises, including stances. Basic training may involve simple movements that are performed repeatedly; other examples of basic training are stretching, meditation, striking, throwing, or jumping. Without strong and flexible muscles, management of &quot;qi&quot; or breath, and proper body mechanics, it is impossible for a student to progress in the Chinese martial arts. A common saying concerning basic training in Chinese martial arts is as follows:
Which translates as:

===Stances===
Stances (steps or 步法) are structural postures employed in Chinese martial arts training. They represent the foundation and the form of a fighter&#x27;s base. Each style has different names and variations for each stance. Stances may be differentiated by foot position, weight distribution, body alignment, etc. Stance training can be practiced statically, the goal of which is to maintain the structure of the stance through a set time period, or dynamically, in which case a series of movements is performed repeatedly. The Horse stance (; ) and the bow stance are examples of stances found in many styles of Chinese martial arts.

===Meditation===
In many Chinese martial arts, meditation is considered to be an important component of basic training. Meditation can be used to develop focus, mental clarity and can act as a basis for &quot;qigong&quot; training. Through meditation, martial arts practitioners learn to regulate their breath, relax their bodies, and enter a state of deep focus. This kind of concentration helps them to stay present in their movements and techniques, enhancing their responsiveness and physical coordination. Meditation also cultivates the ability for introspection, enabling practitioners to become more keenly aware of their bodily sensations, energy flow, and inner state. Meditation is also closely related to &quot;qigong&quot;. Through the concentration and adjustments achieved through meditation, martial arts practitioners can better perceive and direct the internal energy (known as &quot;qi&quot; in &quot;qigong&quot;). They learn to manipulate the flow of &quot;qi&quot; through deep breathing and visualization exercises to promote bodily balance, harmony, and health. Therefore, meditation, as a part of foundational training, offers Chinese martial arts practitioners a comprehensive approach to cultivating both the internal and external aspects. It assists them in developing various aspects of their body, energy, and mind, thereby enhancing their technical skills.

===Use of &quot;qi&quot;===

The concept of &quot;qi&quot; is encountered in a number of Chinese martial arts. &quot;Qi&quot; is variously defined as an inner energy or &quot;life force&quot; that is said to animate living beings; as a term for proper skeletal alignment and efficient use of musculature (sometimes also known as &quot;fa jin&quot; or &quot;jin&quot;); or as a shorthand for concepts that the martial arts student might not yet be ready to understand in full. These meanings are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The existence of &quot;qi&quot; as a measurable form of energy as discussed in traditional Chinese medicine has no basis in the scientific understanding of physics, medicine, biology or human physiology.

There are many ideas regarding the control of one&#x27;s qi energy to such an extent that it can be used for healing oneself or others. Some styles believe in focusing &quot;qi&quot; into a single point when attacking and aim at specific areas of the human body. Such techniques are known as dim mak and have principles that are similar to acupressure.

===Weapons training===

Most Chinese styles also make use of training in the broad arsenal of Chinese weapons for conditioning the body as well as coordination and strategy drills. Weapons training (; ) is generally carried out after the student becomes proficient with the basic forms and applications training. The basic theory for weapons training is to consider the weapon as an extension of the body. It has the same requirements for footwork and body coordination as the basics. The process of weapon training proceeds with forms, forms with partners and then applications. Most systems have training methods for each of the Eighteen Arms of Wushu (; ) in addition to specialized instruments specific to the system.

===Application===
&quot;Application&quot; refers to the practical use of combative techniques. Chinese martial arts techniques are ideally based on efficiency and effectiveness. Application includes non-compliant drills, such as Pushing Hands in many internal martial arts, and sparring, which occurs within a variety of contact levels and rule sets.

When and how applications are taught varies from style to style. Today, many styles begin to teach new students by focusing on exercises in which each student knows a prescribed range of combat and technique to drill on. These drills are often semi-compliant, meaning one student does not offer active resistance to a technique, in order to allow its demonstrative, clean execution. In more resisting drills, fewer rules apply, and students practice how to react and respond. &#x27;Sparring&#x27; refers to a more advanced format, which simulates a combat situation while including rules that reduce the chance of serious injury.

Competitive sparring disciplines include Chinese kickboxing Sǎnshǒu () and Chinese folk wrestling Shuāijiāo (), which were traditionally contested on a raised platform arena, or Lèitái (). Lèitái were used in public challenge matches first appeared in the Song dynasty. The objective for those contests was to knock the opponent from a raised platform by any means necessary.
San Shou represents the modern development of Lei Tai contests, but with rules in place to reduce the chance of serious injury. Many Chinese martial art schools teach or work within the rule sets of Sanshou, working to incorporate the movements, characteristics, and theory of their style. Chinese martial artists also compete in non-Chinese or mixed Combat sport, including boxing, kickboxing and Mixed martial arts.

===Forms (&quot;taolu&quot;)===

&quot;Forms&quot; or &quot;taolu&quot; () in Chinese are series of predetermined movements combined so they can be practiced as a continuous set of movements. Forms were originally intended to preserve the lineage of a particular style branch, and were often taught to advanced students selected for that purpose. Forms contained both literal, representative and exercise-oriented forms of applicable techniques that students could extract, test, and train in through sparring sessions.

Today, many consider &quot;taolu&quot; to be one of the most important practices in Chinese martial arts. Traditionally, they played a smaller role in training for combat application and took a back seat to sparring, drilling, and conditioning. Forms gradually build up a practitioner&#x27;s flexibility, internal and external strength, speed and stamina, and they teach balance and coordination. Many styles contain forms that use weapons of various lengths and types, using one or two hands. Some styles focus on a certain type of weapon. Forms are meant to be both practical, usable, and applicable as well as to promote fluid motion, meditation, flexibility, balance, and coordination. Students are encouraged to visualize an attacker while training the form.

There are two general types of &quot;taolu&quot; in Chinese martial arts. Most common are &quot;solo forms&quot; performed by a single student. There are also &quot;sparring&quot; forms — choreographed fighting sets performed by two or more people. Sparring forms were designed both to acquaint beginning fighters with basic measures and concepts of combat and to serve as performance pieces for the school. Weapons-based sparring forms are especially useful for teaching students the extension, range, and technique required to manage a weapon.

====Forms in traditional Chinese martial arts====
The term &quot;taolu (套路)&quot; is a shortened version of &quot;Tao Lu Yun Dong (套路運動)&quot;, an expression introduced only recently with the popularity of modern wushu. This expression refers to &quot;exercise sets&quot; and used in the context of athletics or sport.

In contrast, in traditional Chinese martial arts alternative terminologies for the training (練) of &#x27;sets or forms &quot;are:&quot;

* lian quan tao (練拳套) – practicing a sequence of fists.
* lian quan jiao (練拳腳) – practicing fists and feet.
* lian bing qi (練兵器) – practicing weapons.
* dui da (對打) and dui lian (對練) – fighting sets.

Traditional &quot;sparring&quot; sets, called &quot;dui da&quot; (對打) or &quot;dui lian&quot; (對練), were an essential part of Chinese martial arts for centuries. &quot;Dui lian&quot; means to train by a pair of combatants opposing each other—the character &quot;lian&quot; (練), refers to practice; to train; to perfect one&#x27;s skill; to drill. As well, often one of these terms are also included in the name of fighting sets (雙演; &quot;shuang yan&quot;), &quot;paired practice&quot; (掙勝; &quot;zheng sheng&quot;), &quot;to struggle with strength for victory&quot; (敵; &quot;di&quot;), match – the character suggests to strike an enemy; and &quot;to break&quot; (破; &quot;po&quot;).

Generally, there are 21, 18, 12, 9 or 5 drills or &#x27;exchanges/groupings&#x27; of attacks and counterattacks, in each &quot;dui lian&quot; set. These drills were considered only generic patterns and never meant to be considered inflexible &#x27;tricks&#x27;. Students practiced smaller parts/exchanges, individually with opponents switching sides in a continuous flow. &quot;Dui lian&quot; were not only sophisticated and effective methods of passing on the fighting knowledge of the older generation, but they were also essential and effective training methods. The relationship between single sets and contact sets is complicated, in that some skills cannot be developed with solo &#x27;sets&#x27;, and, conversely, with &quot;dui lian&quot;. Unfortunately, it appears that most traditional combat oriented &quot;dui lian&quot; and their training methodology have disappeared, especially those concerning weapons. There are several reasons for this. In modern Chinese martial arts, most of the &quot;dui lian&quot; are recent inventions designed for light props resembling weapons, with safety and drama in mind. The role of this kind of training has degenerated to the point of being useless in a practical sense, and, at best, is just performance.

By the early Song period, sets were not so much &quot;individual isolated technique strung together&quot; but rather were composed of techniques and counter technique groupings. It is quite clear that &quot;sets&quot; and &quot;fighting (two-person) sets&quot; have been instrumental in traditional Chinese martial arts for many hundreds of years—even before the Song dynasty. There are images of two-person weapon training in Chinese stone painting going back at least to the Eastern Han dynasty.

According to what has been passed on by the older generations, the approximate ratio of contact sets to single sets was approximately 1:3. In other words, about 30% of the &#x27;sets&#x27; practiced at Shaolin were contact sets, &quot;dui lian&quot;, and two-person drill training. This ratio is, in part, evidenced by the Qing dynasty mural at Shaolin.

For most of its history, Shaolin martial arts was mostly weapon-focused: staves were used to defend the monastery, not bare hands. Even the more recent military exploits of Shaolin during the Ming and Qing dynasties involved weapons. According to some traditions, monks first studied basics for one year and were then taught staff fighting so that they could protect the monastery. Although wrestling has been a sport in China for centuries, weapons have been an essential part of Chinese wushu since ancient times. If one wants to talk about recent or &#x27;modern&#x27; developments in Chinese martial arts (including Shaolin for that matter), it is the over-emphasis on bare hand fighting. During the Northern Song dynasty (976–997 A.D.) when platform fighting is known as &quot;Da Laitai&quot; (Title Fights Challenge on Platform) first appeared, these fights were with only swords and staves. Although later, when bare hand fights appeared as well, it was the weapons events that became the most famous. These open-ring competitions had regulations and were organized by government organizations; the public also organized some. The government competitions, held in the capital and prefectures, resulted in appointments for winners, to military posts.

====Practice forms vs. kung fu in combat====
Even though forms in Chinese martial arts are intended to depict realistic martial techniques, the movements are not always identical to how techniques would be applied in combat. Many forms have been elaborated upon, on the one hand, to provide better combat preparedness, and on the other hand to look more aesthetically pleasing. One manifestation of this tendency toward elaboration beyond combat application is the use of lower stances and higher, stretching kicks. These two maneuvers are unrealistic in combat and are used in forms for exercise purposes. Many modern schools have replaced practical defense or offense movements with acrobatic feats that are more spectacular to watch, thereby gaining favor during exhibitions and competitions. This has led to criticisms by traditionalists of the endorsement of the more acrobatic, show-oriented Wushu competition. Historically forms were often performed for entertainment purposes long before the advent of modern Wushu as practitioners have looked for supplementary income by performing on the streets or in theaters. Documentation in ancient literature during the Tang dynasty (618–907) and the Northern Song dynasty (960–1279) suggests some sets, (including two + person sets: &quot;dui da&quot; also called &quot;dui lian&quot;) became very elaborate and &#x27;flowery&#x27;, many mainly concerned with aesthetics. During this time, some martial arts systems devolved to the point that they became popular forms of martial art storytelling entertainment shows. This created an entire category of martial arts known as &quot;Hua Fa Wuyi&quot;. During the Northern Song period, it was noted by historians this type of training had a negative influence on training in the military.

Many traditional Chinese martial artists, as well as practitioners of modern sport combat, have become critical of the perception that forms work is more relevant to the art than sparring and drill application, while most continue to see traditional forms practice within the traditional context—as vital to both proper combat execution, the Shaolin aesthetic as an art form, as well as upholding the meditative function of the physical art form.

Another reason why techniques often appear different in forms when contrasted with sparring application is thought by some to come from the concealment of the actual functions of the techniques from outsiders.

Forms practice is mostly known for teaching combat techniques yet when practicing forms, the practitioner focuses on posture, breathing, and performing the techniques of both right and left sides of the body.

==Wushu==

The word &quot;wu&quot; (; &#x27;) means &quot;martial&quot;. Its Chinese character is made of two parts; the first meaning &quot;walk&quot; or &quot;stop&quot; (; &#x27;) and the second meaning &quot;lance&quot; (; &#x27;). This implies that &quot;wu 武&quot; is a defensive use of combat. The term &quot;wushu 武術&quot; meaning &quot;martial arts&quot; goes back as far as the Liang dynasty (502–557) in an anthology compiled by Xiao Tong (), (Prince Zhaoming; d. 531), called &quot;Selected Literature&quot; (; &#x27;). The term is found in the second verse of a poem by Yan Yanzhi titled: 皇太子釋奠會作詩 &quot;Huang Taizi Shidian Hui Zuoshi&quot;.

&lt;poem&gt;The great man grows the many myriad things ...
Breaking away from the military arts,
He promotes fully the cultural mandates.

— Translated from &quot;Echoes of the Past&quot; by Yan Yanzhi (384–456)&lt;/poem&gt;

The term &quot;wushu&quot; is also found in a poem by Cheng Shao (1626–1644) from the Ming dynasty.

The earliest term for &#x27;martial arts&#x27; can be found in the Han History (206 BC – 23 AD) was &quot;military fighting techniques&quot; (; &#x27;). During the Song period (c.960) the name changed to &quot;martial arts&quot; (; &#x27;). In 1928 the name was changed to &quot;national arts&quot; (; &quot;&quot;) when the National Martial Arts Academy was established in Nanjing. The term reverted to &quot;wǔshù&quot; under the People&#x27;s Republic of China during the early 1950s.

As forms have grown in complexity and quantity over the years, and many forms alone could be practiced for a lifetime, modern styles of Chinese martial arts have developed that concentrate solely on forms, and do not practice application at all. These styles are primarily aimed at exhibition and competition, and often include more acrobatic jumps and movements added for enhanced visual effect compared to the traditional styles. Those who generally prefer to practice traditional styles, focused less on exhibition, are often referred to as traditionalists. Some traditionalists consider the competition forms of today&#x27;s Chinese martial arts as too commercialized and losing much of their original values.

==Martial Morality==
Traditional Chinese schools of martial arts, such as the famed Shaolin monks, often dealt with the study of martial arts not just as a means of self-defense or mental training, but as a system of ethics. &quot;Wude&quot; () can be translated as &quot;martial morality&quot; and is constructed from the words &quot;wu&quot; (), which means martial, and &quot;de&quot; (), which means morality. &quot;Wude&quot; deals with two aspects; &quot;Virtue of deed&quot; and &quot;Virtue of mind&quot;. Virtue of deed concerns social relations; morality of mind is meant to cultivate the inner harmony between the emotional mind (; ) and the wisdom mind (; ). The ultimate goal is reaching &quot;no extremity&quot; (; ) – closely related to the Taoist concept of wu wei – where both wisdom and emotions are in harmony with each other.

==Controversies==
There are a number of intrigues and unsettled disputes within the world of Traditional Chinese Martial Arts. Nevertheless, not all schools and practitioners are political. That is, as involvement in martial arts politics typically counteracts the principles of Martial Morality, which were detailed earlier. Some of the common topics for such conflicts involve the following:

* Lineage: Who belongs or does not belong to a given lineage? Who is entitle to the claim over being a &quot;lineage inheritor&quot;? 

* Style Supremacy: Claims over whose style &quot;is better&quot; than others. 

* Nationalism or racism: Refusal to teach people of certain races or cultures; or the opposite - the glorification of certain practitioners due to their association with a specific race or culture. 

* Historical Disagreements: Such as the origins of a style. 

* Ranks and Degrees: Who should receive a certain rank or a degree within a martial art system? People who are said to have been unjustifiably promoted, while others were not. 

* Religion and spirituality: Disagreements over the role of traditional faiths within martial arts schools, and whether or not they should be extant within a given school or organization. 

* Criminal Activities: The involvement of certain schools with gangs or criminal organizations; a phenomenon which was historically more common than today, but still exists. 

==Notable practitioners==
Examples of well-known practitioners () throughout history:

* Yue Fei (1103–1142 CE) was a famous Chinese general and patriot of the Song dynasty. Styles such as Eagle Claw and Xingyiquan attribute their creation to Yue. However, there is no historical evidence to support the claim he created these styles.
* Ng Mui (late 17th century) was the legendary female founder of many Southern martial arts such as Wing Chun, and Fujian White Crane. She is often considered one of the legendary Five Elders who survived the destruction of the Shaolin Temple during the Qing dynasty.
* Yang Luchan (1799–1872) was an important teacher of the internal martial art known as tai chi in Beijing during the second half of the 19th century. Yang is known as the founder of Yang-style tai chi, as well as transmitting the art to the Wu/Hao, Wu and Sun tai chi families.
* Ten Tigers of Canton (late 19th century) was a group of ten of the top Chinese martial arts masters in Guangdong (Canton) towards the end of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912). Wong Kei-Ying, Wong Fei Hung&#x27;s father, was a member of this group.
* Wong Fei Hung (1847–1924) was considered a Chinese folk hero during the Republican period. More than one hundred Hong Kong movies were made about his life. Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan, and Jet Li have all portrayed his character in blockbuster pictures.
* Huo Yuanjia (1867–1910) was the founder of Chin Woo Athletic Association who was known for his highly publicized matches with foreigners. His biography was recently portrayed in the movie &quot;Fearless&quot; (2006).
* Ip Man (1893–1972) was a master of the Wing Chun and the first to teach this style openly. Yip Man was the teacher of Bruce Lee. Most major branches of Wing Chun taught in the West today were developed and promoted by students of Yip Man.
* Gu Ruzhang (1894–1952) was a Chinese martial artist who disseminated the Bak Siu Lum (Northern Shaolin) martial arts system across southern China in the early 20th century. Gu was known for his expertise in Iron Palm hand conditioning among other Chinese martial art training exercises.
* Bruce Lee (1940–1973) was a Chinese-American martial artist and actor who was considered an important icon in the 20th century. He practiced Wing Chun and made it famous. Using Wing Chun as his base and learning from the influences of other martial arts his experience exposed him to, he later developed his own martial arts philosophy that evolved into what is now called Jeet Kune Do.
* Jackie Chan (b. 1954) is the famous Hong Kong martial artist, film actor, stuntman, action choreographer, director and producer, and a global pop culture icon, widely known for injecting physical comedy into his martial arts performances, and for performing complex stunts in many of his films.
* Jet Li (b. 1963) is the five-time sport wushu champion of China, later demonstrating his skills in cinema.
* Donnie Yen (b. 1963) is a Hong Kong actor, martial artist, film director and producer, action choreographer, and world wushu tournament medalist.
* Wu Jing (b. 1974) is a Chinese actor, director, and martial artist. He was a member of the Beijing wushu team, and started his career as action choreographer and later as an actor.

==In popular culture==
References to the concepts and use of Chinese martial arts can be found in popular culture. Historically, the influence of Chinese martial arts can be found in books and in the performance arts specific to Asia. Recently, those influences have extended to the movies and television that targets a much wider audience. As a result, Chinese martial arts have spread beyond its ethnic roots and have a global appeal.

Martial arts play a prominent role in the literature genre known as wuxia (). This type of fiction is based on Chinese concepts of chivalry, a separate martial arts society (; ) and a central theme involving martial arts. Wuxia stories can be traced as far back as 2nd and 3rd century BCE, becoming popular by the Tang dynasty and evolving into novel form by the Ming dynasty. This genre is still extremely popular in much of Asia and provides a major influence for the public perception of the martial arts.

Martial arts influences can also be found in dance, theater and especially Chinese opera, of which Beijing opera is one of the best-known examples. This popular form of drama dates back to the Tang dynasty and continues to be an example of Chinese culture. Some martial arts movements can be found in Chinese opera and some martial artists can be found as performers in Chinese operas.

In modern times, Chinese martial arts have spawned the genre of cinema known as the Kung fu film. The films of Bruce Lee were instrumental in the initial burst of Chinese martial arts&#x27; popularity in the West in the 1970s. Bruce Lee was the iconic international superstar that popularized Chinese martial arts in the West with his own variation of Chinese martial arts called &quot;Jeet Kune Do&quot;. It is a hybrid style of martial art that Bruce Lee practiced and mastered. &quot;Jeet Kune Do&quot; is his very own unique style of martial art that uses little to minimum movement but maximizes the effect to his opponents. The influence of Chinese martial art have been widely recognized and have a global appeal in Western cinemas starting off with Bruce Lee.

Martial artists and actors such as Jet Li and Jackie Chan have continued the appeal of movies of this genre. Jackie Chan successfully brought in a sense of humour in his fighting style in his movies. Martial arts films from China are often referred to as &quot;kung fu movies&quot; (), or &quot;wire-fu&quot; if extensive wire work is performed for special effects, and are still best known as part of the tradition of kung fu theater. (see also: wuxia, Hong Kong action cinema). The talent of these individuals have broadened Hong Kong&#x27;s cinematography production and rose to popularity overseas, influencing Western cinemas.

In the west, kung fu has become a regular action staple, and makes appearances in many films that would not generally be considered &quot;Martial Arts&quot; films. These films include but are not limited to &quot;The Matrix&quot; franchise, &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, and &quot;The Transporter&quot;.

Martial arts themes can also be found on television networks. A U.S. network TV western series of the early 1970s called &quot;Kung Fu&quot; also served to popularize the Chinese martial arts on television. With 60 episodes over a three-year span, it was one of the first North American TV shows that tried to convey the philosophy and practice in Chinese martial arts. The use of Chinese martial arts techniques can now be found in most TV action series, although the philosophy of Chinese martial arts is seldom portrayed in depth. In the 2006 music video of Knights of Cydonia by Muse, the protagonist can be seen training Chinese martial arts in the opening. In 2022, martial arts and action sequences inspired by Hong Kong cinema can be found in Everything Everywhere All at Once.

&quot;The Kung Fu Diaries: The Life and Times of a Dragon Master (1920–2001)&quot; is a work of fiction, combining aspects of biography, historical fiction, and guide to instruction purportedly from a collection of diaries or papers left by a Kung-Fu Dragon Master.

=== Influence on hip hop ===

In the 1970s, Bruce Lee was beginning to gain popularity in Hollywood for his martial arts movies. The fact that he was a non-white male who portrayed self-reliance and righteous self-discipline resonated with black audiences and made him an important figure in this community. Around 1973, Kung Fu movies became a hit in America across all backgrounds; however, black audiences maintained the films&#x27; popularity well after the general public lost interest. Black youth in New York City were still going from every borough to Times Square every night to watch the latest movies. Amongst these individuals were those coming from the Bronx where, during this time, hip-hop was beginning to take form. One of the pioneers responsible for the development of the foundational aspects of hip-hop was DJ Kool Herc, who began creating this new form of music by taking rhythmic breakdowns of songs and looping them. From the new music came a new form of dance known as b-boying or breakdancing, a style of street dance consisting of improvised acrobatic moves. The pioneers of this dance credit kung fu as one of its influences. Moves such as the crouching low leg sweep and &quot;up rocking&quot; (standing combat moves) are influenced by choreographed kung-fu fights. The dancers&#x27; ability to improvise these moves led way to battles, which were dance competitions between two dancers or crews judged on their creativity, skills, and musicality. In a documentary, &quot;Crazy Legs&quot;, a member of breakdancing group Rock Steady Crew described the breakdancing battle being like an old kung fu movie, &quot;where the one kung fu master says something along the lines of &#x27;hun your kung fu is good, but mine is better,&#x27; then a fight erupts.&quot;

<text>Suicide by cop (SbC), also known as suicide by police or law-enforcement-assisted suicide, is a suicide method in which a suicidal individual deliberately behaves in a threatening manner with intent to provoke a lethal response from a public safety or law enforcement officer to end their own life.

== Overview ==

There are two broad categories of &quot;suicide by cop&quot;. The first is when someone has committed a crime and is being pursued by the police and decides that they would rather die than be arrested. These people may not otherwise be suicidal but may simply decide that life is not worth living if they are incarcerated and thus will provoke police to kill them. The second version involves people who are already contemplating suicide and who decide to provoke law enforcement into killing them. These individuals may commit a crime with the specific intention of provoking a law enforcement response.

The idea of dying by suicide in this manner is based on trained procedures of law enforcement officers, specifically the policy on the use of deadly force. In jurisdictions where officials are readily capable of deadly force, often by being equipped with firearms, there are usually set circumstances where they will predictably use deadly force against a threat to themselves or others. This form of suicide functions by exploiting this trained reaction. The most common scenario is pointing a firearm at a police officer or an innocent person, which would be expected to provoke an officer to fire on them. Many variants exist: for example, attacking with a knife or other hand weapon, trying to run an officer or other person over with a car, or trying to trigger a real or presumed explosive device.

This concept hinges on the person&#x27;s state of mind, and their desire to end their own life, which can be difficult to determine post-mortem. Some cases are obvious, such as pointing an unloaded or non-functioning gun, such as a toy gun, air gun, airsoft gun, or starter&#x27;s pistol, at officers, or the presence of a suicide note. Some suspects brazenly announce their intention to die before they act; however, many cases can be more difficult to determine, as some suspects with the desire to die will actually fire live ammunition and even kill people before being killed themselves. Many law enforcement training programs have added sections to specifically address handling these situations if officers suspect that the subject is attempting to goad them into using lethal force.

== History ==
Many modern cases that pre-date the formal recognition of the phenomenon have been identified or speculated by historians as matching the pattern now known as suicide by cop. According to authors Mark Lindsay and David Lester, Houston McCoy, one of the two Austin Police Department officers who shot and killed Charles Whitman, the &quot;Texas Tower Sniper&quot;, believed that Whitman could have shot him and fellow officer Ramiro Martinez, but &quot;he was waiting for them, and wanted to be shot.&quot; The 1976 death of Mal Evans, road manager, assistant, and a friend of the Beatles, who aimed an air gun at police and refused to put it down, was theorized as a possible example of this phenomenon. Some historians believe that Giuseppe Zangara, the man who killed Chicago mayor Anton Cermak in a possible attempt to assassinate then President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt, might have been attempting suicide by police.

==Recognition and research==

The phenomenon has been described in news accounts from 1981, and scientific journals since 1985. The phrase has appeared in news headlines since at least 1987. It did not become common until the early 2000s. The phrase seems to have originated in the United States, but has also appeared in the UK, where a jury first determined someone died by suicide by cop in 2003.

Some of the first research into suicide by cop was completed by Sgt. Rick Parent of the Delta Police Department in 2004. Parent&#x27;s research of 843 police shootings determined that about 50% were victim-precipitated homicide. Police defined victim-precipitated homicide as &quot;an incident in which an individual bent on self-destruction, engages in life threatening and criminal behavior to force law enforcement officers to kill them.&quot;

The first formally labeled &quot;Suicide by Cop&quot; case in English legal history was a judgment made on May 9, 2003, by the Reverend Dr. William Dolman while serving as a London coroner between 1993 and 2007. It set a legal precedent and the judgment, as a cause of death, has been a part of English law since.

A 2009 study in the United States of the profiles of 268 people who died by suicide by cop found that
* 95% were male and 5% were female
* the mean age was 35 for men
* 41% of men were Caucasian, 26% Hispanic and 16% African American
* 37% of men were single
* 29% of men had children
* 54% of men were unemployed
* 29% of men did not have housing
* 62% of men had confirmed or probable histories of mental health issues
* 80% of men were armed – of these, 60% possessed firearms (of which 86% were loaded) and 26% possessed knives
* 19% feigned or simulated weapon possession
* 87% of individuals made suicidal communications prior to and/or during the incident
* 36% were under the influence of alcohol.

A study of five years (2010–2015) of LAPD data on 419 attempted suicides by cop found that officers used lethal force seven times, killing five of the subjects. Less-lethal force was used 71 times. No force was used the other 341 times, or 81 percent. LAPD’s Mental Evaluation Unit has specially trained officers to handle such incidents and tracked, paired with mental health clinicians, who are on call 24 hours a day.

In the US, the Police Executive Research Forum developed a protocol for dealing with incidents, in which officers do not aim their weapon at the person, move a safe distance away and engage the person in conversation rather than shouting commands at them.

== Examples ==

* According to the Beatles researcher Kenneth Womack, the death of the band&#x27;s roadie Mal Evans in 1976 was a suicide by cop, as Evans had written a will the night before.
* In the Aramoana massacre, a spree shooting that occurred on 13 November 1990 in New Zealand, police shot the suspect dead as he came out of a house firing from the hip and screaming &quot;Kill me!&quot;
* On 5 May 2005, Peggy Jo Tallas, a bank robber, engaged in a shootout while armed with a toy pistol.
* In December 2008, 15-year-old Tyler Cassidy was shot and killed by three Victoria Police officers after he threatened them with two large knives and ordered them to shoot him.
* During March 2011, Chilean businessman and organized criminal Italo Nolli was shot and killed by police after shooting dead two investigative police detectives and hurting another five. He had previously stated to his wife and son that he believed dying in a police shootout would be &quot;dignifying&quot; and that he &quot;would not return to prison&quot;.
* Myron May, a 31-year-old man believing he was a victim of government covert electronic harassment on the line of Cold War era MKUltra and COINTELPRO clandestine US government programs, died by suicide by cop on 20 November 2014 after recording his intentions on tape.
* On 4 January 2015, a 32-year-old San Francisco man, Matthew Hoffman, staged a standoff with police in the parking lot of an SFPD station. When he brandished the gun, two officers shot him a total of three times. He left a message for the officers on his cell phone, saying: &quot;You did nothing wrong. You ended the life of a man who was too much of a coward to do it himself ... I provoked you. I threatened your life as well as the lives of those around me.&quot;
* In June 2015, 21-year-old Trepierre Hummons, a known gangster with a history of weapons violations, posted his intent to die by suicide by cop on Facebook on the same day that a sex offense had been reported against him. He called 9-1-1 and reported he had seen a man acting erratically with a gun. He then shot the responding officer multiple times, mortally wounding him. The next officer to arrive on the scene shot Hummons. Both Hummons and the wounded policeman later died in the hospital.
* On 22 October 2015, Anton Lundin Pettersson, the perpetrator of the Trollhättan school stabbing, wrote a message to an online friend an hour before the attack, where he states “I hope those fucking cops aim straight, because I really don&#x27;t want to survive my rampage.&quot;. He also wrote that he expected to be dead within one or two hours and that he hated himself. Pettersson had a history of mental illness, and a book about the attack with interviews of many people around him states that &quot;during the period before the attack, he wavered between several options; to seek professional help, to kill himself &#x27;normally&#x27; or to attack people around him to get killed.&quot;
* On 28 May 2017, a man named Willie Godbolt in Mississippi who murdered seven of his family members and a police officer told a journalist that by shooting towards police, &quot;Suicide by cop was my intention. I ain&#x27;t fit to live. Not after what I&#x27;ve done.&quot;
* On 15 September 2017, a 15-year-old Virginia boy, Ruben Urbina, called police and was shot twice after threatening an officer with a crowbar. After calling 911, he made threats of a bomb, hostages, knives and guns, none of which were real. &quot;I called the police… so they can kill me.&quot;
* On August 30, 2018, American actress Vanessa Marquez pleaded with police officers to kill her while pointing a replica gun at them. Officers were unaware the gun was a replica, and they shot her to death in self-defense.
* In 2018, Alek Minassian, the perpetrator of the Toronto van attack, claimed to have attempted suicide by cop when apprehended by police after his attack, requesting to be killed and claiming he was armed with a gun, a declaration which was false.

== In literary fiction ==
In &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, Tom Robinson, a despondent black man who is on death row for a rape he did not commit, is shot 17 times and killed while trying to escape from the prison in front of the prison guards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Temple_2/17/2015&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, Dallas Winston, a juvenile delinquent, aims an unloaded handgun at police officers with the intent of them shooting him; he is shot dead.

<doc id="485449" wikidata="Q1927883" url="?curid=485449" title="Michael Holroyd">
<text>Sir Michael de Courcy Fraser Holroyd (born 27 August 1935) is an English biographer.

==Early life and education==
Holroyd was born in London, the son of Basil de Courcy Fraser Holroyd (a descendant of Sir George Sowley Holroyd, Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench, whose ancestor was Isaac Holroyd, younger brother of George, the great-great-grandfather of John Baker Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield), and his wife, Ulla (known as &quot;Sue&quot;), daughter of Karl Knutsson-Hall, a Swedish army officer. His parents having separated- their son &quot;left to grow up in a bewilderingly extended family, shunted back and forth among parents and stepparents and grandparents and uncles and aunts&quot;- Holroyd was raised at his father&#x27;s family home, Norhurst, at Maidenhead, Berkshire. The Holroyds &quot;for a time enjoyed a small fortune&quot;, provided by, amongst other things, an Indian tea plantation; this fortune was eventually &quot;done in by mismanagement of resources and foolish investments&quot; including investment in Lalique glassware, his grandfather having been its sole London agent in the 1920s. The Holroyd family had been &quot;for several centuries&quot; Yorkshire &quot;butchers, clergymen, clothiers, farmers, landowners, soldiers, yeoman (sic) of all kinds&quot;.

He was educated at Eton College, though he has often claimed Maidenhead Public Library as his alma mater.

==Career==
In 1964, Holroyd published his first book, a biography of the writer Hugh Kingsmill; his reputation was consolidated in 1967–68 with the publication of his two-volume life of Lytton Strachey (which the playwright Christopher Hampton later used extensively when writing the screenplay for the 1995 film &quot;Carrington&quot;). Holroyd has also written biographies of Augustus John and, in four volumes, of Bernard Shaw. His book &quot;A Book of Secrets: Illegitimate Daughters, Absent Fathers&quot; (2010) concerns the Villa Cimbrone on the Gulf of Salerno and the Edwardian literary and society figures who lived there, such as Ernest Beckett, 2nd Baron Grimthorpe.

&quot;Lytton Strachey: A Critical Biography&quot; (1967, 1968) became Holroyd&#x27;s definitive work. He published a revised version in 1994 under the revised subtitle &quot;The New Biography&quot;.

Holroyd was chairman of the Society of Authors, 1973–83, and from 1985 to 1988 was president of the English branch of PEN. He is also President of the Shaw Society.

<doc id="485453" wikidata="Q732416" url="?curid=485453" title="Vijay Anand (filmmaker)">
<text>Vijay Anand (22 January 1934 – 23 February 2004), also known as Goldie Anand, was an Indian filmmaker, producer, screenwriter, editor and actor, who is known for acclaimed films such as &quot;Guide&quot; (1965), &quot;Teesri Manzil&quot; (1966), &quot;Jewel Thief&quot; (1967) and (1970). He made most of his films for the in-house banner Navketan Films and was part of the Anand family.

==Background and personal life==
Vijay Anand was born in Gurdaspur, Punjab, India, the son of Pishori Lal Anand, a successful and affluent advocate. He was the youngest of nine siblings. The producer and director Chetan Anand and the celebrated actor Dev Anand were his brothers, and among his sister was Sheel Kanta Kapur, mother of film director Shekhar Kapur.

Vijay married his much younger niece, Sushma Kohli, the daughter of his older sister. This uncle-niece pairing is forbidden in much of Indian society and was a scandal when it happened. The couple married in the face of resistance from many quarters, not least their own families, but they had a happy marriage which lasted all their lives. They have a son together named Vaibhav Anand.

==Career==
Though Vijay Anand has had a career as an actor, screenwriter, editor, and producer, he will primarily be remembered as a director. He made his directorial debut in 1957 superhit &quot;Nau Do Gyarah.&quot; The film, where Vijay&#x27;s brother Dev Anand played the leading role, was shot in only 40 days.

Some of Vijay&#x27;s other successful movies as a director are &quot;Kala Bazar&quot; (1960), &quot;Guide&quot; (1965), &quot;Teesri Manzil&quot; (1966), &quot;Jewel Thief&quot; (1967), (1970), &quot;Tere Mere Sapne&quot; (1971), &quot;Ram Balram&quot; (1980) and &quot;Rajput&quot; (1982). Nearly all of these films were made by Navketan films, the production company started by the Anand brothers themselves. Notable exceptions were&quot;Teesri Manzil&quot;, which was produced by Nasir Hussain,&quot; Ram-Balram&quot; produced by Tony Juneja and &quot;Rajput&quot; produced by Mushir-Riaz.The period 1957-1970 must be reckoned the High Noon of Vijay Anand&#x27;s career, as is evident from the films listed above. Vijay&#x27;s 1965 film &quot;Guide&quot; starring Dev Anand and Waheeda Rehman, which was based on R. K. Narayan&#x27;s novel of the same name, marked the acme of Vijay Anand&#x27;s career. It was not only his biggest blockbuster but also his most critically acclaimed movie, celebrated by the masses, the classes and music-lovers alike. Navketan attempted an international release of an English-language remake of &quot;Guide,&quot; but without success.

Vijay Anand is known for his stylish song picturization, such as the numbers; &quot;O Haseena Zulfonwali&quot; (&quot;Teesri Manzil&quot;), &quot;Aaj Phir Jeene Ki Tamanna Hai&quot; (&quot;Guide&quot;) and &quot;Honthon Mein Aisi Baat&quot; (&quot;Jewel Thief&quot;).

He debuted as an actor with the film &quot;Agra Road&quot; (1957). As an actor, his most memorable roles were in the films like &quot;Kala Bazar&quot; (1960), &quot;Haqeeqat&quot; (1964), &quot;Kora Kagaz&quot; (1974), (in which he starred opposite Jaya Bachchan) and &quot;Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki&quot; (1978). Songless thriller film &quot;Chor Chor&quot; (1974), in which Leena Chandavarkar was his heroine. He acted in &quot;Ghungroo Ki Awaaz&quot; (1981) and &quot;Double Cross&quot; (1972) with Rekha as well as &quot;Chhupa Rustam&quot; (1973) and &quot;Tere Mere Sapne&quot; with Dev Anand, Hema Malini &amp; Mumtaz.

To the younger generation of the 1990s he is also known for playing detective &quot;Sam&quot; in the television series &quot;Tehkikaat&quot; (1994).

He served a short stint as the chairman of the Central Board of Film Certification, India&#x27;s censor board, a position from which he resigned, in 2002, after he ran into ideological differences with the government over the introduction of ratings for adult movies.

Goldie, as he was affectionately called, died on 23 February 2004 due to a heart attack. He was aged 70.

<doc id="485455" wikidata="Q650482" url="?curid=485455" title="Non-Partisan Association">
<text>The Non-Partisan Association (NPA) is a municipal political party in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was established by the city&#x27;s business leaders in 1937 to challenge the democratic socialist Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in that year&#x27;s municipal election. The party has historically been described as centre-right and drawn its strongest support from Vancouver&#x27;s business community.

In the years following the 2018 municipal election, seven of the NPA&#x27;s ten elected officials resigned from the party, claiming that it had become right-wing and undemocratic. Several other prominent members, such as the NPA&#x27;s 2018 mayoral candidate Ken Sim, also resigned. Most of those departing later joined ABC Vancouver in the run-up to the 2022 municipal election, which saw Sim elected as mayor and the NPA lose all its remaining seats.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
The NPA was established by Vancouver&#x27;s business leaders on November 13, 1937, to counteract the growing influence of the CCF. Fearful of a CCF victory in the Vancouver municipal election on December 8, 1937, provincial politicians from the then-ruling BC Liberal Party launched an initiative to create a pro-business municipal party to challenge the CCF. The NPA&#x27;s first chairman was Victor Odlum, a prominent member of Vancouver&#x27;s business and political elite who had served as a Liberal MLA from 1924 to 1928. Other founding members of the NPA include W. C. Woodward of Woodward&#x27;s department store, Victor Spencer of Spencer&#x27;s department store, and industrialist Austin Taylor. Despite its party connections, the NPA claimed it was not a party, but rather a &quot;free enterprise coalition&quot; which &quot;oppose[d] the introduction of party politics into Vancouver&#x27;s civic administration&quot;.

The NPA first fielded candidates in the December 9, 1936, municipal election, which saw their mayoral candidate, George Miller, elected to office. Miller later ran in provincial elections for the BC Progressive Conservative Party. Prior to the 1939 election, a member of the NPA&#x27;s executive, Nelson Spencer, broke away from the party and ran independently after the NPA chose the then-incumbent Miller as its mayoral candidate instead of Spencer. The result was that the right-wing vote was split, and CCF candidate Lyle Telford was elected. Telford would only serve one term before NPA candidate Jack Cornett was elected in the 1940 election, beginning a decades-long period of NPA dominance on Vancouver City Council.

=== 21st century ===
Jennifer Clarke was chosen to be the NPA&#x27;s mayoral candidate for the 2002 municipal election, as opposed to the then-incumbent mayor Philip Owen. Owen had been in disagreement with the rest of the party leadership due to his support for harm reduction programs in the Downtown Eastside, although Clarke stated she was also in favour of such programs. The NPA ultimately lost the mayoral race, as well as its majority on city council that it had maintained since 1986.

Long-time city councillor Sam Sullivan was chosen as the NPA&#x27;s candidate for the 2005 mayoral race, which he later won. The NPA also regained its majority on city council, winning a total of six seats.

Peter Ladner was the NPA&#x27;s mayoral candidate for the 2008 municipal election but was defeated by Gregor Robertson, the candidate for Vision Vancouver. The NPA&#x27;s electoral platform during the 2008 election focused on reducing crime, improving housing affordability, leveraging the 2010 Winter Olympics, protecting the environment, advancing the city&#x27;s arts and culture sector, and working collaboratively with senior levels of government, community groups, and the private sector.

The party, led by Suzanne Anton as the NPA&#x27;s mayoral candidate, once again lost to Robertson and Vision Vancouver in the 2011 municipal election but elected two members to Vancouver City Council. Two members were also elected to the Park Board, and three members to the Vancouver School Board.

On October 16, 2016, provincial education minister Mike Bernier fired the school trustees elected during the 2014 municipal election for failing to pass a balanced budget. NPA incumbent Fraser Ballantyne was re-elected in the subsequent 2017 municipal by-election, alongside newcomer Lisa Dominato.

City councillor Rebecca Bligh announced on December 6, 2019, that she was leaving the NPA but would continue to serve as an independent. She cited concerns over the NPA&#x27;s newly elected executive team, which included members publicly opposed to the provincial sexual orientation and gender identification (SOGI) curriculum and former staff of the far-right &quot;Rebel Media&quot;. Other high profile NPA members, such as city councillor Sarah Kirby-Yung and 2018 mayoral candidate Ken Sim, also voiced concerns over the party&#x27;s perceived shift to the right.

Three of the NPA&#x27;s four remaining councillorsLisa Dominato, Colleen Hardwick, and Sarah Kirby-Yungannounced on April 21, 2021, that they would be leaving the NPA to sit as independents, following the decision of the board to appoint Park Board commissioner John Coupar as the 2022 NPA mayoral candidate, the board&#x27;s refusal to hold an annual general meeting despite a request to do so from all its elected politicians, and broad accusations of a lack of transparency on the board&#x27;s behalf. Two days later, all three of the NPA&#x27;s school trustees resigned from the party as well, leaving an elected caucus of one councillor (Melissa De Genova) and two Park Board commissioners (John Coupar and Tricia Barker). On August 5, 2022, Coupar resigned as the NPA&#x27;s mayoral candidate, with the party indicating it would nominate a new candidate before the ballot deadline. Fred Harding, a retired police officer who ran for mayor with the Vancouver 1st party in the 2018 election, was subsequently announced as the NPA&#x27;s new mayoral candidate.

Most of the elected officials who resigned from the NPA later joined ABC Vancouver in the run-up to the 2022 municipal election, which saw Ken Sim elected as mayor and the defeat of all NPA incumbents.

== Electoral results ==
The NPA held a majority on Vancouver City Council from 1941 to 1967, 1970 to 1972, 1978 to 1980, 1986 to 2002, and from 2005 to 2008. It held the mayor&#x27;s office from 1941 to 1958, from 1963 to 1966, from 1986 to 2002, and from 2005 to 2008. However, it has elected only three of the last eight mayors since 1972. Over the years, its opposition has been The Electors&#x27; Action Movement (TEAM) in the 1970s, the left-wing Coalition of Progressive Electors (COPE) in the 1980s and 1990s, and centre-left Vision Vancouver in the 2000s and 2010s.

There have been eleven NPA mayors of Vancouver:
* Jack (Jonathan Webster) Cornett (1941–1946)
* Gerry McGeer (1947)
* Charles E. Jones (1947–1948)
* George Clark Miller (acting) (1948)
* Charles Edwin Thompson (1949–1950)
* Frederick Hume (1951–1958)
* William Rathie (1963–1966)
* Tom Campbell (1967–1972)
* Gordon Campbell (1986–1993)
* Philip Owen (1993–2002)
* Sam Sullivan (2005–2008)

<text>In signal processing, a periodogram is an estimate of the spectral density of a signal. The term was coined by Arthur Schuster in 1898. Today, the periodogram is a component of more sophisticated methods (see spectral estimation). It is the most common tool for examining the amplitude vs frequency characteristics of FIR filters and window functions. FFT spectrum analyzers are also implemented as a time-sequence of periodograms.

==Definition==
There are at least two different definitions in use today. One of them involves time-averaging, and one does not. Time-averaging is also the purview of other articles (Bartlett&#x27;s method and Welch&#x27;s method). This article is not about time-averaging. The definition of interest here is that the power spectral density of a continuous function, formula_1  is the Fourier transform of its auto-correlation function (see Cross-correlation theorem, Spectral density, and Wiener–Khinchin theorem):
formula_2

==Computation==


For sufficiently small values of parameter an arbitrarily-accurate approximation for can be observed in the region  formula_3  of the function:

formula_4

which is precisely determined by the samples that span the non-zero duration of  (see Discrete-time Fourier transform).

And for sufficiently large values of parameter ,  formula_5 can be evaluated at an arbitrarily close frequency by a summation of the form:

formula_6

where is an integer. The periodicity of  formula_7  allows this to be written very simply in terms of a Discrete Fourier transform:

formula_8

where formula_9 is a periodic summation:  formula_10

When evaluated for all integers, , between 0 and -1, the array:
formula_11
is a &quot;periodogram&quot;.

==Applications==

When a periodogram is used to examine the detailed characteristics of an FIR filter or window function, the parameter is chosen to be several multiples of the non-zero duration of the sequence, which is called &quot;zero-padding&quot; (see ).  When it is used to implement a filter bank, is several sub-multiples of the non-zero duration of the sequence (see ).

One of the periodogram&#x27;s deficiencies is that the variance at a given frequency does not decrease as the number of samples used in the computation increases. It does not provide the averaging needed to analyze noiselike signals or even sinusoids at low signal-to-noise ratios. Window functions and filter impulse responses are noiseless, but many other signals require more sophisticated methods of spectral estimation. Two of the alternatives use periodograms as part of the process:
*The &quot;method of averaged periodograms&quot;,  more commonly known as Welch&#x27;s method,  divides a long x[n] sequence into multiple shorter, and possibly overlapping, subsequences. It computes a windowed periodogram of each one, and computes an array average, i.e. an array where each element is an average of the corresponding elements of all the periodograms. For stationary processes, this reduces the noise variance of each element by approximately a factor equal to the reciprocal of the number of periodograms.
*Smoothing is an averaging technique in frequency, instead of time. The smoothed periodogram is sometimes referred to as a &quot;spectral plot&quot;.

Periodogram-based techniques introduce small biases that are unacceptable in some applications. Other techniques that do not rely on periodograms are presented in the spectral density estimation article.

<text>Pākehā Māori or Pakeha Maori were early European settlers (known as Pākehā in the Māori language) who lived among the Māori in New Zealand.

==History==
Many Pākehā Māori were runaway seamen or escaped Australian convicts who settled in Māori communities by choice.

A few Pākehā Māori such as James Caddell, John Rutherford and Barnet Burns even received &quot;moko&quot; (facial tattoos).

In 1862 and 1863, the early settler Frederick Edward Maning published two books under the pseudonym &quot;A Pakeha Maori&quot; in which he describes how they lived.

<doc id="485460" wikidata="Q1138837" url="?curid=485460" title="Cranbrook, British Columbia">
<text>Cranbrook ( ) is a city in southeast British Columbia, Canada, located approximately 10 km southwest of the confluence of the Kootenay River and the St. Mary&#x27;s River. It is the largest urban centre in the region known as the East Kootenay. As of 2021, Cranbrook&#x27;s population is 20,499 with a census agglomeration population of 27,040. It is the location of the headquarters of the Regional District of East Kootenay and also the location of the regional headquarters of various provincial ministries and agencies, notably the Rocky Mountain Forest District.

Cranbrook is home to the Canadian Museum of Rail Travel which presents static exhibits of passenger rail cars built in the 1920s for the CPR and in the 1900s for the Spokane International Railway.

== History ==

Originally inhabited by Ktunaxa peoples, the land that Cranbrook now occupies was bought by European settlers, notably Colonel James Baker who named his newly acquired land Cranbrook after his home in Cranbrook, Kent, England. In 1890, the Kootenay Indian Residential School, also called St. Eugene&#x27;s, opened in Cranbrook, and operated until 1975.

In 1898, Baker had successfully convinced Canadian Pacific Railway to establish their Crowsnest Pass line through Cranbrook rather than nearby Gold Rush Boom Town Fort Steele. With that accomplishment Cranbrook became the major centre of the region, while Fort Steele declined; however, the latter is today a preserved heritage town.

On November 1, 1905, Cranbrook was incorporated as a city.

Some of the major industries include mining and forestry services, trades, and health care.

== Geography ==
While much of the city is relatively flat, Cranbrook is surrounded by many rising hills where many residential homes are located. Cranbrook faces the Purcell Mountains to the west and the Rocky Mountains to the north and east. There are many lakes in close proximity to Cranbrook. Some of these lakes include Jim Smith Lake, Wasa Lake, Lazy Lake, Moyie Lake, Monroe Lake, Norbury Lake and Elizabeth Lake. Many of these lakes contain opportunities for boating, fishing and camping. There are public recreational beaches and provincial campgrounds.

== Climate ==
Cranbrook features a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification with very warm, sunny summer days followed by cool nights, and moderately cold and snowy winters. Environment and Climate Change Canada reports Cranbrook as having the most sunshine hours of any BC city at approximately 2190.5 hours annually. It is a fairly dry city throughout the year, and when precipitation does fall a good percentage of it will be in the form of snow. Environment and Climate Change Canada also states that the city experiences some of the lightest wind speeds year-round, has few foggy days, and has among the highest average barometric pressure of any city in Canada. Frost-free days average 127 days, typically occurring between May 18 to September 23. Mean daily temperatures range from to . However, temperatures can range from in the winter to in the summer months. Overall, its climate is extremely similar to that of Kelowna, in the nearby Okanagan Valley to the west - especially in regard to precipitation patterns and total monthly accumulation. However, Kelowna is significantly warmer throughout all seasons.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Cranbrook was on August 10, 2018. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on January 19, 1958.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Cranbrook had a population of 20,499 living in 8,780 of its 9,058 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 20,047. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Mount Baker is the largest high school in school district five. Prior to 2004, the middle schools were referred to as junior high schools housing grades 8-10 rather than the current 7–9. However, due to declining enrollment, the school district adopted the new system. There is also a local home-school network.

The following 13 schools are located in Cranbrook.
* Aqamnik Elementary School (First Nations school located in St. Mary&#x27;s Band)

=== Post-secondary education ===
Cranbrook is home to the main campus of the College of the Rockies, which has over 2,500 full and part-time students from over 21 countries.

== Transportation ==
Cranbrook is at the junction of major highways 3 and 93/95, and due to its close proximity to the borders of Alberta and the United States, it is an important transportation hub. Cranbrook has a major Canadian Pacific Railway yard, which serves as a key gateway for trains arriving from and departing to the United States.

The McPhee Bridge also known as the St. Mary&#x27;s Bridge rises high above the St. Mary River and is near the Cranbrook/Canadian Rockies International Airport and the Shadow Mountain Golf Community. It supports the thousands of people who travel between Kimberley and Cranbrook on highway 95A.

Approximately north is the Cranbrook/Canadian Rockies International Airport, which has recently completed its 12.5 million dollar expansion including the lengthening of its runway from feet in order to accommodate a limited number of international flights and an expansion to the Terminal for more passengers. The airport is served by Air Canada Jazz to Vancouver, Pacific Coastal Airlines to Victoria and Kelowna, and WestJet Link to Vancouver and Calgary. On February 11, 1978, Pacific Western Airlines Flight 314, a Boeing 737-200, nearly impacted a snowplow on the runway at the airport in Cranbrook, then lost control and crashed, killing 42 of the 49 people on board.

Cranbrook has a public transit system operated by BC Transit, which runs buses on eight different lines.

==Health care==
Cranbrook has the largest hospital in the region, the East Kootenay Regional Hospital.

== Sports and recreation ==

Western Financial Place (formerly called the RecPlex) is a pool and hockey arena in Cranbrook that opened in 2000, and was formerly the home to the Kootenay Ice until relocating to Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 2019. Following their departure, the recreational centre became home to the Cranbrook Bucks who play in the BCHL. A paved, two-lane trail exists between Cranbrook and Kimberley, BC. This trail constitutes a section of the Trans-Canada Trail and is known as the Rails to Trails. Canadian Pacific Railway donated the rail right-of-way and the teardown of the railway began by CP Rail in 2009. In addition to this trail, there are 2000 acres of wilderness to explore in the community forest.

<text>Leslie Miscampbell Frost (September 20, 1895 – May 4, 1973) was a politician in Ontario, Canada, who served as the province&#x27;s 16th premier from May 4, 1949, to November 8, 1961. Due to his lengthy tenure, he gained the nickname &quot;Old Man Ontario&quot;; he was also known as &quot;the Silver Fox&quot;.

==Early years==
Born in Orillia, Ontario, he was the son of William Sword Frost and Margaret Jane Barker. His father was a jeweller and mayor of Orillia; his mother was an important figure in the early days of The Salvation Army. He attended the University of Toronto and Osgoode Hall Law School. During World War I, he was an officer with &#x27;C&#x27; Company 157th Battalion (Simcoe Foresters), CEF, and served with the 20th Battalion (Central Ontario) in France and Belgium. In 1918, after being wounded, he was discharged with the rank of Captain. He was called to the Bar in 1921.

In 1926, he married Gertrude Jane Carew. They had no children. The couple lived in Lindsay, Ontario, but Frost preferred his property at Pleasant Point on Sturgeon Lake north of Lindsay. When Frost and his brother, Cecil Gray Frost, first moved to Lindsay to establish a law practice, they rented a building at Pleasant Point that had been the community store and commuted to town by steamer. Frost bought the property in 1925 and, in about 1950, bought adjacent property where he built the winterized log cabin that was his refuge while he was premier and in retirement.

==Early political career==
In 1937, he was first elected to the Ontario legislature and thereafter never lost an election. He was the Treasurer of Ontario and Minister of Mines from 1943 to 1955.
Frost was chosen as leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party (the &quot;Tories&quot;) following Premier George Drew&#x27;s decision to enter federal politics.

==Premier of Ontario==

Dubbed &quot;The Old Man Ontario&quot; and &quot;The Laird of Lindsay&quot;, Frost led the province during the economic boom of the 1950s. His low-key approach garnered him the nickname &quot;The Great Tranquilizer&quot;. Combining small-town values with progressive policies, he took the Tories through three successive electoral victories winning majority governments in 1951, 1955 and 1959.

===Economic policy===

Frost&#x27;s government also attempted to wrest control of the income tax from the federal government, but failed, resulting in the introduction of a provincial sales tax. Frost expanded health care coverage for Ontarians through the creation of the Hospital Services Commission of Ontario Act and the Ontario Hospital Insurance Plan. By 1960, 94% of the population of Ontario was enrolled in the Ontario Hospital Insurance Plan.

Frost&#x27;s government oversaw substantial expansion in public services and substantially increased public investment in the economy, as well as through strong fiscal policies.

===Education policy===

Under Frost, the number of universities in Ontario increased from four to twelve. As finance minister in 1943, the total provincial investment in education was just over $13 million. Upon his retirement in 1961, the education budget for Ontario was $250 million.

===Social policy===

The Frost government was the first to pass laws providing penalties for racial, ethnic, and gender discrimination on private property; these laws, introduced in the early 1950s as the Fair Employment Practices Act and Fair Accommodation Practices Act, started a movement in Ontario politics that produced the Ontario Human Rights Code in 1962 and later legislation. Frost&#x27;s government also introduced legislation to ensure women received equal wages. His government also introduced voting rights for First Nations. When confronted by J.A. McGibbon, a judge from Lindsay and fellow fishing companion, regarding an anti-discrimination law about property, Frost told him that his attitudes towards people of color were out of date.

Frost&#x27;s government oversaw great expansion in the role of government. Under his leadership, Ontario greatly expanded its schools, highways and hospitals. Under his leadership Ontario created the 400 series of superhighways, most notably the Macdonald-Cartier Freeway better known as Highway 401.

Frost&#x27;s government oversaw the federation of the old City of Toronto with twelve surrounding municipalities to become Metropolitan Toronto.

===Retirement===

Frost resigned in 1961, and was succeeded as Tory leader and Premier by John Robarts.

==After politics==
Upon retirement from politics, Frost served on the Board of Governors of the University of Toronto. As well, he was a member of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Montreal, KVP, Canada Life, and Trans Canada Air. Between 1954 and 1969 he also served as Vice-President of the Champlain Society and as its Honorary Vice-President from 1969 to 1973. He served as Chancellor of Trent University from 1967 to 1973. In retirement, he continued his interest in the outdoors. Near the end of his life, he undertook for the government of Ontario an exhaustive investigation of the state and potential of Algonquin Provincial Park. In the last interview he gave, just before he died, to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, he declared: &quot;I am an environmentalist.&quot;

Frost was an excellent amateur historian. His book &quot;Fighting Men&quot; covered the history of the 35th Regiment of Simcoe Foresters from Orillia, Ontario in the context of the First World War. Within that he connects the Canadian home front to the war front in France, and connects the events within the regiment to the bigger picture of the war and Canada&#x27;s subsequent role in world affairs. His Forgotten Pathways of the Trent (published just after he died) challenged historians&#x27; previous conclusions about Indian trade and warfare routes in southern Ontario. He was an avid U.S. Civil War buff and kept on the mantelpiece in his large library a piece of wood that was supposed to have come from Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s original log cabin.

==Honours==

In 1969, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada, Canada&#x27;s highest civilian honour.

Various places across Ontario are named for Frost:

* Frost Building, Toronto - houses the Ontario Ministry of Finance and the Ontario Management Board Secretariat, at Queen&#x27;s Park, was named in his honour.
* Frost Centre for Canadian Studies and Indigenous Studies, Peterborough, Ontario - at Trent University, 
* Leslie Frost Library at Glendon College (York University), Toronto
* Frost Campus at Fleming College, Lindsay, Ontario

<text>Mail Call is a television program that aired on the History Channel. It was hosted by R. Lee Ermey, a retired United States Marine Corps staff sergeant and honorary gunnery sergeant. The show debuted on August 4, 2002 as part of the &quot;Fighting Fridays&quot; lineup. Most episodes were 30 minutes, but from 2007 through the show&#x27;s end in 2009 some episodes were 60 minutes.

== Description ==
During each episode, Ermey read and answered questions submitted by viewers regarding weapons, equipment, customs, and terminology used by all branches of the U.S. military now or in the past, as well as by other armed forces in history. Ermey often took his viewers on location to military training areas to film demonstrations and consult with experts. When not on location, Ermey broadcast from a set resembling a military outpost, including a tent, a Jeep, and various other pieces of military gear which changed throughout the series. At times, he would also have a bulldog – usually symbolic of Marines
– on his show as well.

Ermey often provided comic relief in the form of light-hearted DI-style verbal abuse aimed at viewers; testing the effects of weapons on assorted objects (most often watermelons, which he described as his &quot;sworn enemy&quot;); and occasional appearances of &quot;Mini-Lee&quot;, an action figure styled in Ermey&#x27;s likeness, often seen berating a luckless G.I. Joe figure. His demeanor in character as host was similar to that of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, the character he portrayed in the Stanley Kubrick film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;. However, he only showed this attitude toward viewers, such as ordering them to return in time for the end of a commercial break.

The program had several DVD video releases, including selected episodes from the first seven seasons, as well as a blooper video called &quot;Mail Call: S.N.A.F.U.&quot; Reruns continue to be aired on the Military History Channel.

==Show name origin==
The title of &quot;Mail Call&quot; for the series was drawn from the military practice of the same name, in which soldiers assemble to receive mail from a designated person who calls out each recipient&#x27;s name in turn.

<text>The War of the Three Henrys (), also known as the Eighth War of Religion (), took place during 1585–1589, and was the eighth conflict in the series of civil wars in France known as the French Wars of Religion. It was a three-way war fought between:
*King Henry III of France, supported by the royalists and the politiques;
*King Henry of Navarre, later Henry IV of France, heir presumptive to the French throne and leader of the Huguenots, supported by Elizabeth I of England and the German protestant princes; and
*Henry of Lorraine, Duke of Guise, leader of the Catholic League, funded and supported by Philip II of Spain.

The underlying cause of the war was the looming royal succession crisis from the death of heir presumptive, Francis, Duke of Anjou (Henry III&#x27;s brother), on 10 June 1584, which made the Protestant Henry of Navarre heir to the throne of the childless Henry III, whose death would extinguish the House of Valois. On 31 December 1584, the Catholic League allied itself with Philip II of Spain by the Treaty of Joinville.

The war began when the Catholic League convinced (or forced) King Henry III to issue the Treaty of Nemours (7 July 1585), an edict outlawing Protestantism and annulling Henry of Navarre&#x27;s right to the throne. Henry III was possibly influenced by the royal favorite, Anne de Joyeuse. In September 1585, Pope Sixtus V excommunicated both Henry of Navarre and his cousin and leading general Condé to remove them from the royal succession.

== Course ==
=== 1585 ===
For the first part of the war, the royalists and the Catholic League were uneasy allies against their common enemy, the Huguenots. Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Mercœur, a prominent member of the Catholic League and governor of Brittany since 1582, conducted campaigns against the Protestants in 1585, 1587 and 1588, but was repeatedly defeated and forced to flee, thereby establishing his reputation as a poor warrior (he was jokingly nicknamed &quot;duc de Recule&quot; (the &quot;Duke of Retreat&quot;) by Brantôme). In the opening phase, Mercœur invaded Poitou in 1585 and fought against Henri, Prince of Condé (1552–1588) in the battle of Fontenay-le-Comte. Condé forced him to retreat back across the river Loire, capturing most of his baggage train and the spoils of war Mercœur had obtained at the beginning of his campaign, as well as taking several groups of Mercœur&#x27;s soldiers prisoner of war. In October 1585, Condé conducted the Siege of Brouage, but had to lift it when the castle of Angers was seized by treason, and then descended into fighting between various factions. By the time Condé arrived at Angers on 21 October, the castle was in the hands of 6,000 royalist enemies. He quickly retreated as his Protestant army was thrown into confusion, disarray and harassed by royalist forces. Condé&#x27;s army fell apart during his flight, with some escaping, while those captured were frequently put to death by Catholic forces.

=== 1586 ===
In early 1586, Henry of Navarre&#x27;s forces were far inferior to his opponents, and he sought to strengthen his position and build his army by buying time and avoiding a general engagement. To that end, Navarre published several declarations in which he lamented the miseries of war, denounced those fighting, and argued that he himself was not to be blamed for it, addressing the clergy (in reference to Pontius Pilate washing his hands in Matthew 27:24–25) with the words: &quot;If war delights you so much, if you prefer a battle to an argument, and a conspiracy to a council, I wash my hands of it, and the blood which may be shed shall be on your heads.&quot; In February 1586, the Prince of Condé occupied La Rochelle and the isle of Oléron and turned them into Huguenot strongholds. In early April 1586, St. Luc, the governor of Brouage, attacked La Rochelle for 24 hours with 5,000 troops, but was forced to retreat by the Protestant defenders, losing 400 soldiers and much of his baggage. Condé won a costly Huguenot victory at Saintes afterwards. In late 1586, Armand de Gontaut, baron de Biron besieged Marans, an important town providing access to La Rochelle, during which he was wounded. Henry of Navarre personally came to reinforce the region&#x27;s fortifications and boost morale. A messenger from Henry III requested both parties to cease hostilities and hold peace talks, leading Biron to withdraw and Navarre to promise to meet Henry III. The negotiations soon broke down amidst mistrust, not only between the two Henrys, but also between Henry III and the Catholic League (including Charles, Duke of Mayenne, one of his leading generals who failed to accomplish anything in the field and blamed Henry III for his failures).

=== 1587 ===
The (19 August 1587) was a Catholic victory. Henry III sent Joyeuse into the field against Navarre, while he himself intended to meet the approaching German and Swiss armies. At the Battle of Coutras (20 October 1587), Navarre, with English financial aid, defeated the royal army led by Joyeuse; the duke himself was slain at the battle. It was the first victory won by the Huguenots in the battlefield. For his part, Henry III successfully prevented the junction of the German and Swiss armies. The Swiss were his allies, and had come to invade France to free him from subjection; but Henry III insisted that their invasion was not in his favor, but against him, forcing them to return home. The Germans, led by Fabien I, Burgrave of Dohna, wanted to fight against the Duke of Guise, in order to win a victory like Coutras. He recruited some of the retreating Swiss, who had no scruple fighting against Guise. But at the Battle of Vimory (26 October 1587), Guise took the Germans by surprise, and routed them.

=== 1588 ===
In Paris, the glory of repelling the German and Swiss Protestants all fell to the Duke of Guise. The king&#x27;s actions were viewed with contempt. They thought that the king had invited the Swiss to invade, paid them for coming, and sent them back again. The king, who had really performed the decisive part in the campaign, and expected to be honored for it, was astounded that public voice should thus declare against him. The Catholic League had put its preachers to good use. In the meantime, the governments of Normandy and Picardy were vacated by the deaths of Joyeuse and Condé. Guise demanded Normandy for himself, and Picardy for his kinsman Aumale. The king denied both requests. The Catholic League was mobilized to resist the royal appointees in these provinces. Guise was forbidden from entering the capital. Guise ignored the prohibition and entered Paris. In the normal course of affairs this would have cost him his life, but the duke was popular with the masses. Further, after the Day of the Barricades, an uprising planned in part by the Spanish diplomat Bernardino de Mendoza, the king decided to flee to Blois.

After the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588, the king called the Estates-General in the midst of intrigue and plotting. Henry of Guise planned to assassinate the king and seize the throne, but the king struck first by having Guise killed by his guards, The Forty-Five.

=== 1589 ===
Open war erupted between the royalists and the Catholic League. Charles, Duke of Mayenne, Guise&#x27;s younger brother, took over the leadership of the League. At the moment it seemed that Henry III could not possibly resist his enemies. His power was effectively limited to Blois, Tours, and the surrounding districts. In these dark times the King of France finally reached out to his cousin and heir, the King of Navarre. Henry III declared that he would no longer allow Protestants to be called heretics, while the Protestants revived the strict principles of royalty and divine right. As on the other side ultra-Catholic and anti-royalist doctrines were closely associated, so on the side of the two kings the principles of tolerance and royalism were united. Henry III sought the aid of the Swiss, who were ready to join his cause. The Catholic royalists revived in their allegiance. At Pontoise the king saw himself at the head of 40,000 men. His newly recovered power may have inspired him with great designs; he planned to take Paris, in order to end the League&#x27;s power once and for all. The surrender of Paris seemed likely, even to the inhabitants. The preachers of the League sanctioned regicide, to avenge the murder of Guise. Jacques Clément, a fanatical Catholic friar, assassinated King Henry III at Saint-Cloud in August 1589.

With Henry III&#x27;s death, the coalition broke up. Many Catholic royalists were unwilling to serve the Protestant Henry IV, and the army retreated from Paris.

== Aftermath ==

In the spring, the extant Henry III of Navarre returned to the field; he won significant victories at Ivry and Arques and laid siege to Paris (despite being greatly outnumbered), but a Spanish army under Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma lifted the siege.

Deciding that further fighting was not worth the cost, Henry converted to Catholicism in 1593. The people of Paris were weary of war and disillusioned with the leaders of the League, and welcomed him amidst jubilation.

The French Wars of Religion lasted several more years, as League diehards and Spanish troops continued to resist the reunification of France. But once those were dealt with, the new king Henry IV&#x27;s reign inaugurated a time of commerce and peace, commonly regarded as a golden age, and he remains one of France&#x27;s most beloved kings.

<doc id="485467" wikidata="Q1642961" url="?curid=485467" title="Hénon map">
<text>In mathematics, the Hénon map, sometimes called Hénon–Pomeau attractor/map, is a discrete-time dynamical system. It is one of the most studied examples of dynamical systems that exhibit chaotic behavior. The Hénon map takes a point in the plane and maps it to a new point

:formula_1

The map depends on two parameters, and , which for the classical Hénon map have values of and . For the classical values the Hénon map is chaotic. For other values of and the map may be chaotic, intermittent, or converge to a periodic orbit. An overview of the type of behavior of the map at different parameter values may be obtained from its orbit diagram.

The map was introduced by Michel Hénon as a simplified model of the Poincaré section of the Lorenz model. For the classical map, an initial point of the plane will either approach a set of points known as the Hénon strange attractor, or diverge to infinity. The Hénon attractor is a fractal, smooth in one direction and a Cantor set in another. Numerical estimates yield a correlation dimension of 1.21 ± 0.01 or 1.25 ± 0.02 (depending on the dimension of the embedding space) and a Box Counting dimension of 1.261 ± 0.003 for the attractor of the classical map.

==Attractor==
The Hénon map maps two points into themselves: these are the invariant points. For the classical values of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; of the Hénon map, one of these points is on the attractor:

: formula_2
: formula_3

This point is unstable. Points close to this fixed point and along the slope 1.924 will approach the fixed point and points along the slope -0.156 will move away from the fixed point. These slopes arise from the linearizations of the stable manifold and unstable manifold of the fixed point. The unstable manifold of the fixed point in the attractor is contained in the strange attractor of the Hénon map.

The Hénon map does not have a strange attractor for all values of the parameters &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. For example, by keeping &quot;b&quot; fixed at 0.3 the bifurcation diagram shows that for &quot;a&quot; = 1.25 the Hénon map has a stable periodic orbit as an attractor.

Cvitanović et al. have shown how the structure of the Hénon strange attractor can be understood in terms of unstable periodic orbits within the attractor.

== Relationship to bifurcation diagram ==
If multiple Hénon maps are plotted, for each map varying the value of &quot;b&quot;, then stacking all maps together, a Bifurcation diagram is produced. A Bifurcation diagram that is folded like a taco. Hence its boomerang shape when viewed in 2D from the top.

== Decomposition ==

The Hénon map may be decomposed into the composition of three functions acting on the domain one after the other.

1) an area-preserving bend:
: formula_4,

2) a contraction in the &quot;x&quot; direction:
: formula_5,

3) a reflection in the line &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;:
: formula_6.

== One-dimensional decomposition ==
The Hénon map may also be deconstructed into a one-dimensional map, defined similarly to the Fibonacci Sequence.
:formula_7

== Four-dimensional extension ==

Although the Hénon map can be plotted on the &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-axes, by varying &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, we obtain two additional dimensions for plotting. The Hénon map therefore, can be plotted in four-dimensional space. We can visualize such a plot by viewing one hyperplane (i.e. one cube of space) at a time representing three axes, then moving along the fourth axis as time passes.

In the video example to the right, the three axes for each image in the video are &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;b&quot;. As time passes, it is the &quot;a&quot; axis that is moved through.

==Special cases and low-period orbits==
If one solves the one-dimensional Hénon map for the special case:
: formula_8
One arrives at the simple quadradic:
: formula_9
Or
: formula_10

The quadratic formula yields:
: formula_11

In the special case b=1, this is simplified to 
: formula_12

If, in addition, a is in the form formula_13 the formula is further simplified to 
: formula_14

In practice the starting point (X,X) will follow a 4-point loop in two dimensions passing through all quadrants.

: formula_15
: formula_16
: formula_17
: formula_18

==History==
In 1976 France, the Lorenz attractor is analyzed by the physicist Yves Pomeau who performs a series of numerical calculations with J.L. Ibanez. The analysis produces a kind of complement to the work of Ruelle (and Lanford) presented in 1975. It is the Lorenz attractor, that is to say, the one corresponding to the original differential equations, and its geometric structure that interest them. Pomeau and Ibanez combine their numerical calculations with the results of mathematical analysis, based on the use of Poincaré sections. Stretching, folding, sensitivity to initial conditions are naturally brought in this context in connection with the Lorenz attractor. If the analysis is ultimately very mathematical, Pomeau and Ibanez follow, in a sense, a physicist approach, experimenting with the Lorenz system numerically.

Two openings are brought specifically by these experiences. They make it possible to highlight a singular behavior of the Lorenz system: there is a transition, characterized by a critical value of the parameters of the system, for which the system switches from a strange attractor position to a configuration in a limit cycle. The importance will be revealed by Pomeau himself (and a collaborator, Paul Manneville) through the &quot;scenario&quot; of Intermittency, proposed in 1979.

The second path suggested by Pomeau and Ibanez is the idea of realizing dynamical systems even simpler than that of Lorenz, but having similar characteristics, and which would make it possible to prove more clearly &quot;evidences&quot; brought to light by numerical calculations. Since the reasoning is based on Poincaré&#x27;s section, he proposes to produce an application of the plane in itself, rather than a differential equation, imitating the behavior of Lorenz and its strange attractor. He builds one in an ad hoc manner which allows him to better base his reasoning.

In January 1976, Pomeau presented his work during a seminar given at the Côte d&#x27;Azur Observatory, attended by Michel Hénon. Michel Hénon uses Pomeau’s suggestion to obtain a simple system with a strange attractor.

==Koopman modes==
In dynamical system, the Koopman operator is a natural linear operator on the space of scalar fields. For general nonlinear systems, the eigenfunctions of this operator cannot be expressed in any nice form. Instead one must compute them numerically. These modes can give insight into the symbolic dynamics of chaotic maps like the Hénon map. In the mode provided, the stable manifold of the strange attractor can be clearly seen.
== Generalizations ==
A 3-D generalization for the Hénon map was proposed by Hitz and Zele. It is given by

formula_19.

For formula_20 and formula_21 it can be shown that almost all initial conditions inside the unit sphere generate chaotic signals with largest Lyapunov exponent formula_22.
Many other generalizations have been proposed in the literature. One can generate, for example, band-limited chaotic signals using digital filters in the feedback loop of the system.

<doc id="485472" wikidata="Q1064471" url="?curid=485472" title="Earnshaw's theorem">
<text>Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem states that a collection of point charges cannot be maintained in a stable stationary equilibrium configuration solely by the electrostatic interaction of the charges. This was first proven by British mathematician Samuel Earnshaw in 1842.
It is usually cited in reference to magnetic fields, but was first applied to electrostatic field.

Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem applies to classical inverse-square law forces (electric and gravitational) and also to the magnetic forces of permanent magnets, if the magnets are hard (the magnets do not vary in strength with external fields). Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem forbids magnetic levitation in many common situations.

If the materials are not hard, Werner Braunbeck&#x27;s extension shows that materials with relative magnetic permeability greater than one (paramagnetism) are further destabilising, but materials with a permeability less than one (diamagnetic materials) permit stable configurations.

==Explanation==

=== In electrostatics ===
Informally, the case of a point charge in an arbitrary static electric field is a simple consequence of Gauss&#x27;s law. For a particle to be in a stable equilibrium, small perturbations (&quot;pushes&quot;) on the particle in any direction should not break the equilibrium; the particle should &quot;fall back&quot; to its previous position. This means that the force field lines around the particle&#x27;s equilibrium position should all point inward, toward that position. If all of the surrounding field lines point toward the equilibrium point, then the divergence of the field at that point must be negative (i.e. that point acts as a sink). However, Gauss&#x27;s law says that the divergence of any possible electric force field is zero in free space. In mathematical notation, an electrical force deriving from a potential will always be divergenceless (satisfy Laplace&#x27;s equation):

formula_1

Therefore, there are no local minima or maxima of the field potential in free space, only saddle points. A stable equilibrium of the particle cannot exist and there must be an instability in some direction. This argument may not be sufficient if all the second derivatives of &quot;U&quot; are null&quot;.&quot;

To be completely rigorous, strictly speaking, the existence of a stable point does not require that all neighbouring force vectors point exactly toward the stable point; the force vectors could spiral in toward the stable point, for example. One method for dealing with this invokes the fact that, in addition to the divergence, the curl of any electric field in free space is also zero (in the absence of any magnetic currents).

=== In magnetostatics ===
It is also possible to prove this theorem directly from the force/energy equations for static magnetic dipoles (below). Intuitively, though, it is plausible that if the theorem holds for a single point charge then it would also hold for two opposite point charges connected together. In particular, it would hold in the limit where the distance between the charges is decreased to zero while maintaining the dipole moment – that is, it would hold for an electric dipole. But if the theorem holds for an electric dipole, then it will also hold for a magnetic dipole, since the (static) force/energy equations take the same form for both electric and magnetic dipoles.

As a practical consequence, this theorem also states that there is no possible static configuration of ferromagnets that can stably levitate an object against gravity, even when the magnetic forces are stronger than the gravitational forces.

Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem has even been proven for the general case of extended bodies, and this is so even if they are flexible and conducting, provided they are not diamagnetic, as diamagnetism constitutes a (small) repulsive force, but no attraction.

There are, however, several exceptions to the rule&#x27;s assumptions, which allow magnetic levitation.

=== In gravitostatics ===
Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem applies to static gravitational fields.

Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem applies in an inertial reference frame. But it is sometimes more natural to work in a rotating reference frame that contains a fictitious centrifugal force that violates the assumptions of Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem. Points that are stationary in a &quot;rotating&quot; reference frame (but moving in an inertial frame) can be absolutely stable or absolutely unstable. For example, in the restricted three-body problem, the effective potential from the fictitious centrifugal force allows the Lagrange points L4 and L5 to lie at local maxima of the effective potential field even if there is only negligible mass at those locations. (Even though these Lagrange points lie at local maxima of the potential field rather than local minima, they are still absolutely stable in a certain parameter regime due to the fictitious velocity-dependent Coriolis force, which is not captured by the scalar potential field.)

==Effect on physics==
For quite some time, Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem posed a startling question of why matter is stable and holds together, since much evidence was found that matter was held together electromagnetically despite the proven instability of static charge configurations. Since Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem only applies to stationary charges, there were attempts to explain stability of atoms using planetary models, such as Nagaoka&#x27;s Saturnian model (1904) and Rutherford&#x27;s planetary model (1911), where the point electrons are circling a positive point charge in the center. Yet, the stability of such planetary models was immediately questioned: electrons have nonzero acceleration when moving along a circle, and hence they would radiate the energy via a non-stationary electromagnetic field. Bohr&#x27;s model of 1913 formally prohibited this radiation without giving an explanation for its absence.

On the other hand, Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem only applies to point charges, but not to distributed charges. This led J. J. Thomson in 1904 to his plum pudding model, where the negative point charges (electrons, or &quot;plums&quot;) are embedded into a distributed positive charge &quot;pudding&quot;, where they could be either stationary or moving along circles; this is a configuration which is non-point positive charges (and also non-stationary negative charges), not covered by Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem. Eventually this led the way to Schrödinger&#x27;s model of 1926, where the existence of non-radiative states in which the electron is not a point but rather a distributed charge density resolves the above conundrum at a fundamental level: not only there was no contradiction to Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem, but also the resulting charge density and the current density are stationary, and so is the corresponding electromagnetic field, no longer radiating the energy to infinity. This gave a quantum mechanical explanation of the stability of the atom.

At a more practical level, it can be said that the Pauli exclusion principle and the existence of discrete electron orbitals are responsible for making bulk matter rigid.

==Proofs for magnetic dipoles==

===Introduction===
While a more general proof may be possible, three specific cases are considered here. The first case is a magnetic dipole of constant magnitude that has a fast (fixed) orientation. The second and third cases are magnetic dipoles where the orientation changes to remain aligned either parallel or antiparallel to the field lines of the external magnetic field. In paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials the dipoles are aligned parallel and antiparallel to the field lines, respectively.

===Background===
The proofs considered here are based on the following principles.

The energy U of a magnetic dipole with a magnetic dipole moment M in an external magnetic field B is given by
formula_2

The dipole will only be stably levitated at points where the energy has a minimum. The energy can only have a minimum at points where the Laplacian of the energy is greater than zero. That is, where
formula_3

Finally, because both the divergence and the curl of a magnetic field are zero (in the absence of current or a changing electric field), the Laplacians of the individual components of a magnetic field are zero. That is,
formula_4

This is proven at the very end of this article as it is central to understanding the overall proof.

===Summary of proofs===
For a magnetic dipole of fixed orientation (and constant magnitude) the energy will be given by
formula_5
where &quot;Mx&quot;, &quot;My&quot; and &quot;Mz&quot; are constant. In this case the Laplacian of the energy is always zero,
formula_6
so the dipole can have neither an energy minimum nor an energy maximum. That is, there is no point in free space where the dipole is either stable in all directions or unstable in all directions.

Magnetic dipoles aligned parallel or antiparallel to an external field with the magnitude of the dipole proportional to the external field will correspond to paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials respectively. In these cases the energy will be given by
formula_7
where &quot;k&quot; is a constant greater than zero for paramagnetic materials and less than zero for diamagnetic materials.

In this case, it will be shown that
formula_8
which, combined with the constant , shows that paramagnetic materials can have energy maxima but not energy minima and diamagnetic materials can have energy minima but not energy maxima. That is, paramagnetic materials can be unstable in all directions but not stable in all directions and diamagnetic materials can be stable in all directions but not unstable in all directions. Of course, both materials can have saddle points.

Finally, the magnetic dipole of a ferromagnetic material (a permanent magnet) that is aligned parallel or antiparallel to a magnetic field will be given by
formula_9

so the energy will be given by
formula_10

but this is just the square root of the energy for the paramagnetic and diamagnetic case discussed above and, since the square root function is monotonically increasing, any minimum or maximum in the paramagnetic and diamagnetic case will be a minimum or maximum here as well. There are, however, no known configurations of permanent magnets that stably levitate so there may be other reasons not discussed here why it is not possible to maintain permanent magnets in orientations antiparallel to magnetic fields (at least not without rotation—see spin-stabilized magnetic levitation.

===Detailed proofs===
Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem was originally formulated for electrostatics (point charges) to show that there is no stable configuration of a collection of point charges. The proofs presented here for individual dipoles should be generalizable to collections of magnetic dipoles because they are formulated in terms of energy, which is additive. A rigorous treatment of this topic is, however, currently beyond the scope of this article.

===Fixed-orientation magnetic dipole===
It will be proven that at all points in free space
formula_11

The energy &quot;U&quot; of the magnetic dipole M in the external magnetic field B is given by
formula_12

The Laplacian will be
formula_13

Expanding and rearranging the terms (and noting that the dipole M is constant) we have
formula_14

but the Laplacians of the individual components of a magnetic field are zero in free space (not counting electromagnetic radiation) so
formula_15

which completes the proof.

===Magnetic dipole aligned with external field lines===
The case of a paramagnetic or diamagnetic dipole is considered first. The energy is given by
formula_16

Expanding and rearranging terms,
formula_17

but since the Laplacian of each individual component of the magnetic field is zero,
formula_18

and since the square of a magnitude is always positive,
formula_19

As discussed above, this means that the Laplacian of the energy of a paramagnetic material can never be positive (no stable levitation) and the Laplacian of the energy of a diamagnetic material can never be negative (no instability in all directions).

Further, because the energy for a dipole of fixed magnitude aligned with the external field will be the square root of the energy above, the same analysis applies.

===Laplacian of individual components of a magnetic field===
It is proven here that the Laplacian of each individual component of a magnetic field is zero. This shows the need to invoke the properties of magnetic fields that the divergence of a magnetic field is always zero and the curl of a magnetic field is zero in free space. (That is, in the absence of current or a changing electric field.) See Maxwell&#x27;s equations for a more detailed discussion of these properties of magnetic fields.

Consider the Laplacian of the x component of the magnetic field
formula_20

Because the curl of B is zero,
formula_21
and
formula_22
so we have
formula_23

But since &quot;Bx&quot; is continuous, the order of differentiation doesn&#x27;t matter giving
formula_24

The divergence of B is zero,
formula_25
so
formula_26

The Laplacian of the &quot;y&quot; component of the magnetic field &quot;By&quot; field and the Laplacian of the &quot;z&quot; component of the magnetic field &quot;Bz&quot; can be calculated analogously. Alternatively, one can use the identity
formula_27
where both terms in the parentheses vanish.

=== Loopholes ===
Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem has no exceptions for non-moving permanent ferromagnets. However, Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem does not necessarily apply to moving ferromagnets, certain electromagnetic systems, pseudo-levitation and diamagnetic materials. These can thus seem to be exceptions, though in fact they exploit the constraints of the theorem.

Spin-stabilized magnetic levitation: Spinning ferromagnets (such as the Levitron) can, while spinning, magnetically levitate using only permanent ferromagnets, the system adding gyroscopic forces. (The spinning ferromagnet is not a &quot;non-moving ferromagnet&quot;). 

Switching the polarity of an electromagnet or system of electromagnets can levitate a system by continuous expenditure of energy. Maglev trains are one application.

Pseudo-levitation constrains the movement of the magnets usually using some form of a tether or wall. This works because the theorem shows only that there is some direction in which there will be an instability. Limiting movement in that direction allows levitation with fewer than the full 3 dimensions available for movement (note that the theorem is proven for 3 dimensions, not 1D or 2D).

Diamagnetic materials are excepted because they exhibit only repulsion against the magnetic field, whereas the theorem requires materials that have both repulsion and attraction. An example of this is the famous levitating frog (see Diamagnetism).

<text>The following is a list of Australian divisions in World War I, including all infantry and mounted divisions of the Australian Army during that conflict. During the war, Australia raised an all volunteer force for overseas service, known as the Australian Imperial Force, which subsequently served in several theatres, including the Gallipoli Campaign, the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and on the Western Front in France and Belgium. Between the start of the war in August 1914 and its end in November 1918, Australia raised a total of seven infantry divisions, one of which – the New Zealand and Australian Division – was also manned by New Zealanders. Of these, six took part in combat, while one – the 6th – was broken up in the United Kingdom and disbanded in September 1917 before being deployed due to manpower shortages. In addition, there were two mounted divisions raised: the ANZAC Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division.

<text>Gordon Daniel Conant (January 11, 1885 – January 2, 1953) was a Canadian lawyer, politician, and the 12th premier of Ontario, from 1942 to 1943.

==Personal life==
Born in Cedar Dale, East Whitby Township (now part of the City of Oshawa) in Ontario, Conant was a member of one of Oshawa&#x27;s early European families. He was educated at the University of Toronto and Osgoode Hall Law School, and was called to the Ontario Bar in 1912. He practiced law in Oshawa. In 1913 he married Verna Conant (née Smith), daughter of E. D. Smith. Together they had three children. Outside politics, Conant served as president of Oshawa General Hospital, Oshawa Chamber of Commerce, Rotary Club and South Ontario Canadian Club. In 1933, he was made a King&#x27;s Counsel. From 1943 to 1951, he was a Master of the Supreme Court of Ontario. In 1944, he was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Toronto. Conant died on January 2, 1953.

==Municipal politics==
In 1914, he was Deputy Reeve of Oshawa and Reeve in 1915. In 1916–1917, Conant became the youngest Mayor of Oshawa. After his office he dedicated himself to the development of hydro-electric power in Ontario. Due to his efforts, Ontario gained controlled of its own electrical system. In 1934, he became Crown Attorney for Ontario County.

==Provincial politics==
In the 1937 elections, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario representing the electoral district of Ontario. A Liberal, he was appointed Attorney-General of Ontario in 1937 in the government of Mitchell Hepburn.

Hepburn resigned suddenly, in October 1942, after a long series of erratic acts and especially due to his feud with Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King that split Hepburn&#x27;s cabinet and threatened the unity of his party. Hepburn announced that he was remaining leader of the party and Conant was selected as the new Premier by the Lieutenant Governor. The party, led by King&#x27;s supporters, demanded a leadership convention and Conant and Hepburn were forced to acquiesce. Conant ran for the leadership but collapsed hours before the leadership vote and withdrew his candidacy. Former Provincial Secretary and Registrar Harry Nixon was elected new Liberal leader and was thus appointed Premier in May 1943.

==Commemorations==
&quot;Conant Street&quot; in the Cedardale area of Oshawa is named after his family, as was the Conant Public School (now closed). Two other streets in the same neighbourhood were also named after him, &quot;Gordon Street&quot; and &quot;Daniel Street&quot;.

On July 20, 1966, the Ontario Archaeological and Historic Sites Board unveiled a blue and gold plaque in Lakeview Park. On August 14, 1966, the plaque was stolen and a week later was found in 26 feet of water at the Oshawa Harbour by local diver Robert Stevenson. The plaque was later moved closer to Henry House (one-third of the Oshawa Museum).

In 2010, the Ontario Heritage Trust&#x27;s Premier Gravesites Program placed a bronze/granite plaque and a Provincial flag outside the Mausoleum at Oshawa&#x27;s Union Cemetery, where Conant is interred.

<doc id="485482" wikidata="Q1077248" url="?curid=485482" title="Tigermilk">
<text>Tigermilk is the 1996 debut album from Scottish pop group Belle and Sebastian. Originally given a limited release (1,000 copies) by Electric Honey, the album was subsequently re-released in 1999 by Jeepster Records.

The album is named after an instrumental that did not end up on the album — it was later performed on Belle and Sebastian&#x27;s early tours. All of the songs on the album were written by Stuart Murdoch between 1993 and 1996, and originally performed solo on the Glasgow open mic circuit. Though he performs on the album, trumpet player Mick Cooke was not then an official member of the band.

==Recording and production==
Belle and Sebastian came together in Glasgow, Scotland in 1994 after vocalist Stuart Murdoch and bassist Stuart David met on a programme for unemployed musicians called Beatbox, funded by Stow College. In 1996, the pair reportedly enlisted the four five musicians they came across at a local café, settling on a line-up of Murdoch, David, guitarist Stevie Jackson, drummer Richard Colburn, keyboardist Chris Geddes, and cellist Isobel Campbell. Their initial performances took places at venues such as church crypts, libraries, and house parties. 

Concurrently, Colburn, who shared a flat with David at the time, attended a music business course at Stow, run by Alan Rankine of the Associates. The end goal of the course was to take two songs from the class and record and release them through Rankine&#x27;s record label Electric Honey. Colburn provided a demo tape Murdoch and David had recorded titled &quot;Rhode Island&quot; (later released as the &quot;Dog on Wheels&quot; EP). The college was extremely impressed and chose to support them in creating a full album. The band subsequently spent three days recording, finishing with an album&#x27;s worth of songs.

Murdoch recalls that the group was still quite loose knit at the time &quot;Tigermilk&quot; was recorded and that the full ensemble had not played together before getting into the studio. Many of the supporting instrument parts were shaped as the group recorded. After recording, though, &quot;we were a group, no question.&quot;

==Composition==
Author Dave Thompson, in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; (2000), called it as a &quot;gentle masterpiece, utterly in debt to Nick Drake (and a bit of Donovan too)&quot;. He said &quot;The State I Am In&quot;, the album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;buoys the occasional sag; that and the slickly loose instrumentation, harmonies which haunt the fringe of fear, and a wealth of emotionally crippled reflection.&quot; Nine of the ten songs featured on the album were recorded live over a three-day period, followed by two days of mixing. The only track not recorded during these sessions, &quot;Electronic Renaissance&quot;, originated as a demo Murdoch made at Beatbox using Cubase, and was mastered directly from a cassette recording Murdoch had made of the song being played on a local radio station, hence its lo-fidelity sound. Due to its stylistic difference from the other songs, its inclusion on the album initially proved controversial.

==Release==
Electric Honey issued &quot;Tigermilk&quot; in mid-1996, initially limited to 1,000 copies, which sold out in months. The band received praise from BBC radio DJs John Peel and Mark Radcliffe, subsequently earning them a radio session for the latter DJ in July 1996. Colburn said &quot;then record companies and fans started calling, and we thought &#x27;My God, what have we done? They soon signed to the London-based label Jeepster Records. &quot;Tigermilk&quot; was reissued in 1999; by this point, copies of the original were being sold for $600.

The album&#x27;s cover photograph was taken by Murdoch and features his girlfriend Joanne Kenney. Kenney also appeared on the cover of the &quot;Dog on Wheels&quot; EP.

==Legacy==

&quot;Tigermilk&quot; was well-received upon its initial release, and earned a glowing review from Scottish culture magazine &quot;The List&quot;, who gave the band their first national press. The album has since sold over 124,000 copies. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; included &quot;The State I Am In&quot; at number 17 on their &quot;Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s&quot;. The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

An eBay charity auction of the stuffed animal in the cover art of the &quot;Tigermilk&quot; album in 2019 was won by Lisa Carr of Washington, DC. Lisa Carr had also previously won an auction for bandleader Stuart Murdoch&#x27;s car in 2002 and an auction of the stuffed animal on the cover of &quot;Dog on Wheels&quot; in 2004.

==Early life==
MacNicol was born on April 10, 1954, in Dallas, Texas, the youngest of five children of Barbara Jean (née Gottlich), a homemaker, and John Wilbur Johnson, a Norwegian-American corporate executive who became an Episcopal priest later in life. He is a graduate of MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas.

==Career==
MacNicol performed at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis for two seasons from 1978 to 1979. He appeared in productions, which included &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;The Pretenders&quot;. He made his New York debut in the 1980 off-Broadway play, &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot;. The production then moved to Broadway in 1981, and he won the Theatre World Award. It was during this production that a casting agent noticed him and auditioned him for a role in the film, &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot;. In 1981 he landed the starring role in his first film, &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;, opposite Ralph Richardson.

In 1987, MacNicol starred in the Trinity Repertory Company&#x27;s original production of the stage adaptation of Robert Penn Warren&#x27;s &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot;, which first appeared at the Dallas Theater Center. The adaptation was developed in consultation with the author.

Among his other stage credits is the Broadway production of &quot;Black Comedy/White Lies&quot;. He has appeared in repertory theater, including the New York Shakespeare Festival where he played title roles in &quot;Richard II&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;; and in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, &quot;Rum and Coke&quot; and &quot;Found a Peanut&quot;.

In film, he plays the naive Southern writer who falls in love with Meryl Streep in &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot;, the museum curator Janosz Poha in &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;, and camp director Gary Granger alongside future &quot;Numbers&quot; co-star David Krumholtz in &quot;Addams Family Values&quot;. Other film credits include the films &quot;Housesitter&quot; and &quot;American Blue Note&quot;.

From 1992 to 1993 MacNicol starred opposite John Forsythe, Holland Taylor, David Hyde Pierce and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as press secretary Bradley Grist in the political television comedy &quot;The Powers That Be&quot;. In addition, he played Mario, a hotel receptionist, in the 1993 &quot;Cheers&quot; episode, &quot;Look Before You Sleep&quot;.

In 1994 MacNicol played the role of Alan Birch for the first season and part of the second season of &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; once creator David E. Kelley departed. He later rejoined Kelley in 1997 by taking a role on another TV series, &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, as a main guest star from Season 1 to Season 4 and a recurring character in Season 5. MacNicol is well known for his &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; performance as eccentric attorney John Cage, for which he won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 2001. From 2005 to 2021, he starred in the drama &quot;Numbers&quot; as physicist Dr. Larry Fleinhardt, taking a brief break from the show to perform as Tom Lennox in the sixth season of the hit FOX show &quot;24&quot;. MacNicol reprised his role as Lennox in the film &quot;24: Redemption&quot;. 

MacNicol has lent his voice to several comic book supervillains: Dr. Kirk Langstrom / Man-Bat in &quot;The Batman&quot;, David Clinton / Chronos in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, Professor Ivo in &quot;Young Justice&quot;, Dr. Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus in &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, X The Eliminator in &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; and the Mad Hatter in the video games &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. He also voiced Firefly in &quot;G.I. Joe: Renegades&quot;.

MacNicol played Dr. Stark, a pediatric surgeon, on &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;.

MacNicol was nominated for an Emmy for outstanding guest actor in the fifth season of &quot;Veep&quot;; however, his nomination was rescinded because he appeared in &quot;too many of the show’s episodes; the rules require that a guest actor nominee be in less than half of a season.&quot; Although he qualified when his entry was submitted, he later appeared very briefly in one more episode. He was nominated again in the same category for the seventh season of &quot;Veep&quot;.

==Personal life==
MacNicol has been married to Martha Cumming since 1986.

<text>The Valour class is a class of frigates built for the South African Navy. Part of the MEKO family of warships, the German shipbuilder Blohm+Voss officially designate the class as the MEKO A-200SAN.

Designed as a multiple purpose, multi capable frigate, the Valour class encompasses the general guided-missile anti-surface and anti-air role forming the core of the South African surface fleet. The Valour class frigates employ the use of stealth technology to avoid enemy radar and infra-red detection.

Four Valour class frigates were constructed for the South African Navy as part of the Strategic Defence Package 1999. The first, SAS &quot;Amatola&quot;, was commissioned in 2006, with the fourth and final, SAS &quot;Mendi&quot;, commissioned in March 2007. The frigates have a service life of 30–40 years. However, in May 2023, Rear Admiral B.K. Mhlana, Deputy Chief of the Navy, reported to the Joint Standing Committee on Defence that &quot;Mendi&quot; was the only frigate of her class still effectively operational, given cancellations and delays in refits for her sister ships. In 2024, a planned voyage by SAS &quot;Amatola&quot; to participate in the Russian Navy&#x27;s &quot;Navy Day&quot; in St. Petersburg had to be cancelled due to “current defects to the vessel”.

The Valour-class vessels are named in honor of acts of distinguished bravery in South African military history.

== Development ==
The concept for the Valour class (Project Sitron) was first conceived in the late 1990s as part of the Strategic Defence Package, in which the new South African ANC government was keen to modernise the armed forces after decades of apartheid-era United Nations sanctions. Since the 1970s, previous attempts to replace the aging Type-12 (President class) frigates, as well as the &#x27;W&#x27; (Jan van Riebeeck) class destroyers, had repeatedly been aborted due to sanctions, strategic considerations and financial cost. The Portuguese Carnation Revolution of 1974 axed efforts to acquire four João Coutinho-class corvettes (Project Taurus), and the delivery of three Type-69A light corvettes and two submarines from France was cancelled at the last minute after the imposition of mandatory UN sanctions in 1977. Following from the successful experience of constructing SAS &quot;Drakensberg&quot; in 1987, it was briefly considered that a class of frigates could be locally constructed at the same shipyard. However, an increasingly deteriorating security and financial situation by the late 1980s within South Africa put an end to the project. As the final Type-12 frigate was retired without replacement in 1985, the intensifying Border War forced the navy to shift operational focus away from the regional capabilities of large surface units to a purely localised coastal force, with a new core of offshore patrol vessels and mine hunters. As white minority rule came to a negotiated end by 1994, the Navy had lost all its major surface warships and suffered from a critical lack of anti-submarine and anti-air capability, operating nine increasingly obsolete strike craft OPVs and three aged diesel electric submarines.

The Spanish frigate design, the &quot;Álvaro de Bazán&quot; class topped an acquisition effort in 1995 under Project Falcon, however this was later cancelled in favour of the wider Strategic Defence Package.

In 1999, an initial tender of five general purpose warships that could negotiate the tough sea conditions off the South African coast was met with four designs being proposed by the United Kingdom (GEC F3000), Germany (MEKO A200), France () and Spain (Bazan 59B). The ANC Government was keen that the newly democratic South Africa would play a leading role in African peacekeeping missions, and as such required a naval force that had regional capability. The winning design had to be able to conduct sustained operations at sea - potentially far from a home port, provide gunfire and transport support to land forces, have helicopter capacity, and undertake a range of general offensive and defensive missions, as well as regular maritime patrols on behalf of law enforcement.

On 3 December 1999, a contract was signed with the European South African Corvette Consortium (ESACC) to provide four warships based on the German MEKO 200 design bid. ESACC consisted of Blohm+Voss, Thyssen Rheinstahl and Howaldtswerke Deutsche Werf, African Defence Systems (part of the French Thales defence group) and a number of South African companies. Originally termed corvettes for political reasons by the South African Navy, the Valour class design, officially the MEKO A200SAN, represented a quantum leap in multi-purpose capability, with a final procurement cost of R9.65 billion in 2007.

=== Construction ===
Construction began on the Valour class when the first steel was cut on 6 August 2001 for at the Blohm+Voss shipyards in Hamburg, Germany. was also assembled here. and were constructed separately at the Howaldtswerke Deutsche Werf shipyards in Kiel. All four frigates were first laid down between August 2001 and June 2002, launched by October 2003 and later delivered to South Africa by the end of 2004. The delivery programme was delayed by up to nine months after the discovery of defects in installed electrical cabling in the lead ship SAS &quot;Amatola&quot;. Further delays were not incurred to the programme as the electrical cabling at fault had not yet been fitted to the subsequent frigates. The majority of the combat suite, weapons and sensors were designed and built by South African companies, with the integration process taking between 2–3 years per ship in South Africa. Final commissioning into service was achieved by 2007 for all four vessels.

== Characteristics and design ==
The A200SAN design is an evolution of the MEKO 200 series of frigates that have been built for the Turkish, Australian and New Zealand navies since the late 1980s. Experience has been gained by Blohm+Voss when optimising weight distribution, trim, low noise and manoeuvrability. Focusing on providing a frigate for navies with a restricted budget, the design ensures a low crew complement, comfortable accommodation, and plenty of space for future technological upgrades on a modular construction.

The A200SAN design offers very solid sea-keeping due to high forward buoyancy and stability reserves to accommodate future upgrades, making the class perfect when engaging in sustained operations in the rough sea conditions found off the South African coast. The Valour class has a strong focus on conflict survivability and was built around the latest principles of stealth design in naval construction. The design has the extensive use of the ‘X-form’ structure in which right angles and vertical surfaces are avoided, whilst techniques to reduce an infrared signature allow for pre-cooled exhaust gasses to be expelled just above the waterline. A degree of proactive protection has also been incorporated into the design, along with an optimised layout and damage control features with light ceramic and Kevlar armour shielding critical compartments and the dividing up of the hull into zones with independent fire fighting, electrical and HVAC systems. More than 10 watertight compartments, as well as double bulkheads and box girders running lengthwise, form the steel hull which has been proven to prevent break-up. Blohm+Voss claim that the Valour class has a radar signature 50% smaller than a comparable vessel of their size, 75% less infrared emissions than previous designs, as well as 20% lower life-cycle cost, 25% lower displacement and 30% fewer crew required.

The Valour class has been designed with growth in mind, based around future technology and flexible mission requirements. The design allows for a flexible mission bay with space for two ISO containers, a recessed boat bay on either side of the ship, and wide passageways to aid maintenance, upgrades and store replenishment. Even after the fitting out of weapons systems and sensors, the A200SAN allows for a 200-tonne margin of future growth, 20% spare electrical generation, and 37% spare cooling capacity.

The propulsion system of the class is unique amongst other warships. Using a CODAG-WARP arrangement (Combined Diesel and Gas turbine - Waterjet and Refined Propellers), the design utilises two controllable pitch propellers and single water jet. In diesel-only mode the arrangement is very fuel-efficient as a single engine can drive both shafts for speeds of up to . An independent centre-line gas turbine drives the water jet, coupled by a small reduction gear, eliminating the need for another combining gearbox. The water jet can be used alone, or combined with the diesel engines to achieve the maximum speed of nearly . A reverse-thrust bucket is also fitted that can be raised to redirect the water jet forward, giving the class the shortest stopping distance of any other similar warship.

* I – Economical mode: One diesel engine driving both shafts, maximum propeller speed: 150 rpm and up to 18 knots.
* II – Maneuvering mode: Both diesel engines driving both shafts, maximum propeller speed: 200 rpm.
* III – CODAG-WARP: Both diesel engines and the gas turbines engaged, maximum propeller speed: 215 rpm and a maximum speed of over .
* IV – Gas turbine only: Gas turbines powering water jet only.

These frigates are expected to spend about 80% of their at-sea time in modes I and II, allowing for a maximum range of at . The A200SAN is also conspicuous for the lack of any funnel or uptakes in the centre of the ship, resulting in more space for above deck weapons and accommodation. The ships are exceptionally quiet and vibration-free as a result, and add further to their already high level of stealth characteristics.

The ship&#x27;s steering gear consists of a steering unit and twin semi-balanced underhung rudders. There is an emergency steering station in the superstructure in the event of damage to the bridge and they can also be operated by hand from the steering gear compartment. To improve the ship&#x27;s performance in a seaway, they are fitted with a B+V Simplex Compact stabiliser system.

This class of warship has seven independent Noske Kaeser air-conditioning plants allowing the ship to operate at a pre-set temperature and moisture level in ocean water ranging between , and the air temperature between . This also keeps the air pressure in the citadel five millibars higher than on the outside to prevent the drawing in of RBC (radioactive, biological, or chemical) contamination. These ships are also fitted with Sulzer und Weise seawater fire-fighting pumps and sprinkler systems. These are also ready to wet down the warship&#x27;s ammunition magazines. In addition, a fire-extinguishing system protects the gas turbine and diesel engineering areas. The galleys are fitted with an ANSUL system and the flight deck and hangar with a Noske Kaeser Hy FEx foam fire extinguishing system. Two Pall Rochem reverse-osmosis plants generate of fresh water each every 24 hours. This water is provided to the galleys, messes, and drinking water supplies, and it is also used for cooling the guns, the air-conditioners, and the engine room, in addition for washing the helicopters. Water pumped to the guns, sensors, and air-conditioners is chilled by two Noske Kaeser refrigerators. An oil-fired hot-water boiler, made by the same company, provides the ship&#x27;s heating, whereas the hot water for the galley and messes comes from a , 45-kilowatt electric geyser. With a main crew of 92, plus eight aircrew, stores can last for up to 28 days when on station.

== Weapons, countermeasures, capabilities and sensors ==
The four Valour-class frigates are armed with surface-to-air and anti-ship missiles, a range of multi-purpose weaponry, and can operate helicopters that significantly improve and extend operational ability. The class have been hailed as the most powerful surface units in sub-Saharan Africa, and have restored South African naval pre-eminence.

The majority of the combat suite has largely been designed and built by South African companies. The &quot;SA Corvette Group&quot; includes Altech Defence Systems, Kentron, LIW Division of Denel, Futuristic Business Solutions, Saab Avitronics, Grintek Electronics, Reutech and African Defence Systems (a joint venture between Altech and Thales)

=== Naval guns ===
The ships are equipped with one OTO Melara 76 mm/62 compact Naval Gun. Depending on type of ammunition in use, a range of between with a rate of fire of 85 rounds per minute. For air targets, effective range is reduced to .

They also mount one Denel 35mm Dual Purpose Gun (CIWS). The weapon&#x27;s primary role of providing vessel point defence against aerial hostiles and missiles, with a secondary purpose of engaging surface and shore targets. With a range of ammunition, effective firing range for air targets is 4 km, with maximum firing range for surface vessels at . High speed missiles can be intercepted at a range.

Two Mk1 Oerlikon 20 mm cannon are also fitted. They have a maximum engagement range of 6 km, with an effective range of . A sustained rate of fire of 900–1,000 rounds per minute.

Two 12.7 mm Reutech Rogue machine guns are mounted with rate of fire over 1,000 rounds per minute, with an effective range of and a maximum firing distance of .
=== Anti-air warfare ===
The ships have a 16-cell vertical launching system, holding up to 16 Denel Dynamics Umkhonto-IR Block 2 surface-to-air missiles, with a range of up to . Th Umkhonto system can engage up to four targets simultaneously. The all-weather missiles can reach distances of up to 8 km in 18 seconds and have countermeasure resistance.

=== Anti-surface warfare ===
The vessels are fitted with two 4-cell launchers for up to eight MBDA MM40 Block 2 Exocet surface-to-surface missiles, with a range of . Maximum speed of , with sea-skimming capabilities, preprogramed manoeuvres, active radar seeker and a high explosive fragmentation warhead.

=== Anti-submarine warfare ===
The ships are fitted for but not with two torpedo tubes.

=== Countermeasures ===
The ships are equipped with Saab Grintek Avitronics SME 100/200 ESM (Intercept and Jammer) &amp; ELINT and two Saab Grintek Avitronics MRL Super Barricade chaff launchers (96 decoys) for countermeasures.

=== Electronic systems and sensors ===
40% of each vessel&#x27;s costs are related to the combat-management system installed on the Valour class, with 75% of the combat suite being developed in South Africa. 
The frigates mount a Thales Naval France MRR-3D NG G-band multi-role surveillance radar which is a lightweight phased array antenna that operates as both a surveillance radar and a self-defence system sensor with automatic mode switching. The MRR-3D NG in surface mode can detect low and medium-level targets at ranges of up to , and in long-range 3D air surveillance setting up to 140 km. For self-defence, any threat within a radius of 60 km can be detected and tracked.

Two Reutech RTS 6400 monopoles X band (I/J bands) combined radar and optronic trackers are also equipped that are a high performance, domestically designed and manufactured radar tracker with a 60 km operational range. They also mount a Teutech Electro-optical Tracker, a Tellumat Integrated Naval Identification Friend or Foe System, M-Tek Target Designation Sights, a Thales UMS4132 Kingklip Sonar, and an MDS 3060 Obstacle Avoidance Sonar.

Also included is a computer-based &quot;Naval Logistic Management System&quot; that controls the on-board maintenance planning and execution by automatically generating weekly check-lists and repair schedules. Replenishment at sea can take place over the bow, over the stern, or amidships. Liquid and dry goods as well as passengers weighing up to can be transferred this way. Vertical replenishment via helicopters can take place over the helideck and/or the foredeck.

=== Aviation ===
The hangar and flight deck design enables a wide range of helicopter options to fit requirements such as:

Two Westland Super Lynx or

One Westland Super Lynx and two UAVs or

One Atlas Oryx or

One Denel Rooivalk

== Upgrades and future technologies ==
In 2016 it was announced that the Valour class would benefit from a mid-life upgrade over the next decade that would extend service life beyond 2035, with improvement to both capability and capacity. However, as of 2021 the mid-life programme is still reportedly in the concept and feasibility study phase, with further progress on hold due to lack of adequate funding. Of four frigates in the class, only &quot;Amatola&quot; had undergone a partial refit in 2014–15. Plans for refitting three of the four remaining frigates were to be finalised based on the availability of funding to enable phased refits. The navy planned to prioritize essential maintenance and repair of the frigates &quot;Spioenkop&quot; and &quot;Mendi&quot; in the interim. In August 2021 the Department of Defence reported to Parliament that the average cost estimate for a frigate refit was R687 million. Were funding to be made available, envisaged possible upgrades included:

* The main naval gun, the OTO Melara 76 mm/62 compact, will be upgraded to enhance both fire-support and self-defence capabilities. The current calibre has long been known to be an interim cost-saving measure, with senior naval officials well aware that the gun is far too small to support operations. Improvement could range from the more affordable: upgrading the 76 mm/62 from Compact to Super Rapid, with the rate of fire increasing from 85 rounds per minute to 120, to the more costly: replacement with the 127 mm/64 Lightweight Naval Gun. Depending on the type of ammunition in use, range could increase from compared to the 76 mm/62. Although a slower rate of fire at 32 rounder per minute, the 127mm/62 would offer far greater hitting power. The naval gun is already in service with four navies, with another three as future operators, including Spain, the Netherlands and Canada. The Algerian &quot;El Radii&quot;-class frigate is equipped with the 127 mm/64, and is in essence a sister class to the Valour as the &quot;El Radii&quot; are also based on the MEKO A-200 design.
* Land attack missiles: the class deliberately lacks a land-attack cruise missile capability for political reasons: such weapons are seen by some as “too aggressive” and out of keeping with the Valour-class&#x27;s “defensive posture”. However, like its peers the South African Navy recognises the growing importance of fighting in the littoral battlespace and supporting land forces during operations. As a result, a land attack missile capability is likely to be investigated as funds become available and sensitivities are assuaged.
* Current stock of Exocet MM40 Block 2 antiship missiles range, will be upgraded to Block 3 standard of range.
* The Denel Umkhonto surface-to-air missile will be upgraded to maintain superiority over evolving threats. Current stocks are of the short range point-defence Umkhonto-IR missile with an operational radius of . It has not yet been announced whether the South African Navy wish to purchase the improved medium range, area defence, infrared homing (Umkhonto ER-IR) with a radius of , or the highly capable beyond visual range Umkhonto-R with a radius of over , which is still in development alongside the Brazilian Navy. Alternatively, enhancements have been made to the current IR Block 2 missile, with ranges extended from 15 km to over . This could therefore be the most affordable option.
* The Thales MRR G-band air/surface search radar and the majority of the electronic warfare suite, such as the Grintek EWASION system and the Saab Avitronics radar support system will be replaced. 
* The existing combat management system, including the Electro-optical tracker will be replaced, or upgraded by a new system. 
* New rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIBs) with improved communication systems will be carried.
* Embarked Super Lynx maritime helicopters will have enhanced self-protection systems.
* After operational experience in the Mozambique Channel on anti-piracy duty, the class will be fitted with bow thrusters to improve manoeuvrability when working in confined and austere ports in the region. 
* Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV): It is anticipated each of the frigates and the multi-purpose hull vessels will carry an AUV for minehunting purposes, obviating the need for specialist vessels.
* Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV): The Navy is following the ongoing development of rotor-propelled UAVs and plan to purchase some, to a scale of two per ship, when the technology matures.
* Indications suggest that the class will be equipped with close-in detection systems in order to face new threats that have emerged in the littoral environment. IED technology has spread to the African region and reports of missile attacks by non-state actors have increased in recent years.

== Ships of the class ==


=== Naming ===
The MEKO A-200SAN ships of the South African Navy are collectively called the Valour class, and each commemorates an incident of conspicuous bravery. &quot;The symbolism, however, is not in the battle itself, and who the victors were, but the extreme valour shown by the forces involved — both the victors and the defeated&quot; said navy spokesman Commander Brian Stockton.

&quot;Amatola&quot; is named for the redoubt of the famed Xhosa chief Sandile, who fought British colonial expansion in the 19th century,

&quot;Isandhlwana&quot; is named after the hill dominating the site of one of the most famous battles of the Anglo-Zulu war of 1879.

&quot;Spioenkop&quot; is named for the January 1900 battle between Boer and British forces for the possession of the hill on the banks of the Thukela (Tugela) River in what is now KwaZulu-Natal. Spioenkop hill marks the site of one of the bloodiest battles of the 1899–1902 Anglo Boer War.

There is a progression in the names and the fourth frigate takes its name from a naval incident in World War I – but unlike the others, her name commemorates not a battle, but valour during a maritime disaster. The 4,230-gross-register-ton (GRT) passenger ship was ferrying the mostly-Pondo 5th Battalion, SA Native Labour Corps (SANLC) from Britain to France when the steamer collided with the 11,000 GRT liner SS &quot;Darro&quot; during the early hours of 21 February 1917. Described as South Africa&#x27;s worst naval disaster, 607 members of the SANLC, nine of their white countrymen and 33 British sailors died when the troopship sank off St Catherine&#x27;s Light in the English Channel. The Rev. Isaac Wauchope Dyobha led the doomed men in funeral song and dance as their ship went down. On her way home from Germany, SAS &quot;Mendi&quot;, with , laid a wreath at the coordinates of the disaster on 23 August 2004.

== Operational deployment ==
Since the Valour class were commissioned in 2006/2007, the four frigates have been the South African Navy&#x27;s most capable and important surface assets. Although the likelihood of a naval engagement with another state actor in the Southern African region is highly unlikely in South African planning, the frigate force maintains a credible military deterrent and protects national interests. The main operational duties of the Valour class have been engaging in anti-smuggling operations, fishery protection, participating in African Union peacekeeping missions and tackling regional piracy with international partners. The class have also been heavily utilised in international training exercises and visits with other naval forces, particularly the United States Navy, the German Navy, the French Navy and the Royal Navy.

In 2010, the four frigates were deployed to provide air and sea security for the FIFA World Cup that was being hosted by South Africa. Three frigates, at any one time, acted as guardships off the cities of Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Durban.

Since 2011 the deployment to the Mozambique Channel to tackle piracy under Operation Copper has been one of the major and long-standing focuses of the frigate force. After increased piracy for a number of years, fellow South African Development Community members requested help in policing the crucial import and export sea lane. Since the beginning of operations, every frigate has been deployed on rotation and maritime piracy has fallen substantially, with marines regularly being embarked in order to board suspect vessels.

<text>M&amp;M&#x27;s are color-varied sugar-coated dragée chocolate confectionery, each of which has the letter &quot;m&quot; printed in lower case in white on one side, consisting of a candy shell surrounding a filling which varies depending upon the variety of M&amp;M&#x27;s. The original candy has a semi-sweet chocolate filling which, upon introduction of other variations, was branded as the &quot;plain, normal&quot; variety. Peanut M&amp;M&#x27;s, which feature a peanut coated in milk chocolate, and finally a candy shell, were the first variation to be introduced, and they remain a regular variety. Numerous other variations have been introduced, some of which are regular widespread varieties (peanut butter, almond, pretzel, crispy, dark chocolate, and caramel) while others are limited in duration or geographic availability. M&amp;M&#x27;s are the flagship product of the Mars Wrigley Confectionery division of Mars Inc.

The candy originated in the United States in 1941, and M&amp;M&#x27;s have been sold in over 100 countries since 2003. They are produced in different colors, some of which have changed over the years. The candy-coated chocolate concept was possibly copied by Forrest Mars Sr. from Smarties, which he may have encountered during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). The sugar coating made it possible to carry chocolate in warm climates without it melting. The company&#x27;s longest-lasting slogan reflects this: &quot;the milk chocolate that melts in your mouth, not in your hand.&quot;

A traditional milk chocolate M&amp;M weighs about 0.91 grams / 0.032 ounces and has about 4.7 calories (kcal) of food energy (1.7 kcal from fat). Contrary to common belief, each colored M&amp;M does not have a different flavor and all possess the same chocolate taste.

==History==
===1940–70s: Beginnings===

In the 1930s, Forrest Mars Sr., son of the Mars Company founder, Frank C. Mars, saw soldiers in the Spanish Civil War eating British-made Smarties. These are chocolate pellets with a colored shell of what confectioners call hard panning (essentially hardened sugar syrup) surrounding the outside, preventing the sweets (candies) from melting. Mars received a patent for his own process on March 3, 1941. 

Production began in 1941 in a factory located at 285 Badger Avenue in Clinton Hill, Newark, New Jersey. When the company was founded it was M&amp;M Limited. The two Ms represent the names of Forrest E. Mars Sr. and Bruce Murrie, the son of the Hershey Chocolate&#x27;s president, William F. R. Murrie, who had a 20 percent share in the product. The arrangement allowed the candies to be made with Hershey chocolate, as Hershey had control of the rationed chocolate at the time.

Nestlé archives show&lt;ref name=&quot;mashed/smarties-mms&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; that George Harris of Rowntree and Forrest Mars Sr. agreed, after much negotiation, to share the marketplace rather than compete, with Rowntree making Mars Bars in Canada, Erie and South Africa and with Mars making M&amp;M&#x27;s in America without competition from Smarties, and Rowntree did not attempt to sue Mars for stealing their concept.&lt;ref name=&quot;thevintagenews/mm-smarties&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The company&#x27;s first big customer was the U.S. Army, which saw the invention as a way to allow soldiers to carry chocolate in tropical climates without it melting. During World War II, the candies were exclusively sold to the military. The resulting demand caused an increase in production and the company moved its factory to bigger quarters at 200 North 12th Street in Newark, New Jersey. In 1958, it moved to a bigger factory at Hackettstown. A second factory was opened in Cleveland, Tennessee, in 1978. Today, about half of the production of M&amp;M&#x27;s occurs at the New Jersey factory, and half at the Tennessee factory.
In 1949, the brand introduced the tagline &quot;The milk chocolate that melts in your mouth, not in your hand.&quot; In 1950, a black &quot;M&quot; was imprinted on the candies giving them a unique trademark. It was changed to white in 1954. In the early 1950s, the Midwest Research Institute (now MRIGlobal) in Kansas City, Missouri, worked on behalf of M&amp;M&#x27;s to perfect a process whereby of chocolate centers could be coated every hour. Peanut M&amp;M&#x27;s were introduced in 1954 but first appeared only in the color tan. In 1960, M&amp;M&#x27;s added the yellow, red, and green colors.

In 1976, the color orange was added to the mix to replace red, which was discontinued in response to the &quot;red dye scare&quot; over Red Dyes #2 and #4 having been evaluated as carcinogenic. Although M&amp;M&#x27;s were made with the less controversial Red Dye #40, the public was wary of any food being dyed red. Red M&amp;M&#x27;s were re-introduced in 1987.

===1980s: Expanding internationally===
In the 1980s, M&amp;M&#x27;s were introduced internationally to Australia, Canada, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom.

M&amp;Ms Royals were marketed in the early 1980s with an advertising campaign that said: &quot;Now chocolate&#x27;s got a whisper of mint.&quot; They were colored pale green or brown and showed a crown rather than an M&amp;Ms logo.

Although they were marketed and then withdrawn in the 1960s, almond-centred M&amp;M&#x27;s were available again in 1988 in limited release, with appearances only during Christmas and Easter times; they became a standard part of the product line in 1992.

Also in 1986, M&amp;M&#x27;s launched Holidays Chocolate Candies for Easter and Christmas, with the Easter candies having a bunny, chick, and egg symbols on pastel-colored shells, and the Christmas candies having pine tree, bell, and candle symbols on red and green shells; with the latter also having a special mint flavor. By 1993, the holiday symbols were replaced with the standard trademark &quot;M&quot;.

===1990s: New flavors ring===
In 1991, Peanut Butter M&amp;M&#x27;s were released. These candies have peanut butter inside the chocolate shell and the same color scheme as the other varieties. As of at least 2013, the size of the peanut butter M&amp;M has become slightly smaller. In 1995, tan M&amp;Ms were discontinued to be replaced by blue. To introduce the new color, the Home Shopping Network televised a promotional video for the blue M&amp;M. Producer Jon Watson became the first man to wear the famous blue M&amp;M suit.

During the 1990s, Europe first began to adopt the M&amp;M&#x27;s brand name, replacing existing products. Two of these were known as &quot;Treats&quot; and &quot;Bonitos.&quot; In 1996, Mars introduced &quot;M&amp;M&#x27;s Minis&quot;, smaller candies usually sold in plastic tubes instead of bags. In 1999, Crispy M&amp;M&#x27;s were released. They were slightly larger than the milk chocolate variety and also featured a crispy wafer center. Crispy M&amp;M&#x27;s were discontinued in the United States in 2005, before being reintroduced in 2015 and re-discontinued in 2022 to make way for the Crunchy Cookie flavor; however, they remained continually available in Europe and Australia.

===2000s–present: New flavors and re-releases===
In July 2001, dulce de leche M&amp;M&#x27;s were introduced in five markets with large Hispanic populations: Los Angeles, California; San Diego, California; Miami, Florida; McAllen-Brownsville, Texas; and San Antonio, Texas. The flavor never became popular with the Hispanic community, who preferred existing M&amp;M&#x27;s flavors, and it was discontinued in most areas by early 2003.

Several other flavors of M&amp;M debuted throughout the 2010s. These include Pretzel M&amp;M&#x27;s, released in 2010, limited edition Coffee Nut M&amp;M&#x27;s, released in 2016, Caramel M&amp;M&#x27;s, released in 2017, limited edition English Toffee M&amp;M&#x27;s, released in 2019, and limited edition Hazelnut Spread M&amp;M&#x27;s, also released in 2019.

A range of additional products was launched in the 2000s and 2010s to expand beyond the traditional line of candies. A chocolate bar called the M-Azing was initially released in 2004, and subsequently relaunched in 2013, oversized candies titled &quot;Mega M&amp;M&#x27;s&quot; were briefly released in 2007 to promote the &quot;Shrek&quot; film series, before being introduced as a standalone product in 2014, M&amp;M cookies began to be sold in the United States in 2016, and M&amp;M chocolate blocks were released in Australia in 2017.

In 2020, Fudge Brownie M&amp;M&#x27;s were released in the United States. They were discontinued in April 2024.

On September 28, 2022, the introduction of purple M&amp;M&#x27;s was announced, as well as their newest spokescandy, Purple.

==Marketing==
Over the years, marketing has helped build and expand the M&amp;M&#x27;s brand. Computer-animated graphics, personification of the candies as characters with cartoon-like storytelling, and various merchandising techniques including the introduction of new flavors, colors and customizable merchandise have helped to increase the brand&#x27;s recognition as a candy icon.

In 1982, the Mars candy bar company rejected the inclusion of M&amp;M&#x27;s in the new Steven Spielberg film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. However, competitor Hershey took a chance with their Reese&#x27;s Pieces, which are similar to M&amp;M&#x27;s but contain a peanut butter filling. With the film&#x27;s blockbuster success, Reese&#x27;s Pieces sales dramatically increased, perhaps by as much as 300%.

===Marketing campaigns===
Between 1982 and 1987, its slogan was &quot;All the World Loves M&amp;M&#x27;s&quot;, accompanied by a TV jingle of the same name. Actor Joel Higgins, then co-starring in the NBC-TV sitcom &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;, co-wrote the song.

In 1990, M&amp;M&#x27;s exhibited at New York&#x27;s Erie County Fair a life-size fiberglass cow covered with 66,000 M&amp;M candies—each adhered by hand with the &quot;m&quot; logo on each candy facing outward. According to a website run by the cow&#x27;s designer, Michael Adams, the stunt earned M&amp;M Mars $1 million in free publicity because it was reported on by &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine, as well as the &quot;New York Post&quot;, UPI and WABC-TV, and &quot;Live with Regis&quot;.

In 1995, the company ran the M&amp;M&#x27;s Color Campaign, a contest in which participants were given the choice of selecting purple, blue, or pink as the color of a new variety of M&amp;M&#x27;s. The announcement of the winning color (blue) was carried on most of the television networks&#x27; news programs, as well as the talk shows of David Letterman and Jay Leno. As part of the contest results, the company had the Empire State Building lighted in blue. Although the financial details of these deals were not disclosed and neither was the campaign&#x27;s effect on sales, one marketing book estimated that the company &quot;collected millions&quot; in free publicity and that the campaign &quot;certainly&quot; resulted in an increasing of the brand&#x27;s awareness.

In 1996, Mars produced Christmas-themed advertisement for the candies in which the Red and Yellow characters run into Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. Similarly to competitor Hershey&#x27;s own Christmas-themed commercial, the commercial proved immensely successful and has re-aired every December since that year, becoming their longest-running television commercial.

In 1998, M&amp;M&#x27;s were styled as &quot;The Official Candy of the New Millennium&quot;, as MM is the Roman numeral for 2000. This date was also the release of the rainbow M&amp;M&#x27;s, which are multi-colored and filled with a variety of different fillings.

In 2000, &quot;Plain&quot; M&amp;M&#x27;s (a name created in 1954 when &quot;Peanut&quot; M&amp;M&#x27;s were introduced) were renamed &quot;Milk Chocolate&quot; M&amp;M&#x27;s, and pictures of the candy pieces were added to the traditional brown and white packaging.

In 2004, M&amp;M&#x27;s adopted the 1967 Petula Clark song &quot;Colour My World&quot; for its TV ads, albeit using newly recorded versions with other singers.

===Joint marketing campaigns===
In 1990, Mars Snackfood US signed up to be a sponsor for NASCAR in the NASCAR Cup Series. Drivers for the M&amp;M&#x27;s-sponsored car through the years have included Ernie Irvan (1999), Ken Schrader (2000–02), Elliott Sadler (2003–06), Ricky Rudd (2007), David Gilliland (2006–07), Kyle Busch (2008–current, won 2015 Sprint Cup Series Championship &amp; 2019 Monster Energy Cup Series Championship), Michael McDowell, Matt Crafton, Erik Jones and David Ragan. 2022 would be Mars final year as Busch’s sponsor. Mars has also sponsored Busch in the Xfinity Series and Craftsman Truck Series along with Busch’s team, Kyle Busch Motorsports. Mars sponsored the 2022 NASCAR Cup Race at Pocono, titled the “M&amp;M’s Fan Appreciation 400”. 

The introduction of the blue M&amp;M to Australia was promoted by the Australian Football League&#x27;s Carlton Football Club, which wore sky-blue colored guernseys in one of its matches in 1997 instead of its traditional navy blue – a color which the successful and fiercely traditional club had worn since the 1870s. In 2010, Mars Snackfood Australia described it as the most successful promotional campaign it had ever engaged in.

In April 2005, M&amp;M&#x27;s ran the &quot;mPire&quot; promotion to tie in with the &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; film release. M&amp;M&#x27;s were offered in dark chocolate varieties (regular and Peanut) for the first time after a string of &quot;Addams Family&quot; M&amp;M&#x27;s commercials.

In May 2004, M&amp;M&#x27;s ran a &quot;Shrek 2&quot; promotion to tie in with the film&#x27;s release. M&amp;M&#x27;s were offered &quot;ogre-sized&quot; (65% larger) in swamp/ogre colors. They were sold at many stores displayed in huge cardboard-cutout ogre displays. In the summer of 2005, Mars added &quot;Mega M&amp;M&#x27;s&quot; to the lineup. These candies, at 55% larger than the traditional M&amp;M&#x27;s, were a little smaller than the ogre-sized version. They were available in Milk Chocolate and Peanut varieties. The colors for Mega M&amp;M&#x27;s were changed to less-bright colors, ostensibly to appeal to older consumers: teal (replacing green), beige (replacing orange), maroon (replacing red), gold (replacing yellow), blue-gray (replacing blue), and brown.

In July 2006, Dark Chocolate M&amp;M&#x27;s reappeared in a purple package, followed in 2007 by Dark Chocolate Peanut M&amp;M&#x27;s. Also in 2006, the company piloted White Chocolate M&amp;M&#x27;s as a tie-in with their &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; promotion. The company also offered eight new flavors of M&amp;M&#x27;s via online sales, as well as at M&amp;M&#x27;s World locations: &quot;All That Razz&quot;; &quot;Eat, Drink, &amp; Be Cherry&quot;; &quot;A Day at the Peach&quot;; &quot;Orange-U-Glad&quot;; &quot;Mint Condition&quot;; &quot;AlmonDeeLicious&quot;; &quot;Nut What You Think&quot;; and &quot;Cookie Monster&quot;. Mars also released a &quot;Crispy Mint&quot; variety in Australia that year.
Also in 2006, M&amp;M&#x27;s became the official chocolate of NASCAR.

In 2007, M&amp;M&#x27;s introduced a limited-edition raspberry flavor called &quot;M&amp;M&#x27;s Razzberry Chocolate Candies&quot;.

Also in 2007, M&amp;M&#x27;s produced a 50-foot, smiling Lady Liberty M&amp;M statue to kick off a campaign encouraging Americans to create their own M&amp;M characters at mms.com. The website allows for people to log in and create their own character from scratch. They can choose features such as the color, shape, hair, and accessories.

In 2008, two limited-edition varieties of the candy were introduced – &quot;Wildly Cherry&quot; M&amp;M&#x27;s, and, as a marketing tie-in with the film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, &quot;Mint Crisp&quot; M&amp;M&#x27;s.

M&amp;M&#x27;s also introduced another new product called &quot;M&amp;M&#x27;s Premiums&quot; in 2008. They come in five flavors – chocolate almond, mint chocolate, mocha, raspberry almond, and triple chocolate (milk, dark, and white chocolate), which are sold in small upright cartons with a plastic bag inside. M&amp;M&#x27;s Premiums do not have a candy shell, but are coated with carnauba wax and color. Dark chocolate was added in 2009, replacing mocha.

During the summer of 2008, My M&amp;M&#x27;s launched &quot;Faces,&quot; which allows consumers to print the faces of loved ones on M&amp;M&#x27;s chocolate candies at mymms.com.

In February 2009, M&amp;M&#x27;s launched the &quot;M&amp;M&#x27;s Colour Break-Up&quot; promotion in Australia, where M&amp;M&#x27;s were sold in separate packs (one for each color): the packs included a code to win prizes.

In summer 2009, M&amp;M&#x27;s launched a limited-edition &quot;Strawberried Peanut Butter&quot; variant to tie in with the release of &quot;&quot;. In addition, M&amp;M&#x27;s launched a limited edition &quot;Coconut M&amp;M&#x27;s&quot;, which became a permanent item in 2010.

In early 2010, M&amp;M&#x27;s Bare All were released as part of a competition in Australia and New Zealand. M&amp;M&#x27;s Bare All winning packs were ordinary M&amp;M&#x27;s, but without colored shells. An official website was launched, along with television advertisements. In April 2010, M&amp;M&#x27;s launched a new Pretzel variety. In November 2011, Mars released a limited edition M&amp;M&#x27;s Cinnamon Milk Chocolate for Christmas.

About the time Pretzel M&amp;M&#x27;s came out, the M&amp;M&#x27;s wrapper designs in the US were redone from the design used from 2004 to early 2010.

In 2012, M&amp;M&#x27;s released two new Dark Chocolate flavors: Raspberry and Mint. Also that year, M&amp;M&#x27;s released a White Chocolate flavor for the Easter season. From May 30, 2012, onwards, M&amp;M&#x27;s will be launched in Macau. In 2012, Peanut M&amp;M&#x27;s were produced in the UK in a limited edition &quot;Red, White and Blues only&quot; pack, in connection with the country&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee and 2012 Summer Olympics. The &quot;M&quot; remains white on the white candies. The commercial advertising this promotional package had Yellow donning various outfits of British stereotypes to try to get into the limited edition pack. Similarly, to promote the 2014 FIFA World Cup in the UK, Peanut M&amp;M&#x27;s were produced in a pack that contained only green, yellow, and blue candies, to reflect the colors of the flag of Brazil; these were dubbed as limited-edition &quot;Brazilian M&amp;M&#x27;s&quot; in the accompanying commercial. &quot;Brazilian M&amp;M&#x27;s&quot; were re-released in 2016 to promote the 2016 Summer Olympics, but were available in both Chocolate and Peanut.

In 2013, M&amp;M&#x27;s launched the &quot;Better with M&quot; campaign, which included cause-related marketing. The campaign worked with Habitat for Humanity and encouraged fans to use a Facebook app to volunteer at the various sites where the homes were being built. The advertising campaign was one of the largest that Mars had ever executed. The 2013 &quot;America Better With M&quot; initiative sought to provide money directly to Habitat for Humanity through offering limited versions of M&amp;M&#x27;s in red, white and blue.

Since 1988, specially designed packages of red, white and blue Presidential M&amp;M&#x27;s have been given as souvenirs to guests of the President of the United States. One side of the box features the presidential seal and the signature of the current president; the other side includes an M&amp;M&#x27;s character flying the American flag. A common misconception is that every candy is stamped with the presidential seal; however, some U.S. embassies around the world do offer M&amp;M&#x27;s stamped with the seal of the United States.

M&amp;M&#x27;s World specialty shops have been established in some locations, including Las Vegas, Orlando, New York, London, and Shanghai.

Several M&amp;Ms-themed video games have been created. The first was &quot;M&amp;M&#x27;s The Lost Formulas&quot;, released on September 28, 2000.

==M&amp;M&#x27;s characters==

Early black-and-white adverts for the candy in 1954 featured two talking, anthropomorphic M&amp;M characters—one plain and one peanut—diving into a swimming pool full of chocolate.

The first incarnation of the characters in CGI was a 1994 celebrity campaign which had the characters interacting with celebrities on which M&amp;Ms candy color is their favorite. This campaign was created by Blue Sky Studios. Concurrent with 1995&#x27;s blue M&amp;M campaign, M&amp;M&#x27;s introduced second computer-animated &quot;spokescandies&quot; in their television commercials. The depiction and campaign of the M&amp;M&#x27;s were made by Will Vinton in 1995. Vinton previously created the clay-animated California Raisins in 1986. Around the time he worked on CGI projects, he made the depiction of the M&amp;M&#x27;s as more mature than most food mascots. These include the team of the cynical and sardonic Red (originally voiced by Jon Lovitz, thereafter Billy West) who is the mascot for milk chocolate, peanut butter, and crispy M&amp;M&#x27;s, and the happy and gullible Yellow (originally voiced by John Goodman, thereafter J.K. Simmons), who is the mascot for Peanut M&amp;M&#x27;s (he was originally known as &quot;Peanut&quot; when first introduced). Other mascots include the &quot;cool one&quot;, Blue (voiced by Robb Pruitt) who is the mascot for Almond M&amp;M&#x27;s; the seductive Green (her personality is a reference to the 1970s urban legend that green M&amp;Ms were aphrodisiacs) (voiced by Cree Summer and Larissa Murray), who is the mascot for both Dark Chocolate Mint and Peanut Butter M&amp;M&#x27;s, and the slightly neurotic Orange (voiced by Eric Kirchberger), who was introduced when Crispy M&amp;M&#x27;s were first released and is currently the mascot Pretzel M&amp;M&#x27;s, which debuted in 2010. As the mascot of Pretzel M&amp;M&#x27;s, Orange was joined by the second non-M&amp;M mascot, Pretzel Guy, who &quot;supports&quot; him and offers helpful advice as he hates the idea of having a pretzel put inside his body.

Other mascots that were introduced, but no longer used, are Almond, the original green guy; Orange, a female peanut character; Chocolate Bar (voiced by Phil Hartman), the first non-M&amp;M character that always gets foiled or outdone by Red and Yellow by being melted, as M&amp;M&#x27;s do not melt; and the Swarmees for M&amp;M&#x27;s Minis candies, which are portrayed as destructive yet crafty troublemakers whom Red and Yellow are always trying unsuccessfully to contain after they accidentally released them in the product&#x27;s initial commercial.

Female M&amp;M&#x27;s mascots were introduced in 1995. Green was the Milk Chocolate mascot and Tan was the Peanut. Marketing discontinued Tan when they introduced the then-new Blue mascot. Green was the only female M&amp;M&#x27;s mascot from her introduction in 1995 until 2012 when M&amp;M&#x27;s unveiled a new additional spokescandy, Ms. Brown (voiced by actress Vanessa Williams), the &quot;Chief Chocolate Officer&quot;. During a Super Bowl LII advertisement, Red was transformed into a human after finding a lucky penny and wishing that he was inedible. As a human, he is portrayed by Danny DeVito. 

In January 2022, Mars announced plans to alter the design of the M&amp;Ms characters. The company announced that the aim of this change was to make their characters more representative of a broader array of human personalities and personal backgrounds. Among these changes is the adoption of more casual clothing for the Green and Brown M&amp;Ms, both of which are generally interpreted to be female characters. In September 2022, they introduced a new Purple M&amp;M voiced by Amber Ruffin who first appeared in a commercial singing &quot;I&#x27;m Just Gonna Be Me&quot;. 

Referencing criticism surrounding the changes from conservative media outlets, the company teased a Super Bowl LVII commercial in January 2023 by making a fictitious announcement that the characters were being temporarily retired and replaced by comedian Maya Rudolph. In subsequent teasers leading up to the game, Rudolph was shown hijacking the M&amp;M&#x27;s brand in her own image, re-launching them as &quot;Ma&amp;Ya&#x27;s&quot; candy-coated clams. Concurrently, the M&amp;M&#x27;s characters were depicted as &quot;exploring their outside passions&quot;, collaborating with other brands such as Cheddar, eBay, Snickers, Spotify, and Zappos. During the eventual ad for Ma&amp;Ya&#x27;s, Red makes a cameo during its final scene alongside Yellow, holding up a sign reading &quot;Help!&quot; Following the game, M&amp;M&#x27;s posted a &quot;press conference&quot; confirming the spokescandies had been reinstated.

==Color changes==

The original colors of M&amp;M&#x27;s candies were red, yellow, violet, green and brown. Violet was discontinued and replaced with tan in the late 1940s.

In 1976, Mars eliminated red-colored M&amp;M&#x27;s because of health concerns over the dye amaranth (FD&amp;C Red #2), which was a suspected carcinogen, and replaced them with orange M&amp;M&#x27;s. This was done despite the fact that M&amp;M&#x27;s did not contain the dye; the action was purely to satisfy worried consumers. Ten years later, Paul Hethmon, then a student at University of Tennessee, started a joke campaign to reinstate red M&amp;M&#x27;s that would eventually become a worldwide phenomenon. Red M&amp;M&#x27;s were reintroduced as a result, and the orange M&amp;M&#x27;s that had originally replaced them were kept in production. In Europe, red M&amp;M&#x27;s contain the red dye carmine (E120, cochineal).

In early 1995, Mars ran a promotion in which consumers were invited to vote on which of blue, pink, or purple would replace the tan M&amp;M&#x27;s. Blue was the winner with 54% of the votes. It replaced tan in late 1995. Consumers could vote by calling 1-800-FUN-COLOR. Ads for the new blue colors featured a plain and an almond blue M&amp;M character as Red and Yellow take notice of trying to do takes in the commercial by painting themselves blue where they appear on stage with B.B. King singing the blues, but the filmmakers had to cut the scene as they were not the real blue M&amp;M&#x27;s; another featured Red and Yellow holding their breath to look like the new blue M&amp;M&#x27;s, where Steven Weber sees the three M&amp;M&#x27;s, Red, Yellow, and Blue; and one more featuring Weber talking to the blue M&amp;M if he had dived into the chocolate pool, but did not.

In 2002, Mars solicited votes in their first ever &quot;M&amp;M&#x27;s Global Color Vote&quot; to add a new color from three choices: aqua (turquoise), pink, and purple. Purple won and was featured for a limited time. To help the colors get votes, Ken Schrader and his MB2 Motorsports team, who was sponsored by M&amp;M&#x27;s at the time, ran four paint schemes during the 2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season representing the promotion (one for aqua, one for pink, one for purple, and another one with all three colors on the car). Specially marked packages of M&amp;M&#x27;s were released in Japan. Finding a bag of all purple M&amp;M&#x27;s entitled the customer to a prize of 100 million yen (equivalent to approximately US$852,000).

Since 2004, M&amp;M&#x27;s have been available online in 17 colors, with personalized phrases on each candy on the opposite side from the &quot;m&quot;. Released around Christmas, these custom-printed M&amp;M&#x27;s were originally intended for holiday greetings, but are now available all year round.

For the 2008 Valentine&#x27;s Day season, Mars introduced all-green bags of M&amp;M&#x27;s. This was due to common urban folklore that says green M&amp;M&#x27;s are an aphrodisiac. They were brought back for 2009 alongside the &quot;Ms. Green Heats Up Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; contest.

In October 2011, Mars released M&amp;M&#x27;s White Chocolate Candy Corn exclusively in the United States for Halloween. These candies come in three candy corn inspired colors: white, bright yellow, and bright orange.

The following is a summary of the changes to the colors of the flagship (milk chocolate) flavor of M&amp;M&#x27;s, the only filling manufactured continuously since the beginning of the brand. From 1941 until 1969, each package contained M&amp;M&#x27;s in five different colors; when red M&amp;M&#x27;s were reintroduced in 1987, they were added as a sixth color instead of replacing any of the existing colors.

<doc id="485489" wikidata="Q84365" url="?curid=485489" title="Maria Schell">
<text>Maria Margarethe Anna Schell (15 January 1926 – 26 April 2005) was an Austrian-Swiss actress. She was one of the leading stars of German cinema in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1954, she was awarded the Cannes Best Actress Award for her performance in Helmut Käutner&#x27;s war drama &quot;The Last Bridge&quot;, and in 1956, she won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival for &quot;Gervaise&quot;.

==Early life==
Schell was born in the Austrian capital Vienna, the daughter of actress Margarethe (née Noé von Nordberg; 1905–1995), who ran an acting school, and Hermann Ferdinand Schell (1900–1972), a Swiss poet, novelist, playwright, and owner of a pharmacy. Her parents were Roman Catholics. She was the older sister of actor Maximilian Schell and lesser-known actors Carl Schell (1927–2019) and Immaculata &quot;Immy&quot; Schell (1935–1992).

After the &quot;Anschluss&quot; in 1938, her family moved to Zürich in Switzerland. Maria Schell began commercial training, but soon entered the film business when she met the Swiss actor and director Sigfrit Steiner.

==Career==
Schell premiered in Steiner&#x27;s 1942 film &quot;Steibruch&quot;, side by side with the well-known Swiss actor Heinrich Gretler, and took acting lessons for several theatre engagements. After World War II, she was cast in her first leading role in the 1948 film &quot;The Angel with the Trumpet&quot;, directed by Karl Hartl. She starred in such films as &quot;The Magic Box&quot;, &quot;Dr. Holl&quot; (1951), &quot;So Little Time&quot; (1952), &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; (1953). Her emotional acting earned her the nickname &quot;Seelchen&quot; (&quot;little soul&quot;), coined by her colleague Oskar Werner.
The 1956 film &quot;Gervaise&quot; directed by René Clément was also a nominee for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film; while in Hollywood, Schell met with Yul Brynner, who urged for her casting in &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; (1958) in the role of Grushenka. Schell also starred with Gary Cooper in &quot;The Hanging Tree&quot; (1959), and with Glenn Ford in &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1960). Other famous movie parts included &quot;Le notti bianche&quot; (1957), &quot;Rose Bernd&quot; (1957), and &quot;Superman&quot; (1978). Schell played Mother Maria in the sequel to &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot; titled &quot;Christmas Lilies of the Field&quot;. In 1959 she appeared on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; as the mystery guest. In 1970, Schell starred opposite Christopher Lee in &quot;The Bloody Judge&quot; by Jesús Franco.
In 1976, she starred in a &quot;Kojak&quot; episode, and also had three guest appearances in the German television series &quot;Der Kommissar&quot; and two in &quot;Derrick&quot;, in the episodes &quot;Yellow He&quot; (1977) and &quot;Klavierkonzert&quot; (1978). Schell appeared on stage, including an acclaimed performance in the 1976 Broadway play &quot;Poor Murderer&quot; by Pavel Kohout and the leading role in Friedrich Dürrenmatt&#x27;s play &quot;The Visit&quot; with the Schauspielhaus Zürich ensemble.

==Personal life==
Schell was married twice – first to film director Horst Hächler (divorced in 1965), and second to director Veit Relin (divorced in 1986). Her daughter by her second marriage, actress Marie Theres Relin (born 1966), was married to Bavarian playwright Franz Xaver Kroetz, and has three children; she made a media and internet appearance as a spokeswoman for housewives (&quot;If Pigs Could Fly. Die Hausfrauenrevolution&quot;, 2004).

=== Affair with Glenn Ford ===
Schell admitted to carrying on a passionate love affair with Glenn Ford in 1960 on location of their film &quot;Cimarron&quot;. Ford&#x27;s son Peter confirmed her story in his 2011 biography &quot;Glenn Ford: A Life&quot;. In 1981, Schell gave Ford a dachshund puppy which he named Bismarck. The dog became his favorite and a constant source of comfort for him in his later years when he became ill and bedridden. After the dog&#x27;s death, he had it cremated and requested that its ashes be buried with him upon his death, which they were when Ford died in 2006.

==Death==
Maria Schell&#x27;s last years were overshadowed by her ill health. She attempted suicide in 1991, and suffered repeated strokes. Her final public appearance was at the premiere of her brother Maximilian&#x27;s documentary film &quot;My Sister Maria&quot; (2002); both were awarded the Bambi Award for their work.

Schell lived reclusively in the remote village of Preitenegg, Carinthia, in the Austrian Alps until her death from pneumonia on 26 April 2005, aged 79. Upon her death, her brother released a statement, stating in part: &quot;Towards the end of her life, she suffered silently, and I never heard her complain. I admire her for that. Her death might have been for her a salvation. But not for me. She is irreplaceable.&quot;

<text>Robert James Manion (19 November 1881 – 2 July 1943) was a Canadian politician who led the Conservative Party of Canada from 1938 to 1940. Prior to his leadership of the party, he served in Prime Minister Arthur Meighen and R. B. Bennett&#x27;s cabinets.

A Liberal prior to World War I, Manion was elected to the House of Commons in 1917 as a member of the pro-conscription Unionist Party led by Prime Minister Robert Borden. After the war, he served as a Conservative Member of Parliament until his defeat in 1935. In 1938, Manion was elected leader of the Conservatives, which was shortly relabeled as National Government. Despite his pro-conscription stance in World War I, Manion campaigned against conscription in World War II in the 1940 federal election. Manion also ran on a platform of forming a wartime coalition national unity government. In the election, the National Government lost in a landslide, keeping their seat count exactly the same as in the 1935 federal election. Manion also lost his seat of London, and subsequently resigned as leader. Shortly after, Manion was appointed director of Civilian Air Raid Defence. He died in 1943 in Ottawa.

==Early life==

Manion was born in Pembroke, Ontario, of Irish Catholic descent, the son of Mary Ann (O&#x27;Brien) and Patrick James Manion. He studied medicine at Queen&#x27;s University, Kingston, Ontario, and at the University of Edinburgh before settling in his hometown of Fort William, Ontario, where his parents had lived since 1888. 

In 1915, he enrolled in the Canadian Army Medical Corps. Attached to the 21st Canadian Battalion, he was awarded the Military Cross for heroism at the battle of Vimy Ridge.

==Political career==

Manion was elected to the House of Commons during the conscription election of 1917 as a Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) for Fort William, Ontario. A member of the Liberal Party before the war, he supported Conservative Prime Minister Robert Borden&#x27;s pro-conscription Union government that was formed as a result of the Conscription Crisis of 1917. Manion remained with the Conservative Party after the war. The new prime minister, Arthur Meighen, appointed him Minister of Soldiers&#x27; Civil Re-establishment in 1921. He spent most of the 1920s on the opposition benches, except for a few months in 1926 when he served as a minister in the second Meighen administration, including the position of Postmaster-General.

Following the federal election of 1930, the new Conservative Prime minister R. B. Bennett appointed Manion Minister of Railways and Canals. However, the economic crisis of the Great Depression destroyed the Bennett government, and Manion, with many others, lost his seat in the 1935 election. According to historian Roy Piovesana, Manion&#x27;s loss was partly attributable to his failure to cultivate his Fort William riding. 

===Conservative Party leader===
Despite not having a seat, Manion won the Conservative leadership convention with backing of an &quot;improbable coalition&quot; of Orange Order delegates from Ontario and delegates from Quebec. Conservative Party members hoped that his Catholicism and marriage to a French-Canadian, Yvonne Desaulniers, would help the party in Quebec where the perception of the Tories as being anti-French and anti-Catholic Orangemen had hurt their prospects. Manion entered the House of Commons through a by-election in 1938 in London. 

Following his by-election win, Manion subsequently campaigned against conscription despite the fact that he had joined the Unionists in 1917 because he favoured the draft. Manion moved the Conservatives to the left and was criticized as a socialist due to his call for action against unemployment and his desire to, in his words, &quot;bring a greater measure of social justice to all our citizens.&quot;

He hoped to come to power due to the criticism the King government was facing after the brokerage of an agreement with the Union Nationale Premier of Quebec, Maurice Duplessis in which he promised federal funds for unemployment relief in Quebec in exchange for the Union Nationale&#x27;s support for the Conservatives in the federal election. The onset of World War II and the re-emergence of conscription as an issue in Canada stymied Manion&#x27;s hopes. In the 1939 Quebec election the federal Liberals warned that the Duplessis government&#x27;s support for Manion would lead to conscription, despite Manion&#x27;s claims that he opposed mandatory military enlistment. The defeat of the government of Maurice Duplessis in Quebec dashed Manion&#x27;s hopes of building an electoral alliance with the conservative premier. As well, his stand against conscription turned much of the Tory base in Ontario against the leader.

====1940 federal election====

King had promised Manion that he would not call an election due to the war but reversed his pledge and called a March 1940 general election taking Manion&#x27;s Tories by surprise and unprepared. They campaigned under the name &quot;National Government&quot; with the platform of forming a wartime coalition government. King and his Liberal Party were quite popular, especially after his government helped Canada recover from the depression. Therefore, the Liberals won a second consecutive landslide majority government, the renamed Tories were unable to make any gains from their 1935 result, and Manion failed to win his seat, leading to his resignation as party leader two months later.

==Later life==
After his election loss, Manion was appointed director of Civilian Air Raid Defence. He died in 1943 in Ottawa.

<doc id="485504" wikidata="Q104840558" url="?curid=485504" title="15th (Scottish) Infantry Division">
<text>The 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division was an infantry division of the British Army that served during the Second World War. It was raised on 2 September 1939, the day before war was declared, as part of the Territorial Army (TA) and served in the United Kingdom and later North-West Europe from June 1944 to May 1945.

==Background==
During the 1930s, tensions increased between Germany and the United Kingdom and its allies. In late 1937 and throughout 1938, German demands for the annexation of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia led to an international crisis. To avoid war, the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain met with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler in September and brokered the Munich Agreement. The agreement averted a war and allowed Germany to annexe the Sudetenland. Although Chamberlain had intended the agreement to lead to further peaceful resolution of issues, relations between both countries soon deteriorated. On 15 March 1939, Germany breached the terms of the agreement by invading and occupying the remnants of the Czech state.

On 29 March, British Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha announced plans to increase the part-time Territorial Army (TA) from 130,000 to 340,000 men and double the number of TA divisions. The plan was for existing TA divisions, referred to as the first-line, to recruit over their establishments (aided by an increase in pay for Territorials, the removal of restrictions on promotion which had hindered recruiting, construction of better-quality barracks and an increase in supper rations) and then form a new division, known as the second-line, from cadres around which the divisions could be expanded. This process was dubbed &quot;duplicating&quot;. The 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division was to be a second-line unit, a duplicate of the first-line 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division. In April, limited conscription was introduced. This resulted in 34,500 twenty-year-old militiamen being conscripted into the regular army, initially to be trained for six months before deployment to the forming second-line units. It was envisioned that the duplicating process and recruiting the required numbers of men would take no more than six months. Some TA divisions had made little progress by the time the Second World War began in September; others were able to complete this work within a matter of weeks.

==Home Service==
===Formation===
The embryo of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division was formed on 26 August 1939, administered by the 52nd Division, and became an independent formation on 2 September 1939. It took control of the 44th, the 45th and the 46th Infantry Brigades. Due to the lack of official guidance, the newly formed formations were at liberty to choose numbers, styles, and titles. The division adopted the number, title, and divisional insignia of their First World War counterpart, the 15th (Scottish) Division. The brigades did likewise. The divisional insignia, the letter &#x27;O&#x27; (being the 15th letter of the alphabet), differed slightly from the original, by not including a triangle inside the circle.

On formation, the 44th (Lowland) Infantry Brigade consisted of the 8th Battalion, Royal Scots; the 6th Battalion, King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers; and the 7th Battalion, King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers. The 45th (Lowland) Infantry Brigade comprised the 6th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers; and the 9th and the 10th Battalions, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles). The 46th (Highland) Infantry Brigade had the 10th and the 11th Battalions, Highland Light Infantry; and the 2nd Battalion, Glasgow Highlanders. The division was initially assigned to Scottish Command, and Major-General Roland Le Fanu became the general officer commanding. Le Fanu&#x27;s prior experience included staff appointments, and he had fought in the 1937 Waziristan campaign. While primarily made up of Scots, recruits were posted to the division from across the United Kingdom, particularly England.

===Home defence===
The war deployment plan for the TA envisioned that its divisions would be deployed overseas, as equipment became available, to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) that had already been dispatched to Europe. The TA would join regular army divisions in waves as its divisions completed their training, the final divisions deploying one year after the war began. However, during the opening months of the war, the division lacked the required equipment and personnel. September saw the division drained of manpower. Soldiers, aged 19, were reassigned to other formations; the Ministry of Labour allocated other men to essential industries; and medical standards weeded out those considered unfit. The division was initially scattered across southern Scotland without access to training facilities. On 30 September, after the requisition of civilian transport, the division moved to the Scottish Borders, south of Edinburgh, to start training.

In October 1939, the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, General Walter Kirke, was tasked with drawing up a plan, codenamed Julius Caesar, to defend the United Kingdom from a potential German invasion. The division&#x27;s role in this was largely to defend the Edinburgh and Forth areas. It was not until December that the division moved to undertake this role, with the 44th Brigade positioned astride the Firth of Forth. The rest of the division was based around Glasgow, on either side of the Firth of Clyde. On paper, an infantry division was to have seventy-two modern 25-pounder field guns. By November, the divisional artillery comprised just eight First World War-vintage howitzers. By January, this had increased to sixteen howitzers, in addition to eight First World War-era 18-pounder field guns.

In April 1940, the division marched back to the Borders, and used the move as a training exercise. Elements of the division were then used to provide logistical support for units en route to fight in the Norwegian Campaign. On 9 April, following the start of the campaign, the second-line infantry divisions were requested to each form an independent infantry company of 289 volunteers, who would be deployed to Norway. The 15th Division formed No. 10 Independent Company, but it was not deployed. When the campaign ended in failure, the division was ordered to move south into England to make room for the returning troops. This move promoted Kirke to complain that the division was being moved against his wishes, despite the defensive role assigned to it for southern Scotland. The move took the division to Wiltshire, with the intent to intensively prepare for its deployment to France. Following the German invasion of France and the Low Countries, the English east coast was seen as the area most under threat from German invasion. The division then moved to Essex to defend the coast from Harwich, in the north, to Southend-on-Sea, in the south. To prevent a German invasion, including potential tank attacks, the divisional artillery now comprised twelve howitzers, six 18-pounder field guns, and four Ordnance QF 2-pounder anti-tank guns (compared to an establishment of 48). This was roughly on par with the other eight divisions that had been assigned to defend the coast, although the 15th was one of only two that included anti-tank guns. Additional equipment included 47 Boys anti-tank rifles (against an establishment of 361), 63 Universal Carriers (establishment of 140), and 590 Bren light machine guns (establishment of 644). The division co-operated with the forming Local Defence Volunteers, laid landmines, and erected anti-invasion obstacles within its operating area.

On 9 July, George VI inspected elements of the division at Colchester. The next month, on 2 August, Lieutenant-General Alan Brooke, now Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, visited the division. Brooke recorded in his diary &quot;Do not think much of [Le Fanu], and doubtful whether he is good enough.&quot; Regarding the division&#x27;s rank and file, he wrote they were &quot;good but [require] a great deal more training.&quot; On 23 August, Le Fanu was replaced by Major-General Robert Cotton Money. On 31 October, George VI visited the divisional headquarters, and provided authorization for the lion rampant, from Royal Arms of Scotland, to be added within the &#x27;O&#x27; of the divisional insignia. The division remained on the coast, and trained through to the end of the year.

On 30 January 1941, Major-General Oliver Leese took command of the division. Later in the month, the division moved northeast to Suffolk, in East Anglia. The division maintained a coastal defence role, with the 44th Brigade based at Lowestoft, the 45th Brigade situated between Dunwich and Aldeburgh, and the 46th Brigade between Orford and Felixstowe. This left a gap between the 44th and the 45th Brigades, which was filled by the 37th Independent Infantry Brigade. This brigade reported directly to XI Corps, and was not part of the division. On 17 June 1941, Major-General Philip Christison replaced Leese. By September, the division&#x27;s artillery regiments had all been outfitted with a full complement of 25-pounder field guns.

===Divisional changes===

Due to the large number of men allocated to the infantry, in 1941, the British Army instituted reforms to build-up other arms and formations. As a result, several divisions were to be disbanded or reduced. This included the 15th (Scottish), which was placed on the lower establishment in November 1941. This meant that the division was detailed for home defence, compared to a higher establishment division that were intended to be deployed overseas for combat. The division was stripped of artillery and engineer units, and used as a source of reinforcements for oversea units. After being downgraded, the division moved north to Northumberland. It took up position at Newcastle and along the coast north of the city, as well as continued training. On 14 May 1942, Major-General Charles Bullen-Smith took command.

On 5 January 1943, the 45th Brigade was removed from the division and replaced by the 6th Guards Tank Brigade. This brought the division inline with the &#x27;mixed division&#x27; concept. Lieutenant-General Giffard Le Quesne Martel, head of the Royal Armoured Corps, described this as &quot;the absorption of the armoured forces into the rest of the army&quot;, which required a division to decrease from three to two infantry brigades, and have a tank brigade, equipped with infantry tanks, assigned in place of the lost infantry. On 28 March 1943, the division was raised to the higher establishment, officially as a &#x27;mixed division&#x27;. It was intended to bring the division up to strength, an establishment of 16,119 men and 205 tanks, by June. Accordingly, additional units were transferred to the division. Training now had an emphasis on combined arms warfare. The division was assigned to the VIII Corps, on 20 June 1943. The following month, on 14 July, the division was brought back up to a strength of three infantry brigades, while still retaining the tank brigade, when the 227th (Highland) Infantry Brigade joined. On 27 August 1943, Major-General Gordon MacMillan arrived from commanding a brigade in combat in North Africa, to take command of the division.

On 5 September, the &#x27;mixed division&#x27; concept was abandoned as it was considered to have not been successful, and the 6th Guards Tank Brigade left on 9 September. The division then moved to Yorkshire, and was based around Bradford, Harrogate, and Leeds. The remainder of the 1943 and the opening of 1944 was used to conduct extensive training and divisional exercises, as the division had been assigned to partake in Operation Overlord, the invasion of German-occupied France. In February 1944, General Bernard Montgomery, commander of the 21st Army Group, the main Allied formation in Operation Overlord, visited the division and addressed the men. In the following weeks, the division was visited by George VI, Queen Elizabeth, their daughter Elizabeth, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and the VIII Corps commander Lieutenant-General Richard O&#x27;Connor. In April, the division moved to Sussex, and was concentrated in camps in the Brighton area. The division&#x27;s advanced parties departed for London on 8 June, and moved to France on 13 June. On 11 June, the division proper started to move to marshalling areas in London and Southampton, and were transported to France piecemeal with the last unit not arriving until 24 June.

==Overseas service==
===Operation Epsom===
The Norman city of Caen was the primary British objective during the Normandy landings, and was seen as key for future operations. However, the city did not fall on 6 June, and was not taken in follow-up fighting. The recently assembled VIII Corps was assigned to a renewed effort to capture the city. Operation Epsom intended for the corps to attack to the west of Caen, cross the Odon and Orne rivers, capture an area of high ground near Bretteville-sur-Laize and thereby encircle the city. The operation was the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division&#x27;s baptism of fire, and it was assigned a key role in the opening phases: to clear several villages that stood between them and the Odon, and to capture bridges to allow the 11th Armoured Division to cross the river and race for Bretteville-sur-Laize. Afterwards, the 15th Division would clear the Odon river valley.

Phase I of the attack was conducted by the 44th and the 46th Brigades, supported by Churchill tanks from the 31st Tank Brigade and specialist tanks from the 79th Armoured Division. Both brigades attacked at 07:30 behind a rolling barrage. German mortar fire responded immediately. Despite delays caused by minefields and German holdouts in the forward area, the brigades captured most of their objectives before noon: La Gaule, Le Haut, and Cheux. An effort by the 46th Brigade to advance to the southeast of Cheux, to capture a hill, was partially successful. They seized the northern slope, but the Germans retained the southern. Elements of the 44th Brigade were engaged in an all day struggle to capture and hold St Mauvieu, which they did after fending off several counterattacks. Both brigades suffered mounting losses. The historian Carlo D&#x27;Este highlighted the 46th Brigade&#x27;s 2nd Battalion, Glasgow Highlanders, who suffered around 200 casualties including 12 officers. This represented 24 per cent of the battalion&#x27;s officers and &quot;nearly 25% of the entire rifle battalion.&quot;

Phase II of the attack started late, around 18:00, as the 227th Brigade was delayed by traffic congestion at Cheux. As it moved south, the brigade was engaged by German tanks and made little progress. However, one company broke through the German lines and reached Colleville. On the morning of 27 June, the 46th Brigade secured the northern slope of the hill that had been previously denied to them. Afterwards, both the 44th and the 46th Brigades were relieved by the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division. Part of the 227th Brigade made little progress pushing south beyond Cheux, due to mortar fire and German tanks, although they repulsed one attack and destroyed four tanks. The rest of the brigade cleared Colleville, captured Tourville-sur-Odon, destroyed additional German tanks, and by the afternoon had seized the bridge across the Odon at Tourmauville. This allowed the 11th Armoured Division to cross and proceed with the operation.

Fighting continued the next day, with most of the division involved. Additional bridges and villages were secured along the Odon valley. This included Gavrus, which was taken by the 2nd Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and who were then left isolated. The Germans also began a counterattack on the north side of the Odon into the division&#x27;s western flank. The back and forth fighting, which spread to both sides of the Odon, continued through 29 June and resulted in the division fending off the attacks and was able to secure additional territory. The historian Lloyd Clark placed the division&#x27;s defensive success on &quot;careful positioning&quot;, taking advantage of terrain, as well as &quot;excellent leadership and tactical prowess at the small unit level.&quot; Due to heavy casualties suffered by the 2nd Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, they withdrew and the division ceded control of Gavrus on 30 June. During the course of the day, additional counterattacks on the division were repulsed. The 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division then relieved the 15th, although the 44th Brigade remained engaged through July 1. They repulsed further German counterattacks, and were relieved by the Welsh division on 2 July.

Hugh Martin, the author of the divisional history, described Epsom as the &quot;fiercest fighting that the Division was to know in the whole war&quot;, which captured of territory, and resulted in &quot;one-quarter&quot; of all casualties suffered by the division through the entire campaign. The division suffered 288 men killed, 1,638 wounded, and 794 men missing. D&#x27;Este commented that the number of riflemen in a division was around 4,600, and the losses suffered by the division represented &quot;in excess of 50%&quot; of the division&#x27;s infantry.

===Normandy, July===

The next divisional action was limited to artillery support, with the artillery supporting a Canadian effort to capture the Carpiquet airfield during Operation Windsor on 4 July. By 7 July, the division had been reinforced to make up most of its Epsom losses. The 44th and the 46th Brigades were then assigned to support the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division during Operation Jupiter. The 44th Brigade occupied positions along the Odon river, previously held by the 227th Brigade during Operation Epsom. This freed up the 43rd Division, for their attack on the dominant high ground south of the river. The 44th Brigade supported this effort by engaging in mutual mortar bombardments with the Germans on the heights. The 46th Brigade, supported by elements of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment, cleared the area between the Odon and Orne near Eterville. They also supported the 43rd Division by taking control of several hamlets that the latter had captured, and fended off several counterattacks. By 10 July, both brigades had been relieved.

On 12 July, the division was assigned to XII Corps, and three days later attacked towards Bougy, Evrecy, and Maizet, as part of Operation Greenline; a diversionary attack in support of Operation Goodwood. German resistance and counterattacks, heavy fighting, flanking fire, and a direct hit on one of the brigade&#x27;s tactical headquarters caused delays and communication breakdowns. In the end, the division captured Bougy, fell short of taking Evrecy, and failed to advance on Maizet. However, the fighting had attracted German armour reserves away from the Goodwood battle area, and thus achieved the operation&#x27;s objective.

===Breakout from Normandy===

On 23 July, the division relocated to Caumont and relieved the 5th US Infantry Division. This was part of a strategic realignment of the Normandy beachhead, as the British Second Army shifted three divisions west to allow the American First Army to launch a breakout offensive. In support, the British Army launched Operation Bluecoat that aimed to secure the American flank and reach the town of Vire. The division was faced by the recently arrived 326th Infantry Division, who took over well-prepared defenses that were behind a minefield. For Bluecoat, the division reverted to the command of VIII Corps and was supported by mine-clearing tanks, Churchill tanks, and Churchill Crocodiles. On 30 July, the division attacked through the Normandy bocage, with the goal of reaching Hill 309 by the end of the day. The infantry were soon subjected to heavy artillery fire, while terrain and mines resulted in the infantry and tanks separating. The division&#x27;s first objective was Sept-Vents and a nearby wood. It was intended to be captured by 09:55, but it took six-hours to achieve this due to mines, traffic jams, heavy fighting, and the methodical clearing of the village. In the meantime, the supporting tanks pressed forward alone and captured Hill 309 in the mid-afternoon, around the same time Sept-Vents was cleared. They then held the hill until relieved by the advancing Scottish infantry, around 22:00.

The following day, the division consolidated their captured positions, while two armoured divisions continued the corps&#x27; attack. On 1 August, the division fended off numerous counterattacks that were launched upon its positions, primarily by the 21st Panzer Division, over a 12-hour period. Over the following days, while most of the division retained their defensive position, elements were used to clear territory captured or bypassed by the advancing armour. During this period, MacMillan was wounded by shell fire and was replaced by the 46th Brigade commander, Colin Muir Barber, who was made a major-general. On 6 August, the leading elements of the division reached Estry and the nearby Hill 208, and fought a back and forth battle for both locations over the following days. On 13 August, the division was transferred to near Caen, and ended its participation in the Normandy fighting.

The Allied advance culminated in the defeat of the German military in Normandy at the Falaise Pocket. Afterwards, the Second Army advanced towards the Seine, in pursuit of the retreating German forces, with XII Corps spearheaded by the 15th Division. Late on 26 August, the division crossed the river largely unopposed. Additional crossings, meeting light resistance, were made under the cover of darkness the next morning. The bridgehead was then consolidated.

===Belgium and the Netherlands===
On 2 September, one battalion moved east from the Seine and was followed by the rest of the division the next day. Four days later, the bulk of the division arrived at Courtrai, Belgium, and immediately shelled retreating German forces. Over the following days, the division cleared the area between the Scheldt and the Lys rivers, and took several hundred prisoners. The Glasgow Highlanders (46th Brigade) were dispatched to reinforce the effort to take Ghent. They fought an opposed crossing of the Ghent–Terneuzen Canal on 9 September, and spent the following two days engaged in close fighting in and around the northern section of the city as they cleared it building by building, and took several hundred more prisoners.

The division then moved into the bridgehead that had been established over the Albert Canal, at Gheel. From this foothold, on 14 September, the division launched several assaults to cross the Meuse-Escaut Canal (referred to as the &#x27;Junction Canal&#x27; in the divisional history). They were only able to secure one bridgehead, at Aart, and battled to hold it over the next six days. The bridgehead, around in depth, was heavily contested by the Germans and caused the division 700 casualties. This action was credited with diverting German resources away from Joe&#x27;s Bridge, where XXX Corps began their assault from at the start of Operation Market Garden. On 20 September, the 7th Armoured Division relieved the 15th Division, which (minus the 227th Brigade) moved east to Lommel, and took up position in a bridgehead that had been secured by the 53rd Division.

Operation Market Garden intended to land the First Allied Airborne Army behind German lines to seize six bridges and other key areas, to facilitate an advance by XXX Corps through the Netherlands and across the Rhine and into Germany. XII Corp was assigned to protect the left flank of XXX Corps&#x27; advance. Consequently, the 15th Division crossed the Wilhelmina Canal (), unopposed on 21 September, and advanced towards the village of Best, on the northwest outskirts of Eindhoven. &#x27;D&#x27; Company of the 7th Seaforth Highlanders (46th Brigade) entered the village the next day and believed it to be unoccupied. However, their arrival had surprised the German garrison, and after the loss of 33 men, &#x27;D&#x27; Company withdrew. The 46th Brigade and the divisional reconnaissance regiment the launched further attacks, which turned into a five-day battle for control of the village. It saw methodical house to house fighting, and repeated assaults to clear German forces out of the train station and cement factory on the south side of the village. Meanwhile, the 44th Brigade was initially held in reserve, to be used to clear the road that XXX Corps had advanced along, if needed. But on 24 September, it was released from this duty. It and the 227th Brigade (which had now rejoined the division) attacked northwards, and cleared the area up to the river Dommel and captured several hamlets. Martin recounted that a medical officer from the 44th Brigade strayed into German lines while searching for wounded soldiers, during this period. After giving his word not to provide intelligence to the division, he was released to continue his search for the wounded. Operation Haggis followed, which was the relief of the division by the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division and was finalized on 3 October. Afterwards, the division was then given a three-week break at Helmond, east of Eindhoven. This time was used to rest, reinforce, train, and a &#x27;Battle School&#x27; was formed.

The division was then assigned to VIII Corps, which was tasked with defeating three German divisions that were based west of the Meuse along the eastern flank of the corridor captured during Operation Market Garden. Prior to the 15th (Scottish) being committed to this, Montgomery assigned the division back to XII Corps that been tasked with attacking west from the corridor. This operation, codenamed Operation Pheasant, was designed to support the ongoing effort to clear the Scheldt estuary. The division&#x27;s task was to capture the town of Tilburg. On 20 October, the division moved back to Best, and started their advance three days later. German forces had largely abandoned the area in front of the division, so the initial move was unopposed. On 26 October, a brief action was fought to capture the town of Oisterwijk. The next day, the division (now supported by the 4th Armoured Brigade and the Dutch Princess Irene Brigade) advanced into the Tilburg, and seized key points throughout the city. Martin claimed that the division skirmished with Dutch Waffen SS units in Tilburg. The following day, the division conducted a clearing operation, and then declared the city liberated. On 30 October, the division entered Asten, south of Helmond, in response a German counterattack launched to the east of Eindhoven.

The division then fought at Meijel, Blerwick, the Battle of Broekhuizen.

===Germany===
The division then entered Germany, and fought in Operation Veritable, crossed the Rhine, took part in Operation Plunder in late March 1945, part of the Western Allied invasion of Germany.

The particular distinction for the 15th Scottish was to be selected to lead the last set piece river crossing of the war, the assault across the River Elbe (Operation Enterprise) on 29 April 1945 spearheaded by the 1st Commando Brigade, after which they fought on to the Baltic occupying both Lübeck and Kiel. The 15th (Scottish) was the only division of the British Army during the Second World War to be involved in three of the six major European river assault crossings; the Seine, the Rhine and the Elbe.

On 10 April 1946, the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division was finally disbanded. Its battle casualties– killed, wounded and missing – in nearly eleven months of fighting were 11,772 with over 1,500 men killed. According to D&#x27;Este, the &quot;15th (Scottish) Division was considered to be the most effective and best led infantry division in 21st Army Group.&quot;

<text>Liberal–Unionists were supporters of the Liberal Party of Canada who, as a result of the Conscription Crisis of 1917 rejected Sir Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s leadership and supported the coalition Unionist government of Sir Robert Borden.

Much of the Ontario Liberal Party declared themselves to be Liberal–Unionists, including provincial party leader Newton Rowell, who joined Borden&#x27;s Cabinet, and a variety of Liberal MPs.

In the 1917 election, many Liberals ran as Liberal–Unionists or Unionists against the Laurier Liberals.

After the war, most Liberal–Unionists rejoined the Liberal Party despite efforts by Borden and Arthur Meighen to make the coalition permanent by renaming the Conservative party the National Liberal and Conservative Party. Several Liberal–Unionists ended up staying with the Conservatives including Hugh Guthrie and Robert Manion.

<doc id="485507" wikidata="Q783785" url="?curid=485507" title="Chief of Staff of the United States Army">
<text>The chief of staff of the Army (CSA) is a statutory position in the United States Army held by a general officer. As the highest-ranking officer assigned to serve in the Department of the Army, the chief is the principal military advisor and a deputy to the secretary of the Army. In a separate capacity, the CSA is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff () and, thereby, a military advisor to the National Security Council, the secretary of defense, and the president of the United States. The CSA is typically the highest-ranking officer on active duty in the U.S. Army unless the chairman or the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are Army officers.

The chief of staff of the Army is an administrative position based in the Pentagon. While the CSA does not have operational command authority over Army forces proper (which is within the purview of the combatant commanders who report to the secretary of defense), the CSA does exercise supervision of army units and organizations as the designee of the secretary of the Army.

The current chief of staff of the Army is General Randy George, who was sworn in on 21 September 2023, having previously served as acting CSA from 4 August.

==Appointment==
The chief of staff of the Army is nominated for appointment by the president, for a four-year term of office, and must be confirmed by the Senate. The chief can be reappointed to serve one additional term, but only during times of war or national emergency declared by Congress. By statute, the chief is a four-star general.

The chief has an official residence, Quarters 1 at Joint Base Myer–Henderson Hall, Virginia.

==Responsibilities==
The senior leadership of the Department of the Army consists of two civilians—the secretary of the Army (head of the department and subordinate to the secretary of defense) and the under secretary of the Army—and two military officers—the chief of staff of the Army and the vice chief of staff of the Army.

The chief reports directly to the secretary of the Army for army matters and assists in the Secretary&#x27;s external affairs functions, including presenting and enforcing army policies, plans, and projections. The chief also directs the inspector general of the Army to perform inspections and investigations as required. In addition, the chief presides over the Army Staff and represents Army capabilities, requirements, policy, plans, and programs in Joint forums. Under delegation of authority made by the secretary of the Army, the chief designates army personnel and army resources to the commanders of the unified combatant commands. The chief performs all other functions enumerated in under the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of the Army, or delegates those duties and responsibilities to other officers in his administration in his name. Like the other service counterparts, the chief has no operational command authority over army forces, dating back to the passage of the Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1958. The chief is served by a number of deputy chiefs of staff of the Army, such as G-1, Personnel. The chief&#x27;s base pay is $21,147.30 per month and also received a personal money allowance (monthly amount) of $333.33, a basic allowance for subsistence of $253.38, and a basic allowance for housing from $50.70 to $1,923.30.

==History==
In the 19th century the American land military used the title of &quot;General-in-Chief&quot; beginning with Gen. James Wilkinson (1757-1825), and later for several decades of commanding Gen. Winfield Scott (1786-1866). Later Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant (1822-1885), given the title after being recalled to come east from the Western Theater of the Civil War in 1864. By 1903, the senior military officer in the army was the commanding general of the United States Army, who reported to the U.S. secretary of war. From 1864 to 1865, Major General Henry Halleck (1815-1872), who had previously been Commanding General earlier in the war, served as &quot;Chief of Staff of the Army&quot; under the newly appointed Commanding General, Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant, thus serving in a different office and not as the senior officer in the army. Halleck was centered in the old brick War Department building adjacent west of the White House, along with the War Secretary, whereas Gen. Grant was out in the field.

The first chief of staff moved his headquarters to Fort Myer in northern Virginia, near the national capital of Washington, D.C.. in 1908.

<doc id="485508" wikidata="Q4273821" url="?curid=485508" title="Grammy Award for Best Polka Album">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Polka Album was an award presented at the Grammy Awards to recording artists for quality polka albums. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Originally called the Grammy Award for Best Polka Recording, the award was first presented to Frankie Yankovic in 1986. Previously, polka recordings had been placed in the folk category. While neither &quot;Billboard&quot; nor the Recording Industry Association of America tracked polka sales at the time the award category was introduced, polka musicians viewed its inclusion as a sign of respect and increasing popularity. In 1987, a tie vote resulted in awards being presented to Jimmy Sturr and His Orchestra for the album &quot;I Remember Warsaw&quot; as well as to Eddie Blazonczyk&#x27;s Versatones for the album &quot;Another Polka Celebration&quot;. In 1992, the name of the category was changed to Best Polka Album. Beginning in 2001, award recipients included the producers, engineers, and/or mixers associated with the nominated work in addition to the recording artists. The Academy retired the award category in 2009 to remain &quot;relevant and responsive&quot; to the music community.

Sturr holds the record for the most wins in this category, with a total of eighteen (including six as the leader of the group known as Jimmy Sturr and His Orchestra). Sturr also holds the record for the most consecutive Grammy wins. Walter Ostanek received the award three times consecutively, and the band Brave Combo was presented the award twice. American artists were presented with the award more than any other nationality, though it was presented to Ostanek and his band from Canada three times. Lenny Gomulka holds the record for the most nominations without a win, with twelve.

==Category retirement==
In 2009, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences announced the retirement of the award category. President and CEO Neil Portnow stated that the Academy needed to do so in order to remain a &quot;relevant and responsive&quot; organization within a &quot;dynamic music community&quot;. Polka musicians and fans were disappointed with the category elimination. Three-time award winner Walter Ostanek admitted he &quot;[felt] sorry for the future artists&quot; that would fail to be recognized by the Academy. Carl Finch of the group Brave Combo stated the following: &quot;Having a polka category was the most important step to legitimacy that we could ever hope to achieve. To have that taken away, it&#x27;s like it was all for nothing.&quot; Apart from ensuring that the &quot;awards process remains representative of the current musical landscape&quot;, the Academy cited dwindling competition as one reason for the category retirement. Others speculated that Jimmy Sturr&#x27;s eighteen wins led to the elimination. Due to the elimination of a polka-specific category, polka musicians are likely to submit recordings in the folk and world music categories.

In 2011, the Grammy Award organization announced a major overhaul of Grammy categories, lowering the number of awards from over 120 to just 78. Several regional American roots genres, such as Hawaiian music or Native American music, were combined in the new Best Regional Roots Music Album category, for which polka albums would also be eligible.

<doc id="485516" wikidata="Q818595" url="?curid=485516" title="Beornwulf of Mercia">
<text>Beornwulf (died 826) was the King of Mercia, a kingdom of Anglo-Saxon England, from 823 until his death in 826. His short reign saw the collapse of Mercia&#x27;s supremacy over the other kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. His name derives from the Old English terms &quot;beorn&quot; &#x27;man, warrior&#x27; and &quot;wulf&quot; &#x27;wolf&#x27;.

==Biography==
Beornwulf became King of Mercia in 823 following the deposition of King Ceolwulf I. His family, as well as the majority of his background, are unknown. However, Beornwulf may be distantly related to a prior Mercian king, Beornred, as well as two subsequent rulers, Beorhtwulf and Burgred— all members of the so-called B-dynasty or group. Though this is only speculation, alliterative names were prevalent in Anglo-Saxon royal families, and the confirmed kin of these leaders also had names that began with B. 

Prior to becoming king, Beornwulf is mentioned as having witnessed a charter of King Coenwulf in 812 and another of King Ceolwulf I in 823, but his position on each of these charters suggests that he was not of an exceptionally high rank. 

In 825 Beornwulf marched against the West Saxons. Beornwulf&#x27;s army met them at Ellandun (now Wroughton near Swindon in Wiltshire). Although the details are unknown, the battle ended in a disastrous defeat for the Mercians, and is seen by historians as the end of the so-called Mercian Supremacy. That same year, Ecgberht&#x27;s son Æthelwulf invaded Kent and drove out its pro-Mercian king, Baldred.

In the wake of these events, Mercia&#x27;s dominance in southern England rapidly unravelled. Essex and Sussex switched their loyalty to Ecgberht; and the East Anglians asked for Ecgberht&#x27;s protection against the Mercians in the same year. Beornwulf was killed by the East Anglians in battle while attempting to put down a rebellion.

Beornwulf rebuilt the Abbey of St. Peter (later Gloucester Cathedral) and he presided over two synods at Clofesho (an unknown location believed to be near London with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury, in 824 and 825. A Kentish charter shows that Beornwulf still had authority in Kent on 27 March 826 – S1267, issued on that date, is said to be in the third year of Beornwulf&#x27;s reign. Coins minted during Beornwulf&#x27;s reign are very rare, with only around 25 known examples.
