<text>The Vijayanagara Empire, also known as the Karnata Kingdom, was a late medieval Hindu empire that ruled much of southern India. It was established in 1336 by the brothers Harihara I and Bukka Raya I of the Sangama dynasty, belonging to the Yadava clan of Chandravamsa lineage.

The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers to ward off Muslim invasions by the end of the 13th century. At its peak in the early 16th century under Krishnadevaraya, it subjugated almost all of Southern India&#x27;s ruling dynasties and pushed the Deccan sultanates beyond the Tungabhadra-Krishna River doab region, in addition to annexing the Gajapati Empire (Odisha) up to the Krishna River, becoming one of the most prominent states in India. The empire&#x27;s territory covered most of the lands of the modern-day Indian states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Goa, and some parts of Telangana and Maharashtra.

The empire lasted until 1646, although its power declined greatly after a major military defeat in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by the combined armies of the Deccan sultanates. The empire is named after its capital city of Vijayanagara (modern-day Hampi) whose extensive ruins are now a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Karnataka. The wealth and fame of the empire inspired visits by and writings of medieval European travelers such as Domingo Paes, Fernão Nunes, and Nicolò de&#x27; Conti. These travelogues, contemporary literature and epigraphy in the local languages, and modern archeological excavations at Vijayanagara have provided ample information about the history and power of the empire.

The empire&#x27;s legacy includes monuments spread over Southern India, the best known of which is the group at Hampi. Different temple building traditions in South and Central India were merged into the Vijayanagara architectural style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovations in the construction of Hindu temples. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies to the region such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire&#x27;s patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit with topics such as astronomy, mathematics, medicine, fiction, musicology, historiography and theater gaining popularity. The classical music of Southern India, Carnatic music, evolved into its current form. The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in the history of Southern India that transcended regionalism by promoting Hinduism as an unifying factor.

==Name==
&#x27;Vijaynagar&#x27; translates to &#x27;City of Victory&#x27;.
&quot;Karnata Rajya&quot; (Karnata Kingdom) was another name for the Vijayanagara Empire, used in some inscriptions and literary works of the Vijayanagara times including the Sanskrit work &quot;Jambavati Kalyanam&quot; by Emperor Krishnadevaraya and Telugu work &quot;Vasu Charitamu&quot;.
Europeans referred to the Vijayanagara Empire as &quot;The Kingdom of Narasinga&quot;. a name derived from &quot;Narasimha&quot; by the Portuguese. It is not clear whether the name was derived from Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya or Narasimha Raya II.

==History==
===Background and origin theories===

Before the early 14th-century rise of the Vijayanagara Empire, the Hindu states of the Deccan – the Yadava Empire of Devagiri, the Kakatiya dynasty of Warangal, and the Pandyan Empire of Madurai – were repeatedly raided and attacked by Muslims from the north. By 1336 the upper Deccan region (modern-day Maharashtra and Telangana) had been defeated by armies of Sultan Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad bin Tughluq of the Delhi Sultanate.

Further south in the Deccan region, Hoysala commander, Singeya Nayaka-III, declared independence after the Muslim forces of the Delhi Sultanate defeated and captured the territories of the Yadava Empire in 1294. He created the Kampili kingdom near Gulbarga and Tungabhadra River in the northeastern parts of present-day Karnataka state. The kingdom collapsed after a defeat by the armies of Delhi Sultanate and upon their defeat, the populace committed a &quot;jauhar&quot; (ritual mass suicide) in . The Vijayanagara Kingdom was founded in 1336 as a successor to the hitherto prosperous Hindu kingdoms of the Hoysalas, the Kakatiyas, and the Yadavas with the breakaway Kampili Kingdom adding a new dimension to the resistance to the Muslim invasion of South India.

Two theories have been proposed regarding the ethnolinguistic origins of the Vijayanagara Empire. One is that Harihara I and Bukka I, the founders of the empire, were Kannadigas and commanders in the army of the Hoysala Empire stationed in the Tungabhadra region to ward off Muslim invasions from Northern India. Another theory is that Harihara and Bukkaraya were Telugu people, first associated with the Kakatiya Kingdom, who took control of the northern parts of the Hoysala Empire during its decline. They were believed to have been captured by the army of Muhammad bin Tughluq at Warangal. According to tradition, based on a Telugu-narrative, the founders were supported and inspired by Vidyaranya, a saint at the Sringeri monastery, to fight the Muslim invasion of South India, but the role of Vidyaranya in the founding of the Vijayanagara Empire is not certain.

===Early years===
In the first two decades after the founding of the empire, Harihara I gained control over most of the area south of the Tungabhadra River and earned the title of &quot;master of the eastern and western seas&quot; (&quot;Purvapaschima Samudradhishavara&quot;). By 1374 Bukka Raya I, successor to Harihara I, defeated the chiefdom of Arcot, the Reddys of Kondavidu, and the Sultan of Madurai, and had gained control over Goa in the west and the Tungabhadra-Krishna River doab in the north. The original capital of the empire was in the principality of Anegondi on the northern banks of the Tungabhadra River in today&#x27;s Karnataka. It was moved to Vijayanagara during Bukka Raya I&#x27;s reign because it was easier to defend against the Muslim armies, who were persistently attacking from the northern lands.

With the Vijayanagara Empire now imperial in stature, Harihara II, the second son of Bukka Raya I, further consolidated the empire beyond the Krishna River and South India was controlled by the Vijayanagara Empire. The next ruler, Deva Raya I, was successful against the Gajapatis of Odisha and undertook works of fortification and irrigation. Firuz Bahmani of Bahmani Sultanate entered into a treaty with Deva Raya I in 1407 that required the latter to pay Bahmani an annual tribute of &quot;100,000 huns, five maunds of pearls and fifty elephants&quot;. The Sultanate invaded Vijayanagara in 1417 when the latter defaulted in paying the tribute. Such wars for tribute payment by Vijayanagara were repeated in the 15th century.

Deva Raya II (eulogized in contemporary literature as &quot;Gajabetekara&quot;) succeeded to the throne in 1424. He was possibly the most successful of the Sangama Dynasty rulers. He quelled rebelling feudal lords and the Zamorin of Calicut and Quilon in the south. He invaded Sri Lanka and became overlord of the kings of Burma at Pegu and Tanasserim. By 1436 the rebellious chiefs of Kondavidu and the Velama rulers were successfully dealt with and had to accept Vijayanagara overlordship. After a few years of tranquility, wars broke out with the Bahmani Sultanate in 1443 with some successes and some reversals. The Persian visitor Firishta attributes Deva Raya II&#x27;s war preparations, which included augmenting his armies with Muslim archers and cavalry, to be the cause of the conflict. Contemporary Persian ambassador Abdur Razzak attributes the war to the Bahmani Sultan capitalizing on the confusion caused by an internal revolt within the Vijayanagara Empire, including an attempt to assassinate the Raya by his brother.

Deva Raya II was succeeded by his elder son Mallikarjuna Raya in 1446. The Gajapati emperor removed the Vijayanagara control over the Tamil country by occupying the Reddi kingdoms of Rajahmundry, Kondaveedu, Kanchipuram, and Tiruchirapalli. These defeats reduced the Vijayanagara Empire&#x27;s prestige, described by an inscription which described the Gajapati king as &quot;a yawning lion to the sheep of the Karnatak King&quot;. Mallikarjuna&#x27;s successor Virupaksha Raya II led a life of pleasure perusing wine and women leading to the loss of Goa and much of Karnataka to the Bahmani Sultanate. His governor Saluva Narasimha reduced the loss of territory by holding almost all of coastal Andhra Pradesh south of the Krishna river, Chittoor, the two Arcots and Kolar. Saluva Narashimha defeated the Gajapatis and held Udayagiri, drove out the Pandyas from Tanjore, and took procession of Machilipatnam and Kondaveedu. He later defeated Bahmani forces and recovered most of the empire&#x27;s earlier losses.

After the death of Virupaksha Raya II in 1485, Saluva Narasimha led a coup that ended the dynastic rule while continuing to defend the empire from raids by the Sultanates created from the continuing disintegration of the Bahmani Sultanate in its north. Saluva Narasimha left his two adolescent sons under the care of general Tuluva Narasa Nayaka who ably defended the empire from their traditional enemies, the Gajapati king and the Bahmani Sultan. He also subdued rebelling chiefs of the Chera, the Chola and the Pandya territories. Despite many attempts by nobles and members of the royal family to overthrow him, Narasa Nayaka retained control as regent till 1503.

In 1503, Narasa Nayaka&#x27;s son Vira Narasimha had prince Immadi Narasimha of the Saluva dynasty assassinated and took over the rule in a coup thus becoming the first of the Tuluva dynasty rulers. This did not go well with the nobles who revolted. Seeing internal troubles grow, the Gajapati king and the Bahmani Sultan began to encroach on the empire even as the governors of Ummattur, Adoni, and Talakad colluded to capture the Tungabhadra-Krishna river doab region from the empire. The empire came under the rule of Krishna Deva Raya in 1509, another son of Tuluva Narasa Nayaka. Initially Krishnadevaraya faced many obstacles including dissatisfied nobles, the rebellious chief of Ummattur in the south, a resurgent Gajapati kingdom under King Prataparudra, a growing threat from the newly formed Adil Shahi Sultanate of Bijapur under Yusuf Adil Khan and Portuguese interest in controlling the west coast. Not one to be unnerved by these pressures he strengthened and consolidated the empire, one victory at a time. He was an astute ruler who hired both Hindus and Muslims into his army. In the following decades, the empire covered Southern India and successfully defeated invasions from the five established Deccan sultanates to its north.

===Empire&#x27;s peak===

The empire reached its peak during the rule of Krishna Deva Raya (1509–1529) when Vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious. The empire gained territory from the Deccan sultanates, including Raichur in 1520 and Gulbarga in the central Deccan, and from wars with Sultan Quli Qutb Shah of Golconda in the eastern Deccan; the Kalinga region as well was gained from the Gajapatis of Odisha. This was in addition to the already established presence in the southern Deccan. Many important monuments were either completed or commissioned during the time of Emperor Krishna Deva Raya.

Krishna Deva Raya was succeeded by his younger half-brother Achyuta Deva Raya in 1529. When Achyuta Deva Raya died in 1542, Sadashiva Raya, the teenage nephew of Achyuta Raya, was appointed emperor, with Rama Raya, Krishna Deva Raya&#x27;s son-in-law, becoming the caretaker. When Sadashiva Raya was old enough to assert his independent claim over the throne, Rama Raya made him a virtual prisoner and became the de facto ruler. He hired Muslim generals in his army from his previous diplomatic connections with the Deccan sultanates and called himself &quot;Sultan of the World&quot;. This included both Deccani Muslims recruited from anywhere in the Deccan or Westerners from beyond the Persian Gulf. He was keenly interfering in the internal affairs of the various sultanates in the Deccan and on playing off the Muslim powers against one another, while making himself the ruler of the most powerful and influential regional power. This worked for a while but eventually made him very unpopular among his people and the Muslim rulers. He made a commercial treaty with the Portuguese to stop the supply of horses to Bijapur, then defeated the Bijapur sultan and inflicted humiliating defeats on Golconda and Ahmadnagar.

===Defeat and decline===

Eventually the Deccan sultanates to the north of Vijayanagara united and attacked Rama Raya&#x27;s army in January 1565 in the Battle of Talikota. Regarding the Vijayanagara defeat in battle, Kamath opines that the Sultanate armies, though numerically disadvantaged, were better equipped and trained. Their artillery was manned by expert Turkish gunmen while the Vijayanagara army depended on European mercenaries using outdated artillery. The Sultanate cavalry rode fast moving Persian horses and used spears that were fifteen to sixteen feet long giving them a greater reach, and their archers used metal crossbows which enabled their arrows to reach longer distances. In comparison, the Vijayanagara army depended on slow-moving war elephants, a cavalry riding mostly locally bred weaker horses wielding shorter-reach javelins, and their archers used traditional bamboo bows with a shorter range. Richard Eaton argues that Vijayanagara&#x27;s inferiority was due to Krishna Raya&#x27;s failure to invest in military technology in the years since Raichur because his victory against a technologically superior army led him to underestimate technology&#x27;s value.

Despite these disadvantages, Kamath, Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund concur that the vast Vijayanagara army appeared to have the upper hand until two Muslim generals (identified as the mercenary Gilani brothers according to Kamath) switched sides and joined forces with the Deccan sultanates turning the tide decisively in favor of them. The generals captured Rama Raya and beheaded him, and Sultan Hussain had the severed head stuffed with straw for display. Rama Raya&#x27;s beheading created confusion and havoc in the Vijayanagara army, which were then completely routed. The Deccan sultanates&#x27; army plundered Hampi and reduced it to the ruinous state in which it remains today.

After Rama Raya&#x27;s death, Tirumala Deva Raya started the Aravidu dynasty, founded a new capital of Penukonda to replace the destroyed Hampi, and attempted to reconstitute the remains of Vijayanagara Empire. Tirumala abdicated in 1572, dividing the remains of his empire to his three sons. The Aravidu dynasty successors ruled the region but the empire collapsed in 1614, and the final remains ended in 1646, from continued wars with the Bijapur sultanate and others. During this period, more kingdoms in South India became independent and separate from Vijayanagara, including the Nayakas of Chitradurga, Keladi Nayaka, Mysore Kingdom, Nayak Kingdom of Gingee, Nayaks of Tanjore, and Nayaks of Madurai.

==Governance==


The rulers of the Vijayanagara Empire maintained the administrative methods developed by their predecessors, the Hoysala, Kakatiya and Pandya kingdoms. The emperor, ministry, territory, fort, treasury, military, and ally formed the seven critical elements that influenced every aspect of governance. The emperor was the ultimate authority, assisted by a cabinet of ministers (&quot;Pradhana&quot;) headed by the prime minister (&quot;Mahapradhana&quot;). Other important titles recorded were the chief secretary (&quot;Karyakartha&quot; or &quot;Rayaswami&quot;) and the imperial officers (&quot;Adhikari&quot;). All high-ranking ministers and officers were required to have military training. A secretariat near the emperor&#x27;s palace employed scribes and officers to maintain records made official by using a wax seal imprinted with the ring of the monarch. At the lower administrative levels, wealthy feudal landlords (&quot;Gowdas&quot;) supervised accountants (&quot;Karanikas&quot; or &quot;Karnam&quot;) and guards (&quot;Kavalu&quot;). The palace administration was divided into 72 departments (&quot;Niyogas&quot;), each having several female attendants chosen for their youth and beauty (some imported or captured in victorious battles) who were trained to handle minor administrative matters and to serve men of nobility as courtesans or concubines.

The empire was divided into five main provinces (&quot;Rajya&quot;), each under a commander (&quot;Dandanayaka&quot; or &quot;Dandanatha&quot;) and headed by a governor, often from the royal family, who used the native language for administrative purposes. A &quot;Rajya&quot; was divided into regions (&quot;Vishaya&quot;, &quot;Vente&quot; or &quot;Kottam&quot;) and further divided into counties (&quot;Sime&quot; or &quot;Nadu&quot;), themselves subdivided into municipalities (&quot;Kampana&quot; or &quot;Sthala&quot;). Hereditary families ruled their respective territories and paid tribute to the empire, while some areas, such as Keladi and Madurai, came under the direct supervision of a commander.

On the battlefield, the emperor&#x27;s commanders led the troops. The empire&#x27;s war strategy rarely involved massive invasions; more often it employed small-scale methods such as attacking and destroying individual forts. The empire was among the first in India to use long-range artillery, which were commonly manned by foreign gunners. Army troops were of two types: the emperor&#x27;s personal army directly recruited by the empire and the feudal army under each feudatory. Emperor Krishnadevaraya&#x27;s personal army consisted of 100,000 infantry, 20,000 cavalrymen, and over 900 elephants. The whole army was claimed to number over 1.1 million soldiers, with up to 2 million having been recorded, along with a navy led by a &quot;Navigadaprabhu&quot; (commander of the navy). The army recruited from all classes of society, supported by the collection of additional feudal tributes from feudatory rulers, and consisted of archers and musketeers wearing quilted tunics, shieldmen with swords and poignards in their girdles, and soldiers carrying shields so large that armour was not necessary. The horses and elephants were fully armoured and the elephants had knives fastened to their tusks to do maximum damage in battle.

The capital city was dependent on water supply systems constructed to channel and store water, ensuring a consistent supply throughout the year. The remains of these hydraulic systems have given historians a picture of the prevailing surface water distribution methods in use at that time in the semiarid regions of South India. Contemporary records and notes of foreign travellers describe huge tanks constructed by labourers. Excavations uncovered the remains of a well-connected water distribution system existing solely within the royal enclosure and the large temple complexes (suggesting it was for the exclusive use of royalty, and for special ceremonies) with sophisticated channels using gravity and siphons to transport water through pipelines. In the fertile agricultural areas near the Tungabhadra River, canals were dug to guide the river water into irrigation tanks. These canals had sluices that were opened and closed to control the water flow. In other areas, the administration encouraged digging wells, which were monitored by administrative authorities. Large tanks in the capital city were constructed with royal patronage while smaller tanks were funded by wealthy individuals to gain social and religious merit.

==Economy==

The economy of the empire was largely dependent on agriculture. Wheat, Sorghum (&quot;jowar&quot;), cotton, and pulse legumes grew in semi-arid regions, while sugarcane and rice thrived in rainy areas. Betel leaves, areca (for chewing), and coconut were the principal cash crops, and large-scale cotton production supplied the weaving centers of the empire&#x27;s vibrant textile industry. Spices such as turmeric, pepper, cardamom, and ginger grew in the remote Malnad hill region and were transported to the city for trade. The empire&#x27;s capital city was a thriving business centre that included a burgeoning market in large quantities of precious gems and gold. Prolific temple-building provided employment to thousands of masons, sculptors, and other skilled artisans.

According to Abdur Razzak, much of the empire was fertile and well cultivated. Most of the growers were tenant farmers and were given the right of part ownership of the land over time. Tax policies encouraging needed produce made distinctions between land use to determine tax levies. For example, the daily market availability of rose petals was important for perfumers, so cultivation of roses received a lower tax assessment. Salt production and the manufacture of salt pans were controlled by similar means. The making of ghee (clarified butter), which was sold as an oil for human consumption and as a fuel for lighting lamps, was profitable. Exports to China intensified and included cotton, spices, jewels, semi-precious stones, ivory, rhino horn, ebony, amber, coral, and aromatic products such as perfumes. Large vessels from China made frequent visits and brought Chinese products to the empire&#x27;s 300 ports, large and small, on the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The ports of Mangalore, Honavar, Bhatkal, Barkur, Cochin, Cannanore, Machilipatnam, and Dharmadam were important for they not only provided secure harbors for traders from Africa, Arabia, Aden, the Red sea, China and Bengal but some also served as ship building centers.

When merchant ships docked, the merchandise was taken into official custody and taxes levied on all items sold. The security of the merchandise was guaranteed by the administration officials. Traders of many nationalities (Arabs, Persians, Guzerates, Khorassanians) settled in Calicut, drawn by the thriving trade business. Ship building prospered and keeled ships between 1000 and 1200 &quot;bahares&quot; (burden) were built without decks by sewing the entire hull with ropes rather than fastening them with nails. Ships sailed to the Red Sea ports of Aden and Mecca with Vijayanagara goods sold as far away as Venice. The empire&#x27;s principal exports were pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, myrobalan, tamarind timber, anafistula, precious and semi-precious stones, pearls, musk, ambergris, rhubarb, aloe, cotton cloth and porcelain. Cotton yarn was shipped to Burma and indigo to Persia. Chief imports from Palestine were copper, quicksilver (mercury), vermilion, coral, saffron, coloured velvets, rose water, knives, colored camlets, gold and silver. Persian horses were imported to Cannanore before a two-week land trip to the capital. Silk arrived from China and sugar from Bengal.
East coast trade routes were busy, with goods arriving from Golkonda where rice, millet, pulses and tobacco were grown on a large scale. Dye crops of indigo and chay root were produced for the weaving industry. A mineral rich region, Machilipatnam was the gateway for high quality iron and steel exports. Diamond mining was active in the Kollur region. The cotton weaving industry produced two types of cottons, plain calico and muslin (brown, bleached or dyed). Cloth printed with coloured patterns crafted by native techniques were exported to Java and the Far East. Golkonda specialised in plain cotton and Pulicat in printed. The main imports on the east coast were non-ferrous metals, camphor, porcelain, silk and luxury goods.

Mahanavami festival marked the beginning of a financial year from when the state treasury accounted for and reconciled all outstanding dues within nine days. At this time, an updated annual assessment record of provincial dues, which included rents and taxes, paid on a monthly basis by each governor was created under royal decree.

Temples were taxed for land ownership to cover military expenses. In the Telugu districts the temple tax was called &quot;Srotriyas&quot;, in the Tamil speaking districts it was called as &quot;Jodi&quot;. Taxes such as &quot;Durgavarthana&quot;, &quot;Dannayivarthana&quot; and &quot;Kavali Kanike&quot; were collected towards protection of movable and immovable wealth from robbery and invasions. &quot;Jeevadhanam&quot; was collected for cattle graze on non-private lands. Popular temple destinations charged visitor fees called &quot;Perayam&quot; or &quot;Kanike&quot;. Residential property taxes were called &quot;Illari&quot;.

===Social life===
The Hindu social order was prevalent and it influenced daily life in the empire. The rulers who occupied the top of this hierarchy assumed the honorific &quot;Varnasramadharma&quot; (&quot;lit&quot;, &quot;helpers of the four classes and four stages&quot;). According to Talbot, caste was more importantly determined by occupation or the professional community people belonged to, although the family lineage (&quot;Gotra&quot;) and the broad distinction described in sacred Hindu texts were also factors. The structure also contained sub-castes and caste clusters (&quot;Jati&quot;). According to Vanina, caste as a social identity was not fixed and was constantly changed for reasons including polity, trade and commerce, and was usually determined by context. Identification of castes and sub-castes was made based on temple affiliations, lineage, family units, royal retinues, warrior clans, occupational groups, agricultural and trade groups, devotional networks, and even priestly cabals. It was also not impossible for a caste to lose its position and prestige and slip down the ladder while others rose up the same. Epigraphy studies by Talbot suggests that members within a family could have different social status based on their occupation and the upward movement of a caste or sub-caste was not uncommon based on the breakthroughs achieved by an individual or a group of individuals from the community.

Caste affiliation was closely tied to craft production and members of a common craft formed collective memberships. Often members of related crafts formed inter-caste communities. This helped them consolidate strength and gain political representation and trade benefits. According to Talbot, terminology such as &quot;Setti&quot; was used to identify communities across merchant and artisan classes while &quot;Boya&quot; identified herders of all types. Artisans consisted of blacksmiths, goldsmiths, brasssmiths and carpenters. These communities lived in separate sections of the city to avoid disputes, especially when it came to social privileges. Conquests led to large-scale migration of people leading to marginalisation of natives of a place. The &quot;Tottiyans&quot; were shepherds who later gained marginal ruling status (&quot;poligars&quot;), &quot;Saurashtrans&quot; were traders who came from present-day Gujarat and rivalled the Brahmins for some benefits, the &quot;Reddys&quot; were agriculturists and the &quot;Uppilia&quot; were salt farmers.

According to Chopra et al., in addition to their monopoly over priestly duties, Brahmins occupied high positions in political and administrative fields. The Portuguese traveler Domingo Paes observed an increasing presence of Brahmins in the military. The separation of the priestly class from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial matters, and the nobility and aristocracy ensured their presence in every town and village to maintain order. Vanina notes that within the warrior class was a conglomerate of castes, kinship and clans that usually originated from landholding and pastoral communities. They ascended the social ladder by abandoning their original occupations and adopting to a martial code of living, ethics and practices. In South India they were loosely called the &quot;Nayakas&quot;.
Sati practice is evidenced in Vijayanagara ruins by several inscriptions known as &quot;Satikal&quot; (Sati stone) or &quot;Sati-virakal&quot; (Sati hero stone). There are controversial views among historians regarding this practice including religious compulsion, marital affection, martyrdom or honor against subjugation by foreign intruders.

The socio-religious movements that gained popularity in the previous centuries, such as Lingayatism, provided momentum for flexible social norms that helped the cause of women. By this time South Indian women had crossed most barriers and were actively involved in fields hitherto considered the monopoly of men such as administration, business, trade and the fine arts. Tirumalamba Devi who wrote &quot;Varadambika Parinayam&quot; and Gangadevi the author of &quot;Madhuravijayam&quot; were among the notable women poets of the Sanskrit language. Early Telugu women poets such as Tallapaka Timmakka and Atukuri Molla became popular. Further south the provincial Nayaks of Tanjore patronised several women poets. The Devadasi system, as well as legalized prostitution, existed and members of this community were relegated to a few streets in each city. The popularity of harems among men of the royalty and the existence of seraglio is well known from records.

Well-to-do men wore the &quot;Petha&quot; or &quot;Kulavi&quot;, a tall turban made of silk and decorated with gold. As in most Indian societies, jewellery was used by men and women and records describe the use of anklets, bracelets, finger-rings, necklaces and ear rings of various types. During celebrations men and women adorned themselves with flower garlands and used perfumes made of rose water, civet musk, musk, or sandalwood. In stark contrast to the commoners whose lives were modest, the lives of royalty were full of ceremonial pomp. Queens and princesses had numerous attendants who were lavishly dressed and adorned with fine jewellery. Their numbers ensured their daily duties were light.
Physical exercises were popular with men and wrestling was an important male preoccupation for sport and entertainment, and women wrestlers are also mentioned in records. Gymnasiums have been discovered inside royal quarters and records mention regular physical training for commanders and their armies during peacetime. Royal palaces and marketplaces had special arenas where royalty and common people amused themselves by watching sports such as cock fight, ram fight and female wrestling. Excavations within the Vijayanagara city limits have revealed the existence of various community-based gaming activities. Engravings on boulders, rock platforms and temple floors indicate these were popular locations of casual social interaction. Some of these are gaming boards similar to the ones in use today and others are yet to be identified.

Dowry was in practice and can be seen in both Hindu and Muslim royal families. When a sister of Sultan Ibrahim Adil Shah of Bijapur was married to Burhan Nizam Shah I of Ahmednagar, the town of Sholapur was given to the bride by her family. Ayyangar notes that when the Gajapati King of Kalinga gave his daughter in marriage honoring the victorious Krishnadevaraya he included several villages as dowry. Inscriptions of the 15th and 16th centuries record the practice of dowry among commoners as well. The practice of putting a price on the bride was a possible influence of the Islamic Mahr system. To oppose this influence, in the year 1553, the Brahmin community passed a mandate under royal decree and popularized the &quot;kanyadana&quot; within the community. According to this practice money could not be paid or received during marriage and those who did were liable for punishment. There is a mention of &quot;Streedhana&quot; (&quot;woman&#x27;s wealth&quot;) in an inscription and that the villagers should not give away land as dowry. These inscriptions reinforce the theory that a system of social mandates within community groups existed and were widely practiced even though these practices did not find justification in the family laws described in the religious texts.

===Religion===

The Vijayanagara emperors were tolerant of all religions and sects, as writings by foreign visitors show. The emperors used titles such as &quot;Gobrahamana Pratipalanacharya&quot; (&quot;literally&quot;, &quot;protector of cows and Brahmins&quot;) that testified to their intention of protecting Hinduism. The Nāgarī script inscription at Hampi includes the term &quot;Hinduraya Suratrana&quot;, which historian Benjamin Lewis Rice translates as &quot;the Suratrana of Hindu Rayas&quot;. Some scholars have interpreted this to mean &quot;the Sultan among Hindu kings&quot; and state this to be evidence of some Islamic political traditions being adopted by Hindu monarchs, The long headdress are also seen in the royalty-related and secular artwork in Pattadakal dated from the 7th and 8th century, about 5 centuries before the first Sultanate was formed in South Asia. Similar conical headdress is seen in other sites such as the Ajanta Caves, Ellora Caves, Aihole and Badami, variously dated from the 2nd century to 10th century. as well as that Indian kingdoms recognized their religious identity of being Hindu by the early 14th century. Others interpret the term &quot;Hinduraya Suratrana&quot; to mean &quot;protectors of the gods of (or among) the Hindu kings&quot;. The empire&#x27;s founders, the Sangama brothers (Harihara I and Bukka Raya I), came from a pastoral cowherd background, possibly the Kuruba people, that claimed Yadava lineage in an attempt to claim Kshatriya status like the rest of South Indian dynasties who originated from a pastoral background.
 The founders of the empire were devout Shaivas (worshippers of the Hindu god Shiva) but made grants to Vishnu temples. Their patron saint Vidyaranya was from the Advaita order at Sringeri. The &quot;Varaha&quot; (the boar avatar of Vishnu) was the emblem of the empire. Over one-fourth of the archaeological dig found an &quot;Islamic Quarter&quot; not far from the &quot;Royal Quarter&quot;. Nobles from Central Asia&#x27;s Timurid kingdoms also came to Vijayanagara. The later Saluva and Tuluva kings were Vaishnava (followers of Vishnu) by faith, but also worshipped Venkateshwara (Vishnu) at Tirupati as well as Virupaksha (Shiva) at Hampi. A Sanskrit work, &quot;Jambavati Kalyanam&quot; by Emperor Krishnadevaraya, refers to Virupaksha as &quot;Karnata Rajya Raksha Mani&quot; (&quot;protective jewel of Karnata Empire&quot;). The kings patronised the saints of the dvaita order (philosophy of dualism) of Madhvacharya at Udupi. Endowments were made to temples in the form of land, cash, produce, jewellery and constructions.

The Bhakti (devotional) movement was active during this time, and involved well known Haridasas (devotee saints) of that time. Like the Virashaiva movement of the 12th century, this movement presented another strong current of devotion, pervading the lives of millions. The Haridasas represented two groups, the &quot;Vyasakuta&quot; and &quot;Dasakuta&quot;, the former being required to be proficient in the Vedas, Upanishads and other Darshanas, while the &quot;Dasakuta&quot; merely conveyed the message of Madhvacharya through the Kannada language to the people in the form of devotional songs (&quot;Devaranamas&quot; and &quot;Kirthanas&quot;). The philosophy of Madhvacharya was spread by eminent disciples such as Naraharitirtha, Jayatirtha, Sripadaraya, Vyasatirtha, Vadirajatirtha and others. Vyasatirtha, the &quot;guru&quot; (teacher) of Vadirajatirtha, Purandaradasa (&quot;Pitamaha&quot; or &quot;Father of Carnatic music&quot;) and Kanakadasa earned the devotion of Emperor Krishnadevaraya. The emperor considered the saint his &quot;Kuladevata&quot; (family deity) and honoured him in his writings. During this time, another great composer of early carnatic music, Annamacharya composed hundreds of &quot;Kirthanas&quot; in Telugu at Tirupati in present-day Andhra Pradesh.
The defeat of the Jain Western Ganga Dynasty by the Cholas in the early 11th century and the rising numbers of followers of Vaishnava Hinduism and Virashaivism in the 12th century was mirrored by a decreased interest in Jainism. Two notable locations of Jain worship in the Vijayanagara territory were Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli.

Islamic contact with South India began as early as the seventh century, a result of trade between the Southern kingdoms and Arab lands. Jumma Masjids existed in the Rashtrakuta empire by the tenth century and many mosques flourished on the Malabar coast by the early 14th century. Muslim settlers married local women; their children were known as Mappillas (&quot;Moplahs&quot;) and were actively involved in horse trading and manning shipping fleets. The interactions between the Vijayanagara Empire and the Bahmani Sultanate to the north increased the presence of Muslims in the south. In the early 15th century, Deva Raya built a mosque for the Muslims in Vijayanagara and placed a Quran before his throne.

The introduction of Christianity began as early as the eighth century as shown by the finding of copper plates inscribed with land grants to Malabar Christians. Christian travelers wrote of the scarcity of Christians in South India in the Middle Ages, promoting its attractiveness to missionaries. The arrival of the Portuguese in the 15th century and their connections through trade with the empire, the propagation of the faith by Francis Xavier (1545) and later the presence of Dutch settlements fostered the growth of Christianity in the south.

===Epigraphs and monetization===

Stone inscriptions were the most common form of documents used on temple walls, boundary of properties and open places for public display. Another form of documentation was on copper plates that were meant for record keeping. Usually verbose inscriptions included information such as a salutation, a panegyric of the emperor or local ruler, the name of the donor, nature of the endowment (generally either cash or produce), the manner in which the grant would be used, obligations of the donee, share received by the donor and a concluding statement that officiated the entire donation and its obligations. Some inscriptions record an instance of victory in war or religious festival, and retribution or a curse on those who do not honor the grant.

Most Vijayanagara inscriptions recovered so far are in Kannada, Telugu and Tamil, and a few in Sanskrit. According to Suryanath U. Kamath about 7000 stone inscriptions, half of which are in Kannada, and about 300 copper plates which are mostly in Sanskrit, have been recovered. Bilingual inscriptions had lost favor by the 14th century. According to Mack, the majority of the inscriptions recovered are from the rule of the Tuluva dynasty (from 1503 to 1565) with the Saluva dynasty (from 1485 to 1503) inscribing the least in its brief control over the empire. The Sangama dynasty (from 1336 to 1485) which ruled the longest produced about one third of all epigraphs inscribed during the Tuluva period. Despite the popularity of Telugu language as a literary medium, the majority of the epigraphs in the language were inscribed in the limited period from 1500 to 1649. Talbot explains this scenario as one of shifting political solidarity. The Vijayanagara Empire was originally founded in Karnataka, with Andhra Pradesh serving as a province of the empire. After its defeat to the Deccan sultanates in 1565 and the sacking of the royal capital Vijayanagara, the diminished empire moved its capital to Southern Andhra Pradesh, creating an enterprise dominated by Telugu language.

The Persian visitor Abdur Razzak wrote in his travelogues that the empire enjoyed a high level of monetization. This is especially evident from the number of temple cash grants that were made. Coins were minted using gold, silver, copper and brass and their value depended on material weight. Coins were minted by the state, in the provinces and by merchant guilds. Foreign currency was in circulation. The highest denomination was the gold &quot;Varaha&quot; (or &quot;Hun/Honnu&quot;, &quot;Gadyana&quot;) weighted 50.65 53 grains. The &quot;Partab&quot; or &quot;Pratapa&quot; was valued at half a &quot;Varaha. T&quot;he &quot;Fanam ( or&quot; &quot;Phanam&quot;, &quot;Hana),&quot; an alloy of gold and copper was the most common currency valued at a third of the &quot;Varaha&quot;. A &quot;Tar&quot; made of pure silver was a sixth of a &quot;Phanam&quot; and a &quot;Chital&quot; made of brass was a third of the &quot;Tar&quot;. &quot;Haga&quot;, &quot;Visa&quot; and &quot;Kasu&quot; were also coins of lower denominations.

===Literature===
During the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire, poets, scholars and philosophers wrote primarily in Kannada, Telugu and Sanskrit, and also in other regional languages such as Tamil and covered such subjects as religion, biography, &quot;Prabandha&quot; (fiction), music, grammar, poetry, medicine and mathematics. The administrative and court language of the empire was Kannada. However, Telugu language gained cultural and literary prominence during the reign of the last Vijayanagara emperors, especially Krishnadevaraya.

Most Sanskrit works were commentaries either on the Vedas or on the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics, written by well known figures such as Sayanacharya (who wrote a treatise on the Vedas called &quot;Vedartha Prakasha&quot; whose English translation by Max Muller appeared in 1856), and Vidyaranya that extolled the superiority of the Advaita philosophy over other rival Hindu philosophies. Other writers were famous Dvaita saints of the Udupi order such as Jayatirtha (earning the title &quot;Tikacharya&quot; for his polemical writings), Vyasatirtha who wrote rebuttals to the Advaita philosophy and of the conclusions of earlier logicians, and Vadirajatirtha and Sripadaraya both of whom criticized the beliefs of Adi Sankara. Apart from these saints, noted Sanskrit scholars adorned the courts of the Vijayanagara kings and their feudal chiefs. Some members of the royal family were writers of merit and authored important works such as &quot;Jambavati Kalyana&quot; by Emperor Krishnadevaraya, and &quot;Madura Vijayam&quot; (also known as &quot;Veerakamparaya Charita&quot;) by Princess Gangadevi, a daughter-in-law of Emperor Bukka I, dwells on the conquest of the Madurai Sultanate by the Vijayanagara Empire.

The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called &quot;Devaranama&quot; (lyrical poems) in the native meters of &quot;Sangatya&quot; (quatrain), &quot;Suladi&quot; (beat based), &quot;Ugabhoga&quot; (melody based) and &quot;Mundige&quot; (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many &quot;Dasas&quot; (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote &quot;Gadugina Bharata&quot;, a translation of the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His &quot;Prabhulinga Leele&quot;, later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi).

At this peak of Telugu literature, the most famous writing in the &quot;Prabandha&quot; style was &quot;Manucharitamu&quot;. Emperor Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the &quot;Amuktamalyada&quot;, a story of the wedding of the god Vishnu to Andal, the Tamil Alvar saint poet and the daughter of Periyalvar at Srirangam. In his court were eight famous scholars regarded as the pillars (&quot;Ashtadiggajas&quot;) of the literary assembly. The most famous among them were Allasani Peddana who held the honorific &quot;Andhrakavitapitamaha&quot; (&quot;lit&quot;, &quot;father of Telugu poetry&quot;) and Tenali Ramakrishna who authored several notable works. The other six poets were Nandi Thimmana (Mukku Timmana), Ayyalaraju Ramabhadra, Madayyagari Mallana, Bhattu Murthi (Ramaraja Bhushana), Pingali Surana, and Dhurjati. Srinatha, who wrote books such as &quot;Marutratcharitamu&quot; and &quot;Salivahana-sapta-sati&quot;, was patronised by Emperor Devaraya II and enjoyed the same status as important ministers in the court.

Most Tamil literature from this period came from Tamil-speaking regions, which were ruled by the feudatory Pandya who gave particular attention to the cultivation of Tamil literature. Although Kannada, Telugu, and Sanskrit dominated the courtly and administrative functions of the empire, Tamil literature also thrived, especially in the southern regions ruled by the Vijayanagara Empire. Many Tamil poets and scholars were patronized by both the kings and regional feudatories. Tamil literature during this period was primarily devotional, reflecting the continuing influence of the Bhakti movement. Both Shaiva and Vaishnava traditions were supported, with temples like Srirangam playing a central role in the propagation of Tamil religious texts. Krishnadevaraya, in particular, was known for his support of Tamil Vaishnava literature. The Vaishnava poet Haridasa composed the Irusamaya Vilakkam, a comparative study of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, highlighting the preference for Vaishnava philosophy under the king’s patronage. Other significant Tamil scholars included Svarupananda Desikar, who wrote the Sivaprakasap-perundirattu, an anthology of verses on Advaita philosophy, and his pupil Tattuvarayar, who composed Kurundirattu, a shorter anthology of verses. Additionally, Tamil literature during this period included devotional hymns in praise of Alvars and Nayanmars. Texts such as the Divya Prabandham and Tevaram continued to be revered and performed in temples under the auspices of the empire.

Notable among secular writings on music and medicine were Vidyaranya&#x27;s &quot;Sangitsara&quot;, Praudha Raya&#x27;s &quot;Ratiratnapradipika&quot;, Sayana&#x27;s &quot;Ayurveda Sudhanidhi&quot; and Lakshmana Pandita&#x27;s &quot;Vaidyarajavallabham&quot;. The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics flourished during this period with scholars such as Madhava, who made important contributions to trigonometry and calculus, and Nilakantha Somayaji, who postulated on the orbitals of planets.

===Architecture===


Vijayanagara architecture, according to art critic Percy Brown is a vibrant combination and blossoming of the Chalukya, Hoysala, Pandya and Chola styles, idioms that prospered in previous centuries. Its legacy of sculpture, architecture and painting influenced the development of the arts long after the empire came to an end. Its stylistic hallmark is the ornate pillared &quot;Kalyanamantapa&quot; (marriage hall), &quot;Vasanthamantapa&quot; (open pillared halls) and the &quot;Rayagopura&quot; (tower). Artisans used the locally available hard granite because of its durability since the empire was under constant threat of invasion. An open-air theatre of monuments at its capital at Vijayanagara is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

In the 14th century, the kings continued to build vesara or Deccan-style monuments but later incorporated Dravida-style gopuras to meet their ritualistic needs. The Prasanna Virupaksha temple (underground temple) of Bukka and the Hazare Rama temple of Deva Raya are examples of Deccan architecture. The varied and intricate ornamentation of the pillars is a mark of their work. At Hampi, the &quot;Vitthala&quot; and &quot;Hazara Ramaswamy&quot; temples are examples of their pillared &quot;Kalyanamantapa&quot; style. A visible aspect of their style is their return to the simplistic and serene art developed by the Chalukya dynasty. The &quot;Vitthala&quot; temple took several decades to complete during the reign of the Tuluva kings.
Another element of the Vijayanagara style is the carving and consecration of large monoliths such as the &quot;Sasivekaalu&quot; (mustard) Ganesha and &quot;Kadalekaalu&quot; (ground nut) Ganesha at Hampi, the Gommateshwara (Bahubali) monoliths in Karkala and Venur, and the Nandi bull in Lepakshi. The Vijayanagara temples of Kolar, Kanakagiri, Sringeri and other towns of Karnataka; the temples of Tadpatri, Lepakshi, Ahobilam, Tirumala Venkateswara Temple and Srikalahasti in Andhra Pradesh; and the temples of Vellore, Kumbakonam, Kanchi and Srirangam in Tamil Nadu are examples of this style. Vijayanagara art includes wall-paintings such as the Dashavatara and &quot;Girijakalyana&quot; (marriage of Parvati, Shiva&#x27;s consort) in the Virupaksha Temple at Hampi, the &quot;Shivapurana&quot; murals (tales of Shiva) at the Virabhadra temple at Lepakshi, and those at the Kamaakshi and Varadaraja temples at Kanchi. This mingling of the South Indian styles resulted in a new idiom of art not seen in earlier centuries, a focus on reliefs in addition to sculpture differing from that previously in India.

An aspect of Vijayanagara architecture that shows the cosmopolitanism of the great city is the presence of many secular structures bearing Islamic features. While political history concentrates on the ongoing conflict between the Vijayanagara Empire and the Deccan sultanates, the architectural record reflects a more creative interaction. There are many arches, domes and vaults that show these influences. The concentration of structures like pavilions, stables and towers suggests they were for use by royalty. The decorative details of these structures may have been absorbed into Vijayanagara architecture during the early 15th century, coinciding with the rule of Deva Raya I and Deva Raya II. These kings are known to have employed many Muslims in their army and court, some of whom may have been Muslim architects. This harmonious exchange of architectural ideas must have happened during rare periods of peace between the Hindu and Muslim kingdoms. The &quot;Great Platform&quot; (&quot;Mahanavami Dibba&quot;) has relief carvings in which the figures seem to have the facial features of central Asian Turks who were known to have been employed as royal attendants.

==Travellers and sources==
The sources of Vijayanagara history (its origin, social and political life and eventual defeat) are the accounts of foreign travelers and contemporary literary sources in Sanskrit, Kannada, Persian and Telugu. The Portuguese visitors to the empire were Domingo Paes (1522), Fernão Nunes (1537), Duarte Barbosa (1516) and Barradas (1616). Afanasy Nikitin (1470) came from Russia, while Niccolò de&#x27; Conti (1420), Ludovico di Varthema (1505), Caesar Fredericci (1567) and Filippo Sassetti (1585) were travelers from Italy and Abdul Razzaq (1443) from Persia. Contemporary Muslim writers who were either under the patronage of rival kingdoms (the Deccan sultanates) or were visitors to Vijayanagara and accomplished valuable works are Ziauddin Barani (&quot;Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi&quot;, 1357), Isamy (&quot;Fatuhat us salatin&quot;), Syed Ali Tabatabai (&quot;Burhan-i-Maisar&quot;, 1596), Nisammuddin Bakshi, Firishta (&quot;Tarik-i-Firishta&quot;) and Rafiuddin Shirazi (&quot;Tazkirat ul Mulk&quot;, 1611). Among writings by native authors, the important Sanskrit works that shed light on the empire are &quot;Vidyaranya Kalajnana&quot;, Dindima&#x27;s &quot;Ramabhyudayam&quot; on the life of Emperor Saluva Narasimha, Dindima II&#x27;s &quot;Achyutabhyudayam&quot; and Tirumalamba&#x27;s &quot;Varadambika Parinayam&quot;. Among Kannada literary works, &quot;Kumara Ramana Kathe&quot; by Nanjunda Kavi, &quot;Mohanatarangini&quot; by Kanakadasa, &quot;Keladiripavijayam&quot; by Linganna and the recently discovered &quot;Krishnadevarayana Dinachari&quot; are useful sources, and among Telugu works, Srinatha&#x27;s &quot;Kashikanda&quot;, Mallayya and Singayya&#x27;s &quot;Varahapuranamu&quot;, Vishvanatha Nayani&#x27;s &quot;Rayavachakamu&quot;, Nandi Timmanna&#x27;s &quot;Parijathapaharanamu&quot;, Durjati&#x27;s &quot;Krishnaraja Vijayamu&quot;, Peddanna&#x27;s &quot;Manucharitamu&quot; and Emperor Krishnadevaraya&#x27;s &quot;Amuktamalyada&quot; are important sources of information.

In the memoirs of Niccolò de&#x27; Conti, an Italian merchant and traveller who visited Hampi about 1420, the city had an estimated circumference of and it enclosed agriculture and settlements in its fortifications. In 1442, Abdul Razzaq described it as a city with seven layers of forts, with outer layers for agriculture, crafts and residence, the inner third to seventh layers very crowded with shops and bazaars.

In 1520, Domingo Paes, a Portuguese traveller, visited Vijayanagara as a part of trade contingent from Portuguese Goa. He wrote his memoir as &quot;Chronica dos reis de Bisnaga&quot;, in which he stated Vijayanagara was &quot;as large as Rome, and very beautiful to the sight ... the best provided city in the world&quot;. According to Paes, &quot;there are many groves within it, in the gardens of the houses, many conduits of water which flow into the midst of it, and in places there are lakes ...&quot;.

Cesare Federici, an Italian merchant and traveller, visited a few decades after the 1565 defeat and collapse of the Vijayanagara Empire. According to Sinopoli, Johansen, and Morrison, Federici described it as a very different city. He wrote, &quot;the citie of Bezeneger (Hampi-Vijayanagara) is not altogether destroyed, yet the houses stand still, but emptie, and there is dwelling in them nothing, as is reported, but Tygres and other wild beasts&quot;.

The historian Will Durant, in his &quot;Our Oriental Heritage: The Story of Civilization&quot; recites the story of Vijayanagara and calls its conquest and destruction a discouraging tale. He writes, &quot;its evident moral is that civilization is a precarious thing, whose delicate complex of order and liberty, culture and peace&quot; may at any time be overthrown by war and ferocious violence.

<text>Gournia () is the site of a Minoan palace complex in the Lasithi regional unit on the island of Crete, Greece. Its modern name originated from the many stone troughs that are at the site and its original name for the site is unknown. It was first permanently inhabited during the Early Minoan II periods (approximately between 2650-2100 B.C.E) and was occupied until the Late Minoan I period (approximately between 1700-1470 B.C.E.). Gournia is in a 6 mile cluster of with other Minoan archeological sites which includes Pachyammos, Vasiliki, Monasteraki, Vraika and Kavusi. The site of Pseira is close but slightly outside the cluster.

==Archaeology==
Harriet Boyd-Hawes first excavated the Minoan village for three field seasons in 1901, 1903 and 1904. Boyd and her team were able to expose nearly the entire town, uncovering sixty houses, the cemetery, a road system connecting everything and a central building which she called &quot;the palace&quot;. Similar &quot;palatial&quot; complexes have been found throughout Crete and while recent scholarship have contested this original interpretation, the term &#x27;palatial complex&#x27; remains the scholarly term for them despite being a misnomer. They also excavated at the site of Vasiliki which lies one mile further in on the isthmus. In 1971, 1972, and 1976 Jeffrey Soles and Costis Davaras conducted supplementary modest excavations at the site. In 1973 a lost notebook of Hawes was recovered which contained detailed descriptions and findspots of the recoveries. From 1992 until 1994 Vance Watrous conducted a survey of the site and its surrounding area. After cleaning seasons in 2008 and 2009, from 2010 until 2014 Vance Watrous excavated at the site.

Many of the archaeological finds from Gournia are held at the Heraklion Archaeological Museum and a few at the Penn Museum.

== Layout ==
The main town of Gorunia is located 150 to 200 meters South of a coastal ridge which is itself located 100 meters South of the Northern Cretan coast. On this coastal ridge sits the Sphoungaras cemetery. The town itself is centered around the palatial complex which is located on the central-West side of the town. The South side of the town contains a public court while the North side contains a trench dividing the town from the Northern cemetery which lay 80 meters North of the trench between the town and the coastal ridge. Scholars D. Matthey Buell and John C. McEnroe also label other sections of the town with the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, H and I. Section E, F and I of the town lay on the North side of town but South of the North Trench. Section A, B, C and D lay on the East side of the town while Section H lays on the Southwest side.

== History ==

Occupation at the site began early in the Early Minoan I/II periods (3100-2200 B.C.E.) and by Early Minoan II (2650-2200 B.C.E.) it had become a sizable town. In the Early Minoan II/III periods, burials began in rock shelters on the Sphoungaras ridge (with direct inhumations at Deposits A and B nearby) and on the north ridge (rock shelters V and VI and one built tomb, House Tomb III, which continued in use until the Middle Minoan IA period). In the Middle Minoan IA period (2100-1925 B.C.E.) five additional House Tombs were built (I, II, IV, VII, and VIII).

During the Middle Minoan IB period (1925-1875 B.C.E.) substantial construction began which was later destroyed in the Middle Minoan II period (1875-1700 B.C.E.). Rebuilding occurred in the Middle Minoan III period, which included the palace complex. The site reached its largest extent sometime between the Middle Minoan III and Late Minoan II periods (between 1750 and 1470 B.C.E.). It site covered an area of about 1.68 hectares and included about 64 houses, the palace complex and a 500 square meter town square. It had a cobblestone street system of over one half kilometer in length. This occupation was destroyed in the Late Minoan period IB (1625-1470 B.C.E). As at other Minoan sites all the Linear A tablets were found in that final layer. A Linear A roundel (sealing) from the LM IA period was also found. Other Minoan sites including Zakros to the east and Hagia Triada to the west followed the same sequence of building and destruction. While the causes of this destruction at Gournia are unknown, at Hagia Tradia they are known to be the result of major seismic events.

The settlement was later reoccupied in the Late Minoan III period (1420-1075 B.C.E.)/Mycenae period by Mycenaeans which included the construction of a megaron.

== Cemetery at Sphoungaras and North Cemetery ==

The Sphoungaras cemetery&#x27;s natural rock shelters, openings in the rock, provided the Minoans for a suitable space to bury their dead without the need for physical labor to create or build tombs. The cemetery was in continuous use for the continuous settlement of the site by the Minoans. Inhumation was the preferred mode of body disposal from early Bronze Age until the pithos burial, where the bodies were placed inside a large storage container. This method was introduced and became the norm around 1900-1800 BC. These burials were first excavated by Harriet Boyd and later revisited by Richard Seager in 1910 and by Soles and Davaras in 1970. Some of the artifacts found were various types of complete vases, jewelry, and seals made out of ivory.

The North cemetery was first discovered by Boyd and her team in 1901, she discovered what she described as “intramural burials,” later coining the term “house tombs” to refer to them. Unlike the cemetery in Sphoungaras, people were buried in built structures here. The remains were deposited in no particular order in a charnel house manner.

=== Tomb I ===
The house tomb is a square building measuring approximately 4 meters on all its sides. It is located on the east slope of the North cemetery. It was first excavated by Boyd and revisited in 1971 by a different team of archaeologists, yielding numerous artifacts presumed to be funerary offerings. Among the findings were two small vases, a miniature jug, a mug with no handles from the Middle Minoan IA period (2100-1875 B.C.E.) found in situ; as well as a silver kantharos, two bird&#x27;s nest bowls, a pair of bronze tweezers, stone vases, seals, jewelry and fragmentary sarcophagi with remains of 8 skulls and other unidentified bones.

=== Tomb II ===
Together with Tomb I, the second house tomb are the best preserved funerary structures in Gournia. Unlike Tomb I, this house tomb is rectangular and consists of two rooms; it is the only tomb that has an altar. Altars are commonly found outside of tholoi, round structures where the dead were commonly deposited, in other sites from the South of Crete. Nonetheless, both Tomb I and II would have appeared like normal houses to outsiders without the presence of the shrine due to the use of the same construction techniques and architectural style applied to build the town&#x27;s structures.

Some of the artifacts found in this house tomb were stone seals, fruitstands, three bronze tweezers, terracotta vases, cups, jugs, pithoi, and larnakes. Among these were fragmentary bones with only one salvageable skull. The accumulation and pattern of deposition of the human remains suggest that these were moved to the side once fully skeletonized to make space for more bodies.

<text>The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) is a US nonprofit consortium of more than 100 colleges and universities providing research and training in the atmospheric and related sciences. UCAR manages the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and provides additional services to strengthen and support research and education through its community programs. Its headquarters, in Boulder, Colorado, include NCAR&#x27;s Mesa Laboratory, designed by I.M. Pei.

UCAR was established in 1959 by faculty from 14 leading universities to support and nourish the atmospheric sciences. They were motivated by a newly recognized need for pooled observational and computational facilities and a strong research staff, which together would allow the academic community to carry out complex, long-term scientific programs beyond the reach of individual universities.

This group&#x27;s first major action, in partnership with the National Science Foundation, was to establish NCAR. Since then, UCAR has managed NCAR on behalf of NSF to address pressing scientific and societal needs involving the atmosphere and its interactions with the oceans, land, and Sun—what is now called Earth system science.

UCAR&#x27;s role in supporting and complementing the work of academia has grown to include new research, service, and education efforts, including
* COMET Program - offers professional training on site and online in meteorology, weather hazards, hydrology, oceanography, emergency management, and environmental science
* COSMIC Program - supports satellite and ground-based observations and research using GPS technology for meteorology, climate, and ionospheric studies
* GLOBE Program - provides hands-on, school-based learning and collaboration with a global network of students, scientists, and educators
* Joint Office for Science Support - supports community research, conference, and field projects
* National Science Digital Library Resource Center and Digital Learning Sciences - supports and sustains community digital education projects
* Unidata Program - provides streaming observational data to university classrooms and researchers around the world
* Visiting Scientist Programs - places postdoctoral fellows and visiting scientists at partner institutions

The organization hosts numerous workshops, community meetings, and opportunities for collaboration throughout the year.

== Governance and funding ==

As of 2016, UCAR comprises 109 member colleges and universities and 52 international affiliates. The organization has a total of 1,390 staff, including 877 at NCAR and 282 engaged in community programs. Total expenditures for fiscal year 2015 (October 2014–September 2015) were approximately $204.2 million.

UCAR and NCAR are headquartered in Boulder, Colorado, spread across four campuses. Ancillary activities take place in Cheyenne, Wyoming, Washington, D.C., and in about 15 other states.

Walter Orr Roberts was UCAR&#x27;s first president. Antonio J. Busalacchi Jr. has been UCAR president since August 2016.

<text>The Terek () is a major river in the Northern Caucasus. It originates in the Mtskheta-Mtianeti region of Georgia and flows through North Caucasus region of Russia into the Caspian Sea. It rises near the juncture of the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range and the Khokh Range, to the southwest of Mount Kazbek, winding north in a white torrent between the town of Stepantsminda and the village of Gergeti toward the Russian region North Ossetia and the city of Vladikavkaz. It turns east to flow through Chechnya and Dagestan before dividing into two branches which empty into the Caspian Sea. Below the city of Kizlyar it forms a swampy river delta around wide. The river is a key natural asset in the region, providing irrigation and hydroelectric power in its upper reaches.

The main cities on the Terek include Vladikavkaz, Mozdok, and Kizlyar. Several minor hydroelectric power stations dam the Terek: Dzau electrostation (in Vladikavkaz), Bekanskaya, and Pavlodolskaya.

The construction of the Dariali Hydropower Plant with a planned installed capacity of 108 MW started in 2011 on the territory of Kazbegi municipality near the Russia–Georgia border.

Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s novel &quot;The Cossacks&quot; is set on the Terek and amongst its Cossacks.

==Tributaries==
The Terek&#x27;s source is in the Truso Gorge and drains most of the northeast Caucasus east into the Caspian just as its sister, the Kuban, drains the northwest Caucasus west into the Black Sea. Its major tributaries are the following. In the west a fan of rivers flows east and northeast into the Terek. These are the east-flowing Malka, the Baksan, the Chegem and the Cherek with its two branches. These three join the Malka just before it reaches the Terek. The Liashen, Urukh, Duradur and Duradon flow northeast, the Ardon and its tributary, the Fiagdon flow north and the Gizeldon drains the north slope of Mount Kazbek and reaches the Terek near the mouth of the Ardon. Then there is the north-flowing part of the Terek with the Darial Pass, with two eastern tributaries: Kistinka and Armkhi, flowing into the mountainous region of Ingushetia. The great northwest bend of the Terek is cut off by the northeast-flowing Sunzha which catches most of the north-flowing rivers. These are the north-flowing upper Sunzha, the Assa, the Argun and Khukhulau. East of these are the Aksay and the Aktash which formerly dried up in the lowlands between the Sulak and the Terek. In the east the Sulak drains most of interior Dagestan and turns east to the Caspian before it reaches the Terek.

==Human history==
The capital of Khazaria, Samandar, may have stood on the banks of the river Terek.

The Terek river was the site of the final defeat of the army of Hulagu, khan of the Ilkhanate, at the hands of the army of Berke, khan of the Golden Horde, led by Berke&#x27;s nephew, Nogai Khan, in the first civil war of the Mongol Empire, the Berke–Hulagu war of 1262. Also on the river Timur defeated Tokhtamysh in 1395.

The Terek Cossack Host (1577–1832 and 1860– ) had its base in the Terek basin. During the Russian conquest of the Caucasus it was part of the North Caucasus Line.

During World War II, German forces at the end of August 1942 reached the Terek near Mozdok – the farthest extent of German conquests in the Soviet Union – but aside from a small bridgehead were unable to forge further toward the oil fields of Baku, Hitler&#x27;s objective. The Germans penetrated the left bank of the Terek reaching Vladikavkaz suburbs and West Gizel, near the now built weather station.

<text>Baron Trimlestown, of Trimlestown in County Meath, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. Following the death of the 21st Baron in January 2024 with no known heir, the title is dormant, and may be extinct.

==History==
The title was created in 1461 for Sir Robert Barnewall, who was the younger brother of Nicholas Barnewall, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, and younger son of Sir Christopher Bernevall, Lord Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench in Ireland. He married Elizabeth le Brun, the heiress of Roebuck Castle in South Dublin. He was succeeded by his son Christopher, the second Baron. Christopher was implicated in the Lambert Simnel conspiracy, but received a royal pardon in 1488. His son John, the third Baron, served as Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1534 until his death in 1538. The tenth baron, Matthias Barnewall, was attainded in 1691 for supporting the Jacobite cause, but his brother successfully recovered the title and family estate. 

The barony became dormant on the death of the sixteenth Baron, in 1879. In 1891 the peerage was claimed by Christopher Patrick Mary Barnewall (&quot;de jure&quot; 17th Baron Trimlestown), a descendant of Hon. Patrick Barnewall, second son of the seventh Baron. He died before he had fully established his claim, but in 1893 his younger brother Charles Aloysius Barnewall was confirmed in the title by the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords. 

 the title was held by the grandson of the successful claimant of 1893, the twenty-first Baron, who succeeded his elder brother in 1997. There being no known heir to the barony, on the death of the 21st Baron on 10 January 2024, the title became dormant, and may be extinct, unless a remote heir is found.

==Related titles==
The Viscounts Barnewall were members of another branch of the Barnewall family and a third branch were the Barnewall baronets of Crickstown.

<doc id="478706" wikidata="Q16197023" url="?curid=478706" title="Threatened species">
<text>A threatened species is any species (including animals, plants and fungi) which is vulnerable to extinction in the near future. Species that are threatened are sometimes characterised by the population dynamics measure of &quot;critical depensation&quot;, a mathematical measure of biomass related to population growth rate. This quantitative metric is one method of evaluating the degree of endangerment without direct reference to human activity.

==IUCN definition==
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the foremost authority on threatened species, and treats threatened species not as a single category, but as a group of three categories, depending on the degree to which they are threatened:

*Vulnerable species
*Endangered species
*Critically endangered species

Less-than-threatened categories are near threatened, least concern, and the no longer assigned category of conservation dependent. Species that have not been evaluated (NE), or do not have sufficient data (data deficient) also are not considered &quot;threatened&quot; by the IUCN.

Although &quot;threatened&quot; and &quot;vulnerable&quot; may be used interchangeably when discussing IUCN categories, the term &quot;threatened&quot; is generally used to refer to the three categories (critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable), while &quot;vulnerable&quot; is used to refer to the least at risk of those three categories. They may be used interchangeably in most contexts however, as all vulnerable species are threatened species (&quot;vulnerable&quot; is a category of &quot;threatened species&quot;); and, as the more at-risk categories of threatened species (namely &quot;endangered&quot; and &quot;critically endangered&quot;) must, by definition, also qualify as vulnerable species, all threatened species may also be considered vulnerable.

Threatened species are also referred to as a red-listed species, as they are listed in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Subspecies, populations and stocks may also be classified as threatened.

==By country==
===Australia===
====Federal====
The Commonwealth of Australia (federal government) has legislation for categorising and protecting endangered species, namely the &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot;, which is known in short as the &quot;EPBC Act&quot;. This Act has six categories: extinct, extinct in the wild, critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, and conservation dependent, as defined in Section 179 of the Act. These could be summarised as:
*&quot;Extinct&quot; – &quot;no reasonable doubt that the last member of the species has died&quot;;
*&quot;Extinct in the wild&quot; – &quot;known only to survive in cultivation&quot; and &quot;despite exhaustive surveys&quot; has not been seen in the wild;
*&quot;Critically endangered&quot; – &quot;extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future&quot;;
*&quot;Endangered&quot; – &quot;very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future&quot;;
*&quot;Vulnerable&quot; – &quot;high risk of extinction in the wild in medium-term future&quot;; and
*&quot;Conservation dependent&quot; – &quot;focus of a specific conservation program&quot; without which the species would enter one of the above categories.

The &quot;EPBC Act&quot; also recognises and protects threatened ecosystems such as plant communities, and Ramsar Convention wetlands used by migratory birds.

Lists of threatened species are drawn up under the Act and these lists are the primary reference to threatened species in Australia. The &quot;Species Profile and Threats Database&quot; (SPRAT) is a searchable online database about species and ecological communities listed under the &quot;EPBC Act&quot;. It provides information on what the species looks like, its population and distribution, habitat, movements, feeding, reproduction and taxonomic comments.

A &quot;Threatened Mammal Index&quot;, publicly launched on 22 April 2020 and combined with the &quot;Threatened Bird Index&quot; (created 2018) as the &quot;Threatened Species Index&quot;, is a research collaboration of the National Environmental Science Program&#x27;s Threatened Species Recovery Hub, the University of Queensland and BirdLife Australia. It does not show detailed data of individual species, but shows overall trends, and the data can be downloaded via a web-app &quot;to allow trends for different taxonomic groups or regions to be explored and compared&quot;. The Index uses data visualisation tools to show data clearly in graphic form, including a graph from 1985 to present of the main index, geographical representation, monitoring consistency and time series and species accumulation. In April 2020 the Mammal Index reported that there had been a decline of more than a third of threatened mammal numbers in the 20 years between 1995 and 2016, but the data also show that targeted conservation efforts are working. The &quot;Threatened Mammal Index&quot; &quot;is compiled from more than 400,000 individual surveys, and contains population trends for 57 of Australia&#x27;s threatened or near-threatened terrestrial and marine mammal species&quot;.

====States and territories====

Individual states and territories of Australia are bound under the EPBC Act, but may also have legislation which gives further protection to certain species, for example Western Australia&#x27;s &quot;Wildlife Conservation Act 1950&quot;. Some species, such as Lewin&#x27;s rail (&quot;Lewinia pectoralis&quot;), are not listed as threatened species under the EPBC Act, but they may be recognised as threatened by individual states or territories.

Pests and weeds, climate change and habitat loss are some of the key threatening processes faced by native plants and animals listed by the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment of New South Wales.

=== Germany ===

The German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (, BfN) publishes a regional Red List for Germany of at least 48000 animals and 24000 plants and fungi. The scheme for categorization is similar to that of the IUCN, but adds a &quot;warning list&quot;, includes species endangered to an unknown extend, and rare species that are not endangered, but are highly at risk of extinction due to the small population.

===Philippines===
===United States===
====Federal====
Under the Endangered Species Act in the United States, &quot;threatened&quot; is defined as &quot;any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range&quot;. It is the less protected of the two protected categories. The Bay checkerspot butterfly (&quot;Euphydryas editha bayensis&quot;) is an example of a threatened subspecies protected under the Endangered Species Act.

====States====
Within the U.S., state wildlife agencies have the authority under the ESA to manage species which are considered endangered or threatened within their state but not within all states, and which therefore are not included on the national list of endangered and threatened species. For example, the trumpeter swan (&quot;Cygnus buccinator&quot;) is threatened in the state of Minnesota, while large populations still remain in Canada and Alaska.

<doc id="478707" wikidata="Q1358572" url="?curid=478707" title="Juxtaglomerular apparatus">
<text>The juxtaglomerular apparatus (also known as the juxtaglomerular complex) is a structure in the kidney that regulates the function of each nephron, the functional units of the kidney. The juxtaglomerular apparatus is named because it is next to (juxta-) the glomerulus.

The juxtaglomerular apparatus consists of three types of cells:
# the macula densa, in the distal straight tubule (thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle), after which the distal convoluted tubule begins 
# juxtaglomerular cells, (also known as granular cells) which secrete renin
# extraglomerular mesangial cells

==Location==
The juxtaglomerular apparatus is part of the kidney nephron, next to the glomerulus. It is found between afferent arteriole and the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (distal straight tubule) of the same nephron. This location is critical to its function in regulating renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. 

==Function==

===Juxtaglomerular cells===
Renin is produced by juxtaglomerular cells, also known as granular cells. These cells are similar to epithelium and are located in the tunica media of the afferent arterioles as they enter the glomeruli. The juxtaglomerular cells secrete renin in response to:

*Stimulation of the beta-1 adrenergic receptor
*Decrease in renal perfusion pressure (detected directly by the juxtaglomerular cells)
*Decrease in NaCl concentration at the macula densa, often due to a decrease in glomerular filtration rate

===Extraglomerular mesangial cells===
Extraglomerular mesangial cells are located in the junction between the afferent and efferent arterioles. These cells have a contractile property similar to vascular smooth muscles and thus play a role in “regulating GFR” by altering the vessel diameter. Renin is also found in these cells.

===Macula densa===
At the point where the afferent arterioles enter the glomerulus and the efferent arteriole leaves it, the tubule of the nephron touches the arterioles of the glomerulus from which it arose. At this location, in the wall of the last portion of distal straight tubule, there is a modified region of tubular epithelium called the macula densa.(Fig. 5 in Kumaran and Hanukoglu 2020)
Cells in the macula densa respond to changes in the sodium chloride levels in the distal tubule of the nephron via the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) loop. Within the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule begins immediately following the macula densa. 

The macula densa&#x27;s detection of elevated sodium chloride, which leads to a decrease in GFR, is based on the concept of purinergic signaling. An increase in the salt concentration causes several cell signals (e.g. adenosine release) that leads to constriction of the adjacent afferent arteriole. This decreases the amount of blood coming from the afferent arterioles to the glomerular capillaries, and therefore decreases the amount of fluid that goes from the glomerular capillaries into the Bowman&#x27;s space (the glomerular filtration rate (GFR)).

When there is a decrease in the sodium concentration, less sodium is reabsorbed in the macular densa cells. The cells increase the production of nitric oxide and prostaglandins to vasodilate the afferent arterioles and increase renin release.

&quot;TGF mechanism&quot;.

==Clinical significance==
Excess secretion of renin by the juxtaglomerular cells can lead to excess activity of the renin–angiotensin system, hypertension and an increase in blood volume. This is not responsive to the usual treatment for essential hypertension, namely medications and lifestyle modification.

One cause of this can be increased renin production due to narrowing of the renal artery, or a juxtaglomerular cell tumor that produces renin. These will lead to secondary hyperaldosteronism, which will cause hypertension, high blood sodium, low blood potassium, and metabolic alkalosis.

<text>Eaton&#x27;s Corrasable Bond is a trademarked name for a brand of erasable typing paper. Erasable paper has a glazed or coated surface which is almost invisible, is easily removed by friction, and accepts typewriter ink fairly well. Removing the coating removes the ink on top of it, so mistakes can be easily erased once. After erasure, the paper itself is exposed, and further mistakes cannot be easily erased.

Because the coated surface does not absorb ink, documents printed on erasable paper are prone to smudging. Since the coating is intended to be easily removed by friction, the typed pages are not very durable. Under some storage conditions, the coating can cause pages to stick together. Erasable paper is not suitable for legal documents or archival records. It was available in a number of thicknesses.

Eaton&#x27;s Corrasable Bond is no longer manufactured.

In the United States, Eaton&#x27;s Corrasable Bond was a very familiar brand of erasable typing paper during the mid-1950s and 1960s, and &quot;corrasable&quot; became almost a generic name for erasable typing paper. For example, in prohibiting the use of such paper for manuscript submissions, the Linguistic Society of America refers to &quot;Eaton&#x27;s &#x27;Corrasable Bond&#x27; and similar brands.&quot;

Writer Peter David, who worked as an editor&#x27;s assistant at the E. P. Dutton imprint Elsevier/Nelson before becoming a professional writer, once related finding a submission written on erasable bond, which made the print difficult to read. In a 1992 &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; column in which he provided aspiring writers with tips on composing submissions, he stated, &quot;Don&#x27;t write on anything other than standard-weight white bond paper. I don&#x27;t care what Abe Lincoln or Jack Kerouac wrote on; you&#x27;re not Lincoln or Kerouac. And for crying out loud, don&#x27;t use erasable bond. That wasn&#x27;t a dodge the writer used in &quot;Misery&quot; to get Annie out of the house; no real writer types on erasable bond.&quot;

==In fiction==
The paper is mentioned in the Stephen King novel &quot;Misery&quot;, when Annie Wilkes buys it for Paul Sheldon, thinking that since it is the most expensive paper, it has to be the best. When Paul shows Annie that Corrasable Bond is smudge-prone, and hence detested by editors, Annie thinks he is being ungrateful and, in a fit of bad temper, smashes her fist down onto a sitting Paul Sheldon&#x27;s shattered knee, causing him agonizing pain. In the film adaptation, she instead smashes his knee with the ream of paper itself.

&quot;Divorce or Corrasable Bond&quot; is a poem by Daniela Gioseffi.

In the tenth chapter of Sylvia Plath&#x27;s &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, Esther, the main character, mentions this paper when she sets up a place to start writing a novel. &quot;I counted out three hundred and fifty sheets of corrasable bond from my mother&#x27;s stock&quot;...

In the first chapter of T.C. Boyle&#x27;s &quot;Outside looking in&quot;, there is a Ford Fairlane that has tires &quot;worn as smooth as the sheets of Corrasable Bond&quot;.

<doc id="478716" wikidata="Q1600879" url="?curid=478716" title="Lenaia">
<text>The Lenaia () was an annual Athenian festival with a dramatic competition. It was one of the lesser festivals of Athens and Ionia in ancient Greece. The Lenaia took place in Athens in Gamelion, roughly corresponding to January. The festival was in honour of Dionysus Lenaios. There is also evidence the festival also took place in Delphi.

The term &quot;Lenaia&quot; probably comes from &quot;&quot;lenos&quot; &#x27;wine-press&#x27; or from &quot;lenai&quot;&quot;, another name for the Maenads (the female worshippers of Dionysus).

==Overview==
The Lenaia is depicted on numerous vases, which show both typical Maenad scenes and those of aristocrats and wine-mixing rituals. It is unknown exactly what kind of worship occurred at the festival, but it may have been in honor of Dionysus as a youth or the rebirth of Dionysus after his murder by the Titans. It may have also had some connection with the Eleusinian Mysteries, as some of the same religious officials were involved (such as the &quot;Archon basileus &quot; and the &quot;epimeletai&quot;). These officials led the procession (πομπή &quot;pompe&quot;), which probably ended with a sacrifice. The references we have mention a procession and ἀγών held ‘by torchlight,’ where an Eleusian official, originating in Athens, called upon or invoked Dionysus. Then, the chorus would respond ‘Iacchos, son of Semele, Πλουτοδότης.’ Most of all, the festival appears to be an agrarian one. It was celebrated at a crucial time for propitiating the awakening of nature. Specifically, the grape and wine, symbolised by the god himself, his death and reemergence from the underworld. Though, this was not the time of the grape harvest, but rather when the vines were pruned.

The festival may have had rites for women. The coincidence of invoking Iacchus, seen as Dionysus as a child, by torchlight and commemorating the myth of the god&#x27;s death and rebirth. This happened both in Delphi and in Athens in the Lenaia, in the same season, winter. It further supports the idea that Attic Lenaia had a specific ritual involving women, the followers of the god. The ritual associated in this case with the idea of the resurrection of the god associated with wine production and the wine press. Though, whether or not it was a festival for women, or that festival heavily involved them, is still a debate. In Athens, there was no mention of a women&#x27;s festival. However, that could be due to that women are associated with Dionysus&#x27;s secret and sacred rites, which wouldn&#x27;t normally be talked about or made public.

Athenian woman probably participated in the nocturnal rites. They may have played an important role in ‘calling’ or invoking the god. But, they were not the main focus and are not even mentioned in the texts. However, women are depicted on Attic vases as being close to the process of wine production along with the unmixed wine. Along with that, the satyrs of untamed nature are also found, along with the god himself.

In Athens, the festival was originally held in the Lenaion (possibly a theatre outside the city or a section of the Agora) but probably moved to the Theatre of Dionysus by the mid-fifth century. Beginning in the second half of the 5th century BC, plays were performed (as they were at the City Dionysia festival later in the year). The audiences for the Lenaia were usually limited to the local population, since travel by sea at that time of year was considered unsafe. Metics, however, were apparently allowed to both participate and act as &quot;choregoi&quot;. Around 442 BC, new comic contests were officially included in the Lenaia, though plays may have been performed there earlier on an informal basis. At first, the festival held dramatic competitions only for comedy, but in 432 BC a tragic contest was introduced. Many of Aristophanes&#x27; plays were first performed there, such as &#x27;Knights&#x27;. As with the competition at the City Dionysia, five comedies usually competed (except during the Peloponnesian War when only three were staged). When the contest for tragedy was introduced, two tragedians competed, each presenting two plays. There is no evidence of satyr plays being performed, but dithyrambs were included in the third century BC. Towards the end of the century, the festival&#x27;s plays were performed in the Theatre of Dionysus (although it is unclear when this location was first used). It is unknown when the Lenaia was abandoned, but contests of some sort continued into the 2nd century BC.

<doc id="478718" wikidata="Q4862852" url="?curid=478718" title="Baron Talbot of Malahide">
<text>Baron Talbot of Malahide (or de Malahide) is a title that has been created twice for members of the same family—in 1831 in the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Talbot &quot;of&quot; Malahide, and in 1856 in the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Talbot &quot;de&quot; Malahide. While the barony of 1856 became extinct in 1973, the barony of 1831 is extant. Until 1976, the ancestral seat of the family was Malahide Castle, close to the village of that name, north of Dublin, Ireland.

==History==
The Normans arrived from England in 1171. With their superior armour and weapons they quickly captured Dublin, forcing the Danish king, Hamund MacTurkill, to retire to his lands in Kinsaley. From here he endeavoured to mobilise a fleet to recapture Dublin but failed and was subsequently beheaded. Among the invading Normans was Sir Richard de Talbot, a young knight from Shrewsbury but of French descent. He served his master, King Henry II, well in the invasion of Ireland and was rewarded with a grant of lands around Malahide about 1185. In 1475, his descendant had his standing further enhanced when King Edward IV conferred the title ‘Lord High Admiral of Malahide and the Seas Adjoining’ with an entitlement to customs dues. Beginning with a ‘motte and bailey’, a fortified enclosure, at Wheatfield opposite the Community School, the Talbots later built a fortified stone castle beside the nearby ancient church of St. Fenweis. Talbots occupied their castle continuously for eight hundred years except for the period from 1653 to 1660 when John Talbot and his family were sent to Connaught under the notorious ‘To Hell or to Connaught’ edict in Cromwellian times.

The first creation, as Baron Talbot of Malahide, &quot;in the County of Dublin&quot;, was in the Peerage of Ireland in 1831 for Margaret Talbot, née O&#x27;Reilly, the widow of Richard Talbot, heir of the ancient Lords of Malahide. She was succeeded by their eldest son, the second Baron. In 1839 he was created Baron Furnival, &quot;of Malahide in the County of Dublin&quot;, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. However, this title became extinct on his death, while he was succeeded in the Irish barony by his younger brother, the third Baron. The latter was succeeded by his son, the fourth Baron. In 1856 he was created Baron Talbot de Malahide, &quot;of Malahide in the County of Dublin&quot;, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, and later held office as a government whip in the Liberal administrations of Lord Palmerston and Lord Russell.

When he died the titles passed to his eldest son, the fifth Baron, who married firstly Emily Harriette Boswell (d. 1898) and then Isabel Gurney, an English philanthropist. This line of the family failed on the death in 1948 of the fifth baron&#x27;s son, the sixth Baron. The peerages were inherited by the late Baron&#x27;s first cousin, the seventh Baron. He was the son of the Honourable Milo George Talbot, fourth son of the fourth Baron. Lord Talbot de Malahide was a diplomat and notably served as British Ambassador to Laos from 1955 to 1956. However, on his death in 1973 the barony of 1856 became extinct, while the Irish peerage passed to his third cousin, the eighth Baron. He was the second son of John Reginald Charles Talbot, grandson of Admiral The Hon. Sir John Talbot, third son of the first Baroness. When he died the title passed to his younger brother, the ninth Baron. The latter was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the tenth holder of the title. In turn he was succeeded by his son in 2016.

The 10th Baron Talbot of Malahide was the son of Reginald John Arthur Arundell (who in 1945 assumed by Royal licence the surname and arms of Arundell), eldest son of Reginald Aloysius Talbot (grandson of the aforementioned Admiral the Hon. Sir John Talbot) and his wife, Mabile Mary Arundell, daughter of Hon. Robert Arthur Arundell, fourth son of James Everard Arundell, 9th Baron Arundell of Wardour, and Charlotte Stuart Parkin, youngest daughter of Dr. Henry Parkin, RN, Inspector-General of Hospitals and Fleets. Lord Talbot of Malahide also holds the title &quot;Hereditary Lord Admiral of Malahide and Adjacent Seas&quot; (created by King Edward IV). His wife Patricia Mary, Lady Talbot of Malahide, is a Dame of the Sovereign Order of Malta.

The Honourable Sir John Talbot, third son of the first Baroness Talbot of Malahide, was a naval commander. The Honourable Thomas Talbot, fourth son of the first Baroness, was a Canadian politician. Two of Lady Talbot of Malahide&#x27;s brothers are also notable: Hugh O&#x27;Reilly took the surname of Nugent and was created a baronet in 1795 (see Nugent baronets), while Andrew O&#x27;Reilly was a General der Kavallerie in the Austrian Army and made a Count of the Austrian Empire.

<doc id="478719" wikidata="Q1291152" url="?curid=478719" title="Werburgh">
<text>Werburgh (also &quot;Wærburh&quot;, &quot;Werburh&quot;, &quot;Werburga&quot;, meaning &quot;true city&quot;; ; c. AD 650 – 3 February 700) was an Anglo-Saxon princess who became the patron saint of the city of Chester in Cheshire. Her feast day is the 3rd of February.

==Life==
Werburgh was born at Stone (now in Staffordshire), and was the daughter of King Wulfhere of Mercia (himself the Christian son of the pagan King Penda of Mercia) and his wife St Ermenilda, herself daughter of the King of Kent. She obtained her father&#x27;s consent to enter the Abbey of Ely, which had been founded by her great-aunt Etheldreda (or Audrey), the first Abbess of Ely and former queen of Northumbria, whose fame was widespread. Werburgh was trained at home by St Chad (afterwards Bishop of Lichfield), and by her mother; and in the cloister by her aunt and grandmother. Werburgh was a nun for most of her life. During some of her life she was resident in Weedon Bec, Northamptonshire.

Werburgh was instrumental in convent reform across England. She eventually succeeded her mother Ermenilda, her grandmother Seaxburh, and great-aunt Etheldreda as fourth Abbess of Ely. She died on 3 February 700 and was buried at Hanbury in Staffordshire.

==Veneration==

Following Werburgh&#x27;s death, her brother Coenred became king of Mercia. In 708 he decided to move his sister&#x27;s remains to a more conspicuous place within the church at Hanbury. When the tomb was opened, her body was found to be miraculously intact. This preservation was taken as a sign of divine favour. A year later Coenred had abdicated as king and taken holy orders, becoming a monk in Rome. It was at this time that the most famous story about Werburgh appeared, according to which she restored a dead goose to life after it had been eaten, as recounted by the medieval hagiographer Goscelin. A stained glass window in the Church of St Peter and St Paul, Weedon Bec, Northamptonshire relates to another tale in which she was said to have banished all the geese from the village.

The shrine of St Werberh remained at Hanbury until the threat from Danish Viking raids in the late 9th century prompted their relocation to within the walled city of Chester. A shrine to St Werberh was established at the Church of St Peter and St Paul (the site is now occupied by Chester Cathedral). In 975, the Church of St Peter and St Paul was re-dedicated to St Werburgh and the Northumbrian saint Oswald. A monastery in the names of these two saints was attached to the church in the 11th century.

By 1057 the Abbey church was rebuilt and further endowed by Leofric, Earl of Mercia. By this time, Werburgh was regarded as the patron saint and protector of Chester. A miracle attributed to her was the unexpected withdrawal of the Welsh king Gruffudd ap Llywelyn from besieging the city.

Even after 1066 and the Norman conquest of England, the shrine of St Werburgh was a place of veneration. In 1093, Hugh d&#x27;Avranches, the second Norman Earl of Chester, presented gifts of property to the abbey and had the church enlarged and rebuilt. He also established a Benedictine monastery. Its monks came from Bec Abbey in Normandy, which had provided the first two post-Conquest Archbishops of Canterbury: Lanfranc and Anselm. Like many other Anglo-Norman barons, Hugh d&#x27;Avranches entered the monastery shortly before he died and, in turn, was buried there. During the Middle Ages, the badge of a gaggle of geese was adopted as proof of having made a pilgrimage to the Shrine of St Werburgh.

In 1540 the dissolution of the abbey led to the creation of Chester Cathedral, which was rededicated to Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary. Although an elaborate shrine had been constructed in the 14th century to Werburgh, this was broken up at the time of the Dissolution. Werburgh&#x27;s relics were lost. Parts of the shrine&#x27;s stonework that survived were reassembled in 1876. The shrine remains on display in the cathedral&#x27;s Lady Chapel at the back of the main nave.

==Today==

St Werburgh remains the patron saint of Chester. Her feast day is 3 February.

At least ten churches in England, and some overseas, are dedicated to St Werburgh, including those in Dublin, Derby, Stoke-on-Trent and Spondon. The village of Warburton in Greater Manchester (previously Cheshire) is named after its parish church of St Werburgh, and a neighbourhood in Bristol is named St Werburghs after its church (now a climbing centre). The Manchester Metrolink line to East Didsbury has St Werburgh&#x27;s Road, at the crossroads with Wilbraham Road where there is a church dedicated to St Werburgh.

<text>Baron Louth is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It has been created twice.

==History==
The title was created firstly c. 1458 for Sir Thomas Bathe, later Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer. Although he had at least one son, John Bathe of Ardee, the title seems to have become extinct soon after his death in 1478.

It was created secondly in 1541 for Sir Oliver Plunkett. His great-great-great-grandson, the seventh Baron, served as Lord Lieutenant of County Louth. However, he later supported King James II and was outlawed. His great-great-grandson, the eleventh Baron, managed to obtain a reversal of the outlawry and was restored to the title. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s great-great-great-great-grandson, the seventeenth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2013.

Admiral Peter Warren was a female-line great-grandson of the fifth Baron.

Saint Oliver Plunkett was very distantly related to the Barons of Louth.

Not to be confused with the title of Earl of Louth.

<doc id="478733" wikidata="Q741949" url="?curid=478733" title="Fiat Uno">
<text>The Fiat Uno is a supermini manufactured and marketed by Fiat. Launched in 1983, the Uno was produced over a single generation (with an intermediate facelift, 1989) in three and five-door hatchback body styles until 1995 in Europe — and until 1 January 2014, in Brazil. Designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro of Italdesign, the Uno strongly recalled the high-roof, up-right packaging of Giugiaro&#x27;s 1978 Lancia Megagamma concept, in a smaller configuration.

With over 8,800,000 built, it is the eighth most produced automobile platform in history, after the Volkswagen Beetle, Ford Model T, Fiat 124, 1965–1970 GM B platform, 1981–1997 GM J platform, 1961–1964 GM B platform, and 1977–1990 GM B platform.

The Uno name was reintroduced in 2010 in South America for the Fiat Mini (Economy) platform based car built in Brazil.

==First generation (1983)==

The Fiat Uno (Type 146) was launched in January 1983 to replace the Fiat 127. The tall, square body used a Kamm tail, achieved a drag coefficient of 0.34 and was noted for its interior space, fuel economy as well as its ride and handling. The project name was &quot;Tipo Uno&quot; (&quot;Type 1&quot;), as it followed the &quot;Tipo Zero&quot; (Panda).

Launched a month before the Peugeot 205, a noted competitor, the Uno went on sale just after General Motors launched its new Opel Corsa supermini (marketed as the Vauxhall Nova in the UK), quickly gaining competition from the Ford Fiesta and Nissan Micra.

United Kingdom sales began in June 1983, with more than 20,000 sold in its first full year and peaking at more than 40,000 sales in 1988.

In December 1983, the Uno was European Car of the Year for 1984, finishing narrowly ahead of the Peugeot 205.

Initially, the Uno was offered with the 0.9 litre (903 cc) 100-series OHV, 1.1 litre (1116 cc) and 1.3 litre (1301 cc) 128-series SOHC petrol engines and transmissions carried over from the 127. Typical for Fiats of the era, the Uno&#x27;s badging did not reflect engine size but indicated metric horsepower output: 45, 55, 60, 70, or 75. The Uno was available as either a three or five-door hatchback. It also featured ergonomic switchgear clusters each side of the main instrument binnacle, user-operable with hands on the steering wheel, with only a single steering column stalk to control the turn signals and horn - thus dispensing from Fiat&#x27;s traditional three-stalk system that had been employed on its cars since the late 1960s.

The Uno had MacPherson strut independent front suspension and twist-beam rear suspension with telescopic dampers and coil springs.

From 1985, the 1.0 litre (999 cc) SOHC Fully Integrated Robotised Engine (FIRE) powerplant was offered, replacing the 0.9 litre unit. This was a lighter engine, built with fewer parts, and gave improved performance and economy. The most luxurious version, the single-point injected 75 SX i.e., had remote door locks, integrated front foglamps, and the oval exhaust tip also used on the Turbo.

===Turbo i.e.===
In April 1985 the hot hatch version of the first series Uno – the Uno Turbo i.e. – was launched as a three-door only derivative. The Turbo i.e. model used a Ritmo/Strada-derived 1.3 128-series engine with Bosch multi-point fuel injection, Magneti Marelli electronic ignition and a water-cooled IHI turbocharger with an intercooler to reduce intake air temperatures. Engine capacity was initially stated as 1299 cc but this was revised early on in production to 1301 cc. This change was a result of Italy&#x27;s highway system allowing a higher speed limit to cars of more than 1300 cc. In both forms the engine offered but owners report that the 1301 cc version was notably more responsive and had greater torque than the earlier 1299 cc unit. Cars built from 1985 to late 1987 were fitted with a Ritmo/Strada-derived five-speed gearbox. This was then replaced by a newly developed &#x27;C510&#x27; five-speed gearbox, featuring a more durable differential and improved gearchange linkage. Ratios were unchanged between the two units. The Turbo reached , establishing it as one of the very fastest hot hatches of the 1980s.
Externally, the Turbo i.e. model featured black plastic sill trims, arch extensions, fibreglass tailgate with spoiler, tinted side glass, side decals, revised front bumper with foglamps and inlets/scoops to direct air to the oil cooler and intercooler. Suspension was lowered and uprated, 13&quot; alloy wheels with Pirelli P6 tyres were fitted and the brakes upgraded to vented discs on the front and solid discs on the rear.
The Turbo i.e. featured &#x27;sports&#x27; seats, red carpet and an extended centre-console. Later models featured red seatbelts.

Options on the Turbo i.e. model included polished Cromodora wheels, electric windows, manual sunroof and digital instrument panel, the latter with bar-graphs for fuel level, coolant temperature, boost pressure, etc., and a digital speed display, switchable between km/h and mph.

An option on later first series Turbo i.e. models included a simple form of ABS that only operated on the front wheels. The system operated once per ignition cycle, requiring an ignition-initiated reset, had the system been triggered.

===Diesel and Selecta models===
In mid-1983 the 1.3-litre diesel which had already been seen in the Fiorino and the 147 was installed in the Uno as well, originally only for the Italian market. The Brazilian-built engine was derived from 124-series engines, and was never sold in the United Kingdom. It was added to other European markets beginning in early 1984. Daily production in mid-1983 was 280 cars, out of a daily total of 2000. It was sold as the Uno D (three doors) or the Uno DS (&quot;Super&quot;, five doors). This badging was the only external giveaway, while in the interior an oil pressure gauge was added. It also received extra sound insulation under the hood and along the firewall. The engine has , as did the smallest 903 cc petrol unit, but with considerably higher torque. The weight penalty was rather than for the 903. Additional accessories and sound deadening measures accounted for the remainder of the weight difference, almost all of it over the front wheels.

In 1986, a 1.7 litre diesel engined 60DS version was launched together with the Uno Selecta continuously variable transmission (CVT) automatic. The 1.7L naturally aspirated diesel was the only diesel Uno sold in the UK. The CVT transmission was a co-development with Dutch Van Doorne and Ford, (Fiat owned 24% stake of Van Doorne at that time). There was also a 1.4-liter turbodiesel (Uno Turbo D), which offered . This model was very quick for a small diesel at the time, and had better acceleration than the petrol-engined Uno 70, while fuel consumption was about a third lower. Noise levels were actually marginally lower than those of the 70 SX. The suspension was firmer to accommodate the heavier engine, while an oil temperature gauge was standard fitment.

===Uno CS===
The Uno was also produced in Brazil, called Uno CS, and imported in some European countries. But it was a totally different car: it was riding on a Fiat 147-derived platform, with four-wheel MacPherson suspension (with transverse leaf spring at the rear). Visual differences from the European Uno were the fuel cap, placed on the left, and the bonnet, of a clamshell design and hinged at the front. It had also had its own engines, part of the &quot;Brazil&quot; engine series.

===Yugo Uno 45R===
From 1988 to 1994, first series Uno was assembled in Kragujevac, Yugoslavia by Zastava. It was fitted with a 903 cc engine also used in the Yugo 45. Only the three-door version was available. Due to a higher price than the Yugo, the Uno 45R was discontinued in 1994, after 2,620 examples had been produced.

=== Facelift ===
First shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 1989, the Uno received a facelift with revised front styling and revised tailgate, the latter improving the drag coefficient to Cd 0.30. The interior was revised with a new dashboard which dispensed with the pod-style switchgear in favour of conventional stalks on the steering column. The 1.1 litre engine was replaced by a FIRE version, and a Fiat Tipo-derived 1.4 litre (1,372 cc) engine replaced the 128/Ritmo/Strada-derived 1.3 litre in both naturally aspirated and turbo versions. A 1.4 litre Uno Turbo could reach a claimed , while the 1.0 version only managed depending on which transmission was fitted. The Uno Turbo i.e. variant was also restyled, upgraded with a Garret T2 turbine, Bosch LH Jetronic fuel injection and better aerodynamics.

Uno production ended in Italy in 1995 with 6,032,911 manufactured in Fiat&#x27;s Italian factories. From 1994 to 2002, Uno was manufactured in Poland for Fiat Auto Poland. Polish-made Unos were marketed in Italy until 1997 as the Innocenti Mille Clip. Polish production initially took place in Bielsko-Biała, and from 2000 to 2002 in Tychy. Engines available were three petrol units (all naturally aspirated and fuel injected) – 0.9 litre from Seicento (years 1999–2002 only), 1.0 fire, 1.4 and one naturally aspirated diesel unit of 1.7 litres.

=== Engines (first and second series) ===

==== Petrol ====
==== Diesel ====
=== Continuing global production (1995–2014) ===
After Western European production and sales ceased, the Uno continued to be manufactured and sold in many other regions.

==== Argentina ====
In Argentina, the 3-door Fiat Uno was produced by Sevel Argentina from March 1989 to 2000, 179,767 units were built. The Uno&#x27;s Fiasa engines ranged from the 1,049 cc petrol four to a 1.3 and 1.5 litre version, with a 1.3-litre diesel engine also available. The 1.6-litre Lampredi SOHC SCV/SCR version sat at the top of the range. A 1.7 liter diesel with was added in 1992 and soon displaced the 1.3 option.

A saloon version with four doors was also produced from 1988 to 2001. Called Duna or Elba (station wagon), 257,259 units of this version were built in Fiat&#x27;s Córdoba plant.

==== Brazil ====
The car was made in Brazil until January 2014 in three versions: Mille Economy, Uno Furgão (panel van) and Fiorino Furgão. A total of 3.6 million Unos and Milles were built in Brazil during its 30-year production run. During the 1990s it was imported in Italy as &quot;Innocenti Mille&quot;.
In the second half of the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, the Uno was also available as a saloon, a pick-up, and in a wagon version. These are called Prêmio, Fiorino Pick-Up, and Elba respectively.

The Brazilian Uno featured an independent, transverse leaf spring suspension at the rear, based on the tried and tested Brazilian Fiat 147 (similar to the 
Italian Fiat 127). The clamshell design of the bonnet was also unique, since the Brazilian Uno kept the spare tyre located in the engine bay, like the old Fiat 147, thus saving extra space for the luggage in the boot. Originally sold with 1.05, 1.3 or 1.5 litre petrol engines (also in versions made to run on ethanol), and a 1.6 litre was added to the lineup in 1989. The now redundant 1.5 was cancelled, but another 1.5 was introduced in 1991, this one derived from the 1.3.

The Brazilian Fiat Uno family was topped by a sporting turbocharged 1.4-litre inline-four version (118 HP), the Uno Turbo i.e. This model was available between 1994 and 1996 and was part of the regularly available lineup; 1801 units were produced. 
From 1990 to 2014, a 1.0 litre version was sold as the Fiat Mille, as a budget entry-level model, and received its most recent facelift for the 2004 model year. A Fire engine was used since 2001. The 2005 Brazilian range has received a Flex Fuel system, enabling the car to use ethanol or gasoline as fuel, both pure or in any proportion mixture; also, there is a version fitted for unpaved roads called Mille Way, which includes higher and a more resilient suspension, larger wheels and side cladding.

Despite the launch of the new Brazilian-built Uno in 2010, production of the Mille Economy and Mille Way continued until January 2014
3, only with a 1.0 litre engine. The Uno Furgão van was a light commercial version of the three-door Uno hatchback with blinded rear windows and no rear seat. It and the Fiorino Furgão were available with a 1.25 litre Fire engine.

===== Engines =====
Petrol
==== India ====
After an abortive launch in 1996 when its CKD joint partner PAL delivered only 617 cars of the 30,000 ordered,
Fiat started its venture as a 50-50 Industrial Joint Venture between Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A. (Fiat) and Tata Motors Limited in January 1997. At present the company employs about 600 employees in its Ranjangaon facility in the Pune District of Maharashtra. The Uno was initially a success in India, but then it faded badly due to poor dealer support.

==== Morocco ====
The Fiat Uno was also assembled in Morocco until 2003 by SOMACA (Société Marocaine des Constructions Automobiles), and remains a popular choice of car for &quot;petit-taxi&quot; use.

==== Turkey ====
The Uno was first assembled in Turkey in 1994 and the production ran until 2000. Only the five-door bodystyle was assembled in Turkey. The engine options were 1.4, and 1.4 i.e. The fully equipped version was named Uno Hobby; it offered power steering and AC. It also differed from regular Unos in being available only in one colour option, sky blue with silver bumpers.

==== South Africa ====
In South Africa, the Uno was assembled under licence by Nissan from 1990 until 1998 and then by Fiat from 1998 up until 2006. Unos manufactured by Nissan had the word &quot;licence&quot; underneath the Fiat badge on the rear end and models included the 1,108 cc FIRE,1,372 cc PACER, PACER SX and 1,372 cc TURBO. Later on there were also a number of special editions produced which included the Beat (1,372 cc), the Rio (1,108 cc) and for a short period the Cento (999 cc). After Fiat re-entered the South African market in 1998 Unos were rebadged as either the (1,108 cc) Mia or (1,372 cc) Tempo. They also featured the Fiat centenary badge from that point on. By the time initial production of the Uno ended in 2006 only the (1,108 cc) Mia was available for sale. 110,000 units were produced between 1990 and 2002.

In 2007, the Fiat Uno was redesigned and it re-entered the South African new car market. The car was now marketed and distributed by Fiat themselves. The model line-up includes the Uno Way, which has a higher suspension than the regular Uno and colour-coded bumpers. It is based on the 1983–1990 design, and is powered by a 1.2 litre 4-cylinder petrol engine.

==== Philippines ====
Local manufacturer Francisco Motors, primarily known as a manufacturer of the Jeepney, partnered with Fiat to create a joint venture called Italcar Pilipinas Inc. in 1990. They assembled the Fiat Uno from 1992–2000 under the People&#x27;s Car Program, which was an incentive by the government of President Corazon Aquino to stimulate car production in the Philippines. The joint venture hoped to compete with the Toyota Corolla and Nissan Sentra with the Uno in the taxicab market, which accounted for many sales. The Uno was not popular and production decreased yearly until the venture was terminated in 2000.

==== Poland ====
Production in Fiat&#x27;s factory in Poland ran until 2002. 173,382 units were built from June 1995 to October 2002. It was imported in Italy as Innocenti Mille Clip.

==== Pakistan ====
The Fiat Uno is also assembled from complete knock down (CKD) kits in Pakistan by Raja Motor Company. Production started in 2001 and continued until 2004 when the manufacturing plant had to be closed down. Only the diesel variant of the car was made available under the 1.7D model. Although large scale manufacturing of the car has ceased, stocks of CKD are still being assembled and sold at present.

=== Sales performance ===

==== United Kingdom ====
Around 300,000 examples of the Uno were sold in Britain between 1983 and 1995, with the MK1 proving more popular than the MK2. It was one of the most popular imported cars in Britain during the 1980s, peaking at more than 40,000 sales in 1988. However, by March 2019 there were just 232 examples of either generation still in use.

==Second generation (2010)==


The Fiat Uno name was resurrected for project &quot;Type 327&quot;, the Brazilian-built &quot;Novo Uno&quot; (New Uno). The new Uno is engineered at Brazil and co-designed with Turin&#x27;s Centro Stile Fiat, and is basically a more urban interpretation of the Fiat Panda style on a Fiat Palio. It is larger and roomier than the first, but smaller and cheaper than the second.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.italiaspeed.com/2010/cars/fiat/04/uno_brazil&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The car has two options of engines: the 1.0 Fire Evo (74 hp) and the 1.4 Fire Evo (87 hp), both able to use ethanol, gasoline or a mix of both fuels.

It is being sold in Brazil and several other South American countries as well, but it has yet to be confirmed whether this Uno will be sold in Europe.

In December 2013, Fiat launched the new Uno-based Fiorino panel van (project &quot;Type 327&quot;), successor of the old Fiorino.

In September 2014, Fiat unveiled a facelift for the Uno and introduced the Start &amp; Stop system in the 1.4 Fire engine.

In 2016, Fiat launched another facelift for the Uno and introduced the Firefly engine, Available as a 1.0 or an 1.3 engine.

In 2018, Fiat removed the Way and Sporting trims and their versions with the GSR semi-automatic transmission, and added a new &quot;Drive&quot; version to be the new base model and only kept that and the &quot;Attractive&quot; version only with the 1.0 Firefly engine and in mid-2018 the Way version was brought back in with both 1.0 and 1.3 engines

In 2021 the model was no longer offered with the Firefly engine, it returned to the old 1.0 73/75 PS Fire Evo, only in the Attractive version. The Way, Sporting and Drive versions were discontinued. The model production ended at the end of this year with the Fiat Uno Ciao limited edition (250 units).

<doc id="478736" wikidata="Q12720207" url="?curid=478736" title="1996 Romanian general election">
<text>General elections were held in Romania on 3 November 1996, with a second round of the presidential election on 17 November.

Opinion polls prior to the elections suggested incumbent President Ion Iliescu of the Social Democracy Party of Romania (PDSR, formerly the Democratic National Salvation Front) would win a third term, though it was believed a large field of candidates would push him into a runoff. Iliescu received the most votes in the first round, just ahead of his 1992 run-off opponent, Emil Constantinescu of the Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR).

In the second round, Constantinescu defeated Iliescu with 54 percent of the vote. Iliescu conceded defeat soon after the polls closed. Constantinescu took office on 29 November, marking the first peaceful transfer of power since the fall of communism. To date, it is the only time since the introduction of direct presidential elections that an incumbent Romanian president has been defeated when running for re-election. The 1996 Romanian presidential election was the third of its kind held in post-1989 Romania.

The CDR, a broad coalition of parties opposing the governing centre-left PDSR, also emerged as the largest bloc in Parliament, winning 122 of the 343 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 53 of the 143 seats in the Senate.

<text>Astrakhan Oblast (; ) is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast) located in southern Russia. Its administrative center is the city of Astrakhan. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 1,010,073.

==Geography==
Astrakhan&#x27;s southern border is the Caspian Sea, eastern is Kazakhstan (Atyrau Region and West Kazakhstan Region), northern is Volgograd Oblast, and western is Kalmykia.

It is within the Russian Southern Federal District.

==History==

Since the Middle Ages, the territory has been ruled by Khazars, Cumania, the Mongol-Tatar Golden Horde, the Tatar Astrakhan Khanate, and Russia.

Astrakhan region is the homeland of the Buzhans, one of several Slavic tribes from which modern Russians evolved; they lived in Southern Russia and inhabited the area around the Buzan river.

In the 16th century, Indians began moving to the region, bringing Indian influence.

From August - December 1942, the German invaders reached the border of Astrakhansky Oblast, crossing into the region: the Abwehr from 1942 to 1943, Nazi Army stragglers 1941–44. Buzan oblast was created on 27 December 1943, on parts of the territories of the abolished Kalmyk ASSR and Astrakhan Okrug of Stalingrad Oblast.

===Project &quot;Vega&quot;===

From 8 October 1980 to 27 October 1984, and under the leadership of Nikolai Baibakov, the USSR held fifteen deep underground nuclear tests for Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy at the site &quot;Vega&quot; in the Ryn Desert in the east of the oblast less than 50 km from downtown Astrakhan to create reservoirs for natural gas storage. Because of the detonation depth (975 to 1,100 meters) and relatively low yield (3.2 to 13.5 kilotons), no radiation was released to the environment. These blasts had lower yields than the Project &quot;Sapphire&quot; blasts, which were 40 km south-southwest of Orenburg, to reduce any possible seismic destruction to nearby towns in the Volga delta including Astrakhan. At that time, the natural gas fields near Astrakhan, which are at a depth of 3900 to 4,100 meters, could contain as much as 6 trillion cubic meters, which is an amount similar to Urengoy. In 2017, the Astrakhanskoye field, which is an area of 100 km by 40 km in the middle of the Astrakhan arch and is 60 km northeast of Astrakhan, is the ninth largest in Russia and the largest in European Russia with an estimated gas in place of . The deposit is operated by Gazprom Dobycha Astrakhan which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Gazprom. The field produces large amounts of sulfur, too.

===Modern history===
On 30 October 1997, Astrakhan, alongside Kirov, Murmansk, Ulyanovsk, and Yaroslavl signed a power-sharing agreement with the government of Russia, granting it autonomy. The agreement would be abolished on 21 December 2001.

==Politics==
During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Astrakhan CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Astrakhan Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Astrakhan Oblast is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Administration, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

===Legislature===

The representative authority of the Astrakhan Oblast is the Duma of Astrakhan Oblast. Between 1994–2001, it was called the Astrakhan Regional Representative Assembly.

The Duma of Astrakhan Oblast has the following structure:
* Chairman of the Duma of Astrakhan Oblast;
* First Deputy Chairman of the Duma of Astrakhan Oblast;
* Deputy Chairman of the Duma of Astrakhan Oblast;
* Office of the Duma of Astrakhan Oblast;
* Committees and political factions.

Since 2006, the chairman of the regional legislative body has been the head of the regional branch of the United Russia party, Alexander Klykanov, whose candidacy was considered in 2009 for the post of governor of the Oblast. In 2016, Igor Martynov was elected Chairman of the Duma of Astrakhan Oblast of the sixth convocation.

===Executive===

The governor is the highest official of the Astrakhan Oblast and heads the executive branch.

Governors of Astrakhan Oblast:
* Anatoly Guzhvin — 1991–2004;
* Alexander Zhilkin — 2004–2018;
* Sergey Morozov — acting, 26 September 2018 — 5 June 2019;
* Igor Babushkin — 5 June 2019 — present.

From 1991 to 2004, Anatoly Guzhvin, who won elections in 1996 and 2000, was the governor of the Oblast. After Guzhvin&#x27;s death in August 2004, the early elections of the head of the Astrakhan Oblast on 5 December 2004 was won by the acting head of the region Alexander Zhilkin, enjoying the support of United Russia. The Governor supervises the work of the executive authorities of the region and the Government of the Astrakhan Oblast. From 2004 to 2017, Konstantin Markelov was the Chairman of the Government of the Astrakhan Oblast. Since 2017, Rasul Sultanov has been the Chairman of the Government of the Astrakhan Oblast.

<text>The Met Office Hadley Centre — named in honour of George Hadley — is one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s leading centres for the study of scientific issues associated with climate change. It is part of, and based at the headquarters of the Met Office in Exeter.

== Foundation ==

The Hadley Centre was founded in 1990, having been approved by the then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and was first named the Hadley Centre for Climate Research and Prediction but subsequently renamed on various occasions.

== Major aims ==

The centre has several major aims:

*To understand physical, chemical and biological processes within the climate system and develop state-of-the-art climate models
*To use climate models to simulate global and regional climate variability and change
*To predict inter-annual to decadal variability of climate 
*To predict long term climate change
*To monitor global and national climate variability and change
*To attribute recent changes in climate to specific factors

The 30th anniversary of the Hadley Centre was celebrated in 2020.

The Met Office employs over 1500 staff, with approximately 200 working in its climate research unit. Most of its funding comes from contracts with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), other United Kingdom Government departments and the European Commission. It also works closely with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) providing worldwide climate forecasting and predictions.

The climate model (HadGEM) developed by the centre is used for climate change research purposes across the world. It covers both Ocean modelling and Atmospheric Modelling. Collecting data from across the world.

==Research projects based on Hadley Centre climate models==

The UK Climate Prediction Project uses the Hadley Centre climate model projections of future UK climate to inform UK government policy.

The Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the Korean Meteorological Agency use the Hadley Centre GloSea5 system for long range prediction.

The volunteer computing project ClimatePrediction.net is a research team based at the University of Oxford conducting research into global climate change using adapted versions of the climate models developed at the Hadley Centre. Individuals can participate in the research efforts by donating spare computer resources to aid their research.

The PRECIS (Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies) project enables scientists from the around the globe to run a regional climate model towards carrying out research into climate change.

<text>Volgograd Oblast () is a federal subject (an oblast) of Russia, located in the lower Volga region of Southern Russia. Its administrative center is Volgograd. The population of the oblast was 2,500,781 in the 2021 Census. 

Formerly known as Stalingrad Oblast, it was given its present name in 1961, when the city of Stalingrad was renamed Volgograd as part of de-Stalinization. Volgograd Oblast borders Rostov Oblast in the southwest, Voronezh Oblast in the northwest, Saratov Oblast in the north, Astrakhan Oblast and the Republic of Kalmykia in the southeast, and has an international border with Kazakhstan in the east. The two main rivers in European Russia, the Don and the Volga, run through the oblast and are connected by the Volga–Don Canal. Volgograd Oblast&#x27;s strategic waterways have made it a popular route for shipping and for the generation of hydroelectricity.

Volgograd Oblast was the primary site of the Battle of Stalingrad during World War II, regarded as the single bloodiest battle in the history of warfare.

==Geography==
*Borders length: 

Volgograd Oblast borders with Saratov, Rostov, Astrakhan, and Voronezh Oblasts, as well as with Kalmykia of Russia and with Kazakhstan (West Kazakhstan Region). 
Most of Volgograd oblast is located in the Pontic–Caspian steppe. The Yergeni hills are located to the southeast. Forests cover 4% of the territory.
The major rivers are:
*The Volga River
*The Don River
*The Medveditsa River
*The Khopyor River

==History==
Since the Middle Ages, the territory was ruled by Khazars, Cumania, the Golden Horde and Russia.

Stalingrad Oblast () was established on December 5, 1936 on the territory of former Stalingrad Krai. It was the scene of the Battle of Stalingrad during World War II in 1942–1943. The oblast was given its present name on November 10, 1961.

==Administrative divisions==
==Politics==
During the Soviet period, three people exercised oblast-level authority:
#the first secretary of the Volgograd CPSU Committee (who in reality had the most power)
#the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power)
#the chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power)

In 1991 the CPSU lost &quot;de facto&quot; power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Volgograd Oblast provides the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Volgograd Oblast is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body, the Oblast Government, includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day-to-day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor, who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

==Demographics==

The population of the oblast was 2,500,781 according to the 2021 Russian census, 2,610,161 in the 2010 Russian census, 2,699,223 in the 2002 Russian census, and 2,593,944 in the 1989 Soviet census. 

Vital statistics for 2024:
*Births: 16,051 (6.6 per 1,000)
*Deaths: 32,460 (13.3 per 1,000)

Total fertility rate (2024):
1.12 children per woman

Life expectancy (2021): 
Total — 69.96 years (male — 65.70, female — 74.14)

===Settlements===
=== Ethnic groups ===
*44,541 people were registered from administrative databases, and could not declare an ethnicity. It is estimated that the proportion of ethnicities in this group is the same as that of the declared group.

===Religion===
According to a 2012 survey, 54.5% of the population of Volgograd Oblast adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, 4% are unaffiliated generic Christians, 2% are Eastern Orthodox Christian believers who don&#x27;t belong to any church or are members of non-Russian Eastern Orthodox churches, and 3% are Muslims. In addition, 18% of the population declares to be &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;, 12% is atheist, and 6.5% follows other religions or did not give an answer to the question.
==Government==
Governor of Volgograd Oblast is Андрей Бочаров (since 2014)

Both the flag and the coat of arms of Volgograd Oblast include an image of &quot;The Motherland Calls&quot;, an 85 meter tall statue located in Volgograd.

==Economy==

Primary branches of economics are agriculture, food production, heavy industry, gas and petroleum refining. The Volga Hydroelectric Station operates on the Volga River.

The largest companies in the region include Volzhsky Pipe Plant, Volgogradenergosbyt (a local electric power distribution company), OJSC Kaustik (caustic soda manufacturer), Volzhsky Orgsintez (a chemical plant).

<doc id="478750" wikidata="Q850484" url="?curid=478750" title="ChucK">
<text>ChucK is a concurrent, strongly timed audio programming language for real-time synthesis, composition, and performance,
which runs on Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, and iOS. It is designed to favor readability and flexibility for the programmer over other considerations such as raw performance. It natively supports deterministic concurrency and multiple, simultaneous, dynamic control rates. Another key feature is the ability to live code; adding, removing, and modifying code on the fly, while the program is running, without stopping or restarting. It has a highly precise timing/concurrency model, allowing for arbitrarily fine granularity. It offers composers and researchers a powerful and flexible programming tool for building and experimenting with complex audio synthesis programs, and real-time interactive control.

ChucK was created and chiefly designed by Ge Wang as a graduate student working with Perry R. Cook. ChucK is distributed freely under the terms of the GNU General Public License on Mac OS X, Linux and Microsoft Windows. On iPhone and iPad, ChiP (ChucK for iPhone) is distributed under a limited, closed source license, and is not currently licensed to the public. However, the core team has stated that it would like to explore &quot;ways to open ChiP by creating a beneficial environment for everyone&quot;.

== Language features ==
The ChucK programming language is a loosely C-like object-oriented language, with strong static typing.

ChucK is distinguished by the following characteristics:

* Direct support for real-time audio synthesis
* A powerful and simple concurrent programming model
* A unified timing mechanism for multi-rate event and control processing.
* A language syntax that encourages left-to-right syntax and semantics within program statements.
* Precision timing: a strongly timed sample-synchronous timing model.
* Programs are dynamically compiled to ChucK virtual machine bytecode.
* A runtime environment that supports on-the-fly programming.
*The ChucK Operator (=&gt;) that can be used in several ways to &quot;chuck&quot; any ordered flow of data from left to right.

ChucK standard libraries provide:

* MIDI input and output.
* Open Sound Control support.
*HID connectivity.
*Unit generators (UGens) - ie oscillators, envelopes, synthesis toolkit ugens, filters, etc.
*Unit analyzers (UAnae) - blocks that perform analysis functions on audio signals and/or metadata input, and produce metadata analysis results as output - ie FFT/IFFT, Spectral Flux/Centroid, RMS, etc.
*Serial IO capabilities - ie Arduino.
*File IO capabilities.

== Code example ==
The following is a simple ChucK program that generates sound and music:

 // signal graph (patch)
 SinOsc s =&gt; JCRev r =&gt; dac;
 .2 =&gt; s.gain;
 // dry/wet mix (for reverb)
 .1 =&gt; r.mix;
 // an array of pitch classes (semitones)
 [ 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11 ] @=&gt; int hi[];
 // do forever:
 while( true )
 // choose a note, shift registers, convert to frequency
 Std.mtof( 45 + Std.rand2(0,3) * 12 +
 hi[Std.rand2(0,hi.cap()-1)] ) =&gt; s.freq;
 // advance time
 120::ms =&gt; now;

== Uses ==
ChucK has been used in performances by the Princeton Laptop Orchestra (PLOrk) and for developing Smule applications, including their ocarina emulator. PLOrk organizers attribute some of the uniqueness of their performances to the live coding they can perform with ChucK.

<doc id="478756" wikidata="Q580241" url="?curid=478756" title="Salaryman">
<text>is an originally Japanese word for salaried workers. In Japanese popular culture, it is portrayed as a white-collar worker who shows unwavering loyalty and commitment to his employer, prioritizing work over everything else in their life often at the expense of their family. &quot;Salarymen&quot; are expected to work long hours, whether overtime is paid or not. They socialize with colleagues and bosses, including singing karaoke, drinking, and visiting hostess bars.

&quot;Salarymen&quot; typically enter a company after graduating from college and stay with that corporation for the duration of their career. In conservative Japanese culture, becoming a salaryman is a typical career choice for young men and women, as parents map out their child&#x27;s education path in order to make sure they can attend a prestigious university which in turn will lead to recruitment by a major company. Those who do not take this career path are regarded as living with a stigma and less prestige. On the other hand, the word &quot;salaryman&quot; is sometimes used with derogatory connotation for his total dependence on his employer and lack of individuality. Other popular concepts surrounding salarymen include karōshi, or death from overwork.

==History==
The word &quot;&quot; is often described as a &quot;wasei-eigo&quot;, a Japanese formation from English loanwords, but it appears instead to be a straight borrowing from the English phrase &quot;salaried man&quot;, which predates the Japanese term by nearly a century. The Japanese term saw widespread use by 1930, even before government expansion and militarization drove the growth of white-collar employment. The term does not include all workers who receive a set salary, but only &quot;white-collar workers in the large bureaucracy of a business firm or government office.&quot; The term includes those who work for government (e.g., bureaucrats) and major companies (e.g., those listed in Nikkei 225). Workers in the mizu shōbai (nightlife) and entertainment industries (including actors, singers, musicians, artists) are not included even though their income may be salary based. Similarly, doctors, lawyers, politicians, freelancers and corporate executives (the C-suite, board of directors) are also excluded. Engineers and accountants who have their own firm/practice are not included as well.

==Description==
A typical description of the salaryman is a male white-collar employee who typically earns his salary &quot;based on individual abilities rather than on seniority.&quot; Companies typically hire the salarymen straight out of high school, and they are expected to stay with the company until retirement, around the ages of 55 or 60. As a reward for their loyalty, companies rarely fire the salarymen (see below for the Madogiwa Zoku or “the window tribe”) except in special &quot;dire&quot; circumstances. 

Once a salaryman reaches age 30, they are typically promoted to their first supervisor role (Kacho), overseeing new hires who are younger than them. Traditional Japanese companies do not allow employees to supervise people who are older than themselves due to &quot;respect&quot;. At age 40 they would become a department head (Bacho), and between 40 and 50 they would be promoted to senior management (although these posts are still considered middle management, below the top executives/directors). They retire between the ages of 55 to 65.

Underperforming employees in the over 40 age bracket are sidelined with some of their responsibilities taken away, although they do not formally receive a pay cut nor a demotion (Madogiwa Zoku or “the window tribe”). Haruo Shimada, a professor at Keio University, states that &quot;It&#x27;s important to treat madogiwa-zoku well, because many young people think about their future in terms of the way these older people are treated&quot;, in line with business orientation where employees are expected to show loyalty to their companies and be shown loyalty in return. In other words, no-longer-productive employees were kept around to raise the morale of productive employees, since the young and productive would be able to look forward to the day in which they, too, could sit by the window and collect a salary for doing nothing.

Salarymen are known for working long hours, sometimes over eighty hours per week. Often, because of his busy work schedule, the salaryman does not have time to raise a family and his work becomes a lifelong commitment. There is also a belief that the &quot;amount of time spent at the workplace correlates to the perceived efficiency of the employee.&quot; As a result of this intense work-driven lifestyle, salarymen may be more likely to suffer from mental or physical health problems, including heart failure, or to commit suicide.

A salaryman&#x27;s typical outfit consists of a dark suit, a white shirt, and a simple tie in neutral colors like navy, black, or gray. Dressing in such a manner is not only part of professionalism, but also following the cultural emphasis on group harmony where dress uniformity shows everyone belongs to a team, as opposed to standing out which is often seen as potentially disruptive to this harmony. Companies often have specific dress codes, and employees follow these guidelines as part of their role. While companies often take part in the Cool Biz initiative which encourages workers to wear lighter clothing (short-sleeved shirts instead of long ones) during the hot months to reduce air conditioning use, Japanese salarymen still retain a clean and professional look, in contrast to Western business casual which permits khakis or jeans with polo shirts.

In Japan, hotel chains created business hotels to cater to salarymen for work-related travel. Similar to economy and limited service hotels in North America, Japanese business hotels provide small but efficient rooms at a reasonable price, without all the frills and facilities of luxury/international class hotels. Business hotels typically do not have banquet halls, conference rooms, swimming pool nor exercise room, although they may have an onsite restaurant offering breakfast and late-night ramen, while some establishments come with an onsen.

== Social image ==
The prevalence of salarymen in Japanese society has given birth to many depictions by both the Japanese and American media. Some films in Japan about salarymen include &quot;Mr. Salaryman&quot;, &quot;Japanese Salaryman NEO&quot; (based on the TV series), and a drama series entitled &quot;History of a Salaryman&quot;. There is a certain expectation among the middle and upper classes for Japanese people to become salarymen. For many young Japanese men and women, accepting anything less than becoming a salaryman and conforming to its ideal is considered a failure, not only of him or her, but also of their parents.

The life of a salaryman revolves around work. The activities that he or she does outside of his or her working hours typically involve his or her coworkers, which lessens the distance between him or her and work. Due to this expectation, there have been a variety of derogatory names given to salarymen: (&quot;shachiku&quot;, literally &quot;corporate livestock&quot; in reference to wage slavery), (&quot;kaisha no inu&quot; or &quot;company&#x27;s dog&quot;), and (&quot;kigyou senshi&quot; or &quot;corporate soldier&quot;), to ridicule salarymen.

===Entertainment===
Changing social circumstances have greatly diversified the life of the salaryman outside of work. Though the importance of social drinking has not declined, its image has changed over time from mass partying during the economic bubble to conservative consumption at home after the collapse of the economy during the 1990s. Mahjong was an immensely popular game among the 1960s generation of salarymen, who brought the game into company circles directly from high school and college groups. The 1970s generation saw a gradual decrease in the number of avid mahjong players, and by the 1980s, it became common not to show any interest at it at all.

Golf became widely popular during the economic bubble, when golf club passes became useful tools for currying favor with corporate executives. Many mid-level salarymen were pressured into taking up golf to participate in golfing events with their superiors. The collapse of the economic bubble led to the closing of many golf courses, and playing golf with executives has become increasingly rare. However, some current salarymen may have golfing experience from their student days, and golf is still acknowledged as an expensive hobby for salarymen.

==Karōshi==
Extreme pressure on salarymen can lead to death by overwork, or &quot;karōshi&quot;. Salarymen feel intense pressure to fulfill their duty to support their family because of the gendered expectations placed on men. According to a &quot;Washington Post&quot; article, the Japanese government struggled for years to pass a law limiting to the number of hours one can work, and the issue has been prevalent since the 1970s. In 2014, after 30 years of activism, Japan&#x27;s parliament (the Japanese Diet) passed a law &quot;promoting countermeasures against karōshi.&quot;

However, many Japanese still criticize the government and believe there should be some form of punishment for companies that violate work hour laws. Approximately 2,000 annual applications are filed by the families of salarymen that die of karōshi. However, the death toll may be much higher, and &quot;as many as 8,000 of the 30,000 annual suicides each year are thought to be work-related,&quot; with &quot;as many as 10,000 non-suicide karōshi deaths per year.&quot;

Karōshi, literally &quot;overwork death,&quot; was first diagnosed as a &quot;circulatory disease brought on by stress&quot; in the late 1970s after the 1973 oil crisis, which took a toll on the post-war reconstruction of Japanese industry. Since then, the number of deaths from overwork has increased, especially at larger and more prestigious companies. In 2002, Kenichi Uchino, a 30-year-old quality-control manager at Toyota, collapsed and died after working over 80 hours unpaid overtime for six months. After this incident, Toyota announced that it would begin monitoring their workers&#x27; health and would pay for all of their overtime hours.

<text>Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) is a standard experimental protocol for global atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). It provides a community-based infrastructure in support of climate model diagnosis, validation, intercomparison, documentation and data access. Virtually the entire international climate modeling community has participated in this project since its inception in 1990.

AMIP is endorsed by the Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE) of the World Climate Research Programme, and is managed by the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison with the guidance of the WGNE AMIP Panel.

The AMIP experiment itself is simple by design; an AGCM is constrained by realistic sea surface temperature and sea ice from 1979 to near present, with a comprehensive set of fields saved for diagnostic research.

This model configuration removes the added complexity of ocean-atmosphere feedbacks in the climate system. It is not meant to be used for climate change prediction, an endeavor that requires a coupled atmosphere-ocean model (e.g., see AMIP&#x27;s sister project CMIP).

<text>The Evolutionary Air and space Global Laser Engagement (EAGLE) is a missile defence plan being developed by the United States Air Force. It is a &quot;space-based weapon&quot;.

The project is a combination of two separate missile defense efforts: the Aerospace Relay Mirror System and a new, high-altitude airship. The project is designed as a means to destroy enemy missiles before they would have the opportunity to hit targets on American soil. It involves using either ground-based, air-based or space-based lasers deflected off a massive airship (roughly 25 times the size of the Goodyear blimp) covered in mirrors that could destroy missiles but also satellites or spacecraft in a low Earth orbit. By synergistically employing airborne, terrestrial, or space-based lasers in conjunction with space-based relay mirrors, this innovative approach substantially enhances the capabilities of both the Airborne Laser and Ground-Based Laser. The system effectively projects varying laser powers and frequencies, enabling a wide array of effects, ranging from illumination to destruction.

The first tests of the airship were scheduled to begin in 2006. Its current status as of 2011 is unknown.

<text>Elista (, ; , &quot;Elst&quot;, ) is the capital city of the Republic of Kalmykia, Russia.

It was known as Stepnoy (Степно́й) from 1944 to 1957.

==History==
Elista was founded in 1865 as a small settlement, the name is from Kalmyk &quot;els(e)n&quot; &#x27;sand(y)&#x27;. In November 1920, Elista became the administrative center of the Kalmyk Autonomous Oblast. By the early 1930s, Elista was transformed into a small city as the collectivization policies of Joseph Stalin forced many Kalmyks to abandon their traditional pastoral nomadic lifestyle in exchange for a modern, sedentary, and urban lifestyle. In October 1935, Elista was recognized as the capital of the Kalmyk ASSR.
In late 1942, the city was briefly occupied by the German army. Because of alleged collaboration between the ethnic Kalmyks and the Germans, on December 27, 1943, the Kalmyk ASSR was dissolved and its ethnic Kalmyk residents were forcibly exiled to Siberia. Russian people were brought in to repopulate Elista, whose name was changed to Stepnoy (). It was called Stepnoy until 1957, when the survivors of the deportations were allowed to return from exile.

Some western tourists started to visit Elista from the mid-1990s, and more after it received publicity as the host city of the 1998 Chess Olympiad. The city is safe and has little traffic. On the outskirts of Elista, there are vast grasslands.

==Geography==
The city is located in the area of the Yergeni hills, in the upper part of the Elista valley. The sources of the river are located in the western part of the city. The Elista crosses the urban area from west to east, dividing it into two sections, a larger northern part and a smaller southern one.

===Climate===

Elista has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa&quot;), although it has sometimes been described as a temperate semi-arid climate (Köppen classification &quot;BSk&quot;). Winters are cold with a January average high of while summers are hot with a July average high of . The average annual precipitation is with winters being drier than summers. Record temperatures range from in January 1935 to in July 2011.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Elista is the capital of the republic. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with four rural localities, incorporated as the City of Elista—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Elista is incorporated as Elista Urban Okrug.

==Features==
Since 1991, the town has been characterized by the slow decay of Soviet-built institutions, and the large construction projects instigated by the republic&#x27;s millionaire president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov.

The town center has a number of renovated public parks focused on the main square, boasting statues to both Lenin and the Buddha. To the east of the town lies the Olympic village of the 1998 XXXIII Chess Olympiad, known locally as &quot;City-Chess&quot;. The site has a public swimming pool and a museum of Kalmyk Buddhist art, which is also infrequently used as a conference center.

During his visit in 1998, the 14th Dalai Lama chose a location west of the town center to build the Burkhan Bakshin Altan Sume, a Buddhist temple for city residents. It was opened in December 2005. It is the largest Buddhist temple in Europe.

==Transportation==
Elista has a small regional airport which is open daily during the week, providing flights to Moscow and various cities in the southern part of the Russian Federation. The airport was closed by the federal aviation authorities sometime in the fall of 2006, but was reopened sometime in 2007. Rail connections are available to Stavropol.

Due to the high cost of air travel, people usually prefer to take the bus between Elista and Moscow. The trip is approximately 18 hours and makes several rest stops along the route. Nowadays there is an airline, Azimuth, that provides air flights to Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Sochi, Crimea and Rostov on Don at affordable cost with direct flights from Elista airport. The price starts at 2500 rubles one way and it saves traveler a lot of time instead of traveling by bus as it was in the past.

Within Elista itself, a network of about a dozen &quot;marshrutka&quot; (minibus) routes is run by private companies. Minibuses are available around every five minutes. This is the preferred option of most Kalmykians because of the minimal cost (10 rubles).

==Demographics==
Population:&lt;br&gt;

Ethnic composition (2021):
* Kalmyks – 76.9%
* Russians – 19.1%
* Kazakhs – 0.6%
* Others – 3.4%

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Elista is twinned with:

* Aktau, Kazakhstan
* Khoni, Georgia
* Kyzyl, Russia
* Lhasa, China
* Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia
* Ulan-Ude, Russia

== Sport ==
Typhoon Elista were a motorcycle speedway team who regularly participated in the Soviet Union Championship from 15 April 1967 through to 1991. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the team disbanded. The team raced at the Elista Motordrome or Avtodrom located at ().

Elista was previously home to a top tier football team. Uralan Elista played in the Russian Premier League from 1997 until 2000, and then 2001 until 2003 when the team was dissolved. The team have been re-created multiple times since, sometimes known as FC Elista, although always at an amateur level.

<text>The Grand River (Ottawa: owashtanong, &quot;Far-Flowing Water&quot;) is a river in the Lower Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. The longest river in Michigan, the Grand River rises in Hillsdale County, and flows in a generally northwesterly direction to its mouth at Lake Michigan in the city of Grand Haven. The river flows through a number of cities, including Jackson, Lansing, Ionia, and Grand Rapids.

The river was famous for its mile-long, 300-yard-wide, and 10-to-15-foot-tall rapids, for which the city of Grand Rapids was named. These rapids were submerged following the construction of numerous dams, starting in 1835, and flooding of areas behind the dams. The river has not had any rapids for nearly a century.

==Course==

The headwaters of the Grand River begin from natural springs in Somerset Township in Hillsdale County near the boundary with Liberty Township in Jackson County. From there, the river flows through Jackson, Ingham, Eaton, Clinton, Ionia, Kent, and Ottawa counties before emptying into Lake Michigan. The river runs through the cities of Jackson, Eaton Rapids, Dimondale, Lansing, Grand Ledge, Portland, Ionia, Lowell, Grand Rapids, and Grand Haven.

==Hydrology==
The Grand River is a major tributary of Lake Michigan. It falls in elevation from 1260 ft. in the highlands of its headwaters to 577 ft. at its mouth on Lake Michigan. Its waters drain northward through the lake, then south and east through the Great Lakes waterways into the St. Lawrence River, which flows northeasterly into the Gulf of St. Lawrence on the Atlantic Ocean. The Grand River discharges an estimated average .

Its watershed is the second-largest in the state, draining an area of , including 18 counties and 158 townships. Much of the basin is flat, and it contains many swamps and lakes. The basin is composed of four sub-basins: Upper Grand, Lower Grand, Thornapple, and Maple, where the four major tributaries flow: the Flat, Rogue, Thornapple, and Maple rivers.

Tributaries of the river include (beginning near river source and travelling downstream): Portage River, Red Cedar River, Looking Glass River, Maple River, Prairie Creek, Bellamy Creek, Flat River, Thornapple River, Rogue River, Coldbrook Creek, Plaster Creek, Bass River, Buck Creek and Crockery Creek.

===Dams===
There are fourteen dams on the main branch of the Grand River. Some 218 dams were built on its tributaries; these have divided the ecosystem into a set of dysfunctional local streams. 228 of these dams are registered with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.

The main branch dams are:

lower
*Grand River (6th Street)
*Grand River

middle
*Lyons (removed in 2016)
*Grand Ledge
*Portland
*North Lansing
*Moores Park
*Webber (hydroelectric)

upper
*State Street
*Moore&#x27;s Park (hydroelectric)
*Sanitation
*Smithville (hydroelectric)

headwaters
*Liberty Mills
*Crystal Lake
*Mirror Lake
*Lake LeAnn North
*Lake LeAnn South

==Ecology==
It is estimated that 22% of the pesticide usage in the Lake Michigan watershed occurs in the Grand River drainage, which accounts for only 13% of the lake&#x27;s total watershed. The river is a trout and salmon stream for much of its length.

==History==
As the glacial ice receded from what is the central Lower Peninsula of Michigan around 11,000 years ago, the Maple River and lower Grand River served as a drainage channel for the meltwater. The channel ran east to west, emptying into proglacial Lake Chicago, the ancestor of Lake Michigan.

About 2,000 years ago, the Hopewell Indians settled along the Grand River near present-day Grandville. Their presence is still seen in the preserved burial mounds.

By the late 17th century, the Grand River band of Odawa had established villages on the banks of the Grand River at the sites of what would later become several towns and cities, including Grand Rapids, Forest Hills, Lowell, Lyons, and Portland. For these peoples, as well as for later explorers, fur traders and settlers, the river served as an important navigational trade route and cultural hub.

The river formed part of a major demarcation of land ceded by Native Americans enabling U.S. settlers to legally obtain title to land in the area. In the 1821 Treaty of Chicago, the Odawa, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi ceded to the United States all lands in Michigan Territory south of the Grand River, with the exception of several small reservations.

The city of Grand Rapids was built starting in 1826 on the site of a mile long rapids 40 miles upstream from the river&#x27;s mouth, although these disappeared after the installation of a run-of-river dam in 1866 and five low-rise dams during a river beautification project in 1927.

The Grand was important to the rapid development of West-Central Michigan during the 1850s to 1880s, as logs from Michigan&#x27;s rich pine and oak forests floated down the Grand River for milling. After the Civil War, many soldiers found jobs as lumberjacks cutting logs and guiding them down the river with pike poles, peaveys, and cant hooks. The men wore bright red flannel, felt clothes, and spiked boots to hold them onto the floating logs; these boots chewed up the wooden sidewalks and flooring of the local bars, leading one hotel owner to supply carpet slippers to all river drivers who entered his hotel. The &quot;jacks&quot; earned $1 to $3 per day and all the &quot;vittles&quot; they could eat, which was usually a considerable amount.

In 1883, heavy rains during June and July brought water levels on the river to record highs. The flooding was bad enough, but the rising water overwhelmed lumbering booms—river enclosures used to sort and organize logs for transport to saw mills—in Lowell, Grand Rapids as well as Grand Haven and Robinson townships. As water rose, the logs escaped the enclosures, much like cattle fleeing stockyards. Soon, Kent and Ottawa counties had a &#x27;stampede&#x27;, as millions of logs flowed uncontrolled down the river and became trapped in bends or against bridges. The result was a logjam of incredible proportions that clogged the river for 47 miles (10 million Feet of logs trapped in Lowell, 95 million Feet of logs trapped in the &quot;Big Bend&quot; northeast of Grand Rapids, 80 million Feet of logs trapped in Ottawa County).

Grand River Avenue (or Grand River Road) was built early in the settlement of Michigan and ran from the head of navigation on the Grand to downtown Detroit. It formed an important part of an early route between Chicago and Detroit, along with the Grand itself, from Grand Rapids to Grand Haven on Lake Michigan.

A fish ladder installed in 1974 replaced the West Side Water Power Canal headgates removed in 1960. In recent years, Grand Rapids Whitewater, a private nonprofit organization, is working toward restoring the rapids to the river in Grand Rapids. The project, which began in 2019, will remove five dams between Sixth street and Pearl street to restore an 18-foot drop in the Grand River&#x27;s elevation.

==Points of interest==
Two of Grand Valley State University&#x27;s campuses are located on the banks of the Grand River. The main campus in Allendale and the Pew Grand Rapids campus in Grand Rapids both border the river in separate locations miles from each other. The Grand is home to GVSU&#x27;s rowing team, and the crew boathouse sits parallel to the river on the Allendale campus&#x27;s north side.

Coast Guard Station Grand Haven is situated near the mouth of the river in Grand Haven. The station gives Grand Haven its nickname &quot;Coast Guard City USA&quot;.

===Parks, docks and recreational facilities===
*Millennium Park (Grand Rapids), the largest park in western Michigan, larger than Central Park, NY

==Crossings==
At least 80 bridges cross the river&#x27;s 250-mile span, with most bridge structures clustered in metropolitan/municipal areas along the river. County road and state highway crossings can be found in less densely populated areas along the waterway:

<text>The World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) is an international programme that helps to coordinate global climate research. The WCRP was established in 1980, under the joint sponsorship of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the International Council for Science (ICSU), and has also been sponsored by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO since 1993.

The programme is funded by its three sponsors and additional contributions by nation states or other donors. WCRP uses these funds to organize science workshops or conferences and support collaboration between climate scientists at an international level. Its expert groups also develop international standards for climate data and propose future emphasis areas in international climate research, among others.

== History ==
The World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) came into existence in 1980, with the International Science Council (ISC)—known as the International Council for Science (ICSU) until its reorganization in July 2018—and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) acting as its founding sponsors. The sponsorship circle widened in 1993 when the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO joined as a sponsor.

Over a span of more than 40 years, the WCRP has been instrumental in propelling the advancement of climate science. It has fostered the ability of climate scientists to monitor, simulate, and forecast the global climate with unparalleled accuracy. This has led to the provision of essential climate information that aids policy and decision-making, as well as supports various practical applications for end-users across multiple sectors. The significance of the WCRP&#x27;s contributions is documented in celebratory publications such as the &quot;25th Anniversary Brochure,&quot; the &quot;WCRP Film: 40 years of international climate science,&quot; and articles like &quot;The World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) celebrates its 40th anniversary.&quot;

== Mandate ==

WCRP&#x27;s objective is stated as &quot;a better understanding of the climate system and the causes of climate variability and change&quot; and &quot;to determine the predictability of climate; and to determine the effect of human activities on climate&quot;. In practice, the programme aims to foster initiatives in climate research which require or benefit from international coordination and which are unlikely to emerge from national efforts alone. The programme does not fund climate research directly, but may at times exchange views with research funding agencies on global research priorities.

== Structure ==

The largest group of contributors to WCRP are several thousands of climate scientists from around the world who offer their expertise and time as volunteers to, for example, help organize workshops in key areas of research, lay out avenues for future research in white paper articles, and serve on WCRP science or advisory boards. Official scientific guidance for the programme is provided by a Joint Scientific Committee (JSC) consisting of 18 volunteer scientists selected by mutual agreement between the three sponsoring organizations. Everyday operations are supported by a secretariat of around 8 full-time staff, hosted by the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva.

== Activities and projects ==

WCRP&#x27;s largest activities are its four &quot;Core Projects&quot; (called SPARC, CLIVAR, CliC, and GEWEX), which support climate research on the global atmosphere, oceans, the cryosphere, and the land surface (together constituting the Earth&#x27;s physical climate system) as well as interactions and exchanges between them. Each Core Project again has a structure similar to that of WCRP itself, namely contributing scientists, a scientific steering group, and a secretariat (&quot;international project office&quot;) hosted by individual countries.

The programme further maintains topical working groups and advisory councils on climate data, climate modelling, subseasonal-to-decadal climate prediction, and regional climate modelling. Additional &quot;Grand Challenges&quot; target specific questions of societal interest within climate science.

One particular output by a WCRP task team is the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, which standardizes and coordinates regular comparisons of the world&#x27;s climate models and which provides an important basis for the IPCC Assessment Reports&#x27; climate projections.

===Stratospheric Processes And their Role in Climate===
Stratosphere-troposphere Processes and their Role in Climate (SPARC) is a core project of the programme. Founded in 1992, SPARC has coordinated high-level research activities related to understanding Earth system processes for over two decades. More specifically, SPARC promotes and facilitates cutting-edge international research activities on how chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere interact with climate and climate change.

<doc id="478779" wikidata="Q4279948" url="?curid=478779" title="Red Cedar River (Michigan)">
<text>The Red Cedar River is a river in the U.S. state of Michigan. The river, which is a tributary of the Grand River in Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula, drains a watershed of approximately in the Lansing–East Lansing metropolitan area and suburban and rural areas to the east. The river flows through the campus of Michigan State University, and is considered a cultural symbol of the school, including being mentioned in the school&#x27;s fight song.

== Name ==
The river was presumably named for the juniper species &quot;Juniperus virginiana,&quot; commonly known as red cedar, a plant native to the region. Prior to a 1966 decision by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, the river was shown as Cedar River on federal maps, despite being known as the Red Cedar River locally. The board&#x27;s review was prompted by a 1962 letter from Milton P. Adams, then-secretary of the Michigan Water Resources Commission, who noted in his letter that &quot;generations of M.S.U. students have solemnly and with hearts full sung the glories of their Alma Mater &#x27;on the banks of the Red Cedar.&#x27; Countless great careers have been launched, lifelong romances have budded, and strong characters have been wrought in these environs, presumably on the banks of the &#x27;Red&#x27; Cedar.

== Course ==
The river&#x27;s source is Cedar Lake in Marion Township in southern Livingston County. It flows for , first northwestward through Fowlerville, then westward through northern Ingham County. In Ingham County it flows through Williamston, Okemos, East Lansing, and finally Lansing, where it empties into the Grand River. In East Lansing the river passes through the campus of Michigan State University.

The river is not navigable by boats larger than recreational size.

== Watershed ==
The river&#x27;s watershed is approximately in size. Among the river&#x27;s larger tributaries, ordered from its mouth to its source, are Sycamore Creek, Pine Lake Outlet (the outflow of Lake Lansing), Sloan Creek, Deer Creek, Doan Creek, Kalamink Creek, the West Branch Red Cedar River, and the Middle Branch Red Cedar River. The Red Cedar River Watershed (RCRW) contains a diverse mix of rural lands dominated by agricultural land use and small communities, suburban areas, and highly urbanized lands. The watershed is home to thousands of residents who live, learn, work, and recreate within its lands and waters. Farms, factories, and shopping malls are necessary for quality of life. Equally important are clean water for fishing, swimming, and drinking, and natural landscapes for aesthetic relief. The river and its watershed are also home for a myriad of plants and animals that rely on a clean, protected environment to flourish.

==Water quality==

Since the national Clean Water Act in 1972, the river has greatly improved and is safe for swimming 74% of the year (the exception usually being right after heavy rains which bring higher levels of &quot;E. coli&quot; from runoff waters). The Red Cedar is regularly monitored by MSU Water with the contaminant reports posted by the Michigan State University International Center. Despite these improvements, littering and pollution into the river and onto its banks is a common problem and includes bikes, parking barricades, general trash, and occasionally large items such as car tires and mopeds. To combat this problem, twice per year the undergraduate MSU Fisheries and Wildlife club holds a &quot;Red Cedar Clean-Up&quot; event that brings students, faculty, alumni, and community members together to remove and recycle items found in the river and its banks.

==Michigan State University campus==
The Red Cedar River is a familiar campus landmark at Michigan State University. The name of the river is featured in the first line of MSU&#x27;s fight song, and MSU students can be found studying in the parkland along its banks. A number of student activities centered around the Red Cedar over the course of MSU&#x27;s history, including freshman vs. sophomore &quot;tug-o-war&quot; spanning the river and a Water Carnival featuring student made floats drifting in procession. People on campus frequently feed the large community of mallard ducks that congregate near the river.

Alongside the river on MSU&#x27;s campus is the W.J. Beal Botanical Garden, the oldest continuous botanical garden in the United States. The garden was started in 1873.

The river is popular in the summer for canoeing and kayaking. (The campus canoe dock is self-mockingly named Red Cedar Yacht Club.) During floods, the river forms a standing wave at the campus dam that can be surfed. In the winter, the river often freezes over and students walk or play on the ice despite the inherent danger. During its inaugural season in 1922, the MSU hockey team played games on the frozen river.

Fishing was banned on the campus in the 1960s; the ban was rescinded for a section of the river in 2013. Wildlife in the river includes 33 species of fish and various other aquatic animals, and study of the river and its ecosystem is incorporated into relevant areas of the university&#x27;s curricula. From December 1979 to 1981, Dr. Patrick M. Muzzall from MSU&#x27;s zoology department collected the following species: white sucker, northern hog sucker, spotted sucker, golden redhorse, silver redhorse, rock bass, green sunfish, pumpkin seed, warmouth, bluegill, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, black crappie, stoneroller, carp, hornyhead chub, common shiner, rosyface shiner, sand shiner, bluntnose minnow, western blacknose dace, creek chub, grass pickerel, brook stickleback, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, rainbow darter, johnny darter, yellow perch, blackside darter, and central mudminnow.

<text>Nalchik ( ; Kabardian: , Nalṣ̂ăčʼ ; ) is the capital city of Kabardino-Balkaria, Russia, situated at an altitude of in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains; about northwest of Beslan (Beslan is in the Republic of North Ossetia–Alania). It covers an area of . Population: 

==History==
The territory of modern-day Nalchik was formerly known as Sloboda. The modern city dates from the early 19th century when the expanding Russian Empire built a fort there in 1818.

In 1838, a Russian military settlement was founded in the city, and after the Russian Revolution of 1917, in the year 1921, Nalchik was given the status of administrative center of Kabardin Autonomous Oblast. During the Russian Empire, the settlement was the administrative capital of the Nalchiksky Okrug of the Terek Oblast.

The word &quot;Nalchik&quot; literally means &quot;small horseshoe&quot; in Kabardian (or Circassian, a Northwest Caucasian language) and Karachay-Balkar (a Turkic language). It is a diminutive of &quot;na&#x27;l&quot;, a common Middle Eastern word (Arabic, Persian, Turkish) for &quot;horseshoe&quot;, possibly from the ancient Scythian, &#x27;nalak&quot; (horseshoe). The city of Nalchik was named this way because of how it is shaped as surrounded by the mountains of the land, and the Nalchik River is named after the city it runs across.

During World War II, on 2 November 1942, Nalchik was occupied by Romanian mountain troops (&quot;Vânători de munte&quot;) under the command of Brigadier General Ioan Dumitrache, its capture earning the Romanian General the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross. The city was heavily damaged during the conflict. General Dumitrache went to great length ordering his troops to protect local population during the time Nalchik was occupied by Romanian forces. Professor A. N. Dainaco, the Mayor of Nalchik at that time, thanked General Dumitrache for liberating the city. Although he was accused of war crimes, General Dumitrache was fully exonerated after the war by a joint Soviet and Romanian judicial commission.

In 1990, there was a 6.0 magnitude earthquake in Nalchik.

With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Nalchik and the Kabardino- Balkaria region become a federal republic of Russia. 

On October 13, 2005, Nalchik was attacked by a large group of Yarmuk Jamaat militants led by Shamil Basayev and Anzor Astemirov. Buildings associated with the Russian security forces were targeted, killing at least 14 civilians and wounding 115. Thirty-five policemen died in the fighting. Eighty-nine militants, including their leader Ilias Gorchkhanov, were killed, and another fifty-nine arrested.

<text>Nazran (; ) is the largest city in Ingushetia, Russia. It served as the republic&#x27;s capital from 1991 to 2000, until it was replaced by Magas, which was built for this purpose. It is the most populous city in the republic: 

== Etymology ==
The name of the town, possibly, derives from the name of the legendary first settler &quot;Nyasar&quot; (, also referred as &quot;Närt-Näsar&quot; ).

The town is associated by some scholars like with the Arabic word &quot;al nasaraa&quot; (), meaning &quot;Christian&quot;, thus explaining that the name was gotten from the fact that supposedly Christianity held on for longer in Nazran unlike in other neighboring places in Ingushetia. Although author explains that Muslims already were present here in 1405–1406. Vladimir 
Markovin also stated that the name of Nazran has an Arabic origin while quoting Lavrov.

== History ==
=== 18th–20th centuries ===

The &quot;aul&quot; of Nazran was founded in the late 18th century, with the official date of the foundation being considered 1781. This is based on the report of L. L. Shteder, who during his expedition to Caucasus in 1781, noticed Ingush outposts on the river of .
After becoming a military fortress in 1817, Nazran saw large numbers of Ingush population moving into it. It was granted town status in 1967.

During the Russian Empire, the settlement was the administrative capital of the Nazranovsky Okrug of the Terek Oblast. During the Soviet period, Nazran was the administrative center of Nazranovsky District within the Chechen–Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. After the Republic of Ingushetia and the Chechen Republic were separated in 1991, the town became the republic&#x27;s capital. This brought about a sharp increase in population: while counting 18,246 inhabitants according to the 1989 Census, during the 2002 Census Nazran had as many as 125,056 inhabitants.

=== 21st century ===

==== 2004 rebel raid on Nazran ====
In 2004, a group of Chechen and Ingush militants carried out a large-scale raid on Ingushetia, led by Shamil Basayev. The overnight attacks targeted fifteen official buildings in Nazran, and at least three towns and villages located on the Baku-Rostov highway that crosses the republic from east to west.

The raid lasted nearly five hours, and the assailants - said to number 200 to 300 - withdrew almost unscathed; the raiders apparently lost only two men during the attacks. The rebels killed 67 members of security forces, including the republic&#x27;s Interior Minister Abukar Kostoyev, his deputy Zyaudin Kotiev, top prosecutors, and other officials; they also captured and looted the MVD&#x27;s armory and police depots. 25 civilians, including a local United Nations worker, were killed in the crossfire.

Federal Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliyev met with General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, the commander of Russia&#x27;s Interior Ministry forces, and blamed them for the high number of deaths. Tikhomirov decided to resign after the meeting.

==== 2008 protests ====
Widespread protests erupted in January 2008, with a strong government response. The disturbances appear to have been fueled by heavy-handed government and para-military activity, including abductions, arrests and murders. Protesters demanded the resignation of President Zyazikov.

==== 2009 bombing ====
In August 2009, a suicide bomber drove a truck filled with explosives into the Nazran police headquarters. Russian news agencies reported that 25 were killed in the attack, and roughly 140 were wounded. It is believed that more bodies may still be in the rubble, yet to be found. The police headquarters was completely destroyed in the attack, including up to 30 police vehicles and munition stores.

<text>Sparty is the mascot of Michigan State University. Sparty is usually depicted as a muscular male Spartan warrior/athlete dressed in stylized Greek costume. After changing the team name from &quot;Aggies&quot; to &quot;Spartans&quot; in 1925, various incarnations of a Spartan warrior with a prominent chin appeared at university events and in university literature. In 1943, MSU art professor Leonard D. Jungwirth designed a statue for the university, which had to be cast in terra cotta because of World War II rationing. In 2005, the university replaced Jungwirth&#x27;s original statue with a bronze replica, moving the original indoors to protect it from the elements.

Sparty appears in several other incarnations. In printed literature, the university uses a copyrighted cartoon Spartan, usually drawn with a grimace and several days worth of whiskers, lending the nickname of &quot;Gruff&quot; Sparty. Finally, Sparty appears as a foam rubber mascot with an oversized head. The mascot costume, worn by an anonymous student, appears at most university sporting, alumni, and fundraising events; he is often portrayed in MSU notices and materials.

==History==
Though MSU is now a large university, in the 19th century it was a small agricultural college known as the State Agricultural College of Michigan. Thus, when the college fielded its first intercollegiate sports teams in the 1880s, the teams were appropriately named the &quot;Aggies&quot;. By 1925, the school had expanded beyond agriculture, becoming Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science. To reduce the emphasis on agriculture, the college held a contest to choose a new team name. The chosen entry was the &quot;Michigan Staters.&quot; George S. Alderton, then sports editor of the &quot;Lansing State Journal&quot;, and Dale Stafford, sportswriter for the &quot;Lansing Capitol News&quot;, felt the name was too unwieldy for newspaper headlines and searched the contest entries for a better choice. They settled on the &quot;Spartans&quot;, a name submitted by former Aggie athlete Perry J. Fremont. Alderton and Stafford began using the name in their game accounts, and it soon caught on as the &quot;de facto&quot; team name. Michigan State&#x27;s teams have been the Spartans ever since.

==Costumed mascot==

While MSU students and alumni often refer to the &quot;Spartan&quot; statue as Sparty, the incarnation of Sparty with national visibility is that of a costumed mascot who appears at athletic events and other university-related functions. The first mascot appeared in 1955 and was a papier-mâché Spartan head made by Theta Xi fraternity brothers Donald Pais, Kenneth Roberts, and Don Bauer. By the 1956 Rose Bowl Game, the papier-mâché head had been replaced by a fiberglass version that was thirty pounds lighter. In 1985, MSU Alumni Association Graphic Designer Dave Giordan was asked to draw a muscular Sparty in full body armor. Four years later, in 1989, a group came together to design and revamp the Sparty mascot. Character designer Tom Sapp of Real Characters, Inc. was hired to design and create a new Sparty character and costume. Research was conducted on Michigan State’s mission, community, and traditions. The result was an “approachable, fierce yet kind, man for all seasons” mascot. Sparty would reflect the university’s strength and character. To introduce MSU&#x27;s new mascot, six billboards designed by Tom Sapp were positioned around East Lansing announcing his Spartan Stadium debut. The costume, with a cartoonishly oversized head, bulging muscles, and a facial expression that treads a fine line between cute and pugnacious, was introduced to MSU fans during the 1989 football season. Sparty was an immediate hit, in part because the foam-rubber body parts, vinyl breastplate, and skirt have a freedom of movement that allow the anonymous student who portrays Sparty to be quite expressive despite the costume&#x27;s fixed stare. The student that portrays Sparty is a volunteer, despite rumors of financial compensation or a full scholarship. Early every calendar year, tryouts are held for the student to portray Sparty for the upcoming school year.
Sparty represents an ancient Spartan warrior, but wears a late Imperial-style Roman legionary&#x27;s helmet, which was not invented until several centuries after Sparta was subdued by the Roman Republic.

Sparty can be found entertaining MSU sporting event crowds with his antics during games. He is even lifted upon the shoulders of cheerleaders and does one-handed push ups. Besides sporting events, Sparty also attends many events around campus, the community, and the country throughout the year: alumni functions, charity events, weddings, bar mitzvahs, parades, and many other university events. Any revenues generated go to the upkeep of the Sparty Mascot Program, which is funded mainly by the MSU Alumni Association.

Sparty came to national prominence in the mid-1990s with his appearance in a series of television ads promoting ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. One advertisement depicted Sparty carrying gymnast Kerri Strug in the manner of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;—or, more to the point, Béla Károlyi, who carried the injured Strug to the medal platform to accept her team gold medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics. He also appeared in ESPN ads with background cameos, such as eating in a diner booth or browsing the shelves of a bookstore. In 2004, Sparty won the Best Mascot National Championship at the Universal Cheer Association/Universal Dance Association College Nationals, becoming the first Big Ten Conference mascot to do so. He won Best Mascot for the second year in a row after securing the honor again the following year. In addition to his title of &quot;best mascot&quot;, Sparty was voted the &quot;Buffest Mascot&quot; by &quot;Muscle and Fitness&quot; magazine. Sparty was even found in the refrigerators of local stores and many alumni when Sparty was featured on a series of Jones Soda bottles in late 2004, and he appeared again in 2005. Sparty was one of six college mascots nominated for the Mascot Hall of Fame in July 2006. In the summer of 2006, Alltel Wireless aired a commercial featuring ESPN&#x27;s Lee Corso and Sparty.

Three years after winning top honors for the first time, Sparty was again named best mascot. It was Sparty&#x27;s third title in just four years. His skit, &quot;Sparty&#x27;s Spectacular&quot;, featured music from many different genres, including rock, country, and Riverdance. To qualify for nationals, Sparty submitted a video showcasing his performances at athletic events and community service events.

Sparty appeared on the cover of the Wii version of &quot;NCAA Football 09&quot;, the first time a non-athlete was featured on it. EA Sports had a poll to see which mascot would appear on the cover, and Sparty won by over 75,000 votes.

==Statues==

When John Hannah became president of Michigan State College in 1941, he commissioned assistant professor of art Leonard D. Jungwirth to design a statue of an athletic Spartan warrior. Jungwirth sculpted a statue known simply as &quot;The Spartan&quot;, which soon gained the nickname of &quot;Sparty&quot;. Though Jungwirth originally designed &quot;The Spartan&quot; as a bronze statue, it had to be cast in terra cotta due to World War II rationing of bronze. The terra cotta statue stood on the banks of the Red Cedar River, until 2005, when the university replaced it with a bronze replica. The original &quot;Spartan&quot; was moved into the stadium, where it remains on display to this day.

===1945 terra cotta statue===
Dedicated on June 9, 1945, the terra cotta &quot;Spartan&quot; is made of five large glazed terra cotta sections fired from red Ohio clay. These pieces were joined by mortar joints, with a poured concrete core over a steel frame. The statue stands 9’ 7&quot; high and weighs approximately 3,000 pounds. When the statue was erected, popular media claimed that it was the tallest free-standing ceramic sculpture in the world, though that record remains unconfirmed. Though the statue&#x27;s pose recalls classic Greek sculpture, Jungwirth&#x27;s stylized design is closer to the mid-20th century modernist design, borrowing heavily from Cubism, Futurism, and depression-era civic art.

===2005 bronze statue===

By the late 20th century, Michigan&#x27;s harsh winters had taken a toll on the terra cotta statue, as had vandalism by fans of MSU&#x27;s rival school, the University of Michigan. While annual repair work helped stem the damage done by precipitation, extreme cold, and vandalism, the statue needed more intensive repair.
In 1989, the Save Our Sparty (SOS) campaign helped restore the statue. When they finished, restorers made fiberglass molds of the refurbished &quot;Sparty&quot;. New molds were made in 2004, because the 1989 molds had deteriorated, to cast an identical bronze replica that would better stand up to bad weather and vandalism.

The terra cotta &quot;Spartan&quot; was removed from its base on May 12, 2005. During MSU&#x27;s 2005 summer semester, the intersection at which the statue stood was completely redesigned to allow for safer traffic interaction with pedestrians. On Thursday, August 25, 2005, an unveiling of the new bronze &quot;Spartan&quot; took place. In addition, a Sesquicentennial parade on Saturday, October 8, 2005, concluded with a dedication ceremony at the statue. Meanwhile, the original terra cotta &quot;Spartan&quot; was moved to a new Spartan Stadium annex where it could be displayed safely indoors. Though most members of the MSU community agree that the original statue needs to be sheltered, some alumni and faculty have criticized the inaccessibility of the original statue.

===Traditions===
It is tradition for some alumni and other Spartan fans to have a picture taken with the &quot;Spartan&quot; statue to mark major life events. During graduation season there is a steady stream of recent graduates and their families posing with the statue. On weekends it is not uncommon to see newlywed couples doing the same. During the week before the annual football game against the University of Michigan Wolverines, members of the marching band take turns each guarding the statue against vandalism by fans of the rival school. The tradition is known as &quot;Sparty Watch&quot;; a similar vigil takes place at the Michigan Diag, where the inlaid &quot;M&quot; is defended against MSU fans. During the full team walk from Kellogg Center to Spartan Stadium that takes place prior to each home football game, players and coaches toss or place pennies at the statue as they proceed past it. After the final home football game the Spartan Marching Band circles the statue once before heading home to Adams Field.

<text>Cherokee Park is a municipal park located in Louisville, Kentucky, United States, and is part of the Louisville Olmsted Parks Conservancy. It was designed in 1891 by Frederick Law Olmsted, the father of landscape architecture along with 18 of Louisville&#x27;s 123 parks. Beargrass Creek runs through much of the park, and is crossed by numerous pedestrian and automobile bridges.

According to The Trust for Public Land, Cherokee Park has 500,000 visitors annually, making it tied for the 69th most popular municipal park in the United States.

The park features a 2.4 mile Scenic Loop through the park&#x27;s pastoral setting featuring rolling hills, open meadows and woodlands with separate lanes for vehicle traffic (one-way) and recreational users. The park was closed to vehicular traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic, with cars being allowed again after September 2021.

==History==

Cherokee Park opened in 1891, has always been a major draw, and was a key factor in sparking development in nearby parts of town.

===Pre-development===

The land comprising Cherokee Park was originally part of a military land grant in 1773 to James Southall and Richard Charlton.

A portion of the land passed to Judge Joshua Fry Bullitt, who sold it in 1868 to foundry magnate Archibald P. Cochran. Cochran established an estate there called Fern Cliff, which operated as a museum for a while but has since been demolished.

As the land was located around Beargrass Creek, it was hilly and ill-suited to farming. Prior to its conversion as a park, the land was used primarily for animal grazing, although much of it was wooded. By 1893 the land was carved into six estates, including Cochran&#x27;s (which was sold to the city after his death in 1889). The other estates belonged to the Bonnycastle , Barret , Morton &amp; Griswold , Alexander families, respectively. Those and two small lots under were bought by 1891. Additional land from the Longest, Barringer and Belknap families would be added to expand the park to its modern size.

===Park development===

In 1887, a city park system was proposed with three large suburban parks: east, west and south. The initial name of the eastern park was to be Beargrass Park, but in 1891, as was fashionable in the late 19th century, a name that evoked the romantic imagery of Native Americans was chosen.

Cochran&#x27;s name lives on in Cochran Hill, which became notable in the late 1960s when two tunnels were dug under it at a cost of $1.9 million so that I-64 would not have as extreme an impact on the park as it was run through it. The twin tunnels remain, running for about in length under the hill. Various groups, including one called Save Our Parks, formed as early as the 1940s to oppose running highways through the parks, and were largely responsible for forcing a tunnel as a compromise.

The tunnels, which opened in 1970, are one of three sites in Kentucky deemed &quot;exceptionally significant&quot; by the Federal Highway Administration. This designation, in turn, means it will be very difficult for the stretch of interstate running through the park ever to be widened.

In 2010, a proposal by the city to replace the Hogan&#x27;s Fountain Pavilion with two smaller structures created public opposition that led to a citizen fundraising effort to repair the existing structure, rather than replace it.

===Tornado damage in 1974===

Much of the park was heavily damaged in the April 3, 1974, tornado Super Outbreak. The tornado was an F4 on the Fujita scale. A city forester surveying the aftermath said, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that anyone alive today will see Cherokee Park as it was before the storm.&quot;

Because of the loss of thousands of mature trees, a massive re-planting effort was undertaken, financed in large part by a grant from the United States government under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974. However, to qualify for these funds, the park had to be restored to its pre-tornado design as faithfully as possible. The original Olmsted plans were consulted for the park&#x27;s &quot;rebirth&quot; (as it was called at the time), with 2,500 trees and 4,600 shrubs planted in the restoration effort.

===Crime===

Vandalism and petty crime has long plagued Cherokee Park. Vandalism was reported as early as 1936. In the 1950s into the mid-1960s newspapers reported with amusement on the serial theft of elements of the Hogan&#x27;s Fountain monument – especially a bronze turtle – with headlines such as &quot;Cherokee Park Turtle on the Loose Again&quot; and &quot;Bronze Turtle Steps Lively – Flees Cherokee Park Nest&quot;. According to a park commissioner, after the vandals saw the stories in print, they would always deposit the stolen pieces, which weighed about 100 pounds, somewhere in the park. Eventually, they were all bolted down from beneath such that vandals were unable to remove them. More seriously, the Daniel Boone statue at the park&#x27;s Eastern Parkway entrance was toppled on May 21, 1962, causing severe damage to it. Park officials claimed police had seen but not arrested a crowd of youths drinking openly near the statue earlier in the day, police denied the charge.

A 1970 newspaper article looked back on the tradition of turtle thievery with nostalgia, reporting that Hogan&#x27;s Fountain had by the 1970s become a nightly gathering place for hundreds of teenagers, who openly sold and used drugs, despite an increasing police presence, usually arresting youths on loitering charges and chasing out dealers of more serious drugs such as heroin.

Portions of the park were redesigned both to remove popular loitering locations and to increase the park&#x27;s usability to families and individuals for recreation. Combined with an increased police presence, these tactics greatly deterred drug use and gay cruising, however vandalism remains a minor problem. During periods of good weather, the park is invariably full of local residents engaged in a wide range of fitness activities as well as leisurely strolling or picnicking. On those rare occasions that two or more inches of snow fall, hundreds of locals take to the parks hills for informal sledding and snowboarding.

==Landmarks==

Cherokee Park contains many landmarks and points of interest. Many are self-contained areas within the larger park, set apart from each other by the natural terrain and creative use of landscaping. Because of the size and design of the park, many events can occur at the same time without interrupting each other.

* Big Rock – A large rock in Beargrass Creek, which also lends its name to a picnic area and playground nearby. The rock itself is used for picnics, and as an ill-advised jumping spot (its flat surface offers about an drop into the shallow creek water below). There is an open shelter building at Big Rock which was built in 1910 as a memorial to George Gaulbert, it was designed by William J. Dodd.
* Scenic Loop – A 2.43-mile (3.9-km) mixed-use road around much of the park, with separate lanes for pedestrians and motorized vehicles.
* Frisbee Field – A large open field used for many purposes, most commonly soccer and Ultimate.
* Baringer Hill – Commonly called &quot;Dog Hill&quot;, &quot;Kite Hill&quot;, or &quot;Hill Number One&quot;. Once popular for kites, after a renovation in the late 1990s it has become better known as a gathering point for dog owners. A fenced dog park located at the top of Cochran Hill opened in 2007.
* Hogan&#x27;s Fountain – A dog- and horse-watering fountain located atop a hill on the Scenic Loop, Hogan&#x27;s Fountain was financed by the Hogan Family of Anchorage, Kentucky, in 1905. The fountain was sculpted by Enid Yandell, and features the Greek God Pan. It was officially unveiled on August 31, 1905. The name Hogan&#x27;s Fountain is also often extended to the nearby hilltop area, which includes a large gazebo, baseball diamond, children&#x27;s fountains and a basketball court. This spot was once known as Bonnycastle Hill. Hogan&#x27;s Fountain is a popular place for group meetings, family reunions and picnics.
* Lover&#x27;s Lane – A secluded, heavily forested stretch of scenic loop just past Hogan&#x27;s Fountain.
* Cochran Hill – A hillside between Frisbee Field and Lexington Road, and site of a dog park.
* Christensen Fountain – A recently restored fountain near the Lexington Road entrance.
* Nettleroth Bird Sanctuary – Located in a quiet corner of the park, between Scenic Loop and a residential neighborhood.
* Belknap Bridge – When Lily Buckner Belknap died in 1893, her husband Col. Morris Burke Belknap constructed a stone bridge in Cherokee Park in her honor.

==Entrances==

The park is situated in the Highlands. As the city of Louisville expanded around the park, many developers donated land to the park in exchange for the right to connect roads to it. The numerous entrances have made navigating the park notoriously confusing to visitors. Neighborhoods with entrances to the park include Cherokee Triangle, Bonnycastle, Highlands-Douglass, Crescent Hill and Seneca Gardens.

==Plants and animals==
Cherokee Park is home to a surprising diversity of wildlife and plants. Eastern white tail deer, raccoon, gray fox, opossum, groundhogs, Eastern cottontail, gray squirrel, fox squirrel, snapping turtles, eastern box turtle, garter snakes, red tailed hawk, crows, beaver, the Louisville crayfish, and a handful of salamander varieties. Many different songbird species have been seen in the parks by the Beckham Bird Club and other naturalists. A flora of Cherokee Park and other Frederick Law Olmsted Parks was released in 2014 by Louisville botanist Patricia Dalton Haragan.

More recently, reports of coyotes in the park have become more widespread. A 2016 Louisville Magazine article noted that &quot;Cherokee Park acts as Costco for coyotes: squirrels, mice and chipmunks in bulk for eating, water to drink and hollow tree trunks or dense thickets galore for shelter.&quot;

<doc id="478797" wikidata="Q1666085" url="?curid=478797" title="Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission">
<text>The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC/UNESCO) was established by resolution 2.31 adopted by the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). It first met in Paris at UNESCO Headquarters from 19 to 27 October 1961. Initially, 40 States became members of the commission. The IOC assists governments to address their individual and collective ocean and coastal management needs, through the sharing of knowledge, information and technology as well as through the co-ordination of programs and building capacity in ocean and coastal research, observations and services.

The IOC is the only UN body specialized in ocean science and services. It provides a focus for other UN organizations and agencies with regard to ocean science, observations and data exchange, and services such as global tsunami warning systems. Established in 1960, the Commission celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2010 and currently has 147 Member States. Since the IOC often has its own accreditation within meetings such as those of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), this gives UNESCO two seats and two voices at the table.

The IOC has been a key player in the recent international debate on sustainable development as it relates to the ocean. The Rio+20 outcome document affirmed the importance of &quot;the ocean and coasts&quot; to the sustainability debate, and is the basis for IOC&#x27;s ongoing support to the creation of the Sustainable Development Goal 14 dedicated to the ocean. The IOC is closely involved in several international partnerships for ocean sustainability such as with the CBD, UN-Oceans and the World Ocean Assessment.

== IOC High Level Objectives (2014-2021)==
1. Healthy ocean ecosystems and sustained ecosystem services

The IOC is working to improve responses to unprecedented environmental changes and to promote ocean health via marine sciences. The IOC supports the UN World Ocean Assessment, the UNGA-led regular process for reviewing the state of the marine environment, including socio-economic aspects. Integrating existing information from different disciplines on the state of the ocean will improve policy responses from national governments and the international community. The IOC-led Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and the Joint World Meteorological Organization (WMO)-IOC Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) are also successful examples of multilateral efforts for ocean monitoring, observation, and services. GOOS coordinates the deployment of observation technologies, rapid and universal dissemination of data flows, and delivery of marine information to managers, decision makers, and the general public. JCOMM is an intergovernmental body of technical experts drawn from the meteorological and oceanographic communities to provide observing capabilities, data management, and services.

2. Effective early warning systems and preparedness for tsunamis and other ocean-related hazards

The IOC aids and advises policy makers and managers in the reduction of risks from tsunamis, storm surges, Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) and other coastal hazards. After close to fifty years of experience coordinating the Pacific Tsunami Warning System (PTWS), IOC-UNESCO is leading a global effort to establish ocean-based tsunami warning systems as part of an overall multi-hazard disaster reduction strategy. The IOC Tsunami Unit works with Member States, together with other UN agencies and NGOs, to build sustainable tsunami early warning systems. In this context, the IOC coordinates and fosters the establishment of regional intergovernmental tsunami warning and mitigation systems in the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean, in the Caribbean, and in the North East Atlantic, the Mediterranean and connected seas. Through its Intergovernmental Panel on Harmful Algae (IPHAB), the IOC also works to establish systems that can predict the occurrences and mitigate the effects of HAB events.

3. Increased resiliency to climate change and variability and enhanced safety, efficiency and effectiveness of ocean-based activities through scientifically founded services, adaptation and mitigation strategies

The IOC works with developed and developing countries to monitor and document changes in order to aid in the design of adaptation and mitigation strategies. Through GOOS, the IOC monitors the physical, chemical and biological aspects and changes in the world&#x27;s ocean. This unified network permits the design of adaptation and mitigation strategies and provides information and data for governments, industry, scientists and the general public. The IOC is also actively pushing to convince decision makers of the importance of sound scientific knowledge in designing policy on integrated coastal management, HABs, and ocean acidification (through blue carbon research and initiatives). Ocean acidification is of particular concern to the IOC, as increasing levels in the ocean are associated with coral bleaching, changes in marine biodiversity, and other related problems.

4. Enhanced knowledge of emerging ocean science issues

The IOC actively assists Member States in the design and implementation of new Marine Spatial Planning tools, both at the political and managerial levels, for ecosystem-based management of marine and coastal areas. Through its International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange programme (IODE), the IOC facilitates the exploitation, development, and exchange of oceanographic data and information among participating Member States. IODE seeks, in particular, to train marine information specialists from developing countries. The Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) manages the global marine biodiversity knowledge base, through which hundreds of institutions and scientists contribute information on the past and current diversity, abundance and distribution of marine life. OBIS data is used worldwide for planning ocean conservation policies, and identifying biodiversity hotspots and distribution trends. It allows the IOC to provide expertise, data and information for environmental, climate change, and marine biodiversity assessments.

== IOC Contributions to UNESCO&#x27;s Global Priorities ==

* GENDER

The IOC is committed to promoting gender equality and women&#x27;s empowerment in ocean science. Through the Network of Women in Ocean Science (NOW in Ocean Science), the IOC hopes to mobilize women marine scientists to work with IOC to create a space for exchange of experience and opportunities for young women willing to start a career in marine science.

* AFRICA

The IOC has established a Sub-Commission for Africa and adjacent islands to reinforce the implementation of IOC programmes in Africa and mobilize extra-budgetary resources. The IOC Regional Office, established within the UNESCO Office in Nairobi, Kenya, became operational in 2012 and has formulated IOC&#x27;s strategic plan for the region.

== IOC &amp; Capacity Development ==

The IOC seeks to empower developing countries through fund-raising, team building, and decision-making skills development to sustainably use their coastal and marine resources by encouraging &#x27;self-driven&#x27; capacity-development. This approach aims to reduce dependence on aid while creating incentives for states to more fully integrate scientific know-how into policy design and implementation processes.

* Transfer of Marine Technology

The IOC of UNESCO is recognized in the UN-wide system for its traditional competencies in the field of Transfer of Marine Technology (Part XIV) of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). On the occasion of its first session in 2001, the IOC&#x27;s Advisory Body of Experts on the Law of the Sea (IOC/ABE-LOS), an IOC subsidiary body whose function is to provide advice on the IOC&#x27;s role in relation to UNCLOS upon the request from the IOC governing bodies, accepted the challenge of drawing the Criteria and Guidelines on Transfer of Marine Technology (CGTMT), following the instructions set forth in Article 271 of UNCLOS:
&quot;States, directly or through competent international organizations, shall promote the establishment of generally accepted guidelines, criteria and standards for the transfer of marine technology on a bilateral basis or within the framework of international organizations and other fore, taking into account, in particular, the interests and needs of developing States&quot;

In the CGTMT, marine technology refers to instruments, equipment, vessels, processes and methodologies required to produce and use knowledge to improve the study and understanding of the nature and resources of the ocean and coastal areas. In this sense, marine technology may include any of the following components:

a)Information and data, in a user-friendly format, on marine sciences and related marine operations and services
b)Manuals, guidelines, criteria, standards, reference materials
c)Sampling and methodology equipment (e.g., for water, geological, biological, chemical samples)
d)Observation facilities and equipment (e.g., remote sensing equipment, buoys, tide gauges, shipboard and other means of ocean observation)
e)Equipment for in situ and laboratory observations, analysis and experimentation
f)Computer and computer software, including models and modeling techniques
g)Expertise, knowledge, skills, technical/scientific/legal know-how and analytical methods related to marine scientific research and observation

Transfer of Marine Technology (TMT) should enable all parties concerned to benefit on an equitable basis from developments in marine science related activities, in particular, those aiming at stimulating the social and economic contexts in developing States.

* Flagship initiative: OceanTeacher Global Academy

OceanTeacher (OT) has been developed as a training system for ocean data managers (working in ocean data centres), marine information managers (marine librarians) as well as for marine researchers who wish to acquire knowledge on data and/or information for planning and management. Since 2005, more than a thousand students from over a hundred countries attended courses at the IOC Project Office for IODE, based in Oostende, Belgium, and in the context of regional projects. The “Global Academy” component of OT (OTGA) is still being developed, but it seeks to expand the program into a worldwide training facility, with training courses related to multiple IOC fields (from ICAM to Tsunami Alert Systems) in various Regional Training Centers (RTCs), all of them connected in real time via the OceanTeacher Learning Management System, and using a multilingual approach to scientific training (English, Spanish, and other national languages, depending on the regional and national context). OTGA will change training from a “north to south” culture to a north–south, south-south, and south–north model by promoting the expertise available in developing countries. This new &quot;OceanTeacher Global Academy&quot; concept will be implemented during 2014. OTGA will be broadcasting from and to anywhere across the world.

<text>The Royal Military College, Duntroon, also known simply as Duntroon, is the Australian Army&#x27;s officer training establishment. It was founded at Duntroon, in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, in 1911 and is at the foot of Mount Pleasant near Lake Burley Griffin, close to the Department of Defence headquarters at Russell Hill. Duntroon is adjacent to the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA), which is Australian Defence Force&#x27;s tri-service military academy, which provides military and tertiary academic education for junior officers of the Australian Army, Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Australian Navy.

==History==
The Royal Military College, Duntroon, was opened on 27 June 1911 by the Governor-General, Lord Dudley. Situated on the Campbell family homestead in Canberra, which had been named &quot;Duntroon&quot; in 1833 after Duntrune Castle – their ancestral home on Loch Crinan in Argyll, Scotland. The college was one of the first Commonwealth facilities established in the newly created capital. The Australian Government first rented the Duntroon homestead for two years (November 1910 – July 1912) and acquired to the estate and after the creation of the federal capital.

The first Commandant of the college was Brigadier General William Bridges, who later died on a hospital ship after being wounded by a sniper on the shores of Gallipoli. Under his recommendations the college was modelled on aspects from the Royal Military College of Canada and the military colleges of Britain and the United States of America. Several British officers, including Lieutenant Colonel Charles Gwynn as Director of Military Art, were assigned as staff members of the college. During Bridges&#x27; frequent absences, Gwynn served as acting Commandant.
When the First World War broke out in August 1914, there had not been enough time for the first class to complete the full Duntroon course. Nevertheless, it was decided to graduate the class early so that they could be sent to Gallipoli, where General Sir Ian Hamilton, commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, said that &quot;... each Duntroon-educated officer was ... worth his weight in gold&quot;. During the war, 158 Duntroon graduates had been sent overseas on active service, of whom 42 were killed or died of wounds and another 58 were wounded. In 1927 the King&#x27;s Colour was presented to the Corps of Staff Cadets by His Royal Highness, The Duke of York.

In the beginning, the college offered a four-year course, during which the first two years focused upon civil subjects and the last two years focused upon military subjects. Over the entire course, however, there was military specific training, including physical training, drill, signalling and weapon handling. Over the years, however, with the impact of the two World Wars, the duration and focus of the course changed as the requirements of the Army dictated. The college was forced to relocate to the Victoria Barracks, Sydney between 1931 and 1936 due to the economic downturn caused by the Great Depression. The commandant at the time, Brigadier-General E.F. Harrison considered the move of the college, a severe blow to the &#x27;Duntroon spirit&#x27;, suggested to the Minister for Home Affairs, Arthur Blakely, that the name &quot;Duntroon&quot; move with the college to Sydney, and the local area in Canberra be changed to &quot;Campbell&quot;. The proposal for the name moving to Sydney was, supported by Percy Deane, the head of the Department of Home Affairs (1929–32) in an official memorandum stating that the heritage of Duntroon had become so great that &quot;As a matter of fact, &quot;Duntroon&quot; is as well known in military circles as &quot;Sandhurst&quot;; however, he later stated it was proposed that the area in Canberra retain the name Duntroon. In a letter to Blakeley, Albert Ernest Green the Minister for Defence stated that in relation to the College in Sydney being called Duntroon, the Military Board has, &quot;recommended in view of the tradition established by the Royal Military College and its association with the name &#x27;Duntroon&#x27; that the name be retained for use on transfer of the Royal Military College to Paddington&quot;. The area would remain to be called Duntroon until 1956, when the suburb of Campbell was created named after Robert Campbell of the Campbell family, where ADFA and RMC-D reside.

During the Second World War short courses of between six months and a year were run, and ultimately 696 graduates of the College undertook active service overseas in either the Australian, British or New Zealand armed forces, while a further 122 former cadets who had not graduated served in varying capacities. Of these 122, three went on to have quite distinguished careers, with one rising to the rank of brigadier in the Australian Army, another to brigadier in the New Zealand Army and a third, R.C. McCay, reaching the rank of lieutenant general and serving in the British Indian Army and then becoming chief-of-staff of the newly formed Pakistan Army.

Following the war, the length of the course was set at four years again and efforts were made to increase the level of academic rigour in the college&#x27;s programs. This culminated in 1967 when the college affiliated with the University of New South Wales (UNSW) to offer bachelor&#x27;s courses in Arts, Science or Engineering, commencing in the 1968 academic year. Under this program, the first degrees from RMC were awarded in 1971. To graduate, cadets had to achieve passes in both military and academic studies and leadership. The link with UNSW was almost severed in 1969 when Duntroon was the centre of an inquiry after Gerry Walsh, a member of the academic staff, revealed details of bastardisation passed on to him by a student at the college. The inquiry resulted in at least one army career ending, while other personnel were severely punished. A further bastardisation scandal was exposed in 1983.
With the closure of the Officer Cadet School, Portsea in December 1985, and the closure of the Women&#x27;s Officer Training Wing at Georges Heights, Sydney, in December 1984, the Royal Military College, Duntroon became the sole General Service Officer training institute in the Australian Army, as all Regular Army officers serving in combat, combat support or service support Corps were required to attend Duntroon to be commissioned. Shortly after this, the role of the college changed again with the establishment of the Australian Defence Force Academy in 1986. As a result of this change, Duntroon ceased to offer university degrees as ADFA became responsible for the academic training of Army cadets, as well as those from the Air Force and Navy. The same year, the college celebrated its 75th anniversary (1911–1986). As an acknowledgement of this, 33-cent stamps featuring the head of a male officer cadet were printed; the first day of issue was 27 June 1986.

RMC&#x27;s purview was expanded in 1995 as it &quot;became responsible for the initial military training of all full-time, part-time and specialist service officers in the Australian Army&quot;. This resulted in the centralisation of all officer training courses under the college&#x27;s auspices; this included short courses for specialist service officers such as doctors, nurses, lawyers and chaplains, under the auspices of Romani Company, as well as the delivery of the final module of the Reserve officer training continuum. For a brief period, under the Ready Reserve Scheme, Reserve officers attended the college for a cut-down six-month version of the full-time course. For full-time General Service Officer cadets though, the program remained essentially unchanged from that which had been established after the formation of ADFA, when the course had been reduced to 18 months, and broken up into three distinct classes—III (third), II (second) and I (first) Class. Under this program, which has been maintained since 1986, cadets who wish to pursue a degree attend ADFA for three years upon appointment, before going to Duntroon for 12 months, and starting the course in II Class. This is referred to as &quot;going over the hill&quot;, as cadets are marched in formation over a spur of Mt. Pleasant that divides the ADFA and RMC campuses. For those cadets who pursue a four-year bachelors degree (such as Engineering or Hons), they come back to ADFA for their final year as a Lieutenant, graduating with their degree after five years after starting.

Anonymous reviews of officer training in 2007 brought to light racism and harassment of female recruits. In 2011, Andrew Wilkie admitted to being both a victim and perpetrator of bullying while at Duntroon.

In 2011, the college celebrated its centenary (1911–2011); as part of the celebrations, Queen Elizabeth II presented the college with new colours. A series of silver dollar coins were also minted.

==Present day==
===Organisation===
The majority of the cadets at Duntroon are members of the Australian Army, although the college also trains some Royal Australian Air Force personnel who are training to become Ground Defence Officers. By tradition a small number of officer cadets from New Zealand also attend the college, while since 1967 there has been a steady number of foreign cadets attending the college from nations in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. While at the college, officer cadets are referred to by the honorary title of &#x27;staff cadet&#x27;, which is used as a substitute for the cadet&#x27;s rank which is technically &#x27;Officer Cadet&#x27;. This title came about due to the fact that originally graduates entered the Staff Officer Corps of the Australian Army. After the late 1940s, however, graduates were assigned different corps upon graduation and were no longer posted to the Staff Corps. The title was kept on as a tradition at Duntroon, however, although officer trainees at all other Australian Army officer training establishments are referred to as &#x27;officer cadets&#x27;.

Administratively, the cadets are organised into a nominal infantry battalion structure, which is known internally as the 11th Infantry Battalion, with companies, platoons and sections which form the Corps of Staff Cadets. Within each of these formations there are cadets from all three classes (levels of training), who are organised into an internal hierarchy that gives the cadets themselves responsibility for looking after their own administration while the Corps is in barracks, albeit with guidance and supervision from training staff. Field training, however, is delivered by the non-commissioned officers and commissioned officers of the training staff and during this phase the cadets are separated into their distinct class groups.

Since its inception, the size of the Corps of Staff Cadets has fluctuated. Initially the Corps was organised into a single company, however, in 1922 the decline in the number of cadets being admitted meant that in reality only two platoons existed. Nevertheless, since then the Corps has largely increased. In 1947, when the four-year course was re-established following its suspension during the Second World War, the Corps was organised into two companies that were designated alphabetically &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27;. In 1950, however, as the size of the Corps rose to 190 cadets, a third company, designated &#x27;C&#x27; Company was established. These companies were re-organised the following year, however, as the Corps was expanded to 210 cadets and a fourth company raised. At this time the alphabetical designations were replaced with geographical names that were chosen based upon places where Australians had fought: Gallipoli, Bardia, Alamein and Kokoda.

By 1954 the number of cadets had risen further to 260, necessitating the raising of a fifth company and at this stage it was decided to name the companies after famous Australian battles, these names being: Alamein, Gallipoli, Kokoda, Kapyong and Romani. Following this expansion, however, the size of the Corps dropped and in 1958 the number of cadets had fallen to 200 and as a result Romani Company was disbanded. In 1974 a fifth company was raised—Long Tan—while in 1976, a sixth company was raised and Romani Company was re-established. In 1986, as a result of the changing role of Duntroon, the Corps was reduced to four companies again, with Kokoda and Romani Companies being disbanded. Kokoda was reformed in 1987 as the size of the Corps reached 370 cadets, while Long Tan was disbanded in 1991 and reformed in 1995.

There are currently five full-time companies making up the Corps, these are: Long Tan, Alamein, Gallipoli, Kapyong and Kokoda. The sixth company, Romani, is used for Reserve officers who come to the College in January and July to complete the final module of their training. There is also a rehabilitation and administration company known as Bridges Company, established in October 1989. Over the course of the training semester the five full-time companies compete through sporting events and academic studies for the honour of carrying the Sovereign&#x27;s Banner on parade, with the first placed company taking the title of &#x27;Sovereign&#x27;s Company&#x27; for the next semester and taking their place on the right flank when the Corps is on parade.

===Programs===
The charter of the Royal Military College, Duntroon is &quot;to produce officers capable of commanding platoon-sized elements in the Hardened and Networked Army concept, and to prepare specialist candidates for commissioning. The College prepares cadets and other selected candidates for careers in the Army by promoting leadership and integrity; by promoting high ideals and the pursuit of excellence, and by inculcating a sense of duty, loyalty and service to the nation&quot;. The current full-time program is a course of 18 months in duration, broken into three distinct classes, numbered as III, II and I Class. Each class lasts six months in duration and cadets must successfully complete each component to graduate and receive their commission. Throughout the course, cadets receive training in leadership, tactics, weapons systems, military law, military accounting systems, corporate governance and military history. The course is designed to test the cadets physically and mentally and graduation is by no means guaranteed. Upon graduating, cadets are promoted to the rank of lieutenant and receive a Diploma in Military Leadership.

Within the full-time course, there are two streams of cadets arriving at Duntroon; those that enter from the Australian Defence Force Academy and those that enter through the direct entry method. Direct Entry cadets complete the eighteen-month course, whilst cadets from ADFA join Duntroon in II Class, combining with the Direct Entry cadets and completing twelve months at the college. The leadership and military training provided at ADFA during the three years of training is considered the equivalent of III Class at RMC.

The college also oversees the program for training officers in the Australian Army Reserve. Upon appointment to the Reserves, members join a University Regiment within their location and then undertake their training over the course of five modules run by the various University Regiments around Australia. Additionally, they are required to parade at their unit one night a week and one weekend a month. The final six-and-a-half-week module of the Reserve officer course is conducted at Duntroon. In January 2008, the Part-time Officers course was shortened to a duration of 104 days, with further employment training, specific to Corps allocation, conducted thereafter.

In 2003, the Officer Tertiary Recruitment Scheme (OTRS) was introduced, which involves the recruitment of officers enrolled in tertiary study. Essentially, this program involves undergraduate sponsorship of university students, who are appointed as Officer Cadets in the Australian Regular Army, while they study. During their tertiary study, they train with the applicable University Regiment as reservists and conduct modules of training as they are able to fit in around their studies. At the conclusion of their study (provided they have completed the necessary modules) they enroll at Duntroon in II Class.

In 2024 a two year trial of a modified officer training schedule - described by the Australian Defence Department as a &quot;contemporary approach to officer training&quot; - was established to replace the 18 month training program previously run at Duntroon (the program adopted after the transfer of university studies to The Australian Defence Force Academy in 1986 and the focus of Duntroon strictly on Army officer military training). Scheduled to conclude in December 2025, the new program shortened the 18 month training program to a 12-month officer commissioning program (OCP), comprising six modules that include practical applications of leadership, command, foundation warfighting and military planning.

==The Band of the Royal Military College, Duntroon==
The Band of the Royal Military College, Duntroon has been in existence in some shape or form since 1916 when a part-time band was established from volunteers drawn from the riding staff. Nevertheless, it was not until 1954 that they were officially established, when a band formed from members of the Regular Army was established at the college. In 1968 it became part of the Australian Army Band Corps and since then it has become a regular feature of the ceremonies and parades conducted at the college, as well as at other events around Australia and overseas. Perhaps the most notable of these performances was in 2000, when the Band accompanied a detachment of the Australian Federation Guard to Great Britain where, as part of the celebrations of the centenary of Australia&#x27;s federation, the AFG mounted the Queen&#x27;s Guard at Buckingham Palace, while the RMC Band provided the Guards Band. Recently the band has also supported Australian troops serving overseas.

In the 1980s the band began performing shows for local charities, known as the &quot;Strike up the Band&quot; shows and this continues today, albeit under the guise of the &quot;Music at Midday&quot; shows which the band performs six times a year, with proceeds going to local charities.

==Buildings and features==
The College itself is situated at the foot of Mount Pleasant on the Duntroon estate. The base is one of the only military bases in Australia that is open to the general public, consisting of a large area of land incorporating a golf course, a library, a residential area for Defence members and their families, various area logistics and infrastructure units, a military hospital, a retail area, vast sporting facilities and the Australian Defence Force Academy.

The ship&#x27;s bell from (which served as a troopship from 1942 to 1949) was removed when the ship was sold by her Australian owners in 1960, and was presented to the College in 1978. It is now positioned at the base of the flag station near the parade ground and is used daily as part of the cadets&#x27; flag duties. Many of the original buildings from when the college was first opened in 1911 still stand and continue to be used today, having been heritage listed. An example of this is the officers&#x27; mess, known as &#x27;Duntroon House&#x27;, which is an imposing stone building, that was actually built as the Campbell family&#x27;s house before the land was purchased by the Crown.

The Majura Training Area is located nearby and is currently where cadets from the College undertake the majority of their basic field training in III Class.

The Anzac Memorial Chapel of St Paul was opened on 30 April 1966. The chapel has a common foyer with two specific chapels: Anglican/Protestant Denominations and Catholic. Retired Colours are displayed in the foyer. Also in the foyer is a perpetual light that is lit while former cadets are on operations with the ADF. The chapel is also used for the Graduation Church Parade. Beside the main chapel is the Changi Chapel, which was reconstructed on the site and rededicated in August 1988.

==Graduation awards==
There are two main awards presented to cadets upon graduation: the King&#x27;s Medal and the Sword of Honour. The King&#x27;s Medal is awarded to the cadet graduating top of their class academically. It was originally instituted in 1919, and all cadets, including foreign cadets attending the college, are eligible. Indeed, Singaporean cadets established a long tradition of receiving this honour, doing so in 1975, 1978, 1979, 1980 and 1982 according to a 1986 source. The Sword of Honour is awarded to the cadet who displays &quot;exemplary conduct and performance of duty&quot; throughout their course.

==Reserve Units of the Royal Military College – Australia==

In 1997 the Royal Military College took responsibility for overseeing the training provided to Reserve officer cadets and as a result in 1998 the Royal Military College of Australia was established as a formation. As a part of this formation, the following University Regiments were placed under the college&#x27;s command:

*Melbourne University Regiment (MUR)
*Monash University Regiment (MonUR)
*Queensland University Regiment (QUR) (Including North Queensland Company)
*University of New South Wales Regiment (UNSWR)
*Sydney University Regiment (SUR) (Including Australian National University (ANU) Company)
*Adelaide Universities Regiment (AUR) (Including Northern Australia Platoon)
*Western Australia University Regiment (WAUR)
*University of Tasmania Company (UTC).

In July 2008, however, responsibility for Reserve officer training was taken away from Duntroon, and these units were placed under the command of the 2nd Division, with each regiment reporting directly to its parent brigade unit. Nevertheless, they continue to follow the Duntroon curriculum in modularised format, and Reserve officer cadets attend the college for their final four-week training block prior to commissioning.

==Commandants==
The following officers served as commandants of the college:

<text>Lord Aylmer, Baron of Balrath, in the County of Meath, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1718 for the naval commander Matthew Aylmer, the second son of Sir Christopher Aylmer, 1st Baronet, of Balrath (see below). Lord Aylmer&#x27;s son, the second Baron, represented Rye in the House of Commons. The latter&#x27;s grandson, the fourth Baron, succeeded his kinsman as seventh Baronet, of Balrath, in 1776. The titles remain united. He was succeeded in both titles by his son, the fifth Baron. He was a general in the Army and served as Governor General of Canada from 1830 to 1835. Lord Aylmer assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Whitworth in 1825 on the death of his uncle Charles Whitworth, 1st Earl Whitworth. On his death, the titles passed to his younger brother, the sixth Baron. He was an admiral in the Royal Navy.

He was succeeded by his second cousin, Udolphus Aylmer, the seventh Baron, born on 10 June 1814 and living in Canada. He was the son of John Athalmer Aylmer, eldest son of Admiral John Aylmer, son of Reverend the Hon. John Aylmer, fourth son of the second Baron. His claim to the titles was not allowed until 1860, however. His son Matthew Aylmer, the eighth Baron, was a major-general in the Canadian Army. His third son, the eleventh Baron, was succeeded by his third cousin, the twelfth Baron. He was the great-grandson of Major-General Harry Aylmer, second son of the aforementioned Admiral John Aylmer. On his death in 1982, the title passed to his second cousin, the thirteenth Baron. He was the grandson of Frederick Arthur Aylmer, second son of Major-General Harry Aylmer. the titles are held by his son, the fourteenth Baron.

The Aylmer Baronetcy, of Balrath in the County of Meath, was created on 6 November 1662 in the Baronetage of Ireland for Christopher Aylmer. On the death of his great-grandson, the sixth Baronet, the title was inherited by the latter&#x27;s kinsman, the fourth Baron Aylmer and became subsumed into that title.

The family seat was Donadea Castle, near Donadea, County Kildare.

<text>The Hep Stars are a Swedish rock band formed in Stockholm in 1963. During 1965–1966 the band was the most successful of contemporary 1960s Swedish pop groups performing in the English language. Outside the Nordic countries the band is best known as a launching point for the keyboard player, lead guitar and composer Benny Andersson, who went on to enjoy worldwide success with ABBA.

The band was founded by the drummer Christer &quot;Chrille&quot; Pettersson (3 November 1942 – 27 August 2006) and the bass guitarist Lennart &quot;Lelle&quot; Hegland (9 January 1943 – 13 April 2022) with the keyboard player Hans Östlund and the lead/rhythm guitarist-singer Jan &quot;Janne&quot; Frisk (29 November 1943). At the height of their popularity, the line-up consisted of Hegland, Pettersson, Frisk, Sven Ove &quot;Svenne&quot; Hedlund on lead vocals (10 March 1945, Solna – 3 December 2022) and Benny Andersson on keyboards and lead guitarist.

==Beginnings==
Originally, the band called themselves Quartet Yep. Their repertoire included various styles of music from Latin dance to rock in order to get as many gigs as possible in varying venues. Influenced mainly by Frisk, their music started to veer towards rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll and pop. The band decided a more intriguing name was in order and on Frisk&#x27;s suggestion Hep Stars was chosen. The idea came from a line in the Bill Haley song &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot; – &quot;It&#x27;s the hipster&#x27;s dance&quot; – with a slight alteration in written form. They started to get support gigs also closing after the headline act. A typical gig had them playing for around four hours with one set of rock.

Hegland called Hedlund to fill the singer&#x27;s slot for Frisk who had temporarily joined a tour backing band for some extra money for a new guitar amp. The band quickly noticed Hedlund&#x27;s abilities as both a singer and a frontman. On Frisk&#x27;s return, they shared lead vocals for a period of time with Frisk singing the more straightforward rockers and Hedlund handling the ballads.

By the summer of 1964, they were performing to audiences of 2000. The rock scene took note of them after one evening in Nalen, the most important rock club in Sweden during the 1960s. The main act failed to appear and the Hep Stars, the support act, filled in to great acclaim, especially among rockers (or &quot;raggare&quot; as they were known in Sweden). Their reputation started to spread through word-of-mouth.

At this point, Hegland managed to persuade the music businessman and Olga-record label owner Åke Gerhard to be their manager.

After the group&#x27;s first single (&quot;Kana Kapila&quot;, 1964) the original keyboard player, Hans Östlund, was asked to leave because of relations growing sour, especially with Hedlund and founder member Pettersson, who left the band fed up with squabbles. He was asked to rejoin and the band continued as a four piece for a short time in autumn 1964.

Hedlund owned a van and occasionally drove other bands to gigs. One of these bands was Elverkets Spelmanslag so Hedlund saw Benny Andersson performing, making an impression with his quick runs and fill-ins. On Hedlund&#x27;s suggestion, Andersson was called for an audition. In turn, Andersson had earlier read a tabloid article about the camping car Hep Stars used when touring and which could hold both the band and the equipment. This assured him that Hep Stars had it going along with their assuring comments on the current scene.

The band had become what is considered to be the classic line-up: Sven Hedlund (vocals), Jan Frisk (guitar/vocals), Benny Andersson (keyboards), Lennart Hegland (bass guitar) and Christer Pettersson (drums). The fans were soon to absorb their nicknames Svenne, Janne, Benny, Lelle and Chrille.

==Breakthrough==
Hep Stars recorded their next three singles in one six-hour session without overdubs on three-track equipment.
They performed in the TV program &quot;Drop In&quot; in March 1965. In April, they had three songs in the radio playlist top 4 at the same time: &quot;Cadillac&quot;, &quot;Farmer John&quot; and &quot;A Tribute To Buddy Holly&quot;. On the sales chart &quot;Cadillac&quot; and &quot;Farmer&quot; peaked at #1 for one week and four weeks respectively, while &quot;Tribute&quot; peaked at #5. Hedlund became the band&#x27;s figurehead and the first true pop star in Sweden, the band itself being headline material in tabloids and various youth-oriented magazines.

Other Swedish bands such as Tages and Shanes who largely wrote their own songs made a remark on Hep Stars using cover versions. This motivated Andersson to try to write songs for the band. Also, it was a hard job to try to find fresh songs for the band&#x27;s repertoire. The first song he introduced to the band was &quot;No Response&quot; which reached #3 in the charts. The band was at the height of popularity, especially among rock audiences, during 1965–1966 with both cover and original songs. In 1966, they performed 150 gigs in Sweden alone. The popularity grew rapidly and the band was highly successful also in Norway and Finland making several tours in both countries.

==Mainstream success, break up==
&quot;I Natt Jag Drömde&quot; a Swedish version of &quot;Last Night I Had A Strangest Dream&quot; was a massive hit in Sweden but, being a folk-song, divided the band to a degree. It also caused confusion among rock-oriented fans. The band continued playing up to 200 gigs in 1967. However, problems arose when the backup organisation made a less than adequate job with the tax authorities and in the general running of the business. At the same time, the general economic situation in the country started to stagnate towards the end of the 1960s.
Together, they forced the band to navigate towards a wider audience and the showband scene. The American singer Charlotte Walker joined in 1968.

This move contradicted especially with Frisk, who was eventually asked to leave early in 1969 due to diminishing interest. Björn Ulvaeus from the Hootenanny Singers stepped in. The original member leaving the band led to mixed feelings, and the decision was made to call it a day after fulfilling the tour contracts. The band played its last gig in August 1969 after which Andersson, Ulvaeus, Walker and Hedlund left the band. It went through several line-up changes before finally breaking up in the early 1970s with Hegland the only original member.
==Afterwards==
Andersson and Ulvaeus continued with Hedlund and Walker making a show-tour with the comedian Finn Alberth. After that, Hedlund and Walker formed the duo Svenne &amp; Lotta, who recorded the Swedish original of the ABBA song &quot;Bang A Boomerang&quot;. They established themselves and enjoyed considerable success especially in Denmark and in mid-Europe.

Having established their partnership in Hep Stars, Andersson and Ulvaeus continued both as a songwriting team for Polar Music as well as the duo Björn &amp; Benny, which eventually led to ABBA.

After a break Frisk, Hegland and Pettersson formed Gummibandet and released three albums in the 1970s. In the 1980s, a wave of 1960s nostalgia swept Sweden and the members had a discussion about re-forming the Hep Stars. They made some successful tours with Benneth Fagerlund replacing Andersson on keyboards. In 1990, Hegland stepped down, with Fagerlund following suit a few years later.

For the 40th anniversary collection, &quot;Cadillac Madness (40 years 40 hits 1964–2004)&quot;, they re-recorded some of their hits as well as some new songs. Jan Frisk, Charlotte Walker and Sven Hedlund occasionally play concerts together with guest musicians under the Hep Stars flag.

The album &quot;The Hep Stars&quot; (1966) is probably the most ABBA-related of the pre-ABBA period. It includes several songs written by Andersson and &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Easy To Say&quot;, the first joint composition by him and his new friend Ulvaeus, then a member of the acoustic group Hootenanny Singers, who mainly sang in the Swedish language. On the same album there was another song, &quot;No Time&quot;, written by Ulvaeus alone. &quot;No Time&quot; was also recorded by the Hootenanny Singers in an acoustic version. Andersson and Ulvaeus also wrote two songs for the album &quot;Hep Stars På Svenska&quot; – &quot;Speleman&quot; and &quot;Precis Som Alla Andra&quot; – and &quot;Flower in My Garden&quot;, which appeared on the album &quot;Songs We Sang 68&quot;.

Among the hits were &quot;I natt jag drömde&quot; (a Swedish version of &quot;Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream&quot;), Mike Berry&#x27;s &quot;A Tribute to Buddy Holly&quot; (#4, Sweden), &quot;Malaika&quot; (with lyrics in Swahili), &quot;Wedding&quot;, &quot;Consolation&quot;, &quot;Cadillac&quot; (#1, Sweden), &quot;Farmer John&quot; (#2, Sweden), &quot;No Response&quot; and &quot;Sunny Girl&quot;. The group&#x27;s last hit in 1969 was a cover of &quot;Speedy Gonzales&quot;.

<text>Baron Ashtown, of Moate in the County of Galway, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1800 for Frederick Trench, with remainder to the heirs male of his father. 

Trench had previously represented Portarlington from 1798 in the Irish House of Commons. He was succeeded according to the special remainder by his nephew, the second Baron (the son of Francis Trench) – see Frederick Trench, 2nd Baron Ashtown. His grandson, the third Baron (son of Frederic Sydney Charles Trench, eldest son of the second Baron), sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1908 to 1915. On the death of his younger son, the fifth Baron, this line of the family failed. The late Baron was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the sixth Baron. He was the grandson of the Hon. William Cosby Trench, younger brother of the third Baron. However, he never married and on his death in 1990 this branch of the family also failed. The title was inherited by his second cousin once removed, the seventh Baron. He was the grandson of Hon. Cosby Godolphin Trench, second son of the second Baron and served as Ambassador to South Korea and to Portugal. , the title is held by the seventh Baron&#x27;s son, the eighth Baron.

Another member of the Trench family was Sir David Clive Crosbie Trench, Governor of Hong Kong from 1964 to 1971. He was a descendant of John Trench, younger brother of the first Baron Ashtown.

The family seat was Woodlawn House, near Ballinasloe, County Galway. Woodlawn House was sold by the 4th Baron in 1947 and is still extant, although semi-derelict. It is currently in the process of being gradually restored.

<text>Gramm was an Icelandic record label created by Ásmundur Jónsson and Einar Örn Benediktsson in 1981.

Located in Reykjavík, Gramm’s first release was a 10-track 7&quot; vinyl titled &quot;Tilf&quot; by Purrkur Pillnikk, a punk group led by Einar Örn.

Besides releasing all Purrkur Pillnikk&#x27;s records, Gramm also issued works of artists like the English experimental group Psychic TV, Björk&#x27;s first band Tappi Tíkarrass and Kukl (featuring Björk and Einar Örn). Rock band Þeyr and punk groups such as Vonbrigði were also associated with Gramm.

In 1987, Gramm went bankrupt. Ásmundur and some of the musicians who were playing in Kukl created Smekkleysa, which ultimately became Bad Taste, known worldwide by the Sugarcubes.

Minatitlán is home to the &quot;Refinería Gral. Lázaro Cárdenas del Río&quot; (now named for President Lázaro Cárdenas) a 1906 oil refinery that was the first such facility built in Latin America. The refinery underwent an expansion that started in 2003 to bring the capacity of the plant up to 240,000 barrels per day, up from its previous capacity of 185,000 barrels per day.

It is a sister city of Minatitlán, in the state of Colima, on the other side of the country.
The local economy is largely dependent on the oil industry and trade.

The Feria del Café y Minería (Coffee and Mining Fair) is held each year in January.

<text>The Mountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (; ) or Mountain ASSR () was a short-lived autonomous republic within the Russian SFSR in the Northern Caucasus that existed from 20 January 1921, to 7 July 1924.
The Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus was created from parts of the Kuban and Terek Oblasts by the indigenous nationalities after the Russian Revolution; however, Soviet rule was installed on this territory after the Red Army conquered the Northern Caucasus in the course of the Russian Civil War, and the former republic was transformed into a Soviet one. The area of the republic was over , and the population was about 800,000. It comprised six okrugs: Balkar, Chechen, Kabardian, Karachay, Nazran (Ingushetia), and Vladikavkaz Okrug (Ossetia) and had two cities: Grozny and Vladikavkaz. In addition, a special autonomy was provided to the Terek Cossacks: Sunzha Cossack Okrug, which included a large enclave in northern Ingushetia, and a smaller one bordering Grozny. Its boundaries approximated those of classical Zyx.

The ASSR did not exist in its original state very long. Already on 1 September 1921, Kabardin Okrug was split from the ASSR as separate Kabardin Autonomous Oblast, subordinated directly to the RSFSR. Next came Karachay Okrug, which was transformed into Karachay-Cherkess Autonomous Oblast on 12 January 1922; Balkar Okrug, which was merged with Kabardin AO into Kabardino-Balkarian Autonomous Oblast on 16 January 1922; and Chechen Okrug, which was transformed into the Chechen Autonomous Oblast on 30 November 1922.

By the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of 7 July 1924, the remaining territory of the ASSR was partitioned into the North Ossetian Autonomous Oblast and the Ingush Autonomous Oblast. The Sunzha Cossack Okrug and the city of Vladikavkaz were directly subordinated to the VTsIK until 17 October 1924, when North Caucasus Krai was formed and integrated all of the former ASSR in addition to those two units.

In the 19th century, the best land in the region was given to Cossacks, Russian and Ukrainian military colonizers, while many natives were driven to the mountains. In 1920, the Soviet government decided to deport the Terek Cossacks and give their farms to the natives. A total of 34,637 individuals were deported to Vladikavkaz, Arkhangelsk and Donbas. Hundreds of families were later found to be supporters of the Soviet government. In January 1921, the forced resettlement of the Cossacks was stopped, and some families returned to occupy abandoned farms, but the densely-populated line of Tsarist-era military settlements was erased from the North Caucasus forever and the natives were free to occupy the fertile lands on the valley floors. In 1882, 24.7% of the Ingush lived in the mountains, but by 1924 only 2.1% did.

During the Cold War, many Western historians saw the disintegration of the Mountaineer Republic as a divide-and-conquer strategy by the Soviet government to keep the peoples of the Caucasus weak and subjugated to Moscow. The Soviet archives that became public in the 1990s have shown this not to be the case. The disintegration of the republic started in March 1921, just two months after its creation, when the leaders of Kabarda expressed their discontent at having been made part of the republic and cited the absence of economic links between the Kabards and other Mountaineer peoples. From April to June 1921, Kabarda held a congress at which 140 delegates, only 28 of the Bolsheviks, had overwhelmingly voted not just to become an autonomous oblast, but to also demand autonomous republic status. Joseph Stalin had to talk the leader of the Kabards, Betal Kalmykov, out of applying for a full union republic status.

<text>Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra or Kyievo-Pecherska Lavra (), also known as the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves, is a historic Eastern Orthodox Christian monastery which gave its name to one of the city districts where it is located in Kyiv.

Since its foundation as the cave monastery in 1051, the Lavra has been a preeminent center of Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Eastern Europe.

==Etymology and other names==
In Ukrainian, the word &quot;pechera&quot; (in Ukrainian Cyrillic печера) means &quot;cave&quot; which itself came from Proto-Slavic &quot;*реktera&quot; that means &quot;cave&quot; as well. The word &quot;lavra&quot; is used to describe high-ranking male monasteries for monks of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Therefore, the name of the monastery is also translated as Kyiv Cave Monastery, Kyiv Caves Monastery or the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves (&quot;на печерах&quot;).

== History ==
=== Foundation and early history ===
The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; contains contradictory information as to when the monastery was founded: in 1051, or in 1074. Anthony, a Christian monk from Esphigmenon monastery on Mount Athos, originally from Liubech of the Principality of Chernigov, returned to Rus&#x27; and settled in Kyiv as a missionary of monastic tradition to Kyivan Rus&#x27;. He chose a cave at the Berestov Mount that overlooked the Dnieper River and a community of disciples soon grew. Prince Iziaslav I of Kyiv (1024–1078) ceded the whole mount to the Anthonite monks who founded a monastery built by architects from Constantinople.

At the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra were buried some high-importance personalities from the period when Kyiv was a part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania: Prince of Kyiv Vladimir Olgerdovich and his son Aleksandr Olelka, the Lithuanian and Ruthenian Grand Duke Švitrigaila, Feodor Ostrogski, Uliana Olshanska (a second wife of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Vytautas the Great), and the Lithuanian Grand Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski, known for commanding the Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army in the victorious Battle of Orsha (1514) versus the Grand Principality of Moscow Army.

=== Modern history ===
Together with the Saint Sophia Cathedral, the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990. The monastery complex is considered a separate national historic-cultural preserve (sanctuary), the national status to which was granted on 13 March 1996. The Lavra is not only located in another part of the city, but is part of a different national sanctuary than Saint Sophia Cathedral. While being a cultural attraction, the monastery is once again active, with over 100 monks in residence. It was named one of the Seven Wonders of Ukraine on 21 August 2007.

Until the end of 2022, jurisdiction over the site had been divided between the state museum, National Kyiv-Pechersk Historic-Cultural Preserve, and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) (UOC-MP) as the site of the chief monastery of that Church and the residence of its leader, Onufrius, Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine. In January 2023, the Ukrainian government terminated the UOC-MP&#x27;s lease of the Dormition Cathedral and the Refectory Church (also known as the Trapezna Church), returning those properties to direct state control. It also announced that the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) had been granted permission to celebrate a Christmas service in the Dormition Cathedral, on 7 January 2023, Orthodox Christmas by the Old Calendar, a service which was celebrated by Metropolitan Epiphanius at 9am that day.

On 10 March 2023, the National Kyiv-Pechersk Historic-Cultural Preserve announced that the 2013 agreement on the free use of churches by the UOC-MP would be terminated on the grounds that the church had violated their lease by making alterations to the historic site, and other technical infractions. The UOC-MP was ordered to leave the territory by 29 March. The UOC-MP answered back that there were no legal grounds for the eviction and called it &quot;a whim of officials from the Ministry of Culture.&quot; On 17 March 2023 Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary for Russian President Vladimir Putin, stated that the decision of the Ukrainian authorities not to extend this lease to representatives of the UOC-MP &quot;confirms the correctness&quot; of the (24 February 2022) Russian invasion of Ukraine. The UOC-MP did not fully leave Kyiv Pechersk Lavra following 29 March 2023.

==Hegumens==

The hegumens of Kyiv Pechersk Lavra are listed below.
==Buildings and structures==

The Kyiv Pechersk Lavra contains numerous architectural monuments, ranging from bell towers to cathedrals to cave systems and to strong stone fortification walls. The main attractions of the Lavra include the Great Lavra Belltower, and the Dormition Cathedral, destroyed in fighting the Germans World War II, and fully reconstructed in the 1990s after the fall of Soviet Union by Ukraine.

Other churches and cathedrals of the Lavra include: the Refectory Church, the Church of All Saints, the Church of the Saviour at Berestove, the Church of the Exaltation of Cross, the Church of the Trinity, the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin, the Church of the Conception of St. Anne, and the Church of the Life-Giving Spring. The Lavra also contains many other constructions, including: the St. Nicholas Monastery, the Kyiv Theological Academy and Seminary, and the Debosquette Wall.

===Great Lavra Belltower===
The Great Lavra Belltower is one of the most notable features of the Kyiv skyline and among the main attractions of the Lavra. 96.5 meters in height, it was the tallest free-standing belltower at the time of its construction in 1731–1745, and was designed by the architect Johann Gottfried Schädel. It is a Classical style construction and consists of tiers, surmounted by a gilded dome.

===Dormition Cathedral===

Built in the 11th century, the main church of the monastery was destroyed during the World War II, a couple of months after the Nazi Germany troops occupied the city of Kyiv, during which the Soviet Union conducted the controversial 1941 Khreshchatyk explosions. Withdrawing Soviet troops practiced the tactics of scorched earth and blew up all the Kyiv bridges over Dnieper as well as the main Khreshchatyk street and Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. The destruction of the cathedral followed a pattern of Soviet disregard for cultural heritage, as they previously blew up the ancient St. Michael&#x27;s Golden-Domed Monastery nearby in the 1930s.

In 1928, the monastery was converted into an anti-religious museum park by the Soviet authorities and after their return no efforts were provided to restore the church. The temple was finally restored in 1995 after Ukraine obtained its independence and the construction was accomplished in two years. The new Dormition Church was consecrated in 2000.

===Gate Church of the Trinity===
The Gate Church of the Trinity is located atop the Holy Gates, which houses the entrance to the monastery. According to a legend, this church was founded by the Chernihiv Prince Sviatoslav II. It was built atop an ancient stone church which used to stand in its place.
After the fire of 1718, the church was rebuilt, its revered facades and interior walls enriched with ornate stucco work made by craftsman V. Stefaovych.
In the 18th century, a new gilded pear-shaped dome was built, the facade and exterior walls were decorated with stucco-moulded plant ornaments and a vestibule built of stone attached to the north end. In the early 20th century, the fronts and the walls flanking the entrance were painted by icon painters under the guidance of V. Sonin. The interior of the Gate Trinity Church contains murals by the early 18th century painter Alimpy Galik.

===Refectory chambers with Church of the Saints Anthony and Theodosius===
The refectory chambers with the Church of the Saints Anthony and Theodosius is the third in a series of temples. The original temple was built in the 12th century and no drawings or visual depictions of it remain. The second temple was built at the time of the Cossack Hetmanate and was disassembled by the Russian authorities in the 19th century. It was replaced with the current temple, often referred to as the Refectory Church of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra.

===The All Saints Church===
The All Saints Church, erected in 1696–1698, is a fine specimen of Ukrainian baroque architecture. Characteristic of the church facades are rich architectural embellishments. In 1905, students of the Lavra art school painted the interior walls of the church. The carved wooden iconostasis is multi-tiered and was made for the All Saints church in the early 18th century.

===Church of the Saviour at Berestove===

The Church of the Saviour at Berestove is located to the North of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. It was constructed in the village of Berestove around the start of the 11th century during the reign of Prince Vladimir Monomakh. It later served as the mausoleum of the Monomakh dynasty, also including Yuri Dolgoruki, the founder of Moscow. Despite being outside the Lavra fortifications, the Church of the Saviour at Berestove is part of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex.
===Caves===
The Kyiv Pechersk Lavra caverns are a system of narrow underground corridors (about 1-1½ metres wide and 2-2½ metres high), along with numerous living quarters and underground chapels. In 1051, the monk Anthony settled in an old cave in a hill near the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. This cave received additions including corridors and a church, and is now the Far Caves. In 1057, Anthony moved to a cave near the Upper Lavra, now called the Near Caves.

Foreign travellers in the 16th–17th centuries wrote that the catacombs of the Lavra stretched for hundreds of kilometres, reaching as far as Moscow and Novgorod, spreading awareness of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra.

===Library===
The notable library of the Lavra was burned during the reign of Peter the Great. On the night of April 21-22, 1718, Orthodox monks — tsarist agents — set fire to the premises of the Lavra, where its library and archive with unique documents and books from the historical past of Ukraine were located.

In 1988, after the restoration of the monastery&#x27;s activities, library work was resumed. The funds began to be replenished with those publications that the Lavra monks and parishioners managed to save. New books began to be purchased, and some of the books that began to be published by the Lavra printing house restored in 1995 were transferred to the library.

Over 20 years of activity after the revival of the monastery, more than 10 thousand volumes were collected. In 2008, the library was moved to premises that allow the best placement and organization of library funds. Accounting and cataloging of the Lavra library funds were digitized.

===Necropolis===
There are over a hundred burials in the Lavra. Below are the most notable ones
* Ilya Muromets – in the caves (c. 11th–12th century)
* Nestor the Chronicler – in the Near Caves (c. 1114)

* St. Spyridon – in the caves (c. 19th–20th century)
* Pope Clement I – his head in the Far Caves (his remaining relics brought to San Clemente in Rome by Sts. Cyril and Methodius)

During the Soviet era, the bodies of the saints that lay in the caves were left uncovered due to the regime&#x27;s disregard for religion. However, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the bodies were covered with a cloth and to this day remain in the same state.

==Museum==
The Kyiv Pechersk Lavra is one of the largest museums in Kyiv. The exposition is the actual ensemble of the Upper (Near Caves) and Lower (Far Caves) Lavra territories, which house many architectural relics of the past. The collection within the churches and caves includes articles of precious metal, prints, higher clergy portraits and rare church hierarchy photographs. The main exposition contains articles from 16th to early 20th centuries, which include chalices, crucifixes, and textiles from 16th–19th centuries, with needlework and embroidery of Ukrainian masters. The remainder of the collection consists of pieces from the Lavra&#x27;s Printing House and the Lavra&#x27;s Icon Painting Workshop.

The museum provides tours of the catacombs, which contain remains of Eastern Orthodox saints or their relics. The Caves are of geological interest because they are excavated into loess ground. They form one of the most extensive occurrences of loess caves in the world.

The Lavra museums include:
*Museum of Historical Treasures of Ukraine
**Martynivka Treasure
*Book and print history museum
*Museum of Ukrainian Folk Art
*Theater and film arts museum
*State historical library

<text>The North Platte River is a major tributary of the Platte River and is approximately long, counting its many curves. In a straight line, it travels about , along its course through the U.S. states of Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska.

The head of the river is essentially all of Jackson County, Colorado, whose boundaries are the continental divide on the west and south and the mountain drainage peaks on the east—the north boundary is the state of Wyoming border. The rugged Rocky Mountains surrounding Jackson County have at least twelve peaks over in height. From Jackson County the river flows north about out of the Routt National Forest and North Park (Colorado basin) near what is now Walden, Colorado, to Casper, Wyoming. Shortly after passing Casper, the river turns to the east-southeast and flows about to the city of North Platte, Nebraska.

The North Platte and South Platte River join to form the Platte River in western Nebraska near the city of North Platte, Nebraska. The Platte River flows to the Missouri River, which joins the Mississippi River to flow to the Gulf of Mexico. The river provides the major avenue of drainage for northern Colorado, eastern Wyoming and western Nebraska. It is only navigable over most of its length at high water by canoes, kayaks and rubber rafts.

==History as a trail west==
The North Platte River drainage has been an important westward route in the westward expansion of the United States. To get the two essentials, water and grass, for the traveler&#x27;s animals the emigration trails nearly always followed river valleys across the North American continent. These trails extended from the Missouri River, Platte River and North Platte River across Nebraska and parts of Wyoming and on to its confluence with the Sweetwater River. About beyond what is now Casper, Wyoming the main emigration trails left the North Platte valley and followed the Sweetwater River valley and other river valleys going further west.

The trail route along the North Platte River was first written about by Wilson Price Hunt of the Astor Expedition who was traveling back to the Missouri River from the newly established Fort Astoria on the Columbia River in 1811. The lack of American trappers and settlers in the contested Oregon Territory resulted in this early discovery being unused and nearly forgotten. Jedediah Smith and several trappers in 1823 rediscovered the route and the trail along the Platte, North Platte and Sweetwater Rivers became a major trail to the fur trader’s summer time Rocky Mountain Rendezvous. Mule trains carrying in trading supplies for the mountain men and fur trappers were some of the first to use the trail in 1824. The fur traders on their return trip carried the traded furs back east at the end of the summer trading season. This fur trade route continued to be used to about 1840. By about 1832 the trail along the Platte, North Platte, and Sweetwater Rivers had been improved by the fur traders to a rough wagon trail from the Missouri River to the Green River in Wyoming where most of the Rocky Mountain Rendezvous occurred. Following the fur traders, the major emigration trails established along the north and south banks of the North Platte River were the Oregon (1843–1869), California (1843–1869), Mormon (1847–1869) and the Bozeman (1863–68) Trails. The trails north of the North Platte River originally crossed the North Platte near Fort Laramie to join the original Oregon and California Trail Route on the south side. In 1850 Child&#x27;s Route (Child&#x27;s Cutoff) extended the north side trail to what is now Casper, Wyoming. The rugged territory from Fort Laramie, Wyoming to Casper meant that the trails often deviated from the river to find an easier path and relied on streams draining into the North Platte for water.

==River description==
Up in central north Colorado rests North Park (Colorado basin), a valley ringed by mountains. The headwaters of the river is essentially all of Jackson County, Colorado whose boundaries are the continental divide on the west and south and the mountain drainage peaks on the east—the north boundary is the state of Wyoming boundary. The rugged Rocky Mountains Continental Divide surrounding Jackson County have at least twelve peaks over in height. These peaks include on the west: Mount Zirkel , Lost ranger Peak and Mount Ethel ; on the south: Sheep Mountain and Parkview Mountain —whose waters on the south or east side drain into the North Platte River drainage. On the east are: Mount Nimbus , Mount Cumulus , Howard Mountain , Mount Cirrus , Mount Richthofen , Lead Mountain , North Diamond Peak and Clark Peak whose eastern slope waters drain into the North Platte River.

In Jackson county the North Platte is joined by several other small streams draining the mountains around the county. Some of these creeks are: Arapaho Creek, Colorado Creek, East Branch Illinois River, Jack Creek, Jewell Lake Trib., Grizzly Creek, Little Grizzly Creek, Norris Creek, North Fork of North Platte River, Rock Creek (Little Willow Ck), South Fork Canadian River, South Fork Michigan River, Willow Creek and in Wyoming the Encampment River. All these streams are draining the snow melt form the mountains surrounding Jackson County. The North Platte River flows northward from Colorado into Wyoming through the popular rafting site – Northgate Canyon which is along the western side of the Medicine Bow Mountains.

In Colorado and Wyoming, the river is narrower and much swifter flowing than it is in Nebraska, where it becomes a slow flowing, shallow braided stream. The upper reaches of the river in the Rockies in Colorado and Wyoming are popular for recreation rafting and fly fishing on the river and its many tributaries for rainbow trout and other sport fish. In western Nebraska, the banks and riverbed of the North Platte provide a green oasis amid an otherwise semi-arid region of North America.

The river has been dammed several times to form several reservoirs along its course. On the north end of the Park range it is joined by the Medicine Bow River in the Seminoe Reservoir formed by Seminoe Dam, further downstream is the Kortes Reservoir. Still further downstream about above Casper the North Platte is joined by the Sweetwater River to form the Pathfinder Reservoir. Northeast of the Pathfinder Reservoir it passes through the Alcova and Gray Reef reservoirs before it hits Casper. Casper was established in 1888 east of the former site of Fort Caspar, which was built about 1859 during the mass migration along the Oregon, California, Mormon and Bozeman trails. Near what is now Casper was the location of several ferries that offered passage across the North Platte River during the summer &quot;Trail season&quot; starting about 1847. In 1847, during the first Mormon emigration, Brigham Young leading the Mormon settlers to Salt Lake City, Utah established a ferry near present-day Casper known as the Mormon Ferry. The next year the ferry was moved a few miles down river. Soon competing ferries were built. In 1859, Louis Guinard built a toll bridge across the North Platte and a trading post near the original ferry&#x27;s locations. Before reaching Casper the river turns and flows northeast between the Granite Mountains to the west and the Laramie Mountains to the east.

The North Platte emerges from the mountains near Casper, where it turns and flows east-southeast, along the northern edge of the Laramie Mountains onto the Great Plains. The North Platte flows east-southeast across the plains of eastern Wyoming, past the town of Douglas, Wyoming and through Glendo and Guernsey Reservoirs. It then flows past the Fort Laramie National Historic Site (the former site of Fort Laramie), where it is joined by the Laramie River. The North Platte is joined by Horse Creek flowing in from Wyoming near the Wyoming-Nebraska border as its last significant addition. It crosses into western Nebraska, flowing east-southeast between the cities of Scottsbluff, Nebraska and Gering, Nebraska. In Keith County, Nebraska, the Kingsley Dam forms Lake C.W. McConaughy, the largest reservoir in Nebraska and a significant irrigation and recreation facility for the region. Kingsley Dam, constructed in 1935 to 1941, is located on the east side of Lake McConaughy in central Keith County, Nebraska, and is the second largest hydraulic fill dam in the world. East of the Kingsley dam the North Platte River flows nearly parallel to the South Platte River. In many places they are separated by only about 5 mi (8 km) for a stretch of about 50 mi (80 km) before they join to form the Platte River just east of the city of North Platte, Nebraska.

The wagon trails following the south side of the Platte/North Platte River ferried or waded in low water years across the South Platte River in several places to stay on the south side of the North Platte River where the trails were located. Those who later went on to Denver, Colorado followed the South Platte River trail into Colorado. Historically, the North Platte River used to be up to a mile wide (1.6 km) in many places as evidenced by the old streambed and written records. Today, by the time the North Platte reaches Paxton, Nebraska it is much smaller due to the extensive water taken from it for irrigation.

<text>The Connecticut Colony, originally known as the Connecticut River Colony, was an English colony in New England which later became the state of Connecticut. It was organized on March 3, 1636, as a settlement for a Puritan congregation of settlers from the Massachusetts Bay Colony led by Thomas Hooker. The English would secure their control of the region in the Pequot War. Over the course of the colony&#x27;s history it would absorb the neighboring New Haven and Saybrook colonies. The colony was part of the briefly-lived Dominion of New England. The colony&#x27;s founding document, the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut has been called the first written constitution of a democratic government, earning Connecticut the nickname &quot;The Constitution State&quot;.

== History ==
Prior to European settlement, the land that would become Connecticut was home to the Wappinger Confederacy along the western coast and the Niantics on the eastern coast. Further inland were the Pequot, who pushed the Niantic to the coast and would become the most important tribe in relations with colonists. Also present were the Nipmunks and Mohicans, though these two tribes largely lived in the neighboring states of Massachusetts and New York respectively. The first European to visit Connecticut was Dutch explorer Adriaen Block, who sailed up the Connecticut River with his yacht &quot;Onrust&quot;. Accordingly, as the first Europeans to explore Connecticut, the Dutch claimed the land as part of New Netherland and negotiated a land purchase of 20 acres along the river from Wopigwooit, the Grand Sachem of the Pequot in 1633. The Dutch would establish a trading post named Kivett&#x27;s Point and a redoubt named Fort Good Hope, the future sites of Saybrook and Hartford respectively.

===English settlement===
In 1631, a group of sachems from the Connecticut valley led by Wahquimacut visited Plymouth Colony and Boston, asking both colonies to send settlers to Connecticut to fight the Pequot. Massachusetts governor John Winthrop rejected the proposal but Edward Winslow, governor of Plymouth was more open, traveling to Connecticut in person in 1632. Winslow, along with William Bradford would later travel to Boston to convince the leaders of Massachusetts Bay to join Plymouth in constructing a trading post on the Connecticut River before the Dutch could. Winthrop rejected the offer, calling Connecticut &quot;not fit to meddle with&quot; citing hostile Indians and the difficulty of moving large ships into the Connecticut River.

Despite the Bay Colony&#x27;s refusal to join the venture, Plymouth sent a bark led by William Holmes to establish a trading post on the Connecticut. Besides the English settlers, they took some of the original sachems of the area to prove the validity of their claim. As they passed Fort Good Hope they were threatened by the Dutch, a threat ignored by Holmes. Holmes proceeded a few miles up river and constructed a trading post on the modern site of Windsor. Hearing of the English activities, New Netherland governor Wouter Van Twiller dispatched 70 men to dislodge the English. The Dutch would find the English well prepared to defend themselves and left, seeking to avoid bloodshed. Meanwhile, John Oldham led a group of men from the Bay Colony to the river to see Connecticut for themselves. They returned with accounts of plentiful beaver, hemp, and graphite. A year later, Oldham would lead a group of settlers to found the town of Wethersfield.

By 1635, Massachusetts&#x27; English population had grown immensely and it was clear there was not enough land for the settlers. Particularly eager to leave the crowded Bay colony were the residents of Newtown. The founder of Newtown, Thomas Dudley was frequently at odds with Winthrop, including anger at the choice of Boston as the colony&#x27;s capital and refusal to support the construction of a fort in Boston. Dudley sent one Thomas Hooker, Newtown&#x27;s pastor to Boston to resolve the latter dispute, but the resentment of Winthrop remained. After Dudley replaced Winthrop as governor in May 1634, the issue of Hooker&#x27;s congregation&#x27;s desire for removal to Connecticut was raised in the General Court. Opponents of the removal countered with a proposal that settlers instead settle Agawam and Merrimack. Both sites proved unsatisfactory, but removal was nonetheless delayed for two years.

Despite the refusal of Thomas Hooker&#x27;s request for removal, settlers continued to pour into the valley. In May 1635 the Saybrook Colony was established at the mouth of the Connecticut River. Considerable amounts of emigrants from Massachusetts also settled in the recently established town of Wethersfield. Plymouth&#x27;s settlement of Windsor also found itself swamped by settlers from Dorchester who took over the settlement. The issue was resolved when the Dorchester settlers agreed to pay the Plymouth settlers for the land appropriated. Finally in 1636 the arrival of a new group of settlers allowed Hooker&#x27;s congregation to sell their homes and set off on the journey to Connecticut on the May 31.

Hooker&#x27;s group of around a hundred settlers and as many cattle soon arrived at the Connecticut River and established the town of Newtown near the Dutch fort. This name would not last however, as it was soon renamed Hartford after Hertford, the hometown of settler Samuel Stone. In May 1638 Thomas Hooker delivered a sermon on civil government. Inspired by this sermon the settlers sought to create a constitution for the colony. The resulting document, the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, was likely mostly drafted by Roger Ludlow, the only trained lawyer in the colonies. The document was adopted in January 1639 and formally united the settlements of Hartford, Windsor, and Wetherfield together and has been called the first written democratic constitution. Under the new constitution, John Haynes was elected governor with Ludlow as deputy governor. Owing to a restriction against governors seeking office in consecutive years, Haynes would alternate the office of governor with Edward Hopkins every year until 1655. Shortly after the Fundamental Orders were established, the nearby New Haven colony organized its own government.

===Pequot War===

When Fort Good Hope was constructed, the Dutch specified in their treaty with the Pequot that the trading post was to be open to all tribes. Ignoring this, the Pequot attacked a rival tribe attempting to trade. The Dutch retaliated by kidnapping the sachem of the Pequot, Tatobem and holding him for ransom. After the Pequot paid the ransom, the Dutch gave them Tatobem&#x27;s corpse. The Pequot retaliated for this by attacking an English ship, believing it to be Dutch. The ship&#x27;s captain, John Stone, and his crew were killed by the Pequot. A Pequot envoy was sent to Massachusetts to explain the misunderstanding. The envoy told the English about the mistaken identity of the ship. When asked to turn over the killers, the envoy claimed all but two of the killers had died of a recent smallpox epidemic and they lacked the authority to turn over the two survivors. The Pequot further claimed the killing was justified as Stone had captured two Pequots and mistreated them. When John Gallup was sailing to Long Island he spotted a pinnace belonging to John Oldham, its deck covered with Indians. When Gallup attempted to board the ship to investigate, a fight ensued with Gallup victorious. The colonists blamed the Narragansett for the killing, warning Roger Williams to be careful. The Narragansett leaders Canonicus and Miantonomoh were able to reassure the colonist, claiming that the culprits not killed by Gallup were hiding among the Pequot. 

After this a group of ninety men led by John Endecott and his captains John Underhill and Nathaniel Turner was sent from Massachusetts to the Pequot&#x27;s territory to demand the return of the murderers of both Stone and Oldham. The force first sailed to Block Island, but the Indians evaded them there and the force left with the only casualty inflicted on the villagers being the burning of the island&#x27;s empty villages. When the forced arrived in Pequot territory, they were told that the murder was committed by none other than Sassacus, grand sachem of the Pequot. The Pequot also claimed to be unable to distinguish the Dutch from the English. Disbelieving these claims and seeing there were no women or children among the Pequot, Endecott attacked, beginning the war. The Pequot responded by besieging Saybrook and attacking Wethersfield, where they would kill nine and take two women hostage. The women were daughters of William Swaine and would later be rescued by the Dutch.

Connecticut sent a force of ninety men, led by John Mason. The force was joined by sixty Mohegans led by Uncas and came to Saybrook where a group of Massachusetts men led by Underhill joined them. On May 26, 1637, the group, encamped outside a fortified Pequot village on the Mystic River, launched a surprise attack at dawn. The English charged into the village, set it on fire, and formed a ring around the stockades to kill anyone attempting to escape. The Indian allies formed a second ring to catch anyone who managed to escape the first. Hundreds of Pequots died, many of the women and children.

Their spirits broken, many of the Pequot attempted to flee west. Mason, accompanied by Israel Stoughton pursued a group of three hundred Pequots to a swamp near modern Fairfield, where they killed and captured a great number of them. Sassacus was able to escape to the Mohawks, who immediately killed him and his party, sending his scalp to Boston. With the Pequots vanquished the Treaty of Hartford was signed between Connecticut, the Mohegans, and the Narragansett, granting the Connecticut settlers the exclusive right to the former Pequot land and dissolving the Pequot as both a political and cultural entity, with surviving Pequots made to assimilate into the other tribes.

===Consolidating the colony===
With the English Civil War outbreak, English support for the Saybrook Colony dried up. The colony&#x27;s governor, George Fenwick negotiated a deal to sell the colony to Connecticut in 1644. Fenwick would return to England and serve with distinction under Oliver Cromwell. Inspired by the successes of colonial cooperation during the Pequot War, Connecticut, along with Massachusetts, Plymouth, and New Haven formed the New England Confederation to mutually defend the colonies against the Dutch, French, and Indians. Before leaving for England, Fenwick, along with Hopkins, would serve as Connecticut&#x27;s first commissioner to the Confederation. Connecticut&#x27;s membership in the Confederation also meant it sent troops to fight in King Philip&#x27;s War, though Connecticut itself was minimally impacted.

Like its fellow Puritan colonies, Connecticut would welcome Cromwell&#x27;s victory in the Civil War The new English government, however, would soon cause issues for Connecticut. The Confederation negotiated the Treaty of Hartford defining the border between New Netherland and the English colonies, but the government in England refused to ratify it. Tensions with the Dutch would be inflamed by the Navigation Act 1651, restricting foreign trade with the colonies. These tensions would culminate in the First Anglo-Dutch War. The war&#x27;s outbreak enabled Connecticut to seize Fort Good Hope in 1653.

After the restoration of the Stuart monarchy, many in Connecticut feared their colony&#x27;s Puritanism and lack of a royal charter would lead to Charles II curtailing the colony&#x27;s self-government. Governor John Winthrop Jr. was sent to England in 1662 where he successfully obtained a charter. The charter granted Connecticut extensive liberties, with the removal of references to royalty being the only change required in the aftermath of the American Revolution. The charter also granted Connecticut extensive land claims, defining its borders as the Narragansett Bay, the Pacific Ocean, the southern border of Massachusetts and the 40th parallel north. When representatives of Connecticut traveled to New Haven to show them that they were to be annexed into Connecticut, they initially met strong opposition. This opposition faded in 1664 when New Netherland was seized and renamed New York after its proprietor, the Roman Catholic Duke of York. New York&#x27;s eastern boundary was defined as the Connecticut River, making New Haven within New York&#x27;s and Connecticut&#x27;s claims. Unwilling to be ruled by a Catholic royalist, New Haven relented and agreed to join Connecticut. The aforementioned seizure of New Netherland would also end Connecticut&#x27;s claims on Long Island, as when Captain John Scott took the island he claimed it not for Connecticut but for himself.

===Dominion of New England===

The Duke of York would ascend to the throne as King James II and VII. As one of his first acts, he would consolidate the English colonies from West Jersey to Maine into the Dominion of New England. Sir Edmund Andros would be appointed governor of the new united colony. Andros demanded that Connecticut hand over its charter as it was no longer a separate colony. Governor Robert Treat attempted to delay handing over the charter for several months, but on October 31, 1687, Andros came to Hartford to retrieve the charter in person. Treat proceeded to give a speech well into the evening on the importance of the charter. Suddenly, a strong gust of wind came through the door, blowing out the candles. By the time the candles were relit, the charter had vanished, safely hidden away in a nearby oak tree. The tree, which became known as the Charter Oak would endure as a symbol of Connecticut for generations. Andros replaced Puritan officials with Anglicans and imposed heavy taxes. His salary of £1,200 exceeded the entire annual expenditure of Massachusetts&#x27; former government. When James II was overthrown in the Glorious Revolution, Andros initially attempted to suppress the news. Word did get out, and the colonists overthrew the dominion casting its government as crypto-Catholic supports of James II and themselves as loyal to the new Protestant monarchs of William III and Mary II. The dominion&#x27;s short-lived experiment in centralized government ended and Connecticut, along with all the other colonies, had its charter restored.

===Later history===

In 1701, New Haven was designated co-capital with Hartford. At the first legislative session in New Haven to create a college for the colony, with Saybrook as the site and Abraham Pierson as the first rector. Pierson would run the college from his home in Killingworth until his death in 1707, when it was finally moved to Saybrook. Saybrook would soon prove to be too remote and New Haven was able to beat out other communities for the site of the college in 1716. Two years later, when Elihu Yale made a significant donation to the college, it was renamed Yale College in his honor.

The &quot;Connecticut Courant&quot;, the oldest continuously published newspaper in the United States, was founded in Hartford in 1764.

Connecticut was a staunch supporter of the American Revolution, with a fifth of the state&#x27;s male population serving in the war. Jonathan Trumbull was the only colonial governor to support the patriots. Nathan Hale, the first American spy, also hailed from the colony.

==Religion==
The original colonies along the Connecticut River and in New Haven were established by separatist Puritans who were connected with the Massachusetts and Plymouth colonies. They held Calvinist religious beliefs similar to the English Puritans, but they maintained that their congregations needed to be separated from the English state church. They had immigrated to New England during the Great Migration. In the middle of the 18th century, the government restricted voting rights with a property qualification and a church membership requirement. Congregationalism was the established church in the colony by the time of the American War of Independence until it was disestablished in 1818.

== Economic and social history ==
The economy began with subsistence farming in the 17th century and developed with greater diversity and an increased focus on production for distant markets, especially the British colonies in the Caribbean. The American Revolution cut off imports from Britain and stimulated a manufacturing sector that made heavy use of the entrepreneurship and mechanical skills of the people. In the second half of the 18th century, difficulties arose from the shortage of good farmland, periodic money problems, and downward price pressures in the export market. In agriculture, there was a shift from grain to animal products. The colonial government attempted to promote various commodities as export items from time to time, such as hemp, potash, and lumber, in order to bolster its economy and improve its balance of trade with Great Britain.

Connecticut&#x27;s domestic architecture included a wide variety of house forms. They generally reflected the dominant English heritage and architectural tradition.

<doc id="478843" wikidata="Q2320931" url="?curid=478843" title="The Best of Both Worlds (Jay-Z and R. Kelly album)">
<text>The Best of Both Worlds is the first collaborative album by R. Kelly and Jay-Z. It was released on March 19, 2002, through Jive Records, Roc-A-Fella and The Island Def Jam Music Group. The album was produced primarily by R. Kelly and Poke and Tone, with additional production by Megahertz and Charlemagne. The album features guest appearances by Beanie Siegel, Lil&#x27; Kim, and Devin the Dude.

&quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; was supported by three singles: &quot;Honey&quot;, &quot;Get This Money&quot; and &quot;Take You Home with Me a.k.a. Body&quot;. The album debuted at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 223,000 copies in its first week. Despite this, critical reception was generally mixed.

==Singles==
The album spawned three singles from its songs. The first single, &quot;Honey&quot; was released on January 16, 2002 as the lead single for the album. It was produced by R. Kelly and Poke and Tone. The song contains a sample of &quot;Love You Inside Out&quot; by the Bee Gees. The single failed to chart on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 but managed to peak at number 35 on the UK Singles Chart. The second single, &quot;Get this Money&quot; was released in March 2002. The third single, &quot;Take You Home with Me a.k.a. Body&quot; was released on May 21, 2002. Both of which failed to chart.

==Critical reception==
The album received generally mixed reviews from music critics. Some critics praised the album while others gave it poor reviews. Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic stated that &quot;while the idea of a collaborative album was a reasonable one, the album falls terribly short of both artists&#x27; high standards&quot;. He also called the album uninspired and claims it &quot;rates among the poorest efforts -- arguably the poorest -- in either Kelly&#x27;s or Jay-Z&#x27;s catalog to date.&quot; He gave the album a two star rating out of five.

Steve Jones of USA Today gave the album a better review, calling the album &quot;falls short of genius&quot;. He claims &quot;The two charismatic hitmakers mesh well and represent for their respective genres.&quot; In addition, he also believes that &quot;They don&#x27;t, however, really push each other to the next level or break the ground you might expect from this kind of meeting of the minds.&quot; He gave the album three out of four stars.

In retrospect, Jay-Z said: &quot;I think the first &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; is amazing&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; debuted at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 223,000 copies in its first week. This became Jay-Z&#x27;s fifth US top-ten album and R. Kelly&#x27;s fifth on the chart. In its second week, the album dropped to number four on the chart, selling an additional 137,000 copies. In its third week, the album dropped to number six on the chart, selling 82,000 more copies. On May 14, 2002, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over one million copies. In 2002, &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; was ranked as the 99th most popular album in the US. As of November 2004, the album has sold 875,000 copies in the United States.

<doc id="478844" wikidata="Q2258213" url="?curid=478844" title="Virtua Fighter 4">
<text>is a fighting video game developed and published by Sega for arcades. It is the fourth game installment in the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series. It was first released in arcades on the NAOMI 2 board followed by a console port as well as &quot;Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution&quot; on the PlayStation 2 under the budget-priced &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; label in 2002 and 2003, respectively.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot; became much more streamlined and user friendly than its predecessors, while expanding on old ideas and adding new techniques. The evasion system was revamped from &quot;Virtua Fighter 3&quot;, the evade button was removed, and evades were split into two types, successful and unsuccessful. When evades were not performed with the proper timing, they were unsuccessful leaving the fighter vulnerable. The evade + throw escape option select, which was an advanced technique discovered in &quot;Virtua Fighter 3&quot;, was expanded upon. &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot; allowed the player to escape as many throws as they could, and lengthened the window for performing a successful throw escape during an [unsuccessful] evade. A new move type called a Sabaki was added; an attack that also doubles as a reversal versus one or more move types.

The two new characters, Vanessa Lewis and Lei-Fei, had moves that employed these properties significantly more than the returning cast, and were quite experimental for &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; characters. Vanessa Lewis is a black Vale Tudo/Muay Thai kickboxer with two completely separate moves sets that can be switched between on the fly, and Lei-Fei, a Shaolin monk, employs many stances that flow into one another.

Taka-Arashi, one of the new characters added to &quot;Virtua Fighter 3&quot;, was omitted, apparently due to the developers not being able to make him work properly with the &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot; system mechanics.

The fighting arenas reverted to the old &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; style of flat and square, as opposed to &quot;Virtua Fighter 3&quot;&#x27;s wild and undulating stage designs. The reason behind this was to make the game less random, and more balanced and competitive in nature. Walls, however, were kept and expanded upon with a wall stagger/juggle system and several wall types including high + unbreakable, low + breakable, and low + unbreakable + open corners. Some stages’ walls can be broken by knocking down the opponent while the latter is behind the wall and at low health, with the next round permanently leaves the stage&#x27;s without a fence that have been broken.

&quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot; introduced a comprehensive training mode. The mode consisted of an encyclopedia of fighting game terms, complete character command list walkthroughs, tips on all of the game&#x27;s mechanics, recommended character combos, alternative options for failed combos, detailed command input timings, slow motion for frame counting and timing, and other useful training tips.

&quot;VF4&quot;&#x27;s training mode consists of three sections: &quot;Free Training&quot;, &quot;Trial Mode&quot;, and &quot;Command Training&quot;, A complete run through each move, one-by-one. The command for the move is displayed and the player executes the command—moving to the next one. &quot;VF4&quot; allows the option to skip the current command, view the move (computer controlled), enable advice.

A unique feature in &quot;Evolution&quot; was the ability to play in a tournament quest mode, where the concept was that the player was competing by traveling to various arcades, as opposed to role-playing as the player&#x27;s chosen fighter. This mode was very popular due to the ability to buy cosmetic items to customize a character, as well as the ability to name a character. Many players of fighting games have unique styles; with the combination of various items allowing for vastly differing appearances a new depth of uniqueness was added. In addition, Sega took the top tournament players from the arcade version, and captured their style of play for the AI of a player&#x27;s opponents for this mode. For example, playing against one Wolf character would be very different from playing another, because the actual player that character&#x27;s AI was programmed to mimic had a unique play style.

===Characters===
New characters are marked below in bold:

==Plot==
&quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot; and &quot;Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution&quot; have a two-part storyline. &quot;VF4&quot; started out with thirteen fighters entering the tournament for their own personal reasons, while Judgement Six used them for gathering data for Dural. &quot;Evolution&quot; adds two more fighters to the mix, one of them works for Judgement Six who is ordered to kill everyone in the tournament.

It was also revealed that for the Dural project, Judgement Six targeted Sarah Bryant as their next volunteer for a new Dural model. Akira fell short during the third tournament. In order to find out what the &quot;real power&quot; was within him, he enters the fourth tournament to find that answer. Pai discovers that her skill was close to her father&#x27;s despite her loss in the third tournament. After hearing that Lau was looking for a successor and has a terminal illness, she enters the tournament to prove that she is a worthy successor to master her father&#x27;s style. Lau suffered a terrible illness that cannot be cured after losing to Kage-Maru in the third tournament. He enters the tournament to find a worthy successor to Koen-Ken. Wolf still has reoccurring nightmares since the end of the second tournament. After losing in the third tournament, he ignored the dream but it kept coming back. He enters the fourth tournament to find out what that meant. Jeffry finally gained enough money to repair his boat, but there was only one problem: the Satan Shark mysteriously disappeared. He enters the tournament to invest in a sonar device for the shark.

Kage-Maru won the third tournament and found a part from the new Dural model that would cure his mother. It result in his mother transforming into Dural once again and attacking him. Since Judgement Six saved her, Kage enters the tournament to kill Dural once and for all. Sarah regained her memories and lived a quiet life with her brother, until she had flashbacks of the time where she was brainwashed by Judgement Six and attempted to kill Jacky. She enters the tournament to defeat him and resolve the matter. Jacky turned his focus to racing after the end of the third tournament, where he formed his own racing team. However, Judgement Six killed one of his sponsors and they will continue unless Jacky enters the fourth tournament. He decides to enter the tournament to once again take down Judgement Six. Shun was unsuccessful on finding his missing student during the third tournament. It was revealed that his student was trying to escape from Judgement Six, but he was recaptured by the evil organization. He enters the fourth tournament to find more information about the missing student.

Lion enters the fourth tournament in order to once again try to win the title. Aoi did not last long in the first round of the third tournament. She enters the fourth tournament to try her new skills in parrying and counterattacking. Lei-Fei entered the fourth tournament to become the successor to Lau&#x27;s Koen-Ken style of martial arts. His true intention is to kill Lau after he learned his style under the clan&#x27;s orders. Vanessa joins the fourth tournament to protect Sarah from Judgement Six, and to avenge the murder of her mentor, Lewis. Brad entered the fourth tournament after dominating the Muay Thai Kickboxing world. Goh infiltrated the fourth tournament under Judgement Six orders to kill everyone. The 4th tournament had come down to one final fight between Kage-Maru and Shun Di, but as Kage was about to deliver the final blow to Shun, the glowing, silver form of Dural interrupted the match. Kage is the winner, but he discovers that the Dural he fought is not his mother.

==Development==
Like previous &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; titles, the game&#x27;s development was led by Yu Suzuki.

The Naomi 2 arcade version uses about 12,000 polygons per character, and 50,000 polygons for the backgrounds. It also reportedly uses of texture data. For the PlayStation 2 port, the graphical detail was reduced, particularly in terms of texture details.

In Japan, &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot; is famous for spearheading and opening the market for internet functionality in arcades. VF.NET started in Japan in 2001, and since companies have created their own arcade networks, e-Amusement by Konami, NESiCAxLive by Taito and Square Enix, and ALL.Net by Sega.

==Revisions==
===&quot;Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution&quot;===
&quot;Evolution&quot; was an updated version of &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot;. The game introduced two new characters and adjusted every other character as well. The two new characters were the Judoka-assassin Goh Hinogami and the Muay Thai boxer Brad Burns. With the addition of Brad Burns, Vanessa Lewis&#x27;s alternate Muay Thai style from &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot; was removed and replaced with a Vale Tudo &quot;Offensive&quot; style; making her a solely Vale Tudo brawler. In the US, the PlayStation 2 version was only released as part of the Greatest Hits budget range.

All of the stages were adjusted. For example, Lei-Fei&#x27;s stage in &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot; previously took place during sunset, in &quot;Evolution&quot; it takes place during the morning.

Features:
*Improved graphics: better anti-aliasing.
*New item store in Quest Mode.
*Currency system in Quest Mode.
*Opponent tracking log in Quest Mode: kept track of which opponents were fought in Quest Mode.
*Increased number of character items.
*Improved ranking system.
*Special gameplay modes (i.e. Hyper Fighter, See-Saw, Wrestler&#x27;s, etc.).
*Emblem collecting: placed special incentive to defeat certain opponents or to avoid being defeated by certain opponents.
*New ring type; Semi-open/semi-walled.
*In Quest Mode, one of the tournaments is called the Sonic Cup. Its logo shows Sonic surrounded by rings.

In the US, &quot;Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution&quot; for PlayStation 2 also included &quot;Virtua Fighter 10th Anniversary&quot; as a bonus.

===&quot;Virtua Fighter 10th Anniversary&quot;===
With the 2003 PlayStation 2 release of &quot;Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution&quot; arriving in time for the series&#x27; 10th anniversary, a remake of &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, &quot;Virtua Fighter 10th Anniversary&quot;, was released exclusively on the PlayStation 2. While the music, stages and low-polygon visual style were retained from the first game, the character roster, animations, mechanics and movesets were taken from &quot;Evolution&quot;. In the previous PS2 release of &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot;, a button code would make the player&#x27;s character look like a &quot;VF1&quot; model. In Japan, the game was included as part of a box set with a book called &quot;Virtua Fighter 10th Anniversary: Memory of a Decade&quot; and a DVD. The box set was released in November 2003 and was published by Enterbrain. In North America, the game was included within the home version of &quot;Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution&quot;, and in Europe it was only available as a promotional item; it was not sold at retail.

===&quot;Virtua Fighter 4: Final Tuned&quot;===
&quot;Final Tuned&quot; is the final update to &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot;. This version of the game was released only into Japanese arcades, and it made some gameplay fixes and added new stages. Also, new customization items were added.

==Reception==
===Arcade===
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot; on their September 15, 2001 issue as being the most-successful arcade game of the month.

In July 2001, &quot;IGN&quot;″s Anthony Chau praised the graphics of the arcade game, stating it is &quot;one of the finest looking video games I&#x27;ve laid my eyes on&quot; and &quot;demonstrates the highest quality in visuals I&#x27;ve seen.&quot;

===PlayStation 2===
In Japan, the PlayStation 2 version sold 500,000 units during its first weekend on sale in early 2002, making it Sega&#x27;s fastest-selling game of that generation. The PlayStation 2 version went on to sell 541,973 units overall in Japan by the end of 2002. Worldwide sales of the PS2 port exceeded 1.5 million by June 2002. By July 2006, &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot; had sold 630,000 copies and earned $23 million in the United States. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 97th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of the &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot; line reached 1 million units in the United States by July 2006.

On release, &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine scored the PlayStation 2 version of the game a 37 out of 40. The game received universal critical acclaim (Metacritic 94/100), with perfect scores from &quot;GMR Magazine&quot;, &quot;PSX Nation&quot;, &quot;Hot Games&quot;, &quot;GamePro&quot;, G4 TV, &quot;Official PlayStation Magazine&quot;, Into Liquid Sky, and Cinescape. G4 TV called it &quot;The best fighting experience available on home consoles.&quot; Writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Levi Buchanan hailed &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot; as &quot;the greatest fighting game since &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;.&quot; &quot;Game Informer&quot; gave the PS2 release a 9.75/10, opining that &quot;Underneath its silky shine is a feast of fighting goodies that will change everything you have ever come to expect from this genre.&quot; &quot;Game Informer&quot; later named &quot;Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution&quot; one of &quot;The Top 50 Games of 2003,&quot; calling it &quot;absolutely ingenious&quot; and &quot;the most balanced and challenging fighting game the world has ever seen.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot; the best video game of March 2002, and &quot;Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution&quot; the best PlayStation 2 game of August 2003. During the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences (AIAS) nominated &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot; for &quot;Console Fighting Game of the Year&quot;, which ultimately lost to &quot;Tekken 4&quot;. At the following year&#x27;s awards ceremony, AIAS also nominated &quot;Evolution&quot; for &quot;Console Fighting Game of the Year&quot; as well; however, it would ultimately lose out to &quot;Soulcalibur II&quot;.

&quot;Edge&quot; noted in retrospect that &quot;&quot;Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution&quot; was unchallenged in having the best tutorial in fighting game history.&quot;

<text>A lavra or laura (; Cyrillic: Ла́вра) is a type of monastery consisting of a cluster of cells or caves for hermits, with a church and sometimes a refectory at the center. Lavra monasteries operate within the Orthodox and other Eastern Christian traditions; the name is also used by some Catholic communities.
The term in Greek initially meant a narrow lane or an alley in a city. In a later Eastern Orthodox context, the term took the new meaning of large and important monastery.

==History==
===Byzantine laura/lavra===
From the fifth century the Greek term &quot;laura&quot; could refer specifically to the semi-eremitical monastic settlements of the Judaean Desert, where lauras were very numerous. The first lauras of Palestine were founded by Chariton the Confessor (born 3rd century, died c. 350): the Laura of Pharan (now Wadi Qelt) northeast of Jerusalem, the Laura of Douka on the Mount of Temptation west of Jericho, and Souka Laura or Old Laura in the area of Tuqu&#x27; in Wadi Khureitun.

Saint Euthymius the Great (377–473) founded one of the early lauras in fifth-century Palestine. The Lavra of Saint Sabbas the Sanctified (†532) in the Kidron Valley (known in Syriac as Mar Saba), is one of the most ancient and almost continuously functioning monasteries in the Christian Church.

Gerasimus of the Jordan established a similar system in the Jordan Valley in the middle of the fifth century, with 70 cells surrounding a cenobium and with monks progressing into the cells after time spent in the cenobium. Weekdays were spent in the cells, accompanied only by a rush mat, a small amount of food and palm blades with which to make ropes and baskets. On Saturdays the monks would bring their handiwork to the cenobium and receive the Eucharist together, returning to their cells on Sunday evening. Cells were left open, and those in need could take whatever they wished from a cell if it were found empty. The lavra had a priest, the lavra&#x27;s contact with the outside world, and at least two ordained deacons.

The Great Lavra founded by Athanasius the Athonite in 963 is the oldest monastery on Mount Athos in Greece.

===Coptic tradition===
Some modern Coptic authors, and they alone, already apply the specific Greek term &quot;lavra&quot; to even earlier monastic settlements from the Wadi El Natrun and even attribute the writing down of the formal rules of a &quot;lavra&quot; to the Egyptian sanctified monk Macarius of Egypt in AD 330. Unless proven otherwise by future scholarship, this opinion seems to be theirs alone.

Their claim is that the lavrite style of living has its origins in the early fourth century, by equating the creation of the first lavras with the founding of a settlement of cells in the Nitrean desert at a site known as Nitria, named for the nearby town of the same name (near Alexandria in Egypt). It was a community of 600 hermits who lived scattered over the area, reliant on the town of Nitria for bread, but with their own priest and church.

===Kievan Rus&#x27;===
The first lavra in the Kievan Rus&#x27; was the Kiev Pechersk Lavra founded in the 11th century in Kiev/Kyiv (now in Ukraine).

==Later meaning==
The largest and the most important Eastern Orthodox monasteries have at some point been called lavras. Those among them which were part of the Russian Orthodox Church have become subordinated directly to the Patriarch of Moscow. In 1721 they became subordinated to the Russian Most Holy Synod.

<doc id="478847" wikidata="Q9702" url="?curid=478847" title="The Satanic Bible">
<text>The Satanic Bible is a collection of essays, observations, and rituals published by Anton LaVey in 1969. It is the central religious text of LaVeyan Satanism, and is considered the foundation of its philosophy and dogma. It has been described as the most important document to influence contemporary 
Satanism. Though &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; is not considered to be sacred scripture in the way that the Christian Bible is to Christianity, LaVeyan Satanists regard it as an authoritative text as it is a contemporary text that has attained for them scriptural status. It extols the virtues of exploring one&#x27;s nature and instincts. Believers have been described as &quot;atheistic Satanists&quot; because they believe that God and Satan are not external entities, but rather projections of an individual&#x27;s personality—benevolent and stabilizing forces in their life. There have been thirty printings of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, selling over a million copies.

&quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; is composed of four books: &quot;The Book of Satan&quot;, &quot;The Book of Lucifer&quot;, &quot;The Book of Belial&quot;, and &quot;The Book of Leviathan&quot;. &quot;The Book of Satan&quot; challenges the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, and promotes Epicureanism. &quot;The Book of Lucifer&quot; holds most of the philosophy in &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, with twelve chapters discussing topics such as indulgence, love, hate, and sex. LaVey also uses the book to dispel rumors surrounding the religion. In &quot;The Book of Belial&quot;, LaVey details rituals and magic. He discusses the required mindset and focus for performing a ritual, and provides instructions for three rituals: those for sex, compassion, or destruction. &quot;The Book of Leviathan&quot; provides four invocations for Satan, lust, compassion, and destruction. It also lists the nineteen Enochian Keys (adapted from John Dee&#x27;s Enochian keys), provided both in Enochian and in English translation.

There have been both positive and negative reactions to &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;. It has been described as &quot;razor-sharp&quot; and &quot;influential&quot;. Criticism of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; stems both from qualms over LaVey&#x27;s writing and disapproval of the content itself. LaVey has been criticized for plagiarizing sections, and accusations have been made that his philosophies are largely borrowed. Attempts have been made to ban the book in schools, public libraries, and prisons, though these attempts are somewhat rare.

==History==

There are multiple stories of the birth of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;. In the introduction to the 2005–present edition, High Priest Peter H. Gilmore describes LaVey as having compiled &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; on his own from monographs he had written about the Church of Satan and its rituals. Gilmore lists a number of people who influenced LaVey&#x27;s writings: Ayn Rand, Friedrich Nietzsche, H. L. Mencken, the members of the carnival with whom LaVey had supposedly worked in his youth, P. T. Barnum, Mark Twain, John Milton, and Lord Byron.

LaVey&#x27;s daughter Zeena Schreck, in an exposé about both her father&#x27;s religion and past, attributes the birth of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; to a suggestion by Peter Mayer, a publisher for Avon. According to Schreck, Mayer proposed that LaVey author a Satanic Bible to draw from the popularity of the 1968 horror film &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, which had caused a recent rise in public interest in both Satanism and other occult practices. Schreck states that LaVey, aided by Diane Hegarty, compiled a number of writings he had already been distributing: an introduction to Satanism, a number of short essays, a guide to ritual magic, and pieces previously published in the Church of Satan bulletin &quot;The Cloven Hoof&quot;.

Either to meet length requirements set by the publisher or out of agreement with the ideas, LaVey and Hegarty borrowed heavily from writings by other authors. These included the 1890 social Darwinist book &quot;Might Is Right&quot; by Ragnar Redbeard, as well as Dee&#x27;s Enochian keys from Aleister Crowley&#x27;s &quot;The Equinox&quot;, modified to replace Christian references with Satanic alternates. Some accused LaVey of paraphrasing the &quot;Nine Satanic Statements&quot; from Rand&#x27;s &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; without acknowledgement, though others maintain that LaVey was simply drawing inspiration from the novel. LaVey later affirmed the connection with Rand&#x27;s ideas by stating that LaVeyan Satanism was &quot;just Ayn Rand&#x27;s philosophy, with ceremony and ritual added&quot;.

==Importance==
&quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, has been described as the most important document to influence contemporary Satanism. The book contains the core principles of Satanism and is considered the foundation of its philosophy and dogma. Petersen noted that it is &quot;in many ways &quot;the&quot; central text of the Satanic milieu&quot;, with Lap similarly testifying to its dominant position within the wider Satanic movement. David G. Bromley calls it &quot;iconoclastic&quot; and &quot;the best-known and most influential statement of Satanic theology.&quot; Eugene V. Gallagher says that Satanists use LaVey&#x27;s writings &quot;as lenses through which they view themselves, their group, and the cosmos.&quot; He also states: &quot;With a clear-eyed appreciation of true human nature, a love of ritual and pageantry, and a flair for mockery, LaVey&#x27;s &quot;Satanic Bible&quot; promulgated a gospel of self-indulgence that, he argued, anyone who dispassionately considered the facts would embrace.&quot;

===Publication history===
Originally published in paperback by Avon in 1969, &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; has had thirty printings and has never gone out of print. A hardcover edition was published by University Books that same year but has now been out of print for decades. In 2015, William Morrow published a new hardcover edition of the book combined in a single volume with its companion work, &quot;The Satanic Rituals&quot;, and marketed under a special arrangement by Rabid Crow Arts and Graphics. The main content has not changed throughout the editions, although the dedication was removed after several printings and the introduction has changed several times. The Sigil of Baphomet has been printed on the cover since the original publication. &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; has sold over one million copies since its initial release. It has also been translated into Danish, Swedish, German, Spanish, Finnish and Turkish.

==Content==
Some of the teachings of the satanic bible, according to the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, are 
* &quot;Hate your enemies with a whole heart, and if a man smite you on one cheek, SMASH him on the other&quot;; 
* &quot;Say unto thine own heart, I am mine own redeemer&#x27; &quot;; 
* &quot;There is no heaven of glory bright, and no hell where sinners roast.&quot;

===Dedication===
Though it is no longer included in current printings of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, early printings included an extensive dedication to various people whom LaVey recognized as influences. LaVey&#x27;s primary dedication was to Bernardino Nogara (misprinted as &quot;Logara&quot;), Karl Haushofer, Grigori Rasputin, Basil Zaharoff, Alessandro Cagliostro, Barnabas Saul (John Dee&#x27;s first scryer), Ragnar Redbeard, William Mortensen, Hans Brick, Max Reinhardt, Orrin Klapp, Fritz Lang, Friedrich Nietzsche, W. C. Fields, P. T. Barnum, Hans Poelzig, Reginald Marsh, Wilhelm Reich, and Mark Twain. The secondary dedication named Howard Hughes, James Moody, Marcello Truzzi, Adrian‐Claude Frazier, Marilyn Monroe, Wesley Mather, William Lindsay Gresham, Hugo Zacchini, Jayne Mansfield, Frederick Goerner, C. Huntley, Nathanael West, Horatio Alger Jr., Robert E. Howard, George Orwell, H. P. Lovecraft, Tuesday Weld, H. G. Wells, Sister Marie Koven, Harry Houdini, Togare (LaVey&#x27;s pet lion), and the Nine Unknown Men from &quot;The Nine Unknown&quot;.

===Introductions===
Throughout the various printings of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, it has included introductions by various authors. The first edition (in print from 1969 to 1972) included an excerpt from an article by Burton H. Wolfe, an investigative journalist and biographer of LaVey, entitled &quot;The Church that Worships Satan&quot;. Wolfe provides an extensive biography of LaVey and a history of the Church of Satan. He mentions &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; as contributing to the popularity of Satanism, though he does not claim LaVeyan Satanism to have directly influenced its creation. From 1972 until 1976, the introduction to &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; was a piece by Michael A. Aquino, who later went on to found the Temple of Set with a number of members of the Church of Satan. He gives a detailed analysis of the Satanic philosophies, and dispels myths about LaVeyan Satanism. He explains that it is not &quot;devil worship&quot;, and that LaVeyan Satanists in fact reject the worship of external gods completely. He too provides a brief background on LaVey, explaining how LaVey brought some of the knowledge he had acquired while working with the circus to his religion. Wolfe again wrote the introduction for the 1976 to 2005 editions of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;. It included some of the same content as the 1969 version, with an expanded biography of LaVey and more information on the various conflicts between other religions and LaVeyan Satanism. Since 2005, &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; has contained an introduction written by Gilmore, High Priest of the Church of Satan. In this introduction, he discusses his discovery of LaVeyan Satanism and his relationship with LaVey. He then goes on to provide a detailed biography of LaVey and addresses allegations that LaVey falsified much of the story of his own past. The introduction also provides a history of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; itself, as well as that of two other books by LaVey: &quot;The Satanic Witch&quot; and &quot;The Satanic Rituals&quot;.

===Preface===
LaVey explains his reasons for writing &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; in a short preface. He speaks skeptically about volumes written by other authors on the subject of magic, dismissing them as &quot;nothing more than sanctimonious fraud&quot; and &quot;volumes of hoary misinformation and false prophecy&quot;. He complains that other authors do no more than confuse the subject. He mocks those who spend large amounts of money on attempts to follow rituals and learn about the magic shared in other occult books. He also notes that many of the existing writings on Satanic magic and ideology were created by &quot;right-hand path&quot; authors. He tells that &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; contains both truth and fantasy, and declares, &quot;What you see may not always please you, but you &quot;will see&quot;!&quot;

===Prologue===
The prologue to &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; begins by discussing the concept of gods, good and evil, and human nature. It includes the Nine Satanic Statements: 
The Nine Satanic Statements outline the basic ideology of LaVeyan Satanism, and have become some of the guiding principles of LaVeyan Satanism. They also served as a template for later publications by LaVey, such as his 1987 &quot;Nine Satanic Sins&quot;. Ayn Rand&#x27;s influence on LaVeyan Satanism is apparent in the Nine Satanic Statements, leading some, namely Nikolas Schreck, to assert that the Statements are simply unacknowledged paraphrase of Rand&#x27;s thoughts. These accusations have been disproved, however. He also inverts the typical blessings found in the Gospel of Matthew.

===&quot;The Book of Satan&quot;===
Much of the first book of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; is taken from parts of Redbeard&#x27;s &quot;Might Is Right&quot;, edited to remove racism, antisemitism, and misogyny. It challenges both the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, advocating instead a tooth-for-tooth philosophy. LaVey, through Redbeard, strongly advocates social Darwinism, saying, &quot;Death to the weakling, wealth to the strong!&quot; Humans are identified as instinctually predatory, and &quot;lust and carnal desire&quot; are singled out as part of humans&#x27; intrinsic nature. &quot;The Book of Satan&quot; suggests a hedonistic outlook, saying, &quot;I break away from all conventions that do not lead to my earthly happiness.&quot; Indulgence is endorsed, and readers are encouraged to make the most of their lives. It criticizes both law and religious principles, instead suggesting doing only what makes one happy and successful. LaVey continues to denounce other religions, and he rails against what he considers to be arbitrary definitions of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;. Religion is criticized as a man-made construct, and the reader is urged to question everything and destroy any lies that he or she uncovers. Long-standing lies that are believed to be irrefutable truths are identified as the most dangerous. The last part of &quot;The Book of Satan&quot; is an adaptation of the Christian Beatitudes, changed to reflect the principles of LaVeyan Satanism.

===&quot;The Book of Lucifer&quot;===
&quot;The Book of Lucifer&quot; contains the majority of the philosophy of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;. It details how Christianity has taught that God is good and Satan is evil, and presents an alternate view. It describes that the concept of Satan, used synonymously with &quot;God&quot;, is different for each LaVeyan Satanist, but that to all it represents a good and steadying force in their life. Believers have been called &quot;atheistic Satanists&quot; because of this lack of belief in external gods, but others identify as antitheistic. Satan is seen to LaVeyan Satanists not as &quot;an anthropomorphic being with cloven hooves, a barbed tail, and horns&quot;, but as a force of nature that has only been described as evil by other religions. Satan is viewed as a metaphor or a symbol, not as a being to be worshipped.

LaVey rejects the idea of prayer, instead urging Satanists to take action to fix a situation instead of asking for a solution. The seven deadly sins are advocated, on the basis that they all lead to personal pleasure. He says that Satanism is a form of &quot;controlled selfishness&quot;, in the sense that doing something to help another will, in turn, make one happy. The Golden Rule is again mentioned, and LaVey suggests altering it from &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you&quot; to &quot;Do unto others as they do unto you&quot; so that if someone is treated poorly, he or she can respond viciously. &quot;The Book of Lucifer&quot; also contains a list of &quot;The Four Crown Princes of Hell&quot; (Satan, Lucifer, Belial, and Leviathan) and of seventy-seven &quot;Infernal Names&quot;, representations of Satan from various cultures and religions. They are the names that, according to LaVey, are most useful in Satanic rituals.

&quot;The Book of Lucifer&quot; contains a long chapter titled &quot;Satanic Sex&quot;, discussing Satanism&#x27;s view on sexual activity as well as misconceptions surrounding these views. He denies the belief that sex is the most important element in LaVeyan Satanism, and that participation in orgies or other promiscuous behavior is forced. He explains that sexual freedom is encouraged, but only in the sense that believers should be free to explore their own sexualities as they please, without harming others. Along with the rumors regarding Satanic views on sex, LaVey also addresses those about animal and human sacrifice. He explains that the only time a LaVeyan Satanist would perform a human sacrifice would be to accomplish two goals: to &quot;release the magician&#x27;s wrath&quot; as he or she performed a curse, and to kill someone who deserved to die. He considers the action of hurting another person a request to be destroyed and explains that the Satanist is morally required to grant this request in the form of a curse. LaVey also says that a Satanist would never sacrifice a baby or an animal, as they are pure carnal beings and considered to be sacred. In &quot;The Book of Lucifer&quot;, LaVey outlines LaVeyan Satanism&#x27;s views on death. He explains that one who has lived a full life will dread death and that this is the way it should be. He also does not agree with the idea of reincarnation. He encourages a strong will to live, comparing it to animals&#x27; instincts to fight viciously for their lives. Suicide is discouraged except in cases of euthanasia, where it would end extreme suffering. Because the Satanist is considered their own god, birthdays are celebrated as the most important holidays. Following one&#x27;s birthday in importance are Walpurgisnacht and Halloween. Solstices and equinoxes are also celebrated.

===&quot;The Book of Belial&quot;===
The third book of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; describes rituals and magic. According to Joshua Gunn, these are adapted from books of ritual magic such as Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Magick: Elementary Theory&quot;. &quot;The Satanic Rituals&quot;, published by LaVey in 1972, outlines the rituals more precisely, and contains the entire text of the Black Mass. LaVey begins &quot;The Book of Belial&quot; by defining magic as &quot;The change in situations or events in accordance with one&#x27;s will, which would, using normally accepted methods, be unchangeable.&quot; He explains that some of the rituals are simply applied psychology or science, but that some contain parts with no scientific basis.

LaVey explains that, in order to control a person, one must first attract their attention. He gives three qualities that can be employed for this purpose: sex appeal, sentiment (cuteness or innocence), and wonder. He also advocates the use of odor. In the &quot;Book of Belial&quot;, he discusses three types of rituals: those for sex, compassion, and destruction. Sex rituals work to entice another person; compassion rituals work to improve health, intelligence, success, and so on; destruction rituals work to destroy another person. LaVey advocates finding others with whom to practice Satanic rituals in order to reaffirm one&#x27;s faith and avoid antisocial behavior. He particularly advocates group participation for destruction rituals, as compassion and sex rituals are more private in nature. LaVey goes on to list the key components to successful ritual: desire, timing, imagery, direction, and &quot;The Balance Factor&quot; (awareness of one&#x27;s own limitations). Details for the various Satanic rituals are explained in &quot;The Book of Belial&quot;, and lists of necessary objects (such as clothing, altars, and the symbol of Baphomet) are given.

===&quot;The Book of Leviathan&quot;===
The final book of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; emphasizes the importance of spoken word and emotion to effective magic. An &quot;Invocation to Satan&quot; as well as three invocations for the three types of ritual are given. The &quot;Invocation to Satan&quot; commands the dark forces to grant power to the summoner, and lists the Infernal names for use in the invocation. The &quot;Invocation employed towards the conjuration of lust&quot; is used for attracting the attentions of another. Both male and female versions of the invocation are provided. The &quot;Invocation employed towards the conjuration of destruction&quot; commands the dark forces to destroy the subject of the invocation. The &quot;Invocation employed towards the conjuration of compassion&quot; requests protection, health, strength, and the destruction of anything ailing the subject of the invocation. The rest of &quot;The Book of Leviathan&quot; is composed of the Enochian Keys, which LaVey adapted from Dee&#x27;s original work. They are given in Enochian and also translated into English. LaVey provides a brief introduction that credits Dee and explains some of the history behind the Enochian Keys and language. He maintains that the translations provided are an &quot;unvarnishing&quot; of the translations performed by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in the 1800s, but others accuse LaVey of simply changing references to Christianity with those to Satan.

==Themes==

===God and Satan===
&quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; often uses the terms &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Satan&quot; interchangeably, except when referring to the concepts of these as viewed by other religions. LaVey also occasionally uses the term &quot;God&quot; to refer to other religions&#x27; views of God, and &quot;Satan&quot; or synonyms to refer to the idea of god as interpreted by LaVeyan Satanism, as when he writes, &quot;When all religious faith in lies has waned, it is because man has become closer to himself and farther from &#x27;God&#x27;; closer to the &#x27;Devil.&#x27;&quot; Throughout &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, the LaVeyan Satanist&#x27;s view of god is described as the Satanist&#x27;s true &quot;self&quot;—a projection of their own personality—not an external deity. Satan is used as a representation of personal liberty and individualism. Satan is also used as a metaphor for the ideas connected with the early Christian view of Satan or the serpent: wise, defiant, questioning, and free-thinking. LaVey discusses this extensively in &quot;The Book of Lucifer&quot;, explaining that the gods worshipped by other religions are also projections of man&#x27;s true self. He argues that man&#x27;s unwillingness to accept his own ego has caused him to externalize these gods so as to avoid the feeling of narcissism that would accompany self-worship.

Though at some points LaVey refers to Satan as a physical being, this is intended to encourage the Satanist&#x27;s &quot;rational self-interest.&quot;

===Science===
Many of the ideas in &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; suggest a secular, scientific view of the world. However, some of these ideas continue beyond present-day secularism by implying that various occult forces are not supernatural, but rather thus far undiscovered by science. These forces are said to be manipulable by the practitioner of LaVeyan Satanism, a trait of the religion that has been compared with Christian Science and Scientology.

James Lewis argues that scientific themes are so prevalent in &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; because LaVey was appealing to the authority of science to legitimize Satanism as a religion.

===Human nature and social Darwinism===
Social Darwinism and the concept of &quot;human nature&quot; are ideas that are prevalent throughout &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;. LaVey describes Satanism as &quot;a religion based on the universal traits of man,&quot; and humans are described throughout as inherently carnal and animalistic. Each of the seven deadly sins is described as part of human&#x27;s natural instinct, and are thus advocated. Social Darwinism is particularly noticeable in &quot;The Book of Satan&quot;, where LaVey plagiarizes portions of Redbeard&#x27;s &quot;Might Is Right&quot;, though it also appears throughout in references to man&#x27;s inherent strength and instinct for self-preservation. LaVeyan Satanism has been described as &quot;institutionalism of Machiavellian self-interest&quot; because of many of these themes.

==Influence==
&quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; is recognized as one of the key texts of modern Satanism. The Church of Satan requires that people accept &quot;LaVey&#x27;s principles&quot; before becoming members of the church. Many other Satanist groups and individual Satanists who are not part of the Church of Satan also recognize LaVey&#x27;s work as influential. Many Satanists attribute their conversions or discoveries of Satanism to &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, with 20% of respondents to a survey by James Lewis mentioning &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; directly as influencing their conversion.
In Gilmore&#x27;s introduction, he lists a number of novels and films supposedly influenced by &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; and LaVeyan Satanism. These include the novels &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; by Ira Levin and &quot;Our Lady of Darkness&quot; by Fritz Leiber, as well as films such as &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rain&quot;, &quot;The Car&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Dracula&quot;. Others have lauded &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; as heavily influential on metal and rock bands, such as Black Sabbath, Venom, Slayer, King Diamond, and Marilyn Manson.

==Reception==
Richard Metzger describes &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; as &quot;a razor-sharp, no-bullshit primer in natural and supernatural law.&quot; David G. Bromley calls it &quot;iconoclastic&quot; and &quot;the best-known and most influential statement of Satanic theology.&quot; Eugene V. Gallagher says that Satanists use LaVey&#x27;s writings &quot;as lenses through which they view themselves, their group, and the cosmos.&quot; He also states: &quot;With a clear-eyed appreciation of true human nature, a love of ritual and pageantry, and a flair for mockery, LaVey&#x27;s &quot;Satanic Bible&quot; promulgated a gospel of self-indulgence that, he argued, anyone who dispassionately considered the facts would embrace.&quot; The philosophy it presents has been described as &quot;strident libertarianism&quot; and &quot;an obvious distillation of ideas common among members of the United States counter-culture in the 1960s.&quot; Joshua Gunn argues that the significance of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; as an occult item owes to its status as a &quot;totem or a fetishized object in popular culture&quot;, not the philosophy contained within. He argues that many erroneously categorize the content of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; as evil and depraved from the minimalist, dark cover design (composed of a purple Sigil of Baphomet and white text on the front, and a photo of LaVey superimposed over the Sigil of Baphomet on the back), the verbose, overblown style of the text, and the presence of the word &quot;Satan&quot; in the title. Contrary to this belief, he says, the philosophy presented by LaVey is &quot;neither offensive nor surprising.&quot;

Other observers have been more critical. Zeena Schreck has criticized &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; as a financial endeavor suggested by Avon publisher, Mayer. She maintains that it contains large amounts of falsified information about LaVey&#x27;s past, and that much of the book is plagiarized from Redbeard&#x27;s &quot;Might Is Right&quot;, Dee&#x27;s Enochian Keys, and Rand&#x27;s &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;. Chris Mathews, in &quot;Modern Satanism: Anatomy of a Radical Subculture&quot;, describes &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; as &quot;hastily prepared&quot; and cynical. Both Mathews and a 1971 article in &quot;Newsweek&quot; compare the ideologies presented in &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; to Nazism: containing &quot;unremitting focus on social elitism, appeals to force, and scorn for egalitarian principles&quot;. Israel Regardie criticized LaVey&#x27;s alteration of the Enochian Keys in &quot;The Book of Leviathan&quot; as stupid and of lower quality than the original Keys. Gabriel Andrade calls LaVey&#x27;s plagiarism &quot;massive&quot; and asserts that without it, the bible &quot;would have fallen into oblivion.&quot; 

&quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; has also received a large amount of criticism from people and organizations who find its content to be dangerous. Much of this criticism came during the period of &quot;Satanic panic,&quot; when Satanic ritual abuse was feared to be epidemic. Much of this media coverage, however, has been denounced as &quot;uncritical and sensationalized.&quot; Tom Harpur condemns the book as &quot;blasphemous&quot; and &quot;socially seditious,&quot; and blames it for causing an increase in gruesome violence, ritual abuse, and other obscene acts. Critics have also accused &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; of encouraging violence and murder, particularly in young people considered to be impressionable. Dawn Perlmutter criticizes it for providing adolescents with bad messages and messages that can be easily misinterpreted. Possession of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; has been used by some studies to identify adolescents who are antisocial, and some warn that possession of the book is a warning sign of emotional issues. The Council on Mind Abuse took a very negative view of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;. Former Executive Director Rob Tucker warned parents to look for &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; in their children&#x27;s bedrooms, saying, &quot;You have to help the child fight this obsession like any other addiction&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s like giving drugs to a kid who is already on the edge.&quot; Attempts to ban the book from schools and public libraries have been made in various places around the world, and bans or limitations on the book in prisons have been repeatedly challenged in court. However, opposition to &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; has rarely led to its removal; these bans are rare. The book was banned in South Africa from 1973 to 1993.

<text>The Silver Dart (or Aerodrome #4) was a derivative of an early aircraft built by a Canadian/U.S. team, which after many successful flights in Hammondsport, New York, earlier in 1908, was dismantled and shipped to Baddeck, Nova Scotia. It was flown from the ice of Baddeck Bay, a sub-basin of Bras d&#x27;Or Lake, on 23 February 1909, making it the first controlled powered flight in Canada. The aircraft was piloted by one of its designers, Douglas McCurdy. The original &quot;Silver Dart&quot; was designed and built by the Aerial Experiment Association (AEA), which had been formed under the guidance of Dr. Alexander Graham Bell.

From 1891, Bell had begun experiments at Baddeck and Hammondsport to develop motor-powered heavier-than-air aircraft. By 1908, the success of the AEA was seen in a series of ground-breaking designs, culminating in the &quot;Silver Dart&quot;. By the time the &quot;Silver Dart&quot; was constructed in late 1908, it was the Aerial Experiment Association&#x27;s fourth flying machine. One of its precursors, the &quot;June Bug&quot;, had already broken records. It won the &quot;Scientific American&quot; Trophy for making the first official one mile (1609 m) flight in North America.

The frame and structure of the &quot;Silver Dart&quot; were made of steel tube, bamboo, friction tape, wire and wood. The wings were covered with rubberized, silvery balloon cloth provided by Capt. Thomas Scott Baldwin of Hammondsport; hence the name the &quot;Silver Dart&quot;. Its Kirkham engine, supplied by Glenn Curtiss, was a reliable V-8 that developed at 1,000 RPM. The propeller was carved from a solid block of wood. The aircraft had what is now called a canard or an &quot;elevator in front&quot; design. Like most aircraft of its day the &quot;Silver Dart&quot; had poor control characteristics; likewise, it had no brakes.

==Operational history==
When the &quot;Silver Dart&quot; lifted off on 23 February 1909, it flew only half a mile (800 m) at an elevation from three to nine meters, and a speed of roughly . The aircraft was the first powered, heavier-than-air machine to fly in Canada. Other records were soon to fall; on 10 March 1909, the &quot;Silver Dart&quot; flown again by McCurdy completed a circular course over a distance of more than . The first passenger flight in Canada was made in the &quot;Silver Dart&quot; on 2 August 1909.

The Canadian Army was unimpressed at the headway made by the group. The general impression of the time was that aircraft would never amount to much in actual warfare. Despite official scepticism, the Association was finally invited to the military base at Camp Petawawa to demonstrate the aircraft. The sandy terrain made a poor runway for an aircraft with landing wheels about wide. The &quot;Silver Dart&quot; had great difficulty taking off. On its fifth flight on 2 August 1909, McCurdy wrecked the craft when one wheel struck a rise in the ground while landing. The &quot;Silver Dart&quot; never flew again.

Although a significant aircraft in Canada, the location of the initial design and construction of the &quot;Silver Dart&quot; made it an American design. Following the disbanding of the AEA, founding members, McCurdy and F.W. (&quot;Casey&quot;) Baldwin obtained the Canadian patent rights for Aerodrome No. 4 (&quot;The Silver Dart&quot;), for the express purpose of producing a Canadian-made version. Subsequently, the &quot;Baddeck No. 1&quot; and &quot;Baddeck No. 2&quot; were built by the Canadian Aerodrome Company, the newly formed company that Baldwin and McCurdy established in 1909.

==Tributes==
===50th Anniversary flight===
There is a reconstruction of the &quot;Silver Dart&quot; on display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa. The reconstruction was built by volunteers from the Royal Canadian Air Force between 1956 and 1958 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first flight. The aircraft flew over Baddeck Bay on the day of the anniversary but crashed due to high winds. A number of other scaled and full-scale replicas are found in Canadian and museum collections in other parts of the world, including examples at the Canadian Bushplane Heritage Centre in Sault Ste. Marie, the Atlantic Canada Aviation Museum, Reynolds-Alberta Museum, Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum The Canadian Aviation Museum in Windsor On. A.G.Bell Museum, Baddeck Nova Scotia, the National Air Force Museum of Canada and Aero Space Museum of Calgary.

===2009 Centennial celebrations===
A small group of volunteers from the not-for-profit Aerial Experiment Association 2005 Inc. completed building a flying replica of the &quot;Silver Dart&quot; in early 2009.
 The main goal of the group was to recreate the original flight on 23 February 2009 – again on the frozen surface of Baddeck Bay near Baddeck, Nova Scotia. However, due to weather conditions forecast for the 23rd, the centennial flight and fly-by occurred on 22 February. After a temporary repair made to the front wheel, former Canadian astronaut Bjarni Tryggvason piloted five successful flights that day. The replica is officially considered a Canadian heritage project, and throughout the year was the centerpiece of a series of events celebrating the centennial of the &quot;Silver Dart&#x27;s&quot; first flight in Canada. In 2013, it was moved to the Alexander Graham Bell Museum in Baddeck, where it will be on permanent display.

Numerous other activities took place in 2009 to celebrate the Centennial of Flight, including a new exhibition entitled &quot;Canadian Wings – A Remarkable Century of Flight&quot; at the Canada Aviation Museum in Ottawa and a trans-Canada flight of vintage aircraft. The no longer functional official Nova Scotia Ministry of Tourism website &quot;Centennial Celebration of the Flight of the Silver Dart in Baddeck&quot; promoted the flight and anniversary activities in Baddeck throughout the centennial. Various historical photos and documents were posted on that site, in a virtual museum presentation.

===Commemorations===
The 824 Silver Dart Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets in St. Peter&#x27;s, Nova Scotia is named in honour of the &quot;Silver Dart&quot;. Another cadet squadron, the 602 McCurdy Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets – in Florence, Nova Scotia – is named in honour of John McCurdy, the original pilot of the &quot;Silver Dart&quot;.

Physical commemorations include Silver Dart Drive, located in Mississauga, Ontario, which is a perimeter roadway within the confines of Toronto Pearson International Airport. Another Ontario commemorative site is the double ice-surface arena in CFB Petawawa, known as the &quot;Silver Dart Arena&quot;.

On the 50th anniversary of its first flight, Canada Post issued a Canadian &quot;Silver Dart&quot; stamp on 23 February 1959. During the Canadian Centenary of Flight, Canada Post honoured the &quot;Silver Dart&quot; – and the first flight in Canada – with a Canadian postage stamp released on 23 February 2009.

<text>Thrill of a Lifetime is a television reality series (before that term was coined) created by Sidney M. Cohen (who also directed many of the episodes) and Willie Stein. It was telecast from 1981 to 1988 in Canada on the CTV network. &quot;Thrill of a Lifetime&quot; gave viewers the chance to live their dreams, with thrills ranging from daredevil adventures to the romantic. The program was hosted by Doug Paulson, with Teri Austin joining as co-host later in its run. One of the program&#x27;s more notable episodes was in its first season, when it arranged for an aspiring model named Shannon Tweed to pose for &quot;Playboy&quot;, which led to her becoming 1982&#x27;s Playmate of the Year and launching an acting career.

&quot;Thrill of a Lifetime&quot; was revived in 2002 with new episodes produced and telecast in Canada and other countries.

==Episodes==

<text>Belgorod Oblast () is a federal subject (an oblast) of Russia. Its administrative center is the city of Belgorod. , the population is 1,540,486.

==History==
During the Princely era of Kievan Rus&#x27;, the region was part of the Principality of Chernigov. The area was devastated by Mongol-Tatar raids and came under the control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 14th and 15th centuries. Since 1500 it was part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow.

At the turn of the 17th century, a solid line of military fortifications was built in the area, stretching for almost . Zaporozhian Cossacks, who moved here because of the nobility and the tax burden, were in charge of the line defenses. Even more Cossacks moved to the area during the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648–1657) and the internecine wars in the Cossack Hetmanate (1659–1679). Belgorod became the military and administrative center, after originating as an outpost on the southern borders of Russia.

Following the Battle of Poltava, Peter I granted to soldiers of Greater Belgorod the regiment flag.

From 1708 to 1727, the territory of the modern Belgorod Oblast was part of the Kiev and Azov governorates. In 1727, Belgorod Governorate was established from parts of Kiev Governorate. The governorate lasted until 1779. This territory was much greater than that of today, and the governorate incorporated territories modern Kursk, Oryol, and parts of Bryansk and Kharkiv oblasts. The coat of arms of the then-Governorate is still used by the modern Belgorod Oblast.

In 1775–1779, the territory of Belgorod Governorate was abolished and divided between the newly formed governorates and vice-royalties. The city of Belgorod and the area around it became a part of Kursk Vice-Royalty, while the southeastern uyezds became a part of Voronezh Governorate.

During the 19th century and up until 1928 the territory of modern Belgorod Oblast remained part of the Kursk and Voronezh governorates. After the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in April 1918, in January 1919 the territory was incorporated into the Ukrainian State under hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi.

The current administrative-territorial boundaries of Belgorod Oblast were formed by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on 6 January 1954. The oblast was formed from several districts of Kursk and Voronezh Oblasts.

For the courage and resilience shown by the people of Belgorod Oblast in defense of the Motherland during the Great Patriotic War, and for progress in reconstruction and development of national economy. On 4 January 1967, Belgorod Oblast was awarded the Order of Lenin, and in 1980 the city of Belgorod was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War, first degree.

In 2007, the city of Belgorod received the honorary title of the City of Military Glory.

In May 2023, the governor of the region claimed that a Ukrainian &quot;sabotage group&quot; entered the region. Ukrainian media identified the alleged groups as the Freedom of Russia Legion and Russian Volunteer Corps. The units claimed they had &quot;completely liberated&quot; the settlement of Kozinka in the oblast, and that they had entered Graivoron.

Government officials declared a state of emergency in the Belgorod region on 14 August 2024 during the Russo-Ukrainian War following the incursion of Ukrainian military forces into the neighboring Kursk region and many attacks on airbases within Belgorod itself.

==Geography==

Belgorod Oblast is part of the Central Black Earth economic region and the Central Federal District. It borders with Luhansk, Kharkiv, and Sumy Oblasts of Ukraine in the south and west, Kursk Oblast in the north and northwest, and Voronezh Oblast in the east. The total length of its borders is about , of which are on the border with Ukraine.
The area of the oblast is ; the oblast stretches for about from north to south and for about from east to west. The oblast is located in the southwestern and southern slopes of the Central Russian Upland in the Dnieper and Don River basins, in the steppe zone of elevated hilly plain with an average height of above the sea level. The highest point is above sea level, in Prokhorovsky District. The lowest point is located at the bottom of the Oskol and Seversky Donets River valleys.
Rivers, lakes, and marshes occupy about 1% of the oblast. There are more than 480 small rivers and streams. The largest of them are in the northwest—the Seversky Donets, Vorskla, Vorsklitsa, Psyol, and in the eastern regions—the Oskol, Tikhaya Sosna, Chyornaya Kalitva, Valuy. The total length of the river network is roughly , and in addition, there are 1,100 ponds and four artificial reservoirs.

===Climate===
The climate of Belgorod Oblast is temperate continental with a relatively mild winter with some snowfall and long summers. Average annual air temperature varies from to , being warmer on average in the southeast than the north. The coldest month is January and the frost-free period is 155–160 days, with an average of 1800 hours of sunshine. Rainfall is uneven by year and season, with an average of 540–550 mm although rainfall can dramatically differ between the western and northern areas and the warmer, drier eastern and southeast where some years lows of around have been recorded.

===Natural resources===
Over 40% of known iron ore reserves of Russia are concentrated in the oblast. Deposits are confined to the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly area. Among them are Korobkovsky, Lebedinskoye, Stoylenskoye, and prospective Prioskolskoye iron ore deposits in Stary Oskol District, Bolshetroitskoye in Shebekinsky District, as well as Yakovlevskoye and Pogremetskoye fields.

Identified and explored in varying degrees are the large deposits of bauxites, apatites, underground mineral waters, and numerous deposits of construction materials such as chalk, sand, clay, and more. There are also known occurrences of gold, graphite, and other rare metals. Geographical features make the oblast likely to have deposits of platinum, hydrocarbons, and other minerals.

===Biodiversity===
The fauna is predominantly of the meadow-steppe variety and comprises, by various estimates, from ten to fifteen thousand species. About 10% of the animal species are in need of special protection. Fifty species are included in the IUCN Red List. There are about 279 species of birds, including 152 that breed in the oblast. The richest bird populations include sparrows (111 species); waders (45 species); geese (up to 30 species); day predators (21 species). The richest bird populations include sparrows (111 species); waders (45 species); geese (up to 30 species); day predators (21 species). The numbers of game animal species are as follows: moose: 387; deer: 501; roe deer: 4474; boar: 2574; hare: 18361; fox: 3856; marten: 2025; polecat: 1120; wolf: 36. The annual number of game animals remains stable.

The vegetation reflects the features of the northern forest-steppe, characterized by the alternation of forests with the meadow steppes. It is chiefly represented by two types of vegetation—the zonal and extrazonal. In all, there are 1,284 flora species. Woodlands cover 9.8% of the total area, of which over 800 hectares are classified as protected areas because their rare species of plants and habitats of animals are on the IUCN red list.

==Culture==
The Belgorod region played a significant role in the evolution of Russian culture.
It was inhabited by different tribes besides East Slavs and was one of the earliest Rus&#x27; principalities. Belgorod region played an important role in the Russian wedding tradition of the Rushnyk. Belgorod is also famous for its wood carving.
==Politics==
During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Belgorod CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Belgorod Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Belgorod Oblast is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

The governor of Belgorod Oblast, Yevgeny Savchenko, was first appointed to this position in 1993 and subsequently re-elected in 1995, 1999, 2003, 2012 and 2017. In the 1999 election, his rival was Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Savchenko holds the title of longest-serving governor in post-Soviet Russia, being in office for 27 years. Since November 2020, Vyacheslav Gladkov is the governor of Belgorod Oblast.

On 13 September 2020, elections to the 7th Belgorod Oblast Duma were conducted. The United Russia Party has won 44 out of 50 seats, 4 seats were won by the Communist Party, 1 by the LDPR, and 1 by the Russian Party of Pensioners for Social Justice.

==Demographics==

In terms of area, the oblast is in the 67th place among the federal subjects of Russia; while in terms of population it is 30th (as of the results of the 2021 Census, down two places compared to the 2010 Census results. According to the results of the 2021 Census, the population of the oblast was 1,540,486, with the urban population of 65.2% and the rural population of 34.8%. This is up from 1,532,526 recorded in the 2010 Census, and 1,380,723 recorded in the 1989 Census.

Population density in 2008 was 56.1 persons per 1 km2. The average age is 38.5 years—35.6 for men and 41 for women; 46% of the population are economically active.

As in other regions of the European part of Russia, since the dissolution of the Soviet Union there has been a natural population decrease (about -5 per 1,000 of the population). In recent years, there has been some reversion of this decline as a result of growth of fertility and mortality. Nevertheless, despite the negative trend of growth, the population of the area has remained relatively stable because of immigration. Belgorod, in Soviet times, attracted retirement workers from the Far North and Ukraine. This trend has increased since 2005 and now cancels out the natural decline in population. Worker migrants also arrive in Belgorod from Uzbekistan; however, Muslim migrants face discrimination on a daily basis, and choose to leave.

<doc id="478859" wikidata="Q718927" url="?curid=478859" title="Physician assistant">
<text>A physician assistant or physician associate (PA) is a type of healthcare professional. While these job titles are used internationally, there is significant variation in training and scope of practice from country to country, and sometimes between smaller jurisdictions such as states or provinces. Depending on location, PAs practice semi-autonomously under the supervision of a physician, or autonomously perform a subset of medical services classically provided by physicians.

The educational model was initially based upon the accelerated training of physicians in the United States during the shortage of qualified medical providers during World War II. Since then, the use of PAs has spread to at least 16 countries around the world. In the US, PAs may diagnose illnesses, develop and manage treatment plans, prescribe medications, and serve as a principal healthcare provider. In many states PAs are required to have a direct agreement with a physician. 
In the UK, PAs were introduced in 2003. They support the work of the healthcare team, but are dependent clinicians requiring supervision from a physician. They cannot prescribe medications nor request ionising radiation investigations (e.g., x-ray) in the UK. PAs are widely used in Canada. The model began during the Korean War and transitioned to the present concept in 2002. Skills and scope of privileges are similar to those in the US.
==Nomenclature==

The occupational title of physician assistant and physician associate originated in the United States in 1967 at Duke University. The role has been adopted in the US, Canada, United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, India, Israel, Bulgaria, Myanmar, Switzerland, Liberia, Ghana, and by analogous names throughout Africa, each with their own nomenclature and education structure. In Malawi they are called clinical officers. Most of them study clinical medicine at the Malawi College of Health Sciences and other colleges within the country

==Services==
Physician assistants or associates may:
* conduct patient interviews and take medical histories
* conduct physical examinations
* order and interpret diagnostic tests and exams (&quot;As per International labour Organisation code&quot;)
* diagnose illnesses
* formulate treatment plans
* coordinate and manage care
* perform medical procedures
* prescribe medications (As per International labour organisation &quot;norms if any&quot;)
* conduct clinical research
* provide patient counselling
* offer advice on preventative health care
* first assist in surgery
* Can serve as a clinical tutor/Demostrator, assistant professor, associate professor, or professor (depending on academic qualifications along with experience).
* In Administrative sector, can serve as principal/Director, Dean etc as per experience &amp; Qualifications.

== Workplaces ==
Physician assistants or associates train to work in settings such as hospitals, clinics and other types of health facilities, or virtually via telemedicine. PAs are commonly found working in teaching and research as well as hospital administration and other clinical environments. PAs may practice in primary care or Health Sciences specialties, including emergency medicine, surgery and cardiology.

== Training ==
Physician assistant (or associate) education is shorter than a medical degree required to become a physician. It also typically does not involve residency training, although this is increasingly offered in a variety of specialties.

Renewal of certification is usually required every few years, varying by jurisdiction.

== History ==
In 1961, Charles Hudson recommended that the American Medical Association create new medical provider certifications. Eugene A. Stead of the Duke University Medical Center assembled the first class of physician assistants in 1965, composed of four former US Navy Hospital Corpsmen. He based the curriculum of the PA program on his first-hand knowledge of the fast-track training of medical doctors during World War II. Two other physicians, Richard Smith at the University of Washington, and Hu Myers at Alderson-Broaddus College launched their own programs in the mid-late 1960s. J. Willis Hurst started the Emory University Physician Assistant Program in 1967.

The Liberian model of PAs was a curriculum intended for graduates to work in areas absent of physicians as physician substitutes. Advisors for this program included UNICEF, American physicians, and Agnes N. Dagbe, MS, RN, a Liberian nurse educated in the US. Additional training was done in the USSR. The Liberian government inaugurated the program in 1965 with Dagbe as PA program.

Beginning in January 1971, the US Army produced eight classes of physician assistants, at 30 students per class, through the Academy of Health Sciences, Brooke Medical Center (academically accredited by Baylor University).

In 2017, approximately 68% of physician assistants in the United States were women and approximately 32% were men.

The profession expanded globally. It can now be found in Afghanistan, Australia, Canada, Germany, Ghana, India, Israel, Liberia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom. As a profession, physician assistants have greatly influenced the theory and conceptualization of socially accountable health professional education.

==Jurisdictions==

=== Australia ===
In 2011, Health Workforce Australia began developing the role of physician assistant throughout the country culminating with registration and a PA Program based out of James Cook University. The Australian Society of Physician Assistants in 2011 published a code of practice. Despite all initial indicators showing that the new profession would be successfully integrated into the health care system, in 2013 it was reported that the progress had floundered resulting in the majority of PAs in Australia being unemployed.

===Canada===
As of 2024, there are approximately 1000 physician assistants working in healthcare settings in Canada. The first formally trained physician assistants graduated in 1984 from the Canadian Forces Medical Services School at Borden, Ontario. The Canadian Medical Association (CMA) recognized physician assistants as a health professional in 2003. Physician assistants are able to perform medical functions such as ordering tests, diagnosing diseases, prescribing medications, treating patients, educating patients and performing various medical and surgical procedures. Physician assistants are labeled under the federal government national occupational classification code 3124: allied primary health practitioners.

==== Education and certification (Canada) ====

The first civilian physician assistant education programs were launched in 2008 at the University of Manitoba and McMaster University. In 2010, a third civilian program was launched by the consortium of physician assistant education (University of Toronto, Northern Ontario School of Medicine, and The Michener Institute) while further programmes were added in 2024 at Dalhousie University and at the University of Calgary. A new programme has been announced to be housed at the University of Saskatchewan to start in 2025.

In Canada, the education of a physician assistant generally consists of three years of professional post-graduate university education. The education is delivered over a two calendar year time-frame by completing fall, winter and summer semesters for both years of the program in either a master level university physician assistant program or post-graduate professional university bachelor level physician assistant program. Physician assistant graduates become eligible for the certification exam by being a graduate of a Canadian physician assistant program that is recognized by the Physician Assistant Certification Council of Canada (Canadian Armed Forces physician assistant program, University of Manitoba, McMaster University and the consortium of physician assistant education all of which are accredited by the Canadian Medical Association).

====Scope of practice (Canada)====
As of 2023 PAs in Canada may:
Physician assistants resemble and provide many of the functions of physicians. Physician Assistants (PA) are academically prepared health care professionals who provide a broad range of medical services. PAs are physician extenders and not independent practitioners; they work with a degree of autonomy, negotiated and agreed on by the supervising physician(s) and the PA. PAs can work in any clinical setting to extend physician services. PAs complement existing services and aid in improving patient access to health care. A relationship with a supervising physician is essential to the role of the PA. &quot; Physician assistants may be compared to the role of nurse practitioner by the general public and may be confused as the same profession. Nurse practitioners in Canada practice under an advanced nursing model. Physician assistants practice under a medical model, similarly modeled after medical school (physician) education. Nurse practitioners practice within their defined specific scope of practice autonomously and sometimes collaboratively. The defined scopes of a nurse practitioner include the areas of (family care, adults and paediatrics). Physician assistants are permitted to practice in all medical specialties by mirroring the practice of a physician with a full range of skills and scope by practicing both autonomously as a clinician and collaboratively with physicians when required. Some examples of practice areas for physician assistants include (emergency medicine, critical care medicine, cardiology, psychiatry, community and family medicine, neurology, surgery, orthopaedics, internal medicine, oncology, gastroenterology, military medicine, respirology, dermatology, women&#x27;s health and many more specialities). Physician assistants may perform certain roles which have been traditionally only provided by physicians in clinical practice, making the PA&#x27;s medical training over other providers unique in this regard.

==== Compensation (Canada) ====
Physician assistant salaries in civilian practice in Canada are relatively new and can range from approximately $80,000 CAD for entry level positions to $142,000 CAD a year for experienced providers which are not on call and up to $178,000 CAD for experienced providers which are on call. The physician assistant profession is newer to civilian practice in Canada. The compensation report published in 2019 by the Canadian Association of Physician Assistants outlines the typical salaries across Canada being an entry median salary of approximately $80,000 CAD and an experienced median salary of approximately $105,000 CAD.

==== Regulation (Canada) ====
Physician assistants are currently practicing across Canada in the Canadian Armed Forces as commissioned officers in domestic and international environments and have been in practice since the 1960s. Physician assistants outside of the Canadian Armed Forces practice usually in the public health care system in the provinces of Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Alberta. Physician assistants have been regulated in Manitoba since 1999 and in New Brunswick since 2009 and are registrants of their respective provincial college of physicians and surgeons. Physician assistants in Ontario were introduced in 2007 to the public health system as a joint venture between the Ontario Ministry of Health and the Ontario Medical Association. In PEI, regulation has been mandatory since June 2023. In Alberta, PAs regulation is in effect since 2021. In Nova Scotia, regulation becomes compulsory since 2024. In Ontario, PAs will be regulated from 1 April 2025.
In Saskatchewan, regulation for PAs is now in effect.
Physician assistants are represented by the Canadian Association of Physician Assistants, which originally was formed in October 1999.
As of 2023, PAs scope of practice in Canada is described at their website:
:The PA&#x27;s scope of practice is determined on an individual basis and formally outlined in a practice contract or agreement between the supervising physician(s), the PA and often the facility or service where the PA will work. Activities may include conducting patient interviews, histories and physical examinations; performing selected diagnostic and therapeutic interventions or procedures; and counseling patients on preventive health care.

=== Germany ===
Physician Assistants / Associates were established in Germany as a degree course in 2005. (&quot;:de:Arztassistent&quot; ). Recruitment had initially been slow, but as of 2019 there were said to be several hundred &quot;:de:Arztassistenten&quot; in Germany.

=== India ===
The first PA program in India was established in 1992 with a focus on expanding cardiovascular specialty . Since then, multiple programs have developed (~130), most of them at baccalaureate level with four master&#x27;s level programs. As on 2024, an estimated 10,000 PAs have graduated in India. With the enactment of the National Commission of Allied and Healthcare professions Act in 2021 in the Parliament, the profession is a recognised one. Physician Assistants in India are now referred to as &#x27;Physician Associates.&#x27; Formation of a council for Allied and Healthcare professions is underway at the National level and in the different states. Efforts towards regulation of the profession, standardization of the curriculum, accreditation of training institutes etc., are also underway(As January 2025).

=== Ireland ===
Physician Associates were introduced by the Health Service Executive in the mid-2010&#x27;s. The Royal College of Surgeons has offered a PA postgraduate degree since 2016, with 28 graduating by . PAs may not write prescriptions.

=== Israel ===
Physician Assistants were introduced in Israel in May 2016 to help augment a shrinking physician workforce. The initial training programs have been overseen by the ministry of health directly, but transition to academic training is planned. Israeli PA education is modeled after United States&#x27; and Netherlands&#x27; approaches, and has focused on former paramedics with bachelor&#x27;s degrees. As of 2022, the 100 or so PAs in Israel work exclusively within Emergency Departments. While PA scope of practice includes many emergency procedures, Israeli PAs are not currently allowed to prescribe or administer medicine in non-emergency settings.

=== New Zealand ===
In February 2015, Health Workforce New Zealand completed a Phase-2 trial of PAs who worked for a period of two years (2013–2015) in four clinical settings. Specifically, the sites included one rural emergency department and three primary care settings (two rural and one urban) located on the North and South Islands of New Zealand. At conclusion of the trial, several clinics continued to employ PAs while the process of health regulation makes its way through the government bureaucracy.

=== United Kingdom ===
The position of physician assistant was established in the United Kingdom in 2005. It evolved from that of physician assistant, developed in the US in the 1960s. In 2012, a group of physician assistants voted to change the name to &quot;physician associate&quot;, this title has been criticised, however, as it is similar to the title &quot;Associate Physician&quot;, which represents a senior medical doctor. Hillingdon Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was asked to manage the recruitment of 200 physician associates who are expected to come from the US for 40 NHS trusts in September 2015.

Physician Associates will be regulated by the General Medical Council from 13 December 2024. They are currently not able to prescribe or order tests which require ionising radiation. Legally, physician associates must practice under the supervision of a medical doctor/surgeon.

In July 2023 a motion was brought forward for discussion by the British Medical Association to rename PAs as Physician Assistants in the U.K. to avoid role confusion with Physicians and for them to be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council, however, the British Medical Association is a trade union for doctors and is not a regulatory body; it therefore has no statutory power to set a scope of practice, rename the profession or decide on a regulatory body.

==== Faculty of Physician Associates, Royal College of Physicians (UK) ====
The Faculty of Physician Associates is currently the professional body for Physician Associates working in the United Kingdom. A joint venture between the Royal College of Physicians of London and the previous professional body, the United Kingdom Association of Physician Associates, the Faculty officially launched in July 2015, taking over all professional responsibilities. The Faculty oversees the managed voluntary register, which all practising associates are encouraged to join, and sets and runs the National Assessment Examination and National Recertification Examination which is optional for PAs.

====Scope of practice (UK)====
In the United Kingdom, PAs are dependent practitioners, and they must practice under the supervision of a physician. They perform tasks such as taking medical histories, ordering and interpreting laboratory tests.

There is no nationally agreed upon scope of practice for Physician Associates in the United Kingdom as of 2024, despite them working in the United Kingdom for over a decade.

==== Regulation (UK) ====
The title physician associate was not legally protected in the UK until December 2024. Since June 2010, physician associates have been able to obtain membership of the Managed Voluntary Register for physician associates. This database, run by PAs for PAs, aims to identify all qualified PAs who are able to practise. Its intent is to maintain high standards. To remain on the voluntary register, physician associates are required to re-certify every 5–6 years.

In 2018 Matt Hancock announced a plan to regulate PAs. The General Medical Council begins to regulate PAs on 13 December 2024.

==== Training (UK) ====
Training is through a two-year training programme (MSc) in Physician Associate Studies, although some PAs in the United Kingdom only hold a PgDip in Physician Associate Studies. at least 32 universities offered these programs:
* University of Bolton
* University of Hertfordshire
* Queen Mary University of London
* University of Aberdeen
* University of Bradford
* Anglia Ruskin University
* University of Birmingham
* Canterbury Christ Church University
* University of East Anglia
* Hull York Medical School
* University of Leeds
* Manchester Medical School
* University of Liverpool
* University of Central Lancashire
* Newcastle University
* Plymouth University
* University of Reading
* Sheffield Hallam University
* St George&#x27;s, University of London
* University of Surrey
* University of Wolverhampton
* University of Worcester
Entry requirements vary, especially in terms of required first degree subject. For example, University of Bradford requires a 2:1 (or above) undergraduate degree in a Life Science, Biomedical Science, or Healthcare subject. Under exceptional circumstances, experience in healthcare practice may contribute/compensate absent the above requirements.

=== United States ===
====Nomenclature (US)====
In accordance with the American Academy of Physician Associates (AAPA), the official title of the profession in the United States is &quot;Physician Associate&quot;. While this is the official title used by the national organization, utilization of this title may vary on the state and local level based on state and local bylaws and policies. Many hospital and healthcare systems still use physician assistant as titles, with some just resorting to using &quot;PA&quot; to avoid confusion with physicians.

A physician assistant may use the initials &quot;PA&quot;, &quot;PA-C&quot;, &quot;APA-C&quot;, &quot;RPA&quot; or &quot;RPA-C&quot;, where the &quot;-C&quot; indicates &quot;Certified&quot; and the &quot;R&quot; indicates &quot;Registered&quot;. The &quot;R&quot; designation is unique to a few states, mainly in the Northeast. APA stands for aeromedical physician assistant and indicates that a physician assistant successfully completed the US Army Flight Surgeon Primary Course. During training, PA students are designated PA-S. The use of &quot;PA-C&quot; is limited to certified PAs who comply with the regulations of the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants and who have passed PANCE.

Students undertaking physician assistant or associate training may refer to themselves as a physician assistant student, physician associate student, student physician assistant or student physician associate. PA students may add &quot;S&quot; at the end of their student designation (PA-S). Students may also use the corresponding year of their training in their student designation. For example, students in the second year of their physician assistant or physician associate training may use (PA-S2) as their student designation.

The American Academy of Physician Associates has spent over $22 million since 2018 campaigning to change the word &quot;assistant&quot; to &quot;associate&quot; in the title of physician assistant. The campaign has been heavily criticized by physicians, but advocates argue that the revised title more accurately reflects the clinician&#x27;s role on the patient care team.

In the United States, the profession is represented by the American Academy of Physician Associates. All PAs must graduate from a nationally accredited ARC-PA program as well as passing the national certification exam. In 1970 the American Medical Association passed a resolution to develop educational guidelines and certification procedures for PAs. The Duke University Medical Center Archives had established the Physician Assistant History Center, dedicated to the study, preservation, and presentation of the history of the profession. The PA History Center became its own institution in 2011, was renamed the PA History Society, and relocated to Johns Creek, Georgia.

==== Education and certification (US) ====
, 243 accredited PA programs operated in the United States, with dozens more in development. Most educational programs are graduate programs leading to the award of master&#x27;s degrees in either Physician Assistant Studies, Health Science (Master of Health Science), or Medical Science (MMSc), and require a bachelor&#x27;s degree and Graduate Record Examination or Medical College Admission Test scores for entry. The majority of PA programs in the United States employ the CASPA application for selecting students. Professional licensure is regulated by state medical boards. PA students train at medical schools and academic medical centers across the country.

PA education is based on medical education; it typically requires 2 to 3 years of full-time graduate study like most master&#x27;s degrees. (Medical school lasts four years plus a specialty-specific residency.) Training consists of classroom and laboratory instruction in medical and behavioral sciences, followed by clinical rotations in internal medicine, family medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, emergency medicine, and geriatric medicine, as well as elective rotations. PAs are not required to complete residencies after they complete their schooling (unlike physicians). Postgraduate training programs are offered in certain specialties for PAs, though these are optional and shorter in length than medical residency.

PA clinical postgraduate programs are clinical training programs that differ from on the job training given their inclusion of education and supervised clinical experience to meet learning objectives. Montefiore Medical Center Postgraduate Surgical Physician Assistant Program was established in 1971 as the first recognized clinical postgraduate PA program. 49 programs address specialties such as Neurology, Trauma/Critical Care and Oncology. 50 programs joined the Association of Postgraduate Physician Assistant Programs to establish educational standards for postgraduate PA programs.

In the United States, a graduate from an accredited PA program must pass the NCCPA-administered Physician Assistant National Certifying Exam (PANCE) before becoming a PA-C; this certification is required for licensure in all states. The content of the exam is covered in the PANCE BLUEPRINT. In addition, a PA must log 100 Continuing Medical Education hours and reregister his or her certificate with the NCCPA every two years. Every ten years (formerly six years), a PA must also recertify by successfully completing the Physician Assistant National Recertifying Exam (PANRE)
There is a growing number of doctoral programs for certified PAs leading to a Doctor of Medical Science (DMSc) but there is no requirement for one to have a doctorate in order to practice.
&quot;National Physician Assistant Week&quot; is celebrated annually in the US from October 6 through October 12. This week was chosen to commemorate the anniversary of the first graduating physician assistant class at Duke University on October 6, 1967. October 6 is also the birthday of the profession&#x27;s founder, Eugene A. Stead Jr., MD.

====Scope of practice (US)====
Physician assistants have their own licenses with distinct scope of practice. Each of the 50 states has different laws regarding the prescription of medications by PAs and the licensing authority granted to each category within that particular state through the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). PAs in Kentucky and Puerto Rico are not allowed to prescribe any controlled substances.
Several other states place a limit on the type of controlled substance or the quantity that can be prescribed, dispensed, or administered by a PA.
Depending upon the specific laws of any given state board of medicine, the PA must have a formal relationship on file with a collaborative physician. The collaborating physician must also be licensed in the state in which the PA is working, although he or she may physically be located elsewhere. Physician collaboration can be in person, by telecommunication systems or by other reliable means (for example, availability for consultation). In emergency departments the laws governing PA practice differ by state, generally allowing a broad scope of practice and limited direct supervision.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, several state governments changed regulations regarding PA scope of practice, including:
* On May 21, 2020, the law S.B. 1915 was signed by Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt. This law allows Physician Assistants to become primary care providers and receive direct pay from insurers. The reference of &quot;supervision&quot; was changed to &quot;delegating&quot; in regards to physician responsibility. This law also allows PAs to legally volunteer in the case of disaster or emergency.
* On May 27, 2020, Governor Tim Walz signed into Minnesota law the Omnibus Healthcare Bill S.F. 13. This law removes references to physician responsibility of supervision and delegation of care provided by PAs. The law also removes delegated prescriptive authority.

==== Employment (US) ====

The first employer of PAs was the then-Veterans Administration, known today as the Department of Veterans Affairs. Today it is the largest single employer of PAs, employing nearly 2,000.

According to the AAPA, as of 2020 there are more than 148,560 certified PAs in the United States, up from 115,547 in 2016.

&quot;Money&quot; magazine, in conjunction with Salary.com, listed the PA profession as the &quot;fifth best job in America&quot; in May 2006, based both on salary and job prospects, and on an anticipated 10-year job growth of 49.65%. In 2010, CNN Money rated the physician assistant career as the number two best job in America.
In 2012, Forbes rated the physician assistant degree as the number one master&#x27;s degree for jobs.
In 2015, Glassdoor rated physician assistant as the number one best job in America.
In 2021, U.S. News &amp; World Report rated physician assistant as the number one best job in America.

The US Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics report on PAs states, &quot;...Employment of physician assistants is projected to grow 37 percent from 2016 to 2026, much faster than the average for all occupations...&quot; This is due to several factors, including an expanding health care industry, an aging baby-boomer population, concerns for cost containment, and newly implemented restrictions to shorten physician resident work hours.

In the 2008 AAPA census, 56 percent of responding PAs worked in physicians&#x27; offices or clinics and 24 percent were employed by hospitals. The remainder were employed in public health clinics, nursing homes, schools, prisons, home health care agencies, and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs Fifteen percent of responding PAs work in counties classified as non-metropolitan by Economic Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture; approximately 17% of the US population resides in these counties.

For PAs in primary care practice, malpractice insurance policies with $100,000–300,000 in coverage can cost less than $600 per year; premiums are higher for PAs in higher-risk specialties.

==== Compensation (US) ====

According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2020 the median pay for physician assistants working full-time was $115,390 per year or $55.48 per hour, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $162,470. Physician assistants in emergency medicine, dermatology, and surgical subspecialties may earn up to $200,000 per year.

==== Federal government, uniformed services, and US armed forces (US) ====
PAs are employed by the United States Department of State as &quot;foreign service health practitioners&quot;. PAs working in this capacity may be deployed anywhere in the world where there is a State Department facility. They provide primary care to US government employees and their families in American embassies and consulates around the world. An important part of their jobs is to get to know what resources are available locally that they can count on in an emergency. They have other important roles, such as advising their ambassadors on the health situation in the country and provide health education to the diplomatic community. In order to be considered for the position, these PAs must be licensed and have at least two years of recent experience in primary care.

Military PAs serve in the White House Medical Unit, where they provide care to the president and vice president and their families as well as White House staff.

They are employed by several organizations with the intelligence community, specifically the Central Intelligence Agency. While much of the job description is classified, they work under the Directorate of Support and are deployed to &quot;austere environments&quot; where they provide medical care, including trauma stabilization, and teach in the fields of survival, field medicine, and tactical combat casualty care.

United States Army PAs serve as Medical Specialist Corps officers, typically within Army combat or combat support battalions located in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and overseas. These include infantry, armor, cavalry, airborne, artillery, and (if the PA qualifies) special forces units. They serve as the &quot;front line&quot; of Army medicine and along with combat medics are responsible for the total health care of soldiers assigned to their unit, as well as of their family members.

PAs also serve in the Air Force and Navy as clinical practitioners and aviation medicine specialists, as well as in the Coast Guard and Public Health Service. The skills required for these PAs are similar to that of their civilian colleagues, but additional training is provided in advanced casualty care, medical management of chemical injuries, aviation medicine, and military medicine. In addition, military PAs are also required to meet the officer commissioning requirements, and maintain the professional and physical readiness standards of their respective services.

The marine physician assistant is a US Merchant Marine staff officer. A certificate of registry is granted through The United States Coast Guard National Maritime Center located in Martinsburg, West Virginia. Formal training programs for marine physician assistants began in September, 1966 at the Public Service Health Hospital located in Staten Island, N.Y.

===South Korea===
On 28 August 2024, the National Assembly passed a bill that would authorize some nurses to aid physicians: &quot;The bill, which authorizes physician assistant nurses to support physicians during surgery and handle some duties presently reserved for doctors.&quot;

<text>Hilltop Youth (, &quot;No&#x27;ar HaGva&#x27;ot&quot;) are extremist Hardal settler youth operating in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. They are known for establishing outposts without an Israeli legal basis and conducting settler violence against Palestinians there.

==Overview==
The movement is based on the ideology of Kahanism, which advocates for the expulsion of Palestinian Arabs from both Israel and the occupied territories. Members linked to the group have engaged in Israeli settler violence against Palestinians, as well as against Israeli soldiers.

The acts of settler violence includes vandalism of Palestinian schools and mosques, stealing sheep from Palestinian flocks and the destruction of their centuries-old olive groves, or stealing their olive harvests. In the most notable attack, members of the groups perpetrated the 2015 Duma arson attack against a Palestinian family, burning their 18-month-old baby alive and injuring the parents. Though the group has no strict hierarchy Israeli authorities believe Meir Ettinger to be its leader. 

In 2024, following rising settler attacks, the European Union put Hilltop Youth as well as the related Lehava groups on its asset freeze and visa bans, declaring them to be extremist organizations.

==Origins==
On 16 November 1998, in what was viewed as a declaration intended to thwart peace talks, and in particular the implementation of his political rival Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s Wye River agreement with the Palestinian National Authority, the then-Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon urged settler youth to &quot;grab the hilltops&quot;, adding, &quot;Everyone that&#x27;s there should move, should run, should grab more hills, expand the territory. Everything that&#x27;s grabbed will be in our hands. Everything we don&#x27;t grab will be in their hands.&quot;

People proceeded to heed his exhortation and outposts proliferated, in a practice often called &quot;creating facts on the ground&quot;, but many would later feel betrayed by Sharon when the Israeli West Bank barrier he devised in 2005 cut off many of the illegal communities from the expanded Israel Sharon envisaged at that time.

The example of figures like Netanel Ozeri, who moved his family out of the safety of Kiryat Arba&#x27;s perimeters to build an outpost, Hilltop 26, on nearby Palestinian land, was also important: Ozeri was later shot dead by Palestinian gunmen.

== Influences ==
According to terrorism expert Ami Pedahzur, ideologically, Hilltop Youth espouse a Kahanist worldview, favouring &quot;deportation, revenge, and annihilation of Gentiles that posed a threat to the people of Israel&quot;.

The youth are influenced by religious Zionist ideals, which include a dedication to building and farming the land, as well as devoting time to learning Torah. Many have studied in the Od Yosef Chai yeshiva under Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh, who developed the metaphor comparing Israel to a &quot;nut&quot; which had to be cracked in order to allow the fruit, the people, out. In addition to basing their ideals on the teachings of prominent rabbis such as Avraham Yitzchak Kook and Rabbi Shmuel Tal, some regard Avri Ran as a spiritual leader, or &quot;father&quot;, of the movement, though he does not see himself as such. The philosophy of some in the movement is expressed by a mixture of distrust of the Israeli government and a desire to re-establish the Ancient Kingdom of Israel.

=== Hardal anti-Zionism ===

A recent ideological development has led to many Hilltop Youth rejecting Zionism due to Israeli concessions and the perceived Zionist inability to establish Jewish control over the entirety of the Land of Israel.

==About the groups==

The Hilltop Youth are a &quot;loosely organized, anarchy-minded group&quot;, of some several hundred youths around a hard core of scores of violent activists often noted for establishing illegal/disputed outposts outside existing settlements. According to Danny Rubinstein they are formed into private militias. Their numbers (2009) are estimated to be around 800, with approximately 5,000 others who share their ideological outlook. They completely dissociate themselves from Israeli institutions, and identify themselves with the Land of Israel. They settle on hilltops in areas densely crowded by Palestinians.

Members linked to the group have been accused of engaging in Israeli settler violence, including vandalism of Palestinian schools and mosques, stealing sheep from Palestinian flocks and the destruction of their centuries-old olive groves, or stealing their olive harvests. This last practice was endorsed by Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu on a visit to a hilltop outpost, Havat Gilad, where he issued a rabbinical ruling that, &quot;The ground on which the trees are planted is the inheritance of the Jewish people, and the fruit of the plantings was seeded by the &quot;goyim&quot; in land that is not theirs.&quot; They seize land not by any official method: they claim a hilltop by setting up an encampment, and then claim the land nearby, whether under Palestinian cultivation or not, or by uprooting Palestinian trees and shooting in the air if any Palestinian comes near to the new outpost.
Settlers have long been accused of carrying out what are called &quot;price tag attacks&quot;, a term used for targeting Palestinian property in revenge for outposts demolished by the Israeli military, although no one as yet has actually been convicted of having been involved in such vandalism.

Many of the Hilltop Youth feel that the mainstream settler movement has lost its way, opting for cheap housing close to major cities, built by local Arab labor, with tall fences and no space between their homes. The Youth often engage in organic farming and shun Palestinian labor in favor of Hebrew labor. 2.5% of eggs consumed in Israel are calculated to be produced on the outposts run by the Hilltop Youth leader Avri Ran.
== Government response ==

The Hilltop Youth has been condemned in the past by figures within Israel&#x27;s government, with Former Defense Minister Ehud Barak referring to the group as unacceptable &quot;homemade terror, Jewish-made terror&quot;.
The Israeli Security Agency&#x27;s leader, Ronen Bar, in a August 2024 to Israeli ministers, wrote: &quot;&quot;The &#x27;hilltop youth&#x27; trend has long become a bed of violent activity against Palestinians … it&#x27;s the use of violence to create intimidation&quot;, to &quot;fear monger, meaning terrorism.&quot; Such acts were now &quot;broad, open activity&quot;, wrote Bar, now &quot;using weapons of war. Sometimes using weapons that were distributed by the state lawfully … attacking the security forces … receiving legitimacy from certain officials in the establishment&quot;. As a result, the hilltop youth experienced &quot;loss of fear of administrative detention due to the conditions they get in prison and the money given to them upon their release by MKs, together with legitimization and praise&quot;.

==Notable members==

Meir Ettinger (born 4 October 1991), the grandson of Meir Kahane, previously resided at Ramat Migron outpost, and later the Givat Ronen outpost near Har Brakha, was subsequently deported, by administrative order, from the West Bank and Jerusalem, taking up residence with his family in Safed. He has attracted many followers and in addition to public speaking, he has published a blog at the pro-Hilltop Youth website &quot;The Jewish Voice&quot; (Hebrew: הקול היהודי). He was arrested for the &quot;spy affair&quot;, when settler youths were accused of maintaining an &quot;operation room&quot; to monitor IDF movements and warn outpost settlers of impending evacuations. After violating his house arrest terms, he was held in jail until the end of his trial, in which he was convicted following a plea-bargain for &quot;conspiring to gather military intelligence&quot; and sentenced to time served, approximately 6 months. In August 2015, following the arson at the Church of the Multiplication in June and the Duma arson attack, he was placed under administrative arrest for 6 months, which was extended by an additional 4 months. During his incarceration, he staged a hunger strike. In June 2016, following his release, he returned to reside in Safed, and is barred by administrative order from entering the West Bank, Jerusalem, and Yad Binyamin. In addition, he is forbidden, by administrative order, from contacting 92 people.

==Sanctions==
In 2024, responding to rising Israeli settler attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank, the European Union put Hilltop Youth as well as related Lehava groups on its asset freeze and visa bans, declaring them to be extremist organizations.

<text>Belgorod (, ) is a city that serves as the administrative center of Belgorod Oblast, Russia, located on the Seversky Donets River, approximately north of the border with Ukraine. It has a population of 

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Belgorod&quot; (Белгород) in Russian literally means &quot;white city&quot;, a compound of &quot;&quot; (&quot;bely&quot;, &quot;white, light&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;gorod&quot;, &quot;town, city&quot;). The name is a reference to the region&#x27;s historical abundance of limestone.

==Demographics==

The population of Belgorod is 339,978 as of the most recent censuses:
As of the 2021 Census, the ethnic composition of Belgorod was:
1149,931 people (or 44.1% of the population) residing in Belgorod did not state their ethnicity in the 2021 census.

==Geography==
===Urban layout===
Like many Russian cities, Belgorod began as a fortified settlement. The oldest Belgorod fortress was built at the end of the 16th century on a chalk mountain. According to scientific excavations and surviving archival data, the first fortress outpost was erected in 1596. The site of the construction of the defensive facility was the top of the Belaya Gora (&quot;White Mountain&quot;). This is the highest point of the right bank of the Seversky Donets channel. On 17 September 1650, voivode Vasily Petrovich Golovin laid the foundation for the third Belgorod Fortress on the left bank of the Vezenitsa River, which flows into the Seversky Donets. In the fall of 1650, a wooden fort with 11 towers was attached to the rampart of the Belgorod line, which runs from the fortress town Bolkhovets to the mouth of the Vezelka River in the area of the former brewery. The two parts of the city were connected by the Nikolskaya Passage Tower located in the eastern wall of the Kremlin. The position of the eastern wall of the Kremlin corresponded to the modern street of the 50th anniversary of the Belgorod Oblast. With the expansion of the borders of the Russian state, the military significance of the Belgorod fortress gradually decreased and by the middle of the 18th century, only the Kremlin remained from the formidable fortress.
In the fall of 1766, the new governor, Andrei Fliverk pushed for a new city plan. A regular street plan was developed and signed on 18 April 1767. The architect&#x27;s signature is not legible, but it may have been signed by Andrey Kvasov. The central part of the plan was occupied by an octahedral &quot;marketplace&quot; with 64 stone shops and 20 warehouse barns. Moskovskaya, Kievskaya, Voronezhskaya and Kharkovskaya streets ran from the trading area in four directions. According to the plan, it was supposed to divide the entire city into 16 quarters, 4 of which should be built up with stone houses, and the rest with wooden and huts. The plan was executed formally without taking into account the buildings that survived the fire, the Kremlin fortress and the terrain. On 28 April 1768, a new plan was developed under the leadership of Andrey Kvasov who was the author of a number of city plans. The plans overlaid the old city center layout and the projected one. It provided for a trading area, which in the west adjoined the fortress Kremlin, and in the east ended with stone benches of the Gostiny dvor in the form of two arcs. The central planning axis was also chosen relative to which the directions of mutually perpendicular streets were formed.

Travel notes which were published in 1781 showed the location of a sketch of the ramparts of the lost ancient settlement. Only in the middle of the 1950s, the archaeologist Arkady Nikitin carried out excavations at the site of the first fortress, where the remains of ancient ramparts and ditches were still clearly visible. though the fortress itself was destroyed already in the 1860s during the construction of the railway the eastern part of the chalk mountain, on which the Kremlin was located, was collapsed. The location of the first fortress approximately corresponded to the location of the modern car market on Byelaya Gora.

In the 1780s, during the general survey of the Russian lands, several plans of Belgorod were fulfilled. When drawing up plans, an overlay of the old and new layouts of Kvasov was used. The plans described above give a distorted position of church estates, which were fixed when the city was laid and, as a rule, did not change. The plan, signed by the titular adviser Salkov, is the most accurate plan of Belgorod in the second half of the 18th century.
===Climate===
Belgorod&#x27;s climate is humid continental (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot; slightly cooler than &quot;Dfa&quot;) featuring moderate precipitation.
Winters are rather cold and changeable with frequent warmings followed by rains. Temperatures may occasionally fall below for about one week or more. Summer is warm and either humid and rainy or hot and droughty. Autumn is mild and rainy. The Belgorod reservoirs get covered with ice by the end of November or the beginning of December, and the ice layer typically lasts until March or April.
*average year temperature: + 7.7 °C
*average humidity: 76%
*average wind speed: 5–7 m/s

==History==
===Before the 20th century===

There was a settlement of the Slavic tribe of Severians in the area, which was probably destroyed at the beginning of the 10th century by the nomadic Pechenegs. In 965, the lands in the upper reaches of Seversky Donets were annexed to the Principality of Pereyaslavl.

Records first mention the settlement in 1237, when the Mongol-led army of Batu Khan ravaged it during the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27;. It is unclear whether this Belgorod stood on the same site as the current city. In 1596 Tsar Feodor Ioannovich of Russia ordered its re-establishment as one of numerous forts set up to defend Russian southern borders from the Crimean Tatars. Belgorod was part of a chain of fortification lines, created by Grand Duchy of Moscow and later the Tsardom of Russia to protect it from the Crimean–Nogai slave raids that ravaged the southern provinces of the country during the Russo-Crimean Wars. The tsar appointed two princes-governors to supervise the construction of Belgorod: Mikhail Vasilyevich Nozdrovaty and Andrei Romanovich Volkonsky. The first Belgorod fortress was built on the high right bank of the Seversky Donets, in the area of the current car market; the Belgorod Kremlin was close to the present-day Belaya Gora restaurant. The legendary White Mountain has not survived, as it was completely torn down for chalk mining in the 1950s.

The first Belgorod fortress stood for sixteen years, withstanding several major attacks, both from the Tatars and from the Polish–Lithuanian troops who participated in the wars with the Russian state during the Time of Troubles. In 1612 the Belgorod fortress was taken and burned by a detachment of Lithuanians. The governor, Nikita Likharev, by order of the tsar, was already building the second Belgorod fortress on the opposite bank of the Seversky Donets the following year, 1613. Over the next decades, Belgorodians repulsed a large number of attacks on their lands. By the middle of the 17th century, the question arose about the construction of a new Belgorod fortress three kilometers south of the existing one.

In the 17th century Belgorod suffered repeatedly from Tatar incursions, against which Russia built (from 1633 to 1740) an earthen wall, with twelve forts, extending upwards of from the Vorskla in the west to the Don in the east, and called the . In 1666 the Moscow Patriarchate established an archiepiscopal see in the town.

Tsar Peter the Great visited Belgorod on the eve of the Battle of Poltava in 1709.

After the Russian border moved south following successful wars against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the second half of the 17th century, the strategic importance of the city gradually decreased, and on 13 May 1785, by decree of Catherine II, Belgorod was excluded from the number of fortresses of the Russian Empire. From that moment on, the city plunged into the measured provincial life of the central black earth zone of Russia. Military life was replaced by agricultural life, the number of spiritual, educational, industrial and commercial institutions were growing, and in the historical chronicles of the Russian Empire, the city seems to have fallen asleep for a century. The Belgorod province disappeared from the geographical maps, and the city was for a long time a part of the first Kursk Governorate, then the Kursk province, and, finally, the Kursk region. A dragoon regiment had its base in the town until 1917. 

Joasaph of Belgorod, an 18th-century bishop of Belgorod and Oboyanska, became widely venerated as a miracle worker and was glorified as a saint of the Russian Orthodox Church in 1911.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Soviet power was established in the city on 26 October (8 November) 1917. On 10 April 1918, troops of the Imperial German Army occupied Belgorod. After the conclusion of the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty of 9 February 1918 the demarcation line passed to the north of the city. Belgorod became part of the newly proclaimed Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (February to May 1918) and Ukrainian State headed by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi.

On 20 December 1918, after the overthrow of German-backed Skoropadskyi, the Soviet Red Army regained control over the city, which became part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. From 24 December 1918 to 7 January 1919, the Provisional Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Government of Ukraine, then led by General Georgy Pyatakov, was based in Belgorod. The city served as the temporary capital of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. From 23 June to 7 December 1919, the Volunteer Army occupied the town as part of White-controlled South Russia.

From September 1925, the territorial 163rd Infantry Regiment of the 55th Infantry Division of Kursk was stationed in Belgorod. In September 1939, it was deployed to the 185th Infantry Division.

On 2 March 1935, the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union decided to allocate the city of Belgorod, Kursk region, into an independent administrative unit directly subordinate to the Kursk Regional Executive Committee.

The German Wehrmacht occupied Belgorod from 25 October 1941 to 9 February 1943. The Germans operated a forced labour battalion for Jews in the city. The Germans re-captured it on 18 March 1943 in the final move of the Third Battle of Kharkov. On 12 July 1943, during the Battle of Kursk, the largest tank battle in world history took place near Prokhorovka, and the Red Army definitively retook the city on 5/6 August 1943. The is one of the World War II monuments commemorating the event.
In 1954, the city became the administrative center of Belgorod Oblast and rapidly developed as a regional industrial and cultural center. The major educational centers of the city are Belgorod State University, the Belgorod Technological University, the , and the Financial Academy. Belgorod Drama Theater is named after the famous 19th-century actor Mikhail Shchepkin, who was born in this region.

On 22 April 2013, a mass shooting occurred at approximately 2:20 PM Moscow time on a street in Belgorod. The shooter, identified as 31-year-old Sergey Pomazun (), opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle on several people at a gun store and on a sidewalk, killing all six people whom he hit: three people at the store and three passers-by, including two teenage girls. Pomazun was apprehended after an extensive day-long manhunt; during his arrest, he wounded a policeman with a knife. He was sentenced to life in prison on 23 August 2013.

There were several attacks on Belgorod during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russian officials claimed that Belgorod was repeatedly targeted by indiscriminate Ukrainian attacks. On 1 April 2022, two Ukrainian Mi-24 performed a night raid and set fire to a fuel depot in Belgorod, in a low-altitude airstrike. On 20 April 2023, a Russian Su-34 fighter jet accidentally dropped a bomb on the city, leaving a crater across and injuring two people. On 22 April, more than 3,000 people were evacuated from their homes after an undetonated explosive was found; it was not known if the second bomb had come from the same aircraft. On 30 December, a Ukrainian airstrike killed 25 people and wounded over 100. In March 2024, authorities began evacuating 9,000 children from the city and wider region due to shelling and drone attacks. On 6 May, at least six people were killed following a Ukrainian drone strike. On 12 May, 16 people were killed when a section of an apartment block collapsed. Russian MOD claimed it as a Ukrainian missile strike. CIT investigators said the building was most likely hit by a Russian bomb, as the explosion occurred on the North-Eastern side of the building, opposite to the border with Ukraine.

==Administrative and municipal status==

Belgorod is the administrative center of the oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Belgorod—an administrative unit with status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Belgorod is incorporated as Belgorod Urban Okrug.

For administrative purposes, Belgorod is divided into two city okrugs:
*Vostochny (&quot;Eastern&quot;), population: 141,844 (2010 Census)
*Zapadny (&quot;Western&quot;), population: 214,558 (2010 Census)

==Transportation==
There has been a railway connection between Belgorod and Moscow since 1869. The city is served by Belgorod International Airport (EGO) in the north of the city.

There are two bus stations: Bus Belgorod, Belgorod- 2 Bus Terminal (located on the forecourt), and the bus stop complex Energomash. The Energomash bus station is mainly for commuter buses. Buses run from the Belgorod-2 station mainly to nearby regional centers, and depart in accordance with the arrival of trains.

Trolleybus services were discontinued on 30 June 2022 and replaced by diesel buses, despite public support for retention of the trolleybus system. The officially cited reason for the closure was inadequate condition of the overhead contact lines and insufficient funds for its modernization. The length of trolley lines was over . Trolleybus city park consisted of 150 pieces of equipment, mainly Russian-made trolley ZiU-682V, 2 units ZiU-683, operated from 1990, and 3 units ZiU-6205, 30 units &quot;Optima&quot;, and one trolley Skoda-VSW -14Tr, which started operation in 1996. The city administration purchased 15 new ZiU-682G trolleybuses in 2002, another 20 new ZiU-682Gs in 2005, 30 Trolza-5275.05 &quot;Optima&quot; trolleybuses in 2011, and 20 new ACSM-420 trolleybuses in 2013.

<text>The history of the Cossacks spans several centuries.

==Early history==

Several theories speculate about the origins of the Cossacks. According to one theory, Cossacks have Slavic origins, while another theory states that the Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk of 1710 attests to Khazar origins. Modern scholars believe that Cossacks have both Slavic and Turkic origins. The Academician Ivan Zabelin mentioned that peoples of the prairies and of the woods had always needed &quot;a live frontier&quot;, and even ancient Borisphenites (Dnieper Scythians) and Tanaites could be the predecessors of the Cossacks, not only the Khazars who may have assimilated, but this also includes the Severians, Goths, Scythians, and other ancient inhabitants, as insisted by Cossack folklore, by the Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk, and by numerous Cossack historians. Because of the need of both the Soviet and the anti-Bolshevik forces to deny any separate Cossack ethnicity, the traditional post-imperial historiography dates the emergence of Cossacks to the 14th-15th centuries. Non-mainstream theories, however, have borrowed the date 948 from imperial historiography, and ascribe an earlier Cossack existence to the tenth century, but deny Cossack links both to &quot;the old people&quot; (Khazars) and to &quot;the new people&quot; (Russians and Ukrainians; the very terms &quot;old people&quot; and &quot;new people&quot; being coined by the 11th-century Metropolitan Ilarion of Kiev), specifically mentioning 948 as the year when the inhabitants of the steppe under a leader named &quot;Kasak&quot; or &quot;Kazak&quot; routed the Khazars in the area of modern Kuban and organized a state called &quot;Kazakia&quot; or &quot;Cossackia&quot;.

Cossacks were mainly East Slavs. In the 15th century, the term originally described semi-independent Tatar groups which lived on the Dnieper River, which flows through Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus.

Some historians suggest that the Cossack people had mixed ethnic origins, descending from Russians, Khazars, Ukrainians, Tatars, and others who settled or passed through the boundless Pontic–Caspian steppeland that stretches from central Asia to southeastern Europe.

Some Turkologists argue that Cumania&#x27;s Cossacks descend from Kipchaks, who partly originated near the northern Chinese borders and soon moved to Western Siberia. Afterwards they migrated further west into the trans-Volga region (present-day western Kazakhstan). In the 11th century they finally arrived in the steppe area north of the Black Sea in southern Russia and eastern Ukraine. They are closely related to modern Kazakhs.

Early Russian military greatly admired Cossacks for their equestrian skills. Many were hired as cavalry by Russian and Ukrainian warlords, in much the same way that they hired Black Klobuks as personal guards.

After 1400, the Cossacks emerge as an established and identifiable group in historical accounts. Rulers of the Grand Duchy of Moscow and of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth employed Cossacks as mobile guards against Tatar raids from the south in the territories of present-day southern Russia and eastern Ukraine. Judging by the records of their names, these early Cossacks seem to have included a significant number of Tatar descendants. From the mid-15th century, Cossacks are mostly mentioned with Slavic names.

All historical records of that period describe Cossack society as a loose federation of independent communities, often merging into larger units of a military character, entirely separate from, and mostly independent of other nations (such as Poland, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, or the Tatars).

In the 16th century, Cossack societies created two relatively independent territorial organisations:

* Zaporizhia, on the lower bends of the river Dnieper in Ukraine, between Russia, Poland, and the Tatars of the Crimea, with their centre as the Zaporozhian Sich
* the Don Cossack State, on the river Don, separated from the Russian state by rebel Nogai and Tatar tribes.

==Don Cossacks==
Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks in Russia as a sovereign ethno-cultural people with a unique warrior culture. Cossacks conducted raids and pillaging against their neighbours as important sources of income. Already in 1444 Cossacks of Ryazan were mentioned as defenders of Pereslavl-Zalessky against the units of Golden Horde and in a letter of Ivan III of Russia in 1502. The area around the Don River was divided between the Crimean west side and the Nogai east side after the Golden Horde fell in 1480. The vast steppe of the Don region was populated by runaway serfs, by those who longed for freedom, by people who were not satisfied with the existing social order. Over time, the culture of the Don Cossacks was formed into a united community and were called &quot;the Cossacks&quot;.

The Don Cossacks known for their attacks on the Ottoman Empire and its vassals (like the Tatars), although they did not shy away from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions exacerbated the tension at the southern border of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (Kresy), resulting in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.
Their first recorded naval raid into the Black Sea dates to 1538, with an attack on the fortress of Ochakiv. This was followed by more frequent and better-organised raids elsewhere, the freeing of Christian slaves being one of the chief aims, as well as the acquisition of plunder. Their success was such that they attracted the attention of the western European powers, including the Papacy, who made diplomatic overtures in the hope of launching joint ventures against the Turks. In 1539, Grand Prince Vasili III of Russia asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: &quot;The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please.&quot; In 1549, the Tsar of Russia, Ivan the Terrible, replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, &quot;The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge.&quot;

==Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth==

Similar exchanges passed between Russia, the Ottomans and the Commonwealth; each of which often tried to use the Cossacks&#x27; warmongering for his own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were happy to plunder everybody more or less equally. Between the 16th to the 17th century, the Zaporoijan Cossacks became subjects first of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and later of the Union of Lublin of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as &quot;chaiky&quot;, they moved swiftly across the Black Sea. According to the Cossacks&#x27; own records, these vessels, carrying a 50- to 70-man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours. The &quot;chaiky&quot; were often accompanied by larger galleys that served as command and control centres. The raids also acquired a distinct political purpose after Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny became &quot;hetman&quot; in 1613, intending to turn the host into the nucleus of a Ukrainian nation with the support of the European states.
By 1618, the Zaporozhians were members of the Anti-Turkish League, as Schaidachny transferred his seat of power to Kiev, the Polish Crown&#x27;s regional capital.

The fighting qualities of the sea-going Cossacks were even admired in the Ottoman chronicles: &quot;One can safely say that in the entire world one cannot find a people more careless for their lives or having less fear of death; persons versed in navigation assert that because of their skill and boldness in naval battles these bands are more dangerous than any other enemy.&quot; 

In 1615, the raiders even sailed to the walls of Tsarhorod, as they referred to the Turkish capital, plundering the ports of Mizevna and Archioca. An attempt by the Turks to blockade the Berezan Island, and deny Cossacks access to the sea, was defeated in the spring of 1616. The raiders went on to capture Kaffa, which was burned down after all the slaves were freed. That same year Trebizond, in eastern Anatolia, was captured and destroyed. Sultan Ahmed I sent his fleet to the Dnieper in pursuit; but instead of going home the Cossacks once more sailed to Constantinople, where they raided at leisure, even rampaging through the Topkapı Palace, according to one account. The city was raided four more times, once in 1620 and no fewer than three times in 1624.

After 1624, the Zaporozhian raids gradually died out, as the Cossacks began to devote more and more of their martial energies to land-based campaigns, fighting on one side and then the other during such conflicts as the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Their numbers expanded with immigration from Poland proper and Lithuania. Szlachta failure to regard Zaporozhian Cossacks as nobles for inclusion in the registry of professional military cossacks eroded the Cossacks&#x27; loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish–Lithuanian) into Three Nations (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a minority view. After the civil war of 1648 (or Rebellion from the Polish viewpoint) the Zaporozhian Host gained control of parts of Ukraine in 1649, although they at various time acknowledged the Polish King over the following decades.

There were several Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the Khmelnytsky Uprising, which together with The Deluge is considered as one of the events that brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising distanced Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the Tsardom of Russia under the Treaty of Pereyaslav (1654), and established their realm as Left-bank Ukraine in 1667 under the Treaty of Andrusovo, and the Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686.

==Ukraine and Tsarist Russia==
After this point, the Cossack nation of the Zaporozhian Host was divided into two semi-autonomous republics within the Russian state: the Hetmanate on the Dnieper&#x27;s left bank, and the more independent Zaporozhia to the south. A Cossack organization was also established in the Russian colony of Sloboda Ukraine.

These organizations gradually lost their independence, and were abolished by Catherine II by the late 18th century. The Hetmanate became the governorship of Little Russia, and Sloboda Ukraine the Kharkiv province. After having its capital, the Sich, similar to Ukrainian capitals Chigirin and Baturyn destroyed and relocated more than once, Zaporozhia was absorbed into New Russia.

The Cossacks that wanted to continue their lifestyle moved either to Ottoman and/or Austrian controlled territories on the Danube or after life on Bug and Dniester to the Kuban region, where they live to this date (see Kuban Cossacks)

==Tsarist Russia and Russian Empire==
&quot;This section derives originally from the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;

In the Russian Empire, the Cossacks constituted 12 separate Cossack voiskos, settled along the frontiers: the Don Cossacks, Kuban Cossacks, Terek Cossacks, Buh Cossacks, Astrakhan Cossacks, Ural Cossacks, Orenburg Cossacks, Siberian Cossacks, Semiryechensk Cossacks, Baikal Cossacks, Amur Cossacks, and Ussuri Cossacks. Also, there was a small number of the Cossacks in Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk, who would form the Yenisey Cossack Host and Irkutsk Cossack regiment of the Ministry of the Interior in 1917. The &quot;stanitsa&quot;, or village formed the primary unit of this organization. Each &quot;stanitsa&quot; held its land as a commune, and might allow non-Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly. This assembly resembled the &quot;mir&quot;, but had wider attributes: it assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (leader) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; gives as &quot;£10&quot; (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).

All Cossack males had to perform military service for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. They spent their first three years in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack had to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms.

Cossacks on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approximately age 18–26) normally performed active service, while the rest effectively functioned as reserves, based at home but bound to march out at short notice. The officers came from the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers&#x27; grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

In 1893, the Cossacks had a total population of 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres (593,000 km2) of land, including 105,000,000 acres (425,000 km2) of arable land and 9,400,000 acres (38,000 km2) under forests. Each &quot;stanitsa&quot; controlled a share of the land, divided up at the rate of 81 acres (328,000 m2) per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, &quot;in lieu&quot; of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands (which they rented to different persons), also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits for gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in 1893), went to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. Village taxes covered the expenditure of the village administration. Each voisko had a separate general administration, and administrative structures differed within the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, comprising representatives of each voisko, discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks.

In time of war, the ten Cossack voiskos had to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of World War I the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take up arms.

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Ussuri Cossacks) sufficed to supply their needs and usually to leave a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in the Caucasus, fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the Caspian Sea, hunting, beekeeping etc. The Cossacks mostly rented out rights to extract coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories to strangers, who also owned most factories.

The Tsarist authorities also introduced a military organization similar to that of the Cossacks into certain non-Cossack districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry sotnias (&quot;hundreds&quot;). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I comprised:
*Daghestan, six regular squadrons and three of militia.
*Kuban Circassians, one sotnia.
*Terek, eight sotnias.
*Kars, three sotnias.
*Batum, two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
*Turkomans, three sotnias.

In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies...

==Russian Revolution==
In the Civil War that followed the Russian Revolution, the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Many officers and experienced Cossacks fought for the White Army, and some of the poorer ones joined the Red Army. Following the defeat of the White Army, a policy of Decossackization (&quot;Raskazachivaniye&quot;) took place on the surviving Cossacks and their homelands since they were viewed as a potential threat to the new regime. This involved dividing their territory amongst other divisions and giving it to new autonomous republics of minorities, and then actively encouraging settlement of these territories with those peoples, but there were also arrests and violent repressions. This policy of resettlement was especially true for the Terek Cossacks land. The Cossack homelands were often very fertile, and during the collectivisation campaign many Cossacks shared the fate of kulaks. The famine of 1933 hit the Don and Kuban territory the hardest. According to Michael Kort, &quot;During 1919 and 1920, out of a population of approximately 3 million, the Bolshevik regime killed or deported an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 Cossacks&quot;, including 45,000 Terek Cossacks.

==World War II==
When the war broke out the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Most fought for the Soviet Union; however, some chose to settle old scores by collaborating with the Germans, especially after the Soviet Union&#x27;s initial series of defeats, including the loss of much of the army of Ivan Kononov, a former Soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of Mogilev, guarding lines of communications against Soviet partisans.

In the summer of 1942, the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. While collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists, but many recruits came from prisoner-of-war camps. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.

During the Battle of Stalingrad, Cossacks attacks, some led by Semyon Budyonny, were able to keep the Germans from entering the Caucausus, where particularly the Terek and the Kuban Cossacks were able to prevent the Germans from taking the mountains. Not only was the region rich in oil, but it was also the key to Iran and Iraq.

From 1943 onward, the Cossacks were kept mostly in the southern part of the front, where their use in reconnaissance and logistics proved invaluable. Many went on through Romania and into the Balkans during the final stages of the war.

Most of the collaborators, who some say numbered over 250,000 (although current figures claim the true number was not even a third of that) were the Don Cossacks, who, formerly the largest and strongest host, suffered the worst under Soviet collectivization policies. Kuban and Terek Cossacks, on the other hand, fought almost exclusively for the Red Army, and even in most desperate situations their heroism was evident. Being the largest Red Army Cossack host, the Kuban Cossacks in 1945 triumphantly marched on Red Square in the famous Victory Parade.

Many of the collaborators fled the Soviet advance (often chased by Soviet Cossacks) but under Soviet-Allied agreements thousands of them were handed back to the USSR. Following the death of Joseph Stalin, large numbers of the repatriated were allowed to return to their native lands, under a promise of secrecy. Only after 1991, with the collapse of the Communist regime in the USSR, could they openly mourn the lost members of their communities.

The division of the Cossacks in both the Russian Civil War and the Second World War continues to be a controversial issue to this day.

==In Russia today==
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in Russia emerged numerous cossack communities all over the country. In Russia, both registered and unregistered communities identify with cossackism. The Cossack communities in Russia cooperate with each other as well as with the Russian Orthodox Church. End of 2018 the Cossacks have set up an All-Russian Cossack Community to coordinate cultural work and strengthen the Cossack roots (such as to introduce the original Cossack costumes again).
During the 2018 FIFA World Cup Cossack groups were incorporated into Russian police forces in order to suppress anti-Putin protests.

==In Ukraine today==
In 21st-century Ukraine, there are hundreds of diverse associations of Cossacks.

The organization &quot;The Ukrainian Registered Cossacks&quot; (URC) was established on March 29, 2002 by the decision of the &quot;Grand Rada&quot; of All-Ukrainian public organization &quot;Ukrainian Registered Cossacks&quot; (URC) and was registered in the Ministry of Justice on 8 July 2002.

<text>The Volturno Line (also known as the Viktor Line; , ) was a German defensive position in Italy during the Italian Campaign of World War II.

The line ran from Termoli in the east, along the Biferno River through the Apennine Mountains to the Volturno River in the west.

Following the Allied invasion of Italy in September 1943 the German forces set up a series of defensive lines across Italy, intended to delay the Allied advance. The Volturno Line was the southernmost of these.

==Eighth Army on the River Biferno (Battle of Termoli)==
As a response to the increasing Allied pressure on the Adriatic front, on October 1 the German supreme commander in Italy—&quot;Generalfeldmarshall&quot; Albert Kesselring—ordered the 16th Panzer Division to switch to the Adriatic front. Elements of the British 78th Infantry Division&#x27;s 11th Brigade infantry crossed the Biferno at dawn on 3 October 1943 following an amphibious landing at Termoli by British Commandos at 02:15. By late morning, the two elements had linked up and that night 78th Division&#x27;s 36th Brigade were able to be landed by sea at Termoli. However, logistical problems had prevented the Allies building a heavy duty bridge across the Biferno and when the bulldozed fords were made unusable after 5 tanks had crossed, there was no way to get more tanks across the river to support the infantry. A lighter weight FBE bridge was built to allow artillery, reconnaissance, and other vehicles to cross. The move east of 16th Panzer Division presented a major and unforeseen threat to the unsupported Allied infantry. As news of the German armour&#x27;s arrival came in on 4 October, 78th Division&#x27;s commander— Major-General Vyvyan Evelegh—demanded priority from British Eighth Army, under General Bernard Montgomery, for bridging equipment. As more German armour arrived, the Allied troops across the Biferno were forced onto the defensive. By the afternoon of 5 October, they had been squeezed back to within of Termoli. However, at the same time frantic round the clock efforts by engineers had resulted in a heavyweight Bailey bridge being completed, allowing Canadian and British armour to cross the Biferno. That evening, 78th Division&#x27;s 38th (Irish) Brigade arrived by sea at Termoli and the German attack the following morning was narrowly repulsed in desperate fighting. By late morning on 6 October, the Allies were on the attack and by late afternoon the Germans had started to fall back to the next prepared defences on the River Trigno, the Barbara Line.

==Fifth Army on the River Volturno==

On the other coast, the U.S. Fifth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, attacked across the Volturno on the night of 12 October. The Germans, using rearguard tactics, succeeded in slowing the American advance. They skillfully utilized the terrain, which was favourable for defence, to conduct a fighting withdrawal to the next line north (the Barbara Line) which the Allies reached by 2 November.

<text>Baddeck () is a village on Cape Breton Island in northeastern Nova Scotia, Canada. It is situated in the center of Cape Breton, approximately 6 km east of where the Baddeck River empties into Bras d&#x27;Or Lake.

Baddeck is the shire-town of the Municipality of Victoria County, with an elected village commission having limited authority over water, sewer, side streets and some bylaws. The population was 816 in the 2021 Census of Population.

The area was first occupied by Mi&#x27;kmaq people and later settled by United Empire Loyalists and Scottish Gaels in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The area prospered in the 19th and early 20th centuries as a service and shipping center for surrounding mining, trapping, fishing, forestry, and farming actvities. Today the economy depends on services, cultural activities, and tourism.

==Toponymy==
Baddeck is a Mi&#x27;kmaq language place name. The French called it La Bedeque, while Canadian Gaelic speakers called it Badaig. Its original name, &quot;Apatakwitk,&quot; has been variously reported as meaning &quot;reversing flow&quot;, &quot;place with island near&quot; (a likely reference to Kidston Island), &quot;a portion of food set aside for someone&quot;, or &quot;a sultry place&quot;.

==History==

French Jesuits settled at nearby St. Anns in 1629. British settlement came during the 1700s after the territory was ceded by France.

In 1839, a property containing an inn, a tavern, and a post office was built. In 1841, Charles James Campbell opened a store, began a shipbuilding operation, and developed coal mining in the nearby area of Cape Dauphin approximately 35 kilometers away.

In 1851 Victoria County was created from an area split off of Cape Breton County. Baddeck became the shire-town or county seat of the newly formed county: with a jail, court house and municipal offices. 

Baddeck rose to fame in 1874, with the publication of the travel memoir &quot;Baddeck, And That Sort of Thing.&quot;

In 1885 the Alexander Graham Bell family had a vacation in Baddeck. He then built a complex of buildings, including a new laboratory, named Beinn Bhreagh (Gaelic: &quot;beautiful mountain&quot;) after Bell&#x27;s ancestral Scottish highlands. Initially a summer residence, Bell spent an increasing part of the year there, and conducted many experiments, including the AEA Silver Dart&#x27;s first controlled powered flight in Canada in 1909. From 1885 to 1928 the estate included the Bell Boatyard which made both experimental and traditional boats. The yard was notable for its dual focus on both experimental and traditional boats and for its employment of large numbers of female boatbuilders.

Bell is commemorated at the Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site.

==Geography==
The area sits on rocks from the Carboniferous Windsor Group. These include rock salt, limestone, potash, and gypsum, which are easily dissolved by groundwater and creates caves and sinkholes.

=== Climate ===
Baddeck experiences a humid continental climate (Dfb). The highest temperature ever recorded in Baddeck was on 22 August 1935. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 11 February 1883.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Baddeck had a population of 818 living in 368 of its 415 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 826. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Attractions ==
Baddeck is one of several Cape Breton communities that plays host to the Celtic Colours festival each fall. The music festival features hundreds of Celtic musicians from Cape Breton and around the world.

In the spring, the village hosts the Cabot Trail Relay Race, a 298 km (185-mile) relay race around the Cabot Trail.

The Cabot Trail, a scenic route, passes through Baddeck.

<text>The Mad Dash is a television game show created by Sidney M. Cohen (who hosted the pilot episode) which first appeared in 1978 on Canada&#x27;s CTV network and ran until 1981. The series proved to be a family favourite based on Canada&#x27;s BBM ratings, and was also popular in parts of the northern United States, where CTV affiliates were available to Americans living near the Canada–United States border, both over the air and via cable. Pierre Lalonde was the MC, and Nick Hollinrake was the announcer for the show, which was taped at the studios of CFCF-TV in Montreal. This classic series is included in the collection of Canadian icons in the 2006 feature film &quot;Souvenir of Canada&quot; based on the book by Douglas Coupland. The series was later rerun on GameTV in Canada, from 2007 to 2010.

Only a handful of episodes still exist, due to the then common practice known as wiping. Several of these episodes, including the pilot (hosted by series creator Sidney Cohen) and the premiere episode, have been posted to YouTube.

==Gameplay==
Two pairs of contestants (always composed of a man and a woman), one pair being returning champions, competed in a giant board game, laid out as a winding path across the studio floor. Each team chose one member to be the &quot;Dasher,&quot; moving on the board, and one as the &quot;Roller,&quot; answering questions at the host&#x27;s podium. Both Dashers began on the Start space at one end of the board, with the matchups always being man against woman.

The host asked a series of multiple-choice toss-up questions to the Rollers, and the first to buzz-in with the correct answer rolled an oversized six-sided die. A miss gave the opponent a chance to answer and steal the roll. Five of the die&#x27;s faces were marked with pips to indicate numbers from 1 to 5, while the sixth face showed a dollar sign. If a number came up, the team&#x27;s Dasher moved ahead that many spaces. The dollar sign added $10 to the team&#x27;s bank and gave a free roll; if three consecutive dollar signs came up, the team was credited with $50 for the third dollar sign.

In order to win, a Dasher had to reach the Win space at the end of the path by exact count. If the Roller rolled a number higher than the number of spaces needed to reach Win, the Dasher had to use the excess spaces to back up from Win. (E.g. if the Dasher was one space away from Win, a roll of 3 would leave him/her two spaces away.) When a Dasher reached Win, that team kept all cash and prizes they had banked during the game. If they had banked nothing, the Roller rolled the die once and received either $100 for a dollar sign, or $10 times the number rolled.

Teams remained on the show until they lost twice. For every seven games a team won, they were rewarded with the Lucky 7 jackpot, which consisted of $250 cash and an array of merchandise.

==Spaces==

Spaces on the board awarded cash or prizes, or affected the movement or gameplay in various ways. Some spaces remained constant, while others changed from one game to the next. Spaces took immediate effect, regardless of whether a Dasher landed on them while moving forward or backward.

===Colour designations===
The effects of landing on various spaces were differentiated by their colour as follows.

*Blue − Added the prize displayed on the space to the team&#x27;s bank. If a team landed on a space for a prize they had already banked, they were given a free roll. Both teams could bank the same prize.
*Green − Banked the displayed amount of money, from $50 to $250. One green space would double the team&#x27;s entire cash total. 
*Red − A negative effect, such as moving backward or losing cash/prizes.
*Yellow − Other effects, such as moving forward.

In some episodes, orange spaces were used either in place of red and yellow ones, or in addition to them. These spaces affected the gameplay in special ways, such as by requiring the Dashers to trade places.

===Common spaces===
*Roll Forward / Roll Back – Roller rolls again and Dasher moves forward or backward, respectively.
*Roll Over – Roller rolls again and opposing Dasher moves forward.
*Free Roll / Miss Turn – An extra roll for the team or their opponents, respectively.
*Change Places – The Dashers switch places, and the one who had originally landed on &quot;Change Places&quot; receives the effect of the space on which he/she lands.
*Back to Start – Dasher returns to Start.
*Dash – The Dasher is asked a true/false question, and the Roller rolls the die. A correct answer moves the Dasher forward, but a miss moves him/her back.
*Breakaway – Added in season 2; the Roller rolls the die, and the Dasher is given that many seconds (from 1 to 5) to run ahead on the board. Two bells are rung, one to start the Breakaway and the other when time expires; once the second bell rings, the space the Dasher was touching when the bell rang becomes their position. If the Dasher makes it to the Win space before time expires, that team wins the game.
*Dice Game – The Roller rolls two dice. If both show dollar signs, the team wins $100 and another roll. Otherwise, the Dasher moves ahead according to the total.
*Card Game – The Roller draws one playing card from an oversized deck. If a number card is drawn, the Dasher moves ahead that many spaces; an ace counts for one space. However, if a face card (king, queen, jack) is drawn, the Roller rolls the die and the Dasher moves back that many spaces. 
*Happy Birthday – The Dasher spins two concentric wheels. The outer wheel has six sections, showing five different cash amounts and an insurance policy; the inner wheel has 12 sections, one for each month of the year. If the outer wheel lands on a cash amount, the team banks the cash, or double the value if the inner wheel lands on the Dasher&#x27;s birth month. However, if the outer wheel stops on the insurance policy, the team receives one to protect against losing their bank.
*Go Broke / Return Prizes – The team forfeits their entire cash total, or only their banked prizes, respectively. An insurance policy can be used once to negate either penalty. Cash and prizes won in previous games are not affected.
*Pot of Gold – A collection of prizes that the team keeps regardless of the outcome of the game.
*Shooting Star - The Dasher throws a maximum of three Velcro-covered balls at a game board with several star-shaped prize and cash spaces. The team wins the first prize or cash amount hit by any of the Dasher&#x27;s throws. One space is marked &quot;Lose Loss,&quot; and will erase a team&#x27;s first loss (if any) from their record if claimed.
*Thin Ice – The Dasher is asked a true/false question. A correct answer allows the team to steal one prize from the opponents&#x27; bank, while a miss allows the opponents to steal one instead; if there are no prizes to steal, the team is allowed to steal up to $50 cash from the opponents&#x27; bank if they have any. Otherwise, the team is given a chance to advance forward up to five squares by buying spaces at the cost of $10 per square advanced. 
*Mini-game – The space is marked with the name of a mini-game which the Dasher must play. Position and/or prizes may be affected by the outcome.
*Brains or Brawn – The Dasher must choose to answer a question or attempt a physical stunt, and the Roller rolls the die. Success allows the Dasher to move forward, but failure requires him/her to move back.

==Mini Dash==
If a game ended without leaving enough time at the end of the episode to start a new one, one or more audience members were called to the stage, one at a time, to play a Mini Dash. Each member played for a different prize. Originally, they would simply have to answer two out of three questions to win the prize. Later in the run, they chose one of five envelopes, three of which had three questions (still requiring two correct answers to win), while the other two hid an &quot;instant win&quot; and &quot;instant loss&quot;, respectively.

==Other versions==
&quot;The Mad Dash&quot; has also been produced internationally. The most successful foreign version of the format was &quot;Duety do mety&quot; (literally translating to &quot;Duos to the finish line&quot;) created for Polish public broadcaster, TVP2, and aired from 1998 to 2000.

<doc id="478884" wikidata="Q888629" url="?curid=478884" title="Bobby Molloy">
<text>Robert Molloy (9 July 1936 – 2 October 2016) was an Irish politician who served as Minister of State for Housing and Urban Renewal and Minister of State to the Government from 1997 to 2002, Minister for Energy from 1989 to 1992, Minister for Defence from 1977 to 1979, Minister for Local Government from 1970 to 1973, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education from 1969 to 1970 and Mayor of Galway from 1968 to 1969. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Galway West constituency from 1965 to 2002.

==Early life==
Molloy was born in Galway on July 6th, 1936. His father, Michael Edward Molloy, was originally from Ballyhaunis, County Mayo, and ran a successful wholesale drapery business in the city. His mother, Rita Stanley, hailed from Clifden, County Galway. Molloy was educated at Coláiste Iognáid and University College Galway. Before entering politics, Molloy worked for several years in printing, the clothing industry and his family&#x27;s drapery firm.

==Political career==
===Fianna Fáil===
Molloy was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil TD for the Galway West constituency at the 1965 general election. In 1968, he was also elected Mayor of Galway. The following year he was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education. 

Molloy&#x27;s early political career was marked by his loyalty to Fianna Fáil’s leadership under Taoiseach Jack Lynch. He quickly rose through the ranks and was appointed Minister for Local Government in 1970, a position he held until 1973. His tenure as Minister for Local Government was characterised by his efforts to modernise and streamline local government structures in Ireland. Molloy’s tenure in Fianna Fáil saw him as a stalwart of the party’s establishment, though tensions with its leadership grew over the years, particularly with Charlie Haughey.

In opposition from 1973, Molloy served as the frontbench spokesman, where he became involved in a high-profile dispute with Jim Tully, the Labour Minister for Local Government, over the controversial redrawing of constituencies, known as the &quot;Tullymander&quot;. Molloy, along with fellow Fianna Fáil member Brendan Crinion, used Dáil privilege to accuse Tully of having an improper commercial relationship with a builder in County Meath. The accusation was strongly denied by Tully and Molloy and Crinion later withdrew the charge. Despite this, Molloy faced severe repercussions, being forced to resign from his frontbench position. He was subsequently condemned by a judicial tribunal and censured by the Dáil for abusing parliamentary privilege.

When Fianna Fáil returned to office in 1977, he became Minister for Defence in the final government of Jack Lynch.

Molloy supported George Colley in the 1979 Fianna Fáil leadership election. Charles Haughey won the contest and dropped Molloy, alongside other opponents, from the cabinet. Thereafter Molloy became a member of the Gang of 22 who opposed Haughey&#x27;s leadership of the party. 

===Progressive Democrats===
In 1986 Molloy resigned from Fianna Fáil and joined the newly formed Progressive Democrats, spearheaded by Haughey&#x27;s arch-rival Desmond O&#x27;Malley. Molloy&#x27;s move was seen as a major break from the political establishment, as the PDs advocated for low-tax, market-oriented economic policies and a more liberal economic agenda. Molloy’s decision was driven by his dissatisfaction with the direction of Fianna Fáil under Haughey’s leadership and his belief that the party had become increasingly alienating. 

In 1989, Molloy contested the European Parliament elections but was unsuccessful in his attempt. Following the 1989 Irish general election Molloy, along with newly elected MEP for Munster Pat Cox, represented the Progressive Democrats in the lengthy negotiations with Fianna Fáil to form a coalition government. Once the negotiations concluded, Molloy was reinstated in the Cabinet as Minister for Energy under Taoiseach Charles Haughey, who had previously caused Molloy’s political humiliation a decade earlier. Over the following three years, Molloy and his Progressive Democrat colleague Desmond O&#x27;Malley had a working relationship with their former Fianna Fáil colleagues, though tensions grew due to resentment over their presence in the Cabinet. The issue came to a head when Molloy and O&#x27;Malley made it clear they would not serve in a Cabinet that included Brian Lenihan Snr, following his controversial remarks during the 1990 Irish presidential election about alleged phone calls to President Patrick Hillery from 1982.

In January 1992, Haughey faced further complications when Seán Doherty revealed information about the phone tapping of journalists dating back to 1982. Despite this, the coalition government ended when Albert Reynolds, Haughey’s successor, called for a general election after accusing O&#x27;Malley of giving &quot;dishonest&quot; evidence to the Beef Tribunal. Molloy strongly denounced Reynolds’ accusation, describing it as &quot;outrageous,&quot; and criticised him for what he perceived as a &quot;lack of generosity&quot; in recent North-South negotiations, in which Molloy had represented the Progressive Democrats in talks with British Unionists.

Molloy stood at the European Parliament elections again in 1994 but was again unsuccessful.

Following the 1997 general election, Molloy was part of the negotiations that led to the formation of a coalition government between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil. On that occasion, he was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government and sat at cabinet as Minister of State to the Government. 

====Resignation and retirement====
Molloy resigned as a minister and quit politics just before the 2002 Irish general election amid controversy surrounding his involvement in the rape case of Barbara Naughton. The controversy stemmed from a letter Molloy had sent to then Minister for Justice, John O&#x27;Donoghue, on behalf of a constituent whose relative had been convicted of rape. The letter, which requested the temporary release of the individual pending an appeal, led to public criticism. The case was high-profile, involving a Connemara man sentenced to eleven years for the systematic abuse of his young daughter. During the trial, the judge, Philip O’Sullivan, noted that someone acting on Molloy’s behalf had tried to contact him in his chambers to clarify whether he had received certain correspondence from the victim’s sister, which the judge described as “quite improper.” In response to the backlash, Molloy resigned, describing the letter as a &quot;human error of judgment,&quot; but insisting it was not intended to be dishonest. He retired from politics after the election.

==Political views==
Molloy was a member of Fianna Fáil for over 20 years, but his views were not always in line with the mainstream of the party, particularly under the leadership of Charles Haughey. His decision to leave Fianna Fáil in 1986 and join the Progressive Democrats was motivated by ideological differences, notably the party&#x27;s move towards a more conservative, state-controlled economy. Molloy, on the other hand, embraced a platform of fiscal conservatism, with an emphasis on reducing taxes, deregulation, and the liberalisation of the economy.

In terms of social issues, Molloy was ahead of his time in advocating for progressive policies, particularly on women’s rights. In a survey conducted in 1976 by the Women&#x27;s Political Association (WPA), Molloy scored among the highest of any member of the Dáil for his progressive stance on issues affecting women. He supported measures such as divorce, contraception, and family law reform, which were seen as highly controversial at the time. His responses to the WPA&#x27;s questions revealed that he held views that were in stark contrast to many of his colleagues within Fianna Fáil. Molloy’s progressive views on women’s rights were notable, as he was the only member of Jack Lynch’s cabinet who consistently supported reformist policies on issues like family law and the role of women in public life.

==Personal life==
In 1972, Molloy married Phyllis Barry, a Montessori teacher from Foxrock, County Dublin, whose father was a cousin of the executed revolutionary Kevin Barry. The couple met while campaigning in a by-election in mid-Cork. Together, they had four children: Sinead, Sorcha, Donnacha, and Dara.

<doc id="478888" wikidata="Q1510184" url="?curid=478888" title="Gerard Sweetman">
<text>Hugh Gerard Sweetman (20 June 1908 – 28 January 1970) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as Minister for Finance from 1954 to 1957. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Kildare constituency from 1948 to 1970. He was a Senator for the Agricultural Panel from 1943 to 1948.

==Family and childhood==
Hugh Gerard Sweetman was born on 20 June 1908. His father, James Sweetman, was a practising barrister, and the family&#x27;s return for the 1911 census shows that they employed three servants at their Lower Baggot Street home. His mother Agnes was the daughter of Sir George Fottrell of North Great George&#x27;s Street, Dublin. His brothers, Séamus, George, and Denis, served in the World War II; Denis was killed on 23 May 1940 at Boulogne and Séamus was awarded an MBE in 1945.

James&#x27; brother, Roger Sweetman, was elected to the First Dáil representing Wexford North and was one of the first TDs to publicly call for a negotiated settlement to the Irish War of Independence.

He was educated at the Downside School in England. He completed his studies at Trinity College Dublin and went on to qualify as a solicitor in 1930.

==Early political career==
Sweetman&#x27;s first brush with politics came with his involvement with the Blueshirts: He was a member of the League of Youth, one of their youth wings, and was elected to Blueshirt&#x27;s national council in August 1935. As the Blueshirts dissipated, Sweetman folded into the newly formed Fine Gael. Three weeks after his 29th birthday, Sweetman contested the 1937 general election. His target was the four-seater Carlow–Kildare constituency. Out of a field of 7 candidates, Sweetman came in sixth with 8.5% of the vote.

He did not contest the 1938 general election but ran again in 1943, and once again failed to secure election. He secured a Seanad seat in weeks that followed, and remained in the upper house through the 1944 election, until finally, with the creation of a separate Kildare constituency, he won a Dáil seat at the 1948 general election.

The 1948 general election returned the first inter-party government under Taoiseach John A. Costello. This coalition represented an &#x27;anybody-but-Fianna-Fáil&#x27; gathering from across the political spectrum, and the newest Kildare TD sat on the backbenches until the government fell in 1951.

A second inter-party government took office in June 1954 with Sweetman promoted to Minister for Finance.

In Professor Tom Garvin&#x27;s review of the 1950s &#x27;News from a New Republic&#x27;, he comes in for praise as a moderniser and Garvin places him with a cross-party group including Daniel Morrissey of Fine Gael and William Norton of the Labour Party as well as Seán Lemass of Fianna Fáil who were pushing a modernising agenda

Sweetman also served as a member of Kildare County Council, including a term as chairman of the Council in the late 1940s.

==Ministerial career==
At the age of 45 years old, Sweetman inherited a national economy that was in crisis. Unemployment was at 421,000; over 100,000 people had left agriculture during the previous 8 years; the country was seeing a level of emigration unknown since the famine.

Sweetman differed in his thinking from the protectionist policies espoused by Éamon de Valera since the 1930s. Rather than focusing on a self-sufficient Ireland, Sweetman enacted policies that would make Ireland a net exporter.

In his first budget in 1955, he introduced a scheme whereby a tax exemption was provided for exported goods. He also established the Prize Bonds programme as a means of reducing the national debt. This debt was worrying in the mid-1950s. Two major bond issues were placed during Sweetman&#x27;s tenure, for £20 million and £12 million. These were large sums at a time when an average worker entered the tax net with an annual salary of just £533.

On 30 May 1956, Sweetman&#x27;s greatest initiative as minister was the appointment of a 39-year-old civil servant named Ken Whitaker to the position of Secretary-General of the Department of Finance. This was a revolutionary step, as it did not follow the convention of promotion based on time served. Whitaker&#x27;s time at the department has been seen as instrumental in the economic development of the country, and a 2001 RTÉ contest named him &#x27;Irishman of the 20th Century&#x27;. Whitaker continued in office under the Fianna Fáil government elected in 1957, and his seminal &quot;First Programme for Economic Expansion&quot; published in 1958 laid the foundations for economic growth in the 1960s.

==Later career==
For Sweetman, this brief period of government would not be repeated, as he would remain in opposition for the rest of his life. Upon the retirement of Richard Mulcahy as leader of Fine Gael, Sweetman played a significant role in James Dillon&#x27;s campaign to become the party&#x27;s latest leader, fending off both John A. Costello and Liam Cosgrave, opposing the former due to his failure to commit to the role full-time and the latter due to antagonism between the two while in government.

During the 1960s, Fine Gael itself witnessed a major transformation. This internal revolution culminated in the &#x27;Just Society&#x27; document produced by Declan Costello. The distinctly social democrat flavour of the document was very much at odds with Sweetman&#x27;s deeply conservative views. However, the support of Liam Cosgrave and Garret FitzGerald ensured that the document was adopted as the party&#x27;s manifesto for the 1965 general election, with Sweetman, Dillon and the rest of the conservative wing capitulating after realising they were outnumbered. Nevertheless, he succeeded in having most of the policy gutted prior to the election. 

Following Dillon&#x27;s retirement as leader after his defeat in the 1965 Irish general election, Sweetman aided his former rival, Liam Cosgrave, in becoming Fine Gael&#x27;s new leader to prevent Declan Costello from becoming a credible challenger. However, the favour was not repaid, with Cosgrave removing Sweetman as Fine Gael&#x27;s spokesperson on Finance, moving him to Agriculture, having been dissuaded from removing him from the front bench entirely by Dillon and Tom O&#x27;Higgins.

While both O&#x27;Higgins and FitzGerald exercised considerable influence on the new leader, Sweetman became the dominant influence on Cosgrave following the former&#x27;s excellent performance as director of elections during the 1966 Irish presidential election. This influence led to Sweetman successfully convincing Cosgrave to oppose proportional representation during the 1968 Irish constitutional referendums, which put him at odds with the rest of his party who successfully campaigned against the amendment, severely damaging his credibility.

In his last election, in June 1969, Sweetman was again returned to the Dáil for a seventh successive term. The election left only a handful of seats between Fianna Fáil and the opposition. However, Sweetman was far from pleased with this result, looking to replace Cosgrave with a new leader. According to Magill, his plan was to install Tom Fitzpatrick, a moderate figure acceptable to both Fine Gael&#x27;s liberal and conservative wings, as an interim leader, until Sweetman&#x27;s preferred candidate, John Kelly was elected to the Dáil.

==Death==
Sweetman was known for his high-speed style of driving. On 28 January 1970, while returning from a business meeting on the continent, he had travelled down to Silvermines in County Tipperary for another business meeting, and it was on the return journey that he lost control of his vehicle near Monasterevin, County Kildare and died.

Speaking at the first session of the Dáil that followed, Taoiseach Jack Lynch offered a sincere and moving tribute to the late Deputy. He spoke of a TD who &quot;commanded respect and attention&quot;, especially in matters of finance; a &quot;gifted parliamentarian who loved the cut-and-thrust of debate&quot; and who was as &quot;fair an opponent as he was formidable&quot;. He noted a career cut short: &quot;Through his tragic and untimely death, Dáil Éireann and Irish public life have suffered a grievous loss. That loss will be felt all the more because of his great impact on, and contribution to, Irish political life&quot;.
