<text>Americo Peter &quot;Rico&quot; Petrocelli (born June 27, 1943) is an American former professional baseball player and minor league manager. He played his entire Major League Baseball (MLB) career as a shortstop and third baseman for the Boston Red Sox, where he established himself as a fan favorite for his powerful hitting and his solid defensive play. A two-time All-Star shortstop, Petrocelli appeared in two World Series with the Red Sox (, ). He was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 1997.

==Early life==
Petrocelli was born to Italian immigrant parents in Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York City. His father was a garment worker in Manhattan. He was the youngest of seven children. He graduated from Sheepshead Bay High School in 1961.

==Playing career==
Petrocelli was signed by the Boston Red Sox as an amateur free agent in July 1961.

===Minor leagues===
Petrocelli spent the 1962 season with Boston&#x27;s Class B farm team, the Winston-Salem Red Sox, batting .277 with 17 home runs and 80 RBIs in 137 games played. In 1963, he played for the Double-A Reading Red Sox, again playing 137 games, with 19 home runs and 78 RBIs with a .239 average.

Petrocelli was a September call-up with Boston in 1963, playing a single MLB game, on September 21 against the Minnesota Twins. He was the starting shortstop and was 1-for-4 at the plate, with his first major league hit being a double off of Lee Stange. In 1964, Petrocelli played 134 games for the Triple-A Seattle Rainiers, batting .231 with 10 home runs and 48 RBIs.

===Boston Red Sox===
Petrocelli spent all of the 1965 season with Boston, playing in 103 games and making 93 starts at shortstop. Early in his rookie campaign, he experimented with switch hitting, but after batting only .174 with no home runs through 20 games, he returned to his exclusively right-handed stroke on June 6. For the season, he batted .232 with 13 home runs and 33 RBIs. In 1966, Petrocelli batted .238 with 18 home runs and 59 RBIs in 139 games played.

In 1967, Boston&#x27;s &quot;Impossible Dream&quot; year, Petrocelli was selected to the All-Star game; he was the starting shortstop for the American League team, and went hitless in his one at bat. Petrocelli played in 142 regular season games, with 17 home runs, 66 RBIs, and a .259 average. In the 1967 World Series, he started all seven games, batting 4-for-20 (.200) with two home runs and three RBIs. Both of his home runs came in Game 6, off of Dick Hughes of the St. Louis Cardinals. Boston ultimately lost the series, four games to three.

In 1968, Petrocelli played 123 games while batting .234 with 12 home runs and 46 RBIs. In 1969, he set a record (since broken) for home runs by a shortstop with 40; he had 97 RBIs and a career-high .297 average while playing 154 games. He also played in his second All-Star game, starting at shortstop for the American League squad and going 1-for-3 at the plate, with a double off of Jerry Koosman. Petrocelli led American League shortstops in fielding percentage in both 1968 and 1969, at .978 and .981, respectively.

Petrocelli hit 29 home runs and had a career-high 103 RBIs in 1970, while batting .261 in 157 games. In 1971, the Red Sox acquired shortstop Luis Aparicio and Petrocelli moved to third base. He led American League third basemen in fielding percentage (.976), making only 11 errors in 463 total chances. He batted .251 in a career-high 158 games, with 28 home runs and 89 RBIs.
In 1972, Petrocelli batted .240 with 15 home runs and 75 RBIs, while playing in 147 games. In 1973, Petrocelli did not play after August 11 due to a calcium deposit in his right elbow, which required surgery. For the season, he appeared in 100 games, batting .244 with 13 home runs and 45 RBIs. He returned in 1974 to play 129 games with 15 home runs, 76 RBIs, and a .267 average. He did not play after September 15, when he was hit in the head by a pitch from Jim Slaton of the Milwaukee Brewers.

During the 1975 regular season, Petrocelli batted .239 in 115 games, with seven home runs and 59 RBIs. He missed the second half of August due to an inner ear problem, likely related to his 1974 beaning. Boston won the American League East, and faced the Oakland Athletics in the American League Championship Series. Petrocelli started all three games at third base, as the Red Sox swept the A&#x27;s, while batting 2-for-12 (.167) with a home run and two RBIs. In the 1975 World Series, which Boston lost to the Cincinnati Reds, Petrocelli hit .308 (8-for-26) with four RBIs, starting all seven games at third base. He did not commit an error during the 1975 postseason.

In 1976, Petrocelli was placed on the disabled list on August 20, due to further inner ear problems; he played in only three more games that year. For the season, he batted a career-low .213 with three home runs and 24 RBIs in 85 games played. Supplanted by Butch Hobson as the team&#x27;s regular third baseman, Petrocelli was released by the Red Sox during spring training on March 26, 1977.

During his career with the Red Sox, Petrocelli hit 210 home runs with 773 RBIs and 653 runs scored in 1553 games played, with a .251 average. As of 2018, Petrocelli holds MLB&#x27;s eighth-best all-time fielding percentage for third basemen (.970). He was inducted to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 1997.

==Post-playing career==
Following his playing career, Petrocelli worked in broadcasting and was a minor league manager. He later wrote a book about the 1967 Boston Red Sox season, &quot;Rico Petrocelli&#x27;s Tales from the Impossible Dream Red Sox&quot;.

===Broadcasting===
For the 1979 Boston Red Sox season, Petrocelli was color commentator for local radio broadcasts on WITS-AM 1510, working with Ken Coleman. In 1980, he began hosting the game show &quot;Candlepins for Cash&quot; on WXNE-TV, Channel 25 in Boston; he hosted the show through 1982. Also on April 17, 1980, Petrocelli teamed with Jim Woods to call a game between the Kansas City Royals and Baltimore Orioles for the USA Network.

===Managing===
Petrocelli managed within the farm systems of the Chicago White Sox and the Boston Red Sox.
Notes:
* In 1986, Petrocelli took over as manager of the Appleton Foxes in June.
* The 1987 Birmingham Barons, despite their overall losing record, won the Southern League playoffs.
* The 1992 Pawtucket Red Sox lost in the first round of the International League playoffs.

=== Political activity ===
Petrocelli endorsed Republican Karoline Leavitt, a candidate for New Hampshire&#x27;s 1st congressional district, in the 2022 election. In 2023, Petrocelli announced his support for former U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte in the 2024 New Hampshire gubernatorial election, describing her as &quot;the tough conservative we need in Concord&quot;.

<doc id="478401" wikidata="Q376068" url="?curid=478401" title="Yell, Shetland">
<text>Yell is one of the North Isles of Shetland, Scotland. In the 2011 census it had a usually resident population of 966. It is the second largest island in Shetland after the Mainland with an area of , and is the third most populous in the archipelago (fifteenth out of the islands in Scotland), after the Mainland and Whalsay.

The island&#x27;s bedrock is largely composed of Moine schist with a north–south grain, which was uplifted during the Caledonian mountain building period. Peat covers two-thirds of the island to an average depth of .

Yell has been inhabited since the Neolithic times, and a dozen broch sites have been identified from the pre-Norse period. Norse rule lasted from the 9th to 14th centuries until Scottish control was asserted. The modern economy of the island is based on crofting, fishing, transport and tourism. The island claims to be the &quot;Otter Capital of Britain&quot; and has a diverse bird life including breeding populations of great and Arctic skuas. At times, whales and dolphins also appear off the coast.

Notable buildings on the island include the 17th-century Old Haa of Brough in Burravoe, a merchant&#x27;s house now converted to a museum and visitor centre. There are various folk tales and modern literary references to island life.

==Geography==
Yell is in length, with a maximum breadth of , and is swept all around by very impetuous tides. The island extends northward to within of the northwestern extremity of Unst. It is divided by only the narrow Bluemull Sound from the south west of Unst.
On the eastern side the coast is generally low and sandy but there is an extensive rocky and partly precipitous coast on the west that rises slowly to elevations of . It is indented by seven or eight bays forming natural harbours. As Penrith&#x27;s guide to Orkney and Shetland states:

:&quot;The island is roughly rectangular and nearly cut in two where the long voes of Whale Firth and Mid Yell almost meet.&quot;

In addition to these large indentations, there are a number of tombolos connecting peninsulas to the island. Many of these are very fragile, and can be damaged extremely easily by human erosion, or severe storms, creating new islands - or resurrecting old ones.

There is comparatively little farmland, but the coast is conducive to fishing. Much of the interior of Yell is covered in a peat blanket, often as much as thick, which is the result of 3,000 years of deposits. The peat retains a great deal of water, but is easily eroded, particularly when it comes near to the coast. As Jill Slee Blackadder writes:

:&quot;Some streams carve deep sided gorges. Among these habitats, you can find a wealth of wild flowers and birds nest here in peace.&quot;

The island was anciently divided into the parishes of North Yell, Mid Yell, and South Yell. More recently the parish of North Yell was merged with that of Fetlar, and Mid Yell and South Yell were amalgamated. In 1991, North Yell was merged with Mid and South Yell to the new civil parish of Yell, leaving Fetlar a parish of its own. The island is still divided into the ecclesiastical parish Mid Yell and the &quot;quoad sacra&quot; parishes North Yell and South Yell.

As with the Shetland archipelago as a whole, the island can be seen as creating a barrier between the northern end of the North Sea (to the east) and the North Atlantic (to the west). To the north east is the Norwegian Sea, and the Arctic Ocean is several hundred km to the north.

Attractions on the island include the Sands of Breckon composed of crushed shells, and the Daal of Lumbister gorge.

===Settlements===
Settlements on Yell tend to be coastal and include Burravoe, home to the Old Haa Museum, Mid Yell, Cullivoe and Gloup, as well as Ulsta, Gutcher, Aywick, West Yell, Sellafirth, Copister, Camb, Otterswick, and West Sandwick.

There is little in the way of modern settlements on the west coast other than West Sandwick, mainly because of the prevailing wind and the high cliffs that border much of it. There are a few crofts along Whale Firth, including Windhouse (see notable buildings), and at Grimister there are the ruins of an old herring curing station, which closed just after World War II.

===Surrounding islands===

The following islands surround Yell: Aastack, Bigga, Black Skerry, Brother Isle, Brough, Burravoe Chest, Fish Holm, Gloup Holm, Gold Skerry, Green Holm, Grey Stack, Hascosay, Holm of West Sandwick, Horns of the Roe, Kay Holm, Linga, Muckle Holm, Neapback Skerries, Orfasay, Outsta Ness, Rug, Skerry Wick, Stacks of Stuis, Sweinna Stack, The Clapper, The Quidin, Whalegeo Stacks, Whilkie Stack, and Ern Stack.

==Geology and soils==
Yell lies to the east of the Walls boundary fault, which is probably a northern extension of the Great Glen fault. There are three main faults that dictate the geography of Yell - the first is the Bluemull Fault, which separates Yell from Unst by creating the Bluemull Sound; the second is the Arisdale Fault which forms the northern part of Whale Firth, and extends south to Arisdale, and out of Hamnavoe; and the third is the Nesting Fault, which more or less creates Yell Sound, and divides Yell from Mainland Shetland. A fourth fault helps create Gloup Voe, and there are some other minor ones. These faults may be seen as radiating branches of the Walls Fault, and were exacerbated by glacial activity.

The island&#x27;s bedrock is largely composed of Moine schist with a north–south grain, a metamorphosed sedimentary rock originally laid down in shallow water 1,000-800 million years ago and then uplifted and deformed during the Caledonian orogeny 600–400 million years ago. The principal minerals are coarse quartzite, quartz-feldspar gneiss and mica schist.

In common with the rest of Scotland, Yell was covered in thick ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages. Some of the island&#x27;s gorges, such as the Daal of Lumbister, may have originally been created by ancient meltwater streams escaping from underneath retreating glaciers, and it is also thought some of Yell&#x27;s lochs were originally dammed by moraines.

After the ice melted the island would have experienced a large &quot;tsunami&quot; some 8,000 years BP associated with the Storegga Slides. The inundation would have reached above normal high tides. There is also some evidence at Basta Voe in the north west of a more recent event of a similar nature. In modern times, the non-porous nature of the bedrock, the presence of boulder clay and the cool and damp climate have conspired to create large expanses of peat. This covers two-thirds of the island with an average depth of . Its main constituent materials are sphagnum moss, cotton grass, deer grass, heather and sedge. This peat is highly important to the islanders as a fuel source, and in some areas is even worked commercially. It is cut with a tushker (a type of peat spade, akin to the Highland &quot;cascrom&quot;), and according to Blackadder (2003) &quot;Yell boasts some of the best peat stacking skills in Shetland.&quot;

There is also some dune habitat near West Sandwick, something pretty rare in the Shetland Islands; controversially, there has been some commercial extraction of the sand from this area, which may have had a significant environmental impact.

==History==

===Origin of name===
There are various possible derivations of the island&#x27;s name. The name &quot;Yell&quot;, recorded in the 1300s as &quot;Iala&quot;, may be of Brittonic origin, deriving from &quot;*iala&quot;, meaning &quot;unfruitful land&quot; (c.f. Iâl, Wales; also Yale). The Proto-Norse was &quot;Jala&quot; or &quot;Jela&quot; which may have meant &#x27;white island&#x27; referring to the beaches. The Old Norse was &quot;Gjall&quot; signifying &#x27;barren&#x27;. Neighbouring Unst may also have a pre-Norse name. The name was also recorded in 1586 as &quot;Yella&quot;.

In early modern times, it was written as &quot;Zell&quot; (cf &quot;Zetland&quot;), a mistranscription of &quot;Ȝell&quot;, from an initial yogh. Shetland originates from &quot;Hjaltland&quot;, and the &quot;Ȝ&quot; was used to symbolize the initial sound in the old pronunciation.
This makes another possible explanation plausible, connected to the Norse words &quot;hjalli&quot; or &quot;hjallr&quot;, terrace in a mountainside or a ledge, scaffolding, even the ones used for drying fish. &quot;Hjell&quot; is the current spelling and pronunciation in Norwegian, and &quot;hjallar&quot; is the possessive singular or nominative plural form in Old Norse.

===Early history===
Yell has been inhabited since the Neolithic times. A petrosomatoglyph or stone footprint at North Yell, up Hena, is known locally as the &#x27;Wartie&#x27; and was used to wash in dew or rain-water and standing in it was supposed to get rid of warts. In legend it was made by a giant placing one foot here and the other on the Westing of Unst.

Twelve broch sites are known of and fifteen early chapels. The evidence suggests a substantial population in the Pre-Norse period. One of the brochs is Burra Ness Broch. Only part of the wall remains, on the seaward side. This reaches around high in places. There are traces of earthen ramparts on the landward side, and remains of a structure which may have been a guard&#x27;s cell. There are also remains of an Iron Age blockhouse fort at Burgi Geos. Burravoe&#x27;s name derives partly from a nearby broch - the element &quot;Burra&quot; frequently being a corruption of the Norse for one.

Yell&#x27;s placenames reveal the presence of the Celtic Church, whose hermits were known to the Norse as &quot;papar&quot;. Examples of names related to them include Papil Ness, Loch of Papil and Papil Bay. However, it is unclear whether these names are all pre-Norse, or whether these Christian co-existed with the pagan Norsemen after they invaded. There is evidence of an early Culdee monastery at the Birrier in the west of Yell, near West Sandwick. The Birrier was almost certainly in contact with another monastic settlement directly opposite, across Yell Sound, at the Kame of Isbister on the Northmavine Peninsula of Mainland. A service was held in 2000, at the Birrier to commemorate two millennia of Christianity.

A cross slab from North Yell may also be from this period, but it has since been lost. It is presumed to be like the Bressay Stone.

===Norse era===
Yell Sound is mentioned in the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;: &quot;Earl Rögnvald... and the chiefs Sölmond and Jón with him... had a fine body of troops, though not too numerous, and five or six ships. They arrived at Hjaltland [Shetland] about the middle of summer, but heard nothing of Frákork. Strong and contrary winds sprung up, and they brought their ships to Alasund (Yell Sound), and went a-feasting over the country.&quot;

In the later Norse period Christianity flourished and foundations of 20 chapels dating from this period have been identified.

The primary Norse legacy is an array of placenames of potentially fully or sometimes partial Old Norse origin. For example, &quot;Dalsetter&quot; is a combination of &quot;dalr&quot; meaning a &quot;dale&quot; or &quot;valley&quot;, either from Old Norse or Old English, possibly influenced by both; and &quot;setr&quot; meaning a &quot;hill pasture&quot; or shieling, or as a (potentially Norse) interpretation of Old English (&quot;sǣte&quot;). &quot;Gossawater&quot; is a combination of either Old English &quot;gōs&quot; and/or Old Norse &quot;gás&quot; (goose), &quot;á&quot; (river) and &quot;vatn&quot; (a lake/loch) anglicised as &quot;water&quot;. 

Other potentially Norse elements on Yell include &quot;firth&quot; which is from either or possibly both the Old English &quot;Ford&quot; and Old Norse &quot;fjörðr&quot; as in Whale Firth, &quot;&quot; which is an Old Norse cognate with English &#x27;way&#x27; (Old English &#x27;weġ&#x27;)(Old Norse &quot;vagr&quot;) as in &quot;Gloup Voe&quot;, &quot;sound&quot; (Both Old English and Old Norse use &quot;sund&quot;) as in &quot;Bluemull Sound&quot; and &quot;-a(y)&quot; (&quot;ey&quot;) as in nearby Hascosay and Linga.

===Hanseatic trade and early modern period===

Although most of Shetland&#x27;s Hanseatic trade was conducted from Scalloway, Burravoe was one of the most important of the other Hanseatic centres in the archipelago.

In the 17th century, the Dutch East Indian Ship, &quot;Lastdrager&quot; was wrecked on Yell, and the survivor, Jan Camphuis wrote favorably of his experiences on the island. He noted the generosity and kindness of the islanders to him while he was there, which he believed was disproportionate to their poverty. Yell is mentioned by Martin Martin in his 1695 &quot;A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland&quot; where he noted that &quot;there are three churches, and several small chapels in it.&quot;

The Rev. Crutwell in the 18th century said of Yell that &quot;the inhabitants have plenty of fuel, catch immense quantities of small fish, and live comfortably.&quot;

===Modern history===
Johnnie Notions successfully carried out early smallpox inoculations on Yell in the 18th century, at a time when many other places remained sceptical.

In the 1841 New Statistical Account the minister of Fetlar and North Yell noted that although smuggling had almost entirely disappeared the local population had &quot;fallen into an abominable habit of smoking tobacco&quot;. In the same year the minister of Mid and South Yell observed a rise of 50% in the local price of black cattle due to the introduction of a fortnightly steamer service from Lerwick to Leith that had enabled exports of livestock to mainland Scotland. Fishing on Yell received a particularly vicious blow when 53 fishermen were killed in a storm off Gloup in 1881. There is a memorial to them there now.

Germans have claimed that during the First World War their U-boats used to shelter in Whale Firth – this is possible because of the very low population of the area.

During the Second World War the Luftwaffe bombed the post office at Gutcher in an attempt to disrupt the communications system. On 19 January 1942 a Catalina airplane crashed on the hill above Burravoe. Seven of her ten passengers were killed and one of the propellers can be seen outside the Old Haa Museum.

Just after the Second World War the old herring curing station at Grimister closed; this was to be one in a long line of economic difficulties including the loss of fishing.

Between 1953 and 1964 Dr Robert Hope-Simpson, a GP, carried out painstaking research establishing that shingles is the reactivation of previously acquired chickenpox (varicella) virus.

In 1961 a Soviet spy ship sank off Yell; the wreck was found by Lieutenant George Wookey, who had also investigated the wreck that inspired &quot;Whisky Galore&quot; in the Outer Hebrides. It was an undercover plain clothes mission; Lt. Wookey found the wreck down in clear water.

During the 1960s Yell reached an impasse. It was in 1965 that the Orcadian novelist Eric Linklater said that Yell was &quot;the problem child of the archipelago&quot; due to its economic woes and burgeoning depopulation. Some blamed this on the islanders&#x27; &quot;social egalitarianism&quot;, which supposedly prevented anyone from becoming a &quot;leader or entrepreneur&quot;; Haswell-Smith disagrees but believes that &quot;airing the matter seems to have helped&quot; It is certainly notable that the tiny remote Out Skerries seem to be wealthier and that Whalsay is better at retaining its population. Yell is neither near Lerwick like Bressay nor bridged to the mainland like Burra or Muckle Roe. Some Yell people do commute to work at Sullom Voe, but as this appears to be a declining industry this does not hold out hope for the future. Unlike neighbouring Fetlar, Yell never suffered large scale clearances, only some local ones, and has long had multiple ownership. Jim Crumley, himself an incomer, has noted the difficulties faced by Yell by both depopulation and repopulation.

==Flora and fauna==
The coastline of Yell includes numerous voes (narrow inlets) where otters and various seabirds are common. Brown trout can be found in the inland waters.

===Mammals===
Yell claims to be the &quot;Otter Capital of Britain&quot;. The shore is low-lying and the peaty soil is soft, making it ideal for excavation burrows. The long days in summer also make spotting these largely nocturnal creatures in daylight more likely than on the British mainland. Hugh Miles&#x27; documentary &quot;The Track of the Wild Otter&quot; was shot on location at Burra Ness at the mouth of Busta Voe; it gained awards and was produced for the BBC. Grey and common seals are also regular visitors to Yell&#x27;s coast. 

Yell occasionally receives the odd Arctic visitor besides the tern; in 1977, a stray bearded seal was recorded. Normally these creatures only live on the pack ice. Humans have introduced a number of animals including rabbits, and it has even been questioned whether otters could have arrived by themselves, although this is controversial. Porpoises are occasionally seen nearby too.

The island has its own subspecies of field mouse, as do some of the other Shetland Islands, and Hirta in St Kilda.

===Birds===
A population of Arctic terns, known locally as &quot;tirricks&quot; (stress on last syllable; an onomatopoeic word), migrates to Shetland from Antarctica during the summer. As swallows are sometimes seen as harbingers of summer elsewhere, in Yell and Shetland, it is the tirricks or terns that fulfil this role -

&quot;On Yell [the Arctic tern] has the impact of August on a heather moor, and nothing draws the islander closer to nature’s year than the first tern.&quot;

Other birds that regularly visit Yell include great and Arctic skuas, various terns, eider, Eurasian whimbrel, red-throated diver, dunlin, golden plover, twite, lapwing and merlin. The Eigg, and Ern Stack in the north west of Yell, is the last known nesting site of Shetland sea eagles, which were recorded there in 1910.

===Flora===
Yell has many of the usual plants found in northern European moorland, especially heather in abundance, including two carnivorous plants, the butterwort and the sundew. A substantial study of the flora of Yell&#x27;s dry stone walls was undertaken in 1986–87. Lichens, especially
&quot;Ramalina&quot; species, were the most commonly found plants.

The gorges in the island, such as the Daal of Lumbister provide an important environment for some of the few trees on the island, since they are untouched by sheep grazing. Before human colonisation, it appears that Yell was wooded to some degree, at least with dwarf trees and shrubs. In the gorge at the head of Gloup Voe, dog roses and honeysuckle can be found. As the peat preserves old plants and pollen to some degree, due to its anaerobic nature, it is possible to get some sense of the former vegetation of the island. For example, it is known that 40,000 years ago, before the advent of the last ice age, and probably any human habitation, that oak, Scots pine and Mediterranean heathers were growing here. The remains of these plants have been preserved in layers of ancient peat, which were in turn buried by the boulder clay left by glacial moraines.

==Transportation==


Yell is a transport hub for the neighbouring islands of Unst and Fetlar.

The Yell Sound Ferry sails from Ulsta on the island to Toft on the Shetland Mainland. The service is operated by two ferries—&quot;Daggri&quot; (Norse for &quot;dawn&quot;), launched in 2003 and &quot;Dagalien&quot; (Norse for &quot;dusk&quot;), launched in 2004. These vessels, built in Gdańsk in Poland, can each carry 31 cars or 4 trucks, as well as 95 passengers. The crossing takes approximately 20 minutes, and ferries leave around every half-hour at peak times. The Bluemull Sound Ferry sails from Gutcher on Yell to Belmont on Unst and Oddsta on Fetlar. The ferries travel to Unst approximately every half-hour during the day, and to Fetlar a few times every day. The journey to Unst takes ten minutes, while travelling to Fetlar takes 25 minutes. The service is operated by &quot;Bigga&quot; and &quot;Geira&quot;.

There are two main roads, the A968 and the B9081. The A968 runs from Ulsta in the southwest of the island to Gutcher in the northeast, linking the ferry to and from Mainland, Shetland, with those going to Unst and Fetlar. Despite being a listed A road, it is single track in some stretches with passing places. The B9081 is single track with passing places. It runs along the south coast of Yell, and up its east, and part of the northeast too. The stretch from Mid Yell to Gutcher is replaced by the A968, but it recommences after that.

==Economy==
Yell&#x27;s industries include fishing, fish farming, farming (including commercial strawberry production in polytunnels, mainly for the Shetland market), peat cutting, transport and tourism.

Cullivoe had a new deep water harbour built in 1991, but the general decline in fish stocks in the North Sea and North Atlantic has not made it useful to fishing. It may however fulfil a transport role.

In January 2008, the Shetland Development Trust gave a loan worth £11,000 to Global Yell Ltd, in order to develop &quot;creative industries&quot;, i.e. textile weaving and music.

The &quot;world&#x27;s first community-owned tidal power generator&quot; became operational during April 2014 in Bluemull Sound. The turbine is a 30 kW device by Nova Innovation. North Yell Development Council believed that the project could make a significant contribution to the local economy.

==Notable buildings and structures==
Built in 1707, the now ruined stone building of Windhouse is claimed as the most haunted house in Shetland. In 1880, when Windhouse was renovated, skeletons were found under the floor of the building. After lying empty for over 80 years, it was bought in 2003 by an English couple intending to restore it. As of February 2015, no restoration has taken place and the property is back on the market.

Windhouse Lodge is the solidly built gatehouse to Windhouse and is run by Shetland Amenity Trust as a camping Böd. This is a well-equipped böd providing accommodation for up to eight people in three bedrooms. Facilities include a hot water heater, shower, crockery, basic cooking utensils, fridge, microwave, kettle, compact cooker with grill, oven and 2 hotplates.

The Old Haa of Brough in Burravoe is a substantial merchant&#x27;s house built in 1672 now converted to a museum and visitor centre.

At Kirkabister, the remains of a former pony stud can be seen. The enclosure is unusual in appearance, having each of its four corners slightly elevated. There are only a handful of such enclosures in the archipelago.

==Folklore==
At Breckon it is said that when an eroding grave was excavated, a number of human skeletons were uncovered, one of which was not only at least seven-foot tall, but had small stumpy &quot;horns&quot; above the temples. Whether this man was a mutant or this is a tall story is unclear.

Like all good Nordic lands, Yell has its trolls (known in the Northern Isles as &quot;trows&quot; or &quot;trowes&quot;). The Trow of Windhouse was about as recently as the 1880s, when a shipwrecked sailor claimed he had been attacked by the mythical monster. However, the sailor was courageous enough to fight the creature, and saw it off with an axe. It is said that where he killed the trow, the grass turned a light green. This was not the only trow by any means, and there is another story of a Yell woman coming upon a family of trowes, who later woke up to find one in the house, asking who he was, he said &quot;I am Trippa&#x27;s son&quot;. The woman said a prayer, and the trowe disappeared.

==Literature==

===George MacKay Brown===
George Mackay Brown, an Orcadian poet, wrote a poem which has a Yell-man of 1263 as a narrator.

:&quot;I am a farmer from Yell in Shetland.&quot;
:&quot;Bjorn my mother called me.&quot;

Bjorn grows up amongst &quot;seals and clouds and birds and women&quot; on the island, but this idyll is contrasted with his father&#x27;s disappearance, and profession as a Viking pirate covered in scars and &quot;harvesting&quot; silver.

===Jim Crumley and &quot;Among Islands&quot;===
Jim Crumley is a Dundonian who bought a semi-ruined cottage on Yell. He has written extensively on Yell in the book &quot;Among Islands&quot; (1994), which contains subject matter ranging from St Kilda and the Hebrides to Shetland. He says his original interest in islands sprung from seeing Inchcape out in the distance, as a teenager. He worked for over twenty years in various newspapers, usually writing about Scottish wildlife and landscapes; his later work has included a number of books on the Scottish islands, and mountains, often including his own photographs.

Crumley has said, &quot;You could never argue with conviction that Yell is a beautiful place&quot;, but some others such as Jill Blackadder rate the Sands of Breckon and the cliff scenery of Gloup Voe as some of the best in Shetland. Despite issuing an apparent dismissal, Crumley still has a definite affection for the island, and its almost mechanical role in Shetland as a whole. In fact, the statement turns out to be a kind of a backhanded compliment:

:&quot;It looks the way Orkney must have in centuries past before that relentless greening began. The only green on a Yell moor in April is a boggy ooze. Yet Yell is the Shetland I carry with me, the Shetland I pack when I leave, the Shetland I am impatient for when I return. It works because of where it is, an island among islands, a perfectly sealed lynchpin, which makes geographical sense of Shetland, and without which the whole archipelago would slide out of kilter and slither uncontrollably into the sea.&quot;

As an incomer himself, he writes on the complications that this has caused the island:

:&quot;As elsewhere, the island has suffered from depopulation, and has been challenged by repopulation... good intentions do not turn an incomer into a son of the island soil. That is not to say that there is no place for the incomer [though].&quot;

<text>The Carolina chickadee (Poecile carolinensis) is a small passerine bird in the tit family Paridae.

== Taxonomy ==
The Carolina chickadee was often placed in the genus &quot;Parus&quot; with most other tits, but mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence data and morphology suggest that separating &quot;Poecile&quot; more adequately expresses these birds&#x27; relationships. The American Ornithologists&#x27; Union has been treating &quot;Poecile&quot; as distinct genus since 1998. Although it and the black-capped chickadee most likely diverged about 2.5 million years ago, the birds still hybridize in the areas where their ranges overlap. The offspring of mated pairs of hybrid chickadees suffer from lower hatching success, and a male bias sex ratio, consistent with Haldane&#x27;s rule.

==Description==
Adults are long with a weight of , and have a black cap and bib with white sides to the face. Their underparts are white with rusty brown on the flanks; their back is gray. They have a short dark bill, short wings and a moderately long tail. Very similar to the black-capped chickadee, the Carolina chickadee is distinguished by the slightly browner wing with the greater coverts brown (not whitish fringed) and the white fringing on the secondary feathers slightly less conspicuous; the tail is also slightly shorter and more square-ended. Without calls, visual distinction between the two species is very difficult even with an excellent view.

Eggs are about 1.5 cm (0.6 in) long and 1.1 cm (0.4 in) wide. Eggs are white with areas of reddish-brown ranging from dots to small blotches.

==Vocalization==
The calls and song between the Carolina chickadee and the black-capped chickadee differ subtly to an experienced ear: the Carolina chickadee&#x27;s &quot;chick-a-dee&quot; call is faster and higher pitched than that of the black-capped chickadee, and the Carolina chickadee has a four note &quot;fee-bee-fee-bay&quot; song, whereas the black-capped omits the high notes. 

The most famous call is the familiar &quot;chick-a-dee-dee-dee,&quot; which gave this bird its name. Its song is &quot;fee-bee-fee-bay&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==

Their breeding habitat is mixed or deciduous forests in the United States from New Jersey and Pennsylvania west to southern Kansas and south to Florida and Texas; there is a gap in the range at high altitudes in the Appalachian Mountains where they are replaced by their otherwise more northern relative, the black-capped chickadee.

They are permanent residents, not usually moving south even in severe winter weather.

==Diet==
These birds hop along tree branches searching for insects, sometimes hanging upside down or hovering; they may make short flights to catch insects in the air. Insects form a large part of their diet, especially in summer; seeds and berries become important in winter. They sometimes hammer seeds on a tree or shrub to open them; they also will store seeds for later use. Carolina chickadees commonly make use of feeders.

== Behavior ==
During the fall migration and winter, chickadees often flock together in flocks of 8–10 birds. Each of the birds in a flock has a rank; while highly ranked birds will remain on the flock&#x27;s territory for breeding, lower-ranked birds must find new breeding territory. Many other species of birds, including titmice, nuthatches, and warblers can often be found foraging in these flocks. Mixed flocks occur about 50% of the time. Mixed flocks stay together because the chickadees call out whenever they find a good source of food. This calling out forms cohesion for the group, allowing the other birds to find food more efficiently.

Carolina chickadees actively defend individual spaces of 2–5 ft (0.6–1.5 m) apart; if another bird encroaches on these spaces, the dominant bird may make gargle calls. At feeders, these birds will usually take a seed and fly to a branch isolated from other birds to eat it.

These birds usually sleep in cavities, though they may sleep in branches. Different members of a flock will sleep in the same cavity from night to night. While females usually sleep in the nest cavity, males will normally sleep on a nearby branch.

== Breeding ==
They nest in a hole in a tree; the pair excavates the nest, using a natural cavity or sometimes an old woodpecker nest. They may interbreed with black-capped chickadees where the ranges overlap, which can make identification even more difficult. The female will build the nest out of moss and strips of bark; she will then line it with hair or plant fibers. Clutches are usually made up of 3–10 eggs with an incubation period of 12–16 days. The nestling period is usually 16–19 days.

==Temperature regulation==

Carolina chickadees are able to lower their body temperatures to induce an intentional state of hypothermia called torpor. They do this to conserve energy during extremely cold winters. In extreme cold weather conditions they look for cavities where they can hide in and spend up to fifteen hours at a time in torpor. During this time they are awake but unresponsive; they should not be picked up and handled at this time because the stress of being held may cause death.

<text>Fetlar is one of the North Isles of Shetland, Scotland, with a usually resident population of 61 at the time of the 2011 census. Its main settlement is Houbie on the south coast, home to the Fetlar Interpretive Centre. Other settlements include Aith, Funzie, Herra and Tresta. Fetlar is the fourth-largest island of Shetland and has an area of just over .

==Etymology==
There are three island names in Shetland of unknown and possibly pre-Celtic origin: Fetlar, Unst and Yell. The earliest recorded forms of these three names do carry Norse meanings: &quot;Fetlar&quot; is the plural of &quot;fetill&quot; and means &quot;shoulder-straps&quot;, &quot;Omstr&quot; is &quot;corn-stack&quot;, and &quot;í Ála&quot; is from &quot;ál&quot; meaning &quot;deep furrow&quot;. However, these descriptions are hardly obvious ones as island names, and are probably adaptations of a pre-Norse language. This may have been Pictish but there is no clear evidence for this. Haswell-Smith suggests a meaning of &quot;prosperous land&quot; and that the island&#x27;s name may mean &quot;two islands strapped together&quot; by the Funzie Girt. It was recorded as &quot;Fötilør&quot; in 1490, and as &quot;Pheodor Oy&quot; in 1654.

==History==
One of the strange features of Fetlar is a huge wall that goes across the island known as the Funzie Girt or Finnigirt Dyke. It is thought to date from the Mesolithic period. So sharp was the division between the two halves of the island that the Norse talked of East and West Isle separately.
Another attraction on the island is the Gothic Brough Lodge, built by Arthur Nicolson in about 1820, and which is undergoing restoration by the Brough Lodge Trust. The Fetlar sheepdog trials take place annually, normally in July. The Fetlar Foy, once very popular with Shetlanders and tourists alike, took place at midsummer on the Links at Tresta where folk were entertained with music, food and drink.

===Famous son===
Its most famous son was Sir William Watson Cheyne Bt FRS FRCS, a close associate of Lord Lister and one of the pioneers of antiseptics. He was professor of surgery at King&#x27;s College London, President of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and wrote many books on medical treatments. He was made a baronet for services to medicine in 1908, and later was an MP—first for the Universities of Edinburgh and St Andrews, and then for the Combined Scottish Universities—between 1917 and 1922. He was lord-lieutenant of the Shetland Islands from 1919 to 1930. Cheyne died on 19 April 1932.

Fetlar was home to the Society of Our Lady of the Isles, an Anglican religious order for women, until it moved to Unst in 2015.

===Fishing and shipwrecks===
The island has a long tradition of fishing. According to Guinness World Records, in August 2012 what was then the oldest message in a bottle, released in June 1914, was found by Andrew Leaper, skipper of the &quot;Copious&quot;, coincidentally the same fishing vessel involved in a previous record recovery in 2006. The bottle, and Mr Leaper&#x27;s World Record certificate, have been donated to the Fetlar Interpretative Centre. Fetlar also has an international selection of shipwrecks including Danish, Dutch, German, English and Soviet vessels.

==Geography and geology==
Fetlar has a very complex geology, including gneiss in the west, metamorphosed gabbro and phyllite, and kaolin. There is also antigorite and steatite here. Talc was mined here. The east of the island is part of the Shetland ophiolite complex (a section of the Earth&#x27;s oceanic crust and the underlying upper mantle that has been uplifted and exposed above sea level).

Fetlar is surrounded by a number of small islands, particularly in the sound between it and Unst. These include to the north: Daaey, Haaf Gruney, Sound Gruney, Urie Lingey and Uyea; and to the west: Hascosay and Linga.

It is separated from Hascosay and Yell by Colgrave Sound. Much further to the south are the Out Skerries and Whalsay.

==Nature and conservation==
Fetlar&#x27;s wildlife is as varied as its geology. For example, over two hundred species of wild flower have been identified here. The island is known as &quot;The Garden of Shetland&quot;, due to its highly fertile soil.

The northern part of Fetlar is a RSPB reserve, home to several important breeding species including Arctic skuas and Eurasian whimbrels. The Lamb Hoga peninsula and nearby Haaf Gruney have some of the largest colonies of European storm petrel. In total the island supports 20,000 individual seabirds, including nationally important populations of Arctic skua, Northern fulmar, great skua, Arctic tern and red-necked phalarope. Of greatest importance are red-necked phalaropes, for which the Loch of Funzie is the most important breeding site in the United Kingdom, and for a while during the 1990s was the only breeding site in the country. A pair of snowy owls famously bred here in the 1960s and early 1970s. They lasted until the 1980s before disappearing. However, a snowy owl was spotted on Fetlar in October 2018. Most of the island, with some adjacent islets, has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

Fetlar, and the seas around it, hold several overlapping conservation designations:
*The North Fetlar Special Area of Conservation (SAC) covers of the island, and protects the islands dry heaths and base-rich fens .
*The Fetlar Special Protection Area (SPA), covers of the island and surrounding seas due to the importance of this habitat for many species of seabirds. 
*The Fetlar to Haroldswick Nature Conservation Marine Protected Area protects of sea. It completely surrounds Fetlar, and extends to cover all sea between the islands and the neighbouring islands of Yell and Unst from the Colgrave Sound to Haroldswick.

==Infrastructure==
Ferries sail daily from Hamars Ness on Fetlar to Gutcher on Yell, and to Belmont on Unst. A new breakwater and berthing facility was added at Hamars Ness, and was officially opened on 1 December 2012.

There is a communications tower on Fetlar at: 60°36&#x27;5.39&quot;N, 0°55&#x27;35.44&quot;W. Fetlar is &quot;Under Evaluation&quot; for superfast broadband according to Digital Scotland.

Fetlar has a small airstrip with a gravel runway. There are no longer scheduled air services to the island.

==Community development==
Fetlar Developments Ltd (FDL), a company limited by guarantee and a registered charity, was set up by the community to counter the depopulation of the island, which had fallen to just 48 in early 2009, when the 2001 total had been 86. The development company continue to work towards securing a sustainable future for the island both socially and economically.

Work to install three wind turbines in a Community wind energy project began in December 2015.

==School==
In 2009 there were 3 primary pupils and 1 nursery pupil at Fetlar primary school, situated at Baela near Houbie.

<doc id="478435" wikidata="Q2704365" url="?curid=478435" title="The History of Sexuality">
<text>The History of Sexuality () is a four-volume study of sexuality in the Western world by the French historian and philosopher Michel Foucault, in which the author examines the emergence of &quot;sexuality&quot; as a discursive object and separate sphere of life and argues that the notion that every individual has a sexuality is a relatively recent development in Western societies. The first volume, &quot;The Will to Knowledge&quot; (&quot;La volonté de savoir&quot;), was first published in 1976; an English translation appeared in 1978. &quot;The Use of Pleasure&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;usage des plaisirs&quot;) and &quot;The Care of the Self&quot; (&quot;Le souci de soi&quot;) were published in 1984. The fourth volume, &quot;Confessions of the Flesh&quot; (&quot;Les aveux de la chair&quot;), was published posthumously in 2018.

In Volume 1, Foucault criticizes the &quot;repressive hypothesis&quot;: the idea that western society suppressed sexuality from the 17th to the mid-20th century due to the rise of capitalism and bourgeois society. Foucault argues that discourse on sexuality in fact proliferated during this period, during which experts began to examine sexuality in a scientific manner, encouraging people to confess their sexual feelings and actions. According to Foucault, in the 18th and 19th centuries society took an increasing interest in sexualities that did not fit within the marital bond: the &quot;world of perversion&quot; that includes the sexuality of children, the mentally ill, the criminal and the homosexual, while by the 19th century, sexuality was being readily explored both through confession and scientific enquiry. In Volume 2 and Volume 3, Foucault addresses the role of sex in Greek and Roman antiquity.

The book received a mixed reception, with some reviewers praising it and others criticizing Foucault&#x27;s scholarship.

==Volume I: The Will to Knowledge==

===Part I: We &quot;Other Victorians&quot;===
In Part One, Foucault discusses the &quot;repressive hypothesis&quot;, the widespread belief among late 20th-century westerners that sexuality, and the open discussion of sex, was socially repressed during the late 17th, 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, a by-product of the rise of capitalism and bourgeois society, before the partial liberation of sexuality in modern times. Arguing that sexuality was never truly repressed, Foucault asks why modern westerners believe the hypothesis, noting that in portraying past sexuality as repressed, it provides a basis for the idea that in rejecting past moral systems, future sexuality can be free and uninhibited, a &quot;garden of earthly delights&quot;. The title of the section is inspired by Steven Marcus&#x27;s book &quot;The Other Victorians: A Study of Sexuality and Pornography in Mid-Nineteenth-Century England&quot;.

===Part II: The Repressive Hypothesis===
In Part Two, Foucault notes that from the 17th century to the 1970s, there had actually been a &quot;veritable discursive explosion&quot; in the discussion of sex, albeit using an &quot;authorized vocabulary&quot; that codified where one could talk about it, when one could talk about it, and with whom. He argues that this desire to talk so enthusiastically about sex in the western world stems from the Counter-Reformation, when the Roman Catholic Church called for its followers to confess their sinful desires as well as their actions. As evidence for the obsession of talking about sex, he highlights the publication of the book &quot;My Secret Life&quot;, anonymously written in the late 19th century and detailing the sex life of a Victorian gentleman. Indeed, Foucault states that at the start of the 18th century, there was an emergence of &quot;a political, economic, and technical incitement to talk about sex&quot;, with self-appointed experts speaking both moralistically and rationally on sex, the latter sort trying to categorize it. He notes that in that century, governments became increasingly aware that they were not merely having to manage &quot;subjects&quot; or &quot;a people&quot; but a &quot;population&quot;, and that because of this they had to concern themselves with such topics as birth and death rates, marriage, and contraception, thereby increasing their interest and changing their discourse on sexuality.

Foucault argues that prior to the 18th century, discourse on sexuality focuses on the productive role of the married couple, which is monitored by both canonical and civil law. In the 18th and 19th centuries, he argues, society ceases discussing the sex lives of married couples, instead taking an increasing interest in sexualities that did not fit within this union; the &quot;world of perversion&quot; that includes the sexuality of children, the mentally ill, the criminal and the homosexual. He notes that this had three major effects on society. Firstly, there was increasing categorization of these &quot;perverts&quot;; where previously a man who engaged in same-sex activities would be labeled as an individual who succumbed to the sin of sodomy, now they would be categorised into a new &quot;species,&quot; that of homosexual. Secondly, Foucault argues that the labeling of perverts conveyed a sense of &quot;pleasure and power&quot; on to both those studying sexuality and the perverts themselves. Thirdly, he argues that bourgeois society exhibited &quot;blatant and fragmented perversion,&quot; readily engaging in perversity but regulating where it could take place.

===Part III: &quot;Scientia Sexualis&quot;===
In part three, Foucault explores the development of the scientific study of sex, the attempt to unearth the &quot;truth&quot; of sex, a phenomenon which Foucault argues is peculiar to the West. In contrast to the West&#x27;s sexual science, Foucault introduces the &quot;ars erotica&quot;, which he states has only existed in Ancient and Eastern societies. Furthermore, he argues that this &quot;scientia sexualis&quot; has repeatedly been used for political purposes, being utilized in the name of &quot;public hygiene&quot; to support state racism. Returning to the influence of Catholic confession, he looks at the relationship between the one confessing and the authoritarian figure that he confesses to, arguing that as Roman Catholicism was eclipsed in much of Western and Northern Europe following the Reformation, the concept of confession survived and became more widespread, entering into the relationship between parent and child, patient and psychiatrist and student and educator. By the 19th century, he maintains, the &quot;truth&quot; of sexuality was being readily explored both through confession and scientific enquiry. Foucault proceeds to examine how the confession of sexuality then comes to be &quot;constituted in scientific terms,&quot; arguing that scientists begin to trace the cause of all aspects of human psychology and society to sexual factors.

===Part IV: The Deployment of Sexuality===

In part four, Foucault explores the question as to &quot;why&quot; western society wishes to seek for the &quot;truth&quot; of sex. Foucault argues for the need to develop an &quot;analytics&quot; of power through which to understand sex. Highlighting that power controls sex by laying down rules for others to follow, he discusses how power demands obedience through domination, submission, and subjugation, and also how power masks its true intentions by disguising itself as beneficial. As an example, he highlights the manner in which the feudal absolute monarchies of historical Europe, themselves a form of &quot;power&quot;, disguised their intentions by claiming that they were necessary to maintain law, order, and peace. As a leftover concept from the days of feudalism, Foucault argues that westerners still view power as emanating from law, but he rejects this, stressing the need to &quot;construct an analytics of power that no longer takes law as a model and a code,&quot; and announcing that a different form of power governs sexuality. &quot;We must,&quot; Foucault states, &quot;at the same time conceive of sex without the law, and power without the king.&quot;

Foucault explains that he does not mean &quot;power&quot; as the domination or subjugation exerted on society by the government or the state. Rather, power should be understood &quot;as the multiplicity of force relations immanent in the sphere in which they operate.&quot; In this way, he argues, &quot;Power is everywhere ... because it comes from everywhere,&quot; emanating from all social relationships and being imposed throughout society bottom-up rather than top-down. Foucault criticizes Wilhelm Reich, writing that while an important &quot;historico-political&quot; critique of sexual repression formed around Reich, &quot;the very possibility of its success was tied to the fact that it always unfolded within the deployment of sexuality, and not outside or against it.&quot; According to Foucault, that sexual behavior in western societies was able to change in many ways &quot;without any of the promises or political conditions predicted by Reich being realized&quot; demonstrates that the &quot;antirepressive&quot; struggle is &quot;a tactical shift and reversal in the great deployment of sexuality.&quot;

===Part V: Right of Death and Power over Life===
In part five, Foucault asserts that the motivations for power over life and death have changed. As in feudal times the &quot;right to life&quot; was more or less a &quot;right to death&quot; because sovereign powers were able to decide when a person died. This has changed to a &quot;right to live,&quot; as sovereign states are more concerned about the power of how people live. Power becomes about how to foster life. For example, a state decides to execute someone as a safe guard to society not as justified, as it once was, as vengeful justice. This new emphasis on power over life is called Biopower and comes in two forms. First, Foucault says it is &quot;centered on the body as a machine: its disciplining, the optimization of its capabilities, the extortion of its forces, the parallel increase of its usefulness and its docility, its integration into systems of efficient and economic controls.&quot; The second form, Foucault argues, emerged later and focuses on the &quot;species body, the body imbued with the mechanics of life and serving as the basis of the biological processes: propagation, births and mortality, the level of health, life expectancy and longevity, with all the conditions that cause these to vary.&quot; Biopower, it is argued, is the source of the rise of capitalism, as states became interested in regulating and normalizing power over life and not as concerned about punishing and condemning actions.

==Volume II: The Use of Pleasure==
In this volume, Foucault discusses &quot;the manner in which sexual activity was problematized by philosophers and doctors in classical Greek culture of the fourth century B. C.&quot;. Exploring works of Greek philosophers such as Seneca, Xenophon, Plato, and many more, Foucault explains the aim of this volume to unravel the process of the structuralization of sexuality as an ethical practice in Greek culture. To do so, the book inspects four Greek practices: dietetics to understand the relation of the self with the body, economics as the management of marriage and households, erotics to explore the codes of conduct between men and boys, and finally, the understanding of true love in philosophy. For Foucault, this exploration of Greek practices illustrates an &quot;history of the desiring subject&quot;, which is crucial for understanding the modern construction of sexuality.

==Volume III: The Care of the Self==
In this volume, Foucault discusses texts such as the Oneirocritica, (&quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;), of Artemidorus. Other authors whose work is discussed include Galen, Plutarch, and Pseudo-Lucian. Foucault describes the Oneirocritica as a &quot;point of reference&quot; for his work, one that exemplifies a common way of thinking.

==Volume IV: Confessions of the Flesh==

In this draft version of the fourth volume, published and translated after his death, Foucault traces the adoption and adaptation by early Christian societies of earlier pre-Christian ideas of pleasure. He discusses Saint Augustine of Hippo.

==Publication history==
Three volumes of &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; were published before Foucault&#x27;s death in 1984. The first volume, &quot;The Will to Knowledge&quot; (previously known as &quot;An Introduction&quot; in English—&quot;Histoire de la sexualité, 1: la volonté de savoir&quot; in French) was published in France in 1976, and translated in 1977, focusing primarily on the last two centuries, and the functioning of sexuality as an analytics of power related to the emergence of a science of sexuality, and the emergence of biopower in the West. The work was a further development of the account of the &quot;interaction of knowledge&quot; and power Foucault provided in &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; (1975).

According to Arnold Davidson, the back cover of the first volume announced that there would be five forthcoming volumes: Volume 2, &quot;The Flesh and the Body&quot;, would &quot;concern the prehistory of our modern experience of sexuality, concentrating on the problematization of sex in early Christianity&quot;; Volume 3, &quot;The Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot;, would discuss &quot;the sexuality of children, especially the problem of childhood masturbation&quot;; Volume 4, &quot;Woman, Mother, Hysteric&quot;, would discuss &quot;the specific ways in which sexuality had been invested in the female body&quot;; Volume 5, &quot;Perverts&quot;, was &quot;planned to investigate exactly what the title named&quot;; and Volume 6, &quot;Population and Races&quot;, was to examine &quot;the way in which treatises, both theoretical and practical, on the topics of population and race were linked to the history&quot; of &quot;biopolitics.&quot; Foucault subsequently abandoned this plan, with only the second volume of this original plan emerging as posthumous volume four.

The second two volumes, &quot;The Use of Pleasure&quot; (&quot;Histoire de la sexualité, II: l&#x27;usage des plaisirs&quot;) and &quot;The Care of the Self&quot; (&quot;Histoire de la sexualité, III: le souci de soi&quot;) dealt with the role of sex in Greek and Roman antiquity. The latter volume deals considerably with the ancient technological development of the hypomnema which was used to establish a permanent relationship to oneself. Both were published in 1984, the year of Foucault&#x27;s death, the second volume being translated in 1985, and the third in 1986.

The fourth volume, &quot;Confessions of the Flesh&quot; was published posthumously in 2018. Emerging from the planned second volume of his original scheme for the Histoire, the theme of the book were developed in his lecture series from 1979 to 1980 where Foucault extended his analysis of government and biopolitics to its &quot;wider sense of techniques and procedures designed to direct the behaviour of men&quot;, which involved a new consideration of the &quot;examination of conscience&quot; and confession in early Christian literature. These themes of early Christian literature seemed to dominate Foucault&#x27;s work, alongside his study of Greek and Roman literature, until the end of his life. The planned fourth volume of &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; was accordingly entitled &quot;Confessions of the Flesh&quot; (&quot;Les aveux de la chair&quot;), addressing Christianity.

Foucault&#x27;s death in 1984 left the work incomplete, and the publication was delayed due to the restrictions of Foucault&#x27;s estate. The volume was almost finished at the time of his death, and a copy was held in the Foucault archive. The work first became available to researchers when both handwritten and typed manuscripts of &quot;Confessions of the Flesh&quot; were sold by Daniel Defert, Foucault&#x27;s partner, to the National Library of France in 2013 as part of the Foucault archive. Foucault&#x27;s family decided that as the material was already partially accessible, it should be published for everyone to read. It was edited and finally published in February 2018, despite Foucault explicitly disallowing posthumous publication of his works, and was published in English for the first time by Penguin in Feb 2021, translated by Robert Hurley who had translated Penguin&#x27;s earlier volumes in the series, and was released straight into their Penguin Classics imprint.

==Reception==
The reception of &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; among scholars and academics has been mixed.

===Scientific and academic journals===
The cultural anthropologist and sociologist Stephen O. Murray wrote in the &quot;Archives of Sexual Behavior&quot; that a passage of &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; in which Foucault discussed how European medical discourse of the late 19th century had classified homosexuals had &quot;clouded the minds&quot; of many social historical theorists and researchers, who had produced a &quot;voluminous discourse&quot; that ignored how homosexuals had been classified before the late 19th century or non-European cultures. The philosopher Alan Soble wrote in the &quot;Journal of Sex Research&quot; that &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; &quot;caused a thunderstorm among philosophers, historians, and other theorists of sex&quot;. He credited Foucault with inspiring &quot;genealogical&quot; studies &quot;informed by the heuristic idea that not only are patterns of sexual desire and behavior socially engineered ... but also that the concepts of our sexual discourse are equally socially constructed&quot; and with influencing &quot;gender studies, feminism, Queer Theory, and the debate about the resemblance and continuity, or lack of it, between ancient and contemporary homoeroticism&quot;. He credited Simone de Beauvoir with anticipating Foucault&#x27;s view that patterns of sexual desire and behavior are socially determined.

===Evaluations in books, 1976–1989===
The historian Jane Caplan called &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; &quot;certainly the most ambitious and interesting recent attempt to analyse the relations between the production of concepts and the history of society in the field of sexuality&quot;, but criticized Foucault for using an &quot;undifferentiated concept&quot; of speech and an imprecise notion of &quot;power&quot;. The gay rights activist Dennis Altman described Foucault&#x27;s work as representative of the position that homosexuals emerged as a social category in 18th and 19th century western Europe in &quot;The Homosexualization of America&quot; (1982). The feminist Germaine Greer wrote that Foucault rightly argues that, &quot;what we have all along taken as the breaking-through of a silence and the long delayed giving of due attention to human sexuality was in fact the promotion of human sexuality, indeed, the creation of an internal focus for the individual&#x27;s preoccupations.&quot; The historian Peter Gay wrote that Foucault is right to raise questions about the &quot;repressive hypothesis&quot;, but that &quot;his procedure is anecdotal and almost wholly unencumbered by facts; using his accustomed technique (reminiscent of the principle underlying Oscar Wilde&#x27;s humor) of turning accepted ideas upside down, he turns out to be right in part for his private reasons.&quot; The philosopher José Guilherme Merquior suggested in &quot;Foucault&quot; (1985) that Foucault&#x27;s views about sexual repression are preferable to those of Reich, Herbert Marcuse, and their followers in that they have provided more accurate descriptions and that Foucault is supported by &quot;the latest historiographic research on bourgeois sex&quot;. Merquior considered the second two volumes of &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; to be of higher scholarly quality than the first, and found Foucault to be &quot;original and insightful&quot; in his discussion of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius and other Stoics in &quot;The Care of the Self&quot;. However, he found the details of Foucault&#x27;s views open to question, and suggested that Foucault&#x27;s discussion of Greek pederasty is less illuminating than that of Kenneth Dover, despite Foucault&#x27;s references to Dover&#x27;s &quot;Greek Homosexuality&quot; (1978).

The philosopher Roger Scruton rejected Foucault&#x27;s claim that sexual morality is culturally relative in &quot;Sexual Desire&quot; (1986). He also criticized Foucault for assuming that there could be societies in which a &quot;problematisation&quot; of the sexual did not occur. Scruton concluded that, &quot;No history of thought could show the &#x27;problematisation&#x27; of sexual experience to be peculiar to certain specific social formations: it is characteristic of personal experience generally, and therefore of every genuine social order.&quot; The philosopher Peter Dews argued in &quot;Logics of Disintegration&quot; that Foucault&#x27;s rejection of the repressive hypothesis is more apparent than real, and that the hypothesis is not &quot;abolished, but simply displaced&quot; in &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;, as shown for example by Foucault&#x27;s persistent references to &quot;the body and its pleasures&quot; and to &quot;ars erotica&quot;. The classicist Page duBois called &quot;The Use of Pleasure&quot; &quot;one of the most exciting new books&quot; in classical studies and &quot;an important contribution to the history of sexuality&quot;, but added that Foucault &quot;takes for granted, and thus &#x27;authorizes,&#x27; exactly what needs to be explained: the philosophical establishment of the autonomous male subject&quot;. The historian Patricia O&#x27;Brien wrote that Foucault was &quot;without expertise&quot; in dealing with antiquity, and that &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; lacks the &quot;methodological rigor&quot; of Foucault&#x27;s earlier works, especially &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot;.

===Evaluations in books, 1990–present===
The philosopher Judith Butler argued in &quot;Gender Trouble&quot; (1990) that the theory of power Foucault expounds in the first volume of &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; is to some extent contradicted by Foucault&#x27;s subsequent discussion of the journals of Herculine Barbin, a 19th-century French intersex person: whereas in the former work Foucault asserts that sexuality is coextensive with power, in &quot;Herculine Barbin&quot; he &quot;fails to recognize the concrete relations of power that both construct and condemn Herculine&#x27;s sexuality&quot;, instead romanticizing Barbin&#x27;s world of pleasure as the &quot;happy limbo of a non-identity&quot;, and expressing views akin to those of Marcuse. Butler further argued that this conflict is evident within &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;, noting that Foucault refers there to &quot;bucolic&quot; and &quot;innocent&quot; sexual pleasures that exist prior to the imposition of &quot;regulative strategies&quot;.

The classicist David M. Halperin claimed in &quot;One Hundred Years of Homosexuality&quot; (1990) that the appearance of the English translation of the first volume of Foucault&#x27;s work in 1978, together with the publication of Dover&#x27;s &quot;Greek Homosexuality&quot; the same year, marked the beginning of a &quot;new era in the study of the history of sexuality&quot;. He suggested that &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; may be &quot;the most important contribution to the history of Western morality&quot; since Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;On the Genealogy of Morality&quot; (1887). The critic Camille Paglia rejected Halperin&#x27;s views, calling &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; a &quot;disaster&quot;. Paglia wrote that much of &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; is &quot;fantasy, unsupported by the ancient or modern historical record&quot;, and that it &quot;is acknowledged even by Foucault&#x27;s admirers to be his weakest work&quot;. The economist Richard Posner described &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; as, &quot;a remarkable fusion of philosophy and intellectual history&quot; in &quot;Sex and Reason&quot; (1992), adding that the book is lucidly written.

Diana Hamer wrote in the anthology &quot;The Sexual Imagination From Acker to Zola&quot; (1993) that &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; is Foucault&#x27;s best-known work on sexuality. The historian Michael Mason wrote that in &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;, Foucault presents what amounts to an argument &quot;against the possibility of making historical connections between beliefs about sex and sexual practices&quot;, but that the argument is only acceptable if one accepts the need to shift attention from &quot;sexuality&quot; to &quot;sex&quot; in thinking about the sexual culture of the last three centuries, and that Foucault does not make a case for such a need. The critic Alexander Welsh criticized Foucault for failing to place Sigmund Freud in the context of 19th century thought and culture. The classicist Walter Burkert called Foucault&#x27;s work the leading example of the position that sexuality takes different forms in different civilizations and is therefore a cultural construct. The historian Roy Porter called &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;, &quot;a brilliant enterprise, astonishingly bold, shocking even, in its subversion of conventional explanatory frameworks, chronologies, and evaluations, and in its proposed alternatives.&quot; Porter credited Foucault with discrediting the view, proposed for example by Marcuse in &quot;Eros and Civilization&quot; (1955), that &quot;industrialization demanded erotic austerity.&quot; The philosopher Martha Nussbaum wrote that the claim that homosexuality is a cultural construction is associated more with Foucault&#x27;s &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; than with any other work.

The classicist Bruce Thornton wrote that &quot;The Use of Pleasure&quot; was, &quot;usually quite readable, surveying the ancient evidence to make some good observations about the various techniques developed to control passion&quot;, but faulted Foucault for limiting his scope to &quot;fourth-century medical and philosophical works&quot;. The philosopher Arnold Davidson wrote that while &quot;Foucault&#x27;s interpretation of the culture of the self in late antiquity is sometimes too narrow and therefore misleading&quot;, this is a defect of &quot;interpretation&quot; rather than of &quot;conceptualization.&quot; Davidson argued that &quot;Foucault&#x27;s conceptualization of ethics as the self&#x27;s relationship to itself provides us with a framework of enormous depth and subtlety&quot; and &quot;allows us to grasp aspects of ancient thought that would otherwise remain occluded.&quot;

The psychoanalyst Joel Whitebook argued that while Foucault proposes that &quot;bodies and pleasures&quot; should be the rallying point against &quot;the deployment of sexuality&quot;, &quot;bodies and pleasures&quot;, like other Foucauldian terms, is a notion with &quot;little content.&quot; Whitebook, who endorsed Dews&#x27;s assessment of Foucault&#x27;s work, found Foucault&#x27;s views to be comparable to those of Marcuse and suggested that Foucault was indebted to Marcuse. In 2005, Scruton dismissed &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; as &quot;mendacious&quot;, and called his book &quot;Sexual Desire&quot; (1986) an answer to Foucault&#x27;s work. Romana Byrne criticized Foucault&#x27;s argument that the &quot;scientia sexualis&quot; belongs to modern Western culture while the &quot;ars erotica&quot; belongs only to Eastern and Ancient societies, arguing that a form of &quot;ars erotica&quot; has been evident in Western society since at least the eighteenth century.

Scruton wrote in 2015 that, contrary to Foucault&#x27;s claims, the ancient texts Foucault examines in &quot;The Use of Pleasure&quot; are not primarily about sexual pleasure. Nevertheless, he found the second two volumes of &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; more scholarly than Foucault&#x27;s previous work. Scruton concluded, of the work in general, that it creates an impression of a &quot;normalized&quot; Foucault: &quot;His command of the French language, his fascination with ancient texts and the by-ways of history, his flamboyant imagination and beautiful style – all have been put, at last, to a proper use, in order to describe the human condition respectfully, and to cease to look for the secret &#x27;structures&#x27; beneath its smile.&quot;

<text>Route 95 is a provincial highway in New Brunswick, which connects Interstate 95 (I-95) at the Houlton–Woodstock Border Crossing near Houlton, Maine, United States to New Brunswick Route 2 (the Trans-Canada Highway) in Woodstock, New Brunswick, Canada.

Prior to the construction of Route 95, the connection between the two cities was served by Route 5. In 2007 the New Brunswick government completed a roadworks project to turn Route 95 into a full freeway for its entire length.

==Route description==
Route 95 begins at the Houlton–Woodstock Border Crossing on the Maine–New Brunswick border as an extension of I-95. The border between the two countries also marks the border between the Eastern Time Zone and the Atlantic Time Zone. The highway travels northeast through woodlands as it approaches its first interchange with Route 540 via a hybrid diamond interchange/partial cloverleaf interchange, providing access to the towns of Richmond Corner and Belleville. Continuing east, the highway crosses over Plymouth Road before intersecting an eastbound exit for Vivglenn Road, which connects to Route 555. The final exit on the highway is a trumpet interchange with Route 2, which is the main route of the Trans-Canada Highway through the province, in Woodstock.

== History ==
A road linking Houlton to Woodstock has existed since at least 1927. It was numbered Route 5 in 1938. 

In 1951, this designation was removed. The current Route 95 was constructed in the late 1970s and numbered Route 95 by 1981. The new highway bypassed the original alignment of Route 5, which is now numbered Route 555. By 1989, the intersection between Route 95 and Route 2 was converted into an interchange. In 2007, the New Brunswick Department of Transportation completed a 33 million construction project, turning Route 95 from a two-lane undivided highway to a grade-separated four lane freeway. The Province has contracted with Brun-Way Highway Operations to provide maintenance for the highway until 2023.

<doc id="478441" wikidata="Q852077" url="?curid=478441" title="Burgred of Mercia">
<text>Burgred (also Burhred or Burghred; Old English: &quot;Burhræd&quot;) was an Anglo-Saxon king of Mercia from 852 to 874.

==Family==
Burgred became king of Mercia in 852, and may have been related to his predecessor Beorhtwulf. After Easter in 853, Burgred married Æthelswith, daughter of Æthelwulf, king of the West Saxons. The marriage was celebrated at the royal villa of Chippenham in Wessex.

==Life==

In 853 Burgred sent messengers to Æthelwulf, king of the West Saxons, seeking his help to subjugate the Welsh, who lived between Mercia and the western sea, as they were rebelling against his rule. Immediately King Æthelwulf advanced with Burgred against the Welsh, and successfully repressed the rebellion.

Twelve years after Burgred&#x27;s success against the Welsh, in 865, the Great Heathen Army arrived. Following its successful campaigns against East Anglia and Northumbria it advanced through Mercia, arriving in Nottingham in 867. Burgred then appealed to his brothers-in-law King Æthelred of Wessex and Alfred for assistance against them. The armies of Wessex and Mercia did no serious fighting as Burgred paid the invaders off. In 874 the march of the Vikings from Lindsey to Repton drove Burgred from his kingdom.

After Burgred left, the Vikings appointed a Mercian Ceolwulf to replace him, demanding oaths of loyalty to them. Burgred retired to Rome and died there. He was buried, according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, &quot;in the church of Sancta Maria, in the school of the English nation&quot; (now Santo Spirito in Sassia) in Rome.

Single coins from the reign of Burgred continue to be found but Burgred coins within hoards are less common. In 1998 a hoard with Burgred coins was found by the Birmingham University Field Archaeology Unit near Banbury Castle.

<doc id="478443" wikidata="Q58422" url="?curid=478443" title="Tangshan">
<text>Tangshan () is a coastal, industrial prefecture-level city in the northeast of Hebei province. It is located in the eastern part of Hebei Province and the northeastern part of the North China Plain. It is located in the central area of the Bohai Rim and serves as the main traffic corridor to the Northeast. The city faces the Bohai Sea in the south, the Yan Mountains in the north, Qinhuangdao across the Luan River to the east, and Tianjin to the west.

Much of the city&#x27;s development is thanks to the industrialization, beginning in 1870, when Kailuan Group established coal mines in the region. It&#x27;s the birthplace of China&#x27;s first standard-gauge railway, the first railway plant, the first steam locomotive, and the first cement factory. It was hailed as China&#x27;s &quot;cradle of industrialization&quot;. Even today, Tangshan is a hub of steel, energy, chemical, and ceramics production. Ping opera, which originated from the city&#x27;s Luanzhou county, is one of the five most popular Chinese operas.

The city has also become known for an earthquake in 1976 which measured 7.8 on the Richter scale. It flattened much of the city and killed at least 255,000 residents according to official estimates. The city has since been rebuilt, has become a tourist attraction, and is among the 10 largest ports in China.

The city of Tangshan is approximately east by south east of Beijing and northwest of Tianjin. Tangshan&#x27;s prefecture population was 7,717,983 at the 2020 census, with 3,687,607 in the built-up (&quot;or metro&quot;) area made of the 7 urban core districts.

==Etymology==
Tangshan is named after Dacheng Hill (), which was formerly called Mount Tang (唐山) and is located in the middle of the city.

In A.D. 645, Li Shimin, an emperor of Tang dynasty and his army were stationed at Dacheng Hill on his way back from the Korean Peninsula. Unfortunately, Caofei, his beloved concubine, died there. In order to commemorate her, he named the mountain after the name of the empire, Tang. Later, the city took the name of the mountain.

==History==

===Early history===
Tangshan has a long history, with ancient humans living in the area as early as 4,000 years ago. It fell within the territory of the Guzhu Kingdom (1600BC) at the time of the Shang dynasty and later became a part of the State of Yan, one of the seven Warring States (403221BC). During the Han dynasty (206BC220AD) it became part of the ancient province of Youzhou. It was under the jurisdiction of Zhili province and Zunhua State successively during the Qing dynasty.

===Tang, Ming and Qing dynasties===
Tangshan was a village at the time of the Tang dynasty (619907) and developed further in agriculture, oil exploitation and ceramics during the Ming dynasty (13681644).

During the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform in the late Qing dynasty, the Kaiping Mining Administration was established in the third year of the Guangxu Emperor (1877). In 1878, Qiaotun town was established at Tangshan and renamed Tangshan Town in 1889. In 1938, Tangshan City was formally founded. The administrative system of Tangshan during the Republic of China Republican era continued to follow the Qing system. In 1929, Zhili Province changed its name to Hebei Province. On January28, 1939, because of Tangshan&#x27;s special economic and political position, the East Hebei Autonomous Government established Tangshan City which was initially called “Tangshan Municipal Government” and later changed to “Tangshan Municipal Office”. After Japan surrendered in 1945, the Chinese Nationalist Party in Peking (now known as Beijing) took over the political control of Tangshan from Japan and set up an Administration Inspectors Office. In April 1946, it was decided at the 132nd Meeting of the Chinese Communist Party Hebei Provincial Committee to set up Tangshan City and on May5 of the same year, the Tangshan Municipal government was founded.

===People&#x27;s Republic===
After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on October1, 1949, Tangshan remained a provincially administered municipality with 12 areas under its jurisdiction.
In March 1955, it was decided at the 2nd session of the first People&#x27;s Congress of Tangshan City to change Tangshan Municipal people&#x27;s government to Tangshan people&#x27;s committee without changing its administration areas.

On April28, 1958, the State Council approved the establishment of Tangshan prefecture. On August29, 1958, it was decided at the Seventh Session of the first People&#x27;s Congress of Hebei Province to move the Tangshan Commissioner Office from Changli County to Tangshan City.

The CPC Central Committee decided to designate Tangshan city as one of the 45 cities open to the world on June3, 1959. On June 8, 1959, the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee and the Hebei Provincial People&#x27;s Congress decided to combine the Tangshan Commissioners Office and the Tangshan People&#x27;s Committee into the Tangshan People&#x27;s Committee. On April2, 1960, the State Council officially approved the abolition of Tangshan prefecture. Qinhuangdao city, Qian&#x27;an, Changli, Laoting, Baodi, Yutian, Jixian County and Zunhua which were formerly administered by Tangshan Prefecture were incorporated into the Tangshan Municipality. Luanxian County, Fengrun County (formerly a district) and Baigezhuang Farm were also incorporated into Tangshan Municipality. Meanwhile, Tangshan became a provincially administered municipality.

On May23, 1961, the State Council approved the reinstatement of Tangshan prefecture, which was adopted at the 14th Meeting of the Hebei Provincial People&#x27;s Committee on June3, 1959. Tangshan prefecture and Tangshan municipality were separated again and Tangshan turned into a specially administered municipality.

The Tangshan Municipal Revolutionary Committee affiliated to the Revolutionary Committee of Tangshan Region was set up on January6, 1968. On March 11, 1978, Tangshan turned to be a provincially administered municipality.

In October 1982, it was decided at the Seventh People&#x27;s Congress of Tangshan city to abolish the Tangshan Municipal Revolutionary Committee and set up the Tangshan Municipal People&#x27;s Government.

The State Council approved the move on March 3, 1983, and thereafter implemented the city-governing-county system. On May13, 1983, the Hebei Provincial People&#x27;s Government announced the cancellation of the Civic Administration office of Tangshan region, which ceased operation on May15, 1983.

On December15, 1984, the State Council approved Tangshan city as one of 13 national “comparatively big” cities.

===1976 Tangshan earthquake===

Tangshan suffered an earthquake of magnitude 7.8 (7.5 according to official reports) at 3:42am on July28, 1976, which resulted in many casualties. The official death toll was 255,000, but many experts believe that the actual number of fatalities was two to three times that number, making it the most destructive earthquake in modern history. As a result of the earthquake, most of the town had to be rebuilt. The earthquake was depicted in the 2010 movie &quot;Aftershock&quot;.

==Geography==
Tangshan is located in the central section of the Bohai Economic Rim, facing the Bohai Sea to the south. Lying on the North China Plain, Tangshan is adjacent to the Yan Mountains to the north, borders the Luan River and Qinhuangdao to the east, and to the west and southwest borders Tianjin. Because of its location in the northeast of Hebei, it is a strategic area and a corridor linking two China&#x27;s north and northeast regions. The largest river in the prefecture is the Luan River.

===Climate===
Tangshan has a monsoon-influenced, humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;), with cold and very dry winters, and hot, rainy summers. Spring and autumn are short with some rainfall. The monthly 24-hour average temperature in January is , and in July, and the annual mean is . Close to 60% of the annual precipitation of falls in July and August alone. The frost-free period lasts 180−190 days, and the area receives 2,600−2,900 hours of sunshine annually.

===Air pollution===

As air pollution in China has worsened in recent years, reports suggest cities in Hebei among the most polluted in the country, with Tangshan being no exception. According to a survey made by &quot;Global voices China&quot; in February 2013, 7 cities in Hebei including Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Handan, Langfang, Hengshui and Tangshan, are among China&#x27;s 10 most polluted cities.

==Economy==

Tangshan is an important heavy industrial city in North China. Its output include machinery, motor vehicles, chemicals, textiles, glass, petroleum products, and cement. It has been a coal-mining center since late Qing dynasty, as Guangdong merchant Tong King-sing opened the first coal mine using modern techniques in Kaiping in 1877. Since the construction of the Caofeidian Project, it has hosted large iron and steel plants, chemical projects, and electricity plants. It is China&#x27;s largest steel-producing city. Tangshan is also called the &quot;porcelain capital of North China.&quot;

Modern industry in China first arose in Tangshan. The second railway in Chinaafter the abortive Woosung Railway in Shanghaiwas the six-mile track laid between Hsukochuang and Tangshan which opened in 1881; this eventually grew into the Imperial Railroad of North China and China&#x27;s modern Jingshan and Jingha Railways. The first fire-resistant material manufactory and the first and largest cement manufactory were constructed in Tangshan as well.

Tangshan has experienced near-constant GDP growth in recent years, but has slowed down in the latter-half of the 2010s. In 2008, the GDP of Tangshan was ¥353.747 billion, which nearly doubled to ¥612.121 billion by 2013, and grew further to ¥695.500 billion in 2018. Tangshan&#x27;s GDP was ranked the 26th largest among Chinese cities according to data from 2017. The city&#x27;s exports were valued at $7.109 billion in 2016. Government figures for 2017 show that the city&#x27;s economy was largely dominated by the secondary industry, contributing ¥408.14 billion to the city&#x27;s economy.

<doc id="478453" wikidata="Q3182402" url="?curid=478453" title="Tone contour">
<text>A tone contour or contour tone is a tone in a tonal language which shifts from one pitch to another over the course of the syllable or word. Tone contours are especially common in East Asia, Southeast Asia, West Africa, Nilo-Saharan languages, Khoisan languages, Oto-Manguean languages and some languages of South America.

==Contours==

When the pitch descends, the contour is called a &quot;falling tone;&quot; when it ascends, a &quot;rising tone;&quot; when it descends and then returns, a &quot;dipping&quot; or &quot;falling-rising tone;&quot; and when it ascends and then returns, it is called a &quot;peaking&quot; or &quot;rising-falling tone.&quot; A tone in a contour-tone language which remains at approximately an even pitch is called a &quot;level tone.&quot; Tones which are too short to exhibit much of a contour, typically because of a final plosive consonant, may be called &quot;checked, abrupt, clipped,&quot; or &quot;stopped tones.&quot;

It has been theorized that the relative timing of a contour tone is not distinctive. That is, in some accents or languages a falling tone might fall at the end and in others it might fall at the beginning, but that such differences would not be distinctive. However, in Dinka it is reported that the phonemic falling tone falls late (impressionistically high level + fall, ) while the falling allophone of the low tone starts early (impressionistically fall + low level, ).

Lexical tones more complex than dipping (falling–rising) or peaking (rising–falling) are quite rare, perhaps nonexistent, though prosody may produce such effects. The Old Xiang dialect of Qiyang is reported to have two &quot;double contour&quot; lexical tones, high and low fall–rise–fall, or perhaps high falling – low falling and low falling – high falling: and (4232 and 2142). The report did not determine if the final fall was lexical or merely the declination typically seen at the ends of prosodic units, so these may actually be dipping tones.

==Transcription==
*Diacritics such as falling , rising , dipping , peaking , high falling , low falling , high rising and low rising . Or the simpler &quot;register tones,&quot; where diacritics such as high , mid , and low are usually sufficient for transcription. (These are also used for high, mid, and low level contour tones.)
*Tone letters such as mid level , high falling , low falling , mid rising , low rising , dipping , and peaking .
*Numerical substitutions for tone letters. The seven tones above would be written , , , , , , , for an Asian language, or , , , , , , , for an African or American language. (The doubling of the numeral in in the Asian example is used to disambiguate a mid level tone from a &quot;tone 3&quot; (3rd tone), which in general is not at pitch level 3.)
*Different spelling for the same vowel with different tones in systems like Latinxua Sin Wenz, Gwoyeu Romatzyh, Modern Literal Taiwanese etc. Compare Gwoyeu Romatzyh with Hanyu Pinyin (in parentheses): bai (bāi), bair (bái), bae (bǎi), bay (bài).

<text>Claymation, sometimes called clay animation or plasticine animation, is one of many forms of stop-motion animation. Each animated piece, either character or background, is &quot;deformable&quot;—made of a malleable substance, usually plasticine clay.

Traditional animation, from cel animation to stop motion, is produced by recording each frame, or still picture, on film or digital media and then playing the recorded frames back in rapid succession before the viewer. These and other moving images, from zoetrope to films and video games, create the illusion of motion by playing back at over ten to twelve frames per second.

==Technique==
Each object or character is sculpted from clay or other such similarly pliable material as plasticine, usually around a wire skeleton, called an armature, and then arranged on the set, where it is photographed once before being slightly moved by hand to prepare it for the next shot, and so on until the animator has achieved the desired amount of film. Upon playback, the viewer perceives the series of slightly changing, rapidly succeeding images as motion.

A consistent shooting environment is needed to maintain the illusion of continuity: objects must be consistently placed and lit.

==Production==
Producing a stop-motion animation using clay is extremely laborious. Normal film runs at 24 frames per second (frame/s). With the standard practice of &quot;doubles&quot; or &quot;twos&quot; (double-framing, exposing two frames for each shot), 12 changes are usually made for one second of film movement. Shooting a 30-minute movie would therefore require making approximately 21,600 stops to change the figures for the frames; a full-length (90-minute) movie, 64,800—and possibly many more if some parts were shot with &quot;singles&quot; or &quot;ones&quot; (one frame exposed for each shot).

The object must not be altered by accident, slight smudges, dirt, hair, or dust. Feature-length productions have generally switched from clay to rubber silicone and resin cast components: Will Vinton has dubbed one foam-rubber process &quot;Foamation&quot;. Nevertheless, clay remains a viable animation material where a particular aesthetic is desired.

==Types==
Claymation can take several forms:

&quot;Freeform&quot; claymation is an informal term referring to the process in which the shape of the clay changes radically as the animation progresses, such as in the work of Eli Noyes and Ivan Stang&#x27;s animated films. Clay can also take the form of &quot;character&quot; claymation, where the clay maintains a recognizable character throughout a shot, as in Art Clokey&#x27;s and Will Vinton&#x27;s films.

One variation of claymation is strata-cut animation, in which a long bread-like loaf of clay, internally packed tight and loaded with varying imagery, is sliced into thin sheets, with the camera taking a frame of the end of the loaf for each cut, eventually revealing the movement of the internal images within. Pioneered in both clay and blocks of wax by German animator Oskar Fischinger during the 1920s and 1930s, the technique was revived and highly refined in the mid-1990s by David Daniels, an associate of Will Vinton, in his 16-minute short film &quot;Buzz Box&quot;.

Another clay-animation technique, one that blurs the distinction between stop motion and traditional flat animation, is called clay painting (also a variation of the direct manipulation animation process), wherein clay is placed on a flat surface and moved like wet oil paints (as on a traditional artist&#x27;s canvas) to produce any style of images, but with a clay look to them.

A sub variation claymation can be informally called &quot;clay melting&quot;. Any kind of heat source can be applied on or near (or below) clay to cause it to melt while an animation camera on a time-lapse setting slowly films the process. For example, consider Vinton&#x27;s early short clay-animated film &quot;Closed Mondays&quot; (co produced by animator Bob Gardiner) at the end of the computer sequence. A similar technique was used in the climax scene of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; to &quot;melt&quot; the face of one of the antagonists.

The term &quot;hot set&quot; is used amongst animators during production. It refers to a set where an animator is filming. The clay characters are set in a perfect position where they can continue shooting where they left off. If an animator calls his set a &quot;hot set,&quot; then no one is allowed to touch the set or else the shoot would be ruined. Certain scenes must be shot rather quickly. If a scene is left unfinished and the weather is perhaps humid, then the set and characters have an obvious difference. The clay puppets may be deformed from the humidity or the air pressure could have caused the set to shift slightly. These small differences can create an obvious flaw to the scene. To avoid these disasters, scenes normally have to be shot in one day or less.

==History==
William Harbutt developed plasticine in 1897. To promote his educational &quot;Plastic Method&quot; he made a handbook that included several photographs that displayed various stages of creative projects. The images suggest phases of motion or change, but the book probably did not have a direct influence on claymation films. Still, the plasticine product would become the favourite product for clay animators, as it did not dry and harden (unlike normal clay) and was much more malleable than its harder and greasier Italian predecessor plasteline.

Edwin S. Porter&#x27;s &quot;Fun in a Bakery Shop&quot; (1902) shows a single shot of a baker quickly transforming a patch of dough into different faces. It reflects the vaudeville type of &quot;lightning sketches&quot; that J. Stuart Blackton filmed in &quot;The Enchanted Drawing&quot; (1902) with the addition of stop tricks, and with early cinematic animation in &quot;Humorous Phases of Funny Faces&quot; (1906). A similar form of &quot;lightning sculpting&quot; had been performed live on stage around the turn of the century.

Segundo de Chomón&#x27;s &quot;Sculpteur Moderne&quot; was released on 31 January 1908 and features heaps of clay molding themselves into detailed sculptures that are capable of minor movements. The final sculpture depicts an old woman and walks around before it&#x27;s picked up, squashed and molded back into a sitting old lady. On 15 February 1908, Porter released the trick film &quot;A Sculptor&#x27;s Welsh Rabbit Dream&quot; that featured clay molding itself into three complete busts. No copy of the film has yet been located. It was soon followed by the similar extant film &quot;The Sculptor&#x27;s Nightmare&quot; (6 May 1908), directed by Wallace McCutcheon Sr. and photographed by Billy Bitzer with cameo appearances of D.W. Griffith and Mack Sennett. The busts are also animated to blink, speak, drink and turn left and right for a short sequence.

J. Stuart Blackton&#x27;s &quot;Chew Chew Land; or, The Adventures of Dolly and Jim&quot; (1910) features primitive claymation in chewing-gum inspired dream scenes.

Walter R. Booth&#x27;s &quot;Animated Putty&quot; (1911) featured clay molding itself into different shapes.

Willie Hopkins produced over fifty clay-animated segments entitled &quot;Miracles in Mud&quot; for the weekly &quot;Universal Screen Magazine&quot; from 1916 to 1918. He also made artistic modeled titles for the movie &quot;Everywoman&quot; (1919).

New York artist Helena Smith Dayton, possibly the first female animator, had much success with her &quot;Caricatypes&quot; clay statuettes before she began experimenting with claymation. Some of her first resulting short films were screened on 25 March 1917. She released an adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; circa half a year later. Although the films and her technique received much attention from the press, it seems she did not continue making films after she returned to New York from managing a YMCA in Paris around 1918. None of her films have yet surfaced, but the extant magazine articles have provided several stills and circa 20 poorly printed frames from two film strips.

By the 1920s, drawn animation using either cels or the slash system was firmly established in the U.S. as the dominant mode of animation production. Increasingly, three-dimensional forms such as clay were driven into relative obscurity as the cel method became the preferred method for the studio cartoon. Cel animation can be more easily divided into small tasks performed by many workers, like an assembly line.

In 1921, claymation appeared in a short sequence in the &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; episode &quot;Modeling&quot;, a film from the newly formed Fleischer Brothers studio. &quot;Modeling&quot; included animated clay in eight shots, a novel integration of the technique into an existing cartoon series and one of the rare uses of claymation in a theatrical short from the 1920s.

The oldest known extant claymation film (with claymation as its main production method) is &quot;Long Live the Bull&quot; (1926) by Joseph Sunn.

Art Clokey&#x27;s short student film &quot;Gumbasia&quot; (1955) featured all kinds of clay objects changing shape and moving to a jazz tune. He also created the iconic character Gumby that would feature in segments in &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; in 1955 and 1956, and afterwards got his own television series (1957-1969, 1987-1989) and a theatrical film (1995). Clokey also produced &quot;Davey and Goliath&quot; (1960–2004) for the United Lutheran Church in America.

Claymation has been popularized on television in children&#x27;s shows such as &quot;Mio Mao&quot; (1970-1976, 2002-2007 - Italy), &quot;The Red and the Blue&quot; (1976 - Italy) and &quot;Pingu&quot; (1990-2000 - Switzerland, 2003-2006 - U.K.)

In 1972, at Marc Chinoy&#x27;s Cineplast Films Studio in Munich, Germany, André Roche created a set of clay-animated German-language-instruction films (for non-German-speaking children) called &quot;Kli-Kla-Klawitter&quot; for the Second German TV-Channel; and another one for a traffic education series, &quot;Herr Daniel paßt auf&quot; (&quot;Mr. Daniel Pays Attention&quot;).
Aardman Animations was founded in 1972. In its early years, the studio mainly produced segments for television shows, with for instance the popular character Morph (appearing since 1977).

Claymation has been used in Academy Award-winning short films such as &quot;Closed Mondays&quot; (Will Vinton and Bob Gardiner, 1974) and &quot;The Sand Castle&quot; (1977).

Pioneering the clay painting technique was one-time Will Vinton Studios animator Joan Gratz, first in her Oscar-nominated film &quot;The Creation&quot; (1980), and then in her Oscar-winning &quot;Mona Lisa Descending a Staircase&quot;, filmed in 1992. Another Vinton animator, Craig Bartlett, developed a technique in which he not only used clay painting but sometimes built up clay images that rose off the plane of the flat support platform toward the camera lens to give a more 3-D stop-motion look to his Hey Arnold! films.

Nick Park joined Aardman in 1985. Early in his career, he and Aardman helped make the award-winning animated video for Peter Gabriel&#x27;s song &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; in 1986. Park would become the most successful claymation director, receiving a total of six Academy Award nominations and winning four with &quot;Creature Comforts&quot; (1989) (the first Wallace and Gromit film &quot;A Grand Day Out&quot; was also nominated), &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot; (1993), &quot;A Close Shave&quot; (1995) and &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot; (2005). &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot; spin-off &quot;Shaun the Sheep&quot; has also proved hugely successful with long-running television series (since 2007), theatrical movies and its own spin-off &quot;Timmy Time&quot; (since 2009).

Aardman&#x27;s &quot;Chicken Run&quot; (2000) became the highest-grossing stop motion animated film in history.

Aardman&#x27;s &quot;Flushed Away&quot; is a CGI replication of claymation.

Alexander Tatarsky managed to get work at Multtelefilm division of Studio Ekran with the help of Eduard Uspensky who wrote the screenplay for Tatarsky&#x27;s first director&#x27;s effort — &quot;Plasticine Crow&quot; (1981), which also happened to be Soviet first claymation film. After the enormous success Tatarsky was offered to create new opening and closing sequences for the popular children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Good Night, Little Ones!&quot; also made of plasticine; they were later included into the Guinness Book of Records by the number of broadcasts. It was followed by two other claymation shorts: &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve Song by Ded Moroz&quot; (1982) and &quot;Last Year&#x27;s Snow Was Falling&quot; (1983). 

Garri Bardin directed several claymation comedy films, including &quot;Break!&quot;, a parody on a boxing match for which Bardin received a Golden Dove award at the 1986 Dok Leipzig.

Television commercials have utilized claymation, spawning for instance &quot;The California Raisins&quot; (1986-1998, Vinton Studios) and the Chevron Cars ads (Aardman).

&quot;The PJs&quot; (1999–2001) was a sitcom featuring the voice of Eddie Murphy, produced by Murphy in collaboration with Ron Howard, the Will Vinton Studios and others.

Many independent young filmmakers have published claymations online, on such sites as Newgrounds.

More adult-oriented claymation shows have been broadcast on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim lineup, including &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; (which uses claymation and action figures as stop-motion puppets in conjunction) and &quot;Moral Orel.&quot; Nickelodeon&#x27;s Nick at Nite later developed their own adult show, &quot;Glenn Martin, DDS&quot; (2009-2011).

Several computer games have been produced using claymation, including &quot;The Neverhood&quot;, &quot;ClayFighter&quot;, &quot;Platypus&quot;, Clay Moon (iPhone app), and &quot;Primal Rage&quot;. The surrealist role-playing video games &quot;Hylics&quot; (2015) and &quot;Hylics 2&quot; (2020) both utilize claymation to achieve a distinctive visual style. Probably the most spectacular use of model animation for a computer game was for the Virgin Interactive Entertainment Mythos game &quot;Magic and Mayhem&quot; (1998), for which stop-motion animator and special-effects expert Alan Friswell constructed over 25 monsters and mythological characters utilising both modelling clay and latex rubber, over wire and ball-and-socket skeletons, much like the designs of Willis O&#x27;Brien and Ray Harryhausen.

<doc id="478462" wikidata="Q382028" url="?curid=478462" title="Moriteru Ueshiba">
<text>is a Japanese master of aikido. He is a grandson of Morihei Ueshiba, founder of aikido, and son of Kisshomaru Ueshiba. Ueshiba is the third and current &quot;Dōshu&quot; (hereditary head) of the Aikikai.

==Biography==
Ueshiba was born on April 2, 1951, in Tokyo, Japan. Recalling his childhood during a 2004 interview, he said, &quot;The first time I wore an Aikido uniform I was in the first grade of elementary school. But my family didn’t force me to do &quot;keiko&quot; (training) then, I just did it when I felt like it. I started training seriously in my high school years. My intention then was to become a successor to my father, and to preserve Kaiso’s [Morihei Ueshiba&#x27;s] legacy for the future.&quot;

In 1976, Ueshiba graduated from Meiji Gakuin University with a degree in economics. In 1996, he assumed the position of &quot;Dojocho&quot; (director/owner) of Aikikai Hombu Dojo. In 1997, he visited Ireland. He assumed the title of &quot;Dōshu&quot; on January 4, 1999, following the death of his father, Kisshomaru Ueshiba. In January 2006, as part of Aiki-Kai Australia&#x27;s 40th anniversary, Ueshiba visited and taught in Australia.

Ueshiba wrote the books &quot;Best Aikido: The fundamentals&quot; (2002, co-authored with his father Kisshomaru Ueshiba), &quot;The Aikido master course: Best Aikido 2&quot; (2003), and &quot;Progressive Aikido: The essential elements&quot; (2005).

Following the &quot;iemoto&quot; system, he is expected to be succeeded as &quot;Dōshu&quot; by his son Mitsuteru Ueshiba.

<text>Unst (; ) is one of the North Isles of the Shetland Islands, Scotland. It is the northernmost of the inhabited British Isles and is the third-largest island in Shetland after Mainland and Yell. It has an area of .

Unst is largely grassland, with coastal cliffs. Its main village is Baltasound, formerly the second-largest herring fishing port after Lerwick and now the location of a leisure centre and the island&#x27;s airport. Other settlements include Uyeasound, home to Greenwell&#x27;s Booth (a Hanseatic warehouse) and Muness Castle (built in 1598 and sacked by pirates in 1627); and Haroldswick, location of a boat museum and a heritage centre.

== Etymology ==
There are three island names in Shetland of unknown and possibly pre-Celtic origin: Unst, Fetlar and Yell. The earliest recorded forms of these three names do carry Norse meanings: is the plural of and means &#x27;shoulder-straps&#x27;, is &#x27;corn-stack&#x27; and is from meaning &#x27;deep furrow&#x27;.

However, these descriptions are hardly obvious ones as island names and are probably adaptations of a pre-Norse language. This may have been Pictish but there is no clear evidence for this. Taylor (1898) has suggested a derivation from the Old Norse meaning &#x27;eagle&#x27;s nest&#x27;.

== History ==
The Shetland Amenity Trust&#x27;s &quot;Viking Unst&quot; project excavated and displayed part of the island&#x27;s Norse heritage. Work was undertaken on three longhouses – of which 60 are known of on the island – at Hamar, Underhoull and Belmont. The replica Viking ship &quot;Skibladner&quot; can currently be seen ashore at Haroldswick.
The remains of pre-12th-century Christian chapels survive on Unst: St Olaf&#x27;s Chapel, Lund, and Our Lady&#x27;s Kirk at Framgord, Sandwick on the south east coast. Norse-style cross-shaped gravestones stand in the surrounding burial grounds at both Lund and Framgord, and rare &quot;keelstone&quot; burial markers survive at Framgord. Late Norse longhouses have been identified around both bays; the house at Sandwick still retains its cow-shaped byre door.
James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell sailed to Shetland after the Battle of Carberry Hill. He was at the house of Olave Sinclair, the receiver or sheriff of Shetland on Unst, in July 1567 when his enemies arrived in three ships, and he fought a sea battle for three hours before sailing to Norway. A later sheriff, Laurence Bruce, built Muness Castle in 1598.

The Rev Dr James Ingram (1776–1879) was minister of Unst from 1821. In the Disruption of 1843, he and most of the Unst population, left the established church and joined the Free Church of Scotland (a very typical pattern in the Highlands and Islands). He erected a new church at Uyeasound, funded by the Countess of Effingham. Ingram retired in 1875 aged 99 and died aged a remarkable 103. His father and grandfather also lived to over 100.

Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s father and uncle were the main design engineers for the lighthouse on Muckle Flugga, just off Hermaness on the north-west of the island. Stevenson visited Unst, and the island is claimed to have become the basis for the map of the fictional &quot;Treasure Island&quot; – a claim shared by Fidra in East Lothian.

In the 1950s, a Canadian sociologist, Erving Goffman, undertook a year of ethnographic research on Unst for his doctoral thesis, which underpinned his best known publication, &quot;The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life&quot; (1956) and the dramaturgy approach he developed.

== Geography and geology ==
The island lays claim to many &quot;most northerly&quot; UK titles: the tiny settlement of Skaw in the north-east of the island is the northernmost settlement in the UK; Haroldswick is the site of Britain&#x27;s most northerly church; the Muckle Flugga lighthouse, just off the far north of Unst, was opened in 1858 and is the most northerly lighthouse in the UK, situated close to Out Stack, the most northerly rock in the UK.

Western Norway is 200 miles (300 km) away.

The islands of Unst and Fetlar are mainly formed of ultramafic and mafic igneous rocks which are interpreted to form part of an ophiolite, a section of oceanic crust from the Iapetus ocean which was destroyed during the Caledonian orogeny.

Unst was once the location of several chromite quarries, one of which was served by the now-disused Hagdale Chromate Railway from 1907 to 1937. Unst is the type locality for the mineral theophrastite, a nickel-magnesium variant of the mineral, , having been discovered at Hagdale in 1960.

On 7 January 2007, Unst was shaken by an earthquake measuring 4.9 on the Richter scale, which at the time was assessed by the British Geological Survey as &quot;the largest earthquake of its kind in the area for 10 years&quot;.

== Economy and transport ==
Ferries link Belmont on the island to Gutcher on Yell and Oddsta on Fetlar.

The Unst Bus Shelter, also known as Bobby&#x27;s Bus Shelter after a child who saved it from removal, is a bus shelter and bus stop near the village of Baltasound which is equipped with home comforts such as a television set, and is maintained by local residents.

Unst is also home to the Promoting Unst Renewable Energy (PURE) Wind Hydrogen project, a community-owned clean energy system based on hydrogen production. This project is part of the Unst Partnership, the community&#x27;s development trust. The Pure Energy Centre was formed using the skills and knowledge gained during the PURE Project and has installed hydrogen systems in diverse locations.

At the southern end of Unst, above the island&#x27;s ferry terminal, stands Belmont House. Dating from 1775, Belmont has been described as &quot;possibly the most ambitious, least-altered classical mansion in the Northern Isles&quot;. It was restored between 1996 and 2010 by a charitable trust, who now operate the building as a venue for hire.

The island&#x27;s population was 632 as recorded by the 2011 census, a drop of over 12% since 2001 when there were 720 usual residents. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.

In 2016, the island was the subject of Series 11 of BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;An Island Parish&quot;.

The island has an airstrip, the Unst Airport, which has been decommissioned as an airport, has no regular flights and is only used for emergency flights.

=== Saxa Vord ===

Saxa Vord is the highest hill on Unst at . It holds the unofficial British record for wind speed, which in 1992 was recorded at — just before the measuring equipment blew away.

==== RAF Saxa Vord ====
The weather station which recorded the windspeed was part of Royal Air Force radar station RAF Saxa Vord, which temporarily closed in 2006, with the loss of more than 100 jobs.

In April 2007, RAF Saxa Vord&#x27;s domestic site, plus the road up to the Mid Site, was purchased and renamed &quot;Saxa Vord Resort&quot; by Highland entrepreneur Frank Strang. Strang&#x27;s company Military Asset Management (MAM) &quot;specialises in the regeneration of redundant or surplus Defence Assets&quot;. The base was converted to a tourist resort and natural and cultural heritage centre. In 2013, Saxa Vord had self-catering holiday houses, a 26-bedroom bunkhouse, restaurant and bar, leisure facilities and a guided walks/evening talks programme.
Three local businesses relocated their premises to the Saxa Vord site: Unst Cycle Hire, Valhalla Brewery and Foord&#x27;s Chocolates, Shetland&#x27;s only chocolatier.

A few years later the radar station resumed operations as Remote Radar Head Saxa Vord.

==== Saxa Vord distillery ====
is a gin and whisky distillery on Unst.

==== SaxaVord Spaceport ====
In 2017, Frank Strang established the Shetland Space Centre Ltd and proposed that Lamba Ness would make a suitable launch site for rockets taking satellites into polar orbits. In October 2020, the proposal was given more substance by the announcement that the UK Space Agency had given its approval and that Lockheed Martin was intending to use the site as a UK base for its rocket launches.

Despite its name, the location of &quot;SaxaVord Spaceport&quot; is near the easternmost point of Unst, several kilometers removed from Saxa Vord hill.

In January 2021, plans were submitted for three rocket launch pads and the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) announced on 17 December 2023 that SaxaVord had been granted a spaceport licence &quot;to host up to 30 launches a year&quot;, making it &quot;the first fully licensed vertical spaceport in Western Europe.&quot;

== Wildlife ==
Unst is important for its seabird colonies, including those at Hermaness National Nature Reserve. It is also known for its plant life, including the Norwegian sandwort and Shetland Mouse-ear, the latter unique to the island.

On the island, the commonly seen Great skua is known as the &quot;bonxie&quot;.

<text>Rice Village is a shopping district in Houston, Texas, United States.

Rice Village is a collection of shops, restaurants and pubs, situated about a half-mile west of the center of Rice University&#x27;s campus. The core &quot;Rice Village&quot; extends over several city blocks, bounded by University Boulevard, Kirby Drive, Tangley Street, Morningside Drive, Rice Boulevard, and Greenbriar Drive, though spillover has expanded the retail area to encompass businesses as far north as Bissonnet Street.

==History==

Rice Village began operations in 1938. It is an unplanned, high density hodge-podge of old and new retail stores.

David Kaplan of &quot;Cite&quot; wrote that during the 1950s and 1960s Rice Village &quot;filled up and prospered&quot; but the economic boom in Greater Houston in the 1970s caused development to come elsewhere. He credited the influx of young families in Southgate and Southampton in Houston and the City of West University Place, beginning in the 1980s, to revitalizing Rice Village.

In the mid-1980s Rice University began buying land in the Rice Village area. Scott Wise, the university&#x27;s vice president for investments, stated in 1996 that Rice Village is &quot;strategically located&quot; and allows possible growth and flexibility.

The first minutes of the 1994 film &quot;The Chase&quot; were filmed in the Rice Village.

==Cityscape==
The Village Arcade occupies an area bounded by Kirby Drive, Amherst, Morningside, and University. The development also occupies most of the block bounded by Kelvin, Amherst, Times, and Morningside.

==Business and shopping==
From its origins in the 1930s an ad hoc cluster of retail stores, the Rice Village has grown to become one of Houston&#x27;s shopping destinations. Host to over 300 shops in a 16-block area, Rice Village is known for its many small and eclectic shops and boutiques. Recent expansion in the area has also brought in high-end clothing stores and the nationwide retail venues. As Village retail became denser in the 1990s, limited parking finally led to the closure of Rice Food Market, the last surviving Rice Village grocery store. Residential real estate has recently re-entered the area with the opening of the Hanover Rice Village Luxury Apartments.

==Government==
Rice Village is a part of the West University Place Super Neighborhood Council.

Rice Village is in Texas&#x27;s 7th congressional district.

==Police service==
The neighborhood is within the Houston Police Department&#x27;s South Central Patrol Division.

==Education==
The complex is zoned to the following Houston ISD schools:
* Poe Elementary School
* Lanier Middle School
* Lamar High School

==Media==
In the mid-20th century the community newspaper &quot;Southwestern Times&quot; was headquartered in Rice Village.

<text>The Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus), also known as Barbary ape, is a macaque species native to the Atlas Mountains of Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco, along with a small introduced population in Gibraltar.
It is the type species of the genus &quot;Macaca&quot;. The species is of particular interest because males play an atypical role in rearing young. Because of uncertain paternity, males are integral to raising all infants. Generally, Barbary macaques of both sexes and all ages contribute in alloparental care of young.

The diet of the Barbary macaque consists primarily of plants and insects and they are found in a variety of habitats. Males live to around 25 years old while females may live up to 30 years. Besides humans, they are the only free-living primates in Europe. Although the species is commonly referred to as the &quot;Barbary ape&quot;, the Barbary macaque is a true monkey. Its name refers to the Barbary Coast of Northwest Africa.

The population of the Barbary macaques in Gibraltar is the only one outside Northern Africa and the only population of wild monkeys in Europe. Barbary macaques were once widely distributed in Europe, as far north as England, from the Early Pliocene (Zanclean) to the Late Pleistocene, as recently as 85-40,000 years ago. About 300 macaques live on the Rock of Gibraltar. This population appears to be stable or increasing, while the North African population is declining.

== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==

The Barbary macaque is first described in scientific literature by Aristotle in the fourth century BCE work &quot;History of Animals&quot;. He writes of an ape with &quot;arms like a man, only covered with hair&quot;, &quot;feet [which] are exceptional in kind ... like large hands&quot;, and &quot;a tail as small as small can be, just a sort of indication of a tail&quot;. It is likely that Galen (129–c.216) dissected the Barbary macaque in the second century CE, presuming the internal structure to be the same as a human. Such was the authority of his work, some mistakes he made were not corrected until Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) proved otherwise over a thousand years later. The Barbary macaque was included in the grouping &quot;Simia&quot; by Conrad Gessner in his 1551 work &quot;Historia Animalium&quot;, a name which he claimed was already in use by the Greeks. Gessner&#x27;s &quot;Simia&quot; was subsequently used as one of Carl Linnaeus&#x27; four primate genera when he published &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1758. Linnaeus proposed the scientific name &quot;Simia sylvanus&quot; for the Barbary macaque. During the next 150 years primate taxonomy was subject to great changes and the Barbary macaque was placed in over thirty different taxa. The confusion over the use of &quot;Simia&quot; became so great that the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) suppressed its use in 1929. This meant the Barbary macaque was placed in the next oldest genus assigned to it, &quot;Macaca&quot;, described by Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799.

=== Phylogeny ===
The Barbary macaque is the most basal macaque species. Phylogenetic and molecular analyses show it is a sister group to all Asian macaque species. The results of a phylogenetic analysis show that the chromosomes of Barbary macaque resemble those of the rhesus macaque with the exception of chromosomes 1, 4, 9, and 16. It was also discovered that chromosome 18 in the Barbary macaque is homologous to chromosome 13 in humans.

Polymerase chain reaction studies have found &quot;Alu&quot; element&quot; insertions, small pieces of genetic code in genomes, can infer primate phylogenetic relationships. Using this method the phylogenetic relationship of ten species within the genus &quot;Macaca&quot; has been resolved, showing the Barbary macaque to be a sister group to all other macaques.
=== Fossil record ===
Barbary macaque fossils have been found across Europe, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Black Sea, dating from the Early Pliocene to the Late Pleistocene, assigned to various subspecies including &quot;M. s. sylvanus&quot;, &quot;M. s. pliocena&quot; and &quot;M. s. florentina.&quot; The insular dwarf &quot;M. majori&quot; endemic to Sardinia-Corsica during the Early Pleistocene, usually considered to have derived from &quot;M. sylvanus&quot;, is generally considered a distinct species. Remains from Norfolk, England, dating to the Middle Pleistocene, at 53 degrees latitude, are amongst the northernmost records of non-human primates. Archaic humans and Barbary macaques co-occur at numerous sites, and it is possible they may have used Barbary macaques as a source of food. The youngest known remains of Barbary macaques in Europe are from Hunas in Bavaria, Germany, dated to 85,000–40,000 years ago. The distribution of Barbary macaques in Europe was likely strongly controlled by climate, only extending into Northern Europe during interglacial intervals, while they were restricted to more southerly regions during colder glacial phases. Disappearance of macaques from Europe may have been caused by human activity.

Fossils of &quot;Macaca sylvanus&quot; are known from the Plio-Pleistocene Guefaït-4.2 site in Morocco, where paired δ13C and δ18O measurements indicate that the macaque consumed primarily the fresh fruits and leaves of C3 plants.

== Description ==


The Barbary macaque has a dark pink face with a pale buff to golden brown to grey pelage and a lighter underside. The colour of mature adults changes with ages. In adults and subadults the fur on the back is variegated pale and dark which is due to banding on individual hairs. In spring to early summer, as the temperatures rise, the adult macaques moult their thick winter fur. The species shows sexual dimorphism with males larger than females. The mean head-body length is in females and in males. The boneless vestigial tail is greatly reduced compared with other macaque species and, if not absent, measures . Males may have a more prominent tail, though data is scarce. The average body weight is in females and in males.

Like all Old World monkeys, the Barbary macaque has well-developed sitting pads (ischial callosities) on its rear. Females exhibit an exaggerated anogenital swelling, which increases in size during oestrus. It has cheek pouches and high-crowned bilophodont molars (molars with two ridges); the third molar is elongated. The diploid chromosome number of the Barbary macaque is 42, like other members of the Old World monkey tribe Papionini.

== Distribution and habitat ==

Historically, the Barbary macaque occurred across North Africa from Libya to Morocco. It is the only primate in Africa that survives north of the Sahara Desert. It lives mainly in fragmented areas of the Rif and the Middle and High Atlas mountain ranges in Morocco and the Grande and Petite Kabylie mountain region in Algeria. It has been recorded at elevations of , though it seems to prefer higher elevations. The Moroccan and Algerian populations are around apart, although the gap was smaller during the Holocene.

The Barbary macaque also occurs in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar at the southern tip of Europe&#x27;s Iberian Peninsula. Gibraltar historian Alonso Hernández del Portillo noted in the early 17th century that the macaques had been present &quot;from time immemorial&quot;. Most likely, the Moors introduced macaques from North Africa to Gibraltar during the Middle Ages. During World War II, Winston Churchill ordered for more Barbary macaques to be introduced to Gibraltar to reverse population declines. Today, there are around 300 Barbary macaques in Gibraltar.

It can live in a variety of habitats, such as cedar, fir, and oak forests, grasslands, thermophilous scrub, and rocky ridges full of vegetation in Mediterranean climate with seasonal extremes of temperature. In Morocco, most Barbary macaques inhabit Atlas cedar (&quot;Cedrus atlantica&quot;) forests, but this could reflect the present habitat availability rather than a specific preference for this habitat. In Algeria, the Barbary macaque inhabits mainly Grande and Petite Kabylia, ranges that form part of the Tell Atlas mountain chain, but there is also an isolated population in Chréa National Park. It lives in mixed cedar and holm oak forests, humid Portuguese and cork oak forests, and scrub-covered gorges.

Fossil evidence indicates that the Barbary macaque occurred in southern Europe during the Pleistocene and during interglacial periods also in England. A Tunisian population was mentioned in the works of ancient Greek writer Herodotus, indicating the species has become extinct there within the last 2,500 years.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The Barbary macaque is gregarious, forming mixed groups of several females and males. Troops can have 10 to 100 individuals and are matriarchal, with their hierarchy determined by lineage to the lead female. Unlike other macaques, the males participate in rearing the young. Males may spend a considerable amount of time playing with and grooming infants. In this way, a strong social bond is formed between males and juveniles, both the male&#x27;s own offspring and those of others in the troop. This may be a result of selectivity on the part of the females, who may prefer highly parental males.

The mating season runs from November through March. The gestation period is 147 to 192 days, and females usually have only one offspring per pregnancy. Females rear twins in rare instances. Offspring reach maturity at three to four years of age, and may live for 20 years or more.

Grooming other Barbary macaques leads to lower stress levels for the individuals that do the grooming. While stress levels do not appear to be reduced in animals that are groomed, grooming more individuals leads to even lower stress levels; this is a benefit that might outweigh the costs to the groomer, which include less time to participate in other activities such as foraging. The mechanism for reducing stress may be explained by the social relationships (and support) that are formed by grooming.

Male Barbary macaques interfere in conflicts and form coalitions with other males, usually with related males rather than with unrelated males. These relationships suggest that males do so in order to indirectly increase their own fitness. Furthermore, males form coalitions with closely related kin more often than they do with distantly related kin. These coalitions are not permanent and may change frequently as male ranking within the group changes. Although males are more likely to form coalitions with males who have helped them in the past, this is not as important as relatedness in determining coalitions. Males avoid conflicting with higher ranking males and will more frequently form coalitions with the higher ranking male in a conflict. Close grouping of males occur when infant Barbary macaques are present. Interactions between males are commonly initiated when a male presents an infant macaque to an adult male who is not caring for an infant, or when an unattached male approaches males who are caring for infants. This behaviour leads to a type of social buffering, which reduces the number of antagonistic interactions among males in a group.

An open mouth display by the Barbary macaque is used most commonly by juvenile macaques as a sign of playfulness.

===Alarm calls===
The main purpose of calls in Barbary macaques is to alert other group members to possible dangers such as predators. Barbary macaques can discriminate calls by individuals in their own group from those by individuals in other groups of conspecific macaques. Neither genetic variation nor habitat differences are likely causes of acoustic variation in the calls of different social groups. Instead, minor variations in acoustic structure among groups similar to the vocal accommodation seen in humans are the likely cause. However, acoustic characteristics such as pitch and loudness are varied based on the vocalizations of individuals they associate with, and social situations play a role in the acoustic structure of calls.

Barbary macaque females have the ability to recognize their own offspring&#x27;s calls through a variety of acoustic parameters. Because of this, infant calls do not have to differ dramatically for mothers to be able to recognize their own infant&#x27;s call. Mothers demonstrate different behaviours on hearing the calls of other infant macaques as opposed to the calls of their own offspring. More parameters for vocalizations lead to more reliable identification of calls in both infants and in adult macaques so it is not surprising that the same acoustic characteristics that are heard in infant calls are also heard in adult calls.

===Mating===

Although Barbary macaques are sexually active at all points during a female&#x27;s reproductive cycle, male Barbary macaques determine a female&#x27;s most fertile period by sexual swellings on the female. Mating is most common during a female&#x27;s most fertile period. The swelling size of the female reaches a maximum around the time of ovulation, suggesting that size helps a male predict when he should mate. This is further supported by the fact that male ejaculation peaks at the same time that female sexual swelling peaks. Change in female sexual behaviour around the time of ovulation is insufficient to demonstrate to the male that the female is fertile. The swellings, therefore, appear necessary for predicting fertility.

Barbary macaque females differ from other nonhuman primates in that they often mate with a majority of the males in their social group. While females are active in choosing sexual associations, the mating behaviour of macaque social groups is not entirely determined by female choice. These multiple matings by females decrease the certainty of paternity of male Barbary macaques and may lead them to care for all infants within the group. For a male to ensure his reproductive success, he must maximize his time spent around the females in the group during their fertile periods. Injuries to male macaques peak during the fertile period, which points to male-male competition as an important determinant of male reproductive success. Not allowing a female to mate with other males, however, would be costly to the male, since doing so would not allow him to mate with more females.

===Parenting===
Barbary macaques from all age and sex groups participate in alloparental care of infants. Male care of infants has been of particular interest to research because high levels of care from males are uncommon in groups where paternity is highly uncertain. Males even act as true alloparents of infant macaques by carrying them and caring for them for hours at a time as opposed to just demonstrating more casual interactions with the infants. The social status of females plays a role in female alloparental interactions with infants. Higher-ranking females have more interactions, whereas younger, lower-ranking females have less access to infants.

===Diet===
The diet of the Barbary macaque consists of a mixture of plants and insect prey. It consumes a large variety of gymnosperms and angiosperms. Almost every part of the plant is eaten, including flowers, fruits, seeds, seedlings, leaves, buds, bark, gum, stems, roots, bulbs, and corms. Common prey caught and consumed by Barbary macaques are snails, earthworms, scorpions, spiders, centipedes, millipedes, grasshoppers, termites, water striders, scale insects, beetles, butterflies, moths, ants, and even tadpoles.

Barbary macaques can cause major damage to the trees in their prime habitat, the Atlas cedar forests in Morocco. Since deforestation in Morocco has become a major environmental problem in recent years, research has been conducted to determine the cause of the bark stripping behaviour demonstrated by these macaques. Cedar trees are also vital to this population of Barbary macaques as an area with cedars can support a much higher density of macaques than one without them. A lack of a water source and exclusion of monkeys from water sources are major causes of cedar bark stripping behaviour in Barbary macaques. Density of macaques, however, is less correlated with the behaviour than the other causes considered.

=== Predators ===
The Barbary macaque&#x27;s main predators are the domestic dog, leopard and eagles; the golden eagle may only prey on cubs, since it is morphologically not adapted to hunt primates. The approach of eagles and domestic dogs is known to elicit an alarm call response.

==Threats==

Wild populations of Barbary macaques have suffered a major decline in recent years to the point of being declared an endangered species on the IUCN Red List since 2008. The Barbary macaque is threatened by fragmentation and degradation of forest habitat, and poaching for the illegal pet trade; it is also killed in retaliation for raiding crops.
Today, no accurate data exists on the location and number of individuals out of their natural habitat. An unknown number of individuals are living in zoological collections, at other institutions, in private hands, in quarantine, or waiting to be relocated to appropriate destinations.

The habitat of the Barbary macaque is under threat from increased logging activity. Local farmers regard the Barbary macaque as pest and engage in its extermination. Once common throughout northern Africa and southern Mediterranean Europe, only an estimated 12,000 to 21,000 Barbary macaques are left in Morocco and Algeria. Once, its distribution was much more extensive, spreading east through Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, and north to the United Kingdom. Its range is no longer continuous, with only isolated areas of range remaining. By the Pleistocene, it inhabited the warmer Mediterranean regions of Europe, from the Balearic Islands and mainland Iberia and France in the west, east to Italy, Sicily, Malta, and as far north as Germany and Norfolk in the British Isles.
The species decreased with the arrival of the last Last Glacial Period, going functionally extinct on the Iberian Peninsula except for Gibraltar around 30,000 years ago.

The Barbary macaque is threatened by habitat loss, overgrazing, and illegal capture. In Morocco, tourists interact with Barbary macaques in many regions. Information collected in the interviews with inhabitants in the High Atlas of Morocco indicated that the capture of macaques occurs in these regions. Conflict between local people and wild macaques is one of the greatest challenges to Barbary macaque conservation in Morocco. The main threats to the survival of Barbary macaques in this region have been found to be habitat destruction and the impact of livestock grazing, but problems of conflict with inhabitants are also increasing due to crop raiding and the illegal capture of macaques. Human–macaque conflict is mainly due to crop raiding. In the High Atlas of Morocco, macaques attract a large number of tourists every year, and they are favoured for their potential benefits to tourism. In addition, macaques have some ecological roles; for example, they are the predators of several destructive insects and pests of plants and participate in seed dispersal in many plant species.

In the Central High Atlas, the Barbary macaque occurs in relatively small and fragmented areas restricted to the main valleys at elevations of . In a 2013 study, researchers reported that they found Barbary macaques in relatively small and fragmented habitats in 10 sites, and that the species no longer occurred in four localities. This could be attributed to habitat degradation, hunting activities, the impact of livestock grazing, and disturbance by people. As deforestation for agriculture and overgrazing continues, the remaining forest becomes increasingly fragmented. Consequently, the Barbary macaque is now restricted to small, fragmented relict habitats.

===Human use and tourism===
Many of the mistaken ideas about human anatomy contained in the writings of Galen are apparently due to his use of the Barbary macaque, the only anthropoid available to him, in dissections. Strong cultural taboos of his time prevented his performing any dissections of human cadavers, even in his role as physician and teacher of physicians.

Macaques in Morocco are frequently used as photo props, despite their protected status. Tourists are encouraged to take photos with the animals for a fee. Macaques are also sold as pets in Morocco and Algeria, and exported to Europe to be used as pets and fighting monkeys, both in physical marketplaces and online.

Tourists interact with wild monkeys across the globe, and in some situations, tourists may be encouraged to feed, photograph, and touch the monkeys. Although tourism has the potential to bring in money towards conservation goals and provides an incentive for the protection of natural habitats, close proximity and interactions with tourists can also have significant psychological impacts on the Barbary macaques. Fecal samples and stress-indicating behaviours, such as belly scratching, indicate that the presence of tourists has a negative impact on the macaques. Human activities such as taking photographs cause the animals stress, possibly because the people come too close to the animals and make prolonged eye contact (a sign of aggression in many primates). Macaques that live in areas close to human contact have more parasites and lower overall health than those that live in wilder environments, at least in part due to the unhealthy diets they receive as a result of feeding from humans.

Several groups of Barbary macaques can be found in tourist sites, where they are affected by the presence of visitors providing food to them. Researchers comparing two such groups in the central High Atlas mountains in 2008 found that the tourist group of Barbary macaques spent significantly more time engaged in resting and aggressive behaviour, and foraged and moved significantly less than the wild group. The tourist group spent significantly less time per day feeding on herbs, seeds, and acorns than the wild group. Human food accounted for 26% of the daily feeding records for the tourist group, and 1% for the wild-feeding group.
Scientists who collected data on the seasonal activity budget and diet composition of the endangered Barbary macaque group inhabiting a tourist site in Morocco found that activity budgets and diet of the study group varied markedly among seasons and habitats. The percentage of daily time spent in foraging and moving was lowest in spring, and the daily time spent in resting was highest in spring and summer. The time budget devoted to aggressive display was highest in spring than the other three seasons. There is an increase in the daily feeding time spent eating flowers and fruits in summer, seeds, acorns, roots and barks in winter and autumn, herbs in spring and summer, and a clear increase in consumption of the human food in spring.
The tourist and the wild groups did not differ in the proportion of daily records devoted to terrestrial feeding, but the tourist group spent a significantly lower percentage of daily records in terrestrial foraging, moving and resting, while performing more terrestrial aggressive displays more than the wild group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of terrestrial feeding records spent eating fruits; but the tourist group had lower daily percentages of terrestrial feeding on leaves, seeds and acorns, roots and barks, and herbs, while it spent higher daily percentages of terrestrial feeding on human food.

Barbary macaques were traded or perhaps given as diplomatic gifts as long ago as the Iron Age, as indicated by remains found in such sites as Emain Macha in Ireland, dating to no later than 95 BC; an Iron Age hillfort, the Titelberg in Luxembourg; and two Roman sites in Britain.

<doc id="478483" wikidata="Q703611" url="?curid=478483" title="Branko Lustig">
<text>Branko Lustig (10 June 1932 – 14 November 2019) was a Croatian film producer best known for winning Academy Awards for Best Picture for &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; and &quot;Gladiator&quot;. He is the only person born in the territory of present-day Croatia to have won two Academy Awards.

==Early life==
Lustig was born in Osijek, Kingdom of Yugoslavia to a Croatian Jewish family. His father, Mirko, was head-waiter at an Osijek Café Central, and his mother, Vilma (Gütter), was a housewife. Lustig&#x27;s grandparents, unlike his parents, were religious and he regularly attended the local synagogue with them.

During World War II, as a child he was imprisoned for two years in Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. Most members of his family perished in the death camps throughout Europe, including his grandmother who was killed in the gas chamber, while his father was killed in Čakovec on 15 March 1945. Lustig&#x27;s mother survived the Holocaust and was reunited with him after the war. On the day of the liberation, he weighed only 66 pounds (29.94 kg). Lustig credited his survival in Auschwitz to a German officer who happened to be from the same suburb of Osijek as Lustig. He overheard Lustig crying and asked him who his father was. It turned out the officer had known Lustig&#x27;s father.

==Movie career==
Lustig began his film career in 1955 as an assistant director at Jadran Film, a state-owned Zagreb-based film production company. In 1956 he worked as a unit production manager on Branko Bauer&#x27;s World War II drama &quot;Ne okreći se sine&quot;, winner of three Golden Arena awards at the 1956 Pula Film Festival. Lustig was the location manager for &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1971). In the 1980s Lustig worked on the miniseries &quot;The Winds of War&quot; (1983) and its sequel &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; (1988). He moved to the United States in 1988.

Lustig received his first Oscar in 1993 for the production of &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, a film based on the novel of Thomas Keneally (which is, in turn, based on the true-life story of a German manufacturer who saved hundreds of Jews during World War II). Lustig himself had a cameo early in the film as a nightclub maitre d’. In July 2015, Lustig presented the Oscar to Yad Vashem for eternal safekeeping. He received his second Oscar for the epic movie &quot;Gladiator&quot; about a struggle for power in Imperial Rome, in 2001. Other major Hollywood films that Lustig worked on as a producer or executive producer include &quot;The Peacemaker&quot; (1997), &quot;Hannibal&quot; (2001), and &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; (2001). In 2008, Lustig helped establish an independent production company Six Point Films to produce &quot;meaningful, thought-provoking independent films&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
In 1994 Lustig received the Order of Duke Trpimir by President Franjo Tuđman for his work in film. In 2008 he became the first filmmaker ever, and second in the field of the arts (preceded by Vladimir Nazor), to be awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Zagreb.

The Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust honored Branko Lustig together with Andreas Maislinger at his 2nd Annual Dinner on 8 November 2009 at the Beverly Hills Hotel for his long-time commitment to Holocaust education and commemoration. Lustig is honorary president and one of the founding members of the Jewish Movie Festival in Zagreb. On 16 September 2010, he was awarded honorary citizenship of Osijek.

Lustig celebrated his bar mitzvah on 2 May 2011 at Auschwitz, in front of barrack No. 24a. He missed his rite of passage as a 13-year-old because at the time he was a prisoner in the very same barrack, having been deported from Osijek when he was ten years old. The bar mitzvah ceremony was held during a March of the Living educational tour of Poland and Israel for high school students.

Lustig resided between Los Angeles and Zagreb, and called both of the cities his home, although in the &quot;Jutarnji list&quot; interview from September, 2012 he stated: &quot;But more and more, slowly, I am returning to Zagreb. I&#x27;m coming back.&quot; In the 2017 local elections Lustig was elected member of the Zagreb City Assembly as a candidate of Milan Bandić&#x27;s party list but eventually did not take his seat.

Lustig died in Zagreb on 14 November 2019, aged 87.

Lustig&#x27;s life was remembered in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s obituary programme &quot;Last Word&quot; in December 2019.

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1991 with the song &quot;A Message to Your Heart&quot;, written by Paul Curtis, and performed by Samantha Janus. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final.

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;A Song for Europe 1991&quot; ===
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) held &quot;A Song for Europe 1991&quot; on 29 March 1991, hosted by Terry Wogan. Following the somewhat negative comments by one member of the celebrity panel in 1990, the panel idea was dropped in 1991. The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of Ronnie Hazlehurst as conductor accompanied all the songs, the musicians appearing on camera for the first time since 1978.

The eight songs in contention to represent the United Kingdom were presented during Terry Wogan&#x27;s &quot;Wogan&quot; chat show on BBC1. Two songs were presented during each of four broadcasts between 20 and 27 March.

A separate results show was broadcast on BBC1 the same evening. BBC Radio 2 simulcast the final, with commentary by Ken Bruce, but did not broadcast the results show.

Malcolm Roberts had been one of six singers who had jointly represented Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest 1985, thus becoming the second entrant in a British national final to have participated in Eurovision for another nation, after Dan Duskey (aka Michael Palace) in 1986.

==== UK Discography ====

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1992 with the song &quot;One Step Out of Time&quot;, written by Paul Davies, Tony Ryan, and Victor Stratton, and performed by Michael Ball. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final, after having previously selected the performer internally.

==Before Eurovision==
===Artist selection===
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) continued to use a national final &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; to select its entry. For 1992, the multi-artist format utilized since 1976 was dropped in favor of a single artist performing several songs as from 1964 to 1975. Michael Ball was revealed by the BBC as its entrant for the Eurovision Song Contest 1992.

=== &quot;A Song for Europe 1992&quot; ===
Two songs each were premiered during the four broadcasts of &quot;Wogan&quot; on BBC1 between 8 and 30 March 1992, and were later featured in various programmes on BBC Radio 2.

Eight songs, all performed by Michael Ball, competed in the televised final on 3 April 1992 held at the BBC&#x27;s TVC3 Studio in London and hosted by Terry Wogan. The show was broadcast on BBC1 and BBC Radio 2 with commentary by Ken Bruce. The performances were filmed earlier on 2 April 1992 and a public televote selected the winning song, &quot;One Step Out of Time&quot;, which was revealed during a separate show broadcast on BBC1 and hosted by Terry Wogan.
Paul Curtis&#x27; song was a last minute replacement for an unnamed song that was either disqualified or withdrawn. It was Curtis&#x27; 22nd and last song to feature in the British national finals for Eurovision; a record for any songwriter. It was the only one of the eight songs that Michael Ball did not record. He released the other five best placed songs on his debut album &quot;Michael Ball&quot;, which topped the UK album chart in May 1992. The winning song was released by his label Polydor on single in 7&quot; vinyl, cassette and CD formats, reaching no. 20 in the UK singles chart. The remaining two songs were eventually included on various compilation albums.

==At Eurovision==
Ball performed 16th on the night of the contest, following and preceding . He received 139 points, placing 2nd in a field of 23. Despite coming second, he received more 12 points than eventual winner Ireland.

Anyang also has beautiful natural scenery—the Taihang Linlu Hill Scenic Area on the 400-km Taihang Mountains and the grand 1,500-km Red Flag Canal.

===Changchun Temple===
Changchun Temple, a Taoist shrine, was built on the hillside of the mountains surrounding it during the Tang dynasty. It was officially opened to the public on 1 May 2014, after a period of cautious restoration.

===Tianning Temple===
Tianning Si (Mansion Temple) was established during the Tang dynasty, and has recently been restored by the Protection and Research Institute of Ancient Architecture of Anyang City, and opened to the public. The main structures within the temple compound include: the gate house, the three-room (8.4 m x 14 m) Hall of the Heavenly King with hanging-eaves over the gables rebuilt in 2002, the slightly larger Precious Hall of the Great Hero (17.8 m x 11.65 m) with single-eave gabled roof originally from the Qing dynasty and rebuilt in 2001, and the Wenfeng Pagoda.

===Wenfeng Pagoda===
Wenfeng Ta (Literature Peak Pagoda) on the grounds of the Tianning Temple is believed to have been constructed in 925 and is known, from inscriptions concerning the reconstruction of the temple, to have been in place by 952. The current pagoda was constructed during the Ming dynasty and received its current name during the Qing dynasty due to its proximity to the Confucian temple. The five-story dark red brick octagonal tower is 38.65m high and is, unusually, larger at the top than the bottom and is topped with a 10-metre Lamaist stupa-style dagoba steeple. The pagoda stands on a two-metre-high stone pedestal and is decorated with multi-eave pent roofs and carvings of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. The unique pagoda is the symbol of Anyang.

===Yinxu ruins and museum===
Located about northwest of Anyang are the ruins of the Shang dynasty capital known as Yin. This massive archaeological site was discovered in 1899, excavated in the decades that followed, and first opened to the public in the 1980s as the Garden Museum of Yinxu. The current Yinxu museum was opened on 16 March 2005, and includes the famous Tomb of Fu Hao.

The site was later designated a UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2006.

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1993 with the song &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot;, written by Brian Teasdale and Dean Collinson, and performed by Sonia. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final, after having previously selected the performer internally.

==Before Eurovision==
===Artist selection===
A shortlist of artists included by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was presented to the Head of Delegations of each participating country in the Eurovision Song Contest that ultimately selected the British entrant. The BBC revealed Sonia as its representative for the Eurovision Song Contest 1993. The British branch of the International Eurovision Fan Club (OGAE), had conducted a poll in late 1991, asking the members to nominate which singer they&#x27;d like to represent the United Kingdom in the contest. Sonia was the overwhelming winner of that poll, announced in early 1992.

===&quot;A Song for Europe 1993&quot;===
Two songs each, both performed by Sonia, were premiered during four preview programmes on BBC1 between 14 March and 4 April 1993. The final, held at the BBC Television Centre in London and hosted by Terry Wogan, was filmed earlier on 8 April 1993 and televised on 9 April 1993. The show was broadcast on BBC1 and BBC Radio 2 with commentary by Ken Bruce. A public televote selected the winning song, &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot;, which was revealed during a separate show broadcast on BBC1 and hosted by Terry Wogan.

Sonia released the winning song on an Arista vinyl 7&quot; single, 12&quot; single, CD single and cassette, reaching no. 15 in the UK singles chart. The top four songs were included in her album &quot;Better The Devil You Know&quot;, released by Arista just after the Eurovision final. The album peaked at no. 32 in the UK album chart. The remaining four tracks have not been released in any official format.

==At Eurovision==
Twenty five countries participated in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest, held at the Green Glens Arena in Millstreet, Ireland on 15 May. &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot; was placed second with 164 points. It received points from every country apart from Greece and Malta.

<text>Pán Gēng (), personal name Zi Xun, was a Shang dynasty King of China. He is best known for having moved the capital of the Shang dynasty to its final location at Yīn.

== Records ==
In the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; he was listed by Sima Qian as the nineteenth Shang king, succeeding his older brother Yang Jia. Oracle script inscriptions on bones unearthed at Yinxu alternatively identify him as the eighteenth Shang king. He ruled for about 28 years according to both the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; and the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;.

The &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; provide a brief summary of the major known events of his rule, which are as follows. He was enthroned in the year of Bingyin () with Yan () as his capital. In the seventh year of his regime, the Ying vassal () came to Yan to pay homage to him. In the fourteenth year of his reign he moved his capital to Beimeng (), renaming it Yin (). In the fifteenth year of his reign he reviewed his army at the new capital, and in the nineteenth year of his reign he assigned his minister Fen () to Yayu ().

The &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; provides a different account of the relocation of the capital. It states that Pán Gēng moved the capital from a location north of the Yellow River to Bo 亳, the capital of the Shang founder Tang, on the south side of the river. It further states that this move was initially opposed by the people of Yin, who were tired of being moved, but that they were eventually satisfied when the Tang system of government was adopted, and the move proved to be prosperous.

Upon his death, he was given the posthumous name Pán Gēng and was succeeded by his younger brother Xiao Xin.

In the &quot;Classic of History&quot;, there exists a chapter entitled &quot;Pán Gēng&quot;, which tradition holds to have been a speech by this king; however, the language in it is so different from that of Pán Gēng&#x27;s time that it is most likely not a product of his era.

== Historical reference ==
Wang Anshi, in his response to Sima Guang&#x27;s accusatory letter, cited the example of Pán Gēng&#x27;s undaunted perseverance in pursuing his goal (movement of the capital) in the face of opposition of both government officials and the common people.

<text>Arthurlie is an area of the town of Barrhead, East Renfrewshire, Scotland.

== History of Arthurlie ==
The lands of Arthurlie were held in medieval times by the Stewart family, a branch of the noble Stewarts of Darnley. Later the lands became the property of Allan Pollock, Esq. and remained in his family for several generations before being inherited by Gavin Ralston of Woodside in Beith. The area has long been associated with the legends of King Arthur. The name means &#x27;Arthur&#x27;s meadow.&#x27; Arthurlie was a barony of considerable extent, however it eventually came to be purchased by Henry Dunlop Esq. in 1818 from Gavin Ralston, a distant relative.

The Dunlop family ran Gateside Cotton Mill under the name of James Dunlop &amp; Son. The old house was torn down and Arthurlie House was erected with the old gardens extended and remodelled in 1818. The estate remained in the hands of the Dunlop family until about 1938. It was a Mr. Charles Taylor who discovered the ancient Arthurlee Cross being used as a gatepost on the estate and persuaded Henry Dunlop to rescue it.

===Arthurlie House 2008===
== The Arthurlie Cross ==

This stone is a 9th - 10th century cross-shaft made from a very hard and compact sandstone, and it now stands at NS 4997 5854, by the roadside, set in a modern rectangular base and protected by railings. Stylistically, it belongs to the &#x27;Govan School&#x27; of carving, as seen most notably in The Govan Stones collection at Govan Old Parish Church.

The cross measures high, wide, and thick and is in good condition except that one face is badly worn. One side had an iron ring indented into it, almost flush with the surface, this being done during its time when it was being used as a gate post after it was no longer used as a bridge. In the 1857 Name Book it was believed that its original site had been at NS 4968 5813 in a field called &quot;Cross-stane-park&quot;. In 1795 it was acting as a footbridge over a stream in the Colinbar Glen area at the bottom of the &quot;Cross-stane-park&quot; (NS 497 580). It stayed there long enough to be worn smooth on one face; it was seen by the OS surveyor in 1857

In approximately 1870 it was erected in the grounds of Arthurlee House at NS 4979 5814 as shown in the photograph. Sometime prior to 1942 it was moved yet again by Barrhead Council to its present position.

The stone is said to be associated with Arthur, King of the Britons. Locally it was said to mark Arthur&#x27;s grave or a conspicuous leader of that name.

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1996 with the song &quot;Ooh Aah... Just a Little Bit&quot;, composed by Steve Rodway, with lyrics by Simon Tauber, and performed by Gina G. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final.

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;The Great British Song Contest 1996&quot; ===
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) developed &quot;The Great British Song Contest 1996&quot; in order to select its entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 1996. Eight acts competed in the competition which consisted of a semi-final on 1 March 1996 and a televised final on 8 March 1996. Both semi-final and final were broadcast on BBC1.

====Semi-final====
The qualifying round for the contest (the first since ), a special edition of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, was broadcast on BBC1 on 1 March 1996 and hosted by Nicky Campbell. It was announced that the four songs with the highest number of telephone votes would qualify for the final. A recap of the songs were also featured during the following morning&#x27;s edition of &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; with voting lines reopened for a short time. The top four songs were announced later that evening during &quot;The National Lottery Live&quot; and went forward to the final on 8 March.

====Final====
The BBC held the final on 8 March 1996 at BBC Television Centre in London. Hosted by Terry Wogan, it was broadcast on BBC1 at 20:00. For the first time since 1985, there was no simultaneous broadcast with BBC Radio 2. The winning entry was announced at the end of the show following a further public phone vote. The guest performers were Irish boy band Boyzone, who performed their version of Cat Stevens&#x27; &quot;Father and Son&quot; and actress Nicola Hughes who performed &quot;The Acid Queen&quot; from the rock musical &quot;The Who&#x27;s Tommy&quot;.

==At Eurovision==
With the exception of host nation Norway, who were exempted, all 29 countries wishing to participate in the 1996 contest had to go through an audio-only pre-qualifying round held on 20 March. The lowest-placed seven songs would be eliminated and would not appear in Oslo. Gina G was placed third with 153 points, thus qualifying for the final.

On the night of the final Gina G performed 2nd in the running order, following Turkey and preceding Spain. At the end of the voting it had received 77 points, placing 8th out of 23 contestants. The United Kingdom jury awarded its 12 points to Cyprus.

When Belén Fernández de Henestrosa, the Spanish spokesperson, announced the votes of the Spanish jury, she awarded six points to &quot;Holland&quot; (the Netherlands), which host Ingvild Byrn misheard as &quot;Poland.&quot; The official results table corrected this error, and the Netherlands&#x27; seventh-place result was restored at the expense of the United Kingdom, who ultimately finished eighth. 
Despite this result, &#x27;Just a Little Bit&#x27; is one of the most successful of the UK&#x27;s entries at Eurovision, not only topping the UK singles chart but also finding success in America, where the song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording in 1998.

Per the rules of the 1998 contest, as the previous year&#x27;s winner and contest host, the BBC was given an automatic place in the competition, and was subsequently included on the European Broadcasting Union&#x27;s (EBU) list of the 25 broadcasters that had signed up to partake in the contest. The BBC opted to select its chosen entry for the contest through a national final entitled &quot;The Great British Song Contest 1998&quot;.

== Before Eurovision ==
=== &quot;The Great British Song Contest 1998&quot; ===
The BBC organised a public selection process to determine its entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 1998. &quot;The Great British Song Contest&quot; was organised for the third time, following the same format used the previous year: after a public submission process, eight songs were selected to compete in a semi-final broadcast on BBC Radio 2, where listeners would choose four entries via televoting to progress to a final on BBC One. A second round of public voting during the televised broadcast would determine the winning song that would represent the UK at Eurovision. More than 800 songs were submitted to the competition and following several rounds of shortlisting from these songs, the eight semi-finalists were determined.

==== Semi-final ====
The eight songs which featured in the semi-final were previewed on the Radio 2 shows &quot;Wake Up to Wogan&quot; and &quot;The Ken Bruce Show&quot; between 2 and 5 February 1998, with two songs being played each day on both programmes. The semi-final was then held on 6 February, hosted by Ken Bruce and Terry Wogan. Once all songs had been played, listeners were invited to phone in and vote for their favourites from 9–10am. The result was announced at the end of the broadcast; the qualifying songs were announced in alphabetical order by title.

==== Final ====
Each of the finalists featured on weekly editions of &quot;The National Lottery Draw&quot; on BBC One, with one act appearing each week over a period of four weeks: Kitt appeared on the 21 February 1998 broadcast; Alberta on 28 February 1998; Imaani on 7 March 1998; and The Collective on 14 March 1998. A free promotional CD featuring extracts of the four finalists was also released and made available in high street record shops, while the four finalists and the previous year&#x27;s winning act Katrina Leskanich performed live at London&#x27;s G-A-Y nightclub on 14 March 1998. Between the semi-final and the final, Kitt changed her stage name to Sapphire.

The final was held on 15 March 1998, broadcast on BBC One and presented by Wogan. The broadcast featured the same performances of the acts as those featured on &quot;The National Lottery Draw&quot;, with Wogan providing live links between songs and short pre-recorded introductions by the songwriters of each song preceding each performance. Other segments of the broadcast included behind-the-scenes footage featuring Ulrika Jonsson at Birmingham&#x27;s National Indoor Arena, the venue for the then-upcoming Eurovision Song Contest, an interview with Leskanich hosted by Jonsson and clips during the end credits of previous UK winning Eurovision performances. Following a brief recap of the participating acts, a one-hour voting window was opened for viewers to vote through telephone at a cost of 10p per call and via the internet; the results were subsequently announced by Wogan on 21 March 1998 during that evening&#x27;s &quot;National Lottery Draw&quot; on BBC One, with the top three acts announced in reverse order along with the number of votes received. 2.66 million viewers watched the &quot;Great British Song Contest&quot; final and the &quot;National Lottery Draw&quot; which featured the results attracted an audience of 9.81 million.

=== Promotion === 
Ahead of the contest, Imaani made several appearances on UK television programmes to promote her entry to the British public. Imaani performed her Eurovision song on the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s programmes &quot;Blue Peter&quot; on 23 March 1998, &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; on both 28 March 1998 and 11 April 1998, and &quot;Fully Booked&quot; on 3 May 1998, while she also appeared on the BBC&#x27;s music chart show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on both 8 and 22 May 1998. BBC Radio 2 also produced a radio documentary, titled &quot;Going for a Song&quot;, broadcast 9 May 1998, the day of the Eurovision final, which followed Imaani&#x27;s preparations for the Eurovision Song Contest. &quot;Where Are You?&quot; was released in the formats of both CD and cassette on 9 March 1998, featuring an additional ballad mix of the song. The song peaked at number 15 on the UK Singles Chart, while it also charted on the Netherlands&#x27; Mega Top 100 and Belgium&#x27;s Ultratop chart.

== At Eurovision ==

As the winners of the previous year&#x27;s event, the BBC was given the chance to host the Eurovision Song Contest in 1998, selecting the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham as the venue of the contest, held on 9 May 1998. Following confirmation of the 25-country participant list, the running order for the contest was decided by a draw held on 13 November 1997; the UK was assigned position 16, following and preceding .

Imaani took part in technical rehearsals at the venue on 5 and 7 May 1998, followed by dress rehearsals on 8 and 9 May. Ahead of the contest, the UK were considered one of the favourites among bookmakers to win the contest for a second time, featuring alongside the entries from , , , and the . The contest was hosted by Wogan and Jonsson and was broadcast in the UK on television and radio, with Wogan also providing commentary for BBC One and Bruce doing likewise on BBC Radio 2. Imaani performed alongside the BBC Concert Orchestra, which was conducted by James McMillan for her performance.

At the end of the contest, the UK finished in second place, receiving a total of 166 points. The result gave the UK its 15th second-place finish in its competitive history, which remains a contest record The United Kingdom would achieve another second place in .

=== Voting ===
The same voting system in use since 1975 was again implemented for the contest, with each country providing 1–8, 10 and 12 points to their 10 highest-ranking songs, with countries not allowed to vote for themselves. For the first time however, the contest results were determined predominantly by public voting via telephone, following a successful trial among five countries the previous year; an eight-member back-up jury was also assembled in case technical failures rendered the telephone votes invalid.

A total of 407,167 valid votes were registered in the UK in total during the five-minute voting window, which determined the UK&#x27;s points; the BBC subsequently published a full breakdown of the votes cast for each country after the Eurovision Song Contest. Bruce was also appointed the spokesperson and announced the results of the UK vote during the broadcast.

<text>In experimental and applied particle physics, nuclear physics, and nuclear engineering, a particle detector, also known as a radiation detector, is a device used to detect, track, and/or identify ionizing particles, such as those produced by nuclear decay, cosmic radiation, or reactions in a particle accelerator. Detectors can measure the particle energy and other attributes such as momentum, spin, charge, particle type, in addition to merely registering the presence of the particle.

==Examples and types==

Many of the detectors invented and used so far are ionization detectors (of which gaseous ionization detectors and semiconductor detectors are most typical) and scintillation detectors; but other, completely different principles have also been applied, like Čerenkov light and transition radiation.

Historical examples
*Bubble chamber
*Wilson cloud chamber (diffusion chamber)
*Photographic plate (Nuclear emulsion)

;Detectors for radiation protection

The following types of particle detector are widely used for radiation protection, and are commercially produced in large quantities for general use within the nuclear, medical, and environmental fields.
*Dosimeter
*Electroscope (when used as a portable dosimeter)
*Gaseous ionization detector
**Geiger counter
**Ionization chamber
**Proportional counter
*Scintillation counter
*Semiconductor detector

Commonly used detectors for particle and nuclear physics

*Gaseous ionization detector
**Ionization chamber
**Proportional counter
***Multiwire proportional chamber
***Drift chamber
***Time projection chamber
***Micropattern gaseous detector
**Geiger–Müller tube
**Spark chamber
*Solid-state detectors:
**Semiconductor detector and variants including CCDs
***Silicon Vertex Detector
**Solid-state nuclear track detector
**Cherenkov detector
***Ring-imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH)
**Scintillation counter and associated photomultiplier, photodiode, or avalanche photodiode
***Lucas cell
***Time-of-flight detector
**Transition radiation detector
*Calorimeter
*Microchannel plate detector
*Neutron detector

==Modern detectors==

Modern detectors in particle physics combine several of the above elements in layers much like an onion.

==Research particle detectors==
Detectors designed for modern accelerators are huge, both in size and in cost. The term &quot;counter&quot; is often used instead of &quot;detector&quot; when the detector counts the particles but does not resolve its energy or ionization. Particle detectors can also usually track ionizing radiation (high energy photons or even visible light). If their main purpose is radiation measurement, they are called &quot;radiation detectors&quot;, but as photons are also (massless) particles, the term &quot;particle detector&quot; is still correct.

== Theoretical Models of Particle Detectors ==
Beyond their experimental implementations, theoretical models of particle detectors are also of great importance to theoretical physics. These models consider localized non-relativistic quantum systems coupled to a quantum field. They receive the name of particle detectors because when the non-relativistic quantum system is measured in an excited state, one can claim to have detected a particle. The first instance of particle detector models in the literature dates from the 80&#x27;s, where a particle in a box was introduced by W. G. Unruh in order to probe a quantum field around a black hole. Shortly after, Bryce DeWitt proposed a simplification of the model, giving rise to the Unruh-DeWitt detector model.

Beyond their applications to theoretical physics, particle detector models are related to experimental fields such as quantum optics, where atoms can be used as detectors for the quantum electromagnetic field via the light-matter interaction. From a conceptual side, particle detectors also allow one to formally define the concept of particles without relying on asymptotic states, or representations of a quantum field theory. As M. Scully puts it, from an operational viewpoint one can state that &quot;a particle is what a particle detector detects&quot;, which in essence defines a particle as the detection of excitations of a quantum field.

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1990 with the song &quot;Give a Little Love Back to the World&quot;, written by Paul Curtis, and performed by Emma. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final.

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;A Song for Europe 1990&quot; ===
The eight songs in contention to represent the United Kingdom were presented during Terry Wogan&#x27;s &quot;Wogan&quot; chat show on BBC1. Two songs were presented during each of four broadcasts between 21 and 28 March. The songs were also featured in various programmes on BBC Radio 2.

A separate results show was broadcast on BBC1 the same evening. BBC Radio 2 simulcast the final and also broadcast the results show, both with commentary by Ken Bruce.

====Final====
The BBC held the 1990 edition of &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; on 30 March at Studio 1 of the BBC Television Centre in London. The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of Alyn Ainsworth as conductor accompanied all the songs, but despite performing live, the orchestra were off-screen, behind the set. Terry Wogan presided over the eight finalists and a panel of celebrities was assembled to comment on each of the entries. The panel was composed of Gloria Hunniford, Tim Rice, Cathy McGowan, and Carl Davis.

As in the last two years, a national telephone vote decided the outcome of the contest. Emma won with a runaway phone poll of 97,625 calls over John Miles, who polled 38,966.

==== UK Discography ====
*Kelly - &quot;Better Be Good to Me&quot;: Loading Bay LBAY25 (B Side).
*Emma - &quot;Give a Little Love Back to the World&quot;: Big Wave BWR33 (7&quot; Single)/BWRT33 (12&quot; Single)/BWRCD33 (CD Single)/BWRC33 (Cassette).

==At Eurovision==
The final was held in Zagreb, Yugoslavia on 5 May. Emma was supported by several backing singers including Miriam Stockley (later a backing vocalist for Katrina and the Waves in 1997) and Sam Blue (who competed against Katrina and the Waves in the 1997 national final). Despite being one of the favourites to win, &quot;Give a Little Love Back to the World&quot; had to settle for sixth place with 87 points. The British jury voting was quite idiosyncratic awarding no points to or (unlike neighbours who gave Italy 12 points and France 8) and 12 points to who finished 4th as well as awarding Ireland 10 points.

The contest was broadcast on BBC1 and BBC TV Europe with commentary by Terry Wogan, and on BBC Radio 2, with commentary by Ken Bruce. It was also shown on SSVC Television for the British troops who are stationed in Germany.

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1999 with the song &quot;Say It Again&quot;, written by Paul Varney, and performed by the group Precious. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), organised a public selection process to determine its entry for the contest, &quot;The Great British Song Contest 1999&quot;. Eight songs competed over two rounds, with four songs selected through a radio-broadcast semi-final to advance to the televised final round, held on 7 March 1999, where viewers selected the winning entry through televoting. &quot;Say It Again&quot; performed by girl group Precious received the most votes and was selected to represent the nation in the contest.

Precious performed fifth at the international contest, and at the close of the voting process the UK finished in 12th place, receiving 38 points from 10 countries. At the time this result was the UK&#x27;s second-worst placing in its competitive history, and was the nation&#x27;s first finish outside of the top 10 countries in 12 years. &quot;Say It Again&quot; charted in several singles charts in Europe following the contest, and following further limited commercial success as a group Precious subsequently disbanded in 2001.

== Background ==

Prior to the 1999 contest, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest representing the United Kingdom 41 times since its first entry in 1957 and had competed in all but two editions of the contest. Before this year&#x27;s event, it had won the contest five times: in with the song &quot;Puppet on a String&quot; performed by Sandie Shaw, in with the song &quot;Boom Bang-a-Bang&quot; performed by Lulu, in with &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; performed by Brotherhood of Man, in with the song &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot; performed by Bucks Fizz and in with the song &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; performed by Katrina and the Waves. It had also finished in second place on fifteen occasions, more than any other country. At the , it finished in second place out of twenty-five competing entries with the song &quot;Where Are You?&quot; performed by Imaani amassing a total of 166 points.

Per the rules of the 1999 contest, as the UK featured among the 17 countries with the highest average scores over the past five editions, they were permitted to enter the upcoming contest, and the BBC were subsequently included on the European Broadcasting Union&#x27;s (EBU) list of the 23 countries that had signed up to partake in the contest. The BBC opted to select its chosen entry for the contest through a national final, &quot;The Great British Song Contest 1999&quot;.

== Before Eurovision ==
=== &quot;The Great British Song Contest 1999&quot; ===
The BBC organised a public selection process to determine its entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 1999. &quot;The Great British Song Contest&quot; was organised for the fourth time, and a similar format to that used for previous contests was implemented: following a public submission process, eight songs were selected to compete in a semi-final broadcast on BBC Radio 2, where listeners would choose four entries via televoting to progress to a televised final on BBC One, where a second round of public voting would determine the winning song that would represent the UK at Eurovision. More than 840 songs were submitted to the competition; a 40-song shortlist of these entries was presented to a panel of music professionals representing the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, which reduced the number of potential entries to 20, and BBC contest organisers then selected the eight semi-finalists from this shortlist on 21 January 1999.

==== Semi-final ====
The eight semi-finalists were featured on the Radio 2 shows &quot;Wake Up to Wogan&quot; and &quot;The Ken Bruce Show&quot; between 1 and 4 February 1999, with two songs being played each day on both programmes. The semi-final was then held on 5 February, hosted by Terry Wogan and Ken Bruce. Once all songs had been played, listeners were invited to vote for their favourites through televoting. More than 21,000 votes were cast during the one-hour voting window, and the result was announced at the end of the programme, with the qualifying songs being announced in alphabetical order by title.

==== Final ====
A free promotional CD featuring extracts of the four finalists was released and made available in high street record shops. Ahead of the final each of the four participating acts performed their competing entries on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on BBC One, with one act appearing each week over four editions: Precious appeared on the 12 February 1999 edition; Sister Sway on 19 February 1999; Alberta on 26 February 1999; and Jay on 5 March 1999.

The final was held on 7 March 1999, hosted by Ulrika Jonsson and broadcast on BBC One. Jonsson provided live links between the pre-recorded performances, with short introductions by the songwriters of each song preceding a repeat airing of each act&#x27;s performance from &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Other segments of the broadcast included clips from the 1998 contest in Birmingham, an interview with last year&#x27;s &quot;Great British Song Contest&quot; winner Imaani, footage of the upcoming Eurovision host city Jerusalem and the contest venue, and a repeat during the end credits of ABBA&#x27;s winning performance of &quot;Waterloo&quot; from the to mark 25 years since the Swedish group won the contest in Brighton. Televoting lines opened following the performance of the final act, with a one-hour voting window provided in which viewers were able to vote; the results were subsequently announced by Jonsson on 12 March 1999 during &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on BBC Two, with the top three acts announced in reverse order along with the number of votes received. 3.14 million viewers watched the &quot;Great British Song Contest&quot; final on BBC One, and the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; results show attracted an audience of 3.04 million.

=== Promotion ===
Ahead of the contest, Precious made several appearances on UK television programmes to promote their entry to the British public. The group made appearances on ITV&#x27;s breakfast TV show &quot;GMTV&quot;, the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Fully Booked&quot;, took part in a live phone-in interview from Jerusalem on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, and made a further performance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, broadcast on 28 May 1999, the day before the contest. A BBC documentary, &quot;Precious: A Band for Britain&quot;, was broadcast on BBC One on 24 May 1999 which followed the members of the group from their first performances to being selected to represent the UK at Eurovision. &quot;Say It Again&quot; was released as an enhanced CD single on 17 May 1999, which featured additional mixes and a music video of the song.

== At Eurovision ==

The Eurovision Song Contest 1999 took place at the International Convention Center in Jerusalem, Israel, on 29 May 1999. According to the Eurovision rules, the 23-country participant list for the contest was composed of: the winning country from the previous year&#x27;s contest; the 17 countries, other than the previous year&#x27;s winner, which had obtained the highest average number of points over the last five contests; and any countries which had not participated in the previous year&#x27;s content. The UK was one of the 17 countries with the highest average scores, and thus were permitted to participate. The running order for the contest was decided by a draw held on 17 November 1998; the UK was assigned position five, following and preceding .

Precious took part in technical rehearsals at the venue on 24 and 26 May, followed by dress rehearsals on 28 and 29 May. Ahead of the contest the UK were considered one of the favourites to win among bookmakers, alongside the entries from , , and . The contest was broadcast in the UK on television and radio, with Terry Wogan providing commentary for BBC One and Ken Bruce on BBC Radio 2. Wogan also made an appearance during the contest&#x27;s opening segment, when the contest hosts Dafna Dekel, Yigal Ravid and Sigal Shachmon held a brief conversation with him on his experience as the host of the previous year&#x27;s contest.

At the end of the contest, the UK placed equal 12th, with , receiving a total of 38 points. This marked the UK&#x27;s second-poorest placing in the contest at that time, and was the UK&#x27;s first finish outside of the top 10 countries since . The contest was watched by a total of 8.91 million viewers in the UK.

=== Voting ===
The same voting system in use since 1975 was again implemented for this event, with each country providing 1–8, 10 and 12 points to the ten highest-ranking songs as determined by a selected jury or the viewing public through televoting, with countries not allowed to vote for themselves. This was the second contest to feature widespread public voting, and the UK opted to implement this method to determine which countries would receive their points, with an 8-member back-up jury assembled in case technical failures rendered the telephone votes invalid. Around 323,000 valid votes were registered in the UK in total during the five-minute voting window, which determined the UK&#x27;s points. The BBC appointed Colin Berry as its spokesperson to announce the results of the British vote during the broadcast.


== After Eurovision ==
Following the contest, &quot;Say It Again&quot; reached a peak of number 6 on the UK Singles Chart and also featured in Sweden&#x27;s Sverigetopplistan and Belgium&#x27;s Ultratop. Precious continued to release new music, having some limited success in the singles chart and releasing a self-titled album in 2000. The group eventually disbanded in 2001: later that year Jenny Frost became a member of British girl group Atomic Kitten; Sophie McDonnell went on to host several television programmes, including the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s shows &quot;50/50&quot; and &quot;The Saturday Show&quot;; Louise Rose moved into acting, appearing in several roles in TV and film; Kalli Clark-Sternberg found work as a session singer; and Anya Lahiri returned to modelling and acting and subsequently became a fitness instructor.

Ahead of the a new rule was introduced which provided the UK with a permanent spot in the contest. As one of the highest-paying EBU member broadcasters, which provided the largest contributions to the Eurovision Song Contest, the UK, along with France, Spain and Germany, became one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; countries that would automatically qualify to each year&#x27;s event, irrespective of the average number of points received in past contests.

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 2000 with the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Play That Song Again&quot;, written by John Springate and Gerry Shepherd, and performed by Nicki French. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), organised a public selection process to determine its entry for the contest, &quot;A Song for Europe 2000&quot;. Eight acts competed in the national final which consisted of a semi-final and a final, during which the winner was selected entirely through a public televote.

As a member of the &quot;Big Four&quot;, the United Kingdom automatically qualified to compete in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest. Performing in position 3, the United Kingdom placed sixteenth out of the 24 participating countries with 28 points.

The eight artists were announced on 15 December 1999, while the competing songs were premiered during &quot;The Ken Bruce Show&quot; and &quot;Wake Up to Wogan&quot; on BBC Radio 2 between 10 and 13 January 2000.

Thus far, it has won the contest five times: in with the song &quot;Puppet on a String&quot; performed by Sandie Shaw, in with the song &quot;Boom Bang-a-Bang&quot; performed by Lulu, in with &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; performed by Brotherhood of Man, in with the song &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot; performed by Bucks Fizz, and in with the song &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; performed by Katrina and the Waves. To this point, the nation is noted for having finished as the runner-up in a record fifteen contests. Up to and including , it had only twice finished outside the top 10, and . Since 1999, the year in which the rule was abandoned that songs must be performed in one of the official languages of the country participating, the UK has had less success, having yet to finish within the top ten. In , &quot;No Dream Impossible&quot; performed by Lindsay Dracass finished in fifteenth place out of twenty-three competing entries.

As part of its duties as participating broadcaster, the BBC organises the selection of its entry in the Eurovision Song Contest and broadcasts the event in the country. The broadcaster announced that it would participate in the 2002 contest on 13 August 2001. The BBC has traditionally organised a national final featuring a competition among several artists and songs to choose its entry for Eurovision. For its 2002 entry, the broadcaster announced that a national final involving a public vote would be held to select the entry.

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;A Song for Europe 2002&quot; ===
&quot;A Song for Europe 2002&quot; was the national final developed by the BBC in order to select its entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2002. Eight acts competed in the competition which consisted of a radio semi-final on 1 February 2002 and a televised final on 3 March 2002. The semi-final was broadcast on BBC Radio 2, while the final was broadcast on BBC One.

==== Competing entries ====
On 31 July 2001, BBC together with the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA) announced an open submission for interested songwriters to submit their songs. All composers and lyricists were required to be British citizens or residents in the United Kingdom for three years prior to the Eurovision Song Contest 2002. A fee was also imposed on songs being submitted to the national final: £47 for BASCA members, £70.5 for non-BASCA members and £11.75 for songwriters under the age of 17 by 1 May 2002. The submission period lasted until 19 October 2001. More than 550 received submissions were reviewed by various panels of music publishers, songwriters and record label professionals, following which a 20-song shortlist was compiled by BASCA and presented to the BBC which ultimately selected eight semi-finalists to compete in the national final in December 2001. The eight competing songs were premiered during &quot;The Ken Bruce Show&quot; and &quot;Wake Up to Wogan&quot; on BBC Radio 2 between 28 and 31 January 2002.

==== Shows ====

====Semi-final====
Eight acts competed in the radio semi-final which was hosted by Terry Wogan and Ken Bruce during &quot;Wake Up to Wogan&quot; on 1 February 2002. A public vote consisting of televoting and online voting, which registered over 20,000 votes, selected the top four songs that proceeded to the final. Before the semi-final, the public was able to cast their votes online starting from 28 January 2002. 

On 6 February 2002, the BBC announced that one of the finalists, &quot;Never in a Million Years&quot; performed by Zee, had been disqualified as the song was published on a compilation album in Hungary in June 2001. &quot;Every Step of the Way&quot; performed by Level Best, which came fifth in the semi-final, was selected as the replacement finalist. Another semi-finalist, &quot;Lovestruck&quot; performed by Honey Trap, was also set to be discussed by the BBC regarding a potential disqualification as it was claimed to be almost identical to a song with the same title, performed by Swedish singer Kinnda. The song was eventually not disqualified as it was ultimately eliminated from the semi-final.

====Final====
Four acts competed in the televised final on 3 March 2002 which was held at the BBC Elstree Centre in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire and hosted by Claire Sweeney and Christopher Price. A public televote selected the winner, &quot;Come Back&quot; performed by Jessica Garlick. The televote in the final registered 107,298 votes.

==At Eurovision==

The Eurovision Song Contest 2002 took place at Saku Suurhall in Tallinn, Estonia, on 25 May 2002. The participants list included the previous year&#x27;s winning country, the &quot;Big Four&quot; countries (France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom), the sixteen highest-scoring participating countries in the previous year&#x27;s contest and any non-participating countries in the previous year&#x27;s contest, up to 24 participants in total. As a member of the &quot;Big Four&quot;, the United Kingdom automatically qualified to compete in the contest. On 9 November 2001, an allocation draw was held which determined the running order and the United Kingdom was set to perform in position 2, following the entry from and before the entry from . The United Kingdom finished in third place scoring 111 points.

In the United Kingdom, the contest was televised on BBC One with commentary by Terry Wogan, on BBC Choice with commentary by Jenny Eclair, and on BBC Radio 2 with commentary by Ken Bruce. Christopher Price was initially announced as the commentator on BBC Choice (as part of the programme &quot;Liquid Eurovision Party&quot;), however he was replaced by Eclair following his death a month before the contest. The BBC appointed Colin Berry as its spokesperson to announce the results of the British televote during the show.

<text>Harvey Lawrence Pekar (; October 8, 1939 – July 12, 2010) was an American underground comic book writer, music critic, and media personality, best known for his autobiographical &quot;American Splendor&quot; comic series. In 2003, the series inspired a well-received film adaptation of the same name.

Frequently described as the &quot;poet laureate of Cleveland&quot;, Pekar &quot;helped change the appreciation for, and perceptions of, the graphic novel, the drawn memoir, the autobiographical comic narrative.&quot; Pekar described his work as &quot;autobiography written as it&#x27;s happening. The theme is about staying alive, getting a job, finding a mate, having a place to live, finding a creative outlet. Life is a war of attrition. You have to stay active on all fronts. It&#x27;s one thing after another. I&#x27;ve tried to control a chaotic universe. And it&#x27;s a losing battle. But I can&#x27;t let go. I&#x27;ve tried, but I can&#x27;t.&quot;

Among the awards given to Pekar for his work were the Inkpot Award, the American Book Award, a Harvey Award, and his posthumous induction into the Eisner Award Hall of Fame.

==Life==
Harvey Pekar and his younger brother Allen were born in Cleveland, Ohio, to a Jewish family. Their parents were Saul and Dora Pekar, immigrants from Białystok, Poland. Saul Pekar was a Talmudic scholar who owned a grocery store on Kinsman Avenue, with the family living above the store. Although Pekar said he wasn&#x27;t close to his parents due to their dissimilar backgrounds and because they worked all the time, he still &quot;marveled at how devoted they were to each other. They had so much love and admiration for one another.&quot;

Pekar&#x27;s first language as a child was Yiddish and he learned to read and appreciate novels in the language.

Pekar said he did not have friends for the first few years of his life. The neighborhood he lived in had once been all white but became mostly black by the 1940s. One of the few white children living there, Pekar was often beaten up. He later believed this instilled in him &quot;a profound sense of inferiority.&quot; This experience, however, also taught him to become a &quot;respected street scrapper.&quot;

Pekar graduated from Shaker Heights High School in 1957. He then briefly served in the United States Navy. After being discharged he attended Case Western Reserve University, where he dropped out after a year. He worked odd jobs before he was hired as file clerk at the Veterans Administration Hospital in 1965. He held this job after becoming famous, refusing all promotions, until he retired in 2001.

Pekar was married three times. He was married from 1960 to 1972 to his first wife, Karen Delaney. According to fellow cartoonist R. Crumb, who knew the couple socially, &quot;She left him... She took all the money out of their bank account and ran off... Never heard from her again.&quot;

His second wife was Helen Lark Hall, who appeared (as &quot;Lark&quot;) in a number of early issues of &quot;American Splendor&quot;. They married in 1977. According to Crumb again (and as dramatized in the &quot;American Splendor&quot; film), &quot;...she was trying to have a career in academia and Harvey would embarrass her. They&#x27;d go to these academic cocktail parties and Harvey would deliberately antagonize these professors. He thought the whole academia thing was bullshit. So he used to embarrass her and she&#x27;d become angry at him until finally she gave up on him.&quot; They divorced in 1981.

Pekar&#x27;s third wife, whom he married in 1984, was writer Joyce Brabner who became a regular character in &quot;American Splendor&quot; and to whom he remained married until his death.

In 1990, as described by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, &quot;Pekar was diagnosed with lymphoma and needed chemotherapy. By the time the disease was discovered, the couple was in the midst of buying a house (a tremendous worry to Pekar, who fretted about both the money and corruptions of bourgeois creature comforts).&quot; After Pekar&#x27;s recovery, he and Brabner collaborated on &quot;Our Cancer Year&quot; (released in 1994), a graphic novel account of that experience, as well as his harrowing yet successful treatment.

Around this same time, Brabner and Pekar became guardians of a young girl, Danielle Batone, when she was nine years old. Danielle became the couple&#x27;s foster daughter and eventually became a recurring character in &quot;American Splendor&quot; as well.

Pekar lived in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, with Brabner and Batone.

==Career==

=== Early comics work ===
Pekar&#x27;s friendship with Robert Crumb led to the creation of the self-published, autobiographical comic book series &quot;American Splendor&quot;. Crumb and Pekar became friends through their shared love of jazz records. It took Pekar a decade to do so: &quot;I theorized for maybe ten years about doing comics.&quot; Pekar&#x27;s influences from the literary world included James Joyce, Arthur Miller, George Ade, Henry Roth, and Daniel Fuchs.

Around 1972, Pekar laid out some stories with crude stick figures and showed them to Crumb and another artist, Robert Armstrong. Impressed, they both offered to illustrate. Pekar &amp; Crumb&#x27;s one-pager &quot;Crazy Ed&quot; was published as the back cover of Crumb&#x27;s &quot;The People&#x27;s Comics&quot; (Golden Gate Publishing Company, 1972), becoming Pekar&#x27;s first published work of comics. Including &quot;Crazy Ed&quot; and before the publication of &quot;American Splendor&quot; #1, Pekar wrote a number of other comic stories that were published in a variety of outlets:
* &quot;Crazy Ed&quot;, with Robert Crumb, in &quot;The People&#x27;s Comics&quot; (Golden Gate Publishing Company, 1972)
* &quot;A Mexican Tale,&quot; with Greg Budgett and Munan, in &quot;Flaming Baloney X&quot; (Propaganda Ink, c. 1975)
* &quot;It Pays to Advertise&quot; with Willy Murphy, in &quot;Flamed-Out Funnies&quot; #1 (Keith Green, Aug. 1975)
* &quot;Ain&#x27; It the Truth&quot; with Willy Murphy, in &quot;Flamed-Out Funnies&quot; #1 (Keith Green, Aug. 1975)
* &quot;The Boys on the Corner: A Good Shit Is Best&quot; with Willy Murphy, in &quot;Flamed-Out Funnies&quot; #1 (Keith Green, Aug. 1975)
* &quot;The Kinsman Cowboys: How&#x27;d Ya Get Inta This Bizness Ennyway?&quot; with Greg Budgett &amp; Gary Dumm, in &quot;Bizarre Sex&quot; #4 (Kitchen Sink Press, Oct. 1975)
* &quot;Famous Street Fights: The Champ&quot; with Robert Armstrong in &quot;Comix Book&quot; #4 (Kitchen Sink Press, Feb. 1976)
* &quot;Don&#x27;t Rain on My Parade&quot; with Robert Armstrong in &quot;Snarf&quot; #6 (Kitchen Sink Press, Feb. 1976)

===&quot;American Splendor&quot;===

The first issue of Pekar&#x27;s self-published &quot;American Splendor&quot; series appeared in May 1976, with stories illustrated by Crumb, Dumm, Budgett, and Brian Bram. Applying the &quot;brutally frank autobiographical style of Henry Miller,&quot; &quot;American Splendor&quot; documented Pekar&#x27;s daily life in the aging neighborhoods of his native Cleveland.

Pekar and his work came to greater prominence in 1986 when Doubleday collected much of the material from the first ten issues in &quot;American Splendor: The Life and Times of Harvey Pekar&quot;, which was positively reviewed by, among others, &quot;The New York Times&quot;. (1986 was also the year Pekar began appearing on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;.)

Pekar self-published 15 issues of &quot;American Splendor&quot; from 1976 to 1991 (issue #16 was co-published with Tundra Publishing). Dark Horse Comics took on the publishing and distribution of Pekar&#x27;s comics from 1993 to 2003.

In 2006, Pekar released a four-issue &quot;American Splendor&quot; miniseries through the DC Comics imprint Vertigo Comics. This was collected in the &quot;American Splendor: Another Day&quot; paperback. In 2008 Vertigo released a second four-issue &quot;season&quot; of &quot;American Splendor&quot; that was later collected in the &quot;American Splendor: Another Dollar&quot; paperback.

Pekar&#x27;s best-known and longest-running collaborators include Crumb, Dumm, Budgett, Spain Rodriguez, Joe Zabel, Gerry Shamray, Frank Stack, Mark Zingarelli, and Joe Sacco. In the 2000s, he teamed regularly with artists Dean Haspiel and Josh Neufeld. Other cartoonists who worked with him include Jim Woodring, Chester Brown, Alison Bechdel, Gilbert Hernandez, Eddie Campbell, David Collier, Drew Friedman, Ho Che Anderson, Rick Geary, Ed Piskor, Hunt Emerson, Bob Fingerman, and Alex Wald; as well as such non-traditional illustrators as Pekar&#x27;s wife, Joyce Brabner, and comics writer Alan Moore.

In addition to his autobiographical work on &quot;American Splendor&quot;, Pekar wrote a number of biographies. The first of these, &quot;American Splendor: Unsung Hero&quot; (Dark Horse Comics, 2003), illustrated by David Collier, documented the Vietnam War experience of Robert McNeill, one of Pekar&#x27;s African-American coworkers at Cleveland&#x27;s VA hospital.

Stories from the &quot;American Splendor&quot; comics have been collected in many books and anthologies.

===&quot;American Splendor&quot; film===

A film adaptation of &quot;American Splendor&quot; was released in 2003, directed by Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman. It starred Paul Giamatti as Pekar, as well as appearances by Pekar himself (and his wife Joyce, foster daughter Danielle, and co-worker Toby Radloff). &quot;American Splendor&quot; won the Grand Jury Prize for Dramatic Film at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival, in addition to the award for Best Adapted Screenplay from the Writers Guild of America. At the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, the film received the FIPRESCI critics award. &quot;American Splendor&quot; was given the Guardian New Directors Award at the 2003 Edinburgh International Film Festival. It was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 2003 Academy Awards. Pekar wrote about the effects of the film in &quot;American Splendor: Our Movie Year&quot;.

===Other comics work===

On October 5, 2005, the DC Comics imprint Vertigo published Pekar&#x27;s autobiographical hardcover &quot;The Quitter&quot;, with artwork by Dean Haspiel. The book detailed Pekar&#x27;s early years.

In 2006, Ballantine/Random House published his biography &quot;Ego &amp; Hubris: The Michael Malice Story&quot; about the life of Michael Malice, founding editor of &quot;Overheard in New York&quot;. In June 2007, Pekar collaborated with student Heather Roberson and artist Ed Piskor on the book &quot;Macedonia&quot;, which centers on Roberson&#x27;s studies in that country. In January 2008 the biographical &quot;Students for a Democratic Society: A Graphic History&quot; was published by Hill &amp; Wang. In March 2009, he published &quot;The Beats: A Graphic History&quot;, a history of the Beat Generation, including Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, illustrated by Ed Piskor. In May 2009 he published &quot;Studs Terkel&#x27;s Working: A Graphic Adaptation&quot;.

In 2010, Pekar started the webcomic &quot;The Pekar Project&quot; with the online magazine &quot;Smith&quot;. In 2011, Abrams Comicarts published &quot;Yiddishkeit&quot;, co-edited by Pekar with Paul Buhle and Hershl Hartman. The book depicts aspects of Yiddish language and culture. Artists in this anthology include many of Pekar&#x27;s previous collaborators.

=== Critical writing ===
Pekar was an assiduous record collector as well as a freelance book, comic, and jazz critic, writing mainly about significant figures from jazz&#x27;s golden age but also championing out-of-mainstream artists such as Scott Fields, Fred Frith and Joe Maneri. He published his first criticism in &quot;The Jazz Review&quot; in 1959. Pekar wrote hundreds of articles for &quot;DownBeat&quot;, &quot;JazzTimes&quot;, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, and &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;; as well as liner notes for Verve Records and other labels.

Pekar occasionally wrote criticism about the work of other comics creators. For instance, he famously saw Art Spiegelman&#x27;s use of animals in &quot;Maus&quot; as potentially reinforcing stereotypes. Pekar was also disdainful of Spiegelman&#x27;s overwhelmingly negative portrayal of his father in &quot;Maus&quot;, calling him disingenuous and hypocritical for such a portrayal in a book that presents itself as objective. Pekar furthermore wrote that &quot;Maus&quot;&#x27; portrayal of Poles is unbalanced — that, while some Poles are seen as helping Jews, they are often shown doing so for self-serving reasons. From 1986 to 1990, Pekar had a regular column in the comics anthology &quot;Weirdo&quot; called &quot;Harvey Sez,&quot; in which he wrote about the contemporary comics scene. 

He reviewed literary fiction in the &quot;Review of Contemporary Fiction&quot;. Pekar won awards for his essays broadcast on public radio.

==Theater, music and media appearances==
Pekar&#x27;s comic book success led to a guest appearance on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; on October 15, 1986. Pekar was invited back repeatedly and made five more appearances in quick succession. These appearances became notable for the increasing hostility and verbal altercations between Pekar and Letterman, particularly on the subject of General Electric&#x27;s ownership of NBC. The most heated of these was in the August 31, 1988, episode of &quot;Late Night&quot;, in which Pekar accused Letterman of appearing to be a shill for General Electric and Letterman promised never to invite Pekar back on the show. Despite the ban, more than four years later Pekar appeared on &quot;Late Night&quot; again — on April 20, 1993, and he made a final appearance on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on May 16, 1994. After Pekar&#x27;s death, Letterman reflected in 2017 that...

Pekar appeared in Alan Zweig&#x27;s 2000 documentary film about record collecting, &quot;Vinyl&quot;. In August 2007, Pekar was featured on the Cleveland episode of &quot;Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations&quot; with host Anthony Bourdain.

While there had been earlier &quot;American Splendor&quot; theater adaptations, in 2009, Pekar made his theatrical debut with &quot;Leave Me Alone!&quot;, a jazz opera for which he wrote the libretto. &quot;Leave Me Alone!&quot; featured music by Dan Plonsey and was co-produced by Real Time Opera and Oberlin College, premiering at Finney Chapel on January 31, 2009.

In 2009, Pekar was featured in &quot;The Cartoonist,&quot; a documentary film on the life and work of Jeff Smith, creator of &quot;Bone.&quot;

==Death and work released posthumously==

Shortly before 1 a.m. on July 12, 2010, Pekar&#x27;s wife found Pekar dead in their Cleveland Heights, Ohio, home. No immediate cause was determined. In October the Cuyahoga County coroner&#x27;s office ruled it was an accidental overdose of antidepressants fluoxetine and bupropion. Pekar had been diagnosed with cancer for the third time and was about to undergo treatment.

Pekar was interred at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland. His headstone features one of his quotations as an epitaph: &quot;Life is about women, gigs, an&#x27; bein&#x27; creative.&quot;

Some Pekar works were to be released posthumously, including two collaborations with Joyce Brabner, &quot;The Big Book of Marriage&quot; and &quot;Harvey and Joyce Plumb the Depths of Depression&quot;, as well as a collection of the webcomics that ran as a part of &quot;The Pekar Project&quot;. As of 2019, however, none of those projects have yet seen print. Working with illustrator Summer McClinton, Pekar, politically a leftist, also finished a book on American Marxist Louis Proyect tentatively called &quot;The Unrepentant Marxist&quot;, after Proyect&#x27;s blog. In the works since 2008, the book was to be published by Random House. After a conflict between Proyect and Joyce Brabner, Brabner announced that she would hold the book back indefinitely.

In December 2010, the last story Pekar wrote, &quot;Harvey Pekar Meets the Thing&quot;, in which Pekar has a conversation with Ben Grimm, was published in the Marvel Comics anthology &quot;Strange Tales II&quot;; the story was illustrated by Ty Templeton.

One of his final graphic memoirs was &quot;Not the Israel My Parents Promised Me&quot; (2013) in which he explains how he lost his faith in the Jewish state. It was illustrated by JT Waldman and the epilogue was penned by his widow, Joyce Brabner.

==Legacy==

Frequently described as the &quot;poet laureate of Cleveland,&quot; Pekar &quot;helped change the appreciation for, and perceptions of, the graphic novel, the drawn memoir, the autobiographical comic narrative.&quot;

According to Los Angeles Times columnist David Ulin, &quot;American Splendor&quot; &quot;remains one of the most compelling and transformative series in the history of comics.&quot; In addition, Pekar was the first author to publicly distribute &quot;memoir comic books.&quot; While it is common today for people to publicly write about their lives on blogs, social media platforms, and in graphic novels, &quot;In the mid-seventies, Harvey Pekar was doing all this before it was ubiquitous and commercialized.&quot;

In October 2012 a statue of Pekar was installed at the Cleveland Heights-University Heights Library, a place he visited almost daily.

On July 25, 2015, the city of Cleveland Heights, Ohio dedicated the corner of Northwest Coventry Road and Euclid Heights Boulevard to the life and legacy of Harvey Pekar. This area is now known as Harvey Pekar Park.

<text>The  (; English: &quot;Gaeldom&quot;) usually refers to the Highlands and Islands of Scotland and especially the Scottish Gaelic-speaking culture of the area. The similar Irish language word refers, however, solely to Irish-speaking areas.

The term is also used to apply to areas of Nova Scotia and Glengarry County, Ontario where the distinctive Canadian dialects of Scottish Gaelic were or are still spoken.

&quot;The &quot; is not interchangeable with &quot;Scottish Highlands&quot; as it refers to the language and not to the geography. Also, many parts of the Highlands no longer have substantial Gaelic-speaking populations, and some parts of what is now thought of as the Highlands have long been Scots-speaking or English-speaking areas such as Cromarty, Grantown-on-Spey, etc. Conversely, several Gaelic-speaking communities lie outwith the Highland, Argyll and Bute and Outer Hebrides council areas, for example the Isle of Arran and parts of Perth and Kinross, not to mention Nova Scotia, North Carolina, and other areas to which there was significant migration. also increasingly refers to any region where Scottish Gaelic is spoken as a first language by much of the population.. However, is sometimes used to refer to the Scottish Highlands, by organisations such as Highlands and Islands Enterprise () and the Highland Council ().

 (&#x27;-dom&#x27;, referring to a non-Gael) is often used for the Lowlands, although it is also notable that the Hebrides are known as due to the historical presence of Norsemen.

==History==
Until a few centuries ago, the would have included much of modern-day Scotland north of the Firth of Forth and Galloway (up until the 18th century, and maybe later), excepting the Northern Isles, as evidenced by the prevalence of Gaelic-derived place names throughout most of Scotland and contemporary accounts. These include Dundee from the Gaelic , Inverness from , Argyll from , Galloway from , and possibly Stirling from (though the etymology is uncertain). Gaelic speakers from what would be considered traditionally English-speaking/non-Gaelic regions today included George Buchanan (from Stirlingshire), Robert the Bruce (from Galloway), and Margaret McMurray (from Ayrshire).

For historical reasons, including the influence of a Scots-speaking court in Edinburgh and the plantation of merchant burghs in much of the south and east, the has been reduced massively to the present region of the Outer Hebrides, the Northwest Highlands, Skye and Loch Alsh, and Argyll and Bute, with small Gaelic populations existing in Glasgow and Edinburgh. The Highland Clearances of the 18th and 19th centuries also contributed to the decline of the language, as they reduced the population of the Scottish Highlands, which were predominantly Gaelic-speaking at the time.

==Canadian &quot;Gàidhealtachd&quot;==

In Canada, at one time Scottish Gaelic was the third most spoken language after English and French; in 1901, there were 50,000 speakers in Nova Scotia alone.

It has survived as a minority language among communities descended from Scottish immigrants in parts of Nova Scotia (especially Cape Breton Island), Glengarry County in present-day Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador.) The Codroy Valley on the island of Newfoundland had a Gaelic-speaking minority until the 1960s.

<text>General elections were held in Denmark on 11 March 1998. Although the centre-right parties led by Venstre had been expected to win, the Social Democratic Party-led government of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen remained in power in a very close vote that required several recounts.

Venstre leader Uffe Ellemann-Jensen resigned as party leader a few days after the election. The new Danish People&#x27;s Party made a successful electoral debut. Voter turnout was 85.9% in Denmark proper, 66.1% in the Faroe Islands and 63.2% in Greenland.

<doc id="478601" wikidata="Q6692743" url="?curid=478601" title="Low-discrepancy sequence">
<text>In mathematics, a low-discrepancy sequence is a sequence with the property that for all values of formula_1, its subsequence formula_2 has a low discrepancy.

Roughly speaking, the discrepancy of a sequence is low if the proportion of points in the sequence falling into an arbitrary set &quot;B&quot; is close to proportional to the measure of &quot;B&quot;, as would happen on average (but not for particular samples) in the case of an equidistributed sequence. Specific definitions of discrepancy differ regarding the choice of &quot;B&quot; (hyperspheres, hypercubes, etc.) and how the discrepancy for every B is computed (usually normalized) and combined (usually by taking the worst value).

Low-discrepancy sequences are also called quasirandom sequences, due to their common use as a replacement of uniformly distributed random numbers.
The &quot;quasi&quot; modifier is used to denote more clearly that the values of a low-discrepancy sequence are neither random nor pseudorandom, but such sequences share some properties of random variables and in certain applications such as the quasi-Monte Carlo method their lower discrepancy is an important advantage.

==Applications==

Quasirandom numbers have an advantage over pure random numbers in that they cover the domain of interest quickly and evenly.

Two useful applications are in finding the characteristic function of a probability density function, and in finding the derivative function of a deterministic function with a small amount of noise. Quasirandom numbers allow higher-order moments to be calculated to high accuracy very quickly.

Applications that don&#x27;t involve sorting would be in finding the mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of a statistical distribution, and in finding the integral and global maxima and minima of difficult deterministic functions. Quasirandom numbers can also be used for providing starting points for deterministic algorithms that only work locally, such as Newton–Raphson iteration.

Quasirandom numbers can also be combined with search algorithms. With a search algorithm, quasirandom numbers can be used to find the mode, median, confidence intervals and cumulative distribution of a statistical distribution, and all local minima and all solutions of deterministic functions.

=== Low-discrepancy sequences in numerical integration ===

Various methods of numerical integration can be phrased as approximating the integral of a function formula_3 in some interval, e.g. [0,1], as the average of the function evaluated at a set formula_4 in that interval:
:formula_5

If the points are chosen as formula_6, this is the &quot;rectangle rule&quot;.
If the points are chosen to be randomly (or pseudorandomly) distributed, this is the &quot;Monte Carlo method&quot;.
If the points are chosen as elements of a low-discrepancy sequence, this is the &quot;quasi-Monte Carlo method&quot;.
A remarkable result, the Koksma–Hlawka inequality (stated below), shows that the error of such a method can be bounded by the product of two terms, one of which depends only on formula_3, and the other one is the discrepancy of the set formula_4.

It is convenient to construct the set formula_4 in such a way that if a set with formula_10 elements is constructed, the previous formula_1 elements need not be recomputed.
The rectangle rule uses points set which have low discrepancy, but in general the elements must be recomputed if formula_1 is increased.
Elements need not be recomputed in the random Monte Carlo method if formula_1 is increased,
but the point sets do not have minimal discrepancy.
By using low-discrepancy sequences we aim for low discrepancy and no need for recomputations, but actually low-discrepancy sequences can only be incrementally good on discrepancy if we allow no recomputation.

==Definition of discrepancy==

The &quot;discrepancy&quot; of a set formula_14 is defined, using Niederreiter&#x27;s notation, as
:formula_15

where formula_16 is the formula_17-dimensional Lebesgue measure,
formula_18 is the number of points in formula_19 that fall into formula_20,
and formula_21 is the set of formula_17-dimensional intervals or boxes of the form

:formula_23

where formula_24.

The &quot;star-discrepancy&quot; formula_25 is defined similarly, except that the supremum is taken over the set formula_26 of rectangular boxes of the form

:formula_27

where formula_28 is in the half-open interval [0, 1).

The two are related by

:formula_29

&quot;Note&quot;: With these definitions, discrepancy represents the worst-case or maximum point density deviation of a uniform set. However, also other error measures are meaningful, leading to other definitions and variation measures. For instance, formula_30-discrepancy or modified centered formula_30-discrepancy are also used intensively to compare the quality of uniform point sets. Both are much easier to calculate for large formula_1 and formula_17.

==The Koksma–Hlawka inequality==

Let formula_34 be the formula_17-dimensional unit cube,
formula_36.
Let formula_3 have bounded variation formula_38 on formula_34 in the sense of Hardy and Krause.
Then for any formula_2
in formula_41,

: formula_42
The Koksma–Hlawka inequality is sharp in the following sense: For any point set formula_43 in formula_44 and any formula_45, there is a function formula_3 with bounded variation and formula_47 such that

:formula_48

Therefore, the quality of a numerical integration rule depends only on the discrepancy formula_49.

==The formula of Hlawka–Zaremba==

Let formula_50. For formula_51 we
write
:formula_52
and denote by formula_53 the point obtained from &quot;x&quot; by replacing the
coordinates not in &quot;u&quot; by formula_54. Then

:formula_55

where formula_56 is the discrepancy function.

==The &quot;L2&quot; version of the Koksma–Hlawka inequality==

Applying the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality for integrals and sums to the Hlawka–Zaremba identity, we obtain an formula_30 version of the Koksma–Hlawka inequality:

: formula_58

where

:formula_59

and

:formula_60

formula_30 discrepancy has a high practical importance because fast explicit calculations are possible for a given point set. This way it is easy to create point set optimizers using formula_30 discrepancy as criteria.

==The Erdős–Turán–Koksma inequality==

It is computationally hard to find the exact value of the discrepancy of large point sets. The Erdős–Turán–Koksma inequality provides an upper bound.

Let formula_63 be points in formula_44 and formula_65 be an arbitrary positive integer. Then

:formula_66

where

:formula_67

==The main conjectures==

Conjecture 1. There is a constant formula_68 depending only on the dimension formula_17, such that 
:formula_70 
for any finite point set formula_71. 

Conjecture 2. There is a constant formula_72 depending only on :formula_17, such that:formula_74 

for infinite number of formula_1 for any infinite sequence formula_76. 

These conjectures are equivalent. They have been proved for formula_77 by W. M. Schmidt. In higher dimensions, the corresponding problem is still open. The best-known lower bounds are due to Michael Lacey and collaborators.

==Lower bounds==

Let formula_78. Then

:formula_79

for any finite point set formula_4.

Let formula_81. W. M. Schmidt proved that for any finite point set formula_4,

:formula_83

where

:formula_84

For arbitrary dimensionsformula_85, K. F. Roth proved that

:formula_86

for any finite point set formula_4. 
Jozef Beck established a double log improvement of this result in three dimensions. 
This was improved by D. Bilyk and M. T. Lacey to a power of a single logarithm. The best known bound for &quot;s&quot; &gt; 2 is due
D. Bilyk and M. T. Lacey and A. Vagharshakyan. For formula_4 there is a formula_89 so that 
:formula_90

for any finite point set formula_4.

==Construction of low-discrepancy sequences==

Because any distribution of random numbers can be mapped onto a uniform distribution, and quasirandom numbers are mapped in the same way, this article only concerns generation of quasirandom numbers on a multidimensional uniform distribution.

There are constructions of sequences known such that
:formula_92
where formula_93 is a certain constant, depending on the sequence. After Conjecture 2, these sequences are believed to have the best possible order of convergence. Examples below are the van der Corput sequence, the Halton sequences, and the Sobol’ sequences. One general limitation is that construction methods can usually only guarantee the order of convergence. Practically, low discrepancy can be only achieved if formula_1 is large enough, and for large given s this minimum formula_1 can be very large. This means running a Monte-Carlo analysis with e.g. formula_96 variables and formula_97 points from a low-discrepancy sequence generator may offer only a very minor accuracy improvement .

===Random numbers===

Sequences of quasirandom numbers can be generated from random numbers by imposing a negative correlation on those random numbers. One way to do this is to start with a set of random numbers formula_98 on formula_99 and construct quasirandom numbers formula_100 which are uniform on formula_101 using:

formula_102 for formula_103 odd and formula_104 for formula_103 even.

A second way to do it with the starting random numbers is to construct a random walk with offset 0.5 as in:

: formula_106

That is, take the previous quasirandom number, add 0.5 and the random number, and take the result modulo 1.

For more than one dimension, Latin squares of the appropriate dimension can be used to provide offsets to ensure that the whole domain is covered evenly.

===Additive recurrence===

For any irrational formula_107, the sequence

: formula_108

has discrepancy tending to formula_109. Note that the sequence can be defined recursively by
: formula_110

A good value of formula_107 gives lower discrepancy than a sequence of independent uniform random numbers.

The discrepancy can be bounded by the approximation exponent of formula_107. If the approximation exponent is formula_113, then for any formula_45, the following bound holds:

: formula_115

By the Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem, the approximation exponent of any irrational algebraic number is 2, giving a bound of formula_116 above.

The recurrence relation above is similar to the recurrence relation used by a linear congruential generator, a poor-quality pseudorandom number generator:

: formula_117

For the low discrepancy additive recurrence above, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;m&quot; are chosen to be 1. Note, however, that this will not generate independent random numbers, so should not be used for purposes requiring independence. 

The value of formula_118 with lowest discrepancy is the fractional part of the golden ratio:

: formula_119

Another value that is nearly as good is the fractional part of the silver ratio, which is the fractional part of the square root of 2:

: formula_120

In more than one dimension, separate quasirandom numbers are needed for each dimension. A convenient set of values that are used, is the square roots of primes from two up, all taken modulo 1:

: formula_121

However, a set of values based on the generalised golden ratio has been shown to produce more evenly distributed points. 

The list of pseudorandom number generators lists methods for generating independent pseudorandom numbers.
&quot;Note&quot;: In few dimensions, recursive recurrence leads to uniform sets of good quality, but for larger formula_17 (like formula_123) other point set generators can offer much lower discrepancies.

===van der Corput sequence===
Let

:formula_124

be the formula_125-ary representation of the positive integer formula_126, i.e. formula_127. Set

:formula_128

Then there is a constant formula_93 depending only on formula_125 such that formula_131 satisfies

:formula_132

where formula_133 is the 
star discrepancy.

===Halton sequence===

The Halton sequence is a natural generalization of the van der Corput sequence to higher dimensions. Let &quot;s&quot; be an arbitrary dimension and &quot;b&quot;1, ..., &quot;b&quot;&quot;s&quot; be arbitrary coprime integers greater than 1. Define

:formula_134

Then there is a constant &quot;C&quot; depending only on &quot;b&quot;1, ..., &quot;b&quot;&quot;s&quot;, such that sequence {&quot;x&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)}&quot;n&quot;≥1 is a &quot;s&quot;-dimensional sequence with

:formula_135

===Hammersley set===
Let formula_136 be coprime positive integers greater than 1. For given formula_17 and formula_1, the formula_17-dimensional Hammersley set of size formula_1 is defined by

:formula_141

for formula_142. Then

:formula_143

where formula_93 is a constant depending only on formula_145.

&quot;Note&quot;: The formulas show that the Hammersley set is actually the Halton sequence, but we get one more dimension for free by adding a linear sweep. This is only possible if formula_1 is known upfront. A linear set is also the set with lowest possible one-dimensional discrepancy in general. Unfortunately, for higher dimensions, no such &quot;discrepancy record sets&quot; are known. For formula_81, most low-discrepancy point set generators deliver at least near-optimum discrepancies.

===Sobol sequence===
The Antonov–Saleev variant of the Sobol’ sequence generates numbers between zero and one directly as binary fractions of length formula_148 from a set of formula_149 special binary fractions, formula_150 called direction numbers. The bits of the Gray code of formula_103, formula_152, are used to select direction numbers. To get the Sobol’ sequence value formula_100 take the exclusive or of the binary value of the Gray code of formula_103 with the appropriate direction number. The number of dimensions required affects the choice of formula_155.

=== Poisson disk sampling ===

Poisson disk sampling is popular in video games to rapidly place objects in a way that appears random-looking
but guarantees that every two points are separated by at least the specified minimum distance. This does not guarantee low discrepancy (as e. g. Sobol’), but at least a significantly lower discrepancy than pure random sampling. The goal of these sampling patterns is based on frequency analysis rather than discrepancy, a type of so-called &quot;blue noise&quot; patterns.

==Graphical examples==
The points plotted below are the first 100, 1000, and 10000 elements in a sequence of the Sobol&#x27; type.
For comparison, 10000 elements of a sequence of pseudorandom points are also shown.
The low-discrepancy sequence was generated by TOMS algorithm 659.
An implementation of the algorithm in Fortran is available from Netlib.

<doc id="478602" wikidata="Q3750832" url="?curid=478602" title="Slouch hat">
<text>A slouch hat is a wide-brimmed felt or cloth hat most commonly worn as part of a military uniform, often, although not always, with a chinstrap. It has been worn by military personnel from many different nations including Australia, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Canada, Nepal, India, New Zealand, Southern Rhodesia, France, the United States, the Confederate States, Germany and many others. Australia and New Zealand have had various models of slouch hat as standard issue headwear since the late Victorian period.

Today it is worn by military personnel from a number of countries, although it is primarily associated with Australia, where it is considered to be a national symbol. The distinctive Australian slouch hat, sometimes called an &quot;Australian bush hat&quot; or &quot;digger hat&quot;, has one side of the brim turned up or pinned to the side of the hat with a Rising Sun Badge in order to allow a rifle to be slung over the shoulder. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles wore a similar headdress but with the New Zealand military badge attached to the front of the cloth band (puggaree) wound around the base of the hat&#x27;s crown.

In the United States it was also called the Kossuth hat, after Lajos Kossuth. During the American Civil War (1861–65) the headgear was common among both Confederate and Union troops in the Western Theater, although not always with its brim turned up at the side. During the Spanish–American War, as commander of the Rough Riders, Colonel Theodore Roosevelt became known for wearing a slouch hat.

==History==
The name &quot;slouch hat&quot; refers to the fact that one side droops down as opposed to the other which is pinned against the side of the crown. This style of hat has been worn for many hundreds of years, especially during the English Civil War during the 17th century when it became associated with the forces of King Charles I, the Cavaliers, but it was also fashionable for the aristocracy throughout Europe during that time until it developed into the cocked hat with two (bicorn) or three (tricorn) points.

It was introduced into Australia around 1885, although it traces its military use back to Austrian skirmishers. The modern slouch hat is derived from the black &quot;Corsican hat&quot; (Korsehut) – historically used in the Austrian army during the Napoleonic Wars. The headwear saw primary use by 15 battalions of Austrian Jägers (skirmishers) and it featured an upturned brim, leather chinstrap and feather plume. The regular infantry also saw limited use of the Corsican hat in the periods 1803–06 and 1811–36.

A shortage of cork helmets led to the widespread use of the slouch hat amongst British Empire forces during the Second Boer War, where it was used by units including the City Imperial Volunteers (CIV), Imperial Yeomanry, and King Edward&#x27;s Horse. An 1884 painting displayed in the regimental museum of the pipe band of 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders shows the unit in service dress, crossing the veldt in Zululand, wearing khaki slouch hats. After the war many armies rejected the once-popular headwear (as the British Army did in 1905), although it came back into fashion briefly during World War II during the Burma campaign and amongst troops serving in India and Southeast Asia at this time.

The slouch hat in gray felt was worn by the Schutztruppe (protection force), the colonial armed force of Imperial Germany, as an alternative to the pith helmet, especially in South West Africa. Different coloured were worn by the Germans in South West Africa, German East Africa, German West Africa (Togo and Cameroon), German New Guinea and China. The hat had its brim pinned up on the right side with a cockade in the national colors and was worn with the home uniform as well. German colonial police units in South West Africa wore a khaki slouch hat with a small national cockade on the front and the right side pinned up by a metal Imperial crown device.

It became associated with the Australian military around the end of the 19th century, and since World War I it has been manufactured in Australia for the Australian Army by companies such as Akubra, Mountcastle &amp; Sons and Bardsley Hats. The Australian military still wear the slouch hat with a Unit Colour Patch to identify their unit, and it has become a national symbol in Australia.
The slouch hat or Terai hat is also associated with the Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger (Dutch East Indies Army). It is worn by Gurkha regiments of the British Army and Indian Army (formerly the British Indian Army), but no longer worn on active service. The 2nd Gurkha Rifles became the first Gurkha regiment to adopt the slouch hat when they were issued with the Australian variant in 1901. The Gurkha terai hat is created by fusing two hats into one to make the hat more rigid and is worn at an angle, tilted to the right. The Chindits and other units of Field Marshal William Slim&#x27;s British Fourteenth Army, who fought against the Japanese in the Far East during World War II, also became associated with the slouch hat (also known as the bush hat in the British Army). The slouch hat was also used by colonial units of the British Empire, including the Royal West African Frontier Force, the Canadian Yukon Field Force, Canadian Pacific Railway Militia, the Kenya Regiment and troops from Rhodesia.

===Australia===

The slouch hat was first worn by military forces in Australia in 1885 when the newly created Victorian Mounted Rifles adopted the hat as part of their uniform after their commanding officer, Thomas Price, had seen them worn by police in Burma. On 22 December 1890, the military commanders of the then separate Australian Colonies prior to the Federation of Australia met to discuss the introduction of the khaki uniform throughout Australia. They agreed that all Australian Forces with the exception of the Artillery would wear the slouch hat. It was to be looped up on one side—Victoria and Tasmania on the right and the other colonies (later states) on the left. This was done so that rifles could be held at the slope without damaging the brim. After Federation, the slouch hat became standard Australian Army headgear in 1903 and since then it has developed into an important national symbol.

The slouch hat (also known as a hat KFF, or hat khaki fur felt) is worn as the standard ceremonial headress for all members of the Army, except those belonging to units or corps that have an official headress such as a beret, and is treated with the utmost care and respect. It is also worn in some units as general duty dress. When worn for ceremonial purposes, the &quot;Grade 1&quot; Slouch hat is worn with a seven-band puggaree, six of which represent the states of Australia while the seventh represents the territories of Australia. A Unit Colour Patch is worn on the right of puggaree, while a Corps or Regiment Hat badge is placed to its front and the General Service Badge (The Rising Sun) worn on the left brim which is folded up and clipped into place. 

The slouch hat worn by the Army is one of its trademarks, but it is not theirs alone: the Royal Australian Air Force wears the HKFF with a dark blue or &quot;Air Force Blue&quot; Puggaree, as a Non Ceremonial head dress for the RAAF; the Royal Australian Navy is also known to wear the hat when wearing camouflage and other uniforms, and has the same features as the RAAF&#x27;s HKFF. 

Soldiers from the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1RAR) wear a jungle green coloured puggaree with no colour patch, which dates back to traditions when serving in Malaya. Staff Cadets at the Royal Military College, Duntroon also wear a darker pugaree, however it contains eight pleats. The eighth pleat signifies the graduation of the first international cadet through the Royal Military College who hailed from New Zealand. They also wear the chin strap of the hat the opposite way around from that of the rest of the Army, as the first commander of the 1st Australian Imperial Force, William Throsby Bridges, was found wearing his slouch hat back to front when he was fatally wounded at Gallipoli.

Some units of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps such as cavalry and light horse regiments wear emu plumes behind the Rising Sun badge. This is a reference to a practice dating from World War 1, where Light Horsemen would chase down emus and steal their feathers to mount in their hat as a mark of their riding skill.

Members of the Australian Air Force Cadets and Australian Army Cadets both wear a slouch hat, referred to as it is by their parent branch: the AAFC calling it the HFFK, and the AAC calling it the KFF.

===New Zealand===

The NZ version of the slouch hat currently worn by the various corps and regiments of the New Zealand Army is known as the &quot;Mounted Rifles Hat&quot;. The puggaree is always khaki-green-khaki, the original Mounted Rifles puggaree, with only the badge denoting the wearer&#x27;s Regimental affiliation. Dating from the early 1900s, it was reintroduced for wear by Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Mounted Rifles in the mid-1990s, but in 2000 its issue was broadened to all Corps for wear with working dress (influenced by such use by QAMR) as well as with service dress. As an alternative to the typical NZ army &quot;lemon squeezer&quot;, the NZ Mounted Rifles Hat is worn on all but the most important occasions, where the lemon squeezer takes precedence. The slouch hat predates the introduction of the lemon squeezer hat (which did not appear until after the Boer War) and is worn brim down. Historic photographs indicate the brim to have been worn up in the Australian style on occasion. The term &#x27;bush hat&#x27; is also associated with New Zealand culture such as the Bushman, Southern man and man alone stereotypes. 

The New Zealand Police wear a variant of the bush hat in navy blue, normally in rural areas. Considered obsolete as main dress, it is now rarely worn instead of the standard peaked cap or recently (2021) introduced baseball cap.

===Canada===
During the North-West Rebellion of 1885 both non-uniformed and uniformed regiments in the Alberta Field Force, plus occasionally the North-West Mounted Police, wore slouch hats. Slouch hats were commonly worn by Canadian mounted regiments in the Second Boer War and occasionally by the Royal Canadian Regiment. Throughout the late Victorian era and early 1900s slouch hats were widely worn by the Canadian military, from the Yukon to South Africa.

Naval and air force personnel of the Canadian Forces serving overseas during the Gulf War were issued with white cotton duck hats.

===Ireland===
The Slouch hat was used extensively during the 1916 Rising and Irish War of Independence most famously Padraig Pearse who wore one during The Easter Rising, which is now on display in Collins Barracks 
===India===
A few state police forces in India use slouch hats, or did so in the past. The Armed Reserve wing of the Kerala Police wore slouch hats up to the 1980s, but today the slouch hat is only worn by Recruit Trainee Police Constables (RTPC) during their training. The Armed Reserve policemen of Kerala Police now wear a blue peaked cap. The Karnataka Police continues to use slouch hats for its members in the lower ranks of the police (Constables and Head Constables), with the colours of the police unit embroidered on the turned-up brim. The number of the individual officer is also fixed onto the side of the brim. The Rajasthan Provincial Constabulary: the armed branch of the Rajasthan Police, also uses the slouch hat pinned up to the side, as the standard service and ceremonial headgear for all its Constables and Head Constables.

===Nigeria===
The uniform of Nigerian soldiers in the 1960s included a slouch hat, popularly known as &quot;Banga Banga&quot;, although the term &quot;banga-banga&quot; also refers to the lower rank&#x27;s fez.

===United Kingdom===
Some units of the British Army sent to South Africa during the Boer War adopted the slouch hat, particularly members of the Imperial Yeomanry, and retained its use on their return to the UK after the war. Though the Service Cap became standard after the formation of the Territorial Force in 1908, the Royal East Kent Mounted Rifles used them for ceremonial purposes until around 1910. 

During World War II, British soldiers serving in the jungles of Burma often wore the slouch hat.

Post war, the Gurkhas are the only unit which retained the use of a version of the slouch hat. The primary version is the Terai hat, after the Terai region in Nepal. A version called the Double Terai has a double thick crown and brim for additional sun protection and durability.

===United States===

The slouch hat has been known in the US military at least since the American Civil War, being fairly common among officers. 

The standard headgear for US soldiers in the Vietnam War in the 1960s was a fatigue baseball or field cap that offered little protection from the sun. Local tailors made a slouch hat in a style between a French type bush hat of the First Indochina War and an Australian type bush hat with a snap on the brim to pin one side up that was widely bought and unofficially worn by American troops in Vietnam. The local tailors usually used green fatigue cloth or leopard skin pattern military camouflage from old parachutes. The hat often had a cloth arc emblazoned with the word VIET-NAM on the brim. The US 1st Air Commando Group members officially adopted the green slouch hat on 22 May 1964 as their distinctive and practical headgear.

In 1972 the US Army authorized female drill sergeants to wear a bush hat based on the Australian design as their distinctive headgear. This was originally beige, but has been green since 1983.

=== Rhodesia ===
Prior to 1972, when the new &#x27;greens&#x27; uniform was introduced, most corps and regiments of the Rhodesian Army wore slouch hats. The Rhodesian African Rifles and Grey&#x27;s Scouts continued to wear the slouch after the introduction of the new uniform, although they were replaced with berets for working dress.

<text>A mappa mundi (Latin ; plural = &quot;mappae mundi&quot;; ; ) is any medieval European map of the world. Such maps range in size and complexity from simple schematic maps or less across to elaborate wall maps, the largest of which to survive to modern times, the Ebstorf map, was around in diameter. The term derives from the Medieval Latin words (cloth or chart) and (world).

Around 1,100 &quot;mappae mundi&quot; are known to have survived from the Middle Ages. Of these, some 900 are found illustrating manuscript books and the remainder exist as stand-alone documents.

==Types of &quot;mappae mundi&quot;==

Extant &quot;mappae mundi&quot; come in several distinct varieties, including: 
* Zonal maps (sometimes called Macrobian maps)
* Tripartite maps (including &quot;T-O&quot; and &quot;V-in-◻&quot; maps)
* Quadripartite maps (including the Beatus maps)
* Complex maps
Medieval world maps which share some characteristics of traditional &quot;mappae mundi&quot; but contain elements from other sources, including Portolan charts and maps associated with Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; are sometimes considered a fifth type, called &quot;transitional mappae mundi&quot;.

===Zonal maps===
Zonal maps are pictures of the Eastern Hemisphere. Their purpose was to illustrate the concept that the world is a sphere with latitudinal climate zones, most often the five Aristotelian climes: 
* The northern frigid zone
* the northern temperate zone
* the equatorial tropical zone
* the southern temperate zone
* the southern frigid zone

Of these, only the two temperate zones at middle latitudes were believed to be inhabitable, and the known world was contained entirely within the northern temperate zone&#x27;s Eastern Hemisphere. As most surviving zonal maps are found illustrating Macrobius&#x27; &quot;Commentary&quot; on Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Dream of Scipio&quot; (an excerpt of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Re Publica&quot;), this type of map is sometimes called &quot;Macrobian&quot;. In their simplest and most common form, Zonal &quot;mappae mundi&quot; are merely circles divided into five parallel zones, but several larger zonal maps with much more detail have survived.

===Tripartite maps===

T-O maps, unlike zonal maps, illustrate only the habitable portion of the world known to medieval Europeans, limiting their perspective to a relatively small portion of the Earth&#x27;s Northern Hemisphere. The landmass was illustrated as a circle (an &quot;O&quot;) divided into three portions by a &quot;T&quot;. These three divisions were the continents of Asia, Africa and Europe. The popularity of the Macrobian maps and the combination of T-O style continents on some of the larger Macrobian spheres illustrate that Earth&#x27;s sphericity continued to be understood among scholars during the Middle Ages.

The V-in-square map depicts the Earth divided between the sons of Noah.

===Quadripartite or Beatus maps===
Quadripartite maps represent a sort of amalgam of the zonal and T-O maps by illustrating the three known continents separated by an equatorial ocean from a fourth unknown land, often called &quot;Antipodes&quot;. Fourteen large quadripartite maps are found illustrating different manuscripts of Beatus of Liébana&#x27;s popular &quot;Commentary&quot; on the &quot;Apocalypse&quot; of St John. These &quot;Beatus maps&quot; are believed to derive from a single (now lost) original which was used to illustrate the missions of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ.

===Complex maps===
The &quot;complex&quot; or &quot;great&quot; world maps are the most famous mappae mundi. Although most employ a modified T-O scheme, they are considerably more detailed than their smaller T-O cousins. These maps show coastal details, mountains, rivers, cities, towns and provinces. Some include figures and stories from history, the Bible and classical mythology. Also shown on some maps are exotic plants, beasts and races known to medieval scholars only through Roman and Greek texts. Prior to its destruction in World War II, the Ebstorf map at across was the largest surviving mappa mundi. Today that honour is held by the surviving centre portion of the Hereford map which is 147 cm across and 175 cm top to bottom. Other important maps in this group are the Cotton or Anglo-Saxon map, the Psalter map and the Henry of Mainz map. The somewhat later mappae mundi that accompany the popular &quot;Polychronicon&quot; of Ranulf Higden should probably be viewed as degenerate forms of the earlier complex maps.

Complex mappae mundi include:

==Purpose of &quot;mappae mundi&quot;==

To modern eyes, mappae mundi can look superficially primitive and inaccurate. However, mappae mundi were never meant to be used as navigational charts and they make no pretence of showing the relative areas of land and water. Rather, mappae mundi were schematic and were meant to illustrate different principles. The simplest mappae mundi were diagrams meant to preserve and illustrate classical learning easily. The zonal maps should be viewed as a kind of teaching aid – easily reproduced and designed to reinforce the idea of the Earth&#x27;s sphericity and climate zones. T-O maps were designed to schematically illustrate the three land masses of the world as it was known to the Romans and their medieval European heirs.

The larger mappae mundi have the space and detail to illustrate further concepts, such as the cardinal directions, distant lands, Bible stories, history, mythology, flora, fauna and exotic races. In their fullest form, such as the Ebstorf and Hereford maps, they become minor encyclopedias of medieval knowledge.
In her study, Brigitte Englisch shows that the medieval world maps (the mappae mundi) both from their concept and in their concrete practice are founded on a systematically geometric projection of the known world. The basis of this projection, however, is not geographical surveying but the harmonious order of God’s creation. Using regular geometric forms like circles and triangles which are also regarded as religiously perfect, they created a coherent planispheric system. This quite basically presents the known world in its real geographic appearance which is visible in the so-called Vatican Map of Isidor (776), the world maps of Beatus of Liebana’s &quot;Commentary on the Apocalypse of St John&quot; (8th century), the Anglo-Saxon Map (ca. 1000), the Sawley map, the Psalter map, or the large mappae mundi of the 13th century (Hereford/Ebstorf).

==End of the tradition==

In the mid 13th century,a new type of map called Carta Pisana, developed as an aid to navigating the Mediterranean Sea. Now known as &quot;Portolan charts&quot;, these maps are characterized by extremely accurate coastlines with criss-crossing rhumb lines. A particularly famous example is the Catalan Atlas attributed to Abraham Cresques in the Bibliothèque nationale de France. During the late Middle Ages and with the coming of the Renaissance, western Europeans became reacquainted with the work of many ancient Greek scholars. In the field of geography and map-making, the coordinate system which Claudius Ptolemy outlined in the &quot;Geography&quot; became extremely influential. Over time maps influenced by these new ideas displaced the older traditions of mappae mundi. The last examples of the tradition, including the massive map of Fra Mauro, may be seen as hybrids, incorporating Portolan-style coastlines into the frame of a traditional mappa mundi.

<doc id="478613" wikidata="Q278330" url="?curid=478613" title="Osgyth">
<text>Osgyth (or Osyth; died 700 AD) was a Mercian noblewoman and prioress, venerated as an English saint since the 8th century, from soon after her death. She is primarily commemorated in the village of St Osyth, in Essex, near Colchester. Alternative spellings of her name include Sythe, Othith and Ositha. Born of a noble family, she became a nun and founded a priory near Chich which was later named after her.

==Life==
Born in Quarrendon, Buckinghamshire (at that time part of Mercia), she was the daughter of Frithuwald, a sub-king of Mercia in Surrey. Her mother was Wilburh, of the royal house of Mercia. Her parents, with St. Erconwald, founded Chertsey Abbey in 675 AD.

Raised in the care of her maternal aunts, St Edith of Aylesbury and Edburga of Bicester, her ambition was to become an abbess, but she was too important as a political pawn to be set aside. She was forced by her father into a dynastic marriage with Sighere, King of Essex. She is likely the mother of Offa of Essex, although this is not certain.

While her husband was off on a long hunt to run down a beautiful white stag, Osgyth persuaded two local bishops to accept her vows as a nun. Upon his return some days later, he reluctantly agreed to her decision and granted her some land at Chich near Colchester, now named after her as St Osyth, where she established a convent, and ruled as first abbess. She was beheaded by some raiding pirates, perhaps because she may have resisted being carried off.

==Legends==
One day, St. Edith sent Osgyth to deliver a book to St. Modwenna of Northumbria at her nunnery. To get there, Osgyth had to cross a stream by a bridge. The stream was swollen, the wind high, she fell into the water and drowned. Her absence was not noted for two days. Edith thought she was safe with Modwenna who was not expecting her visit. On the third day, Edith, wondering that her pupil had not returned, went to Modwenna. The abbesses were greatly concerned when they discovered Osgyth was apparently lost. They searched for her and found the child lying near the banks of the stream. The abbesses prayed for her restoration and commanded her to arise from the water and come to them. This she did. A similar tale is found in Irish hagiography.

Her later death was accounted a martyrdom by some, but Bede makes no mention of Saint Osgyth. The 13th-century chronicler Matthew Paris repeats some of the legends that had accrued around her name. The site of her martyrdom was transferred to the holy spring at Quarrendon. The holy spring at Quarrendon, mentioned in the time of Osgyth&#x27;s aunts, now became associated with her legend, in which Osgyth stood up after her execution, picking up her head like Saint Denis in Paris, and other cephalophoric martyrs and walking with it in her hands, to the door of a local convent, before collapsing there. Some modern authors link the legends of cephalophores miraculously walking with their heads in their hands to the Celtic cult of heads.
==Veneration==
Her cult was promoted by Maurice, bishop of London, where there was a shrine dedicated to her at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

Around 1121, his successor, Richard de Belmeis I founded a priory for canons of Saint Augustine, on the site of a former nunnery at Chich. He obtained the relic of an arm for the monastery church. His remains were buried in the chancel of the church in 1127: he bequeathed the church and tithes to the canons, who elected as their first abbot or prior William de Corbeil, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury (died in 1136). Corbeil acquired the other arm for Canterbury. 

Benefactions, charters, and privileges granted by Henry II, made the Canons wealthy: at the Dissolution of the monasteries in 1536, priory revenues were valued at £758 5s. 8d. yearly. In 1397 the abbot of St Osgyth was granted the right to wear a mitre and give the solemn benediction, and, more singularly, the right to ordain priests, conferred by Pope Boniface IX. The gatehouse, the so-called &#x27;Abbot&#x27;s Tower&#x27;, and some ranges of buildings remain.

Osgyth&#x27;s burial site at St. Mary the Virgin, Aylesbury became a site of great, though unofficial pilgrimage; following a papal decree in 1500, the bones were removed from the church and buried in secret. Undeterred, according to the curious 17th-century antiquary John Aubrey (author of the &quot;Brief Lives&quot;), &quot;in those days, when they went to bed they did rake up the fire, and make a X on the ashes, and pray to God and Saint Sythe [Saint Osgyth] to deliver them from fire, and from water, and from all misadventure.&quot;

Veneration of St Osyth was widespread across England. Norwich Cathedral and St Albans Abbey had chapels dedicated to her in the Middle Ages. 

Her feast day is 7 October. She is often depicted carrying her own head.

<doc id="478614" wikidata="Q240872" url="?curid=478614" title="Lawrence Kasdan">
<text>Lawrence Edward Kasdan (born January 14, 1949) is an American filmmaker. He is the co-writer of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; (2015), and &quot;&quot; (2018). He also wrote &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; (1992), and is the writer-director of &quot;Body Heat&quot; (1981), &quot;The Big Chill&quot; (1983), &quot;Silverado&quot; (1985), &quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot; (1988), and &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; (2003).

Kasdan is known for updating old Hollywood genres—film noir, science fiction, westerns—in a classical dramatic style with quick-witted dialogue, but dealing with contemporary social themes. As a director, he has made various personal films that examine characters and generations.

Kasdan has been nominated for four Academy Awards: as a producer for Best Picture nominee &quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot;, for which he was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, and for Best Original Screenplay for both &quot;The Big Chill&quot; and &quot;Grand Canyon&quot; (1991). He has often collaborated with his wife, Meg Kasdan, his brother, Mark Kasdan, and his two sons: Jonathan Kasdan and Jake Kasdan. He has frequently cast Kevin Kline and William Hurt in his films.

==Early life==
Kasdan was born in Miami Beach, Florida, the son of Sylvia, an employment counselor, and Clarence Kasdan, an electronics-store manager. Kasdan is Jewish. His older brother is Mark Kasdan, who co-wrote &quot;Silverado&quot; (1985) and produced &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; (2003), and he has two sisters. Kasdan grew up in Morgantown, West Virginia. &quot;I felt very fortunate to have had a regular American childhood in the fifties,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a safe place, where you owned the town if you had a bicycle.&quot;

His parents were both &quot;thwarted writers.&quot; His father, who died when Kasdan was 14, had wanted to be a playwright, and his mother claimed to have studied with novelist and playwright Sinclair Lewis at the University of Wisconsin. She sold a few stories to &quot;confessional magazines&quot; in the 1950s, and later bought self-help books and typed up their contents with the dream of writing her own book one day. She also struck up conversations with strangers on the bus, saying it was all &quot;grist for the mill&quot; for future writing. &quot;Looking back on it now,&quot; Kasdan wrote, &quot;I wonder if maybe I owe her everything. Whether by nature or nurture, I became a writer.&quot;

Many of Kasdan&#x27;s movies were inspired by his &quot;difficult childhood and home life,&quot; he wrote. &quot;So, in my work, I&#x27;ve looked for something more stable or explored why growing up in my home was so upsetting.&quot;

&quot;We didn&#x27;t have a lot of money and neither did anyone around us, and going to the movies was the happiest thing about my childhood,&quot; he said. &quot;Movies weren&#x27;t very big in Wheeling in those days. We used to call up the theater to ask what time the show began, and they&#x27;d say, &#x27;What time can you get here?&#x27;&quot; He particularly loved &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1960), both directed by John Sturges—movies that shaped his ideas of manhood and heroism. &quot;Film made its values tangible for me in the ways that parents, school, Sunday School had not. I wanted to live in the world I found in the movies.&quot;

In 1963, his brother Mark took him to see David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;. They arrived a few minutes late, and Mark insisted that they kill six hours until the next showing. &quot;I thought my brother was crazy. But when the show was over, I knew I had done the right thing. As I stumbled from the theater, having seen the whole movie, I had a new hero. It was not T. E. Lawrence, but David Lean&quot;.

He graduated from Morgantown High School in 1966. To earn money for college, he worked various jobs at a glass factory and the night shift at a supermarket in Wheeling, scraping meat from butcher machines. He applied to the University of Michigan because he was told it had the best-paying college writing contest in the country (the Hopwood Award), and that the playwright Arthur Miller had paid for his studies by winning the award. Miller&#x27;s teacher, Kenneth Thorpe Rowe, was still a professor there, and Kasdan studied drama writing with Rowe.

Kasdan won the Hopwood Award four times between 1968 and 1970, winning a total of $2,000. &quot;When I received the letter telling me that I had won Hopwood Awards in both fiction and drama, my life changed forever,&quot; he said. &quot;It was the first sign the real world, the outside world, the big-time world, had given me that this was not just a hopeless dream. ... Even though I had many discouraging years after that, there was never a day after I received that letter that I doubted I would be able to make my way as a writer.&quot;

While in college, Kasdan marched on Washington to protest the Vietnam War. He also made one short film. &quot;Technically, it was very crude,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a wry look at a professor I knew who was very interested in all the young female students—sort of a rough, humorous film about his fascination with one particular girl. It was shot on 16mm. I cut it and did the sound, but I was never a technically proficient student filmmaker.&quot;

He was determined to become a director, and decided the best path was to write screenplays. He got into UCLA&#x27;s writing program and briefly moved to Los Angeles, but found the experience frustrating and moved back to Ann Arbor, where he worked in a record store and continued writing screenplays.

He pursued a master&#x27;s degree in education at the University of Michigan and graduated in 1971, with plans to support himself as a high-school English teacher until he broke into Hollywood. But he soon discovered that there were no high-school English teaching jobs. &quot;It was almost as hard to get that kind of work as being a movie director,&quot; he said. The experience he did have as a student teacher later proved useful on film sets: &quot;You can control an unruly class at almost any level, but the more you yell, the less effective yelling becomes,&quot; he said. &quot;That has influenced my approach to directing; for me, being hard is giving someone a look where another director might scream at them.&quot;

==Career==
Unable to find a teaching position, Kasdan took a job as an advertising copywriter at the W. B. Doner agency in Detroit—a profession he didn&#x27;t enjoy but found success in, earning a Clio Award for his first TV commercial, as well as an award from The One Show. His supervisor, Jim Dale, remembered Kasdan &quot;always said he was better at writing for TV than for print, and that was certainly prophetic.&quot; Kasdan called his five years in advertising &quot;hellacious&quot;, and persisted in writing screenplays at night.

=== Screenwriter ===

==== Early career (1970s) ====
The Bodyguard

Kasdan&#x27;s sixth finished screenplay, written in 1975, was about a singer who falls in love with her bodyguard. With &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; he was able to get an agent, Norman Kurland, and he took an advertising job in Los Angeles to further justify a move to California. Kurland sent the script around town for two years, and it was rejected 67 times. &quot;We couldn’t even get him a job writing &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;,&quot; Kurland said, although Kasdan had no desire to write for television. He was hired to write a treatment for a low-budget feature for Paramount, but the film was never made. He continued to write screenplays, including what he called an &quot;un-producible historical&quot; movie.

&quot;The Bodyguard&quot; was finally optioned by Warner Bros. in 1977 for $20,000. It was rewritten many times over the years, and attached to different actresses (including Diana Ross and Whoopi Goldberg) whose characters had various occupations. Kasdan wrote it with Steve McQueen in mind as the bodyguard, Frank. In the original draft, the U.S. president Frank failed to save was John F. Kennedy. Kevin Costner read the screenplay when Kasdan directed him in &quot;Silverado&quot;, the role that made him a star. In 1991, he asked Kasdan to make &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; with Costner in the title role. Kasdan had &quot;messed around&quot; with it so many times that he felt too burned out, and he was also preparing to direct &quot;Grand Canyon&quot;—so he chose instead to produce it with Costner, and they hired Mick Jackson, who had just made &quot;L.A. Story&quot;, to direct. Whitney Houston was cast as superstar singer Rachel Marron.

Kasdan was not happy with the way the film turned out, &quot;but I think it had nothing to do with Mick Jackson,&quot; he later said. &quot;I think it had to do with the fact that I&#x27;m not a good person for having other people direct my screenplays ... and so I was very unhappy with &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;. Kevin and I got very involved in the editing, which is not something I would normally do with any other director. I don&#x27;t want people messing with my movie. But we were the producers and we had serious problems with it.&quot;

Despite receiving &quot;probably the worst reviews I&#x27;ve ever had,&quot; Kasdan said, the film was a huge box-office success, earning more than $411 million worldwide. &quot;If I had directed that film it probably wouldn&#x27;t have done anything like that business,&quot; Kasdan wrote.

Continental Divide

While &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; was being passed around town, Kasdan wrote &quot;Continental Divide&quot;—a script about a brash Chicago journalist who falls in love with a woman living in the mountains studying eagles, in the vein of an old Spencer Tracy / Katharine Hepburn comedy. He came up with the outline while eating lunch on the lawn of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

Kurland shopped it around, and took it to Steven Spielberg, who was on the dubbing stage for &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977). Spielberg had Universal buy the script for $150,000 in October 1977, with a desire to serve as executive producer. &quot;I was looking for a love story to do,&quot; Spielberg said. &quot;Actually, it was a very intense bidding situation. There were four studios bidding for it and Universal made the highest bid. The script was wonderful. Larry is an excellent writer. He writes the sort of material we haven&#x27;t seen around here for a long time. He writes about the &#x27;30s and &#x27;40s in a fascinating, exciting way. He loves old movies and draws on them for his work. He&#x27;s exploring new territory based on old ground.&quot;

The movie was eventually made several years later, starring John Belushi and Blair Brown and directed by Michael Apted. It came out on September 18, 1981, three weeks after the release of Kasdan&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Body Heat&quot;.

According to Kasdan, the original script was &quot;very different from the film which resulted. The script had a kind of Howard Hawksian speed, momentum, hopefully wit about it. I don&#x27;t think the film turned out that way, which was one of those painful experiences I had early on.&quot;

==== Franchise writing (1980s-2010s) ====
Raiders of the Lost Ark

Spielberg&#x27;s enthusiasm for &quot;Continental Divide&quot; led him to hire Kasdan to write &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, which he was developing with George Lucas. &quot;I think that what they were looking for was someone who could write &quot;Raiders&quot; in the same way that Hawks would have someone write a movie for him—a strong woman character, a certain kind of hero,&quot; Kasdan said. In a now-famous meeting (with producer Frank Marshall also in the room), &quot;George, Steven, and I talked for about 20 minutes. Then we stood up and shook hands, and George said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s make this movie.&#x27; I had just met the guy, and a few minutes later I&#x27;m in business with him.&quot;

&quot;George said, &#x27;We&#x27;re going to do a movie that&#x27;s like the old serials, Kasdan recalled. I don&#x27;t know too much about it, but the hero is named after my dog, Indiana. I know the hero wears a fedora and a leather jacket and carries a whip. That the artifact would be the Biblical Ark of the Covenant was writer-director Philip Kaufman&#x27;s idea. Kaufman got it from his orthodontist when he was 11 years old (at one point, Kaufman was going to be involved with the screenplay. He received a &quot;story by&quot; credit).

The rest of the plot was hashed out in a brainstorm session with Lucas, Spielberg, and Kasdan:

We had a tape recorder going, and George essentially guided the story process and the three of us pitched the entire movie in about five days. And that&#x27;s where the fantasy of all our pent-up, wet-movie dreams coalesced. Most of the time we were on our feet, trying to out-shout each other with ideas.

They wound up with a hundred-page transcript, and Kasdan wrote the screenplay in Spielberg&#x27;s office while the director was making &quot;1941&quot;. It took him six months.

For the character of Indiana Jones, Kasdan said he wanted to capture the essence of old Hollywood stars like Errol Flynn, Burt Lancaster, and Clark Gable. &quot;One of my favorite actors is Steve McQueen,&quot; he said. &quot;I loved the poetry in the way he moved—his stylized movement. I wanted &quot;Raiders&quot; to have that heightened reality. That&#x27;s where I came together with George&#x27;s love of serials and Steven&#x27;s fascination with kinetic thrust.&quot;

Lucas wanted the character to be more like James Bond, so Kasdan had to write a different version of the scene where Brody goes to his house, he said. &quot;George wanted Indy to be a playboy, so Jones was going to answer the door wearing a tuxedo. Then, when Brody went into the house, he would see a beautiful, Harlow-type blonde sipping champagne in Indy&#x27;s living room. My feeling was that Indiana Jones&#x27; two sides (professor and adventurer) made him complicated enough without adding the playboy element.&quot;

The film came out on June 12, 1981, and made more than $390 million internationally, winning five Academy Awards out of nine nominations. Kasdan eventually warmed to the finished film. &quot;I look at &quot;Raiders&quot; now and I&#x27;m very proud of it,&quot; he wrote in 1999. &quot;I think it&#x27;s a terrific movie and I think Steven did a magnificent job with it.&quot; He was later asked to write &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, but declined because he didn&#x27;t want to associate with the film; he perceived it as &quot;horrible, mean and unpleasant&quot; due to it being developed during a chaotic period in Spielberg&#x27;s and Lucas&#x27;s lives. Several elements from Kasdan&#x27;s earlier &quot;Raiders&quot; draft found their way in the prequel. Kasdan semi-returned to the franchise in 2007 when he assisted David Koepp in writing some romantic dialogue for &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;.

Star Wars: Episode V—The Empire Strikes Back

Lucas initially hired Leigh Brackett, the sci-fi novelist who also wrote screenplays for Howard Hawks—including &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1946)—to write the sequel to &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). But Brackett died in March 1978, while the film was still in pre-production, and Lucas was dissatisfied with her script. He wrote the next draft himself, which established structure and twists close to the final film, but needed dialogue polishing. When Kasdan delivered his script for &quot;Raiders&quot;, Lucas asked him to rewrite &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Kasdan suggested he read &quot;Raiders&quot; first, but Lucas reportedly said: &quot;If I hate &quot;Raiders&quot;, I&#x27;ll call you up tomorrow and cancel this offer, but basically I get a feeling about people.&quot;

Most of the plot elements and characters were already in place, but Kasdan helped in part make it darker than the first &quot;Star Wars&quot;. &quot;George was open to it and ready to have it happen,&quot; he said. &quot;Over the three &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, he saw a trajectory. &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was the second act, and traditionally, the second act is when things start to go bad. George had made his [most important] decision when he hired Irvin Kershner to direct, even though Kershner and I were acting as his tools.&quot;

When &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; came out on May 21, 1980, it was the first time Kasdan&#x27;s name appeared in a movie&#x27;s credits. He felt his main contribution to Lucas&#x27;s series was developing character. &quot;George is one of the good guys,&quot; Kasdan said in 1981. &quot;But he and I have some disagreements, too. George thinks if you play the commercial movie game, a very expensive game, you have to play for big stakes.&quot;

Star Wars: Episode VI—Return of the Jedi

Kasdan launched his directing career after writing &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, and was uninterested in writing another &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie. But Lucas had supported him on &quot;Body Heat&quot; as an uncredited producer, so when Lucas asked him to write the screenplay for the third chapter (then titled &quot;Revenge of the Jedi&quot;), Kasdan felt obliged to repay him.

He spent the summer of 1981 co-writing the shooting script with Lucas (based on a story by Lucas). &quot;In both the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies it&#x27;s really George&#x27;s story,&quot; Kasdan said. &quot;I came into &quot;Empire&quot; after there was already a draft. On &quot;Jedi&quot;, George had done a draft, which we changed radically. Then he and I really collaborated on the script.&quot;

&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; came out on May 25, 1983, and made $475 million. Lucas had already publicly spoken about making both a prequel and sequel trilogy; the prequels he wrote and directed himself 20 years later, and the Walt Disney Company made episodes 7 through 9 after it purchased Lucasfilm in 2012. In 1981, Kasdan surmised that &quot;they&#x27;ll probably shoot the before-Luke trilogy next, about young Darth and young Ben. But with George, you can&#x27;t be sure. For myself, I can only say this will be my last &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie. On the other hand, you never know. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be working on this one.&quot; During the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequels&#x27; development, Lucas constantly approached Kasdan to help him write them, but Kasdan resisted returning to the franchise, opining that Lucas should do the prequels as he wished given the creative clashes Lucas had with him, Kershner and Richard Marquand during the original trilogy&#x27;s development. But Lucas thought it would be great for Kasdan to take a second pass at the screenplays.

Star Wars: Episode VII—The Force Awakens

When Disney bought Lucasfilm with plans to make more &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, Kathleen Kennedy, Lucasfilm&#x27;s new president, asked Kasdan to be involved. &quot;I said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t really want to ... I just feel like I&#x27;ve done this,&#x27;&quot; he recalled. &quot;They said, &#x27;We want to do a movie about Han.&#x27; That got me. That was the only one that could possibly have gotten me.&quot;

Kennedy had hired Michael Arndt to write &quot;Episode VII&quot;, and she asked Kasdan if he would consult on that script as well. He always felt that &quot;Han Solo is really the character that people find irresistible, not Luke,&quot; he said. &quot;Luke is too good for people to invest in. Han is right out of the classic mold. He&#x27;s William Holden. He&#x27;s Jimmy Cagney. He&#x27;s Humphrey Bogart. Han is the one who is compromised and reluctantly forced to be altruistic and heroic.&quot; He had wanted to kill Han off in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. &quot;We&#x27;re closing off the trilogy,&quot; he said. &quot;And we want to lose somebody important. It would give some stakes to this thing. And George did not like it.&quot; In &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, he and actor Harrison Ford finally got their wish.

&quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; came out on December 18, 2015. It made more than $2 billion internationally, breaking the North American record for top-grossing film of all time. In his review for &quot;The&quot; &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Todd McCarthy wrote: &quot;One notably feels the hand of Lawrence Kasdan, who ... co-wrote &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and, perhaps more significantly, authored &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, the film this new one most resembles in terms of its incident and exuberance.&quot;

Kasdan, Abrams, and Arndt won the Saturn Award for Best Writing for &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;. This marked Kasdan&#x27;s first win for a &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, after being nominated for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.

Despite not working in the following sequels, Kasdan later talked with Abrams, Lucas, and Rian Johnson about the story for the saga&#x27;s last episode, &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot;.

Solo: A Star Wars Story

Kasdan wrote the screenplay for a Han Solo origin story—the one assignment with Disney and Lucasfilm he initially signed on for—with his son, Jonathan Kasdan, a writer and director. The younger Kasdan had had small roles in his father&#x27;s movies since &quot;The Big Chill&quot;, but they had never written a script together.

&quot;&quot; details the character&#x27;s backstory: how he got his name, how he met Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian, and the beginnings of his internal battle between self-interested scoundrel and hero. Alden Ehrenreich was cast in the role Ford originated. The production was plagued by drama; most notably, the original directors—Phil Lord and Christopher Miller—were fired during the shoot and replaced by Ron Howard. The film opened on May 25, 2018, and made just under $393 million worldwide (the lowest box-office returns for any live-action &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie to date). Kasdan later attributed &quot;Solo&quot;&#x27;s underperformance to Lucasfilm &quot;blowing it&quot;, after which he left the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe as promised, not responding to any of Lucasfilm&#x27;s subsequent attempts to woo him back, even sending him a messenger with a new script.

=== Director ===
==== &quot;Body Heat&quot; (1981) ====
After writing &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Kasdan had the cachet to direct his own film.

Alan Ladd Jr., the head of 20th Century Fox and a key player on &quot;Star Wars&quot;, gave Kasdan the deal—but by the time the script was finished Ladd was no longer at Fox. The new president, Sherry Lansing, put many of the existing deals in turnaround, including Kasdan&#x27;s. Ladd started The Ladd Company in 1979, and offered to produce &quot;Body Heat&quot; on one condition: that an established director would &quot;sponsor&quot; the untested Kasdan. So Kasdan reached out to George Lucas.

The producers wanted Kasdan to cast a star, but he insisted on William Hurt, a stage actor who had just made his film debut in &quot;Altered States&quot; (1980). Kasdan cast another unknown, Kathleen Turner, as Matty, and Ted Danson as one of Ned&#x27;s colleagues. (Danson was offered the part of Sam Malone on &quot;Cheers&quot; while filming &quot;Body Heat&quot;.) The heat-centric story was originally set in New Jersey, but an actors&#x27; strike delayed production until December, so the location was moved to Miami.

&quot;Body Heat&quot; opened on August 28, 1981. It made more than $24 million domestically on a $7 million budget and was praised by the majority of critics. &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s review called it &quot;an engrossing, mightily stylish meller [melodrama] in which sex and crime walk hand in hand down the path to tragedy, just like in the old days. Working in the imposing shadow of the late James M. Cain, screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan makes an impressively confident directorial debut with a vehicle which could clinch star status for William Hurt.&quot;

The Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards nominated Kasdan for Best Director, and the Writers Guild of America nominated his screenplay for a WGA Award.

==== &quot;The Big Chill&quot; (1983) ====
While editing &quot;Body Heat&quot; Kasdan had the idea for a large ensemble film, partly in reaction to the &quot;claustrophobic&quot; experience of working with just two actors in intimate settings.

His lawyer&#x27;s wife, Barbara Benedek, had begun writing screenplays (and was a story editor on two comedy TV series for ABC), and Kasdan proposed co-writing with her. She was &quot;enormously influential on the tone&quot; of the script, he said, and they wrote characters who were composites of real people they each knew—as well as &quot;a little bit of ourselves&quot;.

Kasdan had trouble finding a buyer, because &quot;no one believed that an ensemble film could be commercially successful. Hollywood always wanted you to have a protagonist, hopefully a white male who the audience could invest in, and possibly a sidekick or possibly a woman that he was involved with. When I presented them with a movie that had eight protagonists, they were only confused.&quot; He pitched it to &quot;around seventeen different places,&quot; but they all passed. Johnny Carson had a deal to make movies at Columbia, and producer Marcia Nasatir convinced Carson to make &quot;The Big Chill&quot;.

The ensemble cast included Hurt and Kevin Kline, both of whom became regulars in Kasdan&#x27;s directing career, as well as Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, Mary Kay Place, Tom Berenger, and JoBeth Williams. After four weeks of rehearsal, the film was shot in a real house in South Carolina, which had been used in &quot;The Great Santini&quot;. John Bailey, husband of editor Carol Littleton, was the cinematographer. The &#x27;60s pop soundtrack was curated by Kasdan&#x27;s wife, Meg. The album sold more than six million copies and is one of the best-selling soundtracks of all time.

&quot;The Big Chill&quot; came out on September 30, 1983. It ran in theaters for six months, making more than $56 million on an $8 million budget, and received mostly praise, with some mixed reviews.

The film was nominated for three Academy Awards: for best original screenplay, best supporting actress (Close), and best picture. The screenplay was nominated for a BAFTA Award and a Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award, and it won the WGA Award. Kasdan earned a DGA Award nomination by the Directors Guild of America. He later said:

It was a kind of a lightning rod to controversy. I think I was surprised by everything that happened to &quot;The Big Chill&quot; because it was so personal. It was so much about my life, Barbara&#x27;s life, and my wife&#x27;s life that when it became very popular I was surprised.

Film critic F. X. Feeney wrote: &quot;Kasdan fashioned a national conversation piece. People spoke thereafter of &quot;The Big Chill&quot; Generation.&#x27; Films made by later generations, about those generations ... would have to endure being dubbed &#x27;The Little Chill&#x27; by critics. (So, in a sense, Kasdan founded a new genre.)&quot;

==== &quot;Silverado&quot; (1985) ====
Kasdan co-wrote &quot;Silverado&quot;&#x27;s screenplay with his brother, Mark Kasdan. The story, set in 1880, is about a motley crew of cowboys who team up and set aside self-interest to protect a small town from a corrupt sheriff.

He cast Kevin Kline for the second time, as lead cowboy Paden, along with Scott Glenn, Danny Glover (who reunited with Kasdan in &quot;Grand Canyon&quot;), and Kevin Costner (who re-teamed with Kasdan for another western, &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;). Brian Dennehy was cast as the sheriff, and Kasdan&#x27;s son Jonathan and wife Meg both had bit parts.

The film shot in New Mexico during the winter of 1984, and an entire town set was built near Santa Fe that was later reused in several films, including &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;. During production some of the cast developed hypothermia, and Kasdan had to contend with both blizzards and flash floods.

The film was so popular at its test screening in Seattle that Columbia rushed its release by several months, without arranging the usual marketing and merchandising efforts in time. It came out on July 10, 1985, and did decent business—$32 million on a $26 million budget—but Kasdan felt it would have done better with a more concerted release strategy. The reviews were largely positive.

The film earned Oscar nominations for best sound and best original score (composed by Bruce Broughton). Kasdan won the Young Venice Award—Special Mention at the Venice Film Festival.

==== &quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot; (1988) ====
After making &quot;Silverado&quot;, Kasdan passed on &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1987) because he didn&#x27;t like the script; it was directed by Brian De Palma. He had also been developing &quot;Man Trouble&quot; (1992), but disagreed with the producers over Carole Eastman&#x27;s screenplay. Then he was offered &quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot;, a novel by Anne Tyler, and despite its surface similarities to &quot;Man Trouble&quot;—both stories are odd-couple romances with a character who trains dogs—he &quot;fell in love with it&quot;.

John Malkovich had been developing the project, and hired theater director Frank Galati to write a script. When Kasdan took over, he wrote his own adaptation—ultimately sharing writing credit with Galati. Like many of Kasdan&#x27;s own stories, this one was &quot;about creating a new family to replace a dysfunctional one,&quot; he said. For the lead, he cast Hurt for the third time.

Kasdan and Hurt reunited with &quot;Body Heat&quot;″s Kathleen Turner, playing Macon&#x27;s estranged wife. For the eccentric dog trainer, Muriel, Kasdan cast Geena Davis, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

&quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot; was a surprise hit when it came out on December 23, 1988. It made more than $32 million, and rode a wave of critical praise through the awards season. It won the New York Film Critics Award despite sharp criticism from several critics—including Pauline Kael, who felt the film had no voice.

The film earned two Golden Globe nominations (for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Score), a BAFTA nomination (Best Adapted Screenplay), and four Oscar nominations: Best Original Score (John Williams), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture. Davis won an Oscar for her supporting role.

&quot;I have sometimes been frustrated by the size of my audience, but not on that movie,&quot; said Kasdan. &quot;I&#x27;m amazed we got as many people in to see it as we did. It was one of the most satisfying experiences I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;m as proud of &quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot; as anything I&#x27;ve done.&quot;

==== &quot;I&quot; &quot;Love You to Death&quot; (1990) ====
Kasdan wanted to do something &quot;light and irreverent&quot; after the grief-heavy &quot;The&quot; &quot;Accidental Tourist&quot;, and John Kostmayer sent him a script based on a true story out of Pennsylvania: a woman tried to kill her husband multiple times over his infidelity, he survived all attempts, she and her accomplices went to prison, and when she got out the husband forgave her and took her back. &quot;I was fascinated by that story,&quot; Kasdan said. &quot;I thought it would make a wonderful film.&quot;

It was the first film he directed from another writer&#x27;s script, and starred Kline as pizzeria owner and serial cheater Joey, and Tracey Ullman as his wife, Rosalie. The ensemble cast included Hurt, River Phoenix, Joan Plowright, and Keanu Reeves. The film was shot in Tacoma, Washington.

In 1999, Kasdan wrote:

I have more regrets about &quot;I Love You to Death&quot; than anything I&#x27;ve done, because Kostmayer had written an odd and interesting script. It was very funny to me, but there were things in it that were ugly. In postproduction we started sneaking [test screening] it, and most of the sneak audiences hated the movie—despised it. They hated certain things, and I started taking those things out. We reshot the ending, added new scenes, and took out scenes that were difficult. I wanted to make the movie more popular, and that was weak, because it got worse and worse. As a result, I&#x27;ve never used those sneak preview cards since. It wasn&#x27;t as if the studio was making me change things. I ruined the movie.

&quot;I Love You to Death&quot; came out on April 6, 1990. It made $16 million, and reviews were largely negative or mixed.

==== &quot;Grand Canyon&quot; (1991) ====
Now in his 40s, with his oldest son leaving for college, Kasdan began a screenplay about marriage and parenting. He said:

Seeing your children grow throws your own life into relief. They&#x27;re a daily reminder that you&#x27;re moving on because they&#x27;re so clearly coming up from behind. That driving lesson [in &quot;Grand Canyon&quot;] is about more than the difficulty of making left turns in Los Angeles. Giving your son the wheel is about letting go ... and the threat of disaster in the most mundane actions.

The screenplay, which he wrote with his wife, swelled into a larger canvas that dealt with race relations in Los Angeles and the existential crises of the era. On a $20 million budget, Kasdan cast two of his regular actors—Kline and Glover—along with Steve Martin, Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker, and Alfre Woodard. (The actors took smaller salaries in exchange for profit participation.) The film follows separate but intersecting stories of multiple characters across Los Angeles&#x27;s social and racial divides, and deals with themes of fate, death, relationships, the ethics of violence in filmmaking, and more. The score is by James Newton Howard, who has worked with Kasdan on every film since.

&quot;Grand Canyon&quot; came out on December 25, 1991. The ensemble cast and social/generational commentary immediately drew comparisons to &quot;The Big Chill&quot;, and reviews were mostly positive.

The screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and a WGA Award. Some critics found the finale, which has the ensemble staring in awe at the actual Grand Canyon, to be a cop-out happy ending.

Within months of the film&#x27;s release, the 1992 Los Angeles riots occurred. &quot;There was an enormous amount of press about the fact that &quot;Grand Canyon&quot; had predicted the explosion of rage and violence,&quot; Kasdan said. &quot;Anyone walking around L.A. at that time could feel it. The riots were a natural kind of explosion that anyone could have predicted.&quot;

==== &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; (1994) ====
One of Kasdan&#x27;s abandoned projects over the years was titled &quot;Pair-A-Dice&quot;, written by &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982) screenwriter David Webb Peoples, which he developed for four years, with Costner set to star. In 1992, Costner approached him with the script for a six-hour miniseries about Wyatt Earp&#x27;s life. &quot;I told him that I was about to commit to another picture,&quot; Kasdan said. &quot;[Costner] said, &#x27;Why are you doing that? Why don&#x27;t you do &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;? I said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t like the screenplay.&#x27; And he said, &#x27;Well, then, write a new screenplay.&#x27;&quot; Kasdan agreed on the condition that they shoot the following summer, which Costner accepted. Kasdan wrote a screenplay in three months.

Kasdan was pleased with his screenplay—but less so Costner, who was still attached to the original miniseries concept. &quot;Kevin and I were visualizing a &#x27;Western Godfather,&#x27;&quot; said Dan Gordon, who wrote the miniseries script. &quot;It was to be two movies, in fact, centering on three families: the Earps and two organized crime families. Mike Gray, a bizarro mirror image of Earp, managed to get Tombstone, the richest town west of the Mississippi, deeded to his private company. It was a land grab worth $10 million to $20 million in 1880 dollars—and the only thing between him and that money was Wyatt Earp.&quot;

Kasdan said:

At that point we probably should have called the whole thing off, but we didn&#x27;t. Instead, we reached a kind of compromise script. I had never had that experience before, because everything that I had ever written I had just gone out and shot as is. Here I had this kind of hybrid. It was my script plus elements from his previous script.

Kasdan ultimately shared writing credit with Gordon, who also served as an executive producer on the film.

I think it confused the whole situation, and if I had my wits about me I probably would have said, &quot;Kevin, look, because we&#x27;re very good friends let&#x27;s preserve our friendship and not do this movie.&quot; Well, we preserved our friendship, but unfortunately we did do the movie.

Surrounding Costner as Earp were Joanna Going, Catherine O&#x27;Hara, Tom Sizemore, JoBeth Williams, Mark Harmon, and Gene Hackman. Dennis Quaid lost 43 pounds on a supervised diet to play Doc Holliday, a performance that Kasdan called &quot;the most satisfying part of the movie.&quot;

&quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; was a more ambitious production than Kasdan&#x27;s previous western, &quot;Silverado&quot;. It was shot in the summer of 1993 over the course of 19 weeks (with an entire week of rehearsals), on location in and around Santa Fe, New Mexico, with two massive sets portraying eight different Western towns, and a cast of more than 100 speaking roles and thousands of extras. It was shot on film in anamorphic format by Owen Roizman, the cinematographer on &quot;The French Connection&quot;.

&quot;It&#x27;s an epic film on an epic scale,&quot; Kasdan said. &quot;It shows the building of the railroad and a span of Wyatt&#x27;s life. So in many ways it presented the challenges I was looking for. It&#x27;s a big bite of a movie and there are things in it that are as good as anything I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot;

The film suffered at the box office—making $20 million on a $60 million budget—in part because of &quot;Tombstone&quot;, the concurrent film starring Kurt Russell as Earp and Val Kilmer as Holliday. &quot;Tombstone&quot;″s writer and original director, Kevin Jarre (who was eventually fired from the project), had actually planned to make an Earp story with Costner, but the two had different ideas about its tone and direction, and each went his own way. &quot;Tombstone&quot; was in production at the same time, but released on Christmas Eve, 1993—six months before &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;.

&quot;&quot;Tombstone&quot; hurt us,&quot; said editor Carol Littleton, &quot;because it&#x27;s a completely different kind of film, and it was a little more hip and it was not quite as serious.&quot;

==== Later films (1995-present) ====
Meg Ryan, who at the time was married to &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; star Dennis Quaid, brought Kasdan a script she&#x27;d commissioned for herself. Written by Adam Brooks, it was about a woman who overcomes her fear of flying and goes to Paris to confront her cheating fiancé, and in the process falls for a French thief. Kasdan was drawn to the project, he said, because &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have to write something new. I&#x27;d just done this really difficult movie and I thought, well, I&#x27;ll go to France with my family for a while. I love France.&quot;

He cast Timothy Hutton as the cheating fiancé, Charlie, and Kline as Luc Teyssier, the thief.

&quot;French Kiss&quot; was released on May 5, 1995. It earned nearly $39 million in the U.S. and more than $101 million internationally.

&quot;Mumford&quot; (1999)

After &quot;French Kiss&quot;, Kasdan wrote a spec script for Disney called &quot;Sojourner&quot;—a large-scale fantasy film set in the 1930s about a father and son. &quot;I love effects,&quot; he said, &quot;but they very rarely are married to a story that interests me. So I wrote one of my kind of stories, one involving effects. It made for a very expensive project, requiring not just one but two movie stars.&quot; He went into pre-production on the film with Mel Gibson attached to star—but then pulled the plug, and instead wrote the screenplay for &quot;Mumford&quot;.

The story is about a psychologist named Mumford with a secret past, who moves to a &quot;town&quot; called Mumford and starts treating its troubled citizens. Kasdan cast Loren Dean in the title role, alongside Hope Davis, Jason Lee, Mary McDonnell, Alfre Woodard, Martin Short, and Ted Danson. It came out on September 24, 1999, and fared poorly at the box office, making only $4.5 million. Critical response was divided.

&quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; (2003)

Kasdan&#x27;s most poorly received film was &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;, an adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s 2001 book. Written during King&#x27;s recovery from being hit by a van in 1999, the story is about four friends and a boy with special powers, involving aliens, telepathy, and extreme body horror. King later said he wrote much of it on Oxycontin.

Kasdan co-wrote the adaptation with William Goldman, screenwriter of &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; and &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;. &quot;If you read the book,&quot; Kasdan said, &quot;the pain is all over the book.&quot;

&quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; was produced by Castle Rock Entertainment and shot in British Columbia. The cast included Morgan Freeman, Thomas Jane, Damian Lewis, Timothy Olyphant, and Donnie Wahlberg. It came out on March 21, 2003, and made $82 million worldwide.

&quot;Darling Companion&quot; (2012)

Nine years passed between &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; and Kasdan&#x27;s next film, &quot;Darling Companion&quot;. During that time he adapted a script from Richard Russo&#x27;s novel &quot;The Risk Pool&quot;, which he was developing with Tom Hanks as the lead, as well as a few other aborted projects. He eventually decided to make an independent film, based on an incident from his and Meg&#x27;s own life, when their dog got lost in the mountains of Colorado.

&quot;Darling Companion&quot; was independently financed by his company, Kasdan Pictures, along with Werc Werk Works and Likely Story. Since it was made on a modest $5 million budget, the ensemble cast—which included Kline, Diane Keaton, Richard Jenkins, Dianne Wiest, and Mark Duplass—worked for scale. Kasdan shot the film on digital for the first time, on location in Utah. It came out on April 27, 2012.

=== Projects in development ===
As of 2020, Kasdan is working on a documentary about record label executive Mo Ostin, and the adaptation of a novel called &quot;November Road&quot;.

&quot;Directing is the greatest job in the world, but the process is so hard,&quot; he said in 1991. &quot;Each picture is like a child, a huge investment of heart and work. I decided that I want to work a lot while I have the interest in and the energy for it. Then if the time comes when I’m not having fun, I can walk away.&quot; As of 2022, Kasdan has directed only two feature films in 22 years.

=== Style and inspirations ===
As a screenwriter, Kasdan was influenced by classic English literature, plays, and the literary films of the 1940s, &#x27;50s, and &#x27;60s. He said:

If you&#x27;re trained the way I was, it&#x27;s classical dramatic training, in which you learn how plays have been constructed since they started writing plays. I think that has served me very well in Hollywood, because a lot of the people writing screenplays don&#x27;t have a literary background. Many young screenwriters today come from television. It&#x27;s not that they worked in television; it&#x27;s that they grew up on television and they think the way narrative is presented on television is narrative, but it ain&#x27;t. And so, if anything, I believe in classic dramatic construction, and I believe in the force and momentum that good narrative creates as it builds on itself.

He said his scripts all begin with their characters:

Characters present themselves, and the story follows. Alvin Sargent [screenwriter of &quot;Julia&quot; (1977) and &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980)] said a great thing to me. We were talking about how all of our inspiration always starts with character. Not plot. Not story. And that we wish it were otherwise; and that, in fact, the American movie tradition is about narrative. It&#x27;s not about character. And he said, &#x27;When I die, on my tombstone, it&#x27;s going to say: &#x27;Finally, a plot.&quot; I identified with that very strongly.

Of his directing style, Kasdan said:

I think that my personality is shy, reticent, in some ways; I&#x27;m conservative—I don&#x27;t wear flashy clothes. I think that&#x27;s true of my style, too, not that I don&#x27;t like things that are startlingly innovative. ... For me, the idea is, is the camera where you want it to be, not are you showing it off? ... What I admire about Kurosawa is the Zen perfection of his camera placement, the rightness of it. That&#x27;s the idea I&#x27;m striving for—but style is not something that drives my pictures.

On working with actors, he said:

I&#x27;m drawn to a very strong, non-fussy, hopefully a non-absorbed, kind of acting. I want great listeners. They aren&#x27;t in competition with the other actors in the frame. They&#x27;re there to support and to make the other actor better. I&#x27;m interested in people who are interested in submitting themselves to roles, to a story, to knowing that sometimes the grander action is the wrong action, the showier action is the wrong action. Sometimes repose is the most appropriate response to something. My movies are cut and acted on the reactions, not the actions. I think that&#x27;s where the secrets of life are revealed. Not necessarily in what we say, but how we react to what we hear.

In 2012, Kasdan participated in the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; film polls. Held every ten years to select the greatest films of all time, contemporary directors were asked to select ten films of their choice. Kasdan picked the following, in alphabetical order:

* &quot;Army of Shadows&quot; (1969)
* &quot;The Battle of Algiers&quot; (1966)
* &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1963)
* &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972)
* &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1940)
* &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962)
* &quot;Out of the Past&quot; (1947)
* &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; (1939)
* &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954)
* &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; (1947)

=== Producer and onscreen parts ===
Kasdan has produced several films he did not direct: &quot;Cross My Heart&quot; (1987), &quot;Immediate Family&quot; (1989)—written by his &quot;The Big Chill&quot; co-writer Barbara Benedek—&quot;Jumpin&#x27; at the Boneyard&quot; (1991), &quot;Home Fries&quot; (1998), &quot;The TV Set&quot; (2006)—written and directed by Jake Kasdan—and &quot;In the Land of Women&quot; (2007), written and directed by Jonathan Kasdan.

He has made several cameo appearances in his own films: as River Phoenix&#x27;s lawyer in &quot;I Love You to Death&quot;, a director in &quot;Grand Canyon&quot;, a gambler in &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;, and a man walking a dog in &quot;Darling Companion&quot;. He played Jack Nicholson&#x27;s psychiatrist in &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot; (1997), directed by James L. Brooks.

<text>Pineapple Express is a specific recurring atmospheric river both in the waters immediately northeast of the Hawaiian Islands and extending northeast to any location along the Pacific coast of North America. It is a non-technical term and a meteorological phenomenon. It is characterized by a strong and persistent large-scale flow of warm moist air, and the associated heavy precipitation. A Pineapple Express is an example of an atmospheric river, which is a more general term for such relatively narrow corridors of enhanced water vapor transport at mid-latitudes around the world.

==Causes and effects==
A &quot;Pineapple Express&quot; is driven by a strong, southern branch of the polar jet stream and is marked by the presence of a surface frontal boundary which is typically either slow or stationary, with waves of low pressure traveling along its length. Each of these low-pressure systems brings enhanced rainfall.

The conditions are often created by the Madden–Julian oscillation, an equatorial rainfall pattern which feeds its moisture into this pattern. They are also present during an El Niño episode.

The combination of moisture-laden air, atmospheric dynamics, and orographic enhancement resulting from the passage of this air over the mountain ranges of the western coast of North America causes some of the most torrential rains to occur in the region. &quot;Pineapple Express&quot; systems typically generate heavy snowfall in the mountains and Interior Plateau, which often melts rapidly because of the warming effect of the system. After being drained of their moisture, the tropical air masses reach the inland prairies as a Chinook wind or simply &quot;a Chinook&quot;, a term which is also synonymous in the Pacific Northwest with the &quot;Pineapple Express&quot;.

==Extreme cases==
Many Pineapple Express events follow or occur simultaneously with major arctic troughs in the northwestern United States, often leading to major snow-melt flooding with warm, tropical rains falling on frozen, snow laden ground. Examples of this are the Christmas flood of 1964, Willamette Valley flood of 1996, New Year&#x27;s Day Flood of 1997, January 2006 Flood in Northern California and Nevada, Great Coastal Gale of 2007, January 2008 Flood in Nevada, January 2009 Flood in Washington, the January 2012 Flood in Oregon, the 2019 Valentine&#x27;s Day Flood in Southern California, and the February 2020 floods in Oregon and Washington.

===West coast, 1862===
Early in 1862, extreme storms riding the Pineapple Express battered the west coast for 45 days. In addition to a sudden snow melt, some places received an estimated of rain, leading to the worst flooding in recorded history of California, Oregon, and Nevada, known as the Great Flood of 1862. Both the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys flooded, and there was extensive flooding and mudslides throughout the region.

===Northern California, 1952===
The San Francisco Bay Area is another locale along the Pacific Coast which is occasionally affected by a Pineapple Express. When it visits, the heavy, persistent rainfall typically causes flooding of local streams as well as urban flooding. In the decades before about 1980, the local term for a &quot;Pineapple Express&quot; was &quot;Hawaiian Storm&quot;. During the second week of January 1952, a series of &quot;Hawaiian&quot; storms swept into Northern California, causing widespread flooding around the Bay Area.

The same storms brought a blizzard of heavy, wet snow to the Sierra Nevada Mountains, notoriously stranding the train &quot;City of San Francisco&quot; on 13 January.

===Northern California, 1955===
The greatest flooding in Northern California since the 1800s occurred in 1955 as a result of a series of Hawaiian storms, with the greatest damage in the Sacramento Valley around Yuba City.

===Southern California, 2005===
A Pineapple Express related storm battered Southern California from January 7–11, 2005. This storm was the largest to hit Southern California since the storms that hit during the 1997–98 El Niño event. The storm caused mud slides and flooding, with one desert location just north of Morongo Valley receiving about of rain, and some locations on south and southwest-facing mountain slopes receiving spectacular totals: San Marcos Pass, in Santa Barbara County, received , and Opids Camp (AKA Camp Hi-Hill) in the San Gabriel Mountains of Los Angeles County was deluged with of rain in the five-day period. In some areas the storm was followed by over a month of near-continuous rain.

===Alaska, 2006===
The unusually intense rainstorms that hit south-central Alaska in October 2006 were called &quot;Pineapple Express&quot; rains locally.

===Pacific Northwest, 2006===

The Puget Sound region from Olympia, Washington to Vancouver, British Columbia received several inches of rain per day in November 2006 from a series of successive Pineapple Express related storms that caused massive flooding in all major regional rivers and mudslides which closed the mountain passes. These storms included heavy winds which are not usually associated with the phenomenon. Regional dams opened their spillways to 100% as they had reached capacity because of rain and snowmelt. Officials referred to the storm system as &quot;the worst in a decade&quot; on 8 November 2006. Portions of Oregon were also affected, including over in one day at Lees Camp in the Coast Range, while the normally arid and sheltered Interior of British Columbia received heavy, coastal-magnitude rains.

===Southern California, December 2010===
In December 2010, a Pineapple Express system ravaged California from 15 to 22 December, bringing with it as much as of rain to the San Gabriel Mountains, and over of snow in the Sierra Nevada. Although the entire state was affected, the Southern California counties of San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside, San Diego, and Los Angeles bore the brunt of the system of storms, as coastal and hillside areas were impacted by mudslides and major flooding.

===California, December 2014===
In December 2014, a powerful winter storm enhanced by a Pineapple Express feature struck California, resulting in snow, wind, and flood watches. A blizzard warning was issued by the National Weather Service for the Northern Sierra Nevada for the first time in California since October 2009 and January 2008. The storm caused power outages for more than 50,000 people. It was thought to be the most powerful storm to impact California since the January 2010 California winter storms. A rare tornado touched down in Los Angeles on 12 December.

===West Coast, 2017===

Historically strong storms associated with the Pineapple Express brought flooding and mudslides to California, particularly the San Francisco Bay Area, destroying homes and closing numerous roads, including State Route 17, State Route 35, State Route 37, Interstate 80, State Route 12, State Route 1, State Route 84, State Route 9 and State Route 152.

The storm brought major snow to the Sierra Nevada and San Gabriel Mountains. A state record was recorded with places on the Sierra reaching up to of snow. The storm also brought not only significant flooding to the Los Angeles area and most of southern California (killing about 3 people), but also significant severe weather in that area.

===California, January 2021===
A powerful winter storm channeled a Pineapple Express into California from 26 to 29 January. One person was injured in one of the mudslides in Northern California, and many structures suffered damage. The storm killed at least two people in California. A significant length of California State Route 1 along the Big Sur collapsed into the ocean after massive amounts of rain were dumped, causing a debris flow onto the highway, which in turn triggered the collapse. In Southern California, the storm triggered widespread flooding and debris flows, forcing the evacuations of thousands of people and also causing widespread property damage. Salinas received of rainfall for the entire event causing mudflows that forced 7,000 people to evacuate. Across the State of California, the storm knocked out power to an estimated 575,000 people at one point, according to power outage tracking maps and PG&amp;E. In the mountainous parts of the state, the winter storm dropped tremendous amounts of heavy snow, with Mammoth Mountain Ski Area receiving within 72 hours, and a total of of snowfall for the entire event. Blizzard conditions were also recorded on parts of the Sierra Nevada. Very high wind gusts were also observed, with gusts over observed at Alpine Meadows, peaking at .

=== Pacific Northwest, 2021 ===
Heavy rains attributed to a Pineapple Express event heavily impacted the Puget Sound region from Bellingham, Washington into the British Columbia Interior and the Lower Mainland from 14 to 15 November. At the peak of the rainstorm on 15 November, Bellingham received of rain while Hope, B.C. measured rainfall of from 14 to 15 November. The resulting floods and ensuing mass wasting events forced the closure of all major Canadian road connections to Vancouver, British Columbia including Highway 1, the Coquihalla, and the Sea to Sky Highway.

===California, 2022–2023===

Heavy rains attributed to a Pineapple Express caused widespread flooding in the Bay Area.

=== California, February 2024 ===

A Pineapple Express storm hit the state from 1 to 2 February 2024, before moving over the United States and settling over the I-25 corridor in Colorado, where heavy snow fell. Another one hit 3 February and last until 5 February, with the National Weather Service calling it &quot;potentially life-threatening.&quot; Other news sources estimated that Los Angeles received six-months&#x27; worth of rain in the 48-hour period, while the Sierra Nevada mountains got of snow, with over of snow expected in higher elevations, such as Mammoth Lakes, CA. Parts of the San Bernardino Mountains&#x27; foothills received of rain.

<text>John Alexander Samford (August 29, 1905 – December 1, 1968) was a lieutenant general in the United States Air Force who served as Director of the National Security Agency.

==Early life and education==
Samford was born at Hagerman, New Mexico, in 1905. He graduated from high school in 1922 and then spent one year at Columbia University in New York City. In 1924, he received a senatorial appointment to the United States Military Academy. He graduated in 1928, 131st in a class of 260.

==Military career==
Samford&#x27;s first assignment was that of a student officer at Brooks Field, Texas. In 1929, he received his pilot wings at Kelly Field and was eventually rated a command pilot.

Samford was next assigned to Fort Crockett, located at Galveston, Texas. In 1930, he returned to Kelly Field where he served as a flying instructor. In 1934, he was ordered to an Engineering and Armament School at Chanute Field, Illinois. From 1935 until 1942, he held various assignments in Panama, Virginia, Louisiana and Florida.

Samford was assistant chief of staff, G-1, Headquarters Third Air Force, in Tampa, Florida, when appointed chief of staff of the VIII Air Force Composite Command located in Northern Ireland.
In 1943, Samford was appointed deputy chief of staff of the Eighth Air Force, and later chief of staff of the VIII Bomber Command.

In 1944, Samford was promoted to brigadier general and appointed chief of staff of the Eighth Air Force. In October 1944 he was appointed deputy assistant chief of staff, A-2, Headquarters U.S. Army Air Forces.

In January 1947, Samford was appointed commander, 24th Composite Wing which soon thereafter became the Antilles Air Division of the Caribbean Air Command.

In May 1949, Samford was appointed commandant of the Air Command and Staff School. He was promoted to major general in 1950 and held a brief appointment as commandant of the Air War College before being appointed director of intelligence for the United States Air Force.

It was during Samford&#x27;s tenure as director of Air Force intelligence that Project Blue Book, which investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) was started. On July 29, 1952, Samford conducted a press conference at the Pentagon related to UFOs. Samford was mentioned at the beginning of the 1956 film &quot;UFO&quot; which examined the phenomena of unidentified flying objects.

Samford served as Vice Director of the National Security Agency from June to August 1956. In November, Samford was appointed director of the National Security Agency and promoted to lieutenant general. He held this post until his retirement on November 23, 1960.

<text>The Uruguay River ( ; ) is a major river in South America. It flows from north to south and forms parts of the boundaries of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, separating some of the Argentine provinces of La Mesopotamia from the other two countries. It passes between the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil; forms the eastern border of the provinces of Misiones, Corrientes and Entre Ríos in Argentina; and makes up the western borders of the departments of Artigas, Salto, Paysandú, Río Negro, Soriano and Colonia in Uruguay.

==Etymology==
The name of the river tends to comes from the Spanish settlers&#x27; interpretation of the Guaraní language word the inhabitants of the region used to designate it. There are several interpretations, including &quot;the river of the uru (an indigenous bird)&quot;, and &quot;[river of] the uruguá&quot; (an indigenous gastropod, &quot;Pomella megastoma&quot;).

==Course==

The river measures about in length and starts in the Serra do Mar in Brazil, where the Canoas River and the Pelotas River are joined, at about above mean sea level. At this stage, the river goes through uneven, broken terrain, forming rapids and falls. Its course through Rio Grande do Sul is not navigable.

An unusual feature of the Uruguay River is a submerged canyon. This canyon formed during the Ice Age, when the climate was drier and the river was narrower. Its depth is up to below the bottom of the river channel and it is one-eighth to one-third as wide as the river. The canyon is only visible in two places, one of which is the Moconá Falls (also called the Yucumã Falls). However, the falls are not visible for 150 days per year and become more like rapids when they are not visible. Unlike most waterfalls, the Moconá Falls are parallel to the river, not perpendicular. The falls are to high and between and wide. They are from the mouth of the river. The Turvo State Park, created in 1947, protects the Brazilian side of the falls.

Together with the Paraná River, the Uruguay forms the Río de la Plata estuary. It is navigable from around Salto Chico. Its main tributary is the Río Negro, which is born in the south of Brazil and goes through Uruguay for 500 km until its confluence with the Uruguay River, which is located 100 km north of the Uruguay&#x27;s confluence with the Río de la Plata, in Punta Gorda, Colonia Department, Uruguay.

The river is crossed by five international bridges called (from north to south): Integration Bridge and Paso de los Libres-Uruguaiana International Bridge, between Argentina and Brazil; and the Salto Grande Bridge, General Artigas Bridge and Libertador General San Martín Bridge between Argentina and Uruguay.

The drainage basin of the Uruguay River has an area of . Its main economic use is the generation of hydroelectricity and it is dammed in its lower portion by the Salto Grande Dam and by the Itá Dam upstream in Brazil.

==Cellulose plant conflict==
Argentina and Uruguay experienced a conflict over the construction of pulp mills on the Uruguay River. Two European companies, ENCE and Botnia, proposed building cellulose processing plants at Fray Bentos, Uruguay, opposite Gualeguaychú, Argentina. According to a 1975 treaty, Argentina and Uruguay were supposed to jointly agree on matters relating to the Uruguay River. Argentina alleged that Uruguay broke the treaty. Additionally, Argentina believed the Finnish company Botnia was polluting the fish and the overall environment of the river while Uruguay believed that the plant was not depositing a large amount of toxins in the Uruguay River.

Starting in April 2005, residents of Gualeguaychú, as well as many others, protested, claiming that the plants would pollute the river shared by the two countries. Early in 2006, the conflict escalated into a diplomatic crisis, compelling one of the companies move the project south. Beginning in December 2005, the international bridges linking the Argentine province of Entre Ríos with Uruguay were intermittently blockaded by Argentine protesters, causing major disruptions in commercial traffic and tourism.

In 2006, Argentina brought the dispute before the International Court of Justice. The ICJ completed hearings between Argentina and Uruguay regarding the dispute on October 2, 2009. In 2010, the court ruled that although Uruguay failed to inform Argentina of the construction of the pulp mills, the mills did not pollute the river, so closing the remaining pulp mill would be unjustified. Later in 2010, Argentina and Uruguay created a joint commission to coordinate activities on the river.

<doc id="478654" wikidata="Q921222" url="?curid=478654" title="Skate-class submarine">
<text>The &quot;Skate&quot;-class submarines were the United States Navy&#x27;s first production run of nuclear-powered submarines. They were an evolution of the in everything except their propulsion plants, which were based on the operational prototype . The four &quot;Skate&quot; class boats re-introduced stern torpedo tubes. Although among the smallest nuclear-powered attack submarines ever built, the &quot;Skate&quot; class served for many years, with the last being decommissioned in 1989. USS &quot;Skate&quot; was the first submarine to surface at the North Pole, on 17 March 1959.

&quot;Skate&quot; and &quot;Sargo&quot; were built with the S3W reactor, &quot;Swordfish&quot; and &quot;Seadragon&quot; also had the S3W reactor in the S4W reactor plant (same machinery in an alternate arrangement).

==Design==

The &quot;Skate&quot; class were designed under project SCB 121 as economical production nuclear-powered submarines (SSNs), and thus were smaller and more austere than their ground-breaking predecessor , whose high cost had raised concerns. They were designed before &quot;Nautilus&quot; demonstrated the advantages of sustained high underwater speed, thus their designed speed was about the maximum speed of the conventional &quot;Tang&quot; class, which had a similar displacement to the &quot;Skate&quot;s. Their S3W reactor was a scaled-down version of &quot;Nautilus&quot;″ S2W reactor with about half the power output; it was known as SFR (Submarine Fleet Reactor) during development. A slightly modified version known as S4W powered the second pair of &quot;Skate&quot;-class boats. Unfortunately, scaling down the reactor did not reduce the weight of reactor shielding proportionally, and it was eventually realized that further downsizing was impractical. In the late 1950s it was hoped that the nuclear-powered aircraft program would develop reactors suitable for very small SSNs, but the program was unsuccessful. Their armament was the same as the &quot;Tang&quot;s, six bow and two stern 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. Like the &quot;Tang&quot;s, the stern tubes had no ejection pump, and could only be used for swim-out weapons such as the Mark 37 ASW homing torpedo. The quest for a high submerged speed and improved sonar led to the subsequent and es becoming the model for further development.

==Service==

&quot;Skate&quot; was notable as the first submarine to surface at the North Pole, on 17 March 1959. A previous attempt in 1958 had resulted in no suitable place found for surfacing near the Pole. &quot;Sargo&quot; and &quot;Seadragon&quot; also conducted significant polar operations in their careers. This class was the most suited for ice breakthrough attempts until the , with fairwater planes that could be rotated vertically, entered service beginning in 1967. After 25–30 years each of successful service, mostly out of Pearl Harbor, the class was retired in the 1980s and disposed of through the Navy&#x27;s nuclear Ship-Submarine Recycling Program.

<doc id="478656" wikidata="Q496415" url="?curid=478656" title="Ulva">
<text>Ulva (; ) is a small island in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland, off the west coast of Mull. It is separated from Mull by a narrow strait, and connected to the neighbouring island of Gometra by a bridge. Much of the island is formed from Cenozoic basalt rocks, which are formed into columns in places.

Ulva has been populated since the Mesolithic period, and there are various Neolithic remains on the island. The Norse occupation of the island in the Early Middle Ages has left few tangible artefacts but did bequeath the island its name, which is probably from &quot;Ulvoy&quot;, meaning &quot;wolf island&quot;. Celtic culture was a major influence during both Pictish and Dalriadan times as well as the post-Norse period when the islands became part of modern Scotland. This long period, when Gaelic became the dominant language, was ended by the 19th-century Clearances. At its height, Ulva had a population of over 800, but by May 2019, this had declined to 5; some increase in the number of residents was expected in future, with the re-population plan that was to commence in 2020.

Numerous well-known individuals have connections with the island including David Livingstone, Samuel Johnson and Walter Scott, who drew inspiration from Ulva for his 1815 poem, &quot;The Lord of the Isles&quot;. Wildlife is abundant: cetaceans are regularly seen in the surrounding waters and over 500 species of plant have been recorded. Today there is a regular ferry service and tourism is the mainstay of the economy. In March 2018 the Scottish Land Fund pledged £4.4 million towards a community buyout of the island, and the North West Mull Community Woodland Company took ownership of the island on 21 June 2018.

==Geography==

Ulva is roughly oval in shape with an indented coastline. It is aligned east-west, being long, and wide. Viewed on a small scale, Ulva and its neighbouring island Gometra appear to be a peninsula of the Isle of Mull, as they are separated from one another by narrow straits. Caolas Ulbha (the Sound of Ulva) at the east of the island is a narrow channel a few hundred metres across to Ulva Ferry on Mull. To its west, it is separated from Gometra by Gometra Harbour. To the south are Mull&#x27;s headlands of Ardmeanach and the Ross of Mull. To the north, Loch Tuath (Loch-a-Tuath) separates it from another headland of Mull, and to the south east is Loch na Keal (Loch nan Ceall), and the island of Eorsa. There are two main bays on the south coast, Port a&#x27; Bhàta, and Tràigh Bhàn. On the north coast, there is the horseshoe bay of Lòn Bhearnuis (Bearnus lagoon), Soriby Bay and a few minor inlets.

The highest point of Ulva is Beinn Chreagach (&quot;rocky mountain&quot;), which reaches . It has a neighbour in Beinn Eoligarry the summit of which is above sea level. The island has a central ridge, with the highest ground running along its lateral axis - this ridge is somewhat broken by Gleann Glas and some other valleys. The south east peninsula tends to be lower lying, with a small plain along the south coast, consisting of raised beaches.

===Parish and region===
Ulva was part of Argyll pre-1974, and Strathclyde Region after that. It is now part of Argyll and Bute.

The island, previously a quoad sacra parish with its own church, is in the civil parish of Kilninian and Kilmore (&quot;Cill Ninein&quot;, &quot;Chille Mhór&quot;), which also includes Gometra, Staffa, Little Colonsay and the north-west part of Mull. The minister traditionally preached in Kilninian and Kilmore on alternate Sundays. For more details, see the church section.

===Surrounding islands===

Gometra is a tidal island and connected to Ulva by a bridge. Little Colonsay and Inchkenneth (with Samalan Island) are to Ulva&#x27;s south west and south east respectively. Further to the west are the Treshnish Isles, including the distinctive Bac Mòr, and beyond them, the larger islands of Coll and Tiree, with Gunna between them. To the south west are the islands of Staffa, of Fingal&#x27;s Cave fame and Erisgeir. Much further to the south west is the island of Iona.

There are a number of smaller islets and rocks off Ulva. To the south and the east are Eilean na Creiche (listed as &quot;Eilean na Craoibhe&quot;, on the island&#x27;s guide&#x27;s map.) between Little Colonsay and Ulva. Off Port a&#x27; Bhàta are Geasgill Beag &amp; Geasgill Mòr, between Ulva and Inchkenneth. To the south west is Sgeir na Sgeireadh, and Màisgeir due south of Gometra. These islands, along with Ulva itself, form part of the Loch na Keal National Scenic Area, one of the forty national scenic areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development.

==Geology==

Ulva&#x27;s interior is moorland, while the spectacular geological formations of the south coast, have been somewhat overshadowed by those of its neighbour Staffa. Nonetheless, they are still renowned in their own right. Around 60 million years ago, the region was volcanically active, with Ben More on Mull being the remnant of a volcano, and it was in this period that the famous rock formations of Staffa and the basaltic columns of &quot;The Castles&quot; on Ulva came into being. The lava flows are known as the &quot;Staffa Magma Type member&quot; and can also be seen on Mull at Carsaig, Ardtum, and near Tobermory on its east coast. They are particularly rich in silica. These were formed when the cooling surface of the mass of hot lava cracked in a hexagonal pattern in a similar way to drying mud cracking as it shrinks, and these cracks gradually extended down into the mass of lava as it cooled and shrank to form the columns which were subsequently exposed by erosion.

Much more recently, Ulva was subjected to glaciation, which dug out the fjords/sea lochs on its north and south east sides – Loch Tuath (meaning simply &quot;north loch&quot;) and Loch na Keal, as well as softening some of its sharper edges.

The Hebridean coastline has been subject to significant post-glacial changes in sea level and the area is rising up at about per annum as isostatic equilibrium is regained. The relative drop in sea-level has left the highest raised sea cave in the British Isles on Ulva at A&#x27; Chrannag. At some point, Ulva was probably a west pointing headland of Mull, connected to Gometra and Eilean Dioghlum off the latter&#x27;s west coast.

==Etymology==
The derivation of &quot;Ulva&quot; is not certain, but is probably from the Old Norse for &quot;wolf isle&quot;. Samuel Johnson deduced that it was probably not Gaelic in origin:

The English name &quot;Ulva&quot; is from the Scottish Gaelic, &quot;Ulbha&quot;, but this may have been corruption of Old Norse. It is debatable whether the Norse root &quot;Ulfr&quot; refers to an individual&#x27;s name, or to the animal itself (possibly because of the shape of the island). The island&#x27;s official website and guide book claims -

However &quot;ullamhdha&quot; is not Norse, but appears to be the Scottish Gaelic for &quot;ready for it&quot;. Munro and MacQuarrie (1996) state that the scout said &quot;ullamh dha&quot; () in Gaelic, meaning the island &quot;was ready for occupation&quot;.

The &quot;Old Statistical Account of Scotland&quot; mentions an alternative folk etymology, namely that Ulva comes from &quot;ullamh-àth&quot; () meaning &#x27;ready ford&#x27; in Gaelic, that could refer either to the tidal stretch with Gometra, or the Sound of Ulva over which cattle were sometimes swum.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Ulva&#x27;s human history goes back thousands of years. Its standing stones have been dated to 1500 BC, and a shell midden in Livingstones Cave dates to c. 5650 BC; it includes remains of flint and a human infant, as well as fauna more appropriate to the Ice Age, such as lemming and Arctic fox (&quot;Alopex lagopus&quot;). The cave has been excavated since 1987 by archaeologists from the University of Edinburgh.

There are a number of dolmens and standing stones on the island, including some west of Cragaig, and one north east of Ormaig, as well as &quot;dùn&quot;s such as Dùn Bhioramuill on the south east slope of A&#x27; Chrannag near Cùl a&#x27; Gheata above the cliffs, and Dùn Iosagain on the south west slope of Beinn Eolasary.

===Dál Riata===
Ulva was anciently part of the border zone of the kingdom of Dál Riata, and during this period the old Gaelic language first came to be spoken here. Presumably the area formed part of the Pictish lands, but they left little evidence behind. This region was amongst the first in northern Scotland to become Christianised. This is commemorated in some of the local place names which contain the word &quot;Cill&quot; or &quot;Ceall&quot;, which is frequently anglicised as &quot;Kil-&quot; e.g. &quot;Loch na Keal&quot; is &quot;Loch nan Ceall&quot;, meaning &quot;loch of the culdee cells&quot;, and Cille Mhic Eoghainn, which means literally &quot;Monk&#x27;s cell of the son of Ewan/MacEwan&quot;, or less literally &quot;MacEwan&#x27;s Church&quot;.

The &quot;Senchus fer n-Alban&quot; lists three main kin groups in Dál Riata in Scotland, with a fourth being added later. The Cenél Loairn controlled parts of northern Argyll around the Firth of Lorne, most probably centred on Lorne but perhaps including the Isle of Mull, Morvern and Ardnamurchan, supposedly the descendants of Loarn mac Eirc. The chief place of the kingdom appears to have been at Dun Ollaigh, near Oban. The chief religious site may have been on Lismore, later the seat of the High Medieval bishop of Argyll.

Saint Columba (Colm Cille) visited Ulva in 563.

===Norse period and Middle Ages===
Ulva later became part of the Norse Kingdom of the Isles. Rubha nan Gall (&quot;point of the foreigners&quot;), on the north coast of the island, may refer to the Norse.

Gometra and Inchkenneth nearby both have connections to Iona so it is not likely that Ulva had as well. Ulva came under the Diocese of Sodor and Man, and then the Diocese of Argyll.

Ulva came into the possession of the Clan MacQuarrie (an anglicised version of the surname &quot;MacGuaire&quot;) family over a thousand years ago, and they controlled it until the mid-19th century. The name &quot;MacGuaire&quot; is also anglicised as &quot;McGuire&quot; in Ireland. The English version has many variants, for examples, a 16th-century clan chief was Donn-slèibhe MacGuaire, possibly the ancestor of the Livingstone (MacDhùn-lèibhe) family. MacKenzie mentions that his name was anglicised in the following widely differing versions - &quot;Dunslavie McVoirich&quot; (either &quot;MacMhuirich&quot; (which becomes &quot;Currie&quot; or &quot;MacPherson&quot;) or &quot;MacMhurchaidh&quot;), &quot;Dulleis MacKwiddy&quot;, &quot;Dwnsleif MacKcurra&quot; and &quot;Dwnsleyf MaKwra&quot;. &quot;Dunslav&quot; was recorded as a forename in Ulva in 1693 as well.

The Ulva Brooch was found in a pool of water in a cave in 1998. Its exact date of origin is unknown, but it is reckoned to be 16th or 17th century. The original is now in a museum in Dunoon, and a replica can be seen in Sheila&#x27;s Cottage on the island. It is an engraved woman&#x27;s brooch, for keeping a shawl tied together, and is believed to have been left in the cave after someone sheltered there.

===18th century===
In 1722, the inhabitants of Ulva were sent to a court in Inveraray, because they had taken oil from a stranded whale.

During the second Jacobite uprising, Clan MacQuarrie fought at Culloden on Charles Edward Stuart&#x27;s side.

The Rev. John Walker lamented the lack of commercial fishing, which he thought could provide the islanders with an additional income and food source. He noted the presence of herring, cod, and ling in the surrounding waters, but said, that there was

====Lachlan Macquarie====
Lachlan Macquarie was born on Ulva 31 January 1762. He is sometimes referred to as &quot;Father of Australia&quot;. He left when he was 14, and was Governor of New South Wales from 1809–21, the longest tenure of any Australian governor. However, after his long sojourns in India, Australia and elsewhere, Lachlan Macquarie returned to his home turf. His mausoleum may still be seen at Gruline on Loch na Keal, on the Isle of Mull, within sight of his home island. The mausoleum is possibly the only site in Scotland maintained by the National Trust of Australia.

His father, who had the same name, was a cousin of the sixteenth and last chieftain of the clan. According to local tradition, he was either a miller or a carpenter. There is some argument as to where exactly he was born: Ormaig is generally stated, because he appears to have come from that branch of the clan. It has even been suggested that he was born on the near section of Mull – at either Oskamull or Lagganulva, but local tradition says he was born at Cùl a&#x27; Gheata, which is south of Ulva House.
Clan Macquarrie Lachlan MacQuarrie, the last chief to live on the island, claimed that his clan had possessed Ulva since the 9th century; and although the chiefs are not on public record until the mid-15th century, they can produce a pedigree of sorts going back to the 13th. They even claim kinship with Saint Columba. General Lachlan MacQuarrie, the most famous member of the clan, was possibly born at Ormaig on the Mull side after his parents moved there from Ulva. After a military career, he became the first Governor of New South Wales and Australians make pilgrimages to his mausoleum at Gruline on Mull.

The men of Ulva were known in sonorous Gaelic as &quot;the fierce, fearless, great-feated MacQuarries&quot;. Their war cry was &quot;The Red Tartan Army&quot; and they took part in many far flung battles – at Inverkeithing, Bannockburn, in the colonies. Graves of MacQuarries at Culloden are on the right hand side where other Mull men rest. They followed the MacLeans who joined Prince Charles under MacLean of Drimnin at Stirling. An Ulva man carried the banner back from Culloden. With it wrapped around his body, he swam home across the sound. David Livingston was a descendant of this warrior.

MacQuarrie needed to sell Ulva in 1777 to pay his debts but many of his clan remained on the island for over a century.

In 1787, Macquarie came back to Mull and Ulva, to try to recruit men for the British army. Few Ulbhachs had any interest, and he deemed them &quot;ungrateful&quot;:

Whilst in India, Macquarie sent significant amounts of money back to support kith and kin in Ulva and the Highlands.

===19th century===
By the early 19th century, potatoes were a major staple of the island, and Ulva exported them.

The main remnants of Clan MacQuarrie&#x27;s chiefs fell at the battles of Malda and Waterloo. Their mother Marie was given a medal by King George IV with the slogan &quot;Màthair nan Gaisgich&quot; - &quot;mother of heroes&quot; on it.

====Kelp industry====
Until the mid-19th century its main industry was kelp collection and export primarily operated by Staffa MacDonald who bought the island in 1785 because of the kelp. At the turn of the 19th century, the kelp industry supported a large amount of the population. It was seasonal work, with collection taking place in the months of May, June and July, when it was considered possible to dry it outdoors. The dried kelp would usually then be burnt, and the ash used to produce various products, including fertiliser (mostly soda ash) and iodine as well as glass and soap. The ruined kiln on the south shore may have been used for this. Between 1817 and 1828, no less than 256 tonnes of kelp were collected in Ulva. Kelpers collected on average, a wage of two shillings a week, and a stone of wheat.

Ulva&#x27;s Kelp Industry Seaweed plays an important role in the history of Ulva. It was burned to produce kelp, a product in great demand in the early 19th century for making glass and soap. Being a labour-intensive process (it took 20 tons of seaweed to produce 1 ton of kelp) Ulva&#x27;s population grew to meet the demands of cutting, carrying and burning enough seaweed for an average output of 23 tons of kelp per year. In 1785 Ulva was purchased by a pioneer of the kelp burning industry and his son, Staffa MacDonald was reputed to have &quot;trebled his income and doubled his population by careful attention to his kelp shores&quot;.

====The Clearances====

Francis William Clark, a lawyer from Stirling, bought the island in 1835. According to the Isle of Mull website, Ulva was booming in 1837, with a population of 604 people.

After the Clearances ordered by Clark, two-thirds of the islanders were gone within a few years. Sometimes those who were to be evicted were given no warning, and had the thatch of their houses set on fire by &quot;brutal landowners who replaced them with more economically sound sheep&quot;, according to one news report. In 1841, the population of Ulva and Gometra was 859, but by 1848 this had plummeted to 150 thanks to a combination of the Highland potato famine and Clark&#x27;s mass evictions. In 1849, 360 people lived on Ulva, but that number had dropped to 51 by 1881. 

MacKenzie records at Aird Glas, near Ardalum, the now abandoned row of houses was nicknamed &quot;Starvation Terrace&quot;:

He thinks however, that the plan may not have been to starve them, but to create fishing stations of the type which Walker lamented the lack of. This is certainly what was attempted in Sutherland. Opinions on Clark remain divided. The island&#x27;s guidebook claims:

One of Clark&#x27;s neighbours did not think much of his concern, and is reported to have shouted &quot;Francis William Clark, there&#x27;s a smell of your name all over Scotland&quot;.

MacKenzie further notes, that unlike in Sutherland, where the Clearances are most remembered, there was no factor or middle man to provide a buffer between the tenants and the landlord, like the notorious Patrick Sellar, and that Clark did a lot of the evicting himself.

In evidence to the Napier Commission, Alexander Fletcher recounted that Clark moved people from one piece of land to a small one, repeatedly &quot;then to nothing at all, and when they would not clear off altogether, some of them had the roofs taken off their huts.&quot;

Fletcher also claimed that Clark bullied the sick and the elderly: &quot;In another case, there was a very sick woman... Notwithstanding the critical condition of the woman, he [F. W. Clark] had the roof taken down to a small bit over the woman&#x27;s bed.&quot; Another recorded that a woman fetching water at a well was so terrified of him, that she &quot;ran away, and left her kettle at the well, which Mr Clark took hold of and smashed to pieces.&quot;

F. W. Clark was still alive at the time of the reports to the Napier Commission, and never made any attempt to refute these accusations. His son, of the same name, disagreed vocally with his father&#x27;s behaviour and said, &quot;he would rather have a &quot;cailleach&quot; (old woman) to light his pipe in every ruined house than all the sheep... of Ulva&quot;.

The Clark family continued to own the island until 1945. F. W. Clark also bought, and cleared, the islands of Gometra and Little Colonsay.

Here is a list of some of the cleared townships, and their current state.

(Notes: All information from MacKenzie (2000).)

Clark had a memorial built to himself, and his family on top of the Iron Age fort at Dùn Bhioramuill. A huge marble slab to F. W. Clark was &quot;accidentally&quot; lost in the mire, on its way to be placed here. Some say this was deliberate, but according to local folklore, this was due to the &quot;weight of evil on it&quot;. The other parts of the memorial may still be seen.

===20th century===

In &quot;The Scottish Field&quot; (September 1918), there is a description by Angus Henderson of how the cattle were driven to &quot;mainland&quot; Mull.

During the 20th century, the population of Ulva continued to fall. In 1981 it dropped to 13, the lowest point in recorded history until then. By 1991, however, it had risen to 30, mostly due to incomers working on the island. In 2001 the usually resident population was 16 but by 2011 it had decreased again to 11. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.

The Clarks owned the island for the best part of a century, selling it in 1945 to Edith, Lady Congleton, with her daughter Jean Howard then owning it, and her grandson James Howard as estate manager. Under the Howards, the population fluctuated, rather than falling continuously as it had under the Clarks.

In 1950, Queen Elizabeth and the royal yacht, &quot;Britannia&quot; visited.

In 2000, D. W. R. MacKenzie wrote &quot;As It Was/Sin Mar a Bha: An Ulva Boyhood&quot;, which is a combination of autobiography and a potted history of the island. His father was a Church of Scotland minister, who moved there from Rothesay, where he had been in charge of the Gaelic church there. MacKenzie describes his early impressions, as a child, of the island in the 1920s, and how the minister&#x27;s children slowly began to recognise the landscape of eviction:

According to a 2018 publication by Tourism Scotland, &quot;There are no tarmac roads on Ulva, so no cars, just the 4 wheel cross country bikes used by all inhabitants&quot;.

==Infrastructure and economy==

None of the island&#x27;s roads is tarmacked or numbered, due to the low population, and there are no fewer than six fords on the length of the southern road. There is however a bridge to Gometra, which can also be reached dry-shod at low tide. Like certain other islands, e.g. Sark, there are no cars, but quad bikes and tractors are used.

A ferry sails from Ulva to the hamlet of Ulva Ferry on Mull, on request. Ulva Primary School is in fact on Mull at Ulva Ferry. There are ruined school buildings still to be seen at Glac na Gallan and Fearann Àrd-àirigh.

Ulva&#x27;s main industry now is tourism. Other industries on the island include sheep and cattle farming, and fish farming (salmon at Soriby Bay). There is also a small sawmill. There is no hotel on the island, but there is a locked bothy at Cragaig which can be rented and camping is also possible. At Ardalum, there is a former shooting lodge, which is now a self-catering unit, and was also workers&#x27; accommodation for a while. There is a licensed restaurant/tea room on the island, &quot;The Boathouse&quot;, where locally harvested oysters are sold.

In the summer of 2017, the island was put up for sale by owner Jamie Howard. The North West Mull Community Trust was granted the right to register its interest in a community buyout, which was subsequently backed by 63.9% of voters in a poll ordered by the Scottish government, with residents of Ulva and part of Mull eligible to vote.

Subsequently, the government had stopped the attempt to sell Ulva on the open market. A fundraising appeal was launched and in March 2018 the Scottish Land Fund pledged £4.4 million towards a community buyout. John Watt, the chair of the Fund, stated that it was a &quot;momentous day&quot; for local residents. &quot;I wish them every success as they go on to raise the remaining funding that will allow them to turn their dreams into reality.&quot; The buyout was completed on 21 June 2018. The North West Mull Community Woodland Company acquired the Ulva Estate, through the Community Right to Buy legislation.

A 2019 news report provided the following specifics: &quot;The community company raised £4.4m from the Scottish Land Fund to buy Ulva from owner Jamie Howard, whose family had owned the island for 70 years. The total purchase cost £4.65m with a global fundraising effort helping to secure the balance&quot;.

===Re-development master plan===
By 21 June 2018, the sale of the island had been concluded. The subsequent master plan for the island involves making improvements, increasing the population and returning farming to Ulva. More specifically, the residents were &quot;hoping to create jobs here, build new affordable housing and tempt young Scots to make it their home&quot;. Some of the ideas discussed in spring 2018 included opening a campsite, hostel and mini-hotel and to commence oyster farming. Roughly 5,000 people visited the island each summer. In February 2019, repairs to the slipway and the connecting pier on Mull were completed, beneficial for both ferry passengers and fisherman working out of the Sound. The project was funded by Marine Scotland.

Restoration of the oldest blackhouse on the island was being completed in October 2019; it is the one closest to the ferry dock. The building is known as Sheila&#x27;s cottage, since it was the home of dairy maid Sheila MacFadgen from 1911 to the 1950s, the last resident of the row of cottages. This was the second significant step in the Ulva master plan.

At that time, Wendy Reid, Ulva’s development manager said that the hope was for the population to increase to 20 by 2024 and to 50 in the future. Six houses were scheduled for renovation, including three that were vacant; this process will help attract new residents to the island. By late 2019, news suggested that the population could &quot;soar by 6,000%&quot; as a result of the campaign to encourage people to move to the island. The large Ulva House was being converted into self catering flats. 

In January 2020, 30 Highland cattle were scheduled to be delivered to the island since the plan includes &quot;communion between humans, animals and nature&quot;, according to Reid. Until then, the island was supporting a small flock of wild Hebridean sheep and a few feral goats. During the year, efforts to refurbish other old dwellings would continue. The restorations were expected to be planned by the community and completed under the supervision of Argyll and Bute Council. Land sales would also commence. 

&quot;We want to attract people from all backgrounds, but also keeping one goal in common: to contribute to the wellbeing of the community with their skills and talents&quot;, Reid said. 

In May 2021, the island announced a drive to replace petrol and diesel-engined quad bikes with all electric vehicles, and the start of work to restore three tenanted homes and three vacant properties on the island.

==Wildlife==

===Fauna===
Ulva is known for its wildlife, which as is usual for many Scottish islands, includes many varieties of seabirds. A number of raptors breed on the island including buzzards and golden eagles. Game birds include snipe, grouse, pheasant, and woodcock. White-tailed eagles, which were reintroduced in the nearby Island of Rùm have migrated to Mull, where they now have a stronghold - they can occasionally be seen on Ulva, but are not known to nest there. Ravens also breed here. Puffin, black-legged kittiwakes, shag, common and Arctic tern, gannets, eider ducks, oystercatchers, curlews, redshanks, red-breasted mergansers and gulls nest on the island and the surrounding waters provide a livelihood for numerous seabirds. Occasional visitors (usually not breeding) include - house martins, Leach&#x27;s storm petrel, corncrakes (which are rare in the British Isles), peregrine falcons and spotted flycatchers.

Land mammals that can be found on the island, include red deer, rabbits, and mountain hares. Stoats and hedgehogs are occasionally sighted on the island as well. In 1986 the island&#x27;s otters were studied by experts from the University of Leeds - in the six weeks that they were there, they sighted the otters every evening. In regard to canids, there are no foxes on the island, although it has been suggested that the name &quot;Ulva&quot; - wolf isle - meant that wolves lived on the island in the Norse period.

There is only one known kind of reptile on the island, the pseudo-snake slowworm, but no true snakes have been reported. The name &quot;Ormaig&quot;, however, is probably a corruption of the Norse &quot;Ormrsvi&quot;, which means &quot;bay of the worm&quot; - this may refer to a snake.

Cetaceans that can be seen in the surrounding waters include minke whales, porpoises, dolphins, and pilot whales. Whales occasionally get beached on the island, more recent examples including 1966 (pilot), 1987 (pilot) and 1991 (two sperm whales). Grey seals and basking shark also frequent the area.

Ulva is also home to two extremely rare insects: the Scotch burnet moth, which can also be found on Mull, but nowhere else, and a dragonfly, &quot;Orthetrum coesilesceus&quot;.

===Flora===
More than 500 species of plant have been recorded on Ulva.

Bracken is particularly abundant on the island, with heather growing in some other parts. Wild flowers that grow here include &quot;Hyacinthoides non-scripta&quot; (&#x27;common&#x27; or &#x27;British&#x27; bluebells), &quot;Campanula rotundifolia&quot; (&#x27;bluebells of Scotland&#x27; or &#x27;harebells&#x27;), orchids, sundews (&quot;Drosera&quot;) and &quot;Dianthus&quot; (&quot;pinks&quot;).

Much of the island is treeless, but there are substantial stands in some places, especially near the island&#x27;s small reservoir.

However, in the areas where trees grow, there is a surprising diversity. There are at least 43 varieties and/or species of broadleaf trees on the island, and over a dozen types of conifer. Amongst the coniferous trees are silver and noble firs, juniper, European and Japanese larch, Sitka spruce, and Scots pine. The broadleafs include laburnum, wych elm, three types of oak, four kinds of cherry tree, alder, sycamore, sweet chestnut, walnut and various other fruit trees.

==In literature and the arts==


===Boswell and Johnson===
Dr Johnson and Boswell visited The MacQuarrie on Ulva in October 1773, the year after Sir Joseph Banks brought Staffa to the English-speaking world&#x27;s attention. Perhaps aware that Banks considered that the columnar basalt cliff formations on Ulva called &quot;The Castles&quot; rivalled Staffa&#x27;s Johnson wrote:

Both men left separate accounts of the visit, Johnson in &quot;A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland&quot; (18 January 1775) and Boswell in &quot;Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson, LL.D&quot; (1785). They arrived on Saturday, 16 October, and left the following day.

===Scott and Hogg===

Boswell and Johnson were not the only famous non-Highland visitors to the island. Walter Scott and James Hogg also visited the islands some decades later. Scott was struck by the contrast between Ulva and the nearby island of Inchkenneth:
By the time, Scott visited the &quot;mean&quot; house referred to in Boswell&#x27;s journal was gone, and replaced by one from a design by Robert Adam. This in turn has been destroyed, and the current Ulva House is on its site.

Hogg wrote some graffiti on the wall of Ulva Inn, now lost due to its burning down in 1880:

Many other visitors to neighbouring Staffa stayed at Ulva Inn, this included Keats, Mendelssohn, and William Wordsworth.

After his visit, Walter Scott used Ulva as material for various works, for example, in his 1815 poem, &quot;Lord of the Isles&quot; (Canto 4)
In &quot;Tales of a Grandfather&quot;, Scott tells the story of &quot;Alan-a-Sop&quot;. In his youth, Alan-a-Sop was treated badly by his stepfather, one Maclean of Torloisk. He grew up to be a pirate and eventually took a bloody revenge on Torloisk with the help of MacQuarrie of Ulva.

===Other===
A piper named MacArthur set up a famous piping school on Ulva, possibly in the 17th century. He himself was trained by the great MacCrimmon dynasty of Skye, whose piping skills were legendary in Gaeldom. The MacArthurs themselves were said to be amongst the greatest bagpipers to come out of Scotland.

The Scottish missionary and explorer of Africa, David Livingstone recounted how his ancestors had originally come from Ulva.

The most famous commemoration of Ulva in literature is Thomas Campbell&#x27;s poem, &quot;Lord Ullin&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, written after the writer had visited the region. The opening two stanzas are as follows:

&quot;Moladh Ulbha&quot; (In Praise of Ulva) is a song written by the Ulbhach Bard, Colin Fletcher (Cailean Mac an Fhleisdeir). It was transcribed by the Rev. MacKenzie. This is the first verse.
John MacCormick (; 1870–1947), the author of the first full length Scottish Gaelic novel, &quot;Dùn Aluinn&quot; (1912) was an occasional visitor to the island. He wrote a number of short stories, non-fiction and a novella. He came from Mull, and was a distant relative of the politician of the same name and Neil MacCormick

English children&#x27;s writer, Beatrix Potter (1866–1943) also visited Ulva from time to time. She was a relative of the Clark family, and &quot;The Tale of Mr. Tod&quot; (1912) is dedicated to F. W. Clark (III - grandson of the man who bought the island). The dedication says rather cryptically: &quot;FOR FRANCIS WILLIAM OF ULVA — SOMEDAY!&quot; Although the main characters of the book are a fox (&quot;tod&quot;) and a badger (&quot;brock&quot;), neither species can be found on Ulva.

==Structures==
Many structures on Ulva are in ruins, such as the former water mill between Ormaig and Cragaig, and if not in ruins, they have been incorporated into other buildings, e.g. Bracadale Steadings, which includes bits of the old Ulva House which Boswell and Johnson stayed in. On the southern coast are found the ruins of the hamlet of Ormaig (walls of old cottages) and of Kilvekewen church.

The Boathouse Cafe remains in business. A January 2020 news item indicated that it was &quot;rapidly gaining a reputation for its fresh seafood&quot;.

===Ulva Church===
In the early 19th century, an unflattering report stated:
&quot;No district was more deficient in the means of religious instruction than Ulva&quot; and that &quot;Divine service was little frequented in winter.&quot;

A small church was built at Ardalum between 1827 and 1828. It cost £1,500 and was designed by Thomas Telford. It was restored in 1921. the original church did not have a proper floor, and its floor boards were laid on top of the earth.

The Certificate of Complete of the Ulva Church and Manse is dated 14 March 1828, and it was conveyed by Charles MacQuarie. There was a budget of £1,500 for the construction and the actual cost came to £1,495 14/1.

Privately owned since the mid 1950s when it was purchased by the family who then owned the island, it is still used, partly as a community centre, and the north-west wing for worship at least twice a year, at Easter and at Harvest time. (The island was sold to the residents in 1998 however, and the building is now owned by that small group.) It is claimed that in 1847 (&quot;Statistical Account&quot;), everyone on the island attended services in it including one Roman Catholic and one atheist. Dr Johnson was probably speaking of the old church at Cille Mhic Eòghainn when he said: &quot;Ulva was not neglected by the piety of ardent times: it has still to show what was once a church.&quot; Ulva Church is dedicated to St Eòghann of Ardstraw, possibly the same person.

The last resident minister, Rev. MacKenzie left in 1929.

===Sheila&#x27;s Cottage===
&quot;Sheila&#x27;s Cottage&quot; is a thatched but and ben, which was restored in the 1990s. It is named for Sheila MacFadyen (Sile NicPhaidein), who lived in the cottage between the turn of the 20th century and the early 1950s. Sheila was originally a milkmaid at Ulva House, but she spent her later years, after her son predeceased her, garnering a scanty living by gathering and selling winkles for sale locally. One room, the &quot;but&quot; was for livestock, and the other, the &quot;ben&quot; was her living space, where all activities took place.

The cottage contains a box bed, dresser, and a life-size model of Sheila herself.

An additional restoration of the cottage was being completed in late 2019.

===Other buildings===
The Inn at Ulva was popular with visitors to Staffa. However, although it called itself a &quot;temperance inn&quot;, its keeper was charged three times with breach of licence. It burnt down in 1880 - the buildings were thatched, and the guest book, which contained many famous signatures was destroyed with it. It reopened, but was finally closed in 1905.

More than one building has gone by the name &quot;Ulva House&quot;, and the current one was designed by Leslie Grahame-Thomson in the early 1950s. There is a dovecot and a pig sty on its gable end. The Ulva Master plan called for converting the House into self catering flats, according to an October 2019 news report. 

There are several ruined kilns on the island for a number of different purposes. At Baligartan, there is the remains of a kiln for drying grain, and on the south shore, in a gully (GR173378), there is another, which was probably used in the island&#x27;s old kelp industry.

==Folklore and customs==
It may be presumed that much of the island&#x27;s folklore disappeared with the island&#x27;s population. The story of &quot;Allan-a-Sop&quot;, adapted by Scott would have formed part.

Bradley&#x27;s Cave (G 439398) is named for an Irish itinerant who used to visit in the 19th century. Bradley, or O&#x27; Brolligan (as his name is sometimes recorded) was a retired sailor, who took to the roads as a pedlar, and when on Ulva, he was said to live in this cave. Though there is little evidence of his existence, during the 20th century, buttons and a coin dated 1873 were found in here.

Cairistiona&#x27;s Rock near Ormaig has a more gruesome story attached to it. Cairistiona accused, probably falsely, her sister of stealing a large hunk of cheese, and tried to extract a confession from her, by lowering her off a cliff with a plaid tied round her neck. The plaid slipped, and ended up strangling her sister, which she had never intended to do. Wracked with remorse, she confessed to the accident, but this was not enough for the islanders, who decided to drown her, by throwing her in a sack and laying her on the rock, which still bears her name.

===&quot;Mercheta Mulierum&quot;===
&quot;Mercheta Mulierum&quot; was an ancient custom persisting in the island:
Boswell said &quot;I suppose, Ulva is the only place where this custom remains&quot;, and Sir William Blackstone says in his &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot; that &quot;he cannot find that ever this custom [Borough English] prevailed in England&quot;.

Walter Scott claimed that &quot;mercheta mulierum&quot; persisted at the time of his visit.

<text>This list of [[Michigan]] rivers includes all streams designated rivers although some may be smaller than those streams designated creeks, runs, brooks, swales, cuts, bayous, outlets, inlets, drains and ditches. These terms are all in use in Michigan. Other waterways are listed when they have articles.

The state has over 300 named rivers. Several names are shared by different rivers; for example, there are eight Pine Rivers and seven Black Rivers. In four cases there are two rivers of the same name in one county. In these cases extra information such as alternate name or body of water they flow into has been added.

<text>The Mesquite Championship Rodeo is a rodeo located in Mesquite, Texas, United States, that operates from June through August. It is only a 15 minute drive from Dallas, Texas. It is sanctioned by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). In 2020, it was awarded the PRCA Small Rodeo of the Year award. It was also awarded the Texas Small Rodeo of the Year Award.

==History==
Charlie Columbus McNally founded The original Mesquite Rodeo, which was a permanent location and did not move town to town. It was held at the Charlie McNally&#x27;s Arena which was located on Hickory Tree Road, a little to the north of present Rodeo Drive. The original Mesquite Rodeo dates from about 1946 but was preceded by the Pleasant Mound Rodeo which began in 1941, also started by Charlie McNally and is where Neal Gay got his start in 1945.

It was located on the northeast corner of Buckner Boulevard and Scyene Road. Ironically, it was closed when the City of Dallas annexed Pleasant Mound in 1950 and refused to issue a special zoning permit to the rodeo. Shortly after Neal Gay, Jim Shoulders, Ira Akers and their associates purchased C.C. McNally&#x27;s property in 1957. They built a new arena on the south side of the property on the north side of present Rodeo Drive for the 1958 opening of the professional, soon to be renamed, Mesquite Championship Rodeo. The entrance was still on Hickory Tree Road and passed north of the open arena (the roof was added in 1964) to a parking area on the west side. The brick kilns were just a few hundred feet southeast of the arena. The present arena was built in 1986 further south of the 1958 arena on the site of one of the clay pits. Rodeo Drive and Neal Gay Drive were constructed about the same time. The 1958 arena was torn down and the site remains undeveloped.

All that area had been in the Mesquite City limits since the mid 1950s expansion during the post war housing boom. The 1970 opening of 635 did not have any physical effect on the Mesquite Rodeo property but it did provide the visibility that led to increased attendance.

The Mesquite Championship Rodeo was televised on ESPN from 1981 to 1986, and from 1986 to 1999 on TNN. Finally, in the 2000s, it was televised on Fox Sports Networks. It reached over 8.3 million households, to date, the most televised rodeo in the world next to the NHSRA 20X Rodeo High telecast on RFD-TV. The Fox Sports Networks era would be the last in which the Mesquite Championship Rodeo was televised.

In 1985, ground was broken for the Mesquite Arena, a new facility for the Mesquite Rodeo, located near Interstate 635 and Scyene Road. By 1998, the facility was expanded to include a Convention Center, Exhibition Hall and a Hampton Inn &amp; Suites. In 1999, Tom Hicks, owner of the Texas Rangers and the Dallas Stars, purchased Mesquite Championship Rodeo.

By 2001, attendance had grown to 200,000 during the season. In 2009, a group of investors formed a company called Camelot Sports &amp; Entertainment and purchased the Mesquite Championship Rodeo from Hicks for an undisclosed sum. Camelot has reportedly invested nearly $1.5 million by adding high definition video boards over the bucking chutes, remodeling and refurbishing many of the suites in Mesquite Arena and adding a private restaurant called the 8 Second Club, which its members can use throughout the year. It was renamed Resistol Arena for several years after the Resistol hat company purchased the naming rights. 

In 2015, the Mesquite Championship Rodeo was sold to Stace Smith Pro Rodeo. 

The facility has hosted U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, as well as Prince Rainier III of Monaco.

<text>Gordon Aylesworth Blake (July 22, 1910 – September 1, 1997) was a lieutenant general in the United States Air Force who served as director of the National Security Agency from 1962 to 1965.

==Early life and training==
Gordon Aylesworth Blake was born in Charles City, Iowa, on July 22, 1910, the son of George and Cecelia Blake. He graduated from high school in Charles City and was appointed to the United States Military Academy by the late Gilbert N. Haugen in 1927, graduating on June 11, 1931. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps and detailed as a student officer to pilot training.

In October 1932, Blake completed Primary and Advanced Flying Schools. He was transferred to the Air Corps on January 25, 1933, and was assigned to a pursuit squadron at Barksdale Field, Louisiana. Entering the Signal School at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, in July 1934, he completed the Communications Officers&#x27; Course the following June and was assigned as communications instructor at the Air Corps Technical School, at Chanute Field, Illinois.

==World War II==
Going to Hawaii in February 1939, Blake was communications officer of the 18th Composite Wing. During September 1941, he acted as communications officer on the first land-based aircraft flight from Hawaii to the Philippines. This flight was made in B-17 bombers sent to the Philippines as reinforcements and flew a pioneer route – Midway Island; Wake Island; Port Moresby, New Guinea; Darwin, Australia; Clark Field, Philippine Islands. All members of the flight were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.

On December 7, 1941, Blake was base operations officer (in the rank of major) at Hickam Field during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and was awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in action that day. He became operations officer, Seventh Air Force Base Command, was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and spent the first months of World War II supervising operation of the airplane ferry route to Australia via Christmas Island – Canton Island – Fiji – New Caledonia.

In October 1942, Blake shifted back to communications work and commanded Army Airways Communications System in the Pacific for the rest of World War II, with the exception of the period October 1943 to January 1944, when on temporary duty in Alaska, he established the Air Communications Office for Alaska. He was promoted to colonel in November 1942. On August 28, 1945, he accompanied a special 150-man task force into Japan to prepare for airborne occupation troop landings on August 30.

==Post-war==
For his work in World War II, Blake was awarded the Legion of Merit by Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, plus an oak leaf cluster to the Legion of Merit by the War Department, the Air Medal with oak leaf cluster, and battle stars for participation in the following campaigns: Central Pacific, Eastern Mandates, New Guinea, North Solomons, Guadalcanal, Papua and South Philippines, Luzon and Western Pacific. He returned from overseas in November 1945, and in January 1946, was appointed deputy commander of the Airways and Air Communications Service at Langley Field, Virginia.

Entering the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, in August 1947, Blake graduated the following June and went to research and development work at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Between 1948 and 1951, he was with the Electronics Subdivision of the Engineering Division and served as chief of the Armament Laboratory. In the summer of 1951, he was placed in charge of 12 development laboratories and promoted to brigadier general. His final assignment at Wright Field was as vice-commander from June 1952 to January 1953.

Transferred to Air Force Headquarters in January 1953, Blake was appointed deputy director of communications in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, becoming director of communications the following month. Many changes to the United States Air Force system for global communications and navigation, including pioneer operational circuits using tropospheric scatter communications for the first time, were carried out during his tour as director of communications.

===Washington and other moves===
Blake was named assistant deputy chief of staff for operations on June 2, 1956. In this capacity he served on the Permanent Joint Board for Defense, Canada — US, under which many defense projects such as the Dewline radar network were planned between the two countries. During the latter part of his Washington assignment, he was given the aeronautical rating of command pilot and was promoted to major general, the highest permanent rank in the regular service.

Blake left Washington on January 4, 1957, to become commander of the United States Air Force Security Service, a major component of the United States Air Force with its headquarters in San Antonio, Texas. He was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service in this command.

On September 1, 1959, Blake was assigned as vice-commander-in-chief and chief of staff, Pacific Air Forces, the air arm of the joint Pacific Command with its headquarters in Hawaii.

Blake came to Headquarters Continental Air Command in July 1961 as commander-designate. He assumed command of Continental Air Command on September 30, 1961, and became a lieutenant general on October 1, 1961. Blake assumed the position of director, National Security Agency, at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, July 1, 1962, which he held until his retirement in 1965.

The US Air Force Aircraft Save Award is named after him. It is awarded for any action taken by an air traffic controller or airfield manager that results in the safe recovery of an imperiled airborne aircraft or help given to an endangered aircraft on the ground.

<doc id="478666" wikidata="Q574956" url="?curid=478666" title="Antibubble">
<text>An antibubble is a droplet of liquid surrounded by a thin film of gas, as opposed to a gas bubble, which is a sphere of gas surrounded by a liquid. Antibubbles are formed when liquid drops or flows turbulently into the same or another liquid. They can either skim across the surface of a liquid such as water, in which case they are also called water globules, or they can be completely submerged into the liquid to which they are directed.

==Background==

Antibubbles are a common but widely unrecognized phenomenon, in part because of their resemblance to air bubbles, and in part because of their typically , or short-lived, nature. With certain (soapy) solutions, they can be made to last much longer.

Antibubbles can be created by allowing a tap to drip into a container of water to which a drop or two of soap has been added. They have all been produced aided by an ultrasound contrast agent. Being inherently unstable, they are difficult to form.
The soap reduces the water&#x27;s surface tension and allows the skin of air surrounding the droplet to remain in place for more than just a fraction of a second. As antibubbles can be easily created at home, they have attracted attention from popular science magazines.

Just as soap bubbles, with air inside and air outside, have negative buoyancy and tend to sink towards the ground, so antibubbles, with water inside and air outside have positive buoyancy and tend to rise towards the water surface. But again, just as soap bubbles can be filled with a lighter gas to give them positive buoyancy, so antibubbles can be filled with a heavier liquid to give them negative buoyancy. Using a drinking straw to drop droplets of sugar solution onto soapy water will produce antibubbles that sink.

Antibubbles usually pop when they touch the bottom or the side of the vessel containing the liquid. This can be prevented by tipping a few teaspoons of sugar into the soapy water and giving it some time to dissolve (but without stirring it). This will produce a denser layer of sugary water at the bottom of the container. Antibubbles made from sugar solution will then sink through the water and rest on top of the denser layer at the bottom. Antibubbles made this way can last for several minutes.

The layers of an antibubble are water, which it is submerged in, air, and the water trapped in the air.

==Differences between air bubbles and antibubbles==

The behavior of antibubbles differs from that of air bubbles in three primary ways, and provides a ready means of identification:

* Antibubbles are held in place by surface tension, and move rapidly across the surface of the water. They can also be seen to ricochet off other objects in the water (such as air bubbles) and off the sides of a container in a manner similar to that of billiard balls.
* Under ordinary circumstances, antibubbles are short-lived. An air bubble with a soap skin may last several minutes. Antibubbles often have lifetimes of a few seconds or less; however, if the electrical potential between the inner and outer fluid is equalized, antibubbles can last as long as, or longer than, air bubbles. Antibubbles with a lifetime of at least tens of hours can be produced by adsorbing colloidal particles at the air-water interfaces of the antibubble.
* Antibubbles refract light in a different manner than air bubbles. Because they are water droplets, light entering them is refracted back toward its source in the same manner as rainbows are produced. Because of this refraction, antibubbles have a bright appearance.

==Potential uses for antibubbles==
If antibubbles can be stabilized they can be used to form a long lasting froth — antifoam. Possible uses for antifoam are as a lubricant or using the thin passageways permeating antifoam as a filter for air or other gasses.

Antibubbles themselves could be used for chemical processes such as removing pollutants from a smokestack. Replacing the air in antibubble shells with another liquid could be used for a drug delivery system by creating a shell of liquid-polymer around a drug. Hardening the polymer with ultraviolet light would create a drug filled capsule.

Microscopic antibubbles have demonstrated their feasibility in harmonic imaging. 
It has been proposed to incorporate therapeutics into antibubble cores. Such drug-loaded antibubbles might be used in ultrasound-guided drug delivery, where acoustic waves create sufficient pulsations of the antibubble surface to release its drug-containing core.

== Lifetime ==
The lifetime of an antibubble on top of a water surface might be prolonged by making the water underneath it vibrate. Such antibubbles have been referred to as &quot;walking bubbles&quot; and have been proposed to be used as a model of quantum mechanical behavior.
Another way to increase the lifetime of antibubbles is by applying so-called Pickering stabilization.

<text>In differential topology, sphere eversion is a theoretical process of turning a sphere inside out in a three-dimensional space (the word &quot;&quot; means &quot;turning inside out&quot;). It is possible to smoothly and continuously turn a sphere inside out in this way (allowing self-intersections of the sphere&#x27;s surface) without cutting or tearing it or creating any crease. This is surprising, both to non-mathematicians and to those who understand regular homotopy, and can be regarded as a veridical paradox; that is something that, while being true, on first glance seems false.

More precisely, let

:formula_1

be the standard embedding; then there is a regular homotopy of immersions

:formula_2

such that &quot;ƒ&quot;0 = &quot;ƒ&quot; and &quot;ƒ&quot;1 = −&quot;ƒ&quot;.

==History==
An existence proof for crease-free sphere eversion was first created by .
It is difficult to visualize a particular example of such a turning, although some digital animations have been produced that make it somewhat easier. The first example was exhibited through the efforts of several mathematicians, including Arnold S. Shapiro and Bernard Morin, who was blind. On the other hand, it is much easier to prove that such a &quot;turning&quot; exists, and that is what Smale did.

Smale&#x27;s graduate adviser Raoul Bott at first told Smale that the result was obviously wrong . 
His reasoning was that the degree of the Gauss map must be preserved in such &quot;turning&quot;—in particular it follows that there is no such &quot;turning&quot; of S1 in R2. But the degrees of the Gauss map for the embeddings &quot;f&quot; and −&quot;f&quot; in R3 are both equal to 1, and do not have opposite sign as one might incorrectly guess. The degree of the Gauss map of all immersions of S2 in R3 is 1, so there is no obstacle. The term &quot;veridical paradox&quot; applies perhaps more appropriately at this level: until Smale&#x27;s work, there was no documented attempt to argue for or against the eversion of S2, and later efforts are in hindsight, so there never was a historical paradox associated with sphere eversion, only an appreciation of the subtleties in visualizing it by those confronting the idea for the first time.

See &quot;h&quot;-principle for further generalizations.

==Proof==
Smale&#x27;s original proof was indirect: he identified (regular homotopy) classes of immersions of spheres with a homotopy group of the Stiefel manifold. Since the homotopy group that corresponds to immersions of formula_3 in formula_4 vanishes, the standard embedding and the inside-out one must be regular homotopic. In principle the proof can be unwound to produce an explicit regular homotopy, but this is not easy to do.

There are several ways of producing explicit examples and mathematical visualization:

* Half-way models: these consist of very special homotopies. This is the original method, first done by Shapiro and Phillips via Boy&#x27;s surface, later refined by many others. The original half-way model homotopies were constructed by hand, and worked topologically but weren&#x27;t minimal. The movie created by Nelson Max, over a seven-year period, and based on Charles Pugh&#x27;s chicken-wire models (subsequently stolen from the Mathematics Department at Berkeley), was a computer-graphics &#x27;tour de force&#x27; for its time, and set the bench-mark for computer animation for many years. A more recent and definitive graphics refinement (1980s) is minimax eversions, which is a variational method, and consist of special homotopies (they are shortest paths with respect to Willmore energy). In turn, understanding behavior of Willmore energy requires understanding solutions of fourth-order partial differential equations, and so the visually beautiful and evocative images belie some very deep mathematics beyond Smale&#x27;s original abstract proof.

* Thurston&#x27;s corrugations: this is a topological method and generic; it takes a homotopy and perturbs it so that it becomes a regular homotopy. This is illustrated in the computer-graphics animation &quot;Outside In&quot; developed at the Geometry Center under the direction of Silvio Levy, Delle Maxwell and Tamara Munzner.
* Combining the above methods, the complete sphere eversion can be described by a set of closed equations giving minimal topological complexity 

==Variations==
* A six-dimensional sphere formula_5 in seven-dimensional euclidean space formula_6 admits eversion. With an evident case of an 0-dimensional sphere formula_7 (two distinct points) in a real line formula_8 and described above case of a two-dimensional sphere in formula_9 there are only three cases when sphere formula_10 embedded in euclidean space formula_11 admits eversion.

<doc id="478673" wikidata="Q723849" url="?curid=478673" title="Greatest hits album">
<text>A greatest hits album or best-of album is a type of compilation album that collects popular and commercially successful songs by a particular artist or band. While greatest hits albums are typically supported by the artist, they can also be created by record companies without express approval from the original artist as a means to generate sales. They are typically regarded as a good starting point for new fans of an artist, but are sometimes criticized by longtime fans as not inclusive enough or necessary at all.

It is also common for greatest hits albums to include new recordings, remixes or unreleased alternate takes of the hit songs, plus other new material as bonus tracks to increase appeal for longtime fans (who might otherwise already own the recordings included). At times, a greatest hits compilation marks the first album appearance of a successful single that was never attached to a previous studio album. Greatest hits albums usually are released after an artist or band&#x27;s contract with a major label is completed, they&#x27;ve been dropped or died, with next releases following on new labels.

== History ==
The first greatest hits album was Johnny Mathis&#x27;s &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, released in 1958. The album collected eight of Mathis&#x27;s charting singles, as well as three non-charting B-sides and an altogether new track. The album spent three weeks at the number one spot on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Best Selling Pop LP&#x27;s chart. The greatest hits album format then gained popularity in the 1960s and 1970s among American and British rock and pop artists. One notable example was the Beach Boys 1974 album &quot;Endless Summer&quot;, which upon release was certified 3× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. It propelled them from an opening act for Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young to headlining their own tour in just a matter of weeks. Some artists were even popular enough to release multiple greatest hits albums during and after their career.

Greatest hits compilations were sometimes also released as 4-track 7&quot; vinyl EPs. In the late 1960s, EMI Sweden released a series of greatest hits-EPs featuring artists such as The Supremes, Ray Charles and Louis Armstrong.

By the 1990s, greatest hits albums were common for popular artists, with some artists even releasing the greatest hits album as a music video collection concurrently with the album. It also became a commercially viable option to boost popularity for artists with dwindling careers. Some bands refuse to release a greatest hits album, such as rock groups AC/DC, Tool, and Metallica. Garth Brooks had initially refused releasing one, but he eventually agreed to it in 1994 for a limited release (the resulting record, &quot;The Hits&quot;, sold over ten million copies).

In 2000, Sony Music Entertainment launched their &quot;The Essential&quot; series, which collects singles and other career-defining tracks of artists licensed to Sony. &quot;The Essential Bob Dylan&quot; was the first in the series, and the company has since released dozens of albums in the series with other artists under their label. In addition to artist-specific collections, the series has also released genre-specific and themed albums, such as &quot;The Essential Christmas&quot; (collecting pop and rock covers of Christmas songs) or &quot;The Essential Australian Rock&quot; (collecting a specific regional output). In 2005, Universal Music Group launched a similar line, &quot;Gold&quot;, which collects artists&#x27; greatest hits onto two discs.

In the late 2000s and 2010s, digital downloads and music streaming services increased in popularity, which allow users to listen to their favorite tracks without the need of a greatest hits package. In 2016, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; said that &quot;in the digital era, once a catalog enters a streaming service or an MP3 store, there&#x27;s no need for a reissue and, therefore, there&#x27;s no reason for a label to mine the vaults, searching for old music to make new again. Users can assemble their own personalized greatest hits playlists or just scan through an act&#x27;s most accessed songs&quot;, which has led to greatest hits collections becoming redundant.

Despite the popularity of streaming in the 2010s and early 2020s, some artists continued to issue physical greatest hits albums, including the White Stripes, Spoon, and the Weeknd. Spoon lead singer Britt Daniel said he chose to compile 2019&#x27;s &quot;Everything Hits at Once: The Best of Spoon&quot; out of an affinity for compilations such as &quot;Standing on a Beach&quot; by the Cure and &quot;Substance 1987&quot; by New Order, which had introduced him to those artists in his youth, and to provide an official introduction to Spoon&#x27;s catalog for new listeners. Alex Kapranos of Franz Ferdinand echoed those sentiments when describing the decision to release the band&#x27;s 2022 &quot;Hits to the Head&quot; compilation, stating that &quot;I have friends who believe you&#x27;re somehow not a &#x27;real&#x27; fan if you own a best of rather than a discography. I disagree. I think of my parents&#x27; record collection as a kid. I loved their compilation LPs. I am so grateful that they had &quot;Changes&quot; or &quot;Rolled Gold&quot;. Those LPs were my entrance point. My introduction.&quot;

==Notable examples==

Various compilation albums became amongst the best-selling albums worldwide with sales of over 20 million copies. For example, Eagles&#x27; &quot;Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)&quot; is the best-selling album in the United States, according to &quot;Billboard,&quot; selling over 38 million copies. Worldwide, &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; by Madonna is the best-selling compilation by a solo artist, with 30 million copies, and is the best-selling compilation by a female artist in major music markets such as Australia, United Kingdom and United States. In the UK, Queen&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; is the biggest selling album of all time. In second place is &quot;ABBA Gold&quot;, another greatest hits compilation which has gone on to become the longest-charting album in the UK. Queen&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits II&quot; is also one of the UK&#x27;s top ten biggest sellers.

One example of a greatest hits compilation released against the artists&#x27; intentions is British rock group the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1971 compilation &quot;Hot Rocks 1964–1971&quot;. The music magazine &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked that the album served as a &quot;beautifully packaged... purely mercenary item put together by former record executives of the Stones&#x27; to cash in on the Christmas season and wring some more bucks out in the name of the Mod Princes they once owned.&quot; After their management tricked the band into signing over the copyrights to their 1963–1970 song catalog, the band did succeed in changing management and major labels. However, they could neither prevent the release of &quot;Hot Rocks&quot; nor its successor, &quot;More Hot Rocks (Big Hits &amp; Fazed Cookies)&quot;. &quot;Hot Rocks&quot; remains the best-selling album of the Rolling Stones&#x27; career. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards continue to collect significant songwriting royalties from the &quot;Hot Rocks&quot; sales, but not the ownership royalties.

== In other media ==
The concept of greatest hits compilations has been adapted to other media as well. In television, some shows have released compilations of their critically successful and highest-rated episodes to drive new viewers to watch a program, such as &quot;Family Guy&quot;″s &quot;Freakin&#x27; Sweet Collection&quot; and &quot;South Park: The Hits&quot;. Several video game companies have re-released popular games for continued sales, sometimes with discounted prices: Sony&#x27;s PlayStation has released games under their Greatest Hits series; Nintendo has re-released games under the Nintendo Selects label (formerly called &quot;Player&#x27;s Choice&quot;); and Microsoft has re-released games under the Platinum Hits label. Some video game franchises have released greatest hits collections of their own content, such as &quot;Super Mario All-Stars&quot;, &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot;, and &quot;Guitar Hero Smash Hits.&quot; Film studios also have participated in the practice, often including a number of films in one package (usually by decade) under an equivalent label to &#x27;greatest hits&#x27; through optical physical media and often timed to a landmark anniversary, and digital purchase bundles in the same vein continue to exist.

<text>Eadburh of Bicester (also Eadburth, or Edburg, death c. 650) was an English nun, abbess, and saint from the 7th century. She has been called a &quot;bit of a mystery&quot;; there have been several Saxon saints with the same name, so it is difficult to pinpoint which one was Eadburh. It is most likely that Eadburh of Bicester was the daughter of King Penda of Mercia, who was pagan but had several children who were Christians. Eadburgh was born in the now-deserted village of Quarrendon in Buckinghamshire. Her sister was Edith (or Eadith), with whom she co-founded an abbey near Aylesburg;
Eadburh probably became abbess at Aylesburg. She was also aunt of Osgyth, whom she trained &quot;in the religious life&quot;. There are legends that claim that Edburgh and Edith found Osyth after she had drowned three days earlier and &quot;witnessed her return to life&quot;.

Eadburgh might have lived at Adderbury, which may have been named for her, 30 miles from Aylesbury. She died in c. 650; her burial place is unknown. In 850, a simple Saxon church was built in Bicester. In 1182, her relics were moved to Bicester, when an Augustinian priory was founded by a group of Canons regular and dedicated to Saint Eadburgh and to the Virgin Mary. Many pilgrims visited Eadburh&#x27;s shrine and holy well there. During the Reformation in 1536, Sir Simon Harcourt, the sheriff of Oxford, destroyed the Bicester Priory church, but he saved Eadburth&#x27;s shrine and moved it to Saint Michael&#x27;s Church in Stanton Harcourt so that it could be used as an Easter sepulture. Other parts of the shrine were combined into a tomb in the Harcourt chapel. In the late 1940s, there was an attempt to return the shrine to Bicester, but it was unsuccessful. Saint Eadburh&#x27;s feast day is 18 July.

<text>Ziaelas (; lived c. 265 BC – 228 BC, reigned c. 254 BC – 228 BC), third king of Bithynia, was a son of Nicomedes I and Ditizele.

==Life==
Following the death of Nicomedes I, his second wife Etazeta of Bithynia acted as regent on behalf of her infant sons. Nicomedes&#x27; adult son from his first marriage Ziaelas, was denied the chance to ascend the throne, leading him to flee to Armenia and take refuge at the court of King Arsames I in Sophene. Upon his father&#x27;s death he immediately endeavored to regain his rights by force, and returned, aided by some Galatians. Although Etazeta was supported by neighboring cities and Antigonus II Gonatas, Ziaelas rapidly conquered Bithynia, forcing Etazeta and her sons to escape to the court of Antigonus in about 254 BC.

During the Fraternal War between Seleucus II Callinicus and Antiochus Hierax, he seized the opportunity to attack the latter, trying to conquer Asia Minor They later became allies and his daughter, born c. 245 BC, married Hierax.

He was succeeded by his son Prusias I about 228 BC after being killed by the Galatians. Like his father and his grandfather he also founded a new city named after him, Ziaela, but the location of the city is unknown..
