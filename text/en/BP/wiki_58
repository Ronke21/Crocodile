<text>Sublimation is the transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas state, without passing through the liquid state. The verb form of sublimation is &quot;sublime&quot;, or less preferably, &quot;sublimate&quot;. &quot;Sublimate&quot; also refers to the product obtained by sublimation. The point at which sublimation occurs rapidly (for further details, see below) is called critical sublimation point, or simply sublimation point. Notable examples include sublimation of dry ice at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and that of solid iodine with heating.

The reverse process of sublimation is &quot;deposition&quot; (also called &quot;desublimation&quot;), in which a substance passes directly from a gas to a solid phase, without passing through the liquid state.

Technically, all solids may sublime, though most sublime at extremely low rates that are hardly detectable under usual conditions. At normal pressures, most chemical compounds and elements possess three different states at different temperatures. In these cases, the transition from the solid to the gas state requires an intermediate liquid state. The pressure referred to is the &quot;partial&quot; pressure of the substance, not the &quot;total&quot; (e.g. atmospheric) pressure of the entire system. Thus, any solid can sublime if its vapour pressure is higher than the surrounding partial pressure of the same substance, and in some cases, sublimation occurs at an appreciable rate (e.g. water ice just below 0 °C).

For some substances, such as carbon and arsenic, sublimation from solid state is much more achievable than evaporation from liquid state and it is difficult to obtain them as liquids. This is because the pressure of their triple point in its phase diagram (which corresponds to the lowest pressure at which the substance can exist as a liquid) is very high.

Sublimation is caused by the absorption of heat which provides enough energy for some molecules to overcome the attractive forces of their neighbors and escape into the vapor phase. Since the process requires additional energy, sublimation is an endothermic change. The enthalpy of sublimation (also called heat of sublimation) can be calculated by adding the enthalpy of fusion and the enthalpy of vaporization.

== Confusions ==
While the definition of sublimation is simple, there is often confusion as to what counts as a sublimation.

=== False correspondence with vaporization ===
Vaporization (from liquid to gas) is divided into two types: vaporization on the surface of the liquid is called evaporation, and vaporization at the boiling point with formation of bubbles in the interior of the liquid is called boiling. However there is &quot;no&quot; such distinction for the solid-to-gas transition, which is always called sublimation in both corresponding cases.

==== Potential distinction ====
For clarification, a distinction between the two corresponding cases is needed. With reference to a phase diagram, the sublimation that occurs left of the solid-gas boundary, the triple point or the solid-liquid boundary (corresponding to evaporation in vaporization) may be called &quot;gradual sublimation&quot;; and the substance &quot;sublimes gradually&quot;, regardless of rate. The sublimation that occurs at the solid-gas boundary (critical sublimation point) (corresponding to boiling in vaporization) may be called &quot;rapid sublimation&quot;, and the substance &quot;sublimes rapidly&quot;. The words &quot;gradual&quot; and &quot;rapid&quot; have acquired special meanings in this context and no longer describe the rate of sublimation.

=== Misuse for chemical reaction ===
The term &quot;sublimation&quot; refers specifically to a physical change of state and is not used to describe the transformation of a solid to a gas in a chemical reaction. For example, the dissociation on heating of solid ammonium chloride into hydrogen chloride and ammonia is &quot;not&quot; sublimation but a chemical reaction. Similarly the combustion of candles, containing paraffin wax, to carbon dioxide and water vapor is &quot;not&quot; sublimation but a chemical reaction with oxygen.

=== Historical definition ===
Sublimation is historically used as a generic term to describe a two-step phase transition ― a solid-to-gas transition (sublimation in a more precise definition) followed by a gas-to-solid transition (deposition). (See below)

==Examples==

The examples shown are substances that noticeably sublime under certain conditions.

===Carbon dioxide===

Solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) sublimes rapidly along the solid-gas boundary (sublimation point) below the triple point (e.g., at the temperature of −78.5 °C, at atmospheric pressure), whereas its melting into liquid CO2 can occur along the solid-liquid boundary (melting point) at pressures and temperatures above the triple point (i.e., 5.1 atm, −56.6 °C).

===Water===
Snow and ice sublime gradually at temperatures below the solid-liquid boundary (melting point) (generally 0 °C), and at partial pressures below the triple point pressure of , at a low rate. In freeze-drying, the material to be dehydrated is frozen and its water is allowed to sublime under reduced pressure or vacuum. The loss of snow from a snowfield during a cold spell is often caused by sunshine acting directly on the upper layers of the snow. Sublimation of ice is a factor to the erosive wear of glacier ice, known as ablation in glaciology.

===Naphthalene===

Naphthalene, an organic compound commonly found in pesticides such as mothballs, sublimes easily because it is made of non-polar molecules that are held together only by van der Waals intermolecular forces. Naphthalene is a solid that sublimes gradually at standard temperature and pressure, at a high rate, with the critical sublimation point at around . At low temperature, its vapour pressure is high enough, 1mmHg at 53°C, to make the solid form of naphthalene evaporate into gas. On cool surfaces, the naphthalene vapours will solidify to form needle-like crystals.

===Iodine===
Iodine sublimes gradually and produces visible fumes on gentle heating at standard atmospheric temperature. It is possible to obtain liquid iodine at atmospheric pressure by controlling the temperature at just between the melting point and the boiling point of iodine. In forensic science, iodine vapor can reveal latent fingerprints on paper.

=== Other substances ===
At atmospheric pressure, arsenic sublimes gradually upon heating, and sublimes rapidly at .

Cadmium and zinc sublime much more than other common materials, so they are not suitable materials for use in vacuum.

==Purification by sublimation==
Sublimation is a technique used by chemists to purify compounds. A solid is typically placed in a sublimation apparatus and heated under vacuum. Under this reduced pressure, the solid volatilizes and condenses as a purified compound on a cooled surface (cold finger), leaving a non-volatile residue of impurities behind. Once heating ceases and the vacuum is removed, the purified compound may be collected from the cooling surface.
For even higher purification efficiencies, a temperature gradient is applied, which also allows for the separation of different fractions. Typical setups use an evacuated glass tube that is heated gradually in a controlled manner. The material flow is from the hot end, where the initial material is placed, to the cold end that is connected to a pump stand. By controlling temperatures along the length of the tube, the operator can control the zones of re-condensation, with very volatile compounds being pumped out of the system completely (or caught by a separate cold trap), moderately volatile compounds re-condensing along the tube according to their different volatilities, and non-volatile compounds remaining in the hot end.
Vacuum sublimation of this type is also the method of choice for purification of organic compounds for use in the organic electronics industry, where very high purities (often &gt; 99.99%) are needed to satisfy the standards for consumer electronics and other applications.

==Historical usage==
In ancient alchemy, a protoscience that contributed to the development of modern chemistry and medicine, alchemists developed a structure of basic laboratory techniques, theory, terminology, and experimental methods. &quot;Sublimation&quot; was used to refer to the process in which a substance is heated to a vapor, then immediately collects as sediment on the upper portion and neck of the heating medium (typically a retort or alembic), but can also be used to describe other similar non-laboratory transitions. It was mentioned by alchemical authors such as Basil Valentine and George Ripley, and in the &quot;Rosarium philosophorum&quot;, as a process necessary for the completion of the magnum opus. Here, the word &quot;sublimation&quot; was used to describe an exchange of &quot;bodies&quot; and &quot;spirits&quot; similar to laboratory phase transition between solids and gases. Valentine, in his &quot;Le char triomphal de l&#x27;antimoine&quot; (Triumphal Chariot of Antimony, published 1646) made a comparison to spagyrics in which a vegetable sublimation can be used to separate the spirits in wine and beer. Ripley used language more indicative of the mystical implications of sublimation, indicating that the process has a double aspect in the spiritualization of the body and the corporalizing of the spirit. He writes:

&lt;poem&gt;
And Sublimations we make for three causes,
The first cause is to make the body spiritual.
The second is that the spirit may be corporeal,
And become fixed with it and consubstantial.
The third cause is that from its filthy original.
It may be cleansed, and its saltiness sulphurious
May be diminished in it, which is infectious.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Sublimation predictions==

The enthalpy of sublimation has commonly been predicted using the equipartition theorem. If the lattice energy is assumed to be approximately half the packing energy, then the following thermodynamic corrections can be applied to predict the enthalpy of sublimation. Assuming a 1 molar ideal gas gives a correction for the thermodynamic environment (pressure and volume) in which pV = RT, hence a correction of 1RT. Additional corrections for the vibrations, rotations and translation then need to be applied. From the equipartition theorem gaseous rotation and translation contribute 1.5RT each to the final state, therefore a +3RT correction. Crystalline vibrations and rotations contribute 3RT each to the initial state, hence −6RT. Summing the RT corrections; −6RT + 3RT + RT = −2RT. This leads to the following approximate sublimation enthalpy. A similar approximation can be found for the entropy term if rigid bodies are assumed.

==Dye-sublimation printing==
Dye-sub printing is a digital printing technology using full color artwork that works with polyester and polymer-coated substrates. Also referred to as digital sublimation, the process is commonly used for decorating apparel, signs and banners, as well as novelty items such as cell phone covers, plaques, coffee mugs, and other items with sublimation-friendly surfaces. The process uses the science of sublimation, in which heat and pressure are applied to a solid, turning it into a gas through an endothermic reaction without passing through the liquid phase.

In sublimation printing, unique sublimation dyes are transferred to sheets of “transfer” paper via liquid gel ink through a piezoelectric print head. The ink is deposited on these high-release inkjet papers, which are used for the next step of the sublimation printing process. After the digital design is printed onto sublimation transfer sheets, it is placed on a heat press along with the substrate to be sublimated.

In order to transfer the image from the paper to the substrate, it requires a heat press process that is a combination of time, temperature and pressure. The heat press applies this special combination, which can change depending on the substrate, to “transfer” the sublimation dyes at the molecular level into the substrate. The most common dyes used for sublimation activate at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. However, a range of 380 to 420 degrees Fahrenheit is normally recommended for optimal color.

The result of the sublimation process is a nearly permanent, high resolution, full color print. Because the dyes are infused into the substrate at the molecular level, rather than applied at a topical level (such as with screen printing and direct to garment printing), the prints will not crack, fade or peel from the substrate under normal conditions.

<doc id="477665" wikidata="Q1353736" url="?curid=477665" title="Jeffrey Skilling">
<text>Jeffrey Keith Skilling (born November 25, 1953) is an American businessman who in 2006 was convicted of federal felony charges relating to the Enron scandal. Skilling, who was CEO of Enron during the company&#x27;s collapse, was eventually sentenced to 24 years in prison, of which he served 12 after multiple appeals. 

Skilling was indicted on 35 counts of crimes related to the Enron scandal. In 2006 he was found guilty of conspiracy, insider trading, making false statements, and securities fraud. He was sentenced to 24 years in prison and fined $45 million.

The US Supreme Court heard arguments in the appeal of the case in 2010, vacated part of Skilling&#x27;s conviction, and transferred the case back to the lower court for resentencing.

In 2011, a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the verdict would have been the same despite the legal issues being discussed, and Skilling&#x27;s conviction was confirmed; however, the court ruled Skilling should be resentenced. Skilling appealed this new decision to the Supreme Court, but the appeal was denied. 

In 2013, following a further appeal, and earlier accusations that prosecutors had concealed evidence from Skilling&#x27;s lawyers prior to his trial, the United States Department of Justice reached a deal with Skilling, which resulted in ten years being cut from his sentence, reducing it to 14 years. He was moved to a halfway house in 2018 and released from custody in 2019, after serving 12 years.

==Early life==
Jeffrey Keith Skilling was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on November 25, 1953, the second of four children of Betty (&quot;née&quot; Clarke) and Thomas Ethelbert Skilling, Jr. His father was a sales manager for an Illinois valve company. His older brother, Tom Skilling, later became chief meteorologist at WGN-TV in Chicago. Skilling grew up between New Jersey and Aurora, Illinois. When he was 16 years old, he worked at WLXT-TV (channel 60), a UHF television station in Aurora. He graduated from West Aurora High School and received a full scholarship to Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, where he was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity.

Skilling initially studied engineering before changing to business. After graduating in 1975, he went to work as a corporate planner for First City Bancorporation of Houston, Texas. He quit by 1977 to attend Harvard Business School. According to Skilling, during his admissions interview for Harvard Business School, he was asked if he was smart, to which he replied, &quot;I&#x27;m &quot;fucking&quot; smart.&quot; This apparently so impressed the interviewer that it secured his place at the school. He earned his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1979, graduating in the top 5% of his class as a Baker Scholar.

After graduation, Skilling became a consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company in the energy and chemical consulting practices. He eventually became one of the youngest partners in the history of McKinsey.

==Enron==
As a consultant for McKinsey, Skilling worked with Enron during 1987, helping the company create a forward market in natural gas. Skilling impressed Kenneth Lay in his capacity as a consultant, and was hired by Lay during 1990 as chairman and chief executive officer of Enron Finance Corp. In 1991, he became the chairman of Enron Gas Services Co., which was a result of the merger of Enron Gas Marketing and Enron Finance Corp. Skilling was named CEO and managing director of Enron Capital and Trade Resources, which was the subsidiary responsible for energy trading and marketing. He was promoted to president and chief operating officer of Enron during 1997, second only to Lay, while remaining the manager of Enron Capital and Trade Resources.

During Skilling&#x27;s management, Enron adopted &quot;mark-to-market&quot; accounting, in which anticipated future profits from any deal were accounted for by estimating their present value rather than historical cost. Skilling began advocating a novel idea: by promoting the company&#x27;s aggressive investment strategy, the company didn&#x27;t really need any &quot;assets&quot;. This plan helped make Enron the largest wholesaler of gas and electricity, with $27 billion traded in a quarter. On February 12, 2001, Skilling was named CEO of Enron, replacing Lay. He was slated to succeed Lay as chairman as well in early 2002, but abruptly resigned six months later on 14 August 2001.

Skilling joked about the California energy crisis at one meeting of Enron employees by asking, &quot;What is the difference between California and the &quot;Titanic&quot;? At least when the &quot;Titanic&quot; went down, the lights were on&quot;. Skilling later attributed the remark to frayed relations between Enron and California. His employees, meanwhile, plotted to keep the price of energy high in California.

On March 28, 2001, PBS&#x27;s &quot;Frontline&quot; interviewed Skilling, where he claimed for Enron &quot;We are the good guys. We are on the side of angels&quot;.

On April 17, 2001, Skilling made what became an infamous comment during a conference call with financial analysts. In response to fund manager Richard Grubman saying &quot;You know, you are the only financial institution that can&#x27;t produce a balance sheet or cash flow statement with their earnings&quot;, Skilling replied: &quot;Thank you very much, we appreciate that... asshole.&quot;

In June 2001, Skilling spoke at the Commonwealth Club of California, where he was heckled by Global Exchange protesters wearing pig masks and was partially struck by a pie on stage. A documentary, &quot;The Pie&#x27;s the Limit&quot;, was later made about the incident.

Skilling unexpectedly resigned on August 14 of that year, citing personal reasons, and he soon sold large amounts of his shares in the corporation. Then-chairman Kenneth Lay, who previously served as CEO for 15 years, returned as CEO until the company filed for bankruptcy protection during December 2001. When brought in front of congressional committees, Skilling stated that he had &quot;no knowledge&quot; of the complicated scandal that would eventually result in Enron&#x27;s bankruptcy.

==Legal proceedings==

Skilling was indicted on 35 counts of fraud, insider trading, and other crimes related to the Enron scandal. He surrendered to the Federal Bureau of Investigation on February 19, 2004, and pleaded not guilty to all charges. The indictments emphasized his probable knowledge of, and likely direct involvement with, the fraudulent transactions within Enron. About a month after quitting Enron, Skilling sold almost US$60 million of his stake in the company (in blocks of 10,000 to 500,000 shares), resulting in the prosecutors&#x27; allegation that he sold those shares with inside information of Enron&#x27;s impending bankruptcy. Skilling&#x27;s main attorney was Daniel Petrocelli, the 52-year-old civil litigator who represented Ron Goldman&#x27;s father in his successful civil suit against O. J. Simpson for negligent death. Skilling spent $40 million in preparation for the trial, of which at least $23 million went to his defense lawyers&#x27; retainer. Skilling&#x27;s younger brother Mark is an attorney and assisted his legal team during the criminal trial.

In April 2004, Skilling got into a scuffle with patrons of a cigar bar in New York City after a night of drinking. He was not arrested, but he and his wife, Rebecca, who was hurt during the scuffle, were transported to a hospital where a blood test showed Skilling had a blood-alcohol level of 190 milligrams per deciliter (0.19% BAC), as indicated in the government&#x27;s motion to modify conditions of Skilling&#x27;s pretrial release order. Prosecutors moved against Skilling, asking a judge to increase his $5 million bond to $7 million, restrict his travel to Texas and impose a curfew. They argued that Skilling violated his bond&#x27;s terms by drinking excessively and failing to report his contact with police to federal pretrial services authorities.

The trial began on January 30, 2006, in Houston, despite repeated protests from defense attorneys calling for a change in venue on the grounds that &quot;it was impossible to get a fair trial in Houston&quot;. Enron&#x27;s bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history when it was filed during December 2001, cost 20,000 employees their jobs. In addition, many of them lost their life savings. Investors also lost billions. Skilling and many of the company&#x27;s executives had sold huge portions of their own Enron stock before the bankruptcy filing, making a substantial profit. On May 25, 2006, the jury returned with the following findings regarding Skilling:

* &quot;guilty&quot; on one count of conspiracy
* &quot;guilty&quot; on one count of insider trading
* &quot;guilty&quot; on five counts of making false statements to auditors
* &quot;guilty&quot; on twelve counts of securities fraud
* &quot;not guilty&quot; on nine counts of insider trading

In a front-page interview with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; on June 17, 2006, Skilling claimed that he had been melancholic after the Enron bankruptcy and that he had considered suicide, but that his indictment actually ended his depression. He also claimed that the worst witness against him was himself, and that he would be able to survive a long prison term as long as he is given &quot;something to do, something to accomplish&quot; while in prison.

On October 23, 2006, Skilling was sentenced to 24 years and four months in prison, and was fined . All of his convictions save one were ultimately upheld on appeal, as was his sentence. Skilling&#x27;s request to remain free during appeal was denied by Judge Patrick Higginbotham of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals on December 12, 2006. In ordering Skilling&#x27;s immediate imprisonment, the judge wrote, &quot;Skilling raises no substantial question that is likely to result in the reversal of his convictions on all of the charged counts,&quot; although the order also noted &quot;serious frailties&quot; were possible in some (but not all) of the convictions.

Skilling began his sentence on December 13, 2006, and was housed at the Montgomery Federal Prison Camp, Maxwell Air Force Base, Montgomery, Alabama until 2018. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, he was scheduled for release on February 21, 2019, but on August 30, 2018 Skilling was released from prison and sent to a halfway house in Texas to serve out his prison sentence.

The Securities and Exchange Commission had sued Skilling for his misdeeds in February 2004, around the time that the criminal case was brought. The SEC case was stayed, however, pending resolution of the criminal case. On December 8, 2015, federal judge Melinda Harmon granted summary judgment to the SEC and permanently barred Skilling from serving as an officer or director of a public company.

Skilling was released from federal custody on February 21, 2019.

==2008 events==
Prior to the trial, attorneys for Skilling requested that the notes taken from FBI agents during interviews with Andrew Fastow be given to the defense. A number of inconsistencies in the notes were discovered soon after.

On April 3, 2008, Skilling&#x27;s defense attorney, Daniel Petrocelli, argued with government prosecutors that Skilling&#x27;s trial and the conviction itself was based on honest services fraud, which he said did not apply to Skilling. This argument was based on the idea that, even though Skilling committed illegal financial maneuvers, he did so in order to save the company and did not profit from it. This was cited as a possible basis for overturning some or all of his convictions; however, the chances of this were considered to be very narrow.

Experts believed Skilling&#x27;s best chance was in citing a parallel appeals court decision that had dismissed guilty verdicts on three Merrill Lynch bankers accused of helping Enron to inflate profits.

On October 30, 2008, Skilling was moved to a low-security prison near Littleton, Colorado, as his original prison, FCI Waseca, was being converted to an all-female facility.

==Philosophy==
Richard Dawkins&#x27; book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; was Skilling&#x27;s favorite book and served as the foundation of his managerial philosophy. Skilling held, by his own interpretation, a Darwinian view of what makes the world work. He believed that money and fear were the only things that motivated people. Soon after being hired at Enron, he set up the Performance Review Committee (PRC), a twice-yearly process in which employees were publicly graded by management panels on a scale from 1 to 5, 5 being lowest. Ratings were ostensibly based on job performance and feedback from colleagues and supervisors, but in reality, the highest grades were typically assigned to people bringing in money to the company, and people with internal connections. Employees&#x27; bonuses often rested significantly on their ranking, and those with the lowest ratings were supposed to be fired. The rankings were assigned on a curve at Skilling&#x27;s direction, meaning that ten percent of people had to be graded five, regardless of absolute performance. They were given two weeks to try to find another job at Enron or be fired. The scheme came to be known as &quot;rank and yank&quot;. Skilling described the PRC process as &quot;the most important process we conduct as a company&quot;.

Dawkins has distanced himself from Enron and Skilling, saying that Skilling misunderstood his book. Dawkins has said that he has never advocated selfishness as a means of progression.

==Supreme Court review==

On October 13, 2009, the Supreme Court of the United States agreed to hear two questions presented by Skilling&#x27;s appeal. The Court subsequently scheduled and heard argument March 1, 2010.

The first challenge by Skilling&#x27;s defense was whether or not the federal &quot;honest services fraud&quot; statute (title 18 of the United States Code, section 1346) required the government to prove that Skilling&#x27;s conduct was intended to achieve &quot;private gain&quot; (instead of being intended to advance his employer&#x27;s interests); and, if not, if this statute is unconstitutionally vague. The Court heard two other cases about the same statute on December 8, several months before it heard Skilling&#x27;s appeal: &quot;Black v. United States&quot; and &quot;Weyhrauch v. United States&quot;.

The second issue – &quot;in-house judging&quot; – was whether or not, when a presumption of jury prejudice arises because of the widespread, community effect of the defendant&#x27;s alleged conduct, plus, widespread, inflammatory pretrial publicity, the government may rebut that presumption; and, if so, if the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that no juror was actually prejudiced.

In the arguments on March 1, the issue of jury selection received the most attention. Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor seemed especially bothered by the questioning of one potential juror who reported that she had lost from $50,000 to $60,000 in the Enron debacle. &quot;How can we be satisfied that a fair and impartial jury was picked when the judge doesn&#x27;t follow up when the juror said, &#x27;I&#x27;m a victim of this crime, Sotomayor asked. The government maintained that the judge and the selection process were appropriate. Sri Srinivasan, a partner at O&#x27;Melveny &amp; Myers, was Skilling&#x27;s Washington defense attorney, and Justice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben argued for the government.

On June 24, 2010, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court unanimously nullified Skilling&#x27;s honest services fraud conviction, finding that &quot;Skilling&#x27;s misconduct entailed no bribe or kickback&quot;. The Court remanded the Skilling case back to the lower court for further proceedings to decide which charges must now be dismissed as the result of the invalidation of the honest services statute.

In April 2011, a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that since the jury was presented with &quot;overwhelming evidence&quot; that Skilling conspired to commit conspiracy fraud, the verdict would have been the same even if the honest services theory had never been presented, and Skilling&#x27;s conviction was confirmed. The case in the Fifth Circuit is &quot;United States of America v. Jeffrey K. Skilling&quot;, 06-20885. Skilling appealed this new decision to the Supreme Court, but was denied certiorari. In 2013, Skilling&#x27;s lawyers and the Justice Department reached a deal that called for Skilling&#x27;s sentence to be reduced to 14 years. The reduction was driven in part by a 2009 appeals court ruling that ordered a recalculation of Mr. Skilling’s sentence because of a mistake made by the judge in interpreting the federal sentencing guidelines. In exchange for his reduced sentence, Mr. Skilling gave up about $42 million, to be distributed to victims of Enron’s fraud. He also agreed not to pursue any further legal appeals, including a claim that would have accused the prosecution team of misconduct. Federal judge Simeon T. Lake III, who had presided over Skilling&#x27;s 2006 trial, accepted the deal on June 21, 2013. Jeffrey Skilling was released from federal custody on February 21, 2019, after 12 years in federal prison.

== Business ventures after Enron ==
In June 2020, Skilling was reported by Reuters to be fundraising for launch of an online oil and gas trading platform named Veld LLC. In August 2021, Veld LLC filed as a business in the State of Texas. According to the public records available through the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, Rebecca Carter, Skilling&#x27;s wife, is listed as manager of the company. On August 30, 2022 the company became listed as withdrawn.

==Personal life==
Skilling has a daughter and two sons from his first marriage to Susan Long, which ended in divorce in 1997. His youngest child, John Taylor &quot;JT&quot; Skilling, was found dead from a drug overdose at age 20 in his apartment in Santa Ana, California on February 3, 2011.

In March 2002, Skilling married Rebecca Carter, a former vice president for board communications and board secretary at Enron.

<text>USS &quot;Edsall&quot; (DE-129) was the lead ship of her class of destroyer escort in the United States Navy. She was the second Navy ship named in honor of Seaman Norman Edsall (1873–1899).

&quot;Edsall&quot; was laid down by the Consolidated Steel Corporation at Orange, Texas on 2 July 1942; launched 1 November 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Bessie Edsall Bracey, sister of Seaman Edsall; and commissioned 10 April 1943.

==History==
&quot;Edsall&quot; was a schoolship at Norfolk, 20 June to 6 August 1943, for pre-commissioning crews of escort vessels, then served at Miami with the Submarine Chaser Training Center. In March 1944, she joined a tanker convoy at Galveston, Texas, assigned to Escort Division 59, whose flagship she became 24 March. &quot;Edsall&quot; continued escort duty from the Gulf of Mexico to New York City and Norfolk, and with one convoy to NS Argentia, Newfoundland. In May, she sailed to Bermuda for antisubmarine warfare tests using a captured Italian submarine.

Between 1 July 1944 and 3 June 1945, she ranged Atlantic sealanes guarding seven convoys carrying the very lifeblood to the Mediterranean and Britain. While escorting the sixth convoy en route to New York from Liverpool on 10 April 1945, &quot;Edsall&quot; along with other escorts were quick to come to the assistance of two tankers in the convoy who had collided. &quot;Edsall&quot; searched for survivors and helped extinguish fires which broke out.

&quot;Edsall&quot; sailed for the Pacific on 24 June 1945, but World War II ended while she was training at Pearl Harbor, and she returned East. She was placed out of commission in reserve at Green Cove Springs, Florida, on 11 June 1946.

&quot;Edsall&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1968, and sold for scrap in July 1969.

<text>Lost Dogs is a two-disc compilation album by the American alternative rock band Pearl Jam, released on November 11, 2003 through Epic Records. The album has been certified gold by the RIAA in the United States.

==Overview==
&quot;Lost Dogs&quot; is a double-disc collection of B-sides and other released and unreleased rarities. &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; sold 89,500 copies in its first week of release and debuted at number fifteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; has been certified gold by the RIAA.

A number of songs included on &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; differ from the originally released versions, including &quot;Alone&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;Wash&quot; and &quot;Dirty Frank&quot;. The album includes the hidden track &quot;4/20/02&quot; at the end of disc two, a tribute to Alice in Chains frontman Layne Staley. It was written by vocalist Eddie Vedder during the recording sessions for &quot;Riot Act&quot; on the day that he heard the news of Staley&#x27;s death. The song features only Vedder singing and playing the guitar in a ukulele-inspired tuning. According to Vedder, the reason why it was not included on &quot;Riot Act&quot; was that the band already had too many songs. According to guitarist Mike McCready, the reason the song was only featured as a hidden track on &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; is because Vedder &quot;wouldn&#x27;t want it to be exploitative&quot;.

&quot;Angel&quot; (from the 1993 fan club Christmas single) was supposed to appear on disc two, but was deleted before release. There is still mention of it on the &quot;lost dogs&quot; flyers on the back cover. Besides &quot;Angel&quot;, some notable omissions from the album include various songs only available on other fan club Christmas singles by the band, &quot;I Got Id&quot; and &quot;Long Road&quot; from the &quot;Merkin Ball&quot; EP, and &quot;Leatherman&quot; from the &quot;Given to Fly&quot; single.

The song &quot;Bee Girl&quot; is a tribute to Heather DeLoach, who appeared in a bee costume in the music video for &quot;No Rain&quot; by Blind Melon.

==Reception==

&quot;Lost Dogs&quot; was generally well-received by music critics upon its initial release. AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four and a half out of five stars. He said, &quot;This is further proof that Pearl Jam consciously turned away from the big, anthemic sound and spirit that won them a mass audience with &quot;Ten&quot;—they still had the songs and sound, they just chose to bury it. &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; crackles with that passion and it has another advantage: unlike most of Pearl Jam&#x27;s albums, it&#x27;s a fun, compulsive listen. More than any other album in its catalog, &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; captures what Pearl Jam stood for and what it felt like at their peak.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; staff writer David Fricke gave the album three out of five stars, saying that &quot;for an album of odds &#x27;n&#x27; sods, &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; sure sounds a lot like a pack of hits.&quot; In a review for &quot;Spin&quot;, music critic Will Hermes compared it to other compilations by claiming that &quot;Unlike most collections of its kind, Dogs seems motivated more by good sense than greed; even the song about saving the whales is kinda kicky.&quot;

<text>In dance, release technique is any of various dance techniques that focus on breathing, muscle relaxation, anatomical considerations, and the use of gravity and momentum to facilitate efficient movement. It can be found in modern and postmodern dance, and has been influenced by the work of modern dance pioneers, therapeutic movement techniques such as Skinner Releasing Technique, Feldenkrais and Alexander Technique, and yoga and martial arts.

==History==

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries dancers began to question the rigidity and formality of classical ballet. Isadora Duncan in particular articulated the need for dance which she described as being connected to the earth, sensuality and the natural body. In pursuit of this goal, pioneers such as Margeret D&#x27;Oubler, Martha Graham, Rudolf von Laban and Doris Humphrey began to invent new dance techniques that involved radically different movement.

Elements of release technique began to emerge as these pioneers, and protégés such as Merce Cunningham, José Limón, Irmgard Bartenieff, Erick Hawkins and Anna Halprin, contributed further ideas and inventions. For example, D&#x27;Oubler envisioned dance based on scientific analysis of human anatomy and movement; Humphrey&#x27;s technique focused on allowing gravity and momentum to affect the body; Hawkins advanced the idea that physiologically efficient movement is inherently beautiful. Some elements were the result of exploring other movement disciplines. For example, Hawkins invited proponents of Ideokinesis to teach his dance company, and others were influenced by F.M. Alexander&#x27;s concepts.

The term &quot;release technique&quot; emerged in the 1970s, predominantly through the work of Mary Fulkerson and Joan Skinner. Modern dancer Joan Skinner synthesised her dance training with principles from the Alexander Technique creating a codified system called &quot;Skinner Releasing Technique&quot;. Mary Fulkerson, whose dance technique, which she called Anatomical Release Technique was informed primarily by Mabel Elsworth Todd, Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen and Steve Paxton. Although the names of the two techniques are similar, they developed relatively independently from each other. Through Fulkerson&#x27;s pedagogical work in Dartington College of Arts, SNDO and Arnhem she established release-based professional dance training in Europe; whereas Skinner&#x27;s technique has been taken up in Universities in the UK, where Alexander Technique remains the most established Somatic discipline.

It is uncommon for teachers to teach either Anatomical Release Technique, or Skinner Releasing Technique in the form taught by these two women; the principles which led to the development of both techniques predate both Fulkerson and Skinner, and they permeate professional contemporary dance education in a more diffuse way. The nomenclature is their most easily traceable contribution.

==Contemporary technique==

Today elements of tai chi, yoga, and somatic practices such as the Feldenkrais method can be found in Release Technique. Elements of release technique can be found in contact improvisation. In dance, it is usually taught as an integrated part of contemporary dance classes and, less frequently, in classes that focus on release technique.

<text>Oy Wasawings Ab was an airline based in Finland which was operational from 1981 to 1988.

==History==
The airline got its permission to fly in November 1981 from the Civil Aviation Administration of Finland. After that this permission was extended to also include taxi and charter flights by 1982 to 1983. In December 1983 Wasawings started regular light route traffic between Ilmajoki and Helsinki-Vantaa. It flew from Helsinki to Ylivieska in 1985. After that many complaints of the company operation were received from customers and staff. The company had a poor security culture and airline captains were forced to shift numbers in flight logs. The company&#x27;s main owners were the chairman Veikko Tuutti and certain companies from Ostrobothnia. Also it had numerous small-part investors. Wasa Wings had 13,000 passengers in 1987 and 14,600 passengers in 1988.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On August 31, 1986 its Cessna 404 Titan (OH-CIG) crashed into a power line which ran along the edge of the Ylivieska airport. The plane cut trees over 150 meters and then caught fire. 
*The company lost its flying licence when an Embraer 110 EMB-P1 Bandeirante (OH-EBA, built in 1979 and leased from Kar-Air) crashed near Ilmajoki on a flight from Helsinki.

==Fleet==
In addition to Embraer and Cessna 404, the company had two Beech 99 aircraft.

<doc id="477701" wikidata="Q295599" url="?curid=477701" title="Two-Face">
<text>Two-Face is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Bob Kane, and first appeared in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #66 (August 1942). He has become one of the superhero Batman&#x27;s most enduring enemies belonging to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery.

In his comic book appearances, Two-Face is the alter ego of Harvey Dent, Gotham City&#x27;s former district attorney who becomes a criminal mastermind obsessed with duality and the number two. Half of his face is hideously scarred after mob boss Sal Maroni throws acid at him. The resulting disfigurement drives him insane and causes him to make decisions based on the flip of a coin. The Modern Age of Comic Books portrays the character as having dissociative identity disorder, with Two-Face being an alternate personality that developed as a result of childhood abuse. The modern version is also established as having once been an ally of Batman and Commissioner James Gordon, and a close friend of Batman&#x27;s secret identity, Bruce Wayne.

The character has been adapted in various media incarnations, having been portrayed in film by Billy Dee Williams in &quot;Batman&quot; (1989), Tommy Lee Jones in &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995), Aaron Eckhart in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008), and Harry Lawtey in &quot;&quot; (2024), in television by Nicholas D&#x27;Agosto in the Fox series &quot;Gotham&quot;, and Misha Collins in The CW series &quot;Gotham Knights&quot;. Richard Moll, Troy Baker, and others have provided Two-Face&#x27;s voice in animation and video games.

==Publication history==
===Creation and Golden Age history===

Two-Face was created by Batman co-creator Bob Kane, and debuted in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #66 (&quot;The Crimes of Two-Face&quot;), written by Batman&#x27;s other co-creator Bill Finger, in August 1942 as a new Batman villain originally named Harvey &quot;Apollo&quot; Kent, a handsome, law-abiding former Gotham City district attorney close to the Batman. Half of his face was disfigured when a mob boss he was prosecuting, Sal Maroni, splashed Kent with acid, resulting in his loss of sanity and turn to crime, with his crimes centered around the number 2. In creating Two-Face, Kane was inspired by the 1931 adaptation of the Robert Louis Stevenson story &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, which Kane described as a &quot;classic story of the good and evil sides of human nature&quot;, and was also influenced by the 1925 silent film adaptation of Gaston Leroux&#x27;s novel &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. Kane and Finger conceived the idea of Two-Face flipping a coin scarred on one side to determine which side of his personality emerges: evil if the coin flip results in the scarred side, which causes him to &quot;go on a rampage of looting and destruction&quot;, or good if it results in the unscarred side, causing him to give his loot to charity or refrain from committing a crime. In Kane&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Batman and Me&quot;, Kane suggests that Finger was inspired by the pulp magazine hero Black Bat, with their similarities as both district attorneys disfigured with acid. Two-Face&#x27;s last name Kent was later changed to Dent, which Kane infers was done to avoid confusion with Superman&#x27;s alter ego Clark Kent.

&quot;The Crimes of Two-Face&quot; also introduced Two-Face&#x27;s devoted wife Gilda Dent, a long-standing character in Two-Face stories. Later appearances continued featuring the character&#x27;s criminal life until he was cured through plastic surgery in his third appearance and shown reformed in 1952&#x27;s &quot;The Double Crimes of Two-Face!&quot; (&quot;Detective Comics&quot; #187), with impostors taking Two-Face&#x27;s place in later stories. Two-Face made his last appearance in the Golden Age of Comic Books in 1954&#x27;s &quot;Two-Face Strikes Again&quot; (&quot;Batman&quot; #81), in which Two-Face returns to crime; however, this story is non-canon to the Golden Age version of the character, because only the Two-Face stories from 1942 to 1952 were assigned to DC&#x27;s setting for their Golden Age characters, Earth-Two.

===Dormancy and revitalization===
The character was unused throughout the Silver Age of Comic Books, only appearing in the 173rd issue of &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; in 1968 which featured Batman transforming into Two-Face. In July 1971, during the Bronze Age of Comic Books, Two-Face was brought back by writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil and former DC editor Julius Schwartz in the story &quot;Half an Evil&quot; (&quot;Batman&quot; #234). Written by O&#x27;Neil and drawn by Neal Adams, &quot;Half an Evil&quot; is a mystery story which features Two-Face stealing doubloons from a pirate ship; the issue also retold his origin with a recap of previous stories. After his reintroduction, Two-Face was featured in several DC comics, such as &quot;The Brave and The Bold&quot;, &quot;Justice League of America&quot;, and &quot;Teen Titans&quot;, and became one of Batman&#x27;s most popular enemies.

===Modern Age===

Following the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; comic event which rebooted the DC Universe, Two-Face was reintroduced in Frank Miller&#x27;s 1986 revision of Batman&#x27;s origin, &quot;&quot;, as Gotham City&#x27;s former crusader against crime and former ally of the Batman. Later in 1990, Two-Face was given a revised origin by Andrew Helfer in 1990&#x27;s &quot;The Eye of the Beholder&quot; (&quot;Batman&quot; Annual #14) which established Harvey Dent as having dissociative identity disorder effected by the psychological trauma from his past of childhood abuse dealt by his father, with Two-Face being a second personality state, and cemented Dent as being formerly part of an alliance with Batman and Commissioner James Gordon against crime in Gotham City. 1995&#x27;s &quot;Batman/Two-Face: Crime and Punishment&quot; by writer J. M. DeMatteis and artist Scott McDaniel built on &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; and explored Dent&#x27;s psyche and childhood with his abusive father. Two-Face&#x27;s origin was later expanded in writer Jeph Loeb and artist Tim Sale&#x27;s 1996 Batman limited series &quot;&quot;, which incorporated aspects of &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; and explored Batman, Gordon and Dent&#x27;s struggle to end Gotham&#x27;s Mob during the rise of costumed supervillains.

A reformed Dent rid of Two-Face was featured in the 2002 storyline &quot;&quot;, continuing on to 2006 in the &quot;52&quot; limited series and in writer James Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; arc &quot;&quot;, which explored Dent having trained under Batman and taking Batman&#x27;s place as Gotham&#x27;s protector during Batman&#x27;s one-year absence, as well as Two-Face&#x27;s return. In the 2006 limited series &quot;Two-Face: Year One&quot; written by Mark Sable, Two-Face was given a revamped origin, focusing on Dent&#x27;s transformation into Two-Face during Dent&#x27;s election campaign for district attorney, as well as establishing the relationship between a young Harvey Dent and Bruce Wayne, Batman&#x27;s secret identity.

Following DC&#x27;s &quot;New 52&quot; reboot in 2011, Two-Face&#x27;s origin was changed by writer Peter J. Tomasi in the 2014 &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; arc The Big Burn, altering the cause of Dent&#x27;s transformation into Two-Face and introducing Gilda Dent&#x27;s death into his origin; the story also established Dent&#x27;s knowledge of Bruce Wayne being Batman, and concluded with Dent dying by suicide. The subsequent &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; 2016 soft reboot reintroduced Two-Face in Scott Snyder&#x27;s My Own Worst Enemy arc in &quot;All-Star Batman&quot;, in which Batman tries to obtain a cure to rid Dent of Two-Face in a road trip. Two-Face was then featured in the 2020 &quot;Detective Comics&quot; arc Ugly Heart, which showed Dent surviving his suicide attempt in Tomasi&#x27;s previous story &quot;The Big Burn&quot; then starting a cult named the Church of Two, before being rid of Two-Face through brain surgery conducted by Batman. Dent is shown reformed throughout comics such as Matthew Rosenberg&#x27;s 2021 limited series &quot;Task Force Z&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot;.

In 2024, Two-Face received a solo series as part of the DC All In initiative.

==Characterization==
===Description===
Two-Face is a duality-obsessed criminal. Introduced in 1942 as a criminal mastermind obsessed with the number 2, Two-Face&#x27;s crimes as well as his hideouts and henchmen surround the number; since the 1980s, Two-Face&#x27;s duality obsession evolved into an obsession with the duality of man, with the character committing crimes based on his &quot;misguided sense of right and wrong&quot;.

Two-Face views himself as both good and evil, and relies on flipping his double-headed coin, scarred on one side, in making important decisions and deciding whether his good or evil side will prevail.

Widely considered Batman&#x27;s most tragic villain, Two-Face was established as a tragic figure in his debut: a former law-abiding district attorney turned criminal whose disfigurement resulted in him being shunned by society, which led to his turn to crime. In his early stories, Two-Face yearns to fix his face and bring back the love of his wife who he mistakenly thinks does not love him because of his disfigurement. 1990&#x27;s &quot;The Eye of the Beholder&quot; (&quot;Batman&quot; Annual #14) reimagined Two-Face for the Modern Age as having psychological trauma from the childhood abuse he received from his father, and depicted him as being on the verge of a mental breakdown as a result of his repressed trauma and the pressure of fighting crime in Gotham, and driven to a point of desperation by Gotham&#x27;s corruption. &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; also established Two-Face as a second personality state of Harvey Dent&#x27;s dissociative identity disorder which resulted from his trauma; a psychiatrist in the story describes his condition as having &quot;two personalities&quot;, with Dent having managed to &quot;sublimate the second, anti-social one since he was a teenager&quot;.

===Skills and abilities===
Two-Face has no superpowers, instead relying on his proficiency in marksmanship and martial arts, which was further improved after being trained by Deathstroke and Batman. As a former lawyer, the character uses his expertise in criminal law, criminology, and police procedures to devise his crimes.

Before his transformation into Two-Face, Harvey Dent had a successful career as Gotham&#x27;s district attorney, driven to bring an end to the city&#x27;s epidemic of organized crime. Following his disfigurement, he becomes obsessed with the number two and the concept of duality. Thus, Two-Face stages crimes centered around the number two—such as robbing buildings with &quot;2&quot; in the address or staging events that will take place at 10:22 p.m. (2222 in military time). He was an accomplished lawyer highly skilled in almost all matters relating to criminal law and an extensive knowledge of the criminal world. He is also a charismatic leader and speaker. Two-Face is a genius in criminal planning and has an exceptional character, which allows him, among other things, to stoically endure pain and recover from smudging injuries in a short time. Two-Face is a skilled marksman, and regularly uses a variety of firearms such as pistols, shotguns, grenade launchers, Tommy guns, knives and rocket launchers during his battles with Batman. He primarily wields dual pistols, and has become dangerously skilled with them.

Harvey Dent has kept himself in peak physical conditions, even before his transformation into Two-Face and had exercise equipment in his office when he was an assistant district attorney. The &quot;Batman: Face the Face&quot; story arc reveals that Batman, shortly before leaving Gotham for a year, trains Dent extensively in detective work and martial arts. To further improve his proficiency in the use of firearms, Dent hires the sharpshooting assassin Deathstroke to train him.

===Relationships===
This section details the character&#x27;s most notable relationships across various interpretations of the Batman mythos:

====Gilda====
Gilda Dent in some iterations, is Harvey Dent&#x27;s wife. Her character debuted in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #66, alongside Harvey, and became a recurring character in Batman stories involving Two-Face.

====Bruce Wayne====
Batman&#x27;s alter-ego Bruce Wayne is the best friend of Harvey Dent, while before becoming Two-Face, Harvey was also one of Batman&#x27;s earliest allies, predating Batman&#x27;s partnership with James Gordon. Their friendship goes back to Harvey&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, in which Batman refers to him as his friend and emotionally asks him to give up his life of crime. Because of this relationship, Two-Face is one of Batman&#x27;s most personal enemies. In the comics, it is shown that Bruce considers Harvey&#x27;s downfall a personal failure, and has never given up in rehabilitating him.

It is established canonically that Harvey knows Bruce Wayne is Batman. The character&#x27;s knowledge of Batman&#x27;s secret identity was introduced in the story &quot;The Big Burn&quot; from Peter Tomasi&#x27;s 2011 &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; ongoing series, and is shown in subsequent comics such as Scott Snyder&#x27;s &quot;All-Star Batman&quot;, in which they were established as childhood best friends. In &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #1021, Harvey admits to Batman that he has been keeping his identity secret from his Two-Face personality to protect him.

====Renee Montoya====
Renee Montoya and Harvey Dent have a complicated relationship, introduced by writer Greg Rucka in the sixteenth issue of 1999&#x27;s &quot;Batman Chronicles&quot;, in which Renee reaches out to Two-Face&#x27;s Dent persona and is kind to him. Their relationship continues with the &quot;&quot; crossover storyline; in one issue, Harvey sends Renee flowers for her birthday and Renee visits him in Arkham Asylum. Harvey eventually develops romantic feelings towards Renee, which Renee doesn&#x27;t return. This one-sided love would turn into an unhealthy obsession with her, which would lead to her professional and personal ruin; in the five-part Gotham Central story arc &quot;Half a Life&quot;, Two-Face attempts to destroy Renee&#x27;s life by framing her for murder, outing her as a lesbian, and orchestrating a prison escape to make her a fugitive, so she would have nothing to keep her from returning his love.

Years after the release of &quot;Half a Life&quot;, Rucka would reunite the two in &quot;Convergence: The Question&quot; in 2015, following his return to DC Comics after his departure from the company in 2010. In the story, Renee saves a remorseful Harvey from killing himself, and convinces him to be a good man.

Rucka has talked about the characters&#x27; relationship in an interview with Comic Book:
====Christopher Dent====
Christopher Dent is Harvey Dent&#x27;s abusive and alcoholic father, first introduced in the definitive Two-Face origin story &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; (&quot;Batman&quot; Annual #14). Dent would beat his son based on the flip of a coin, heads he would beat Harvey, tails he wouldn&#x27;t. Because the coin was double headed, Harvey would always be beaten. The trauma Harvey received from his father&#x27;s constant abuse fueled the inner torment that eventually turns him into Two-Face.

==Character biography==
===Golden Age===

Two-Face&#x27;s debut and Golden Age origin story, 1942&#x27;s &quot;The Crimes of Two-Face&quot; (&quot;Detective Comics&quot; #66), introduced him as Harvey &quot;Apollo&quot; Kent, a handsome law-abiding Gotham City district attorney prosecuting mob boss Sal Maroni; the issue also introduced his wife, Gilda Kent, who is a sculptor. During the trial, after Kent presents Maroni&#x27;s lucky two-headed coin as evidence, an enraged Maroni throws acid at Kent&#x27;s face and disfigures it in half. Kent, driven insane by society&#x27;s repulsion and his wife&#x27;s nonacceptance of his new appearance, destroys his wife&#x27;s sculpture of him to resemble his disfigurement and scars one side of Maroni&#x27;s two-headed coin to symbolize his appearance&#x27;s duality of beauty and ugliness, then flips the coin to decide whether to become a criminal or wait for the only plastic surgeon able to fix Kent&#x27;s face, who was caught in a concentration camp in Germany, to arrive. With the scarred side of the coin being the result of Kent&#x27;s coin flip, Kent decides to become a criminal with the alias Two-Face who depends on flipping his coin to determine whether to be evil or good; afterwards, with the coin landing on the scarred side, Two-Face robs a bank, then, with the coin landing on the unscarred side, gives his loot to charity, causing confusion between the police and populace, whose opinions are divided about Two-Face&#x27;s morality. The rest of the issue features Two-Face committing a series of crimes centered on the number 2, one of which is stopped by Batman, who pursues and corners Two-Face after he escapes. Batman makes Two-Face a proposition to give himself up and start over, to which Two-Face replies that the coin makes all his decisions for him, then flips the coin. The issue ends with the coin landing on its edge, making Two-Face leave his life to fate, with the story being resolved in &quot;The Man Who Led a Double Life!&quot; (&quot;Detective Comics&quot; #68). Harvey Kent is cured through plastic surgery in 1943&#x27;s &quot;The End of Two-Face&quot; (&quot;Detective Comics&quot; #80), and is shown reformed in 1952&#x27;s &quot;The Double Crimes of Two-Face!&quot; (&quot;Detective Comics&quot; #187).

Kent would later be framed for crimes done by imposters like his butler Wilkins, Paul Sloane, and George Blake.

Later, Kent attends the wedding of Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle as a guest in 1981&#x27;s &quot;The Kill Kent Contract!&quot; (&quot;Superman Family&quot; #211).

===Bronze Age===

In Two-Face&#x27;s Bronze Age reintroduction, &quot;Half a Life&quot; (&quot;Batman&quot; #234), Two-Face concocts an elaborate scheme to steal doubloons from a historical schooner, which Batman realizes and attempts to stop. As Batman approaches the ship, Two-Face finds and incapacitates him, then ties him up, eventually leaving the ship after he lets it sink. Before Two-Face leaves, Batman tries to convince Two-Face to flip his coin to save an old man unwittingly caught in the trap by reminding him that he is both good and evil; Two-Face first disagrees until after his departure from the ship when he is unable to resist flipping his coin. With the coin landing on the unscarred side, Two-Face returns to the ship to rescue the old man, then sees Batman had escaped his restraints. Batman offers Two-Face to surrender, to which Two-Face disagrees and attempts to attack Batman, with Two-Face being knocked out unconscious by Batman afterwards. &quot;Half a Life&quot; also includes a recap of his Golden Age stories as his origin: from his transformation to Two-Face and his subsequent reformation to his criminal relapse, as depicted in the 1954 story &quot;Two-Face Strikes Again!&quot; (Batman #81), in which Harvey Dent&#x27;s plastic surgery is undone after he attempts to prevent a robbery, causing his return as Two-Face.

In &quot;Threat of the Two-Headed Coin!&quot; (&quot;Batman&quot; #258), Two-Face is broken out of Arkham Hospital by a retired United States Army general who hires Two-Face to blackmail the United States government with an atomic bomb. After Two-Face betrays the general and takes over his plan, the general reveals the scheme to Batman, then dies by suicide out of remorse. Later, in the United States Capitol, Two-Face interrupts a Congress meeting to carry out the extortion scheme: in exchange for not exploding the Capitol with an atomic bomb, Two-Face demands the United States government to give him two billion dollars and gemstones, with Two-Face intending to use the money to bribe people to ignore his hideous appearance and end his misery; Batman eventually foils Two-Face&#x27;s plan.

Two-Face then appears in a number of non-Batman comics, such as &quot;The Joker&quot;, &quot;Justice League of America&quot;, and &quot;Teen Titans&quot;. &quot;The Joker&#x27;s&quot; first issue, &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Double Jeopardy&quot;, features Two-Face and fellow Batman adversary Joker battling each other to prove who is the superior criminal, while &quot;Justice League of America&#x27;s&quot; 125-26th issues, &quot;The Men Who Sold Destruction!&quot; and &quot;The Evil Connection&quot;, shows Two-Face assisting the superhero team Justice League. In &quot;Teen Titans&quot;, Two-Face meets Teen Titans member Duela Dent who claims to be his daughter.

In the 313-314th issues of &quot;Batman&quot;, Two-Face steals a top secret missile activation code owned by the United States government and goes to New Orleans, with Batman and a United States federal agent reluctantly working together to trail him and obtain the code. On a float in the Mardi Gras parade, Two-Face deceives an American and a Russian representative who each negotiated for the code for $22,000,000 and steals $44,000,000 from them; Two-Face then escapes from the float to a blimp, with Batman and the agent in pursuit. Afterwards, while Batman hangs from the blimp&#x27;s hatch, Two-Face flips the coin to decide whether to kill him, with the agent eventually shooting the coin outwards the hatch. Two-Face, declaring that his life is meaningless without the coin, leaps for it and falls out of the blimp.

Two-Face changes his face through plastic surgery as well as his identity to Carl Ternion in &quot;Batman&#x27;s&quot; 328-329th issues, and reunites with Gilda Dent to make her happy after her former husband, Dave Stevens, died. Two-Face then avenges Stevens&#x27; death by killing Sal Maroni, who had also changed his face and his identity to Anton Karoselle and had killed Gilda Dent&#x27;s former husband. Karoselle&#x27;s death and Two-Face and Maroni&#x27;s changed identities are significant aspects of the mystery Batman solves in the story: how Ternion murdered Karoselle twice and had been acquitted for it, as Ternion admits in a video tape sent to Batman by Two-Face. Later, Two-Face runs away from Gilda Dent after his plastic surgery becomes undone, and afterwards, Batman tells Gilda Dent the truth about Ternion&#x27;s actual identity and convinces her of a plan to lure and take down Two-Face: Batman disguises himself as Maroni attacking Gilda Dent as bait, and, with Two-Face chasing him, leads Two-Face to the Gotham City courthouse, where Batman and Gilda Dent eventually convince Two-Face to rehabilitate himself in Arkham.

In the two-issue arc &quot;Half a Hero... Is Better Than None!&quot; from &quot;Batman&quot; #346 and &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #513, Two-Face escapes Arkham Asylum and puts Batman in an elaborate death trap set in a converted halfway house, eventually capturing Batman and imprisoning him for a week, after which Two-Face attempts to rob a record company named Duo Records, and is stopped by Batman&#x27;s sidekick, Robin. Two-Face, having escaped the encounter, returns to the halfway house. Afterwards, Batman escapes by creating and putting on a Two-Face mask, causing Two-Face to release him.

Two-Face&#x27;s good and evil sides are in conflict in a four-issue storyline in &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, with his evil side being predominant. Two-Face allies with Batman villain Black Mask&#x27;s former lover Circe who convinces him to steal a pharaoh&#x27;s death mask concealed within a sarcophagus which she states to be imbued with magic that could restore his good side; this plan is revealed to be conceived by Batman, who is working with Circe to trick Two-Face into having his good side restored and have him rehabilitated. The plan doesn&#x27;t work with Two-Face&#x27;s evil side taking over.

===Modern Age===

The Post-Crisis and followed up in &quot;The Long Halloween&quot; established this version of Two-Face is depicted as having had an unhappy childhood; his father was a mentally ill alcoholic who beat him regularly, often deciding whether or not to brutalize his son based on a flip of his lucky coin. The abuse instilled in Dent his lifelong struggle with free will and his eventual inability to make choices on his own, relying on the coin to make all of his decisions. Dent is diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder at a young age, but manages to hide his illnesses and, thanks to an unyielding work ethic, rises up through the ranks of Gotham City&#x27;s district attorney&#x27;s office until, at age 26, he becomes the youngest DA in the city&#x27;s history. Gordon even suspected that Dent could be Batman, but discarded this suspicion when he realized that Dent lacked the vigilante&#x27;s financial resources. Dent forges an alliance with Gordon and Batman to rid Gotham of organized crime. Mob boss Carmine Falcone bribes corrupt Assistant District Attorney Vernon Fields to provide his lieutenant Sal Maroni, whom Dent is trying for murder, with sulfuric acid; Maroni throws the acid in Dent&#x27;s face during a cross-examination, horribly scarring the left side of Dent&#x27;s face. Dent escapes from the hospital and reinvents himself as the gangster Two-Face. He scars one side of his father&#x27;s coin and uses it to decide whether to commit a crime. Eventually, Two-Face takes his revenge on Falcone, Fields and Maroni, but is captured by Batman, leading to his incarceration in Arkham Asylum.

During the &quot;&quot; story arc, the serial killer Hangman targets various cops who assisted in Dent&#x27;s rise to the D.A.&#x27;s office. Two-Face gathers Gotham&#x27;s criminals to assist in the destruction of the city&#x27;s crime lords. After a climactic struggle in the Batcave, Two-Face is betrayed by the Joker, who shoots at Dent, causing him to fall into a chasm, presumably to his death. Batman admits in the aftermath that, even if Two-Face has survived, Harvey Dent is gone forever. During a much later period, Two-Face is revealed to have murdered the father of Jason Todd, the second Robin. When attempting to apprehend Two-Face, Jason briefly has the criminal at his mercy, but lets Two-Face&#x27;s punishment be decided by the law. Two-Face similarly serves as a &#x27;baptism by fire&#x27; for Tim Drake, the third Robin. Two-Face has Batman at his mercy, but Tim dons the Robin suit to save Batman.

In &quot;Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth&quot;, Arkham&#x27;s doctors replace Dent&#x27;s coin with a die and eventually a tarot deck, but rather than becoming self-reliant, Dent is now unable to make even the smallest of decisions—such as going to the bathroom. Batman returns the coin, telling Two-Face to use it to decide whether to kill him. Batman leaves safely, but it is implied that Two-Face made his own decision to let Batman live.

In the &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; storyline, in which Gotham is devastated by an earthquake, Two-Face claims a portion of the ruined city, takes up residence in Gotham City Hall, and forms a temporary alliance with Gordon to share certain territory. His empire is brought down by Bane (employed by Lex Luthor), who destroys Two-Face&#x27;s gang during his destruction of the city&#x27;s Hall of Records. Two-Face kidnaps Gordon and puts him on trial for his activities after Gotham City is declared a &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, with Two-Face as both judge and prosecutor for Gordon&#x27;s illegal alliance with him; Gordon later plays upon Two-Face&#x27;s split psyche to demand Harvey Dent as his defense attorney. Dent cross-examines Two-Face and wins an acquittal for Gordon, determining that Two-Face has effectively blackmailed Gordon by implying that he had committed murders to aid the Commissioner. During this time, Two-Face also meets detective Renee Montoya. Montoya reaches the Dent persona in Two-Face and is kind to him. He falls in love with her, though the romance is one-sided.

Eventually in the &quot;Gotham Central&quot; series, he outs her as a lesbian and frames her for murder, hoping that if he takes everything from her, she will be left with no choice but to be with him. She is furious, and the two fight for control of his gun until Batman intervenes, putting Two-Face back in Arkham.

In the &quot;Batman: Two-Face - Crime and Punishment&quot; one-shot comic book, Two-Face captures his own father, planning to humiliate and kill him on live television for the years of abuse that he suffered. This story reveals that, despite his apparent hatred for his father, Dent still supports him, paying for an expensive home rather than allowing him to live in a slum. At the end of the book, the Dent and Two-Face personalities argue in thought, Two-Face calling Dent &quot;spineless&quot;. Dent proves Two-Face wrong, choosing to jump off a building and commit suicide just to put a stop to his alter ego&#x27;s crime spree. Two-Face is surprised when the coin flip comes up scarred but abides by the decision and jumps. Batman catches him, but the shock of the fall seems to (at least temporarily) destroy the Two-Face personality. In &quot;Batman: Two-Face Strikes Twice!&quot;, Two-Face is at odds with his ex-wife Gilda Grace Dent, as he believes their marriage failed because he was unable to give her children. She later marries Paul Janus (a reference to the Roman god of doors, who had two faces). Two-Face attempts to frame Janus as a criminal by kidnapping him and replacing him with a stand-in, whom Two-Face &quot;disfigures&quot; with makeup. Batman eventually catches Two-Face, and Gilda and Janus reunite. Years later, Gilda gives birth to twins, prompting Two-Face to escape once more and take the twins hostage, as he erroneously believes them to be conceived by Janus using an experimental fertility drug. The end of the book reveals that Two-Face is the twins&#x27; natural father.

====&quot;Batman: Hush&quot;====
In the &quot;&quot; storyline, Dent&#x27;s face is repaired by plastic surgery, seemingly eradicating the Two-Face personality. Dent takes the law into his own hands twice: once by using his ability to manipulate the legal system to free the Joker, and then again by shooting the serial killer Hush. He manipulates the courts into setting him free, as Gotham&#x27;s prosecutors would not attempt to charge him without a body.

====Return to villainy====
In the Batman story arc &quot;&quot;, which started in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #817, and was part of DC&#x27;s &quot;One Year Later&quot; storyline, it is revealed that, at Batman&#x27;s request and with his training, Harvey Dent becomes a vigilante protector of Gotham City in most of Batman&#x27;s absence of nearly a year. He is reluctant to take the job, but Batman assures him that it will serve as atonement for his past crimes. After a month of training, they fight Firebug and Mr. Freeze, before Batman leaves for a year. Dent enjoys his new role, but his methods are more extreme and less refined than Batman&#x27;s. Upon Batman&#x27;s return, Dent begins to feel unnecessary and unappreciated, which prompts the return of the &quot;Two-Face&quot; persona (seen and heard by Dent through hallucinations). In &quot;Face the Face&quot;, his frustration is compounded by a series of mysterious murders that seem to have been committed by Two-Face; the villains KGBeast, Magpie, Ventriloquist and Scarface, and Orca are all shot twice in the head with a double-barreled pistol. When Batman confronts Dent about these deaths, asking him to confirm that he was not responsible, Dent refuses to give a definite answer. He then detonates a bomb in his apartment and leaves Batman dazed as he flees. Despite escaping the explosion physically unscathed, Dent suffers a crisis of conscience and a mental battle with his &quot;Two-Face&quot; personality. Although Batman later uncovers evidence that exonerates Dent for the murders, establishing that he was framed as revenge for his efforts against new crime boss Warren White, a.k.a. the Great White Shark, it is too late to save him. Prompted by resentment and a paranoid reaction to Batman&#x27;s questioning, Dent scars half his face with nitric acid and a scalpel, becoming Two-Face once again. Blaming Batman for his return, Two-Face immediately goes on a rampage, threatening to destroy the Gotham Zoo (having retained two of every animal—including two humans) before escaping to fight Batman another day. Batman subsequently confronts White, while acknowledging that he cannot attack White, as there is no explicit evidence supporting Batman&#x27;s deductions, vowing to inform Two-Face of White&#x27;s actions when they next face each other.

On the cover of &quot;Justice League of America&quot; (vol. 2) #23, Two-Face is shown as a member of the new Injustice League. He can be seen in &quot;Salvation Run&quot;. He appears in &quot;&quot;, which shows the effects of Batman&#x27;s death on his enemies. In Judd Winick&#x27;s &quot;Long Shadow&quot; arc, Two-Face realizes that someone else has taken over as Batman. He hires a teleporter and manages to infiltrate the Batcave. When the new Batman investigates the cave, Two-Face ambushes him with tranquilizer darts, and in a hallucination he sees Dent in a red and black Two-Face themed Batman costume. Alfred Pennyworth saves the hero from Two-Face&#x27;s torture after subduing his accomplice, and with his help Batman convinces Two-Face that he is the real, original Dark Knight, informing Dent that his problem is that he cannot imagine Batman changing because he himself is incapable of seeing the world in anything other than black and white. In &quot;Streets of Gotham&quot;, Two-Face has been at odds with Gotham&#x27;s latest district attorney, Kate Spencer, also known as the vigilante Manhunter. Two-Face has recently been driven out of Gotham City by Jeremiah Arkham.

====&quot;The New 52&quot;====
In September 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. Here, Two-Face&#x27;s origin is revised significantly. Harvey Dent is a successful defense attorney whose clientele includes twin sisters from the McKillen crime family, Shannon and Erin. The sisters coerce Dent to become their family&#x27;s legal retainer for life. They then place a contract on James Gordon and his entire family, despite Dent&#x27;s protestations. The Gordons survive the attempt on their lives, but Dent, bound by attorney-client confidentiality, is unable to dissuade the McKillens from continuing their lethal vendetta. The violent attempt on the Gordons&#x27; lives prompts Bruce Wayne to initiate and fund Dent&#x27;s campaign for district attorney. Dent becomes D.A. and has the McKillen sisters prosecuted and sentenced to life in prison. After Shannon commits suicide, Erin escapes by switching places with her sister&#x27;s corpse. Blaming Dent for her sister&#x27;s death, Erin breaks into Dent&#x27;s house, kills Gilda in front of him, and pours acid on his face, transforming him into Two-Face. Several years later, Erin McKillen returns to Gotham City to kill Two-Face, and thus reassert her control of her family&#x27;s criminal operations. Her return sparks a climactic battle between her, Two-Face, and Batman. Two-Face scars McKillen with the same acid she used on him, but Batman stops him from killing her. Batman and Two-Face continue battling, with Batman trying to convince his foe to end his vendetta. Two-Face then calls Batman, &quot;Bruce&quot;, revealing that he knows Batman&#x27;s secret identity. Two-Face reveals that he struggled internally for quite some time over whether to kill his former friend, but decided not to because it would have violated his sense of justice. He disappears after the battle and Batman is unable to track him.

Several panels of &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; #28 imply that Two-Face commits suicide by shooting himself in the head.

====&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;====
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. Batman decides to cure Two-Face, doing whatever it takes. Following a confrontation with Two-Face and his henchmen - Killer Moth, Firefly, and Black Spider - Batman takes Two-Face into his custody, until they both have to fight KGBeast. They defeat KGBeast, but are badly injured. Batman nurses Two-Face back to health, but Two-Face suspects Batman of trying to betray him and rubs acid in his eyes. Two-Face and Batman mend their relationship somewhat to fight KGBeast, the Penguin, and Black Mask. Batman tells Two-Face that he can cure Two-Face&#x27;s split personality. Two-Face does not trust Batman to help him, however, and so threatens to destroy Gotham City with poison gas unless Batman gives him the cure. In the end, Batman injects Two-Face with the &quot;cure&quot;, which turns out to be a sedative that renders Two-Face unconscious. Batman then takes Two-Face back to Arkham.

In the &quot;Deface the Face&quot; story arc, Two-Face goes to Batman for help. Harvey Dent had murdered a man whom he could not convict in trial. Two-Face says, &quot;...Harvey&#x27;s the good one. He has to be. Otherwise, what am I?&quot;, and then decides to help Batman and Gordon bring down the terrorist group Kobra. In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Two-Face is among the villains who attend the underground meeting held by the Riddler. In &quot;Harley Quinn: Rebirth&quot;, while Harley Quinn&#x27;s Gang of Harleys is trying to find information about Man-Bat, they encounter Two-Face in Arkham Asylum, where he makes threats towards the group.

==Other characters named Two-Face==
===Wilkins===
The first impostor was Wilkins, Harvey Dent&#x27;s butler who uses makeup to suggest that Dent had suffered a relapse and disfigured his own face. This would give Wilkins the cover to commit crimes as Two-Face.

===Paul Sloane===
Paul Sloane becomes the second impostor of Two-Face. An actor, Sloane is disfigured by an accident on the set of a biography film about Two-Face. This occurred when a prop boy working on the film got jealous at the fact that his girlfriend developed a crush on Sloane. This causes the prop man to switch out the water with actual acid that was to be used for the trial scene. Sloane&#x27;s mind snaps and he begins to think that he is Dent. Sloane recovers some of his own personality, but continues to commit crimes as Two-Face. Batman eventually confronted Sloane and managed to trick the criminal to undergo a reconstructive surgery which would cure his mental illness. Sloane is reused in later Earth-Two specific stories as Two-Face II of Earth-Two where the original Earth-Two Two-Face remains healed.

After the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; event, Paul Sloane, with a near-identical history to the pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; version, appears in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #580-581. In &quot;Double Image&quot;, Harvey Dent (as Two-Face) employs the Crime Doctor to re-disfigure Sloane. Dent does this out of jealous bitterness and the hope that Sloane would commit crimes based on the number two, thus confusing Batman. At the end of the story, Sloane is once again healed physically and mentally.

A new take on the Paul Sloane character is re-introduced into post-&quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot; as a criminal called the Charlatan in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #777 (February 2003). In this incarnation, Sloan is an actor who had been hired by Joker, Penguin, Riddler, Mad Hatter, Scarecrow, and Killer Moth to take Two-Face&#x27;s place in a scheme to kill Batman. They had originally offered Two-Face the part in the scheme, but his coin landed on the non-scarred side. During his impersonation of Two-Face, Batman discovered that this Two-Face was an impostor when he killed a security guard without consulting the coin. When the real Two-Face learns about this, he captures Sloan and disfigures his face. Scarecrow then experiments on Sloan with fear toxins. Driven insane and deprived of fear, Sloan becomes Charlatan where he becomes obsessed with both getting revenge on the criminals who hired him and completing his mission to kill Batman. Charlatan is defeated by Batman and incarcerated at Arkham Asylum.

===George Blake===
The third impostor of Two-Face is petty criminal George Blake who passed himself off as a manager of an anti-crime exhibition. However, he is not actually disfigured, but is wearing make-up. Furthermore, his makeup is worn on the opposite side of his face to Harvey Dent or Paul Sloane, which easily enabled Batman to identify him as an impostor. Batman defeats George Blake and clears Harvey Dent&#x27;s name.

===Batman as Two-Face===
Also noteworthy is a 1968 story where Batman himself is temporarily turned into Two-Face via a potion.

===Two-Face-Two===
In &quot;Batman&quot; #700, which establishes Terry McGinnis as part of the DC Universe canon, it is revealed that Two-Face-Two kidnapped Terry and Carter Nichols, and tried to disfigure them in the style of the Joker. His plans were foiled by Damian Wayne, the fourth Robin and Batman&#x27;s biological son. Unlike the original Two-Face, this version was born deformed and flips two coins instead of one. He is then killed when a machine falls on him. Another Two-Face-Two is briefly mentioned during the course of the &quot;DC One Million&quot; storyline, when the Batman of the 853rd century comments how this villain was defeated when the second Batman convinced him that the law of averages proved his coin-tossing would ultimately cause him to make more &quot;good&quot; decisions than &quot;bad&quot; ones.

<text>Bill Chase (October 20, 1934 – August 9, 1974) was an American trumpeter and leader of the jazz-rock band Chase.

==Biography==
Bill Chase was born William Edward Chiaiese on October 20, 1934, to an Italian-American family in Squantum, Massachusetts. His parents changed their name to Chase because they thought Chiaiese was difficult to pronounce. His father played trumpet in the Gillette Marching Band and encouraged his son&#x27;s musical interests, which included violin and drums. In his mid-teens he settled on trumpet. Chase attended his first Stan Kenton concert, which included trumpeters Conte Candoli and Maynard Ferguson.

After graduating from high school, he studied classical trumpet at the New England Conservatory but switched to the Schillinger House of Music (Berklee College of Music). His instructors included Herb Pomeroy and Armando Ghitalla.

Chase played lead trumpet with Maynard Ferguson in 1958, Stan Kenton in 1959, and Woody Herman&#x27;s Thundering Herd during the 1960s.

One of Chase&#x27;s charts from this period, &quot;Camel Walk&quot;, was published in the 1963 &quot;Downbeat&quot; magazine yearbook. From 1966 to 1970, he freelanced in Las Vegas, working with Vic Damone and Tommy Vig. In 1967 he led a six-piece band at the Dunes and Riviera Hotel where he was featured in the Frederick Apcar lounge production of &quot;Vive Les Girls&quot;, for which Chase arranged the music.

In 1971, he started a jazz rock band named &quot;Chase&quot; that mixed pop, rock, blues, and four trumpets. The debut album &quot;Chase&quot; was released in April 1971. Chase was joined by Ted Piercefield, Alan Ware, and Jerry Van Blair, three jazz trumpeters who were adept at vocals and arranging. They were backed up by a rhythm section consisting of Phil Porter on keyboards, Angel South on guitar, Dennis Johnson on bass, and John &quot;Jay Burrid&quot; Mitthaur on percussion. Rounding out the group was Terry Richards, who was the lead vocalist on the first album. The album contains Chase&#x27;s most popular song, &quot;Get It On&quot;, released as a single that spent 13 weeks on the charts beginning in May 1971. The song features what Jim Szantor of &quot;Downbeat&quot; magazine called &quot;the hallmark of the Chase brass—complex cascading lines; a literal waterfall of trumpet timbre and technique.&quot; The band received a Best New Artist Grammy nomination, but was edged out by rising star Carly Simon.

Chase released their second album, &quot;Ennea&quot;, in March 1972; the album&#x27;s title is the Greek word for nine, a reference to the nine band members. The original lineup changed midway through the recording sessions, with Gary Smith taking over on drums and G. G. Shinn replacing Terry Richards on lead vocals. The third album, &quot;Pure Music&quot;, moved the band toward jazz. Two of the songs were written or co-written by Jim Peterik of the Ides of March, who also sings on the album, along with singer and bassist Dartanyan Brown.

==Plane crash==
Chase&#x27;s work on a fourth studio album in mid-1974 came to an end on August 9, 1974. While en route to a scheduled performance at the Jackson County Fair, Chase died in the crash of a chartered twin-engine Piper Twin Comanche in Jackson, Minnesota, at the age of 39. The pilot and co-pilot were killed, as were keyboardist Wally Yohn, guitarist John Emma, and drummer Walter Clark.

==Methodology==
Chase encouraged long tones as an exercise for developing the embouchure and attributed much of his ability in the upper register of the trumpet to this practice. He was also physically fit. He lifted weights and used stretching routines he learned from female dancers in the Latin Quarter of New York City.

<doc id="477712" wikidata="Q2002710" url="?curid=477712" title="Pullman Company">
<text>The Pullman Company, founded by George Pullman, was a manufacturer of railroad cars in the mid-to-late 19th century through the first half of the 20th century, during the boom of railroads in the United States. Through rapid late-19th century development of mass production and takeover of rivals, the company developed a virtual monopoly on production and ownership of sleeping cars.

During a severe economic downturn, the 1894 Pullman Strike by company workers proved to be a transformative moment in American labor history. At the company&#x27;s peak in the early 20th century, its cars accommodated 26 million people a year, and it in effect operated &quot;the largest hotel in the world&quot;. Its production workers initially lived in a planned worker community, known as a company town, named Pullman, Chicago.

Pullman developed the sleeping car, which carried his name into the 1980s. Pullman did not just manufacture the cars, it also operated them on most of the railroads in the United States, paying railroad companies to couple the cars to trains. In return, by the mid-20th century, these railroads would own Pullman outright. A labor union associated with the company, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, founded and organized by A. Philip Randolph, was one of the most powerful African-American political entities of the 20th century. The company also built thousands of streetcars and trolley buses for use in cities. Post-WWII changes in automobile and airplane transport led to a steep decline in the company&#x27;s fortunes. It collapsed in 1968, with a successor company continuing operations until 1981.

==History==
After spending the night sleeping in his seat on a train trip from Buffalo to Westfield, New York, George Pullman was inspired to design an improved passenger railcar which contained sleeper berths for all its passengers. During the day, the upper berth was folded up overhead similar to a present-day airliner&#x27;s overhead luggage compartment. At night, the upper berth folded down and the 2 facing seats below it folded over to provide a relatively comfortable lower berth. Although this was a somewhat spartan accommodation by today&#x27;s standards, it was a great improvement on the previous layout. Curtains provided privacy, and there were washrooms at each end of the car for men and women. The first Pullman coach was built at the Chicago &amp; Alton shops in Bloomington, Illinois in the spring of 1859 with the permission of Chicago &amp; Alton President Joel A. Matteson.

Pullman established his company in 1862 and built luxury sleeping cars which featured carpeting, draperies, upholstered chairs, libraries, card tables and an unparalleled level of customer service. Patented paper car wheels provided a quieter and smoother ride than conventional cast iron wheels from 1867 to 1915. 

Once a household name due to their large market share, the Pullman Company is also known for the bitter Pullman Strike staged by their workers and union leaders in 1894. During an economic downturn, Pullman reduced hours and wages but not rents, precipitating the strike. Workers joined the American Railway Union, led by Eugene V. Debs.

After George Pullman&#x27;s death in 1897, Robert Todd Lincoln, son of Abraham Lincoln, became the company&#x27;s president.

In 1922, Haskell &amp; Barker Car Manufacturing was acquired and in 1924 was merged with the other car manufacturing units of Pullman, and a new company was formed, Pullman Car &amp; Manufacturing Company. In 1927, Pullman Company was created as a separate company and Pullman Incorporated was established as a holding company. In 1930, Pullman purchased the Standard Steel Car Company conglomerate which included Osgood Bradley, Standard Motor Truck, and Siems-Stembel. In 1934, it was merged with Pullman Car &amp; Manufacturing Company to be known as Pullman-Standard Car Manufacturing Company. 

The company closed its factory in the Pullman neighborhood of Chicago in 1955. The company ceased production after the Amtrak Superliner cars in 1982 and its remaining designs were purchased in 1987 when it was absorbed by Bombardier.

==Corporate history==


The original Pullman Palace Car Co. had been organized on February 22, 1867.

On January 1, 1900, after buying numerous associated and competing companies, it was reorganized as The Pullman Co., characterized by its trademark phrase, &quot;Travel and Sleep in Safety and Comfort.&quot;

In 1924, the Pullman Car &amp; Manufacturing Corporation was organized from the previous Pullman manufacturing department and recently acquired Haskell &amp; Barker Car Company, to consolidate the car building interests of The Pullman Co. The parent company, The Pullman Co. was established as its own company and Pullman, Inc., was formed on June 21, 1927.

The best years for Pullman were the mid-1920s. In 1925, the fleet grew to 9800 cars. Twenty-eight thousand conductors and twelve thousand porters were employed by the Pullman Co. Pullman built its last standard heavyweight sleeping car in February 1931.

Pullman purchased controlling interest in Standard Steel Car Company in 1929, and on December 26, 1934, Pullman Car &amp; Manufacturing, along with several other Pullman, Inc. subsidiaries, merged with Standard Steel Car Co. and its subsidiaries to form the Pullman-Standard Car Manufacturing Company. Pullman-Standard remained in the rail car manufacturing business until 1982. Standard Steel Car Co., had been organized on January 2, 1902, to operate a railroad car manufacturing facility at Butler, Pennsylvania, and, after 1906, a facility at Hammond, Indiana, was reorganized as a subsidiary of Pullman, Inc., on March 1, 1930.

In 1940, just as orders for lightweight cars were increasing and sleeping car traffic was growing, the United States Department of Justice filed an anti-trust complaint against Pullman Incorporated in the U.S. District Court at Philadelphia (Civil Action No. 994). The federal government sought to separate the company&#x27;s sleeping car operations from its manufacturing activities. In 1944, the court concurred, ordering Pullman Incorporated to divest itself of either the Pullman Company (operating) or the Pullman-Standard Car Manufacturing Company (manufacturing). After three years of negotiations, the Pullman Company was sold to a consortium of 57 railroads for approximately US$40 million.

In 1943, Pullman Standard established a shipbuilding division and entered wartime small ship design and construction. The yard was located near Lake Calumet in Chicago, on the north side of 130th Street. Pullman built the boats in 40-ton blocks which were assembled in a fabrication shop on 111th Street and moved to the yard on gondola cars. In two years, the company built 34 Corvette Patrol Craft, Escorts (PCEs), which were 180 feet long and weighed 640 tons, and 44 Landing Ship, Medium (LSMs), which were 203 feet long and weighed 520 tons. Pullman ranked 56th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.

Pullman-Standard built its last sleeping car in 1956 and its last lightweight passenger cars in 1965, an order of ten coaches for Kansas City Southern. The company continued to market and build cars for commuter rail and subway service and Superliners for Amtrak as late as the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Beginning in 1975, Pullman started delivery of the massive 754 stainless steel subway cars to the New York City Transit Authority. Designated R46 by their procurement contract, these cars, along with the R44 subway car built by St. Louis Car Company, were designed for speeds in the Second Avenue Subway. After it was deferred in 1975, the Transit Authority assigned the cars to other subway services. Pullman also built subway cars for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which assigned them to the Red Line. Pullman-Standard was spun off from Pullman, Inc., as Pullman Technology, Inc., in 1981, and was sold to Bombardier in 1987.

===Pullman antitrust case===
In &quot;United States v. Pullman Co.&quot;, 50 F. Supp. 123, 126, 137 (E.D. Pa. 1943), the company was ordered to divest itself of one of its two lines of sleeping car businesses after having acquired all of its competitors.

===The end of Pullman===
After the 1944 breakup, Pullman, Inc., remained in place as the parent company, with the following subsidiaries: The Pullman Company for passenger car operations (but not passenger car ownership, which was passed to member railroads), and Pullman-Standard Car Manufacturing Co., for passenger car and freight car manufacturing; along with a large freight car leasing operation under the parent company&#x27;s control. Pullman, Inc., remained separate until a merger with Wheelabrator, then headed by CEO Michael D. Dingman, in late 1980, which led to the separation of Pullman interests in early and mid-1981.

Operations of the Pullman Company sleeper cars ceased and all leases were terminated on December 31, 1968. On January 1, 1969, the Pullman Company was dissolved and all assets were liquidated. (The most visible result on many railroads, including Union Pacific, was that the Pullman name was removed from the letterboard of all Pullman-owned cars.) An auction of all Pullman remaining assets was held at the Pullman plant in Chicago in early 1970. The Pullman, Inc., company remained in place until 1981 or 1982 to close out all remaining liabilities and claims, operating from an office in Denver.
The passenger car designs of Pullman-Standard were spun off into a separate company called Pullman Technology, Inc., in 1982. Using the Transit America trade name, Pullman Technology continued to market its Comet car design (first built for New Jersey Department of Transportation in 1970) for commuter operations until 1987, when Bombardier purchased Pullman Technology to gain control of its designs and patents. As of late 2004, Pullman Technology, Inc., remained a subsidiary of Bombardier.

Pullman, Inc., spun off its large fleet of leased freight rail cars in April 1981 as Pullman Leasing Company, which later became part of ITEL Leasing, retaining the original PLCX reporting mark. ITEL Rail Leasing (including the PLCX reporting mark) was later divested to GE Rail Services.

In mid-1981, Pullman, Inc., spun off its freight car manufacturing interests as Pullman Transportation Company. Several plants were closed and in 1984, the remaining railcar manufacturing plants and the Pullman-Standard freight car designs and patents were sold to Trinity Industries.

After separating itself from its rail car manufacturing interests, Pullman, Inc., continued as a diversified corporation, with later mergers and acquisitions, including a merger in late 1980 with Wheelabrator-Frye, Inc., in which Pullman became a subsidiary of Wheelabrator-Frye, Inc. In January 1982, Wheelabrator-Frye merged with M. W. Kellogg Company, a builder of large, cast-in-place smokestacks, silos and chimneys. Wheelabrator-Frye retained both Pullman and Kellogg as direct subsidiaries. Later in 1982 Signal acquired Wheelabrator-Frye. In 1990, the entire Wheelabrator-Frye group was sold to Waste Management, Inc. The Pullman-Kellogg interests were spun off by Waste Management as Pullman Power Products Corporation, and by late 2004 that company was doing business as Pullman Power LLC, a subsidiary of Structural Group, a specialty contractor.

As a side note, other construction engineering portions of Pullman-Kellogg were spun off as a new M. W. Kellogg Corporation, and in December 1998, became part of the merger that formed Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root, a specialty contractor which itself was later sold to Halliburton, an oil well servicing company. In an eventual competitive move, other Kellogg engineering interests were merged with Rust Engineering becoming Kellogg Rust, which itself became The Henley Group, and later Rust International before it became the Rust Division of what is today Washington Group International, a specialty contracting firm that competes directly with Halliburton worldwide. Washington Group International is the successor to the Morrison Knudsen civil engineering and contracting corporation, and is also the owner of Montana Rail Link.

After the last of the Kellogg interests of Pullman-Kellogg were spun off, and after the railcar manufacturing plants were sold, and with the formal dissolution of the old Pullman Company (the operating company from the 1944 split), the remaining portions of the Pullman interests were spun off in May 1985 by Signal into a new Pullman Company. In November 1985, Pullman bought Peabody International and the new company took the new name of Pullman Peabody. In April 1987 (after Pullman Technology was sold to Bombardier), the name was changed back to Pullman Company. In July 1987 the company acquired Clevite Industries. By 1996, Pullman Co., with its Clevite subsidiary, was almost solely a supplier of automotive elastomer (rubber) parts, and in July 1996 the company was sold to Tenneco. As of late 2004, Pullman Co. (now the brand name Clevite), as a manufacturer of automotive elastomer products, was still under the control of Tenneco Automotive.

==Company town==
In 1877, the United States experienced the Great Railroad Strike. Part of its legacy included more powerful unions and a tendency for employers to consider the broader well-being of their employees. Pullman&#x27;s objective in building a company town was to attract a superior type of employee and further elevate these individuals by excluding baneful influences. In late April 1880, George Pullman announced his plans to build a company town and factory. Pullman&#x27;s plan included an expectation that rent collected on the houses in the town would produce a 6% return on investment (ROI), but the ROI never exceeded 4–%.

The company built Pullman, Illinois on , south of Chicago, contracting Solon Spencer Beman for design and Nathan F. Barrett for landscaping. Both were considered experts in their respective fields. Beman interned under architect Richard Upjohn. Barrett landscaped areas in Staten Island and Tuxedo, New York, as well as Long Branch, New Jersey. George Pullman&#x27;s governing concept placed the town not within the city limits of Chicago but in the adjoining town of Hyde Park. On April 24, 1880, groundwork began. Throughout construction, Pullman sought to minimize costs and maximize efficiency adopting techniques of mass production whenever possible. Some of the earliest departments and shops created included painting, iron, and woodworking. These could then be employed to contribute to continuing construction. By January 1, 1881, the town was ready for its first resident. A foreman from the Pullman Company&#x27;s Detroit shop, Lee Benson, moved his wife, child, and sister into the town. 

Building exteriors were red brick with limestone trim. Interiors featured high ceilings and large windows. Interior walls were purposefully painted in light colors to provide a cheerful environment. When completed, the town included a library, theater, hotel, church, market, sewage farm, park, and many residential buildings. The bar in the Florence Hotel was the only place within the town limits where alcohol could be served and consumed. In the residential section, were dedicated to tenements, flats and single-family homes with rents from $0.50 to $0.75 per month ($ to $ in adjusted for inflation). The residences featured modern conveniences such as gas, running water, indoor sewage plumbing and regular garbage removal. By 1884, there were more than 1,400 tenements and flats. By July of the following year, the population exceeded 8,600.

In charge of the company town was the town agent who was responsible for all services and businesses including street and building maintenance, gas and water works, fire protection, the hotel, sewage farm, and the nursery and greenhouse. Reporting to the town agent were nine department heads and approximately 300 men. There were no elections except for the school board, as all officials were selected by Pullman.

After its completion, the Pullman company town attracted national attention. Many critics praised Pullman&#x27;s concept and planning. One newspaper article titled &quot;The Arcadian City: Pullman, the Ideal City of the World&quot; praised the town as &quot;the youngest and most perfect city in the world, Pullman; beautiful in every belonging.&quot; In February 1885, Harper&#x27;s Monthly published and article by Richard T. Ely entitled &quot;Pullman: A Social Study&quot;. Though the article offered praise for creating an elevated environment for its workers, it criticized the all-encompassing influence of the company ultimately concluding that &quot;Pullman is un-American&quot; and &quot;benevolent, well-wishing feudalism.&quot;

During the Panic of 1893, Pullman closed his manufacturing plant in Detroit to move all manufacturing to Pullman. Due to the soft economic conditions of this period, the Pullman Co. reduced wages and laid off employees. Though wages were reduced, residential utility rates and rents remained unchanged. On May 11, 1894, the employees of the Pullman Co. walked off the job initiating the Pullman Strike. Thirty people were killed as a result of the strikes and sabotage. The loss of pride after the strike stayed with the town long afterward.

In February 1904, the Pullman Company was given a court order to sell the company town but delayed compliance until 1907. Today, Pullman is a Chicago neighborhood, and a historical landmark district on the state, National Historic Landmark and National Register of Historic Places lists.

In 2014, the National Park Service initially considered the concept of turning Pullman into a new, urban National Park.
On February 19, 2015, Pullman&#x27;s company town was established as a National Monument by President Barack Obama.

==Other Pullman sites==
The Pullman Company operated several facilities in other areas of the US. One of these was the Pullman Shops in Richmond, California, which was linked to the mainline tracks of both the Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe, servicing their passenger equipment from throughout the Western US. The main building of the Richmond Pullman Shops still exists, as does the thoroughfare it is located on: Pullman Avenue. Another site was Pullman Car &amp; Manufacturing Corp. of Bessemer, Alabama, incorporated on January 15, 1929.
==Porters==
The Pullman Company was also noted for its porters. The porters served first-class passengers traveling in the luxurious Pullman sleeping cars.

When George Pullman began hiring porters in 1868, he sought people who had been trained to be the perfect servants. This led the company to hire black men (many, if not all, of whom were newly freed chattel slaves) almost exclusively for the porter positions. This decision by Pullman wasn&#x27;t one of altruism but one primarily driven by economics: Pullman paid the black porters a pittance, forcing them to rely on tips from their white clientele for most of their earnings. This allowed the company to increase profits by minimizing the wages paid to one of its most important, and numerous, positions.

Being a Pullman Porter was seen as safe, steady work and allowed tens of thousands of African-Americans access to middle-class life. This had little to do with the wages being paid to them by Pullman, and more to do with the reliable income stream.

Former slaves working in a servile position were treated harshly, and were frequently subject to verbal and physical abuse. In 1925, after decades of discrimination and mistreatment by the passengers and the Pullman company itself, the porters organized and became the first African-American labor union. Founded by A. Philip Randolph the porters formed the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP), which after years of effort, fought for and won a collective bargaining agreement in 1937. At its height the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters had a membership of over 18,000 passenger railway workers across Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

The legacy of Pullman porters goes beyond the railway. A. Philip Randolph took the lessons learned and experience gained in organizing the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters to help organize the nascent black civil rights movement. Likewise, E.D. Nixon, a Pullman porter and leader of a local chapter of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, worked with one of his employees to help start the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott in Alabama, using Rosa Parks&#x27; arrest as a catalyst and rallying cry to help organize it. Nixon, whose duties as a porter often saw him out of town for various lengths of time, had to enlist the help of a young, energetic black minister new to Montgomery to run the boycott in his absence: the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.

==Products==

===Rail vehicles===

Pullman&#x27;s streetcar building period lasted from 1891 until 1951. The company one was one of just three builders (and one of only two in the U.S.) of the PCC streetcar, a standardized type of streetcar purchased by numerous North American transit systems between 1936 and 1952 and nearly 5,000 of which were constructed. Pullman built the body of the very first all-new PCC car, a prototype called &quot;model B&quot;, in 1934, but the first production-series Pullman PCC cars were not built until 1938 (and delivered in early 1939). The St. Louis Car Company captured about 75% of the U.S. market for PCC cars, with the balance of around 25% being supplied by Pullman.

===Trolley buses===
In addition to rail vehicles, Pullman-Standard also manufactured trolley buses – or &quot;trolley coaches&quot;, as they were more commonly known at the time – starting in 1931 and concluding in late 1952. A total of 2,007 trolley buses were built by the company. Production took place at a former Osgood Bradley Car Company plant in Worcester, Massachusetts, which had come under Pullman control as part of its 1929/30 acquisition of a controlling interest in the Standard Steel Car Company. The vast majority were built for U.S. cities, with only 24 being supplied to Canadian cities and a total of 136 built for cities in South America. The last trolleybuses built were an order of 30 for Valparaíso, Chile, in late 1952. That city&#x27;s Pullman trolley buses have far outlasted any others, and as of 2015 about a dozen were still in regular service there, four from the 1952 batch and the others from a larger group built in 1946–48 but partially rebuilt in 1987–88. In 2003, the remaining 15 were declared a National Historic Monument by the Chilean government.

<text>Antiloop were a Swedish electronic dance music duo, formed in Lidingö in 1994 by David Westerlund and Robin Söderman. They won two Swedish Grammis Awards and six Swedish Dance Music Awards.

==Biography==
=== Early career (1974–1994) ===
Robin Staffan Mark Söderman (born 22 January 1974) and David Olof Westerlund (born 8 July 1977) both grew up in Lidingö in Stockholm, Sweden. Robin&#x27;s father and uncle were musicians and helped grow his interest. . David started playing the synth at an age of four and later played in a big band jazz at youth age. Söderman started a band and invited his childhood friend Westerlund, along with some other that he knew. The other members left the band and it was only Westerlund and Söderman left. They began to play in nightclubs as DJs and eventually decided to make their own music.

=== Antiloop (1994–2002) ===
Antiloop was formed in 1994. The name comes both from the animal antelope, which in Swedish is spelled: &quot;Antilop&quot;, and the music element loop.

A third member, the dancer Maxim, was also member of the band, but he left early.

Antiloop debuted in 1995 with the EP: &quot;N.S.F.M.C (Not Suitable For Mass Consumption)&quot;. In 1997, they released their debut album &quot;LP&quot;. Five singles were released from the album, which all peaked at under 45 in the Swedish chart. A year later they released the remix album &quot;Remixed&quot;, including the single &quot;Believe&quot;. Antiloop released their second and final studio album in 2000, &quot;Fastlane People&quot;. The song &quot;Catch Me&quot; on the album features the Swedish rapper Timbuktu on vocals. The songs &quot;Only U&quot; and &quot;Let Your Body Free&quot; appear in the film &quot;Lilja 4-ever&quot; (2002) by Lukas Moodysson. In 2002 they released a compilation album titled &quot;At The Rebel&#x27;s Room&quot; that includes two discs; one containing their most popular songs, and another made of remixes of their songs by other artists. Antiloop produced several remixes for the Scandinavian group Aqua, including one for the Doctor Jones CD single. They have released songs and remixes under the aliases &quot;Face&quot; and &quot;The Buckwheat Rebels&quot;.

Antiloop disbanded in 2002 with their website eventually expiring shortly after. In 2005, David Westerlund began producing music by himself under the name &quot;David West&quot;.

<text>The University of Buenos Aires (, UBA) is a public research university in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was established in 1821. It has educated 17 Argentine presidents, produced four of the country&#x27;s five Nobel Prize laureates, and is responsible for approximately 40% of the country&#x27;s research output. 

The university&#x27;s academic strength and regional leadership make it attractive to many international students, especially at the postgraduate level. Just over 4 percent of undergraduates are foreigners, while 15 percent of postgraduate students come from abroad. The Faculty of Economic Sciences has the highest rate of international postgraduate students at 30 percent, in line with its reputation as a &quot;top business school with significant international influence.&quot;

The University of Buenos Aires enrolls more than 328,000 students and is organized into 13 independent faculties. It administers 6 hospitals, 16 museums, 13 scientific institutes, interdisciplinary commissions, 5 high schools, the Ricardo Rojas Cultural Center, the Cosmos Cinema, the University of Buenos Aires Symphony Orchestra, and Eudeba (&quot;Editorial Universitaria de Buenos Aires&quot;), the country&#x27;s largest university press.

Undergraduate programs at the University of Buenos Aires are free of charge for everyone, regardless of nationality. Tuition from postgraduate programs helps fund the UBA&#x27;s social mission to provide free university education for all.

==History==
===Early years===
Unlike other major cities in the Spanish Colonial Americas, Buenos Aires did not count with a university of its own during colonial times. The Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata was relatively less important compared to other regions in Spanish South America, as most economic activity was based around the Andes range. Cultural and educational work in Buenos Aires was carried out by members of the Company of Jesus, and within the viceroyalty, Córdoba, Chuquisaca, and Santiago de Chile already counted with universities.
Following the May Revolution in 1810 and Argentina&#x27;s Declaration of Independence in 1816, the push for a university in the capital of the newly independent nation strengthened. On 12 August 1821, the University of Buenos Aires was officially founded through a decree by Governor Martín Rodríguez. At the university&#x27;s inaugural act, the cleric and statesman Antonio Sáenz was appointed as the first Rector.

During the university&#x27;s early years of existence, the conflict between proponents of a laicist approach to the university&#x27;s education and defendants of the traditional religious approach divided students and professors alike. From the start, existing institutions were merged into the university in order to guarantee a high level of professionalism and organization: courses on mathematics, drawing, nautic sciences and natural history were transferred from the Consulate of Buenos Aires, the Military Medical Institute and the Colegio de la Unión del Sud. In addition, law professors and courses were incorporated from the Academia de Jurisprudencia. This allowed the university to begin imparting medicine and law degrees from the moment of its foundation.

===Developments in the mid-19th century===
Free access to the university was suspended during the rule of &quot;caudillo&quot; Juan Manuel de Rosas, and the number of students decreased considerably. Budget cuts imposed by Rosas&#x27;s government meant professors were no longer being paid, and the Department of Exact Sciences was nearly forced to close down. During this period, Francisco Javier Muñiz began making the first strides in the field of paleontology in Argentina, and became dean of the Faculty of Medicine. The situation normalized following the fall of Rosas at the Battle of Caseros in 1852. The new government of the State of Buenos Aires made bettering the university&#x27;s conditions a priority; the political elites began seeing higher education as a necessary part of the country&#x27;s upcoming consolidation and stabilization stages.
In 1863, the university established the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires; the Escuela Superior de Comercio followed in 1890. In 1869, the first twelve Argentine engineers graduated from the University of Buenos Aires; they would henceforth be known as the &quot;Twelve Apostles&quot;. Among them was Valentín Balbín, who would become president of the Sociedad Científica Argentina. In 1891, the department of natural sciences took the name of Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Físicas y Naturales, and, in 1896, a special doctorate for chemistry was also established. By 1909, UBA had also created the faculties of Agronomy and Veterinary Sciences, as well as the Instituto de Altos Estudios Comerciales y de Ciencias Económicas.

The federalization of Buenos Aires in 1881 made the university dependent of the Argentine national state. During the Generation of &#x27;80, a period marked by the conservative elitism of Argentina&#x27;s political class, the University of Buenos Aires made great progress in its scientific research, as the governing elites followed the ideals of positivism and scientificism popular in the late 19th century. The 1880s were also marked by the university&#x27;s first women graduates, Élida Passo (pharmacy) and Cecilia Grierson (medicine). These were, however, still exceptions to the rule in an otherwise male-dominated environment, as it fit the customs of Argentine society at the time.

===University Reform of 1918===
The newfound prosperity experienced by Argentina at the turn of the 20th century allowed the children of (primarily European) immigrants, the new Argentine middle class, to attend university for the first time. In June 1918, a political and cultural movement impulsed by students at the National University of Córdoba caused a shockwave across Latin America: students were now protesting for further autonomy in universities, democratically elected authorities and co-governance, and open contests for teaching positions. The reform set up the freedom for universities to define their own curriculum and manage their own budget without interference from the central government. This has had a profound effect on academic life at the universities through the nationalization process that boasts academic freedom and independence throughout university life.

The University Reform granted UBA (as well as all other public universities in Argentina) one of the key features of its institutional life, maintained up to this day: co-governed, democratically elected institutions and authorities.

In 1923, Ernesto de la Cárcova, a fine arts painter and academic professor, created the Extension Department of Fine Arts Education, known as the Superior Art School of the Nation in Spanish &quot;Escuela Nacional Superior de las Artes&quot;, previously guilded in 1905 as the National Academy of Fine Arts in 1905, taking its long origins from the 1875 founding of the National Society of the Stimulus of the Arts by painters Eduardo Schiaffino, Eduardo Sívori, and others. Since 1993, this Arts Extension Department became an independent institution known as IUNA Instituto Universitario Nacional de las Artes, then, in 2014 became the Collegiate University UNA Universidad Nacional de las Artes.

===1940s–1960s===
The university&#x27;s co-governance and autonomy were suspended during the presidency of Juan Domingo Perón, beginning in 1946. Perón&#x27;s government also made access to public universities completely free of cost, through Decree 29.337, in November 1949. This represented the beginning of unrestricted access to culture, higher education and professionalization for the working class. From 1935 to 1955, the number of students enrolled at UBA grew from 12,000 to 71,823.

The 1940s also saw the creation of the Faculty of Dentistry and the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism, both through laws passed through the National Congress.
The 1955 &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot; re-established the university&#x27;s autonomy and co-governance, but also persecuted peronists and leftists within the university, leading to the expulsion and exile of hundreds of professors. Blacklists for university professors were established, and UBA was among the most affected institutions. Further repression and persecution followed during the dictatorship of Juan Carlos Onganía, which intervened all universities and applied censorship to much of the universities&#x27; contents. On 29 July 1966, following a student-led occupation of five of UBA&#x27;s faculties, state authorities dislodged the legitimately-elected authorities of said faculties and violently removed students, graduates and professors from the premises. The students were protesting the 1966 coup d&#x27;état, which had deposed constitutional president Arturo Illia. The event would be known as the Night of the Long Batons ().

The Night of the Long Batons ended with over 400 people detained, and several laboratories and libraries destroyed by state authorities. In the months that followed, hundreds of professors were fired or forced to leave their positions. Many went into exile: in total, it is estimated 301 professors, of which 215 were researchers, left Argentina following the events of 29 July 1966.

===1970s===
The return of Juan Domingo Perón to power through democratic elections in 1973 marked the beginning of a new age for the University of Buenos Aires. In 1974, a new law (Ley 20.654) mandated all national and public universities&#x27; right to academic autonomy and administrative and economy autarky. In contradiction with the university autonomy law, Perón&#x27;s wife and successor, Isabel Perón, appointed professed fascist Alberto Ottalagano as interventor of the university in 1974. Ottalagano launched a fierce campaign of persecution within the university, targeting students and professors suspected of being sympathizers of the Peronist Left. During Ottalagano&#x27;s administration, up to 4000 professors were fired (including Nobel in Chemistry laureate Luis Federico Leloir), and four students were disappeared by the State.

An enhanced period of state terrorism followed the 1976 coup d&#x27;état, which brought to power the dictatorship of the National Reorganization Process. Professors and students were disappeared regardless of their political affiliations, as public universities were suspected of being &quot;breeding grounds&quot; for leftist sympathizers and subversives. In addition, the university&#x27;s research production and curricula were subject to systemic censorship, and hundreds upon thousands of books were burned (including up to 90,000 books published by Eudeba, UBA&#x27;s own university press). The dictatorship overran the principles of co-governance and established entrance exams, diminished entrance quotas, eradicated free education, and suspended entire degrees. All of the university&#x27;s buildings and establishments were put under surveillance by state security forces.

===1980s to the present day===
The university&#x27;s autonomy and co-governance were re-established with the return of democracy in 1983. In 1985, the university established the &quot;Ciclo Básico Común&quot; (CBC; &quot;Common Basic Cycle&quot;), a fixed set of subjects that all aspiring UBA students must approve in order to become enrolled at the university. The CBC replaced the old entrance exams and sought to even the playing field for all students. That same year, the Faculty of Psychology was established, becoming the 12th faculty of the university.

In addition, in 1985 an agreement was signed between the university and the Federal Penitentiary System, creating what would later become the UBA XXII system. UBA XXII allows all people detained at federal prisons to enroll at UBA and study graduate courses whilst deprived of freedom. In 1988, the Faculty of Social Sciences was established, becoming the youngest faculty at UBA.

==Organization==

The University of Buenos Aires is made up of thirteen self-governing faculties (), which impart a number of graduate and post-graduate courses (). Although not a faculty, the university also manages the &quot;Ciclo Básico Común&quot; (CBC, &quot;Common Basic Cycle&quot;), a fixed set of subjects that all aspiring UBA students must pass in order to access any graduate course in the university, and that replaced entrance exams in 1985.

UBA does not count with a single, unified campus. All of its facilities are spread out throughout the City of Buenos Aires, with some (especially branches of the CBC) based in the Greater Buenos Aires metro area. The &quot;Ciudad Universitaria&quot; (&quot;University City&quot;) complex, located in the Núñez neighborhood along the banks of the Río de la Plata, is the closest thing to a centralized campus UBA has, housing the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences, the Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urbanism, a CBC branch, and various research institutes.

The faculties are:
The Faculty of Economic Sciences is the largest of the UBA&#x27;s constituent colleges, with over 36,000 students. In recent years, the Faculty of Medicine has attracted the most new students, with 17,004 new enrollees in 2018 compared to the 7,584 new students the Faculty of Economic Sciences added that same year.

In addition to the thirteen faculties, the university administers 6 hospitals, 16 museums, 13 scientific institutes, 6 interdisciplinary commissions, 5 high schools (Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires, Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini, Instituto Libre de Segunda Enseñanza, Escuela Agropecuaria y Agroalimentaria, and Escuela de Educación Técnica de Villa Lugano), the Centro Cultural Ricardo Rojas, the Cosmos Cinema, the University of Buenos Aires Symphony Orchestra, and Eudeba (&quot;Editorial Universitaria de Buenos Aires&quot;), Argentina&#x27;s largest university press.

===Administration and governance===

Since the 1918 University Reform, the University of Buenos Aires has been ruled by the principle of co-governance. The university is headed by the Rector and the &quot;Consejo Superior&quot; (&quot;Superior Council&quot;). The Consejo Superior is made up of the rector, the deans of the thirteen faculties, and five representatives for each of the three constituent bodies in the university: professors, students and graduates, rounding up to 29 members. Deans and all other representatives of the Consejo Superior are elected every four years in democratic elections in which all professors, students and graduates of the university must partake.

Each of the thirteen faculties is autonomous and self-governed. The faculties have a similar governing system: each of them has a democratically elected dean and a &quot;Consejo Directivo&quot; (&quot;Directive Council&quot;). The faculties&#x27; directive councils are made up of eight representatives for the professors, four representatives for the student body, and four representatives for the graduates. The Rector is elected every four years by the University Assembly (&quot;Asamblea Universitaria&quot;), made up of all members of the Consejo Superior and all members of the directive councils of all thirteen faculties. Since 2022, the Rector of the University of Buenos Aires has been Ricardo Gelpi.

In addition to the Consejo Superior and directive councils, students in all thirteen faculties count with student unions (&quot;Centro de Estudiantes&quot;), which are also democratically elected by students and are organized into the &quot;Federación Universitaria de Buenos Aires&quot; (FUBA). The FUBA is part of the Argentine University Federation.

In the 21st century, diverse political forces have vyed for power across all of these democratically elected institutions. Historically, rectors have belonged to the &quot;reformist&quot; camp, closely related to the Radical Civic Union and its student wing, &quot;Franja Morada&quot;. Peronists and supporters of the Trotskyist left, organized into several different groups and organizations within each of the faculties, have also historically participated in the university&#x27;s political life.

== Rankings and reputation ==
The QS World University Rankings ranked the University of Buenos Aires as 66th in the world in 2021. THE&#x27;s World Reputation Rankings 2020 placed it in the 176–200 range, whereas it is not listed in the performance-based THE World University Rankings.

== Notable alumni ==
Throughout its history, a sizeable number of UBA alumni have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise. Among them are four of Argentina&#x27;s five Nobel Prize laureates, seventeen presidents of Argentina, and several other notable individuals in various fields, including sciences, business, literature, philosophy, law, medicine, the arts, architecture, and others. Many more are further associated to the university as faculty or through research at UBA institutes and dependencies.

===Politics===
Seventeen Argentine presidents have attended the University of Buenos Aires: Carlos Pellegrini, Luis Sáenz Peña, José Evaristo Uriburu, Manuel Quintana, Roque Sáenz Peña, Victorino de la Plaza, Hipólito Yrigoyen, Marcelo T. de Alvear, Agustín P. Justo, Roberto Ortiz, Ramón Castillo, Arturo Frondizi, Arturo Illia, Raúl Alfonsín, Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, Eduardo Duhalde, and Alberto Fernández. All of them, save for Justo, an engineer, and Illia, a physician, were educated at the Faculty of Law. Manuel Quintana also served as rector of the university, while Alberto Fernández taught courses on criminal law at the graduate level for many years before being elected to the presidency.

Many political leaders and relevant figures have also been educated at UBA, such as the Marxist revolutionary Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara, who enrolled at the Faculty of Medicine in 1948. Several government ministers of Argentina have received their degrees at UBA, such as the foreign ministers José Luis Murature, Ángel Gallardo (also a Rector of UBA), Bonifacio del Carril, Miguel Ángel Zavala Ortiz, Juan Atilio Bramuglia, Susana Ruiz Cerutti, Guido di Tella, Adalberto Rodríguez Giavarini, Carlos Ruckauf, and Santiago Cafiero. Economy ministers of diverse political views and pertaining to different economic schools of thought have also earned their degrees at UBA; among them José Martínez de Hoz, Roberto Lavagna, Axel Kicillof, and Nicolás Dujovne.

José Pedro Montero, the 27th president of Paraguay, was educated at UBA.

===Law===
A number of relevant jurists have earned their law degrees at the UBA Faculty of Law. Carlos Saavedra Lamas, noted academic and jurist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate in 1936, earned his law degree at UBA and served as rector of the university from 1941 to 1943. Luis Moreno Ocampo, Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, earned his degree in 1978. International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda judge Inés Mónica Weinberg de Roca is also a UBA alumna and former faculty, having taught courses on International Private Law since 2001. Several ministers of the Supreme Court of Argentina have been UBA alumni as well, such as Enrique S. Petracchi, Carlos Fayt, Carmen Argibay, Elena Highton de Nolasco, and Carlos Rosenkrantz. Mariela Belski, Executive Director of Amnesty International Argentina is also a UBA alumni. Prominent legal philosopher Eugenio Bulygin earned his law degree and his PhD at the UBA Faculty of Law, where he also taught throughout his career. Teodosio César Brea, founder of the prominent Allende &amp; Brea law firm, graduated UBA and taught courses at the Faculty of Law as well. Valeria Vegh Weis, criminologist, criminal attorney, and university professor, was also educated at UBA.

===Medicine===

The University of Buenos Aires has produced several relevant figures in the field of medicine. Two Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine laureates have been educated at UBA: Bernardo Houssay (1947) and César Milstein (1984). Houssay&#x27;s work was carried out at the UBA-affiliated Instituto de Biología y Medicina Experimental, while Milstein received degree from the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences.

Élida Passo (1867–1893), the first Argentine woman to be a pharmacist and South American woman university graduate, earned her UBA degree in 1885. The first woman to receive a medical degree in Argentina, Cecilia Grierson, did so at the UBA Faculty of Medicine in 1889. Other prominent physicians educated at UBA include public sanitarist Ramón Carrillo, Teresa Ratto, surgeon Juan Rosai, Luis Agote, dentist Ricardo Guardo (credited as the founder of the UBA Faculty of Dentistry), geneticist Primarosa Chieri, and pharmacologist Augusto Claudio Cuello, professor at McGill University in Canada.

===Business===
Prominent businesspeople educated at the University of Buenos Aires include oil tycoon Alejandro Bulgheroni, and his brother, Bridas Corporation CEO Carlos Bulgheroni; agri-business executive Andrea Grobocopatel, and sugar magnate Robustiano Patrón Costas. The university has also produced many successful startup founders. Unicorn startups founded by the University of Buenos Aires&#x27;s alumni raised the most money in venture capital funding in the Latin American region in 2020.

Engineer and manufacturer Horacio Anasagasti, who created the first Argentine-produced car (the &quot;Anasagasti&quot;), graduated from the UBA Faculty of Engineering aged 23 in 1902.

===Mathematics and science===

A number of prominent scientists in diverse fields have been educated at the University of Buenos Aires; many of them have also taught classes and have conducted research at UBA. Luis Federico Leloir, Argentina&#x27;s first Nobel Prize in Chemistry laureate for his discovery of the metabolic pathways in lactose, earned his degree at the Faculty of Medicine in 1932, and attended classes at the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences early into his career as well. In the field of chemistry, UBA also educated Silvia Braslavsky, who worked extensively in the domain of photobiology and was senior research scientist and professor at the Max Planck Institute for Radiation Chemistry.

UBA has also produced a number of prominent biologists, especially in the field of Antarctic marine biology. Among these are Irene Schloss and Viviana Alder. Patricia Ortúzar, geographist and vice chair of the Antarctic Committee for Environmental Protection, also received her degree from the University of Buenos Aires. Neuroscientist, Turing Fellow and Cambridge University lecturer Tristan Bekinschtein is a FCEN UBA graduate.

Mathematicians educated at UBA include Graciela Boente, researcher of robust statistics; Alberto Calderón, co-creator of the &quot;Chicago School of (hard) Analysis&quot;; Luis Caffarelli, whose work focuses on partial differential equations; Alicia Dickenstein, known for her work on toric geometry, tropical geometry, and their applications to biological systems; Miguel Walsh, known for his work in number theory and ergodic theory.

Other prominent UBA scientists include pioneering computer scientist Cecilia Berdichevsky, ecologist Enrique Chaneton, molecular biologist Alberto Kornblihtt, physicist Beatriz Susana Cougnet de Roederer, biologist María Fernanda Ceriani, solar physicist and former CONICET president, Marta Graciela Rovira, and Emma Pérez Ferreira, first female president of Argentina&#x27;s National Atomic Energy Commission.

===Philosophy and social sciences===

UBA has produced a number of important thinkers and researchers in the fields of social science and philosophy. Raúl Prebisch, creator of the Prebisch–Singer hypothesis and a major proponent of dependency theory, studied economy at the Faculty of Economic Sciences. Social anthropologist Esther Hermitte, credited with introducing structural-functionalist anthropology in Argentina, was a Faculty of Philosophy and Letters alumna, as was post-marxist theorist Ernesto Laclau.

Political scientist Guillermo O&#x27;Donnell studied law at UBA and later pursued a political science degree in the United States; today, he is credited as a major influence in Argentine political science. Sociologist and political activist Pilar Calveiro began her studies at the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters, before the creation of the Faculty of Social Sciences in 1988. Former British spy Richard Tomlinson studied political science at UBA during his stay in Argentina.

In the field of psychoanalysis, Faculty of Psychology alumna Alicia Beatriz Casullo is known for being the founder and first head of the &quot;Sociedad Argentina de Psicoanálisis&quot;.

===Architecture===
The University of Buenos Aires has produced a number of prominent architects, renown both nationwide and internationally. Clorindo Testa, pioneer of the brutalist movement in Argentina, earned his degree at the Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urbanism (FADU) in 1948. The rationalist Alberto Prebisch earned his degree at the School of Architecture (predecessor of FADU) in 1921; he would later become dean of FADU in 1955. New York-based urban design theorist Diana Agrest graduated from FADU in 1967. Other known UBA-educated architects include Claudio Vekstein, organic architecture proponent Patricio Pouchulu, and the Uruguayan Rafael Viñoly, who designed the &quot;Cero+infinito&quot; building at the Ciudad Universitaria complex, finished in 2022.

===Arts, literature and film===

Writers associated with UBA include the novelist and short story writer Julio Cortázar, one of the founders of the Latin American Boom. Cortázar began a philosophy degree aged 18, but did not complete it due to financial woes. The poet and critic Jorge Fondebrider studied literature at the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters, and later served as director of the UBA-owned Centro Cultural Ricardo Rojas. &quot;The Manipulated Man&quot; author Esther Vilar, and the poet and translator Alejandra Pizarnik, were also educated at UBA.

After receiving a degree in Natural Sciences from the university, Alicia Jurado wrote biographies of William Henry Hudson, Cunninghame Graham, and Jorge Luis Borges. The short story writer Samanta Schweblin studied film design at UBA. Elena Presser also began her studies at the University of Buenos Aires, as did film director Juan Cabral.

==Media==
The university operates its own radio station, &quot;Radio Universidad de Buenos Aires&quot;, broadcast on the FM 87.9 MHz frequency. Its content is mostly oriented toward academic and social topics. Launched on 20 December 2005 after being authorized by AFSCA, its motto is &quot;El saber está en el aire&quot; (&quot;Knowledge is in the air&quot;).

<text>The proboscis monkey or long-nosed monkey (Nasalis larvatus) is an arboreal Old World monkey with an unusually large nose (or proboscis), a reddish-brown skin color and a long tail. It is endemic to the southeast Asian island of Borneo and is found mostly in mangrove forests and on the coastal areas of the island.

This species co-exists with the Bornean orangutan and monkeys such as the silvery lutung. It belongs in the monotypic genus Nasalis.

== Taxonomy ==
The proboscis monkey belongs to the subfamily Colobinae of the Old World monkeys. The two subspecies are:
*&quot;N. l. larvatus&quot; (Wurmb, 1787), which occupies the whole range of the species excluding northeast Kalimantan
*&quot;N. l. orientalis&quot; (Chasen, 1940), restricted to north-east Kalimantan
However, the difference between the subspecies is small, and not all authorities recognise &quot;N. l. orientalis&quot;.

The genus name &quot;Nasalis&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;nasus&quot; meaning &quot;nose&quot;.

This animal was made known to Westerners by Baron Friedrich von Wurmb in 1781, he later sent specimens of it to Stamford Raffles in Europe.

==Description==
The proboscis monkey is a large species, being one of the largest monkey species native to Asia. Only the Tibetan macaque and a few of the gray langurs can rival its size.

Sexual dimorphism is pronounced in the species. Males have a head-body length of and typically weigh , with a maximum known weight of . Females measure in head-and-body length and weigh , with a maximum known mass of . The male has a red penis with a black scrotum.

The proboscis monkey has a long coat; the fur on the back is bright orange, reddish brown, yellowish brown or brick-red. The underfur is light-grey, yellowish, or greyish to light-orange. Infants are born with a blue coloured face that at 2.5 months darkens to grey. By 8.5 months of age, the face has become cream coloured like the adults. Both sexes have bulging stomachs that give the monkeys what resembles a pot belly. Many of the monkeys&#x27; toes are webbed.

=== Nose ===

Further adding to the dimorphism is the large nose or proboscis of the male, which can exceed in length, and hangs lower than the mouth. Theories for the extensive length of their nose suggest it may be sexual selection by the females, who prefer louder vocalisations, with the size of the nose increasing the volume of the call.

The nose is smaller in the female and is upturned in the young. Nevertheless, the nose of the female is still fairly large for a primate. The skull of the proboscis monkey has specialized nasal cartilages that support the large nose.

==Distribution and habitat==

The proboscis monkey is endemic to the island of Borneo and can be found in all three nations that divide the island: Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia. It is most common in coastal areas and along rivers. This species is restricted to lowland habitats that may experience tides. It favors dipterocarp, mangrove and riverine forests. It can also be found in swamp forests, stunted swamp forests, rubber forests, rubber plantations, limestone hill forests, nypa swamps, nibong swamps, and tall swamp forests, tropical heath forests and steep cliffs. This species usually stays within at least a kilometer from a water source. It is perhaps the most aquatic of the primates and is a fairly good swimmer, capable of swimming up to underwater. It is known to swim across rivers. Aside from this, the proboscis monkey is largely arboreal and moves quadrupedally and by leaps. It is known to jump off branches and descend into water.

==Behavior and ecology==
===Social behavior===
Proboscis monkeys generally live in groups composed of one adult male, some adult females and their offspring. All-male groups may also exist. Some individuals are solitary, mostly males. Monkey groups live in overlapping home ranges, with little territoriality, in a fission-fusion society, with groups gathering at sleeping sites as night falls. There exist bands which arise when groups come together and slip apart yet sometimes groups may join to mate and groom. Groups gather during the day and travel together, but individuals only groom and play with those in their own group. One-male groups consist of 3 to 19 individuals, while bands can consist of as many as 60 individuals. Serious aggression is uncommon among the monkeys but minor aggression does occur. Overall, members of the same bands are fairly tolerant of each other. A linear dominance hierarchy exists between females. Males of one-male groups can stay in their groups for six to eight years. Replacements in the resident males appear to occur without serious aggression. Upon reaching adulthood, males leave their natal groups and join all-male groups. Females also sometimes leave their natal groups, perhaps to avoid infanticide or inbreeding, reduce competition for food, or elevation of their social status.

In Sabah, Malaysia, proboscis monkeys have been observed in mixed-species groups with silvery lutungs, and interspecific mating and a possible hybrid has been observed. Researchers believe this may be a result of the two species being confined to a small patch of riverine forest due to deforestation in order to plant oil palm trees.

===Reproduction===
Females become sexually mature at the age of five years. They experience sexual swelling, which involves the genitals becoming pink or reddened. At one site, matings largely take place between February and November, while births occur between March and May. Copulations tend to last for half a minute. The male will grab the female by the ankles or torso and mount her from behind. Both sexes will encourage mating, but they are not always successful. When soliciting, both sexes will make pouted faces. In addition, males will sometimes vocalize and females will present their backsides and shake their head from side to side. Mating pairs are sometimes harassed by subadults. Proboscis monkeys may also engage in mounting with no reproductive purpose, such as playful and same-sex mounting, and females will attempt to initiate copulation even after they have conceived. Gestation usually last 166–200 days or slightly more. Females tend to give birth at night or in the early morning. The mothers then eat the placenta and lick their infants clean. The young begin to eat solid foods at six weeks and are weaned at seven months old. The nose of a young male grows slowly until reaching adulthood. The mother will allow other members of her group to hold her infant. When a resident male in a one-male group is replaced, the infants are at risk of infanticide.

===Communication===
Proboscis monkeys are known to make various vocalizations. When communicating the status of group, males will emit honks. They have a special honk emitted towards infants, which is also used for reassurance. Males will also produce alarm calls to signal danger. Both sexes give threat calls, but each are different. In addition, females and immature individuals will emit so-called &quot;female calls&quot; when angry. Honks, roars and snarls are made during low-intensity agonistic encounters. Nonvocal displays include leaping-branch shaking, bare-teeth open mouth threats and erection in males, made in the same situations.

===Feeding and activities===
As a seasonal folivore and frugivore, the proboscis monkey eats primarily fruit and leaves. It also eats flowers, seeds and insects to a lesser extent. At least 55 different plant species are consumed, &quot;with a marked preference for &quot;Eugenia&quot; sp., &quot;Ganua motleyana&quot; and &quot;Lophopetalum javanicum&quot;&quot;. Young leaves are preferred over mature leaves and unripe fruits are preferred over ripe fruit. Being a seasonal eater, the proboscis monkey eats mostly fruit from January to May and mostly leaves from June to December. Groups usually sleep in adjacent trees. Monkeys tend to sleep near rivers, if they are nearby. Proboscis monkeys will start the day foraging and then rest further inland. Their daily activities consist of resting, traveling, feeding and keeping vigilant. Occasionally, they chew their cud to allow more efficient digestion and food intake. As night approaches, the monkeys move back near the river and forage again. Predators (potential or confirmed) of the proboscis monkey include crocodilians like false gharials and saltwater crocodiles, the Sunda clouded leopard, sun bears and reticulated pythons as well as, for probably young or sickly monkeys, large eagles (such as the crested serpent eagle or black eagle), large owls, and monitor lizards. Monkeys will cross rivers at narrows or cross arboreally if possible. This may serve as predator avoidance.

==Conservation status==
The proboscis monkey is assessed as endangered in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and listed in Appendix I of CITES. Its total population has decreased by more than 50% in the past 36–40 years to 2008 due to ongoing habitat loss because of logging and oil palm plantations, and hunting in some areas due to the species being treated as a delicacy, as well as its use in traditional Chinese medicine. The population is fragmented: the largest remaining populations are found in Kalimantan; there are far fewer in Sarawak, Brunei and Sabah. The proboscis monkey is protected by law in all regions of Borneo. In Malaysia, it is protected by a number of laws including the Wildlife Protection Act (federal law), the Wildlife Protection Ordinance 1998 (Chapter 26) and Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 (Sabah state law).

The proboscis monkey can be found in 16 protected areas: Danau Sentarum National Park, Gunung Palung National Park, Kendawangan Nature Reserve, Kutai National Park, Lesan Protection Forest, Muara Kaman Nature Reserve, Mandor Reserve and Tanjung Puting National Park in Indonesia; Bako National Park, Gunung Pueh Forest Reserve, Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve, Klias National Park, Kulamba Wildlife Reserve, Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, Sungei Samunsam Wildlife Sanctuary and Ulu Segama Reserve in Malaysia.

<text>Carcharodon (meaning &quot;jagged/sharp tooth&quot; in Ancient Greek) is a genus of sharks within the family Lamnidae, colloquially called the &quot;white sharks.&quot; The only extant member is the great white shark (&quot;Carcharodon carcharias&quot;). Extinct species include &quot;C. hubbelli&quot; and &quot;C. hastalis.&quot; The first appearance of the genus may have been as early as the Early Miocene or Late Oligocene. Carcharocles megalodon is still argued by some paleontologists (e.g. Michael D. Gottfried, Leonard Compagno, and Ewan Fordyce) to be a close relative of &quot;Carcharodon carcharias&quot; - as well as being in the same genus. When Megalodon belonged to this genus it had the scientific name &quot;Carcharodon megalodon&quot;. More recently, Megalodon has been assigned by most scientists to either the genus &quot;Carcharocles&quot; or &quot;Otodus&quot;.

== Fossil History and Evolution ==
The fossil ancestry of &quot;Carcharodon&quot; is an active area of research and debate, given the dearth of the fossil record and the incompleteness of found specimens. Most &quot;Carcharodon&quot; fossil remains of are in the form of teeth, along with some vertebral centra. This is the norm for fossilized Chondrichthyans, since a shark&#x27;s skeleton is made of cartilage and soft tissues don&#x27;t preserve well. Thus, assessing relationships between fossil species relies largely on the form of their teeth. This difficulty is compounded by the incomplete fossil record of Lamnids. However, some researchers have proffered &quot;Macrorhizodus, Isurolamna,&quot; and &quot;Cretalamna&quot; as candidates for genera ancestral to &quot;Carcharodon,&quot; taxa ranging from the Eocene to the Cretaceous.

&quot;Carcharodon&quot; is well-represented in the fossil record by the Middle Miocene. The first widespread, cosmopolitan species being &quot;C. hastalis,&quot; with fossils recovered from North America, South America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. The modern great white shark has been posited to have evolved from &quot;C. hastalis&quot; through a transitional species, &quot;C. hubbelli&quot;.

Study of white shark taxonomy is complicated by nomenclature and repeated taxonomic reassignments of various species. &quot;C. hastalis, C. subserratus,&quot; and &quot;C. planus&quot; traditionally were placed in &quot;Isurus&quot;, given their superficial similarity to the teeth of mako sharks, leading many modern shark tooth collectors to still refer to these extinct species as &quot;makos.&quot; They were later reassigned to a new genus, &quot;Cosmopolitodus&quot;, a genus maintained as valid in some current literature, and considered a junior synonym of &quot;Carcharodon&quot; in others. &quot;C. hastalis&quot; has also been described as two morphotypes, &quot;broad-form&quot; and &quot;narrow-form,&quot; which some authors have split into two species, &quot;C. plicatilis (xiphodon)&quot; and &quot;C. hastalis&quot;, respectively. &quot;C. subserratus&quot;, historically known as &quot;C. escheri&quot; under the genus &quot;Carcharomodus&quot;, has recently been reclassified back in to the genus &quot;Carcharodon&quot; as &quot;C. subserratus&quot;.

The fossil &quot;mega-toothed&quot; sharks like megalodon have also traditionally been placed in &quot;Carcharodon&quot;, but most current literature refutes this position, placing mega-toothed sharks in a separate family, Otodontidae, and genus, &quot;Otodus&quot; (&quot;Carcharocles&quot;). &quot;Carcharodon caifassii&quot; is the other species in genus &quot;Carcharodon&quot;. It is a debated species, and is considered dubious. It lived in the Miocene and Pliocene period and was a possible ancestor of the great white shark (&quot;Carcharodon carcharias&quot;).

<doc id="477738" wikidata="Q636135" url="?curid=477738" title="Earth Crisis">
<text>Earth Crisis is an American metallic hardcore band from Syracuse, New York, active from 1989 until 2001, reuniting in 2007. Since 1993, the band&#x27;s longest-tenured members include vocalist Karl Buechner, lead guitarist Scott Crouse, bassist Ian Edwards, and drummer Dennis Merrick. Their third and current rhythm guitarist Erick Edwards joined the band in 1998.

The band has released eight full-length studio albums and four studio EPs, among other releases. The band is known for supporting animal rights, promoting a straight edge and vegan lifestyle, and addressing further social and political issues. Earth Crisis is considered a crucial developer and influence for both the metalcore genre and vegan straight edge movement.

== History ==
=== Initial career (1989–1995) ===

The band originally formed in 1989, after bassist Karl Buechner proposed the idea to his friend DJ Rose, whom he knew because both skateboarded together. Rose became the vocalist and they were joined by Jesse Buckley on drums and John Moseman on guitar. Established in the latter part of the youth crew heyday, where many groups disbanded and their members stopped being straight edge, they wanted to &quot;keep that torch burning&quot;, as Buechner said. &quot;The feeling of disappointment we had in those bands lead us to promote straight edge as being a lifetime commitment to never touch a drop of poison. We wanted people to know they can believe in us.&quot; Rose named the band after the 1984 album of the same name from the British reggae band Steel Pulse, because its cover portrayed many of the things they &quot;would stand against&quot;, such as the starving African children, the two blocs of the Cold War and Klansmen.

Its initial lineup was short-lived; they had two or three practices and played a show in Utica, New York. After that performance, Rose decided to quit the group to spend more time booking shows. Buechner continued composing and formed a new lineup of the band in 1991, after attending a skateboard demonstration where he met members of the vegan straight edge band Framework. He switched to lead vocals in the process and was joined by four of the five members of Framework: guitarist Scott Crouse, bassist Ian &quot;Bulldog&quot; Edwards, guitarist Ben Read and drummer Michael Riccardi, all of who participated in Earth Crisis as a side project. Both Earth Crisis and Framework appeared on the 1992 various artists tape compilation &quot;Structure Hardcore Compilation&quot;, released by the members of Chokehold. Earth Crisis&#x27; four-song EP &quot;All Out War&quot; marked their debut release later in 1992, and shortly afterwards the band became a first priority. 

In the summer of 1993, at the start of the &quot;All Out War&quot; tour, Earth Crisis recorded the &quot;Firestorm&quot; EP in the studio of Bill Korecky in Cleveland and released it through Victory Records. For this album, Riccardi was replaced by Dennis Merrick. Later on, Ben Read was replaced by Kris Wiechmann.

&quot;Destroy the Machines&quot;, their first full-length record, was released in 1995 and would eventually become the best-selling album in the history of Victory Records. Later this year, the band&#x27;s touring van was involved in an accident that injured all band members, most severely Merrick. During his recovery time, the other band members began the group Path of Resistance with Riccardi, Rose and another friend to remain occupied.

=== Subsequent years and breakup: (1996–2001) ===

1996&#x27;s &quot;Gomorrah&#x27;s Season Ends&quot; brought a more complex and developed form of metalcore and, shortly thereafter, they were asked to take part in the inaugural Ozzfest, including one song for its live album. Their popularity grew, resulting in a deal with Roadrunner Records, and the band released &quot;Breed the Killers&quot; in 1998, the first with guitarist Erick Edwards (bassist Ian Edwards&#x27;s brother) replacing Wiechmann. The album was produced by Andy Sneap and featured a guest appearance by Machine Head vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn. 

The band later returned to Victory Records, releasing 2000&#x27;s &quot;Slither&quot; soon after. With more emphasis on production and a change of style steered towards nu metal, it drew mixed reactions from critics and fans but had a wider exposure in mainstream music. Their final album before their breakup was 2001&#x27;s &quot;Last of the Sane&quot;, which included cover versions of songs by The Rolling Stones, Slayer, Led Zeppelin, Cream and Dead Kennedys.

In 2001, Earth Crisis disbanded on good terms because some members could no longer engage in a full-time touring band due to their personal lives. They played the final show of their initial career at Hellfest in Syracuse, New York. After the band&#x27;s breakup in 2001, Buechner, Bulldog and Erick Edwards went on to form Freya, a band named for the Norse goddess of fertility. Meanwhile, Crouse and Dennis Merrick moved to California and formed the group Isolated.

=== Reformation (2007–2009) ===

On January 27, 2007, the reunited Earth Crisis played the Maryland Metal and Hardcore Festival. Although it was originally planned as a one-off concert, numerous American and European dates followed thereafter. Earth Crisis headlined the Firestorm Fest in early 2008, in the midst of a US tour.

On September 10, 2008 it was announced that they had signed a worldwide deal with Century Media. They entered the studio on October 16, 2008 to record a new record, and Tue Madsen was hired to mix the project. The finished album, &quot;To the Death&quot;, was released in Europe on April 20, 2009 and in North America on May 5, 2009.

In August and September 2009, Earth Crisis played America and Europe on the Hell on Earth Tour, alongside Sworn Enemy, Neaera, Waking the Cadaver, War of Ages, Thy Will Be Done and War from a Harlots Mouth.

=== Latest releases: (2010–present) ===
In March 2010, they announced that drummer Andy Hurley of Fall Out Boy and formerly Racetraitor would serve as a touring musician for a portion of the band&#x27;s upcoming tour, as Merrick would only be available for certain dates.

In July 2011, Earth Crisis released their seventh studio album, &quot;Neutralize the Threat&quot;. The album was mixed and mastered by Zeuss. The tracks &quot;Raise&quot; and &quot;Total War&quot; were released online as an album teaser.

Earth Crisis released their eighth studio album &quot;Salvation of Innocents&quot; on March 4, 2014. A comic book of the Liberator series published by Black Mask Studios was made in collaboration with the band and released simultaneously with the album, sharing similar conceptual ideas and artwork.

== Musical style and influences ==
Although ideologically tied to the straight edge movement, the initial musical influences of Earth Crisis were mainly from New York hardcore bands such as Agnostic Front, Cro-Mags and Sick of It All. After the &quot;All Out War&quot; EP, they developed an increasingly technical and heavier style, citing death metal bands Napalm Death, Bolt Thrower and Obituary as prime inspirations. Buechner&#x27;s vocals became rougher with each release as well, culminating in the completely gutturally screamed &quot;Gomorrah&#x27;s Season Ends&quot;. &quot;Terrorizer&quot; magazine referred to this album as &quot;heavy hardcore taken to a new level, all the blackness that was hinted at on &quot;Firestorm&quot; realized in all its formidable glory.&quot; In this period, many of their songs were built on Merrick&#x27;s drum beats.

When asked what ten bands inspired Earth Crisis over the years in a 2016 interview, guitarist Scott Crouse named DYS, Judge, Corrosion of Conformity, Agnostic Front, Slayer, Sepultura, Metallica, Conviction, Zero Tolerance and Iron Maiden.

Their third studio album, &quot;Breed the Killers&quot;, maintained the previous aggressiveness and its growled vocals were &quot;taken about as far as possible&quot;, but it followed a structure more akin to the &quot;post-Judge hardcore of the Path of Resistance record &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot;&quot;, according to Shawn Macomber of &quot;Decibel&quot;. Dennis Merrick said: &quot;On &quot;Breed the Killers&quot; I think we achieved the most honest representation of our sound without sounding too raw or too slick&quot;. Its follow-up, &quot;Slither&quot;, had a change of style that steered towards nu metal. Buechner declared that, rather than being influenced by other styles, they &quot;resurrected&quot; the sound of &quot;All Out War&quot; in a proper way, which also had melodic choruses and spoken word verses.

Their first post-reunion album, &quot;To the Death&quot;, was described by Buechner as &quot;a mixture between &quot;Destroying the Machines&quot; and &quot;Breed the Killers&quot;.&quot; According to &quot;Stereo Killer&quot;, it was &quot;arguably the band&#x27;s heaviest offering&quot; but with &quot;more traditional verse/chorus/verse&quot; material. &quot;Neutralize the Threat&quot; followed a similar path, but &quot;with a &quot;Gomorrah&#x27;s Season Ends&quot; vibe thrown in&quot;, the band stated. Scott Crouse said that he always tried &quot;to get the perfect blend of heaviness, imagery and listenability&quot; and that these two albums were the first to &quot;hit that mark&quot;. &quot;Salvation of Innocents&quot; included, in addition, some clean vocals that were compared by one reviewer to the sludge metal band Crowbar, as well as &quot;some elements of melodic metalcore&quot; and faster songs.

Earth Crisis is often tied with hardcore punk and the metalcore sub-genre. Crouse has denied this association stating, &quot;[w]e get credited often for creating &#x27;metalcore,&#x27; but I’m not sure that’s fair. We were not very influenced by hardcore at all. We were drawing influence from bands like Corrosion of Conformity’s &quot;Blind&quot; album. Believer, Carcass and Slayer. (...) It was really just us injecting those more metal elements into a scene that wasn’t very familiar with them, so I think it seemed like we created something.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Metal Assault&quot;, however, Crouse maintained that the band was still influenced by hardcore, though &quot;we tend to lean more towards the metal side than the hardcore side, specially (sic) in the later years. (...) I think we fit in more with a band like Carcass than we do with bands like Youth of Today or Gorilla Biscuits or something.&quot;

== Lyrics, views and activism ==

The name of the band, Earth Crisis, indicates how their members see the current state of the planet and in their lyrics they seek to offer solutions to it; these are either &quot;educational&quot; or encourage direct-action. Most of them focus on rejection of recreational drugs, animal products, animal testing, industrial livestock production, illegal drug trade and an impending earth&#x27;s doom caused by wars or an ecological collapse. On the other hand, they promote straight edge, veganism, self-empowerment and organizations such as Earth First!, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and the Animal Liberation Front. In the words of the academic Jonathan Pieslak, some of their lyrics &quot;read like passages&quot; taken from &quot;direct-action essays&quot; of these institutions. Other subjects include criticism against white supremacy and, especially on &quot;Breed the Killers&quot;, oppressive governments. 2000&#x27;s record &quot;Slither&quot; incorporated more topical issues, such as genetic engineering and second amendment rights. Their seventh and eighth albums, &quot;Neutralize the Threat&quot; and &quot;Salvation of Innocents&quot;, are concept albums entirely dedicated to real-life vigilantes and animal rights/anti-vivisection, respectively. The albums &quot;All Out War&quot;, &quot;Gomorrah&#x27;s Season Ends &quot; and &quot;Breed the Killers&quot; included essays that delve into their lyrics and beliefs. According to the sociologist Ross Haenfler, Earth Crisis combined &quot;youth crew&#x27;s outspoken commitment to straight edge with Manliftingbanner&#x27;s direct politics&quot;.

In a 1998 interview with Roadrunner Records, Karl Buechner described Earth Crisis&#x27; philosophy: &quot;I want to boil it down to one notion: personal accountability. Respect for yourself, respect for the lives of innocent beings around us.&quot; He added that &quot;Just being drug-free doesn&#x27;t make you a good person, you need to use that clarity of the mind to become actively involved in the struggle that is being waged for earth, human and animal liberation.&quot; Their message disjoined from the &quot;posicore&quot; attitudes in its advocation for violent direct action. However, they believe that it must be used only as a last resort: &quot;destruction and violence are the last thing I want to see but tragically, they are sometimes necessary. We place so far greater value on the lives of the innocent beings than any type of worth that could be put upon someone who&#x27;s sadistic or greedy and doesn&#x27;t want to change their profit system&quot;, said Buechner.

The band cited authors Peter Singer, John Robbins and Huey P. Newton as inspirations. In their live shows, there is usually literature about PETA, Greenpeace and others distributed. They have been longtime supporters for organizations such as the Animal Defense League, having done several benefit concerts for them. Nevertheless, they are not part of any of these groups or a political party: &quot;We&#x27;re about things we&#x27;re interested in and we sing about things that happen politically, but we&#x27;re not left-core or right wing. We don&#x27;t want to get tangled up in someone else&#x27;s agenda, which can happen if you join up in certain organizations.&quot; 

Earth Crisis was occasionally misidentified with the hardline subculture, but they are not against homosexuality and believe that abortion should remain as an option in some instances. They also do not have a religious agenda and think that that is mainly a personal choice.

== Legacy ==
Earth Crisis had a huge impact on both the hardcore punk music and its ideals. &quot;MetalSucks&quot; said: &quot;For anybody who was not in the hardcore scene back then, it is hard to describe the impact they had or how controversial they were. You either loved them or hated them for bringing both metal and veganism into the hardcore scene&quot;. Sociologist Ross Haenfler stated in &quot;The Vinyl Factory&quot; that &quot;Earth Crisis became the face of straight edge throughout the 1990s&quot; through &quot;the convergence of &#x27;radical&#x27; animal rights activism, a more aggressive &#x27;metalcore&#x27; sound, and hardcore crews&quot;, becoming &quot;one of the most controversial bands in the scene&#x27;s history.&quot;

Their albums &quot;Firestorm&quot;, &quot;Destroy the Machines&quot; and &quot;Gomorrah&#x27;s Season Ends&quot; were particularly influential for the emerging metalcore genre. According to Andrew O&#x27;Neill, &quot;Earth Crisis inspired a much more heavy metal sound in hardcore&quot; and &quot;the distinction between the two [genres] started to crumble&quot; shortly after those records were released.

To a large extent, Earth Crisis was responsible for the rising of vegan straight edge militancy in the mid- to late 90s, when veganism was rarely present in mainstream culture. Haenfler said that, while &quot;earlier straight edge bands advocated vegetarianism – for example Youth of Today, Insted and Manliftingbanner&quot;, Earth Crisis &quot;made animal rights (and environmentalism) central to the scene&quot; as a &quot;self-described &#x27;vegan straight edge&#x27; band&quot;, &quot;inspiring thousands of kids to give up animal products entirely.&quot; They also spawned many activists in the scene because their message &quot;imparted the sense of urgency in a way that nothing else that ever come before had&quot;, according to Peter Daniel Young. 

Some of their songs went on to be considered by some as anthems, such as &quot;Firestorm&quot; for straight edge and &quot;Ultramilitance&quot; for eco-terrorists. They also drew major media attention, having been featured and interviewed by CNN, CBS and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, while lead singer Karl Buechner was invited to address the Congress about teens and substance abuse.

<text>John DeFrancis (August 31, 1911January 2, 2009) was an American linguist, sinologist, author of Chinese language textbooks, lexicographer of Chinese dictionaries, and professor emeritus of Chinese Studies at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa.

==Early life==
John DeFrancis was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut in a family of modest Italian immigrant origins. His father, a laborer who had changed his name from DeFrancesco, died when DeFrancis was a young child. His mother was illiterate.

==Professional life==
After graduating from Yale College in 1933 with a Bachelor of Arts in economics, DeFrancis sailed to China with the intent of studying Chinese and working in business. In 1935, he accompanied H. Desmond Martin, a Canadian military historian, on a several-thousand-mile trip retracing the route of Genghis Khan through Mongolia and northwestern China. His book &quot;In the Footsteps of Genghis Khan&quot; (University of Hawai&#x27;i Press, 1993) describes this journey riding camels across the Gobi Desert, visiting the ruins of Khara-Khoto and rafting down the Yellow River. Along the way, he met the Chinese Muslim Ma Clique warlords Ma Buqing and Ma Bukang. DeFrancis returned to the United States in 1936 and did not visit China again until 1982.

DeFrancis began graduate studies in Chinese, first at Yale under George A. Kennedy and then at Columbia University due to Columbia&#x27;s larger graduate program in sinology. He received an MA from Columbia in 1941, then a Ph.D in 1948 with a dissertation entitled &quot;Nationalism and Language Reform in China&quot;, which was published by Princeton University Press in 1950. He began his academic career teaching Chinese at Johns Hopkins University during the height of the Red Scare, and was blacklisted for defending his colleague Owen Lattimore from unsubstantiated allegations of being a Russian spy, and eventually laid off in 1954.

After an unhappy stint as a vacuum-cleaner salesman, DeFrancis eventually returned to teaching, notably at Seton Hall University from 1961 to 1966, and the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa from 1966 to 1976. In the 1960s, at the request of John B. Tsu, he wrote 12 volumes of textbooks and readers for Mandarin Chinese, popularly known as the &quot;DeFrancis series &quot;and published by Yale University Press (), which were widely used in Chinese as a foreign language classes for decades; DeFrancis was one of the first educators outside China to use Hanyu Pinyin as an educational aid, and his textbooks are said to have had a &quot;tremendous impact&quot; on Chinese teaching in the West. He served as Associate Editor of the &quot;Journal of the American Oriental Society&quot; from 1950 to 1955 and the &quot;Journal of the Chinese Language Teachers Association&quot; from 1966 to 1978.

== Retirement ==
DeFrancis retired from teaching in 1976, but remained an important figure in Chinese language pedagogy, Asian sociolinguistics, and language policy, as well as a prolific author. One of his most well-known books, &quot;The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy&quot; (University of Hawai&#x27;i Press, 1984) attempts to debunk a number of what DeFrancis considered &quot;widespread myths&quot; about the language—including what he referred to as the &quot;ideographic myth&quot;. Another influential work of his was &quot;Visible Speech: The Diverse Oneness of Writing Systems&quot;, which addressed more myths about the Chinese writing system, and has been called his magnum opus by colleague Victor H. Mair. DeFrancis spent his final years diligently working as Editor in Chief of the &quot;ABC (Alphabetically Based Computerized) series&quot; of Chinese dictionaries, which feature innovative collation by the pinyin romanization system.

DeFrancis died on 2 January 2009, in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, at the age of 97.

<text>Jules Asner (born Julie Ann White; February 14, 1968) is an American screenwriter, author, former entertainment journalist, television personality, and model.

==Early life==
Asner was born Julie Ann White in Tempe, Arizona. At age 16, she was discovered at a modeling convention in Scottsdale, Arizona. She began her career as an Elite model. She shared a bunk-room with Cindy Crawford during the early years of her career. In 1986, she graduated from McClintock High School in Tempe.

She attended UCLA.

==Career==
Asner was a longtime E! personality. During her peak with the network, she hosted six hours of programming daily. Among the series she hosted were &quot;Revealed with Jules Asner&quot;, &quot;E! News Live&quot; and &quot;Wild On!.&quot; She also hosted many live specials. Asner received a Prism Award and a Gracie Award for her interview show &quot;Revealed with Jules Asner&quot;.

Before joining E! Asner was an entertainment reporter for Reuters Television &quot;Good Morning England&quot;, &quot;The Entertainment Show&quot; on Sky Television, and &quot;Extra&quot;. She hosted &quot;Live by Request&quot; on A&amp;E and was a segment director and producer on &quot;Hard Copy&quot;.

Miramax Books purchased the publishing rights to her first novel, &quot;Whacked&quot;. The novel recounts the story of a woman who plots revenge on a former lover. Asner said that the plot was based on a breakup she&#x27;d been through. Released on June 3, 2008, &quot;Whacked&quot; was a top-ten fiction bestseller on Amazon and was in its third printing within its first month of release.

Asner wrote the screenplay for husband Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s film &quot;Logan Lucky&quot;. She chose to use the pseudonym Rebecca Blunt because she did not want the &quot;story&quot; surrounding the film to be that &quot;Soderbergh was directing his wife&#x27;s script.&quot; In 2018, a Twitter account belonging to TheRebeccaBlunt posted photos of Asner and Soderbergh behind the scenes working on &quot;Logan Lucky&quot;. Asner previously did uncredited rewrite work on &quot;Magic Mike&quot; and several of Soderbergh&#x27;s other films.

== Personal life ==

From 1992 to 1996, she was married to Matthew Asner and took his surname, making her the daughter-in-law of actor Ed Asner.

She married film director Steven Soderbergh in their New York apartment on May 10, 2003. Soderbergh often credits his wife with influencing his female characters.

<text>William L. Howerdel (born May 18, 1970) is an American musician, best known as a founding member, guitarist, backing vocalist, songwriter, and producer for the band A Perfect Circle, as well as for his former solo project, Ashes Divide. Howerdel has recorded six studio albums across his career: four with A Perfect Circle, one under the moniker Ashes Divide, and one under his own name.

==Early life==
Howerdel was born in New Jersey. He attended high school at West Milford High School, where he played sports, took an interest in a television production class, and was active in an extracurricular audio program. This program gave him the foundation for his post-high school audio-technical pursuits and eventually led to his high-profile guitar technician positions. Stephen Porcello, the high school teacher who was the adviser for this program, took Howerdel to New York City and helped him select his first electric guitar.

Howerdel spent several years sound engineering for New Jersey artists and further worked as a guitar technician for numerous others, which, before forming A Perfect Circle, included Faith No More, Fishbone, David Bowie, The Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails, Guns N&#x27; Roses, and Tool.

==Recording career==
===Early work and A Perfect Circle===
Howerdel functioned as a guitar technician for Tool during the tour and recording of &quot;Ænima&quot;, working with Maynard James Keenan, whom he met in 1992. During this time, Howerdel played Keenan some of his songs, and Keenan offered to sing if Howerdel ever decided to form a band. Despite originally considering a female vocalist, Howerdel would eventually accept Keenan&#x27;s offer. In 1999, Howerdel founded A Perfect Circle and invited Keenan to join. The project was a success. Their debut album, &quot;Mer de Noms&quot;, released in May 2000, went platinum in the US, selling over one million copies by the end of the year. However, complications arose: Keenan could not commit all of his time to the band, still fronting Tool, and over time, he began to be more and more involved in the creative process of the music, leading to disagreements on the musical direction for the second A Perfect Circle album, &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;. The record, released in September 2003, was still a success, going platinum as well, though the two decided to take a break from the band, so that Keenan could return to Tool, and Howerdel could pursue solo work.

===Ashes Divide: 2003–2021===
Howerdel first began working on solo material during the writing sessions for &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;, in 2003. Rough versions of three or four songs were written during that era, including the track &quot;Stripped Away&quot;, which was even played at soundchecks at A Perfect Circle (APC) concerts while supporting the album. Additionally, the APC demo &quot;Army&quot; was eventually reworked into Howerdel&#x27;s own &quot;The Stone&quot;. Shortly after &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;, APC decided to quickly throw together a collection of anti-war cover songs just prior to the 2004 United States presidential election, entitled &quot;Emotive&quot;. Keenan pushed Howerdel to sing lead vocals on a few of the songs, to &quot;get people used to [his] voice&quot;, and to help Howerdel transition to the role of primary singer in his solo work. Once &quot;Emotive&quot; was completed, APC went on hiatus, while Howerdel continued to write new material.

====&quot;Keep Telling Myself It&#x27;s Alright&quot;====
As he put together more songs, Howerdel named his project Ashes Divide (stylised as ASHES dIVIDE) and began recording an album. He handled nearly all instruments in the studio, except drums, for which he recruited then-A Perfect Circle bandmate Josh Freese as a session musician. The project&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Stone&quot;, made its radio premiere on January 22, 2008, and the full album, titled &quot;Keep Telling Myself It&#x27;s Alright&quot;, followed on April 8. The record features a guest cello performance on the track &quot;Sword&quot; by Devo Keenan, Maynard&#x27;s son. In addition to Freese and Keenan, the record also includes contributions from drummer Dean Sainz, Concrete Blonde&#x27;s Johnette Napolitano, Alkaline Trio&#x27;s Matt Skiba, and former APC bassist Paz Lenchantin.

Howerdel formed a band to promote the record, touring throughout 2008. The lineup consisted of Jeff Friedl on drums, Matt McJunkins on bass, Jonathan Radtke on lead guitar, and Adam Monroe on keys.

The album debuted at number 36 in the U.S., selling 15,800 copies in its first week. As of August 2010, &quot;Keep Telling Myself It&#x27;s Alright&quot; had sold 61,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

====Further activity and decline====
Ashes Divide toured extensively in 2008 but pulled out of an opening slot for Puddle of Mudd at the end of the year, for undisclosed reasons, and fell out of the public eye. Toward the end of 2008, Maynard James Keenan announced that he and Howerdel were working on music for APC, and rumors arose that Ashes Divide was splitting up.

In late summer of 2009, Twitter posts and Myspace blogs indicated that the band was still active, and the group subsequently played a few live shows. Notably, they debuted a new song that Howerdel originally called &quot;Untitled&quot; but which has since been dubbed &quot;Trafficking&quot; by fans who attended Ashes Divide shows in late 2009 and early 2010. In April 2011, Howerdel mentioned that Ashes Divide would have released music in late 2010, had APC not reconvened for touring.

In December 2012, Howerdel updated the status of the project&#x27;s second album, stating, &quot;right now, I&#x27;m focusing most of my energy on a new Ashes Divide record, which is under way with 11 songs. Still working on finishing vocals and writing lyrics, and hopefully [will] get that thing mixed in January or February.&quot; Progress on the album was delayed, however, when Howerdel decided to redesignate a number of songs to APC instead.

The band played their first live show in three years on May 8, 2013, at the Satellite in Los Angeles, for Pathology Brand&#x27;s &quot;Wednesday Society&quot; fundraising event. In April 2017, Howerdel commented that he still continued to work on new material, but that the sound had deviated so far from the project&#x27;s first record, that he was contemplating whether or not he&#x27;d release it under the Ashes Divide name.&quot; In April 2018, he reiterated his plans to release a second album, but that some songs he had been working on ended up on the fourth APC album, &quot;Eat the Elephant&quot;, instead, including &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot;.

&quot;Revolver&quot; listed new Ashes Divide material as one of their most anticipated albums of 2020, despite it not having an official release date, and then again in 2021.

===&quot;What Normal Was&quot;: 2022===
In early 2022, Howerdel announced the name of his second studio album, &quot;What Normal Was&quot;, to be released on June 10, 2022, under his own name rather than the Ashes Divide moniker. Former A Perfect Circle contributors Danny Lohner and Josh Freese, in addition to current bassist Matt McJunkins, played on the album. Lohner and Freese would go on to play live dates in support of the album with Howerdel.

===Other projects===
Howerdel has occasionally played live with the band Abandoned Pools. In 2005, he wrote and recorded music for the video game &quot;Jak X: Combat Racing&quot;, which also features remixes of Howerdel&#x27;s songs by Danny Lohner and Dean Menta, as well as including contributions from Josh Freese, Troy Van Leeuwen, Atom Willard, Joey Castillo, ex-A Perfect Circle bassist Paz Lenchantin, and Wes Borland. Howerdel also worked on the Guns N&#x27; Roses album &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, specifically the song &quot;There Was a Time&quot;.

==Personal life==
In a 2008 interview, Howerdel said he did not take drugs, drank only occasionally, and practiced Transcendental Meditation.

<doc id="477751" wikidata="Q836841" url="?curid=477751" title="The Glass Bead Game">
<text>The Glass Bead Game (, ) is the last full-length novel by the German author Hermann Hesse. It was begun in 1931 in Switzerland, where it was published in 1943 after being rejected for publication in Germany due to Hesse&#x27;s anti-Fascist views. 

&quot;The Glass Bead Game&quot; is a literal translation of the German title, but the book has also been published under the title Magister Ludi, Latin for &quot;Master of the Game&quot;, an honorific title awarded to the book&#x27;s central character. &quot;Magister Ludi&quot; can also be seen as a pun: &quot;magister&quot; is a Latin word meaning &quot;teacher&quot;, while &quot;ludus&quot; can be translated as either &quot;game&quot; or &quot;school&quot;. But the title &quot;Magister Ludi&quot; is somewhat misleading, as it implies the book is a straightforward bildungsroman, when, in reality, the book touches on many different genres, and the bulk of the story is on one level a parody of the genre of biography.

In 1946, Hesse won the Nobel Prize in Literature. In honoring him in its Award Ceremony Speech, the Swedish Academy said that the novel &quot;occupies a special position&quot; in Hesse&#x27;s work. In 2019, the novel was nominated for the 1944 Retrospective Hugo Award for Best Novel.

==Description==
&quot;The Glass Bead Game&quot; takes place at an unspecified date centuries in the future. Hesse suggested that he imagined the book&#x27;s narrator writing around the start of the 25th century. The setting is a fictional province of central Europe called Castalia, which was reserved by political decision for the life of the mind; technology and economic life are kept to a strict minimum. Castalia is home to an austere order of intellectuals with a twofold mission: to run boarding schools, and to cultivate and play the Glass Bead Game, whose exact nature remains elusive and whose devotees occupy a special school in Castalia known as Waldzell. The rules of the game are only alluded to—they are so sophisticated that they are not easy to imagine. Playing the game well requires years of hard study of music, mathematics, and cultural history. The game is essentially an abstract synthesis of all arts and sciences. It proceeds by players making deep connections between seemingly unrelated topics. 

The novel is an example of a Bildungsroman, following the life of a distinguished member of the Castalian Order, Joseph Knecht, whose surname means &quot;servant&quot; and is cognate with the English word &quot;knight&quot;. The plot chronicles Knecht&#x27;s education as a youth, his decision to join the order, his mastery of the Game, and his advancement in the order&#x27;s hierarchy to eventually become &quot;Magister Ludi&quot;, the executive officer of the Castalian Order&#x27;s game administrators.

==Plot==
The novel&#x27;s beginning introduces the Music Master, the resident of Castalia who recruits Knecht as a young student and who is to have the longest-lasting and profoundest effect on Knecht throughout his life. At one point, as the Music Master nears death in his home at Monteport, Knecht obliquely refers to the Master&#x27;s &quot;sainthood&quot;. At the prestigious school Waldzell, Knecht develops another meaningful friendship with Plinio Designori, a student from a politically influential family, who is studying in Castalia as a guest. Knecht holds vigorous debates with Designori, who views Castalia as an &quot;ivory tower&quot; with little to no impact on the outside world. Knecht disagrees and argues in favor of Castalia.

Although educated in Castalia, Knecht&#x27;s path to &quot;Magister Ludi&quot; is atypical for the order, as he spends much of his time after graduation outside the province&#x27;s boundaries. His first such venture, to the Bamboo Grove, results in his learning Chinese and becoming something of a disciple to Elder Brother, a recluse who had given up living in Castalia. Next, as part of an assignment to foster goodwill between the order and the Catholic Church, Knecht is sent on several &quot;missions&quot; to the Benedictine monastery of Mariafels, where he befriends the historian Father Jacobus—a relationship that also profoundly affects Knecht.

As the novel progresses, Knecht begins to question his loyalty to the order, gradually coming to doubt that the intellectually gifted have a right to withdraw from life&#x27;s big problems. Knecht, too, comes to see Castalia as a kind of ivory tower, an ethereal and protected community, devoted to pure intellectual pursuits but oblivious to the problems of life outside its borders. This conclusion precipitates a personal crisis, and, according to his personal views regarding spiritual awakening, Knecht does the unthinkable: he resigns as Magister Ludi and asks to leave the order, ostensibly to become of value and service to the larger culture. The heads of the order deny his request, but Knecht departs Castalia anyway, initially taking a job as a tutor to his childhood friend Designori&#x27;s energetic and strong-willed son, Tito. Only a few days later, the story ends abruptly with Knecht drowning in a mountain lake while attempting to follow Tito on a swim for which Knecht was unfit.

The fictional narrator leaves off before the final sections of the book, remarking that the end of the story is beyond the scope of his biography. The concluding chapter, &quot;The Legend&quot;, is reportedly from a different biography. After this final chapter, several of Knecht&#x27;s &quot;posthumous&quot; works are then presented. The first section contains Knecht&#x27;s poetry from various periods of his life, followed by three short stories labeled &quot;Three Lives&quot;. These are presented as exercises by Knecht imagining his life had he been born in another time and place. The first tells of a pagan rainmaker named Knecht who lived &quot;many thousands of years ago, when women ruled&quot;. Eventually the shaman&#x27;s powers to summon rain fail, and he offers himself as a sacrifice for the good of the tribe. The second is based on the life of St Hilarion and tells of Josephus, an early Christian hermit who acquires a reputation for piety but is inwardly troubled by self-loathing and seeks a confessor, only to find that same penitent had been seeking him.

The final story concerns the life of Dasa, a prince wrongfully usurped by his half-brother as heir to a kingdom and disguised as a cowherd to save his life. While working with the herdsmen as a young boy, Dasa encounters a yogi in meditation in the forest. He wishes to experience the same tranquility as the yogi, but is unable to stay. He later leaves the herdsmen and marries a beautiful young woman, only to be cuckolded by his half-brother (now the Rajah). In a cold fury, he kills his half-brother and finds himself once again in the forest with the old yogi, who, through an experience of an alternate life, guides him on the spiritual path and out of the world of illusion (Maya).

The three lives, together with that as Magister Ludi, oscillate between extroversion (rainmaker, Indian life—both get married) and introversion (father confessor, Magister Ludi) while developing the four basic psychic functions of analytical psychology: sensation (rainmaker), intuition (Indian life), feeling (father confessor), and thinking (Magister Ludi).

===Earlier plans===
Hesse originally intended several different lives of the same person as he is reincarnated. Instead, he focused on a story set in the future and placed the three shorter stories, &quot;authored&quot; by Knecht in &quot;The Glass Bead Game&quot;, at the end of the novel.

Two drafts of a fourth life were published in 1965, the second recast in the first person and breaking off earlier. Dated 1934, they describe Knecht&#x27;s childhood and education as a Swabian theologian. This Knecht has been born some dozen years after the Treaty of Rijswijk in the time of Eberhard Ludwig, and in depicting the other characters Hesse draws heavily on actual biographies: Friedrich Christoph Oetinger, Johann Friedrich Rock, Johann Albrecht Bengel and Nicolaus Zinzendorf make up the cast of Pietist mentors. Knecht is heavily drawn to music, both that of Pachelbel and the more exotic Buxtehude. The fragment breaks off as the young contemporary of Bach happens upon an organ recital in Stuttgart.

===Central characters===
* Joseph Knecht: The story&#x27;s main character. He is the Magister Ludi for a majority of the book.
* The Music Master: Knecht&#x27;s spiritual mentor who, when Knecht is a child, examines him for entrance into the elite schools of Castalia.
* Plinio Designori: Knecht&#x27;s foil in the world outside.
* Father Jacobus: Benedictine monk and Joseph Knecht&#x27;s antithesis in faith.
* Elder Brother: A former Castalian and student of various Chinese scripts and ideologies.
* Thomas van der Trave: Joseph Knecht&#x27;s predecessor as Magister Ludi.
* Fritz Tegularius: A friend of Knecht&#x27;s but a portent of what Castalians might become if they remain insular.

==Castalia==
Castalia, where most of the novel is set, is described in English translation as the &quot;pedagogical province&quot;. It forms part of a large and prosperous state whose leaders are broadly but not uncritically sympathetic to the Castalian ideal of scholarship.

Castalia is an entirely male community, whose members are or aspire to be members of a secular Order similar to monastic orders. Prospective members are recruited in their pre-/early teens from the most promising scholars in its host state&#x27;s regular schools. One of Castalia&#x27;s roles (not explored in depth in the book) is provision of schoolteachers to its host state. Another is the advancement of learning, primarily in the fields of mathematics, musicology (of Western music up to the 18th century), philology, and the history of art. This role is entirely analytical: creativity and scientific research appear to be dead. A third role is to cultivate and develop the Glass Bead Game.

==The game==
The Glass Bead Game is &quot;a kind of synthesis of human learning&quot; in which themes, such as a musical phrase or a philosophical thought, are stated. As the Game progresses, associations between the themes become deeper and more varied. Although the Glass Bead Game is described lucidly, the rules and mechanics are not explained in detail. 

The popularity of the book led to the development of a community of game designers exploring what a playable game might be like. A physical game called the Glass Plate Game was developed in 1976 by Adrian Wolfe and Dunbar Aitkens, focusing on connections between the ideas of a conversation. Online variants began to be developed in the 2010s.

==Allusions==
Many of the novel&#x27;s characters have names that are allusive word games. For example, Knecht&#x27;s predecessor as Magister Ludi was Thomas van der Trave, a veiled reference to Thomas Mann, who was born in Lübeck, situated on the Trave river. Knecht&#x27;s brilliant but unstable friend Fritz Tegularius (Latin: &quot;roof tile maker&quot;) is based on Friedrich Nietzsche, while Father Jacobus is based on the historian Jakob Burckhardt. The name of Carlo Ferromonte is an Italianized version of the name of Hesse&#x27;s nephew, Karl Isenberg, while the name of the Glass Bead Game&#x27;s inventor, Bastian Perrot of Calw, was taken from Heinrich Perrot, who owned a machine shop where Hesse once worked after dropping out of school. The name of the pedagogic province in the story is taken from Greek legend of the nymph Castalia, who was transformed into an inspiration-granting fountain by the god Apollo.

==As utopian literature==
In his biography of Hesse, Freedman wrote that the tensions caused by the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany directly contributed to the creation of &quot;The Glass Bead Game&quot; as a response to the oppressive times. &quot;The educational province of Castalia, which provided a setting for the novel, came to resemble Hesse&#x27;s childhood Swabia physically while assuming more and more the function of his adopted home, neutral Switzerland, which in turn embodied his own antidote to the crises of his time. It became the &#x27;island of love&#x27; or at least an island of the spirit.&quot; According to Freedman, in the Glass Bead Game, &quot;contemplation, the secrets of the Chinese I Ching and Western mathematics and music fashioned the perennial conflicts of his life into a unifying design.&quot;

<text>Sir John Boorman (; born 18 January 1933) is a British film director, producer and screenwriter. He is best known for directing feature films such as &quot;Point Blank&quot; (1967), &quot;Hell in the Pacific&quot; (1968), &quot;Deliverance&quot; (1972), &quot;Zardoz&quot; (1974), &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot; (1977), &quot;Excalibur&quot; (1981), &quot;The Emerald Forest&quot; (1985), &quot;Hope and Glory&quot; (1987), &quot;The General&quot; (1998), &quot;The Tailor of Panama&quot; (2001) and &quot;Queen and Country&quot; (2014).

Boorman has directed 20 films and received five Academy Award nominations, twice for Best Director (for &quot;Deliverance&quot;, and &quot;Hope and Glory&quot;), two British Academy Film Award nominations and three Golden Globe Award nominations. He is also credited with creating the first Academy Award screeners to promote &quot;The Emerald Forest&quot;. In 2004, Boorman received the BAFTA Fellowship for lifetime achievement from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. In the 2022 New Year Honours, he received a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II for services to film.

==Early life==
Boorman was born in Shepperton, Middlesex, England, the son of pub landlord George Boorman and his wife, Ivy (née Chapman), daughter of a &quot;well-to-do owner of pubs in London&#x27;s East End&quot;. George Boorman was of Dutch parentage; he served as a captain in the British Indian Army during World War I, and later worked for the founder of Shell Oil. Boorman&#x27;s paternal grandfather, an inventor, &quot;made and lost several fortunes during his lifetime&quot;. Although not Roman Catholic, after failing the eleven-plus he was sent to be educated at the Salesian School in Chertsey, Surrey.

==Career==
Boorman was conscripted for military service and became a clerical instructor in the British Army. He did not serve in the Korean War, but once faced court-martial for &quot;seducing a soldier from the course of his duty&quot; by criticising the war to his trainees; this was abandoned when Boorman showed that &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper was the source of all his comments. After army service he worked as a drycleaner and journalist in the late 1950s. He ran the newsrooms at Southern Television in Southampton and Dover before moving into television documentary filmmaking, eventually becoming head of the BBC&#x27;s Bristol-based documentary unit. In 1963 he wrote and directed a documentary about professional football, &quot;Six Days to Saturday&quot;, which focused on a week in the life of Swindon Town, who were in England&#x27;s second division.

Having caught the attention of a producer, David Deutsch, Boorman was offered the chance to direct a film aimed at repeating the success of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (directed by Richard Lester in 1964): &quot;Catch Us If You Can&quot; (1965) is about another pop group, the Dave Clark Five. While it was not as successful commercially as Lester&#x27;s film was, it drew good reviews from distinguished critics such as Pauline Kael and Dilys Powell, and smoothed Boorman&#x27;s way into the film industry.

Boorman was drawn to Hollywood for the opportunity to make more ambitious films and in &quot;Point Blank&quot; (1967), based on a novel by Richard Stark (a pen name of Donald E. Westlake), he brought a stranger&#x27;s vision to the decaying fortress of Alcatraz and the proto-hippy world of the West Coast of the United States. Lee Marvin gave the unknown director his full support, telling MGM that he deferred all his approvals on the project to Boorman.

After &quot;Point Blank&quot;, Boorman worked with Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune on the robinsonade &quot;Hell in the Pacific&quot; (1968), which tells a fable of two representative soldiers stranded on an island.

After returning to the United Kingdom, Boorman made &quot;Leo the Last&quot; (US–UK, 1970). This film exhibited the influence of Federico Fellini and even starred a Fellini regular, Marcello Mastroianni. It won Boorman a Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival.

Boorman achieved much greater resonance with &quot;Deliverance&quot; (US, 1972, adapted from a novel by James Dickey), depicting the ordeal of four urban men, played by Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty, who encounter danger from an unexpected quarter while whitewater-rafting through the Appalachian backwoods. The film became Boorman&#x27;s first true box office success and earned him several award nominations.

At the beginning of the 1970s, Boorman planned to film &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and corresponded about his plans with the author, J. R. R. Tolkien. Ultimately the production proved too costly, though some elements and themes can be seen in &quot;Excalibur&quot; (1981). A wide variety of films followed. &quot;Zardoz&quot; (1974), starring Sean Connery, is a post-apocalyptic science fiction piece, set in the 23rd century where society is divided into two worlds. According to the director&#x27;s film commentary, the &quot;Zardoz world&quot; is on a collision course with an &quot;effete&quot; eternal society.

Boorman was selected as director for &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot; (USA, 1977), a move that surprised the industry given his dislike of the original film. Boorman declared, &quot;Not only did I not want to do the original film, I told the head of Warner Brothers, John Calley, [that] I&#x27;d be happy if he didn&#x27;t produce the film too&quot;. The original script by a Broadway playwright, William Goodhart, was intellectual and ambitious, being concerned with the metaphysical nature of the battle between good and evil, and influenced by the writings of Catholic theologian Pierre Teilhard De Chardin, &quot;I found It extremely compelling. It was based on Chardin&#x27;s intoxicating idea that biological evolution was the first step In God&#x27;s plan, starting with inert rock, and culminating in humankind.&quot; Despite Boorman&#x27;s rewriting throughout shooting, the film was rendered incomprehensible. The film, released in June 1977, was a critical disaster but a moderate box office success. Boorman was denounced by William Peter Blatty, the author of the original novel &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, and by William Friedkin, director of the first &quot;Exorcist film&quot;. Boorman later admitted that his approach to the film was a mistake. &quot;The Heretic&quot; is often considered not just the worst film of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; series but one of the worst films of all time.

&quot;Excalibur&quot;, a long-held dream project of Boorman&#x27;s, is a retelling of the Arthurian legend, based on &quot;Le Morte D&#x27;Arthur&quot;. Boorman cast Nicol Williamson and Helen Mirren over their protests, as the two disliked each other intensely but Boorman felt that their mutual antagonism would enhance their presentations of the characters they were playing. The production was based in the Republic of Ireland, where Boorman had settled. For the film he employed all of his children as actors and crew (several of Boorman&#x27;s later films have also been &quot;family business&quot; productions). The film, one of the first to be produced by Orion Films, was a moderate success.

&quot;The Emerald Forest&quot; (1985) saw Boorman cast his son Charley Boorman as an eco-warrior in a rainforest adventure that included commercially required elements – action and near-nudity – with authentic anthropological detail. Rospo Pallenberg&#x27;s original screenplay was adapted into a book of the same name by author Robert Holdstock. Because the film&#x27;s distributor faced business troubles that year, the film did not receive a traditional &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; advertising campaign for the 1985 Academy Awards, despite positive critical reviews. Boorman took the initiative to promote the film himself by making VHS copies available for no charge to Academy members at several Los Angeles-area video rental stores. Boorman&#x27;s idea later became ubiquitous during Hollywood&#x27;s award season, and by the 2010s, more than a million Oscar screeners were mailed to Academy members each year. &quot;Emerald Forest&quot; received no nominations.

&quot;Hope and Glory&quot; (1987, UK) is his most autobiographical movie to date, a retelling of his childhood in London during The Blitz. Produced by Goldcrest Films, with Hollywood financing the film, it proved a box office hit in the US, receiving numerous Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations. His 1990 US-produced comedy about a dysfunctional family, &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;, was a major flop.

When his friend David Lean died in 1991, Boorman was to take over direction of Lean&#x27;s long-planned adaptation of &quot;Nostromo&quot;, though the production collapsed. &quot;Beyond Rangoon&quot; (US, 1995) and &quot;The Tailor of Panama&quot; (US/Ireland, 2000) both explore unique worlds with alien characters stranded and desperate.

Boorman won the Best Director Award at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival for &quot;The General&quot;, his biopic of Martin Cahill. The film is about a glamorous, yet mysterious, criminal in Dublin who was killed, apparently by the Provisional Irish Republican Army. Boorman had been one of Cahill&#x27;s burglary victims, having the gold record awarded for the score to &quot;Deliverance&quot; stolen from his home.

Released in 2006, his &quot;The Tiger&#x27;s Tail&quot; was a thriller set against the tableau of early 21st century capitalism in Ireland. At the same time, Boorman began work on a long-time pet project of his, a fictional account of the life of Roman Emperor Hadrian (entitled &quot;Memoirs of Hadrian&quot;), written in the form of a letter from a dying Hadrian to his successor. In the meantime, a re-make/re-interpretation of the classic &quot;The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz&quot; with Boorman at the helm was announced in August 2009.

In 2007 and 2009 he took part in a series of events and discussions as part of the Arts in Marrakech Festival along with his daughter Katrine Boorman including an event with Kim Cattrall called &#x27;Being Directed&#x27;. In November 2012 he was selected as a president of the main competition jury at the 2012 International Film Festival of Marrakech.

In Autumn 2013 Boorman began shooting &quot;Queen and Country&quot;, the sequel to his 1987 Oscar-nominated &quot;Hope and Glory&quot;, using locations in Shepperton and Romania. The film was selected to be screened as part of the Directors&#x27; Fortnight section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.

John Boorman&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Crime of Passion&quot;, was published in 2016 (by Liberties Press, Dublin), with a French-language edition published by Marest in 2017.

==Personal life==
Boorman was a longtime resident of Ireland and lived in Annamoe, County Wicklow, close to the Glendalough twin lakes. In 2022, he put his property up for sale, intending to move to Surrey, England, where his son Charley lives. According to a 2012 interview, he was recently divorced. By 2020, he was married to his third wife.

He has seven children: Katrine (b. 1958), Telsche (1959–1996), Charles (b. 1966), and Daisy (b. 1966) with his first wife, Christel Kruse, to whom he was married until 1990; and Lola, Lee, and Lily Mae with his second wife, Isabella Weibrecht, whom he married in 1995.

His son, Charley Boorman, has a career as an actor but reached a wider audience when he and actor Ewan McGregor made a televised motorbike trip across Europe, Central Asia, Siberia, Alaska, Canada, and the Midwest US during 2004. His daughter Katrine Boorman (Igrayne in &quot;Excalibur&quot;) works as an actress in France.
Another daughter, Telsche, co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; with Boorman. She died of ovarian cancer in 1996 at the age of 36. She had been married to the journalist Lionel Rotcage, the son of French singer Régine, and they had a daughter together.

Boorman was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1994 Birthday Honours for services to the film industry. In 2004, Boorman was also made a Fellow of BAFTA and in 2013 he received a Fellowship from the British Film Institute, an organisation he had previously served as a Governor. Boorman was knighted in the 2022 New Year Honours for services to film.

<doc id="477755" wikidata="Q621519" url="?curid=477755" title="Stephanoberyciformes">
<text>The Stephanoberyciformes are an order of marine ray-finned fishes, consisting of about 68 species, the majority (61) of which belong to the ridgehead family (Melamphaidae). The Stephanoberyciformes are mostly uncommon deep-sea species with little, if any, importance to commercial fishery. They share many morphological similarities with the Beryciformes, their sister order. They are usually found in Australian waters.

Some sources classify their other close relatives, the whalefishes, as a superfamily herein, named Cetomimoidea. Most taxa traditionally placed here would then be the Stephanoberyciodea.

The families are:
* Melamphaidae – ridgeheads (about 61 species)
* Gibberichthyidae – gibberfishes (2 species)
* Stephanoberycidae – pricklefishes (4 species)
* Hispidoberycidae - Bristlyskin (1 species)

Common characteristics include; a generally rounded body, a toothless palate, rather thin skull bones, and a missing orbitosphenoid bone (except for &quot;Hispidoberyx&quot;).

The gibberfishes on the other hand appear to be closer to whalefishes such as &quot;Rondeletia&quot;, as has been proposed time and again. These two groups have - apparently as only living fishes - the mysterious Tominaga&#x27;s organ (A large mass of globular white tissue, that is present anterior to the orbit and posterior and medial to the nostrils and nasal rosette). &quot;Rondeletia&quot;, meanwhile, is suspected to be very close to the velvet whalefish, &quot;Barbourisia rufa&quot;.

<doc id="477757" wikidata="Q1583213" url="?curid=477757" title="Russian Constitution of 1906">
<text>The Russian Constitution of 1906 refers to a major revision of the 1832 Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire, which transformed the formerly absolutist state into one in which the emperor agreed for the first time to share his autocratic power with a parliament. It was enacted on 1906, on the eve of the opening of the first State Duma. This first-ever Russian Constitution was a revision of the earlier Fundamental Laws, which had been published as the Code of Laws of the Russian Empire (, pre-1918 Russian orthography: &quot;Сводъ законовъ Россійской Имперіи&quot;) in 1832. It was granted during the Russian Revolution of 1905, in a last-ditch effort by the imperial government to preserve its own existence and keep the empire from disintegration.

The new constitution provided for a bicameral Russian parliament, without whose approval no laws were to be enacted in Russia. This legislature was composed of an upper house, known as the State Council, and a lower house, known as the State Duma. Half of the members of the upper house were appointed by the Tsar, while the other half were elected by various governmental, clerical and commercial interests. Members of the lower house were to be chosen by different classes of the Russian people, through a complex scheme of indirect elections—with the system being weighted to ensure the ultimate preponderance of the propertied classes. While the Duma held the power of legislation and the right to question the Tsar&#x27;s ministers, it did not have control over their appointment or dismissal, which was reserved to the monarch alone. Nor could it alter the constitution, save upon the emperor&#x27;s initiative. The Tsar retained an absolute veto over legislation, as well as the right to dismiss the Duma at any time, for any reason he found suitable. The emperor also had the right to issue decrees during the Duma&#x27;s absence—though these lost their validity if not approved by the new parliament within two months.

This charter had been granted under duress, and Nicholas abhorred its restrictions upon his power, which he had sworn at his coronation to pass on to his son. He dismissed the First and Second Dumas when they proved &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; to him, and unilaterally altered the election statutes (in violation of the constitution) to ensure that more landed persons would be elected to future Dumas. Although the resulting Third and Fourth Dumas proved more lasting, they still quarreled with the Tsar and his government over the general direction of state policy, and over the fundamental nature of the Russian state. Ultimately, with the outbreak of the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Duma took a leading role in bringing about the Tsar&#x27;s abdication, which led in turn to the abolition of monarchy and the ascent to power of the Russian Provisional Government under Kerensky. However, that liberal government would be overthrown a few months later in the October Revolution, with the rise of the Bolsheviks signifying Russia&#x27;s transition to a dictatorship.

==Russian government prior to 1906==

Prior to the enactment of the 1906 Russian constitution, the Russian Empire had been an absolute monarchy, ruled by an autocratic emperor, who was commonly referred to by his pre-imperial title of &quot;Tsar&quot;. The precise regulations by which the Tsar exercised his imperial prerogatives were first codified in 1832, with the issuance of the &quot;Set of Laws of the Russian Empire&quot; (&quot;Свод законов Российскои империи&quot;), penned by Mikhail Speransky. These laws could be altered or repealed by the emperor. However, the autocratic Tsars were generally limited by two constraints: they and their spouses must profess the Russian Orthodox faith, and they must obey the laws of succession laid down by Emperor Paul I. Beyond that, the power of the Russian emperor was virtually limitless.

Although a Boyar Duma had existed in Russia from Muscovite times until the rule of Peter I, it was an advisory institution, without legislative prerogatives. Peter abolished this organ in 1721, replacing it with the Governing Senate. This body consisted of nine (later ten) members, and was intended to oversee administration of the empire, under the direction of an Ober-Procurator, appointed (as were all members of this body) by the sovereign. The emperor might submit draft decree proposals to this committee for their deliberation and recommendations, but he was not bound to do so, nor was he required to accept their advice, once tendered. In later years, the Governing Senate took on an important role in administration and law, and by the late nineteenth century it had evolved into the highest judicial organ in Russia, with all officials and legal institutions under its control. Its decisions as to interpretation of the legal code, unless countermanded by the Tsar, were seen as absolutely authoritative. However, the Senate still remained at all times under the monarch&#x27;s direct control: he named and dismissed its members, could alter its prerogatives, and was free to overrule its actions. As such, the Ruling Senate was never considered to be a &quot;parliament&quot; in the modern sense.

Various proposals for reform emerged during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries: Alexander I formed a Privy Committee to investigate introducing a parliament and ministerial system; the latter was eventually introduced, but the former foundered due to the Napoleonic Wars and opposition from conservative members of the nobility. Alexander did establish a State Council, with 35—later 60—members, whose major duty was the investigation, promulgation and abrogation of laws. Its four departments were:

*Legislative;
*Civil and Ecclesiastical Administration;
*State Economy; and
*Industry, Science and Commerce.

Each department had its own presiding officer (called a State Secretary) and met separately to discuss matters assigned to it. There were also plenary sessions of the whole Council, called to peruse laws proposed by the Tsar&#x27;s ministers, who were ex-officio members. While most sessions concerned the budget and state expenditures, the Council would examine anything submitted to it. It had no authority to propose changes to existing laws, nor to investigate anything not initiated by the Tsar. Decision-making authority rested with the emperor, who appointed and dismissed members of the Council.

Alexander&#x27;s nephew Alexander II entertained reformist ideas, culminating in a project initiated by Count Mikhail Loris-Melikov, who had been appointed his Minister of Interior in August 1880. One of these proposals would have established two Imperial commissions, to be populated by indirectly elected members, who would advise the Emperor on further reforms. Alexander&#x27;s assassination, on the very day he intended to sign this proposal into law, effectively killed all mention of legislative reform in Russia—as the murdered Tsar&#x27;s son, Alexander III, insisted upon preserving the autocracy intact. Nicholas II, who succeeded his father in 1894, was also committed to maintain absolute monarchy, even in the face of ever-increasing calls for reform, peasant unrest, and the rise of revolutionary organizations within his empire. When reforms became inevitable, Nicholas would insist upon retaining as much of his previous authority as possible. For instance, faced with demands from municipal and provincial dumas for the establishment of a national legislative assembly, Nicholas offered only a broadening of the local councils&#x27; authority, insurance for factory workers, and the abolition of censorship. This was not considered nearly enough for the liberals, who agitated even more for a constitution and far-reaching political reforms.

==Adoption of the constitution==
Russian defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 combined with a rising tide of revolutionary feeling in Russia to produce the Russian Revolution of 1905. This upheaval was initially provoked by Bloody Sunday, in which thousands of unarmed protesters (largely urban workers and intellectuals) seeking to present a petition to the Tsar were met by imperial troops, who opened fire on them and killed several. As word of this tragedy spread across the empire, it combined with the catastrophic Russian defeat in the Far East to incite a major uprising against the emperor&#x27;s authority. Although the Tsarist army largely remained loyal to the emperor, close advisors to the Tsar became convinced that some kind of fundamental change in State administration was inevitable, if the monarchy was to survive.

Count Sergei Witte, the Tsar&#x27;s Minister of Finance and recent Russian plenipotentiary at the Treaty of Portsmouth negotiations (ending the war with Japan), was named chairman of the Tsar&#x27;s Council of Ministers after returning home from New Hampshire. He proposed introduction of an elected legislature, the granting of basic civil rights, and the formation of a constitutional monarchy. Nicholas strenuously resisted these ideas, but gave in after his first choice to head a military dictatorship, Grand Duke Nicholas, threatened to shoot himself in the head if the Tsar did not accept Witte&#x27;s suggestion. Nicholas unwillingly agreed, and issued what became known as the October Manifesto on 1905, promising basic civil rights and an elected parliament called the Duma, without whose approval no laws were to be enacted in Russia in the future.

Accordingly, three proposed drafts were prepared for a revision of Speransky&#x27;s Fundamental Laws. The Tsar chose to accept the draft authored by Peter Kharitonov, Deputy State Secretary of the State Chancellory, as the basis for the new constitution. Other constitutions from Austria-Hungary, Japan and Prussia were also studied, as was a draft constitution authored by the Union of Liberation, and published abroad. The State Chancellory prepared a draft, which was discussed during five sessions of the Council of Ministers, where alterations were made to further strengthen the emperor&#x27;s prerogatives at the expense of the new parliament. Following this, the draft was further discussed and amended under the Tsar&#x27;s chairmanship; Nicholas chose to officially publish this new constitution on 1906. With this act, Russia was officially transformed from an absolute monarchy into a constitutional one, though the exact extent of just &quot;how&quot; constitutional quickly became the subject of debate, based upon the emperor&#x27;s subsequent actions.

==Provisions==
The Russian Constitution of 1906 contained an introduction and eleven chapters: comprising a total of 124 articles:

*The Introduction (Articles 1–3) declared that Russia was &quot;one and indivisible&quot;, and mandated the use of Russian in the armed forces and other public institutions. It also acknowledged the Grand Principality of Finland as an &quot;inseparable part of the Russian state&quot;, while ambiguously acknowledging its special legislative and political status.
*Chapter One (Articles 4–24) concerned &quot;the essence of the supreme autocratic power&quot;, declaring that the emperor possessed &quot;supreme sovereign power&quot;, and that obedience to his commands was mandated by God himself. It provided for the ruler&#x27;s prerogatives, while making him personally inviolable. The Tsar possessed an absolute veto over all legislation, legislative initiative on all matters, and the sole prerogative to initiate any revision of the constitution itself. The emperor had charge over Russia&#x27;s administrative and external affairs, and sole power to declare war, make peace and negotiate treaties, as well as the supreme command of the armed forces. The emperor also retained authority over the minting of money, as well as the right to grant pardons and quash judicial proceedings. He appointed and dismissed his ministers at will, and decided the nature and scope of their duties.
*Chapter Two (Articles 25–39) regulated the order of succession to the throne. The thrones of Poland and Finland were declared &quot;inseparable&quot; from that of Russia, while precise rules on succession to the throne were spelled out. Females were eligible to succeed, though they were placed last in order behind all dynastically qualified male descendants of Romanov emperors. A female ruler was guaranteed all the prerogatives and privileges of the imperial office, though her consort was not to take the title of &quot;emperor&quot;. Children born to a marriage between a dynastic Romanov and a person &quot;not of corresponding dignity&quot; (defined as &quot;not belonging to any royal or sovereign house&quot;) were ineligible for the throne, as was any person who inherited the throne while ruling over another nation whose state religion was not Orthodox, if unwilling to renounce that other throne and faith.
*Chapter Three (Articles 40–82) concerned issues of regency and guardianship, if the emperor was a minor. The age of majority was established at sixteen, and instructions were given concerning the appointment of a regent and a mandatory regency council, together with the prerogatives exercised by the same.
*Chapter Four (Articles 53–56) concerned accession to the throne and the Oath of Allegiance to be sworn by all male citizens of the empire, aged twenty and above, each &quot;according to his faith and law&quot;.
*Chapter Five (Articles 57–58) concerned the coronation and anointing of a new sovereign, which was to take place &quot;according to the rite of the Greco-Russian Orthodox Church.&quot; Explanatory Note 1 at the end of this chapter indicated that the emperor was conjointly crowned Emperor of Russia and King of Poland. Explanatory Note 2 required him to recite the Nicene Creed according to the Orthodox Christian formula (without the filioque clause), and mandated a specific prayer for him to recite during the ceremony while wearing the Imperial Crown of Russia and holding the sceptre and orb.
*Chapter Six (Articles 59–61) concerned the many formal titles held by the Russian sovereign, together with the precise makeup of the Russian state coat of arms and seal.
*Chapter Seven (Articles 62–68) concerned the relationship of the Russian state to the various religions professed by its subjects. The Orthodox faith was declared the state religion, and both the emperor and his or her consort were required to profess that religion. The Tsar was named as the &quot;supreme defender and guardian&quot; of the Russian Orthodox Church, while those of other confessions were promised full religious liberty, which was also extended to &quot;Jews, Muslims and heathens.&quot;

*Chapter Eight (Articles 69–83) concerned the &quot;rights and obligations&quot; of Russian citizens. Citizens were guaranteed protection from arbitrary arrest and detention, the inviolability of their domiciles, protection from illegal search and seizure, the right to travel (subject to restriction), and the right to own private property. Other rights promised in the document included freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, to organize unions and similar organizations, and freedom of religion. Military service was mandatory for all male subjects called to it, regardless of social rank, and payment of taxes and performance of &quot;other duties in accordance with lawful decrees&quot; was required.
*Chapter Nine (Articles 84–97) concerned the promulgation of laws. Article 86 required the approval of the emperor, Duma and State Council for all laws, while Article 87 permitted the Tsar and his cabinet to issue decrees during times when the Duma was not in session. However, these lost their validity if not introduced to the new Duma within two months of its convocation, or if the new Duma or Council refused to confirm them. This article furthermore prohibited the emperor from using this authority to change the Constitution itself, or to change the laws for election to the Duma or Council. Nicholas&#x27; violation of this provision during the so-called Coup of June 1907 would irreparably damage his reputation among Russian liberals, and led many to conclude that the entire Russian Constitution was ultimately a sham. This contributed to more revolutionary agitation, and to the Tsar&#x27;s eventual overthrow in February 1917. The Russian system did not offer any right of impeachment to the legislative branch of government.
*Chapter Ten (Articles 98–119) regulated the &quot;modus operandi&quot; of the State Council and Duma. Both were required to meet at least once per year, though the duration of their sessions and the length of their recess were the emperor&#x27;s prerogative. The Tsar was granted the right to appoint up to one-half of the membership of the State Council, while members of the Duma were to be elected for a five-year term according to the state election statutes. Both houses possessed equal rights in legislative matters, while either or both of them could be dissolved at any time by the emperor, though new elections for the Duma must be announced at the same time as its dissolution. Both houses possessed the right of legislative initiative, save in respect to the constitution itself; amendments to the constitution could only be proposed by the monarch. The Imperial Court Ministry was not subject to the Duma&#x27;s control. Securing of governmental loans was also beyond the legislature&#x27;s purview, nor was it permitted to refuse or reduce funds to repay such obligations. The Duma was equally prohibited from using its budgetary power to deny manpower requests from the Army or Navy; should the legislature not approve such a petition, the military was allowed to call a new number of draftees equal to the previous year&#x27;s number.
*Chapter Eleven (Articles 120–124) concerned the Council of Ministers. It established the office of Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and made all members of this council responsible to the emperor for their actions. &quot;Regulations, instructions or orders&quot; issued by this council, or any member thereof, could not contradict existing law. Ministers could be interrogated by either the State Council or Duma for their actions while in office, but only the Tsar could remove them.

==Abolition of the 1906 constitution==
With the abdication of Tsar Nicholas in February 1917 (Old Style), the government of Russia was initially taken over by a Provisional Government established by the Fourth Duma. Alexander Kerensky, who became the most prominent leader of this government, unilaterally abolished the Russian monarchy on 1917, thereby formally abrogating the 1906 Constitution. In November Russia was taken over by the Bolshevik party, leading ultimately to the establishment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on 30 December 1922. Prior to that time, the Communists had enacted a new constitution, firmly establishing Russia as a Bolshevik state. This was in turn superseded by the 1924 Soviet Constitution and the constitutions of 1936 and 1977, the last of which lasted until the fall of the Soviet Union and the adoption of Russia&#x27;s current governing document in 1993, under which the nation is currently governed.

<doc id="477765" wikidata="Q467861" url="?curid=477765" title="Kathleen Kennedy Townsend">
<text>Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend (born July 4, 1951) is an American attorney who served as the sixth lieutenant governor of Maryland from 1995 to 2003. She was the first woman to serve in that role. A member of the Democratic Party, she ran unsuccessfully for governor of Maryland in 2002.

In 2010, Townsend became the chair of the non-profit American Bridge, an organization whose focus is to raise funds for Democratic candidates and causes. Since 2021, she has served in the United States Department of Labor as an advisor on retirement. She is a member of the prominent political Kennedy family, and is the oldest grandchild of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy.

==Early life and education==
She was born in Greenwich, Connecticut, the eldest of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel&#x27;s eleven children. She is named after her paternal aunt Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington. She is the eldest grandchild of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Kennedy. Kennedy spent her childhood between the family&#x27;s homes in McLean, Virginia and Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. While she was growing up, it was not assumed that the girls in the politically oriented Kennedy family would run for office. However, after her uncle President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, her father wrote her saying, &quot;As the oldest of the next generation you have a particular responsibility. ... Be kind to others and work for your country.&quot; Her family gave her the nicknames &quot;Clean Kathleen&quot;, &quot;the Nun&quot;, and &quot;the Un-Kennedy&quot;.

Over the summer of 1964, Kennedy won four blue ribbons for her &quot;excellence in horsemanship&quot;. On August 29, 1965, the fourteen-year-old Kennedy was somersaulted by her horse while competing at Sea Flash Farms in West Barnstable, Massachusetts. She was left unconscious and bleeding internally and was rushed to Cape Cod Hospital, located fifteen miles away. Her family was en route to Hyannis Port at the time of the incident and was not located for another three hours.

She was sixteen when her father was assassinated. The night he was shot at the Ambassador Hotel, Kennedy and her two eldest brothers, Joseph II and Robert Jr., were being flown to Los Angeles aboard one of the planes in the Secret Service&#x27;s presidential fleet named &quot;the &quot;Jet Star&quot;&quot;.

She was educated at Our Lady of Victory Elementary School in Washington, D.C., and later graduated from The Putney School in Vermont. She attended Radcliffe College of Harvard University, receiving her bachelor&#x27;s degree in history and literature in 1974. She then studied at the University of New Mexico School of Law, receiving her Juris Doctor degree in 1978.

==Early career==
After graduating from law school, Kathleen worked as an attorney at a private law firm, Clendenen &amp; Lesser, in New Haven, Connecticut, while her husband, David Townsend, attended Yale Law School. In 1982, she was admitted to the Massachusetts bar, and worked as a law clerk for U.S. District Court Judge A. David Mazzone. She also worked on her uncle Ted Kennedy&#x27;s 1980 presidential campaign, stumped for local Democrats, and was hired as a policy analyst for Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis in the early 1980s while she and her husband resided in Newton, Massachusetts.

In 1984, the family settled in the Baltimore area, in her husband&#x27;s home state. In 1985, she was admitted to the Maryland bar. In 1986, Townsend became the first Kennedy family member to lose a general election when she ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in Maryland&#x27;s strongly Republican 2nd congressional district, using the name Townsend only. Incumbent Republican Helen Delich Bentley defeated her 59% to 41%.

After her failed congressional bid, Townsend went to work for the state government of Maryland, holding numerous posts including assistant Attorney General. In 1993, Townsend took a job at the U.S. Justice Department overseeing grants to local police departments and community groups.

==Lieutenant governor of Maryland==

===1994 election===

In 1994, Parris Glendening was running for governor in a highly contested primary against then-Lt. Governor Melvin Steinberg when he selected her as his running mate. Experts did not believe she would be an asset, but her name recognition (she now used the name Kennedy Townsend) and her fund-raising skills helped him to win.
In the general election, Glendening and Townsend beat Republican candidate Ellen Sauerbrey in one of Maryland&#x27;s closest and most controversial gubernatorial elections. After unofficial results indicated that Sauerbrey had lost the election by a narrow margin, she began making what &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called &quot;sensational charges&quot; that the election had been stolen. Sauerbrey&#x27;s allegations included ballot box stuffing, 100% voting in one precinct, voting by numerous dead people, and what she called the Kennedy &quot;precedent&quot;—that unproven rumors that John Kennedy had stolen the 1960 Presidential election proved that his niece Townsend had stolen this election.

The official vote tally declared Glendening the winner by 5,993 votes out of 1.4 million. Sauerbrey hired an election specialist known for aggressive tactics then filed a lawsuit alleging that 50,000 votes had been cast illegally. By the time the hearing began in January 1995, however, Sauerbrey had backed away from the fraud charges and her claim centered on sloppy election procedures and 3,600 challenged ballots. The number of challenged ballots would not have been enough to change the result even if all of them were thrown out. The judge ruled that about 1,800 votes had been cast in Baltimore by people whose names should have been purged from the rolls, but said that there was no clear and convincing evidence that fraud or procedural errors had affected the outcome. Sauerbrey dropped the suit three days before Glendening was to be inaugurated, but still maintained her belief that she had won the election.

Sauerbrey ran against Glendening again in 1998, but this time Glendening and Townsend won by a much wider margin (55% to 44%).

===Tenure===
During her tenure as lieutenant governor, Townsend focused on reducing crime and promoting economic development. Under her leadership, Maryland became the first state to require community service as a prerequisite to high school graduation. Townsend&#x27;s &quot;HotSpot Communities Initiative&quot; collaborated with law enforcement and government agencies to design and implement a comprehensive enforcement and prevention strategy at targeted high-crime areas. Her &quot;Break the Cycle&quot; program required offenders on parole or probation to take frequent drug tests.

During the 2000 presidential election, Townsend travelled to Iowa to campaign for Al Gore. 

==2002 gubernatorial election==
In the Maryland gubernatorial election of 2002, Townsend faced Republican Bob Ehrlich and Libertarian Spear Lancaster in the general election.

During the campaign, Townsend was criticized for her choice of running mate, Admiral Charles R. Larson, a novice politician who had switched parties only a few weeks before. Some also criticized the choice of a white male as unlikely to help minority turnout. Ehrlich&#x27;s running mate was Michael Steele, an African-American lawyer who had been chairman of the Republican Party of Maryland.

Though Maryland traditionally votes Democratic and had not elected a Republican governor in almost 40 years, Townsend lost the race, gaining 48% of the vote to Ehrlich&#x27;s 51% and Lancaster&#x27;s 1%. Ehrlich became only the seventh Republican governor in state history. In the end, most observers agreed she ran a weak campaign. They specifically cited a lack of planning, claiming that she hastily booked campaign stops in rural areas hostile to her. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; said the defeat derailed her political career, at least in the short run.

==Post political career==
Townsend, along with siblings Robert, Jr. and Kerry, endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in the 2008 Democratic primaries.

Townsend wrote the book &quot;Failing America&#x27;s Faithful: How Today&#x27;s Churches Are Mixing God with Politics and Losing Their Way&quot;, published in 2007. She also contributes to &quot;The Recovering Politician&quot;, a website started by Jonathan Miller.

She is an adjunct professor at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, a visiting fellow at Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University, and senior Nitze fellow at St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland.

In December 2010, she was appointed chair of American Bridge, a new non-profit that would raise funds for Democratic candidates and causes, and that was intended to be a Democratic counterpart to right-leaning organizations such as American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS. She noted that the Democrats did not have such an organization during the 2010 election cycle, and that Republicans outspent the Democrats by $70 million. &quot;I want to compete dollar to a dollar with the Republicans and I want to beat them&quot;, she said.

Townsend endorsed incumbent Democrat Joe Biden&#x27;s reelection campaign in the 2024 United States presidential election over a third-party/independent challenge by her brother Robert. Four months later, Townsend and four of her siblings endorsed Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris&#x27;s campaign in the 2024 United States presidential election, and denounced their brother Robert Jr.&#x27;s decision to endorse former President Donald Trump, calling the move a &quot;betrayal&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1973, she married David Lee Townsend (born 1947), whom she had met when he was a graduate student and her tutor at Radcliffe. As of April 2020, David is a member of the faculty at St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis. The couple have four daughters:

* Meaghan Anne Kennedy Townsend (born November 7, 1977)
* Maeve Fahey Kennedy Townsend (November 1, 1979 – April 2, 2020)
* Rose Katherine &quot;Kat&quot; Kennedy Townsend (born December 17, 1983)
* Kerry Sophia Kennedy Townsend (born November 30, 1991)

On June 27, 2011, her daughter Maeve gave birth to a son named Gideon Joseph Kennedy McKean. Gideon was the first great-grandchild for Bobby and Ethel, as well as the first of the fifth generation of Kennedys.

Maeve and son Gideon went missing, and were presumed dead, in a canoeing accident that occurred on April 2, 2020. After 26 hours, the recovery mission was suspended. Maeve&#x27;s body was found in the Chesapeake Bay on April 6 and Gideon&#x27;s body was recovered April 8. His body was 2,000 feet from where his mother&#x27;s was found.

==Boards==
She has served on the boards of many organizations, and as a consultant to several corporations. She is the chair of the Institute for Human Virology at the University of Maryland. She is on the boards of directors of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation, the Points of Light Foundation, the Center for American Progress and Catholic Democrats. She was formerly on the independent Advisory Council of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), a panel that was appointed to review the functioning of ACORN following the scandal touched off by hidden camera videos in September 2009, and the board of the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot;. Townsend is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Inter-American Dialogue. She is also on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service. She is on the board of directors at the Lightbridge nuclear fuel technology company.

<doc id="477785" wikidata="Q1932852" url="?curid=477785" title="Dioscorea alata">
<text>Dioscorea alataalso called ube (), ubi, purple yam, or greater yam, among many other namesis a species of yam (a tuber). The tubers are usually a vivid violet-purple to bright lavender in color (hence the common name), but some range in color from cream to plain white. It is sometimes confused with taro and the Okinawa sweet potato (&quot;Ipomoea batatas&quot; cv. Ayamurasaki), however &quot;D. alata&quot; is also grown in Okinawa. With its origins in the Asian and Oceanian tropics, &quot;D. alata&quot; has been known to humans since ancient times.

==Names==
Because it has become naturalized following its origins in Asia, specifically the Philippines, through tropical South America, and the southeastern U.S., &quot;D. alata&quot; is referred to by many different names in these regions. In English alone, aside from purple yam, other common names include ten-months yam, water yam, white yam, winged yam, violet yam, Guyana arrowroot, or simply yam. 
==History of cultivation==

&quot;Dioscorea alata&quot; is one of the most important staple crops in Austronesian cultures. It is one of various species of yams that were domesticated and cultivated independently within Island Southeast Asia and New Guinea for their starchy tubers, including the round yam (&quot;Dioscorea bulbifera&quot;), ubi gadong (&quot;Dioscorea hispida&quot;), lesser yam (&quot;Dioscorea esculenta&quot;), Pacific yam (&quot;Dioscorea nummularia&quot;), fiveleaf yam (&quot;Dioscorea pentaphylla&quot;), and pencil yam (&quot;Dioscorea transversa&quot;). Among these, &quot;D. alata&quot; and &quot;D. esculenta&quot; were the only ones regularly cultivated and eaten, while the rest were usually considered as famine food due to their higher levels of the toxin dioscorine which requires that they be prepared correctly before consumption. &quot;D. alata&quot; is also cultivated more than &quot;D. esculenta&quot;, largely because of its much larger tubers.

&quot;D. alata&quot; and &quot;D. esculenta&quot; were the most suitable for long transport in Austronesian ships and were carried through all or most of the range of the Austronesian expansion. &quot;D. alata&quot; in particular were introduced into the Pacific Islands and New Zealand. They were also carried by Austronesian voyagers into Madagascar and the Comoros.

The center of origin of purple yam is in the Philippines, but archaeological evidence suggests that it was exploited in Island Southeast Asia and New Guinea before the Austronesian expansion. Purple yam is believed to be a true cultigen, only known from its cultivated forms. The vast majority of cultivars are sterile, which restricts its introduction into islands purely by human agency, making them a good indicator of human movement. Some authors have proposed, without evidence, an origin in Mainland Southeast Asia, but it shows the greatest phenotypic variability in the Philippines and New Guinea.

Based on archaeological evidence of early farming plots and plant remains in the Kuk Swamp site, authors have suggested that it was first domesticated in the highlands of New Guinea from around 10,000 BP and spread into Island Southeast Asia via the Lapita culture at around c. 4,000 BP, along with &quot;D. nummularia&quot; and &quot;D. bulbifera&quot;. In turn, &quot;D. esculenta&quot; is believed to have been introduced by the Lapita culture into New Guinea. There is also evidence of an agricultural revolution during this period brought by innovations from contact with Austronesians, including the development of wet cultivation. 

However, much older remains identified as being probably &quot;D. alata&quot; have also been recovered from the Niah Caves of Borneo (Late Pleistocene, &lt;40,000 BP) and the Ille Cave of Palawan (c. 11,000 BP), along with remains of the toxic ubi gadong (&quot;D. hispida&quot;) which requires processing before it can be edible. Although it doesn&#x27;t prove cultivation, it does show that humans already had the knowledge to exploit starchy plants and that &quot;D. alata&quot; were native to Island Southeast Asia. Furthermore, it opens the question on whether &quot;D. alata&quot; is a true species or cultivated much older than believed.

Purple yam remains an important crop in Southeast Asia, particularly in the Philippines where the vividly purple variety is widely used in various traditional and modern desserts. It also remains important in Melanesia, where it is also grown for ceremonial purposes tied to the size of the tubers at harvest time. Its importance in eastern Polynesia and New Zealand, however, has waned after the introduction of other crops, most notably the sweet potato.

==Uses==
===Culinary===
Purple yams have edible tubers which have a mildly sweet, earthy and nutty taste, reminiscent of sweet potatoes or taro. The violet cultivars, in particular, turn dishes distinctively vivid violet because of the high amount of anthocyanins. Purple yams are also valued for the starch that can be processed from them. 
Purple yam is most common in Philippine cuisine (where it is known as &quot;ube&quot; or &quot;ubi&quot;). It is widely applied for many Philippine desserts, such as ube cake, ube cheesecake and ube crinkles, as well as an ingredient or flavor for ice cream, milk, donuts, tarts, jam and other types of pastries. It is often eaten boiled, baked, or as a sweetened dessert called &quot;ube halayá&quot;; the latter being a popular ingredient in the iced dessert called &quot;halo-halo&quot;. Purple yam desserts have more recently entered the United States through Philippine cuisine, under the Filipino name &quot;ube&quot;. It is particularly popular due to the striking violet-purple color it gives to desserts.

Purple yam is commonly confused with purple/violet varieties of sweet potatoes because of their similarities in color, taste, and culinary uses. However, like other yams, purple yam tends to have a moister texture than sweet potatoes. Purple yams also have higher anthocyanin content than sweet potatoes. They can otherwise be used interchangeably in most recipes.

===Supplements, folk medicine and adverse effects===
Although available as a dietary supplement and used in folk medicine, there is no clinical evidence that &quot;D. alata&quot; has any therapeutic properties. Use of &quot;D. alata&quot; supplements may have adverse effects in people taking estrogens, anticoagulant drugs or during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Some people may have allergic reactions to use of &quot;D. alata&quot; supplements.

&quot;D. alata&quot; has relatively high levels of oxalates (486–781 mg/100 g dry matter), which are associated with antinutritional effects and kidney stone formation.

===Other uses===
The color of purple varieties is due to various anthocyanin pigments. The pigments are water-soluble, and have been proposed as possible food coloring agents. &quot;D. alata&quot; is sometimes grown in gardens for its ornamental value.

==As an invasive species==
&quot;Dioscorea alata&quot; is native to the Philippines, as well as surrounding areas (Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands of Japan). It has escaped from its native growth area and into the wild in many other places, becoming naturalized in parts of southern and east-central China, Africa and Madagascar, the Western Hemisphere, and various islands in the Indian and Pacific oceans. It persists in the wild in Haiti, as well as the United States, in Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and in Florida where it is considered an invasive species.

<doc id="477787" wikidata="Q3490568" url="?curid=477787" title="Battle of Tirad Pass">
<text>The Battle of Tirad Pass, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Philippine Thermopylae&quot;, took place during the Philippine–American War on December 2, 1899, in northern Luzon in the Philippines. A 60-man Filipino rear guard commanded by Brigadier General Gregorio del Pilar succumbed to more than 500 Americans, mostly of the 33rd Volunteer Infantry Regiment under Major Peyton C. March, while delaying the American advance to ensure that President Emilio Aguinaldo and his troops escaped.

==Background==
The retreat of Aguinaldo from Bayambang, through the mountainous terrain began on November 13, 1899, after he had disbanded the regular Filipino army into guerrilla units. On November 23, Aguinaldo&#x27;s party reached the pass, which provided a strategic bottleneck. It was to be protected by a rear guard under General Gregorio del Pilar, who noticed the advantageous terrain of Tirad Pass (&quot;Pasong Tirad&quot; as it was locally called), and hunkered down to defend it while Aguinaldo escaped through the mountains. The hand-picked force of Filipinos, which was the remaining contingent of Antonio Luna&#x27;s army, constructed several sets of trenches and stone barricades on both shoulders of the pass, as well as on top of its height. Meanwhile, during early November, Major March had been given the task of pursuing Aguinaldo. By November 30, March and his men, in haste to catch the Philippine president, marched through Candon, Santo Tomas, La Union, and Salcedo, Ilocos Sur. He and his men found out that Aguinaldo had passed through Salcedo five days previously, and that fueled the Americans&#x27; march to Concepcion (now named Gregorio del Pilar), a town overlooked by the steep pass, which they reached by December 1. March had no clear idea of the size of Aguinaldo&#x27;s rear guard, but he had calculated it to be no more than 150 men.

==Battle==
On the morning of December 2, the Americans advanced up the trail but were met with a steady volley of fire, enabling them to climb to only around 300 feet. The Americans abandoned the idea of a frontal assault and took cover in the zigzag trail. Texan sharpshooters positioned themselves on a hill overlooking the trenches, whittling down the Philippine rear guard with measured volleys. Nevertheless, the Filipinos continued to hold their ground, utilizing focused volley fire that repelled other advances by the Americans. March then sent elements of their force with an Igorot villager named Januario Galut to determine the Filipino positions and outflank the defenders. While the flanking movement was still in progress, three American soldiers rushed to the battlefield but found themselves receiving Filipino fire. Two died, being the only Americans killed in the encounter, while the third was badly wounded.

More than five hours after the battle began, the Americans began to feel the scorching heat of the midday sun and decided to rest for a while amidst the rocks. Later that day, the flanking party succeeded in their task, and the Americans fell upon the rear of the outnumbered defenders, defeating them. Over the course of the battle, 52 of the 60 Filipinos were killed. Among the dead was General del Pilar, shot through the neck at the height or end of the struggle (depending upon which eye-witness account is to be believed).

==Aftermath==
The Americans lost two dead and nine wounded, most of which resulted from the repelled frontal assault. Despite nearly total annihilation, however, the Filipinos under Del Pilar held off the Americans long enough for Aguinaldo to escape. Among the 60 Filipino soldiers, only eight survived, namely Colonel Vicente Enriquez, Captain Juan H. Del Pilar, Lieutenant Telesforo Pérez Carrasco, Lieutenant José Enriquez, &quot;Juanchito&quot; Del Pilar, Emilio Garcia, Iñigo De Jesus, and one unnamed officer. Upon receiving word of the battle outcome from Lieutenant José Enriquez (Colonel Enriquez&#x27;s younger brother) and &quot;Juanchito&quot; Del Pilar (General Gregorio Del Pilar&#x27;s cousin) in nearby Cervantes, Ilocos Sur, Aguinaldo and his party resumed their retreat into the mountains of what was then Bontoc province, pursued by March and his men. March broke off the pursuit on March 7. On September 6, 1900, Aguinaldo reached Palanan, Isabela, where he continued to lead the guerrilla campaign he had begun on November 13, 1899. He was captured there on March 23, 1901, by men of General Frederick Funston.

According to Filipino writer and historian Nick Joaquin, however, the main objective of the Americans was not to pursue Aguinaldo but to keep him away from linking up with the elite Tinio Brigade, which was under the command of Manuel Tinio. In his critical book of essays &quot;A Question of Heroes&quot; he notes that Tirad Pass was an &quot;exercise in futility&quot; in that it only allowed Aguinaldo to &quot;run to nowhere&quot;.

Del Pilar&#x27;s diary was recovered among the possessions looted by the victorious Americans, who had stripped him bare of his military decorations, his uniform and his personal belongings, leaving him, as the eyewitness, correspondent Richard Henry Little wrote, &quot;We carved not a line and we raised not a stone, But we left him alone with his glory&quot;. The exact wording of its poignant final entry, written on the night of December 1, differs somewhat between sources quoting it. Two versions are:

Del Pilar&#x27;s corpse lay unburied for three days. American officer Dennis Quinlan, with a group of Igorots, later buried his body and left a plaque, &quot;Gen. Gregorio del Pilar, Died December 2, 1899, Commanding Aguinaldo&#x27;s Rear Guard, An Officer and a Gentleman.&quot;

==Memorials==
In honor of Del Pilar&#x27;s heroism, the Philippine Military Academy was named Fort Del Pilar and a historical marker placed at the site of the battle.

The Battle of Tirad Pass and the death of Del Pilar was also commemorated during World War II when the Japanese-backed government of President José P. Laurel sought to re-kindle anti-American sentiment by reviving memories of the Philippine–American War with the creation of the Tirad Pass Medal. The design of the obverse (front) of the medal included a bust of Del Pilar and a view of Tirad Pass. The design of the reverse (back) includes the date 1944. The Tirad Pass Medal was the only military medal or decoration issued by the Laurel government during the Japanese occupation.

In 1955, the town where the battle happened, Concepcion, was renamed Gregorio del Pilar, Ilocos Sur.

<text>The Zeiformes are a small order of exclusively marine ray-finned fishes most notable for the dories, a group of common food fish. The order consists of about 33 species in six extant families, mostly deep-sea types. The boarfishes (Caproidae) have been previously included in this order though they are currently included in the Perciformes.

Zeiform bodies are usually thin and deep. Mouths are large, with distensible jaws, and there is no orbitosphenoid. Pelvic fins have 5–10 soft rays and possibly a spine, 5–10 dorsal fin spines and up to 4 anal fin spines. They range in size from the dwarf dory &quot;(Macrurocyttus acanthopodus)&quot;, at in length, to the Cape dory &quot;(Zeus capensis)&quot;, which measures up to .

The earliest known member of the order is &quot;Cretazeus&quot; from the Late Cretaceous (late Campanian or early Maastrichtian) of Nardò, Italy. Uniquely, despite its age, &quot;Cretazeus&quot; is thought to be a derived crown-group zeiform closely related to the Parazenidae (in contrast, the two most basal zeiform families are known from later, during the early Paleogene). This suggests that at least six lineages of zeiforms were present during the Late Cretaceous and survived the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction, despite this not being preserved in the fossil record. Aside from &quot;Cretazeus&quot;, an earlier record of the zeiforms is an indeterminate fossil otolith (&quot;genus Zeiformomum&quot; &quot;tyleri&quot;) from the Santonian of Spain, but its specific affinities remain uncertain. A potentially older genus, &quot;Palaeocyttus&quot; of Portugal, is known only from a poorly-preserved specimen and may not be a zeiform.

<text>A hamada (, ) is a type of desert landscape consisting of high, largely barren, hard rocky (basalt) plateaus, where most of the sand has been removed by deflation. The majority of the Sahara is hamada. Other examples are Negev desert in Israel and the in Algeria.

==Formation==
Hamadas are produced by the wind, which removes the fine products of weathering, an aeolian process known as deflation. The finer-grained products are taken away in suspension. At the same time, the sand is removed through saltation and surface creep, leaving behind a landscape of gravel, boulders and bare rock.

==Related landforms==
Hamada is related to desert pavement (known variously as reg, serir, gibber, or saï), which occurs as stony plains or depressions covered with gravels or boulders rather than as highland plateaus.

Hamadas exist in contrast to &quot;ergs&quot;, which are large areas of shifting sand dunes.

<text>The was a Japanese jet fighter/attack aircraft project designed during the final stages of World War II but which was not built.

==Development==
The unrelated and much smaller Nakajima Kikka had been developed as a result of interest by the Navy in an equivalent to the German Messerschmitt Me 262, but the similarities to that aircraft were very limited. On the other hand, the design team led by Iwao Shibuya based the &quot;Karyū&quot; more closely on the German aircraft, but was over 8% larger.

The Ki-201 project was ordered by the Imperial Japanese Army in late 1944, with a performance requirement of an top speed, ceiling, and a range. The design was developed by Nakajima during 1945 and basic drawings were completed by June.

Nakajima anticipated the completion of the first prototype &quot;Karyū&quot; by December, and the first 18 pre-production aircraft by March 1946. Work on the first airframe had not started when Japan surrendered.

<text>The Macau Jockey Club (MJC; , Portuguese: Jockey Clube de Macau) was an organization providing horse racing and betting entertainment in Macau, China. At its peak, the Club was one of the largest private employers of Macau with around 1,400 employees and around 1,100 part-timers.

The Macau Jockey Club ceased operation on April 1, 2024, with the final meeting held at Taipa Racecourse two days earlier on March 30, 2024. 

==History==
The club began as the Macau Trotting Club in 1980 in an attempt to introduce harness racing in Asia, but it was not a popular sporting event and gave way to the formation of the current thoroughbred racing club in 1989.

The Macau Jockey Club ceased operation on April 1, 2024, with the final meeting held at Taipa Racecourse two days earlier on March 30, 2024. Plummeting wagering turnover and a substantial reduction in the horse population meant that the Club was no longer economically viable. The Macau Jockey Club halted its operations six months before its close partner, the Singapore Turf Club, was also due to close its doors.

==Taipa Racecourse==

The Macau Jockey Club has one track on Taipa converted from the old trotting track. The old track is now the inner sand track and the newer outer track is turf. The track has a grandstand seating area for 15000 spectators and Race Complex for 3000. 

The main stables at the MJC can house 1183 horses, 60 at a quarantine stable and 28 at spelling stables. The track has an equine hospital to handle minor care to surgery.

<doc id="477804" wikidata="Q217249" url="?curid=477804" title="Sublimation (psychology)">
<text>In psychology, sublimation is a mature type of defense mechanism, in which socially unacceptable impulses or idealizations are transformed into socially acceptable actions or behavior, possibly resulting in a long-term conversion of the initial impulse.

Sigmund Freud believed that sublimation was a sign of maturity and civilization, allowing people to function normally in culturally acceptable ways. He defined sublimation as the process of deflecting sexual instincts into acts of higher social valuation, being &quot;an especially conspicuous feature of cultural development; it is what makes it possible for higher psychical activities, scientific, artistic or ideological, to play such an &#x27;important&#x27; part in civilized life.&quot;

Psychology textbooks present a similar view, stating that sublimation is &quot;translating a distressing desire into an acceptable form.&quot; It occurs when displacement involves &quot;the transformation of sexual or aggressive energies into culturally acceptable, even admirable, behaviors,&quot; and &quot;serves a higher cultural or socially useful purpose, as in the creation of art or inventions&quot;

== Nietzsche ==
In the opening section of &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot; entitled &quot;Of first and last things&quot;, Friedrich Nietzsche wrote:
There is, strictly speaking, neither unselfish conduct, nor a wholly disinterested point of view. Both are simply sublimations in which the basic element seems almost evaporated and betrays its presence only to the keenest observation. All that we need and that could possibly be given us in the present state of development of the sciences, is a chemistry of the moral, religious, aesthetic conceptions and feeling, as well as of those emotions which we experience in the affairs, great and small, of society and civilization, and which we are sensible of even in solitude. But what if this chemistry established the fact that, even in its domain, the most magnificent results were attained with the basest and most despised ingredients? Would many feel disposed to continue such investigations? Mankind loves to put by the questions of its origin and beginning: must one not be almost inhuman in order to follow the opposite course?

=== Psychoanalytic theory ===
In Freud&#x27;s psychoanalytical theory, erotic energy is allowed a limited amount of expression, owing to the constraints of human society and civilization itself. It therefore requires other outlets, especially if an individual is to remain psychologically balanced. The ego must act as a mediator between the moral norms of the super-ego, the realistic expectations of reality, and the drives and impulses of the id. One method by which the ego lessens the stress that unacceptably strong urges or emotions can cause is through sublimation.

Sublimation () is the process of transforming libido into &quot;socially useful&quot; achievements, including artistic, cultural, and intellectual pursuits. Freud considered this psychical operation to be fairly salutary compared to the others that he identified, such as repression, displacement, denial, reaction formation, intellectualisation, and projection. In &quot;The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence&quot; (1936), his daughter, Anna, classed sublimation as one of the major &#x27;defence mechanisms&#x27; of the psyche.

Freud developed his idea of sublimation while reading &quot;The Harz Journey&quot; by Heinrich Heine. The story is about Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach, who cut off the tails of dogs he encountered in childhood and later became a surgeon. Freud concluded that sublimation could be a conflict between the need for satisfaction and the need for security without perturbation of awareness. In an action performed many times throughout one&#x27;s life, which firstly appears sadistic, thought is ultimately refined into an activity which is of benefit to mankind.

=== Sexual sublimation ===
Sexual sublimation was, according to Freud, a deflection of sexual instincts into non-sexual activity, based upon a principle akin to the conservation of energy in physics. There is a finite amount of activity, and it is converted, in a mechanistic fashion like a mechanical engine, from sexual activity to non-sexual. One such example is the case of Wolf Man, a case in which a young boy&#x27;s sexual attraction to his father was redirected toward Christianity and eventually led the boy to obsessional neurosis in the form of uncontrollable sacrilegious reverence. Freud travelled to Clark University to speak about instances of sexual sublimation, but he was not wholly convinced of his own theories. 20th century psychological thought by the likes of Melanie Klein has largely relegated the idea and replaced it with subtler ideas. One such idea is that the sexual desires are not made totally non-sexual, but rather transformed into a more appropriate desire.

The concept is superficially evident, and anecdotal examples abound across time, occupation, and culture of origin (e.g. Renoir &quot;painting with his cock&quot;, Wayland Young stating that &quot;love&#x27;s loss is empire&#x27;s gain&quot;, Lawrence Stone&#x27;s view that Western civilization has achieved so much because of sublimation, and the claims by biographers of many people from Higgins on Rider Haggard to Sinclair on George Grey). Sexual sublimation is, however, ill-defined and comes with the caveats that it rarely happens in practice, that many outcomes attributed to it are actually the results of other motivations, and that it is most definitely not some quasi-physical transfer of some sort of &quot;sexual energy&quot; in the modern psychoanalytical view but rather an internal thought process.

== Jung ==

C. G. Jung argued that Freud&#x27;s opinion:
...can only be based on the totally erroneous supposition that the unconscious is a monster. It is a view that springs from fear of nature and the realities of life. Freud invented the idea of sublimation to save us from the imaginary claws of the unconscious. But what is real, what actually exists, cannot be alchemically sublimated, and if anything is apparently sublimated it never was what a false interpretation took it to be.

In the same article, Jung went on to suggest that unconscious processes became dangerous only to the extent that people repress them. The more people come to assimilate and recognize the unconscious, the less of a danger it becomes. In this view sublimation requires not repression of drives through will, but acknowledgement of the creativity of unconscious processes and a learning of how to work with them.

This differs fundamentally from Freud&#x27;s view of the concept. For Freud, sublimation helped explain the plasticity of the sexual instincts (and their convertibility to non-sexual ends) - see libido. The concept also underpinned Freud&#x27;s psychoanalytical theories, which showed the human psyche at the mercy of conflicting impulses (such as the super-ego and the id). In his private letters, Jung criticized Freud for obscuring the alchemical origins of sublimation and for attempting instead to make the concept appear scientifically credible:
 Sublimation is part of the royal art where the true gold is made. Of this Freud knows nothing; worse still, he barricades all the paths that could lead to true sublimation. This is just about the opposite of what Freud understands by sublimation. It is not a voluntary and forcible channeling of instinct into a spurious field of application, but an alchymical transformation for which fire and prima materia are needed. Sublimation is a great mystery. Freud has appropriated this concept and usurped it for the sphere of the will and the bourgeois, rationalistic ethos.

== Lacan ==

=== &quot;Das Ding&quot; ===

The French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan&#x27;s exposition of sublimation is framed within a discussion about the relationship of psychoanalysis and ethics within the seventh book of his seminars. Lacanian sublimation is defined with reference to the concept &quot;Das Ding&quot; (later in his career Lacan termed this &quot;objet petit a&quot;); &quot;Das Ding&quot; is German for &quot;the thing&quot; though Lacan conceives it as an abstract notion and one of the defining characteristics of the human condition. Broadly speaking it is the vacuum one experiences as a human being and which one endeavours to fill with differing human relationships, objects and experiences, all of which are used to plug a gap in one&#x27;s psychical needs. Unfortunately, all attempts to overcome the vacuity of &quot;Das Ding&quot; are insufficient in wholly satisfying the individual. For this reason, Lacan also considers &quot;Das Ding&quot; to be a non-Thing or vacuole.

Lacan considers &quot;Das Ding&quot; a lost object ever in the process of being recuperated by Man. Temporarily the individual will be duped by his or her own psyche into believing that this object, this person or this circumstance can be relied upon to satisfy his needs in a stable and enduring manner when in fact it is in its nature that the object as such is lost—and will never be found again. Something is there while one waits for something better, or worse, but which one wants, and again &quot;Das Ding&quot; &quot;is to be found at most as something missed. One doesn&#x27;t find it, but only its pleasurable associations.&quot; Human life unravels as a series of detours in the quest for the lost object or the absolute Other of the individual: &quot;The pleasure principle governs the search for the object and imposes detours which maintain the distance to &quot;Das Ding&quot; in relation to its end.&quot;

=== Lacanian sublimation ===

Lacanian sublimation centres to a large part on the notion of &quot;Das Ding&quot;. His general formula for sublimation is that &quot;it raises an object ... to the dignity of The Thing.&quot; Lacan considers these objects (whether human, aesthetic, credal, or philosophical) to be signifiers which are representative of &quot;Das Ding&quot; and that &quot;the function of the pleasure principle is, in effect, to lead the subject from signifier to signifier, by generating as many signifiers as are required to maintain at as low a level as possible the tension that regulates the whole functioning of the psychic apparatus.&quot; Furthermore, man is the &quot;artisan of his support system&quot;, in other words, he creates or finds the signifiers which delude him into believing he has overcome the emptiness of &quot;Das Ding&quot;.

Lacan also considers sublimation to be a process of creation &quot;ex nihilo&quot; (creating out of nothing), whereby an object, human or manufactured, comes to be defined in relation to the emptiness of &quot;Das Ding&quot;. Lacan&#x27;s prime example of this is the courtly love of the troubadours and &quot;Minnesänger&quot; who dedicated their poetic verse to a love-object which was not only unreachable (and therefore experienced as something missing) but whose existence and desirability also centered around a hole (the vagina). For Lacan such courtly love was &quot;a paradigm of sublimation.&quot; He affirms that the word &#x27;troubadour&#x27; is etymologically linked to the Provençal verb &quot;trobar&quot; (like the French &quot;trouver&quot;), &quot;to find&quot;. If we consider again the definition of &quot;Das Ding&quot;, it is dependent precisely on the expectation of the subject to re-find the lost object in the mistaken belief that it will continue to satisfy him (or her).

Lacan maintains that creation &quot;ex nihilo&quot; operates in other noteworthy fields as well. In pottery for example vases are created around an empty space. They are primitive and even primordial artifacts which have benefited mankind not only in the capacity of utensils but also as metaphors of (cosmic) creation &quot;ex nihilo&quot;. Lacan cites Heidegger who situates the vase between the earthly (raising clay from the ground) and the ethereal (pointing upwards to receive). In architecture, Lacan asserts, buildings are designed around an empty space and in art paintings proceed from an empty canvas, and often depict empty spaces through perspective.

In myth, Pan pursues the nymph Syrinx who is transformed into hollow reeds in order to avoid the clutches of the god, who subsequently cuts the reeds down in anger and transforms them into what we today call panpipes (both reeds and panpipes rely on their hollowness for the production of sound).

Lacan briefly remarks that religion and science are also based around emptiness. In regard to religion, Lacan refers the reader to Freud, stating that much obsessional religious behavior can be attributed to the avoidance of the primordial emptiness of &quot;Das Ding&quot; or in the respecting of it. As for the discourse of science this is based on the notion of &quot;Verwerfung&quot; (the German word for &quot;dismissal&quot;) which results in the dismissing, foreclosing or exclusion of the notion of &quot;Das Ding&quot; presumably because it defies empirical categorisation.

==Empirical research==

A study by Kim, Zeppenfeld, and Cohen studied sublimation by empirical methods.
These investigators view their research, published 2013 in the &quot;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&quot;, as providing &quot;possibly the first experimental evidence for sublimation and [suggesting] a cultural psychological approach to defense mechanisms.&quot;

==Religious and spiritual views==

=== Judaism ===
In the ethics tractate known as Pirkei Avot (4:1), the Jewish scholar Shimon ben Zoma writes that true strength is found in the sublimation of evil inclinations into self-control, and true richness is found in the sublimation of desire for more into gratitude for what is already possessed.

As espoused in its foundational text, the &quot;Tanya&quot;, the Chabad Lubavitcher sect of Judaism views sublimation of the animal soul as an essential task in life, wherein the goal is to transform animalistic and earthy cravings for physical pleasure into holy desires to connect with God.&quot;&quot;

Several scholars propose that Freud&#x27;s Jewish background was central to his development of psychoanalytic theory. 

=== Non-Western Thought ===
Different schools of thought describe general sexual urges as carriers of spiritual essence, and have the varied names of vital energy, vital winds (prana), spiritual energy, ojas, shakti, tummo, or kundalini.

In Tantric sex, sexual energies and practices may be considered spiritual offerings. These sexual energies (eros) serve as substitution for sacrifices to deities (thanatos)
== In fiction ==

*One of the best-known examples in Western literature is in Thomas Mann&#x27;s novella, &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, in which the protagonist Gustav von Aschenbach, a famous writer, sublimates his desire for an adolescent boy into writing poetry.
* In &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; by Neal Stephenson, sublimation is presented as the source of the Neo-Victorians&#x27; dominance: &quot;...it was precisely their emotional repression that made the Victorians the richest and most powerful people in the world. Their ability to submerge their feelings, far from pathological, was rather a kind of mystical art that gave them nearly magical power over Nature and over the more intuitive tribes. Such was also the strength of the Nipponese.&quot;
*In &quot;Sensation and Sublimation in Charles Dickens&quot;, author John Gordon posits that Dickens was inspired by his subconscious collective milieu; his reflections on social issues were sublimated into aspects of his literary works. For example, Dickens was not overtly antisemitic, but he sublimated the antisemitism and Blood Libel tropes of his day and expressed them in the stereotypical caricature of Fagin in &quot;Oliver Twist.&quot;
*In &quot;Henry James&#x27;s Thwarted Love&quot;, author Wendy Graham argues that much of Henry James&#x27;s work can be understood as an expression of how his sexuality differed from Victorian norms; his sublimation of desire into fiction was a form of self-discipline.

<doc id="477808" wikidata="Q185600" url="?curid=477808" title="Portico">
<text>A portico is a porch leading to the entrance of a building, or extended as a colonnade, with a roof structure over a walkway, supported by columns or enclosed by walls. This idea was widely used in ancient Greece and has influenced many cultures, including most Western cultures.

Porticos are sometimes topped with pediments. 
Palladio was a pioneer of using temple-fronts for secular buildings. In the UK, the temple-front applied to The Vyne, Hampshire, was the first portico applied to an English country house.

A pronaos ( or ) is the inner area of the portico of a Greek or Roman temple, situated between the portico&#x27;s colonnade or walls and the entrance to the &quot;cella&quot;, or shrine. Roman temples commonly had an open pronaos, usually with only columns and no walls, and the pronaos could be as long as the &quot;cella&quot;. The word &quot;pronaos&quot; () is Greek for &quot;before a temple&quot;. In Latin, a pronaos is also referred to as an &quot;anticum&quot; or &quot;prodomus&quot;. The pronaos of a Greek and Roman temple is typically topped with a pediment.

== Types ==
The different variants of porticos are named by the number of columns they have. The &quot;style&quot; suffix comes from the Greek , &quot;column&quot;. In Greek and Roman architecture, the pronaos of a temple is typically topped with a pediment.

=== Tetrastyle ===
The tetrastyle has four columns; it was commonly employed by the Greeks and the Etruscans for small structures such as public buildings and amphiprostyles.

The Romans favoured the four columned portico for their pseudoperipteral temples like the Temple of Portunus, and for amphiprostyle temples such as the Temple of Venus and Roma, and for the prostyle entrance porticos of large public buildings like the Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine. Roman provincial capitals also manifested tetrastyle construction, such as the Capitoline Temple in Volubilis.

The North Portico of the White House is perhaps the most notable four-columned portico in the United States.

=== Hexastyle ===
Hexastyle buildings had six columns and were the standard façade in canonical Greek Doric architecture between the archaic period 600–550 BCE up to the Age of Pericles 450–430 BCE.

==== Greek hexastyle ====
Some well-known examples of classical Doric hexastyle Greek temples:

* The group at Paestum comprising the Temple of Hera (&quot;c.&quot; 550 BCE), the Temple of Apollo (&quot;c.&quot; 450 BCE), the first Temple of Athena (&quot;Basilica&quot;) (&quot;c.&quot; 500 BCE) and the second Temple of Hera (460–440 BCE)
* The Temple of Aphaea at Aegina &quot;c.&quot; 495 BCE
* Temple E at Selinus (465–450 BCE) dedicated to Hera
* The Temple of Zeus at Olympia, now a ruin
* Temple F or the so-called &quot;Temple of Concordia&quot; at Agrigentum (&quot;c.&quot; 430 BCE), one of the best-preserved classical Greek temples, retaining almost all of its peristyle and entablature
* The &quot;unfinished temple&quot; at Segesta (&quot;c.&quot; 430 BCE)
* The Temple of Hephaestus below the Acropolis at Athens, long known as the &quot;Theseum&quot; (449–444 BCE), also one of the most intact Greek temples surviving from antiquity
* The Temple of Poseidon on Cape Sunium (&quot;c.&quot; 449 BCE)

Hexastyle was also applied to Ionic temples, such as the prostyle porch of the sanctuary of Athena on the Erechtheum, at the Acropolis of Athens.

==== Roman hexastyle ====
With the colonization by the Greeks of Southern Italy, hexastyle was adopted by the Etruscans and subsequently acquired by the ancient Romans. Roman taste favoured narrow pseudoperipteral and amphiprostyle buildings with tall columns, raised on podiums for the added pomp and grandeur conferred by considerable height. The Maison Carrée at Nîmes, France, is the best-preserved Roman hexastyle temple surviving from antiquity.

=== Octastyle ===
Octastyle buildings had eight columns; they were considerably rarer than the hexastyle ones in the classical Greek architectural canon. The best-known octastyle buildings surviving from antiquity are the Parthenon in Athens, built during the Age of Pericles (450–430 BCE), and the Pantheon in Rome (125 CE). The destroyed Temple of Divus Augustus in Rome, the centre of the Augustan cult, is shown on Roman coins of the 2nd century CE as having been built in octastyle.

=== Decastyle ===
The decastyle has ten columns; as in the temple of Apollo Didymaeus at Miletus, and the portico of University College London.

The only known Roman decastyle portico is on the Temple of Venus and Roma, built by Hadrian in about 130 CE.

<doc id="477815" wikidata="Q470970" url="?curid=477815" title="Lemuria">
<text>Lemuria (), or Limuria, was a continent proposed in 1864 by zoologist Philip Sclater, theorized to have sunk beneath the Indian Ocean, later appropriated by occultists in supposed accounts of human origins. The theory was discredited with the discovery of plate tectonics and continental drift in the 20th century.

The hypothesis was proposed as an explanation for the presence of lemur fossils on Madagascar and the Indian subcontinent but not in continental Africa or the Middle East. Biologist Ernst Haeckel&#x27;s suggestion in 1870 that Lemuria could be the ancestral home of humans caused the hypothesis to move beyond the scope of geology and zoogeography, ensuring its popularity outside of the framework of the scientific community.

Occultist and founder of theosophy Helena Blavatsky, during the latter part of the 19th century, placed Lemuria in the system of her mystical-religious doctrine, claiming that this continent was the homeland of the human ancestors, whom she called Lemurians. The writings of Blavatsky had a significant impact on Western esotericism, popularizing the myth of Lemuria and its mystical inhabitants.

Theories about Lemuria became untenable when, in the 1960s, the scientific community accepted Alfred Wegener&#x27;s theory of continental drift, presented in 1912, but the idea lived on in the popular imagination, especially in relation to the Theosophist tradition.

== Evolution of the idea ==
Lemuria was hypothesized as a land bridge, now sunken, which would account for certain discontinuities in biogeography. This idea has been rendered obsolete by modern theories of plate tectonics. Sunken continents such as Zealandia in the Pacific, and Mauritia and the Kerguelen Plateau in the Indian Ocean do exist, but no geological formation under the Indian or Pacific oceans is known that could have served as a land bridge between these continents.

The idea of Lemuria was later incorporated into the philosophy of Theosophy and has persisted as a theme in pseudoarchaeology and discussions of lost lands. There is a vast fringe literature pertaining to Lemuria and to related concepts such as the Lemurian Fellowship and other things &quot;Lemurian&quot;. All share a common belief that a continent existed in what is now either the Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean in ancient times and claim that it became submerged as a result of a geological cataclysm. An important element of the mythology of Lemuria is that it was the location of the emergence of complex knowledge systems that formed the basis for later beliefs.

The concept of Lemuria was developed in detail by James Churchward, who referred to it as Mu and identified it as a lost continent in the Pacific Ocean. Churchward appropriated this name from Augustus Le Plongeon, who had used the concept of the &quot;Land of Mu&quot; to refer to the legendary lost continent of Atlantis. Churchward&#x27;s books included &quot;The Lost Continent of Mu, the Motherland of Men&quot; (1926), &quot;The Children of Mu&quot; (1931), &quot;The Sacred Symbols of Mu&quot; (1933), &quot;Cosmic Forces of Mu&quot; (1934), and &quot;Second Book of Cosmic Forces of Mu&quot; (1935). The relationships between Lemuria/Mu and Atlantis are discussed in detail in the book &quot;Lost Continents: The Atlantis Theme in History, Science, and Literature&quot; (1954) by L. Sprague de Camp.

==Scientific origins==
===Postulation===
In 1864, &quot;The Mammals of Madagascar&quot; by zoologist and biogeographer Philip Sclater appeared in &quot;The Quarterly Journal of Science&quot;. Using a classification he referred to as lemurs, but which included related primate groups, and puzzled by the presence of their fossils in Madagascar and India, but not in Africa or the Middle East, Sclater proposed that Madagascar and India had once been part of a larger continent (he was correct in this; though in reality this was Mauritia and the supercontinent Gondwana).

The anomalies of the mammal fauna of Madagascar can best be explained by supposing that... a large continent occupied parts of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans... that this continent was broken up into islands, of which some have become amalgamated with... Africa, some... with what is now Asia; and that in Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands we have existing relics of this great continent, for which... I should propose the name Lemuria!

===Parallels===
Sclater&#x27;s theory was hardly unusual for his time; &quot;land bridges&quot;, real and imagined, fascinated several of Sclater&#x27;s contemporaries. Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, also looking at the relationship between animals in India and Madagascar, had suggested a southern continent about two decades before Sclater, but did not give it a name. The acceptance of Darwinism led scientists to seek to trace the diffusion of species from their points of evolutionary origin. Before the acceptance of continental drift, biologists frequently postulated the existence of submerged land masses to account for populations of land-based species now separated by barriers of water. Similarly, geologists tried to account for striking resemblances of rock formations on different continents. The first systematic attempt was made by Melchior Neumayr in his book &quot;Erdgeschichte&quot; in 1887. Many hypothetical submerged land bridges and continents were proposed during the 19th century to account for the present distribution of species.

===Promulgation===

After gaining some acceptance within the scientific community, the concept of Lemuria began to appear in the works of other scholars. Ernst Haeckel, a Darwinian taxonomist, proposed Lemuria as an explanation for the absence of proto-human &quot;missing links&quot; in the fossil record. According to another source, Haeckel put forward this thesis before Sclater, without using the name &quot;Lemuria&quot;.

===Supersession===
The Lemuria theory disappeared completely from conventional scientific consideration after the theories of plate tectonic and continental drift were accepted by the larger scientific community. According to the theory of plate tectonics, Madagascar and India were indeed once part of the same landmass (thus accounting for geological resemblances), but plate movement caused India to break away millions of years ago, and move to its present location. The original landmass, Mauritia and the supercontinent Gondwana prior to that, broke apart; it predominantly did not sink beneath sea level.

== Kumari Kandam ==

Some Tamil writers such as Devaneya Pavanar have associated Lemuria with Kumari Kandam, a legendary sunken landmass mentioned in the Tamil literature, claiming that it was the cradle of civilization. A Tamil commentator, Adiyarkunallar, described the dimensions that extended between the Pahrali River and the Kumari River in the Pandyan country that was taken over by the ocean later on.

==In popular culture==
Since the 1880s, the concept of Lemuria has had a prominent place in the mythology of Theosophy, anthroposophy and other occult beliefs, inspiring many novels, television shows, films, and music. These are not scientific ideas, but fall within the realm of pseudoarchaeology and popular culture.

=== Australia ===
Blavatsky claimed that Australia was a remnant inland region of Lemuria and that Aboriginal Australians and Aboriginal Tasmanians (which she identified as separate groups) were of Lemurian and Lemuro-Atlantean origin, after cross-breeding with animals. Her idea was subsequently developed in pseudo-histories and fiction of the white Australian popular culture of the 1890s and early 1900s, including the writings of nationalist Australian poet Bernard O&#x27;Dowd, author Rosa Campbell Praed in &quot;My Australian Girlhood,&quot; author John David Hennessey in &quot;An Australian Bush Track&quot; and George Firth Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last Lemurian: A Westralian Romance.&quot;

Robert Dixon suggests that the popularity of the idea of &quot;lost races&quot; like Lemurians and Atlanteans reflected the anxieties of colonial Australians, that &quot;when Englishness is lost there is nothing to replace it&quot;. A. L. McCann attributes Praed&#x27;s use of the Lemuria trope to an &quot;attempt to create a lineage for white settlers without having to confront the annihilation of Indigenous people&quot;.

=== Telos Mount Shasta ===

In 1894, Frederick Spencer Oliver published &quot;A Dweller on Two Planets&quot;, an occult book which claimed that survivors from Lemuria were living in a complex of tunnels beneath the mountain of Mount Shasta in northern California. This city, known as &quot;Telos: City of Light&quot; boasted fur-lined carpeted floors and jeweled walls, all signs of opulence. Spencer also claimed that Lemurians could be seen walking the surface in white robes. In 1931, Harvey Spencer Lewis, who went by the pseudonym Wishar Spenle Cerve wrote &quot;Lemuria: the Lost Continent of the Pacific&quot;, which popularized the idea that Shasta was a repository for Lemurians. 

In the 1930s, Guy Warren Ballard claimed to have been approached by Saint Germain who told him he could endow him with knowledge and wisdom. Ballard wrote and published the book &quot;Unveiled Mysteries&quot; under the alias Godfré Ray King, where Ballard claimed to be the person that Saint Germain was speaking through to get to the world. The belief in Telos has been proliferated by Ballard and his followers, as well as other religious groups like the Ascended Masters, the Great White Brotherhood, The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse, Church Universal and Triumphant, and Kryon. Every year, members of these religious groups make pilgrimage to Mount Shasta, a journey that is marked by various yearly festivals and events. The Saint Germain Foundation hosts the annual &quot;I AM COME!&quot; Pageant, on the Life of Jesus the Christ in Mt. Shasta. The Rainbow Family hosts a &quot;Rainbow Gathering&quot; every August to commemorate the pilgrimage. These religions are often a mix of spiritual practices, based largely on native, Christian, Buddhist and Taoist traditions, synthesizing their beliefs, and excluding &quot;negative&quot; aspects of such religions. For example, the Saint Germain Foundation. does not include Jesus&#x27; crucifixion in their teachings.

<text>Benjamin Aaron Boretz (born October 3, 1934) is an American composer and music theorist.

==Life and work==
Benjamin Boretz was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Abraham Jacob Boretz and Leah (Yullis) Boretz. He graduated with a degree in music from Brooklyn College in 1954, studied composition with Tadeusz Kassern, and later studied composition at Brandeis University with Arthur Berger and Irving Fine, with Darius Milhaud at the Aspen Music Festival and School, with Lukas Foss at UCLA, and with Milton Babbitt and Roger Sessions at Princeton University. Boretz was one of the first composers to work with computer-synthesized sound (Group Variations II, 1970–72). In the late 1970s and 1980s he converged his compositional and pedagogical practices in a project of real-time improvisational music-making, culminating in the formation at Bard College of the music-learning program called Music Program Zero, which flourished until 1995. He has written extensively on musical issues, as critic, theorist, and musical philosopher, from the perspective of a practicing composer. His earliest (1970) large-scale music-intellectual essay was the book-length &quot;Meta-Variations, Studies in the Foundations of Musical Thought,&quot; which addresses the epistemological questions involved in the cognition and composition of music, and propounds a radically relativistic/individualistic/ontological reconstruction of the musical creative process. Later, in 1978, his text composition &quot;Language, as a Music, Six marginal Pretexts for Composition&quot; engaged questions of the origin and nature of language and meaning as they might be conceived from the perspective of music.

Boretz has taught in the music departments of a number of American universities, including Brandeis, UCLA, UC Berkeley, Princeton University, University of Chicago, NYU, Columbia University, University of Michigan, Bard College, UC Santa Barbara, Evergreen College, and University of Southampton (UK, as a visiting Fulbright Professor). 

Boretz is a co-founder, with Arthur Berger, of the composers&#x27; music journal &quot;Perspectives of New Music&quot; and in 1988 founded (with Elaine Barkin and J. K. Randall) Open Space (publications, recordings, scores) and, in 1999, &quot;The Open Space&quot; magazine (with Mary Lee A. Roberts), which he edits with Dorota Czerner, Tildy Bayar, Jon Forshee, Dean Rosenthal, and Arthur Margolin. He was principal music critic for The Nation from 1962 to 1970.

He has two children, Avron and Nina.

==Recordings==
Boretz&#x27;s work as composer and writer is available on CDs, DVDs, and print books issued by Open Space Publications, a cooperative formed by Boretz with Elaine Barkin and J. K. Randall.

<text>A shower is a place in which a person bathes under a spray of typically warm or hot water. Indoors, there is a drain in the floor. Most showers are set up to have adjustable temperature, spray pressure and showerhead nozzle angle. The simplest showers have a swivelling nozzle aimed downward, while more complex showers have a showerhead connected to a hose that has a mounting bracket; this allows the showerer to hold the showerhead by hand to spray the water onto different parts of their body. A showerhead can be installed in a small shower stall, or bathtub, with a plastic shower curtain or door.

Showering is common due to the efficiency of using it compared with using a bathtub. Its use in hygiene is, therefore, common practice.

==History==
Waterfalls have historically been used as primitive forms of showers. The falling water rinsed the bathers completely clean and was more efficient than bathing in a traditional basin, which required manual transport of both fresh and waste water. Ancient people began to reproduce these natural phenomena by pouring jugs of water, often very cold, over themselves after washing. There has been evidence of early upper class Egyptian and Mesopotamians having indoor shower rooms where servants would bathe them in the privacy of their own homes. However, these were primitive by modern standards, having rudimentary drainage systems and water was carried, not pumped, into the room.

The ancient Greeks were the first people to have showers. Their aqueducts and sewage systems made of lead pipes allowed water to be pumped both into and out of large communal shower rooms used by elites and common citizens alike. These rooms have been discovered at the site of the city Pergamum and can also be found represented in pottery of the era. The depictions are very similar to modern locker room showers, and even included bars to hang up clothing.

The ancient Romans also followed this convention; their famous bathhouses (Thermae) can be found all around the Mediterranean and as far out as modern-day England. The Romans not only had these showers but also believed in bathing several times a week, if not every day. The water and sewage systems developed by the Greeks and Romans broke down and fell out of use after the fall of the Roman Empire.

===Modern showers===

The first known mechanical shower, operated by a hand pump, was patented in England in 1767 by William Feetham, a stove maker from Ludgate Hill in London. His shower contraption used a pump to force the water into a vessel above the user&#x27;s head and a chain would then be pulled to release the water from the vessel. Although the system dispensed with the servant labour of filling up and pouring out buckets of water, the showers failed to catch on with the rich as a method for piping hot water through the system was not available. The system would also recycle the same dirty water through every cycle.

This early start was greatly improved in the anonymously invented English Regency shower design of (there is some ambiguity among the sources). The original design was over tall, and was made of several metal pipes painted to look like bamboo. A basin suspended above the pipes fed water into a nozzle that distributed the water over the user&#x27;s shoulders. The water on the ground was drained and pumped back through the pipes into the basin, where the cycle would repeat itself. The prototype was steadily improved upon in the following decades until it began to approximate the shower of today in its mode of operation. Hand-pumped models became fashionable at one point as well as the use of adjustable sprayers for different water flow. The reinvention of reliable indoor plumbing around 1850 allowed free-standing showers to be connected to a running water source, supplying a renewable flow of water. The shower cabin was invented in 1839 by Polish-Canadian politician and engineer Aleksander Edward Kierzkowski.

Modern showers were installed in the barracks of the French army in the 1870s as an economic hygiene measure, under the guidance of François Merry Delabost, a French doctor and inventor. As surgeon-general at Bonne Nouvelle prison in Rouen, Delabost had previously replaced individual baths with mandatory communal showers for use by prisoners, arguing that they were more economical and hygienic. First six, then eight shower stalls were installed. The water was heated by a steam engine and in less than five minutes, up to eight prisoners could wash simultaneously with only twenty litres of water. The French system of communal showers was adopted by other armies, the first being that of Prussia in 1879, and by prisons in other jurisdictions. They were also adopted by boarding schools, before being installed in public bathhouses. The first shower in a public bathhouse was in 1887 in Vienna. In France, public bathhouses and showers were established by Charles Cazalet, firstly in Bordeaux in 1893 and then in Paris in 1899.

==Types==

===Domestic===
Domestic showers are most commonly stall showers or showers combined with a bathtub. A stall shower is a dedicated shower area which uses a door or curtain to contain water spray. The shower/tub format saves bathroom space and enables the area to be used for either a bath or a shower and commonly uses a sliding shower curtain or door to contain the water spray. Showers may also be in a wet room, in which there is no contained shower area, or in a dedicated shower room, which does not require containment of water spray. Domestic showers can have a single shower head, multiple shower heads, handheld shower head(s) or other variations, all which may be adjustable as needed to varying degrees.

===Public===

Many modern athletic and aquatic facilities provide showers for use by patrons, commonly in gender segregated changing rooms. These can be in the form of individual stalls shielded by curtains or a door or communal shower rooms. The latter are generally large open rooms with any number of shower heads installed either directly into the walls or on posts throughout the shower area. Open showers are often provided at public swimming pools and at popular beaches. Military forces around the world set up field showers to enable the washing away of dangerous residue from modern weapons such as caustic chemicals, deadly biological agents, and radioactive materials, which can harm forces on both sides of a conflict.

===Wet room===
A wet room often refers to a bathroom without internal dedicated or raised areas which has an open shower. Structurally, a wet room requires the bathroom to have a gradient or slope towards a drain hole, and a foul air trap connecting the floor to the waste pipes. Depending on region, the term wet room can also encompass other rooms such as laundry rooms. In Norway, for example, any room with tap water and a drain in the floor is considered a wet room. Different jurisdictions often have special regulations concerning the design and construction of wet rooms to prevent damage from damp air or water leakage, e.g. mold.

There are also often special regulations concerning electrical installations in wet rooms. For example, since water supplies often have their own electrical grounding, there can be an added risk of injury associated with ground faults, and some jurisdictions therefore require the installation of residual-current devices in wet rooms.

==Other==
* Air shower, a type of bathing where high pressure air is used to blow off excess dust particles from cleanroom personnel.
* Digital shower, a shower system that works in a similar way to mixer or power showers, but provides more control over the temperature of the water with the use of a digital control panel.
* Eco shower, a shower system that comes in mixer or electric variations, but also features a regulator to regulate the flow of water with a view to saving water.
* Electric shower, a shower stall device to locally heat shower water with electrical power.
* Emergency showers, installed in laboratories and other facilities that use hazardous chemicals, are required by law in the United States; designed to deluge continuously at around per minute for at least 15 minutes and should be located at most 10 seconds away from potential users.
* Mixer shower, a shower system that takes water from existing hot and cold water supplies and combines them within the unit.
* Navy shower, a method of showering that allows for significant conservation of water and energy.
* Power shower, a shower stall device that works similarly to a mixer shower by mixing existing hot and cold water feeds, but locally increases the water pressure available to the shower head by means of an electric booster pump.
* Roman shower, a shower that does not use a door or curtain.
* Steam shower, a type of bathing where a humidifying steam generator produces steam that is dispersed around a person&#x27;s body.
* Vichy shower, a shower where large quantities of warm water are poured over a spa patron while the user lies within a shallow (wet) bed, similar to a massage table, but with drainage for the water.

==Types of shower heads==
* Fixed shower heads: Traditional fixed shower-heads are mostly common shower-faucets because they can easily connect to the plumbing fixtures without any additional hardware.
* Shower handsets/bidet shower: Hand-set shower-faucets are connected by a flexible hose, and can also be mounted and used like a fixed shower-head. 
* Ceiling-mounted faucets: Ceiling-mounted shower-faucets are typically rain-drop shower-heads mounted in the ceiling of the shower. Water rains down, at low or medium pressure, using gravity to shower on one from directly above.
* Adjustable shower heads: Adjustable shower faucets often have numerous settings, including pulsating massage and low/medium/high-pressure flow settings. 
* Shower panels: Unlike a single showerhead, these are wall-mounted with sprayers aimed horizontally at various parts of the body.

==Use and ecology==

Shower usage in the latter half of the 20th century skyrocketed. Personal hygiene became a primary concern, and bathing every day or multiple times a day is common among Western cultures. Showering is generally faster than bathing and can use less water. In an average home, showers are typically the third largest water use after toilets and clothes washers. The average American shower uses and lasts for 8.2 minutes at an average flow rate of per minute.

Showering is one of the leading ways people use water in the home, accounting for nearly 17 percent of residential indoor water use, which roughly equals to of water annually just for showering. The US Environmental Protection Agency recommends to retrofit home showers with a shower head that uses less than to conserve water. However, many have hypothesized reducing flow rates of showerheads might cause users to take much longer showers. Other options to save water include using extra high pressure mist flow or design in sensors and valves to shut off or reduce water flow while people are not actively using the shower water. 
Various measures can be taken to increase safety for those, especially elderly people, taking showers or baths. Some people take more than one shower each day, normally at their normal shower time, and after exercising. People also shower to cool off in hot weather, especially those unaccustomed to the climate. Used shower water can be employed as greywater.

==Cultural significance==
Showering is mostly part of a daily routine primarily to promote cleanliness and prevent odor, disease and infection. Advances in science and medicine in the 19th century began to realize the benefit of regular bathing to an individual&#x27;s health. As a result, most modern cultures encourage a daily personal hygiene regimen. Showering has also developed the reputation as a relaxing and generally therapeutic activity.

==Structure and design==
Designs for shower facilities vary by location and purpose. There are free-standing showers, but also showers which are integrated into a bathtub. Showers are separated from the surrounding area through watertight curtains (shower curtain), sliding doors, or folding doors, or shower blinds, in order to protect the space from spraying water. Showers with a level entry wet room are becoming very popular, especially due to improvements in waterproofing systems and prefabricated components.

Places such as a swimming pool, a locker room, or a military facility have multiple showers. There may be communal shower rooms without divisions, or shower stalls (typically open at the top). Many types of showers are available, including complete shower units which are all encompassing showers that include the pan, walls, and often the shower head, as well as pieced together units in which the pan, shower head, and doors are purchased separately. Each type of shower poses different installation issues.

===Installation===
Though the installation requirements of each of shower will differ, the installation of a shower in general requires the laying of several water transportation pipes, including a pipe for hot water and for cold water, and a drainage pipe. It is important that the wet areas of a bathroom be waterproof, and multiple layers of waterproofing can be employed. Grout is used to fill gaps between tiles, but grout and tile setting materials are generally porous. Tiles are generally waterproof, though a shower pan must be installed beneath them as a safety to prevent water leakage. Thus small mosaic tiles offer less of a defense than large format tiles. Sub-tile waterproofing is important when tiles are being used. Best practice requires a waterproofing material to cover the walls and floor of the shower area that are then covered with tile, or in some countries with a sheet material like vinyl.

===Drainage===
A shower may be equipped with a second emergency drain outside of the shower in case of overflow. An emergency overflow drain is required in Australia and some European countries.

===Shower head===

A shower head is a perforated nozzle that distributes water over solid angle a focal point of use, generally overhead the bather. A shower uses less water than a full immersion in a bath. Some shower heads can be adjusted to spray different patterns of water, such as massage, gentle spray, strong spray, and intermittent pulse or combination modes.

Hard water may result in calcium and magnesium deposits clogging the head, reducing the flow and changing the spray pattern. For descaling, various acidic chemicals or brushes can be used or some heads have rubber-like jets that can be manually descaled. A homemade remedy is to immerse it in a solution of water and vinegar for a while, since the vinegar is able to dissolve limescale.

Some governments around the world set standards for water usage and regulate shower heads. For example, in the United States, residential and most commercial shower heads must flow no more than per minute per the Department of Energy ruling 10 CFR 430. Low-flow shower heads that have a water flow of equal or less than per minute (2.0 gallons per minute), can use water more efficiently by aerating the water stream, altering nozzles through advanced flow principles or by high-speed oscillation of the spray stream. The US EPA administers a voluntary water saving program, WaterSense, which can certify low-flow shower heads.

===Shower and bathtub curtains===

Curtains can be used in shower or bathtub enclosures with two main purposes: to provide privacy and to prevent water from flooding or spraying outside the shower or bathtub area. Shower and bathtub curtains usually surround the bath inside the tub or shower area and are held up with s or curtain rods high on the wall or ceiling. To accommodate the different types of bathtub shapes, railings can come in different sizes and are flexible in their design. The curtains are usually made from , cloth, or plastic.

Some people use two shower curtains: one that is inside the tub, which is mainly functional or decorative as well, and an outer shower curtain, which is purely decorative. The bottom portion of the inner curtain often comes with magnetic discs or suction cups which adhere to the bathtub itself.

===Shower and bathtub doors===
Shower or bathtub doors are doors (also called screens) used in bathrooms that help keep water inside a shower or bathtub and are alternatives to shower curtains. They are available in many different styles such as framed or frameless, sliding or swing. They are usually constructed of aluminium, clear glass, plexiglass or tempered glass. Shower doors can come in many different hardware finishes and glass patterns that can match other bathroom hardware such as faucets and shower heads. There are also shower doors that are in a neo angle design for use on shower pans that have the neo design as well. The design of the shower pan is extremely important as the shower door must be the type required for the pan in order to work. A shower door requires plastic lining along the edges of the door to protect against water leaking out.

==Equipment==
* Pressure-balanced valve, a device to provide constant shower water pressure and prevent temperature fluctuations
* Shampoo
* Shower , a storage system inside the shower, typically for shampoo, conditioner, soap and other related things
* Shower cap, a cap worn while showering or bathing, to protect hair from becoming wet
* Shower radio, a radio that is waterproofed to allow it to be used in a bathroom or other wet environment
* Shower speaker, a Bluetooth speaker designed to play music while the shower is running
* Soap
* Washing mitt, a tool for applying soap to the body
* Water heat recycling units to reclaim much of the waste water&#x27;s heat and recycle it to the shower head and minimize heat lost to the drain

<text>Gasterosteoidei is a suborder of ray-finned fishes that includes the sticklebacks and relatives, the 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; classifies this suborder within the order Scorpaeniformes.

== Systematics ==
Gasterosteoidei is treated as a suborder within the order Scorpaeniformes in the 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot;, but in other phylogenetic classifications it is treated as the infraorder Gasterosteales within the suborder Cottoidei or as a sister clade to the Zoarcales in the order Zoarciformes. Indostomidae is included within Gasterosteoidei in &quot;Fishes of the World&quot;&#x27; but according to Betancur &quot;et al&quot; its inclusion in the clade renders it paraphyletic and they classify that family within the monotypic suborder Indostomoidei within the Synbranchiformes.

Historically, Gasterosteoidei was treated as a suborder within the order Gasterostiformes and often included the sea horses, pipefishes and their relatives as suborder Syngnathoidei, with the sticklebacks and relatives in the suborder Gasterosteoidei. The Gasterosteiformes &quot;sensu lato&quot; were regarded as paraphyletic with the Scorpaeniformes. The more typical members of that group (e.g. scorpionfishes) are apparently closer to the &quot;true&quot; Gasterosteiformes, whereas the keel-bodied flying gurnards (Dactylopteridae) seem actually to belong to the Syngnathiformes clade. It seems that the closest living relatives of the narrowly delimited Gasterosteoidei are the Zoarcoidei, which have been placed in the massively paraphyletic &quot;Perciformes&quot;. The Zoarcoidei, as well as the related Trichodontidae, would then appear to be derived offshoots of the scorpaeniform-gasterosteiform radiation which have apomorphically lost the bone &quot;armour&quot; found in their relatives.

==Families and genera==
Gasterosteoidei contains the following families and genera:

* Family Hypoptychidae (Sand eel)
** &quot;Hypoptychus&quot; 
* Family Aulorhynchidae (Tubesnouts)
** &quot;Aulichthys&quot; 
** &quot;Aulorhynchus&quot; 
* Family Gasterosteidae (Sticklebacks)
** &quot;Apeltes&quot; 
** &quot;Culaea&quot; 
** &quot;Gasterosteus&quot; 
** &quot;Pungitius&quot; 
** &quot;Spinachia&quot; 

==Characteristics==
Gasterosteoidei is characterised by the possession of a protractile upper jaw and a well developed upward pointing process on the premaxilla. The body is often armoured with dermal plates and paired dermal plates grow from membranes growing out from the pelvic girdle. If there are plates on the flanks these are often a single row of ossified lateral and dermal plates. Unpaired plates
paired pelvic plates arising from a membranous outgrowth of the pelvic girdle; lateral body plates, when present, are represented by a single series of lateral and dermal ossifications. The unpaired plates on the body which create the dorsal and ventral series grow from the expanded proximal middle radials of the pterygiphores of the dorsal and anal fins. Separate pectoral radials do not develop during the fish&#x27;s development and the pectoral radial plate is fused into a single unit on the scapulo-coracoid. They have very small mouths. There are between 1 and 6 branchiostegal rays and there is no postcleithrum in the pelvic girdle which is never joined directly to the cleithra. There are other skeletal features that these fishes share too. The kidneys of gasterosteoids synthesis an adhesive chemical which is used by males to create nests of plant material, it is not known if this is true of all the taxa within the group. These are all rather small fishes with the largest species being the sea stickleback (&quot;Spinachia spinachia&quot;) which has a maximum published standard length of .

==Distribution and habitat==
Gasterodteoidei are found in the northern hemisphere, mostly within the temperate and Arctic regions, the exception is the Indostomidae which are found in freshwater habitats in mainland Southeast Asia. The other groups can be found in fresh, brackish and salt water.

<doc id="477835" wikidata="Q2395908" url="?curid=477835" title="Marlene Jennings">
<text>Marlene Jennings (born November 10, 1951) is a former Canadian politician. She was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada in the House of Commons of Canada, and represented the riding of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine from 1997 to 2011.

Jennings was born in Longueuil, Quebec and graduated from Longueuil&#x27;s Lemoyne d&#x27;Iberville High School. Her father, Preston Jennings, was an African American from Alabama and immigrated to Canada as a CPR Sleeping Car Porter. Her mother, Gilberte Garand, was a Franco-Manitoban of Belgian &amp; French-Canadian ancestry. Jennings is a former lawyer and senior public servant. She is the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Cooperation and the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General of Canada. From 2004 to October 2005, she was Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister with special emphasis on Canada-U.S. relations.

Jennings was the first Black woman from Quebec to be elected to Parliament. She was also one of the few parliamentarians with a physical disability, having become partially blind due to an illness in early 2010; she used visual aids and a white cane until late 2011. Over seven surgical procedures successfully restored her vision.

She is also a past member of the Girl Guides of Canada.

==Electoral history==

Jennings succeeded Warren Allmand, the MP for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, in the reorganized riding of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine upon its creation in 1997. She was elected five times in the riding with consistent margins of between 10,000 and 20,000 votes, and her riding was considered one of the safest Liberal seats in the country. However, she fell to Quebec&#x27;s &quot;orange wave&quot; in the 2011 Canadian federal election, losing her seat to Isabelle Morin of the NDP.

==Later life and career==

In January 2012, it was reported that Jennings was considering an offer to run for the Coalition Avenir Québec in the 2012 Quebec general election. She ultimately declined. In a February 2012 Facebook post, Jennings explained that she had declined because she had never had a &quot;passion&quot; for provincial politics. For close to two years (2012 and 2013) she was the executive director of the Montreal YMHA. She had let her Liberal Party of Canada party membership lapse but re-joined in 2014.

<text>Laura Guadalupe Zapata Miranda ( born July 31, 1955) is a Mexican telenovela actress, singer, and dancer. She has acted in Televisa productions.

== Life and career ==
Born in Mexico City, Zapata is the daughter of Guillermo Zapata Pérez de Utrera (a Mexican boxer, model, and businessman) and Yolanda Miranda Mange. She is the maternal sister of Thalía (also a singer and actress), Federica, Gabriela, and Ernestina Sodi. 

Zapata is a singer and dancer. In &quot;Maria Mercedes&quot;, one of Thalía&#x27;s first soap operas, Zapata played a villain opposite her sister. She is well known for her antagonist roles in telenovelas.

Zapata was married to Juan Eduardo Sodi de la Tijera. She has two sons, Claudio Sodi and Patricio Sodi.

==Kidnapping==
In September 2002, Zapata and her sister Ernestina Sodi were kidnapped and taken to an unspecified location. The news of their kidnapping made headlines across Latin America and among the Spanish-speaking television channels of the United States.

Their sister Thalía is married to multi-millionaire Tommy Mottola, so it was speculated that their captors would ask for a large sum of money. Instead, Zapata was released 18 days after her kidnapping, and Ernestina was released on the 34th day.

He was Paul Martin&#x27;s Quebec lieutenant during the period of the Martin government. He was first elected to the House of Commons in 1978, serving from 1979 to 1993, and representing the riding of Shefford. He sat as a Liberal from 1979 to 1990, and later as an independent. He returned after an eleven-year absence when he won a seat in the 2004 federal election for the Montreal riding of Outremont. On July 20, 2004, he was appointed to the Canadian Cabinet as Minister of Transport, serving until the 2006 election. Lapierre resigned as the MP for Outremont on January 28, 2007.

In 2016, Lapierre died on a private plane that crashed on approach to Îles-de-la-Madeleine Airport. Seven people died in the crash, including four of his family members; they were travelling to his father Raymond&#x27;s funeral. Both pilots died.

== Early life, education and marriage ==
Born May 7, 1956, Jean Lapierre was the oldest son of Raymond and Lucie Lapierre. He had younger siblings: a sister Martine and brothers Marc and Louis Lapierre.

He married and had two children: Marie-Anne and Jean-Michel Lapierre. Later, the couple divorced. Lapierre married Nicole Beaulieu in 1989.

== Early political career ==

=== Liberal ===
Lapierre was elected to the House of Commons in 1978, serving from 1979 to 1993, representing the riding of Shefford, Quebec. He sat as a Liberal from 1979 to 1990. Lapierre was a Quebec federalist; together with Pierre Trudeau, he opposed the 1980 Quebec referendum alternative to establish sovereignty for the province. In the first referendum on the place of Quebec in Canada, continued federal status won with nearly 60 per cent of the vote.

After Trudeau retired from politics in 1984, he was succeeded as Prime Minister and party leader by John Turner. Turner appointed Lapierre at age 28 to cabinet (at the time, the youngest minister to serve in a federal cabinet) as minister of state for youth and amateur sport. Lapierre&#x27;s tenure was brief as Turner called an election nine days after being sworn in, and the Liberals lost.

Lapierre was a strong proponent of the Meech Lake Accord, and Turner and Martin also expressed support for it. Trudeau publicly campaigned against it, and Jean Chrétien opposed it as well.

=== Bloc Québécois ===
Upon leaving the Liberals, Lapierre sat as an independent, helping to found the Bloc Québécois and serving in their first caucus. In 1992, he retired from politics for a time and abandoned his affiliation with the Bloc. Lapierre has said that he never fully identified as a separatist and was the &quot;red of the rainbow&quot; in a temporary ad hoc rainbow coalition. He wanted to gain a level playing field for Quebec.

== Broadcaster ==
In private life, Lapierre was well known in Quebec as a broadcaster and talk show host for Montreal radio station CKAC. He also worked simultaneously as a TV news presenter for a time.

== Return to Liberals ==
Lapierre never fully gave up his political ambitions or his personal loyalty to Paul Martin. When the latter became liberal leader in December 2003, Lapierre returned to party politics after a decade away.

Martin appointed Lapierre as his Quebec lieutenant. He had a different style from his predecessors, most of whom were cautious, soft-spoken, and mindful of the effects of their Quebec actions on the rest of Canada. By contrast, Lapierre had what a CBC commentator described as a &quot;rough and tumble, shoot from the hip style of politics&quot;, being known for his flamboyance, aggressiveness, toughness, rudeness and arrogance.

News analysts questioned the need for a Quebec lieutenant, as Martin was bilingual. In addition, polls showed fading support for the Bloc Québécois and Parti Québécois (who lost the 2003 provincial election), suggesting less need for a lieutenant. Others believed that Martin placed high importance on Quebec, hoping to fare significantly better than Chrétien had. He considered Lapierre to be crucial to winning over part of the nationalist vote.

=== 2004 federal election ===
In the 2004 federal election, Lapierre was expected to deliver the vote in Quebec, but this was difficult following the sponsorship scandal of the Liberal Party. The scandal severely hurt the party&#x27;s support, especially in that province, while the rival Bloc Québécois gained support. Lapierre said that it would help the Liberals if the Royal Canadian Mounted Police could &quot;lay some charges already&quot; in the sponsorship probe.

Years later, Lapierre said the sponsorship scandal had damaged the party like getting hit by a Mack truck. When Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe tried to link Liza Frulla to the Sponsorship Scandal, saying that her 2002 by-election campaign was funded by members implicated in the scandal, Lapierre described it as &quot;the cheapest thing you can do—try to start gossip that has no foundation&quot;.

The Liberals were able to retain a plurality of seats to continue governing, but they were reduced to a minority. In Quebec, they lost 15 of the 36 seats won in 2000, and their popular vote fell from 44 to 34 per cent, while the Bloc Québécois captured 54 of the 75 seats.

=== Minister of Transport ===
As Minister of Transport, Lapierre initiated the Pacific Gateway Strategy, signing air transport agreements with China and India and completed a formal Canada-US Open Skies Agreement. He also spearheaded a large federal investment in the Prince Rupert container terminal, saying that it improved ties to Asian markets while enhancing economic development in northern British Columbia and Alberta. Lapierre reduced the amount paid by airports to the federal government by some $5 billion over the remaining life of the leases. He announced the implementation of a No Fly List to increase security for airline passengers.

As Transport Minister, his predecessor Tony Valeri had dismissed VIA Rail chairman Jean Pelletier, who filed a lawsuit against the government charging it had failed to use due process. A federal court ruled in his favour in November 2005 after the change in administrations, ordering Pelletier to be reinstated. The government appealed the court ruling and kept the former chair off the payroll. Lapierre ensured that due process was followed in dismissing Pelletier a second time. But in March 2007, Justice Francois Lemieux ruled that the Martin government acted improperly in 2005 when it fired Pelletier a second time, immediately after a court had overturned his first dismissal, stating that Lapierre was biased and failed to follow proper procedures. On November 22, 2007, Judge Hélène Langlois of the Quebec Superior Court ruled that the government of then-Prime Minister Paul Martin had acted in a &quot;cavalier and precipitous&quot; fashion when it fired Pelletier. The court awarded Pelletier $235,000 in lost income and a further $100,000 in damages.

Lapierre and his department were criticized for their handling of the collapse of the carrier Jetsgo. Critics said that he should have seen warning signs after unsuccessful attempts to lower the carrier&#x27;s costs. They also said he had failed to warn the public or intervene, making him indirectly responsible when thousands of travellers were stranded when the carrier stopped operations. Lapierre rejected calls to resign and denied that he had any knowledge of the collapse. He pointed out that most of the passengers had booked flights with credit cards and would be eligible for refunds.

=== Opposition ===
Lapierre retained his position as Quebec lieutenant for the 2006 election. He was personally re-elected without much difficulty, though with a reduced margin. But, the Liberals lost power in the campaign, falling from 21 to 13 seats in Quebec. They were surpassed by the Conservatives in the popular vote.

Paul Martin resigned as parliamentary leader on election night and as party leader a month later. Interim successor Bill Graham appointed Lapierre to his shadow cabinet as Industry critic.

Lapierre was neutral at the 2006 Liberal leadership election, where Stéphane Dion was elected Liberal leader. Lapierre afterwards planned to announce that he would not run for re-election in Outremont, saying that his &quot;commitment was to Mr. Martin for one mandate.&quot; Lapierre commented that Dion was the first leader not to have to cope with a divided party, after decades of infighting between Trudeau/Turner and Chrétien/Martin.

== Return to broadcasting ==
On January 11, 2007, Lapierre announced that he would retire from political office at the end of the month. He did so on January 28, 2007.

He started work as a political analyst with Quebec television network TVA and Montreal radio station 98.5 FM. He co-hosted a political show with reporter Paul Larocque: &quot;Larocque-Lapierre.&quot; He was also political commentator for CJAD and FM 98.5 radio in Montreal, and FM 93 in Quebec city. He contributed regularly to &quot;Power Play&quot; and &quot;Question Period&quot; on the CTV network.

In 2014, Lapierre was coauthor with Chantal Hébert of the non-fiction book &quot;The Morning After: The 1995 Quebec Referendum and the Day that Almost Was.&quot; It was a shortlisted nominee for the 2015 Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing.

== Death ==

On March 29, 2016, Jean Lapierre died in a plane crash short of the airport in the Magdalen Islands. All seven travellers on board died, including his wife Nicole Beaulieu, sister Martine Lapierre, and brothers Marc and Louis Lapierre. The family was en route to the funeral of Lapierre&#x27;s father, Raymond C. Lapierre, who had died a few days earlier. All of the Lapierre family members were honoured in a service at Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine in early April. They are survived by Marie-Anne and Jean-Michel Lapierre, children of Jean and his first wife, Gabrielle Choinière; and Lucie Lapierre, Raymond&#x27;s widow.

Lapierre and Beaulieu were given a funeral at Saint-Viateur d&#x27;Outremont church in Montreal on April 16, 2016, attended by extended family, friends, political and broadcasting colleagues, and dignitaries including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau. His daughter Marie-Anne Lapierre gave the eulogy.

The plane was travelling faster and at a higher altitude than recommended, the federal Transportation Safety Board stated. The agency said that the plane crashed short of the airport soon after the pilot turned off the autopilot and lowered the landing gear. Almost immediately afterwards, the Mitsubishi MU-2B-60 aircraft &quot;rolled quickly into a steep right bank and descended rapidly&quot; before smashing to the ground.

<doc id="477849" wikidata="Q568188" url="?curid=477849" title="Ethical subjectivism">
<text>Ethical subjectivism (also known as moral subjectivism and moral non-objectivism) is the meta-ethical view which claims that:
#Ethical sentences express propositions.
#Some such propositions are true.
#The truth or falsity of such propositions is ineliminably dependent on the (actual or hypothetical) attitudes of people.

This makes ethical subjectivism a form of cognitivism (because ethical statements are the types of things that can be true or false). Ethical subjectivism stands in opposition to moral realism, which claims that moral propositions refer to objective facts, independent of human opinion; to error theory, which denies that any moral propositions are true in any sense; and to non-cognitivism, which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all.

== Relationship to moral anti-realism ==
Ethical subjectivism is a form of moral anti-realism that denies the &quot;metaphysical thesis&quot; of moral realism, (the claim that moral truths are ordinary facts about the world). Instead ethical subjectivism claims that moral truths are based on the mental states of individuals or groups of people. The moral realist is committed to some version of the following three statements:

# The semantic thesis: Moral statements have meaning, they express propositions, or are the kind of things that can be true or false.
# The alethic thesis: Some moral propositions are true.
# The metaphysical thesis: The metaphysical status of moral facts is robust and ordinary, not importantly different from other facts about the world.

Moral anti-realism is the denial of at least one of these claims. Ethical subjectivists deny the third claim, instead arguing that moral facts are not metaphysically ordinary, but rather dependent on mental states, (individual&#x27;s beliefs about what is right and wrong). Moral non-cognitivists deny the first claim, while error theorists deny the second claim.

There is some debate as to whether moral realism should continue to require the metaphysical thesis, and therefore if ethical subjectivists should be considered moral realists. Geoffrey Sayre-McCord argues that moral realism should not require mind-independence since there are morally relevant psychological facts which are necessarily mind-dependent, which would make ethical subjectivism a version of moral realism. This has led to a distinction being made between robust moral realism (which requires all three of the theses) and minimal moral realism (which requires only the first two, and is therefore compatible with ethical subjectivism).

== Moral relativism and ethical subjectivism ==
Moral relativism claims that statements are true or false based on who is saying them: they include indexicals in the same way that the truth of the statement &quot;I am in Senegal&quot; is dependent on who is making that statement. Depending on the variety of moral relativism, these statements may be indexed to a particular society (i.e., cultural relativism, when I say stealing is wrong, it is only true if stealing is not acceptable in my culture), or indexed to an individual (individualistic relativism). Furthermore, moral relativism is the view where an actor&#x27;s moral codes are locally derived from their culture. The rules within moral codes are equal to each other and are only deemed &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; within their specific moral codes. Relativism is opposite to Universalism because there is not a single moral code for every agent to follow. Relativism differs from Nihilism because it validates every moral code that exists whereas nihilism does not. When it comes to relativism, Russian philosopher and writer, Fyodor Dostoevsky, coined the phrase &quot;If God doesn&#x27;t exist, everything is permissible&quot;. That phrase was his view of the consequences for rejecting theism as a basis of ethics. American anthropologist Ruth Benedict argued that there is no single objective morality and that moral codes necessarily vary by culture.

Ethical subjectivism is a completely distinct concept from moral relativism. Ethical subjectivism claims that the truth or falsehood of ethical claims is dependent on the mental states and attitudes of people, but these ethical truths may be universal (i.e. one person or group&#x27;s mental states may determine what is right or wrong for everyone). The term &quot;ethical subjectivism&quot; covers two distinct theories in ethics. According to cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, the truth of moral statements depends upon people&#x27;s values, attitudes, feelings, or beliefs. Some forms of cognitivist ethical subjectivism can be counted as forms of realism, others are forms of anti-realism. David Hume is a foundational figure for cognitive ethical subjectivism. On a standard interpretation of his theory, a trait of character counts as a moral virtue when it evokes a sentiment of approbation in a sympathetic, informed, and rational human observer. Similarly, Roderick Firth&#x27;s ideal observer theory held that right acts are those that an impartial, rational observer would approve of. William James, another ethical subjectivist, held that an end is good (to or for a person) just in the case it is desired by that person (see also ethical egoism). According to non-cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, such as emotivism, prescriptivism, and expressivism, ethical statements cannot be true or false, at all: rather, they are expressions of personal feelings or commands. For example, on A. J. Ayer&#x27;s emotivism, the statement, &quot;Murder is wrong&quot; is equivalent in meaning to the emotive, &quot;Murder, Boo!&quot; 

While moral relativism and ethical subjectivism positions are often held together, they do not entail each other. For example, someone that claims that whatever their king wants to happen is the morally right thing for everyone to do would be an ethical subjectivist (right and wrong are based on mental states), but they would not be a moral relativist (right and wrong are the same for everyone). Conversely, a moral relativist could deny moral subjectivism if they thought that the morally right thing to do was to follow the written laws of your country (this morality is relativist since &quot;the laws of your country&quot; picks out different laws for different individuals, but not subjectivist since it is dependent on the written laws, which are not in anyone&#x27;s head).

Some universalist forms of subjectivism include ideal observer theory (which claims that moral propositions are about what attitudes a hypothetical ideal observer would hold). Although divine command theory is considered by some to be a form of ethical subjectivism, defenders of the perspective that divine command theory is not a form of ethical subjectivism say this is based on a misunderstanding: that divine command proponents claim that moral propositions are about what attitudes God holds, but this understanding is deemed incorrect by some, such as Robert Adams who claims that divine command theory is concerned with whether a moral command is or isn&#x27;t &quot;contrary to the commands of (a loving) God&quot;.

== Terminology ==
There is some debate among philosophers around the use of the term &quot;ethical subjectivism&quot; as this term has historically referred to the more specific position that ethical statements are merely reports of one&#x27;s own mental states (saying that killing is wrong just means you disapprove of killing). While this is an ethically subjective position (the truth of your statement does depend on your mental states), it is not the only one. Due to this ambiguity, some philosophers have advocated that the general position discussed here be referred to as non-objectivism.

<text>The Little Bighorn River is a tributary of the Bighorn River in the United States in the states of Montana and Wyoming. The Battle of the Little Bighorn, also known as the Battle of the Greasy Grass, was fought on its banks on June 25–26, 1876, as well as the Battle of Crow Agency in 1887.

==Geography==

The Little Bighorn rises in northern Wyoming, deep in the Bighorn Mountains, under Duncum Mountain and Burnt Mountain. The main stream flows through a deep canyon until it issues onto the plains, just at the Montana-Wyoming border. In Little Bighorn Canyon in Wyoming, the Little Bighorn receives other mountain streams as tributaries including the Dry Fork (which despite its name maintains a permanent, year-round significant flow of water into the Little Bighorn), and the West Fork of the Little Bighorn.

After issuing from its canyon at the Montana-Wyoming line the Little Bighorn flows northward across the Crow Indian Reservation. The river flows past the towns of Wyola, Lodge Grass and Crow Agency, and joins the Bighorn River near the town of Hardin.

At Wyola, Montana, the Little Bighorn receives the flow of Pass Creek flowing north from the Bighorn Mountains. At Lodge Grass the Little Bighorn receives the waters of two tributaries, the largest being Lodge Grass Creek which flows west out of its own canyon system in the Bighorn Mountains, and Owl Creek flowing east and north from the Wolf Mountains. A few miles before reaching Crow Agency, the Little Horn receives the flow of Reno Creek from the Wolf Mountains to the east.

The famous Little Bighorn battle site is approximately south of Crow Agency, on the eastern side of the river and is now the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument.

==Source of name ==

In 1859, William F. Raynolds led a government expedition up the Big Horn River to the mouth of Big Horn Canyon, and then southeast along the base of the Big Horn mountains. En route to the Big Horn Canyon, and about down the Big Horn River from the canyon, he camped just below the mouth of the Little Bighorn on September 6, 1859. He noted in his journal for that day that the Indian name of the Big Horn river, into which the Little Bighorn empties, is &quot;Ets-pot-agie&quot;, or Mountain Sheep River, and this generates the name of the Little Big Horn, &quot;Ets-pot-agie-cate&quot;, or Little Mountain Sheep river. The trappers who came to the Big Horn Mountains in the fur trapping era continued the usage of the English translation of the Indian names, and the names for both rivers have come down through history.

Captain Raynolds had Jim Bridger as a guide and interpreter, so the information about the source of the name was confirmed by Raynolds from Indian sources through Bridger.

According to the USGS, the Little Bighorn River has three other official variants of the name, including Little Horn River, Custer River and Great Horn River.

Local people who live in the valley and along the tributaries commonly use the shortened version—Little Horn—instead of the more cumbersome name, Little Bighorn.

A historical variant name for the Little Bighorn is the Greasy Grass. From the 1500s to the 1800s, the indigenous Crow people knew the river as the Greasy Grass. Crow tribal historian Joe Medicine Crow explained in a 2012 YouTube interview that this name was used by the Crows for the river system because in the river bottoms in the upper reaches of the Little Bighorn and its major tributaries, there was abundant grass that would gather heavy dew in the morning which, in turn, would wet moccasins and leggings of Indian people, and the bellies and legs of horses, and cause them to look greasy. On the mainstream, the name Greasy Grass slowly gave way to the alternative name Little Bighorn. For one major tributary of the Little Bighorn, the (presently named) Lodge Grass Creek retained the name &quot;Greasy Grass Creek&quot;, but as Joe Medicine Crow explained in the 2012 video, this name morphed from &quot;Greasy Grass&quot; to &quot;Lodge Grass&quot; due to the error of an interpreter since the Crow word for &quot;greasy&quot; is Tah-shay, and the Crow word for &quot;lodge&quot; is Ah-shay.

The Lakota Sioux, who began to contest control of this area with the Crow in the 1840s to 1860s as the Sioux pushed westward, continued to call the river the &quot;Greasy Grass&quot;. Native Americans called the river the Greasy Grass before the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876, and Lakota people still commonly refer to the Battle of the Little Bighorn as the Battle of the Greasy Grass.

In historical references in Wikipedia articles, the Battle of the Little Bighorn is also referred to as the Battle of the Greasy Grass, as it is in the discussions of the battle by the History Channel.

The alternative name used in the 1800s by the Sioux, Cheyenne, and Crow of &quot;Greasy Grass&quot; for the &quot;Little Bighorn&quot; is reflected in current-day nomenclature at the Little Bighorn battlefield. A prominent ridge on the Little Bighorn Battlefield that overlooks the eastern banks of the Little Bighorn River has retained the name of Greasy Grass Ridge and is the site of critical events of the battle.

In Lakota, the Little Bighorn River is called .

==Fishing and stream access issues==

=== River access in Wyoming===

Upstream from the point where the Little Bighorn issues from the Little Horn Canyon, the stream flow is in Wyoming. For the first two miles a very rough road goes upstream. All along this road, and all along the stream in this stretch, the land is privately owned and a sign at the entrance to the canyon provides notice of this fact. Wyoming stream access laws are &quot;not&quot; liberal and trespass laws are strictly construed. In this two mile stretch all riparian access requires trespass across private lands.

After two miles of road travel upstream, the road reaches the Bighorn National Forest Service boundary where a parking area is maintained by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department, but signage prohibits overnight camping. Upstream above this point fishing is permitted on the National Forest, but the first river mile of this stretch of fishing is unusually difficult and rugged because the stream bed is littered with very large boulders due to a massive earth slide that blocked the canyon thousands of years ago, after which the river cut down through the slide leaving huge boulders along the river banks. At two miles above the parking area, the river enters a granite-sided box canyon that extends for about a mile, where the river washes from one sheer wall to the other and is impassible to wading anglers except during times of very low water. In this area, the trail leaves the river and climbs around this gorge.

The very rough road ends and the trail up the Little Horn Canyon begins a few hundred yards after the parking area. One fork of the trail crosses the river and becomes the Dry Fork Trail. The other trail winds upstream in a westerly direction through the Little Horn Canyon. The Little Horn Canyon trail was originally established for the purposes of delivering mail to Bald Mountain City, a gold mining town, in the late 1800s. The trail is now primarily used by cattle ranchers, marathon runners, and fishermen.

===River access in Montana on the Crow Indian Reservation===
After flowing out of Wyoming and into Montana at the mouth of Little Bighorn Canyon, the entire remaining course of the Little Bighorn River and all its tributaries are within the boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation, and access to the river is subject to the unique and confusing mixture of Montana state and Crow tribal law.

Fishing within the boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation is governed by the U.S. Supreme Court case of Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544 (1981). The case addressed the Crow Nation&#x27;s ability to regulate hunting and fishing on the reservation by tribal members and by non tribal members, and the case held that the Crow Tribe may prohibit or regulate hunting or fishing by non-members on land belonging to the Tribe or held by the United States in trust for the Tribe.

On tribal lands, the Crow Tribal Code (2005) addresses fishing by non-members in Title 12. Non-members may fish on Tribal lands but only while possessing a Tribal Recreation License, with appropriate permit to fish. and only with an enrolled Crow Tribal member in attendance, who is trained and properly licensed as a fishing guide.

While the case of &quot;Montana v. United States&quot; also holds that the Tribe may not prohibit non-Indians from hunting and fishing on lands not owned by the tribe or held in trust for the tribe, such parcels of &quot;fee lands&quot; are usually not extensive and are scattered randomly among the parcels of Tribal lands, and there is no indication on the ground to indicate to the non-member fisher person when they are on fee land, where they would be trespassing, and when they are on Tribal lands in breach of the law.

The Crow Tribal Court has exclusive jurisdiction over non-Indians who commit violations on Tribal land. If a non-member is found in violation of any part of the Tribal Code, they are subject to fines (Crow Tribal Code 2005, Section 12-11-109), forfeiture of fishing gear, and payment of court costs 

This confusing and chaotic situation, in which enforcement of fishing restrictions and access to streams depends on who owns the land the fisher person is standing on, has caused fishing websites to conclude: &quot;However, the Little Bighorn runs entirely within the boundaries of the Crow Reservation and access to it is next to nil.&quot;

The prospective fisherman should not be misled by the fact that the blue ribbon trout fishery on the Big Horn River, below the Yellowtail Dam, is fished by non-Indians (provided the non-member complies with Montana fishing regulations and laws), though this stretch of the Bighorn River is within the boundaries of the Crow Reservation. In the seminal case of Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544 (1981), the court exempted the Big Horn River from their ruling, holding that the bed of the Bighorn River was not included within the grant of tribal lands to the Crow Tribe in their prior treaties, and thus upon the admission of Montana to the Union the bed of the Big Horn River (and thus the right to fish on the Big Horn River) passed from federal ownership to the state of Montana.

==Road and trail access==

In Montana, from the mouth of the river at Hardin upstream to about above Wyola, there is paved and gravel road access to the Little Bighorn Valley, and upstream from this point to the mouth of the Little Bighorn canyon there is a gravel road maintained by Bighorn County. However, from the point at which the river flows out of the canyon (at about the Wyoming-Montana state line) the road continues upstream in the canyon for only about . There are two (and sometimes three) unbridged stream fords. This portion of the road is unmaintained and is a two track road with tight turns. It is primitive, rough, ungraded, and littered with partially buried boulders. When it rains large puddles accumulate in low spots. It is impassible in the winter after snow accumulates and after the two stream fords, fed by springs, partially freeze over. When not closed by winter weather, this road still requires vehicles with high clearance, preferably with 4X4 gearing.

In Wyoming, and particularly in the Little Bighorn Canyon, all the land adjacent to the road and the stream is private, and a sign noting this is posted at the entrance to the canyon. At the furthest point of the road, two miles upstream from the canyon mouth, at the US Forest Service boundary, there is a parking area maintained by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department but signage prohibits overnight camping. Upstream, above this point the Forest Service lands a trail that crosses the river on a footbridge to the southeast side and then leaves the river and climbs up out of the canyon to the south finally reaching primitive roads above Dry Fork that go on to the Burgess Ranger Station on US Highway 14 on top of the Bighorn Mountains. From the start of the Forest Service lands, all along the northwest side of the river there is trail access for about up to the source of the stream and on to the divide on top the Bighorn Mountains.

==Wildlife==

In Wyoming, at the end of the two mile stretch of road from the mouth of the canyon Bighorn National Forest Service lands extend up to and over the top of the Bighorn Mountains. In the Little Bighorn watershed there are cougars, black bears, deer, elk, wild turkeys and other birds and small mammals, all of which are common to the Bighorn Mountains. An occasional moose has been sighted. The floor and sides of the Little Bighorn canyon is notorious for rattlesnakes. Herpetologists from the Bighorn National Forest state that the east facing canyons of the Bighorns have rattlesnakes because they also support a habitat for small mammals, like a mouse and chipmunk population, which are the prey of rattlesnakes.

With the restoration of the black bear population in the Bighorn Mountains, there has been a resurgence of black bear living along the stream as it flows out into Montana, extending down the Little Bighorn Valley in Montana. Ranchers between the mouth of the canyon (at about the Wyoming Montana line) down to Wyola often report black bear groups living in the timber along the river, and travelers on the Montana portion of the Little Horn road will occasionally site bear out in the pastures along the river, and occasionally along the road.

<text>The Battle of Quiberon Bay (known as Bataille des Cardinaux in French) was a decisive naval engagement during the Seven Years&#x27; War. It was fought on 20 November 1759 between the Royal Navy and the French Navy in Quiberon Bay, off the coast of France near Saint-Nazaire. The battle was the culmination of British efforts to eliminate French naval superiority, which could have given the French the ability to carry out their planned invasion of Great Britain. A British fleet of 24 ships of the line under Sir Edward Hawke tracked down and engaged a French fleet of 21 ships of the line under Marshal de Conflans. After hard fighting, the British fleet sank or ran aground six French ships, captured one and scattered the rest, giving the Royal Navy one of its greatest victories, and ending the threat of French invasion for good.

The battle signalled the rise of the Royal Navy in becoming the world&#x27;s foremost naval power, and, for the British, was part of the Annus Mirabilis of 1759.

==Background==
The endemic ill feeling between France and Great Britain during the 18th century turned into open warfare in 1754 and 1755. In 1756 what become known as the Seven Years&#x27; War broke out across Europe, pitching France, Austria and Russia against Britain and Prussia. France supported Austria and Russia in a land campaign against Prussia, and launched what it saw as its main effort in a maritime and colonial offensive against Britain. By the beginning of 1759 neither alliance had the advantage, in either the land or sea campaigns, and both were having serious problems financing the war. In 1759 more than 60% of French revenue went to service its debt, causing numerous shortages. The French navy in particular was overstretched and suffered from the lack of a coherent doctrine, exacerbated by the inexperience verging on incompetence of the Secretary of State for the Navy, Nicolas René Berryer, a former chief of police. Meanwhile, Britain&#x27;s war effort up to early 1756 had been a failure. From the summer of 1757 it came under the control of the assertive new secretary of state for the southern department (foreign minister), William Pitt, who imposed a coordinated strategy. By early 1759 this was beginning to bear fruit.

In response to the British successes, the ministers of the French king Louis XV planned a direct invasion of Britain, which if successful would have decided the war in their favour. An army of 17,000 was collected at Vannes, in the south-east of Brittany, and nearly 100 transports were assembled near Quiberon Bay, plus several warships sailing &quot;en flute&quot;, that is with their guns stripped out to allow them to transport more soldiers. In its final form the French plan required these transports to be escorted by the French Navy.

However, at the best of times the French struggled to crew their full fleet with experienced mariners; landsmen could be used, but even a small deficiency in ship handling translated into a significant handicap in a combat situation. Three years into the war, thousands of French seamen were held as prisoners by the British; many more were engaged in speculative, and occasionally lucrative, privateering careers; and the unhealthy conditions, onerous onboard discipline and poor wages, paid late, acted as a strong disincentive to service. The transports also required at least a cadre of skilled men. By the summer of 1759 the French had 73 ships of the line, the largest warships of the time: 30 serving abroad and 43 in home waters. The ships in home waters required an aggregate complement of about 25,000 men; they were more than 9,000 short of this. The 43 French ships in home waters were split between the Atlantic port of Brest (22 ships) and the Mediterranean port of Toulon, with a small number at two ports on the Bay of Biscay: Lorient and Rochefort. The British had 40 ships of the line in home waters, and a further 15 in their Mediterranean Fleet, which was based in Gibraltar.

Brest was the obvious starting point for the expedition: it was a major port; it was well placed with regard to the prevailing winds; and departure from it minimised the sailing distance and time to the proposed landing site. However, Brest was at the end of a long and relatively infertile peninsula, which made supporting a large number of men there difficult; supplies of food had to come in by sea and were vulnerable to the British blockade. A typhoid epidemic in Brest during 1757–1758 killed over 4,000 French seamen, greatly exacerbating their shortage of experienced sailors. In addition, there was fear of a recurrence of the typhus outbreak. Therefore, the army assembled at Vannes and its transports gathered around the Gulf of Morbihan; the terrain was more fertile, the anchorage was large and sheltered, and men and supplies could readily be despatched from Bordeaux, Rochefort, Nantes, or Orléans.

In August, the French Mediterranean Fleet under Jean-François de La Clue-Sabran attempted to break out past Gibraltar into the Atlantic. The British Mediterranean Fleet under Edward Boscawen caught them and a two-day battle resulted in three French ships of the line being captured, two destroyed, and five blockaded in neutral Cádiz; two escaped the battle to reach Rochefort. The five French ships in Cadiz were blockaded by Boscawen&#x27;s second-in-command, Thomas Brodrick. Five of Boscawen&#x27;s victorious ships were transferred to Admiral Edward Hawke&#x27;s fleet, off Brest.

==Prelude==

During 1759, the British, under Hawke, maintained a close blockade on the French coast in the vicinity of Brest. In that year, the French had made plans to invade England and Scotland, and had accumulated transports and troops around the Loire estuary. The defeat of the Mediterranean fleet at the Battle of Lagos in August made the invasion plans impossible, but Choiseul still contemplated a plan for Scotland, and so the fleet was ordered to escape the blockade and collect the transports assembled in the Gulf of Morbihan.

During the first week of November, a westerly gale came up and, after three days, the ships of Hawke&#x27;s blockade were forced to run for Torbay on the south coast of England. Robert Duff was left behind in Quiberon Bay, with a squadron of five &#x27;fifties&#x27; (ships of the line with 50 cannons) and nine frigates to keep an eye on the transports. In the meantime, a small squadron from the West Indies joined Conflans in Brest and, when an easterly wind came on the 14th, Conflans slipped out. He was sighted by which had remained on station off Brest despite the storms but which failed to rendezvous with Hawke, by and which tried to warn Duff but were apparently chased off by the French, and by the victualler &quot;Love and Unity&quot; returning from Quiberon, which sighted the French fleet at 2 pm on the 15th, 70 miles west of Belle-Isle. She met Hawke the next day and he sailed hard for Quiberon into a SSE gale. Meanwhile, had arrived in Quiberon Bay the night before to warn Duff and he had put his squadron to sea in the teeth of a WNW gale.

==Battle==

Having struggled with unfavourable winds, Conflans had slowed down on the night of the 19th in order to arrive at Quiberon at dawn. 20 miles off Belleisle he sighted seven of Duff&#x27;s squadron. Once he realised that this was not the main British fleet, he gave chase. Duff split his ships to the north and south, with the French van and centre in pursuit, whilst the rearguard held off to windward to watch some strange sails appearing from the west. The French broke off the pursuit but were still scattered as Hawke&#x27;s fleet came into sight. sighted the French at 8.30 and Hawke gave the signal for line abreast.

Conflans was faced with a choice, to fight in his current disadvantageous position in high seas and a &quot;very violent&quot; WNW wind, or take up a defensive position in Quiberon Bay and dare Hawke to come into the labyrinth of shoals and reefs. About 9 am Hawke gave the signal for general chase along with a new signal for the first 7 ships to form a line ahead and, in spite of the weather and the dangerous waters, set full sail. By 2.30 Conflans rounded Les Cardinaux, the rocks at the end of the Quiberon peninsula that give the battle its name in French. The first shots were heard as he did so, although Sir John Bentley in &quot;Warspite&quot; claimed that they were fired without his orders. However the British were starting to overtake the rear of the French fleet even as their van and centre made it to the safety of the bay.

Just before 4 pm the battered surrendered to the , just as Hawke himself rounded The Cardinals. Kersaint attempted to come to the aid of Conflans, but &quot;Thésée&quot; performed her turn without closing her lower gunports; water rushed into the gundeck, and she capsized with only 22 survivors. &quot;Superbe&quot; also capsized, and the badly damaged &quot;Héros&quot; struck her flag to Viscount Howe before running aground on the Four Shoal during the night.
Meanwhile, the wind shifted to the NW, further confusing Conflans&#x27; half-formed line as they tangled together in the face of Hawke&#x27;s daring pursuit. Conflans tried unsuccessfully to resolve the muddle, but in the end decided to put to sea again. His flagship, &quot;Soleil Royal&quot;, headed for the entrance to the bay just as Hawke was coming in on . Hawke saw an opportunity to rake &quot;Soleil Royal&quot;, but &quot;Intrépide&quot; interposed herself and took the fire. Meanwhile, &quot;Soleil Royal&quot; had fallen to leeward and was forced to run back and anchor off Croisic, away from the rest of the French fleet. By now it was about 5 pm and darkness had fallen, so Hawke made the signal to anchor.

During the night eight French ships managed to do what &quot;Soleil Royal&quot; had failed to do, to navigate through the shoals to the safety of the open sea, and escape to Rochefort. Seven ships and the frigates were in the Vilaine estuary (just off the map above, to the east), but Hawke dared not attack them in the stormy weather. The French jettisoned their guns and gear and used the rising tide and northwesterly wind to escape over the sandbar at the bottom of the river Vilaine. One of these ships was wrecked, and the remaining six were trapped throughout 1760 by a blockading British squadron and only later managed to break out and reach Brest in 1761/1762. The badly damaged was lost as she made for the Loire, 150 of her crew surviving the ordeal, and grounded on the Four Shoal during the night.

&quot;Soleil Royal&quot; tried to escape to the safety of the batteries at Croisic, but pursued her with the result that both were wrecked on the Four Shoal beside &quot;Héros&quot;. On the 22nd the gale moderated, and three of Duff&#x27;s ships were sent to destroy the beached ships. Conflans set fire to &quot;Soleil Royal&quot; while the British burnt &quot;Héros&quot;, as seen in the right of Richard Wright&#x27;s painting.

==Aftermath==

The British continued to keep a tight blockade on the French coast, which continued to starve French ports of commerce, further weakening France&#x27;s economy. Hawke attempted to destroy some of the French warships trapped in the Vilaine Estuary, sending in fire ships; but these failed to accomplish the task. Hawke developed a plan for landing on the coast, seizing a peninsula, and attacking the ships from land. However, he was forced to abandon this when orders reached him from Pitt for a different approach, which was ultimately unsuccessful.

The power of the French fleet was broken, and would not recover before the war was over. Combined with admiral Edward Boscawen&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Lagos the previous August, the French invasion threat was removed. Although he had effectively put the French channel fleet out of action for the remainder of the war, Hawke was disappointed he had not secured a more comprehensive victory, asserting that had he had two more hours of daylight the whole enemy fleet would have been taken. Hawke&#x27;s commission was extended and followed by a peerage in 1776.

The naval historian Nicholas Tracey described the battle as &quot;the most dramatic sea battle in the age of sail&quot;, while the naval theorist and historian Alfred Mahan claimed that &quot;The battle of 20 November 1759 was the Trafalgar of this war, and ... the English fleets were now free to act against the colonies of France, and later of Spain, on a grander scale than ever before.&quot; For instance, the French could not follow up their victory in the land battle of Sainte-Foy the following spring for want of reinforcements and supplies from France, and so Quiberon Bay may be regarded as the battle that determined the fate of New France and hence Canada. France experienced a credit crunch as financiers recognised that Britain could now strike at will against French trade. The French government was forced to default on its debt. The battle was one of a series of British victories in 1759 which caused the year to be known as an &quot;annus mirabilis&quot; (Latin for &quot;year of wonders&quot;).

From this battle, and that two months earlier where, under General James Wolfe, the British captured Quebec, comes the Royal Naval toast &quot;May our officers have the eye of a Hawke and the heart of a Wolfe&quot;.

<doc id="477861" wikidata="Q677290" url="?curid=477861" title="Stormbringer (album)">
<text>Stormbringer is the ninth studio album by English rock band Deep Purple, released in November 1974. It was the band&#x27;s second studio album to feature the Mk III lineup including vocalist David Coverdale and bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes.

==Album cover and title==
The cover image of &quot;Stormbringer&quot; is based on a photo. On 8 July 1927 a tornado near the town of Jasper, Minnesota, was photographed by Lucille Handberg. Her photograph has become a classic image, and was used and edited for the album&#x27;s cover. The same photograph was used for Miles Davis&#x27; album &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; in 1970 and Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; album &quot;Tinderbox&quot; in 1986.

&quot;Stormbringer&quot; is the name of the second Elric of Melniboné novel by Michael Moorcock. It is the name of a magical sword described in many novels and comics by Moorcock and others which enjoyed enormous success in the 1960s and &#x27;70s. David Coverdale has denied knowledge of this until shortly after recording the album. In an interview with Charles Shaar Murray in the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; he claimed that the name was from mythology. A few years later, Moorcock collaborated with Blue Öyster Cult to write &quot;Black Blade&quot;, a song that actually was about the sword Stormbringer.

According to Glenn Hughes, the slurred gibberish that is spoken by Coverdale at the beginning of the title track just prior to the first verse is the same backwards dialogue that Linda Blair&#x27;s character utters in the film &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, when she is questioned by the priest.

==Release and reception==

In a retrospective review Alex Henderson of AllMusic writes that &quot;&quot;Stormbringer&quot; falls short of the excellence of &quot;Machine Head&quot; and &quot;Who Do We Think We Are&quot;, but nonetheless boasts some definite classics – including the fiery &quot;Lady Double Dealer,&quot; the ominous title song (a goth metal treasure), the sweaty &quot;High Ball Shooter,&quot; and the melancholy ballad &quot;Soldier of Fortune.&quot;

Guitarist Ritchie Blackmore left Deep Purple following &quot;Stormbringer&quot; and its subsequent tour, publicly citing his dislike for the funky direction the band was taking. Glenn Hughes nevertheless praises the album and Blackmore&#x27;s contributions: &quot;People who listen to &quot;Stormbringer&quot;, please listen...Ritchie Blackmore is damn funky, whether he likes it or not. He played wonderfully on the album.&quot;

===Reissues===
In 1990, the album was remastered and re-released in the US by Metal Blade Records, with distribution by Warner Bros.

The Friday Music label released a version in the United States on 31 July 2007 (along with &quot;Made in Europe&quot; and &quot;Come Taste the Band&quot;). It is unclear which tapes were used as a source for this release, but the label&#x27;s website claims that the album was digitally remastered (but not expanded).

Additionally EMI (Deep Purple&#x27;s label for much of the world outside the US) worked with Glenn Hughes on a remastered, expanded version of the album (much like the &quot;Burn&quot; rerelease) which included bonus remixes and alternative takes.

;35th Anniversary Edition
On 23 February 2009 the 35th Anniversary Edition of &quot;Stormbringer&quot; was released for the European/international market only. The release was expanded into a limited edition two-disc set: the first disc contained the full remastered album along with the new remixes, and the second disc was a DVD containing the quadraphonic mix in 5.1 audio as originally released in the USA on Quad reel back in 1974. After a limited run of the CD/DVD edition, the album became available in a single CD edition. A limited double gatefold vinyl edition was also released.

<text>William Scoresby (5 October 178921 March 1857) was an English whaler, Arctic explorer, scientist and clergyman.

==Early years==
Scoresby was born in the village of Cropton near Pickering south-west of Whitby in Yorkshire. His father, William Scoresby (1760–1829), made a fortune in the Arctic whale fishery and was also the inventor of the barrel crow&#x27;s nest. The son made his first voyage with his father at the age of eleven, but then returned to school, where he remained until 1803.

After this he became his father&#x27;s constant companion, and accompanied him as chief officer of the whaler &quot;Resolution&quot; when on 25 May 1806, he succeeded in reaching 81°30&#x27; N. lat. (19° E. long), for twenty-one years the highest northern latitude attained in the eastern hemisphere. During the following winter, Scoresby attended the natural philosophy and chemistry classes at Edinburgh University, and again in 1809.

==Scientist==
In his voyage of 1807, Scoresby began the study of the meteorology and natural history of the polar regions. Earlier results included his original observations on snow and crystals; and in 1809 Robert Jameson brought certain Arctic papers of his before the Wernerian Society of Edinburgh, which at once elected him to its membership.

In 1811, Scoresby&#x27;s father resigned to him the command of the &quot;Resolution&quot;. In the same year he married the daughter of a Whitby shipbroker. In his voyage of 1813, he established for the first time the fact that the polar ocean has a warmer temperature at considerable depths than it has on the surface, and each subsequent voyage in search of whales found him no less eager of fresh additions to scientific knowledge. His letters of this period to Sir Joseph Banks, whose acquaintance he had made a few years earlier, no doubt gave the first impulse to the search for the North-West Passage which followed. On 29 June 1816, commanding the &quot;Esk&quot; on his fifteenth whaling voyage from Whitby, Scoresby encountered grave problems when ice damaged his ship. With the aid of his brother-in-law&#x27;s crew on board the &quot;John&quot;, and after agreeing to surrendering much of their catch, the &quot;Esk&quot; was repaired, of which Scoresby recounted in his 1820 book &quot;The Northern Whale-Fishery&quot;.

In 1819, Scoresby was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Robert Jameson, John Playfair and Sir G S Mackenzie. About the same time he communicated a paper to the Royal Society of London: &quot;On the Anomaly in the Variation of the Magnetic Needle&quot;. In 1820, he published &quot;An Account of the Arctic Regions and Northern Whale Fishery&quot;, in which he gathers up the results of his own observations, as well as those of previous navigators.

In 1820 and 1821 he commanded on whale hunting voyages to the Greenland whale fishery. In 1821 he was accompanied on the &quot;Baffin&quot; (1820) of Liverpool to Greenland by George Manby, who wished to test a new type of harpoon for whaling, based on the same principles as his Manby mortar. Manby published his account in 1822 as &quot;&quot;, containing observations on the flora and fauna of the Arctic regions as well as the practice of whale hunting.

In his voyage of 1822 to Greenland, Scoresby surveyed and charted with remarkable accuracy 400 miles of the east coast, between 69° 30&#x27; and 72° 30&#x27;, thus contributing to the first real and important geographic knowledge of East Greenland. This, however, proved to be the last of his Arctic voyages. On his return, he learnt of his wife&#x27;s death, and this event, with other influences acting upon his naturally pious spirit, decided him to enter the church.

Scoresby&#x27;s &quot;Journal of a Voyage to the Northern Whale Fishery, including Researches and Discoveries on the Eastern Coast of Greenland&quot; (1823), appeared at Edinburgh. In 1824, the Royal Society elected him a fellow, and in 1827, he became an honorary corresponding member of the Paris Academy of Sciences.

From the first, Scoresby worked as an active member and official of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and he contributed especially to the knowledge of terrestrial magnetism. Of his sixty papers in the Royal Society list, many relate to this department of research. However, his observations extended into many other departments, including researches on optics and, with James Joule, comparing electromagnetic (chemical), thermal (coal/steam), and organic (horse) power sources.

To obtain additional data for his theories on magnetism, he made a voyage to Australia in 1856 on board the ill-fated iron-hulled &quot;Royal Charter&quot;, the results of which appeared in a posthumous publication: &quot;Journal of a Voyage to Australia for Magnetical Research&quot;, edited by Archibald Smith (1859). He made two visits to America, in 1844 and 1848; on his return home from the latter visit he made observations on the height of Atlantic waves, the results of which were given to the British Association. He interested himself much in social questions, especially the improvement of the condition of factory operatives.

In 1850, Scoresby published a work urging the prosecution of the search for the Franklin expedition and giving the results of his own experience in Arctic navigation.

==Clerical career==
Scoresby began divinity studies at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge,
enrolling under the ten-year divinity statute and thus becoming a ten-year man, and also became the curate of Bessingby, Yorkshire. In 1834 he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in divinity (BD) from Cambridge University, and in 1839, was awarded an honorary doctorate, Doctor of Divinity (DD). Clerical duties at Bessingby, and later at Liverpool, Exeter and Bradford, co-existed with his interest in science. He published numerous works and papers of a religious character.

From 1839 to 1846 Scoresby was vicar of Bradford, Yorkshire, a &quot;large, industrial, dissenting parish&quot;, also described as an &quot;ever-expanding, raucous, restless industrial conurbation&quot;, across. The appointment to Bradford had been in the hands of the Simeon Trust, since Charles Simeon&#x27;s death in 1836. His predecessor Henry Heap (died 1839), had let the administration slide. There were 13 Bradford curates, counting incumbent perpetual curates, who included Patrick Brontë and William Morgan (1782–1858). There were new churches, such as St James&#x27;s built by John Wood, and one at Wibsey under construction by the Hardy family, ironmasters.

Scoresby addressed matters in hand, but succeeded only in generating contentious issues. On finance, he took on Wood in 1840, over surplice fees in his new church, and was opposed by Wood&#x27;s &quot;factory movement&quot; allies and others. St James&#x27;s was closed for a period, and Wood moved away to the south. Scoresby believed in smaller catchment districts for churches; he clashed with Morgan over this issue. He tried unsuccessfully to divide the parish in 1843. Suffering a breakdown in health, Scoresby resigned as vicar in 1846, after a tour in the US to look at industrial conditions. He took no further permanent clerical posts.

==Personal==
Scoresby married three times. After his third marriage (1849), he built a villa at Torquay, where he was appointed honorary lecturer at the Parish church of St Mary Magdalene, Upton.

He died in Torquay on 21 March 1857. He is buried in the churchyard at Upton and commemorated by a memorial which is decorated with mariner&#x27;s compass and dividers, and a Bible.
He is also memorialised on the family grave in Whitby.
His sister Arabella Scoresby was mother to the physician Robert Edmund Scoresby-Jackson FRSE.

==Legacy==
A number of places have been named after him, including:
* the Lunar crater Scoresby
* Scoresbysund, now Ittoqqortoormiit on the east coast of Greenland
* the Scoresby Sund fjord system
* the Melbourne suburb of Scoresby, Victoria in Australia, which is 25 km southeast of the CBD
* RRS &quot;William Scoresby&quot;, an early-twentieth-century research vessel in the employ of the British scientific organisation, Discovery Investigations;
** William Scoresby Bay and the William Scoresby Archipelago, off the Antarctic coast, are named after RRS &quot;William Scoresby&quot;.
* Scoresby Land in Greenland
* Cape Scoresby (66°34′S 162°45′E / 66.567°S 162.75°E / -66.567; 162.75), bluff marking the north end of Borradaile Island.
* Scoresbyøya, which means Scoresby Island in English. A small island of 6 km2, north of Nordaustlandet, Svalbard, Norway.

==References in literature==
Herman Melville&#x27;s main character Ishmael quotes Scoresby in the Cetology chapter of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;: &quot;&#x27;No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled Cetology,&#x27; says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.&quot;

Philip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; trilogy features a character named Lee Scoresby, an intrepid explorer, old Arctic hand, and balloon aeronaut. Pullman has stated that the character was named after William Scoresby and Lee Van Cleef.

Scoresby is named in H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s science fiction-horror novella, &quot;At the Mountains of Madness,&quot; as having observed and drawn &quot;some of the wilder forms&quot; of arctic mirages.

<doc id="477889" wikidata="Q718070" url="?curid=477889" title="Achaeus of Eretria">
<text>Achaeus of Eretria (; born 484 BC in Euboea) was a Greek playwright and author of tragedies and satyr plays. He is variously said to have written 24, 30, or 44 plays, of which 19 titles are known: &quot;Adrastus&quot;, &quot;Aethon&quot;, &quot;Alcmeon&quot;, &quot;Alphesiboea&quot;, &quot;Athla&quot;, &quot;Azanes&quot;, &quot;Cycnus&quot;, &quot;Eumenides&quot;, &quot;Hephaestus&quot;, &quot;Iris&quot;, &quot;Linus&quot;, &quot;Moirai&quot; (Fates), &quot;Momus&quot;, &quot;Oedipus&quot;, &quot;Omphale&quot;, &quot;Philoctetes&quot;, &quot;Phrixus&quot;, &quot;Pirithous&quot;, and &quot;Theseus&quot;. Achaeus of Eretria was regarded in antiquity as being the second greatest writer of satyr plays, after Aeschylus.

Achaeus&#x27; first play was produced in 447 BC and won a prize. A quote in Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;The Frogs&quot; suggests he was dead by around 405 BC. Some classicists suggest that the fact that he only won a single prize was due to his non-Athenian birth, as the men of Athens were loath to honour any but their own fellow-citizens.

Achaeus of Eretria belongs to the classic age, but is not recognized as a classic writer. His satyric plays were much admired for their spirited style, albeit somewhat laboured and lacking in clarity. The philosopher Menedemus thought his plays second only to Aeschylus, he was part of the Alexandrian &quot;&quot;, and Didymus wrote a commentary on him. Athenaeus (10.451c) describes him as having a lucid style, but with tendencies to obscurity. Athenaeus also claimed that Euripides took a line from Achaeus, while Aristophanes quotes him twice, in &quot;The Frogs&quot; and &quot;The Wasps&quot;.

His work survives only in fragments, as well as the titles of seven satyr plays and eleven tragedies, which are as follows:

== Tragedies ==
*Adrastos (&quot;Ἀδράστος&quot;)
*Azanes (&quot;Ἀζάνες&quot;)
*Athla (&quot;Ἆθλα&quot;)
*Alphesiboia (&quot;Ἀλφεσίβοια&quot;)
*Eumenides (&quot;Εὐμενίδης&quot;)
*Theseus (&quot;Θησεύς&quot;)
*Kyknos (&quot;Κύκνος&quot;)
*Momos (&quot;Μώμος&quot;)
*Oedipus (&quot;Οἰδίπους&quot;)
*Peirithous (&quot;Πειρίθους&quot;)
*Philoctetes in Troy (&quot;Φιλοκτήτης ἐν Τροίαι&quot;)
*Phrixos (&quot;Φρίξος&quot;)

<doc id="477896" wikidata="Q157713" url="?curid=477896" title="Tulle">
<text>Tulle (; ) is a commune in central France. It is the third-largest town in the former region of Limousin and is the capital of the department of Corrèze, in the region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine. Tulle is also the episcopal see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tulle.

Stretching over more than three kilometres in the narrow and tortuous Corrèze valley, Tulle spreads its old quarters on the hillside overlooking the river, while the Notre-Dame cathedral emerges from the heart of the town. Known sometimes as &quot;the town on seven hills&quot;, Tulle rose to prominence through the development of its manufacturing sector.

== Geography ==
Tulle is the third largest town in Limousin, behind Limoges and Brive-la-Gaillarde. It is situated in a very deep part of the river Corrèze valley, at its confluence with several of its tributaries, the Solane and the Céronne on the right bank, and the Saint-Bonnette and the Montane on the left bank. It stretches along a very narrow strip several kilometres long from the northeast to the southwest.

Tulle is located at the crossroads of several communication routes:

* Bordeaux - Clermont-Ferrand - Lyon axis: RD 1089 and the A89 motorway;
* Uzerche - Sévérac-le-Château axis: link between the A20 and the A75 via Tulle, Argentat-sur-Dordogne, Aurillac, Montsalvy, Espalion and Laissac. This corresponds to taking the RD 1120 then the departmental roads 920 and 28 and finally the RN 88.

Tulle station has rail connections to Brive-la-Gaillarde, Ussel and Bordeaux. Tulle is the meeting point between the South-West of France and the Massif Central. It is the former capital of Bas-Limousin, whose boundaries correspond approximately to the current department of Corrèze.

==History==

===Antiquity===
The origins of the town are still subject to debate today but it would seem that the present puy Saint-Clair, a rocky spur with steep slopes separating the Corrèze valley from that of the Solane, was an ideal location for the establishment of a Gallic oppidum. For a long time, it seems that the town has been an important crossroads on the road between Armorique and the Mediterranean Sea and on the road between Aquitaine and the Rhone Valley, both of which crossed the Corrèze at this point by a ford.

With the Roman occupation, the place would have been converted into a necropolis and temple in honour of Tutela, a Roman divine power to whom the protection of people, things and especially places was entrusted, would have been built. This Roman goddess, protector of the travellers who used to use the ford, is the namesake of the city. The temple of Tutela must have been located in the Trech district, whose name refers to the crossing of a river. The real urban centre of the region moved a few kilometres north, to the commune of Naves and the site of Tintignac, which became a crossroads between the Roman roads that followed the ancient routes of the Celtic period.

===Middle Ages===
The Merovingian period would have seen the Christianization of the city and the establishment of three places of worship dedicated to St. Martin, St. Peter and St. Julian. The city officially entered history only with the transformation in the 7th century of the church dedicated to Saint Martin into a monastery under the impetus of Calmine, already founder of the monastery of Mozat in Auvergne. Around the places of worship began to gather the inhabitants of the country and Tulle became once again an urban centre, a status lost since the Roman conquest.

The town was plundered several times by the Vikings, despite being several hundred kilometres from the sea, and it was during one of these sackings, in 846, that the first monastery was destroyed. To warn the inhabitants of the town of the arrival of the Vikings, a watchtower was built on a rocky promontory at Cornil, a few kilometres downstream from the Corrèze. 

The place was nevertheless considered safe by many churches on the Atlantic coast who had sent their relics there to preserve them from looting, notably those of Saint Clair, Saint Lô and Saint Baumard. The monastery was later rebuilt but disappeared in the 11th century. In 1989, excavations under the nave of the present cathedral uncovered the remains of an apsidiole dating from the Carolingian period as well as a poly-lobed portal of Mozarabic influence.

New constructions are undertaken for the abbey, now dedicated to Saint Martin and converted to Benedictine rule in the 11th century. On a visit to Tulle in 1095, Pope Urban II granted it his protection. The first stone of the new abbey church was laid in 1130 but the building was not completed until two centuries later. The spire of the 12th century culminates at a height of 75 metres, making it the highest in Limousin. In 2005, during construction in the vicinity of the cathedral, excavations uncovered the north wall of the medieval church of Saint-Julien, the discovery of a cemetery and three granite sarcophagi dating from the High Middle Ages. In addition, the Gothic cloister is the last one preserved in Limousin.

In 1317, Pope John XXII created the diocese of Tulle by detaching fifty-two parishes from the diocese of Limoges and the abbey-church became a cathedral. During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, the English took the city in 1346 before being driven out of it a month later by the Count of Armagnac, suffering in quick succession two trying sieges during which the inhabitants were reduced to famine. In 1370, the city sided with the King of France, Charles V, which earned it tax exemption and the ennoblement of several bourgeois families. But in 1373, the Duke of Lancaster appeared before the city and demanded that the gates be opened to him, and, in the absence of any command, a representative assembly of the population was convened and decided to carry out a new sacking. The pardon of the King of France for this betrayal took place in 1375.

The Black Death hit the city in 1348 and, on the evening of 23 June, in despair, the city authorities decided to march behind a statue of Saint John to stop what was considered a divine scourge. The plague ceased shortly afterwards, and the Tullists promised to renew this procession every year. It is still perpetuated today and is called the &quot;Procession of the Lunade&quot;.

At the beginning of the 15th century, the town fell victim to the so-called &quot;roadmen&quot;, brigands such as Jean de La Roche who set fire to the town in 1426 or Rodrigue de Villandrando to whom the town had to pay a large ransom in order to be spared in 1436. In 1430, the bishop recognised the power of thirty-four prud&#x27;hommes, also called &quot;boniviri&quot;, who had military and financial powers but who had in fact been dealing with the affairs of the community unofficially since the 13th century. In 1443, Charles VII convened the Estates General of Bas-Limousin in Tulle.

The town was then divided between l&#x27;Enclos, the district around the abbey-church where the nobles, bourgeois and clerics lived, and the upper town, where most of the population lived, around the castle, located on the puy Saint-Clair and which is still characterized today by its narrow, steep streets, sometimes with stairs. In the 14th century, several noble families (Saint-Martial de Puy-de-Val, Rodarel de Seilliac, ...) began to extend the town on the left bank of the Corrèze, opposite the Cathedral, in the Alverge district, on the road towards Auvergne. In the 15th century, the city expanded outside its ramparts, in suburbs along the roads towards Aquitaine and the South (la Barrière and le Pilou), to Limoges and Paris (la Barussie, le Trech, le Fouret, la Rivière) and towards Auvergne (l&#x27;Alverge and le Canton).

===Modern period===
The abbey is practically disused with the secularization of 1514. The bishop had a castle built and the refectory became the seat of the court. In 1566, King Charles IX endows the town with a town hall and a consulate which definitively reduces the power of the bishop.

During the Wars of Religion, Tulle held out for the Catholics; the town first resisted the Huguenots in 1577, but the troops of the Viscount of Turenne took bloody revenge in 1585. They ransacked and devastated the town after an assault that the Protestant poet Agrippa d&#x27;Aubigné recounted.

In the 16th century, the nobles and bourgeois of Tulle engaged in a veritable architectural competition, of which buildings with finely crafted facades in Renaissance style such as the Hôtel de Lauthonye (1551), the Hôtel de Ventadour or the Loyac house described by Prosper Mérimée in 1838, still stand today. In the 16th century, a college was created and in 1620, teaching was entrusted to the Jesuits. In 1670, the town was equipped with a general hospital.

Numerous religious congregations settled in the town, the Recollects (1601), the Poor Clares (1605), the Feuillants (1615), the Ursulines (1618), the Bernardines (1622), the Visitandines and the Carmelites (1644) as well as the Benedictines in 1650. In 1705, Sister Marcelline Pauper founded a house in Tulle for the congregation of the Sisters of Charity of Nevers, to relieve the misery of the people and to teach children to read.

From the 17th century onwards, new economic activities appeared, the mills on the Corrèze and Solane rivers being used to produce paper for example. The lace craft develops and the &quot;poinct de Tulle&quot; develops until its fame becomes worldwide, tulle being frequently used for wedding dresses in particular. It was also the beginning of the arms industry in Tulle with the establishment of a factory in 1691 resulting from the collaboration between the master harquebusier Pauphile and the financier Fénis de Lacombe. The firearms factory will become a royal factory in 1777.

The mutilations of the cathedral and the abbey buildings were very significant during the French Revolution because, converted into a weapons factory, all the fittings, including the irons supporting the dome, were torn off for recovery, causing the collapse of the dome, the chevet, the transept and the north gallery of the cloister in 1796. The Episcopal Palace, two parish churches and several chapels in the suburbs were destroyed during the Revolution. The church was reopened for worship in 1803 but did not regain its title of cathedral until 1823, while the dome was never rebuilt, the nave being simply closed and the open space used for a promenade along the Corrèze on the current Quai Edmond-Perrier. 

===Contemporary era===

==== From the 19th century to World War II ====
During the 19th century, the physiognomy of Tulle changed a lot. A railway station opened in Souilhac district in 1871 and the town was then connected to the national railway network via Brive-la-Gaillarde. At the same time, new industries were created, notably the firearms factory. In 1886, the latter was nationalized and settled in the new district of Souilhac, along the Céronne, a river that would provide it with electricity with the construction of a hydroelectric power station in 1888. 

From 1917 onwards, trains passing on the nearby tracks would supply the thermal power station with coal at the level of the present Socio-Cultural Centre. Up to 5,000 employees worked at the &quot;Manu&#x27;&quot; as it was then known. The Manu&#x27; was the economic lung of the city and influenced the social composition of the Tullist population, which was strongly coloured by the workers.

The urban junction between the working-class district of Souilhac and the historic district of the cathedral is made by the urbanization of the current avenue Victor-Hugo. As in many other French cities inspired by the renovations of Baron Haussmann in Paris, the end of the 19th century saw the city open up, notably with the construction of the current Avenue du Général-de-Gaulle in the Trech district and the enlargement of the Place de la Cathédrale. At the same time, work was undertaken to limit the frequent floods and to clean up the city by burying the Solane river, which until then had flowed at the foot of the buildings. 

The city also acquired new public buildings in its role as the prefecture and main city of the department, such as the construction of the Town Hall (former bishopric), the Prefecture, the Hôtel Marbot (former Grand Séminaire), the Law Courts, the Post Office, the Halle-Gymnase (now the Latreille Hall) and the Lycée Edmond-Perrier, many of which were built in an Art Nouveau style. Completed in 1899, the Theatre is a monument of Anatole de Baudot, the first building of its kind in the world in reinforced cement. From the beginning of the 20th century, the town began to spread out on the very steep slopes of the valley and urbanisation spread.

Tulle became a garrison town from 1841, when an infantry regiment settled in the former barracks located on the Champ-de-Mars, on the current site of the Cité administrative, along the Corrèze.

From 1917 to 1922, Tulle was in the spotlight of the French press because of a news item. Over 100 anonymous letters were sent, denouncing all the secrets of the inhabitants of the city. The sender was actually Angele Laval, a spurned and insane woman. This fact inspired Clouzot for his film &quot;Le Corbeau&quot; and Cocteau for his play &quot;La Machine à écrire&quot;.

==== World War II ====
During the Second World War, the 2nd SS Division Das Reich division of the Waffen SS perpetrated a reprisal of civilians in Tulle, following the killing and maiming of some 40 German soldiers in Tulle on 8 June 1944 by the Maquis resistance movement.

On 9 June 1944 a large number of male civilians were rounded up by the SS. Of these, 97 were randomly selected and then hanged from lamp posts and balconies in the town. Another 321 captives were sent to forced labour camps in Germany where 101 died. In total, the actions of the Wehrmacht, the Waffen-SS, and the SD claimed the lives of 213 civilian residents of Tulle.

==== Since the 1960s ====
In the last stages of the Algerian War and its aftermath, four military officers involved in instigating a failed coup aimed at deposing President de Gaulle were held in the prison at Tulle. De Gaulle referred at the time to &quot;those idiotic generals playing ball in Tulle Prison&quot;. The four were Raoul Salan, Edmond Jouhaud, Maurice Challe and André Zeller. The last of them to be released was Salan, amnestied on 15 June 1968 in the wake of &quot;The Events&quot; of May 1968.

In 1972, the annex of the Army Technical Teaching School (EETAT) was created in Tulle to train electromechanical engineers, accountants and mechanics. In 1977, an annex of the National Technical School of the Army (ENTSOA) was opened and closed in 1984. It was replaced in 1983 by the Gendarmerie School of Tulle, located in the barracks of La Bachellerie, which today accommodates around 1,100 gendarme students.

The 1973 film &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot;, a political thriller directed by Fred Zinnemann and starring Edward Fox and Michael Lonsdale, is partly set and partly filmed in the Tulle area. Based on Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s 1971 novel &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot;, the film is about a professional assassin known only as the &quot;Jackal&quot;, who is hired to assassinate French president Charles de Gaulle in the summer of 1963 and uses the Tulle area and some of its fictional residents as cover for the preparations for the assassination attempt.

Today, Tulle, prefecture of Corrèze and bishopric, is no longer the seat of a weapons factory. Until the 1980s, MAT had been the largest employer in Limousin, but the state-owned company Giat Industries, now Nexter, has carried out numerous restructurings over the last few decades, reducing the historic Tulle production site to 120 employees. A weapons museum was created in 1979 by the staff of the factory.

Since 1973, the town centre has had a tower, the &quot;Cité administrative&quot; (Administrative City Tower), which has 22 levels and is 86 m high on the river side.

In 1996, Tulle hosted the finish of a stage of the Tour de France starting from Super-Besse (Puy-de-Dôme).

On 6 May 2012, the newly elected president, François Hollande, mayor of Tulle between 2001 and 2008, gave his first speech as President of the French Republic on the Cathedral Square, which was attended by several thousand people, including some 400 French and foreign journalists and several helicopters.

==Economy==
Tulle&#x27;s role as a centre for lace making is highlighted by an &quot;international lace festival&quot; held each August. The town is also home to the Maugein accordion factory, which once employed 200, though this figure is now much reduced. Near to this there was, until recently, a significant armaments manufacturing business, but its site is now (2011) marked only by an armaments museum.

Located in another part of town is a car parts plant owned by the American Borg-Warner company, and employing approximately 300 people.

== Climate ==
Tulle has an oceanic climate under the Köppen classification (&quot;Cfb&quot;). Rainfall is high year-round and temperature differences between seasons are larger than in coastal areas.

==Government==
* Tulle is the seat of the general council of the Corrèze
* Tulle is the seat of the agglomeration community Tulle Agglo
* Tulle is the seat of the canton of Tulle, which consists of the commune of Tulle
* Tulle is the prefecture of the Corrèze department

===Mayors===

Mayors of Tulle since 1949 were:
* Jean Massoulier (1949–1959) for the Radicals
* Jean Montalat (1959–1971) for the SFIO
* Georges Mouly (1971–1977) for the RPR
* Jean Combasteil (1977–1995) for the PCF
* Raymond-Max Aubert (1995–2001) for the RPR
* François Hollande (2001–2008) for the PS (elected President of the Republic in 2012)
* Bernard Combes (2008– ) for the PS

===Politics===
Tulle&#x27;s MP in the National Assembly of France for nearly 15 years was the Socialist François Hollande, who was elected President of the Republic in 2012. Hollande also served as mayor of the town.

<text>Foraminifera ( ; Latin for &quot;hole bearers&quot;; informally called &quot;forams&quot;) are single-celled organisms, members of a phylum or class of Rhizarian protists characterized by streaming granular ectoplasm for catching food and other uses; and commonly an external shell (called a &quot;test&quot;) of diverse forms and materials. Tests of chitin (found in some simple genera, and &quot;Textularia&quot; in particular) are believed to be the most primitive type. Most foraminifera are marine, the majority of which live on or within the seafloor sediment (i.e., are benthic, with different sized species playing a role within the macrobenthos, meiobenthos, and microbenthos), while a smaller number float in the water column at various depths (i.e., are planktonic), which belong to the suborder Globigerinina. Fewer are known from freshwater or brackish conditions, and some very few (nonaquatic) soil species have been identified through molecular analysis of small subunit ribosomal DNA.

Foraminifera typically produce a test, or shell, which can have either one or multiple chambers, some becoming quite elaborate in structure. These shells are commonly made of calcium carbonate () or agglutinated sediment particles. Over 50,000 species are recognized, both living (6,700–10,000) and fossil (40,000). They are usually less than 1 mm in size, but some are much larger, the largest species reaching up to 20 cm.

In modern scientific English, the term &quot;foraminifera&quot; is both singular and plural (irrespective of the word&#x27;s Latin derivation), and is used to describe one or more specimens or taxa: its usage as singular or plural must be determined from context. Foraminifera is frequently used informally to describe the group, and in these cases is generally lowercase.

== History of study ==
The earliest known reference to foraminifera comes from Herodotus, who in the 5th century BCE noted them as making up the rock that forms the Great Pyramid of Giza. These are today recognized as representatives of the genus &quot;Nummulites&quot;. Strabo, in the 1st Century BCE, noted the same foraminifera, and suggested that they were the remains of lentils left by the workers who built the pyramids.

Robert Hooke observed a foraminifera under the microscope, as described and illustrated in his 1665 book &quot;Micrographia:&quot;I was trying several small and single Magnifying Glasses, and casually viewing a parcel of white Sand, when I perceiv&#x27;d one of the grains exactly shap&#x27;d and wreath&#x27;d like a Shell[...] I view&#x27;d it every way with a better Microscope and found it on both sides, and edge-ways, to resemble the Shell of a small Water-Snail with a flat spiral Shell[...]Antonie van Leeuwenhoek described and illustrated foraminiferal tests in 1700, describing them as minute cockles; his illustration is recognizable as being &quot;Elphidium&quot;. Early workers classified foraminifera within the genus &quot;Nautilus&quot;, noting their similarity to certain cephalopods. It was recognised by Lorenz Spengler in 1781 that foraminifera had holes in the septa, which would eventually grant the group its name. Spengler also noted that the septa of foraminifera arced the opposite way from those of nautili and that they lacked a nerve tube.

Alcide d&#x27;Orbigny, in his 1826 work, considered them to be a group of minute cephalopods and noted their odd morphology, interpreting the pseudopodia as tentacles and noting the highly reduced (in actuality, absent) head. He named the group &quot;foraminifères&quot;, or &quot;hole-bearers&quot;, as members of the group had holes in the divisions between compartments in their shells, in contrast to nautili or ammonites.

The protozoan nature of foraminifera was first recognized by Dujardin in 1835. Shortly after, in 1852, d&#x27;Orbigny produced a classification scheme, recognising 72 genera of foraminifera, which he classified based on test shape—a scheme that drew severe criticism from colleagues.

H.B. Brady&#x27;s 1884 monograph described the foraminiferal finds of the &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition. Brady recognized 10 families with 29 subfamilies, with little regard to stratigraphic range; his taxonomy emphasized the idea that multiple different characters must separate taxonomic groups, and as such placed agglutinated and calcareous genera in close relation.

This overall scheme of classification would remain until Cushman&#x27;s work in the late 1920s. Cushman viewed wall composition as the single most important trait in classification of foraminifera; his classification became widely accepted but also drew criticism from colleagues for being &quot;not biologically sound&quot;.

Geologist Irene Crespin undertook extensive research in this field, publishing some ninety papers—including notable work on foraminifera—as sole author as well as more than twenty in collaboration with other scientists.

Cushman&#x27;s scheme nevertheless remained the dominant scheme of classification until Tappan and Loeblich&#x27;s 1964 classification, which placed foraminifera into the general groupings still used today, based on microstructure of the test wall. These groups have been variously moved around according to different schemes of higher-level classification. Pawlowski&#x27;s (2013) use of molecular systematics has generally confirmed Tappan and Loeblich&#x27;s groupings, with some being found as polyphyletic or paraphyletic; this work has also helped to identify higher-level relationships among major foraminiferal groups.

==Taxonomy==
The taxonomic position of the Foraminifera has varied since Schultze in 1854,
who referred to as an order, Foraminiferida. Loeblich (1987) and Tappan (1992) reranked Foraminifera as a class as it is now commonly regarded.

The Foraminifera have typically been included in the Protozoa, or in the similar Protoctista or Protist kingdom. Compelling evidence, based primarily on molecular phylogenetics, exists for their belonging to a major group within the Protozoa known as the Rhizaria. Prior to the recognition of evolutionary relationships among the members of the Rhizaria, the Foraminifera were generally grouped with other amoeboids as phylum Rhizopodea (or Sarcodina) in the class Granuloreticulosa.

The Rhizaria are problematic, as they are often called a &quot;supergroup&quot;, rather than using an established taxonomic rank such as phylum. Cavalier-Smith defines the Rhizaria as an infra-kingdom within the kingdom Protozoa.

Some taxonomies put the Foraminifera in a phylum of their own, putting them on par with the amoeboid Sarcodina in which they had been placed.

Although as yet unsupported by morphological correlates, molecular data strongly suggest the Foraminifera are closely related to the Cercozoa and Radiolaria, both of which also include amoeboids with complex shells; these three groups make up the Rhizaria. However, the exact relationships of the forams to the other groups and to one another are still not entirely clear. Foraminifera are closely related to testate amoebae.

==Anatomy==
The most striking aspect of most foraminifera are their hard shells, or tests. These may consist of one of multiple chambers, and may be composed of protein, sediment particles, calcite, aragonite, or (in one case) silica. Some foraminifera lack tests entirely. Unlike other shell-secreting organisms, such as molluscs or corals, the tests of foraminifera are located inside the cell membrane, within the protoplasm. The organelles of the cell are located within the of the test, and the of the test allow the transfer of material from the pseudopodia to the internal cell and back.

The foraminiferal cell is divided into granular endoplasm and transparent ectoplasm from which a pseudopodial net may emerge through a single opening or through many perforations in the test. Individual pseudopods characteristically have small granules streaming in both directions. Foraminifera are unique in having &quot;granuloreticulose pseudopodia&quot;; that is, their pseudopodia appear granular under the microscope; these pseudopodia are often elongate and may split and rejoin each other. These can be extended and retracted to suit the needs of the cell. The pseudopods are used for locomotion, anchoring, excretion, test construction and in capturing food, which consists of small organisms such as diatoms or bacteria.

Aside from the tests, foraminiferal cells are supported by a cytoskeleton of microtubules, which are loosely arranged without the structure seen in other amoeboids. Forams have evolved special cellular mechanisms to quickly assemble and disassemble microtubules, allowing for the rapid formation and retraction of elongated pseudopodia.

In the gamont (sexual form), foraminifera generally have only a single nucleus, while the agamont (asexual form) tends to have multiple nuclei. In at least some species the nuclei are dimorphic, with the somatic nuclei containing three times as much protein and RNA than the generative nuclei. However, nuclear anatomy seems to be highly diverse. The nuclei are not necessarily confined to one chamber in multi-chambered species. Nuclei can be spherical or have many lobes. Nuclei are typically 30-50 μm in diameter.

Some species of foraminifera have large, empty vacuoles within their cells; the exact purpose of these is unclear, but they have been suggested to function as a reservoir of nitrate.

Mitochondria are distributed evenly throughout the cell, though in some species they are concentrated under the pores and around the external margin of the cell. This has been hypothesised to be an adaptation to low-oxygen environments.

Several species of xenophyophore have been found to have unusually high concentrations of radioactive isotopes within their cells, among the highest of any eukaryote. The purpose of this is unknown.

== Ecology ==

Modern Foraminifera are primarily marine organisms, but living individuals have been found in brackish, freshwater and even terrestrial habitats. The majority of the species are benthic, and a further 50 morphospecies are planktonic. This count may, however, represent only a fraction of actual diversity, since many genetically distinct species may be morphologically indistinguishable.

Benthic foraminifera are typically found in fine-grained sediments, where they actively move between layers; however, many species are found on hard rock substrates, attached to seaweeds, or sitting atop the sediment surface.

The majority of planktonic foraminifera are found in the globigerinina, a lineage within the rotaliida. However, at least one other extant rotaliid lineage, &quot;Neogallitellia&quot;, seems to have independently evolved a planktonic lifestyle. Further, it has been suggested that some Jurassic fossil foraminifera may have also independently evolved a planktonic lifestyle, and may be members of Robertinida.

A number of forams, both benthic and planktonic, have unicellular algae as endosymbionts, from diverse lineages such as the green algae, red algae, golden algae, diatoms, and dinoflagellates. These mixotrophic foraminifers are particularly common in nutrient-poor oceanic waters. Some forams are kleptoplastic, retaining chloroplasts from ingested algae to conduct photosynthesis.

Most foraminifera are heterotrophic, consuming smaller organisms and organic matter; some smaller species are specialised feeders on phytodetritus, while others specialise in consuming diatoms. Some benthic forams construct feeding cysts, using the pseuodopodia to encyst themselves inside of sediment and organic particles. Certain foraminifera prey upon small animals such as copepods or cumaceans; some forams even predate upon other forams, drilling holes into the tests of their prey. One group, the xenophyophores, has been suggested to farm bacteria within their tests, although studies have failed to find support for this hypothesis. Suspension feeding is also common in the group, and at least some species can take advantage of dissolved organic carbon.

A few foram species are parasitic, infecting sponges, molluscs, corals, or even other foraminifera. Parasitic strategies vary; some act as ectoparasites, using their pseudopodia to steal food from the host, while others burrow through the shell or body wall of their host to feed on its soft tissue.

Foraminifera are themselves eaten by a host of larger organisms, including invertebrates, fish, shorebirds, and other foraminifera. It has been suggested, however, that in some cases predators may be more interested in the calcium from foram shells than in the organisms themselves. Several aquatic snail species are known to selectively feed upon foraminifera, often even preferring individual species.

Certain benthic foraminifera have been found to be capable of surviving anoxic conditions for over 24 hours, indicating that they are capable of selective anaerobic respiration. This is interpreted as an adaptation to survive changing oxygenic conditions near the sediment-water interface.

Foraminifera are found in the deepest parts of the ocean such as the Mariana Trench, including the Challenger Deep, the deepest part known. At these depths, below the carbonate compensation depth, the calcium carbonate of the tests is soluble in water due to the extreme pressure. The Foraminifera found in the Challenger Deep thus have no carbonate test, but instead have one of organic material.

Nonmarine foraminifera have traditionally been neglected in foram research, but recent studies show them to be substantially more diverse than previously known. They are known to inhabit disparate ecological niches, including mosses, rivers, lakes and ponds, wetlands, soils, peat bogs, and sand dunes.

== Reproduction ==
The generalized foraminiferal life-cycle involves an alternation between haploid and diploid generations, although they are mostly similar in form. The haploid or gamont initially has a single nucleus, and divides to produce numerous gametes, which typically have two flagella. The diploid or agamont is multinucleate, and after meiosis divides to produce new gamonts. Multiple rounds of asexual reproduction between sexual generations are not uncommon in benthic forms.

Foraminifera exhibit morphological dimorphism associated with their reproductive cycle. The gamont, or sexually reproducing haploid form, is &quot;megalospheric&quot;—that is, its &quot;proloculus&quot;, or first chamber, is proportionally large. The gamont is also known as the &quot;A&quot; form. Gamonts, despite having typically larger proloculi, also generally have smaller overall test diameter than do agamonts.

After reaching maturity, the gamont divides via mitosis to produce thousands of gametes which are also haploid. These gametes all have a full set of organelles, and are expelled from the test into the environment leaving the test undamaged. Gametes are not differentiated into sperm and egg, and any two gametes from a species can generally fertilize each other.

When two gametes combine, they create a diploid, multi-nucleated cell known as the &quot;agamont,&quot; or &quot;B&quot; form. In contrast to the gamont, the agamont is &quot;microspheric&quot;, with a proportionally small first chamber but typically larger overall diameter with more chambers. The agamont is the asexual reproduction phase of the foraminifera; upon reaching adulthood, the protoplasm entirely vacates the test and divides its cytoplasm meiotically via multiple fission to form a number of haploid offspring. These offspring then begin to form their megalospheric first chamber before dispersing.

In some cases the haploid young may mature into a megalospheric form which then reproduces asexually to produce another megalospheric, haploid offspring. In this case, the first megalospheric form is referred to as the &quot;schizont&quot; or &quot;A1&quot; form, while the second is referred to as the gamont or &quot;A2&quot; form.

Maturation and reproduction occur more slowly in cooler and deeper water; these conditions also cause forams to grow larger. &quot;A&quot; forms always seem to be much more numerous than are &quot;B&quot; forms, likely due to the reduced likelihood of two gametes encountering one another and successfully combining.

=== Variations in reproductive mode ===
There is a high degree of diversity in reproductive strategies in different foraminiferal groups.

In unilocular species, the &quot;A&quot; form and &quot;B&quot; form are still present. As in the microspheric morph of multilocular forams, the asexually reproducing &quot;B&quot; form is larger than the sexually reproducing &quot;A&quot; form.

Forams in the family Spirillinidae have amoeboid gametes rather than flagellated. Other aspects of reproduction in this group are generally similar to that of other groups of forams.

The calcareous spirillinid &quot;Patellina corrugata&quot; has a slightly different reproductive strategy than most other foraminifera. The asexually reproducing &quot;B&quot; form produces a cyst that surrounds the entire cell; it then divides within this cyst and the juvenile cells cannibalise the calcite of the parent&#x27;s test to form the first chamber of their own test. These &quot;A&quot; forms, upon maturity, gather into groups of up to nine individuals; they then form a protective cyst around the whole group. Gametogenesis occurs within this cyst, producing very low numbers of gametes. The &quot;B&quot; form larvae are produced inside of the cyst; any nuclei that are not bound into cells are consumed as food for the developing larvae. &quot;Patellina&quot; in &quot;A&quot; form is reportedly dioecious, with sexes referred to as the &quot;plus&quot; and &quot;minus&quot;; these sexes differ in number of nuclei, with the &quot;plus&quot; form having three nuclei and the &quot;minus&quot; form having four nuclei. The &quot;B&quot; form is again larger than the &quot;A&quot; form.

==Tests==

Foraminiferal tests serve to protect the organism within. Owing to their generally hard and durable construction (compared to other protists), the tests of foraminifera are a major source of scientific knowledge about the group.

Openings in the test that allow the cytoplasm to extend outside are called apertures. The &quot;primary&quot; aperture, leading to the exterior, take many different shapes in different species, including but not limited to rounded, crescent-shaped, slit-shaped, hooded, radiate (star-shaped), dendritic (branching). Some foraminifera have &quot;toothed&quot;, flanged, or lipped primary apertures. There may be only one primary aperture or multiple; when multiple are present, they may be clustered or equatorial. In addition to the primary aperture, many foraminifera have &quot;supplemental&quot; apertures. These may form as relict apertures (past primary apertures from an earlier growth stage) or as unique structures.

Test shape is highly variable among different foraminifera; they may be single-chambered (unilocular) or multi-chambered (multilocular). In multilocular forms, new chambers are added as the organism grows. A wide variety of test morphologies is found in both unilocular and multilocular forms, including spiraled, serial, and milioline, among others.

Many foraminifera exhibit dimorphism in their tests, with megalospheric and microspheric individuals. These names should not be taken as referring to the size of the full organism; rather, they refer to the size of the first chamber, or &quot;proloculus&quot;. Tests as fossils are known from as far back as the Ediacaran period, and many marine sediments are composed primarily of them. For instance, the limestone that makes up the pyramids of Egypt is composed almost entirely of nummulitic benthic Foraminifera. It is estimated that reef Foraminifera generate about 43 million tons of calcium carbonate per year.

Genetic studies have identified the naked amoeba &quot;Reticulomyxa&quot; and the peculiar xenophyophores as foraminiferans without tests. A few other amoeboids produce reticulose pseudopods, and were formerly classified with the forams as the Granuloreticulosa, but this is no longer considered a natural group, and most are now placed among the Cercozoa.

== Evolutionary history ==
Molecular clocks indicate that the crown-group of foraminifera likely evolved during the Neoproterozoic, between 900 and 650 million years ago; this timing is consistent with Neoproterozoic fossils of the closely related filose amoebae. As fossils of foraminifera have not been found prior to the very end of the Ediacaran, it is likely that most of these Proterozoic forms did not have hard-shelled tests.

Due to their non-mineralised tests, &quot;allogromiids&quot; have no fossil record.

The mysterious vendozoans of the Ediacaran period have been suggested to represent fossil xenophyophores. However, the discovery of diagenetically altered C27 sterols associated with the remains of &quot;Dickinsonia&quot; cast doubt on this identification and suggest it may instead be an animal. Other researchers have suggested that the elusive trace fossil &quot;Paleodictyon&quot; and its relatives may represent a fossil xenophyophore and noted the similarity of the extant xenophyophore &quot;Occultammina&quot; to the fossil; however, modern examples of &quot;Paleodictyon&quot; have not been able to clear up the issue and the trace may alternately represent a burrow or a glass sponge. Supporting this notion is the similar habitat of living xenophyophores to the inferred habitat of fossil graphoglyptids; however, the large size and regularity of many graphoglyptids as well as the apparent absence of xenophyae in their fossils casts doubt on the possibility. As of 2017 no definite xenophyophore fossils have been found.

Test-bearing foraminifera have an excellent fossil record throughout the Phanerozoic eon. The earliest known definite foraminifera appear in the fossil record towards the very end of the Ediacaran; these forms all have agglutinated tests and are unilocular. These include forms like &quot;Platysolenites&quot; and &quot;Spirosolenites&quot;.
Single-chambered foraminifera continued to diversify throughout the Cambrian. Some commonly encountered forms include &quot;Ammodiscus, Glomospira,&quot; &quot;Psammosphera,&quot; and &quot;Turritellella&quot;; these species are all agglutinated. They make up part of the Ammodiscina, a lineage of spirillinids that still contains modern forms. Later spirillinids would evolve multilocularity and calcitic tests, with the first such forms appearing during the Triassic; the group saw little effects on diversity due to the K-Pg extinction.

The earliest multi-chambered foraminifera are agglutinated species, and appear in the fossil record during the middle Cambrian period. Due to their poor preservation they cannot be positively assigned to any major foram group.

The earliest known calcareous-walled foraminifera are the Fusulinids, which appear in the fossil record during the Llandoverian epoch of the early Silurian. The earliest of these were microscopic, planispirally coiled, and evolute; later forms evolved a diversity of shapes including lenticular, globular, and elongated rice-shaped forms.

Later species of fusulinids grew to much larger size, with some forms reaching 5 cm in length; reportedly, some specimens reach up to 14 cm in length, making them among the largest foraminifera extant or extinct. Fusulinids are the earliest lineage of foraminifera thought to have evolved symbiosis with photosynthetic organisms. Fossils of fusulinids have been found on all continents except Antarctica; they reached their greatest diversity during the Visean epoch of the Carboniferous. The group then gradually declined in diversity until finally going extinct during the Permo-Triassic extinction event.

During the Tournaisian epoch of the Carboniferous, Miliolid foraminifera first appeared in the fossil record, having diverged from the spirillinids within the Tubothalamea. Miliolids suffered about 50% casualties during both the Permo-Triassic and K-Pg extinctions but survived to the present day. Some fossil miliolids reached up to 2 cm in diameter.

The earliest known Lagenid fossils appear during the Moscovian epoch of the Carboniferous. Seeing little effect due to the Permo-Triassic or K-Pg extinctions, the group diversified through time. Secondarily unilocular taxa evolved during the Jurassic and Cretaceous.

The earliest Involutinid fossils appear during the Permian; the lineage diversified throughout the Mesozoic of Eurasia before apparently vanishing from the fossil record following the Cenomanian-Turonian Ocean Anoxic Event. The extant group planispirillinidae has been referred to the involutinida, but this remains the subject of debate.

The Robertinida first appear in the fossil record during the Anisian epoch of the Triassic. The group remained at low diversity throughout its fossil history; all living representatives belong to the Robertinidae, which first appeared during the Paleocene.

The first definite Rotaliid fossils do not appear in the fossil record until the Pliensbachian epoch of the Jurassic, following the Triassic-Jurassic event. Diversity of the group remained low until the aftermath of the Cenomanian-Turonian event, after which the group saw a rapid diversification. Of this group, the planktonic Globigerinina—the first known group of planktonic forams—first appears in the aftermath of the Toarcian Turnover; the group saw heavy losses during both the K-Pg extinction and the Eocene-Oligocene extinction, but remains extant and diverse to this day. An additional evolution of planktonic lifestyle occurred in the Miocene or Pliocene, when the rotaliid &quot;Neogallitellia&quot; independently evolved a planktonic lifestyle.

==Paleontological applications==
Dying planktonic Foraminifera continuously rain down on the sea floor in vast numbers, their mineralized tests preserved as fossils in the accumulating sediment. Beginning in the 1960s, and largely under the auspices of the Deep Sea Drilling, Ocean Drilling, and International Ocean Drilling Programmes, as well as for the purposes of oil exploration, advanced deep-sea drilling techniques have been bringing up sediment cores bearing Foraminifera fossils. The effectively unlimited supply of these fossil tests and the relatively high-precision age-control models available for cores has produced an exceptionally high-quality planktonic Foraminifera fossil record dating back to the mid-Jurassic, and presents an unparalleled record for scientists testing and documenting the evolutionary process. The exceptional quality of the fossil record has allowed an impressively detailed picture of species inter-relationships to be developed on the basis of fossils, in many cases subsequently validated independently through molecular genetic studies on extant specimens

Because certain types of foraminifera are found only in certain environments, their fossils can be used to figure out the kind of environment under which ancient marine sediments were deposited; conditions such as salinity, depth, oxygenic conditions, and light conditions can be determined from the different habitat preferences of various species of forams. This allows workers to track changing climates and environmental conditions over time by aggregating information about the foraminifera present.

In other cases, the relative proportion of planktonic to benthic foraminifera fossils found in a rock can be used as a proxy for the depth of a given locality when the rocks were being deposited.



Since at least 1997, the Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) has been investigated as an analogy for understanding the effects of global warming and of massive carbon inputs to the ocean and atmosphere, including ocean acidification. Humans today emit about 10 Gt of carbon (about 37 Gt CO2e) per year, and at that rate will release a comparable amount to the PETM in about one thousand years. A main difference is that during the PETM the planet was ice-free, as the Drake Passage had not yet opened and the Central American Seaway had not yet closed. Although the PETM is now commonly held to be a case study for global warming and massive carbon emission, the cause, details, and overall significance of the event remain uncertain.

Foraminifera have significant application in the field of biostratigraphy. Due to their small size and hard shells, foraminifera may be preserved in great abundance and with high quality of preservation; due to their complex morphology, individual species are easily recognizable. Foraminifera species in the fossil record have limited ranges between the species&#x27; first evolution and their disappearance; stratigraphers have worked out the successive changes in foram assemblages throughout much of the Phanerozoic. As such, the assemblage of foraminifera within a given locality can be analyzed and compared to known dates of appearance and disappearance in order to narrow down the age of the rocks. This allows paleontologists to interpret the age of sedimentary rocks when radiometric dating is not applicable. This application of foraminifera was discovered by Alva C. Ellisor in 1920.

Calcareous fossil foraminifera are formed from elements found in the ancient seas where they lived. Thus, they are very useful in paleoclimatology and paleoceanography. They can be used, as a climate proxy, to reconstruct past climate by examining the stable isotope ratios and trace element content of the shells (tests). Global temperature and ice volume can be revealed by the isotopes of oxygen, and the history of the carbon cycle and oceanic productivity by examining the stable isotope ratios of carbon; see δ18O and δ13C. The concentration of trace elements, like strontium (Sr), magnesium (Mg), lithium (Li) and boron (B), also hold a wealth of information about global temperature cycles, continental weathering, and the role of the ocean in the global carbon cycle. Geographic patterns seen in the fossil records of planktonic forams are also used to reconstruct ancient ocean currents.

==Modern uses==
The oil industry relies heavily on microfossils such as forams to find potential hydrocarbon deposits. For the same reasons they make useful biostratigraphic markers, living foraminiferal assemblages have been used as bioindicators in coastal environments, including indicators of coral reef health. Because calcium carbonate is susceptible to dissolution in acidic conditions, foraminifera may be particularly affected by changing climate and ocean acidification. 

Foraminifera have many uses in petroleum exploration and are used routinely to interpret the ages and paleoenvironments of sedimentary strata in oil wells. Agglutinated fossil foraminifera buried deeply in sedimentary basins can be used to estimate thermal maturity, which is a key factor for petroleum generation. The Foraminiferal Colouration Index (FCI) is used to quantify colour changes and estimate burial temperature. FCI data is particularly useful in the early stages of petroleum generation (about 100 °C).

Foraminifera can also be used in archaeology in the provenancing of some stone raw material types. Some stone types, such as limestone, are commonly found to contain fossilised foraminifera. The types and concentrations of these fossils within a sample of stone can be used to match that sample to a source known to contain the same &quot;fossil signature&quot;.

<text>Patricia (&quot;Pat&quot;) P. Crowther (born 1943), later known as Patricia P. Wilcox, is an American cave explorer and cave surveyor active in the 1960s and early 1970s. She also worked as a computer programmer.

Crowther was well-known among Kentucky cavers for her slight frame (she weighed 115 pounds) and her extreme dedication. These two traits led her to pursue promising leads that other cavers were unwilling or unable to attempt. Of particular note is her traversal of a narrow canyon known as &quot;The Tight Spot&quot; in the portion of the Flint Ridge Cave System underlying Houchins Valley. The Tight Spot proved to be the critical juncture leading to the passages connecting Mammoth Cave and the Flint Ridge Cave System. Both Patricia Crowther and her then-husband Will Crowther, also a computer programmer, participated in many expeditions that attempted to connect the caves. She was part of the September 9, 1972 expedition that discovered and surveyed the historic final connection.

Crowther earned a B.S. degree in physics at MIT where she met and married William. The couple had two daughters, Sandy and Laura, and divorced in 1976. Later that year, William would go on to create &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;, one of the first examples of interactive fiction, based on his caving experiences with Pat in the Mammoth Cave system as a way to connect with his daughters after the divorce. Pat first encountered the game at a Boston meeting of the Cave Research Foundation in 1976 or 1977. Though embellished to include elements like an underground volcano, cavers noted that the game was accurate to Crowther&#x27;s maps and descriptions. 

In 1977, Crowther married John Wilcox, who had led the cave connection expeditions. They were married for 33 years until his death on September 1, 2010. 

Crowther authored &quot;The Grand Kentucky Junction&quot;, an account of the expeditions undertaken to connect the Mammoth and Flint Ridge cave systems.

Crowther participated in the 1997 National Geographic documentary &quot;Mysteries Underground,&quot; which discussed the connection of the Flint Ridge Cave System with Mammoth Cave&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="477912" wikidata="Q7320374" url="?curid=477912" title="Rhema">
<text>Rhema (ῥῆμα in Greek) literally means an &quot;utterance&quot; or &quot;thing said&quot; in Greek. It is a word that signifies the action of utterance.

In philosophy, it was used by both Plato and Aristotle to refer to propositions or sentences.

In Christianity, it is used in reference to the concept of &quot;Rhemata Christou&quot;, Jesus Christ&#x27;s sayings.

==Etymology==
The Greek noun &quot;saying, utterance, word, verb&quot; is analyzed as consisting of the root ἐρ-/ῥε- (er-/rhe-) &quot;say&quot; (cf. &quot;I say&quot;; ἐρῶ &quot;I will say&quot;) and the suffix -μα (-ma), a suffix used to form nouns from verbs.

==Greek philosophers==
Both Plato (c. 428–347 BC) and Aristotle (384–322 BC) used the terms &quot;logos&quot;, &quot;rhema&quot; and &quot;onoma&quot;. In Plato&#x27;s usage, a logos (often translatable as a &quot;sentence&quot;) is a sequence in which verbs are mingled with nouns and every logos must have an onoma and rhema. For Plato, every logos was either true or false and in a logos, names included rhema &quot;which denotes actions&quot; and onoma a &quot;mark set on those who do the actions&quot;. Aristotle identified three components as central to the proposition: &quot;onoma&quot;, &quot;rhema&quot; and &quot;logos&quot;. These terms are translated differently depending on the context of the discussion—grammar or logic, as in the table on the right. But it was only in the 12th century that grammarians began to think in terms of units we understand as &quot;subject&quot; and &quot;predicate&quot;.

==Septuagint usage==
The Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek uses the terms &quot;rhema&quot; and &quot;logos&quot; as equivalents and uses both for the Hebrew word &quot;dabar&quot;, as the Word of God.

==In Christianity==

In Christianity, the Greek word &quot;rhema&quot; is useful to distinguish between two meanings of &quot;word&quot;. While both &quot;rhema&quot; and &quot;logos&quot; are translated into the English &quot;word&quot;, in the original Greek there was a substantial distinction.

Some modern usage distinguishes &quot;rhema&quot; from &quot;logos&quot; in Christian theology, with &quot;rhema&quot; at times called &quot;spoken word&quot;, referring to the revelation received by disciples when the Holy Spirit &quot;speaks&quot; to them. In this usage, &quot;Logos&quot; refers to Christ.

<doc id="477917" wikidata="Q1192405" url="?curid=477917" title="Lemur">
<text>Lemurs ( ; from Latin ) are wet-nosed primates of the superfamily Lemuroidea ( ), divided into 8 families and consisting of 15 genera and around 100 existing species. They are endemic to the island of Madagascar. Most existing lemurs are small, have a pointed snout, large eyes, and a long tail. They chiefly live in trees and are active at night. 

Lemurs share resemblance with other primates, but evolved independently from monkeys and apes. Due to Madagascar&#x27;s highly seasonal climate, lemur evolution has produced a level of species diversity rivaling that of any other primate group.

Living lemurs range in weight from the mouse lemur to the indri. Since the arrival of humans on the island around 2,000 years ago, over a dozen species of &quot;giant lemurs&quot; larger than living lemur species have become extinct, including the gorilla-sized &quot;Archaeoindris&quot;. Lemurs share many common basal primate traits, such as divergent digits on their hands and feet, and nails instead of claws (in most species). However, their brain-to-body size ratio is smaller than that of anthropoid primates. As with all strepsirrhine primates, they have a &quot;wet nose&quot; (rhinarium).

Lemurs are generally the most social of the strepsirrhine primates, living in groups known as troops. They communicate more with scents and vocalizations than with visual signals. Lemurs have a relatively low basal metabolic rate, and as a result may exhibit dormancy such as hibernation or torpor. They also have seasonal breeding and female social dominance. Most eat a wide variety of fruits and leaves, while some are specialists. Two species of lemurs may coexist in the same forest due to different diets.

Lemur research during the 18th and 19th centuries focused on taxonomy and specimen collection. Modern studies of lemur ecology and behavior did not begin in earnest until the 1950s and 1960s. Initially hindered by political issues on Madagascar during the mid-1970s, field studies resumed in the 1980s. Lemurs are important for research because their mix of ancestral characteristics and traits shared with anthropoid primates can yield insights on primate and human evolution. Most species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s; however, lemur taxonomic classification is controversial and depends on which species concept is used. 

Many lemur species remain endangered due to habitat loss and hunting. Although local traditions, such as , generally help protect lemurs and their forests, illegal logging, economic privation and political instability conspire to thwart conservation efforts. Because of these threats and their declining numbers, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) considers lemurs to be the world&#x27;s most endangered mammals, noting that up to 90% of all lemur species confront the threat of extinction in the wild within the next 20 to 25 years. Ring-tailed lemurs are an iconic flagship species. Collectively, lemurs exemplify the biodiverse fauna of Madagascar and have facilitated the emergence of eco-tourism. In addition, conservation organizations increasingly seek to implement community-based approaches to save lemur species and promote sustainability.

==Etymology==
Carl Linnaeus, the founder of modern binomial nomenclature, gave lemurs their name as early as 1758. With his declaration of the genus &quot;Lemur&quot; in the 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, he included three species: &quot;Lemur tardigradus&quot; (the red slender loris, now known as &quot;Loris tardigradus&quot;), &quot;Lemur catta&quot; (the ring-tailed lemur), and &quot;Lemur volans&quot; (the Philippine colugo, now known as &quot;Cynocephalus volans&quot;). Although the term &quot;lemur&quot; was first intended for slender lorises, it was soon limited to the endemic Malagasy primates, which have been known as collectively &quot;lemurs&quot; ever since.

The name &quot;lemur&quot; is derived from the Latin term &quot;lemures&quot;, which refers to specters or ghosts that were exorcised during the Lemuria festival of ancient Rome. Linnaeus was familiar with the works of Virgil and Ovid, both of whom mentioned &quot;lemures.&quot; Seeing an analogy that fit with his naming scheme, he adapted the term &quot;lemur&quot; for these nocturnal primates.

It was noted in 2012 that many sources had commonly and falsely assumed that Linnaeus was referring to the ghost-like appearance, reflective eyes, and ghostly cries of Madagascar&#x27;s lemurs when he selected the name. Up until then, it had also been speculated that Linnaeus may also have known that some Malagasy people believed that lemurs were the souls of their ancestors. However, both claims were discredited since according to Linnaeus&#x27; own explanation, the term &quot;lemur&quot; was selected because of the nocturnal activity and slow movements of the red slender loris:

==Evolutionary history==
Lemurs are primates belonging to the suborder Strepsirrhini. Like other strepsirrhine primates, such as lorises, pottos, and galagos, they share ancestral (or plesiomorphic) traits with early primates. In this regard, lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes (simians). Instead, they evolved independently in isolation on Madagascar. All modern strepsirrhines including lemurs are traditionally thought to have evolved from early primates known as adapiforms during the Eocene (56 to 34 mya) or Paleocene (66 to 56 mya). Adapiforms, however, lack a specialized arrangement of teeth, known as a toothcomb, which nearly all living strepsirrhines possess. A more recent hypothesis is that lemurs descended from lorisoids (loris-like) primates. This is supported by comparative studies of the cytochrome b gene and the presence of the strepsirrhine toothcomb in both groups. Instead of being the direct ancestors of lemurs, the adapiforms may have given rise to both the lemurs and lorisoids, a split that would be supported by molecular phylogenetic studies. The later split between lemurs and lorises is thought to have occurred approximately 62 to 65 mya according to molecular studies, although other genetic tests and the fossil record in Africa suggest more conservative estimates of 50 to 55 mya for this divergence. However, the oldest lemur fossils on Madagascar are actually subfossils dating to the Late Pleistocene.

Once part of the supercontinent Gondwana, the island of Madagascar has been isolated since it broke away from eastern Africa (~160 mya), Antarctica (~80–130 mya), and India (~80–90 mya). Since ancestral lemurs are thought to have originated in Africa around 62 to 65 mya, they must have crossed the Mozambique Channel, a deep channel between Africa and Madagascar with a minimum width of about 560 km (350 mi). In 1915, paleontologist William Diller Matthew noted that the mammalian biodiversity on Madagascar (including lemurs) can only be accounted for by random rafting events, where very small populations rafted from nearby Africa on tangled mats of vegetation, which get flushed out to sea from major rivers. This form of biological dispersal can occur randomly over millions of years. In the 1940s, American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson coined the term &quot;sweepstakes hypothesis&quot; for such random events. Rafting has since been the most accepted explanation for the lemur colonization of Madagascar, but until recently, this trip was thought to be very unlikely because strong ocean currents flow away from the island. In , a report demonstrated that around 60 mya both Madagascar and Africa were 1,650 km (1,030 mi) south of their present-day positions, placing them in a different ocean gyre, producing currents that ran counter to what they are today. The ocean currents were shown to be even stronger than today, which would have pushed a raft along faster, shortening the trip to 30 days or less—short enough for a small mammal to survive easily. As the continental plates drifted northward, the currents gradually changed, and by 20 mya the window for oceanic dispersal had closed, effectively isolating the lemurs and the rest of the terrestrial Malagasy fauna from mainland Africa. Isolated on Madagascar with only a limited number of mammalian competitors, the lemurs did not have to compete with other evolving arboreal mammalian groups, such as squirrels. They were also spared from having to compete with monkeys, which evolved later. The intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness of monkeys gave them an advantage over other primates in exploiting the environment.

==Distribution and diversity==

Lemurs have adapted to fill many open ecological niches since making their way to Madagascar. Their diversity in both behavior and morphology (outward appearance) rivals that of the monkeys and apes found elsewhere in the world. Ranging in size from the 30 g (1.1 oz) Madame Berthe&#x27;s mouse lemur, the world&#x27;s smallest primate, to the recently extinct 160–200 kg (350–440 lb) &quot;Archaeoindris fontoynonti&quot;, lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion, varying levels of social complexity, and unique adaptations to the local climate.

Lemurs lack any shared traits that make them stand out from all other primates. Different types of lemurs have evolved unique combinations of unusual traits to cope with Madagascar&#x27;s harsh, seasonal climate. These traits can include seasonal fat storage, hypometabolism (including torpor and hibernation), small group sizes, low encephalization (relative brain size), cathemerality (activity both day and night), and strict breeding seasons. Extreme resource limitations and seasonal breeding are also thought to have given rise to three other relatively common lemur traits: female social dominance, sexual monomorphism, and male–male competition for mates involving low levels of agonism, such as sperm competition.

Before the arrival of humans roughly 1500 to 2000 years ago, lemurs were found all across the island. However, early settlers quickly converted the forests to rice paddies and grassland through slash-and-burn agriculture (known locally as &quot;tavy&quot;), restricting lemurs to approximately 10% of the island&#x27;s area, ~60,000 km2 (23,000 sq mi). Today, the diversity and complexity of lemur communities increases with floral diversity and precipitation and is highest in the rainforests of the east coast. Despite their adaptations for weathering extreme adversity, habitat destruction and hunting have resulted in lemur populations declining sharply, and their diversity has diminished, with the recent extinction of at least 17 species in eight genera, known collectively as the subfossil lemurs. Most of the approximately 100 species and subspecies of lemur are either threatened or endangered. Unless trends change, extinctions are likely to continue.

Until recently, giant lemurs existed on Madagascar. Now represented only by recent or subfossil remains, they were modern forms that were once part of the rich lemur diversity that has evolved in isolation. Some of their adaptations were unlike those seen in their living relatives. All 17 extinct lemurs were larger than the extant (living) forms, some weighing as much as 200 kg (440 lb), and are thought to have been active during the day. Not only were they unlike the living lemurs in both size and appearance, they also filled ecological niches that either no longer exist or are now left unoccupied. Large parts of Madagascar, which are now devoid of forests and lemurs, once hosted diverse primate communities that included more than 20 lemur species covering the full range of lemur sizes.

==Taxonomic classification and phylogeny==

From a taxonomic standpoint, the term &quot;lemur&quot; originally referred to the genus &quot;Lemur&quot;, which currently contains only the ring-tailed lemur. The term is now used in the colloquial sense in reference to all Malagasy primates.

Lemur taxonomy is controversial, and not all experts agree, particularly with the recent increase in the number of recognized species. According to Russell Mittermeier, the president of Conservation International (CI), taxonomist Colin Groves, and others, there are nearly 100 recognized species or subspecies of extant (or living) lemur, divided into five families and 15 genera. Because genetic data indicates that the recently extinct subfossil lemurs were closely related to living lemurs, an additional three families, eight genera, and 17 species can be included in the total. In contrast, other experts have labeled this as taxonomic inflation, instead preferring a total closer to 50 species.

The classification of lemurs within the suborder Strepsirrhini is equally controversial, although most experts agree on the same phylogenetic tree. In one taxonomy, the infraorder Lemuriformes contains all living strepsirrhines in two superfamilies, Lemuroidea for all lemurs and Lorisoidea for the lorisoids (lorisids and galagos). Alternatively, the lorisoids are sometimes placed in their own infraorder, Lorisiformes, separate from the lemurs. In another taxonomy published by Colin Groves, the aye-aye was placed in its own infraorder, Chiromyiformes, while the rest of the lemurs were placed in Lemuriformes and the lorisoids in Lorisiformes.

Although it is generally agreed that the aye-aye is the most basal member of the lemur clade, the relationship between the other four families is less clear since they diverged during a narrow 10 to 12 million-year window between the Late Eocene (42 mya) and into the Oligocene (30 mya). The two main competing hypotheses are shown in the adjacent image.


Lemur taxonomy has changed significantly since the first taxonomic classification of lemurs by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. One of the greatest challenges has been the classification of the aye-aye, which has been a topic of debate up until very recently. Until Richard Owen published a definitive anatomical study in 1866, early naturalists were uncertain whether the aye-aye (genus &quot;Daubentonia&quot;) was a primate, rodent, or marsupial. However, the placement of the aye-aye within the order Primates remained problematic until very recently. Based on its anatomy, researchers have found support for classifying the genus &quot;Daubentonia&quot; as a specialized indriid, a sister group to all strepsirrhines, and as an indeterminate taxon within the order Primates. Molecular tests have now shown Daubentoniidae is basal to all Lemuriformes, and in 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others ignored addressing higher-level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families, including Daubentoniidae.

Relationships among lemur families have also proven to be problematic and have yet to be definitively resolved. To further complicate the issue, several Paleogene fossil primates from outside Madagascar, such as &quot;Bugtilemur&quot;, have been classified as lemurs. However, scientific consensus does not accept these assignments based on genetic evidence, and therefore it is generally accepted that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic. Another area of contention is the relationship between the sportive lemurs and the extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapidae). Formerly grouped in the same family due to similarities in dentition, they are no longer considered to be closely related due to genetic studies.

More taxonomic changes have occurred at the genus level, although these revisions have proven more conclusive, often supported by genetic and molecular analysis. The most noticeable revisions included the gradual split of a broadly defined genus &quot;Lemur&quot; into separate genera for the ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemurs, and brown lemurs due to a host of morphological differences.

Due to several taxonomic revisions by Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others, the number of recognized lemur species has grown from 33 species and subspecies in 1994 to approximately 100 in 2008. With continuing cytogenetic and molecular genetic research, as well as ongoing field studies, particularly with cryptic species such as mouse lemurs, the number of recognized lemur species is likely to keep growing. However, the rapid increase in the number of recognized species has had its critics among taxonomists and lemur researchers. Since classifications ultimately depend on the species concept used, conservationists often favor definitions that result in the splitting of genetically distinct populations into separate species to gain added environmental protection. Others favor a more thorough analysis.
==Anatomy and physiology==

Lemurs vary greatly in size. They include the smallest primates in the world and, until recently, also included some of the largest. They currently range in size from about 30 g (1.1 oz) for Madame Berthe&#x27;s mouse lemur (&quot;Microcebus berthae&quot;) up to 7–9 kg (15–20 lb) for the indri (&quot;Indri indri&quot;) and diademed sifaka (&quot;Propithecus diadema&quot;). One recently extinct species rivaled the gorilla in size, at 160–200 kg (350–440 lb) for &quot;Archaeoindris fontoynonti&quot;.
Like all primates, lemurs have five divergent digits with nails (in most cases) on their hands and feet. Most lemurs possess a laterally compressed, elongated nail, called a toilet-claw, on the second toe and use it for scratching and grooming. In addition to the toilet-claw, lemurs share a variety of other traits with other strepsirrhine primates, which include a rhinarium (or &quot;wet nose&quot;); a fully functional vomeronasal organ, which detects pheromones; a postorbital bar and the lack of postorbital closure (a wall of thin bone behind the eye); orbits (bony sockets that enclose the eye) that are not fully facing forward; left and right mandible (lower jaw) bones that are not fully fused; and a small brain-to-body mass ratio.

Additional traits shared with other prosimian primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less independent of the other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, but not with the visually oriented higher primates. This sense of smell is important in terms of marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.

Lemurs are a diverse group of primates in terms of morphology and physiology. Some lemurs, such as the sportive lemurs and indriids, have longer hind limbs than forelimbs, making them excellent leapers. Indriids also have a specialized digestive system for folivory, exhibiting enlarged salivary glands, a spacious stomach, and an elongated caecum (lower gut) that facilitates fermentation. The hairy-eared dwarf lemur (&quot;Allocebus trichotis&quot;) reportedly has a very long tongue, allowing it to feed on nectar. Likewise, the red-bellied lemur (&quot;Eulemur rubriventer&quot;) has a feathery brush-shaped tongue, also uniquely adapted to feed on nectar and pollen. The aye-aye has evolved some traits that are unique among primates, making it stand out among the lemurs. Such traits include continuously growing, rodent-like front teeth for gnawing through wood and hard seeds; a highly mobile, filiform (filament-shaped) middle finger for extracting food from tiny holes; large, bat-like ears for detecting hollow spaces within trees; and use of self-generated acoustical cues to forage.

Lemurs are unusual since they have great variability in their social structure, yet generally lack sexual dimorphism in size and canine tooth morphology. However, some species tend towards having larger females, and two species of true lemur (genus &quot;Eulemur&quot;), the gray-headed lemur (&quot;E. albocollaris&quot;) and the red lemur (&quot;E. rufus&quot;), exhibit size differences in canine teeth. True lemurs show sexual dichromatism (sexual differences in fur coloration), but the difference between the genders varies from strikingly obvious, as in the blue-eyed black lemur (&quot;E. macaco&quot;), to nearly imperceptible in the case of the common brown lemur (&quot;E. fulvus&quot;).

Crypsis, or the inability of humans to visually distinguish between two or more distinct species, has recently been discovered among lemurs, particularly within the sportive lemurs (&quot;Lepilemur&quot;) and mouse lemurs (&quot;Microcebus&quot;). With sportive lemurs, subspecies were traditionally defined based on slight morphological differences, but new genetic evidence has supported giving full species status to these regional populations. In the case of mouse lemurs, the gray mouse lemur (&quot;M. murinus&quot;), golden-brown mouse lemur (&quot;M. ravelobensis&quot;), and Goodman&#x27;s mouse lemur (&quot;M. lehilahytsara&quot;) were considered the same species until recently, when genetic tests identified them as cryptic species.

===Dentition===
The lemur dentition is heterodont (having multiple tooth morphologies) and derives from an ancestral primate permanent dentition of . Indriids, sportive lemurs, the aye-aye, and the extinct sloth lemurs, monkey lemurs, and koala lemurs have reduced dentitions, having lost incisors, canines, or premolars. The ancestral deciduous dentition is , but young indriids, aye-ayes, koala lemurs, sloth lemurs, and probably monkey lemurs have fewer deciduous teeth.

There are also noticeable differences in dental morphology and tooth topography between lemurs. Indri, for instance, have teeth that are perfectly adapted for shearing leaves and crushing seeds. In the toothcomb of most lemurs, the bottom incisors and canine teeth are procumbent (face forward rather than up) and finely spaced, thus providing a tool for either grooming or feeding. For instance, indri use their toothcomb not only for grooming, but also to pry out the large seeds from the tough epicarp of &quot;Beilschmiedia&quot; fruits, while fork-marked lemurs use their relatively long toothcomb to cut through tree bark to induce the flow of tree sap. The toothcomb is kept clean by the sublingua or &quot;under-tongue&quot;, a specialized structure that acts like a toothbrush to remove hair and other debris. The sublingua extends below the tip of the tongue and is tipped with keratinized, serrated points that rake between the front teeth.

Only the aye-aye, the extinct giant aye-aye, and the largest of the extinct giant sloth lemurs lack a functional strepsirrhine toothcomb. In the case of the aye-aye, the morphology of the deciduous incisors, which are lost shortly after birth, indicates that its ancestors had a toothcomb. These milk teeth are lost shortly after birth and are replaced by open-rooted, continually growing (hypselodont) incisors.
The toothcomb in lemurs normally consists of six teeth (four incisors and two canines), although indriids, monkey lemurs, and some sloth lemurs only have a four-tooth toothcomb due to the loss of either a pair of canines or incisors. Because the lower canine is either included in the toothcomb or lost, the lower dentition can be difficult to read, especially since the first premolar (P2) is often shaped like a canine (caniniform) to fill the canine&#x27;s role. In folivorous (leaf-eating) lemurs, except for indriids, the upper incisors are greatly reduced or absent. Used together with the toothcomb on the mandible (lower jaw), this complex is reminiscent of an ungulate browsing pad.

Lemurs are unusual among primates for their rapid dental development, particularly among the largest species. For example, indriids have relatively slow body growth but extremely fast tooth formation and eruption. By contrast, anthropoid primates exhibit slower dental development with increased size and slower morphological development. Lemurs are also dentally precocious at birth, and have their full permanent dentition at weaning.

Lemurs generally have thin tooth enamel compared to anthropoid primates. This may result in extra wear and breakage to the anterior (front) teeth due to heavy use in grooming, feeding, and fighting. Little other dental health information is available for lemurs, except that wild ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve occasionally exhibit abscessed maxillary canines (seen as open wounds on the muzzle) and tooth decay, possibly due to the consumption of non-native foods.
===Senses===
The sense of smell, or olfaction, is highly important to lemurs and is frequently used in communication. Lemurs have long snouts (compared to the short snouts of haplorrhines) that are traditionally thought to position the nose for better sifting of smells, although long snouts do not necessarily translate into high olfactory acuity since it is not the relative size of the nasal cavity that correlates with smell, but the density of olfactory receptors. Instead, the long snouts may facilitate better chewing.
The wet nose, or rhinarium, is a trait shared with other strepsirrhines and many other mammals, but not with haplorrhine primates. Although it is claimed to enhance the sense of smell, it is actually a touch-based sense organ that connects with a well-developed vomeronasal organ (VNO). Since pheromones are usually large, non-volatile molecules, the rhinarium is used to touch a scent-marked object and transfer the pheromone molecules down the philtrum (the nasal mid-line cleft) to the VNO via the nasopalatine ducts that travel through the incisive foramen of the hard palate.

To communicate with smell, which is useful at night, lemurs will scent mark with urine as well as scent glands located on the wrists, inside elbow, genital regions, or the neck. The scrotal skin of most male lemurs has scent glands. Ruffed lemurs (genus &quot;Varecia&quot;) and male sifakas have a gland at the base of their neck, while the greater bamboo lemur (&quot;Prolemur simus&quot;) and the ring-tailed lemur have glands inside the upper arms near the axilla. Male ring-tailed lemurs also have scent glands on the inside of their forearms, adjacent to a thornlike spur, which they use to gouge, and simultaneously, scent-mark tree branches. They will also wipe their tails between their forearms and then engage in &quot;stink fights&quot; by waving their tail at their opponents.

Lemurs (and strepsirrhines in general) are considered to be less visually oriented than the higher primates, since they rely so heavily on their sense of smell and pheromone detection. The fovea on the retina, which yields higher visual acuity, is not well-developed. The postorbital septum (or bony closure behind the eye) in haplorrhine primates is thought to stabilize the eye slightly, allowing for the evolution of the fovea. With only a postorbital bar, lemurs have been unable to develop a fovea. Therefore, regardless of their activity pattern (nocturnal, cathemeral, or diurnal), lemurs exhibit low visual acuity and high retinal summation. Lemurs can see a wider visual field, however, than anthropoid primates due to a slight difference in the angle between the eyes, as shown in the following table:

Although they lack a fovea, some diurnal lemurs have a cone-rich, although less clustered, area centralis. This area centralis has a high rod-to-cone cell ratio in many diurnal species studied thus far, whereas diurnal anthropoids have no rod cells in their fovea. Once again, this suggests lower visual acuity in lemurs than in anthropoids. Furthermore, the rod-to-cone cell ratio can be variable even among diurnal species. For instance, Verreaux&#x27;s sifaka (&quot;Propithecus verreauxi&quot;) and the indri (&quot;Indri indri&quot;) have only a few large cones scattered along their predominantly rod-dominated retina. The eyes of the ring-tailed lemur contain one cone to five rods. Nocturnal lemurs such as mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs, on the other hand, have retinas made up entirely of rod cells.

Since cone cells make color vision possible, the high prevalence of rod cells in lemur eyes suggest they have not evolved color vision. The most studied lemur, the ring-tailed lemur, has been shown to have blue-yellow vision, but lacks the ability to distinguish red and green hues. Due to polymorphism in opsin genes, which code for color receptivity, trichromatic vision may rarely occur in females of a few lemur species, such as Coquerel&#x27;s sifaka (&quot;Propithecus coquereli&quot;) and the red ruffed lemur (&quot;Varecia rubra&quot;). Most lemurs, therefore, are either monochromats or dichromats.
Most lemurs have retained the tapetum lucidum, a reflective layer of tissue in the eye, which is found in many vertebrates. This trait is absent in haplorrhine primates, and its presence further limits the visual acuity in lemurs. The strepsirrhine choroidal tapetum is unique among mammals because it is made up of crystalline riboflavin, and the resulting optical scattering is what limits visual acuity. Although the tapetum is considered to be ubiquitous in lemurs, there appear to be exceptions among true lemurs, such as the black lemur and the common brown lemur, as well as the ruffed lemurs. Since the riboflavins in the tapetum have a tendency to dissolve and vanish when processed for histological investigation, however, the exceptions are still debatable.

Lemurs also have a third eyelid known as a nictitating membrane, whereas most other primates have a lesser developed plica semilunaris. The nictitating membrane keeps the cornea moist and clean by sweeping across the eye.

===Metabolism===
Lemurs have low basal metabolic rates (BMR), which helps them to conserve energy during the dry season, when water and food are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass. The red-tailed sportive lemur (&quot;Lepilemur ruficaudatus&quot;), for instance, reportedly has one of the lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low metabolic rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss and conserve energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located at the base of the tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the dry season, their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.

==Behaviour==

Lemur behaviour is as variable as lemur morphology. Differences in diet, social systems, activity patterns, locomotion, communication, predator avoidance tactics, breeding systems, and intelligence levels help define lemur taxa and set individual species apart from the rest. Although trends frequently distinguish the smaller, nocturnal lemurs from the larger, diurnal lemurs, there are often exceptions that help exemplify the unique and diverse nature of these Malagasy primates.

===Diet===

Lemur diets are highly variable and demonstrate a high degree of plasticity, although general trends suggest that the smallest species primarily consume fruit and insects (omnivory), while the larger species are more herbivorous, consuming mostly plant material. As with all primates, hungry lemurs might eat anything that is edible, whether or not the item is one of their preferred foods. For instance, the ring-tailed lemur eats insects and small vertebrates when necessary and as a result it is commonly viewed as an opportunistic omnivore. Coquerel&#x27;s giant mouse lemur (&quot;Mirza coquereli&quot;) is mostly frugivorous, but will consume insect secretions during the dry season.

A common assumption in mammalogy is that small mammals cannot subsist entirely on plant material and must have a high-calorie diet in order to survive. As a result, it was thought that the diet of tiny primates must be high in protein-containing insects (insectivory). Research has shown, however, that mouse lemurs, the smallest living primates, consume more fruit than insects, contradicting the popular hypothesis.

Plant material makes up the majority of most lemur diets. Members of at least 109 of all known plant families in Madagascar (55%) are exploited by lemurs. Since lemurs are primarily arboreal, most of these exploited species are woody plants, including trees, shrubs, or lianas. Only the ring-tailed lemur, the bamboo lemurs (genus &quot;Hapalemur&quot;), and the black-and-white ruffed lemur (&quot;Varecia variegata&quot;) are known to consume herbs. While Madagascar is rich in fern diversity, these plants are rarely eaten by lemurs. One possible reason for this is that ferns lack flowers, fruits, and seeds—common food items in lemur diets. They also occur close to the ground, while lemurs spend most of their time in the trees. Lastly, ferns have an unpleasant taste due to the high content of tannins in their fronds. Likewise, mangroves appear to be rarely exploited by lemurs due to their high tannin content. Some lemurs appear to have evolved responses against common plant defenses, however, such as tannins and alkaloids. The golden bamboo lemur (&quot;Hapalemur aureus&quot;), for instance, eats giant bamboo (&quot;Cathariostachys madagascariensis&quot;), which contains high levels of cyanide. This lemur can consume twelve times the typically lethal dose for most mammals on a daily basis; the physiological mechanisms that protect it from cyanide poisoning are unknown. At the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in the United States, lemurs that roam the outdoor enclosures have been observed eating poison ivy (&quot;Taxicodendron radicans&quot;), yet have shown no ill effects.
Many of the larger lemur species consume leaves (folivory), particularly the indriids. However, some smaller lemurs such as sportive lemurs (genus &quot;Lepilemur&quot;) and woolly lemurs (genus &quot;Avahi&quot;) also primarily eat leaves, making them the smallest primates that do so. The smallest of the lemurs generally do not eat much leaf matter. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming leaves from at least 82 native plant families and 15 alien plant families. Lemurs tend to be selective in their consumption of the part of the leaf or shoot as well as its age. Often, young leaves are preferred over mature leaves.

Many lemurs that eat leaves tend to do so during times of fruit scarcity, sometimes suffering weight loss as a result. Most lemur species, including most of the smallest lemurs and excluding some of the indriids, predominantly eat fruit (frugivory) when available. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming fruit from at least 86 native plant families and 15 alien plant families. As with most tropical fruit eaters, the lemur diet is dominated by fruit from &quot;Ficus&quot; (fig) species. In many anthropoid primates, fruit is a primary source of vitamin C, but unlike anthropoid primates, lemurs (and all strepsirrhines) can synthesize their own vitamin C. Historically, captive lemur diets high in vitamin C-rich fruits have been thought to cause hemosiderosis, a type of iron overload disorder, since vitamin C increases iron absorption. Although lemurs in captivity have been shown to be prone to hemosiderosis, the frequency of the disease varies across institutions and may depend on the diet, husbandry protocols, and genetic stock. Assumptions about the problem need to be tested separately for each species. The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, seems to be less prone to the disorder than other lemur species.

Only eight species of lemur are known to be seed predators (granivores), but this may be under-reported since most observations only report fruit consumption and do not investigate whether the seeds are consumed as well. These lemurs include some indriids, such as the diademed sifaka (&quot;Propithecus diadema&quot;), the golden-crowned sifaka (&quot;Propithecus tattersalli&quot;), the indri, and the aye-aye. The aye-aye, which specializes in structurally defended resources, can chew through &quot;Canarium&quot; seeds, which are harder than the seeds that New World monkeys are known to break open. At least 36 genera from 23 families of plants are targeted by lemur seed predators.

Inflorescences (clusters of flowers) of at least 60 plant families are eaten by lemurs ranging in size from the tiny mouse lemurs to the relatively large ruffed lemurs. If the flowers are not exploited, sometimes the nectar is consumed (nectarivory) along with the pollen (palynivory). At least 24 native species from 17 plant families are targeted for nectar or pollen consumption.

Bark and plant exudates such as tree sap are consumed by a few lemur species. The exploitation of exudates has been reported in 18 plant species and only in the dry regions in the south and west of Madagascar. Only the Masoala fork-marked lemur (&quot;Phaner furcifer&quot;) and Coquerel&#x27;s giant mouse lemur regularly consume tree sap. Bark has never been reported as an important food item in lemur diets, but at least four species eat it: the aye-aye, the red-tailed sportive lemur (&quot;Lepilemur ruficaudatus&quot;), the common brown lemur (&quot;Eulemur fulvus&quot;), and Verreaux&#x27;s sifaka (&quot;Propithecus verreauxi&quot;). Most bark feeding is directly linked to exudate feeding, except for the aye-aye&#x27;s bark feeding on &quot;Afzelia bijuga&quot; (genus &quot;Afzelia&quot;) at Nosy Mangabe in the northeast.

Soil consumption (geophagy) has also been reported and likely helps with digestion, provides minerals and salts, and helps absorb toxins. Sifakas have been observed eating soil from termite mounds, possibly adding beneficial intestinal flora to aid the digestion of cellulose from their folivorous diet.

===Social systems===
Lemurs are social and live in groups that usually include fewer than 15 individuals. Observed social organization patterns include &quot;solitary but social&quot;, &quot;fission-fusion&quot;, &quot;pair bonds&quot;, and &quot;multi-male group&quot;. Nocturnal lemurs are mostly solitary but social, foraging alone at night but often nesting in groups during the day. The degree of socialization varies by species, gender, location, and season. In many nocturnal species, for instance, the females, along with their young, will share nests with other females and possibly one male, whose larger home range happens to overlap one or more female nesting groups. In sportive lemurs and fork-marked lemurs, one or two females may share a home range, possibly with a male. In addition to sharing nests, they will also interact vocally or physically with their range-mate while they forage at night. Diurnal lemurs exhibit many of the social systems seen in monkeys and apes, living in relatively permanent and cohesive social groups. Multi-male groups are the most common, just as they are in most anthropoid primates. True lemurs utilize this social system, often living in groups of ten or less. Ruffed lemurs have been shown to live in fission-fusion societies, and Indri forms pair bonds.

Some lemurs exhibit female philopatry, where females stay within their natal range and the males migrate upon reaching maturity, and in other species both sexes will migrate. In some cases, female philopatry may help explain the evolution of female-bonded multi-male groups, such as those of the ring-tailed lemur, Milne-Edwards&#x27; sifaka (&quot;Propithecus edwardsi&quot;), and the Verreaux&#x27;s sifaka. Their ancestors may have been more solitary, with females that lived in mother-daughter pairs (or dyads). Over time, these dyads may have allied themselves with other neighboring mother-daughter dyads in order to defend more distributed resources in a wide home range. If this is true, then multi-male groups in lemurs may differ fundamentally in their internal structure from those in catarrhine primates (Old World monkeys and apes).

The presence of female social dominance sets lemurs apart from most other primates and mammals; in most primate societies, males are dominant unless females band together to form coalitions that displace them. However, many &quot;Eulemur&quot; species are exceptions and the greater bamboo lemur (&quot;Prolemur simus&quot;) does not exhibit female dominance. When females are dominant within a group, the way they maintain dominance varies. Ring-tailed lemur males act submissively with or without signs of female aggression. Male crowned lemurs (&quot;Eulemur coronatus&quot;), on the other hand, will only act submissively when females act aggressively towards them. Female aggression is often associated with, but not limited to, feeding.

There have been many hypotheses that have attempted to explain why lemurs exhibit female social dominance while other primates with similar social structures do not, but no consensus has been reached after decades of research. The dominant view in the literature states that female dominance is an advantageous trait given the high costs of reproduction and the scarcity of resources available. Indeed, female dominance has been shown to be linked to increased maternal investment. However, when reproductive costs and extreme seasonality of resources were compared across primates, other primates demonstrated male dominance under conditions that were similar to or more challenging than those faced by lemurs. In 2008, a new hypothesis revised this model using simple game theory. It was argued that when two individuals were equally matched in fighting capacity, the one with the most need would win the conflict since it would have the most to lose. Consequently, the female, with higher resource needs for pregnancy, lactation, and maternal care, was more likely to win in resource conflicts with equally sized males. This, however, assumed monomorphism between sexes. The following year, a new hypothesis was proposed to explain monomorphism, stating that because most female lemurs are only sexually receptive for a day or two each year, males can utilize a more passive form of mate guarding: copulatory plugs, which block the female reproductive tract, preventing other males from successfully mating with her, and thus reducing the need for aggression and the evolutionary drive for sexual dimorphism.

In general, levels of agonism (or aggression) tend to correlate with relative canine height. The ring-tailed lemur has long, sharp upper canine teeth in both sexes, and it also exhibits high levels of agonism. The Indri, on the other hand, has smaller canines and exhibits lower levels of aggression. When neighboring groups of the same species defend their territories, the conflict can take the form of ritualized defense. In sifakas, these ritualized combats involve staring, growling, scent-marking, and leaping to occupy certain sections of the tree. The indri defends its home range with ritualized &quot;singing&quot; battles.

Like other primates, lemurs groom socially (allogroom) to ease tensions and solidify relationships. They groom in greeting, when waking up, when settling in for sleep, between mother and infant, in juvenile relations, and for sexual advances. Unlike anthropoid primates, who part the fur with the hands and pick out particles with the fingers or mouth, lemurs groom with their tongue and scraping with their toothcomb. Despite the differences in technique, lemurs groom with the same frequency and for the same reasons as anthropoids.
===Activity patterns===
The biological rhythm can vary from nocturnal in smaller lemurs to diurnal in most larger lemurs. Diurnality is not seen in any other living strepsirrhine. Cathemerality, where an animal is active sporadically both day and night, occurs among some of the larger lemurs. Few if any other primates exhibit this sort of activity cycle, either regularly or irregularly under changing environmental conditions. The most heavily studied cathemeral lemurs are the true lemurs. Although the mongoose lemur (&quot;E. mongoz&quot;) is the best-documented example, every species in the genus studied has shown some degree of cathemeral behavior, although night activity is often restricted by light availability and moon periodicity. This type of behavior was first documented in the 1960s in true lemur species as well as other Lemuridae species, such as ruffed lemurs and bamboo lemurs. Initially described as &quot;crepuscular&quot; (active at dawn and dusk), anthropologist Ian Tattersall stimulated additional research and coined the new term &quot;cathemeral&quot;, although many non-anthropologists prefer the terms &quot;circadian&quot; or &quot;diel&quot;.

In order to conserve energy and water in their highly seasonal environment, mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs exhibit seasonal behavioral cycles of dormancy where the metabolic rate and body temperature are lowered. They are the only primates known to do so. They accumulate fat reserves in their hind legs and the base of their tail before the dry winter season, when food and water are scarce, and can exhibit daily and prolonged torpor during the dry season. Daily torpor constitutes less than 24 hours of dormancy, whereas prolonged torpor averages two weeks in duration and signals hibernation. Mouse lemurs have been observed experiencing torpor that lasts for several consecutive days, but dwarf lemurs are known to hibernate for six to eight months every year, particularly on the west coast of Madagascar.

Dwarf lemurs are the only primates known to hibernate for extended periods. Unlike other hibernating mammals from temperate regions, which have to awaken regularly for a few days, dwarf lemurs experience five months of continuous deep hibernation (May through September). Before and after this deep hibernation, there are two months (April and October) of transition, where they will forage on a limited basis to reduce demands on their fat reserves. Unlike any other hibernating mammal, the body temperature of hibernating dwarf lemurs will fluctuate with the ambient temperature rather than remaining low and stable.

Other lemurs that do not exhibit dormancy conserve energy by selecting thermoregulated microhabitats (such as tree holes), sharing nests, and reducing exposed body surfaces, such as by hunched sitting and group huddling. Also, the ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemurs, and sifakas are commonly seen sunning, thus using solar radiation to warm their bodies instead of metabolic heat.

===Locomotion===

Locomotor behavior in lemurs, both living and extinct, is highly varied and its diversity exceeds that of anthropoids. Locomotor postures and behaviors have included vertical clinging and leaping (including saltatory behavior), seen in indriids and bamboo lemurs; slow (loris-like) arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by &quot;Mesopropithecus&quot;; fast arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, seen in true lemurs and ruffed lemurs; partially terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, seen in the ring-tailed lemur; highly terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by monkey lemurs such as &quot;Hadropithecus&quot;; and sloth-like suspensory locomotion, once exhibited by many of the sloth lemurs, such as &quot;Palaeopropithecus&quot;. The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur (&quot;Hapalemur alaotrensis&quot;) has even been reported to be a good swimmer. Sometimes these locomotor types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs, the vertical clingers and leapers and the arboreal (and occasionally terrestrial) quadrupeds.

The jumping prowess of the indriids has been well documented and is popular among ecotourists visiting Madagascar. Using their long, powerful back legs, they catapult themselves into the air and land in an upright posture on a nearby tree, with both hands and feet tightly gripping the trunk. Indriids can leap up to 10 m (33 ft) rapidly from tree trunk to tree trunk, an ability referred to as &quot;ricochetal leaping&quot;. Verreaux&#x27;s sifaka (&quot;Propithecus verreauxi&quot;) manages to do this in the spiny forests of southern Madagascar. It is unknown how it avoids impaling its palms on the thorn-covered trunks of large plants such as &quot;Alluaudia&quot;. When distances between trees are too great, sifakas will descend to the ground and cross distances more than 100 m (330 ft) by standing upright and hopping sideways with the arms held to the side and waving up and down from chest to head height, presumably for balance. This is sometimes described as a &quot;dance-hop&quot;.

===Communication===
Lemur communication can be transmitted through sound, sight, and smell (olfaction). The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, uses complex though highly stereotyped behaviors such as scent-marking and vocalizations. Visual signals are probably the least used by lemurs, since they lack many of the muscles used in common primate facial expressions. Given their poor vision, whole-body postures are probably more noticeable. However, the ring-tailed lemur has demonstrated distinct facial expressions including a threat stare, pulled back lips for submission, and pulled back ears along with flared nostrils during scent-marking. This species has also been observed using yawns as threats. Their ringed tails also communicate distance, warn off neighboring troops, and help locate troop members. Sifakas are known to exhibit an open-mouth play face as well as a submissive teeth-baring grimace used in agonistic interactions.
Olfaction is particularly important to lemurs, except for the indri, which lacks most common lemur scent glands and has a greatly reduced olfactory region in the brain. Olfaction can communicate information about age, sex, reproductive status, as well as demarcate the boundaries of a territory. It is most useful for communication between animals that rarely encounter each other. Small, nocturnal lemurs mark their territories with urine, while the larger, diurnal species use scent glands located on various parts of their anatomy. The ring-tailed lemur engages in &quot;stink fights&quot; by rubbing its tail across scent glands on its wrists and then flicking it at other male opponents. Some lemurs defecate in specific areas, otherwise known as latrine behavior. Although many animals exhibit this behavior, it is a rare trait among primates. Latrine behavior can represent territorial marking and aid in interspecies signaling.

Compared to other mammals, primates in general are very vocal, and lemurs are no exception. Some lemur species have extensive vocal repertoires, including the ring-tailed lemur and ruffed lemurs. Some of the most common calls among lemurs are predator alarm calls. Lemurs not only respond to alarm calls of their own species, but also alarm calls of other species and those of non-predatory birds. The ring-tailed lemur and a few other species have different calls and reactions to specific types of predators. With mating calls, it has been shown that mouse lemurs that cannot be discerned visually respond more strongly to the calls of their own species, particularly when exposed to the calls of other mouse lemurs that they would encounter normally within their home range. Lemur calls can also be very loud and carry long distances. Ruffed lemurs use several loud calls that can be heard up to 1 km (0.62 mi) away on a clear, calm day. The loudest lemur is the indri, whose calls can be heard up to 2 km (1.2 mi) or more and thus communicate more effectively the territorial boundaries over its 34 to 40 hectares (0.13 to 0.15 sq mi) home range. Both ruffed lemurs and the indri exhibit contagious calling, where one individual or group starts a loud call and others within the area join in. The song of the indri can last 45 seconds to more than 3 minutes and tends to coordinate to form a stable duet comparable to that of gibbons.

Tactile communication (touch) is mostly used by lemurs in the form of grooming, although the ring-tailed lemur also clumps together to sleep (in an order determined by rank), reaches out and touches adjacent members, and cuffs other members. Reaching out and touching another individual in this species has been shown to be a submissive behavior, done by younger or submissive animals towards older and more dominant members of the troop. Allogrooming, however, appears to occur more frequently between higher ranking individuals, a shared trait with other primate species. Unlike anthropoid primates, lemur grooming seems to be more intimate and mutual, often directly reciprocated. Anthropoids, on the other hand, use allogrooming to manage agonistic interactions. The ring-tailed lemur is known to be very tactile, spending between 5 and 11% of its time grooming.

===Predator avoidance===

All lemurs experience some predation pressure. Common defenses against predation include the use of alarm calls and predator mobbing, mostly among diurnal lemurs. The leaping abilities of lemurs may have evolved for predator avoidance rather than for travel, according to a study in kinematics. Nocturnal lemurs are difficult to see and track at night and decrease their visibility by foraging alone. They also try to avoid predators by using concealing sleeping locations, such as nests, tree holes, or dense vegetation, Some may also avoid areas frequented by predators by detecting the smell of their feces and alternating between multiple sleeping locations. Even torpor and hibernation states among cheirogaleids may be partly due to high levels of predation. Infants are protected while foraging by either leaving them in the nest or by stashing them in a hidden location, where the infant remains immobile in the absence of the parent.

Diurnal lemurs are visible during the day, so many live in groups, where the increased number of eyes and ears helps aid in predator detection. Diurnal lemurs use and respond to alarm calls, even those of other lemur species and non-predatory birds. The ring-tailed lemur has different calls and reactions to different classes of predators, such as predatory birds, mammals, or snakes. Some lemurs, such as the indri, use crypsis to camouflage themselves. They are often heard but difficult to see in the trees due to the dappled light, earning them the reputation of being &quot;ghosts of the forest&quot;.

===Reproduction===
Except for the aye-aye and the Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, lemurs are seasonal breeders with very short mating and birth seasons influenced by the highly seasonal availability of resources in their environment. Mating season usually last less than three weeks each year, and the female vagina opens up only during a few hours or days of her most receptive time of estrus. These narrow windows for reproduction and resource availability appear to relate to their short gestation periods, rapid maturation, and low basal metabolic rates, as well as the high energy costs of reproduction for females. This may also relate to the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populations—both unusual traits among primates. In both the aye-aye and Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, birth (parturition) occurs over a six-month period.

Lemurs time their mating and birth seasons so that all weaning periods are synchronized to match the time of highest food availability. Weaning occurs either before or shortly after the eruption of the first permanent molars in lemurs. Mouse lemurs are able to fit their entire breeding cycle into the wet season, whereas larger lemurs, such as sifakas, must lactate for two months during the dry season. Infant survival in some species, such as Milne-Edwards&#x27; sifaka, has been shown to be directly impacted by both environmental conditions and the rank, age, and health of the mother. The breeding season is also affected by geographical location. For example, mouse lemurs give birth between September and October in their native habitat in the Southern Hemisphere, but from May through June in the captive settings in the Northern Hemisphere.
Scent factors heavily into lemur reproduction. Scent-marking activity escalates during the mating season. Pheromones may coordinate reproductive timing for females coming into estrus. Mating can be either monogamous or promiscuous for both males and females, and mating can include individuals from outside the group. Monogamous lemurs include the red-bellied lemur (&quot;Eulemur rubriventer&quot;) and the mongoose lemur (&quot;E. mongoz&quot;), although the mongoose lemur has been observed mating outside of its pair bond. Monogamy is most common among nocturnal species, although some exhibit scramble competition, sexual suppression of subordinates, or competitions between males that avoid direct fighting. In mouse lemurs, males utilize sperm plugs, developed enlarged testes during the mating season, and develop size dimorphism (likely due to the enlarged testes). These indicate a mating system known as scramble competition polygyny, where males cannot defend females or the resources that might attract them.

The gestation period varies within lemurs, ranging from 9 weeks in mouse lemurs and 9–10 weeks in dwarf lemurs to 18–24 weeks in other lemurs. The smaller, nocturnal lemurs, such as mouse lemurs, giant mouse lemurs, and dwarf lemurs, usually give birth to more than one infant, whereas the larger, nocturnal lemurs, such as fork-marked lemurs, sportive lemurs, and the aye-aye usually have one offspring. Dwarf and mouse lemurs have up to four offspring, but both average only two. Ruffed lemurs are the only large, diurnal lemurs to consistently give birth to two or three offspring. All other lemurs have single births. Multiple births in lemurs are normally fraternal, and are known to occur in every five to six births in species such as the ring-tailed lemur and some &quot;Eulemur&quot;.

After the offspring are born, lemurs either carry them around or stash them while foraging. When transported, the infants either cling to the mother&#x27;s fur or are carried in the mouth by the scruff. In some species, such as bamboo lemurs, infants are carried by mouth until they are able to cling to their mother&#x27;s fur. Species that park their offspring include nocturnal species (e.g. mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, and dwarf lemurs), bamboo lemurs, and ruffed lemurs. In the case of the ruffed lemurs, the young are altricial and the mothers build nests for them, much like the smaller, nocturnal lemur species. Woolly lemurs are unusual for nocturnal lemurs because they live in cohesive family groups and carry their single offspring with them rather than parking them. Alloparenting (multiple or group parenting) has been reported in all lemur families except the sportive lemurs and aye-aye. Allonursing is also known to occur in several lemur groups. Even males have been observed caring for infants in species such as the red-bellied lemur, mongoose lemur, eastern lesser bamboo lemur, silky sifaka, fat-tailed dwarf lemur, and ruffed lemurs.

Yet another trait that sets most lemurs apart from anthropoid primates is their long lifespan together with their high infant mortality. Many lemurs, including the ring-tailed lemur, have adapted to a highly seasonal environment, which has affected their birthrate, maturation, and twinning rate (r-selection). This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash. In captivity, lemurs can live twice as long as they do in the wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their housing requirements. In 1960, it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years. It is now known that the larger species can live for more than 30 years without showing signs of aging (senescence) and still be capable of reproduction.

===Cognitive abilities and tool use===
Lemurs have traditionally been regarded as being less intelligent than anthropoid primates, with monkeys and apes often described as having more cunning, guile, and deceptiveness. Many lemur species, such as sifakas and the ring-tailed lemur, have scored lower on tests designed for monkeys while performing as well as monkeys on other tests. These comparisons may not be fair since lemurs prefer to manipulate objects with their mouths (rather than their hands) and only take interest in objects when in captivity. Recent studies have shown that lemurs exhibit levels of technical intelligence on par with many other primates, although they manipulate objects less often. Tool use has not been witnessed by lemurs in the wild, although in captivity the common brown lemur and the ring-tailed lemur have been demonstrated to be able to understand and use tools.

A few lemurs have been noted to have relatively large brains. The extinct &quot;Hadropithecus&quot; was as large as a large male baboon and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians. The aye-aye also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate a higher level of intelligence. However, despite having a built-in tool in the form of its thin, elongated middle finger, which it uses to fish for insect grubs, the aye-aye has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools.

==Ecology==

:&quot;See above: Diet, Metabolism, Activity patterns, and Locomotion&quot;
Madagascar not only contains two radically different climatic zones, the rainforests of the east and the dry regions of the west, but also swings from extended drought to cyclone-generated floods. These climatic and geographical challenges, along with poor soils, low plant productivity, wide ranges of ecosystem complexity, and a lack of regularly fruiting trees (such as fig trees) have driven the evolution of lemurs&#x27; immense morphological and behavioral diversity. Their survival has required the ability to endure the persistent extremes, not yearly averages.

Lemurs have either presently or formerly filled the ecological niches normally occupied by monkeys, squirrels, woodpeckers, and grazing ungulates. With the diversity of adaptations for specific ecological niches, habitat selection among lemur families and some genera is often very specific, thus minimizing competition. In nocturnal lemurs from the more seasonal forests in the west, up to five species can coexist during the wet season due to high food abundance. However, to endure the extreme dry season, three of the five species utilize different dietary patterns and their underlying physiological traits to allow them to coexist: fork-marked lemurs feed on tree gum, sportive lemurs feed on leaves, and giant mouse lemurs sometimes feed on insect secretions. The other two species, the gray mouse lemur and the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (&quot;Cheirogaleus medius&quot;), avoid competition through reduced activity. The gray mouse lemur uses bouts of torpor, while the fat-tailed dwarf lemur hibernates completely. Similarly, on the east coast entire genera focus on specific food to avoid too much niche overlap. True lemurs and ruffed lemurs are frugivorous, indriids are folivorous, and bamboo lemurs specialize in bamboo and other grasses. Once again, seasonal dietary differences as well as subtle differences in substrate preferences, forest strata used, activity cycle, and social organization enable lemur species to coexist, although this time the species are more closely related and have similar niches. A classic example involves resource partitioning between three species of bamboo lemur that live in close proximity in small forested areas: the golden bamboo lemur, the greater bamboo lemur, and the eastern lesser bamboo lemur (&quot;Hapalemur griseus&quot;). Each utilizes either different species of bamboo, different parts of the plant, or different layers in the forest. Nutrient and toxin content (such as cyanide) help regulate food selection, though seasonal food preferences are also known to play a role.

Dietary regimes of lemurs include folivory, frugivory, and omnivory, with some being highly adaptable while others specialize on foods such as plant exudates (tree gum) and bamboo. In some cases, lemur feeding patterns directly benefit the native plant life. When lemurs exploit nectar, they may act as pollinators as long as the functional parts of the flower are not damaged. In fact, several unrelated Malagasy flowering plants demonstrate lemur-specific pollination traits, and studies indicate that some diurnal species, such as the red-bellied lemur and the ruffed lemurs, act as major pollinators. Two examples of plant species that rely on lemurs for pollination include traveller&#x27;s palm (&quot;Ravenala madagascariensis&quot;) and a species of legume-like liana, &quot;Strongylodon cravieniae&quot;. Seed dispersal is another service lemurs provide. After passing through the lemur gut, tree and vine seeds exhibit lower mortality and germinate faster. Latrine behavior exhibited by some lemurs may help improve soil quality and facilitate seed dispersal. Because of their importance in maintaining a healthy forest, frugivorous lemurs may qualify as keystone mutualists.

All lemurs, particularly the smaller species, are affected by predation and they are important prey items for predators. Humans are the most significant predator of diurnal lemurs, despite taboos that occasionally forbid the hunting and eating of certain lemur species. Other predators include native euplerids, such as the fossa, feral cats, domestic dogs, snakes, diurnal birds of prey, and crocodiles. Extinct giant eagles, including one or two species from the genus &quot;Aquila&quot; and the giant Malagasy crowned eagle (&quot;Stephanoaetus mahery&quot;), as well as the giant fossa (&quot;Cryptoprocta spelea&quot;), previously also preyed on lemurs, perhaps including the giant subfossil lemurs or their subadult offspring. The existence of these extinct giants suggests that predator-prey interactions involving lemurs were more complex than they are today. Today, predator size restricts owls to the smaller lemurs, usually 100 g (3.5 oz) or less, while the larger lemurs fall victim to the larger diurnal birds of prey, such as the Madagascar harrier-hawk (&quot;Polyboroides radiatus&quot;) and the Madagascar buzzard (&quot;Buteo brachypterus&quot;).

==Research==

Similarities that lemurs share with anthropoid primates, such as diet and social organization, along with their own unique traits, have made lemurs the most heavily studied of all mammal groups on Madagascar. Research often focuses on the link between ecology and social organization, but also on their behavior and morphophysiology (the study of anatomy in relation to function). Studies of their life-history traits, behavior and ecology help understanding of primate evolution, since they are thought to share similarities with ancestral primates.

Lemurs have been the focus of monographic series, action plans, field guides, and classic works in ethology. However, few species have been thoroughly studied to date, and most research has been preliminary and restricted to a single locality. Only recently have numerous scientific papers been published to explain the basic aspects of behavior and ecology of poorly known species. Field studies have given insights on population dynamics and evolutionary ecology of most genera and many species. Long-term research focused on identified individuals is in its infancy and has only been started for a few populations. However, learning opportunities are dwindling as habitat destruction and other factors threaten the existence of lemur populations across the island.
Lemurs are mentioned in sailors&#x27; voyage logs as far back as 1608 and in 1658 that at least seven lemur species were described in detail by the French merchant, Étienne de Flacourt, who may also have been the only westerner to see and chronicle the existence of a giant (now extinct) lemur, which he called the &quot;tretretretre&quot;. Around 1703 merchants and sailors began bringing lemurs back to Europe, at which time James Petiver, an apothecary in London, described and illustrated the mongoose lemur. Starting in 1751, the London illustrator George Edwards began describing and illustrating some lemur species, of which a few were included in various editions of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; by Carl Linnaeus. In the 1760s and 1770s, French naturalists Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon and Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton began describing the anatomy of several lemur species. The first traveling naturalist to comment on lemurs was Philibert Commerçon in 1771, although it was Pierre Sonnerat who recorded a greater variety of lemur species during his travels.

During the 19th century, there was an explosion of new lemur descriptions and names, which later took decades to sort out. During this time, professional collectors gathered specimens for museums, menageries, and cabinets. Some of the major collectors were Johann Maria Hildebrandt and Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major. From these collections, as well as increasing observations of lemurs in their natural habitats, museum systematists including Albert Günther and John Edward Gray continued to contribute new names for new lemur species. However, the most notable contributions from this century includes the work of Alfred Grandidier, a naturalist and explorer who devoted himself to the study of Madagascar&#x27;s natural history and local people. With the help of Alphonse Milne-Edwards, most of the diurnal lemurs were illustrated at this time. However, lemur taxonomic nomenclature took its modern form in the 1920s and 1930s, being standardized by Ernst Schwarz in 1931.

Although lemur taxonomy had developed, it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that the in-situ (or on-site) study of lemur behavior and ecology began to blossom. Jean-Jacques Petter and Arlette Petter-Rousseaux toured Madagascar in 1956 and 1957, surveying many of its lemur species and making important observations about their social groupings and reproduction. In 1960, the year of Madagascar&#x27;s independence, David Attenborough introduced lemurs to the West with a commercial film. Under the guidance of John Buettner-Janusch, who founded the Duke Lemur Center in 1966, Alison Jolly traveled to Madagascar in 1962 to study the diet and social behavior of the ring-tailed lemur and Verreaux&#x27;s sifaka at Berenty Private Reserve. The Petters and Jolly spawned a new era of interest in lemur ecology and behavior and were shortly followed by anthropologists such as Alison Richard, Robert Sussman, Ian Tattersall, and many others. Following the political turmoil of the mid-1970s and Madagascar&#x27;s revolution, field studies resumed in the 1980s, thanks in part to the renewed involvement of the Duke Lemur Center under the direction of Elwyn L. Simons and the conservation efforts of Patricia Wright. In the decades that followed, huge strides have been made in lemur studies and many new species have been discovered.

Ex situ research (or off-site research) is also popular among researchers looking to answer questions that are difficult to test in the field. For example, efforts to sequence the genome of the gray mouse lemur will help researchers understand which genetic traits set primates apart from other mammals and will ultimately help understand what genomic traits set humans apart from other primates. One of the foremost lemur research facilities is the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina. It maintains the largest captive lemur population outside of Madagascar, which it maintains for non-invasive research and captive breeding. Many important research projects have been carried out there, including studies of lemur vocalizations, basic locomotor research, the kinematics of bipedalism, the effects of social complexity transitive reasoning, and cognition studies involving a lemur&#x27;s ability to organize and retrieve sequences from memory. Other facilities, such as the Lemur Conservation Foundation, located near Myakka City, Florida, have also hosted research projects, such as one that looked at lemurs&#x27; ability to preferentially select tools based on functional qualities.

==Conservation==
Lemurs are threatened by a host of environmental problems, including deforestation, hunting for bushmeat, live capture for the exotic pet trade, and climate change. All species are listed by CITES on Appendix I, which prohibits trade of specimens or parts, except for scientific purposes. As of 2005, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listed 16% of all lemur species as critically endangered, 23% as endangered, 25% as vulnerable, 28% as &quot;data deficient&quot;, and only 8% as least concern. Over the next five years, at least 28 species were newly identified, none of which have had their conservation status assessed. Many are likely to be considered threatened since the new lemur species that have been described recently are typically confined to small regions. Given the rate of continued habitat destruction, undiscovered species could go extinct before being identified. Since the arrival of humans on the island approximately 2000 years ago, all endemic Malagasy vertebrates over 10 kg (22 lb) have disappeared, including 17 species, 8 genera, and 3 families of lemurs. The IUCN Species Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC), the International Primatological Society (IPS), and Conservation International (CI) have included as many as five lemurs in their biennial &quot;Top 25 Most Endangered Primates&quot;. The 2008–2010 list includes the greater bamboo lemur, gray-headed lemur (&quot;Eulemur cinereiceps&quot;), blue-eyed black lemur (&quot;Eulemur flavifrons&quot;), northern sportive lemur (&quot;Lepilemur septentrionalis&quot;), and silky sifaka. In 2012, an assessment by the Primate Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) concluded that 90% of the then 103 described species of lemur should be listed as threatened on the IUCN Red List, making lemurs the most endangered group of mammals. The IUCN reiterated its concern in 2013, noting that 90% of all lemur species could be extinct within 20 to 25 years unless a US$7 million 3-year conservation plan aimed at helping local communities can be implemented.

Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a high population growth rate of 2.5% per year and nearly 70% of the population living in poverty. The country is also burdened with high levels of debt and limited resources. These socioeconomic issues have complicated conservation efforts, even though the island of Madagascar has been recognized by IUCN/SSC as a critical primate region for over 20 years. Due to its relatively small land area—587,045 km2 (226,659 sq mi)—compared to other high-priority biodiversity regions and its high levels of endemism, the country is considered one of the world&#x27;s most important biodiversity hotspots, with lemur conservation being a high priority. Despite the added emphasis for conservation, there is no indication that the extinctions that began with the arrival of humans have come to an end.

===Threats in the wild===
The greatest concern facing lemur populations is habitat destruction and degradation. Deforestation takes the form of local subsistence use, such as slash and burn agriculture (referred to as &quot;tavy&quot; in Malagasy), the creation of pasture for cattle through burning, and legal and illegal gathering of wood for firewood or charcoal production; commercial mining; and the illegal logging of precious hardwoods for foreign markets. After centuries of unsustainable use, as well as rapidly escalating forest destruction since 1950, less than 60,000 km2 (23,000 sq mi) or 10% of Madagascar&#x27;s land area remains forested. Only 17,000 km2 (6,600 sq mi) or 3% of the island&#x27;s land area is protected and due to dire economic conditions and political instability, most of the protected areas are ineffectively managed and defended. Some protected areas were set aside because they were naturally protected by their remote, isolated location, often on steep cliffs. Other areas, such as the dry forests and spiny forests of the west and south, receive little protection and are in serious danger of being destroyed.

Some species may be in risk of extinction even without complete deforestation, such as ruffed lemurs, which are very sensitive to habitat disturbance. If large fruit trees are removed, the forest may sustain fewer individuals of a species and their reproductive success may be affected for years. Small populations may be able to persist in isolated forest fragments for 20 to 40 years due to long generation times, but in the long term, such populations may not be viable. Small, isolated populations also risk extirpation by natural disasters and disease outbreaks (epizootics). Two diseases that are lethal to lemurs and could severely impact isolated lemur populations are toxoplasmosis, which is spread by feral cats, and the herpes simplex virus carried by humans.

Climate change and weather-related natural disasters also threaten lemur survival. For the last 1000 years, western and highland regions have been growing significantly drier, but in the past few decades, severe drought has become much more frequent. There are indications that deforestation and forest fragmentation are accelerating this gradual desiccation. The effects of drought are even felt in the rainforests. As annual rainfall decreases, the larger trees that make up the high canopy suffer increased mortality, failure to fruit, and decreased production of new leaves, which folivorous lemurs prefer. Cyclones can defoliate an area, knock down canopy trees, and create landslides and flooding. This can leave lemur populations without fruit or leaves until the following spring, requiring them to subsist on crisis foods, such as epiphytes.

Lemurs are hunted for food by the local Malagasy, either for local subsistence or to supply a luxury meat market in the larger cities. Most rural Malagasy do not understand what &quot;endangered&quot; means, nor do they know that hunting lemurs is illegal or that lemurs are found only in Madagascar. Many Malagasy have taboo, or &quot;fady&quot;, about hunting and eating lemurs, but this does not prevent hunting in many regions. Even though hunting has been a threat to lemur populations in the past, it has recently become a more serious threat as socioeconomic conditions deteriorate. Economic hardships have caused people to move around the country in search of employment, leading local traditions to break down. Drought and famine can also relax the &quot;fady&quot; that protect lemurs. Larger species, such as sifakas and ruffed lemurs, are common targets, but smaller species are also hunted or accidentally caught in snares intended for larger prey. Experienced, organized hunting parties using firearms, slings and blowguns can kill as many as eight to twenty lemurs in one trip. Organized hunting parties and lemur traps can be found in both non-protected areas and remote corners of protected areas. National parks and other protected areas are not adequately protected by law enforcement agencies. Often, there are too few park rangers to cover a large area, and sometimes terrain within the park is too rugged to check regularly.

Although not as significant as deforestation and hunting, some lemurs, such as crowned lemurs and other species that have successfully been kept in captivity, are occasionally kept as exotic pets by Malagasy people. Bamboo lemurs are also kept as pets, although they only survive for up to two months. Live capture for the exotic pet trade in wealthier countries is not normally considered a threat due to strict regulations controlling their export.

===Conservation efforts===
Lemurs have drawn much attention to Madagascar and its endangered species. In this capacity, they act as flagship species, the most notable of which is the ring-tailed lemur, which is considered an icon of the country. The presence of lemurs in national parks helps drive ecotourism, which especially helps local communities living in the vicinity of the national parks, since it offers employment opportunities and the community receives half of the park entrance fees. In the case of Ranomafana National Park, job opportunities and other revenue from long-term research can rival that of ecotourism.

Starting in 1927, the Malagasy government has declared all lemurs as &quot;protected&quot; by establishing protected areas that are now classified under three categories: National Parks (Parcs Nationaux), Strict Nature Reserves (Réserves Naturelles Intégrales), and Special Reserves (Réserves Spéciales). There are currently 18 national parks, 5 strict nature reserves, and 22 special reserves, as well as several other small private reserves, such as Berenty Reserve and Sainte Luce Private Reserve, both near Fort Dauphin. All protected areas, excluding the private reserves, comprise approximately 3% of the land surface of Madagascar and are managed by Madagascar National Parks, formerly known as l&#x27;Association Nationale pour la Gestion des Aires Protégées (ANGAP), as well as other non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including Conservation International (CI), the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Most lemur species are covered by this network of protected areas, and a few species can be found in multiple parks or reserves.

Conservation is also facilitated by the Madagascar Fauna Group (MFG), an association of nearly 40 zoos and related organizations, including the Duke Lemur Center, the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, and the Saint Louis Zoological Park. This international NGO supports Madagascar&#x27;s Parc Ivoloina, helps protect Betampona Reserve and other protected areas, and promotes field research, breeding programs, conservation planning, and education in zoos. One of their major projects involved the release of captive black-and-white ruffed lemurs, designed to help restock the dwindling population within Betampona Reserve.

Habitat corridors are needed for linking these protected areas so that small populations are not isolated. In in Durban, South Africa, Madagascar&#x27;s former president Marc Ravalomanana promised to triple the size of the island&#x27;s protected areas in five years. This became known as the &quot;Durban Vision&quot;. In June 2007, the World Heritage Committee included a sizable portion of Madagascar&#x27;s eastern rainforests as a new UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Debt relief may help Madagascar protect its biodiversity. 

Captive lemur populations are maintained locally and outside of Madagascar in varied zoological conservatories and research centers, although the diversity of species is limited. Sikafas, for instance, do not survive well in captivity, so few facilities have them. The largest captive lemur population can be found at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in North Carolina, whose mission includes non-invasive research, conservation (e.g. captive breeding), and public education. Another large lemur colony is located in the Myakka City Lemur Reserve in Florida, run by the Lemur Conservation Foundation (LCF), which also hosts lemur research. In Madagascar, Lemurs&#x27; Park is a free-range, private facility southwest of Antananarivo that exhibits lemurs for the public while also rehabilitating captive-born lemurs for reintroduction into the wild.
==In Malagasy culture==
In Malagasy culture, lemurs, and animals in general, have souls (&quot;ambiroa&quot;) which can get revenge if mocked while alive or if killed in a cruel fashion. Because of this, lemurs, like many other elements of daily life, have been a source of taboos, known locally as &quot;fady&quot;, which can be based around stories with four basic principles. A village or region may believe that a certain type of lemur may be the ancestor of the clan. They may also believe that a lemur&#x27;s spirit may get revenge. Alternatively, the animal may appear as a benefactor. Lemurs are also thought to impart their qualities, good or bad, onto human babies. In general, &quot;fady&quot; extend beyond a sense of the forbidden, but can include events that bring bad luck.

One example of lemur &quot;fady&quot; told around 1970 comes from Ambatofinandrahana in the Fianarantsoa Province. According to the account, a man brought a lemur home in a trap, but alive. His children wanted to keep the lemur as a pet, but when the father told them it was not a domestic animal, the children asked to kill it. After the children tortured the lemur, it eventually died and was eaten. A short time later, all the children died of illness. As a result, the father declared that anyone who tortures lemurs for fun shall &quot;be destroyed and have no descendants.&quot;

&quot;Fady&quot; can not only help protect lemurs and their forests under stable socioeconomic situations, but they can also lead to discrimination and persecution if a lemur is known to bring bad fortune, for instance, if it walks through town. In other ways, &quot;fady&quot; does not protect all lemurs equally. For example, although the hunting and eating of certain species may be taboo, other species may not share that same protection and are therefore targeted instead. &quot;Fady&quot; can vary from village to village within the same region. If people move to a new village or region, their &quot;fady&quot; may not apply to the lemur species that are locally present, making them available for consumption. &quot;Fady&quot; restrictions on lemur meat can be relaxed in times of famine and drought.

The aye-aye is almost universally viewed unfavorably across Madagascar, though the tales vary from village to village and region to region. If people see an aye-aye, they may kill it and hang the corpse on a pole near a road outside of town (so others can carry the bad fortunes away) or burn their village and move. The superstitions behind aye-aye &quot;fady&quot; include beliefs that they kill and eat chickens or people, that they kill people in their sleep by cutting their aortic vein, that they embody ancestral spirits, or that they warn of illness, death, or bad luck in the family. As of 1970, the people of the Marolambo District in the Toamasina Province feared the aye-aye because they believed it had supernatural powers. Because of this, no one was allowed to mock, kill, or eat one.

There are also widespread &quot;fady&quot; about indri and sifakas. They are often protected from hunting and consumption because of their resemblance to humans and their ancestors, mostly due to their large size and upright or orthograde posture. The resemblance is even stronger for indri, which lack the long tail of most living lemurs. Known locally as &quot;babakoto&quot; (&quot;Ancestor of Man&quot;), the indri is sometimes seen as the progenitor of the family or clan. There are also stories of an indri that helped a human down from a tree, so they are seen as benefactors. Other lemur &quot;fady&quot; include the belief that a wife will have ugly children if her husband kills a woolly lemur, or that if a pregnant woman eats a dwarf lemur, her baby will get its beautiful, round eyes.

== In popular culture ==
Lemurs have also become popular in Western culture in recent years. The DreamWorks Animation franchise &quot;Madagascar&quot; features the characters King Julien, Maurice and Mort and was seen by an estimated 100 million people in theaters and 200–300 million people on DVD worldwide. Prior to this film, &quot;Zoboomafoo&quot;, a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) children&#x27;s television series from 1999 to 2001, helped to popularize sifakas by featuring a live Coquerel&#x27;s sifaka from the Duke Lemur Center as well as a puppet. A twenty-episode series called &quot;Lemur Kingdom&quot; (in the United States) or &quot;Lemur Street&quot; (in the United Kingdom and Canada) aired in 2008 on Animal Planet. It combined the typical animal documentary with dramatic narration to tell the story of two groups of ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve.
