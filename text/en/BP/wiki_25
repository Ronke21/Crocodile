<text>Pierson&#x27;s Puppeteers, often known just as Puppeteers, are a fictional alien race from American author Larry Niven&#x27;s &quot;Known Space&quot; books. The race first appeared in Niven’s novella &quot;Neutron Star&quot;.

== Biology and sociology ==
The sobriquet &quot;Pierson&#x27;s&quot; comes from the name of the human who made first contact in the early 26th century in the &quot;Known Space&quot; timeline. According to the Niven story &quot;The Soft Weapon&quot;, Pierson was a crewman aboard a spaceship at a time when there was a camp revival of the ancient &quot;Time for Beany&quot; TV show featuring Cecil the Seasick Sea Serpent, an animated character based on a hand puppet; Pierson accordingly described the alien he had met as a Puppeteer, given some resemblance of the head and neck with Cecil. Puppeteers dealing with humans usually give themselves the names of centaurs and other figures in Greek mythology, such as Nessus, Nike and Chiron. Puppeteers&#x27; names for themselves are reportedly highly complex, and unpronounceable by humans. The group name they use for their own species translates as &quot;Citizens&quot;.

Pierson&#x27;s Puppeteers are described by Niven as having two forelegs and a single hindleg ending in hoofed feet, and two snake-like heads instead of a humanoid upper body. The heads are small, containing a forked tongue, rubbery lips rimmed with finger-like knobs, and a single eye per head. The Puppeteer brain is housed not in the heads, but in the &quot;thoracic&quot; cavity well protected beneath the mane-covered hump from which the heads emerge. They use the &quot;mouths&quot; to manipulate objects, as a humanoid uses hands. 

The Puppeteer&#x27;s native language sounds like highly complex orchestral music, but they seem to be able to reproduce human language without difficulty or device, as well as the Heroes&#x27; Tongue (Kzinti), suggesting their vocal arrangement may resemble a pair of avian-like syrinxes rather than vocal cords. 

Biologically, Puppeteers are highly intelligent herbivores; a herd animal, Puppeteers prefer the company (and smell) of their own kind. Their cycle of reproduction is similar to that of Earth&#x27;s digger wasps: the Puppeteers consider themselves to have three genders (two male, one female): the two &quot;male&quot; genders are the equivalent of human female and male (one has an ovipositor, the other produces sperm) and the &quot;female&quot; is a (non-sentient) parasitized host into which the ovum and spermatozoon are deposited. 

Puppeteers are very long-lived. The exact length of a Puppeteer&#x27;s lifespan is unknown, but it is at least several centuries—Nessus, the most prominent individual Puppeteer in the works, is over 300 years old during the events of the original &quot;Ringworld&quot; novel. This, together with a total lack of contraceptives (except major surgery) for their species along with an unwillingness to use them, is responsible for extreme crowding: the Puppeteer homeworld has a population of over a trillion, and four farming worlds are dedicated entirely to supplying the population with food. Even then, grown food is a luxury reserved for only the highest-ranking, with synthesizers feeding the vast majority. While contraception is forbidden, access to &#x27;brides&#x27; (the parasitized breeding host, the third &#x27;sex&#x27;) is strictly controlled. Puppeteers also have access to highly advanced medical technology that may be a factor in their longevity.

Technologically, the Puppeteers are very advanced, centuries or millennia ahead of most other species (including humans). For example, humans in Niven&#x27;s universe invented (actually purchased from the Puppeteers) a method of cheap teleportation in the twenty-fifth century called a transfer booth, which requires an enclosed space at either end of the transmission. Puppeteers use a much more elegant and sophisticated booth-less &quot;open&quot; version in the form of stepping disks, which require no enclosure. They transformed their home world, and several other astronomical bodies, into a Klemperer rosette, in order to flee a galactic catastrophe.

Puppeteers appear to lack generalized empathy towards other intelligent species and display almost textbook sociopathic tendencies: they are highly manipulative, appearing to feel no psychological distress when their actions cause harm to others, they perform interstellar-scale manipulation of other species, inducing and directing large scale wars in order to achieve the goal of their own safety and they do not appear to be disturbed when required to make choices that result in the deaths of billions or trillions. From what little interaction is shown between Puppeteers, it seems their lack of empathy extends to their own species. Mate selection seems to be largely status-based, with higher status mates being more desirable. The Puppeteer Nessus finds comfort in having his living space produce simulated proximity to his species: the smells, sounds, and sights of other Puppeteers. However, he appears to have little need or desire for social interaction with others of his kind.

Socially, two notable traits of Puppeteers are their racial/cultural penchant for cowardice and their tendency to congregate in herds. The cowardice is thought in Puppeteer society to originate with the Puppeteer instinct for turning one&#x27;s back on danger. However, the trait is thought by many to actually originate from their herd instinct, as the instinct to turn one&#x27;s back is linked to an instinct to kick the hind hoof at an attacker. In &quot;Ringworld&quot;, when Nessus and the expeditionaries are threatened, the Puppeteer defends himself quite effectively:

All in one motion, the puppeteer had spun on his forelegs and lashed out with his single hind leg. His heads were turned backwards and spread wide, Louis remembered, to triangulate on his target. Nessus had accurately kicked a man&#x27;s heart out through his splintered spine. (&quot;Ringworld&quot;, Chapter 13, published 1970.)

Another behavioral trait is the coma state, broadly a cognate of the human fetal position–in the same way that ostriches are said to bury their heads in the sand, Puppeteers fold up into a ball, tucking their three legs and two heads underneath the padded cranial bulge. This is, in part, an explosion reflex, learned during childhood. Their cowardice is also reflected in their architecture and object design, as all the Puppeteer-designed rooms and vessels have no sharp edges, everything curves into everything else, giving a &quot;half-melted&quot; look and meaning that objects are less likely to damage someone inadvertently, through their own carelessness.

In &quot;Ringworld&quot;, Nessus, a Puppeteer, explains how his race&#x27;s cowardice is partly a result of a science experiment (the details of which are not given) that proves the Puppeteers have nothing equivalent to an immortal soul, and therefore death is, for their species, eternal oblivion. As a result, the Puppeteer race is fanatically devoted to its own safety. It is worth noting that this explanation is a form of diplomatic, post hoc rationalizing, as their cowardice is a biologically ingrained trait and not actually a rational choice. It is diplomatic, in that it validates in other species what Puppeteers consider to be irrationally insane bravery, although it is doubtful that the Puppeteers genuinely accept other species&#x27; claims to having souls.

A courageous Puppeteer is regarded as insane by his species, and actually shows symptoms associated with human mental illness, such as bipolar disorder, clinical depression and so on. However, aside from the crew of the &quot;Explorer&quot; (in the novel &quot;Fleet of Worlds&quot;), no human has ever met a completely sane Puppeteer, as no sane Puppeteer would ever leave the safety of the Fleet of Worlds (see below). 

On occasion a Puppeteer will express its amusement by facing its two heads towards each other, in effect, looking at itself. This is described by Niven to be the closest to laughter a Puppeteer comes.

== Politics and relations with other species ==
Politically, the Puppeteers have a form of democracy with two major parties: the Conservatives and the Experimentalists. The Conservatives have held power for a majority of Puppeteer history; Experimentalist regimes only take power when a crisis threatens the safety of the Puppeteer race, and action is considered less dangerous than inaction.

The leader of the Puppeteers is known as the Hindmost. Since Pierson&#x27;s Puppeteers are foremost concerned with their own safety and the survival of their species, the most important Puppeteer is considered to be behind, or protected by, every other member of the species. It is a shortening from the more literal &quot;the one who leads from behind&quot;. A maddened, deposed Hindmost is responsible for Louis Wu&#x27;s return to the Ringworld in the book &quot;The Ringworld Engineers&quot;.

=== General Products ===
The Puppeteers&#x27; renown for honesty in trading allowed the species to accumulate an expansive mercantile empire called General Products; since the human Bronze Age, the Puppeteers have ruled this empire including every race in the 60-LY sphere of Known Space. One of the most important items sold by General Products is the General Products Hull for spaceships. Such a hull is completely impervious to everything except antimatter (which is not highly advertised but covered by a company warranty); the hull is transparent to visible light which can be alleviated by polarization or complete opacity; tidal forces and extreme gravitational force will not affect the hull but can kill the occupants, unless nullified by variable cabin gravity. The hulls are advertised as being capable of flying through the upper atmosphere of a star unscathed, although the contents will be cooked; as a protection against this particular contingency, the Puppeteers also provide a stasis field.

Exposure to antimatter is the only known method for destroying a General Products hull until the 2007 novel &quot;Fleet of Worlds&quot;. In the story &quot;Flatlander&quot;, a GP Hull is exposed to a constant stream of diffuse antimatter during a visit to a star system with some exotic qualities. Whereas a conventional hull made of metal, for example, would simply have ablated under these conditions, the General Products hull instead simply unravelled. This was due to the fact that a GP Hull essentially consisted of a single incredibly large, highly complex molecule. Once a sufficient number of the atoms which constituted the molecule were annihilated by the antimatter, the molecule could not remain stable, and thus degenerated into a selection of less complex compounds and elements, effectively causing the hull to vanish in an instant. Fortunately, the vessel&#x27;s pilot was sufficiently cautious to be wearing a vacuum suit at the time, and survived, as did the owner of the ship.

In &quot;Fleet of Worlds&quot;, the characters tour a General Product factory and ask innocent-seeming questions of their tour guide, Baedeker. Baedeker reveals (apparently unintentionally) that the manufacturing process is extremely sensitive to gravity and impurities, that the hulls are constructed from a single super-molecule using nanotech, and their strength is reinforced by an embedded power plant that reinforces the inter-atomic bonds. These facts provide the clues that allow them to later destroy a GP Hull from the inside and survive.

In &quot;Destroyer of Worlds&quot;, a captured Pak Protector analyzes the hull, deducing that it comprises a dynamically reinforced molecular structure and how to siphon energy from the structure.

=== Foreign policy ===
The general foreign policy of Puppeteers consists of attempts to control the universe around them to ensure their own safety. As Puppeteers try to expose themselves to as little risk as possible, they use other beings as agents whenever possible, utilizing a combination of bribes and blackmail to obtain cooperation. Blackmail is not immoral to Puppeteers, and they have an established code of conduct surrounding the practice, making it perfectly safe for both the blackmailer and the victim, including that the blackmailer must turn over all their evidence against the victim and submit to a partial memory wipe, so they cannot betray the blackmail deal. The Puppeteers also use more personal manipulation; for instance, Puppeteers who have dealt with human males have utilized a voice that sounds like that of a seductive human female, and the Puppeteer Nessus utilized an implanted tasp, a device which could stimulate the pleasure center of the brain, thus allowing him to subliminally condition those he dealt with.

In &quot;Ringworld&quot;, it is revealed that the Puppeteer government meddled in human and Kzinti gene pools. They started a series of wars (the Man–Kzin Wars) between the warlike Kzinti and humans, and guaranteed that the Kzinti lose each time, not least by using a starseed lure to guide an Outsider ship into human space, introducing faster-than-light travel to humanity. This was a mechanism to cause rapid Kzinti evolution, since the most aggressive Kzinti would die in battle, leaving the more docile individuals to breed, eventually reducing their racial instinct for aggression.

Another Puppeteer breeding experiment was the &quot;Lucky Human Project&quot;. The Puppeteer government concluded that humans&#x27; most notable quality was luck and decided to strengthen this trait. Manipulating politics on Earth, the Puppeteers caused &#x27;Birth Lotteries&#x27; on Earth around 2650, granting the winners the right to have extra offspring (strict limits were placed on most people to avoid overcrowding). Teela Brown, who journeys to the Ringworld with Louis Wu, is a descendant of multiple generations of lottery winners. Her luck is highly selective, bending probability so that the outcome most beneficial to her or her descendants comes to pass, without regard to its effects on those around her, contrary to the interests of the rest of the Ringworld expedition on more than one occasion.

The Puppeteers also influenced species on the Ringworld. After discovering the Ringworld, the Puppeteers sent probes with fungi on board that destroys room-temperature superconductors, in an attempt to gain a tactical advantage over the Ringworld. These fungi cause all superconductors (with the exception of those buried in Scrith) to rust into powder. The lack of a suitable alternative superconductor causes the fall of advanced civilizations throughout the Ringworld.

== Homeworld—The Fleet of Worlds ==
The Fleet of Worlds is the home planets of the Pierson&#x27;s Puppeteer race. They consist of the native homeworld, called &quot;Hearth&quot;, and its five agricultural worlds, arranged in a &#x27;Kemplerer rosette&#x27; (likely a misspelling of a Klemperer rosette) being moved in synchronicity with each other. The number of worlds has varied; at maximum (at the opening of the novel &quot;Fleet of Worlds&quot;) the Fleet comprised six worlds. By two Earth centuries later, in Niven&#x27;s novel &quot;Ringworld&quot;, the Fleet contains five worlds. 

The Puppeteers first moved their worlds into this formation when their home star turned into a red giant, using an inertialess, reactionless drive purchased at great price from the Outsiders. After the discovery that the core of the galaxy is exploding, the Puppeteers turned the fleet towards the Magellanic Clouds, gradually reaching a speed of 80% lightspeed. Although the Puppeteers have Faster-than-light technology they prefer to travel at safer, sub-light speeds.

For centuries, the location of the Puppeteer homeworld was a great mystery. No entity in Known Space outside the Puppeteer race was aware of the location, despite extensive surveys, with the probable exception of Jinx-born pirate Captain Kidd. In the short story &quot;A Relic of the Empire&quot;, he discovered the Puppeteer home system by accident, and returned in the ship &quot;Puppet Master&quot; to rob inbound Puppeteer vessels, rather than pursuing a formal blackmail arrangement. Kidd claimed the Puppeteers&#x27; home planet orbited a &quot;red giant, undersized&quot; star (known as &quot;Giver Of Life&quot;), in the vicinity of coordinates 23.6, 70.1, 6.0 (using an unnamed coordinate system). Before dying, he passed this location along to Richard Shultz-Mann, of the planet Wunderland.

Puppeteers were willing to pay large sums of hush money in order to suppress even trivial details about their homeworld. In 2641 AD, it was discovered that the Puppeteers&#x27; homeworld had no moon, information deduced as a result of the solving of the mystery of the deaths of a crew of a ship investigating a neutron star. The ship, based on a General Products hull, was impervious to tidal forces but the crew were not. Because the Puppeteers seemingly have no experience of tides, they were unable to anticipate the deadly tidal forces. (As told in Niven&#x27;s short story, &quot;Neutron Star&quot;.) &quot;Crashlander&quot; reveals that the Puppeteers may have feigned their ignorance of tidal forces.

The Puppeteers had to make some drastic alterations to their home system, during their history, as waste heat due to overindustrialisation was rapidly making their planet uninhabitable. They moved their home planet further from their sun, to lessen the effects of global warming, but overindustrialisation forced them to move five other planets closer to their world and terraform them into &quot;farming worlds&quot;, arranging all the planets into a &#x27;Kemplerer rosette&#x27;. (Before Ringworld opens, one of the worlds has left the formation, as part of the central conflict in Niven and Edward M. Lerner&#x27;s &quot;Fleet of Worlds&quot;.)

Nessus explains some of this background to Louis Wu and the crew of the &quot;Long Shot&quot; thus:
&quot;I had explained,&quot; said Nessus, &quot;that our civilization was dying in its own waste heat. Total conversion of energy had rid us of all waste products of civilization, save that one. We had no choice but to move our world outward from its primary.&quot;

&quot;Was that not dangerous?&quot;

&quot;Very. There was much madness that year. For that reason it is famous in our history. But we had purchased a reactionless, inertialess drive from the Outsiders. You may have guessed their price. We are still paying in installments. We had moved two agricultural worlds; we had experimented with other, useless worlds of our system using the Outsider drive. In any case, we did it. We moved our world.

&quot;In short, we found that a sun was a liability rather than an asset. We moved our world to a tenth of a light year&#x27;s distance, keeping the primary only as an anchor. We needed the farming worlds and it would have been dangerous to let our world wander randomly through space. Otherwise we would not have needed a sun at all.

&quot;We had brought suitable worlds from nearby systems, increasing our agricultural worlds to four, and setting them in a Kemplerer Rosette.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
:—&quot;Ringworld&quot;, Chapter 5, published 1970
Eventually, their sun converted from a yellow dwarf to a red giant, so the Puppeteers moved the &quot;Fleet of Worlds&quot;, the five planets, to their system&#x27;s Oort cloud. This is one of the reasons the Puppeteers were so successful at keeping the location of their homeworld a secret—explorers would be looking for a yellow dwarf (as one could surmise that Puppeteers had evolved around a yellow dwarf from their biology and that they were comfortable on Earth-like planets without pressure suits) when their planet(s) were actually near a red giant.

In the short story &quot;At the Core&quot;, Beowulf Shaeffer, who made the discovery about tidal forces five years previously, in &quot;Neutron Star&quot;, discovers that the Galactic Core is exploding. This news prompts the Puppeteer Exodus, where the Fleet of Worlds flees the galaxy at just under light speed for the Magellanic Clouds, in the hope that by the time the explosion reaches the Fleet of Worlds, the Puppeteers will have found a way to protect their civilization. This exodus prompts a major stock market crash in human society. In 2864, the Fleet of Worlds leaves Known Space.

Beowulf notes, however, that the speed at which the Fleet of Worlds is moving (0.8c) would cause nearly as much damage as the Core explosion itself. This suggests radiation may not be the primary danger the Puppeteers flee, also that Puppeteers may, in fact, have a means to deal with radiation affecting entire worlds. In &quot;Crashlander&quot; it is speculated that the Puppeteers are planning on moving to the now-uninhabited Core, isolated from potentially dangerous species - which would have either fled the galaxy entirely or been destroyed. Their initial path is revealed to be out of the plane of the galaxy, but no mention is made of Louis Wu noticing trajectory when flying there on the &quot;Long Shot&quot; in &quot;Ringworld&quot;.

<text>The Samara () is a river in Russia and a left-bank tributary of the Volga. It flows into the Volga at the city of Samara. Its largest tributary is the Bolshoy Kinel. It is long, and its drainage basin covers .

==Honours==
The asteroid 26922 Samara was named on 1 June 2007 to honour the river, which has also given the city of Samara its name.

&quot;Samarabatrachus&quot;, a temnospondyl from the Lower Triassic (Induan) deposits of Borsky District, Samara Oblast, was named after this river in 2016. This animal is known by a skull of 15.3 cm in length.

<doc id="471029" wikidata="Q494202" url="?curid=471029" title="Shortland Street">
<text>Shortland Street is a New Zealand prime-time soap opera centring on the fictitious Shortland Street Hospital. The show was first broadcast on TVNZ 2 on 25 May 1992 and is New Zealand&#x27;s longest-running drama and soap opera, being broadcast continuously for over 8,000 episodes and 32 years (as of December 2024). It is one of the most watched television programmes in New Zealand.

The show was originally screened as five half-hour episodes each week, and received mixed reviews on its premiere. After its launch, the show suffered a drop in ratings and would have been cancelled if TVNZ had not ordered a year&#x27;s worth of episodes in advance. TVNZ renewed the production in early 1993 after the show&#x27;s ratings picked up, and the show has since garnered &quot;long-term public enthusiasm&quot;. Today, it is one of New Zealand&#x27;s highest-rated shows, frequently making AGB Nielsen Media Research&#x27;s top 5 programmes of the week, achieving an average linear daily reach of 345,000 viewers (in the year to June 2021) and is TVNZ&#x27;s &quot;most streamed show&quot;.

As of 2025, the soap airs 3 episodes a week at 7pm on TVNZ 2, with a repeat at 11pm on TVNZ 1, followed by another repeat the following day at 11am on TVNZ 2.

==Development==
After the cancellation of &quot;Gloss&quot;, Television New Zealand (TVNZ) noticed the lack of New Zealand content on their channels and, in 1990, set about creating a local equivalent of the Australian soap &quot;Neighbours&quot;. Greg McGee at South Pacific Pictures wanted to base a series on the new private clinics emerging under New Zealand&#x27;s Labour government and suggested the idea to scriptwriter Dean Parker, who declined due to a dislike of private medicine, so TV2 and South Pacific Pictures purchased a formula from Grundy Television, who receive a royalty cheque for every subsequent broadcast. A sum of $10 million was originally paid for an initial 230 episodes. Caterina De Nave was hired as the show&#x27;s producer and subsequently travelled to Australia to work with Grundy Television to work out the concept for the five times-a-week soap opera. TV2 programmer Bettina Hollings suggested the setting of a hospital after reading an article detailing ideal locations of a drama, which included hospitals, police stations and schools. De Nave worked with several storyliners including Jason Daniel to outline the show.

De Nave noticed &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot; had a generally straightforward Australian cast and wanted the cast of the show to be culturally diverse to reflect New Zealand society. She also wanted the cast to have strong female characters to attract a female audience. Daniel created the character of Kirsty while De Nave created Meredith and Ken Catran created Hone. The character of Stuart was originally planned to be gay but the plans made TVNZ nervous and were scrapped. De Nave also wished to counter-stereotype races and made Polynesian Sam Aleni a paramedic as there was only one paramedic of Polynesian descent throughout New Zealand. De Nave decided to make the setting that of a private hospital as it reflected New Zealand medicine at the time.

==History==
===1990s===
&quot;Shortland Street&quot;″s first episode aired on 25 May 1992 to mixed reviews. Ratings were originally high after a successful marketing campaign, but fell steadily throughout the year until 1993 when they rose dramatically. The show would have been cancelled in the first year if it was not for the fact TVNZ ordered a year&#x27;s worth of episodes.

===2000s===
With high public interest in the show and a viewing figure of a constant 600,000, &quot;Shortland Street&quot; received more sets and the outdated nursing uniforms were replaced. In 2000, an Australian consultant drastically changed the show so that it would suit the 21st century tone of New Zealand. This included transitioning the hospital to a public hospital, bringing in low income families and writing off 14 characters. Michael Galvin and Angela Bloomfield were brought back as their characters Chris Warner and Rachel McKenna and the show appointed a new producer.

The show reached huge ratings in 2007 when a Serial Killer Storyline was introduced, with five characters meeting their demise. Episode 4000 saw the return of series original Dr. Hone Ropata for a six-week stint in 2008.

===2010s===
&quot;Shortland Street&quot; aired its first ever 90-minute episode on 2 August 2010. The episode featured Chris discovering he had a son with series original Alison Raynor in 1996, and the conclusion to the three-year Kieran Mitchell storyline which saw the shows second highest ever ratings. &quot;Shortland Street&quot; has since made the 90-minute episode an annual feature. On 18 April 2011, &quot;Shortland Street&quot; screened its first episode in high definition.

In July 2011, &quot;Shortland Street&quot; achieved a New Zealand first when it made its 2011 feature-length episode available to purchase via Facebook, becoming the second ever TV show in the world to use this technology. In August 2011, All Blacks Keven Mealamu, Anthony Boric and Jerome Kaino filmed a scene that aired on the opening night of the 2011 Rugby World Cup on 9 September. The show added short transition scenes in which two characters in the hospital elevator discussed the wins or losses (the latter never actually happening) the All Blacks endured during the tournament.

On 15 December 2016, &quot;Shortland Street&quot; released a charity single featuring Lionel Wellington and J.J. Fong to raise money for Starship Children&#x27;s Health hospital.

On 25 May 2017, &quot;Shortland Street&quot; celebrated 25 years on New Zealand television.

===2020s===
Production of &quot;Shortland Street&quot; was suspended on 24 March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the nationwide lockdown from 26 March to 28 April 2020, and TVNZ 2 reduced broadcasting the show to three episodes per week to spread out the existing backlog of episodes. Production resumed on 30 April with some restrictions, such as intimate scenes not being allowed. The show returned to five episodes per week on 29 June 2020.

In early August 2022, the Minister of Health Andrew Little and a Health New Zealand spokesperson confirmed that &quot;Shortland Street&quot; and TVNZ&#x27;s advertising division TVNZ Blacksand Partnerships would be working with the Health Ministry, Health NZ, and New Zealand Nurses Organisation (NZNO) to produce the &quot;Real Nurses&quot; multimedia marketing campaign to recruit nursing workers from both domestic and overseas markets in order to address the country&#x27;s shortage of nurses. Little confirmed that the Real Nurses multimedia campaign would be integrated into the television series&#x27; storyline. In response, NZNO President Anne Daniels criticised the series for misrepresenting the difficult working conditions for nurses while National Party MP Chris Penk expressed concerns about the collaboration between the Government and creative industry. In response to criticism, Little stated that the &quot;Real Nurses&quot; campaign had been created by the NZNO, which had approached the Government to secure financial support for it. Auckland University of Technology (AUT) communication professor Dr. Rosser Johnson expressed support for the &quot;Real Nurses&quot; multimedia campaign, arguing that it could encourage younger demographics to consider nursing as a career and rejected claims that it would serve as government propaganda.

In 2024 South Pacific Pictures CEO Kelly Martin said that the company was in &quot;close conversations&quot; with TVNZ about funding the programme after TVNZ cut several programmes due to financial pressure. In July 2024, it was confirmed &quot;Shortland Street&quot; would be reduced from five to three episodes a week, beginning in 2025.

===Spinoffs===
Since 2018, there are weekly spinoffs during Christmas and New Year breaks that are exclusively streamed on TVNZ On Demand. The most recent being &quot;Shortland Street: Retribution&quot;, the first spinoff with an R16 (Violence and Coarse Language) rating, with the storyline revolving around Constable Curtis Hannah (Jaden Daniel) and Esther Samuels (Ngahuia Piripi). The series is also the first spinoff to be set in Christchurch and the South Island.

==Characters==
&quot;Shortland Street&quot; stars an ensemble cast. Most of the characters either work at Shortland Street Hospital, or are relations to employees of the hospital.

Since 1992, many notable faces have appeared on the soap. Only one character remains from the original cast: Chris Warner. Though taking a 4-year break, Chris has featured in the show the longest of the current cast, outstaying all of his family, who either died or left. Rachel McKenna, another long-standing character , first appeared in the soap in 1993 and has made regular appearances since. Nick Harrison, another long-running character, disappeared from the show in 2005. Currently Esther Samuels is the longest-running female character, joining the show in 2015.

Characters on the show attribute and portray several different demographics found in New Zealand. These range from the rich and well-off (such as Chris Warner) to the struggling and poor (Wendy Cooper). Other areas covered include different ethnicities, sexualities, genders, and abilities. In the first year of the show, it was decided that CEO Michael McKenna&#x27;s personal assistant, Jenny, should be a solo mother to help draw in that demographic, who statistically would be watching TV at 7 pm. The show has also had a long string of families, such as the Warners, McKennas, Harrisons, Crombies, Hudsons, Jeffries, Valentines, McKays, Coopers, Avia-Levis, Hannahs, and Kings and various teenagers, helping young audiences and families relate to the show.

==Production==
The working title was &quot;The Shortland Street Project&quot; after its planned filming location in a TVNZ-owned studio at 74 Shortland Street in Auckland Central. However, the studio was found to be too small for the required sets, and the production studio was moved to a warehouse in Browns Bay. After running through many name options, the original working-title was chosen and subsequently truncated to simply &quot;Shortland Street&quot;. The name subsequently is a homage to the Shortland Street studios, which were home to New Zealand&#x27;s first regular television broadcast in 1960, and were home to TVNZ and its predecessors&#x27; Auckland operations until TVNZ moved to its new purpose-built television centre on Victoria Street West in 1990.

&quot;Shortland Street&quot; is produced by South Pacific Pictures, with assistance from Fremantle and Television New Zealand. In the first few years, the production was also assisted by New Zealand On Air.

Today, most of the filming for &quot;Shortland Street&quot; occurs at South Pacific Pictures West Auckland studios, with Ferndale High School scenes being filmed at the nearby Waitākere College. The exterior shots of the hospital are filmed on location at the Waitakere Studios at an existing section of a building dressed up to appear as the facade of a hospital entrance. Location scenes are filmed in Auckland, but other locations, including Fiji, Mt Ruapehu, Rotorua and Rarotonga have been used.

Originally, &quot;Shortland Street&quot; was filmed at Browns Bay on the North Shore until their relocation to purpose built studios in West Auckland in 2000. The original Ferndale High School was played by a North Shore college until the studio relocated.
When cast members are hired their contracts are either 4 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 6 months or a year.

While the name Shortland Street is based on an actual street in Auckland CBD, the only place where the scenes are actually filmed in Auckland CBD is the fictitious Q Road, which is the actual Karangahape Road, better known as K&#x27; Rd.

High definition production of Shortland Street started in early 2011, with the first HD episode broadcast on 18 April 2011 on the Freeview HD and Sky platforms.

On 24 July 2018 It was announced that the show will air six nights a week starting in September 2018.

The show has had a reputation for being raunchy and controversial with the very first episode of the show featuring a sex scene between resident &quot;Dr. Love&quot; Chris Warner and his aerobics instructor. Another early controversy was that of a lesbian kiss between Meredith Fleming and Annie Flynn with several complaints made to the Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) but it went no further. It was not until 2008 that the show received its first ever BSA warning, when it featured an oral sex scene in mid-2008 between sexually confused Gerald and a fellow man. A few months later, the show received a second warning for an episode in August 2008 depicting the brutal murder of Craig Valentine, who was beaten unconscious, then set alight in his car. Again, a few months later, the show received yet another warning about a scene in January 2009 where Tania Jeffries hit a gang leader in the head with a hammer.

Scenes aired in April 2010 sparked criticism when Leanne Miller and her daughter Nicole stated that the city of Tauranga was not &quot;gay friendly&quot;.

The show caused controversy in August 2010 when the character of Sophie McKay was shown to be being stalked by her university lecturer who she had been dating. This upset the family of murdered girl Sophie Elliott who was killed by her university tutor, Clayton Weatherston, who she had been dating. The similarities upset the families with producer Steven Zanoski saying: &quot;the storyline was a classic and not inspired by real events.&quot;

The show&#x27;s production department received several complaints following the lesbian love storyline involving Maia Jeffries and Jennifer Mason.

A storyline aired in April 2011 which featured the Cooper Family try to go to the beach, but they get confronted by a group of Māori who demand money. This sparked criticism with some saying it was discrimination against Māori people. Maori adviser Ngamaru Raerino stated that viewers shouldn&#x27;t have jumped to conclusions and should have let the storyline completely unfold which reveals the group are protesting against a corrupt camp owner who had been polluting the beach.

In September 2011, &quot;Shortland Street&quot; was identified as one of the main influences to people who self-harm, airing two storylines involving suicide attempts.

During 2017, one episode ended with a cliffhanger featuring Chris Warner confronting his son Harry with a &#x27;dick pic&#x27; he found on his tablet computer. A video clip of the scene, including the line &quot;Please tell me that is not your penis!&quot;, went viral worldwide, even to a point of parody on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; recreated by said host and Alec Baldwin.&quot;&quot; The line was voted the New Zealand Quote of the Year in a contest held by Massey University.

In December 2023, Shortland Street started uploading episodes to YouTube, starting from the first season in 1992.

==International==
===Australia===
In Australia, free-to-air digital channel 7Two aired episodes about three years behind until August 2015. Previous Australian broadcasters include: ABC 2010–2011, UKTV 1997–2000, and SBS briefly between 1994 and 1995. The show aired on Fox One for several years, before Foxtel abruptly dropped the show in November 2020, which was attracting only 7,000 viewers per episode overnight (and another 7,000 in consolidated viewing figures). As Shortland Street qualifies as Australian content under the free trade agreement between the two countries, its future on Australian television became unclear for a time. However, it was announced on 16 December 2020 that the series had been picked up by SBS Viceland. The remainder of Season 28 (2020) aired on the SBS On Demand service, before SBS Viceland started broadcasting new episodes in sync with New Zealand (the first time this had happened on Australian television) beginning with Season 29 from 11 January 2021.

===Ireland===
The show debuted on RTÉ One in October 1997, airing weekdays at 17.30, later moving to 16.50. In more recent years it was broadcast in the mornings; times varied from 10:40–11:55 due to RTÉ One&#x27;s somewhat fluid morning schedule. This episode was repeated at 17.30 on RTÉ Two. As of August 2022, the show airs weekdays at 14:00 on RTÉ One, repeated at 18:00 on RTÉ Two. Episodes broadcast in the past 30 days are also available on the RTÉ Player.. On 18 September 2023 however, it returned to being broadcast at 11:40 because of Australian soap drama Neighbours&#x27;s return. After 27 years of continuous broadcast on RTÉ One, Shortland Street was moved to RTÉ Two in 2024. It now airs at 18:30, after a 18:00 repeat of Neighbours beforehand.

Episodes are around four years behind New Zealand (about 1&#x27;000 episodes). RTÉ has broadcast the show since 1997, making Ireland one of few countries to have aired the series unbroken from the outset since it began. RTÉ do not edit explicit language, however some of the more graphic scenes are edited out on rare occasions.

===Pacific===
In Fiji, the show has been on air since 1994 screening weekdays on Fiji One usually around 8:30 pm weekdays. It is one of the most popular shows in Fiji. The show is screened on Cook Island Television at 8.00 pm weekdays. It is one of the most popular shows in the Cook Islands.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the series was originally screened on various regions of the ITV network from 1993 to 2003. From 29 March 1993, Central were the first ITV region to screen the soap, beginning in an afternoon timeslot, 15:20–15:50. However, in September 1993, the start time for children&#x27;s programming block CITV was moved to 15:30, so &quot;Shortland Street&quot; was moved to lunchtimes at 13:55. Six months later in April 1994 to 2000, it was shown in an early evening timeslot, first at 17:10–17:40 (immediately before the ITN Early Evening News) and, later at 17:30–18:00. Eventually the serial was moved back to the lunchtime slot, 13:00–13:30, from 12 June 2000 and it remained there for over two years.

Meridian become the second region to start the series in mid-1993 around 14:30 until late 2002. Anglia followed in April 1994 and, like Central, aired the show at 17:10.They dropped the series around 2000.

Ulster began broadcasting in April 1994, at 2.50pm. Shortland Street replaced The Young Doctors, which Ulster had completed in the same month.

From May 1994, Border, Granada started showing the series as a replacement for &quot;A Country Practice&quot; (although some regions continued to air both), broadcast in the afternoons at their own pace in various daytime slots. In January 1995, Tyne Tees and Yorkshire started the series as a replacement for &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;. By 1999, Granada, Yorkshire and Tyne Tees had all dropped the series entirely, opting for local programming instead, while Border switched the series to a 17:10 slot. By 2001, it was moved to an earlier afternoon timeslot until it dropped altogether in the summer of 2003.

Grampian also started the series in 1994 but it was dropped by late 1998. Scottish have never broadcast &quot;Shortland Street&quot;. HTV started the series in August 1994, mostly in an afternoon slot but also in an early evening slot for a short time. The series was dropped in early 2000, but reappeared again that May.

From January 2003, the Carlton-owned ITV franchises including Central Television, Westcountry, HTV and Carlton-London networked &quot;Shortland Street&quot; in an afternoon slot, 14:30–15:00, Monday to Wednesday, with a Thursday episode added a few months later. A special programme was aired (presented by stalwart Shortland Street cast members Michael Galvin (Chris Warner) and Angela Bloomfield (Rachel McKenna)) introducing new viewers from Westcountry and Carlton-London to the show. Viewers in the HTV region skipped a large number of episodes to bring it in line with Central. However, &quot;Shortland Street&quot; failed to attract a significant audience in its new afternoon slot and was axed completely by ITV and was last shown on 28 August 2003, finishing at episode 2367. Central had shown the serial consecutively for over 10 years.

&quot;Shortland Street&quot; returned to British screens on 23 August 2010, when Living began airing two episodes a day from the 2007 season with episodes 3736/3737 which originally aired in New Zealand on 21/22 May 2007 beginning on 23 August 2010 at 15.00–16.00 (and repeated at 10.00 the following morning). However, four weeks into its run the morning repeats were dropped by Living, and as of Monday 20 September moving from 15.00 to 16.00 and 12.00–13.00. As from Monday 27 September 2010, it was shown on Living Loves from 18.00 to 19.00 Monday to Friday with five repeat episodes shown on Saturday and Sunday mornings. After just over two months on-air it was cancelled by Sky with the final episode shown on 29 October 2010.

The show had not aired in the UK since. However Amazon Freevee announced on 1 December 2023 that Shortland Street was being added to their UK streaming service. On 6 December 2023, Freevee uploaded Season 30 (2021) and Season 31 (2022) in their entirety.

<doc id="471030" wikidata="Q6932364" url="?curid=471030" title="Muhammad Ali's rise to power">
<text>Muhammad Ali rose to power in Egypt following a long, four-way civil war between the Ottoman Empire, Egyptian Mamluks who had ruled Egypt for centuries, and Albanian mercenaries in the service of the Ottomans. The conflict ended in victory for the Albanians (from Rumelia) led by Ali.

The four-way struggle occurred following the French invasion of Egypt by Napoleon. After the French were defeated, a power vacuum was created in Egypt. The Mamluks had governed Egypt before the French invasion and still retained power in the region. However, Egypt was officially a part of the Ottoman Empire and many Ottoman troops who had been sent to evict the French were still present.

==Albanians under Tahir rise and seize Cairo from Hüsrev Pasha==
In March 1803, the British evacuated Alexandria leaving a power vacuum in Egypt. Muhammad Bey al-Alfi (aka Alfi Bey) (1751–1807) had accompanied the British to lobby them to help restore the power of the Mamluks. In their attempts to return to power, the Mamluks took Minia and interrupted communication between Upper and Lower Egypt. About six weeks later, Koca Hüsrev Mehmed Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Egypt, was unable to pay all the troops under his command, so he attempted to disband his Albanian (Arnaut) bashi-bazouks without pay in order to be able to pay his regular Turkish soldiers. The Albanians refused to disband and instead surrounded the house of the &quot;defterdar&quot; (finance minister), who appealed in vain to Hüsrev Pasha to satisfy their claims. Instead, the pasha commenced an artillery bombardment from batteries located in and near his palace on the insurgent soldiers who had taken the house of the &quot;defterdar&quot;, located in the Azbakeya. The citizens of Cairo, accustomed to such occurrences, immediately closed their shops and armed themselves. The tumult in the city continued all day, and the next morning, troops sent by Hüsrev Pasha failed to quell it.

The Albanian commander, Tahir Pasha, then returned to the citadel, gaining admittance through an embrasure, and from there began a counter bombardment of the pasha&#x27;s forces over the roofs of the intervening houses. Soon thereafter, Tahir descended with his guns to the Azbakeya and then laid close siege to the governor&#x27;s palace. The following day, Koca Hüsrev Mehmed Pasha fled with his women, servants, and regular troops to Damietta along the Nile.

Tahir then assumed control of the government, but within 23 days encountered trouble due to his own inability to pay all of his forces. This time, it was Turkish troops who went without pay, and they in turn mutinied and assassinated him. During the course of the mutiny, the governor&#x27;s palace was burnt and plundered. A desperate, prolonged, and confusing conflict then ensued between the Albanians and Turks, with the divided Mamluks oscillating between the two factions or attempting to regain power themselves.

==Muhammad Ali assumes control and captures Ahmed Pasha==
Tahir was replaced as commander of the Albanians by Muhammad Ali, one of the regimental commanders. Fearing for his position with the Ottomans, he entered into an alliance with the Mamluk leaders Ibrahim Bey and Osman Bey al-Bardisi.

With Hüsrev Pasha fortifying himself at Damietta, the Turkish troops in the vicinity of Cairo acclaimed Muftizade Ahmed Pasha, the Ottoman mayor of Medina (and previously Damietta), as their new governor. Muhammad Ali, however, refused to surrender Cairo to him. In reordering his forces to meet the new threat, he also removed the Mamluks from Giza, where they had been invited by his predecessor, Tahir.

Muftizade Ahmed Pasha established himself at the mosque of Baybars, which the French had converted into a fortress, but was eventually besieged by Muhammad Ali and his Albanian troops in the citadel of Cairo and compelled to surrender. Among the prisoners, those Turkish troops who had been involved in the assassination of Tahir Pasha were put to death.

==Capture of Hüsrev and Damietta==
Muhammad Ali gave control over the Cairo citadel to his Mamluk allies. Soon after, they marched against Hüsrev Pasha, who had been joined by a considerable number of Turks in a well-fortified position at Damietta. Hüsrev was defeated, captured, and brought to Cairo by the Albanians. The bashi-bazouks sacked Damietta, but Hüsrev was treated with respect.

==Trabluslu Ali Pasha attempts to regain control==
Days later, Trabluslu Ali Pasha landed at Alexandria with a firman from the Ottoman Porte appointing him the new governor of Egypt, and assumed control of the remaining Turkish forces. He threatened the Mamluk beys, now virtual masters of Upper Egypt, as well as of the capital and nearly all of Lower Egypt. Muhammad Ali and his Mamluk ally, al-Bardisi, therefore descended on Rosetta, which had fallen into the hands of a brother of Trabluslu Ali Pasha. The town and its commander were successfully captured by al-Bardisi, who then proposed to proceed against Alexandria; his troops, however, demanded back-pay which he was unable to provide. During this delay, Trabluslu Ali Pasha destroyed the dykes between the lakes of Aboukir and Mareotis, creating a moat around Alexandria. Unable to proceed with operations against Alexandria, Al-Bardisi and Muhammad Ali returned to Cairo.

The troubles of Egypt were exacerbated by an insufficient flood of the Nile, resulting in great scarcity, aggravated by the onerous taxation the Mamluk beys were forced to resort to in order to pay their troops. Riots and violence continued in the capital, with the bashi-bazouks under little or no control.

Meanwhile, Trabluslu Ali Pasha had been behaving with brutality towards the French in Alexandria. He received written instructions from the Ottoman sultan, which in an effort to sow dissension and mistrust between Muhammad Ali Pasha and his Mamluk allies, he sent to Cairo and caused to be circulated there. The Ottoman sultan announced that the Mamluk beys could live peaceably in Egypt with annual pensions of fifteen purses and other privileges, provided the government returned to the hands of the Turkish governor. To this many of the beys assented, and in the process opened a rift with Muhammad Ali Pasha and the Albanians. The Mamluks had already been suspicious of their Albanian allies, having previously intercepted letters addressed to them from Trabluslu Ali Pasha, endeavoring to win their alliance as well.

Trabluslu Ali Pasha advanced towards Cairo with 3,000 men to discuss his resumption of control. The forces of the beys still with Muhammad Ali Pasha and their Albanian allies advanced to meet Trabluslu Ali Pasha at Shelqan, forcing the Ottoman governor to fall back on a place called Zufeyta.

At this point, the Albanians managed to seize Trabluslu Ali Pasha&#x27;s transport boats, capturing soldiers, servants, ammunition, and baggage. They then demanded to know why he had brought such a large host with him, contrary to both custom and a prior warning to not do so. Finding his advance blocked, reluctant to retreat with his forces to Alexandria, and being surrounded by the enemy in any case, Trabluslu Ali Pasha attempted to give battle, but his men refused to fight. He therefore abandoned his troops and went over to the camp of the Mamluk beys. His army was eventually allowed to retire to Syria.

With Trabluslu Ali Pasha in the hands of the beys, a horseman was seen to leave his tent one night at full gallop, and it was discovered that he bore a letter to Osman Bey Hasan, the governor of Kine (Kucuk Kine, Turkey). This gave the Mamluks a welcome pretext to rid themselves of him. Trabluslu Ali Pasha was sent under an escort/ guard of forty-five men towards the Syrian frontier; about a week later, news was received that during a skirmish with some of his own soldiers, he had fallen mortally wounded.

==Return and flight of al-Alfi==
The death of Trabluslu Ali Pasha produced only temporary tranquility. On February 12, 1804, The Mamluk leader Muhammad Bey al-Alfi returned from the United Kingdom, splitting the Mamluks into two parties, one gathered around al-Alfi and the other around al-Bardisi, the latter having by then gained an ascendency among the Mamluks. The guns of the citadel and of the palace were fired three times each in al-Alfi&#x27;s honor at news of his return, but preparations were simultaneously begun to oppose him before he arrived in Cairo.

Al-Alfi&#x27;s partisans gathered opposite Cairo and held nearby Giza, when Husain Bey, one of al-Alfi&#x27;s relatives, was assassinated by emissaries of al-Bardisi. Muhammad Ali Pasha seized upon this as a pretext to restore order, and took possession of Giza, which was given over to his troops to pillage.

Unaware of these events, al-Alfi embarked at Rashid and made his way to Cairo. Encountering a party of Albanians south of the town of Manfif, he was surprised in an ambush and only escaped with difficulty. Al-Alfi then made his way to the eastern branch of the Nile, but the region had become dangerous and he fled to the desert. There he had several close escapes and at last secreted himself among a tribe of Bedouin Arabs at Ras al-Wgdi.

==Al-Bardisi and the Albanians fall out==
In the meantime, the fortunes of Al-Alfi&#x27;s main Mamluk opponent, Al-Bardisi, began to decline. In order to satisfy the Albanian troops&#x27; demands for pay, he gave orders to levy heavy contributions from the citizens of Cairo. That roused the citizenry to open rebellion. The Albanians, alarmed for their safety, assured the populace that they would not allow the public order to collapse, and Muhammad Ali issued a proclamation to that effect and offered other concessions to calm the public.

Although their demands for pay had been the cause for Al-Bardisi&#x27;s onerous levies that led to the public disturbances, Muhammad Ali Pasha&#x27;s proclamation and concessions resulted in the Albanian forces gaining in popularity amongst the citizens, at the expense of the Mamluks. They soon took advantage of the opportunity. Three days later (March 12, 1804) the Albanians attacked the houses of al-Bardisi, as well as that of the aged Mamluk leader Ibrahim Bey. Both barely managed to escape. Upon hearing of the attack on their leaders&#x27; houses, the Mamluks in the Cairo citadel opened an artillery bombardment on the houses of the Albanians which were situated in the Azbakeya; but, on hearing of the flight of their chiefs, they evacuated the citadel.

Muhammad Ali Pasha, on gaining possession of the Cairo citadel, proclaimed Mahommed Khosrev Pasha governor of Egypt. For one day and a half Khosrev enjoyed the title; then the friends of the late Tahir Pasha succeeded in killing him. Cairo immediately descended into violent chaos at the hands of the triumphant Albanians, who ransacked and looted the houses of the Mamluk chiefs, whose harems where met with no mercy at their hands.

The Albanians then invited Hurshid Ahmed Pasha to assume the reins of government, and he without delay proceeded from Alexandria to Cairo.

In the meantime, the forces of the partisans of al-Bardisi were ravaging the countryside a few miles south of the capital and intercepting the river borne corn supplies. Soon thereafter, they advanced to the north of Cairo and successively took Bilbeis and Kalyub, plundering both, destroying the crops, and slaughtering the livestock.

Cairo was in a state of tumult, suffering severely from a scarcity of grain, as well as from the heavy exactions of the pasha to meet the demands of his troops, whose numbers had been augmented by a Turkish detachment. The shops were closed, and the unfortunate people assembled in great crowds, crying &quot;Y Latif! Y Latif!&quot; (O Gracious ).

Events were then further complicated by the reappearance of al-Alfi, who joined forces with Osman Bey Hasan. Both Al-Alfi and Hasan had professed allegiance to the pasha, but they soon turned against him and advanced upon the capital from the south. Their forces clashed with those of Muhammad Ali Pasha, and managed to seize from him the two fortresses of Tur.

Muhammad Ali managed to speedily retake the fortresses in a night assault utilizing 4,000 infantry and cavalry. However, he was then forced to turn his attention northward, where the other Mamluks on that side of Cairo attacked and penetrated into the capital&#x27;s suburbs. They in turn were defeated a few days later in a battle fought at Shubra, with heavy loss on both sides. This double reverse temporarily united the two Mamluk parties of al-Bardisi and al-Alfi, although the two chiefs remained personally antagonistic.

Al-Bardisi shifted his forces to the south of Cairo, and the Mamluks gradually retreated towards Upper Egypt. There, the governor sent against them three successive expeditions (one of which was commanded by Muhammad Ali Pasha), and many inconclusive battles were fought without decisive result.

During this period another calamity befell Egypt; about 3,000 Kurdish &quot;deli&quot; light cavalry arrived in Cairo from Syria. These troops had been sent for by Hurshid Ahmed Pasha in order to strengthen himself against the Albanians, but their arrival resulted in the immediate return of Muhammad Ali and his Albanians from their campaign against the Mamluks in the south.

The Delis, rather than aid Hurshid Ahmed Pasha, were the proximate cause of his overthrow. Cairo was ripe for revolt; Hurshid Ahmed Pasha was hated for his tyranny and extortion, and reviled for the misconduct of his troops, especially the Delis. The sheikhs enjoined the people to close their shops, and the soldiers clamored for pay. At this juncture a firman arrived from Constantinople conferring on Muhammad Ali the governorship of Jedda. Within a few days, however, he managed to seize Egypt instead.

==Muhammad Ali ousts Hurshid Ahmed Pasha==
On May 17, 1805, the sheikhs, with an immense concourse of the inhabitants, assembled in the vicinity of the governor&#x27;s residence, and the &quot;ulema&quot;, amid the prayers and cries of the people, wrote a statement of the wrongs which they had endured under the administration of Hurshid Ahmed Pasha. The &quot;ulema&quot; intended to go to the citadel and present the statement to the governor, but they were apprised of intended treachery on Hurshid Ahmed Pasha&#x27;s part. The following day, after holding another council, they proceeded to Muhammad Ali and informed him that the people would no longer submit to Hurshid Ahmed Pasha. As related by Muhammad Ali, when asked whom they would have, they replied that they would accept Muhammad Ali Pasha himself to govern them according to the laws; for they saw in his countenance that he was possessed of justice and goodness. Muhammad Ali seemed to hesitate, and then complied, and was at once invested.

On this a bloody struggle began between the two pashas. Hurshid Ahmed Pasha, being informed of the insurrection, immediately prepared to withstand a siege in the Cairo citadel. Two chiefs of the Albanians deserted Muhammad Ali and joined Hurshid Ahmed Pasha&#x27;s party, while many of his soldiers deserted him and went over to Muhammad Ali. Muhammad Ali&#x27;s strength lay in the popular support of the citizens of Cairo, who looked on him as a savior from their afflictions; and great numbers armed themselves, and with the sayyid Omar and the sheikhs at their head, commenced to patrol and guarding the city at night.

On the 19th of the same month Muhammad Ali commenced a siege of Hurshid Ahmed Pasha in the citadel. A few days later, Hurshid Ahmed Pasha gave orders to cannonade and bombard the city. For six days the bombardment continued, while the citadel itself was subject to counter bombardment in turn from batteries located in nearby hills.

Muhammad Ali&#x27;s position at this time became very precarious. His troops grew mutinous due to arrears in their pay; a lieutenant of Hurshid Ahmed Pasha, his silahdar, who had commanded one of the expeditions against the Mamluks, advanced to the relief of his commander; and the latter ordered the Delis to march to his assistance. The firing ceased on Friday, but began again on the eve of Saturday and lasted until the next Friday.

On the following day (May 28), news came of the arrival at Alexandria of a messenger from Istanbul. That night in Cairo presented a curious spectacle; many of the inhabitants, believing that this envoy would put an end to their miseries, fired off their weapons as they paraded the streets with bands of music. The silahdar, imagining the noise to be a battle, marched in haste towards the citadel, while its garrison sallied forth and began throwing up entrenchments in the quarter of Arab al-Yesgr, but were repulsed by the armed inhabitants and the Albanian soldiers stationed there. During this time the cannonade and bombardment from the citadel, and on it from the batteries on nearby hills, continued unabated.

The envoy brought a firman confirming Muhammad Ali Pasha as governor of Egypt, and ordering Hurshid Ahmed Pasha to go to Alexandria, there to await further orders; but this he refused to do, on the ground that he had been appointed by a &quot;Hatt-i Sharif&quot;. The artillery ceased firing on the following day, but the troubles of the citizenry were increased rather than lessened, for law and order suffered a near total breakdown. Murders and robberies were daily committed by the soldiery, the shops were all shut and some of the streets barricaded.

While these scenes were being enacted in Cairo, al-Alfi and his Mamluks were besieging Damanhur, and the other Mamluk beys were marching towards Cairo, Hurshid Ahmed Pasha having called them to his assistance. However, Muhammad Ali Pasha intercepted their advance and forced them to retreat.

Soon thereafter, a squadron under the command of the Turkish high admiral arrived at Aboukir Bay, with dispatches from the Ottoman sultan confirming the former envoy&#x27;s firman, and authorizing Muhammad Ali Pasha to continue to discharge the functions of governor of Egypt. Hurshid Ahmed Pasha at first refused to yield; but at length, on condition that his troops be paid, he evacuated the Cairo citadel and embarked for Rosetta.

==Defeat of the Mamluks==

Muhammad Ali now possessed the title of Governor of Egypt, but beyond the walls of Cairo his authority was everywhere disputed by the forces of the Mamluk beys, who were joined by the army of the silahdar of Hurshid Ahmed Pasha, as well as many Albanians who had deserted from his ranks.

A plan was soon conceived to destroy the Mamluk beys encamped north of Cairo. On August 17, 1805, they were informed that the dam of the canal of Cairo was to be cut, and some chiefs of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s party wrote to the Mamluks, informing them that the Pasha would go there early that morning with most of his troops to witness the ceremony, thus presenting the Mamluks with an opportunity to enter and seize the city. To further the deception, the double agents negotiated for monetary rewards in return for providing more detailed information.

The dam, however, had been cut early in the preceding night, without any ceremony, and Muhammad Ali Pasha&#x27;s forces were positioned to ambush the Mamluks. On the following morning, the Mamluk beys, at the head of sizeable forces, broke open the gate of the suburb al-Husainia, and gained admittance into the city from the north through the gate called Bāb el-Futuh. They marched along the principal street for some distance, with kettledrums thudding behind each company, and were received with apparent joy by the citizens. At the mosque called the Ashrafia they separated, one party proceeding to the Al-Azhar Mosque and the houses of certain sheikhs, and the other continuing along the main street and through the gate called Bab Zuweyla, where they turned up towards the Cairo citadel. Here they were fired upon from the surrounding houses by forces loyal to Muhammad Ali Pasha, which was a prelude to a massacre of the ambushed Mamluks.

Falling back towards their companions, the Mamluks found the side streets blocked; and in that part of the main thoroughfare called Bain al-Kasrain they were caught between two fires. Thus shut up in a narrow street, some sought refuge in the collegiate mosque Barkukia, while the remainder fought their way through the encircling cordon, abandoned their horses, and escaped over the city-wall on foot.

Two Mamluks had in the meantime succeeded, by great exertions, in giving the alarm to their comrades in the vicinity of the Al-Azhar Mosque, thus enabling that faction to escape by the eastern gate called Bib al-Ghoraib.

A horrible fate awaited those who had shut themselves up in the Barkukia. Having begged for quarter first and surrendered, they were immediately stripped nearly naked, and about fifty were slaughtered on the spot, while about the same number were dragged away. Among them were four beys, one of whom, driven to madness by Muhammad Ali&#x27;s mockery, asked for a drink of water; but when his hands were untied that he might take the bottle, he snatched a dagger from one of the soldiers, rushed at the pasha, and fell covered with wounds. The wretched captives were then chained and left in the court of the pasha&#x27;s house; and on the following morning the heads of their comrades who had perished the day before were skinned and stuffed with straw before their eyes.

One bey and two others paid their ransom and were released; the rest were tortured and put to death in the course of the ensuing night. Eighty-three heads (many of them those of Frenchmen and Albanians) were stuffed and sent to Constantinople, with a boast that the Mamluk chiefs were utterly destroyed. Thus ended Muhammad Ali&#x27;s first massacre of his too-confiding enemies.

The Mamluk beys appear to have despaired of regaining their ascendancy after this, and most of them retreated to Upper Egypt, from where attempts at compromise failed. Al-Alfi offered his submission on the condition of the cession of the Fayum and other provinces; but this was refused, and that chief gained two successive but indecisive victories over Muhammad Ali Pasha&#x27;s troops, many of whom deserted to the Mamluks.

At length, after remonstrances had been received from the British and a promise had made by al-Alfi of 1500 purses, the Ottoman Porte consented to reinstate twenty-four Mamluk beys and to place al-Alfi at their head. This measure met with the opposition of Muhammad Ali, as well as the determined resistance of the majority of the Mamluks, who, rather than have al-Alfi at their head, preferred their present condition; for the enmity of al-Bardisi had not subsided, and he commanded the voice of most of the other beys.

Proceeding however with its plans, the Ottomans sent a naval squadron under Salih Pasha, shortly before appointed high admiral, which arrived at Alexandria on 1 July 1806 with 3,000 regular troops and a successor to Muhammad Ali, who was to receive the pashalik of Salonika.

Muhammad Ali professed his willingness to obey the commands of the Porte, but stated that his troops, to whom he owed a vast sum of money, opposed his departure. He induced the &quot;ulema&quot; to sign a letter, praying the sultan to revoke the command for reinstating the beys, persuaded the chiefs of the Albanian troops to swear personal allegiance to him, and sent 2000 purses contributed by them to Istanbul.

Al-Alfi was at that time besieging Damanhur, and he gained a signal victory over the Pasha&#x27;s troops; but the dissensions of the Mamluk beys squandered their last chance at regaining power. Al-Alfi and his partisans failed to raise the sum promised to the Porte; Salih Pasha received plenipotentiary powers from Istanbul, but in consequence of the letter from the ulema; and, on the condition of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s paying 4,000 purses to the Porte, it was decided that he should continue in his post as governor of Egypt, and the reinstatement of the beys was abandoned.

Fortune continued to favor Muhammad Ali, for in the following month al-Bardisi died, aged forty-eight years; and soon after, a scarcity of provisions caused al-Alfi&#x27;s troops to revolt and mutiny. They reluctantly raised the siege of Damanhur, being in daily expectation of the arrival of a British army; and at the village of Shubra-ment, al-Alfi was struck by a sudden illness, and died on January 30, 1807, at the age of fifty-five. Thus was Muhammad Ali relieved of his two most formidable enemies; and shortly after he defeated Shahin Bey, with the loss to the latter of his artillery and baggage and 300 men killed or taken prisoners.

===Fraser campaign===
On March 17, 1807, a British fleet appeared off Alexandria, with nearly 5,000 troops, under the command of General Alexander Mackenzie-Fraser, and commenced the Alexandria expedition of 1807. The people of Alexandria, being disaffected towards Muhammad Ali, opened the city&#x27;s gates to the British. Here they first heard of the death of al-Alfi, upon whose cooperation the expedition had counted for its success.

The British immediately despatched messengers to al-Alfi&#x27;s successor and to the other Mamluk beys, inviting them to Alexandria. The British resident, Major Missett, having urged the importance of taking Rosetta and Rahmaniya in order to secure supplies for Alexandria, General Fraser, with the concurrence of the admiral, Sir John Thomas Duckworth, detached the 31st regiment and the Chasseurs Britanniques, accompanied by some field artillery under Major-General Wauchope and Brigadier-General Meade. Those troops entered Rosetta without opposition; but as soon as they had dispersed among the narrow streets, the local garrison opened a deadly fire on them from the latticed windows and the roofs of the houses. The British retreated towards Aboukir and Alexandria, with 185 killed and 281 wounded, General Wauchope and three officers being among the former, and General Meade and nineteen officers among the latter. The heads of the slain were fixed on stakes on each side of the road crossing the Azbakeya in Cairo.

Muhammad Ali, meanwhile, had been conducting an expedition against the Mamluk beys in Upper Egypt, and after defeating them near Asyut, he heard of the arrival of the British. Alarmed lest the surviving Mamluk beys should join the British, especially as they were already far north of his position, he immediately sent messengers to his rivals, promising to comply with all their demands if they should join him in expelling the invaders. His proposal being agreed to, both armies marched northwards towards Cairo on opposite sides of the river.

The possession of Rosetta being deemed indispensable, Brigadier-General Sir William Stewart and Brigadier-General John Oswald were sent there with 4,000 men. For thirteen days the town was bombarded without effect; and on April 20, news arrived from an advance guard at Al Hamed of sizeable reinforcements en route to rescue the besieged town. General Stewart was compelled to retreat, and a dragoon was despatched to Lieutenant-colonel Macleod, commanding at Al Hamed, with orders to fall back. However, the messenger was unable to penetrate the cordon around the British advance guard, by then besieged in Hamad, and the message was not delivered.

The advance guard in Hamad, consisting of a detachment of the 31st, two companies of the 78th, one of the 35th, and De Rolls regiment, with a picquet of dragoons, the whole mustering 733 men, was surrounded and, after a gallant resistance, the survivors, who had expended all their ammunition, became prisoners of war. General Stewart managed to regain Alexandria with the remainder of his force, having lost nearly 900 men. Some hundreds of British heads were now exposed on stakes in Cairo, and the prisoners were marched between the mutilated remains of their countrymen.

===Reaction===

Divisions soon emerged within the ranks of the Mamluk beys, with one party desiring to cooperate with the British, and the other seeking to continue cooperation with Muhammad Ali Pasha. The dissensions proved ruinous to their cause; and General Fraser, despairing of their assistance, evacuated Alexandria on September 14. From that date to the spring of 1811 the Mamluk beys from time to time relaxed certain of their demands; the pasha on his part granted them some of what before had been withheld. The province of the Fayum, and part of those of Giza and Beni-Suef, were ceded to Shahin bey; and a great portion of the Said, on the condition of paying land-tax, to the others Mamluk beys. Many of them took up their abode in Cairo, but peace was not secured. Several times during that period Mamluk forces clashed with those of Muhammad Ali Pasha in indecisive battles.

Early in the year 1811, during a lull in tensions, after preparations for an expedition against the Wahhabis in Arabia were completed, all the Mamluk beys then in Cairo were invited to the ceremony in the Cairo citadel for investing Muhammad Ali&#x27;s favorite son, Tusun, with a pelisse and the command of the army. On March 1, 1811, Shahin Bey and the other chiefs (with one exception) repaired with their retinues to the citadel, and were courteously received by the Pasha. Having taken coffee, they formed in procession, and, preceded and followed by Muhammad Ali&#x27;s troops, slowly descended the steep and narrow road leading to the great gate of the citadel.

As soon as the Mamluks arrived at the citadel&#x27;s gate it was suddenly shut before them. The last of those to leave before the gate was shut were Albanians under Salih Kush. To these troops, their chief now made known the Pasha&#x27;s orders to massacre all the Mamluks within the citadel. They proceeded to climb the walls and roofs of nearby houses that hemmed in the road in which the Mamluks were confined, and some stationed themselves upon the eminences of the rock through which that road is partly cut. They then opened fire on their victims; and immediately the troops at the tail end of the procession, who also had the advantage of higher ground, followed suit. Of the betrayed chiefs, many were killed in the opening volleys; some, dismounting and throwing off their outer robes, vainly sought, sword in hand, to return and escape by some other gate. However, the few who gained the summit of the citadel experienced the same fate as the rest, for no quarter was given.

Four hundred and seventy Mamluks entered the citadel; and of these very few, if any, escaped. However, folklore has it that one of the Mamluk beys succeeded in escaping by leaping with his horse from the ramparts, and alighted uninjured although the horse was killed by the fall. Others say that he was prevented from joining his comrades, and discovered the treachery while waiting by the gate. He fled and made his way to Syria.

The massacre of the Mamluks at the Cairo citadel was the signal for an indiscriminate slaughter of the Mamluks throughout Egypt, orders to this effect having been transmitted to every governor. In Cairo itself the houses of the Mamluk beys were given over to the soldiery. During the two following days the Muhammad Ali Pasha and his son Tusun rode about the streets and tried to stop the atrocities; but order was not restored until 500 houses had been pillaged. The heads of the beys were sent to Istanbul.

==Final skirmishes==

A remnant of the Mamluks fled to Nubia, and a tranquility was restored to Egypt to which it had long been unaccustomed.

In the year following the massacre the unfortunate exiles were attacked by Ibrahim Pasha, the eldest son of Muhammad Ali, in the fortified town of Ibrim, in Nubia. Here the want of provisions forced them to evacuate the place. A few who surrendered were beheaded, and the rest went farther south and built the town of New Dongola (correctly Dunkulah), where the venerable Ibrahim Bey died in 1816, at the age of eighty. As their numbers thinned, the surviving Mamluks endeavored to maintain their remaining power by training some hundreds of black people. However, soon it would all come to naught, on the approach of Ismail, another son of Muhammad Ali, who was sent with an army in 1820 to subdue Nubia and Sennar. At that point, some of the remaining Mamluks submitted, returned to Egypt, and settled in Cairo, while the rest, amounting to about 100 persons, fled in dispersed parties to the countries adjacent to Sennar.

<text>Oberheim is an American synthesizer manufacturer founded in 1969 by Tom Oberheim. Beginning in 1975, Oberheim developed some of the first commercially available polyphonic synthesizers and was a prominent synthesizer and drum machine manufacturer through the mid-1980s. In 1988, the company changed ownership and was eventually purchased by Gibson Guitar Corporation, which developed new Oberheim products and licensed the trademark to other companies that produced Oberheim products, but development of Oberheim products ceased after 2000. In 2009, Tom Oberheim began developing instruments through his own company, and in 2019, Gibson returned the Oberheim trademark to Tom Oberheim, whose company rebranded as Oberheim.

==History and products==
===Beginnings and first polyphonic synthesizers===

Tom Oberheim founded the company in 1969, originally as a designer and contract manufacturer of electronic effects devices for Chicago Musical Instruments under their Maestro brand, including the PS-1A Phase Shifter and RM-1 Ring Modulator, and briefly a retail dealer for ARP Instruments.

The company&#x27;s first product released under its own name was the Oberheim DS-2, one of the first digital music sequencers. Recognizing that customers wanted to play one synthesizer while the DS-2 played a sequence on another, or layer the sound of one synthesizer with another, Oberheim introduced the Synthesizer Expander Module (SEM), a semi-modular analog synthesizer module, in 1974.

In late 1975, to replace lost sales after Chicago Musical Instruments successor Norlin canceled several large Maestro orders, Oberheim developed a series of polyphonic synthesizers by combining multiple SEM modules with a digitally-scanned keyboard developed by Dave Rossum and a two-channel sequencer. The first of these was the Oberheim Two Voice, followed by the Four Voice and Eight Voice. These were among the first commercially available polyphonic synthesizers. Oberheim introduced the Two Voice and Four Voice at the June 1975 NAMM Show, the first time the company exhibited Oberheim-branded products. The following year, an optional Polyphonic Synthesizer Programmer module, capable of storing and recalling 16 instances of some SEM parameters, was made available for the Four Voice and Eight Voice.

Oberheim Polyphonic systems, with their distinctive signature cream-colored control panels, were used by such notable artists as Stevie Wonder, Lyle Mays of Pat Metheny Group, Herbie Hancock, Joe Zawinul of Weather Report, Jan Hammer, Geddy Lee of Rush.

===OB-series and The System===

In 1977, building on the technology developed for the Polyphonic Synthesizer Programmer, Oberheim introduced the monophonic OB-1, the world&#x27;s first completely programmable synthesizer. Following the introduction of the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 in 1978, Oberheim developed OB-series models, which replaced bulky independent SEMs with internal voice expansion cards which supported digital control of synthesis parameters, and also utilized common cabinetry and power supplies. The OB-X, introduced in 1979, was available in either 4-, 6-, or 8-voice configurations.

The OB-X was succeeded by the OB-Xa in 1980. The first Oberheim product adorned with the blue horizontal pinstripes on black background color scheme that would become the company&#x27;s signature look, the OB-Xa streamlined manufacturing and troubleshooting by utilizing Curtis integrated circuits. It also featured the Oberheim Serial Buss, a pre-MIDI proprietary parallel bus for directly interfacing the OB-Xa with other Oberheim Serial Buss-equipped products, such as the DMX drum machine introduced in 1980, and the DSX digital sequencer introduced the following year. The combination of the DSX, DMX and either OB-Xa or OB-8 were marketed by Oberheim as &quot;The System&quot;.

OB-series synthesizers and the DMX drum machine became a staple of 1980s new wave, synth-pop and hip hop music, heard on tracks such as Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;Jump&quot;, New Order&#x27;s Blue Monday, Herbie Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Rockit&quot;, Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Into the Groove&quot;, Prince&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot;, Phil Collins&#x27; &quot;Sussudio&quot;, and Stevie Nicks&#x27; &quot;Stand Back&quot;.

===Bankruptcy and changes in ownership===

Oberheim Electronics declared bankruptcy in 1985 and was acquired by a group of lawyers who changed the name to Oberheim ECC. Following the acquisition, Tom Oberheim was creatively still at the helm of the company for a couple of years, before leaving to found Marion Systems. During this time, Oberheim released several new products in its Matrix series of synthesizers, including the Xpander, Matrix-12 and Matrix-6.
After a second bankruptcy in early 1988, Oberheim was acquired by Gibson Guitar Corporation. Under the direction of Keith McMillen, Oberheim produced the OB-Mx in collaboration with D.N. &quot;Lynx&quot; Crowe and Don Buchla; the Echoplex Digital Pro digital delay and looper in collaboration with Aurisis Research (released both as an Oberheim- and Gibson-branded product); and re-released the Oberheim Strummer and Matrix 1000.

Gibson licensed the Oberheim trademark to Viscount International, an Italian manufacturer. Viscount developed the Oberheim OB*12 analog modeling synthesizer, the GM-1000 guitar multi-effects unit, the MC series of master keyboards, and the OB32, a virtual tonewheel organ.

===Tom Oberheim returns to the synthesizer market===
In 2009, Tom Oberheim announced that he was manufacturing a new version of the SEM. Even though no products had been manufactured under the Oberheim brand for years, the trademark was still owned by Gibson, so new SEMs were manufactured by Marion Systems Corporation, and branded with tomoberheim.com.
In 2011, Tom Oberheim announced plans to design and manufacture a successor to the Four Voice to be named &quot;Son Of 4 Voice&quot; (SO4V), as well as an updated version of the classic Two Voice to be named Two Voice Pro. The Two Voice Pro, again manufactured by Marion Systems and branded tomoberheim.com, started shipping in 2014. The following year, Tom Oberheim said that he had indefinitely shelved plans for the SO4V.

At the January 2016 NAMM Show, Tom Oberheim and Dave Smith Instruments announced the OB-6, a collaboration with Dave Smith resulting in Tom Oberheim&#x27;s first voltage-controlled multi-voiced polyphonic synth since the mid-1980s; Tom Oberheim designed the voice card with the circuits of the SEM&#x27;s VCOs, VCFs, and VCAs, while control features, arpeggiator/step sequencer and effects processing were designed by Smith using his Prophet platform. The OB-6 was co-branded Tom Oberheim and Dave Smith Instruments.

===Oberheim brand returns===
In July 2019, Gibson CEO JC Curleigh returned the Oberheim trademark and IP to Tom Oberheim as &quot;a gesture of goodwill to the musical instrument industry.&quot;

In May 2022, the Oberheim OB-X8 was released, the first Oberheim-branded synthesizer in decades. As with the OB-6, the OB-X8, which offers features from all of Oberheim Electronics&#x27; classic OB-series polysynths-the OB-X, OB-Xa, OB-SX, and OB-8-in a single unit, was designed and built in collaboration with Sequential. In 2024, Oberheim released the Oberheim TEO-5, a polysynth with an all-new design.

===Legacy===
Marcus Ryle and Michel Doidic both worked for Oberheim as instrument designers, and went on to develop several notable products for Alesis, including the ADAT multitrack digital tape recorder, before founding Line 6 together.

<text>Maria van Riebeeck (née de la Queillerie; 28 October 1629 – 2 November 1664) was a French Huguenot who was the first wife of Jan van Riebeeck, the Dutch colonial administrator and first commander of the settlement at the Cape.

==Life==
She was the daughter of Abraham de la Queillerie (1589–1630) from Tournai, Belgium and Maria du Bois (born 1594 died unknown) from France. Her grandfather Chrétien de la Queillerie (1543-), a nobleman from the Boulogne-sur-Mer region, had also been a pastor in Armentières, then a military chaplain in the army of Guillaume d&#x27;Orange, then a pastor in the Pays- Bas, notably in Ghent, Leiden, Utrecht and Bergen-op-Zoom. They spoke French and Dutch in her family. She spent her childhood in Leiden.

She married Van Riebeeck on 28 March 1649 in Schiedam. The couple had eight children, of whom most died young. The couple arrived to the later Cape Town in South Africa in 1652.

The first period, they lived in a tent. Maria acted as the hostess to guests, is said to have entertained with a clavicord, and was described as diplomatically gifted in the company of foreigners. She was from 1658 active as a money lender to the colonists, and used a slave girl as an interpreter to communicate with the native population.

Little is known about the personality of Maria de la Queillerie, but in 1660–1661, the French priest Nicolas Étienne stayed ten months in Cape Town after a shipwreck; in a letter, he describes her as very pious (in Protestant faith of course), diplomatic and very intelligent.

She died in Dutch Malacca on 2 November 1664, aged 35, from smallpox.

==Legacy==
She has been referred to as the ancestral mother of the white Afrikaners. The South African Navy submarine, the &quot;SAS Maria van Riebeeck&quot;, was named in her memory.

A commemorative plaque of Maria van Riebeeck can be found in the ruins of Saint Paul&#x27;s Church in Malacca, replacing the original tombstone that was transported to Cape Town in 1915.

A statue of Maria van Riebeeck is located in a Cape Town square between Heerengracht Street and Adderley Street, next to that of her husband. It was offered in 1952 by the Dutch State for the commemorations of the 300th anniversary of the arrival of Jan van Riebeeck at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652. Having no certainty as to the appearance of Maria, the sculptor Dirk Wolbers used his own wife as a model. The statue was unveiled by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands on October 2, 1954. Queen Juliana was not present having told Prime Minister DF Malan that she would not travel to South Africa while apartheid, implemented from 1948, is said to be in force there. The statue was then placed in the garden of the National Art Museum in Cape Town.

<text>Hermine &quot;Miep&quot; Gies (; ; 15 February 1909 – 11 January 2010) was one of the Dutch citizens who hid Anne Frank, her family (Otto, Margot, Edith) and 4 other Dutch Jews (Fritz Pfeffer, Hermann van Pels, Auguste van Pels, Peter van Pels) from the Nazis in an annex above Otto Frank&#x27;s business premises during World War II. She was Austrian by birth, but in 1920, at the age of eleven, she was taken in as a foster child by a Dutch family in Leiden to whom she became very attached. Although she was only supposed to stay for six months, this stay was extended to one year because of frail health, after which Gies chose to remain with them, living the rest of her life in the Netherlands. 

In 1933, Gies began working for Otto Frank, a Jewish businessman who had moved with his family from Germany to the Netherlands in the hope of sparing his family from Nazi persecution. She became a close, trusted friend of the Frank family and was a great support to them during the twenty-five months they spent in hiding. Together with her colleague Bep Voskuijl, she retrieved Anne Frank&#x27;s diary after the family was arrested, and kept the papers safe until Otto Frank returned from Auschwitz in June 1945 and learned of his younger daughter&#x27;s death soon afterwards. Gies had stored Anne Frank&#x27;s papers in the hopes of returning them to the girl, but gave them to Otto Frank, who compiled them into a diary first published in June 1947.

In collaboration with Alison Leslie Gold, Gies wrote the book &quot;Anne Frank Remembered: The Story of the Woman Who Helped to Hide the Frank Family&quot; in 1987. She died in 2010 at age 100.

== Early life ==
Born in Vienna, Austria on 15 February 1909 to Karoline Maria Santrouschitz, She was sent to Leiden from Vienna in December 1920 to escape the food shortages prevailing in Austria after World War I. The Nieuwenburgs, a working-class family who already had five children of their own, took her as their foster daughter, and called her by the diminutive &quot;Miep&quot; by which she became known. In 1922, she moved with her foster family to Gaaspstraat 25 in Amsterdam. Gies was an honors student, and described herself as &quot;reserved and very independent&quot;; after graduating high school, she worked as an accountant and then in 1933 as a secretary with the Dutch branch of the German spice firm Opekta. Gies wrote, &quot;But the office was not the only thing in my life. My social life at this time was very lively. I loved to dance and belonged like many young Dutch girls, to a dance club.&quot;

Otto Frank had just relocated from Germany and had been appointed managing director of Opekta&#x27;s recently expanded Dutch operations. Gies, Frank&#x27;s employee, became a close friend of the family, as did her fiancé, Jan Gies. After refusing to join a Nazi women&#x27;s association, her passport was invalidated, and she was ordered to be deported back to Austria within 90 days (by then annexed by Germany, which classified her as a German citizen). The couple faced some difficulties, but they were married on 16 July 1941 so that she could obtain Dutch citizenship and thus evade deportation. &quot;Anne was impressed with my gold ring. She looked at it dreamily. (...) Because times were hard, we had only one ring, although the custom was for a couple to have two. Henk [In her book, Miep called Jan by the name of Henk, because Anne Frank had used that pseudonym in her diary] and I had barely scraped together enough money for one gold ring. He had insisted that I should wear it.&quot; Gies&#x27;s fluency in Dutch and German helped the Frank family assimilate into Dutch society, and she and her husband became regular guests at the Franks&#x27; home.

==Hiding the families==
With her husband Jan and other Opekta employees (Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman and Bep Voskuijl), Miep Gies helped hide Otto and Edith Frank; their daughters Margot and Anne; Hermann, Auguste and Peter van Pels; and Fritz Pfeffer in several upstairs rooms in the company&#x27;s office building on Amsterdam&#x27;s Prinsengracht from 6 July 1942 to 4 August 1944. In an interview, Gies said she was glad to help the families hide because she was extremely concerned after seeing what was happening to the Jews in Amsterdam. Every day, she saw trucks loaded with Jews heading to the railway station, en route to Nazi concentration camps. She did not tell anyone, including her foster parents, about the people in hiding whom she was assisting.

When purchasing food for the people in hiding, Gies avoided suspicion in many ways: for example, by visiting several different suppliers in a day. She never carried more than what one shopping bag could hold or what she could hide under her coat. To prevent the Opekta workers from becoming suspicious, Gies tried not to enter the hiding place during office hours. Her husband also helped by providing ration cards that he had obtained illegally. By visiting various grocery shops and markets on a regular basis, Gies developed a good sense of the supply situation.

At their apartment, close to the Merwedeplein where the Franks had lived before going into hiding, Gies and her husband Jan (who belonged to the Dutch resistance) also hid an anti-Nazi university student.

===The capture===
On the morning of 4 August 1944, sitting at her desk, Gies, along with Voskuijl and Kleiman, was confronted by a man with a gun commanding &quot;Stay put! Don&#x27;t move! Not a sound!&quot; The families had been betrayed and the Grüne Polizei arrested the people hidden at 263 Prinsengracht, as well as Kugler and Kleiman. The next day, Gies went to the German police office to try to find the arrestees. She offered money to buy their freedom but did not succeed. Gies and the other helpers could have been executed if they had been caught hiding Jews; however, she was not arrested because the police officer who came to interrogate her was from Vienna, her birth town. She recognized his accent and told him they had the same hometown. He was amazed, then started pacing and cursing at her, finally deciding to let her stay. Gies remained safe with her husband in Amsterdam throughout the rest of the war.

Before the hiding place was emptied by the authorities, Gies and the younger secretary Bep Voskuijl retrieved parts of Anne Frank&#x27;s diaries and saved them in their desk drawer. Gies was determined to give them back to Anne. After the war had ended and it was confirmed that Anne Frank had perished in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, Gies gave the collection of papers and notebooks to the sole survivor from the Secret Annex, Otto Frank. After transcribing sections for his family, Frank was persuaded of the value of Anne’s account of their ordeal and arranged for the book&#x27;s publication in 1947. Gies did not read the diaries before turning them over to Otto and later remarked that if she had, she would have had to destroy them because the papers contained the names of all five of the helpers as well as of their black-market suppliers. She was persuaded by Otto Frank to read the diary in its second printing. In 1947, Miep and Jan Gies moved to Jekerstraat 65, by the , along with Otto Frank.

Miep Gies had assured Anne Frank&#x27;s biographer Melissa Müller repeatedly that she did not think the main suspect, Willem van Maaren, was the culprit in the betrayal.

==Honors and awards==

Miep and Jan Gies were recognised as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem on 8 March 1972.

In 1994, Gies was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany as well as the Wallenberg Medal by the University of Michigan. In 1997, she was knighted in the Order of Orange-Nassau by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. The minor planet 99949 Miep Gies is named in her honor. She always maintained that while she appreciated the honors, they embarrassed her: &quot;I am not a hero. I am not a special person. I don&#x27;t want attention. I did what any decent person would have done.&quot;

On 30 July 2009, the Austrian Ambassador to the Netherlands, Wolfgang Paul, presented the Grand Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria to Gies at her home.

==Death and legacy==
On 11 January 2010, Gies died, aged 100, in the city of Hoorn after suffering injuries from a fall.

Gies was interviewed about her memories of hiding the Frank family for the 1995 documentary film &quot;Anne Frank Remembered&quot; by Jon Blair. Miep Gies&#x27; story was adapted into a 2023 miniseries, &quot;A Small Light,&quot; with Bel Powley as Gies.

<doc id="471052" wikidata="Q5593882" url="?curid=471052" title="Grammy Award for Best Soul Gospel Performance, Male or Female">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Soul Gospel Performance, Male or Female was an award presented at the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards in 1990 for quality soul gospel performances. The Grammy Awards, an annual ceremony that was established in 1958, and originally called the Gramophone Awards, are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to: &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Prior to the Grammy Award for Best Soul Gospel Performance, Male or Female, there were two categories separated by gender (Best Soul Gospel Performance, Female and Best Soul Gospel Performance, Male), both of which were first presented in 1984. The first gender-neutral award was presented to Al Green in 1990 for his performance of &quot;As Long as We&#x27;re Together&quot;. In 1991, another category restructure resulted in the soul gospel categories being divided into awards for Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album and Best Traditional Gospel Album, both of which lasted until the 53rd Grammy Awards in 2011.

==Background==
Prior to the category Best Soul Gospel Performance, Male or Female there were two categories separated by gender: Best Soul Gospel Performance, Female and Best Soul Gospel Performance, Male. Both awards were presented from 1984 to 1989. The first gender-neutral award was presented in 1990. In 1991, another category restructure resulted in the soul gospel categories being divided into awards for Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album and Best Traditional Gospel Album (previously known as Best Soul Gospel Performance, Contemporary and Best Soul Gospel Performance, Traditional from 1978 to 1983), both of which lasted until the 53rd Grammy Awards in 2011.

== Recipients ==

Nominees for Best Soul Gospel Performance, Male or Female included: Al Green for &quot;As Long as We&#x27;re Together&quot;, Albertina Walker for &quot;My Time Is Not Over&quot;, Beau Williams for &quot;Wonderful&quot;, Daniel Winans for &quot;You Got a Choice to Make&quot;, and Vickie Winans for &quot;Total Victory&quot;. The &quot;new jack swing remix&quot; of &quot;As Long as We&#x27;re Together&quot; was done by Al B. Sure! and Kyle West and appeared on Green&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;I Get Joy&quot;, which reached peak positions of number 60 and number 13 on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazines&#x27; R&amp;B Albums and Top Gospel Albums charts, respectively. Allmusic&#x27;s Jason Elias criticized the remix for having &quot;too much hardware&quot;. &quot;My Time Is Not Over&quot;, recorded in Tennessee, contained 1960&#x27;s soul music &quot;propelled by a choir&#x27;s call-and-response&quot; and reached number 33 on the Top Gospel Albums chart. &quot;Wonderful&quot; reached number 22 and number 2 on &quot;Billboards&quot;&#x27; Top Contemporary Christian and Top Gospel Albums charts, respectively, and earned Williams a Gospel Music Association (GMA) Dove Award for Best Traditional Black Gospel Recorded Song of the Year. Daniel Winans, a member of the Winans family, was also nominated for, and won, the Grammy Award for Best Soul Gospel Performance by a Duo or Group, Choir or Chorus for &quot;Let Brotherly Love Continue&quot;. &quot;Total Victory&quot; also charted on the Top Contemporary Christian and Top Gospel Albums charts, reaching peak positions of number 31 and number 7, respectively.

The award was presented to Green, who has received a total of eleven Grammy awards during his lifetime. In 1982, Green was presented the award for Best Soul Gospel Performance, Traditional for &quot;The Lord Will Make a Way&quot;, followed by awards for Best Soul Gospel Performance, Contemporary and Best Soul Gospel Performance, Traditional in 1983 for &quot;Higher Plane&quot; and &quot;Precious Lord&quot;, respectively. Green earned three awards for Best Soul Gospel Performance, Male: the first in 1984 for &quot;I&#x27;ll Rise Again&quot;, another in 1987 for &quot;Going Away&quot; (from the album &quot;He Is the Light&quot;), and a third in 1988 for &quot;Everything&#x27;s Gonna Be Alright&quot; (from the album &quot;Soul Survivor&quot;). The song &quot;Sailin&#x27; on the Sea of Your Love&quot; earned Shirley Caesar and Green the award for Best Soul Gospel Performance by a Duo or Group, Choir or Chorus in 1985. Green has earned three Grammy awards since his 1990 recognition for &quot;As Long as We&#x27;re Together&quot;; in 1995 he and Lyle Lovett earned the first Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for &quot;Funny How Time Slips Away&quot;, and in 2009 he was presented awards for Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance for &quot;You&#x27;ve Got the Love I Need&quot; and Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for &quot;Stay with Me (By the Sea)&quot;. Of the other Best Soul Gospel Performance nominees for 1990, only Walker eventually earned a Grammy award (Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album in 1995 for &quot;Songs of the Church: Live in Memphis&quot;).

<doc id="471056" wikidata="Q4952581" url="?curid=471056" title="Boynton v. Virginia">
<text>Boynton v. Virginia, 364 U.S. 454 (1960), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court. The case overturned a judgment convicting an African American law student for trespassing by being in a restaurant in a bus terminal which was &quot;whites only&quot;. It held that racial segregation in public transportation was illegal because such segregation violated the Interstate Commerce Act, which broadly forbade discrimination in interstate passenger transportation. It moreover held that bus transportation was sufficiently related to interstate commerce to allow the United States federal government to regulate it to forbid racial discrimination in the industry.

Thurgood Marshall argued the case for Boynton. The majority opinion was written by Justice Hugo Black.

The significance of &quot;Boynton&quot; was not located in its holding since it managed to avoid deciding any Constitutional questions in its decision, and its expansive reading of Federal powers regarding interstate commerce was also well established by the time of the decision. Its significance is that its outlawing of racial segregation in public transportation led directly to a movement called the Freedom Rides, in which African Americans and whites together rode various forms of public transportation in the South to challenge local laws or customs that enforced segregation. The Freedom Rides, and the violent reactions they provoked, prompted Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to confront the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) with its failure to enforce a bus desegregation ruling it had handed down in 1955, &quot;Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company&quot;, 64 MCC 769 (1955) as well as the companion train desegregation case, &quot;NAACP v. St. Louis-Santa Fe Railway Company&quot;, 297 ICC 335 (1955). By presenting the commission with its own rulings in a May 29, 1961, petition, Kennedy was able to prompt it to do what it had promised in 1955, five years before the &quot;Boynton&quot; ruling was handed down, and six years before the Freedom Riders set out to test &quot;Boynton&quot; across the Deep South. On September 22, 1961, the ICC issued regulations which implemented its 1955 &quot;Keys&quot; and &quot;NAACP&quot; rulings, as well as the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Boynton&quot;, and on November 1 those regulations went into effect, effectively ending Jim Crow in public transportation.

==Boynton&#x27;s trip and arrest==

In the winter of 1958, Bruce Boynton was a student at Howard University School of Law in Washington, D.C. While travelling on a Trailways bus for a holiday trip to his home in Selma, Alabama, his bus arrived at the Trailways station on East Broad Street in Richmond, Virginia. Passengers disembarked for a 40-minute layover. Unlike other black passengers, Boynton went into a &quot;whites only&quot; restaurant, where he ordered a cheeseburger and a cup of hot tea. He never had problems in Northern states, but he grew up in Selma and was familiar with segregation of restaurants and movie theaters. It was not his intent to test any laws in the South that night.

Ordered to move to the &quot;black&quot; section and knowing that his arrest was likely, Boynton pointed out to authorities that he was an American citizen with federal rights and, thus, was entitled to his burger and tea. Handcuffed and arrested on a misdemeanor trespass charge, he spent the night in jail and was fined $10 in a Richmond municipal court.

== Boynton in the Virginia courts ==
In the Richmond Police Court, Boynton was convicted of violating a state statute making it a misdemeanor for any person &quot;without authority of law&quot; to remain upon the premises of another after having been forbidden to do so. His conviction was sustained in Richmond&#x27;s Hustings Court.

On appeal, he contended that his conviction violated the Interstate Commerce Act and the Equal Protection, Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the Federal Constitution; but his conviction was sustained by the Supreme Court of Virginia.

== Boynton&#x27;s Federal appeal ==
Future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall argued Boynton&#x27;s case on appeal in the Federal Courts. On petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court, he raised only the constitutional questions.

One of the pioneers of Indo-Anglian fiction, he, together with R. K. Narayan, Ahmad Ali and Raja Rao, was one of the first India-based writers in English to gain an International readership. Anand is admired for his novels and short stories, which have acquired the status of classics of modern Indian English literature; they are noted for their perceptive insight into the lives of the oppressed and for their analysis of impoverishment, exploitation and misfortune. He became known for his protest novel &quot;Untouchable&quot; (1935), which was followed by other works on the Indian poor such as &quot;Coolie&quot; (1936) and &quot;Two Leaves and a Bud&quot; (1937). He is also noted for being among the first writers to incorporate Punjabi and Hindustani idioms into English, and was a recipient of the civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan, the third-highest civilian award in the Republic of India.

== Early life and education ==

Mulk Raj Anand was born in a Hindu Khatri family in Peshawar. Anand studied at Khalsa College, Amritsar, graduating with honours in 1924 before moving to England. While working in a restaurant to support himself, he attended University College London as an undergraduate and later studied at Cambridge University, earning a Ph.D. in philosophy in 1929 with a dissertation on Bertrand Russell and the English empiricists. During this time he forged friendships with members of the Bloomsbury Group. He also spent time in Geneva, lecturing at the League of Nations&#x27; International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation.

Anand married English actress and communist Kathleen Van Gelder in 1938; they had a daughter, Susheela, before divorcing in 1948.

== Career ==
Mulk Raj Anand&#x27;s literary career was launched by a family tragedy arising from the rigidity of India&#x27;s caste system. His first prose essay was a response to the suicide of an aunt excommunicated by her family for sharing a meal with a Muslim woman. His first novel, &quot;Untouchable&quot;, published in 1935, is a chilling exposé of the lives of India&#x27;s untouchable caste which were neglected at that time. The novel follows a single day in the life of Bakha, a toilet-cleaner, who accidentally bumps into a member of a higher caste, triggering a series of humiliations. Bakha searches for salve to the tragedy of the destiny into which he was born, talking with a Christian missionary, listening to a speech about untouchability by Mahatma Gandhi and a subsequent conversation between two educated Indians, but by the end of the book Anand suggests that it is technology, in the form of the newly introduced flush toilet, that may be his savior by eliminating the need for a caste of toilet cleaners.

&quot;Untouchable&quot;, which captures the vernacular inventiveness of the Punjabi and Hindi idiom in English, was widely acclaimed, and won Anand his reputation as India&#x27;s Charles Dickens. The novel&#x27;s introduction was written by his friend E. M. Forster, whom he met while working on T. S. Eliot&#x27;s magazine &quot;Criterion&quot;. Forster writes: &quot;Avoiding rhetoric and circumlocution, it has gone straight to the heart of its subject and purified it.&quot;

Dividing his time between London and India during the 1930s and &#x27;40s, Anand was active in the Indian independence movement. While in London, he wrote propaganda on behalf of the Indian cause alongside India&#x27;s future Defence Minister V. K. Krishna Menon, while trying to make a living as a novelist and journalist. At the same time, he supported Left causes elsewhere around the globe, traveling to Spain to volunteer in the Spanish Civil War, although his role in the conflict was more journalistic than military. He spent World War II working as a scriptwriter for the BBC in London, where he became a friend of George Orwell. Orwell&#x27;s review of Anand&#x27;s 1942 novel &quot;The Sword and the Sickle&quot; hints at the significance of its publication: &quot;Although Mr. Anand&#x27;s novel would still be interesting on its own merits if it had been written by an Englishman, it is impossible to read it without remembering every few pages that it is also a cultural curiosity. The growth of an English-language Indian literature is a strange phenomenon, and it will have its effect on the post-war world&quot;. He was also a friend of Picasso and had paintings by Picasso in his personal art collection.

Anand returned to India in 1947 and continued his prodigious literary output here. His work includes poetry and essays on a wide range of subjects, as well as autobiographies, novels and short stories. Prominent among his novels are &quot;The Village&quot; (1939), &quot;Across the Black Waters&quot; (1939), &quot;The Sword and the Sickle&quot; (1942), all written in England; &quot;Coolie&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Private Life of an Indian Prince&quot; (1953) are perhaps the most important of his works written in India. He also founded a literary magazine, &quot;Marg&quot;, and taught in various universities. During the 1970s, he worked with the International Progress Organization (IPO) on the issue of cultural self-awareness among nations. His contribution to the conference of the IPO in Innsbruck (Austria) in 1974 had a special influence on debates that later became known under the heading of the &quot;Dialogue among Civilisations&quot;. Anand also delivered a series of lectures on eminent Indians, including Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Rabindranath Tagore, commemorating their achievements and significance and paying special attention to their distinct brands of humanism.

His 1953 novel &quot;The Private Life of an Indian Prince&quot; is autobiographical in the manner of the rest of his subsequent oeuvre. In 1950 Anand embarked on a project to write a seven-part autobiographical novel titled &quot;Seven Ages of Man&quot;, of which he was only able to complete four parts beginning in 1951 with &quot;Seven Summers&quot;, followed by &quot;Morning Face&quot; (1968), &quot;Confession of a Lover&quot; (1976) and &quot; The Bubble&quot; (1984). Like much of his later work, it contains elements of his spiritual journey as he struggles to attain a higher degree of self-awareness. His 1964 novel &quot;Death of a Hero&quot; was based on the life of Maqbool Sherwani. It was adapted as &quot;Maqbool Ki Vaapsi&quot; on DD Kashir.

Anand was associated with the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Eastern Service&quot; radio station in the 1940s where he broadcast literary programmes including book reviews, author biographies, and interviews with authors like Inez Holden. In a multi-part broadcast programme that he hosted, he discussed poetry and literary criticism, often calling for working class narratives in fiction.

== Political orientation ==
Anand was a lifelong socialist. His novels attack various aspects of India&#x27;s social structure as well as the legacy of British rule in India; they are considered important social statements as well as literary artefacts. Anand himself was steadfast in his belief that politics and literature remained inextricable from one another. He was a founding member of the Progressive Writers&#x27; Association and also he helped in drafting the &quot;manifesto&quot; of the association.

== Later life ==

Anand married Shirin Vajifdar, a Parsi classical dancer from Bombay in 1950. He died of pneumonia in Pune on 28 September 2004 at the age 98.

<doc id="471065" wikidata="Q1739190" url="?curid=471065" title="Alex Carlile, Baron Carlile of Berriew">
<text>Alexander Charles Carlile, Baron Carlile of Berriew, (born 12 February 1948) is a British barrister and crossbench member of the House of Lords. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Montgomeryshire from 1983 to 1997.

==Early life and career==
Alex Carlile, the son of Polish Jewish immigrants, was born in Ruabon, Wrexham, Wales and brought up in Lancashire. He was educated at Epsom College and at King&#x27;s College London where he graduated in law in 1969. He was called to the Bar by Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1970 and became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC) at the early age of 36.

Lord Carlile of Berriew is a company director and barrister, and former head of chambers of Foundry Chambers, London, a set of barristers&#x27; chambers. He defended Diana, Princess of Wales&#x27;s butler, Paul Burrell, against charges that Burrell had stolen some of her estate&#x27;s belongings. In 2001 he was appointed the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. Carlile stood down as head of chambers at 9–12 Bell Yard in March 2008.

Carlile was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to national security law.

==Political career==
Carlile stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal for East Flintshire at the general elections of February and October 1974. At the 1983 election, standing as a Liberal Democrat, he became the Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire and held the seat until 1997; he also became the leader of his party in Wales. On 27 July 1999, he was created a life peer as Baron Carlile of Berriew, &quot;of Berriew in the County of Powys&quot;. 

Carlile sat as a Liberal Democrat peer until 2016, when he left the party, stating that he found himself &quot;at odds&quot; with its policies on many matters, including national security issues. It was reported that civil liberties, especially the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, were at the core of the disagreement.

According to the Register of Lords&#x27; Interests, Lord Carlile of Berriew was at various times a director of 5 Bell Yard Ltd and the Wynnstay Group of agricultural feed manufacturers, agricultural goods merchants and fuel oil distributors; a deputy High Court judge; and a chairman of the Competition Appeals Tribunal. He was president of the Howard League for Penal Reform in 2006–9.

He is an Honorary Professor in the Universities of St Andrews and Swansea, and a Fellow of King&#x27;s College London. He is a Honorary Doctor of Laws in the Universities of Swansea, South Wales, Chester, Manchester Metropolitan, and the Hungarian Institute of Criminology.

Carlile is a co-director and co-owner of a strategy and political risks consultancy, SC Strategy Limited with Sir John Scarlett, the former chief of MI6 and William Jessett CBE (former Director of Strategy at UK Ministry of Defence.

In 2014 Carlile mounted a legal challenge to the UK travel ban on Maryam Rajavi, leader of the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran (MeK) and president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran. The Supreme Court decided in favour of the UK government.

In 2016 Carlile sat on the founding committee of National Opposition to Windfarms, and sponsored the launch event at the Houses of Parliament.

==Penal reform==

From 2006 to 2013, Carlile was President of the Howard League for Penal Reform.

In 2006 he was chairman of the Carlile Inquiry into the use of force on children in custody. In 2011, Lord Carlile held a follow-up hearing in the House of Lords. He put together an expert panel who gave both written and oral evidence.

==Legislation==
Carlile was the first Member of Parliament to campaign for the rights of transgender people.

Lord Carlile acted from 2001 to 2011 as the UK&#x27;s Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation. He was succeeded by David Anderson QC. The Director of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, called Carlile&#x27;s support for control orders &quot;disappointing&quot; in a February 2006 press release condemning the introduction of control orders by the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. In 2015, he joined with a cross-party group of peers to reintroduce the Draft Communications Data Bill, known by its opponents as the &quot;Snoopers&#x27; Charter&quot;. He was an independent reviewer on the 2015 Assessment on Paramilitary Groups in Northern Ireland.

He was vocal in his opposition to the UK coalition government&#x27;s Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill, proposing many amendments. He was one of five Lords who vehemently opposed the introduction of means testing for police advice (to cover the cost of lawyers consulting suspects in police stations). &quot;A single moment of reflection leaves one open-mouthed at the absurdity of this proposal&quot;, he said.

He was initially appointed to lead the independent review of the UK government&#x27;s Prevent programme but resigned after a legal challenge was mounted against his appointment.

==Personal life==
He lists his recreations as politics, theatre, food and football, and is a member of the Athenaeum Club. He is a lifelong supporter of English football club Burnley FC. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, Patron of The Security Institute, and Patron (previously Chairman) of the Chartered Security Professionals Registration Authority. He has three children by his first wife Frances and nine grandchildren. He married his second wife, Alison Levitt KC, in December 2007. She was herself a barrister, until her appointment as a Circuit Judge. She was created a life peer as Baroness Levitt in 2025.

Carlile is a Bencher of Gray&#x27;s Inn.

On 11 July 2018, Carlile (after being granted a visa) was refused entry to India at Indira Gandhi International Airport where he was due to address a press conference in defence of jailed Bangladeshi politician Khaleda Zia and meet a human rights body. India&#x27;s foreign ministry said his &quot;intended activity in India was incompatible with the purpose of his visit as mentioned in his visa application&quot;, though media reported the decision to refuse him entry was a political one to protect India–Bangladesh relations.

<doc id="471067" wikidata="Q3057606" url="?curid=471067" title="History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty">
<text>The [[history of modern Egypt|history of Egypt]] under the [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] dynasty (1805–1953) spanned the later period of Ottoman Egypt, the Khedivate of Egypt under British occupation, and the nominally independent Sultanate of Egypt and Kingdom of Egypt, ending with the Revolution of 1952 and the formation of the Republic of Egypt.

==Muhammad Ali&#x27;s rise to power==

The process of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s seizure of power was a long three way civil war between the Ottoman Turks, Egyptian Mamluks, and Albanian mercenaries along with Egyptians loyal to Muhammad Ali. It lasted from 1803 to 1807 with the Muhammad Ali Pasha taking control of Egypt in 1805, when the Ottoman Sultan acknowledged his position. Thereafter, Muhammad Ali was the undisputed ruler of Egypt, and his efforts henceforth were directed primarily to the maintenance of his practical independence.

==Egypt under Muhammad Ali==

===Campaign against the Saudis===
The Ottoman-Saudi war in 1811–18 was fought between Egypt under the reign of Muhammad Ali (nominally under Ottoman rule) and the Wahabbis of Najd who had conquered Hejaz from the Ottomans.

When Wahabis captured Mecca in 1802, the Ottoman sultan ordered Muhammad Ali of Egypt to start moving against Wahabbis to re-conquer Mecca and return the honour of the Ottoman Empire.

====First Arabian campaign====

Acknowledging the sovereignty of the Ottoman Sultan, and at the commands of the Ottoman Porte, in 1811 Muhammad Ali dispatched an army of 20,000 men (and 2,000 horses) under the command of his son Tusun, a youth of sixteen, against the Saudis in the Ottoman–Saudi War. After a successful advance this force met with a serious repulse at the Battle of Al-Safra, and retreated to Yanbu. In the end of the year Tusun, having received reinforcements, again assumed the offensive and captured Medina after a prolonged siege. He next took Jeddah and Mecca, defeating the Saudi beyond the latter and capturing their general.

But some mishaps followed, and Muhammad Ali, who had determined to conduct the war in person, left Egypt in the summer of 1813—leaving his other son Ibrahim in charge of the country. He encountered serious obstacles in Arabia, predominantly stemming from the nature of the country and the harassing mode of warfare adopted by his adversaries, but on the whole his forces proved superior to those of the enemy. He deposed and exiled the Sharif of Mecca and after the death of the Saudi leader Saud he concluded a treaty with Saud&#x27;s son and successor, Abdullah I in 1815.

Following reports that the Turks, whose cause he was upholding in Arabia, were treacherously planning an invasion of Egypt, and hearing of the escape of Napoleon from Elba and fearing danger to Egypt from France or Britain, Muhammad Ali returned to Cairo by way of Kosseir and Kena, reaching the capital on the day of the Battle of Waterloo.

====Second Arabian campaign====
Tusun returned to Egypt on hearing of the military revolt at Cairo, but died in 1816 at the early age of twenty. Muhammad Ali, dissatisfied with the treaty concluded with the Saudis, and with the non-fulfillment of certain of its clauses, determined to send another army to Arabia, and to include in it the soldiers who had recently proved unruly.

This expedition, under his eldest son Ibrahim Pasha, left in the autumn of 1816. The war was long and arduous but in 1818 Ibrahim captured the Saudi capital of Diriyah. Abdullah I, their chief, was made prisoner and with his treasurer and secretary was sent to Istanbul (in some references he was sent to Cairo), where, in spite of Ibrahim&#x27;s promise of safety and of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s intercession in their favor, they were put to death. At the close of the year 1819 Ibrahim returned having subdued all opposition in Arabia.

===Reforms===
While the process had begun in 1808, Muhammad Ali&#x27;s representative at Cairo had completed the confiscation of almost all the lands belonging to private individuals, while he was absent in Arabia (1813–15). The former owners were forced to accept inadequate pensions instead. By this revolutionary method of land nationalization Muhammad Ali became proprietor of nearly all the soil of Egypt.

During Ibrahim&#x27;s engagement in the second Arabian campaign, the pasha turned his attention to further strengthening the Egyptian economy, and his control over it. He created state monopolies for the chief products of the country, and created a number of factories. In 1819 he began digging the new Mahmoudiyah Canal to Alexandria, named after the reigning Sultan of Turkey. The old canal had long fallen into decay, and the necessity of providing a safe channel between Alexandria and the Nile was much felt. The conclusion of the commercial Treaty of Balta Liman in 1838 between Turkey and Britain, negotiated by Sir Henry Bulwer (Lord Dalling), struck the death knell to the system of monopolies, though its application regarding Egypt was delayed for some years, and finally included foreign intervention.

Another notable addition to the economic progress of the country was the development of cotton cultivation in the Nile Delta starting in 1822. The cotton seed for the new crop had been brought from the Sudan by Maho Bey, and with the organization of the new irrigation and industry, Muhammad Ali was able to extract considerable revenue in a few years time.

Other domestic efforts were made to promote education and the study of medicine. Muhammad Ali showed much favor, to European merchants, on whom he was dependent for the sale of his monopoly exports, and under his influence the port of Alexandria again rose into importance. It was also under Muhammad Ali&#x27;s encouragement that the overland transit of goods from Europe to India via Egypt was resumed.

The Pasha also attempted to reorganize his troops along European lines, but this led to a formidable mutiny in Cairo. Muhammad Ali&#x27;s life was endangered, and he sought refuge by night in the citadel, while the soldiers committed many acts of plunder. The effects of the revolt were reduced by gifts to the insurgent&#x27;s leaders; Muhammad Ali also ordered that those who suffered from the disturbances should receive compensation from the state treasury. The conscription portion of the Nizam-ı Cedid (New System) was temporarily abandoned, as consequence of this mutiny.

====Economy====
Egypt under Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century had the fifth most productive cotton industry in the world, in terms of the number of spindles per capita. The industry was initially driven by machinery that relied on traditional energy sources, such as animal power, water wheels, and windmills, which were also the principle energy sources in Western Europe up until around 1870. While steam power had been experimented with in Ottoman Egypt by engineer Taqi ad-Din Muhammad ibn Ma&#x27;ruf in 1551, when he invented a steam jack driven by a rudimentary steam turbine, it was under Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century that steam engines were introduced to Egyptian industrial manufacturing. While there was a lack of coal deposits in Egypt, prospectors searched for coal deposits there, and manufactured boilers which were installed in Egyptian industries such as ironworks, textile manufacturing, paper mills and hulling mills. Coal was also imported from overseas, at similar prices to what imported coal cost in France, until the 1830s, when Egypt gained access to coal sources in Lebanon, which had a yearly coal output of 4,000 tons. Compared to Western Europe, Egypt also had superior agriculture and an efficient transport network through the Nile. Economic historian Jean Batou argues that the necessary economic conditions for rapid industrialization existed in Egypt during the 1820s–1830s, as well as for the adoption of oil as a potential energy source for its steam engines later in the 19th century.

===Invasion of Libya and Sudan===
In 1820 Muhammad Ali gave orders to commence the conquest of eastern Libya. He first sent an expedition westward (Feb. 1820) which conquered and annexed the Siwa oasis. Ali&#x27;s intentions for Sudan was to extend his rule southward, to capture the valuable caravan trade bound for the Red Sea, and to secure the rich gold mines which he believed to exist in Sennar. He also saw in the campaign a means of getting rid of his disaffected troops, and of obtaining a sufficient number of captives to form the nucleus of the new army.

The forces destined for this service were led by Ismail, his youngest son. They consisted of between 4000 and 5000 men, being Turks and Arabs. They left Cairo in July 1820. Nubia at once submitted, the Shaigiya tribe immediately beyond the province of Dongola were defeated, the remnant of the Mamluks dispersed, and Sennar was reduced without a battle.

Mahommed Bey, the defterdar, with another force of about the same strength, was then sent by Muhammad Ali against Kordofan with like result, but not without a hard-fought engagement. In October 1822, Ismail, with his retinue, was burnt to death by Nimr, the mek (king) of Shendi; following this incident the defterdar, a man infamous for his cruelty, assumed the command of those provinces, and exacted terrible retribution from the inhabitants. Khartoum was founded at this time, and in the following years the rule of the Egyptians was greatly extended and control of the Red Sea ports of Suakin and Massawa obtained.

===Ahmad Revolt===
In 1824 a native rebellion broke out in Upper Egypt headed by one Ahmad, an inhabitant of al-Salimiyyah, a village situated a few miles above Thebes. He proclaimed himself a prophet, and was soon followed by between 20,000 and 30,000 insurgents, mostly peasants, but some of them deserters from the Nizam Gedid, for that force was yet in a half-organized state.

The peasants were angered by many of Ali&#x27;s reforms, especially the introduction of conscription and the increase in taxes and forced labour.

The insurrection was crushed by Muhammad Ali, and about one fourth of Ahmad&#x27;s followers perished, but he himself escaped and was never heard of again. Few of these unfortunates possessed any other weapon than the long staff (&quot;nabbut&quot;) of the Egyptian peasant; still they offered an obstinate resistance, and the combat in which they were defeated resembled a massacre. This movement was the last internal attempt to destroy the pasha&#x27;s authority.

The subsequent years saw an imposition of order across Egypt and Ali&#x27;s new highly trained and disciplined forces spread across the nation. Public order was rendered perfect; the Nile and the highways were secure to all travelers, Christian or Muslim; the Bedouin tribes were won over to peaceful pursuits.

===Greek campaign===

Muhammad Ali was fully conscious that the empire which he had so laboriously built up might at any time have to be defended by force of arms against his master Sultan Mahmud II, whose whole policy had been directed to curbing the power of his too ambitious vassals, and who was under the influence of the personal enemies of the pasha of Egypt, notably of Hüsrev Pasha, the Grand Vizier, who had never forgiven his humiliation in Egypt in 1803.

Mahmud also was already planning reforms borrowed from the West, and Muhammad Ali, who had plenty of opportunity of observing the superiority of European methods of warfare, was determined to anticipate the sultan in the creation of a fleet and an army on European lines, partly as a measure of precaution, partly as an instrument for the realization of yet wider schemes of ambition. Before the outbreak of the War of Greek Independence in 1821, he had already expended much time and energy in organizing a fleet and in training, under the supervision of French instructors, native officers and artificers; though it was not till 1829 that the opening of a dockyard and arsenal at Alexandria enabled him to build and equip his own vessels. By 1823, moreover, he had succeeded in carrying out the reorganization of his army on European lines, the turbulent Turkish and Albanian elements being replaced by Sudanese and &quot;fellahin&quot;. The effectiveness of the new force was demonstrated in the suppression of an 1823 revolt of the Albanians in Cairo by six disciplined Sudanese regiments; after which Mehemet Ali was no more troubled with military mutinies.

His foresight was rewarded by the invitation of the sultan to help him in the task of subduing the Greek insurgents, offering as reward the pashaliks of the Morea and of Syria. Mehemet Ali had already, in 1821, been appointed by him governor of Crete, which he had occupied with a small Egyptian force. In the autumn of 1824 a fleet of 60 Egyptian warships carrying a large force of 17,000 disciplined troops concentrated in Suda Bay, and, in the following March, with Ibrahin as commander-in-chief landed in the Morea.

His naval superiority wrested from the Greeks the command of a great deal of the sea, on which the fate of the insurrection ultimately depended, while on land the Greek irregular bands, having largely soundly beaten the Porte&#x27;s troops, had finally met a worthy foe in Ibrahim&#x27;s disciplined troops. The history of the events that led up to the battle of Navarino and the liberation of Greece is told elsewhere; the withdrawal of the Egyptians from the Morea was ultimately due to the action of Admiral Sir Edward Codrington, who early in August 1828 appeared before Alexandria and induced the pasha, by no means sorry to have a reasonable excuse, by a threat of bombardment, to sign a convention undertaking to recall Ibrahim and his army.

===War with the Sultan===

Ali went to war against the sultan on in order to obtain raw materials lacking in Egypt (especially timber for his navy) and a captive market for Egypt&#x27;s new industrial output. From fall 1831 to December 1832 Ibrahim led the Egyptian army through Lebanon and Syria and across the Taurus Mountains into Anatolia where he defeated the Ottoman forces and pushed on to Kutahya, only 150 miles from Istanbul.

For the next ten years relations between the Sultan and the Pasha remained in the forefront of the questions which agitated the diplomatic world. It was not only the very existence of the Ottoman empire that seemed to be at stake, but Egypt itself had become more than ever the object of international attention, to British statesmen especially, and in the issue of the struggle were involved the interests of Britain in the two routes to India by the Isthmus of Suez and the valley of the Euphrates. Ibrahim, who once more commanded in his father&#x27;s name, launched another brilliant campaign beginning with the storming of Acre on May 27, 1832, and culminating in the rout and capture of Reshid Pasha at Konya on December 21.

Soon after he was blocked by the intervention of Russia, however. As the result of endless discussions between the representatives of the powers, the Porte and the pasha, the Convention of Kütahya was signed on May 14, 1833, by which the sultan agreed to bestow on Muhammad Ali the pashaliks of Syria, Damascus, Aleppo and Itcheli, together with the district of Adana. The announcement of the pasha&#x27;s appointment had already been made in the usual way in the annual &quot;firman&quot; issued on May 3. Adana was bestowed on Ibrahim under the style of muhassil, or collector of the crown revenues, a few days later.

Muhammad Ali now ruled over a virtually independent empire, stretching from the Sudan to the Taurus Mountains, subject only to a moderate annual tribute. However the unsound foundations of his authority were not long in revealing themselves. Scarcely a year from the signing of the Convention of Kutaya the application by Ibrahim of Egyptian methods of government, notably of the monopolies and conscription, had driven Syrians, Druze and Arabs, into revolt, after first welcoming him as a deliverer. The unrest was suppressed by Muhammad Ali in person, and the Syrians were terrorized, but their discontent encouraged the Sultan Mahmud to hope for revenge, and a renewal of the conflict was only staved off by the anxious efforts of the European powers.

In the spring of 1839 the sultan ordered his army, concentrated under Reshid in the border district of Bir on the Euphrates, to advance over the Syrian frontier. Ibrahim, seeing his flank menaced, attacked it at Nezib on the 24th of June. Once more the Ottomans were utterly routed. Six days later, before the news reached Constantinople, Mahmud died.

Now, with the defeat of the Ottomans and the conquest of Syria, Muhammad Ali had reached the height of his power. For one brief moment in time, he had become the envy of the Egyptian kings of antiquity, controlling Egypt, the Sudan, and Syria (which alone would have made him their better in power) he saw the Ottoman armies collapse or fall into disorganization after their defeat in Syria, and it looked like the Middle East and Anatolia were his for the taking. It looked like he could march all the way to Istanbul, in the minds of some, and place himself on the Sultan&#x27;s throne.

With the Ottoman Empire at the feet of Muhammad Ali, the European powers were greatly alarmed and issued the Convention of London of 1840, designed to end the war and deal with the likely contingency of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s refusal. Their intervention during the Oriental Crisis of 1840 was prompt, launching an invasion by a primarily British force (with some French and Greek elements), they made short work of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s pride and joy: Egypt&#x27;s modern Armed forces. However, while his army was being defeated, Muhammad saw the possibility of victory in France&#x27;s unwillingness to participate (it having some warm feelings to the Khedive, and mainly participating with what was considered a token force to try to block a British expansion in North Africa.) However, in spite of France&#x27;s dislike of an Egypt dominated by the British, it was equally unwilling to allow the ambitious Governor to upset the balance of power, and thus, by waiting for the hope of a better chance at victory, Muhammad Ali had to suffer a harder defeat.

However, though he had lost Syria and his position of great power, the war with the West had not been a complete disaster by any means. For though humiliated and defeated by the Western Powers, the West had no intention of removing him and the block he placed on Ottoman Power. Thus, though the peace treaty was harsh, it achieved one of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s greatest dreams: to place his family firmly in the reigns of Egyptian power. It was far from all that the crafty Pasha had wanted, but it was what he had to live with, for even in the ending days of the Syrian War, Muhammad was starting to show his age, and would find that he did not have much time left in the world.

==End of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s rule==
The end was reached early in 1841. New &#x27;firmans&#x27; were issued which confined the pasha&#x27;s authority to Egypt, including the Sinai peninsula and certain places on the Arabian side of the Red Sea, and to the Sudan. The most important of these documents is dated February 13, 1841.

The government of the pashalik of Egypt was made hereditary within the family of Muhammad Ali. A map showing the boundaries of Egypt accompanied the firman granting Muhammad Ali the pashalik, a duplicate copy being retained by the Porte. The Egyptian copy is supposed to have been lost in a fire which destroyed a great part of the Egyptian archives. The Turkish copy has never been produced and its existence now appears doubtful. The point was of importance, as in 1892 and again in 1906 boundary disputes arose between Ottoman Empire and the Egyptian Khiedevate.

Various restrictions were laid upon Muhammad Ali, emphasizing his position as vassal. He was forbidden to maintain a fleet and his army was not to exceed 18,000 men. The pasha no longer a disrupting figure in European politics, but he continued to occupy himself with his improvements in Egypt. But times were not all good; the long wars combined with murrain of cattle in 1842 and a destructive Nile flood made matters worse. In 1843 there was a plague of locusts where whole villages were depopulated. Even the sequestered army was a strain enough for a population unaccustomed to the rigidities of the conscription service. Florence Nightingale, the famous British nurse, recounts in her letters from Egypt written in 1849–50, that many an Egyptian family thought it be enough to &quot;protect&quot; their children from the inhumanities of the military service by blinding them in one eye or rendering them unfit by cutting off their limb. But Muhammad Ali was not to be confounded by such tricks of bodily non-compliance, and with that view he set up a special corps of disabled musketeers declaring that one can shoot well enough even with one eye.

Meantime the uttermost farthing was wrung from the wretched &quot;fellahin&quot;, while they were forced to the building of magnificent public works by unpaid labor. In 1844–45 there was some improvement in the condition of the country as a result of financial reforms the pasha executed. Muhammad Ali, who had been granted the honorary rank of grand vizier in 1842, paid a visit to Istanbul in 1846, where he became reconciled to his old enemy Khosrev Pasha, whom he had not seen since he spared his life at Cairo in 1803.

In 1847 Muhammad Ali laid the foundation stone of the great bridge across the Nile at the beginning of the Delta. Towards the end of 1847, the aged pasha&#x27;s previously sharp mind began to give way, and by the following June he was no longer capable of administering the government. In September 1848 Ibrahim was acknowledged by the Porte as ruler of the pashalik, but he died in the following November.

Muhammad Ali survived another eight months, dying on August 2, 1849. He had done a great work in Egypt, the most permanent being the weakening of the tie binding the country to Turkey, the starting of the great cotton industry, the recognition of the advantages of European science, and the conquest of the Sudan.

==Muhammad Ali&#x27;s successors==
On Ibrahim&#x27;s death in November 1848 the government of Egypt fell to his nephew Abbas I, the son of Tusun Abbasad. Abbas put an end to the system of commercial monopolies, and during his reign the railway from Alexandria to Cairo was begun at the instigation of the British government. Opposed to European ways, Abbas lived in great seclusion. After a reign of less than six years he was murdered in July 1854 by two of his slaves.

He was succeeded by his uncle Said Pasha, the favorite son of Muhammad Ali, who lacked the strength of mind or physical health needed to execute the beneficent projects which he conceived. His endeavour, for instance, to put a stop to the slave raiding which devastated the Sudan was wholly ineffectual. He had a genuine regard for the welfare of the &quot;fellahin&quot;, and a land law of 1858 secured for them an acknowledgment of freehold as against state ownership.

The pasha was much under French influence, and in 1854 was induced to grant to the French engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps a concession &quot;to form a financial company to pierce the isthmus&quot; and operate a canal for 99 years. Lord Palmerston was opposed to this project, and the British opposition delayed the ratification of the concession by the Porte for two years. This prompted a second concession in 1856 that obligated the Egyptian government to provide 80% of the labour for the canal&#x27;s construction. Said also made concessions to the British, for the Eastern Telegraph Company, and another in 1854 allowing the establishment of the Bank of Egypt. He also began the national debt by borrowing £3,293,000 from Messrs ″Frühling &amp; Göschen″, the actual amount received by the pasha being £2,640,000. In January 1863 Said Pasha died and was succeeded by his nephew Ismail, a son of Ibrahim Pasha.

===Ismail the Magnificent===

The reign of Ismail, from 1863 to 1879, was initially hailed as a new era of bringing Egypt into modernity. He completed vast development schemes and attempted positive administrative reforms, but this progress, coupled with his personal extravagance led to bankruptcy. The later part of his reign is historically and nationally important simply for its result, which brought European intervention deeply into Egyptian finances and development, and led to the British occupation of Egypt shortly thereafter.

In his earlier years of reign, much was changed regarding Egypt&#x27;s sovereignty, which seemed likely to give Ismail a more important place in history. In 1866 the Ottoman Sultan granted him a &quot;firman&quot;, obtained on condition that he increase his annual tribute from £376,000 to £720,000. This made the succession to the throne of Egypt descend to the eldest of the male children and in the same manner to the eldest sons of these successors, instead of to the eldest male of the family, following the practice of Turkish law. In the next year another &quot;firman&quot; bestowed upon him the title of khedive in lieu of that of &quot;vali&quot;, borne by Mehemet Ali and his immediate successors. In 1873 a further &quot;firman&quot; placed the khedive in many respects in the position of an independent sovereign.

Ismail re-established and improved Muhammad Ali&#x27;s administrative system, which had fallen into decay under Abbas&#x27;s uneventful rule. This included a thorough revamping of the customs system which was anarchic, and remodeled on British lines and by English officials. In 1865, he established the Egyptian post office; he reorganized the military schools of his grandfather, and gave some support to the cause of education. Railways, telegraphs, irrigation projects, lighthouses, the harbour works at Suez, and the breakwater at Alexandria, were carried out during his reign, by some of the best contractors of Europe. Most important of all, was Egypt&#x27;s support for the Suez Canal, which finally opened in 1869. Not only did the government buy many shares in the venture, initially intended for British investors, it provided the corvee labour to dig the canal, as well as digging a canal to bring Nile water to the new city of Ismailia at the Suez&#x27;s midpoint. When Khedive Ismail sought to terminate Egypt&#x27;s corvee labour obligation, because he needed it for cotton production to take advantage of vastly inflated cotton prices, caused by the loss of American exports during its Civil War, Egypt was compelled to pay more than £3 million in compensation to the Canal Company. The funds helped pay for the elaborate dredging equipment brought in to replace the labour and needed to complete the canal.

Once that conflict ended Ismail had to find new sources of funding to keep his development and reform efforts alive. Thus the funds required for these public works, as well as the actual labor, were remorselessly extorted from a poverty-stricken population. A striking picture of the condition of the people at this period is given by Lady Duff Gordon in &quot;Last Letters from Egypt&quot;. Writing in 1867 she said: &quot;I cannot describe the misery here now every day some new tax. Every beast, camel, cow, sheep, donkey and horse is made to pay. The fellaheen can no longer eat bread; they are living on barley-meal mixed with water, and raw green stuff, vetches, &amp;c. The taxation makes life almost impossible: a tax on every crop, on every animal first, and again when it is sold in the market; on every man, on charcoal, on butter, on salt. . . . The people in Upper Egypt are running away by wholesale, utterly unable to pay the new taxes and do the work exacted. Even here (Cairo) the beating for the years taxes is awful.&quot;

In the late 1860s Egypt attempted to build a modern navy and ordered several armored ironclads, two each of the &quot;Nijmi Shevket&quot; class and the &quot;Lutfi Djelil&quot; class. Although intended for the Egyptian Navy, these ironclads had to be delivered to the Ottoman Navy in 1869. Egypt was able to keep a navy with a few unarmored warships including the iron steam frigate &quot;Ibrahim&quot; and a large yacht, the &quot;Mahroussa&quot; which survives in rebuilt form to the present day.

In the years that followed the condition of things grew worse. A public health crisis arose in Egypt. The Constantinople Board of Health reported that the plague could still be found in Egypt, within the districts of Marj and Assyr. A 21-day quarantine was imposed on the ports of El Wedj. Thousands of people died and large sums expended in extending Ismail&#x27;s dominions in the Sudan and in futile conflicts with Ethiopia. Eventually, Egypt successfully annexed the region of Darfur, further expanding the state. In 1875, the impoverishment of the &quot;fellah&quot; had reached such a high point that the ordinary resources of the country no longer sufficed for the most urgent necessities of administration; and the khedive Ismail, having repeatedly broken faith with his creditors, could not raise any more loans on the European market. The taxes were habitually collected many months in advance, and the colossal floating debt was increasing rapidly. In these circumstances Ismail had to realize his remaining assets, and among them sold 176,602 Suez Canal shares to the British government for £976,582, which surrendered Egyptian control of the waterway.

These crises induced the British government to inquire more carefully into the financial condition of the country, where Europeans had invested much capital. In December 1875, Stephen Cave, MP, and Colonel (later Sir) John Stokes, RE, were sent to Egypt to inquire into Egypt&#x27;s financial situation. Mr Cave&#x27;s report, made public only in April 1876, showed that under the existing administration national bankruptcy was inevitable. With no alternatives, European powers used Egypt&#x27;s indebtedness to extract concessions regarding how the debts would be repaid. Other commissions of inquiry followed, and each one brought Ismail increasingly under European control. The establishment of the Mixed Tribunals in 1876, in place of the system of consular jurisdiction in civil actions, made some of the courts of justice international.

The Caisse de la Dette, instituted in May 1876 as a result of the Cave mission, led to international control over a large portion of the government&#x27;s revenue. In November 1876, the mission of Mr (afterwards Lord) Goschen and M. Joubert on behalf of the British and French bondholders, one result being the establishment of Dual Control, in which an English official would superintend the revenues and a French official would superintend the expenditures of the country. Another result was the international control of the railways and the port of Alexandria, to balance these items. Then, in May 1878, a commission of inquiry of which the principal members were Sir Charles Rivers Wilson, Major Evelyn Baring (afterwards Lord Cromer) and MM. Kremer-Baravelli and Monsieur de Blignières. One result of that inquiry was the extension of international control to the enormous property of the khedive himself.

Driven to desperation in September 1878, Ismail made a virtue of necessity and, in lieu of the Dual Control, accepted a constitutional ministry, under the presidency of Nubar Pasha; Rivers Wilson became minister of finance and de Blignières became minister of public works. Professing to be quite satisfied with this arrangement, he announced that Egypt was no longer in Africa but a part of Europe. Within seven months however, he found his constitutional position intolerable, got rid of his irksome cabinet by means of a secretly organized military riot in Cairo, and reverted to his old autocratic methods of government.

Britain and France, anxious about losing influence under this affront, decided to administer chastisement by the hand of the suzerain power, which was delighted to have an opportunity of asserting its authority. The Europeans and the Sublime Porte decided to force Ismail out of office. On the June 26, 1879 Ismail suddenly received from the sultan a curt telegram, addressed to him as ex-khedive of Egypt, informing him that his son Tewfik was appointed his successor. Surprised, he made no attempt at resistance, and Tewfik was at once proclaimed khedive.

==Dual control==
After a short period of inaction, when it seemed as if the change might be for the worse, Britain and France in November 1879, re-established the Dual Control in the persons of Major Baring and Monsieur de Blignières. For two years the Dual Control governed Egypt. Discontent within various sectors of the elite and among elements of the population at large led to a reaction against European interference. Without any efficient means of self-protection and coercion at its disposal, it had to interfere with the power, privileges and perquisites of the local elite. This elite, so far as its civilian members were concerned, was not very formidable, because these were not likely to go beyond the bounds of intrigue and passive resistance; but it contained a military element who had more courage, and who had learned their power when Ismail employed them for overturning his constitutional ministry.

Among the mutinous soldiers on that occasion was an officer calling himself Ahmed Urabi. He was a charismatic leader who was followed by a group of fellow army officers and many among the lower classes. He became the centre of a protest aimed at protecting the Egyptians from their Turkish and European oppressors. The movement began among the Arab officers, who complained of the preference shown to the officers of Turkish origin; it then expanded into an attack on the privileged position and predominant influence of foreigners; finally, it was directed against all Christians, foreign and native. The government, being too weak to suppress the agitation and disorder, had to make concessions, and each concession produced fresh demands. Urabi was first promoted, then made under-secretary for war, and ultimately a member of the cabinet.

The danger of a serious rising brought the British and French fleets in May 1882 to Alexandria. Because of concerns over the safety of the Suez Canal and massive British investments in Egypt the Europeans looked to intervene. The French hesitated, however, and the British alone tried to suppress the revolt. On July 11, 1882, after widespread revolts in Alexandria, the British fleet bombarded the city. The leaders of the national movement prepared to resist further aggression by force. A conference of ambassadors was held in Constantinople, and the sultan was invited to quell the revolt; but he hesitated to employ his troops against what was far more a threat to European interests.

==Egypt occupied by the British==

The British government decided to employ armed force, and invited France to cooperate. The French government declined, and a similar invitation to Italy met with a similar refusal. Britain therefore, acting alone, landed troops at Ismailia under Sir Garnet Wolseley, and suppressed the revolt by the battle of Tel-el-Kebir on September 13, 1882. While it had been claimed this was meant to be only a temporary intervention, British troops would remain in Egypt until 1956.
The landing in Ismailia happened due to the British failure to perform the original plan to destroy defences in Alexandria, then march to Cairo.

With no fleet to protect the city, British battleships easily bombarded the city, forcing many civilians to migrate. Uraby, the Egyptian army commander, was not allowed to have troopers exceeding 800 men strong. Defeated in Alexandria, he decided to fight the British on ground he gathered the 2,200 men at Kafr-el-sheikh and constructed strong base which he held against a force of 2,600 British who were trying to advance on Cairo from the north. The battle took place between an Egyptian army, headed by Ahmed ‘Urabi, and British forces headed by Sir Archibald Alison. As a result, the British abandoned any hope they may have had of reaching Cairo from the north, and shifted their base of operations to Ismailia instead. The British forces retreating to their main base at Alexandria. The British then transported a large force of Ismailia where 13,000 of them engaged 16,000 Egyptians. They met Uraby at El-Tal El-Kebier which was weakly prepared comparing with the defence lines at Kafr- El- Shiekh to withstand heavy artillery, so the fort was taken and Uraby was exiled to India.

The khedive, who had taken refuge in Alexandria, returned to Cairo, and a ministry was formed under Sherif Pasha, with Riaz Pasha as one of its leading members. On assuming office, the first thing it had to do was to bring to trial the chiefs of the rebellion. Urabi pleaded guilty, was sentenced to death, the sentence being commuted by the khedive to banishment; and Riaz resigned in disgust. This solution of the difficulty was brought about by Lord Dufferin, then British ambassador at Istanbul, who had been sent to Egypt as high commissioner to adjust affairs and report on the situation.

One of his first acts, after preventing the application of capital punishment to the ringleaders of the revolt, was to veto the project of protecting the khedive and his government by means of a Praetorian guard recruited from Asia Minor, Epirus, Austria and Switzerland, and to insist on the principle that Egypt must be governed in a truly liberal spirit. Passing in review all the departments of the administration, he laid down the general lines on which the country was to be restored to order and prosperity, and endowed, if possible, with the elements of self-government for future use.

Egyptian Fundamental Ordinance of 1882, a constitution, followed an abortive attempt to promulgate a constitution in 1879. The document was limited in scope and was effectively more of an organic law of the Consultative Council to the khedive than an actual constitution.

==Demographic changes during the reign of Muhammad Ali and his successors==
During this period the stagnation of the Egyptian population that had been fluctuating at about 4 million level for many centuries prior to 1805 was changed by the start of a rapid population growth. This growth was quite slow till the 1840s, but since then the Egyptian population grew up to about 7 million by the 1880s, and the first modern census registered 9,734,405 people in Egypt in 1897. This was achieved by a radical decrease in mortality rates and concomitant growth of life expectancy by 10–15 years, which, of course, indicates that Muhammad Ali and his successors in fact achieved impressive success in the effective modernization of Egypt and that the actual quality of life of the majority of the Egyptian population significantly increased in the 19th century. In Egypt in the 19th century the overall pattern of the population growth was explicitly non-Malthusian and can be characterized as hyperbolic, whereby the increase in population was accompanied not by decreases of the relative population growth rates, but by their increases.

<text>Lila Diane Sawyer (; born December 22, 1945) is an American television broadcast journalist known for anchoring major programs on two networks including &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;20/20&quot;, and &quot;Primetime&quot; newsmagazine while at ABC News. During her tenure at CBS News, she hosted &quot;CBS Morning&quot; and was the first woman correspondent on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. Prior to her journalism career, she was a member of U.S. President Richard Nixon&#x27;s White House staff and assisted in his post-presidency memoirs. Presently she works for ABC News producing documentaries and interview specials.

==Early life==
Sawyer was born in Glasgow, Kentucky, to Jean W. (née Dunagan), an elementary school teacher, and Erbon Powers &quot;Tom&quot; Sawyer, a county judge. Her ancestry includes English, Irish, Scots-Irish, and German. She has an older sister, Linda. Soon after her birth, her family moved to Louisville, where her father rose to local prominence as a Republican politician and community leader. He was Kentucky&#x27;s Jefferson County Judge/Executive when he was killed in a car accident on Louisville&#x27;s Interstate 64 in 1969. E. P. &quot;Tom&quot; Sawyer State Park, in the Frey&#x27;s Hill area of Louisville, is named in his honor.

Sawyer attended Seneca High School in the Buechel area of Louisville. She served as an editor-in-chief for her school yearbook, &quot;The Arrow&quot;, and participated in many artistic activities. She always felt, however, that she was in the shadow of her sister, Linda. Insecure and something of a loner as a teen, Diane found happiness, she later said, going off by herself or with a group of friends that called themselves &quot;reincarnated transcendentalists&quot; and read Emerson and Thoreau down by a creek. In her senior year of high school in 1963, she won the annual America&#x27;s Junior Miss scholarship pageant representing Kentucky. She won by her strength of poise in the final interview and her essay comparing the music of the North and the South during the Civil War. From 1963 to 1965, Sawyer toured the country as America&#x27;s Junior Miss to promote the Coca-Cola Pavilion at the 1964–1965 New York World&#x27;s Fair. She had dreaded travelling around the country as America&#x27;s Junior Miss, but it taught her to think on her feet with poise and grace. Sawyer attended Wellesley College, graduating in 1967.

==Career==


Immediately after her graduation, Sawyer returned to Kentucky and was employed as a weather forecaster for WLKY-TV in Louisville. In Sawyer&#x27;s opinion, the weather was boring, so she would occasionally add quotes to keep it interesting. Finally, Sawyer was promoted to a general-assignment post, but this did not sustain her interest for long. In 1970, Sawyer moved to Washington, D.C., and, unable to find work as a broadcast journalist, she interviewed for positions in government offices. She eventually became an assistant to Jerry Warren, the White House deputy press secretary. Initially, Sawyer wrote press releases and quickly graduated to other tasks like drafting some of President Richard Nixon&#x27;s public statements. Within a few months, she became an administrative assistant to White House Press Secretary Ron Ziegler and eventually rose to become a staff assistant for U.S. President Richard Nixon. In 1973 when John Dean testified to the Senate Watergate Committee concerning Nixon&#x27;s involvement in the Watergate coverup, Sawyer and Larry Speakes were assigned to the staff of Nixon&#x27;s lawyer J. Fred Buzhardt for a project to &quot;prove&quot; that Dean was lying. Speakes later claimed that he had come to the conclusion that Dean had not lied, and that he informed Sawyer, but they continued their efforts.

Sawyer continued through Nixon&#x27;s resignation from the presidency in 1974 and worked on the Nixon-Ford transition team in 1974–1975, after which she followed Nixon to California and helped him write &quot;RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon&quot;, published in 1978. She also helped prepare Nixon for his famous set of television interviews with journalist David Frost in 1977.

Years later, Sawyer would be suspected of being Deep Throat, the source of leaks of classified information to journalist Bob Woodward during the Watergate scandal. In 2005, Deep Throat was identified as W. Mark Felt, but prior to that, Rabbi Baruch Korff – a longtime Nixon confidant and defender known as &quot;Nixon&#x27;s rabbi&quot; – said on his deathbed that he believed Sawyer was Deep Throat. Sawyer laughed it off and became one of six people to request and receive a public denial from Woodward.

When Sawyer came back to Washington, D.C., in 1978, she joined CBS News as a general-assignment reporter. She was promoted to political correspondent in February 1980 and featured on the weekday broadcasts of &quot;Morning with Charles Kuralt&quot;. When CBS expanded its morning news show from 60 to 90 minutes, Sawyer was announced as co-anchor on May 13, 1981, by the president of CBS News. With her debut on September 28, 1981, she put her own stamp on the broadcast. The ratings for the show were boosted upon Sawyer&#x27;s arrival, but the improvement did not last and, after Kuralt left the show, he was replaced by Bill Kurtis. The ratings decreased further, and Sawyer asked to be reassigned in 1984. From 1982 to 1984, Sawyer was also seen with Kurtis on the &quot;CBS Early Morning News&quot; airing an hour earlier on most CBS affiliates.

In 1984, she became the first female correspondent on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, a CBS News investigative-television newsmagazine.

In 1989, she moved to ABC News to co-anchor &quot;Primetime Live&quot; newsmagazine with Sam Donaldson. She and Donaldson co-anchored Primetime Live from 1989 to 1998 and its successor, &quot;20/20 Wednesday&quot;, from 1998 to 2000. Sawyer also co-anchored a Sunday edition of &quot;20/20&quot; with Barbara Walters from 1998 to 1999.

On January 18, 1999, Sawyer returned to morning news as the co-anchor of &quot;Good Morning America&quot; with Charles Gibson. The assignment was putatively temporary, but her success in the position, measured by a close in the gap with front-runner &quot;Today&quot;, NBC News&#x27; morning program, sustained her in the position for nearly eleven years.

In 2000, Sawyer returned as co-anchor of &quot;Primetime&quot; TV newsmagazine (later &quot;Primetime Thursday&quot;), with Gibson replacing Donaldson. Sawyer was the first to announce to &quot;Good Morning America&quot; viewers that the first plane crashed into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. In 2004, when the show&#x27;s title was changed to its original name, &quot;Primetime Live&quot;, a new executive producer was hired, and the newsmagazine format was changed to investigative reporting with Sawyer rotating as the co-anchor with Chris Cuomo, Cynthia McFadden, and John Quiñones. In 2005, the show was retitled &quot;Primetime&quot;, and Sawyer left the show at the end of 2006 when its format again changed, with a sub-series focus.

Sawyer achieved worldwide acclaim after subjecting Mel Gibson to an intense television interrogation, after his 2006 DUI arrest.
On September 2, 2009, Sawyer was announced as the successor to Charles Gibson, who retired as the anchor of &quot;ABC World News&quot;, on Friday, December 18, 2009. Sawyer left &quot;GMA&quot; on December 11, 2009, and was scheduled to become the &quot;ABC World News&quot; anchor in January 2010. However, on December 1, 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that, instead of moving to &quot;ABC World News&quot; in January 2010, Sawyer would start on December 21, 2009, three days after Gibson&#x27;s departure. For over a year (2010–2011), with Katie Couric as then anchor of &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, two of the three network news anchors on broadcast television were women. Ratings initially rose 8% after Sawyer&#x27;s first four weeks, averaging 8.8 million viewers.

She signed off at the end of her nightly broadcast with &quot;I&#x27;ll see you right back here tomorrow night.&quot; The show, like the competing evening newscasts, ended the year with ratings 14% below that of the preceding year. Until 2014 she was the anchor of ABC&#x27;s flagship broadcast &quot;World News&quot; and the network&#x27;s principal anchor for breaking-news coverage, election coverage, and special events.

On June 25, 2014, it was announced that she would step down from the anchor chair at &quot;ABC World News&quot; in September 2014. She remained with ABC News to focus on creating specials and conducting high-profile interviews.

<doc id="471083" wikidata="Q4336884" url="?curid=471083" title="Touching the Void (book)">
<text>Touching the Void is a 1988 book by Joe Simpson, recounting his and Simon Yates&#x27;s near fatal descent after climbing the peak Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes. Approximately 15% of the book is written by Yates. It has sold over a million copies and has been translated into over 20 languages.

==Summary==
In 1985, Simpson and Yates reached the peak of Siula Grande, a major mountain in the Cordillera Huayhuash in the Peruvian Andes via the previously unclimbed West Face. They began descending via the peak&#x27;s North Ridge which the pair found unexpectedly challenging with Yates falling through a cornice down the face they had just climbed but he was held by the rope which prevented him falling to his death. Because the difficult terrain and the poor weather conditions prevented rapid progress with the descent, the pair had to spend a night in a snow hole on the ridge. During the night they had eaten the last of their food and used the last of fuel for their stove to melt ice and snow for drinking water. Continuing the descent the following morning Simpson fell from an ice cliff and landed awkwardly, breaking his right leg and crushing his tibia into his knee joint. With bad weather closing in and daylight fading, they needed to descend quickly to the glacier, about below.

Yates proceeded to lower Simpson off the North Ridge using their two ropes tied together to make one rope, controlling the speed at which he lowered Simpson using a belay plate. This methodology meant that each lower had to proceed in three stages: two to descend each rope length, and one to negotiate the join between them. The steep open snow and ice slope to be descended did not have any belay points or other anchors from which Yates could secure himself to lower his companion so they created a stance by excavating a shallow cavity/seat where Yates could brace himself to take the strain of Simpson&#x27;s weight on the rope and control the descent. Simpson was lowered 150 feet until the knot in the rope came up against the belay plate, at which point he had to take his weight off the rope by standing on his uninjured leg. This gave Yates enough slack to unclip the rope and rethread it back through the lowering device with the knot on the other side, following which he lowered Simpson a further 150 feet. Then when Simpson had made himself secure, Yates would downclimb to Simpson&#x27;s position and the pair then created another stance from which the procedure could be repeated. The system worked; Yates lowered Simpson approximately by this method and the pair felt they were regaining control of the situation estimating that they had almost descended to the relative safety of the glacier. With storm conditions worsening and darkness upon them, Yates continued lowering Simpson for what he estimated would be the last or penultimate time. The slope that Simpson was being lowered down became gradually steeper and eventually he went over the edge of a cliff and was hanging free with his whole weight on the rope. Because Yates was sitting higher up the mountain, he could not see nor hear Simpson to fully assess the situation; he could only feel that Simpson had all his weight on the rope. Simpson attempted to ascend the rope using Prusik loops. However, because his hands were badly frostbitten, he struggled to tie the knots properly and accidentally dropped one of the two loops required to ascend the rope.

The pair were both in mortal danger. Simpson could not climb up the rope, Yates could not pull him back up, they could not communicate and, although they could not know this, the cliff was too high for Simpson to be lowered down. They remained in this position for some time (Yates estimates in excess of one and a half hours), until it was obvious to Yates that his unbelayed stance, merely a seat dug into the near vertical snow slope without any fixed anchors, was gradually collapsing as he began to be pulled downwards in &#x27;small jerky steps&#x27;. Yates knew he was about to be pulled from the cliff and that he would fall the 150 ft he was above Simpson plus some unknown additional distance to the glacier below and concluded he needed to cut the rope in order to prevent a fall that would almost certainly kill him. Yates cut the rope not knowing how far Simpson was from the base of the cliff; Simpson plummeted down the cliff and into a deep crevasse. Exhausted and suffering from hypothermia and frostbite, Yates dug himself a snow cave to wait out the storm. The next morning in clear weather, Yates carried on descending the mountain by himself. When he reached the glacier he could see from below the position in which Simpson had been hanging and observed the large crevasse immediately underneath. Yates realized the situation that Simpson had been in and that he must have fallen into the crevasse when the rope was cut. He then approached the edge of the crevasse calling out to Simpson by name and, hearing no reply, Yates concluded that Simpson had been killed by the fall into the crevasse and so continued down the mountain alone.

Simpson, however, was still alive. He had survived the fall of more than and had landed on a small ledge inside the crevasse. When he regained consciousness, he discovered that the rope had been cut and concluded that Yates had probably survived but would presume that he was dead. He therefore had to save himself but he found it impossible to climb up to the entrance of the crevasse, because of the overhanging ice and his broken leg. Therefore, his only choice was to abseil deeper into the crevasse and hope that there was another way out. After lowering himself, Simpson found himself on a snow bridge which he crossed to get on to a steep snow slope which he climbed to get back onto the glacier.

In a fortunate coincidence, although Yates had no choice as to where in the rope&#x27;s length he made the cut (it happened to be in the middle) it left each climber a sufficient length of rope to extricate themselves from their overnight positions. Yates had enough rope to abseil to safety from his snow hole and Simpson had enough rope to get to a point in the crevasse where he could climb out.

From there, Simpson spent three days without food and with almost no water, crawling and hopping back to their base camp. This involved navigating the glacier (which was scattered with more crevasses) and the moraines below. Exhausted and delirious, he reached base camp only a few hours before Yates and Richard Hawking (the third member of the group, a non-climber) intended to leave the base camp and return to civilization.

Simpson&#x27;s survival is regarded by mountaineers as amongst the most remarkable instances of survival against the odds.

<text>David Patrick Paul Alton, Baron Alton of Liverpool, (born 15 March 1951) is a British-Irish politician, formerly a Member of Parliament for the Liberal Party and later Liberal Democrat who has sat as a crossbench member of the House of Lords since 1997 when he was made a life peer. Alton is also known for his human rights work including the co-founding of Jubilee Action, the children&#x27;s charity (which changed its name to Chance for Childhood in 2014), and serves as chair, patron or trustee of several charities and voluntary organisations.

Alton is a visiting professor of Liverpool Hope University, an Ambassador Fellow of Liverpool John Moores University, and a former President of the Catholic Union of Great Britain.

==Education and entry into politics==
Born in London on 15 March 1951, His father was a Desert Rat who had served in the Eighth Army, and then worked for the Ford Motor Company. His mother was a native Irish speaker from the West of Ireland. After being rehoused from the East End, Alton was brought up in a council flat on an overspill council estate. He passed a scholarship exam to join the first intake of a new Jesuit grammar school and was educated at The Campion School and Christ&#x27;s College of Education, Liverpool. He began his career as a teacher and, in 1972, was elected as a Liberal to Liverpool City Council as Britain&#x27;s youngest city councillor. Alton was elected for the Low Hill ward, serving from 1972 to 1974, then, after the Local Government Act 1974, he was elected for the Smithdown ward where he served for the next six years. Alton was also a member of Merseyside County Council for the Smithdown division from 1974 to 1977 and chairman of the housing committee. He was deputy leader of Liverpool City Council from 1978 to 1980.

==Political career==
Alton was elected as Member of Parliament for Liverpool Edge Hill at a by-election in 1979 for the Liberal Party, when he became the &quot;Baby of the House&quot;, achieving a record swing of 36.8% and 64% of the vote. He won the seat the day after the Callaghan Government was defeated in a vote of confidence and the 1979 General Election being called. He became the shortest lived MP, a member for less than a week, and made his Maiden Speech within three hours of taking his seat. Five weeks later he was re-elected and went on to serve as a Liverpool MP for 18 years, before standing down. He was the only new member of a Parliamentary Party of 11 MPs. He campaigned on the slogan &quot;Everyone Knows Someone Who Has Been Helped by David Alton.&quot; He was notably a very short-serving Baby of the House, as Stephen Dorrell, who was a year younger than Alton, was elected at the 1979 election.

When the Edge Hill constituency was abolished for the 1983 general election, he was elected to represent the new Liverpool Mossley Hill constituency.

Alton held a number of spokesman posts for the Liberals: environment and race relations, 1979-1981; Home Affairs, 1981-1982; Northern Ireland, 1987-1988. He also served as Chief Whip from 1985 to 1987. He is known for his anti-abortion position, and in 1987 he resigned as Chief Whip to campaign for his unsuccessful private member&#x27;s bill which aimed to stop late abortions. He became a Liberal Democrat MP when the Liberal Party merged with the SDP in 1988, but he had difficult relations with parts of the party, especially over attempts to make the party adopt a position in favour of abortion rights. In 1992, he announced that he would not stand again as a Liberal Democrat after the party passed a policy that he believed committed the party to support abortion for the first time. A motion passed in Spring 1993 stating that the party had no position on the substantive issue of abortion spared him delivering on the promise.

He stood down as an MP at the 1997 general election. His constituency seat was also abolished at that election.

===House of Lords===
Inn April 1997, it was announced that he was to be made a life peer, as part of John Major&#x27;s 1997 Dissolution Honours. He was created as Baron Alton of Liverpool, &quot;of Mossley Hill in the County of Merseyside&quot; on 12 June 1997. He took his seat in the House of Lords as a crossbencher on 12 June 1997.

Alton is chairman of the British-DPRK All-Party Parliamentary Group, and visited Pyongyang in October 2010 when he had talks with leaders of the North Korean government including Choe Thae-bok, the chairman of the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly.

On 26 March 2021, it was announced that Alton was one of two members of the House of Lords to be sanctioned by China for spreading what it called &quot;lies and disinformation&quot; about the country. He was subsequently banned from entering China, Hong Kong and Macau, and Chinese citizens and institutions are prohibited from doing business with him. The sanctions were condemned by the Prime Minister and led the Foreign Secretary to summon the Chinese ambassador.

On the 12 December 2022, Alton was sanctioned by Iran, along with the Chief of the Defence Staff, a Government Minister, Members of Parliament, as well as other individuals and institutions from the UK. It is understood that this was done because of Alton&#x27;s criticism of Iran&#x27;s Human Rights record.

Alton was formally denounced by the North Korean regime and told he would be listed as an enemy of their State because of his collaboration with the UN Commission of Inquiry into North Korea which found evidence of crimes against humanity and for providing support to escapees.

==Parliamentary Appointments==
Alton served on: 
House of Lords International Relations and Defence Select Committee from 2019 - 2023. 
Joint House of Lords and House of Commons Committee on Human Rights 2023 -.

==Professor of Citizenship==
In 1997, Alton was appointed Professor of Citizenship at Liverpool John Moores University, establishing the Foundation for Citizenship and the Roscoe Lectures. The lecture series explores citizenship and lectures have been given by commentators including the 14th Dalai Lama and Prince Charles.

==Human rights==

Alton established the lobby group for human rights, Jubilee Campaign, in 1987, with the support of other members of parliament. He also co-founded Jubilee Action, a children&#x27;s charity established to fulfil the humanitarian needs highlighted by the work of Jubilee Campaign. In 2014 Jubilee Action changed its name to Chance for Childhood.

Alton campaigned against the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008, opposing the creation and use of animal-human hybrid stem cells for medical purposes.

He is a patron of the International Young Leaders Network and Save the Congo!, a small international rights group founded by the Congolese rights activist Vava Tampa to end the political crisis that continues to give rise to wars, conflicts and violence that have killed over 5.4 million people in Congo.

===Support for Hong Kong ===
Alton has supported the rights and freedoms of those in Hong Kong, during the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and regarding the National Security Law imposed by Beijing in June 2020, and its associated clampdowns. In reaction to pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho&#x27;s actions regarding women and the LGBT+ community, as well as Ho&#x27;s alleged support of the Yuen Long attackers, Alton worked with Luke de Pulford to pressure Anglia Ruskin University into rescinding the honorary doctoral degree it had conferred on Ho. The degree was withdrawn on 29 October 2019.

During the 2019 Hong Kong Polytechnic University conflict, he issued a statement calling for the end to police violence and criticising Chief Executive Carrie Lam.

===Trade Bill amendment===
In January 2021, Alton influenced the Lords to pass an amendment to the Trade Act 2021 that &quot;would require that the UK does not trade with genocidal regimes. Importantly, with the United Nations having shown itself incapable of making such decisions, the determination of whether genocide has taken place would be made by the High Court of England and Wales.&quot;

==Personal life==
Alton is married to Elizabeth Bell, they have four children and five grandchildren. Alton holds both British and Irish citizenship, as do his children. He resides in Lancashire and is a Roman Catholic.

<doc id="471095" wikidata="Q7439375" url="?curid=471095" title="Scuba diving in the Cayman Islands">
<text>The three islands of the Cayman Islands are the exposed top of an underwater mountain. Underwater, the sides of this mountain are quite steep, vertical in some places, within as little as a few hundred metres from shore.

In addition to the expected coral reefs, colourful fish, and other underwater creatures, scuba divers can also partake in &quot;wall diving&quot; in the Cayman Islands and many of the sites contain tunnels and &quot;grottos&quot; that provide penetration opportunities for experienced divers. Scuba diving in the Caymans can be done by boat or directly from shore.

The tourism industry on the Cayman Islands caters to divers, with many resorts and condominium complexes having in-house diving operations offering course work, daily excursions, scuba equipment sales and rentals.

==Grand Cayman==

The diving on Grand Cayman is divided roughly into 4 areas; Seven Mile Beach and the Northwest Point, The North Wall, The South Side, and The East End, with 245 dive sites. Due to the prevailing southeast winds, it is rare to dive the South Side dive sites, though it is possible. Popular dive sites include the Kittiwake, which is located on the northwestern tip of Seven Mile Beach, and the 12-foot divesite of Stingray City.

Visibility is exceptionally good due to the island&#x27;s geography. There is very little runoff of silt or fertilizers from the land, and the steep walls result in the reefs being unusually close to deep ocean water.

Marine life in Grand Cayman includes tarpon, silversides, French angelfish, and Barrel Sponges, among others.

==Cayman Brac and Little Cayman==

Both of the &#x27;sister islands&#x27; are thin strips of land lying roughly east to west, and the diving is divided between the north and south sides. Because of the prevailing southeast winds, it is rare to dive on the south side of these islands. Cayman Brac features over 50 dive sites. The MV Capt. Keith Tibbets, the only Russian warship available to divers in the Western hemisphere, is located on Cayman Brac. Cayman Brac also has an additional 11 dive sites reachable by shore. On Little Cayman, &#x27;Bloody Bay Wall&#x27; and &#x27;Jackson Bay&#x27; are dive destinations. Little Cayman features shallow dives as low at 20 feet and as deep as 6,000 feet. They are both situated on the north side of the island and are not accessible year-round because of weather conditions.

<text>Pilgram Marpeck (also Pilgram Marbeck; c. 1495 – 1556) was an important Anabaptist leader in southern Germany in the 16th century.

==Biography==
Marpeck was a native of Rattenberg in the County of Tyrol. His father, Heinrich Marpeck, moved from Rosenheim in Bavaria to Rattenberg, Austria, where he served as a city councilman. Heinrich also served as a judge (1494–1502) and mayor (1511). Pilgram attended the Latin school in Rattenberg.

Before his days as an Anabaptist, Pilgram Marpeck enjoyed a good financial status and was a highly respected citizen of Rattenberg on the Inn River. He was a mining engineer, a member of the miners&#x27; brotherhood, and served on both Rattenberg&#x27;s inner and outer councils.

Records of Marpeck&#x27;s conversion to Anabaptism are not extant. It is known that in his position as a mining magistrate, he was required by Archduke Ferdinand to expose miners in sympathy with the Anabaptist movement. Leonhard Schiemer was executed by authorities two weeks before Marpeck left his mining position on 28 January 1528. It is generally believed that he lost his position because he refused to aid authorities in capturing the Anabaptists. Marpeck was quickly reduced from a prominent citizen of Rattenberg to a &quot;wandering citizen of heaven&quot;.

From 1528 to 1532, Marpeck lived in Strasbourg, serving for two years as a timber supervisor, before he was expelled from the city because of his Anabaptist activity. For the next 12 years, he lived a wanderer&#x27;s life in Switzerland, and traveled to Tyrol, Moravia, South Germany, and Alsace. He is believed to have established Anabaptist congregations in these areas.

In 1544, Pilgram Marpeck was working in the city forest of Augsburg. On 12 May 1545, he was employed as the city engineer, a position he held until his death there in December 1556. His services were evidently in great demand, for, although the city issued reprimands and warnings to desist, Marpeck continued his activities as a minister among the Anabaptists.

In addition to his labors as a pastor and church organizer, Marpeck made other important contributions to the Anabaptists, the chief of which flowed from his pen. Marpeck debated with Martin Bucer and Kaspar Schwenkfeld, but also attacked the incarnation view of Melchior Hoffman, the Münsterite use of force, and the Hutterian community of goods. He held both the Old and New Testaments to be the Word of God, but distinguished the New Testament as the authoritative rule of faith and practice for Christian brethren. Marpeck attributed the German Peasants&#x27; War, the Münster Rebellion, Ulrich Zwingli&#x27;s death, and many of the excesses of the Catholic Church to the failure to make this distinction. Pilgram held a moderate position among Anabaptists, criticizing the positions of both the legalists and the spiritualists. His writings include the &quot;Vermanung&quot; (a revision of Rothmann&#x27;s &quot;Bekentnisse&quot;), the &quot;Verantwortung&quot; (a reply to Schwenkfeld), and the &quot;Testamentserläuterung&quot;. William Estep suggests that Marpeck was to South German Anabaptism what Menno Simons was to Dutch Anabaptism.

==Family==
Pilgram Marpeck married Sophia Harrer, by whom he had one child. After her death, he married a woman named Anna. They had no offspring, but adopted three children.

==Theology==
Because of his zeal for defending Anabaptism wherever he went by debating and writing, Marpeck was considered an effective teacher by followers and a formidable heretic by opponents. He was similar in a few ways to Hans Denck in his views of following the leading of the Holy Spirit, and he warned others against the legalistic standards others were imposing on baptism, communion, church discipline, and dress codes. At first Marpeck had embraced Lutheranism, but he turned to Anabaptism after realizing the easy justification Luther&#x27;s theology gave to carnal freedom. He, in contrast with Denck, believed the Holy Scriptures set forth the standards for Christians which included establishing the institution of the church. In accordance with this, Marpeck&#x27;s theology taught the freedom of Christ and not focusing on outward legalism.

==Recent interest==
Interest in Marpeck&#x27;s life and thought have seen a major revival in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The discovery of the &quot;Kunstbuch&quot;, a collection of works by Marpeck and his circle, has contributed to this revival. Full-length monographs have considered his hermeneutics (William Klassen), his social thought (Stephen Boyd), his Christology (Neal Blough), and his theological method (Malcolm Yarnell).

<doc id="471107" wikidata="Q1617771" url="?curid=471107" title="Peter Archer, Baron Archer of Sandwell">
<text>Peter Kingsley Archer, Baron Archer of Sandwell, (20 November 1926 – 14 June 2012), was a British lawyer and Labour Party politician. He was a Member of Parliament from 1966 until 1992, when he became a life peer. Between 1974 and 1979 he was Solicitor General for England and Wales.

==Early life and education==
Archer was born in Wednesbury, Staffordshire on 20 November 1926. He left school at sixteen, and became a clerk for the Ministry of Health before spending four years working in coal mines under the Bevin Boys scheme. He subsequently obtained degrees in Philosophy and Law at the London School of Economics and University College London, and was called to the Bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1952.

==Career==
Archer joined the Labour Party in 1947. He was selected in 1957 as the candidate for the Hendon South parliamentary seat, which he unsuccessfully contested in 1959 after declining to contest the 1957 by-election for his home area of Wednesbury. After contesting Brierley Hill in 1964, he was returned for Rowley Regis and Tipton in 1966. He served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Attorney General Sir Elwyn Jones (1967–1970) and in 1969 was the British representative on the United Nations&#x27; &quot;third committee&quot; on human rights.

While in opposition, Archer was a member of the All-Party Group for World Government (1970–1974), was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1971 and between 1971 and 1974 was Chair of Amnesty International&#x27;s UK Section; he was a founder member of the Amnesty International Committee in 1961.

After boundary changes for the February 1974 election, Archer was returned for Warley West. In the new Labour government, led by Harold Wilson and then James Callaghan, he was appointed Solicitor General, a post he held until 1979. Archer and his colleague Attorney General Sam Silkin declined knighthoods, which was customary for individuals appointed to these positions. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1977. In opposition, he was spokesman for legal affairs (1979–1982), Shadow Trade Secretary (1982–1983), and Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (1983–1987) under Neil Kinnock. He was also appointed a Recorder of the Crown Court in 1982. He stood down at the 1992 general election and subsequently received a life peerage as Baron Archer of Sandwell, of Sandwell in the County of West Midlands in 1992.

From 1992 to 1999 he was Chairman of the Council on Tribunals. In the House of Lords, in 1998 he successfully proposed an amendment to the Crime and Disorder Bill which abolished the death penalty for treason. The same year, he was appointed chair of the Enemy Property Claims Assessment Panel, a compensation fund for claims from families of Holocaust victims whose assets in Britain had been seized. He also chaired an independent inquiry which began in 2007 and reported in 2009, into how people had been given contaminated blood.

He was described as being an &quot;extremely active&quot; member of the Fabian Society, sitting on their executive committee between 1974 and 1986 and was chairman between 1980 and 1981. From 1993 until his death, he was their President, and over the same period served as President of Uniting for Peace (formerly the World Disarmament Campaign), and of the One World Trust.

==Personal life==
Archer was a Methodist local preacher. He married Margaret Smith in 1954 and they had one son. At the time of his death, he lived in Wraysbury, Berkshire.

On 14 June 2012, Archer died at the Royal Berkshire Hospital from bronchopneumonia and viral encephalitis; he was 85. Upon his death, he was described as being a &quot;vigorous campaigner&quot; for human rights who had a commitment to world government. Paying tribute to him in &quot;The Independent&quot;, Tam Dalyell said: &quot;Archer was one of those rare politicians who made judgements and whose actions followed what he believed to be right and eschewed what was wrong. ... Archer was an idealist, but an idealist with his feet on the ground, commanding respect and using every moment of his long public life constructively.&quot;

<text>Clouds and the Earth&#x27;s Radiant Energy System (CERES) is an NASA climatological experiment from Earth orbit. The CERES are scientific satellite instruments, part of the NASA&#x27;s Earth Observing System (EOS), designed to measure both solar-reflected and Earth-emitted radiation from the top of the atmosphere (TOA) to the Earth&#x27;s surface. Cloud properties are determined using simultaneous measurements by other EOS instruments such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Results from the CERES and other NASA missions, such as the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), could enable nearer to real-time tracking of Earth&#x27;s energy imbalance (EEI) and better understanding of the role of clouds in global climate change.

==Scientific goals==

CERES experiment has four main objectives:

* Continuation of the ERBE record of radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) for climate change analysis.
* Doubling the accuracy of estimates of radiative fluxes at TOA and the Earth&#x27;s surface.
* Provide the first long-term global estimates of the radiative fluxes within the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.
* Provide cloud property estimates that are consistent with the radiative fluxes from surface to TOA.

Each CERES instrument is a radiometer which has three channels – a shortwave (SW) channel to measure reflected sunlight in 0.2–5 μm region, a channel to measure Earth-emitted thermal radiation in the 8–12 μm &quot;window&quot; or &quot;WN&quot; region, and a Total channel to measure entire spectrum of outgoing Earth&#x27;s radiation (&gt;0.2 μm). The CERES instrument was based on the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment which used three satellites to provide global energy budget measurements from 1984 to 1993.

==Missions==

===First launch===
The first CERES instrument Proto-Flight Module (PFM) was launched aboard the NASA Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) in November 1997 from Japan. However, this instrument failed to operate after 8 months due to an on-board circuit failure.

===CERES on the EOS and JPSS mission satellites===
An additional six CERES instruments were launched on the Earth Observing System and the Joint Polar Satellite System. The Terra satellite, launched in December 1999, carried two (Flight Module 1 (FM1) and FM2) and the Aqua satellite, launched in May 2002, carried two more (FM3 and FM4). A fifth instrument (FM5) was launched on the Suomi NPP satellite in October 2011 and a sixth (FM6) on NOAA-20 in November 2017. With the failure of the PFM on TRMM and the 2005 loss of the SW channel of FM4 on Aqua, there are five of the CERES Flight Modules that are fully operational as of 2017.

===Radiation Budget Instruments===
The measurements of the CERES instruments was to be furthered by the Radiation Budget Instrument (RBI) to be launched on Joint Polar Satellite System-2 (JPSS-2) in 2021, JPSS-3 in 2026, and JPSS-4 in 2031. The project was cancelled on January 26, 2018; NASA cited technical, cost, and schedule issues and the impact of anticipated RBI cost growth on other programs.

===Libera===
NASA announced in February 2020 its selection of the Libera instrument to launch on JPSS-3 by the end of 2027. Libera is planned to provide data continuity and updated capabilities. LASP is the lead instrument developer.

==Operating modes==

CERES operates in three scanning modes: across the satellite ground track (cross-track), along the direction of the satellite ground track (along-track), and in a Rotating Azimuth Plane (RAP). In RAP mode, the radiometers scan in elevation as they rotate in azimuth, thus acquiring radiance measurement from a wide range of viewing angles. Until February 2005, on Terra and Aqua satellites one of CERES instruments scanned in cross-track mode while the other was in RAP or along-track mode. The instrument operating in RAP scanning mode took two days of along-track data every month. However the multi-angular CERES data allowed to derive new models which account for anisotropy of the viewed scene, and allow TOA radiative flux retrieval with enhanced precision.

All CERES instruments are in Sun-synchronous orbit. Comparable geostationary data between 60°S and 60°N are also applied within &quot;balanced and filled&quot; data products to provide a diurnally complete representation of the radiation budget and to account for cloud changes between CERES observation times.

==Calibration methods==

The CERES instruments were designed to provide enhanced measurement stability and precision, however achieving and ensuring absolute accuracy over time was also known to remain as an ongoing challenge. Despite the more advanced capability of CERES to monitor Earth&#x27;s TOA radiative fluxes globally and with relative accuracy, the only practical way to estimate the absolute magnitude of EEI (as of year 2020) is through an inventory of the changes of energy in the climate system. Consequently, an important constraint within CERES data products has been the anchoring of EEI at one point in time to a value which corresponds to several years of ARGO data. 

===Ground absolute calibration===

For a climate data record (CDR) mission like CERES, accuracy is of high importance and achieved for pure infrared nighttime measurements by use of a ground laboratory SI traceable blackbody to determine total and WN channel radiometric gains. This however was not the case for CERES solar channels such as SW and solar portion of the Total telescope, which have no direct un-broken chain to SI traceability. This is because CERES solar responses were measured on ground using lamps whose output energy were estimated by a cryo-cavity reference detector, which used a silver Cassegrain telescope identical to CERES devices to match the satellite instrument field of view. The reflectivity of this telescope built and used since the mid-1990s was never actually measured, estimated only based on witness samples (see slide 9 of Priestley et al. (2014)). Such difficulties in ground calibration, combined with suspected on-ground contamination events have resulted in the need to make unexplained ground to flight changes in SW detector gains as big as 8%, simply to make the ERB data seem somewhat reasonable to climate science (note that CERES currently claims a one sigma SW absolute accuracy of 0.9%).

===In-flight calibration===

CERES spatial resolution at nadir view (equivalent diameter of the footprint) is 10 km for CERES on TRMM, and 20 km for CERES on Terra and Aqua satellites. Perhaps of greater importance for missions such as CERES is calibration stability, or the ability to track and partition instrumental changes from Earth data so it tracks true climate change with confidence. CERES onboard calibration sources intended to achieve this for channels measuring reflected sunlight include solar diffusers and tungsten lamps. However the lamps have very little output in the important ultraviolet wavelength region where degradation is greatest and they have been seen to drift in energy by over 1.4% in ground tests, without a capability to monitor them on-orbit (Priestley et al. (2001)). The solar diffusers have also degraded greatly in orbit such that they have been declared unusable by Priestley et al. (2011). A pair of black body cavities that can be controlled at different temperatures are used for the Total and WN channels, but these have not been proved stable to better than 0.5%/decade. Cold space observations and internal calibration are performed during normal Earth scans.

===Intercalibration===
Data is compared between CERES instruments on different mission satellites, as well as compared to scan reference data from accompanying spectroradiometers (e.g. MODIS on Aqua). The planned CLARREO Pathfinder mission aims to provide a state-of-the-art reference standard for several existing EOS instruments including CERES.

A study of annual changes to Earth&#x27;s energy imbalance (EEI) spanning 2005-2019 showed good agreement between the CERES observation and EEI inferred from in-situ measurements of ocean heat uptake by the Argo float network. A concurrent pair of studies measuring global ocean heat uptake, ice melting and sea level rise with a combination of space altimetry and gravimetry suggested similar agreements.

<doc id="471135" wikidata="Q333607" url="?curid=471135" title="Jack Ashley, Baron Ashley of Stoke">
<text>Jack Ashley, Baron Ashley of Stoke (6 December 1922 – 20 April 2012) was a British politician. He was a Labour Member of Parliament in the House of Commons for Stoke-on-Trent South for 26 years, from 1966 to 1992, and subsequently sat in the House of Lords. He was a long-term campaigner for disabled people.

== Early life and education ==
Ashley was born in Widnes, Lancashire and educated at Warrington Road School. He left school at 14 to work in the chemical process industry. He became a crane driver and was a shop steward in the Chemical Workers&#x27; Union, a union of which he was the youngest executive member aged 22. He served in the British Army in the Second World War, and then won a scholarship to study at Ruskin College, where he received a Diploma in Economics and Political Science in 1948.

He continued his studies at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he was President of the Cambridge Union Society in 1951. He worked as a research worker for the National Union of General and Municipal Workers and then worked as a radio producer for the North American Service and BBC Home Service. In 1956 he joined the BBC television service and worked as a producer on &quot;Panorama&quot; and &quot;Monitor&quot;.

== Member of Parliament ==
He served on Widnes Borough Council as a councillor from 1946. At the 1951 general election, Ashley contested Finchley without success. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Stoke-on-Trent South at the 1966 general election. In December 1967, at the age of 45, as a result of complications of a routine ear operation to correct a mild hearing loss caused by a perforated eardrum early in his working career, he became profoundly deaf. He described the event as &quot;rather like being struck by lightning&quot;. He initially thought that he should resign his seat, but instead undertook a course in lip-reading. He returned to the House of Commons, the United Kingdom&#x27;s first totally deaf MP, reportedly a world first for an elected assembly. Later, he used a palantype transcription system developed by Alan Newell, Andrew Downton and others at the University of Southampton – this allowed a palantype secretary seated in the public gallery to type what was being said in real time and Ashley could read the transcribed English text from a discreetly-placed monitor at his seat.

The first known use of the term &quot;domestic violence&quot; in a modern context, meaning violence in the home, was by Ashley in an address to Parliament in 1973 in which he noted the pioneering work of campaigner Erin Pizzey, founder of the first domestic violence shelter. The term previously referred primarily to civil unrest, violence from within a country as opposed to violence perpetrated by a foreign power.

== Disability campaigner ==
He became a tireless campaigner for disabled people, especially those who were deaf or blind, and won broad cross-party sympathy, support and respect in parliament for his approach. In 1972, he sponsored the pivotal motion in the House of Commons making a distinction between legal and moral obligation. The success of this enabled &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; to continue its moral campaign for improved compensation for children disabled by thalidomide even while the parents&#x27; legal case was still technically in the courts. His Labour colleague Alf Morris (later Lord Morris of Manchester) was also a supporter. The editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Harold Evans, later wrote in &quot;Good Times, Bad Times&quot; how Ashley selflessly gave up writing his autobiography so as to concentrate on the thalidomide campaign. He also campaigned for compensation for vaccine damage and for damage caused by the arthritis drug Opren. He became a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 1975 New Year Honours, and joined the Privy Council in 1979.

He also received a Doctor of Humane Letters from the Gallaudet University, the world&#x27;s only university for the deaf, in 1975 for his efforts on behalf of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons.

Ashley&#x27;s ability to follow the proceedings of the House of Commons helped inspire the development of live captioning on television to benefit the deaf and hard-of-hearing. He had the ability to read the output from the stenographers who were reporting the debates. When Ashley visited the BBC&#x27;s Ceefax department around 1975, this ability gave one of the staff the idea of commissioning a Southampton University doctoral student to develop a computer programme that would convert stenographic output to normal printed text as subtitles to television programmes. Later, Ashley also used the technique to follow parliamentary debates on a small monitor .

Ashley received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1979.

In 1986, Ashley and his wife founded the charity Defeating Deafness, now known as Deafness Research UK. He retired from the House of Commons at the 1992 general election and was created a life peer as Baron Ashley of Stoke, &quot;of Widnes in the County of Cheshire&quot; on 10 July 1992. 

He received a cochlear implant in 1993 which restored much of his hearing. In 1996, he founded the Graham Fraser foundation in memory of Graham Fraser, the procedure&#x27;s pioneer in the United Kingdom, in order to fund hearing loss research.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in October 1974 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews while playing badminton in the back garden of his home in Epsom.

== Personal life ==
Ashley married Pauline Kay Crispin (1932–2003) in 1951; she died aged 70 in Surrey. They had three daughters, including journalist Jackie Ashley. His son-in-law was television presenter Andrew Marr through Marr&#x27;s marriage to Jackie.

Ashley contracted pneumonia, and died on 20 April 2012, at the age of 89.

<text>The Order of the Dragon (, literally &quot;Society of the Dragonists&quot;) was a monarchical chivalric order only for selected higher aristocracy and monarchs, founded in 1408 by Sigismund of Luxembourg, who was then King of Hungary and Croatia (r. 1387–1437) and later also Holy Roman Emperor (r. 1433–1437). It was fashioned after the military orders of the Crusades, requiring its initiates to defend the cross and fight the enemies of Christianity, particularly the Ottoman Empire.

The Order flourished during the first half of the 15th century, primarily in Germany and Italy. After Sigismund&#x27;s death in 1437, its importance declined in Western Europe. However, after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, it continued to play a role in Hungary, Serbia and Romania, which bore the brunt of the Ottoman incursions. The Prince of Wallachia Vlad II Dracul, the father of Vlad the Impaler, took his name from the Order of the Dragon.

==Historical background==

Sigismund faced fierce struggles for power leading up to the foundation of the order in 1408. In 1387, the Bohemian royal son Sigismund of Luxembourg was elected King of Hungary and Croatia, a title which he owed chiefly to his marriage to Queen Mary of Hungary in 1385. During the next decade, he constantly sought support or employed ruthless methods to strengthen his unsteady hold on the throne. His rule was weakened in 1395 when Mary, who was pregnant, died in a horse riding accident. In 1389, the Ottoman Sultan Murad I fought Lazar, Prince of Serbia at the Battle of Kosovo Polje, in which both leaders died, leading to an uncertain outcome of the battle. Two years later, the Turks had taken the Bulgarian fortress of Nicopolis.

In 1396, Pope Boniface IX proclaimed a crusade against the Ottomans, and a campaign was organised to liberate Bulgaria from the Turks, save Constantinople, and put a halt to the Ottoman expansion. Sigismund was nominally in charge; however, in the 1396 Battle of Nicopolis the French leader, John of Nevers, commanded the French half of the forces and ignored Sigismund&#x27;s entreaties by charging the Turks. About 12,000 crusaders died with only a few leaders, including Sigismund, escaping. Sigismund returned to Hungary in 1401 and, facing a number of revolts, gradually resumed control and re-asserted himself as the King of Hungary. This was achieved by allying himself with the political party of Stibor of Stiboricz, Nicholas II Garay, and Hermann II of Celje, in return for their military support, which enabled him to fight off domestic rivals. Sigismund campaigned against the Croatian nobility in Slavonia, but the brunt of the campaign was directed at Bosnians and their nobility south of the Sava which culminated in 1408 with the Battle of Dobor in Usora. In the aftermath of this battle, and events unfolding in what is known as the Bloody Sabor of Križevci, 171 members of Bosnian nobility were also massacred. His pact with Hermann II was secured in 1408, when Sigismund married Herman II&#x27;s daughter Barbara.

==Foundation and purpose==
On December 12, 1408, Sigismund and his queen, Barbara von Cilli, founded the league known today as the Order of the Dragon. Its statutes, written in Latin, call it a society () whose members carry the &quot;signum draconis&quot; (see below), but assign no name to it. Contemporary records, however, refer to the order by a variety of similar if unofficial names, such as &quot;Gesellschaft mit dem Drachen&quot;, &quot;Divisa seu Societas Draconica&quot;, &quot;Societas Draconica seu Draconistarum&quot;, and &quot;Fraternitas Draconum&quot;. It was to some extent modelled after the earlier Hungarian monarchical order, the Order of St. George (&quot;Societas militae Sancti Georgii&quot;), founded by King Charles I of Hungary in 1318, the grandfather of Sigismund&#x27;s first wife Mary. The order adopted Saint George as its patron saint, whose legendary defeat of a dragon was used as a symbol for the military and religious ethos of the order.

The aim of the order was to fight the Ottoman Empire, defend the Hungarian monarchy from foreign and domestic enemies, and the Catholic Church from heretics and pagans. It also included foreigners (and non-Catholics), such as the Orthodox Serbian ruler Stefan Lazarević and the Wallachian rulers.

The primary representatives of &quot;the perfidious Enemy&quot; remained the Ottoman Turks, who continued to be a problem for Sigismund&#x27;s successors. The Order&#x27;s outward focus on foreign threats was also aimed at achieving a level of domestic cohesion. The statutes go on to describe the order&#x27;s symbols of the &quot;ouroboros&quot; and the red cross, which were worn by its members and gave the order its corporate identity (see below). They also list the mutual obligations of the king and his nobles. The members were to swear loyalty to the king, queen, and their future sons and to protect the royal interests. Boulton argues that &quot;the Society of the Dragon was clearly intended to serve [...] as the institutional embodiment of the royal faction its founder had created&quot;. In return for their services, the nobles could expect to enjoy royal protection, honors, and offices.

The creation of the order was an instance within a larger fashion of founding chivalric orders during the 14th and early 15th centuries, not infrequently dedicated to organizing &quot;crusades&quot;, especially after the disaster of the Battle of Nicopolis (1396). Sigismund&#x27;s order was particularly inspired from the Order of Saint George of 1326. Another influential model may have been the Sicilian Order of the Ship, founded in 1381.

The statute of the Order, which was expanded by Bishop Eberhard of Nagyvárad, chancellor of Sigismund&#x27;s court, survives only in a copy made in 1707, which was published in an edition in 1841. The prologue to these statutes of 1408 reports that the society was created:

in company with the prelates, barons, and magnates of our kingdom, whom we invite to participate with us in this party, by reason of the sign and effigy of our pure inclination and intention to crush the pernicious deeds of the same perfidious Enemy, and of the followers of the ancient Dragon, and (as one would expect) of the pagan knights, schismatics, and other nations of the Orthodox faith, and those envious of the Cross of Christ, and of our kingdoms, and of his holy and saving religion of faith, under the banner of the triumphant Cross of Christ...

==Symbol and other artifacts==


The edict of 1408 describes two insignia to be worn by members of the Order:

...we and the faithful barons and magnates of our kingdom shall bear and have, and do choose and agree to wear and bear, in the manner of society, the sign or effigy of the Dragon incurved into the form of a circle, its tail winding around its neck, divided through the middle of its back along its length from the top of its head right to the tip of its tail, with blood [forming] a red cross flowing out into the interior of the cleft by a white crack, untouched by blood, just as and in the same way that those who fight under the banner of the glorious martyr St George are accustomed to bear a red cross on a white field...

The dragon described here, with its tail coiled around its neck, bears comparison to the ouroboros. On the back of the dragon, from the base of the neck to the tail, is the Red Cross of Saint George, with the entire image on an &quot;argent&quot; field. The Order&#x27;s dragon emblem has not survived in any original form, but it has been referenced on coins, art, and in writing. An embroidered badge from c.1430 is found at the Bavarian National Museum.

A University of Bucharest annotation to the original edict reads &quot;O Quam Misericors est Deus, Pius et Justus&quot; (O how merciful is God, faithful and just), which may have been officially part of the emblem. The various classes of the order had a slight variation of the dragon symbol. Common changes included the addition of inscriptions like &quot;O Quam Misericors est Deus&quot; (&quot;Oh, how merciful is God&quot;) and &quot;Justus et Paciens&quot; (&quot;Just and patient&quot;). One of the highest classes may have worn a necklace with a seal, while a period painting of Oswald von Wolkenstein depicts another type of class variation.

Few historical artifacts of the Order now remain. A copy, dating to 1707, of the statutes of 1408 is the oldest known literary artifact of the society.

==Membership==

Members of the order are referred to in the statutes as barons (&quot;barones&quot;, occasionally &quot;socii&quot;). They were mostly Sigismund&#x27;s political allies and supporters, who were at first largely confined to the political factions of Stefan Lazarević, Nicholas II Garai, and Hermann II of Celje, including such magnates as Stibor of Stiboricz and Pippo Spano. The initial group of inductees for Sigismund&#x27;s Order numbered 21 men, which extended to about 24 in 1418.

After some time, Sigismund chose to expand the ranks of the Order. A second group of inductees was initiated between 1431 and 1437. As membership grew, the Order of the Dragon came to have two degrees. There was a superior class, which between 1408 and 1418 wore both the dragon and the cross as the Order&#x27;s emblem and a more elaborate version afterwards. The second degree had a large number of members, and its symbol was only the dragon.

Following Sigismund&#x27;s death in 1437, the Order lost prominence. However, the prestigious emblem of the Order was retained on the coat of arms of several Hungarian noble families, including Báthory, Bocskai, Bethlen, Szathmáry, Benyovszky, Kende and Rákóczi.

<text>Floris is a 1969 Dutch action television series starring Rutger Hauer and Jos Bergman, written by Gerard Soeteman, and directed by Paul Verhoeven.

==Concept==
The success of television series like the British &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, the French &quot;Thierry La Fronde&quot; and the Flemish &quot;Johan en de Alverman&quot; inspired , manager of NTS (forerunner of NTR) to make a similar series, set in the Netherlands. It was written by Gerard Soeteman. The series was filmed in black and white, and has been aired in reruns through the years. It has also been shown in East Germany and (dubbed in English) in Scotland.

===Storyline===
In the early 16th century, during the Guelders Wars (1502-1543), the knight Floris van Roozemond (spelling varies with o/oo, s/z and d/dt), accompanied by the Indian Sindala (Bergman), returns home from a trip around the world only to find his castle occupied by Maarten van Rossum, the commander in chief of Charles, Duke of Guelders. Charles, who controls Guelders, is involved in a power struggle against Philip the Handsome who rules the Burgundian Netherlands, the rest of the Low Countries. Floris had so far been neutral due to his absence, but after he finds his castle stolen, he sides with Wolter van Oldenstein, who is allied with Burgundy against Charles. Charles and Maarten are aided by the Frisian pirate Greate Pier partly as an ally, and partly to do the dirty work.

==Historicity==
Apart from Sindala and Floris, all the characters are based on historical figures. A divergence from history is the presence of the pirate Greate Pier: although a contemporary, he was not active as a pirate before the death of Philip the Handsome. In the series, Pier is either guarded or surrounded by members of the Arumer Zwarte Hoop (called &quot;Gelderse Friezen&quot; in the series).

Although intended as a children&#x27;s series, it was very popular with adults; for example, Floris&#x27;s sword fight with two swords in the castle in the first episode looks surprisingly realistic. The series also had an educational element: customs, like timekeeping with bells, and the origin of words such as &quot;vernagelen&quot; (&#x27;to spike down&#x27;), are explained by example. While Floris is portrayed as a typical knight-hero – not too bright but a good swordsman – Sindala is the clever one, using Oriental scientific knowledge for practical applications (which also had educational value).

Locations included the medieval castles of Doornenburg, Loevestein and Hernen, all in the Dutch province of Gelderland (part of historical Guelders), and the Belgian cities Bruges and Ghent.

==Production==
Finding actors for the series was not easy because television was still regarded as inferior to the theatre. Hauer was introduced to Verhoeven as &quot;maybe not such a good actor, but he will do and dare anything&quot;. Verhoeven was indeed worried about Hauer&#x27;s lack of acting experience, but he looked good physically, could handle swords and ride horses well and did most of his stunts himself. The original name of the series was &quot;Floris and the Fakir&quot; and Verhoeven used two shot filming just in case. Hauer learned the TV acting fast enough.

For the time it was a major production with 80 actors and 2500 extras. Verhoeven overspent the budget of 355,000 guilders by more than 300% (the total production costs cannot be calculated exactly anymore, but are estimated to be ƒ1,200,000 or €545,000). When this became clear, it was already too late to stop the production because Verhoeven used &quot;vertical planning&quot;, in which the filming was done per actor instead of per episode. Stopping the production would mean that all work was lost. As a TV production of this scale had never been done before in the Netherlands, there was a lot of pioneering. Recordings were usually made in the studio, but &quot;Floris&quot; was mostly shot outside. Everyone on the set, including Verhoeven, had to learn the trade as they went. Tasks were also not strictly delineated, like they are these days; everyone was a bit of a jack of all trades. &quot;We didn&#x27;t stand with our arms folded smoking a cigarette when it wasn&#x27;t our turn.&quot; Ironically, finding good locations for this TV production was difficult because the popularity of television had resulted in potential shooting locations spoiled by the television antennas that had by then become ubiquitous.

===Collaboration===
The series was the first major undertaking of both Hauer and Verhoeven, as well as their first collaboration. It was followed by &quot;Turkish Delight&quot; (&quot;Turks Fruit&quot;) and &quot;Soldier of Orange&quot; (&quot;Soldaat van Oranje&quot;); ideas not used for the series were later included in the film &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;, also directed by Verhoeven with Hauer in the lead role (which also proved to be their final collaboration).

==Related media==
===Export===
The series was sold for redubbing to channels in the UK and also to East Germany. In the UK, the series aired on Yorkshire Television in 1970 as &quot;The Adventures of Floris&quot;. None of the English dubbed episodes survive.

===Audio plays===
Two of the unproduced scripts were produced as audio plays; they seem to be the same adventures as #6 and #8 of the newspaper comic adventures and #7 and #10 of the German remake.

===Text stories===
Photo-illustrated text stories of two episodes were serialised in the short-lived comic magazine &quot;Jamin Junior&quot; during 1972. These were &quot;De Wonderdoener&quot; (Nummers 1–14) and &quot;De Zwarte Kogels&quot; (Nummers 15–26). As publication of &quot;Jamin Junior&quot; was terminated rather suddenly, it is believed the second adaptation remained unfinished.

===Newspaper comics===
Starting in 1972 15 scripts for the &quot;Floris&quot; series (not taken into production) were made into newspaper comics published in &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; by Gerrit Stapel. The art and dialogue were Stapel&#x27;s, but the story Soeteman&#x27;s, so the newspaper comics should be considered a canonical source of information about Floris&#x27;s further adventures. Most important event in the comics is that Floris regains ownership of castle Rozenmondt in the 7th comics adventure.

===German remake===
1975 saw a West German remake of the series, &quot;Floris von Rosemund&quot;, again starring Rutger Hauer, but with German actor Derval de Faria as Sindala. This version, directed by Austrian director Ferry Radax, put much more emphasis on the comedic aspects of the stories and provided the female characters Ada and Viola with larger parts than the original. Strangely enough the East German dub of the original Dutch, black and white, series was made two years after this, in 1977.

===DVD===
The original series has been released on DVD, as has the German remake; neither edition has any other languages or subtitles. However, fan made English subtitles exist for the Dutch series and all of its documentaries.

===Film adaptation===
The movie &quot;Floris&quot; (2004) was shot in 2003. It was directed by Jean van de Velde and features Michiel Huisman as the grandson of the original Floris. The new side-kick is Pi, a role played by pop star Birgit Schuurman. Some of the footage from the 1969 series with Hauer and Bergman is included. Hauer was originally asked to play the father of young Floris, but he declined.

===Recovery of unfinished episodes===
Some material had been filmed for two episodes which were never completed after the project was ended: &quot;Het Gericht&quot; (the tribunal), and &quot;De Bouwmeester&quot; (The Architect). The former&#x27;s screenplay had been used for the German remake as well. In 2016 the raw footage was found. While &quot;The architect&quot; amounted to only a few minutes, &quot;The tribunal&quot; was assembled, and ran just over 18 minutes when linked with panels from the newspaper comic strip and narration where necessary to make up for the missing material. It was then shown at Doornenburg Castle, one of the old locations. All the material of both unfinished episodes was later made available online through a regional Guelders broadcaster.

<doc id="471145" wikidata="Q337106" url="?curid=471145" title="Eric Lubbock, 4th Baron Avebury">
<text>Eric Reginald Lubbock, 4th Baron Avebury (29 September 1928 – 14 February 2016), was an English politician and human rights campaigner. He served as the Liberal Member of Parliament for Orpington from 1962 to 1970. He then served in the House of Lords, having inherited the title of Baron Avebury in 1971, until his death. In 1999, when most hereditary peers were removed from the House of Lords, he was elected by his fellow Liberal Democrats to remain. When he died, he was the longest serving Liberal Democrat peer.

==Early life and career==
A descendant of William Lubbock (1701–1754), he was born in Chelsea, London, the son of Maurice Fox Pitt Lubbock (the sixth son of John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury) and Mary Katherine Adelaide Stanley, daughter of Arthur Stanley, 5th Baron Stanley of Alderley.

Lubbock was educated at Upper Canada College, an all-boys private school in Toronto, Canada, and at Harrow School, an all-boys public school in London. He read Engineering Science at Balliol College, Oxford.

He served as a Lieutenant in the Welsh Guards and joined Rolls-Royce in 1951. At the company, he was employed as a production manager (1951–1956) and as a production engineer (1956–1960).

==Parliamentary career==
Having joined the Liberal Party in 1960 and become a councillor the following year, Lubbock stood as his party&#x27;s candidate at the Orpington by-election on 15 March 1962, and gained the seat with a majority of 7,855, a swing of nearly 22% from the Conservatives. At the time, the victory was seen as a revival of the Liberal Party, and brought the number of Liberal MPs to seven. Lubbock was dubbed &quot;Orpington Man&quot;. However, the party did not make the anticipated recovery. It was hampered by organisational difficulties, and progress was slow, with a loss of votes and seats during the period of Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour government.

Lubbock held Orpington in 1964 and 1966, both times against Guinness World Records founder Norris McWhirter. &quot;When I beat McWhirter for the second time in 1966&quot;, Lubbock said in 2015, &quot;he said at the count that he now realised that the people in Orpington were only interested in their back gardens. And I was very pleased by that because it confirmed my attempts to look after people&#x27;s local concerns.&quot;

As the MP for Orpington, Lubbock was appointed Chief Whip by Jo Grimond in 1963, a post he held until 1970. When Grimond resigned as party leader in 1967, Lubbock was one of the three Liberal MPs who stood for the position. Jeremy Thorpe won the contest with six votes, with Emlyn Hooson and Lubbock getting three apiece.

As the only Liberal on the Speaker&#x27;s Conference on Electoral Reform from 1963 to 1965, he attempted to reduce the voting age to 18 and to introduce the Single Transferable Vote system of Proportional Representation for general elections.

Lubbock initiated the Caravan Sites Act 1968 as a Private member&#x27;s bill, which mandated that councils assess and provide for the needs of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller people passing through their boroughs, in order to provide unused land for them to camp on. 324 sites were created in all, but many councils &quot;delayed, minimized or completely avoided provision of the sites for Gypsies in England.&quot; The perceived ineffectiveness of the Act led to its repeal by the Conservative government in 1994.

In the Commons, Lubbock was on the Speaker&#x27;s Commission on Electoral Law (1964–1966), and proposed STV in multi-member constituencies, only to be voted down by 18–1. He also proposed reducing the voting age to 18, and two Labour Members supported him. Orpington reverted to being a Conservative seat at the 1970 general election. On losing the seat Lubbock said, &quot;In 1962 the wise, far-seeing people of Orpington elected me as their Member; in 1970 the fools threw me out&quot; (it is sometimes reported he said &quot;the bloody fools&quot;).

The following year, John Lubbock, 3rd Baron Avebury, died without a male heir and Eric Lubbock, his cousin, succeeded him. As Baron Avebury, he sat on the Royal Commission on Standards of Conduct in Public Life (1974–1976), and was Liberal Spokesman on Immigration and Race Relations (1971–1983). Throughout his time in politics he was involved in human rights activism, both in and beyond Parliament. In 1976, he founded the Parliamentary Human Rights Group, which he chaired for the next 21 years. He continued as Vice-Chair after standing down.

In 1974, Avebury was asked by Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe to lead the Liberal general election campaign that year.

In 1987, as a jocular protest against the cost of cremation, he offered to leave his body to Battersea dogs home &quot;to vary the inmates&#x27; diet.&quot; Bill Wadman-Taylor, manager of the home, said: &quot;I am sure there is a lot of nutritional value in the noble Lord and the dogs are not fussy, but we just couldn&#x27;t do it.&quot; On being advised that the dogs would probably accept but the home&#x27;s management wouldn&#x27;t, he made the same offer to the cats.

He was a member of the Liberal Democrat Foreign Affairs Team, speaking on conflict resolution and human rights.

== Human rights ==
In a 2014 &quot;Huffington Post&quot; article, Avebury noted that &quot;When I founded the Parliamentary Human Rights group in 1976, I hoped to work with recently independent countries to promote the UN&#x27;s treaties on civil and political rights.&quot; He chaired the group until 1997 and served as Vice-chair until his death, along with the Labour MP and former leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Following Avebury&#x27;s death, Corbyn described him as a &quot;Great friend, brave and determined human rights campaigner who dedicated his life to rights of all.&quot;

Avebury was a keen advocate of human rights and the separation of church and state. He was as a patron of the British Humanist Association and an honorary associate of the National Secular Society, which awarded him Secularist of the Year 2009 for his role alongside Evan Harris in the abolition of blasphemous libel. In September 2010, Avebury, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter for the British Humanist Association in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s state visit to the UK.

Avebury visited Eastern Turkey, Syria and Iraq during the 1990s on fact-finding missions to investigate human rights abuses against the Kurdish minority groups in those countries. Subsequent reports published by the Parliamentary Human Rights Group resulted in a ten-year ban from entering Turkey. He was also banned from entering Kashmir and East Timor.

While banned from Turkey, Avebury campaigned against the involvement of UK construction company Balfour Beatty in the Ilisu Dam project in Turkey&#x27;s Kurdish region, appearing on the Mark Thomas Comedy Product in 2001 to talk about the issue. In another episode of Thomas&#x27; series, he described Avebury as &quot;the one Lord of any use and relevance&quot; when describing how they met at a House of Lords meeting on Kurdish rights in Turkey.

He was President of the Peru Support Group, campaigning on human rights issues in Peru, and a Patron of Peace Brigades International, meeting with South American human rights defenders and raising their cases in Parliament. He was a Patron of Prisoners Abroad, a charity that supports the welfare of Britons imprisoned overseas and their families. Lord Avebury was a Co-Chair of the CHT (Chittagong Hill Tracts) Commission, which monitors the implementation of the CHT Peace Accord by the Bangladesh Government, and a member of the All Party Parliamentary Humanist Group.

He frequently raised matters related to British nationality law in Parliament. He was a strong supporter of the citizenship rights of the solely British ethnic minorities in Hong Kong, and fought for their rights.
In 1964 he sought a review of the Timothy Evans case. Evans was subsequently granted a posthumous pardon.

In recognition of his lifetime human rights work, Lubbock was made the inaugural recipient of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace Prize at the National Peace Symposium hosted at the Baitul Futuh Mosque in South London in 2009.

Writing for Travellers&#x27; Times, the writer and artist Damian Le Bas noted Avebury&#x27;s 50-year commitment to improving the lives of the Gypsy, Roma, Traveller community in the UK, calling him &quot;one of the greatest friends the Travellers ever had.&quot;

Avebury was a board member of the Gulf Center for Human Rights. Its chairperson, Maryam Alkhawaja, noted on his death that &quot;Lord Eric Avebury supported Bahraini activists when no one else would, and continued to support the next generation of activists throughout the years. He died on the fifth anniversary of the Bahraini uprising, and I know that many of us will carry his memory with us throughout the struggle.&quot;

As a backbench Liberal Democrat peer in the House of Lords during the 2010–2015 parliament, he repeatedly voted against his own party on issues like the Bedroom Tax, which he opposed, and cuts to Legal Aid.

The Dictionary of Liberal Biography called Avebury &quot;a scourge of tyrants in Central and South America, Asia and Africa&quot;, noting that he had been detained twice while pursuing human rights causes in Sri Lanka and Guyana.

===Maurice Lubbock Memorial Fund===
Trained as an engineer, Lord Avebury retained an interest in science and engineering. Together with his mother in 1957, he set up the Maurice Lubbock Memorial Fund to commemorate his father, following his early death. This established a Trust, which he chaired for 56 years, aimed at supporting Engineering and Management at Balliol College, Oxford. The Trust is still active and is one of the longest lasting of such ventures. He was elected to an Honorary Fellowship at Balliol College in 2004.

=== Conservation Society ===
Lubbock was the President of the Conservation Society from 1972 to 1984. During his presidency, he proposed a form of words to introduce the concept of &#x27;sustainable development&#x27; into Article 2 of the Treaty of Rome in a letter to The Times of 20 January 1975. This contributed to the successful debate on changing the wording of Article 2 to include a reference to sustainable development.

<text>Anthony Perrinott Lysberg Barber, Baron Barber, (4 July 1920 – 16 December 2005) was a British Conservative politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1970 to 1974.

After serving in both the Territorial Army and the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, Barber studied at Oxford and became a barrister. Elected as MP for Doncaster in 1951, Barber served in government under Harold Macmillan as Economic Secretary to the Treasury and Financial Secretary to the Treasury, before being appointed Minister of Health by Alec Douglas-Home in 1963. After losing his seat in 1964, he won the 1965 by-election in Altrincham and Sale and returned to Parliament.

Barber was appointed as Chancellor of the Exchequer by Edward Heath in 1970, and oversaw a major liberalisation of the banking system, replaced purchase tax and Selective Employment Tax with Value Added Tax, and also relaxed exchange controls. During his term the economy suffered due to stagflation and industrial unrest, including a miners strike which led to the Three-Day Week. In 1972 he delivered a budget which was designed to return the Conservatives to power in an election expected in 1974 or 1975. This budget led to a brief period of growth known as &quot;The Barber Boom,&quot; followed by a wage-price spiral and high inflation, culminating in the 1976 sterling crisis. He was forced to introduce anti-inflation measures, along with a Price Commission and a Pay Board. After the Conservatives lost the first general election of 1974, he did not stand in the second election of that year.

== Birth and early life ==
Barber was born on 4 July 1920 in Kingston upon Hull. He was the third son of John Barber and his Danish wife, Musse. Barber&#x27;s unusual middle names arose from his mother, who contributed the &quot;Lysberg&quot;, and French grandmother, who contributed the &quot;Perrinott&quot;. His father was company secretary and director of a Doncaster confectionery works. He had two brothers: Noel, who became a journalist and novelist, and Kenneth, who became company secretary of Midland Bank.

Barber was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School in Retford, Nottinghamshire. He became an articled clerk in a solicitors&#x27; firm, but joined the King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry shortly before the Second World War started. He was commissioned into the Territorial Army Royal Artillery in 1939 and served in France with a unit from Doncaster as part of the British Expeditionary Force. He was evacuated from Dunkirk in 1940, but later he became a pilot in the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit of the RAF. He ran out of fuel on a reconnaissance mission on 25 January 1942 and ditched near Mont St Jean, but was captured by the Germans.

He was mentioned in dispatches for helping escapees from the prison camp at Stalag Luft III; he himself once escaped as far as Denmark. His PoW experiences were recalled by his friend and fellow RAF pilot PoW Thomas D. Calnan who met Barber at Oflag IX-A/H at Spangenberg in February 1942:

:&quot;Complete uniforms were rare in our party, the one outstanding exception belonging to Tony Barber, who was resplendent in an Army lieutenant&#x27;s uniform, complete with Sam Browne.&quot;

Barber is a prominent figure throughout Calnan&#x27;s book:

:&quot;It was natural that Charles Hall, Tony Barber and I should plot escape together. We had known one another at Benson, before being shot down and we still felt that we all belonged to the same unit.&quot;

Barber also wrote a brief foreword to this volume: &quot;What has struck me most forcibly is how, after more than twenty years, he has recounted our adventures with such accuracy. He has managed to make a reality, once again, of the hopes and fears, the depression and the excitement which, for most of us who were there, now seems more like a dream.&quot;

While still a prisoner, Barber took a law degree with first-class honours from the University of London, through the International Red Cross. On his return to England, he was awarded a state grant to Oxford University, where he took a degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics in two years at Oriel College, and a scholarship to the Inner Temple. He then practised as a barrister from 1948, and specialised in taxation. From 1967 to 1970 he was chairman of Redfearn National Glass, with which his wife Jean&#x27;s family was connected.

== House of Commons ==
Anthony Barber stood in Doncaster at the 1950 general election but lost by 878 votes. He contested the seat again at the 1951 general election, however, and beat the incumbent Labour Member of Parliament, Raymond Gunter by 384 votes. He held a series of offices: Parliamentary private secretary to George Ward (Under Secretary for Air) from 1952 to 1958; junior Government whip from 1955 to 1958; and Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan from 1958 to 1959. He then served four years as a junior minister in the Treasury, Economic Secretary to the Treasury from 1959 to 1962, and, following the &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot; on 13 July 1962, as Financial Secretary to the Treasury from 1962 to 1963 (under the Chancellorships of Derick Heathcoat Amory, Selwyn Lloyd and Reginald Maudling). He became a Cabinet minister, as Minister of Health, in 1963, but lost his seat in the Commons in the 1964 general election to Labour&#x27;s Harold Walker.

His absence from Parliament was short-lived, as four months later he won a 1965 by-election in Altrincham and Sale caused by the elevation to the peerage of Frederick Erroll. In opposition, he led Edward Heath&#x27;s campaign to become Conservative party leader in 1965, and became party chairman in 1967. The Conservatives won the general election in 1970, and Barber held his seat until the general election of October 1974, when he himself entered the House of Lords.

== Chancellor of the Exchequer ==
After winning the election in 1970, Edward Heath appointed Barber as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and gave him the responsibility for negotiating the entry of the UK into the European Economic Community. However, following the sudden death of Iain Macleod on 20 July, only four weeks after the election, Barber became the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, although he was initially reluctant to take the job. His appointment prompted Harold Wilson to remark that it was the first time that he had realised that Heath had a sense of humour. In line with the initial liberal instincts of Heath&#x27;s 1970 government, he oversaw a major liberalisation of the banking system under the title of &#x27;Competition and Credit Control&#x27;, leading to a high level of lending, much of it to speculative property concerns. In his first Budget, in March 1971, he proposed to replace purchase tax and Selective Employment Tax with Value Added Tax, and also relaxed exchange controls; both were prerequisites to membership of the EEC. VAT came into force in 1973 at a standard rate of 10%. A year later, the rate was cut to 8%.

Barber also reduced direct taxes. High levels of economic growth followed, but the traditional capacity constraints of the British economy - especially currency and balance of trade concerns - quickly choked the economic boom. The banking system fell towards crisis as the bubble burst.

During his term the economy suffered due to stagflation and industrial unrest. In 1972 he delivered a budget which was designed to return the Conservative Party to power in an election expected in 1974 or 1975. This budget led to a period known as &quot;The Barber Boom&quot;. The measures in the budget led to high inflation and wage demands from Public Sector workers. He was forced to introduce anti-inflation measures on the 6 November 1972, along with a Price Commission and a Pay Board. The inflation of capital asset values was also followed by the 1973 oil crisis which followed the Yom Kippur War, adding to inflationary pressures in the economy and feeding industrial militancy (already at a high as a result of the struggle over the Industrial Relations Act 1971).

In 1972, having said a week earlier in the House of Commons that he had &quot;no reason to believe that the pound was overvalued&quot;, he floated it (most of the world currencies were floated at that time) &quot;as a temporary measure&quot;. The pound immediately plunged on the markets, and it was impossible during his time as Chancellor to impose a new parity. It has remained floating ever since.

After a strike by the miners, and a Three-Day Week, Heath called for a general election on 28 February 1974 with the slogan &quot;Who governs Britain?&quot; The election returned a minority Labour government and Harold Wilson as Prime Minister.

Barber did not seek re-election at the general election of October 1974, and left front-line politics. He was made a life peer on 6 January 1975 as Baron Barber of Wentbridge in West Yorkshire, and served as Chairman of Standard Chartered Bank from 1974 to 1987, where future Prime Minister John Major was his personal assistant. In 1987, he was appointed to be a Deputy Lieutenant of the County of West Yorkshire. Barber was also a director of BP from 1979 to 1988. He visited Nelson Mandela in prison, and was a member of the Franks Committee that investigated the Falklands War. In 1991, he became chair of the RAF Benevolent Association&#x27;s appeal for the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, which raised £26 million.

==Personal life and death==
In 1950, Barber married Jean Asquith, who was also a Conservative parliamentary candidate in that year&#x27;s election. They had two daughters and were married until her death in 1983. In 1989, he married Rosemary Youens.
Barber suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease in later years, and died from bronchopneumonia at Ipswich Hospital on 16 December 2005.

<text>The multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) is a scientific instrument on the Terra satellite launched by NASA on 18 December 1999. This device is designed to measure the intensity of solar radiation reflected by the Earth system (planetary surface and atmosphere) in various directions and spectral bands; it became operational in February 2000. Data generated by this sensor have been proven useful in a variety of applications including atmospheric sciences, climatology and monitoring terrestrial processes.

The MISR instrument consists of an innovative configuration of nine separate digital cameras that gather data in four different spectral bands of the solar spectrum. One camera points toward the nadir, while the others provide forward and aftward view angles at 26.1°, 45.6°, 60.0°, and 70.5°. As the instrument flies overhead, each region of the Earth&#x27;s surface is successively imaged by all nine cameras in each of four wavelengths (blue, green, red, and near-infrared).

The data gathered by MISR are useful in climatological studies concerning the disposition of the solar radiation flux in the Earth&#x27;s system. MISR is specifically designed to monitor the monthly, seasonal, and long-term trends of atmospheric aerosol particle concentrations including those formed by natural sources and by human activities, upper air winds and cloud cover, type, height, as well as the characterization of land surface properties, including the structure of vegetation canopies, the distribution of land cover types, or the properties of snow and ice fields, amongst many other biogeophysical variables.

<text>Joel Barnett, Baron Barnett, (14 October 1923 – 1 November 2014) was a Labour Party politician. As Chief Secretary to the Treasury in the late 1970s, he devised the Barnett Formula that allocates public spending in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

==Career==
Barnett was born in Manchester, the son of Jewish tailor Louis and wife Ettie, and was educated at Badkindt Hebrew School and Manchester Central High School. He worked as an accountant. He was elected a councillor on Prestwich Borough Council 1956-1959 and was treasurer of Manchester Fabian Society. Barnett stood in Runcorn in 1959 without success. He was elected member of parliament for Heywood and Royton in 1964. He was a member of the Public Accounts Committee from January 1966.

Barnett served as Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 1974 to 1979, gaining a seat in the cabinet from 1977 onwards, and was Denis Healey&#x27;s right-hand man in the Callaghan Government. During this time he oversaw the devising of what is known as the Barnett Formula by which public spending is apportioned between England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. He subsequently joked about the strange and unexpected form of immortality that was accorded to him by &quot;having his own formula&quot;. Following the Scotland Act 1998 and devolution, he argued that the Formula was unfair to England and should be abandoned or revised. He reiterated this view in 2014 shortly before the Scottish independence referendum, calling the Formula unsustainable and saying it had become an embarrassment.

Barnett held the Chairmanship of the Public Accounts Committee from 1979 to 1983. He published a memoir &quot;Inside the Treasury&quot; in 1982, describing his experience as chief secretary. Barnett&#x27;s Commons seat having been abolished by boundary changes, he was created a life peer as Baron Barnett, &quot;of Heywood and Royton in Greater Manchester&quot; on 30 September 1983. He served on select committees in the House of Lords including the European Union Committee, the Economic Affairs Committee and the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England. He was appointed vice-chairman of the Board of Governors of the BBC by Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1986 and held the post until 1993, during which period he partook in the private meeting when Chairman Marmaduke Hussey told Director-General Alasdair Milne he would have to leave the BBC. He died on 1 November 2014, aged 91.

<doc id="471167" wikidata="Q1758065" url="?curid=471167" title="Liquid crystal on silicon">
<text>Liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS or LCOS) is a miniaturized reflective active-matrix liquid-crystal display or &quot;microdisplay&quot; using a liquid crystal layer on top of a silicon backplane. It is also known as a spatial light modulator. LCoS initially was developed for projection televisions, but has since found additional uses in wavelength selective switching, structured illumination, near-eye displays and optical pulse shaping.

LCoS is distinct from other LCD projector technologies which use transmissive LCD, allowing light to pass through the light processing unit (s). LCoS is more similar to DLP micro-mirror displays.

==Technology==

The Hughes liquid crystal light valve (LCLV) was designed to modulate a high-intensity light beam using a weaker light source, conceptually similar to how an amplifier increases the amplitude of an electrical signal; LCLV was named after the common name for the triode vacuum tube. A high-resolution, low-intensity light source (typically a CRT) was used to &quot;write&quot; an image in the photosensor layer, which is energized by a transparent indium tin oxide electrode, driven by an alternating current source at approximately 10 mV. A light-blocking layer prevents the low-intensity writing light from shining through the device; the photosensor and light-blocking layer together form a rectifying junction, producing a DC voltage bias across the liquid crystal layer, transferring the image to the reflecting side by changing the rotation of polarization in the twisted nematic liquid crystal. On the reflecting side, a high-intensity, polarized projection light source reflects selectively from the dielectric mirror based on the polarization within the liquid crystal being controlled by the photosensor. The dielectric mirror is formed by sputtering alternating layers of and , with the final layer etched to align the liquid crystal material. Later development of the LCLV used similar semiconductor materials arranged in the same basic structures.
The LCLV principle is carried forward in a digital LCoS display device, which features an array of pixels, each equivalent to the reflecting side of a single LCLV. These pixels on the LCoS device are driven directly by signals to modulate the intensity of reflected light, rather than a low intensity &quot;writing light&quot; source in the LCLV. For example, a chip with XGA resolution has an array of 1024×768 pixels, each with an independently addressable transistor. In the LCoS device, a complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) chip controls the voltage on square reflective aluminium electrodes buried just below the chip surface, each controlling one pixel. Typical chips are approximately square and approximately thick, with pixel pitch as small as . A common voltage for all the pixels is supplied by a transparent conductive layer made of indium tin oxide on the cover glass.

==Displays==

===History===
The history of LCoS projectors dates back to June 1972, when LCLV technology was first developed by scientists at Hughes Research Laboratories working on an internal research and development project. General Electric demonstrated a low-resolution LCoS display in the late 1970s. LCLV projectors were used primarily for military flight simulators due to their large and bulky size. A joint venture between Hughes Electronics and JVC (Hughes-JVC) was founded in 1992 to develop LCLV technology for commercial movie theaters under the branding ILA (Image Light Amplifer). One example was tall and weighed , using a 7 kW Xenon arc lamp.
In 1997, engineers at JVC developed the D-ILA (Direct-Drive Image Light Amplifier) from the Hughes LCLV, which led to smaller and more affordable digital LCoS projectors, using three-chip D-ILA devices. Although these were not as bright and had less resolution than the cinema ILA projectors, they were more portable, starting at .

The early LCoS projectors had their challenges. They suffered from a phenomenon called &quot;image sticking,&quot; where the image would remain on the screen after it was supposed to be gone. This was due to the mirrors sticking in their positions, which resulted in ghosting on the screen. However, manufacturers continued to refine the technology, and today&#x27;s LCoS projectors have largely overcome this issue.

Sony introduced its SXRD (Silicon X-tal Reflective Display) technology in 2004. SXRD was an evolution of LCoS technology that used even smaller pixels and a higher resolution, resulting in an even more accurate image. The SXRD technology was used in Sony&#x27;s high-end home theater projectors, and it quickly gained a reputation for its exceptional picture quality.
JVC introduced an updated D-ILA technology in 2006, which eliminated the need for a polarizing filter, resulting in a brighter and more vibrant image. The D-ILA technology has since become a popular choice for home theater enthusiasts.

LCoS projectors have continued to evolve, with manufacturers introducing features like 4K resolution and HDR (High Dynamic Range) support. LCoS projectors are now available at a range of price points, from affordable models for home theater use to high-end professional models used in commercial installations.

===Display system architectures===
LCoS display technology is a type of microdisplay that has gained popularity due to its high image quality and ability to display high-resolution images. LCos display systems typically consist of three main components: the LCos panel, the light source, and the optical system.

The LCos panel is the heart of the display system. It consists of an array of pixels that are arranged in a grid pattern. Each pixel is made up of a liquid crystal layer, a reflective layer, and a silicon substrate. The liquid crystal layer controls the polarization of light that passes through it, while the reflective layer reflects the light back towards the optical system. The silicon substrate is used to control the individual pixels and provides the necessary electronics to drive the LCos panel.

The light source is used to provide the necessary illumination for the LCos panel. The most common light source used in LCos display systems is a high-intensity lamp. This lamp emits a broad spectrum of light that is filtered through a color wheel or other optical components to provide the necessary color gamut for the display system.

The optical system is responsible for directing the light from the light source onto the LCos panel and projecting the resulting image onto a screen or other surface. The optical system consists of a number of lenses, mirrors, and other optical components that are carefully designed and calibrated to provide the necessary magnification, focus, and color correction for the display system.
====Three-panel designs====
The white light is separated into three components (red, green and blue) and then combined back after modulation by the 3 LCoS devices. The light is additionally polarized by beam splitters.

====One-panel designs====
Both Toshiba&#x27;s and Intel&#x27;s single-panel LCOS display program were discontinued in 2004 before any units reached final-stage prototype. There were single-panel LCoS displays in production: One by Philips and one by Microdisplay Corporation. Forth Dimension Displays continues to offer a Ferroelectric LCoS display technology (known as Time Domain Imaging) available in QXGA, SXGA and WXGA resolutions which today is used for high resolution near-eye applications such as Training &amp; Simulation, structured light pattern projection for AOI. Citizen Finedevice (CFD) also continues to manufacturer single panel RGB displays using FLCoS technology (Ferroelectric Liquid Crystals). They manufacture displays in multiple resolutions and sizes that are currently used in pico-projectors, electronic viewfinders for high end digital cameras, and head-mounted displays.

===Pico projectors, near-eye and head-mounted displays===
Whilst initially developed for large-screen projectors, LCoS displays have found a consumer niche in the area of pico-projectors, where their small size and low power consumption are well-matched to the constraints of such devices.

LCoS devices are also used in near-eye applications such as electronic viewfinders for digital cameras, film cameras, and head-mounted displays (HMDs). These devices are made using ferroelectric liquid crystals (so the technology is named FLCoS) which are inherently faster than other types of liquid crystals to produce high quality images. Google&#x27;s initial foray into wearable computing, Google glass, also uses a near-eye LCoS display.

At CES 2018, Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute Company Limited (ASTRI) and OmniVision showcased a reference design for a wireless augmented reality headset that could achieve 60 degree field of view (FoV). It combined a single-chip 1080p LCOS display and image sensor from OmniVision with ASTRI&#x27;s optics and electronics. The headset is said to be smaller and lighter than others because of its single-chip design with integrated driver and memory buffer.

==Wavelength-selective switches==

LCoS is particularly attractive as a switching mechanism in a wavelength-selective switch (WSS). LCoS-based WSS were initially developed by Australian company Engana, now part of Finisar. The LCoS can be employed to control the phase of light at each pixel to produce beam-steering where the large number of pixels allow a near continuous addressing capability. Typically, a large number of phase steps are used to create a highly efficient, low-insertion loss switch shown. This simple optical design incorporates polarisation diversity, control of mode size and a 4-f wavelength optical imaging in the dispersive axis of the LCoS providing integrated switching and optical power control.

In operation, the light passes from a fibre array through the polarisation imaging optics which separates physically and aligns orthogonal polarisation states to be in the high efficiency s-polarisation state of the diffraction grating. The input light from a chosen fibre of the array is reflected from the imaging mirror and then angularly dispersed by the grating which is at near Littrow incidence, reflecting the light back to the imaging optics which directs each channel to a different portion of the LCoS. The path for each wavelength is then retraced upon reflection from the LCoS, with the beam-steering image applied on the LCOS directing the light to a particular port of the fibre array. As the wavelength channels are separated on the LCoS the switching of each wavelength is independent of all others and can be switched without interfering with the light on other channels. There are many different algorithms that can be implemented to achieve a given coupling between ports including less efficient &quot;images&quot; for attenuation or power splitting.

WSS based on MEMS and/or liquid crystal technologies allocate a single switching element (pixel) to each channel which means the bandwidth and centre frequency of each channel are fixed at the time of manufacture and cannot be changed in service. In addition, many designs of first-generation WSS (particularly those based on MEMs technology) show pronounced dips in the transmission spectrum between each channel due to the limited spectral ‘fill factor’ inherent in these designs. This prevents the simple concatenation of adjacent channels to create a single broader channel. 

LCoS-based WSS, however, permit dynamic control of channel centre frequency and bandwidth through on-the-fly modification of the pixel arrays via embedded software. The degree of control of channel parameters can be very fine-grained, with independent control of the centre frequency and either upper- or lower-band-edge of a channel with better than 1 GHz resolution possible. This is advantageous from a manufacturability perspective, with different channel plans being able to be created from a single platform and even different operating bands (such as C and L) being able to use an identical switch matrix. Additionally, it is possible to take advantage of this ability to reconfigure channels while the device is operating. Products have been introduced allowing switching between 50 GHz channels and 100 GHz channels, or a mix of channels, without introducing any errors or &quot;hits&quot; to the existing traffic. More recently, this has been extended to support the whole concept of Flexible or Elastic networks under ITU G.654.2 through products such as Finisar&#x27;s &quot;Flexgrid™&quot; WSS.

==Other LCoS applications==

===Optical pulse shaping===
The ability of an LCoS-based WSS to independently control both the amplitude and phase of the transmitted signal leads to the more general ability to manipulate the amplitude and/or phase of an optical pulse through a process known as Fourier-domain pulse shaping. This process requires full characterisation of the input pulse in both the time and spectral domains.

As an example, an LCoS-based Programmable Optical Processor (POP) has been used to broaden a mode-locked laser output into a 20 nm supercontinuum source whilst a second such device was used to compress the output to 400 fs, transform-limited pulses. Passive mode-locking of fiber lasers has been demonstrated at high repetition rates, but inclusion of an LCoS-based POP allowed the phase content of the spectrum to be changed to flip the pulse train of a passively mode-locked laser from bright to dark pulses. A similar approach uses spectral shaping of optical frequency combs to create multiple pulse trains. For example, a 10 GHz optical frequency comb was shaped by the POP to generate dark parabolic pulses and Gaussian pulses, at 1540 nm and 1560 nm, respectively.

=== Light structuring===
Structured light using a fast ferroelectric LCoS is used in 3D-superresolution microscopy techniques and in fringe projection for 3D-automated optical inspection.

===Modal switching in space division multiplexed optical communications systems===

One of the interesting applications of LCoS is the ability to transform between modes of few-moded optical fibers which have been proposed as the basis of higher capacity transmission systems in the future. Similarly LCoS has been used to steer light into selected cores of multicore fiber transmission systems, again as a type of Space Division Multiplexing.

===Tunable lasers===
LCoS has been used as a filtering technique, and hence a tuning mechanism, for both semiconductor diode and fiber lasers.

<doc id="471168" wikidata="Q962754" url="?curid=471168" title="The Best of the Pink Floyd">
<text>The Best of the Pink Floyd, also issued as Masters of Rock, is a compilation album of early Pink Floyd music, concentrating on singles and album tracks from 1967 to 1968.

==Later release==
Later editions titled &quot;Masters of Rock&quot; were released in 1974 in France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, to capitalise on the success of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. It is one of the &quot;Masters of Rock&quot; series of budget EMI compilations with identical titles, each volume for a different artist. Two different sleeve designs were used: one (by Herman Baas) based on the picture from the centre of the album sleeve for &quot;Meddle&quot;, with Syd Barrett&#x27;s face superimposed over the original photo of David Gilmour, who had not yet joined the band during most of the period covered by the album; and a later edition with the title filling the front cover. The latter edition is titled &quot;Masters of Rock, Volume 1&quot;; subsequent volumes of &quot;Masters of Rock&quot; featured other artists.

==Song variations==
There are no song variations between the original &quot;Best of&quot; edition and the &quot;Masters of Rock&quot; LPs.
Both The &quot;Best of&quot; edition and &quot;Masters of Rock&quot; are made from the same master tape and matrix (5C 054–04299) and were notable for containing the first stereo release of &quot;Apples and Oranges&quot; and &quot;Paintbox&quot;, this latter also appearing a year later on &quot;Relics&quot;.

However, The French edition of &quot;Masters of Rock&quot;, released in 1974, contains the stereo mix of &quot;Julia Dream&quot; as in &quot;Relics&quot;.

These albums were also the only LP source of &quot;It Would Be So Nice&quot; prior to the era of CD re-issues and compilations. The version of &quot;It Would Be So Nice&quot; appearing on these albums is the single version, with lyrics mentioning &quot;the &quot;Daily Standard&quot;&quot; (no known version with &quot;the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;&quot; has ever been released).

Counterfeit editions with different track lists exist. Any edition with a track list that does not match the list shown here, is a counterfeit.

==Track listing==

<text>William John Biffen, Baron Biffen, (3 November 1930 – 14 August 2007), was a British Conservative Party politician. He was a member of parliament from 1961 to 1997, and served in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s cabinet; he then served in the House of Lords.

==Early life and education==
The son of Victor William Biffen, a tenant farmer, of Hill Farm, Otterhampton, Bridgwater, Somerset, and his wife Edith Annie (&#x27;Tish&#x27;), John Biffen was born in Bridgwater, Somerset, in 1930. He was educated firstly at Combwich village school, followed by Dr. Morgan&#x27;s Grammar School, Bridgwater. He then earned a scholarship to Jesus College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a first class honours degree in history. From 1953 to 1960 he worked for Tube Investments Ltd. In the 1960s he joined the Mont Pelerin Society.

==Political career==
Having previously stood unsuccessfully against Richard Crossman at Coventry East in 1959, Biffen was the member of parliament (MP) for the constituency of Oswestry, later renamed Shropshire North, from the time of his election at a by-election in 1961 until his retirement at the 1997 general election.

In his early political career he was a disciple of Enoch Powell, voting for him in the Conservative leadership election of 1965. Biffen was a Eurosceptic and voted in a parliamentary division in 1972, opposing his own party, against the UK&#x27;s entry into the EC. He championed tight fiscal policy and opposed state intervention in economic management. This stance barred his way to advancement under Edward Heath, but contributed to his promotion under Margaret Thatcher.

===In government===
Biffen served in Thatcher&#x27;s government in the successive positions of Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Secretary of State for Trade, and as Leader of the House of Commons. Thatcher writes in &quot;The Downing Street Years&quot; (1993) that &quot;(Biffen) had been a brilliant exponent in Opposition of the economic policies in which I believed... But he proved rather less effective than I had hoped in the gruelling task of trying to control public expenditure.&quot;

In 1981, he allowed Rupert Murdoch to buy &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; without reference to the Monopolies Commission. According to Woodrow Wyatt, who helped persuade Thatcher to ensure this, the Commission &quot;almost certainly would have blocked it&quot;.

As Leader of the House, Biffen used the guillotine to cut short debate on the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1986. Edward Pearce has written that Biffen &quot;was widely thought the best post-war floor leader&quot;.

Biffen&#x27;s image as an economic &quot;dry&quot; mellowed during his time in government, and he made blunt public calls for greater moderation in government policy. In 1980 he warned the country to prepare for &quot;three years of unparalleled austerity&quot;. In 1981 Biffen gave a speech to a fringe meeting at that year&#x27;s Conservative Party Conference in which he argued the party was &quot;within touching distance of the débâcles of 1906 and 1945&quot;. He further claimed that far from cutting public spending, the government had increased it by two per cent since 1979 and that the government was part of an all-party consensus in favour of the welfare state and public spending: &quot;We are all social democrats now&quot;, Biffen concluded in his speech.

On 9 February 1986, he said that Toryism was &quot;not a raucous political faction&quot; and after the Conservative Party&#x27;s losses in the 1986 local government elections, and poor performances in the two parliamentary by-elections held simultaneously, Biffen was interviewed on &quot;Weekend World&quot; by Brian Walden on 11 May as the government&#x27;s spokesman. He called the results &quot;Black Thursday&quot;, said the Conservatives needed to fight the next general election on a &quot;balanced ticket&quot; and that &quot;no one seriously supposes that the Prime Minister would be Prime Minister throughout the entire period of the next Parliament&quot;. This alienated him from Thatcher and resulted in his being dropped from the Cabinet after the 1987 general election. His dismissal was no surprise, in that Thatcher&#x27;s press secretary Bernard Ingham had already famously called him a &quot;semi-detached&quot; member of the Cabinet. Thatcher in her memoirs described Biffen&#x27;s desire for a balanced ticket as &quot;foolish&quot; and &quot;a recipe for paralysis.&quot; Nevertheless, Thatcher later admitted that Biffen&#x27;s departure from the Cabinet was &quot;a loss in some ways&quot;, because of his Euroscepticism and his &quot;sound instincts on economic matters&quot;. In the month after his sacking Biffen likened Thatcher&#x27;s governing style to that of a &quot;Stalinist regime&quot;.

Despite his right-wing views on economic policy, he was very much to the left of Thatcher on social policy. Similarly to Powell, he completely opposed capital punishment and was very supportive of equal gay rights but wanted less immigration. Biffen also opposed the tightening of laws restricting abortion and voted in 1990 to preserve the limit at 28 weeks.

Brian Walden noted that Biffen was the &quot;most honest&quot; politician he had interviewed.

===Return to the Backbench===
On the backbenches Biffen voted against the Local Government Finance Act 1988 which introduced the Community Charge (the poll tax). He voted against the Maastricht Treaty and was in favour of a referendum on the EU Constitution so he could vote &quot;No&quot;.

===House of Lords===
On 3 June 1997 he was created a life peer, as Baron Biffen, of Tanat in the County of Shropshire.

==Personal life==
Biffen married Sarah Wood in 1979. He had one stepson, Nicholas Wood, a correspondent with &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, and a stepdaughter, Lucy. The family lived at Tanat House, Llanyblodwel.

Biffen died from heart failure at Royal Shrewsbury Hospital on 14 August 2007, aged 76. He had also suffered from kidney failure for many years.

==In popular culture==
Biffen was portrayed by Roger Brierley in the 2004 BBC production of &quot;The Alan Clark Diaries&quot;.

<text>The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a satellite-based sensor used for earth and climate measurements. There are two MODIS sensors in Earth orbit: one on board the Terra (EOS AM) satellite, launched by NASA in 1999; and one on board the Aqua (EOS PM) satellite, launched in 2002. MODIS has now been replaced by the VIIRS, which first launched in 2011 aboard the Suomi NPP satellite.

The MODIS instruments were built by Santa Barbara Remote Sensing. They capture data in 36 spectral bands ranging in wavelength from 0.4 μm to 14.4 μm and at varying spatial resolutions (2 bands at 250 m, 5 bands at 500 m and 29 bands at 1 km). Together the instruments image the entire Earth every 1 to 2 days. They are designed to provide measurements in large-scale global dynamics including changes in Earth&#x27;s cloud cover, radiation budget and processes occurring in the oceans, on land, and in the lower atmosphere. 

Support and calibration is provided by the MODIS characterization support team (MCST).

== Applications ==

With its high temporal resolution although low spatial resolution, MODIS data are useful to track changes in the landscape over time. Examples of such applications are the monitoring of vegetation health by means of time-series analyses with vegetation indices, long term land cover changes (e.g. to monitor deforestation rates), global snow cover trends, water inundation from pluvial, riverine, or sea level rise flooding in coastal areas, change of water levels of major lakes such as the Aral Sea, and the detection and mapping of wildland fires in the United States. The United States Forest Service&#x27;s Remote Sensing Applications Center analyzes MODIS imagery on a continuous basis to provide information for the management and suppression of wildfires.

== Specifications ==
===Calibration===
MODIS utilizes four on-board calibrators in addition to the space view in order to provide in-flight calibration: solar diffuser (SD), solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM), spectral radiometric calibration assembly (SRCA), and a v-groove black body. MODIS has used the marine optical buoy for vicarious calibration.

<text>Viscount Gough (), of Goojerat in the Punjab and of the city of Limerick, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1849 for the Anglo-Irish military commander Hugh Gough, 1st Baron Gough, whose military successes included the First Opium War, the First Anglo-Sikh War, and the Second Anglo-Sikh War. He had already been created a baronet, of Synone and Drangan, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom, on 23 December 1842, and Baron Gough, of ChingKangFoo in China and of Maharajpore and the Sutlej in the East Indies, in 1846, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord Gough later became a field marshal. The titles became extinct in 2023 following the death of the 5th Viscount.

The family seat was originally established by the 1st Viscount near Gort at Lough Cutra Castle in County Galway, Ireland, when it was purchased by him in 1852. He also resided near Dublin at St. Helen&#x27;s, Booterstown. The family seat later became Keppoch House near Dingwall in Ross-shire, Scotland.

The name was pronounced &quot;Goff&quot;, &quot;not&quot; &quot;Guff&quot;.

<text>Viscount Goschen, of Hawkhurst in the County of Kent, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1900 for the politician George Goschen.

==History==
The Goschen family descended from prominent publisher and printer Georg Joachim Göschen of Leipzig, Kingdom of Saxony. His third son, Wilhelm Heinrich (William Henry) Göschen (1793–1866), came to England in 1814 and the next year co-founded the merchant banking firm &quot;Frühling &amp; Göschen&quot;, of Leipzig and London.

Wilhelm&#x27;s eldest son George joined the family firm before he entered politics. He served variously as Member of Parliament, Vice-President of the Board of Trade, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, President of the Poor Law Board, Chancellor of the Exchequer and First Lord of the Admiralty. He was raised to the peerage in December 1900 by Queen Victoria.

George&#x27;s son, the second Viscount, sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for East Grinstead and served as Governor of Madras. The second Viscount&#x27;s only son, Lieutenant George Joachim Goschen (1893–1916), was killed during the First World War, dying of wounds received during the Siege of Kut. Upon the second Viscount&#x27;s death in 1952, the title was inherited by his nephew John Goschen, the second son of his brother, Sir William Henry Goschen (1870–1943). Sir William&#x27;s eldest son, Brig.-Gen. William Henry Goschen (1900–1944), was killed in action in Burma in the Second World War. The third Viscount served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard (Deputy Chief Whip in the House of Lords) in the Conservative administrations of Harold Macmillan, Sir Alec Douglas-Home and Edward Heath. , the title is held by the fourth Viscount, who succeeded in 1977. He held junior ministerial positions in the Conservative government of John Major and is now one of the 90 elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999.

The diplomat Sir Edward Goschen, 1st Baronet, was the younger brother of the first Viscount.

The family seat is Hilton House, near Crowthorne, Berkshire.

<doc id="471186" wikidata="Q47157" url="?curid=471186" title="King Khalid International Airport">
<text>King Khalid International Airport (; ) is an international airport located about north of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This airport consists of five passenger terminals with eight aero-bridges each, a mosque, and parking facilities for 11,600 vehicles. It includes a &quot;Royal Terminal&quot; designated for use by government officials, state guests, and the Saudi royal family. The airport has one of the world&#x27;s tallest air traffic control towers, and two parallel runways, each in length. It is the second largest airport by land area in the world, after King Fahd International Airport. It is one of the busiest airports in the Middle East. The airport is owned and operated by the state-owned Riyadh Airports Company.

The Royal Mosque was designed with a significant programme of integral art; the stained glass, by British architectural artist Brian Clarke, was a landmark work in the history of the medium, considered to be the largest and technically most advanced stained glass project of the modern period.

==History==
King Khalid International Airport (KKIA), designed by architectural practice Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum, was opened by HRH King Fahd on 16 November 1983, and opened for scheduled flights on 5 December of the same year. Until then, what is now Riyadh Air Base served commercial flights to and from Riyadh. Increased international and local air transport requirements for Riyadh made the change necessary. Riyadh Air Base, which is much closer to the city center, is operated by the Royal Saudi Air Force.

This airport was an alternative landing site for NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle.

On 12 March 2023, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, formally announced the establishment of Riyadh Air. Riyadh Air will use the airport as a hub.

==Structure and facilities==
===Terminals===
====Passenger terminals====
There are five main passenger terminals at the airport, four of them were built when the airport started operation in 1983, and Terminal 5 was opened in 2016.
* Terminal 1 was used for all international flights (except those operated by Saudia and Middle East Airlines, which are SkyTeam members and Flynas), though it is temporarily closed for renovations and might be used by Riyadh Air.
* Terminal 2 was used for all international flights by SkyTeam members, including Saudia and Flynas, though now it is used for all international flights (except those operated by Saudia and Middle East Airlines, which are SkyTeam members and Flynas).
* Terminal 3 has been reopened following its re-development; it hosted shuttle flight to Doha during the World Cup, though now it hosts Flynas, Flyadeal, Qatar Airways, and all SkyTeam members (except Saudia).
*Terminal 4 has been redeveloped and is now operational. It currently hosts Saudia&#x27;s international flights.
* Terminal 5 is the newest terminal which opened in 2016, which is now used by Saudia and Flynas for domestic flights.

Terminal 1 to 4 were built when the airport was opened in November 1983. They are connected to each other by means of three linking buildings, each long. Each terminal is triangular in plan, with a base area of . The complex includes a modern VIPs terminal plus restaurants, cafeterias, airlines offices, government departments, hotels and rent-a-car companies counters, banks, first aid clinics and commercial shops.

Terminal 5 is a rectangular building which can serve 16 narrow-body or 8 wide-body aircraft. Operated by Irish airport operator Dublin Airport Authority, it is Saudi&#x27;s first privately run airport terminal and can handle 12 million passengers per year.

====The Royal Terminal====
Heads of state and other high-ranking VIP visitors to the kingdom are greeted in the Royal Pavilion. The Royal Pavilion has open spaces, garden areas, and fountains. A ceremonial hall wide and long connects it to the mosque. The design and geometry of the building are similar to those of the other terminals architecturally and in the aesthetic respect. Arriving guests can use either air bridges or escalators to enter the building from the aircraft parking area. The ceremonial area on the airside has space for special receptions involving honor guards and bands. Like the passenger terminals, the Royal Pavilion has a triangular plan, with a roof composed of 33 arched sections rising to a high point above the ground level. Glass walls and windows illuminate the interior of the building.

====General aviation terminal====
A general aviation complex has been constructed north of runway number 1 for use by private aircraft and is reached by a special access road which runs north from the airport access highway. The general aviation facility includes a passenger terminal, aircraft parking and maintenance facilities, taxiways and parking for visitors, tenants and staff. In addition to privately owned aircraft, this facility accommodates Saudia&#x27;s special flight services group. It is also home to Alsalam Aircraft Company, Ltd. Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) on Royal Saudi Air Force aircraft is performed at the uniquely designed facility.

===Expansion===
In July 2014, German construction company Hochtief won the bid for the airport expansion which aims at increasing its capacity from 15 million to 25 million and includes construction of a new fifth terminal. The contract was valued at €1.3 billion and will be carried out by Hochtief with a 55% stake, along with Indian engineering company Shapoorji Pallonji Mideast and Saudi Arabian construction company Nahdat Al Emaar. Construction is expected to be completed by May 2019. Terminal 4 is expected to be equipped with required facilities. KKIA has not witnessed any development since its establishment in 1983.

====King Salman International Airport====
King Salman International Airport is a proposed new airport to be built over King Khalid International Airport. The new airport will have no fewer than six parallel runways and capacity for up to 200 million passengers annually.

===The Royal Mosque===

The Royal Mosque is set within a plaza in a central position in the airport. KKIA was the first airport in Saudi Arabia to be built to then-contemporary engineering standards and the mosque was at the time of its construction the most modern mosque in the world, notable for its use of advances in construction and engineering to create a modern complex in a vernacular Arabic style, and for its programme of integral art, at that time the largest in the world, marrying traditional Islamic decorative elements with, and interpreted through, the work of contemporary artists. Hexagonal in plan, and enclosing an area of over , its scale, location and design make it the most dominant building in the passenger complex. The mosque can accommodate 5,000 worshippers inside, with capacity for an additional 4,000 in the surrounding plaza. The mosque&#x27;s dome, in diameter and internally clad in polished bronze, is internally separated from the lower roof of the building by a seven-foot clerestory ring of stained-glass windows, by artist Brian Clarke, below which runs a calligraphic mosaic band designed by Iranian-Armenian painter Edman Ayvazyan. The hand-cut glass and marble mosaic, measuring and fabricated with Clarke&#x27;s assistance, was the largest in the world at the time. The dome&#x27;s apex, at above the arrivals level roadway, is higher than all the other structures in the passenger complex with the exception of the control tower and minaret. At the time of its construction, the programme of decorative and integral art for the mosque constituted one of the largest single art projects of the period. In the northeast corner of the mosque plaza, a minaret rises above the plaza level. A spiral stairway inside the minaret provides access to loudspeakers that broadcast the prayer calls five times daily. There are of floor space on the main floor of the mosque and another on the mezzanine floor. A Koranic library off of the main mosque floor has of user space and the same amount for storage space. The library, private offices and lavatories are located along the southeast on the southwest walls.

====Stained glass====
In 1982, through the Vesti Corporation, the British architectural artist Brian Clarke was commissioned to conceive of a scheme of stained glass artworks for the interior of the Royal Mosque. Clarke made a study of Islamic ornament at the Quran schools in Fez and Tangiers for six weeks, and produced a series of abstract designs that engaged with historical pan-Islamic decorative tradition. Completed in 1982 and containing of stained glass, the Royal Mosque was considered to be the largest and technically most advanced stained glass project of the modern period, requiring the full staff of 4 stained glass factories and 150 craftsmen, taking a year to fabricate. The technical demands of the designs required the revival of certain traditional manufacturing techniques, the development of new ones to accommodate the programme of ornate geometric leading, and the deployment of modern technologies and materials, including screenprinting and the acid-etching of float glass.

===Runways and aprons===

===Air traffic control tower===

Centrally located in the passenger terminal complex, between the Royal Pavilion and the mosque is the air traffic control tower standing at high. Twr Freq. 118.6E &amp; 118.8W. GND 121.6. CD 121.8. Riyadh Dept. 120.0 Riyadh Approach 126.0

There are 19 separate floor levels in the tower, including the operations area at the base of the tower and a total of of floor space. Six of the 19 floors are considered main floors. These include the operational level at the base of the tower, two equipment floors, an observation floor, a service floor and the cab floor at the top of the tower from which the air traffic controllers overlook the entire airport. The operations floor houses the radar control center for the airport as well as conference rooms, offices and a training area. The two equipment level contain mechanical and electrical equipment and cables, and the service floor contains a kitchen, lounge and lavatories for personnel on duty in the cab. The cab itself contains controller operating positions and electronic and communications equipment. The tower is supplied with two sources of standby power should the regular source of power be interrupted. One source is the standby power supply at the central power plant – three diesel engine generators. In addition, a 300-kilowatt diesel engine located in the tower itself can provide a secondary source of emergency power. The tower is outfitted with the most advanced electronic radar systems and data processing equipment available.

The airport is served by Line 4 of the Riyadh Metro, with the line opening on 1 December 2024. The metro system helps passengers reach the city center quickly and comfortably, and the stations serving the airport include Airport T1–2, Airport T3–4 and Airport T5.

==Future==

The airport will undergo a mass expansion by 2030, by increasing its area to 57 km2. (22 sq.mi.), consisting of three to four large passenger terminals, from two runways to six runways among other facilities and amenities. It will be able to handle 120 million passengers per year after 2030, and 185 million passengers per year by 2050. This expansion will include the airport among the world&#x27;s largest airports.

<text>The &quot;Columbia&quot; Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) was an internal commission convened by NASA to investigate the destruction of the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; during STS-107 upon atmospheric re-entry on February 1, 2003. The panel determined that the accident was caused by foam insulation breaking off from the external fuel tank, forming debris which damaged the orbiter&#x27;s wing, and that the problem of &quot;debris shedding&quot; was well known but considered &quot;acceptable&quot; by management. The panel also recommended changes that should be made to increase the safety of future shuttle flights. The CAIB released its final report on August 26, 2003.

==Major findings==
The board found both the immediate physical cause of the accident and also what it called organizational causes.

===Immediate cause of the accident===

82 seconds after launch a large piece of foam insulating material, the &quot;left bipod foam ramp&quot;, broke free from the external tank and struck the leading edge of the shuttle&#x27;s left wing, damaging the protective carbon heat shielding panels.

During re-entry into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, this damage allowed super-heated gases to enter and erode the inner wing structure which led to the destruction of &quot;Columbia&quot;. It was the seventh instance of a piece of foam, from this particular area of the external tank, breaking free during launch, and the only instance of structural damage as a result of the breakage.

===Organizational cause of the accident===
The problem of debris shedding from the external tank was well known and had caused shuttle damage on every prior shuttle flight. The damage was usually, but not always, minor. Over time, management gained confidence that it was an acceptable risk. NASA decided that it did not warrant an extra EVA (extravehicular activity) for visual inspection, feeling that it would be like a car going down a highway and hitting a Styrofoam cooler.

== Board recommendations ==

The board made 29 specific recommendations to NASA to improve the safety of future shuttle flights. These recommendations include:

*Foam from external tank should not break free
*Better pre-flight inspection routines
*Increase quality of images available of shuttle during ascent and on-flight
*Recertify all shuttle components by the year 2010
*Establish an independent Technical Engineering Authority that is responsible for technical requirements and all waivers to them, and will build a disciplined, systematic approach to identifying, analyzing, and controlling hazards throughout the life cycle of the Shuttle System.
*Retire the space shuttle.

Only two further Space Shuttle missions were allowed to be flown before the implementation of these recommendations.

==Shuttle program after the CAIB report==
After the CAIB report came out, NASA implemented all recommended changes and flew its first post-&quot;Columbia&quot; mission in 2005. As part of the CAIB recommendations, the Shuttle carried a 50-foot inspection boom attached to the robot arm, which was used within 24 hours of launch to check the orbiter for damage. As all but one of the post-&quot;Columbia&quot; missions were concentrated on the International Space Station, primarily to provide a &quot;safe haven&quot; in the event an orbiter was damaged beyond the normal repair methods, NASA implemented a STS-3xx contingency mission program that could launch a rescue orbiter on short notice, similar to the Skylab Rescue that was planned during the Skylab program.

NASA retired the Space Shuttle fleet on July 21, 2011, after completing the ISS and the final flight and subsequent landing of &quot;Atlantis&quot;. The Shuttle&#x27;s replacement, Orion, was to have consisted of an Apollo-derived spacecraft launched on the Ares I rocket, which would use a Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster as its first stage. Orion would not face the dangers of either an O-ring failure (due to the presence of a launch escape system) or shedding foam (as the spacecraft would be launched in a stack configuration). In addition to ferrying crews to the ISS, the Orion spacecraft was (as part of Project Constellation) to allow NASA to return to the Moon. President Obama signed the NASA Authorization Act 2010 on October 11 which officially brought the Constellation program to an end, replacing it with the Space Launch System (SLS) and Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) programs to develop the launch vehicle and spacecraft to enable human exploration missions beyond low-Earth orbit.

<text>MOPITT (Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere) is an ongoing astronomical instrument aboard NASA&#x27;s Terra satellite that measures global tropospheric carbon monoxide levels. It is part of NASA&#x27;s Earth Observing System (EOS), and combined with the other payload remote sensors on the Terra satellite, the spacecraft monitors the Earth&#x27;s environment and climate changes. Following its construction in Canada, MOPITT was launched into Earth&#x27;s orbit in 1999 and utilizes gas correlation spectroscopy to measure the presence of different gases in the troposphere. The fundamental operations occur in its optical system composed of two optical tables holding the bulk of the apparatus. Results from the MOPITT enable scientists to better understand carbon monoxide&#x27;s effects on a global scale, and various studies have been conducted based on MOPITT&#x27;s measurements.

== Background ==
The National Research Council Canada founded the MOPITT project following its initial proposal in 1989. After the establishment of the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), MOPITT shifted into the agency where it received financial support from the Space Science Division of CSA. It was successfully launched from the Vandenberg Air Force Base on December 18, 1999, and began scientific measurements in March 2000. Before its execution, the only existing global carbon monoxide dataset was measured by the MAPS instrument aboard space shuttles. MOPITT is the first tool to measure global concentrations and variations in carbon monoxide. It is part of a series of five payloads on the Terra satellite that oversees global environmental changes:

* ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer)
* CERES (Clouds and the Earth&#x27;s Radiant Energy System)
* MISR (Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer)
* MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)
* MOPITT (Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere)

Despite the initial five-year term plan, the satellite has continued to operate for over 20 years, and researchers expect all five of these instruments to maintain their functionality and transmit information and data past 2026.

== Technology ==

=== Instrument Methodology ===
MOPITT is a nadir-sounding (vertically downward pointing) instrument that measures upwelling infrared radiation and utilizes correlation spectroscopy (comparison of wavelengths or absorption between a known and unknown sample) to measure concentrations of carbon monoxide. Essentially, MOPITT takes carbon monoxide as an optical filter to measure the signal of the same gas in the troposphere. The sensor quantifies radiance emitted and reflected from Earth through three spectral bands:

* 4.7 μm channels are referred to as the carbon monoxide thermal channels because the signals stem from the thermal emissions from Earth&#x27;s surface and the atmosphere
* The 2.3 μm channels are termed the carbon monoxide solar channel because they absorb the dominant signal from reflected sunlight

* 2.2 μm channels refer to the methane solar channels because reflected sunlight is the major signal, similar to the 2.3 μm channels

These channels absorb different amounts of energy, leading to differences in the resulting signals that correlate to the spectral sample of carbon monoxide. To further analyze carbon monoxide levels, MOPITT adjusts the path length or gaseous pressure of the gas sample, causing the frequency of these spectral lines to vary, which will give a difference and an average transmission. The difference specifies the gases measured, whereas the average signal indicates the overall radiation minus the initial gas measured.

MOPITT&#x27;s spatial resolution is 22 km horizontally and about 5 km vertically and scans Earth at a broad area of 640 km wide. The carbon monoxide measurement profiles are created through the upwelling of thermal radiance in 4.6-μm absorption. MOPITT can view different layers of the troposphere by varying modulated cells: Pressure-modulated cells (PMCs) are used to observe upper layers while length-modulated cells (LMCs) can view lower layers of the troposphere.

=== Instrument Description ===
At the heart of MOPITT lies the optical system, which is composed of two identical &quot;mirror imaged&quot; optical tables that include the calibration sources, scan mirrors, choppers, LMCs, PMCs, modulators, and dewar cooler assemblies containing cold optics and thermal and solar detectors. A pair of low-vibration Stirling Cycle coolers chill the dewar. Considerable heat-emitting units like the cooler are placed intentionally on the coldplate, and other critical electronic pieces are placed near it as well. The coldplate, located under MOPITT&#x27;s baseplate, provides a stable thermal environment for the instrument. It utilizes capillary action with ammonia as its working fluid.

In the two optical systems referred to above, eight channels measure carbon monoxide or methane. Channels one, two, three, five, six, and seven focus on carbon monoxide. The six channels for carbon monoxide vary in cell pressures from 25 to 800 mb, and their cell lengths range from 2 to 10 mm. Their center wavelength also differs between channels, and the modulator types are either LMCs or PMCs. In contrast, channels four and eight measure methane, and their only difference is the different LMCs used. All channels operate at 300 K.

== Applications ==
Before MOPITT&#x27;s release, data on carbon monoxide was limited. With MOPITT&#x27;s comprehensive measurements of carbon monoxide throughout the past two decades, scientists are better equipped to predict the potential consequences of carbon monoxide pollution. Its applications include:

* A better understanding of the increase in ozone concentration in the troposphere allows scientists to perform interim pollution methods
* Assessment of antipollution practices such as automobile emission reduction standards
* Analysis of environmental pollution influenced by human activities
* Generating maps of pollution transport, such as the direction of carbon monoxide emissions after large fires
* Confirmation of newly developed climate models that portray areas producing or reducing carbon monoxide

=== Studies ===
Many studies utilizing MOPITT&#x27;s data have been completed. Notable ones include:

* The analysis of the variation in vertical structure of carbon monoxide caused by Asian summer monsoons
* The examination of seasonal carbon monoxide climatology in the Northern Hemisphere 
* The observation of large horizontal gradients in carbon monoxide at the synoptic scale 
* The study of carbon monoxide variability in the Southern Hemisphere 
* Observation of enhanced carbon monoxide over the Zagros Mountains in Iran 
* Detection and analysis of carbon monoxide emitted by cities and urban areas to demonstrate rising carbon monoxide pollution 
* Breakdown of carbon monoxide trends in varying regions 

In the year 2022 alone, more than 250 studies have used measurements from MOPITT.

<doc id="471205" wikidata="Q846392" url="?curid=471205" title="Hipgnosis">
<text>Hipgnosis were an English art design group, based in London, that specialised in creating album cover artwork for rock musicians and bands. Their commissions included work for Pink Floyd, Def Leppard, T. Rex, the Pretty Things, Black Sabbath, Wishbone Ash, UFO, 10cc, Bad Company, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Scorpions, the Nice, Paul McCartney &amp; Wings, the Alan Parsons Project, Yes, Genesis, Peter Gabriel, Electric Light Orchestra, Rainbow, Styx and Al Stewart.

Hipgnosis consisted primarily of Cambridge natives Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell, and later Peter Christopherson. The group dissolved in 1983, though Thorgerson worked on album designs until his death in 2013. Powell has worked with Paul McCartney and the Who in film and video production, and as the creative director for both Pink Floyd and their lead guitarist David Gilmour. Christopherson went on to produce music videos for many bands and shot some of the earliest promotional photography for the Sex Pistols, but worked primarily as an electronic musician in the bands Throbbing Gristle, Psychic TV and Coil until his death in 2010.

== History ==

In 1968, Thorgerson and Powell were approached by their friends in Pink Floyd to design the cover for the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;. This led to additional work for EMI, including photos and album covers for the Pretty Things, Free, Toe Fat and the Gods. Being film and art school students, they were able to use the darkroom at the Royal College of Art, but when they completed school, they had to set up their own facilities. They built a small darkroom in Powell&#x27;s bathroom, but shortly thereafter, in early 1970, rented space and built a studio located at 6 Denmark Street.

When first starting out, Powell and Thorgerson adopted their name from graffiti they found on the door to their apartment. Thorgerson said they liked the word, not only for punning on &quot;hypnosis&quot;, but for possessing &quot;a nice sense of contradiction, of an impossible co-existence, from Hip = new, cool, and groovy, and gnosis, relating to ancient learning.&quot;

Hipgnosis gained major international prominence in 1973 with their cover design for Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. The final design was one of several versions prepared for the band to choose from, but according to drummer Nick Mason, the &#x27;prism/pyramid&#x27; design was the immediate and unanimous choice. The record itself became one of the biggest-selling and longest-charting albums of all time, and the cover has since been hailed as one of the best of all time (VH1 rated it as No. 4, in 2003). After that, the firm became highly sought-after, and did many covers for high-profile bands and artists such as Led Zeppelin, Genesis, UFO, Black Sabbath, Peter Gabriel, the Alan Parsons Project, and Yes. They also designed the cover for a UK paperback edition of Douglas Adams&#x27;s &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; (Adams would describe Thorgerson as &quot;The best album designer in the world&quot;), as well as the original UK hardcover edition of Norman Spinrad&#x27;s &quot;Bug Jack Barron&quot;.

Peter Christopherson joined Hipgnosis as an assistant in 1974, and later became a full partner. The firm employed many assistants and other staff members over the years, including freelance designers and illustrators Richard Evans, George Hardie, and Richard Manning.

Hipgnosis did not have a set fee for designing an album cover but instead asked the artists to &quot;pay what they thought it was worth&quot;. According to Thorgerson, this policy only occasionally backfired.

== Style ==

Hipgnosis&#x27;s approach to album design was strongly photography-oriented, and they pioneered the use of many innovative visual and packaging techniques. In particular, Thorgerson and Powell&#x27;s surreal, elaborately manipulated photos (utilizing darkroom tricks, multiple exposures, airbrush retouching, and mechanical cut-and-paste techniques) were a film-based forerunner of what would, much later, be called photoshopping. Hipgnosis mainly used Hasselblad medium format cameras for their work.

Hipgnosis covers were noted for their quirky humour, such as the cover for the Pink Floyd double-LP compilation &quot;A Nice Pair&quot; (1973), which featured an array of visual puns. Another example was the 1974 album &quot;There&#x27;s the Rub&quot; for Wishbone Ash using a picture of a cricketer and ball.

Such humour once angered Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, when Hipgnosis created a visual pun based on &quot; racquet&quot;/&quot; racket&quot; for the 1973 album &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;. Hipgnosis almost lost Led Zeppelin as a client as a result.

Another trademark was that many of their cover photos visually related to the album&#x27;s lyrics, often depicting puns or double meanings of words in the album title. Since both Powell and Thorgerson were film students, they often used models and staged the photos in a highly theatrical manner. Hipgnosis covers rarely featured artists&#x27; photos on the outside, and most were in a gatefold cover format to provide ample space for their imagery.

Many of Hipgnosis&#x27;s covers also featured pen and ink logos and illustrations designed to appear high-tech (often by graphic designer George Hardie), stickers, fancy inner sleeves, and other packaging bonuses. One of the extras created by Hipgnosis was the specially printed inner sleeve for Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot; (1979) LP, which was black and white but turned to colour when dampened with water (tying in with the main cover&#x27;s photographic theme).

<text>Viscount Ullswater, of Campsea Ashe in the County of Suffolk, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1921 for James Lowther upon his retirement as Speaker of the House of Commons. He was the eldest son of the Hon. William Lowther, third son of the Hon. Henry Lowther, second son of William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale (see Earl of Lonsdale and Lowther Baronets for earlier history of the family). The first Viscount lived to the age of 93, and was pre-deceased by both his eldest son the Hon. Christopher Lowther, a Conservative politician, and his eldest son&#x27;s eldest son John Arthur Lowther (1910–1942) (who was Private Secretary to Prince George, Duke of Kent and was killed in the same air crash as him), the title being inherited by his seven-year-old great-grandson, the second and current Viscount, in an extremely rare instance of a great-grandson succeeding his great-grandfather in a peerage. The second Viscount held office in the Conservative administrations of Margaret Thatcher and John Major and since 2003 he has been one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999.

Two of the first Viscount&#x27;s younger brothers also gained distinction. Sir Gerard Lowther, 1st Baronet, was a diplomat and Sir Cecil Lowther a soldier and politician.

<text>The spur-winged goose (Plectropterus gambensis) is a large, Sub-Saharan African waterbird in the family Anatidae, which includes geese and shelducks. However, &quot;P. gambensis&quot; developed unique environmental adaptations, which resulted in the evolution of several anatomical features that are not shared with other anatids; thus, the species has been classified one step further into its own subfamily, the Plectropterinae.

==Description==

Adults are long, and weigh an average of (rarely up to ), with ganders (males) being noticeably larger than the geese. The wingspan can range from . One source claims the average weight of males is around and the weight of females is around . However, 11 individuals that were banded in South Africa, were found to average only , with a range of . Another South African-based study found 58 males weighing an average of and measuring in total length; meanwhile, 34 females averaged in weight and in total length. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is and the tarsus is . They are among the largest true African waterfowl (besides the wading Goliath heron) and are, on average, the world&#x27;s largest &quot;goose&quot;, although in average weight, their size is at least rivaled by the Cape Barren goose. Spur-winged geese appear to be more closely allied to shelducks than &quot;true geese&quot; such as those from the &quot;Branta&quot; and &quot;Anser&quot; genera. They are mainly black, with a white face and large white wing patches. The long legs are pinkish red in colour. 
The male differs from the female, not only in size, but also in having a larger red facial patch extending back from the red bill, and a knob at the base of the upper mandible. This is generally a quiet species. Typically, only males make a call, which consists of a soft bubbling &quot;cherwit&quot; when taking wing or alarmed. During breeding displays or in instances of alarm, both sexes may utter other inconspicuous calls.

==Toxicity==

Some populations of the spur-winged goose are toxic. Populations that have a diet that includes significant quantities of blister beetles are poisonous. The poison, cantharidin, is held within the tissue of the bird resulting in poisoning of those that eat the cooked goose. A dose of 10 mg of cantharidin can kill a human.

==Habitat==
This species often occurs in open grasslands with lakes, seasonal pools, rivers, swamps and river deltas. Large inland rivers and lakes are perhaps most commonly inhabited, with saline lakes and upland areas generally being avoided, although the species can occur to an elevation of in eastern Africa. It is also absent from arid zones.

==Ecology==
The spur-winged goose is gregarious, generally meeting in small flocks that contain up to 50 birds. They occur around various African rivers, lakes and swamps. Varied sites may be used for post-breeding moulting, in which case large numbers of the geese may congregate. This common species feeds by grazing, but spends the middle part of the day resting by water. Its diet consists predominantly of plant matter such as the vegetative parts and seeds of grasses, sedges and aquatic plants, agricultural grains, fruit (e.g. figs) and tuberous crops, although it may occasionally supplement its diet with small fish or insects. Dispersal may occur in pursuit of feeding opportunities outside of the breeding season.

The breeding season for spur-winged geese is variable across the range. In the north, breeding generally occurs from August to December, in eastern Africa from January to June and in southern Africa from August to May. This species is highly aggressive to other waterfowl (including conspecifics) during the breeding season. At this time of the year, the geese may violently put the spur on the bend of the wings to use in conflicts with other birds. Adult male geese are especially prone to attacking other adult males. The large nest is usually concealed in vegetation near water, but tree holes, cavities in rocks, old hamerkop, African fish eagle or social weaver nests and even the top of a termite mound and an aardvark burrow have been used as nests. When choosing a tree-nest site, they will generally select a nest located close to the ground at between high in trees high. Generally, they prefer quiet, undisturbed stretches of riverbank and wetlands for nest sites.

==Status==
The spur-winged goose is a common bird of African wetlands. Perhaps the main threat to the species is development and destruction of wetland habitats and unregulated hunting. A counting survey of the population in western Africa wetlands from Senegal to Chad in early 1977 produced a count of 10,000 geese, mostly being found in the Niger basin. This bird is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>The Pick Operating System, also known as the Pick System or simply Pick, is a demand-paged, multi-user, virtual memory, time-sharing computer operating system based around a MultiValue database. Pick is used primarily for business data processing. It is named after one of its developers, Dick Pick.

The term &quot;Pick system&quot; has also come to be used as the general name of all operating environments which employ this multivalued database and have some implementation of Pick/BASIC and ENGLISH/Access queries. Although Pick started on a variety of minicomputers, the system and its various implementations eventually spread to a large assortment of microcomputers, personal computers, and mainframe computers.

==Overview==
The Pick Operating System is an integrated computing platform with a database, query and procedural operation languages, peripheral and multi-user management, and BASIC programming capabilities. Its database utilizes a hash-file system, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval by organizing data into dynamic associative arrays managed by associative files.

Data within the Pick system is organized into a hierarchical structure of accounts, dictionaries, files, and sub-files based on a hash-table model with linear probing. This structure comprises variable-length records, fields, and sub-fields, with unique naming conventions that reflect its multivalued database characteristics. Records are identified by unique keys that facilitate direct access to their storage locations.

Initially constrained by the era&#x27;s technological limitations, the Pick system&#x27;s capacity has expanded over time, removing earlier record-size limits and introducing dynamic file allocation and B-tree indexing to enhance data management capabilities.

The Pick database operates without explicit data types, treating all data as character strings, which places the onus of data integrity on the applications developed for the system. This flexibility allows Pick to store data in non-first-normal-form, avoiding the need for join operations by containing all related data within single records. This approach can optimize storage and retrieval efficiency for specific kinds of datasets.

==History==
Pick was originally implemented as the Generalized Information Retrieval Language System (GIRLS) on an IBM System/360 in 1965 by Don Nelson and Dick Pick at TRW, whose government contract for the Cheyenne Helicopter project required developing a database. It was supposed to be used by the U.S. Army to control the inventory of Cheyenne helicopter parts.

Pick was subsequently commercially released in 1973 by Microdata Corporation (and its British distributor CMC) as the Reality Operating System now supplied by Northgate Information Solutions. McDonnell Douglas bought Microdata in 1981.

The first Microdata implementation, called the Reality, came only with a procedural language (PROC), and a query language (ENGLISH). In 1975, Ken Simms of Pick Systems created an implementation of Dartmouth BASIC for the Reality, with numerous syntax extensions for smart terminal interface and database operations, and it was called Data/BASIC. At or near the same time, SMI of Chicago, created an extended procedural language and called it RPL.

PROC, the procedure language was provided for executing scripts. A SQL-style language called ENGLISH allowed database retrieval and reporting, but not updates (although later, the ENGLISH command &quot;REFORMAT&quot; allowed updates on a batch basis). ENGLISH did not fully allow manipulating the 3-dimensional multivalued structure of data records. Nor did it directly provide common relational capabilities such as joins. This was because powerful data dictionary redefinitions for a field allowed joins via the execution of a calculated lookup in another file. The system included a spooler. A simple text editor for file-system records was provided, but the editor was only suitable for system maintenance, and could not lock records, so most applications were written with the other tools such as Batch, RPL, or the BASIC language so as to ensure data validation and allow record locking.

By the early 1980s observers saw the Pick Operating System as a strong competitor to Unix. &quot;BYTE&quot; in 1984 stated that &quot;Pick is simple and powerful, and it seems to be efficient and reliable, too ... because it works well as a multiuser system, it&#x27;s probably the most cost-effective way to use an XT&quot;. Dick Pick founded Pick &amp; Associates, later renamed Pick Systems, then Raining Data, then () TigerLogic, and finally Rocket Software. He licensed &quot;Pick&quot; to a large variety of manufacturers and vendors who have produced different &quot;flavors&quot; of Pick. The database flavors sold by TigerLogic were D3, mvBase, and mv Enterprise. Those previously sold by IBM under the &quot;U2&quot; umbrella are known as UniData and UniVerse. Rocket Software purchased IBM&#x27;s U2 family of products in 2010 and Tiger Logic&#x27;s D3 and mvBase family of products in 2014. In 2021, Rocket acquired OpenQM and jBASE as well.

Dick Pick died at age 56 due to stroke complications in October 1994.

Pick Systems often became tangled in licensing litigation, and devoted relatively little effort to marketing and improving its software. Subsequent ports of Pick to other platforms generally offered the same tools and capabilities for many years, usually with relatively minor improvements and simply renamed (for example, Data/BASIC became Pick/BASIC and ENGLISH became ACCESS). Licensees often developed proprietary variations and enhancements; for example, Microdata created an input processor called ScreenPro.

==Derivative and related products==

The Pick database was licensed to roughly three dozen licensees between 1978 and 1984. Application-compatible implementations evolved into derivatives and also inspired similar systems.

* Reality – The first implementation of the Pick database was on a Microdata platform using firmware and called Reality. The first commercial release was in 1973. Microdata acquired CMC Ltd. in the early 80s and were based in Hemel Hempstead, England. The Microdata implementations ran in firmware, so each upgrade had to be accompanied by a new configuration chip. Microdata itself was eventually bought by McDonnell Douglas Information Systems. Pick and Microdata sued each other for the right to market the database, the final judgment being that they both had the right. In addition to the Reality Sequoia and Pegasus series of computers, Microdata and CMC Ltd. sold the Sequel (Sequoia) series which was a much larger class able to handle over 1000 simultaneous users. The earlier Reality minicomputers were known to handle well over 200 simultaneous users, although performance was slow and it was above the official limit. Pegasus systems superseded Sequoia and could handle even more simultaneous users than its predecessors. The modern version of this original Pick implementation is owned and distributed by Northgate Information Solutions Reality.
* Ultimate – The second implementation of the Pick database was developed in about 1978 by an American company called The Ultimate Corp, run by Ted Sabarese. Like the earlier Microdata port, this was a firmware implementation, with the Pick instruction set in firmware and the monitor in assembly code on a Honeywell Level 6 machine. The system had dual personalities in that the monitor/kernel functions (mostly hardware I/O and scheduling) were executed by the native Honeywell Level 6 instruction set. When the monitor &quot;select next user&quot; for activation control was passed to the Honeywell WCS (writable control store) to execute Pick assembler code (implemented in microcode) for the selected process. When the user&#x27;s time slice expired control was passed back to the kernel running the native Level 6 instruction set.
** Ultimate took this concept further with the DEC LSI/11 family of products by implementing a co-processor in hardware (bit-slice, firmware driven). Instead of a single processor with a WCS microcode enhanced instruction set, this configuration used two independent but cooperating CPUs. The LSI11 CPU executed the monitor functions and the co-processor executed the Pick assembler instruction set. The efficiencies of this approach resulted in a 2× performance improvement. The co-processor concept was used again to create a 5×, 7×, and dual-7× versions for Honeywell Level 6 systems. Dual ported memory with private busses to the co-processors were used to increase performance of the LSI11 and Level 6 systems.
** Another version used a DEC LSI-11 for the IOP and a 7X board. Ultimate enjoyed moderate success during the 1980s, and even included an implementation running as a layer on top of DEC VAX systems, the 750, 780, 785, and later the MicroVAX. Ultimate also had versions of the Ultimate Operating System running on IBM 370 series systems (under VM and native) and also the 9370 series computers. Ultimate was renamed Allerion, Inc., before liquidation of its assets. Most assets were acquired by Groupe Bull, and consisted of mostly maintaining extant hardware. Bull had its own problems and in approximately 1994 the US maintenance operation was sold to Wang.
* Prime INFORMATION – Devcom, a Microdata reseller, wrote a Pick-style database system called INFORMATION in FORTRAN and assembler in 1979 to run on Prime Computer 50-series systems. It was then sold to Prime Computer and renamed Prime INFORMATION. It was subsequently sold to VMark Software Inc. This was the first of the guest operating environment implementations. INFO/BASIC, a variant of Dartmouth BASIC, was used for database applications.
* Applied Digital Data Systems (ADDS) – First developed in 1981. This was the first implementation to be done in software only, so upgrades were accomplished by a tape load, rather than a new chip. The &quot;Mentor&quot; line was initially based on the Zilog Z-8000 chipset and this port set off a flurry of other software implementations across a wide array of processors with a large emphasis on the Motorola 68000.
* &quot;UniVerse&quot; – Another implementation of the system, called UniVerse, was created by VMark Software and operated under Unix and Microsoft Windows. This was the first one to incorporate the ability to emulate other implementations of the system, such as Microdata&#x27;s Reality Operating System, and Prime INFORMATION. Originally running on Unix, it was later also made available for Windows. It now is owned by Rocket Software. (The systems developed by Prime Computer and VMark are now owned by Rocket Software and referred to as &quot;U2&quot;.)
* UniData – Very similar to UniVerse, but UniData had facilities to interact with other Windows applications. It is also owned and distributed by Rocket Software.
* PI/open – Prime Computer rewrote Prime INFORMATION in C for the Unix-based systems it was selling, calling it PI+. It was then ported to other Unix systems offered by other hardware vendors and renamed PI/open.
* Fujitsu Microsystems of America – Another software implementation, existing in the late 1980s. Fujitsu Microsystems of America was acquired by Alpha Microsystems on October 28, 1989.
* Pyramid – Another software implementation in the 1980s
* General Automation &quot;Zebra&quot; – Another software implementation in the 1980s
* Altos – A software implementation on an 8086 chipset platform launched around 1983.
* Wicat/Pick – Another software implementation existing in the 1980s
* Sequoia – Another software implementation, existing from 1984. Sequoia was most well known for its fault-tolerant multi-processor model, which could be dialed into with the user&#x27;s permission and his switching terminal zero to remote with the key on the system consol. He could watch what was done by the support person who had dialed on his terminal 0, a printer with a keyboard. Pegasus came out in 1987. The Enterprise Systems business unit (which was the unit that sold Pick), was sold to General Automation in 1996/1997.
* Revelation – In 1984, Cosmos released a Pick-style database called Revelation, later Advanced Revelation, for DOS on the IBM PC. Advanced Revelation is now owned by Revelation Technologies, which publishes a GUI-enabled version called OpenInsight.
* jBASE – jBASE was released in 1991 by a small company of the same name in Hemel Hempstead, England. Written by former Microdata engineers, jBASE emulates all implementations of the system to some degree. jBASE compiles applications to native machine code form, rather than to an intermediate byte code. In 2015, cloud solutions provider Zumasys in Irvine, California, acquired the jBASE distribution rights from Mpower1 as well as the intellectual property from Temenos Group. On 14 Oct 2021, Zumasys announced they had sold their databases and tools, including jBASE to Rocket Software.
* UniVision – UniVision was a Pick-style database designed as a replacement for the Mentor version, but with extended features, released in 1992 by EDP in Sheffield, England.
* OpenQM – The only MultiValue database product available both as a fully supported non-open source commercial product and in open source form under the General Public License. OpenQM is available from its exclusive worldwide distributor, Zumasys.
* Caché – In 2005 InterSystems, the maker of Caché database, announced support for a broad set of MultiValue extensions, Caché for MultiValue.
* ONware – ONware equips MultiValue applications with the ability to use common databases such as Oracle and SQL Server. Using ONware, MultiValue applications can be integrated with relational, object, and object-relational applications.
* D3 – Pick Systems ported the Pick Operating System to run as a database product utilizing host operating systems such as Unix, Linux, or Windows servers, with the data stored within the file system of the host operating system. Previous Unix or Windows versions had to run in a separate partition, which made interfacing with other applications difficult. The D3 releases opened the possibility of integrating internet access to the database or interfacing to popular word processing and spreadsheet applications, which has been successfully demonstrated by a number of users. The D3 family of databases and related tools is owned and distributed by Rocket Software.

Through the implementations above, and others, Pick-like systems became available as database, programming, and emulation environments running under many variants of Unix and Microsoft Windows.

<doc id="471224" wikidata="Q436942" url="?curid=471224" title="Grant Devine">
<text>Donald Grant Devine (born July 5, 1944) is a Canadian politician who served as the 11th premier of Saskatchewan from 1982 to 1991. He led the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan from 1979 to 1992 and is one of only two leaders of that party to serve as premier, following James Anderson.

Prior to entering politics, Devine taught agricultural marketing and consumer economics at the University of Saskatchewan. After being elected leader of the Progressive Conservatives (PCs) in 1979, he led the party to victory in the 1982 election. Devine&#x27;s tenure was marked by tax reductions, privatization of state-owned companies, increased financial support for farmers, and the quadrupling of the provincial debt. Devine&#x27;s PCs were re-elected in 1986 but lost power in the 1991 election. Devine later sought a federal nomination with the Conservative Party, but his candidacy was declined by the party; he subsequently ran unsuccessfully as an Independent in the 2004 federal election.

Devine&#x27;s tenure as Premier left a contentious legacy in the province. When Devine lost office in 1991, he was the fourth-longest serving premier in Saskatchewan history. He is noted for implementing neoliberal economic policy in Saskatchewan, shifting the province towards a market-based economic outlook and away from the economic planning that marked decades of Co-operative Commonwealth and New Democratic Party governance. However, when the PCs lost the 1991 election, the province was on the brink of bankruptcy. The unpopularity of Devine and the PCs in the 1990s, which was further exacerbated in the middle of that decade by revelations of a major expense fraud scandal, contributed directly to the founding of the Saskatchewan Party as a new conservative political party in the province. Observers have noted that Devine&#x27;s party largely staked its success on a growing divide between urban and rural interests in the province, contributing to a deepening of that divide.

== Early life ==

Born in Regina, Saskatchewan on 5 July 1944, Devine was raised on his grandfather&#x27;s farm near Lake Valley. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Agriculture from the University of Saskatchewan in 1967, a master&#x27;s degree in Agricultural Economics from the University of Alberta in 1970, and a PhD in Agricultural Economics from Ohio State University in 1976. Devine taught agricultural marketing and consumer economics at the University of Saskatchewan from 1976 to 1979.

== Entry into politics ==

Devine&#x27;s first foray into politics came during the 1978 provincial election when he ran for the Progressive Conservatives in the riding of Saskatoon Nutana. Although Devine was defeated, the PCs under leader Dick Collver won 17 seats and became the Official Opposition in their best showing since 1929. Despite the success, Collver resigned as leader in 1979 and Devine decided to run to replace him. In November 1979, Devine was chosen as the new PC leader. The following November, Devine contested a by-election in the riding of Estevan, losing a close three-way race by 60 votes.

=== 1982 election ===
Devine led the Progressive Conservatives in the 1982 election against the governing New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Premier Allan Blakeney, who had been in office since 1971. Running under the slogan, &quot;There&#x27;s so much more we can be&quot;, Devine campaigned on promoting free enterprise, eliminating the gasoline tax, and guaranteeing home mortgage rates at 13.25 percent; interest rates under the NDP government were then at 18 percent. Devine&#x27;s campaign was considered populist, and he worked to project what has been described as a &quot;folksy, down-home image&quot;. The election result on 26 April was a landslide victory for the Progressive Conservatives, who won 55 out of 64 seats and 54 percent of the popular vote. Devine won the Estevan seat and became the second Progressive Conservative premier in Saskatchewan history, with the party forming government for the first time since James Anderson was premier from 1929 to 1934, and for the first time ever as a majority. Devine&#x27;s PCs were notably inexperienced in government—only fifteen MLAs were incumbents, and none had experience in government.

== Premier of Saskatchewan (1982–1991) ==
Devine took office after more than a decade of NDP government marked by state-led economic development, particularly in the realm of natural resources, and an expansion of public services and healthcare. His campaign made clear that his government would favour private over state-led investment. However, observers have noted that early on Devine&#x27;s government &quot;lacked ideological clarity&quot;—although it did cut taxes, it also spent quite freely. In fact, commentators have noted a distinct difference in approach between Devine&#x27;s first term in office from 1982 to 1986, and his second term after being re-elected in 1986. The latter term was marked by a close relationship with Brian Mulroney&#x27;s federal Progressive Conservatives, and a fuller embrace of neoliberal economic policy, exemplified most clearly in Devine&#x27;s austerity policies and privatization agenda.

=== Economic policies ===

One of Devine&#x27;s first actions as premier was to organize an &quot;Open for Business&quot; conference in October 1982 to emphasize free enterprise and private investment in Saskatchewan and the fact that the &quot;socialist&quot; era in the province, represented by the NDP, was over. His government honoured its pledge to eliminate the 20 percent gasoline tax and lowered interest rates.

When the Devine government took office, the provincial budget was balanced. The Devine government ran consecutive deficit budgets—the deficit peaked in fiscal year 1986–87 at $1.2 billion—as a result of their policies of tax cuts and rebates, mortgage subsidies, drastic increases in election spending, and multi-million dollar investments in several money-losing megaprojects. During Devine&#x27;s premiership, Saskatchewan&#x27;s debt grew from $3.5 billion to $15 billion in fiscal year 1991–1992; by this time, annual interest payments had exceeded $500 million and were the third-largest component in the budget after health and education. This left the province facing the prospect of bankruptcy.

As part of a bid to deal with the worsening financial situation, Devine&#x27;s PCs privatized crown corporations ranging from Saskatchewan Minerals, worth $15 million, to the Potash Corporation, worth more than $1 billion. The government attempted to privatize SaskEnergy, the natural gas division of SaskPower, but a legislative walk-out by the Opposition—and a public petition with over 100,000 signatures—prevented it. While privatizing public companies, Devine&#x27;s government proved eager to supply loans and subsidies to private businesses, helping result in the construction of two heavy oil upgraders, a fertilizer plant, and pulp and paper mills.

=== Agricultural policies ===

Devine opposed government ownership of land, and in 1982 his government abolished the Land Bank, which had been established by the NDP in 1974 and sought to aid the intergenerational transfer of farmland. The PCs replaced it with 8 percent loans to allow farmers to buy their own land. The main reason cited for the closure of the Land Bank was the fact that it led to a large amount of land being acquired by the government.

The Devine government offered a universal, low-interest loan program to farmers that cost the province $1 billion. In 1989, Devine&#x27;s government began to subsidize crop revenues by introducing the Net Income Stabilization Account and the Gross Revenue Insurance Program; this marked the start of the province directly supporting crop farm incomes. The programs were deemed critical given a prolonged drought and depressed grain prices that created serious financial trouble for the province&#x27;s agricultural sector.

=== Energy policies ===

Devine&#x27;s government introduced a three-year royalty holiday for new oil wells and cut royalties for existing ones. This led to a significant increase in drilling, though the government experienced lower revenues due to low royalties. In 1986, Devine&#x27;s government privatized SaskOil by taking the majority of the company public; its name was changed to Wascana Energy Inc. and shares were made available on the public market. In 1987, the last remaining government interest in the corporation was sold to Canadian Occidental Petroleum. The province also sold the Saskatchewan Mining Development Corporation, which had been a key player in developing uranium mining the province. Devine&#x27;s government also cut funding for research and development in alternative energy, including closing the provincial Office of Energy Conservation in 1982.

=== 1986 election ===
In the 1986 election, Devine&#x27;s PCs were re-elected with a reduced majority, making Devine the only PC leader to win re-election in the province. However, the victory had not been a foregone conclusion. Devine banked significantly on pre-election spending, particularly on rural initiatives and farmers. Crucially, just before the election, Devine secured a $1 billion farming aid package from Ottawa. In addition, the government offered homeowners $1,500 home-improvement grants. While the PCs presented a pre-election budget with a $389 million deficit, the actual deficit proved to be well over $1 billion.

The NDP, with Blakeney still at the helm, narrowly won a plurality of the popular vote in 1986. However, Devine&#x27;s emphasis on rural Saskatchewan paid off, and although the party was nearly swept out of Regina and Saskatoon, the rural vote helped the PCs secure 38 seats to 25 for the NDP.

=== 1991 election and aftermath ===
It was clear that Devine&#x27;s government had become deeply unpopular leading up to the next provincial election, which Devine put off calling as long as legally possible. The dire financial situation led Devine to cancel several of its central commitments in 1990, including the home improvement program, its mortgage reduction program, and its gas tax rebate. His government was criticized late in its second term for undemocratic legislative tactics, including proroguing the Legislature and financing expenditures through the dubious use of special warrants. In its determination to privatize PotashCorp in 1989, the PCs enacted closure for the first time in Saskatchewan history to avoid debate and public scrutiny on the issue. Public opposition to service cuts led to organized resistance, including one of the largest public protests in Regina history with approximately seven thousand people descending on the Legislature in 1987. Also unpopular was a pre-election proposal to create a &quot;Fair Share, Saskatchewan&quot; program that promised to &#x27;redistribute&#x27; more than 1,300 government and crown corporation jobs from Regina to smaller communities throughout the province—the scheme was seen as another bid to buy rural votes, and one that was in no way necessary. Privatizations, cuts to social programs, and the drastic increase in provincial debt also contributed to Devine&#x27;s unpopularity, as did his close relationship with Mulroney&#x27;s unpopular federal PCs.

After two terms in power, Devine&#x27;s PCs suffered a landslide defeat in the 1991 election at the hands of the NDP, now led by former attorney general Roy Romanow. The PCs were reduced to 10 seats in the legislature, all of them rural. Devine initially stayed on as Opposition leader. On 8 October 1992, he announced his resignation as Progressive Conservative leader, effective 31 December 1992.

Bill Boyd succeeded Devine as party leader, and particularly after revelations of a major expense fraud scandal began to surface publicly in 1995 (see below), Boyd tried to brand the party as the &quot;New PCs&quot;. However, the party was further reduced to 5 seats and third party status in the 1995 election. In 1997, when much of the party membership helped to establish and migrated to the Saskatchewan Party, the PC party executive voted to effectively place the party in dormancy for at least the following two election cycles.

=== Fraud scandal ===

After an RCMP investigation concluded in 1995, it was revealed that the PCs were responsible for a major expense fraud scheme that unfolded during the party&#x27;s second term in office, between 1987 and 1991. Claiming fraudulent expenses through faulty invoices from shell companies, party members—including MLAs and cabinet members—defrauded the province of $837,000. Ultimately, nineteen staff members and MLAs were charged in the scheme, and fifteen were convicted, including ten cabinet members and a caucus chair. Several of those convicted went on to serve prison sentences. Devine was never charged in the scheme, and he testified that as premier, he was too busy to pay attention to finances and was never aware of it, stating that, &quot;In my entire political career, I have never been involved in, approved, or condoned or even been aware of any illegal activity or wrongdoing.&quot; Although Devine ultimately said that he accepted responsibility given his role as party leader, he also lamented that he and others in the party had been made &quot;guilty by innuendo&quot; and admitted to feeling &quot;betrayed&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The legacy of Devine&#x27;s government was undoubtedly tarnished by the expense fraud scandal, which has been called &quot;easily the biggest political scandal in Saskatchewan&#x27;s history,&quot; and led to Devine&#x27;s PCs being labeled &quot;one of the most corrupt governments in Canadian history&quot;. The scandal was a major factor in the declining fortunes of the party and the consequent founding of the Saskatchewan Party, which in the twenty-first century has earned the label of the province&#x27;s new natural governing party, earning praise from Devine himself. However, the politics of the Devine era have also had a defining impact on the province. In particular, observers have noted that the Devine era marked an entrenchment of neoliberal economic policy in the province and a deepening divide between rural and urban issues and voters.

Saskatchewan historian Bill Waiser has argued that while politics in the province were for decades defined by debates over socialism and free enterprise, Devine—who himself embraced that debate—shifted the defining political divide towards a cleavage between urban and rural interests. This was a result of Devine&#x27;s intent focus on rural priorities, including agriculture—in a stark example, Devine essentially staked the 1986 election on rural and farm support. Political analyst Dale Eisler, meanwhile, has written that Saskatchewan politics can be grouped into distinct &quot;Before Devine&quot; and &quot;After Devine&quot; categories. Devine&#x27;s embrace of neoliberal economics, including the sell-off of significant public assets, shifted the economic landscape of the province, which since the 1940s had relied largely on state-led investment and crown corporations for economic development. Moreover, the accumulation of debt under Devine left the province on the brink of bankruptcy; when Roy Romanow&#x27;s NDP drastically cut spending to deal with the fiscal crisis, it signaled an entrenchment of neoliberalism. When many of the cuts of the Romanow era were seen as detrimental to rural Saskatchewan in particular, the urban-rural divide was deepened even further.

== Later career and honours ==

In January 2004, Devine announced his intention to return to politics and run for the federal Conservative Party in the riding of Souris—Moose Mountain, which encompassed his former provincial riding of Estevan. Although he had been encouraged to run by Conservative deputy leader Peter MacKay, the party ultimately ruled that Devine was an undesirable candidate—due in part to the Saskatchewan PC expense fraud scandal—and denied him the nomination. On 7 May, Devine announced that he would run as an independent candidate in the 2004 federal election in Souris—Moose Mountain. Consequently, Devine was expelled from the Conservative Party on 8 June by the party&#x27;s executive council. Devine went on to finish second to Conservative Ed Komarnicki.

In 2009, Devine was appointed to the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, an honour that was first introduced when he was serving as premier in 1985. In 2017, a dam and reservoir near Alameda, Saskatchewan, originally called the Alameda Dam, was re-named after Devine; Devine had helped to create the project, which was opened in 1994.

In 2017, Devine was appointed by the provincial government to the University of Saskatchewan&#x27;s board of governors.

He is also a member of Association of Iranian Journalists.

==Political career==
In 1975, Tajzadeh went to the United States to study and became a member of Muslim Students Association, active against Shah of Iran. With the start of the Iranian Revolution in 1978, he left university and returned to Iran.

Tajzadeh served as the Political deput of the Ministry of Interior of Iran in the government of Mohammad Khatami, and under the Minister Abdollah Noori, since 1997, after being introduced to Noori by Gholamhossein Karbaschi and Mohammad Atrianfar. The first Iranian elections for the City and Village Councils of Iran happened under Tajzadeh. Later, he became an Adviser to the President of Iran, Mohammad Khatami, from November 21, 2004 until the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

He started working in the Islamic Republic government as an employee of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance in May 1982. He went up to become a vice minister when Mohammad Khatami was the Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance. He left the ministry after a while, and worked for the newspaper Hamshahri until 1997.

Tajzadeh was one of seven leading reformists who filed a lawsuit against several commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) for their alleged intervention in Iran&#x27;s presidential elections.

== Government work ban ==
In March 2001, while he was Political deputy at Ministry of Interior faced with charges of election fraud at 2000 Iranian legislative election after a clash with Guardian Council. He was barred from all government employment for three years, but did not appeal the verdict.

== Imprisonment ==
Amnesty International reported that he was arrested in June 2009, amidst the 2009 Iranian election protests. He was convicted of &quot;assembly and collusion against national security&quot; and &quot;propaganda against the regime&quot;, sentenced to 6 years in prison and a 10-year ban on political and press activities by Branch 15 of the Tehran Islamic Revolutionary Court. He was imprisoned in Evin Prison from 2009 until 2016. In 2014, while still in prison, he faced new charges and was convicted of another 1 year in prison.

During an interview with Iranian Documentarist Mr. Hossein Dehbashi, Mr. Tajzadeh acknowledged that he was not a good student during the last years of high school in Iran and received his high school diploma with difficulty but chose to continue his academic studies in the US in mid &#x27;70&#x27;s since, according to Mr. Tajzadeh, &quot;American universities and colleges were easy to enroll in&quot;. Mr. Tajzadeh, during the same interview with Mr. Dehbashi, stated: &quot;I enrolled at Siskiyous College between Houston and Dallas [in Texas] just to have my [US issued] Student&#x27;s Visa renewed but I let it go after a while&quot;. In fact, Mr. Tajzadeh acknowledges that he did not study in the US at all.&quot;But [there in Texas] we established &quot;Falagh&quot; Group since we believed in armed resistance and fighting against the Shah&#x27;s Regime. &quot;I went back to Iran then but my other friends like Mr. Khosravi, Mr. Baezi and some others left [USA] directly for Syria and Lebanon to be trained&quot;; continued Mr. Tajzadeh.

<doc id="471230" wikidata="Q216173" url="?curid=471230" title="Free City of Danzig">
<text>The Free City of Danzig (; ) was a city-state under the protection and oversight of the League of Nations between 1920 and 1939, consisting of the Baltic Sea port of Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland) and nearly 200 other small localities in the surrounding areas. The polity was created on 15 November 1920 in accordance with the terms of Article 100 (Section XI of Part III) of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles after the end of World War I.

Although predominantly German-populated, the territory was bound by the imposed union with Poland covering foreign policy, defence, customs, railways and post, but remained distinct from both the post-war German Republic and the newly independent Polish Republic. In addition, Poland was given certain rights pertaining to port facilities in the city.

In the 1920 Constituent Assembly election, the Polish Party received over 6% of the vote, but its percentage of votes later declined to about 3%. A large number of Danzig Poles voted for the Catholic Centre Party instead. In 1921, Poland began to develop the city of Gdynia, then a midsized fishing town. This completely new port north of Danzig was established on territory awarded in 1919, the so-called Polish Corridor. By 1933, the commerce passing through Gdynia exceeded that of Danzig. By 1936, the city&#x27;s senate had a majority of local Nazis, and agitation to rejoin Germany was stepped up. Many Jews fled from German persecution.

After the German invasion of Poland in 1939, the Nazis abolished the Free City and incorporated the area into the newly formed of Danzig-West Prussia. The Nazis classified the Poles and Jews living in the city as subhumans, subjecting them to discrimination, forced labor, and extermination at Nazi concentration camps, including nearby Stutthof (now Sztutowo, Poland). Upon the city&#x27;s capture in the early months of 1945 by the Soviet and Polish troops, a significant number of German inhabitants perished in ill-prepared and over-delayed attempts to evacuate by sea, while the remainder fled or were expelled.

The city was fully integrated into Poland as a result of the Potsdam Agreement, while members of the pre-war Polish ethnic minority started returning and new Polish settlers began to come. Gdańsk suffered severe underpopulation from these events and did not recover until the late 1950s.

==Establishment==
===Periods of independence and autonomy===
Danzig had an early history of independence. It was a leading player in the Prussian Confederation directed against the Teutonic Monastic State of Prussia. The Confederation stipulated with the Polish king, Casimir IV Jagiellon, that the Polish Crown would be invested with the role of head of state of western parts of Prussia (Royal Prussia). In contrast, Ducal Prussia remained a Polish fief. Danzig and other cities such as Elbing and Thorn financed most of the warfare and enjoyed a high level of city autonomy. 

In 1569, when Royal Prussia&#x27;s estates agreed to incorporate the region into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the city insisted on preserving its special status. It defended itself through the costly Siege of Danzig in 1577 in order to preserve special privileges, and subsequently insisted on negotiating by sending emissaries directly to the Polish king. Danzig&#x27;s location as a deep-water port where the Vistula river met the Baltic Sea had made it into one of the wealthiest cities in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries as grain from Poland and Ukraine was shipped down the Vistula on barges to be loaded onto ships in Danzig, where it was shipped on to western Europe. As many of the merchants shipping the grain from Danzig were Dutch, who built Dutch-style houses for themselves, leading to other Danzigers imitating them, the city was thus given a distinctively Dutch appearance. Danzig become known as &quot;the Amsterdam of the East&quot;, a wealthy seaport and trading crossroads that linked together the economics of western and eastern Europe, and whose location at where the Vistula flowed into the Baltic led to various powers competing to rule the city.

Although Danzig became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, Prussia was conquered by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806, and in September 1807 Napoleon declared Danzig a semi-independent client state of the French Empire, known as the Free City of Danzig. It lasted seven years, until it was re-incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia in 1814, after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Leipzig (Battle of Nations) by a coalition that included Russia, Austria, and Prussia. 

Point 13 of U.S. president Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points called for Polish independence to be restored and for Poland to have &quot;secure access to the sea&quot;, a promise that implied that Danzig, which occupied a strategic location where the Vistula river flowed into the Baltic sea, should become part of Poland. At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, the Polish delegation led by Roman Dmowski asked for Wilson to honor point 13 of the Fourteen Points by transferring Danzig to Poland, arguing that Poland would not be economically viable without Danzig and that since the city had been part of Poland until 1793, it was rightfully part of Poland anyway. However, Wilson had promised that national self-determination would be the basis of the Treaty of Versailles. As 90% of the people in Danzig in this period were German, the Allied leaders at the Paris Peace Conference compromised by creating the Free City of Danzig, a city-state in which Poland had certain special rights. It was felt that including a city that was 90% German into Poland would be a violation of the principle of national self-determination, but at the same time the promise in the Fourteen Points of allowing Poland &quot;secure access to the sea&quot; gave Poland a claim on Danzig, hence the compromise of the Free City of Danzig.

The Free City of Danzig was largely the work of British diplomacy as both the French Premier Georges Clemenceau and U.S. President Woodrow Wilson supported the Polish claim to Danzig (Gdańsk), and it was only objections from the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George that prevented Danzig from going to Poland. Despite creating the Free City, the British did not really believe in the viability of the Free City of Danzig with Lloyd George writing at the time: &quot;France would tomorrow fight for Alsace if her right to it were contested. But would we make war for Danzig?&quot; The Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour wrote in the summer of 1918 that the Germans had such a ferocious contempt for Poles that it was unwise for Germany to lose any territory to Poland even if morally justified as the Germans would never accept losing land to the despised Poles and such a situation was bound to cause a war. During the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, the British consistently sought to minimize German territorial losses to Poland under the grounds that the Germans had such an utter contempt for the Poles together with the rest of the Slavic peoples that such losses were bound to deeply wound their feelings and cause a war. For all the bitterness of the French–German enmity, the Germans had a certain grudging respect for the French that did not extend to the Poles at all. During the Paris Peace Conference, a commission of inquiry chaired by a British historian, James Headlam-Morley, investigating where the borders between Germany and Poland should be, started to research Danzig&#x27;s history. Upon discovering that Danzig had been a Free City in the past, Headlam-Morley came up with what he regarded as a brilliant compromise solution under which Danzig would become a Free City again that would belong to neither Germany nor Poland. As the British were opposed to Danzig becoming part of Poland and the French and the Americans to Danzig remaining part of Germany, Headlam-Morley&#x27;s compromise of the Free City of Danzig was embraced.

The rural areas around Danzig were overwhelmingly Polish and the representatives of the Polish farmers around Danzig complained about being included in the Free City of Danzig, stating they wanted to join Poland. For their part, the representatives of the German population of Danzig complained about being severed from Germany, and constantly demanded that the Free City of Danzig be reincorporated into the &quot;Reich&quot;. The Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan wrote that a sense of Danzig national identity emerged during the Free City&#x27;s existence, and the German population of Danzig not always regarded themselves as Germans who had been unjustly taken out of Germany. The loss of Danzig did although deeply hurt German national pride and in the interwar period, German nationalists spoke of the &quot;open wound in the east&quot; that was the Free City of Danzig. However, until the building of Gdynia, almost all of Poland&#x27;s exports went through Danzig, and Polish public opinion was opposed to Germany having a &quot;choke-hold&quot; on the Polish economy.

===Territory===
The Free City of Danzig (1920–39) included the city of Danzig (Gdańsk), the towns of Zoppot (Sopot), Oliva (Oliwa), Tiegenhof (Nowy Dwór Gdański), Neuteich (Nowy Staw) and some 252 villages and 63 hamlets, covering a total area of 1,966 square kilometers (). The cities of Danzig (since 1818) and Zoppot (since 1920) formed independent cities (Stadtkreise), whereas all other towns and municipalities were part of one of the three rural districts (Landkreise), Danziger Höhe, (both seated in Danzig city) and , seated in Tiegenhof.

In 1928, its territory covered 1,952 km2 including 58 square kilometers of freshwater surface. The border had a length of 290.5 km, of which the coastline accounted for 66.35 km.

===Polish rights declared by Treaty of Versailles===
The Free City was to be represented abroad by Poland and was to be in a customs union with it. The German railway line that connected the Free City with newly created Poland was to be administered by Poland, as were all rail lines in the territory of the Free City. On November 9, 1920, a convention that provided for the Presence of a Polish diplomatic representative in Danzig was signed between the Polish government and the Danzig authorities. In article 6, the Polish government undertook not to conclude any international agreements regarding Danzig without previous consultation with the Free City&#x27;s government.

A separate Polish post office was established, besides the existing municipal one.

===League of Nations High Commissioners===

Unlike Mandatory territories, which were entrusted to member countries, the Free City of Danzig (like the Territory of the Saar Basin) remained directly under the authority of the League of Nations. Representatives of various countries took on the role of High Commissioner:

The League of Nations refused to let the city-state use the term of &quot;Hanseatic City&quot; as part of its official name; this referred to Danzig&#x27;s long-lasting membership in the Hanseatic League:

===State Constabulary===
With the creation of the Free City in the aftermath of World War I a security police force was created on 19 August 1919. On 9 April 1920, a military style marching band, the &quot;Musikkorps&quot;, was formed. Led by composer Ernst Stieberitz, the police band became well known in the city and abroad. In 1921, Danzig&#x27;s government reformed the entire institution and established the &quot;Schutzpolizei&quot;, or protection police. Helmut Froböss became President of the Police (i. e. Chief) on 1 April 1921. He served in this capacity until the German annexation of the city.

The police initially operated from 12 precincts and 7 registration points. In 1926 the number of precincts was reduced to 7.

After the Nazi takeover of the Senate, the police were increasingly used to suppress free speech and political dissent. In 1933, Froböss ordered the left-wing newspapers &quot;Danziger Volksstimme&quot; and &quot;Danziger Landeszeitung&quot; to suspend publications for 2 months and 8 days respectively.

By 1939, Polish-German relations had worsened and war seemed a likely possibility. The police began making plans to seize Polish installations within the city, in the event of conflict. Ultimately the Danzig police participated in the September Campaign, fighting alongside the local SS and the German Army at the city&#x27;s Polish post office and at Westerplatte.

Even though the Free City was formally annexed by Nazi Germany in October 1939, the police force more or less continued to operate as a law enforcement agency. The Stutthof concentration camp, 35 km east of the city, was run by the President of the police as an internment camp from 1939 until November 1941. Administration was finally dissolved when the city was occupied by the Soviets in 1945.

==Population==
The population and demographics of the Free City are a matter of some dispute over the period of its existence.

The Free City&#x27;s population rose from 357,000 (1919) to 408,000 in 1929; according to the official census, 95% were Germans, with the rest mainly either Kashubians or Poles. According to E. Cieślak, the population registers of the Free City show that in 1929 the Polish population numbered 35,000, or 10.7% of the population. Some estimates put the proportion of Danzig Poles between at between 10 and 13%. Henryk Stępniak estimates the 1929 Polish population as around 22,000, or around 6% of the population, increasing to around 13% in the 1930s.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the Polish population increased. According to some sources, in 1938, the Free City&#x27;s population of 410,000 was 98% German, 1% Polish and 1% other. Other estimates suggest the proportion of Poles in the population of the Free City was around 20% in 1939 or around 25% in 1936.

Based on the estimated voting patterns (according to Stępniak many Poles voted for the Catholic Zentrumspartei instead of Polish parties), Stępniak estimates the number of Poles in the city to be 25–30% of Catholics living within it or about 30–36 thousand people. Including around 4,000 Polish nationals who were registered in the city, Stępniak estimated the Polish population as 9.4–11% of population.

In contrast, Stefan Samerski estimates about 10 percent of the 130,000 Catholics were Polish. Andrzej Drzycimski estimates that Polish population at the end of 30s reached 20% (including Poles who arrived after the war).

The Polish population increased disproportionately in the 1920s and 1930s and was estimated at 20% shortly before the start of World War II in 1939. The Catholic priest Franciszek Rogaczewski estimated that Poles made up about 20% of the population of the Free City of Danzig in 1936. The accuracy of demographic estimates is complicated by the discrepancy between the ethnic and linguistic identities of the Danzig population - while 95% of the inhabitants of the Free City of Danzig were German-speaking, many Poles were bilingual and also spoke German, and were included in such estimates. Another significant minority were the Kashubs, another West Slavic group who derived their language from Pomeranian and had their own independent identity. Additionally, as the result of Kulturkampf laws, German Catholics, who made up about 40% of the city&#x27;s population, supported the Polish national movement and stood up for Polish interests. This was further exacerbated by anti-Catholic legislation introduced by NSDAP-dominated Danzig Senate, which involved arrests of Catholic clergy as well as the activists and members of the Catholic Centre Party. The Catholic Centre Party was friendly to the Danzig Poles, and many Poles voted for the Centre Party instead of Polish organisations. The German Catholic clergy in Danzig also strongly supported the Polish minority, and the Bishop of Danzig, Edward O&#x27;Rourke, actively fought for the interests of Danzig Poles.

In 1929, Tadeusz Kijański, a Polish citizen of Danzig, questioned the results of the official 1923 census, according to which only 3% to 1% of the Danzig population was Polish. Kijański pointed out that the census was conducted by the police, which was &quot;a deviation from the usual and only sensible and proven way of conducting this type of census&quot;. The police officers in charge of conducting the census were mostly German citizens who were granted Danzig citizenship for the duration of their service, and there were several incidents in which they intimidated the local non-German population. The census also often relied on information provided by landlords or homeowners instead of asking each citizen directly; as a result, Kijański stated that &quot;the results of the census show significant deviations from the actual proportions in terms of nationality data&quot;. According to Kijański, many Poles in Danzig did not reveal their nationality in the census as a result of this intimidation, as well as pressure from German employers. He estimated that Poles accounted for 14.5% of the Free City&#x27;s permanent population, but noted that the actual number of Poles may have been higher, as Poles made up 60% of all foreigners in Danzig at the time.

The Treaty of Versailles required that the newly formed state have its own citizenship, based on residency. German inhabitants lost their German citizenship with the creation of the Free City, but were given the right to re-obtain it within the first two years of the state&#x27;s existence. Anyone desiring German citizenship had to leave their property and make their residence outside the Free State of Danzig area in the remaining parts of Germany.

===Religion===
In 1924, 54.7% of the populace was Protestant (220,731 persons, mostly Lutherans within the united old-Prussian church), 34.5% was Roman Catholic (140,797 persons), and 2.4% Jewish (9,239 persons). Other Protestants included 5,604 Mennonites, 1,934 Calvinists (Reformed), 1,093 Baptists, 410 Free Religionists. The population also included 2,129 dissenters, 1,394 faithful of other religions and denominations, and 664 irreligionists.

The Jewish community grew from 2,717 in 1910 to 7,282 in 1923 and 10,448 in 1929, many of them immigrants from Poland and Russia.

====Regional Synodal Federation of the Free City of Danzig====

The mostly Lutheran and partially Reformed congregations situated in the territory of the Free City, which previously used to belong to the &quot;Ecclesiastical Province of West Prussia&quot; of the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union (EKapU), were transformed into the &quot;Regional Synodal Federation of the Free City of Danzig&quot; after 1920. The executive body of that ecclesiastical province, the consistory (est. 1 November 1886), was seated in Danzig. After 1920 it was restricted in its responsibility to those congregations within the Free City&#x27;s territory. First General Superintendent (1920–1933) and then Bishop (1933–1945) presided over the consistory.

Unlike the Second Polish Republic, which opposed the cooperation of the with EKapU, Volkstag and the Senate of Danzig approved cross-border religious bodies. Danzig&#x27;s Regional Synodal Federation — just as the regional synodal federation of the autonomous Memelland — retained the status of an ecclesiastical province within EKapU.

After the German annexation of the Free City in 1939, the EKapU merged the Danzig regional synodal federation in 1940 into the Ecclesiastical Region of Danzig-West Prussia. This included the Polish congregations of the United Evangelical Church in Poland in the homonymous Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and the German congregations in the West Prussia governorate. Danzig&#x27;s consistory functioned as an executive body for that region. With the flight and expulsion of most ethnically German Protestant parishioners from the area of the Free City of Danzig between 1945 and 1948, the congregations vanished.

In March 1945, the consistory had relocated to Lübeck and opened a refugee centre for Danzigers (Hilfsstelle beim evangelischen Konsistorium Danzig) led by Upper Consistorial Councillor . The Lutheran congregation of St. Mary&#x27;s Church could relocate its valuable parament collection and the presbytery granted it on loan to St. Annen Museum in Lübeck after the war. Other Lutheran congregations of Danzig could reclaim their church bells, which the Wehrmacht had requisitioned as non-ferrous metal for war purposes since 1940, but which had survived, not yet melted down, in storage (e.g. ) in the British zone of occupation. The presbyteries granted them usually to Northwestern German Lutheran congregations which had lost bells due to the war.

====Diocese of Danzig of the Roman Catholic Church====
The 36 Catholic parishes in the territory of the Free City in 1922 used to belong in equal shares to the Diocese of Culm, which was mostly Polish, and the Diocese of Ermland, which was mostly German. While the Second Polish Republic wanted all the parishes within the Free City to form part of Polish Culm, Volkstag and Senate wanted them all to become subject to German Ermland. In 1922 the Holy See suspended the jurisdictions of both dioceses over their parishes in the Free State and established an exempt apostolic administration for the territory.

The first apostolic administrator was Edward O&#x27;Rourke (born in Minsk and of Irish ancestry) who became Bishop of Danzig on the occasion of the elevation of the administration to an exempt diocese in 1925. He was naturalised as Danziger on the same occasion. In 1938 he resigned after quarrels with the Nazi-dominated Senate of Danzig on appointments of parish priests of Polish ethnicity. The senate also instigated the denaturalisation of O&#x27;Rourke, who subsequently became a Polish citizen. O&#x27;Rourke was succeeded by Bishop Carl Maria Splett, a native from the Free City area.

Splett remained bishop after the German annexation of the Free City. In early 1941, he applied for admitting the Danzig diocese as member in Archbishop Adolf Bertram&#x27;s Eastern German Ecclesiastical Province and thus at the Fulda Conference of Bishops; however, Bertram, also speaker of the Fulda conference, rejected the request. Any arguments that the Free City of Danzig had been annexed to Nazi Germany did not impress Bertram since Danzig&#x27;s annexation lacked international recognition. Until the reorganization of the Catholic dioceses in Danzig and the formerly eastern territories of Germany the diocesan territory remained unaltered and the see exempt. However, with the replacement of Danzig&#x27;s population between 1945 and 1948 by mostly Catholic Poles, the number of Catholic parishes increased and most formerly Protestant churches were taken over for Catholic services.

====Jewish Danzigers====
Since 1883 most of the Jewish congregations in the later territory of Free State had merged into the Synagogal Community of Danzig. Only the Jews of Tiegenhof ran their own congregation until 1938.

Danzig became a centre of Polish and Russian Jewish emigration to North America. Between 1920 and 1925 60,000 Jews emigrated via Danzig to the US and Canada. At the same time, between 1923 and 1929, Danzig&#x27;s own Jewish population increased from roughly 7,000 to 10,500. Native Jews and newcomers established themselves in the city and contributed to its civic life, culture and economy. Danzig became a venue for international meetings of Jewish organisations, such as the convention of delegates from Jewish youth organisations of various nations, attended by David Ben-Gurion, which founded the World Union of Jewish Youth on 2 September 1924 in the Schützenhaus venue. On 21 March 1926 the &quot;Zionistische Organisation für Danzig&quot; convened delegates of Hechalutz from all over for the first conference in Danzig using Hebrew as common language, also attended by Ben Gurion.

With a Nazi majority in the Volkstag and Senate, anti-Semitic persecution and discrimination occurred unsanctioned by the authorities. In contrast to Germany, which exercised capital outflow control since 1931, emigration of Danzig&#x27;s Jews was nonetheless somewhat easier, with capital transfers enabled by the Bank of Danzig. Moreover, the comparatively few Danzig Jews were offered easier refuge in safe countries because of favorable Free City migration quotas.

After the anti-Jewish riots of Kristallnacht of 9/10 November 1938 in Germany, similar riots took place on 12/13 November in Danzig. The Great Synagogue was taken over and demolished by the local authorities in 1939. Most Jews had already left the city, and the Jewish Community of Danzig decided to organize its own emigration in early 1939.

==Politics==

===Government===


The Free City was governed by the Senate of the Free City of Danzig, which was elected by the parliament (Volkstag) for a legislative period of four years. The official language was German, although the usage of Polish was guaranteed by law. The political parties in the Free City corresponded with the political parties in Weimar Germany; the most influential parties in the 1920s were the conservative German National People&#x27;s Party, the Social Democratic Party of the Free City of Danzig and the Catholic Centre Party. A Communist Party was founded in 1921 with its origins in the Spartacus League and the Communist Party of East Prussia. Several liberal parties and Free Voter&#x27;s Associations existed and ran in the elections with varying success. A Polish Party represented the Polish minority and received between 3% (1933) and 6% (1920) of the vote (in total, 4,358 votes in 1933 and 9,321 votes in 1920).

Initially, the Nazi Party had only a small amount of success (0.8% of the vote in 1927) and was even briefly dissolved. Its influence grew with the onset of difficult economic times and the increasing popularity of the Nazi Party in Germany proper. Albert Forster became the Gauleiter in October 1930. The Nazis won 50 percent of votes in the Volkstag elections of 28 May 1933, and took control of the Senate in June 1933, with Hermann Rauschning becoming President of the Senate of Danzig. In contrast to Germany, the Nazi Party was relatively weak in the Free City of Danzig, and remained unstable because of &quot;furious factional struggles&quot; which plagued the Nazi administration throughout its rule. The party membership was generally low, and the 1935 election in Danzig &quot;amounted to an electoral defeat for the Nazis&quot;. The democratic opposition remained strong and was able to temporarily block the Nazi Gleichschaltung policies between 1935 and 1937. German Catholics were supportive of the Polish minority and most Danzig Poles voted for the Catholic Centre Party. Social Democrats were also willing to cooperate with Catholics and Poles, and the Catholic Church in Danzig was pro-Polish and opposed National Socialism.

Rauschning was removed from his position by Forster and replaced by Arthur Greiser in November 1934. He later appealed to the public not to vote for the Nazis in the 1935 elections. Political opposition to the Nazis was repressed with several politicians being imprisoned and murdered. The economic policy of Danzig&#x27;s Nazi-led government, which increased the public expenditures for employment-creation programs and the retrenchment of financial aid from Germany led to a devaluation of more than 40% of the Danziger Gulden in 1935. The Gold reserves of the Bank of Danzig declined from 30 million Gulden in 1933 to 13 million in 1935 and the foreign asset reserve from 10 million to 250,000 Gulden. In 1935, Poland protested when Danzig&#x27;s Senate reduced the value of the Gulden so that it would be the same as the Polish zloty.

As in Germany, the Nazis introduced laws mirroring the Enabling Act and Nuremberg laws (November 1938); existing parties and unions were gradually banned. The presence of the League of Nations however still guaranteed a minimum of legal certainty. In 1935, the opposition parties, except for the Polish Party, filed a lawsuit to the Danzig High Court in protest against the manipulation of the Volkstag elections. The opposition also protested to the League of Nations, as did the Jewish Community of Danzig. The number of members of the Nazi Party in Danzig increased from 21,861 in June 1934 to 48,345 in September 1938.

===Foreign relations===
Foreign relations were handled by Poland. In 1927, the Free City of Danzig sent a military advisory mission to Bolivia. The Bolivian government of Hernando Siles Reyes wanted to continue the pre-World War I German military mission but the Treaty of Versailles prohibited that. The German officers, including Ernst Röhm, were transferred to the Danzig police force and then sent to Bolivia. In 1929, after problems with the mission, the British embassy handled the return of the German officers.

===German-Polish tensions===
The rights of the Second Polish Republic within the territory of the Free City were stipulated in the Treaty of Paris of 9 November 1920 and the Treaty of Warsaw of 24 October 1921. The details of the Polish privileges soon became a permanent matter of disputes between the local populace and the Polish State. While the representatives of the Free City tried to uphold the city&#x27;s autonomy and sovereignty, Poland sought to extend its privileges.

Throughout the Polish–Soviet War, local dockworkers went on strike and refused to unload ammunition supplies for the Polish Army. While the ammunition was finally unloaded by British troops, the incident led to the establishment of a permanent ammunition depot at the Westerplatte and the construction of a trade and naval port in Gdynia, whose total exports and imports surpassed those of Danzig in May 1932. In December 1925, the Council of the League of Nations agreed to the establishment of a Polish military guard of 88 men on the Westerplatte peninsula to protect the war material depot.

During the interwar period the Polish minority was heavily discriminated against by the German population, which openly attacked its members using racist slurs and harassment, and attacks against the Polish consulate by German students were praised by authorities. In June 1932, a crisis broke out when the Polish destroyer ORP &quot;Wicher&quot; was sent into Danzig harbour without the permission of the Senate to greet a visiting squadron of British destroyers. The crisis was resolved when the Free City granted more access rights to the Polish Navy in exchange for a promise to not take the &quot;Wicher&quot; back into Danzig harbour.

Several disputes between Danzig and Poland occurred in the sequel. The Free City protested against the Westerplatte depot, the placement of Polish letter boxes within the City and the presence of Polish war vessels at the harbour. The attempt of the Free City to join the International Labour Organization was rejected by the Permanent Court of International Justice at the League of Nations after protests of the Polish ILO delegate.

After Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, the Polish military doubled the number of 88 troops at Westerplatte in order to test the reaction of the new chancellor. After protests the additional troops were withdrawn. Nazi propaganda used these events in the Volkstag elections of May 1933, in which Nazis won absolute majority.

Until June 1933, the High Commissioner decided in 66 cases of dispute between Danzig and Poland; in 54 cases one of the parties appealed to the Permanent Court of International Justice. Subsequent disputes were resolved in direct negotiations between the Senate and Poland after both had agreed to abstain from further appeals to the International Court in the summer of 1933 and bilateral agreements were concluded.

In the aftermath of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934, Danzig–Polish relations improved and Adolf Hitler instructed the local Nazi government to cease anti-Polish actions. In return, Poland did not support the actions of the anti-Nazi opposition in Danzig. The Polish Ambassador to Germany, Józef Lipski, stated in a meeting with Hermann Göring
&quot;... that a National Socialist Senate in Danzig is also most desirable from our point of view, since it brought about a rapprochement between the Free City and Poland, I would like to remind him that we have always kept aloof from internal Danzig problems. In spite of approaches repeatedly made by the opposition parties, we rejected any attempt to draw us into action against the Senate. I mentioned quite confidentially that the Polish minority in Danzig was advised not to join forces with the opposition at the time of elections.&quot;
When Carl J. Burckhardt became High Commissioner in February 1937, both Poles and Germans openly welcomed his withdrawal, and Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Józef Beck notified him not to &quot;count on the support of the Polish State&quot; in the case of difficulties with the Senate or the Nazi Party.

While the Senate appeared to respect the agreements with Poland, the &quot;Nazification of Danzig proceeded relentlessly&quot; and Danzig became a springboard for anti-Polish propaganda among the German and Ukrainian minority in Poland. The Catholic Bishop of Danzig, Edward O&#x27;Rourke, was forced to withdraw after he had tried to implement four additional Polish nationals as parish priests in October 1937.

===Danzig crisis===

The German policy openly changed immediately after the Munich Conference in October 1938, when German Minister of Foreign Affairs Joachim von Ribbentrop demanded the incorporation of the Free City into the Reich. The Polish ambassador to Germany, Jozef Lipski, declined Ribbentrop&#x27;s offer, saying that Polish public opinion would not tolerate the Free City joining Germany and predicated that if Warsaw allowed that to happen, then the &quot;Sanation&quot; military dictatorship that had ruled Poland since 1926 would be overthrown. Ernst von Weizsäcker on 29 March 1939 told the Danzig government the &quot;Reich&quot; would carry out a policy to the &quot;Zermürbungspolitik&quot; (point of destruction) towards Poland, saying a compromise solution was not wanted, and on 5 April 1939 told Hans-Adolf von Moltke under no conditions was he to negotiate with the Poles.

All through the spring and summer of 1939 there was a massive media campaign in Germany demanding the immediate return of the Free City of Danzig to Germany under the slogan &quot;Home to the &quot;Reich&quot;!&quot;. However, the Danzig crisis was just a pretext for war. Ribbentrop ordered Count Hans-Adolf von Moltke, the German ambassador to Poland, not to negotiate with the Poles over Danzig as it was always Ribbentrop&#x27;s great fear that the Poles might actually agree to the Free City returning to Germany, thereby depriving the &quot;Reich&quot; of its pretext for attacking Poland.
In the middle of August, Beck offered a concession, saying that Poland was willing to give up its control of Danzig&#x27;s customs, a proposal which caused fury in Berlin. However, the leaders of the Free City sent a message to Berlin on 19 August 1939 saying: &quot;&quot;Gauleiter&quot; Forster intends to extend claims...Should the Poles yield again it is intended to increase the claims further in order to make accord impossible&quot;. The same day a telegram from Berlin expressed approval with the proviso: &quot;Discussions will have to be conducted and pressure exerted against Poland in such a way that responsibility for failure to come to an agreement and the consequences rest with Poland&quot;. On 23 August 1939, Albert Forster, the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Danzig, called a meeting of the Senate that voted to have the Free City rejoin Germany, raising tensions to the breaking point. The same meeting appointed Forster the Danzig State President, through this was due to Forster&#x27;s long-running rivalry with Arthur Greiser, a &quot;völkisch&quot; fanatic who regarded Forster as too soft on the Poles. Both the appointment of Forster as State President and the resolution calling for the Free City to rejoin the &quot;Reich&quot; were violations of the charter the League of Nations had given Danzig in 1920, and the matter should have been taken to the League of Nations&#x27;s Security Council for discussion.

Since these violations of the Danzig charter would have resulted in the League deposing the Danzig&#x27;s Nazi government, both the French and British prevented the matter from being referred to the Security Council. Instead the British and French applied strong pressure on the Poles not to send in a military force to depose the Danzig government, and appoint a mediator to resolve the crisis. By late August 1939, the crisis continued to escalate with the Senate confiscating on 27 August 1939 stocks of wheat, salt and petrol that belonged to the Polish businesses that were in the process of being exported or imported via the Free City, an action that led to sharp Polish complaints. The same day, 200 Polish workers at the Danzig shipyards were fired without severance pay and their identification papers revoked, meaning that they legally could not live in Danzig anymore. The Danzig government imposed food rationing, the Danzig newspapers took a militantly anti-Polish line, and almost every day there were &quot;incidents&quot; on the border with Poland. Ordinary people in Danzig were described as being highly worried in the last days of August 1939 as it become apparent that war was imminent. In the meantime, the German battleship &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot; had arrived in Danzig on 15 August. Originally, it was planned to send the light cruiser &quot;Königsberg&quot; to Danzig for what was described as a &quot;friendship visit&quot;, but it was decided at the last minute that a ship with more firepower was needed, leading to the &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot; with its guns being substituted. Upon anchoring in Danzig harbor, the &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot; ominously aimed its guns at the Polish Military Depot on the Westerplatte peninsula in a provocative gesture that further raised the tensions in the Free City.

At about 4:48am on 1 September 1939, the &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot; opened fire on the Westerplatte, firing the first shots of World War II.

==Second World War and aftermath==

On 1 September 1939, the day of the German invasion of the Free City of Danzig, Forster signed a law declaring the Free City to be incorporated into Germany. On the same day, Hitler signed a law declaring the law signed by Forster to be German law and the Free City of Danzig was officially incorporated into Germany.

The Polish military forces in the city held out until 7 September.

Up to 4,500 members of the Polish minority were arrested with many of them executed. In the city itself hundreds of Polish prisoners were subjected to cruel executions and experiments, which included castration of men and sterilization of women considered dangerous to the &quot;purity of Nordic race&quot; and beheading by guillotine. The judicial system was one of the main tools of extermination policy towards Poles led by Nazi Germany in the city and verdicts were motivated by statements that Poles were subhuman.
By the end of the Second World War, nearly all of the city had been reduced to ruins. On 30 March 1945, the city was taken by the Red Army.

At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, the Allies agreed that the city would become part of Poland. No formal treaty has ever altered the status of the Free City of Danzig, and its incorporation into Poland has rested upon the general acquiescence of the international community. Subsequently, several groups proclaimed they represented the Free City of Danzig Government in Exile, a continuation of the state.

The expulsion of the pre-war inhabitants started already before the decisions of the Potsdam conference of August 1945. From June to October an estimated number of 60,000 residents were expelled by Polish authorities, often units of the Polish Armed Forces, the Polish State Security and the Milicja Obywatelska encircled certain areas and forced the inhabitants to make room for newly arrived Polish settlers. About 20,000 Germans left on their own and by late 1945 between 10,000 and 15,000 pre-war inhabitants remained.
By 1950, 13,424 citizens of the former Free City had been &quot;verified&quot; and granted Polish citizenship. By 1947, 126,472 Danzigers of German ethnicity were expelled to Germany from Gdańsk, and 101,873 Poles from Central Poland and 26,629 from Soviet-annexed Eastern Poland took their place (these figures refer to the city of Gdańsk itself, not to the whole area of pre-war Free City).

===Origin of the post-war population===
During the Polish post-war census of December 1950, data about the pre-war places of residence of the inhabitants as of August 1939 was collected. In case of children born between September 1939 and December 1950, their origin was reported based on the pre-war places of residence of their mothers. Thanks to this data it is possible to reconstruct the pre-war geographical origin of the post-war population. The same territory which corresponded to pre-war Free City of Danzig was inhabited in December 1950 by:

At least 85% of the population as of December 1950 were post-war newcomers, but over 10% of inhabitants were still pre-war Danzigers (most of them members of pre-war Polish and Kashubian minorities in the Free City of Danzig). Another 25% came from neighbouring areas of pre-war Polish Pomerania. Almost 20% were Poles from areas of former Eastern Poland annexed by the USSR (many from Wilno Voivodeship). Several percent came from the city of Warsaw, which had been largely destroyed in 1944.

==Literary significance and criticism==

John Myers Myers is remembered [largely] for SILVERLOCK, a recursive fantasy that centres on a picaresque voyage by a shipwrecked protagonist through the &#x27;Commonwealth&#x27; (of literature), where he encounters numerous characters and situations from world literature and mythology – the Ass of Apuleius, Beowulf, the Green Knight, Robin Hood, Dante&#x27;s Hell, Friar John from RABELAIS, and many more. The novel is light and pleasant, rather in the manner of Christopher Morley...
:— Grant

Gulliverian fantasy in which a castaway is washed up on the shore of the Commonwealth, where all the great characters of literature are to be found; the hapless hero wanders around, repeatedly getting himself into difficulties and finding famous rescuers, eventually cultivating a kind of heroism. An amusing exercise in literary game playing...
:— Barron
Journeys of self-discovery appear in every genre, teaching us about the main character as well as ourselves. The journey takes many forms: Gilgamesh searching for immortality; Dante&#x27;s trips to Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory; and Wyatt and Billy&#x27;s road trip in Easy Rider, among many others. These voyages speak to human beings&#x27; desire to answer fundamental questions about their place in the world. John Myers Myers takes a novel approach to this genre in Silverlock. His main character learns about himself by participating in the lives of other literary figures.

<text>The black-headed duck (Heteronetta atricapilla) is a South American duck in subfamily Oxyurinae of family Anatidae. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The black-headed duck is the only member of genus &quot;Heteronetta&quot; and has no subspecies. It is closely related to the &quot;stiff-tailed&quot; ducks of genera &quot;Nomonyx&quot;, &quot;Oxyura&quot;, and &quot;Biziura&quot;.

==Description==

The black-headed duck is the most basal living member of its subfamily, and it lacks the stiff tail and swollen bill of its relatives. Overall much resembling a fairly typical diving duck, its plumage and other peculiarities indicate it may not be a very close relative of the other stiff-tailed ducks, but rather the product of convergent evolution from the ancestors of the stiff-tailed ducks.

The black-headed duck is about long. Males weigh an average of about and females . The species has a distinctive shape, with a long body and disproportionately short wings. Its bill has a black maxilla and an orange mandible; the maxilla has a rosy patch at its base during the breeding season. Adult males have a glossy black head and upper neck and a white chin. Their upperparts are deep brownish black with cinnamon or pale rufous speckles and vermiculation. The folded wing shows two white bars. Their underparts are whitish with brown mottling and appear silvery. Adult females have a dark brown head and neck and a whitish throat, and are otherwise like the male. Immature birds are similar to the female but have more rufous upperparts, more yellowish underparts, and a pale eye stripe.
==Distribution and habitat==

The black-headed duck has two separate ranges. One is the western side of central Chile. The other is from extreme southern Bolivia south through central Paraguay to central Argentina and east through southern Uruguay into southernmost Brazil. Undocumented sight records in the Falkland Islands lead the South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society to treat it as hypothetical there. It mostly inhabits freshwater marshes whose dominant plant is the sedge &quot;Scirpus californicus&quot;, and outside the breeding season may be found in lakes, water-filled ditches, and sometimes flooded fields.

==Behavior==
===Movement===

The black-headed duck is partially migratory. It is a year-round resident in most of its range but is found in most of Paraguay and its small Bolivian range only in the non-breeding season.

===Feeding===

The black-headed duck feeds by diving. Though little information is available about its diet, a major component appears to be seeds of &quot;Scirpus californicus&quot;, and snails a minor component.

===Breeding===

The black-headed duck is unique among waterfowl; it is an obligate brood parasite. The female does not build a nest but lays its eggs in the nests of other birds. Known hosts include the rosy-billed pochard (&quot;Netta peposaca&quot;), the red-fronted coot (&quot;Fulica rufifrons&quot;), and the red-gartered coot (&quot;F. armillata&quot;). At least 18 other species have been reported as hosts, including several other waterfowl and rail/coot species, the brown-hooded gull (&quot;Chroicocephalus maculipennis&quot;), and a few raptors. Unlike some cuckoos, neither the chicks nor adults destroy the eggs or kill the chicks of the host. In contrast with brood parasitic passerines, whose young are altricial, black-headed duck ducklings are precocial. After an incubation of about 25 days, the ducklings are completely independent a few hours after hatching and leave the nest.

===Vocalization===

The black-headed duck is usually silent. It does give a low &quot;quah quah&quot; as part of a courtship display, and also &quot;a two note grunt followed by a whistle: – &quot;gr-rump-freet&quot;.&quot; Females make &quot;clucking notes.&quot;

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the black-headed duck as being of Least Concern. It has a large range, and though its population size is not known it is believed to be stable. No immediate threats have been identified. It may be &quot;impacted by changes in available habitat.&quot;

<doc id="471244" wikidata="Q1915120" url="?curid=471244" title="Ronald McDonald House Charities">
<text>Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC) is an independent American nonprofit organization whose stated mission is to create, find, and support programs that directly improve the health and well-being of children.

RMHC has a global network of chapters in 62 countries and regions under three core programs: Ronald McDonald House, Ronald McDonald Family Room and Ronald McDonald Care Mobile.

==Programs==
The first Ronald McDonald House was opened in Philadelphia in 1974. Jim Murray, general manager of the Philadelphia Eagles, was raising funds for one of his players&#x27; (Fred Hill) daughters when he met Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia oncologist Dr. Audrey Evans. They partnered with Elkman Advertising which handled marketing for McDonald&#x27;s, and the charity took the name of the latter&#x27;s mascot.

=== Houses ===
There are over 380 Ronald McDonald Houses in 64 countries. These accommodate families with hospitalized children under 21 years of age (or 18 or 26, depending on the House), who are being treated at nearby hospitals and medical facilities. These houses are located just minutes away from the special care hospitals that are required to help children get back to full health. Ronald McDonald Houses allow families to stay free of charge. They also provide families with home cooked meals. Houses like these scattered throughout the world allow families to have a home away from home and focus on what is important, their child&#x27;s health.

=== Family Rooms ===
There are currently over 260 Ronald McDonald Family Rooms in 28 countries. These family rooms are inside of hospitals. They allow families to stay right beside their children, but also allow them to take a break and relax during a rather stressful situation. These rooms provide families with a safe space to get a snack, take a nap, or even take a shower. They also provide toys for the children to play with to help get their mind off of the setting they are in.

=== Care Mobiles ===
There are currently 40 Ronald McDonald Care Mobiles in ten countries. These care mobiles travel throughout select regions of the world and provide health care to many families in need. Millions of families worldwide are without basic medical, health, and dental care. Which is part of the reason why these buses are so crucial in the Ronald McDonald House&#x27;s project to provide people across the world with the ability to have access to quality health care.

===International===
In 1981, the first Ronald McDonald House outside the United States opened, in Toronto, Ontario. In 1991, the 150th Ronald McDonald House opened, in Paris, France, although it has closed. On July 25, 2005, the 250th location opened in Caracas, Venezuela, but it has since been closed. The first in-hospital Ronald McDonald House in APMEA (Asia Pacific Middle East and Africa) opened at Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health, Bangkok, Thailand, on June 7, 2011.

==== Australia ====
The first Ronald McDonald House in Australia was opened in Camperdown, New South Wales, in 1981. The number of Houses has since grown to 18. The program has since helped 100,000 families and houses up to 260 families per night. Each House is attached to a major children&#x27;s or women&#x27;s hospital. Each House has an independent board that manages its own day-to-day funding.

The Ronald McDonald&#x27;s Learning Program (Australia only) was formed in 1997 to help children who had suffered minor illness and returned to school. Its stated mission is to provide &quot;educational support&quot; to these children who have fallen behind in their education. It is the only program of its kind in Australia. The program now works with over 1,000 students each week. It was first piloted in 1997 by Tracey Webster.

The Ronald McDonald&#x27;s Learning Program supplies students with a cognitive and educational assessment by an educational psychologist, 40 hours of individual tutoring by a qualified teacher and 10 sessions of speech or occupational therapy, if required.

Other RMHC Australia activities include Family Rooms in 14 hospitals. They are located at Canberra Hospital, Garran, ACT; Gosford Hospital, Gosford, New South Wales; John Hunter Hospital, New Lambton Heights, New South Wales; Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, New South Wales; Sydney Children&#x27;s Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales; Nepean Hospital, Kingswood, New South Wales; Gold Coast Hospital Children&#x27;s Ward, Southport, Queensland; Gold Coast Hospital NICU, Southport, Queensland; Monash Medical Centre, Clayton, Victoria; Sunshine Hospital, St Albans, Victoria; The Northern Hospital, Epping, Victoria; Wodonga Hospital, Wodonga, Victoria; Peel Health Campus, Mandurah, Western Australia; and Perth Children&#x27;s Hospital, Nedlands, Western Australia.

RMHC Australia also operates Family Retreats that enable families of sick children to take a holiday for a week. The retreats are located in Ocean Grove, Victoria; Jurien Bay and Bunbury, Western Australia; Forster, New South Wales; and Palm Cove in Northern Queensland.

The Charlie Bell Scholarship Program is named after the first Australian Global McDonald&#x27;s Corporation CEO. The program provides financial assistance in the form of 11 one-off scholarships a year. It assists with expenses related to vocational or tertiary education for children who have been seriously ill.

The Ronald McDonald Care Mobile is a partnership between RMHC Australia and Royal Far West. It is based in Orange in regional New South Wales and travels throughout rural and remote New South Wales.

Ronald McDonald House Charity Australia is also the major private donor to cord blood banks in Australia, providing a 10-year $A1 million commitment.

==== Hong Kong ====
The first Ronald McDonald House in Hong Kong was opened in 1996 in Sha Tin.

The second House plans to establish in Kwun Tong District which is close proximity to the Hong Kong Children&#x27;s Hospital.

==== Norway ====
On May 21, 2016, Ronald McDonald Barnefond (Ronald McDonald Children&#x27;s Fund), along with Stine Sofies Stiftelse, opened the world&#x27;s first camp and learning center for children. Stine Sofie Stiftelse first joined forces with Ronald McDonald Barnefond in 2015. The initial purpose was to fix houses where children of abuse and their families could stay for a day free of charge.

===Pop Tab Program===
Through the RMHC Pop Tab Collection Program, to date more than $4 million has been generated. The program was established to allow individuals and businesses to collect soda pop tabs from aluminum cans and donate them to their local RMHC chapter or Ronald McDonald&#x27;s House. Though each program differs, for the most part, RMHC chapters use the money received from recycling the tabs to help offset operational expenses or to sponsor or support programs. Not all Houses participate in the Pop Tab Program. Collected pop tabs are used by Ronald McDonald House Charities to fund their work.

The Alpha Delta Pi sorority partners with Ronald McDonald House Charities to promote and participate in the Pop Tab Program.

== Partnership with McDonalds ==
The Ronald McDonald House has a program to help support the house through the donation of money from each happy meal purchased at McDonalds. With the purchase of each happy meal two cents is donated to the charity. In 2021 more than $168 million was donated to the Ronald McDonald House through the donations from McDonalds.

==Awards==
&quot;Worth&quot; magazine named Ronald McDonald&#x27;s House Charity one of &quot;America&#x27;s 100 Best Charities&quot; in 2001 and 2002.

The U.S. Green Building Council awarded the Ronald McDonald&#x27;s House Charities of Austin and Central Texas (RMHC-ACT) with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum certification, the highest level of sustainable building in the nation.

==Criticism==
Ronald McDonald House has been criticised as an attempt by McDonald&#x27;s to distract from its role in contributing to childhood obesity and animal welfare issues. Anne Markwardt of Foodwatch, which researches food industry practices, said that &quot;One has to remember that a large amount of the funding does not come from McDonald&#x27;s itself but from private, corporate or other donors.&quot; In 2013 it was estimated by Corporate Accountability International that McDonald&#x27;s contributed about 5% of the funding and about 30% came from McDonald&#x27;s customers&#x27; donations. Markwardt said that the houses are &quot;used as marketing ploys for profitable but unhealthy products, as well as means of indirect political influence,&quot; noting that politicians regularly visited for photo opportunities.

<text>Cryptographie indéchiffrable (subtitle: &quot;basée sur de nouvelles combinaisons rationelles&quot;) is a French book on cryptography written by Émile Victor Théodore Myszkowski (a retired French colonel) and published in 1902.

His book described a cipher that the author had invented and claimed (incorrectly) was &quot;undecipherable&quot; (i.e. secure against unauthorised attempts to read it). It was based on a form of repeated-key transposition.

<text>Michael Vincenzo Gazzo (April 5, 1923 – February 14, 1995) was an American playwright who later in life became a movie and television actor. He was nominated for an Academy Award for his role in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974).

==Biography==
Gazzo was born on April 5, 1923. He was of Italian ancestry. Gazzo served with the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. He was a member of the Actors Studio and later trained actors such as Debra Winger, Henry Silva and Tony Sirico. He wrote &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot;, a Broadway play about drug addiction, which ran for 389 performances in 1955 and 1956. It featured Ben Gazzara and Shelley Winters in the two main roles, and was adapted into a movie of the same name by Oscar-winning director Fred Zinnemann in 1957. The movie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Anthony Franciosa). A 1968 made-for-television version (as a filmed play) featured Peter Falk, Sandy Dennis and Michael Parks. Gazzo&#x27;s other screen writing credits include the Elvis Presley American musical drama movie &quot;King Creole&quot; in 1958. Gazzo authored the Broadway play &quot;The Night Circus&quot;, also featuring Ben Gazzara.

Gazzo was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Frank Pentangeli in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; but lost to Robert De Niro who played Vito Corleone in the same movie.

===Death===
Gazzo died on February 14, 1995, at age 71 due to complications from a stroke. He was buried in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

<doc id="471248" wikidata="Q214300" url="?curid=471248" title="Aythya">
<text>Aythya is a genus of diving ducks, with twelve species currently accepted. The genus was described in 1822 by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie, with the type species being greater scaup. The name &quot;Aythya&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek word (), which referred to an unknown diving-bird.
The species are plump, compact, medium-sized ducks ranging from 37–61 cm long, 60–84 cm wingspan, and weighing 410–1600 g, with canvasback the largest, and ring-necked duck and ferruginous duck marginally the smallest. The body plumage is variably white, grey, red-brown, or black, often with a finely vermiculated pattern; in several species, the flanks are white or pale grey, the back darker grey to black, and the breast and tail black. The heads are strongly coloured in the males, orange-red in some species, and black with a green to purple sheen (structural colour) in good light; the sheen colour varies with both species and angle of light incidence – in for example greater scaup, the head has a green sheen in direct light, but a purple sheen when backlit. In females, the heads are browner, sometimes with white patterning on the face. The eye colour is also variable in males, from white in ferruginous duck (leading to its archaic name of &quot;white-eyed pochard&quot;), through yellow in most species, to deep red in common pochard and canvasback; in females, the eye is brown in all species. The bills are short, fairly broad, and pale blue-grey to black, usually with a small black &#x27;nail&#x27; at the tip; the pattern of blue-grey and black is important in species identification. In flight, the wings are dark grey to black, with a white to pale grey wingbar along the primary and secondary feathers; the pattern of the wingbar (whether all-white, or all-grey, or white on the secondaries and grey on the primaries) is an important identification feature. The webbed feet, used for propulsion in both swimming and diving, are 5–7 cm long, large for the size of the birds, and dark grey to blackish in all the species.

The species occur throughout Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, and Madagascar, and also in the northern half of Africa primarily in winter. Small numbers also reach the far north of South America in winter. In the breeding season, they are restricted to well-vegetated freshwater lakes, while in the winter they use both freshwater lakes and sheltered saltwater bays and inlets.

==&quot;Aythya&quot; species==
The genus contains 12 species; all are monotypic except for &quot;A. marila&quot;, which has two subspecies in the Old and New Worlds, respectively.
==Hybrids==

The species in the genus are all closely related, and are more prone to hybridisation than most other bird genera. Hybrids regularly seen in Europe include tufted duck × common pochard, tufted duck × ring-necked duck, greater scaup × tufted duck, and common pochard × ferruginous duck; while in North America, ring-necked duck × greater scaup, greater scaup × tufted duck, and canvasback × redhead are frequent. These hybrids can often resemble, and be mistaken for, other species in the genus; for example tufted duck × common pochard hybrids are easily mistaken for lesser scaup. Usually only male hybrids are evident; female hybrids are less obvious and even more difficult to identify.

==Diet==
The diet, mostly obtained by diving to depths of 0.5–6 m (exceptionally 10 m), but also at times from the surface without diving, consists of a mixture of plant material (including seeds, leaves and roots of water plants) and bottom-dwelling invertebrates (including worms, molluscs, insects). In urban situations, several species have learnt to take bread or birdseed fed to ducks by people.

==Breeding==
The nests are hidden in dense waterside vegetation, for preference on islets which give greater security from land predators. Incubation of the [2–]6–10[–18] eggs takes 3–4 weeks, and is done entirely by the female. The ducklings fledge at around 6–7 weeks old, and are cared for primarily by the female, though the male may assist with guarding the ducklings. &#x27;Dump nesting&#x27;, where more than one female lays eggs in a nest, is common, and likely accounts for nests containing more than ten eggs.

==Prehistory==
&quot;Aythya shihuibas&quot; was described from the Late Miocene of China. Zelenkov (2016) transferred the species &quot;Anas denesi&quot; Kessler (2013), known from the late Miocene of Hungary, to the genus &quot;Aythya&quot;. An undescribed prehistoric species is known only from Early Pleistocene fossil remains found at Dursunlu, Turkey; it might however be referrable to a paleosubspecies of an extant species considering its age (see also Greater scaup). Subfossils have also been found on Réunion; this Réunion pochard awaits formal description, and may prove to have been a population of the Madagascar pochard.

The Miocene &quot;&quot;Aythya&quot; arvernensis&quot; is now placed in &quot;Mionetta&quot;, while &quot;&quot;Aythya&quot; chauvirae&quot; seems to contain the remains of two species, at least one of which does not seem to be a diving duck.

<doc id="471252" wikidata="Q255255" url="?curid=471252" title="A Nice Pair">
<text>A Nice Pair is a compilation album by Pink Floyd, re-issuing their first two albums, &quot; The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; and &quot; A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; in a new gatefold sleeve. The album was released in December 1973 by Harvest and Capitol in the United States and the following month in the United Kingdom by Harvest and EMI. It reached number 36 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in March 1994.

==Release history and track variations==
There are a few differences between the US and UK issues of the first LP of this compilation. In the US, Harvest Records and its distributor Capitol Records reconstructed their edition from tapes used for the US pressing of the band&#x27;s 1967 debut album (Simply titled &quot;Pink Floyd&quot;) mixed with other recordings from the UK version. As explained in a note on the back cover of the US edition, songs dropped from the original US LP, &quot;Flaming&quot;, &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; and &quot;Bike&quot; were restored for this re-issue. However, some of these restored songs are different from the UK version: The eight-minute live recording of &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; from &quot;Ummagumma&quot; replaces the original four-minute studio recording. &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; fades out slightly early (as it did on the original US LP) and adds a few seconds of silence before &quot;The Gnome&quot; rather than the immediate segue found on the UK version. &quot;Flaming&quot; is an alternate mix and edit which previously appeared as a US single, and the only track to appear on this album in mono. In later pressings, the correct stereo version of &quot;Flaming&quot; was restored. The US version of this album was also released in Canada.

==Cover art==
The cover is by Hipgnosis, who designed many other Pink Floyd covers, and consists of four grids of nine small images, including some proposed but previously unused album cover designs. Several images depict a well-known phrase or saying in the form of a visual pun; for instance, the centre right-hand panel on the front depicts &quot;a fork in the road&quot;, while the bottom right represents &quot;a fine kettle of fish&quot;. Another picture presents two puns on the album title: a nice pear, and an image of a woman&#x27;s pair of breasts; the latter is censored with a black bar on some copies, while other US copies opted to cover it with a purple and white sticker over the shrink wrap. Initial copies had a picture of a Mr. W.R. Phang&#x27;s dental surgery on the cover (a genuine business photographed in Hammersmith, west London), but Dr. Phang objected because NHS dentists were not permitted to advertise, and the picture was replaced with one of a gargling monk. US editions from the 1980s restored both the nudity and the W.R. Phang photo. Other photos illustrate &quot;laughing all the way to the bank&quot;, and &quot;nip in the air&quot;, through the use of a levitating Japanese person. The selection of band photos on the inside cover also varies, with some copies including a photo of a shirtless, disturbed-looking Syd Barrett from &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; cover photo session, while others replace it with a photo of a smiling Barrett sitting by a car.

The album was the band&#x27;s next US release after &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, and introduced new fans to the earlier psychedelic sound of the Syd Barrett period of Pink Floyd, which contrasted greatly to the style of their more recent work. Following the worldwide re-issue of the original two albums on CD, including the original UK version of &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, &quot;A Nice Pair&quot; is now out of print.

==Track listing==
All songs by Syd Barrett, except where noted.

===&quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;===
;Side 1

;Side 2
===&quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;===
;Side 1

;Side 2

Cassette versions in the UK feature &quot;Piper&quot; on side one and &quot;Saucerful&quot; on side two. For the US versions, &quot;Bike&quot; was moved to the beginning of side two, due to the longer running length of &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; on this version.

===United States release===

The US 8-track version alters the running order more radically.

<doc id="471253" wikidata="Q3229162" url="?curid=471253" title="Leigh Steinberg">
<text>Leigh William Steinberg (born March 27, 1949) is an American sports agent, philanthropist, and author. During his 50-year career, Steinberg has represented over 300 professional athletes in football, baseball, basketball, boxing, and Olympic sports. He has represented the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft a record eight times. Steinberg is often credited as the real-life inspiration for the sports agent in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s film &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; in 1996.

==Background==
Steinberg was born and raised in Los Angeles by his parents, a teacher and a librarian, who pushed public service along with ambition. He attended Hamilton High School. He attended the University of California Los Angeles, for one year (1966–67) before transferring to the University of California, Berkeley. He also was a resident assistant at the UC Berkeley dorms and had Steve Bartkowski and Steve Wozniak on his floor. Steinberg eventually formed his own student government political party, called Unity. His moderate politics at the protest-prone Berkeley at the height of the Vietnam War drew such a following that he was elected President of the Associated Students of the University of California, the university&#x27;s student government. He subsequently resigned from his post as a result of a cheating scandal. He earned a B.A. in political science in 1970 and a J.D. in 1973 from UC Berkeley.

==Business==
For many years Steinberg and Jeff Moorad had a sports agency partnership called &quot;Steinberg, Moorad &amp; Dunn&quot;, or &quot;SMD&quot;. They sold that firm in October 1999 to Assante Sports Management Group, a Canadian financial-management firm, for a reported $120 million. Assante acquired several other sports agencies. In February 2002, David Dunn left SMD to open Athletes First, taking about 50 NFL players with him and opening offices about a mile from Steinberg&#x27;s in Newport Beach, Calif. Extensive litigation ensued involving Dunn and Assante.

Steinberg has successfully negotiated over $3 billion in contracts for players including Troy Aikman, Steve Young, and Patrick Mahomes. He has represented the No. 1 pick overall in the NFL draft a record eight times, in addition to representing over 60 other first round draft picks in the NFL.

==Philanthropy==
Steinberg has actively been involved with the Human Relations Commission, Children Now, Children&#x27;s Miracle Network, Coro Fellows Program, and the Starlight Foundation. He founded and underwrites the Steinberg Leadership Institute, a nationwide program run by the Anti-Defamation League preparing students to fight racism and inequality throughout the world which has since become the Glass Leadership Institute. He has endowed scholarships at his high school, donated time and resources to organizations such as Special Olympics, Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, and Junior Achievement. He has also endowed a classroom at Boalt Hall at the University of California at Berkeley. Steinberg&#x27;s community activism has drawn praise from the political world. He has received accommodations from Congress, State Senate, State Legislature, The Los Angeles City Council, Orange County Board of Supervisors, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton.

==Entertainment==
Steinberg has received screen credit as a technical consultant on several films, including &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, &quot;Any Given Sunday,&quot; and &quot;For the Love of the Game&quot;. He has also worked as a consultant for the HBO original series &quot;Arli$$&quot; and served as the title sponsor of the annual Newport Beach Film Festival.

Steinberg made an appearance in the film &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, and is credited as the real life inspiration of the sports agents from that film.

He has developed original television and film content for Fox Television, Warner Brothers Studios, ABC Entertainment, and HBO. He has been at the forefront of the Internet revolution, creating and building sports websites, strategically aligning his firm with ESPN&#x27;s Sportzone.com and developing online marketing courseware for professionals and students alike. He has lent his marketing expertise to the video game software business and served as a member of the Board of Directors for two software manufacturers.

==Media appearances and book writing==
Steinberg wrote a best-selling book with Michael D&#x27;Orso, &quot;Winning with Integrity: Getting What You Want Without Selling Your Soul&quot;, published by Three Rivers Press in October 1999. The book provides readers insight on how to improve their life through non-confrontational negotiating. The majority of the proceeds raised on his 1999 book tour were donated to the Junior Achievement Educational Foundation. His book &quot;The Agent: My 40-Year Career Making Deals and Changing the Game&quot; was published in 2014.

Steinberg was a speaker at the independently organized TED Talk hosted by Chapman University. He spoke about &quot;Making an impact in the world through sports&quot;. Steinberg gave key insights into the changes he&#x27;s brought to the world through sports; one of his strategies was to encourage his clients to give back to the high school community that helped shape them. Steinberg made it a practice not to take any clients who weren&#x27;t interested in contributing.

==Other==
In 1992, Steinberg helped lead a successful campaign to prevent the San Francisco Giants baseball club from relocating to Florida. For his efforts, then San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan honored him by declaring &quot;Leigh Steinberg Day&quot; in the city of San Francisco soon after.

In 1994, then Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris utilized Steinberg as a consultant in his successful bid to prevent the Oakland Athletics baseball club from relocating to Sacramento or San Jose.

Steinberg also served as co-chairperson of the &quot;Save the Rams&quot; committee in its unsuccessful 1990s attempt to keep the franchise from leaving Southern California and was active in pursuits to attract a new football franchise to locate in Los Angeles.

==Personal life==
He lives in Southern California and has three children.

===Bankruptcy===
Steinberg describes his financial problems as having mounted since 2003, when he became involved with extensive litigation with Dunn and Assante (see above), escalating with his 2008 divorce settlement, and also exacerbated by problems with alcoholism. Steinberg was arrested for DUI in 1997 and again in 2007, and for public intoxication in 2008, all in Newport Beach, California. In December 2011, it was reported that a bench warrant had been issued against Steinberg after he failed to appear at a scheduled hearing, concerning an unpaid judgement of $1.4 million, by far the largest of several debts he owes; in fact the bench warrant was authorized by a judge but never issued. On January 11, 2012 Steinberg filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. In 2012 a party thrown by friends celebrated 2 years of sober living for Steinberg. Steinberg celebrated a decade of sobriety in 2020.

The Baronetcy, of Sandlebridge in the County Palatine of Chester, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 10 May 1853 for the first Viscount&#x27;s father, the prominent physician and travel writer Henry Holland.

<doc id="471274" wikidata="Q49640" url="?curid=471274" title="Cabin boy">
<text>A cabin boy or ship&#x27;s boy is a boy (in the sense of low-ranking young male employee, not always a minor in the juridical sense) who waits on the officers and passengers of a ship, especially running errands for the captain. The modern merchant navy successor to the cabin boy is the steward&#x27;s assistant.

==Duties==
Cabin boys were usually 13–16 years old, but sometimes as young as 8, and also helped the cook in the ship&#x27;s kitchen and carried buckets of food from the ship&#x27;s kitchen to the forecastle where the ordinary seamen ate. They would have to scramble up the rigging into the yards whenever the sails had to be trimmed. They would occasionally stand watch like other crewmen or act as helmsman in good weather, holding the wheel to keep the ship steady on her course. They could be found on pirate ships sometimes.

==Royal Navy officers==
Several prominent British Royal Navy officers began their career as cabin boys. The list includes officers that achieved an admiralty rank before 1801. 
* Admiral of the Fleet Sir William Parker, 1st Baronet of Shenstone
* Admiral of the Fleet Sir Cloudsley Shovell
* Admiral Sir Francis Drake
* Admiral Sir John Hawkins
* Admiral (General) Richard Deane
* Admiral (Colonel) William Rainsborough
* Admiral Sir William Penn
* Vice Admiral Lord Nelson
* Vice Admiral Sir William Batten
* Vice Admiral Sir John Lawson
* Vice Admiral (Captain) Badilow
* Vice Admiral Sir Thomas Tiddeman
* Vice Admiral (Captain) James Peacock
* Vice Admiral (Captain) William Goodsonn
* Vice Admiral Sir Christopher Myngs
* Vice Admiral Sir John Harman
* Rear Admiral Sir John Berry
* Rear Admiral Sir Richard Stainer
* Rear Admiral (Captain) Anthony Houlding
* Rear Admiral (Captain) Deacons
* Rear Admiral (Captain) Robert Sansum

<text>The Earth Observing System (EOS) is a program of NASA comprising a series of artificial satellite missions and scientific instruments in Earth orbit designed for long-term global observations of the land surface, biosphere, atmosphere, and oceans. Since the early 1970s, NASA has been developing its Earth Observing System, launching a series of Landsat satellites in the decade. Some of the first included passive microwave imaging in 1972 through the Nimbus 5 satellite. Following the launch of various satellite missions, the conception of the program began in the late 1980s and expanded rapidly through the 1990s. Since the inception of the program, it has continued to develop, including; land, sea, radiation and atmosphere. Collected in a system known as EOSDIS, NASA uses this data in order to study the progression and changes in the biosphere of Earth. The main focus of this data collection surrounds climatic science. The program is the centrepiece of NASA&#x27;s Earth Science Enterprise.

== History and development ==

Prior to the development of the current Earth Observing System (EOS), the foundations for this program were laid in the early 1960s and 1970s. TIROS-1, the very first full-scale, low Earth orbit weather satellite. The primary objective of TIROS-1 was to explore television infrared observation as a method of monitoring and studying the surface of Earth. Critical to the development of the satellites currently in use, TIROS-1 was a program that allowed NASA to use experimental instruments and data collection methods to study meteorology worldwide. Crucially, this new information gathered by TIROS-1 would allow meteorologists and scientists to observe large-scale weather events. In doing so, they would be able to answer questions such as  &quot;should we evacuate the coast because of the hurricane?&quot;. Following TIROS, the experimental Applications Technology Satellite (ATS) program was developed. The main objective of these satellites were weather predictions and the study of the environment of space. Significantly, this program focused on launching satellites to orbit geosynchronously and evaluate the effectiveness of this orbit pattern in observing the Earth. ATS-3, the longest-lasting mission, saw a life span of over 20 years. It was the first satellite to capture colour images from space and acted significantly as a medium of communications.

After the success of TIROS-1 and ATS-3, NASA in conjunction with United States Geological Survey (USGS), progressed forward in Earth observation through a series of Landsat satellites launched throughout the 1970s and 1980s. The Nimbus 5 satellite launched in 1972 used passive microwave imaging; a highly successful method to observe changes in sea ice cover.  Observation was furthered by succeeding missions such as Nimbus 7, fitted with a coastal zone colour scanner (CZCS) for detailing colour changes in the Earth&#x27;s oceans, and a Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) to measure solar irradiance and the reflected radiance from the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The early satellites of these programs have paved the way for much of the EOS program today. The TIROS satellites were extremely important in the testing and development of not only the Earth observing instruments such as spectrometers, but much was also learnt from the various sensors used in order to maintain these satellites in orbit for sustainable periods of time. Sensors such as horizons sensors were tested on these early satellites and have been adapted to produce more advanced methods of observation and operating configurations.

== Operation and technology - Logistics ==
== Data collection and uses ==
Since the inception of the program, the aim overall has remained the same: &quot;monitor and understand key components of the climate system and their interactions through long-term global observations.&quot; Through the use of various programs such as LandSat and the A-Train programs, scientists are gaining a greater understanding of Earth and its changes. Currently, the data collected by the satellites in EOS is digitised and collated by the Earth Observing System Data and Information System. Scientists then use this data to predict weather events, and more recently to predict the effects of climate change for treaties such as Paris Climate agreements, with data mainly being collected by EOS and then analysed.

== Intergovernmental agencies and partnerships ==
In a broader sense of Earth observing and all missions that impact EOS, there have been a variety of intergovernmental partnerships and international partnerships that have helped fund, research and develop the complex array of satellites and spacecraft that make the Earth Observing System successful in its role. In total, intergovernmental partnerships account for almost 37% of all missions while 27% of the missions also involve international partnerships with other countries and international companies.

As of 2022, there have been nine LandSat satellites with LandSat 7, 8, and 9 orbiting the Earth. The LandSat program has involved many organisations since its inception, particularly the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Other intergovernmental agencies that have been a part of the Earth Observing program include the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA), US Department of Defence (USDOD), United States Department of Energy (USDOE) and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These intergovernmental agencies cooperating allow for greater funding for the program along with collaboration of government resources from various agencies. Often these partnerships begin with another governmental agency wanting a specific instrument as a part of a payload included on a mission.

Similarly, international partnerships with countries have either resulted from a specific payload (instrument) accompanying an existing mission that NASA has developed or NASA collaborating and requiring the use of facilities of another Space agency such as the European Space Agency. A partnership like this was observed in 2000 when the ERS-1 satellite was launched from the Guiana Space Centre; a spaceport in French Guiana, South America. International agencies that have assisted or collaborated with NASA include CONAE (Argentinian Space Agency), CNES (French Space Agency), DLR (German Aerospace Centre), the state space federation Roscosmos of the Russian Federation, and JAXA (Japanese Space Agency; previously NASDA).

Over the program&#x27;s life, there have also been various corporate and organisational partnerships with companies both based in America and internationally. In 2002, the SeaWIFS missions saw a collaboration with GEOeye, an American satellite imaging company. Similarly, organisations such as the International Council for Science (ICSU), International standards Organisation (IOS), World Data System (WDS) and the committee on Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS) have been involved in the planning, data collection, and data analysis of missions. As mentioned, funding, instrumental additions and over assistance in coordination and data analysis are all benefits of these partnerships.

== Future missions ==
=== Sentinel 6B ===
As the Earth Observing System becomes more crucial in studying the Earth&#x27;s climate and changes, the program will continue to evolve. NASA along with other government agencies such as the European Space Agency and NASDA (Japan), have planned many future missions. Sentinel 6B is one such mission with the aim of continued water and ocean observations. A key objective of the sentinel missions is to monitor sea level rise, a primary indicator of climate change and global warming. As Paris Agreement policy and more countries aim for a carbon neutral world, the data collected by Sentinel missions will assist in the continued understanding of the Earth&#x27;s changing climate. It is also expected that one of the sentinel satellites will test a new experiment with regards to weather prediction. As a part of its payload, it will use Global Navigation Satellite System Radio Occultation (GNSS-RO), a method to detail changes and information of different layers in the atmosphere.

=== JPSS-3 and 4 ===
JPSS or Joint Polar Satellite systems are expected to launch in 2027. This project will be an  intergovernmental collaboration between NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and will observe a new generation of Polar Orbiting environmental satellites. Crucially, these polar orbiting satellites are non-geosynchronous meaning these two satellites will have an inclination angle of close to 90 degrees to the equator. Crucially this project is continuing and is the third and fourth satellite in the JPSS series. The payload for this type of satellite will include Visible Infrared imaging Radiometer, Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder and Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite. The data collected by these variety of instruments will included numerical weather prediction to be used for modelling and forecast prediction.

=== EVM-3 INCUS ===

A branch of the Earth Venture Missions, the Investigation of Convective Updrafts missions is planned to have three small satellites. The three satellites will orbit in tight coordination and will have the aim of understanding the formation of convective storms and heavy precipitation. It aims to know not only how, but know exactly where and when they will form. Although still in planning and development stages, the first of the three satellites in EVM-3 in 2027. After deliberation between 12 proposals of EVM in 2021, the INCUS mission was selected after a review by panellists. NASA&#x27;s Earth Science Director Karen St. Germain stated, &quot;In a changing climate, more accurate information about how storms develop and intensify can help improve weather models and our ability to predict risk of extreme weather.&quot; As the effects of climate change are ever more increasing with increasing sea level temperatures globally, it is predicted that storms will have a greater intensity and occur more often. This is a result of increased water vapour moving upwards creating the convection currents. INCUS will help scientist understand these currents and help predict the likelihood and location of major storms when fully operational.

<doc id="471283" wikidata="Q4947841" url="?curid=471283" title="Boston College Law School">
<text>Boston College Law School (BC Law) is the law school of Boston College, a private Jesuit research university in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. It is situated on a campus in Newton, Massachusetts, about from the university&#x27;s main campus in Chestnut Hill.

The law school has approximately 800 students and 60 full-time faculty members. BC Law has programs in human rights, social justice, and public interest law, as well as programs in business law and innovation, law and public policy, and criminal and civil litigation.

== History ==
Although provisions for a law school were included in Boston College&#x27;s original charter, ratified by the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1863, Boston College Law School was formally organized later in 1929. Previously, promising Boston College graduates interested in a legal education were encouraged to seek admission to Harvard Law School, as attested by the law school&#x27;s inaugural faculty of whom 11 out of 17 members held degrees from both universities. BC Law&#x27;s founder, John B. Creeden , formerly president of Georgetown University, served as its first regent and alumnus Dennis A. Dooley as its first dean.

On September 26, 1929, BC Law opened its doors in the 11-story Lawyer&#x27;s Building on Beacon Street opposite the Massachusetts State House in downtown Boston. From a pool of nearly 700 applicants, 102 day and evening division students had been selected. So rigorous were the school&#x27;s academic standards that 50% of the first class eventually dropped out or flunked out. However, just three years later, the school received American Bar Association accreditation, joining Harvard, Yale, and Boston University as the only law schools in New England to attain that distinction; accreditation by the Association of American Law Schools followed in 1937.

Women were admitted to the school by 1940, when enrollment had surpassed 350 students. In 1954, the school moved to St. Thomas More Hall on the edge of the main Chestnut Hill campus and to its present Newton campus, the home of the former Newton College of the Sacred Heart, in 1975. Today, the law campus includes Stuart House, an administrative building; lecture halls; seminar spaces; a dining hall; conference space; and a law library that includes the Daniel R. Coquillette Rare Book Room.

==Academics==
===Admissions===

It was created on 11 June 1952 for the Scottish Liberal politician and former Secretary of State for Air, Sir Archibald Sinclair, 4th Baronet. His son, the second Viscount, served as Lord Lieutenant of Caithness from 1973 to 1995.

 the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s son, the third Viscount, who succeeded in 1995. Known as John Thurso, he is a Liberal Democrat politician.

The language emerged from contact between French settlers and enslaved Africans during the Atlantic slave trade in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) in the 17th and 18th centuries. Although its vocabulary largely derives from 18th-century French, its grammar is that of a West African Volta-Congo language branch, particularly the Fongbe and Igbo languages. It also has influences from Spanish, English, Portuguese, Taíno, and other West African languages. It is not mutually intelligible with standard French, and it also has its own distinctive grammar. Some estimate that Haitians are the largest community in the world to speak a modern creole language, others estimate that more people speak Nigerian Pidgin.

Haitian Creole&#x27;s use in communities and schools has been contentious since at least the 19thcentury. Some Haitians view French as inextricably linked to the legacy of colonialism and language compelled on the population by conquerors, while Creole has been maligned by francophones as a miseducated person&#x27;s French. Until the late 20thcentury, Haitian presidents spoke only standard French to their fellow citizens, and until the 21st century, all instruction at Haitian elementary schools was in modern standard French, a second language to most of their students.

Haitian Creole is also spoken in regions that have received migration from Haiti, including other Caribbean islands, French Guiana, Martinique, France, Canada (particularly Quebec) and the United States (including the U.S. state of Louisiana). It is related to Antillean Creole, spoken in the Lesser Antilles, and to other French-based creole languages.


==Etymology==
The word &quot;creole&quot; comes from the Portuguese term , which means &quot;a person raised in one&#x27;s house&quot; and from the Latin , which means &quot;to create, make, bring forth, produce, beget&quot;. In the New World, the term originally referred to Europeans born and raised in overseas colonies (as opposed to the European-born &quot;peninsulares&quot;). To be &quot;as rich as a Creole&quot; at one time was a popular saying boasted in Paris during the colonial years of Haiti (then named &quot;Saint-Domingue&quot;), for being the most lucrative colony in the world. The noun &quot;Creole&quot;, soon began to refer to the language spoken there as well, as it still is today.

==Origins==

Haitian Creole contains elements from both the Romance group of Indo-European languages through its superstrate, French, as well as influences from African languages. There are many theories on the formation of the Haitian Creole language.

One theory estimates that Haitian Creole developed between 1680 and 1740. During the 17th century, French and Spanish colonizers produced tobacco, cotton, and sugar cane on the island. Throughout this period, the population was made of roughly equal numbers of (white workers), (free people of colour) and slaves. The economy shifted more decisively into sugar production about 1690, just before the French colony of was officially recognized in 1697. The sugar crops needed a much larger labor force, which led to an increase in slave trafficking . In the 18th century an estimated 800,000 West Africans were enslaved and brought to Saint-Domingue. As the slave population increased, the proportion of French-speaking colonists decreased.

Many African slaves in the colony had come from Niger-Congo-speaking territory, and particularly speakers of Kwa languages, such as Gbe from West Africa and the Central Tano languages, and Bantu languages from Central Africa. Singler suggests that the number of Bantu speakers decreased while the number of Kwa speakers increased, with Gbe being the most dominant group. The first fifty years of &#x27;s sugar boom coincided with emergent Gbe predominance in the French Caribbean. In the interval during which Singler hypothesizes the language evolved, the Gbe population was around 50% of the kidnapped enslaved population.

Classical French () and (Norman, and dialects, Gallo and Picard) were spoken during the 17th and 18th centuries in , as well as in New France and French West Africa. Slaves lacked a common means of communication and as a result would try to learn French to communicate with one another, though most were denied a formal education. With the constant trafficking and enslavement of Africans, the language became increasingly distinct from French. The language was also picked up by other members of the community and became used by the majority of those born in what is now Haiti.

===Saint-Domingue Creole French===

In Saint-Domingue, people of all classes spoke Creole French. There were both lower and higher registers of the language, depending on education and class. Creole served as a lingua franca throughout the West Indies.

===Difference between Haitian Creole and French===
Haitian Creole and French have similar pronunciations and also share many lexical items. However, many cognate terms actually have different meanings. For example, as Valdman mentions in &quot;Haitian Creole: Structure, Variation, Status, Origin&quot;, the word for &quot;frequent&quot; in French is ; however, its cognate in Haitian Creole means &#x27;insolent, rude, and impertinent&#x27; and usually refers to people. In addition, the grammars of Haitian Creole and French are very different. For example, in Haitian Creole, verbs are not conjugated as they are in French. Additionally, Haitian Creole possesses different phonetics from standard French; however, it is similar in phonetic structure. The phrase-structure is another similarity between Haitian Creole and French but differs slightly in that it contains details from its African substratum language.

Both Haitian Creole and French have also experienced semantic change: words that had a single meaning in the have changed or have been replaced in both languages. For example, &quot;&quot; (&quot;What is your name?&quot;) corresponds to the French &quot;&quot;. Although the average French speaker would not understand this phrase, every word in it is in fact of French origin: &quot;who&quot;; &quot;manner&quot;; &quot;you&quot;, and &quot;to call&quot;, but the verb has been replaced by in modern French and reduced to a meaning of &quot;to flag down&quot;.

Lefebvre proposed the theory of relexification, arguing that the process of relexification (the replacement of the phonological representation of a substratum lexical item with the phonological representation of a superstratum lexical item, so that the Haitian creole lexical item looks like French, but works like the substratum language(s)) was central in the development of Haitian Creole.

The Fon language, also known as the Fongbe language, is a modern Gbe language native to Benin, Nigeria and Togo in West Africa. This language has a grammatical structure similar to Haitian Creole, possibly making Creole a relexification of Fon with vocabulary from French. The two languages are often compared:

===Taino influence===
There are a number of Taino influences in Haitian Creole; many objects, fruit and animal names are either &quot;haitianized&quot; or have a similar pronunciation. Many towns, places or sites have their official name being a translation of the Taino word.
==History==
===Early development===
Haitian Creole developed in the 17th and 18th centuries in the colony of Saint-Domingue, in a setting that mixed speakers of various Niger–Congo languages with French colonists. In the early 1940s under President , attempts were made to standardize the language. American linguistic expert Frank Laubach and Irish Methodist missionary H. Ormonde McConnell developed a standardized Haitian Creole orthography. Although some regarded the orthography highly, it was generally not well received. Its orthography was standardized in 1979. That same year Haitian Creole was elevated in status by the Act of 18 September 1979. The established an official orthography for Creole, and slight modifications were made over the next two decades. For example, the is no longer used, nor is the apostrophe. The only accent mark retained is the grave accent in and .

===Becoming an official language===
The Constitution of 1987 upgraded Haitian Creole to a national language alongside French. It classified French as the or &quot;language of instruction&quot;, and Creole was classified as an or a &quot;tool of education&quot;. The Constitution of 1987 names both Haitian Creole and French as the official languages, but recognizes Haitian Creole as the only language that all Haitians hold in common. French is spoken by only a small percentage of citizens.

===Literature development===
Even without government recognition, by the end of the 19th century, there were already literary texts written in Haitian Creole such as &#x27;s and &#x27;s . was another influential author of Haitian Creole work. Since the 1980s, many educators, writers, and activists have written literature in Haitian Creole. In 2001, &quot;Open Gate: An Anthology of Haitian Creole Poetry&quot; was published. It was the first time a collection of Haitian Creole poetry was published in both Haitian Creole and English. On 28 October 2004, the Haitian daily first published an entire edition in Haitian Creole in observance of the country&#x27;s newly instated &quot;Creole Day&quot;. Haitian Creole writers often use different literary strategies throughout their works, such as code-switching, to increase the audience&#x27;s knowledge on the language. Literature in Haitian Creole is also used to educate the public on the dictatorial social and political forces in Haiti.

==Sociolinguistics==

===Role in society===

Although both French and Haitian Creole are official languages in Haiti, French is often considered the high language and Haitian Creole as the low language in the diglossic relationship of these two languages in society. That is to say, for the minority of Haitian population that is bilingual, the use of these two languages largely depends on the social context: standard French is used more in public, especially in formal situations, whereas Haitian Creole is used more on a daily basis and is often heard in ordinary conversation.

There is a large population in Haiti that speaks only Haitian Creole, whether under formal or informal conditions:

===Use in educational system===
In most schools, French is still the preferred language for teaching. Generally speaking, Creole is more used in public schools, as that is where most children of ordinary families who speak Creole attend school.

Historically, the education system has been French-dominant. Except the children of elites, many had to drop out of school because learning French was very challenging to them and they had a hard time to follow up. The Bernard Reform of 1978 tried to introduce Creole as the teaching language in the first four years of primary school; however, the reform overall was not very successful. The use of Creole has grown; after the earthquake in 2010, basic education became free and more accessible to the monolingual masses. In the 2010s, the government has attempted to expand the use of Creole and improve the school system.

==Orthography==

Haitian Creole has a phonemic orthography with highly regular spelling, except for proper nouns and foreign words. According to the official standardized orthography, Haitian Creole is composed of the following 32 symbols: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . The letters and are always associated with another letter (in the multigraphs , , , and ). The Haitian Creole alphabet has no or ; when is used in loanwords and proper nouns, it represents the sounds , , or .
* There are no silent letters in the Haitian Creole orthography.
* All sounds are always spelled the same, except when a vowel carries a grave accent , which makes it an oral vowel instead of a nasal vowel:
** and ;
** and ; and
** and .
* When immediately followed by a vowel in a word, the digraphs denoting the nasal vowels (, , , and sometimes ) are pronounced as an oral vowel followed by .
* There is some ambiguity in the pronunciation of the high vowels of the letters and when followed in spelling by . Common words such as (&quot;person&quot;) and (&quot;car&quot;) end with consonantal , while very few words, mostly adopted from African languages, contain nasalized high vowels, as in .
* The diphthong is extremely rare, and maybe only exists in the common word &quot;uit&quot; (← French &quot;huit&quot;) &quot;eight&quot;. Most other instances of this diphthong have been replaced by , e.g. &quot;fwi&quot; (← &quot;fruit&quot;) &quot;fruit&quot;, &quot;nwit&quot; (← &quot;nuit&quot;) &quot;night&quot;.

===Haitian orthography debate===
The first technical orthography for Haitian Creole was developed in 1940 by H. Ormonde McConnell and Primrose McConnell, Irish Methodist missionaries. It was later revised with the help of Frank Laubach, resulting in the creation of what is known as the McConnell–Laubach orthography.

The McConnell–Laubach orthography received substantial criticism from members of the Haitian elite. Haitian scholar Charles Pressoir critiqued the McConnell–Laubach orthography for its lack of codified front rounded vowels, which are typically used only by francophone elites. Another criticism was of the broad use of the letters , , and , which Pressoir argued looked &quot;too American&quot;. This criticism of the &quot;American look&quot; of the orthography was shared by many educated Haitians, who also criticized its association with Protestantism. The last of Pressoir&#x27;s criticisms was that &quot;the use of the circumflex to mark nasalized vowels&quot; treated nasal sounds differently from the way they are represented in French, which he feared would inhibit the learning of French.

The creation of the orthography was essentially an articulation of the language ideologies of those involved and brought out political and social tensions between competing groups. A large portion of this tension lay in the ideology held by many that the French language is superior, which led to resentment of the language by some Haitians and an admiration for it from others. This orthographical controversy boiled down to an attempt to unify a conception of Haitian national identity. Where and seemed too Anglo-Saxon and American imperialistic, and were symbolic of French colonialism.

===French-based orthography===
When Haiti was still a colony of France, edicts by the French government were often written in a French-lexicon creole and read aloud to the slave population. The first written text of Haitian Creole was composed in the French-lexicon in a poem called &quot;Lisette quitté la plaine&quot; in 1757 by Duvivier de la Mahautière, a white Creole planter.

Before Haitian Creole orthography was standardized in the late 20th century, spelling varied, but was based on subjecting spoken HaitianCreole to written French, a language whose spelling has a complicated relation to pronunciation. Unlike the phonetic orthography, French orthography of HaitianCreole is not standardized and varies according to the writer; some use exact French spelling, others adjust the spelling of certain words to represent pronunciation of the cognate in HaitianCreole, removing the silent letters. For example: ( &quot;He goes to work in the morning&quot;) could be transcribed as:
* , or

==Grammar==
Haitian Creole grammar is highly analytical: for example, verbs are not inflected for tense or person, and there is no grammatical gender, which means that adjectives and articles are not inflected according to the noun. The primary word order is subject–verb–object as it is in French and English.

Many grammatical features, particularly the pluralization of nouns and indication of possession, are indicated by appending certain markers, like , to the main word. There has been a debate going on for some years as to whether these markers are affixes or clitics, and if punctuation such as the hyphen should be used to connect them to the word.

Although the language&#x27;s vocabulary has many words related to their French-language cognates, its sentence structure is like that of the West African Fon language.

===Pronouns===
There are six pronouns: first, second, and third person, each in both singular, and plural; all are of French etymological origin. There is no difference between direct and indirect objects.


===Possessive pronouns===

====Singular====

====Plural====

===Plural of nouns===
Definite nouns are made plural when followed by the word ; indefinite plural nouns are unmarked.

===Possession===
Possession is indicated by placing the possessor or possessive pronoun after the item possessed. In the Capois dialect of northern Haiti, or is placed before the possessive pronoun. Note, however, that this is not considered the standard Kreyòl most often heard in the media or used in writing.

Possession does not indicate definiteness (&quot;my friend&quot; as opposed to &quot;a friend of mine&quot;), and possessive constructions are often followed by a definite article.

===Indefinite article===
The language has two indefinite articles, and (pronounced and ) which correspond to French and . is derived from the French . Both are used only with singular nouns, and are placed before the noun:

===Definite article===
In Haitian Creole, the definite article has five forms, and it is placed after the noun it modifies. The final syllable of the preceding word determines which form the definite article takes. If the last sound is an oral consonant or a glide (spelled &#x27;y&#x27; or &#x27;w&#x27;), and if it is preceded by an oral vowel, the definite article is :

If the last sound is an oral consonant and is preceded by a nasal vowel, the definite article is :

If the last sound is an oral vowel and is preceded by an oral consonant, the definite article is :

If the last sound is any oral vowel other than &quot;i&quot; or &quot;ou&quot; and is preceded by a nasal consonant, then the definite article is also &quot;a:&quot;

If a word ends in , , , , or if it ends with any nasal vowel, then the definite article is &quot;an&quot;:

If the last sound is a nasal consonant, the definite article is , but may also be :

===Demonstratives===
There is a single word that corresponds to English &quot;this&quot; and to &quot;that&quot; (and to French , , , and ). As in English, it may be used as a demonstrative, except that it is placed after the noun that it qualifies. It is often followed by or (in order to mark number): (&quot;this here&quot; or &quot;that there&quot;):

As in English, it may also be used as a pronoun, replacing a noun:

===Verbs===
Many verbs in Haitian Creole are the same spoken words as the French infinitive, but there is no conjugation in the language; the verbs have one form only, and changes in tense, mood, and aspect are indicated by the use of markers:

====Copula====
The concept expressed in English by the verb &quot;tobe&quot; is expressed in Haitian Creole by three words, , , and sometimes .

The verb (pronounced similarly to the English word &quot;say&quot;) is used to link a subject with a predicate nominative:

The subject of a sentence with might not be included. In which case, the sentence is interpreted as if the subject were (&quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot;) or (&quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot; or &quot;it&quot;):

To express &quot;I want to be&quot;, usually (&quot;tobecome&quot;) is used instead of .

 also means &quot;tobe&quot;, but is placed exclusively at the end of a sentence, after the predicate and the subject (in that order):

Haitian Creole has stative verbs, which means that the verb &quot;tobe&quot; is not covert when followed by an adjective. Therefore, means both &quot;sick&quot; and &quot;&quot;:

====To have====
The verb &quot;to have&quot; is , often shortened to .

====There is====
The verb (or ) also means &quot;there is&quot; or &quot;there are&quot;:

====To know====
The Haitian Creole word for &quot;to know&quot; and &quot;to know how&quot; is , which is often shortened to .

====To do====
 means &quot;do&quot; or &quot;make&quot;. It has a broad range of meanings, as it is one of the most common verbs used in idiomatic phrases.

====To be able to====
The verb (or shortened to , or ) means &quot;to be able to (do something)&quot;. It refers to both &quot;capability&quot; and &quot;availability&quot;:

====Tense markers====
There is no conjugation in Haitian Creole. In the present non-progressive tense, one just uses the basic verb form for stative verbs:

When the basic form of action verbs is used without any verb markers, it is generally understood as referring to the past:

 means both &quot;food&quot; and &quot;to eat&quot;, as does in Canadian French; means &quot;I am eating good food&quot;.

For other tenses, special &quot;tense marker&quot; words are placed before the verb. The basic ones are:

Simple past or past perfect:

Past progressive:

Present progressive:

For the present progressive, it is customary, though not necessary, to add (&quot;rightnow&quot;):

Also, can mean &quot;will eat&quot; depending on the context of the sentence:

Near or definite future:

Future:

Other examples:

Recent past markers include and (both mean &quot;just&quot; or &quot;just now&quot; and are often used together):

A verb mood marker is , corresponding to English &quot;would&quot; and equivalent to the French conditional tense:

====Negation====
The word comes before a verb and any tense markers to negate it:

==Lexicon==
Most of the lexicon of Creole is derived from French, with significant changes in pronunciation and morphology; often the French definite article was retained as part of the noun. For example, the French definite article &quot;la&quot; in &quot;la lune&quot; (&quot;the moon&quot;) was incorporated into the Creole noun for moon: . However, the language also inherited many words of different origins, among them Wolof, Fon, Kongo, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Taino and Arabic.

Haitian Creole creates and borrows new words to describe new or old concepts and realities. Examples of this are which was borrowed from English and means &quot;to move backwards&quot; (the original word derived from French is from ), and also from English, &quot;napkin&quot;, which is being used as well as , from the French .

===Sample===

=== and ===
Although and have similar words in French (, a pejorative to refer to black people, and , meaning white, or white person), the meanings they carry in French do not apply in Haitian Creole. means &quot;a person&quot; or &quot;a man&quot; (like &quot;guy&quot; or &quot;dude&quot; in American English). The word generally means &quot;foreigner&quot; or &quot;not from Haiti&quot;. Thus, a non-black Haitian man (usually biracial) could be called , while a black person from the US could be referred to as .

Etymologically, the word is derived from the French and is cognate with the Spanish (&quot;black&quot;, both the color and the people).

There are many other Haitian Creole terms for specific tones of skin including , , , and . Some Haitians consider such labels as offensive because of their association with color discrimination and the Haitian class system, while others use the terms freely.

==Examples==
===Salutations===

==Proverbs and expressions==
Proverbs play a central role in traditional Haitian culture and Haitian Creole speakers make frequent use of them as well as of other metaphors.

===Proverbs===
===Expressions===
==Usage abroad==

===United States and Canada===

Haitian Creole is used widely among Haitians who have relocated to other countries, particularly the United States and Canada. Some of the larger Creole-speaking populations are found in Montreal, Quebec (where French is the official language), New York City, Boston, and Central and South Florida (Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Palm Beach). To reach out to the large Haitian population, government agencies have produced various public service announcements, school-parent communications, and other materials in Haitian Creole. For instance, Miami-Dade County in Florida sends out paper communications in Haitian Creole in addition to English and Spanish. In the Boston area, the Boston subway system and area hospitals and medical offices post announcements in Haitian Creole as well as English. North America&#x27;s only Creole-language television network is HBN, based in Miami. These areas also each have more than half a dozen Creole-language AM radio stations.

Haitian Creole and Haitian culture are taught in many colleges in the United States and the Bahamas. York College at the City University of New York features a minor in Haitian Creole. Indiana University&#x27;s Albert Valdman founded the country&#x27;s first Creole Institute where Haitian Creole, among other facets of Haiti, were studied and researched. The University of Kansas, Lawrence has an Institute of Haitian studies, founded by Bryant Freeman. The University of Massachusetts Boston, Florida International University, and Indiana University Bloomington offer seminars and courses annually at their Haitian Creole Summer Institutes. Brown University, University of Miami, Tulane University, and Duke University also offer Haitian Creole classes, and Columbia University and NYU have jointly offered a course since 2015. The University of Chicago began offering Creole courses in 2010.

, the New York City Department of Education counted 2,838 Haitian Creole-speaking English-language learners (ELLs) in the city&#x27;s K–12 schools, making it the seventh most common home language of ELLs citywide and the fifth most common home language of Brooklyn ELLs. Because of the large population of Haitian Creole-speaking students within NYC schools, various organizations have been established to respond to the needs of these students. For example, Flanbwayan and Gran Chimen Sant Kiltirèl, both located in Brooklyn, New York, aim to promote education and Haitian culture through advocacy, literacy projects, and cultural/artistic endeavors.

===Cuba===
Haitian Creole is the second most spoken language in Cuba after Spanish, where over 300,000 Haitian immigrants speak it. It is recognized as a minority language in Cuba and a considerable number of Cubans speak it fluently. Most of these speakers have never been to Haiti and do not possess Haitian ancestry, but merely learned it in their communities. In addition, there is a Haitian Creole radio station operating in Havana.

===Dominican Republic===

, the language was also spoken by over 450,000 Haitians who reside in the neighboring Dominican Republic, although the locals do not speak it. However, some estimates suggest that there are over a million speakers due to a huge population of undocumented immigrants from Haiti.

===The Bahamas===
As of 2009, up to 80,000 Haitians were estimated residing in the Bahamas, where about 20,000 speak Haitian Creole. It is the third most‑spoken language after English and Bahamian Creole.

==Software==
After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, international aid workers desperately needed translation tools for communicating in Haitian Creole. Furthermore, international organizations had little idea whom to contact as translators. As an emergency measure, Carnegie Mellon University released data for its own research into the public domain. Microsoft Research and Google Translate implemented alpha version machine translators based on the Carnegie Mellon data.

Several smartphone apps have been released, including learning with flashcards by Byki and two medical dictionaries, one by Educa Vision and a second by Ultralingua, the latter of which includes an audio phrase book and a section on cultural anthropology.

<doc id="471299" wikidata="Q4053072" url="?curid=471299" title="What Would Brian Boitano Do?">
<text>&quot;What Would Brian Boitano Do?&quot; is a song from the 1999 film &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot; written by &quot;South Park&quot; co-creator Trey Parker and composer Marc Shaiman. In the song, Olympic and professional figure skater Brian Boitano is treated lyrically as a superhero in a series of increasingly ludicrous situations. The title of the absurdist song is a parody of the evangelical Christian motto &quot;What Would Jesus Do?&quot;

==Background==

Olympic and professional figure skater Brian Boitano is a recurring figure in the animated television series &quot;South Park&quot;, which debuted in 1997. In actuality the use of a fictionalized Boitano&#x27;s character predates the show, with an angel-like Boitano materializing to lend advice in the second &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot; short (&quot;Jesus vs. Santa&quot;) animated film, made by &quot;South Park&quot; creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone in 1995 while still students at the University of Colorado.

In the short, Stan Marsh asks Eric Cartman, &quot;What would Brian Boitano do?&quot; as Jesus battles Santa Claus.

Boitano&#x27;s character also appears in the fourth episode of the first season of the &quot;South Park&quot; television series in the episode &quot;Big Gay Al&#x27;s Big Gay Boat Ride&quot;. In this September 1997 episode of the show the Boitano character appears ice dancing during the gay liberation-themed song &quot;We&#x27;re All Gay and It&#x27;s OK!&quot; The very private Boitano came out publicly as gay only on December 19, 2013, days after being named by President Barack Obama to the American delegation to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

==Song==

The Boitano character was revisited in the 1999 &quot;South Park&quot; musical film, &quot;Bigger, Longer, and Uncut,&quot; with the song &quot;What Would Brian Boitano Do?&quot; by Trey Parker and composer Marc Shaiman.

In the absurdist song, Boitano is cast as an action hero, with his 1988 Olympic Winter Games victory escalated into a series of increasingly ludicrous purported achievements to include fighting grizzly bears in the Alps with his &quot;magical fire breath&quot;, time travel to the year 3010 to do battle with an evil robot king to save humanity (again), and construction of the Great Pyramids of Egypt while at the same time beating up 13th-century Mongol emperor Kublai Khan, because he &quot;doesn&#x27;t take shit from anybody&quot;, and Brian Dennehy confuses the boys saying &quot;Brian Boitano&quot; with his name.

&quot;What Would Brian Boitano Do?&quot; is reprised with an aggressive folk punk version featured prominently in the movie&#x27;s closing credits. Recorded by Stone and Parker&#x27;s band DVDA, the up-tempo and energetic alternate version further reveals that Boitano also has an apparently limitless appetite for chicken wings in a brief heavy metal bridge section.

==Boitano&#x27;s response==
In a series of interviews, Boitano has reacted light-heartedly to the use of his name in the song. Having no prior acquaintance with Parker or Stone, he went to see &quot;Bigger, Longer, and Uncut&quot; alone, with misgivings about possibly being treated harshly in the film. Instead, he experienced hearing the line &quot;What Would Brian Boitano Do?&quot; in the film being received with appreciative laughter, which he found to be &quot;surreal.&quot;

Boitano&#x27;s agent subsequently received permission to make T-shirts featuring the &quot;South Park&quot; Boitano character with the proceeds donated to charity. In addition to providing original art for the project, Stone and Parker included affectionate notes emphasizing their personal respect for Boitano. Boitano in turn appeared on an episode of a VH1 television documentary, &quot;VH1 Goes Inside: South Park&quot; to speak about his perspective on the show. &quot;If they&#x27;d ragged on me, I wouldn&#x27;t have [done the VH1 show]&quot;, Boitano noted in a 2007 &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; interview.

&quot;It&#x27;s become such a part of my life,&quot; Boitano remarked in a 2006 interview with the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle.&quot; &quot;Kids who don&#x27;t know who I am, or what I did at the Olympics, meet me and think I&#x27;m cool because I&#x27;m in &quot;South Park.&quot;&quot;

Boitano also starred in a TV show on the Food Network premiering on August 23, 2009, the title of which, &quot;What Would Brian Boitano Make?&quot;, mirrors the song&#x27;s title. This tangent led to Boitano&#x27;s authorship of a cookbook by the same title, published in 2013.

<text>The Ministry of All the Talents was a national unity government in the United Kingdom formed by William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville, on his appointment as Prime Minister on 11 February 1806, following the death of William Pitt the Younger.

==History==
With the country remaining at war, Grenville aimed to form the strongest possible government and so included most leading politicians from almost all groupings, although some followers of the younger Pitt, led by George Canning, refused to join.

The inclusion of Charles James Fox surprised some as King George III had previously been very hostile to Fox, but the King&#x27;s willingness to put aside past enmities for the sake of national unity encouraged many others to join or support the government as well. The ministry boasted a fairly progressive agenda, much of it inherited from Pitt.

The Ministry of All the Talents had comparatively little success, failing to bring the sought-after peace with France. In fact, the war continued for nearly another decade. It did, however, abolish the slave trade in Britain in 1807 before breaking up in 1807 over the question of Catholic emancipation.

It was succeeded by the Second Portland ministry, headed by William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland.

==List of ministers== 
Members of the Cabinet are in bold face.


;Notes
==Other uses of the term==
The term has since been used in politics to describe an administration with members from more than one party or even a non-coalition government that enjoys cross-party support due to gifted and/or non-partisan members. Examples include the coalition government which led the United Kingdom through the Second World War and the Canadian government that won the 1896 election. In Ireland, the Government of the 20th Dáil (a Fine Gael–Labour coalition that was in office between 1973 and 1977) was widely called the &quot;cabinet of all the talents.&quot;

<doc id="471309" wikidata="Q622898" url="?curid=471309" title="Aqua (user interface)">
<text>Aqua is the graphical user interface, design language and visual theme of Apple&#x27;s macOS and iOS operating systems. It was originally based on the theme of water, with droplet-like components and a liberal use of reflection effects and translucency. Its goal is to &quot;incorporate color, depth, translucence, and complex textures into a visually appealing interface&quot; in macOS applications. At its introduction, Steve Jobs noted that &quot;... it&#x27;s liquid, one of the design goals was when you saw it you wanted to lick it&quot;.

Aqua was first introduced at the 2000 Macworld Conference &amp; Expo in San Francisco. Its first appearance in a commercial product was in the July 2000 release of iMovie 2, followed by Mac OS X 10.0 the following year. Aqua is the successor to Platinum, which was used in Mac OS 8, Mac OS 9, and developer releases of Rhapsody (including Mac OS X Server 1.2). The appearance of Aqua has changed frequently over the years, most recently and drastically with the release of macOS Big Sur in 2020 which Apple calls the &quot;biggest design upgrade since the introduction of Mac OS X.&quot;

== Background ==
For years, Apple had been trying and failing to produce a next-generation Mac OS operating system, including projects code-named Pink, Taligent, and Copland. Mac OS X was ultimately built on NeXTSTEP, after Apple purchased NeXT and its CEO, Steve Jobs, returned to Apple, the company he had cofounded.

Early versions of Mac OS X, called Rhapsody, was a developer release that had an interim user interface, blending MacOS 8&#x27;s &quot;Platinum&quot; and OpenStep looks. The Rhapsody approach was ultimately abandoned, and the new operating system was dubbed Mac OS X in 1998. Early developer previews of Mac OS X shipped with an interface similar to Rhapsody, combining classic Mac OS and NextStep. The final operating system interface, Aqua, would be unveiled at Macworld Expo in January 2000.

== Design elements ==
Aqua uses blue, white, and gray as the principal colors throughout its style. Window toolbars, window backgrounds, buttons, menus and other interface elements are all found in either of these colors. For instance, toolbars and sidebars are often grey or metal-colored, window backgrounds and popup menus are white and buttons (in older systems also scrollbar handles) are accented with a bright blue. In versions of prior to OS X Yosemite, most controls have a &quot;glass&quot; or &quot;gel&quot; effect applied to them. David Pogue described this effect as &quot;lickable globs of Crest Berrylicious Toothpaste Gel&quot;.

macOS has few native customization options to change the overall look of the system. Users can choose a graphite appearance instead of the default blue one. When using the graphite appearance, controls have a slate-like, grey-blue or grey color, including the primary window controls which are red, yellow and green with the default appearance. The appearance option was added at the behest of developers and users who found the blue appearance garish or unprofessional. Yosemite added a dark mode that darkens the predominantly white menubar and Dock. Users can also freely choose a highlight color for text and file selection.

=== Interface elements ===

==== Windows ====
Historically, Aqua had two window designs: the default Aqua windows and &quot;brushed metal&quot; windows. Aqua windows typically have a metal-like or gray titlebar with three buttons on the left side (for closing, minimizing and zooming or entering fullscreen mode). Visually, these buttons used to be placed on top, but later appeared &#x27;sunken&#x27; into the window. Aqua windows have almost no frame or outside border, instead drop shadows are used to separate and distinguish active from inactive windows. The aesthetic of the window backgrounds changed from pin-striped to white backgrounds. Brushed-metal windows had a thick frame with a metallic texture or dark-gray background and sunken buttons and inner frames. They had the additional property of being draggable at every point of the frame instead of just the titlebar and toolbar. Apple recommended brushed-metal windows for applications that mimic real-world devices (such as iTunes) or are used to interface with such devices (such as iSync), but was criticised by designers for not following its own guidelines or applying it inconsistently (it was also used in Safari or Finder). Brushed-metal windows have been largely phased out since Leopard and become visually indistinctive from Aqua windows.

In addition to titlebars, windows can also have toolbars with separate buttons. Up to Leopard, toolbars were visually separated from the titlebar and had the same background as the window frame or were pin-striped. Leopard introduced a unified style that extended the metal-like background of the titlebar to the toolbar, making it appear as one whole. Optionally, a separator could be placed between the titlebar and the toolbar to mimic the previous style. OS X Yosemite brought a compacter version of the toolbar that fused the titlebar and toolbar together, made it shorter and removed the window title (for example, in Safari 8 and later).

Drawers are accessory sidebar views that can slide out from any edge of a window except the top edge. They can be resized perpendicular to their window edge but follow the window&#x27;s size in the other direction. Drawers were once frequently used to display controls and information that did not need to be always visible, but Apple now recommends against their use.

Sheets are dialog boxes that are modal to a specific window. When opened, they are thrust towards the user like a sheet of paper, hence the name. They are partially transparent and focus attention on the content of the sheet. The parent window&#x27;s controls are disabled until the sheet is dismissed, but the user is able to continue work in other windows (including those in the same application) while the sheet is open.

==== Menus ====

Menus are backed with a slightly translucent solid gray, and when menu items are highlighted they appear blue. In application menus, which run in a single bar across the top of the screen, keyboard shortcuts appear to the right-hand side of the menu whilst the actual menu item is on the left. In Yosemite, the menus are much more translucent and have a blur effect.

Drop down menus for use in windows themselves are also available in several varieties. The standard &quot;pop up&quot; menu is white with a blue end cap with opposing arrows, whilst &#x27;pull down&#x27; menus only have one downward facing arrow in the end cap. &#x27;Pull down&#x27; menus are available in four different Aqua varieties, most of which have fallen into disuse in later macOS releases.

==== Text boxes and fields ====
Text boxes are black on white text with a sunken effect border. In addition to regular square text boxes, rounded search text boxes are available . For more extensive text requirements, there is also a multi-line text field. A combined text box and pull down menu is available, which allows the user to type in a value in addition to choosing from a menu. There is also a combination textbox and picker control, which allows the user to type in a date and time or edit it with directional buttons. Mac OS X 10.4 introduced a new interface element that allows the user to drag non-editable &#x27;tokens&#x27; to a text box, between which text can be typed. Whitespace before and after the tokens is trimmed.

==== Push buttons ====
Standard push buttons with rounded corners are available in two varieties: white and blue. A blue button is the default action, and in OS releases prior to Yosemite, would appear to pulse to prompt the user to carry out that action. The action of a blue button can usually also be invoked with the return key. White buttons are usually associated with all other actions.

Also available are rounded bevel buttons, designed to hold an icon; standard square buttons; glass square buttons and round buttons. In addition, circular, purple online help buttons are available which display help relative to the current task when clicked. Disclosure triangles, although technically buttons, allow views of controls to be shown and hidden to preserve space.

==== Checkboxes and radio buttons ====
In macOS, empty check boxes are small, white rounded rectangles. When they are checked, they turn blue and a checkmark is present. They are essentially buttons which can be toggled on or off. Radio buttons are similar in appearance and behaviour except that they are circular and contain a dot instead of a check. Radio buttons are classed into groups of which only one can be activated at a time.

In Yosemite, a short animation was added to show the checkbox or radio button filling in.

==== Tables and lists ====
Tables and lists can be broadly categorised in three ways: A standard multi-columnar table with space to enter values or place other interface elements such as buttons; An outline view that can contain disclosure triangles to show and hide sets of data; and a Miller columns view akin to the column view in the Finder. All table views can use alternating blue and white row backgrounds.

==== Progress indicators ====
Two main types of loading/saving progress indicator are available: a progress bar or a monochromatic spinning wheel (not the spinning pinwheel). The progress bar itself is available in two varieties: indeterminate, which simply shows diagonal blue and white stripes in animation with no measure of progress; or determinate, which shows a blue pulsing bar against a white background proportional to the percentage of a task completed. The spinning wheel indicator, also found in the Mac OS X startup screen since version 10.2, is simply a series of 12 increasingly darker grey lines arranged circularly, like the side view of a spoked wheel rotating clockwise. Many other interfaces have adopted this device, including the Firefox and Camino web browsers and many Web 2.0-influenced web sites.

In Yosemite, the progress bar was changed to a thin, light gray. The &quot;indeterminate&quot; variation kept the pulses, but slower and spaced out. A progress indicator now appears during boot, replacing the spinning wheel indicator found in earlier versions.

==== Miscellaneous ====
Sliders are available in three types: one with tick marks and a triangular scrubber, one with a round scrubber and no tick marks and a circular slider which can be rotated. All are available horizontally or vertically. The circular slider is simply a gray dot on a white circle which can be rotated to set values.

macOS has a standard control for picking colors which appears as a regular square button with a color sample in the middle. When clicked, it shows the standard macOS color palette.

Tabs in macOS are nearly identical to push buttons, with the unselected tab(s) being white and the selected tab being blue. Image &quot;wells&quot; are also available: a small, sunken container into which image files can be dropped. When the well contains an image, it can display a thumbnail representation of the file&#x27;s contents.

=== Typefaces ===
Apple used Lucida Grande as the system typeface from the first release Cheetah to Mavericks. Occasionally, Apple also used Helvetica and Helvetica Neue, such as in applications like Mail and iPhoto. The system typeface was changed to Helvetica Neue in Yosemite and changed again in El Capitan into Apple&#x27;s own San Francisco typeface. macOS makes use of system-wide typeface anti-aliasing to make edges appear smoother and preserve the distinct shapes of typefaces, sometimes at the cost of sharpness and clarity.

=== Animations ===

Aqua makes heavy use of animation. Examples include:
* Dock icons bounce up and down as their corresponding applications are launched.
* Dock icons also bounce up and down, in a different rhythm, when a background application requires the user&#x27;s attention.
* Dock icons can increase in size when approached by the cursor. This feature (called &quot;magnification&quot;) is optional.
* When minimized, windows are &quot;sucked&quot; into the Dock using the &quot;Genie effect&quot; or &quot;Scale effect.&quot; Both of the effects are customizable by the user. The former makes a window turn into a curvy shape so it looks like reverse animation of a genie exiting a lamp, and the latter scales down the window until it is small enough to be in the Dock. By pressing the shift key, both effects can be seen in slow motion. These keystrokes can also be applied to other Aqua effects such as Dashboard, Mission Control and Front Row. Holding Control as well as Shift makes the minimize effect take twice as long as just holding Shift. Holding just Control also slows down the animation slightly. There is another undocumented dock effect called &quot;Suck&quot; which can be enabled by hand editing a configuration file or using a Terminal command; this appears to be the same effect that accompanies the removal of widgets from the Dashboard.
* When a folder on the desktop is opened or closed, the corresponding Finder window appears to come from, or disappear into, the folder icon rather than just appearing from nowhere. This effect was present in the Classic Mac OS Finder as ZoomRects, but had disappeared from early Mac OS X developer releases.
* Sheets are &quot;posted&quot; out of window title bars. Sheets appear to be pieces of paper being thrust toward the user, or slide out like paper from a tray.
* Dashboard widgets appear to fly onto the screen. Dashboard widgets appear with a &quot;ripple&quot; effect, as if being dropped onto the surface of a pond. When removed, widgets are sucked into the close button as if being drawn into a vacuum. This effect can be applied on windows being minimized to the Dock. Starting from Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, the default Dashboard configuration differs from that of previous versions (it takes its own space in Mission Control), causing the rippling effect to be removed. However, the user can re-invoke the original Dashboard (along with the ripple effect) in System Preferences.
* The contents of a stack will appear to spring out from behind the icon when clicked.
* In the Mac OS X Public Beta, docked items dragged onto the desktop simply disappeared, apparently &#x27;dropping&#x27; onto the desktop. This behaviour was changed with Mac OS X 10.0; from this release onward, items dragged off the dock would &#x27;disappear&#x27; in a cartoon-like puff of smoke, an effect which Apple later used in various places (such as Safari&#x27;s Bookmarks Bar and iPhoto&#x27;s tag removal). A similar effect was used in Apple&#x27;s Newton OS. In OS X 10.10 Yosemite, this effect is no longer present; the item simply disappears, however can still be seen on the boot picker of Intel-based Mac computers when a boot device (such as a external hard-drive) is disconnected from the computer.
* Starting from Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, windows which contain a document or website open with an animation similar to Windows Aero. A similar zoom effect can be seen when opening files from the desktop, or within a Finder window. This also applies to the entire desktop when a user logs in.
*When fast user switching is used, Apple&#x27;s &quot;Cube&quot; effect is used to transfer between desktops and/or the login window. 

Many of these effects can be turned off by the user or are only available on supported hardware.

=== Underlying technology ===
Aqua is powered by the display server Quartz Compositor.

==History==

Jobs introduced the Aqua interface as an attempt by Apple to create a more powerful interface for professional users, while making an approachable product for new computer users.

=== Mac OS X Jaguar, Panther and Tiger ===
Mac OS X 10.2 &quot;Jaguar&quot; brought flatter interface elements, such as new buttons and drop-down menus, and reduced the transparency to tone down the pinstripes in windows and menus. These trends continued in subsequent Mac OS X releases.

In Mac OS X Panther buttons were made to appear sunken into their surroundings, following a general trend of more flattened interface elements in the operating system. The traditional pinstripes were replaced with a much subtler theme, most notably in the menu bar, and the use of transparency was again reduced (for example in the title bars of inactive windows). Tabs also changed; they were made flatter and the whole tab area was sunken rather than raised. Tab buttons were centered on the top border of the tab area. New icons appeared across the system, including a new flatter, glossier Finder icon and a new System Preferences icon. Panther also featured an increased use of the &quot;Brushed Metal&quot; look, especially to the Finder and Safari web browser. Brushed Metal had first appeared in QuickTime Player 4.0 in 1999. Apple&#x27;s Human Interface Guidelines stated that the brushed metal interface be used for programs that mimic the operation or interface of common real world devices (skeuomorphism).

Mac OS X Tiger brought more subtle changes, including the unified titlebar scheme. Pinstripes were removed from the menu bar entirely and replaced with a glossy, white look. Tabs were altered to appear as normal segmented buttons. The Apple menu icon was toned down to a more matte appearance and the new Spotlight search utility was permanently bound to the very right of the menu bar in the same color and gradient of the Apple menu.

=== Mac OS X Leopard and Snow Leopard ===
Mac OS X Leopard brought wide-ranging changes to Aqua. Aqua windows and &quot;brushed metal&quot; windows obtained the same metal-like, gray look, pin-striped backgrounds were removed entirely, toolbars and titlebars were fused into a whole, differences between active and inactive windows became more distinct through thicker drop shadows and a monochrome appearance of inactive windows, the color of the menubar was changed into gray with an optional semi-transparency look on capable Macs and the Dock obtained a 3D look with a reflective glass-like &#x27;floor&#x27;. The Dock&#x27;s design, when placed on the left or right side, changed to a black translucent background with a white border and rounded corners. Context menus had slightly-rounded corners and numerous icons were redesigned, including folder icons and System Preferences icons.

Mac OS X Snow Leopard made almost no changes to Aqua. Most notably, the context menu of Dock items changed from a solid white to a translucent black.

=== Mac OS X Lion, OS X Mountain Lion and Mavericks ===
Mac OS X Lion introduced many changes inspired by iOS that persisted in OS X Mavericks as well as OS X Yosemite, although the latter changed the overall aesthetic. Scrollbars were removed and scrollbar handles turned into thin, semi-transparent bars that disappear when not used. The corner radii of push buttons were reduced, giving an appearance similar to Mac OS 8 and 9. The gel-like appearance of most components was replaced with a slightly glossy and flatter look. Window backgrounds became slightly brighter and window corners were rounded. Lion also added more animations.

OS X Mountain Lion brought only minor changes and changed the Dock&#x27;s appearance into a frosted-glass style, with rounded corners, rectangular indicator lights, a new diagonal separator and a new Trash icon.

OS X Mavericks dispensed with several rich and ornamental designs, reflecting the design overhaul in . The applications Calendar, Contacts and Notes respectively lost their leather, book and notepad appearance (all introduced in Lion). Linen textures in Notification Center and Launchpad were removed as well and replaced with simple gray backgrounds.

=== OS X Yosemite, El Capitan, macOS Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave, and Catalina ===
In OS X Yosemite, many of the Aqua elements and icons were simplified and flattened, following a similar design change in . Apple incorporated the same saturated frosted-glass effect, called &quot;Vibrancy&quot;, across the system. Examples include the Dock, the menubar, sidebars, Notification Center and Mission Control. A similar effect was applied to toolbars, but they maintained their gray appearance. Toolbar buttons became white and Apple introduced a more compact type of toolbar that removed the window title, but retained the toolbar buttons (for example, in Safari). Certain controls, such as checkboxes and radio buttons, gained animations, whereas animations in other places were removed, such as the &quot;poof&quot; animation when removing an icon from the Dock and the &quot;cube&quot; animation when fast-switching to another user account. Apple changed the system typeface to Helvetica Neue. Yosemite also added a &#x27;dark theme&#x27; you can turn on in the settings which makes the dock and menu bar black.

OS X El Capitan made only minor changes to Aqua. The white toolbar buttons regained a slightly glossy look, the spinning pinwheel was redesigned and the Vibrancy effect was reduced in certain areas, such as Mission Control. The system typeface was changed once more, to Apple&#x27;s own San Francisco typeface, concurrent with and following the typeface&#x27;s release in watchOS in April 2015. These changes continued throughout macOS Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave, and Catalina.

=== macOS Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma and Sequoia ===

macOS Big Sur brought major changes to Aqua design that brings it in line with other Apple platforms such as iOS and iPadOS. The Dock is now detached from the screen edge and more rounded on all corners. The icons are now all squircle-shaped and take on more noticeable depth in general. Titlebars lose their gradient chrome, opting for a flat white look, and the titlebar text is now bold, and inline with toolbar items, which are no longer contained within a distinct background. Modal dialogs have changed significantly, only being as large as the content inside; laid out with a large icon at the top, text in the center, and buttons at the bottom. Sheets no longer slide out like paper from under the titlebar, instead more simply fading in from the center of the window. Unified sidebars have become more commonplace and are the default for all applications. Windows now have more rounded corners take on a tint from the user&#x27;s wallpaper, akin to Windows 11&#x27;s Mica effect. The menubar is now completely transparent, using a strong blur to differentiate from the background. This revision of Aqua continued to be used in macOS Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma, and Sequoia.

=== Microsoft Windows apps ===

Aqua has also been embedded in Apple&#x27;s applications for Microsoft Windows, such as iTunes, QuickTime and Safari (although not in Safari 4). iTunes for Windows has generally adopted the same developments as the concurrent macOS version, with the exception of the use of native Windows user interface controls and Windows-style title bar buttons at the upper right of the player window. The Windows version of Safari, in version 3, included a functional Aqua look and feel that was very similar to macOS. As of version 4, a more Windows-like theme was employed using the standard Windows user interface controls and window border. QuickTime for Windows uses the same theme as seen in older versions of QuickTime for , with brushed-metal windows and Aqua buttons on top.

== Criticism ==
Much of Aqua&#x27;s original design resembled the translucent two-tone look of Apple&#x27;s contemporary hardware. In 2003 and 2004, Apple moved to the use of brushed aluminium in their industrial design (such as with the aluminium Apple Cinema Displays). The design of Aqua changed accordingly. This somewhat inconsistent mix of interface styles has been controversial among the Mac community.

== Litigation ==
In the past, Apple has threatened legal action against those who make themes similar to their look and feel. The Mac skinning community took exception to Apple&#x27;s heavy-handed actions against all Aqua lookalikes. Stardock&#x27;s Brad Wardell contrasted the company&#x27;s litigious approach with Microsoft&#x27;s approach to incorporating third-party skins into Windows XP.
