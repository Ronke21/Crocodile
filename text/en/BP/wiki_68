<text>In education, a curriculum (; : curriculums or curricula ) is the totality of student experiences that occur in an educational process. The term often refers specifically to a planned sequence of instruction, or to a view of the student&#x27;s experiences in terms of the educator&#x27;s or school&#x27;s instructional goals. A curriculum may incorporate the planned interaction of pupils with instructional content, materials, resources, and processes for evaluating the attainment of educational objectives. Curricula are split into several categories: the explicit, the implicit (including the hidden), the excluded, and the extracurricular.

Curricula may be tightly standardized or may include a high level of instructor or learner autonomy. Many countries have national curricula in primary and secondary education, such as the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Curriculum.

UNESCO&#x27;s International Bureau of Education has the primary mission of studying curricula and their implementation worldwide.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;curriculum&quot; began as a Latin word which means &quot;a race&quot; or &quot;the course of a race&quot; (which in turn derives from the verb &quot;currere&quot; meaning &quot;to run/to proceed&quot;). The word is &quot;from a Modern Latin transferred use of classical Latin curriculum &quot;a running, course, career&quot; (also &quot;a fast chariot, racing car&quot;), from currere &quot;to run&quot; (from PIE root *kers- &quot;to run&quot;).&quot; The first known use in an educational context is in the &quot;Professio Regia&quot;, a work by University of Paris professor Petrus Ramus published posthumously in 1576. The term subsequently appears in University of Leiden records in 1582. The word&#x27;s origins appear closely linked to the Calvinist desire to bring greater order to education.

By the seventeenth century, the University of Glasgow also referred to its &quot;course&quot; of study as a &quot;curriculum&quot;, producing the first known use of the term in English in 1633. By the nineteenth century, European universities routinely referred to their curriculum to describe both the complete course of study (as for a degree in surgery) and particular courses and their content. By 1824, the word was defined as &quot;a course, especially a fixed course of study at a college, university, or school.&quot;

==Definitions and interpretations==
=== Professional interpretations ===
There is no generally agreed upon definition of curriculum. There various definitions that describe the term.

Through the readings of Smith, Dewey, and Kelly, four types of curricula could be defined as:

* Explicit curriculum: subjects that will be taught, the identified &quot;mission&quot; of the school, and the knowledge and skills that the school expects successful students to acquire.
* Implicit curriculum: lessons that arise from the culture of the school and the behaviors, attitudes, and expectations that characterize that culture, the unintended curriculum.
* Hidden curriculum: things which students learn, &#x27;because of the way in which the work of the school is planned and organized but which are not in themselves overtly included in the planning or even in the consciousness of those responsible for the school arrangements (Kelly, 2009). The term itself is attributed to Philip W. Jackson and is not always meant to be a negative. Hidden curriculum, if its potential is realized, could benefit students and learners in all educational systems. Also, it does not just include the physical environment of the school, but the relationships formed or not formed between students and other students or even students and teachers (Jackson, 1986).
* Excluded curriculum: topics or perspectives that are specifically excluded from the curriculum.

It may also come in the form of extracurricular activities. This may include school-sponsored programs, which are intended to supplement the academic aspect of the school experience or community-based programs and activities. Examples of school-sponsored extracurricular programs include sports, academic clubs, and performing arts. Community-based programs and activities may take place at a school after hours but are not linked directly to the school. Community-based programs frequently expand on the curriculum that was introduced in the classroom. For instance, students may be introduced to environmental conservation in the classroom. This knowledge is further developed through a community-based program. Participants then act on what they know with a conservation project. Community-based extracurricular activities may include &quot;environmental clubs, 4-H, boy/girl scouts, and religious groups&quot; (Hancock, Dyk, &amp; Jones, 2012).

Kerr defines curriculum as &quot;all the learning which is planned and guided by the school, whether it is carried on in groups or individually, inside or outside of school.&quot;

Braslavsky states that curriculum is an agreement among communities, educational professionals, and the State on what learners should take on during specific periods of their lives. Furthermore, the curriculum defines &quot;why, what, when, where, how, and with whom to learn.&quot;

Smith (1996, 2000) says that, &quot;[a] syllabus will not generally indicate the relative importance of its topics or the order in which they are to be studied. Where people still equate curriculum with a syllabus they are likely to limit their planning to a consideration of the content or the body of knowledge that they wish to transmit.&quot;

According to Smith, a curriculum can be ordered into a procedure:
:Step 1: Diagnosis of needs.
:Step 2: Formulation of objectives.
:Step 3: Selection of content.
:Step 4: Organization of content.
:Step 5: Selection of learning experiences.
:Step 6: Organization of learning experiences.
:Step 7: Determination of what to evaluate and of the ways and means of doing it.

=== Types of curricula ===
Under some definitions, curriculum is prescriptive, and is based on a more general syllabus which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.

A curriculum may also refer to a defined and prescribed course of studies, which students must fulfill in order to pass a certain level of education. For example, an elementary school might discuss how its curricula is designed to improve national testing scores or help students learn fundamental skills. An individual teacher might also refer to his or her curriculum, meaning all the subjects that will be taught during a school year. The courses are arranged in a sequence to make learning a subject easier. In schools, a curriculum spans several grades.

On the other hand, a high school might refer to their curricula as the courses required in order to receive one&#x27;s diploma. They might also refer to it in exactly the same way as an elementary school and use it to mean both individual courses needed to pass as well as the overall offering of courses, which help prepare a student for life after high school.

A curriculum can be seen from different perspectives. What societies envisage as important teaching and learning constitutes the &quot;intended&quot; curriculum. Since it is usually presented in official documents, it may be also called the &quot;written&quot; or &quot;official&quot; curriculum. However, at a classroom level this intended curriculum may be altered through a range of complex classroom interactions, and what is actually delivered can be considered the &quot;implemented&quot; curriculum. What learners really learn (i.e. what can be assessed and can be demonstrated as learning outcomes or competencies) constitutes the &quot;achieved&quot; or &quot;learned&quot; curriculum. In addition, curriculum theory points to a &quot;hidden&quot; curriculum (i.e. the unintended development of personal values and beliefs of learners, teachers, and communities; the unexpected impact of a curriculum; or the unforeseen aspects of a learning process). Those who develop the intended curriculum should have all these different dimensions of the curriculum in view. While the &quot;written&quot; curriculum does not exhaust the meaning of curriculum, it is important because it represents the vision of the society. The &quot;written&quot; curriculum is usually expressed in comprehensive and user-friendly documents, such as curriculum frameworks or subject curricula/syllabi, and in relevant and helpful learning materials, such as textbooks, teacher guides, and assessment guides.

In some cases, people see the curriculum entirely in terms of the subjects that are taught, and as set out within the set of textbooks, and forget the wider goals of competencies and personal development. This is why a curriculum framework is important. It sets the subjects within this wider context, and shows how learning experiences within the subjects need to contribute to the attainment of the wider goals.

Curriculum is almost always defined with relation to schooling. According to some, it is the major division between formal and informal education. However, under some circumstances it may also be applied to informal education or free-choice learning settings. For instance, a science museum may have a &quot;curriculum&quot; of what topics or exhibits it wishes to cover. Many after-school programs in the US have tried to apply the concept; this typically has more success when not rigidly clinging to the definition of curriculum as a product or as a body of knowledge to be transferred. Rather, informal education and free-choice learning settings are more suited to the model of curriculum as practice or praxis.

===Historical conception===

Whatever the origins and intentions of early curricula, the function of inculcating culture had emerged by the time of ancient Babylonia. Ancient Roman curricula came to emphasise Greek as well as Latin skills, with emphasis on the study of classical poetry. This model influenced the curricula of medieval and Renaissance
education.

In the early years of the 20th century, the traditional concept held of the curriculum was &quot;that it is a body of subjects or subject matter prepared by the teachers for the students to learn&quot;. It was synonymous to the &quot;course of study&quot; and &quot;syllabus&quot;.

In &quot;The Curriculum&quot;, the first textbook published on the subject, in 1918, John Franklin Bobbitt said that curriculum, as an idea, has its roots in the Latin word for &quot;race-course&quot;, explaining the curriculum as the course of deeds and experiences through which children become the adults they should be to succeed later in life. Furthermore, the curriculum encompasses the entire scope of formative deed and experience occurring in and out of school - such as experiences that are unplanned and undirected or those that are intentionally directed for the purposeful formation of adult members of society - not only experiences occurring in school. (cf. image at right.)

To Bobbitt, the curriculum is a social-engineering arena. Per his cultural presumptions and social definitions, his curricular formulation has two notable features:

* that scientific experts would best be qualified to and justified in designing curricula based upon their expert knowledge of what qualities are desirable in adult members of society, and which experiences would generate said qualities
* curriculum defined as the deeds-experiences the student &quot;ought to have&quot; to become the adult he or she &quot;ought to become&quot;

Hence, he defined the curriculum as an ideal, rather than as the concrete reality of the deeds and experiences that form who and what people become.

Contemporary views of curriculum reject these features of Bobbitt&#x27;s postulates, but retain the basis of curriculum as the course of experience(s) that form humans into persons. Personal formation via curricula is studied both at the personal and group levels, i.e. cultures and societies (e.g. professional formation, academic discipline via historical experience). The formation of a group is reciprocal, with the formation of its individual participants.

Although it formally appeared in Bobbitt&#x27;s definition, curriculum as a course of formative experience also pervades the work of John Dewey (1859–1952), who disagreed with Bobbitt on important matters. Although Bobbitt&#x27;s and Dewey&#x27;s idealistic understanding of &quot;curriculum&quot; is different from current, restricted uses of the word, writers of curricula and researchers generally share it as common, substantive understanding of curriculum. Development does not mean just getting something out of the mind. It is a development of experience and into experience that is really wanted.

Robert M. Hutchins (1899–1977), president of the University of Chicago, regarded curriculum as &quot;permanent studies&quot; where the rules of grammar, rhetoric, logic, and mathematics for basic education are emphasized. Basic education should emphasize the three Rs and college education should be grounded on liberal education. On the other hand, Arthur Bestor (1908–1994), an essentialist, believes that the mission of the school should be intellectual training. Hence, curriculum should focus on the fundamental intellectual disciplines of grammar, literature, and writing. It should also include mathematics, science, history, and foreign language.

According to Joseph Schwab, discipline is the sole source of curriculum. In our education system, curriculum is divided into chunks of knowledge called subject areas in basic education including English, mathematics, science, and social studies. In college, discipline may include humanities, sciences, languages, and many more. Curricula should consist entirely of knowledge which comes from various disciplines. Dewey proposed that learning the lesson should be more interesting and beneficial than receiving a scolding, being ridiculed, or being required to stay after school, among other punishments.

Thus, a curriculum can be viewed as a field of study. It is made up of its foundations (philosophical, historical, psychological, and social foundations), domains of knowledge, as well as its research theories and principles. Curricula as an area of study should be scholarly and theoretical. The field is concerned with broad, historical, philosophical social issues and academics. Mark Smith suggests a starting definition of &quot;curriculum&quot; offered by John Kerr and taken up by Vic Kelly in his standard work on the curriculum: &quot;All the learning which is planned and guided by the school, whether it is carried on in groups or individually, inside or outside the school&quot;.

There are four ways of approaching curriculum theory and practice:
# curriculum as a body of knowledge to be transmitted
# curriculum as an attempt to help students achieve a goal
# curriculum as a process
# curriculum as praxis
In recent years the field of education and curriculum has expanded outside the walls of the classroom and into other settings, such as museums. Within these settings curriculum is an even broader topic, including various teachers, inanimate objects such as audio-tour devices, and even the learners themselves. As with the traditional idea of curriculum, curriculum in a free-choice learning-environment can consist of the explicit stated curriculum and the hidden curriculum; both of which contribute to the learner&#x27;s experience and lessons from the experience. These elements are further compounded by the setting, cultural influences, and the state of mind of the learner. Museums and other similar settings are most commonly leveraged within traditional classroom settings as enhancements to the curriculum when educators develop curricula that encompass visits to museums, zoos, and aquariums.

===Progressivist views===

On the other hand, to a progressivist, a listing of school subjects, syllabi, courses of study, and lists of courses of specific discipline do not make a curriculum. These can only be called curriculum if the written materials are actualized by the learner. Broadly speaking, curriculum is defined as the total learning experiences of the individual. This definition is anchored on John Dewey&#x27;s definition of experience and education. He believed that reflective thinking is a means that unifies curricular elements. Thought is not derived from action but tested by application.

Caswell and Campbell viewed curricula as &quot;all experiences children have under the guidance of teachers.&quot; This definition is shared by Smith, Stanley, and Shores when they defined curriculum as &quot;a sequence of potential experiences set up in schools for the purpose of disciplining children and youth in group ways of thinking and acting.&quot;

Curriculum as a process is when a teacher enters a particular schooling and situation with the ability to think critically, an understanding of their role and the expectations others have of them, and a proposal for action which sets out essential principles and features of the educational encounter. Guided by these, they encourage conversations between, and with, people in the situation out of which may come a course of thinking and action. Plus, the teacher continually evaluates the process and what they can see of outcomes.

Marsh and Willis view curricula as all the &quot;experiences in the classroom which are planned and enacted by teacher, and also learned by the students.&quot;

Any definition of curriculum, if it is to be practically effective and productive, must offer much more than a statement about knowledge-content or merely the subjects which schooling is to teach, transmit, or deliver. Some would argue of the course that the values implicit in the arrangements made by schools for their pupils are quite clearly in the consciousness of teachers and planners, again especially when the planners are politicians, and are equally clearly accepted by them as part of what pupils should learn in school, even if they are not overtly recognized by the pupils themselves. In other words, those who design curricula deliberately plan the schools&#x27; &quot;expressive culture&quot;. If this is the case, then, the curriculum is &#x27;hidden&#x27; only to or from the pupils, and the values to be learned clearly from a part of what is planned for pupils. They must, therefore, be accepted as fully a part of the curriculum, and especially as an important focus because questions must be asked concerning the legitimacy of such practices.

Currently, a spiral curriculum is promoted as allowing students to revisit a subject matter&#x27;s content at the different levels of development of the subject matter being studied. The constructivist approach proposes that children learn best via pro-active engagement with the educational environment, as in learning through discovery.

==Primary and secondary education==
A curriculum may be partly or entirely determined by an external, authoritative body (e.g., the National Curriculum for England in English schools, or the International Primary Curriculum for International Schools).

Crucial to the curriculum is the definition of the course objectives that usually are expressed as learning outcomes and normally include the program&#x27;s assessment strategy. These outcomes and assessments are grouped as units (or modules), and, therefore, the curriculum comprises a collection of such units, each, in turn, comprising a specialized, specific part of the curriculum. So, a typical curriculum includes communications, numeracy, information technology, and social skills units, with specific, specialized teaching of each.

Core curricula are often instituted, at the primary and secondary levels, by school boards, Departments of Education, or other administrative agencies charged with overseeing education. A core curriculum is a curriculum, or course of study, which is deemed central and usually made mandatory for all students of a school or school system. However, even when core requirements exist, they do not necessarily involve a requirement for students to engage in one particular class or activity. For example, a school might mandate a music appreciation class, but students may opt out if they take a performing arts class.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, the Australian Curriculum took effect nationwide in 2014, after a curriculum development process that began in 2010. Previously, each state&#x27;s Education Department had traditionally established curricula. The Australian Curriculum consists of one curriculum covering eight subject areas through year 10, and another covering fifteen subjects for the senior secondary years.

=== Canada ===
In Canada each province and territory has the authority to create its own curriculum. However, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut both choose to use the Alberta Curriculum for select parts of their curriculum. The territories also use Alberta&#x27;s standardized tests in some subjects.
===Iran===
Iran has recently changed back to 6 year instead of 5 Elementary schools and two three year junior and second middle/high schools. There is Islamic seminary Hawza are also with 10-14 year programming.

=== South Korea ===
The National Curriculum of Korea covers kindergarten, primary, secondary, and special education. The version currently in place is the 7th National Curriculum, which has been revised in 2007 and 2009. The curriculum provides a framework for a common set of subjects through 9th grade, and elective subjects in grades 10 through 12.

===Japan===
The curriculum in Japan is determined based on the guidelines for education and the guidelines for learning presented by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). When deciding on the curriculum for each school, the school&#x27;s organizers will decide on the outline by referring to the manuals and explanations prepared by the Education, Science and Technology Ministry and other public offices, and the schools will decide on additional annual plans. The Courses of Education and Courses of Study are fully revised every 10 years. Before World War II, the curriculum was based on the school regulations corresponding to each school type.

=== The Netherlands ===

The Dutch system is based on directives coming from the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW). Primary and secondary education use key objectives to create curricula. For primary education the total number of objectives has been reduced from 122 in 1993 to 58 in 2006. Starting in 2009 and 2010 all key objectives are obligatory for primary education. The key objectives are oriented towards subject areas such as language, mathematics, orientation towards self and the world, art, and physical education. All of the objectives have accompanying concrete activities. Also final exams are determined by the OCW and required. Parts of those exams are taken in a national setting, created by the Centrale Examencommissie Vaststelling Opgaven (CEVO). Furthermore, the OCW will determine the number of hours to be spent per subject. Apart from these directives every school can determine its own curriculum.

===Nigeria===
In 2005, the Nigerian government adopted a national Basic Education Curriculum for grades 1 through 9. The policy was an outgrowth of the Universal Basic Education program announced in 1999, to provide free, compulsory, continuous public education for these years. In 2014, the government implemented a revised version of the national curriculum, reducing the number of subjects covered from 20 to 10.

===Russia===
Core curriculum has typically been highly emphasized in Soviet and Russian universities and technical institutes.

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====

The National Curriculum was introduced into England, Wales and Northern Ireland as a nationwide curriculum for primary and secondary state schools following the Education Reform Act 1988. It does not apply to private schools, which may set their own curricula, but it ensures that state schools of all local education authorities have a common curriculum. Academy schools have a significant degree of autonomy in deviating from the National Curriculum.

Every state school must offer a curriculum which is balanced and broadly based and which promotes the spiritual, moral, cultural, mental and physical development of pupils at the school and of society, and prepares pupils at the school for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of later life. For each of the statutory curriculum subjects, the Secretary of State for Education is required to set out a Programme of Study which outlines the content and matters which must be taught in those subjects at relevant Key Stages. Teachers should set high expectations for every pupil. They should plan stretching work for pupils whose attainment is significantly above the expected standard. Teachers should use appropriate assessment to set targets which are deliberately ambitious.

====Scotland====
In Scotland, the Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) was introduced in August 2010 in all schools. The national qualifications were introduced in 2013 by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA). The national qualifications include the Life Skills Coursework (SFL), National 3 (NAT3), National 4 (NAT4), National 5 (NAT5), Higher, and Advanced Higher.

===United States===
In the U.S., each state, with the individual school districts, establishes the curricula taught. Each state, however, builds its curriculum with great participation of national academic subject groups selected by the United States Department of Education such as the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) for mathematical instruction.

The Common Core State Standards Initiative (CCSSI) promulgates a core set of standards which are specific information and skills a student needs to know at each grade level in order to graduate. States may adopt these standards in part or whole and expand upon them. Schools and states (depending on how much control a state gives to its local schools) then develop their curriculum to meet each of these standards. This coordination is intended to make it possible to use more of the same textbooks across states, and to move toward a more uniform minimum level of education attainment.

According to the CCSSI, &quot;[d]ecisions on how to implement the standards, including the right supports to put in place, are made at the state and local levels. As such, states and localities are taking different approaches to implementing the standards and providing their teachers with the supports they need to help students successfully reach the standards.&quot;

====Higher education====

Many educational institutions are currently trying to balance two opposing forces. On the one hand, some believe students should have a common knowledge foundation, often in the form of a core curriculum whereas others want students to be able to pursue their own educational interests, often through early specialty in a major or through the free choice of courses. This tension has received a large amount of coverage due to Harvard University&#x27;s reorganization of its core requirements.

An essential feature of curriculum design, seen in every college catalog and at every other level of schooling, is the identification of prerequisites for each course. These prerequisites can be satisfied by taking particular courses, and in some cases by examination, or by other means, such as work experience. In general, more advanced courses in any subject require some foundation in basic courses, but some coursework requires study in other departments, as in the sequence of math classes required for a physics major, or the language requirements for students preparing in literature, music, or scientific research. A more detailed curriculum design must deal with prerequisites within a course for each topic taken up. This in turn leads to the problems of course organization and scheduling once the dependencies between topics are known.

====Core curriculum====

At the undergraduate level, individual college and university administrations and faculties sometimes mandate core curricula, especially in the liberal arts. However, because of increasing specialization and depth in the student&#x27;s major field of study, a typical core curriculum in higher education mandates a far smaller proportion of a student&#x27;s course work than a high school or elementary school core curriculum prescribes.

Among the best known and most expansive core curricula programs at leading American colleges and universities are those of Columbia University and the University of Chicago. Both can take up to two years to complete without advanced standing, and are designed to foster critical skills in a broad range of academic disciplines, including the social sciences, humanities, physical and biological sciences, mathematics, writing and foreign languages.

In 1999, the University of Chicago announced plans to reduce and modify the content of its core curriculum, including lowering the number of required courses from 21 to 15 and offering a wider range of content. When &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot;, and other major news outlets picked up this story, the university became the focal point of a national debate on education. A set of university administrators, notably then-President Hugo F. Sonnenschein, argued that reducing the core curriculum had become both a financial and educational imperative, as the university was struggling to attract a commensurate volume of applicants to its undergraduate division compared to peer schools as a result of what was perceived by the pro-change camp as a reaction by &quot;the average eighteen-year-old&quot; to the expanse of the collegiate core.

As core curricula began to diminish over the course of the twentieth century at many American schools, some smaller institutions became famous for embracing a core curriculum that covers nearly the student&#x27;s entire undergraduate education, often utilizing classic texts of the western canon to teach all subjects including science. Five Great Books colleges in the United States follow this approach: St. John&#x27;s, Shimer, Thomas Aquinas, Gutenberg College and Thomas More.

====Distribution requirements====
Some colleges opt for the middle ground of the continuum between specified and unspecified curricula by using a system of distribution requirements. In such a system, students are required to take courses in particular fields of learning, but are free to choose specific courses within those fields.

====Open curriculum====

Other institutions have largely done away with core requirements in their entirety. Brown University offers the &quot;Open Curriculum&quot;, implemented after a student-led reform movement in 1969, which allows students to take courses without concern for any requirements except those in their chosen concentrations (majors), plus two writing courses. In this vein, it is possible for students to graduate without taking college-level science or math courses, or to take only science or math courses. Amherst College requires that students take one of a list of first-year seminars, but has no required classes or distribution requirements. Similarly, Grinnell College requires students to take a First-Year Tutorial in their first semester, and has no other class or distribution requirements. Others include Evergreen State College, Hamilton College, and Smith College.

Wesleyan University is another school that has not and does not require any set distribution of courses. However, Wesleyan does make clear &quot;General Education Expectations&quot; such that if a student does not meet these expectations, he/she would not be eligible for academic honors upon graduation.

== Gender inequality in curricula ==
Gender inequality in curricula is how men and women are not treated equally in several types of curricula. More precisely, gender inequality is visible in the curriculum of both schools and Teacher Education Institutes (TEIs). Physical education (PE) is an example where gender equality issues are highlighted because of preconceived stereotyping of boys and girls. The general belief is that boys are better at physical activities than girls, and that girls are better at &#x27;home&#x27; activities such as sewing and cooking. This is the case in many cultures around the world and is not specific to one culture only.

<doc id="479987" wikidata="Q15146" url="?curid=479987" title="Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar">
<text>The Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar (&quot;Dynamic Soarer&quot;) was a United States Air Force (USAF) program to develop a spaceplane that could be used for a variety of military missions, including aerial reconnaissance, bombing, space rescue, satellite maintenance, and as a space interceptor to sabotage enemy satellites. The program ran from October 24, 1957, to December 10, 1963, cost US$660 million ($ in current dollars), and was cancelled just after spacecraft construction had begun.

Other spacecraft under development at the time, such as Mercury or Vostok, were space capsules with ballistic re-entry profiles that ended in a landing under a parachute. Dyna-Soar was more like an aircraft. It could travel to distant targets at the speed of an intercontinental ballistic missile, was designed to glide to Earth like an aircraft under the control of a pilot, and could land at an airfield. Dyna-Soar could also reach Earth orbit, like conventional, crewed space capsules.

These characteristics made Dyna-Soar a far more advanced concept than other human spaceflight missions of the period. Research into a spaceplane was realized much later in other reusable spacecraft such as the 1981–2011 Space Shuttle and the more recent Boeing X-40 and X-37B spacecraft.

==Background==
The concept underlying the X-20 was developed in Germany during World War II by Eugen Sänger and Irene Bredt as part of the 1941 proposal. This was a design for a rocket-powered bomber able to attack New York City from bases in Germany and then fly on for landing somewhere in the Pacific Ocean held by the Empire of Japan. The idea would be to use the vehicle&#x27;s wings to generate lift and pull up into a new ballistic trajectory, exiting the atmosphere again and giving the vehicle time to cool off between the skips. After the war, it was demonstrated that the heating load during the skips was much higher than initially calculated and would have melted the spacecraft.

Following the war, many German scientists were taken to the United States by the Office of Strategic Services&#x27;s Operation Paperclip, bringing with them detailed knowledge of the Silbervogel project. Among them, Walter Dornberger and Krafft Ehricke moved to Bell Aircraft, where, in 1952, they proposed what was essentially a vertical launch version of known as the &quot;Bomber Missile&quot;, or &quot;BoMi&quot;.

These studies all proposed various rocket-powered vehicles that could travel vast distances by gliding after being boosted to high speed and altitude by a rocket stage. The rocket booster would place the vehicle onto a suborbital, but , trajectory, resulting in a brief spaceflight followed by re-entry into the atmosphere. Instead of a full re-entry and landing, the vehicle would use the lift from its wings to redirect its glide angle upward, trading horizontal velocity for vertical velocity. In this way, the vehicle would be &quot;bounced&quot; back into space again. This skip-glide method would repeat until the speed was low enough that the pilot of the vehicle would need to pick a landing spot and glide the vehicle to a landing. This use of hypersonic atmospheric lift meant that the vehicle could greatly extend its range over a ballistic trajectory using the same rocket booster.

There was enough interest in BoMi that by 1956 it had evolved into three separate programs:
* RoBo (Rocket Bomber), updated version of BoMi.
* Brass Bell, a long-range reconnaissance vehicle.
* Hywards (Hypersonic Weapons Research and Development Supporting system), a smaller prototype system to develop the technologies needed for Robo and Brass Bell.

==Development==
Days after the launch of Sputnik 1 on 4 October 1957, on either October 10 or October 24, the USAF Air Research and Development Command (ARDC) consolidated Hywards, Brass Bell, and Robo studies into the Dyna-Soar project, or Weapons System 464L, with a three-step abbreviated development plan. The proposal drew together the existing boost-glide proposals into a single vehicle designed to carry out all the bombing and reconnaissance tasks examined by the earlier studies, and would act as successor to the X-15 research program.

The three stages of the Dyna-Soar program were to be a research vehicle (Dyna-Soar I), a reconnaissance vehicle (Dyna-Soar II, previously Brass Bell), and a vehicle that added strategic bombing capability (Dyna-Soar III, previously Robo). The first glide tests for Dyna-Soar I were expected to be carried out in 1963, followed by powered flights, reaching Mach 18, the following year. A robotic glide missile was to be deployed in 1968, with the fully operational weapons system (Dyna-Soar III) expected by 1974.

In March 1958, nine U.S. aerospace companies tendered for the Dyna-Soar contract. Of these, the field was narrowed to proposals from Bell and Boeing. Even though Bell had the advantage of six years&#x27; worth of design studies, the contract for the spaceplane was awarded to Boeing in June 1959 (by which time their original design had changed markedly and now closely resembled what Bell had submitted). In late 1961, the Titan III was chosen as the launch vehicle. The Dyna-Soar was to be launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.

==Spacecraft description==

The overall design of the X-20 Dyna-Soar was outlined in March 1960. It had a low-wing delta shape, with winglets for control rather than a more conventional tail. The framework of the craft was to be made from the René 41 super alloy, as were the upper surface panels. The bottom surface was to be made from molybdenum sheets placed over insulated René 41, while the nose-cone was to be made from graphite with zirconia rods.

Due to changing requirements, several versions of the Dyna-Soar were considered, all sharing the same basic shape and layout. A single pilot sat at the front, with an equipment bay situated behind. This bay contained data-collection equipment, weapons, reconnaissance equipment, or a four-person mid-deck in the case of the X-20X &quot;shuttle space vehicle&quot;. A Martin Marietta Transtage upper stage attached to the aft end of the craft would allow orbital maneuvers and a launch abort capability before being jettisoned before descent into the atmosphere. While falling through the atmosphere an opaque heat shield made from a refractory metal would protect the window at the front of the craft. This heat shield would then be jettisoned after aerobraking so the pilot could see, and safely land.

A drawing in the &quot;Space/Aeronautics&quot; magazine from before the project&#x27;s cancellation depicts the craft skimming the atmosphere for an orbital inclination change. It would then fire its rocket to resume orbit. This would be a unique ability for a spacecraft, as the laws of celestial mechanics ordinarily mean a change of plane requires an enormous expenditure of energy. The Dyna-Soar was projected to be able to use this capability to rendezvous with satellites even if the target conducted evasive maneuvers.

Unlike the later Space Shuttle, Dyna-Soar did not have wheels on its tricycle undercarriage, as rubber tires would have caught fire during re-entry. Instead Goodyear developed retractable wire-brush skids made of the same René 41 alloy as the airframe.

==Operational history==
In April 1960, seven astronauts were secretly chosen for the Dyna-Soar program:
* Neil Armstrong (1930–2012; NASA) 1960–1962
* William H. &quot;Bill&quot; Dana (1930–2014; NASA) 1960–1962
* Henry C. Gordon (1925–1996; Air Force) 1960–1963
* Pete Knight (1929–2004; Air Force) 1960–1963
* Russell L. Rogers (1928–1967; Air Force) 1960–1963
* Milt Thompson (1926–1993; NASA) 1960–1963
* James W. Wood (1924–1990; Air Force) 1960–1963

Neil Armstrong and Bill Dana left the program in mid-1962. On September 19, 1962, Albert Crews was added to the Dyna-Soar program and the names of the six remaining Dyna-Soar astronauts were announced to the public.

By the end of 1962, Dyna-Soar had been designated X-20, the booster (to be used in the Dyna Soar I drop-tests) successfully fired, and the USAF had held an unveiling ceremony for the X-20 in Las Vegas.

The Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Company (later the Honeywell Corporation) completed flight tests on an inertial guidance sub-system for the X-20 project at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, utilizing an NF-101B Voodoo by August 1963.

Boeing B-52C-40-BO Stratofortress &quot;53-0399&quot; was assigned to the program for air-dropping the X-20, similar to the X-15 launch profile. When the X-20 was cancelled, it was used for other air-drop tests including that of the B-1A escape capsule.

===Problems===
Besides the funding issues that often accompany research efforts, the Dyna-Soar program suffered from two major problems: uncertainty over the booster to be used to send the craft into orbit, and a lack of a clear goal for the project.

Many different boosters were proposed to launch Dyna-Soar into orbit.

The original USAF proposal suggested LOX/JP-4, fluorine-ammonia, fluorine-hydrazine, or RMI (X-15) engines, but Boeing, the principal contractor, favored an Atlas-Centaur combination. Eventually, in November 1959, the Air Force stipulated a Titan, as suggested by failed competitor Martin, but the Titan I was not powerful enough to launch the five-ton X-20 into orbit.

The Titan II and Titan III boosters could launch Dyna-Soar into Earth orbit, as could the Saturn C-1 (later renamed the Saturn I), and all were proposed with various upper-stage and booster combinations. In December 1961, the Titan IIIC was chosen,) but the vacillations over the launch system delayed the project and complicated planning.

The original intention for Dyna-Soar, outlined in the Weapons System 464L proposal, called for a project combining aeronautical research with weapons system development. Many questioned whether the USAF should have a crewed space program, when that was the primary domain of NASA. It was frequently emphasized by the Air Force that, unlike the NASA programs, Dyna-Soar allowed for controlled re-entry, and this was where the main effort in the X-20 program was placed.

On January 19, 1963, the Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, directed the U.S. Air Force to undertake a study to determine whether Gemini or Dyna-Soar was the more feasible approach to a space-based weapon system. In the middle of March 1963, after receiving the study, Secretary McNamara &quot;stated that the Air Force had been placing too much emphasis on controlled re-entry when it did not have any real objectives for orbital flight&quot;. This was seen as a reversal of the Secretary&#x27;s earlier position on the Dyna-Soar program.

Dyna-Soar was also an expensive program that would not launch a crewed mission until the mid-1960s at the earliest. This high cost and questionable utility made it difficult for the U.S. Air Force to justify the program.

Eventually, the X-20 Dyna-Soar program was canceled on December 10, 1963. On the day that X-20 was canceled, the U.S. Air Force announced another program, the Manned Orbiting Laboratory, a spin-off of Gemini. This program was also eventually canceled.

Another black program, ISINGLASS, which was to be air-launched from a B-52 bomber, was evaluated and some engine work done, but was eventually cancelled as well.

===Legacy===
Despite cancellation of the X-20, the affiliated research on spaceplanes influenced the much larger Space Shuttle. The final design also used delta wings for controlled landings. The later, and much smaller Soviet BOR-4 was closer in design philosophy to the Dyna-Soar, while NASA&#x27;s Martin X-23 PRIME and Martin Marietta X-24A/HL-10 research aircraft also explored aspects of sub-orbital and space flight. The ESA&#x27;s proposed Hermes crewed spacecraft was superficially similar to but not derived from the X-20.

== Media ==
* The 1959 &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; season 1 episode titled &quot;And When the Sky Was Opened&quot; made reference to a spacecraft called the X20 which had a similar profile but could carry a crew of three.
* In 1962, the fifth book in Donald A. Wollheim&#x27;s &quot;Mike Mars&quot; series, &quot;Mike Mars flies the Dyna-Soar&quot;, had the title character fly an emergency rescue mission in the Dyna-Soar. 
* John Berryman&#x27;s 1963 short story &quot;The Trouble with Telstar&quot; featured a Dyna-Soar being used to intercept communications satellites for repair.
* The 1969 Hollywood film drama &quot;Marooned&quot; featured a rescue craft modeled somewhat after the Dyna-Soar (called the X-RV for eXperimental Rescue Vehicle) being hurriedly deployed to rescue astronauts aboard a crippled Apollo command capsule. This was lampooned in &quot;Mad Magazine&quot; as the XRT, the Experimental Rescue Thing.

<doc id="479998" wikidata="Q218452" url="?curid=479998" title="26th of July Movement">
<text>The 26 July Movement (; M-26-7) was a Cuban vanguard revolutionary organization and later a political party led by Fidel Castro. The movement&#x27;s name commemorates the failed 1953 attack on the Moncada Barracks in Santiago de Cuba, part of an attempt to overthrow the dictator Fulgencio Batista.

M-26-7 is considered the leading organization of the Cuban Revolution. At the end of 1956, Castro established a guerrilla base in the Sierra Maestra. This base defeated the troops of Batista on 31 December 1958, setting into motion the Cuban Revolution and installing a government led by Manuel Urrutia Lleó. The Movement fought the Batista regime on both rural and urban fronts. The movement&#x27;s main objectives were distribution of land to peasants, nationalization of public services, industrialization, honest elections, and large-scale education reform.

In July 1961, the 26th of July Movement was one of the parties that integrated into the Integrated Revolutionary Organization (ORI) as well as the Popular Socialist Party (PSP) and the 13 March Revolutionary Directorate. On 26 March 1962, the party dissolved to form the United Party of the Cuban Socialist Revolution (PURSC), which held a communist ideology.  

==Origins==
The 26th of July Movement&#x27;s name originated from the failed attack on the Moncada Barracks, an army facility in the city of Santiago de Cuba, on 26 July 1953. This attack was led by a young Fidel Castro, who was a legislative candidate in a free election that had been cancelled by Batista. The attack had been intended as a rallying cry for the revolution.

Castro was captured and sentenced to 15 years in prison but, along with his group, was granted an amnesty after two years following a political campaign on their behalf. Castro traveled to Mexico to reorganize the movement in 1955 with several other exiled revolutionaries (including Raúl Castro, Camilo Cienfuegos, and Juan Almeida Bosque). Their task was to form a disciplined guerrilla force to overthrow Batista.

The original core of the group was organized around the attack on the Moncada Barracks, merged with the National Revolutionary Movement led by Rafael García Bárcena and with a majority of the Orthodox Youth. Soon after, National Revolutionary Action led by Frank País would join. Because of the commonality in their ideology and their goal of wanting to topple the Batista regime, the M-26-7 would quickly add more young people from diverse political backgrounds. Castro sought to frame the Movement as a direct continuation of the anti-colonial struggle of the Ten Years&#x27; War and the War of Independence.

==Role in the Cuban Revolution==
On 2 December 1956, 82 men landed in Cuba, having sailed in the boat &quot;Granma&quot; from Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico ready to organize and lead a revolution. The early signs were not good for the movement. They landed in daylight, were attacked by the Cuban Air Force and suffered numerous casualties. The landing party was split into two and wandered lost for two days, most of their supplies abandoned where they landed. They were also betrayed by their peasant guide in an ambush, which killed more of those who had landed. Batista mistakenly announced Fidel Castro&#x27;s death at this point. Of the 82 who sailed aboard the &quot;Granma,&quot; only 22 eventually regrouped in the Sierra Maestra mountain range.

While the revolutionaries were setting up camp in the mountains, &quot;Civic Resistance&quot; groups were forming in the cities, putting pressure on the Batista regime. The poor and many middle-class and professional persons flocked toward Castro and his movement being tired of the corruption of Batista and his government. While in the Sierra Maestra mountains, the guerrilla forces attracted hundreds of Cuban volunteers and won several battles against the Cuban Army. Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara was shot in the neck and chest during the fighting but was not severely injured. (Guevara, who had studied medicine, continued to give first aid to other wounded guerrillas.) This was the opening phase of the war of the Cuban Revolution, which continued for the next two years. It ended in January 1959, after the right-wing Dictator Batista fled Cuba for the Dominican Republic, in the early hours of New Year&#x27;s Day when the Movement&#x27;s forces marched into Havana.

== Political and military action ==
The guerrillas increased their ranks to 400 men in February 1958. In comparison, the forces of Batista reached 50,000 men, but only 10,000 were able to be used at once to confront the guerrillas. Batista launched an offensive of 10,000 with air and land support to encircle and destroy the guerrillas hidden in the Sierra between April and August 1958, this campaign ended in a decisive failure for the development of the conflict. Finally, after two years of war, the rebels defeated the Batista forces, causing them to flee to the Dominican Republic and take power 1 January 1959. At that time, they added around 20,000 to 30,000 guerrillas and the war had cost the lives of between 1,000 and 2,500 people.

Sabotage and the dissemination of propaganda were key parts of the M-26-7&#x27;s strategy in both the urban and rural theaters of operation and were used to generate an atmosphere of crisis and to destabilize the public and economic order of the Batista regime. In the countryside, guerrillas burned sugar cane fields and oil refineries, blocked bridges and trains, and attacked Batista&#x27;s soldiers, while in the cities, M-26-7 members cut telephone lines, coordinated strikes, kidnapped public figures, bombed government buildings, and assassinated government officials. The M-26-7 ran its propaganda operations to portray the violence of its actions in a positive light, and notable propaganda efforts included the broadcasting of Radio Rebelde beginning on 24 February 1958 and the invitation of foreign journalists and reporters, such as &quot;New York Times&quot; war correspondent Herbert Matthews and U.S. military intelligence agent Andrew St. George. Both domestic and international propaganda efforts were aimed at informing audiences of the goals and policies of the M-26-7 and glorifying the lives and exploits of the guerrilla fighters to generate sympathy for the movement.

== Rural activities ==
The M-26-7 divided its operations between the rural guerrillas, who were based in the Sierra Maestra mountains, and the urban underground, which consisted mostly of middle-class and professional Cubans living in towns and cities. Castro focused his efforts in the rural countryside on fighting Batista&#x27;s soldiers and liberating and governing increasing amounts of territory taken from Batista&#x27;s control. The M-26-7 incorporated large numbers of peasant men and women into the ranks of the M-26-7 where they served as soldiers, collaborators, and informants to fight Batista&#x27;s regime. Many peasant leaders were also affiliated with the PSP and used their connections with Communist Party members and sympathizers to recruit support for the M-26-7. Most notably, the Campesino Association, which had been an active Communist organization since 1934, allowed the M-26-7 to access and build on the network of peasant political organizing. The leaders of the Authentic Party (PA) and Orthodox Party and their constituents of small, medium, and wealthy landowners supported M-26-7 as well through funding and protection from Batista&#x27;s forces, although Castro&#x27;s platform of agrarian reform would lead to the eventual break between wealthy farmers and landowners and M-26-7.

As they occupied increasing large parts of the rural countryside, the M-26-7 provided public services to local peasants ranging from elementary schooling and literacy education, setting up hospitals and medical services, maintaining toll roads, providing protection from bandits, and enacting laws and decrees. In return, the M-26-7 taxed the peasants under its control and enforced prison sentences and fines against those convicted of tax evasion as well as other crimes including banditry, the cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana, and cockfighting. Castro created bureaucratic organizations to administer the rebel-controlled territories including the Administración Civil para los Territorios Liberados (ACTL) in September 1958, which was active in the Sierra Maestra, and the Agrarian Bureau, which was created on 3 August 1958 to oversee the Oriente province.

== Urban activities ==
In 1955, Castro designated Frank País as chief of action of the Oriente province after País merged his organization, Oriente Revolutionary Action (ARO), with the M-26-7. As the head of the M-26-7&#x27;s urban underground, País centralized its operations under a core leadership known as the National Directorate and moved the M-26-7&#x27;s headquarters from Havana to Santiago. He also created six separate sections of the M-26-7 which were responsible for organization, labor outreach, civic resistance among the middle class, sabotage activities and an urban militia, propaganda, and a treasury to raise funds. País attempted to support Castro&#x27;s landing from the &quot;Granma&quot; with a failed armed uprising in Santiago on 30 November 1956, and after Castro and the surviving guerrillas regrouped in the Sierra Maestra, the guerrillas depended on their urban counterparts for medicines, weapons, ammunition, food, equipment, clothing, money, propaganda production, and domestic and international publicity. In addition, the urban underground organized worker strikes as well as patriotic clubs for Cuban exiles in the United States, which provided funds for the purchasing of arms and ammunition. The M-26-7 frequently coordinated its actions with other urban-based anti-Batista groups such as the PSP, the Student Revolutionary Directorate (DRE), and the Organización Auténtica (OA), but by May 1957, the arrests and killings of large numbers of the DRE and the OA and the history of the PSP&#x27;s collaboration with the Batista regime led the M-26-7 to be the dominant anti-Batista force in the cities.

Frank País&#x27;s assassination by Santiago police in July 1957 prompted mass demonstrations and worker strikes in the city that quickly spread across the island, leading to a nationwide general strike on 5 August 1957. Though the strike saw limited success, the M-26-7 believed that the speed at which the strike spread and its popularity meant that a future nationwide strike could destabilize Batista&#x27;s regime enough to lead to his overthrow. However, a subsequent national strike held on 9 April 1958 ended up being a failure for the M-26-7 due to the preparedness of Batista&#x27;s forces for such an event and poor communication between the M-26-7 and labor groups as to the time of the strike. Many M-26-7 members were also killed in firefights with the police and army as they tried to stage an armed uprising during the chaos.

==Post-1959==
After the takeover, anti-Batistas, liberals, urban workers, peasants, and idealists became the dominant followers of the M-26-7 movement, which gained control over Cuba. The Movement was joined with other bodies to form the United Party of the Cuban Socialist Revolution, which in turn became the Communist Party of Cuba in 1965. Cuba modeled itself after the Eastern European nations that made up the Warsaw Pact, becoming the first socialistic government in the Americas. Once it was learned that Cuba would adopt a strict Marxist–Leninist political and economic system, opposition was raised not only by dissident party members, but by the United States as well. Fidel Castro&#x27;s government seized private land, nationalized hundreds of private companies—including several local subsidiaries of U.S. corporations—and taxed American products so heavily that U.S. exports were cut half in just two years. The Eisenhower Administration then imposed trade restrictions on everything except food and medical supplies. As a result, Cuba turned to the Soviet Union for trade instead. The US responded by cutting all diplomatic ties to Cuba and has had a rocky relationship with the country ever since. In April 1961, a CIA-trained force of Cuban exiles and dissidents, including former supporters of the M-26-7, launched the unsuccessful Bay of Pigs Invasion against Cuba, shortly after Castro had declared the revolution socialist. After the invasion, Castro formally proclaimed himself a communist.

Despite the support that the M-26-7 received from many Catholic students and priests during the fight against Batista, the movement&#x27;s victory in 1959 created a split between the M-26-7 and Catholic Church, which resisted the agrarian reform program and what members of the Church saw as Castro&#x27;s turn to Soviet Communism. Following the National Catholic Congress&#x27;s protest against the lack of Catholic values in the policies of the M-26-7 and a riot on 17 July 1959 in front of the Cathedral of Havana involving representatives of the Catholic Church and pro-Castro protestors, Castro publicly denounced the leadership of the Roman Catholic church on 12 August. On 6 January 1960, M-26-7 militants then occupied Catholic seminaries, churches, and schools across Cuba and arrested the leaders of the Young Catholic Workers (JOC). After the Bay of Pigs invasion, the M-26-7 closed more churches and detained a number of priests and bishops on 17 April 1961, and the Catholic Church was expelled from Cuba on 1 May in the wake of the nationalization of all private colleges and the expulsion of foreign priests from the island.

== Legacy ==
During the struggle against Batista, the M-26-7 portrayed itself as a unifying movement for all Cubans that would bring about democracy and social justice after Batista&#x27;s overthrow, particularly for women and the Afro-Cuban minority. Despite only making up 10% of the Cuban workforce, women disproportionately participated in the M-26-7 during the Revolution in a number of capacities that included the manufacturing of propaganda and demonstrations and picketing. In addition, the Mariana Grajales was established in September 1958 as an all-female military unit in the M-26-7. After the Revolution, the revolutionary government, controlled by the M-26-7, established the Federation of Cuban Women (FMC) to integrate women into Cuban political, social, and economic life and to eradicate prostitution. Castro and the M-26-7 also emphasized racial integration as a key platform of the movement, and after Batista&#x27;s overthrow, the M-26-7 quickly desegregated public spaces and implemented reforms, such as the redistribution of land and improved government education and medical services, that disproportionately benefited the Afro-Cuban population. However, the M-26-7&#x27;s racial policies have been criticized for repressing black political organization and for emphasizing pre-Revolution rhetoric that devalues racial consciousness and asserts that racism in Cuba has been ended by the Revolution despite the lingering presence of prejudiced and discriminatory attitudes on the island.

Since 1959, 26 July has been celebrated as a national holiday in Cuba. Celebrations involving community mobilizations and programs, reenactments, and recitations occur on the local and national level each year to honor the Moncada Barracks attack and the role of the M-26-7 in overthrowing the Batista regime. From 1967 to 1973, three museums were also opened in Santiago, Villa Blanca, and Moncada to commemorate the Moncada Barracks assault and the actions of the M-26-7.

The flag of the 26th of July Movement is on the shoulder of the Cuban military uniform and continues to be used as a symbol of the Cuban Revolution.

<doc id="479999" wikidata="Q7887789" url="?curid=479999" title="United Front (India, 1996)">
<text>The United Front was a coalition government of 13 political parties formed in India after the 1996 general elections. It formed two governments in India between 1996 and 1998. N. Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party served as the convener of United Front. The United Front was headquartered at the Andhra Pradesh Bhavan in New Delhi. During its tenure, the government was led by two prime ministers belonging to the Janata Dal – H. D. Deve Gowda and I. K. Gujral

==Background==
The Indian general election in 1996 returned a fractured verdict. With the Bharatiya Janata Party emerging as the largest party with 161 of 543 seats, it was invited first to form a government. It accepted the offer, and Atal Bihari Vajpayee was sworn in as the prime minister. However, he was unable to get a majority in parliament, and the government dissolved 13 days later. At a meeting of all the other parties, the Indian National Congress, with a substantial 140 seats, declined to head the government and agreed to extend outside support to the coalition, whereas the Communist Party of India (Marxist) agreed to join the coalition with the Janata Dal at its head, named the United Front.

With the approval of the Congress and CPI(M), the sitting chief minister of Karnataka, H. D. Deve Gowda, was asked to head the coalition as Prime Minister after V. P. Singh and Jyoti Basu declined. His term was from 1 June 1996 to 21 April 1997. The Congress revoked its support for Gowda amidst discontent over communication between the coalition and the Congress. It compromised to support a new government under I. K. Gujral, who served as the prime minister from 21 April 1997 to 19 March 1998. Following the collapse of his government, fresh elections were called, and the United Front lost power. Later, when N. Chandrababu Naidu stepped down as convener of the United Front to extend outside support to the National Democratic Alliance, the coalition disbanded.

<doc id="480005" wikidata="Q1245589" url="?curid=480005" title="The Mandrake">
<text>The Mandrake (Italian: &quot;La Mandragola&quot; ) is a satirical play by Italian Renaissance philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli. Although the five-act comedy was published in 1524 and first performed in the carnival season of 1526, Machiavelli likely wrote &quot;The Mandrake&quot; in 1518 as a distraction from his bitterness at having been excluded from the diplomatic and political life of Florence following the 1512 reversion to Medici rule. Some scholars read the play as an overt critique of the House of Medici; and some scholars assert that the play is a mirror to his political treatises. However, Machiavelli set the action in 1504 during the period of the Florentine Republic in order to express his frustrations without fear of censure from patrons already ill-disposed towards him and his writing.

==Synopsis==
&quot;The Mandrake&quot; takes place over a 24-hour period. The protagonist, Callimaco, desires to sleep with Lucrezia, the young and beautiful wife of an elderly fool, Nicia. Nicia above all else desires a son and heir, but still has none. Conspiring with both Ligurio, a rascally marriage broker, and a corrupt priest named Friar Timoteo, Callimaco masquerades as a doctor. He convinces Nicia to drug Lucrezia with mandrake, claiming it will increase her fertility. He adds, however, the dire warning that the mandrake will undoubtedly kill the first man to have intercourse with her. Ligurio helpfully suggests to Nicia that an unwitting fool be found for this purpose. A reluctant Lucrezia is eventually convinced by her mother and the priest to comply with her husband&#x27;s wishes. She allows a disguised Callimaco into her bed and, believing that the events which caused her to break her marriage vows were due to divine providence, thereafter accepts him as her lover on a more permanent basis.

The play is mentioned in the 16th Letter of Amabed in Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Les Lettres d&#x27;Amabed&quot; (1769) stating that &quot;the piece mocks the religion which Europe preaches, of which Rome is the centre, and the throne of which is the Papal See&quot;. Other critics like John Najemy have interpreted scenes with the priest as Machiavelli pointing out &quot;the social and political necessity of interpreting religion&quot;.

==Modern revivals and adaptations==
===Revivals===
Wallace Shawn&#x27;s translation, commissioned by Joseph Papp, was staged in 1977 at the Public Theater in Manhattan, and it launched Shawn&#x27;s stage acting career as well. &quot;La Mandragola&quot; was performed in student-run theaters in the late 1960s.

The Riverside Shakespeare Company performed &quot;The Mandrake&quot; at the Casa Italiana in New York City in 1979, starring Tom Hanks as Callimaco. This run was directed by Dan Southern, with an original jazz score by pianist Michael Wolff, and Italian Renaissance sets by Gerard Bourcier.

The Mumeijuku Company performed &quot;La Mandragola, un Fiore Velenoso&quot; at the Sunshine Theater of Sunshine-City in Ikebukuro, Tokyo in 1981, starring Koji Yakusho as Callimaco and Tatsuya Nakadai as Nicia. This run was directed by Mrs. Kyoko Nakadai, a.k.a. Ms. Tomoe Ryu, who has won the National Arts Festival (sponsored by the Agency for Cultural Affairs Japan) Excellence Award for directing Henrik Johan Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Master Builder, Solness&quot; in 1980.

In 1984 Wallace Shawn&#x27;s translation &quot;The Mandrake&quot; was produced at London&#x27;s National Theatre.

The Long Beach Shakespeare Company mounted a production of &quot;The Mandragola&quot; in the Spring of 2011, directed by Helen Borgers.

===Musicals and operas===
&quot;La Mandragola&quot;, an opera by the composer Ignatz Waghalter, premiered at the Deutsches Opernhaus in Berlin in January 1914. The opera, richly melodic and deeply sympathetic in its treatment of human foibles, features a libretto by Paul Eger. It was warmly received by the critics, and was booked for a European tour that was aborted due to the outbreak of the First World War.

&quot;La Mandragola&quot;, an opera by Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco opus 20, composed 1920–23, premiered in Venice 1926.

Michael Alfreds and Anthony Bowles wrote a 1968 musical adaptation, &quot;Mandrake&quot;, which has been performed in Edinburgh, London, New York, and elsewhere.

Another musical adaptation, &quot;Mandragola&quot;, composed by Doug Riley with libretto by Alan Gordon, made its debut in Canada over CBC Radio in October 1977, and was later issued on the CBC label as an LP record.

Pulitzer prize winning American composer William Bolcom adapted the story in operetta form with a libretto by Marc Campbell. Titled &quot;Lucrezia,&quot; the 50-minute work was commissioned by New York Festival of Song and premiered in 2008 with two pianos and a cast of five. A fully orchestrated version premiered at San Francisco Conservatory of Music in 2018.

&quot;Mandragola&quot;, an opera in Serbian by composer Ivan Jevtic, book by Dejan Miladinovic and lyrics by Vesna Miladinovic after Machiavelli, was given its world premiere in Belgrade at the Madlenianum Theatre on 16 December 2009.

===Film===
In 1965 an Italian film version was made by writer/director Alberto Lattuada.

A 2008 film version was made, &quot;The Mandrake Root&quot;. Adapted and directed by Malachi Bogdanov, it was shot in Sassari, Sardinia. Produced by European Drama Network, it was made in English with limited Italian sections, and it remains close to the original story. It was nominated for Best Drama of 2008 by the Royal Television Society Awards Midlands.

<doc id="480010" wikidata="Q1182249" url="?curid=480010" title="Deduction theorem">
<text>In mathematical logic, a deduction theorem is a metatheorem that justifies doing conditional proofs from a hypothesis in systems that do not explicitly axiomatize that hypothesis, i.e. to prove an implication &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot;, it is sufficient to assume &quot;A&quot; as a hypothesis and then proceed to derive &quot;B&quot;. Deduction theorems exist for both propositional logic and first-order logic. The deduction theorem is an important tool in Hilbert-style deduction systems because it permits one to write more comprehensible and usually much shorter proofs than would be possible without it. In certain other formal proof systems the same conveniency is provided by an explicit inference rule; for example natural deduction calls it implication introduction.

In more detail, the propositional logic deduction theorem states that if a formula formula_1 is deducible from a set of assumptions formula_2 then the implication formula_3 is deducible from formula_4; in symbols, formula_5 implies formula_6. In the special case where formula_4 is the empty set, the deduction theorem claim can be more compactly written as: formula_8 implies formula_9. The deduction theorem for predicate logic is similar, but comes with some extra constraints (that would for example be satisfied if formula_10 is a closed formula). In general a deduction theorem needs to take into account all logical details of the theory under consideration, so each logical system technically needs its own deduction theorem, although the differences are usually minor.

The deduction theorem holds for all first-order theories with the usual deductive systems for first-order logic. However, there are first-order systems in which new inference rules are added for which the deduction theorem fails. Most notably, the deduction theorem fails to hold in Birkhoff–von Neumann quantum logic, because the linear subspaces of a Hilbert space form a non-distributive lattice.

==Examples of deduction==

#:**&quot;P&quot; 3. reiteration of 1

#:*&quot;P&quot;→(&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;P&quot;) 2. axiom 1
#:*&quot;R&quot; 3. modus ponens 2,1
#*((&quot;P&quot;→(&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;P&quot;))→&quot;R&quot;)→&quot;R&quot; 4. deduction from 1 to 3 QED

==Virtual rules of inference==

From the examples, one can see that we have added three virtual (or extra and temporary) rules of inference to our normal axiomatic logic. These are &quot;hypothesis&quot;, &quot;reiteration&quot;, and &quot;deduction&quot;. The normal rules of inference (i.e. &quot;modus ponens&quot; and the various axioms) remain available.

1. Hypothesis is a step where one adds an additional premise to those already available. So, if the previous step &quot;S&quot; was deduced as:
:formula_11

then one adds another premise &quot;H&quot; and gets:
:formula_12

This is symbolized by moving from the &quot;n&quot;-th level of indentation to the &quot;n&quot;+1-th level and saying 
::::*&quot;S&quot; previous step
::::**&quot;H&quot; hypothesis

2. Reiteration is a step where one re-uses a previous step. In practice, this is only necessary when one wants to take a hypothesis that is not the most recent hypothesis and use it as the final step before a deduction step.

3. Deduction is a step where one removes the most recent hypothesis (still available) and prefixes it to the previous step. This is shown by unindenting one level as follows:
:::::*&quot;H&quot; hypothesis
:::::*... (other steps)
:::::*&quot;C&quot; (conclusion drawn from &quot;H&quot;)
::::*&quot;H&quot;→&quot;C&quot; deduction

==Conversion from proof using the deduction meta-theorem to axiomatic proof==
In axiomatic versions of propositional logic, one usually has among the axiom schemas (where &quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, and &quot;R&quot; are replaced by any propositions):
*Axiom 1 is: &quot;P&quot;→(&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;P&quot;)
*Axiom 2 is: (&quot;P&quot;→(&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;))→((&quot;P&quot;→&quot;Q&quot;)→(&quot;P&quot;→&quot;R&quot;))
*Modus ponens is: from &quot;P&quot; and &quot;P&quot;→&quot;Q&quot; infer &quot;Q&quot;

These axiom schemas are chosen to enable one to derive the deduction theorem from them easily. So it might seem that we are begging the question. However, they can be justified by checking that they are tautologies using truth tables and that modus ponens preserves truth.

From these axiom schemas one can quickly deduce the theorem schema &quot;P&quot;→&quot;P&quot; (reflexivity of implication), which is used below:
# (&quot;P&quot;→((&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;P&quot;)→&quot;P&quot;))→((&quot;P&quot;→(&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;P&quot;))→(&quot;P&quot;→&quot;P&quot;)) from axiom schema 2 with &quot;P&quot;, (&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;P&quot;), &quot;P&quot;
# &quot;P&quot;→((&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;P&quot;)→&quot;P&quot;) from axiom schema 1 with &quot;P&quot;, (&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;P&quot;)
# (&quot;P&quot;→(&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;P&quot;))→(&quot;P&quot;→&quot;P&quot;) from modus ponens applied to step 2 and step 1
# &quot;P&quot;→(&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;P&quot;) from axiom schema 1 with &quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;
# &quot;P&quot;→&quot;P&quot; from modus ponens applied to step 4 and step 3

Suppose that we have that Γ and &quot;H&quot; together prove &quot;C&quot;, and we wish to show that Γ proves &quot;H&quot;→&quot;C&quot;. For each step &quot;S&quot; in the deduction that is a premise in Γ (a reiteration step) or an axiom, we can apply modus ponens to the axiom 1, &quot;S&quot;→(&quot;H&quot;→&quot;S&quot;), to get &quot;H&quot;→&quot;S&quot;. If the step is &quot;H&quot; itself (a hypothesis step), we apply the theorem schema to get &quot;H&quot;→&quot;H&quot;. If the step is the result of applying modus ponens to &quot;A&quot; and &quot;A&quot;→&quot;S&quot;, we first make sure that these have been converted to &quot;H&quot;→&quot;A&quot; and &quot;H&quot;→(&quot;A&quot;→&quot;S&quot;) and then we take the axiom 2, (&quot;H&quot;→(&quot;A&quot;→&quot;S&quot;))→((&quot;H&quot;→&quot;A&quot;)→(&quot;H&quot;→&quot;S&quot;)), and apply modus ponens to get (&quot;H&quot;→&quot;A&quot;)→(&quot;H&quot;→&quot;S&quot;) and then again to get &quot;H&quot;→&quot;S&quot;. At the end of the proof we will have &quot;H&quot;→&quot;C&quot; as required, except that now it only depends on Γ, not on &quot;H&quot;. So the deduction step will disappear, consolidated into the previous step which was the conclusion derived from &quot;H&quot;.

To minimize the complexity of the resulting proof, some preprocessing should be done before the conversion. Any steps (other than the conclusion) that do not actually depend on &quot;H&quot; should be moved up before the hypothesis step and unindented one level. And any other unnecessary steps (which are not used to get the conclusion or can be bypassed), such as reiterations that are not the conclusion, should be eliminated.

During the conversion, it may be useful to put all the applications of modus ponens to axiom 1 at the beginning of the deduction (right after the &quot;H&quot;→&quot;H&quot; step).

When converting a modus ponens, if &quot;A&quot; is outside the scope of &quot;H&quot;, then it will be necessary to apply axiom 1, &quot;A&quot;→(&quot;H&quot;→&quot;A&quot;), and modus ponens to get &quot;H&quot;→&quot;A&quot;. Similarly, if &quot;A&quot;→&quot;S&quot; is outside the scope of &quot;H&quot;, apply axiom 1, (&quot;A&quot;→&quot;S&quot;)→(&quot;H&quot;→(&quot;A&quot;→&quot;S&quot;)), and modus ponens to get &quot;H&quot;→(&quot;A&quot;→&quot;S&quot;). It should not be necessary to do both of these, unless the modus ponens step is the conclusion, because if both are outside the scope, then the modus ponens should have been moved up before &quot;H&quot; and thus be outside the scope also.

Under the Curry–Howard correspondence, the above conversion process for the deduction meta-theorem is analogous to the conversion process from lambda calculus terms to terms of combinatory logic, where axiom 1 corresponds to the K combinator, and axiom 2 corresponds to the S combinator. Note that the I combinator corresponds to the theorem schema &quot;P&quot;→&quot;P&quot;.

== Helpful theorems ==
If one intends to convert a complicated proof using the deduction theorem to a straight-line proof not using the deduction theorem, then it would probably be useful to prove these theorems once and for all at the beginning and then use them to help with the conversion:
:formula_13
helps convert the hypothesis steps.
:formula_14
helps convert modus ponens when the major premise is not dependent on the hypothesis, replaces axiom 2 while avoiding a use of axiom 1.
:formula_15
helps convert modus ponens when the minor premise is not dependent on the hypothesis, replaces axiom 2 while avoiding a use of axiom 1.

These two theorems jointly can be used in lieu of axiom 2, although the converted proof would be more complicated:
:formula_16
:formula_17

Peirce&#x27;s law is not a consequence of the deduction theorem, but it can be used with the deduction theorem to prove things that one might not otherwise be able to prove.
:formula_18
It can also be used to get the second of the two theorems, which can be used in lieu of axiom 2.

==Proof of the deduction theorem==

We prove the deduction theorem in a Hilbert-style deductive system of propositional calculus.

Let formula_4 be a set of formulas and formula_10 and formula_1 formulas, such that formula_5. We want to prove that formula_6.

Since formula_5, there is a proof of formula_1 from formula_2. We prove the theorem by induction on the proof length &quot;n&quot;; thus the induction hypothesis is that for any formula_27, formula_10 and formula_1 such that there is a proof of formula_1 from formula_2 of length up to &quot;n&quot;, formula_6 holds.

If &quot;n&quot; = 1 then formula_1 is member of the set of formulas formula_2. Thus either formula_35, in which case formula_36 is simply formula_37, which is derivable by substitution from &quot;p&quot; → &quot;p&quot;, which is derivable from the axioms, and hence also formula_6, or formula_1 is in formula_27, in which case formula_41; it follows from axiom &quot;p&quot; → (&quot;q&quot; → &quot;p&quot;) with substitution that formula_42 and hence by modus ponens that formula_6.

Now let us assume the induction hypothesis for proofs of length up to &quot;n&quot;, and let formula_1 be a formula provable from formula_2 with a proof of length &quot;n&quot;+1. Then there are two possibilities:

#formula_1 is member of the set of formulas formula_2; in this case we proceed as for &quot;n&quot;=1.
#formula_1 is arrived at by using modus ponens. Then there is a formula &quot;C&quot; such that formula_2 proves formula_50 and formula_51, and modus ponens is then used to prove formula_1. The proofs of formula_50 and formula_51 are with at most &quot;n&quot; steps, and by the induction hypothesis we have formula_55 and formula_56. By the axiom (&quot;p&quot; → (&quot;q&quot; → &quot;r&quot;)) → ((&quot;p&quot; → &quot;q&quot;) → (&quot;p&quot; → &quot;r&quot;)) with substitution it follows that formula_57, and by using modus ponens twice we have formula_6.

Thus in all cases the theorem holds also for &quot;n&quot;+1, and by induction the deduction theorem is proven.

==The deduction theorem in predicate logic==
The deduction theorem is also valid in first-order logic in the following form:

*If &quot;T&quot; is a theory and &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot; are formulas with &quot;F&quot; closed, and formula_59, then formula_60.

Here, the symbol formula_61 means &quot;is a syntactical consequence of.&quot; We indicate below how the proof of this deduction theorem differs from that of the deduction theorem in propositional calculus.

In the most common versions of the notion of formal proof, there are, in addition to the axiom schemes
of propositional calculus (or the understanding that all tautologies of propositional calculus are to
be taken as axiom schemes in their own right), quantifier axioms, and in addition to modus ponens, one additional rule of inference, known as the rule of &quot;generalization&quot;: &quot;From &quot;K&quot;, infer ∀&quot;vK&quot;.&quot;

In order to convert a proof of &quot;G&quot; from &quot;T&quot;∪{&quot;F&quot;} to one of &quot;F&quot;→&quot;G&quot; from &quot;T&quot;, one deals 
with steps of the proof of &quot;G&quot; that are axioms or result from application of modus ponens in the 
same way as for proofs in propositional logic. Steps that result from application of the rule of
generalization are dealt with via the following quantifier axiom (valid whenever the variable
&quot;v&quot; is not free in formula &quot;H&quot;):

*(∀&quot;v&quot;(&quot;H&quot;→&quot;K&quot;))→(&quot;H&quot;→∀&quot;vK&quot;).

Since in our case &quot;F&quot; is assumed to be closed, we can take &quot;H&quot; to be &quot;F&quot;. This axiom allows
one to deduce &quot;F&quot;→∀&quot;vK&quot; from &quot;F&quot;→&quot;K&quot; and generalization, which is just what is needed whenever
the rule of generalization is applied to some &quot;K&quot; in the proof of &quot;G&quot;.

In first-order logic, the restriction of that F be a closed formula can be relaxed given that the free variables in F has not been varied in the deduction of G from formula_62. In the case that a free variable v in F has been varied in the deduction, we write formula_63 (the superscript in the turnstile indicating that v has been varied) and the corresponding form of the deduction theorem is formula_64.

==Example of conversion==
To illustrate how one can convert a natural deduction to the axiomatic form of proof, we apply it to the tautology &quot;Q&quot;→((&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→&quot;R&quot;). In practice, it is usually enough to know that we could do this. We normally use the natural-deductive form in place of the much longer axiomatic proof.

First, we write a proof using a natural-deduction like method:
:*&quot;Q&quot; 1. hypothesis
:**&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot; 2. hypothesis
:**&quot;R&quot; 3. modus ponens 1,2
:*(&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→&quot;R&quot; 4. deduction from 2 to 3
*&quot;Q&quot;→((&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→&quot;R&quot;) 5. deduction from 1 to 4 QED

Second, we convert the inner deduction to an axiomatic proof:
*(&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→(&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;) 1. theorem schema (&quot;A&quot;→&quot;A&quot;)
*((&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→(&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;))→(((&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→&quot;Q&quot;)→((&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→&quot;R&quot;)) 2. axiom 2
*((&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→&quot;Q&quot;)→((&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→&quot;R&quot;) 3. modus ponens 1,2
*&quot;Q&quot;→((&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→&quot;Q&quot;) 4. axiom 1
**&quot;Q&quot; 5. hypothesis
**(&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→&quot;Q&quot; 6. modus ponens 5,4
**(&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→&quot;R&quot; 7. modus ponens 6,3
*&quot;Q&quot;→((&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→&quot;R&quot;) 8. deduction from 5 to 7 QED

Third, we convert the outer deduction to an axiomatic proof:
*(&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→(&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;) 1. theorem schema (&quot;A&quot;→&quot;A&quot;)
*((&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→(&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;))→(((&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→&quot;Q&quot;)→((&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→&quot;R&quot;)) 2. axiom 2
*((&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→&quot;Q&quot;)→((&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→&quot;R&quot;) 3. modus ponens 1,2
*&quot;Q&quot;→((&quot;Q&quot;→&quot;R&quot;)→&quot;Q&quot;) 4. axiom 1

<text>Alexander Ivanovich Herzen (; ) was a Russian writer and thinker known as the precursor of Russian socialism and one of the main precursors of agrarian populism (being an ideological ancestor of the Narodniki, Socialist-Revolutionaries, Trudoviks and the agrarian American Populist Party). With his writings, many composed while exiled in London, he attempted to influence the situation in Russia, contributing to a political climate that led to the emancipation of the serfs in 1861. He published the important social novel &quot;Who is to Blame?&quot; (1845–46). His autobiography, &quot;My Past and Thoughts&quot; (written 1852–1870), is often considered one of the best examples of that genre in Russian literature.

==Life==
Herzen (or Gertsen) was an illegitimate son of a rich Russian landowner, Ivan Yakovlev, and Henriette Wilhelmina Luisa Haag from Stuttgart. Yakovlev gave his son the surname Herzen because he was a &quot;child of his heart&quot; (German &quot;Herz&quot;).

He was first cousin to Count Sergei Lvovich Levitsky, considered the patriarch of Russian photography and one of Europe&#x27;s most important early photographic pioneers, inventors and innovators. In 1860, Levitsky would immortalize Herzen in a famous photograph.

Herzen was born in Moscow, shortly before Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia and brief occupation of the city. His father, after a personal interview with Napoleon, was allowed to leave Moscow after agreeing to bear a letter from the French to the Russian emperor in St. Petersburg. His family accompanied him to the Russian lines.

A year later, the family returned to Moscow and stayed there until after Herzen had completed his studies at Moscow University. In 1834, Herzen and his lifelong friend Nikolay Ogarev were arrested and tried for attending a festival where verses by Sokolovsky, that were uncomplimentary to the tsar, were sung. He was found guilty, and in 1835 banished to Vyatka, now Kirov, in north-eastern European Russia. He remained there until 1837, when the tsar&#x27;s son, Grand Duke Alexander (who later became become tsar Alexander II), accompanied by the poet Zhukovsky, visited the city and intervened on his behalf. Herzen was allowed to leave Vyatka for Vladimir, where he was appointed editor of the city&#x27;s official gazette. In 1837, he eloped with his cousin Natalya Zakharina, secretly marrying her.

In 1839 he was set free and returned to Moscow in 1840, where he met literary critic Vissarion Belinsky, who was strongly influenced by him. Upon arrival, he was appointed as secretary to Count Alexander Stroganov in the ministry of the interior at St Petersburg; but due to complaining about a death caused by a police officer, was sent to Novgorod where he was a state councillor until 1842. In 1846, his father died, leaving him a large inheritance.

In 1847, Alexandr emigrated with his wife, mother and children, to Italy never to return to Russia. From Italy, on hearing of the revolution of 1848, he hastened to Paris and then to Switzerland. He supported the revolutions of 1848, but was bitterly disillusioned with European socialist movements after their failure. Herzen gained his reputation as a political writer. His assets in Russia were frozen due to his emigration, but Baron Rothschild, with whom his family had a business relationship, negotiated the release of the assets, which were nominally transferred to Rothschild.

Alexandr and his wife Natalia had four children together. His mother and one of his sons died in a shipwreck in 1851. His wife carried on an affair with the German poet Georg Herwegh. In 1852 Natalia died from tuberculosis and Alexandr left Geneva for London, where he settled for many years. He hired Malwida von Meysenbug to educate his daughters. With the publications of his Free Russian Press, which he founded in London in 1853, he tried to influence the situation in Russia and improve the situation of the Russian peasantry he idolized.

In 1856 he was joined in London by his old friend Nikolay Ogarev. They worked together on their Russian periodical &quot;Kolokol&quot; (&quot;Bell&quot;). Soon Alexandr began an affair with Natalia Tuchkova, Ogarev&#x27;s wife, daughter of the war hero general Tuchkov. Tuchkova and Alexandr had three children. Ogarev found a new wife and the friendship between Herzen and Ogarev survived.

Herzen spent time in London organising with the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association, becoming well acquainted with revolutionary circles including the likes of Bakunin and Marx. It was during his time in London that Herzen began to make a name for himself for &quot;scandal-mongering&quot; when he told Bakunin, freshly arriving after having escaped imprisonment in Siberia, that Marx had accused him of being a Russian agent; in reality, the two were on very good terms.

In 1864, Herzen returned to Geneva and, after some time, went to Paris where he died in 1870 of tuberculosis complications. Originally buried in Paris, his remains were taken to Nice a month later.

== Political positions ==
Herzen promoted the ideas of Westernizer Vissarion Belinsky after his death in 1848. He was influenced by Voltaire, Schiller, Saint-Simon, Proudhon, and especially Hegel and Feuerbach. Herzen started as a liberal but increasingly adopted socialism. He left Russia permanently in 1847, but his newsletter &quot;Kolokol &quot; published in London from 1857 to 1867, was widely read. Herzen combined key ideas of the French Revolution and German idealism. He disliked bourgeois or middle-class values, and sought authenticity among the peasantry. He fought for the emancipation of the Russian serfs, and after that took place in 1861 he escalated his demands regarding constitutional rights, common ownership of land, and government by the people.

Herzen was disillusioned with the Revolutions of 1848 but not disillusioned with revolutionary thought. He became critical of those 1848 revolutionaries who were &quot;so revolted by the Reaction after 1848, so exasperated by everything European, that they hastened on to Kansas or California&quot;. Herzen had always admired the French Revolution and broadly adopted its values. In his early writings, he viewed the French Revolution as the end of history, the final stage in social development of a society based on humanism and harmony. Throughout his early life, Herzen saw himself as a revolutionary radical called to fight the political oppression of Nicholas I of Russia. Essentially, Herzen fought against the ruling elites in Europe, against Christian hypocrisy and for individual freedom and self-expression.

He promoted both socialism and individualism and argued that the full flowering of the individual could best be realized in a socialist order. However, he would always reject grand narratives such as a predestined position for a society to arrive at and his writings in exile promoted small-scale communal living with the protection of individual liberty by a non-interventionist government.

== Writings ==
His literary career began in 1842 with the publication of an essay, in Russian, on &quot;Dilettantism in Science&quot;, under the pseudonym of Iskander, the Turkish form of his Christian name. His second work, also in Russian, was his &quot;Letters on the Study of Nature&quot; (1845–46). In 1847 appeared his novel &quot;Who is to Blame?&quot; This is a story about how the domestic happiness of a young tutor, who marries the unacknowledged daughter of a Russian sensualist of the old type, dull, ignorant and genial, is troubled by a Russian sensualist of the new school, intelligent, accomplished, and callous, with there being no possibility of saying who is most to blame for the tragic ending.

Also in 1847 were published in Russian periodicals the stories which were afterwards collected and printed in London in 1854, under the title of &quot;Prervannye Razskazy&quot; (&quot;Interrupted Tales&quot;). In 1850 two works appeared, translated from the Russian manuscripts, &quot;From Another Shore&quot; and &quot;Lettres de France et d&#x27;Italie&quot;. In French also appeared his essay &quot;Du Developpement des idées revolutionnaires en Russie&quot;, and his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, which, after being printed in Russian, were translated under the title of &quot;Le Monde russe et la Révolution&quot; (3 vols., 1860–1862), and were in part translated into English as &quot;My Exile to Siberia&quot; (2 vols., 1855).

== Free Russian Press ==
Having founded in London in 1853 his Free Russian Press, the fortunes of which he gave an interesting account in a book published (in Russian) in 1863, he published a large number of Russian works, all against the system of government prevailing in Russia. Some of these were essays, such as his &quot;Baptized Property&quot; (1853), an attack on serfdom; others were periodical publications, the &quot;Polyarnaya Zvyezda&quot; (or &quot;Polar Star&quot;), the &quot;Kolokol&quot; (or &quot;Bell&quot;), and the &quot;Golosa iz Rossii&quot; (or &quot;Voices from Russia&quot;).

As the first independent Russian political publisher, Herzen began publishing &quot;The Polar Star&quot;, a review which appeared infrequently and was later joined by &quot;The Bell&quot;, a journal issued between 1857 and 1867 at Herzen&#x27;s personal expense. Both publications acquired great influence via an illegal circulation in Russian territory; it was said the Emperor himself read them. Both publications gave Herzen influence in Russia reporting from a liberal perspective about the incompetence of the Tsar and the Russian bureaucracy.

For its first three years, the Russian Free Press went on printing without selling a single copy and scarcely able to get a single copy into Russia; so when at last a bookseller bought 10 shillings worth of &quot;Baptized Property&quot;, the half-sovereign was set aside by the surprised editors in a special place of honor. The death of emperor Nicholas in 1855 led to a complete change. Herzen&#x27;s writings, and the magazines he edited, were smuggled wholesale into Russia, and their words resounded throughout the country, and all over Europe. Their influence grew.

The year 1855 gave Herzen reason to be optimistic; Alexander II had ascended the throne and reforms seemed possible. Herzen urged the Tsarist regime &#x27;Onward, onward&#x27; towards reform in &quot;The Polar Star&quot; in 1856. Writing in 1857 Herzen became excited by the possibility of social change under Alexander II, &quot;A new life is unmistakably boiling up in Russia, even the government is being carried away by it&quot;. &quot;The Bell&quot; broke the story that the government was considering serf emancipation in July 1857, adding that the government lacked the ability to resolve the issue. Yet by 1858, full serf emancipation had not been achieved and Herzen grew impatient with reform. By May 1858 &quot;The Bell&quot; restarted its campaign for the comprehensive emancipation of the serfs. Once the Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia was achieved, &quot;The Bell&quot;&#x27;s campaign changed to &#x27;Liberty and Land&#x27;, a program that tried to achieve further social change in support of serf rights. Alexander II granted serfs their freedom, the law courts were remodelled, trial by jury was established, and liberty was, to a great extent, conceded to the press.
== Contemporary reputation==
Herzen drew criticism from both liberals who opposed violence and from radicals who thought Herzen was too soft. Liberals led by Boris Chicherin and Konstantin Kavelin believed individual freedom would be achieved through the rationalisation of social relations. Their statist variety of liberalism was opposed by Herzen as it supposed that Russian society would evolve to an ideal state based on a Hegelian view of reason. They believed the revolutionaries would merely postpone the establishment of the ideal state, while Herzen thought that, on the contrary, they were blind to historical reality.

Russian radicals disliked Herzen as too moderate. Radicals such as Nikolai Chernyshevsky and Nikolay Dobrolyubov wanted more commitment to violent revolution and the withdrawal of any hope in the reformist Tsar. Radicals asked Herzen to use &quot;The Bell&quot; as a mouthpiece for violent radical revolution, but Herzen rejected these requests. He argued that the Russian Radicals were not united and strong enough to create successful political change, stating, &quot;You want happiness, I suppose? I dare say you do! Happiness has to be conquered. If you are strong, take it. If you are weak, hold your tongue&quot;. Herzen feared a new revolutionary government would merely replace the dictatorship with another dictatorship.

The radicals describe Herzen as a liberal for not wanting immediate change, but Herzen rejects their pleas arguing for change at a pace that will ensure success. Herzen briefly joined with other Russian liberals such as Kavelin to promote the peasant &#x27;awakening&#x27; in Russia. Herzen continued to use &quot;The Bell&quot; as an outlet to promote unity with all sections of the Russian society behind a demand for a national parliament.

However his hopes of acting as a uniting force were ended by the January Uprising of 1863/1864, when the liberal support for Tsarist revenge against the Poles ended Herzen&#x27;s link with them; Herzen had pleaded the insurgents&#x27; cause. This breach resulted in a declining readership for &quot;The Bell&quot;, which ceased publication in 1867. By his death in 1870, Herzen was almost forgotten.

== Influence in the 19th and 20th century ==

Herzen opposed the aristocracy that ruled 19th century Russia and supported an agrarian collectivist model of social structure. A rise in populism by 1880 led to a favourable re-evaluation of his writings. In Russia the distinctly western notion of &quot;progress&quot; was replaced by a conservative promise of modernization based on the incorporation of modern technology to serve the established system. The promise of modernization in the service of autocracy frightened Herzen who warned of a Russia governed by &quot;Genghis Khan with a telegraph.&quot;

Alongside populism, Herzen is also remembered for his rejection of corrupt government of any political persuasion and for his support for individual rights. A Hegelian in his youth, this translated into no specific theory or single doctrine dominating his thought. Herzen came to believe the complex questions of society could not be answered and that Russians must live for the moment and not a cause, essentially life is an end in itself. Herzen found greater understanding by not committing himself to an extreme but rather lived impartially enabling him to equally criticise competing ideologies. Herzen believed that grand doctrines ultimately result in enslavement, sacrifice and tyranny.

Tolstoy declared that he had never met another man &quot;with so rare a combination of scintillating brilliance and depth&quot;. Herzen was a hero of the 20th-century philosopher Isaiah Berlin. The words of Herzen that Berlin repeated most insistently were those condemning the sacrifice of human beings on the altar of abstractions, the subordination of the realities of individual happiness or unhappiness in the present to glorious dreams of the future. Berlin, like Herzen, believed that &quot;the end of life is life itself&quot; and that each life and each age should be regarded as its own end and not as a means to some future goal. Berlin called Herzen&#x27;s autobiography &quot;one of the great monuments to Russian literary and psychological genius, worthy to stand beside the great novels of ... Turgenev and Tolstoy.&quot;

&quot;Russian Thinkers&quot; (The Hogarth Press, 1978), a collection of Berlin&#x27;s essays in which Herzen features, was the inspiration for Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;The Coast of Utopia&quot;, a trilogy of plays performed at London&#x27;s National Theatre in 2002 and at New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center in 2006–2007. Set against the background of the early development of Russian socialist thought, the Revolutions of 1848 and later exile, the plays examine the lives and intellectual development of, among other Russians, the anarchist Mikhail Bakunin, the literary critic Vissarion Belinsky, the novelist Ivan Turgenev and Herzen, whose character dominates the plays.

<text>Traffic analysis is the process of intercepting and examining messages in order to deduce information from patterns in communication. It can be performed even when the messages are encrypted. In general, the greater the number of messages observed, the greater information be inferred. Traffic analysis can be performed in the context of military intelligence, counter-intelligence, or pattern-of-life analysis, and is also a concern in computer security.

Traffic analysis tasks may be supported by dedicated computer software programs. Advanced traffic analysis techniques which may include various forms of social network analysis.

Traffic analysis has historically been a vital technique in cryptanalysis, especially when the attempted crack depends on successfully seeding a known-plaintext attack, which often requires an inspired guess based on how specific the operational context might likely influence what an adversary communicates, which may be sufficient to establish a short crib.

== Breaking the anonymity of networks ==
Traffic analysis method can be used to break the anonymity of anonymous networks, e.g., TORs. There are two methods of traffic-analysis attack, passive and active. 

*In passive traffic-analysis method, the attacker extracts features from the traffic of a specific flow on one side of the network and looks for those features on the other side of the network. 
*In active traffic-analysis method, the attacker alters the timings of the packets of a flow according to a specific pattern and looks for that pattern on the other side of the network; therefore, the attacker can link the flows in one side to the other side of the network and break the anonymity of it. It is shown, although timing noise is added to the packets, there are active traffic analysis methods robust against such a noise.

== In military intelligence ==

In a military context, traffic analysis is a basic part of signals intelligence, and can be a source of information about the intentions and actions of the target. Representative patterns include:

* Frequent communications – can denote planning
* Rapid, short communications – can denote negotiations
* A lack of communication – can indicate a lack of activity, or completion of a finalized plan
* Frequent communication to specific stations from a central station – can highlight the chain of command
* Who talks to whom – can indicate which stations are &#x27;in charge&#x27; or the &#x27;control station&#x27; of a particular network. This further implies something about the personnel associated with each station
* Who talks when – can indicate which stations are active in connection with events, which implies something about the information being passed and perhaps something about the personnel/access of those associated with some stations
* Who changes from station to station, or medium to medium – can indicate movement, fear of interception

There is a close relationship between traffic analysis and cryptanalysis (commonly called codebreaking). Callsigns and addresses are frequently encrypted, requiring assistance in identifying them. Traffic volume can often be a sign of an addressee&#x27;s importance, giving hints to pending objectives or movements to cryptanalysts.

===Traffic flow security===
Traffic-flow security is the use of measures that conceal the presence and properties of valid messages on a network to prevent traffic analysis. This can be done by operational procedures or by the protection resulting from features inherent in some cryptographic equipment. Techniques used include:

* changing radio callsigns frequently
* encryption of a message&#x27;s sending and receiving addresses (codress messages)
* causing the circuit to appear busy at all times or much of the time by sending dummy traffic
* sending a continuous encrypted signal, whether or not traffic is being transmitted. This is also called masking or link encryption.

Traffic-flow security is one aspect of communications security.

=== COMINT metadata analysis ===

The Communications&#x27; Metadata Intelligence, or COMINT metadata is a term in communications intelligence (COMINT) referring to the concept of producing intelligence by analyzing only the technical metadata, hence, is a great practical example for traffic analysis in intelligence.

While traditionally information gathering in COMINT is derived from intercepting transmissions, tapping the target&#x27;s communications and monitoring the content of conversations, the metadata intelligence is not based on content but on technical communicational data.

Non-content COMINT is usually used to deduce information about the user of a certain transmitter, such as locations, contacts, activity volume, routine and its exceptions.

==Examples==
For example, if an emitter is known as the radio transmitter of a certain unit, and by using direction finding (DF) tools, the position of the emitter is locatable, the change of locations from one point to another can be deduced, without listening to any orders or reports. If one unit reports back to a command on a certain pattern, and another unit reports on the same pattern to the same command, the two units are probably related. That conclusion is based on the metadata of the two units&#x27; transmissions, not on the content of their transmissions.

Using all or as much of the metadata available is commonly used to build up an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB) by mapping different entities in the battlefield and their connections. Of course, the EOB could be built by tapping all the conversations and trying to understand, which unit is where, but using the metadata with an automatic analysis tool enables a much faster and accurate EOB build-up, which, alongside tapping, builds a much better and complete picture.

===World War I===
* British analysts during World War I noticed that the call sign of German Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, commanding the hostile fleet, had been transferred to a land station. Admiral of the Fleet Beatty, ignorant of Scheer&#x27;s practice of changing call signs upon leaving harbour, dismissed its importance and disregarded Room 40 analysts&#x27; attempts to make the point. The German fleet sortied, and the British were late in meeting them at the Battle of Jutland. If traffic analysis had been taken more seriously, the British might have done better than a &quot;draw&quot;.
* French military intelligence, shaped by Auguste Kerckhoffs&#x27;s legacy, had erected a network of intercept stations at the Western Front in pre-war times. When the Germans crossed the frontier, the French worked out crude means for direction-finding based on intercepted signal intensity. The recording of call signs and of traffic volumes further enabled the French to identify German combat groups and to distinguish fast-moving cavalry from slower infantry.

===World War II===
* In the early part of World War II, the aircraft carrier was evacuating pilots and planes from Norway. Traffic analysis produced indications and were moving into the North Sea, but the Admiralty dismissed the report as unproven. The captain of &quot;Glorious&quot; did not keep sufficient lookout and was subsequently surprised and sunk. Harry Hinsley, the young Bletchley Park liaison to the Admiralty, later said that his reports from the traffic analysts were taken much more seriously thereafter.
* During the planning and rehearsal for the attack on Pearl Harbor, very little traffic was passed by radio, subject to interception. The ships, units, and commands involved were all in Japan and in touch by phone, courier, signal lamp, or even flag. None of that traffic was intercepted, and could not be analyzed.
* The espionage effort against Pearl Harbor before December did not send an unusual number of messages; Japanese vessels regularly called in Hawaii and messages were carried aboard by consular personnel. At least one such vessel carried some Japanese Navy Intelligence officers. Such messages could not be analyzed. It has been suggested, however, the volume of diplomatic traffic to and from certain consular stations might have indicated places of interest to Japan, which might thus have suggested locations to concentrate traffic analysis and decryption efforts.
* Admiral Nagumo&#x27;s Pearl Harbor Attack Force sailed under radio silence, with its radios physically locked down. It is unclear if that deceived the US since Pacific Fleet intelligence had been unable to locate the Japanese carriers in the days immediately preceding the attack on Pearl Harbor.
* The Japanese Navy played radio games to inhibit traffic analysis (see Examples, below) with the attack force after it sailed in late November. Radio operators normally assigned to carriers, with a characteristic Morse Code &quot;fist&quot;, transmitted from inland Japanese waters, suggesting the carriers were still near Japan.
* Operation Quicksilver, part of the British deception plan for the Invasion of Normandy during World War II fed German intelligence a combination of true and false information about troop deployments in Britain, which caused the Germans to deduce an order of battle that suggested an invasion at the Pas-de-Calais, instead of Normandy. The fictitious divisions that were created for the deception were supplied with real radio units, which maintained a flow of messages that was consistent with the deception.

== In computer security ==

Traffic analysis is also a concern in computer security. An attacker can gain important information by monitoring the frequency and timing of network packets. A timing attack on the SSH protocol can use timing information to deduce information about passwords since, during interactive session, SSH transmits each keystroke as a message. The time between keystroke messages can be studied using hidden Markov models. Song, &quot;et al.&quot; claim that it can recover the password fifty times faster than a brute force attack.

Onion routing systems are used to gain anonymity. Traffic analysis can be used to attack anonymous communication systems like the Tor anonymity network. Adam Back, Ulf Möeller and Anton Stiglic present traffic analysis attacks against anonymity providing systems. Steven J. Murdoch and George Danezis from University of Cambridge presented 
research showing that traffic-analysis allows adversaries to infer which nodes relay the anonymous streams. This reduces the anonymity provided by Tor. They have shown that otherwise unrelated streams can be linked back to the same initiator.

Remailer systems can also be attacked via traffic analysis. If a message is observed going to a remailing server, and an identical-length (if now anonymized) message is seen exiting the server soon after, a traffic analyst may be able to (automatically) connect the sender with the ultimate receiver. Variations of remailer operations exist that can make traffic analysis less effective.

Traffic analysis involves intercepting and scrutinizing cybersecurity threats to gather valuable insights about anonymous data flowing through the exit node. By using technique rooted in dark web crawling and specializing software, one can identify the specific characteristics of a client&#x27;s network traffic within the dark web.

== Countermeasures ==

It is difficult to defeat traffic analysis without both encrypting messages and masking the channel. When no actual messages are being sent, the channel can be masked by sending dummy traffic, similar to the encrypted traffic, thereby keeping bandwidth usage constant. &quot;It is very hard to hide information about the size or timing of messages. The known solutions require Alice to send a continuous stream of messages at the maximum bandwidth she will ever use...This might be acceptable for military applications, but it is not for most civilian applications.&quot; The military-versus-civilian problems applies in situations where the user is charged for the volume of information sent.

Even for Internet access, where there is not a per-packet charge, ISPs make statistical assumption that connections from user sites will not be busy 100% of the time. The user cannot simply increase the bandwidth of the link, since masking would fill that as well. If masking, which often can be built into end-to-end encryptors, becomes common practice, ISPs will have to change their traffic assumptions.

<text>Cabo Rojo (), ) is a city and municipality situated on the southwest coast of Puerto Rico and forms part of the San Germán–Cabo Rojo metropolitan area as well as the larger Mayagüez–San Germán–Cabo Rojo Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
The area near Las Salinas (salt flats) has been inhabited since 30 BC and AD 120 according to archaeological evidence. Punta Ostiones, listed in the National Register of Historic Places as an archeological site, was home to a large group of Archaic Indians.

Despite the threat of pirates and natives, the Spanish settled the area of Los Morrillos around 1511. By 1525, salt mining was an important industry in the area. In 1759 the first request to establish itself as a town was denied. Cabo Rojo was founded on December 17, 1771, by Nicolás Ramírez de Arellano, a descendant of Spanish nobility, with the approval of Governor and Captain General Miguel de Muesas. According to Fray Iñigo Abbad y Lasierra, by the end of 1776, Cabo Rojo had a population of 1,215 people.

Cabo Rojo (&quot;red cape&quot; in English) derives its name from both the reddish color of its salt-flats and the reddish tint that characterizes the seaside cliffs along its southern coast. According to legend, the name was given by Christopher Columbus himself. The first church, founded in 1783, was called San José. The present-day main Catholic church is called San Miguel Arcángel Church located in the town&#x27;s square.

Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States. On October 18, 1898, formal possession of the island was assumed and the American flag raised over the fortifications from which the emblem of Spain had flown for nearly four centuries.

Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, causing large-scale damage and destruction to infrastructure. In Cabo Rojo, around 400 homes lost their roof, and three thousand residents were left without drinking water as a result of Hurricane María. The coastal fishing village of Joyuda was the most impacted area of Cabo Rojo.

==Geography==
The municipality of Cabo Rojo lies on the southern-west corner of the island of Puerto Rico, on the Western Coastal Plains. Sierra Bermeja, Puerto Rico&#x27;s geologically oldest mountain range, crosses the municipality from west to east towards Lajas. It is bordered by Mayagüez and Hormigueros to the north, San Germán and Lajas to the east, the Caribbean Sea to the south and the Mona Passage to the west. Cabo Rojo has a surface area of 72 square miles (187 km2).

Cabo Rojo&#x27;s terrain is flat, however, some notable peaks are Mariquita, Buena Vista, Cerro Vargas, and Peñones de Melones.

===Barrios===

Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Cabo Rojo is subdivided into barrios. The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a small barrio referred to as , near the center of the municipality. Cabo Rojo is a principal municipality of the San Germán–Cabo Rojo metropolitan area as well as the larger Mayagüez–San Germán–Cabo Rojo Combined Statistical Area.

People from the El Combate community in barrio Boquerón are known as &quot;mata con hacha&quot; (&quot;those who kill with axes&quot;) based on an old folk tale about a fight over the &quot;salinas&quot;, where those from Cabo Rojo fought with axes against people from the adjacent town of Lajas. The latter apparently fought back by throwing stones and are thus known as &quot;tira piedras&quot; (&quot;those who throw stones&quot;).

===Sectors===
Barrios (which are like minor civil divisions) and subbarrios, are further subdivided into smaller areas called (&quot;sectors&quot; in English). The types of &quot;sectores&quot; may vary, from normally &quot;sector&quot; to &quot;urbanización&quot; to &quot;reparto&quot; to &quot;barriada&quot; to &quot;residencial&quot;, among others.

===Special Communities===

 (Special Communities of Puerto Rico) are marginalized communities whose citizens are experiencing a certain amount of social exclusion. A map shows these communities occur in nearly every municipality of the commonwealth. Of the 742 places that were on the list in 2014, the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Cabo Rojo: Ballajá, Colacho, El Fuego y Las Piedras (Guaniquilla), Hoyo Bravo, Las Quebradas en Monte Grande, Pedernales, Puerto Real, and Sector Corozo.

==Climate==

==Demographics==
In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Cabo Rojo was 16,154.
==Tourism==

There are 127 beaches in Cabo Rojo, including .

Its tourism industry has flourished with the development of hotels and marinas, but local and international environmentalists are concerned that this development will endanger Cabo Rojo&#x27;s rich and beautiful beaches, sunsets and natural resources. Cabo Rojo is also well known for its fishing, particularly the &quot;Puerto Real&quot; fishing village, and its many seafood restaurants, most of which are found in the fishing village of Joyuda.

===Landmarks and places of interest===
The San Miguel Arcángel Church, in the main town square, was built between 1773 and 1783. The famous Cabo Rojo lighthouse, Los Morrillos Lighthouse, known by locals as &quot;El Faro&quot;, was built in 1881 over limestone cliffs that rise 200 feet above sea level. This old lighthouse was automated and electrically charged in 1967 and is considered to have some, if not, the most spectacular ocean views on Puerto Rico&#x27;s west coast. The lighthouse has undergone recent renovations which has created controversy because of the quality of the work. According to locals and scholars, the internal structure was gutted leaving nothing of historical significance behind.

The lighthouse is located near the &quot;Salinas&quot;, or salt mines. These salt mines are reported to be the oldest industry in the New World. Salt has been mined in this site non-stop since the time of the Taínos. Near the &quot;Salinas&quot;, a local civic group &quot;Caborrojeños Pro Salud y Ambiente&quot; run a visitor center known as the &quot;Centro Interpretativo Las Salinas De Cabo Rojo don Efrén Pérez Rivera&quot;. They offer free guided tours of the local area, which is rich in flora and fauna.

<text>Cynewulf (, ; also spelled Cynwulf or Kynewulf) is one of twelve Old English poets known by name, and one of four whose work is known to survive today. He presumably flourished in the 9th century, with possible dates extending into the late 8th and early 10th centuries.

Cynewulf is a well-attested Anglo-Saxon given name derived from &quot;&quot; &quot;royal, of a king&quot; and &quot;&quot; &quot;wolf&quot;.

Known for his religious compositions, Cynewulf is regarded as one of the pre-eminent figures of Anglo-Saxon Christian poetry. Posterity knows of his name by means of runic signatures that are interwoven into the four poems which comprise his scholastically recognized corpus. These poems are: &quot;The Fates of the Apostles&quot;, &quot;Juliana&quot;, &quot;Elene&quot;, and &quot;Christ II&quot; (also referred to as &quot;The Ascension&quot;).

The four signed poems of Cynewulf are vast in that they collectively comprise several thousand lines of verse. In comparison, the one work attributed to Cædmon, &quot;Cædmon&#x27;s Hymn&quot;, is quite succinct at nine lines.

==Life==
===Dialect===
Some basic statements can be made by examining such aspects as the spellings of his name and his verse. Although the &quot;Vercelli&quot; and &quot;Exeter&quot; manuscripts were primarily late West Saxon in their scribal translations, it is most probable that Cynewulf wrote in the Anglian dialect and it follows that he resided either in the province of Northumbria or Mercia.

This is shown through linguistic and metrical analysis of his poems (e.g., &quot;Elene&quot;), where in the poem&#x27;s epilogue (beginning l.1236) the imperfect rhymes become corrected when Anglian forms of the words are substituted for the West Saxon forms. For instance, the manuscript presents the false rhyme which can be corrected when the middle vowel sounds of both words are replaced with an sound. The new rhyme shows a typical Anglian smoothing of the . Numerous other &quot;Anglianisms&quot; in &quot;Elene&quot; and &quot;Juliana&quot; have been taken to be indicative of an original Anglian dialect underlying the West Saxon translation of the texts. Any definite conclusion to Cynewulf being either Northumbrian or Mercian has been hard to come by, but linguistic evidence suggests that the medial in the signed Cynewulf would have, during the broad window period of Cynewulf&#x27;s existence, been characteristic of a Mercian dialect.

===Date===
All the evidence considered, no exact deduction of Cynewulf&#x27;s date is accepted, but it is likely he flourished in the ninth century.

A firm &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; that can be put on the date of Cynewulf are the dates of the Vercelli and Exeter manuscripts, which are approximately in the second half of the tenth century.
Other than that, no certain date can be put on the author, leaving open the full range of Old English literature between the 7th and the early 10th centuries. Any attempt to link the man with a documented historical figure has met failure or resulted in an improbable connection. However, the presence of early West Saxon forms in both manuscripts means that it is possible an Alfredian scribe initially translated Cynewulf&#x27;s verse, placing him no later than the turn of the tenth century.

A tentative &quot;terminus post quem&quot; is based on the two textual variations of Cynewulf&#x27;s name, Cynewulf and Cynwulf. The older spelling of the name was &quot;Cyniwulf&quot;, and Sisam points out that the tends to change to an about the middle of the eighth century, and the general use of the phases itself out by the end of the century, suggesting Cynewulf cannot be dated much before the year 800. Moreover, it has been argued that the &quot;cult of the cross&quot;, which can find ground in Cynewulf&#x27;s &quot;Elene&quot;, achieved its cultural apex in the eighth century.
Also deserving consideration is the argument that the acrostic was most fashionable in ninth century poetry and Cynewulf&#x27;s own acrostic signature would have followed the trend during this time.

===Identity===
Cynewulf was without question a literate and educated man, since there is no other way we can &quot;account for the ripeness which he displays in his poetry&quot;. Given the subject matter of his poetry he was likely a man in holy orders, and the deep Christian knowledge conveyed through his verse implies that he was well learned in ecclesiastical and hagiographical literature, as well as the dogma and doctrine of the Catholic Church. His apparent reliance on Latin sources for inspiration means he knew the Latin language, and this of course would correlate with him being a man of the Church.

Cynewulf of Lindisfarne (d. c. 780) is a plausible candidate for Cynewulf the poet, based on the argument that the poet&#x27;s elaborate religious pieces must lend themselves to &quot;the scholarship and faith of the professional ecclesiastic speaking with authority&quot;, but this conclusion is not universally accepted. Alternative suggestions for the poet&#x27;s identity include Cynwulf, a Dunwich priest (fl. 803), and Cenwulf, Abbot of Peterborough (d. 1006).

===Views on poetry===
In his &quot;Christ II&quot;, Cynewulf wrote:

Likewise, Cynewulf&#x27;s autobiographical reflection in the epilogue of &quot;Elene&quot; claims that his own skill in poetry comes directly from God, who &quot;unlocked the art of poesy&quot; within him. Cynewulf seems to have justified his poetic endeavours through a philosophy in which poetry was &quot;associated with wisdom&quot;.

==Works==
Following the studies of S. K. Das (1942) and Claes Schaar (1949), mainstream scholarship tends to limit Cynewulf&#x27;s canon to the four poems which bear his acrostic mark:
the &quot;Exeter Book&quot; holds Cynewulf&#x27;s &quot;Juliana&quot; and &quot;Christ II&quot; (&quot;The Ascension&quot;) and the &quot;Vercelli Book&quot; his &quot;Elene&quot; and &quot;Fates of the Apostles&quot;.

Early scholars for a long while assigned a plethora of Old English pieces to Cynewulf on the basis that these pieces somewhat resembled the style of his signed poems. It was at one time plausible to believe that Cynewulf was author of the &quot;Riddles of the Exeter Book&quot;, the &quot;Phoenix&quot;, the &quot;Andreas&quot;, and the &quot;Guthlac&quot;; even famous unassigned poems such as the &quot;Dream of the Rood&quot;, the &quot;Harrowing of Hell&quot;, and the &quot;Physiologus&quot; have at one time been ascribed to him.

The four poems, like a substantial portion of Anglo-Saxon poetry, are sculpted in alliterative verse.
All four poems draw upon Latin sources such as homilies and hagiographies (the lives of saints) for their content, and this is to be particularly contrasted to other Old English poems (e.g., &quot;Genesis, Exodus, and Daniel&quot;), which are drawn directly from the Bible as opposed to secondary accounts.

In terms of length, &quot;Elene&quot; is by far the longest poem of Cynewulf&#x27;s corpus at 1,321 lines. It is followed by &quot;Juliana&quot;, at 731 lines, &quot;Christ II&quot;, at 427 lines, and &quot;The Fates of the Apostles&quot;, at a brisk 122 lines.
Three of the poems are martyrological, in that the central character in each suffer or die for their religious values. In &quot;Elene&quot;, Saint Helena endures her quest to find the Holy Cross and spread Christianity; in &quot;Juliana&quot;, the title character dies after she refuses to marry a pagan man, thus retaining her Christian integrity; in &quot;Fates of the Apostles&quot;, the speaker creates a song that meditates on the deaths of the apostles which they &quot;joyously faced&quot;.

&quot;Elene&quot; and &quot;Juliana&quot; fit in the category of poems that depict the lives of saints. These two poems, along with &quot;Andreas&quot; and &quot;Guthlac&quot; (parts A and B), constitute the only versified saints&#x27; legends in the Old English vernacular. &quot;The Ascension&quot; (&quot;Christ II&quot;) is outside the umbrella of the other three works and is a vehement description of a devotional subject.

The exact chronology of the poems is not known. One argument asserts that &quot;Elene&quot; is likely the last of the poems because the autobiographical epilogue implies that Cynewulf is old at the time of composition, but this view has been doubted. Nevertheless, it seems that &quot;Christ II&quot; and &quot;Elene&quot; represent the cusp of Cynewulf&#x27;s career, while &quot;Juliana&quot; and &quot;Fates of the Apostles&quot; seem to be created by a less inspired, and perhaps less mature, poet.

==Runic signature==

All four of Cynewulf&#x27;s poems contain passages where the letters of the poet&#x27;s name are woven into the text using runic symbols that also double as meaningful ideas pertinent to the text. In &quot;Juliana&quot; and &quot;Elene&quot;, the interwoven name is spelled in the more recognizable form as Cynewulf, while in &quot;Fates&quot; and &quot;Christ II&quot; it is observed without the medial e so the runic acrostic says Cynwulf.

The practice of claiming authorship over one&#x27;s poems was a break from the tradition of the anonymous poet, where no composition was viewed as being owned by its creator. Cynewulf devised a tradition where authorship would connote ownership of the piece and an originality that would be respected by future generations. Furthermore, by integrating his name, Cynewulf was attempting to retain the structure and form of his poetry that would undergo mutations otherwise.
From a different perspective, Cynewulf&#x27;s intent may not have been to claim authorship, but to &quot;seek the prayers of others for the safety of his soul&quot;. It is contended that Cynewulf wished to be remembered in the prayers of his audience in return for the pleasure they would derive from his poems. In a sense his expectation of a spiritual reward can be contrasted with the material reward that other poets of his time would have expected for their craft.

<text>The palochka () is a letter in the Cyrillic script. The letter is usually caseless. It was introduced in the late 1930s as the Hindu-Arabic digit &#x27;1&#x27;, and on Cyrillic keyboards, it is usually typeset as the Roman numeral &#x27;I&#x27;. Unicode currently supports both caseless/capital palochka at U+04C0 and a rarer lower-case palochka at U+04CF. The palochka marks glottal(ized) and pharyngeal(ized) consonants.

==Form==
The letter looks similar to the digit 1. Its uppercase form resembles the Latin Letter I (I i) in uppercase form, while its lowercase form resembles the Latin letter L (L l) in lowercase form.

==History==
The Cyrillic palochka was derived directly from the Arabic letter alif (). The name of the letter comes from a diminutive form of the Russian word палка (translit. ), which means &quot;stick&quot; in English. In the early days of the Soviet Union, many of the non-Russian Cyrillic alphabets contained only letters found in the Russian alphabet to keep them compatible with Russian typewriters. Sounds absent from Russian were marked with digraphs and other letter combinations. The palochka was the only exception because the numerical digit 1 was used instead of the letter. In fact, on many Russian typewriters, the character looked not like the digit 1 but like the Roman numeral with serifs. That is still common because the palochka is not present in most standard keyboard layouts (and, for some of them, not even the soft-dotted ) or common fonts and so it cannot be easily entered or reliably displayed on many computer systems. For example, as of 2024, even the official site of the People&#x27;s Assembly of the Republic of Ingushetia uses the digit 1 instead of the palochka.

==Usage==
In the alphabets of Abaza, Avar, Chechen, Dargwa, Ingush, Lak, Lezgian, Tabassaran, and Tsakhur, it is a modifier letter which signals the preceding consonant as an ejective or pharyngeal consonant; this letter has no phonetic value on its own.

In Adyghe, the palochka by itself represents a glottal stop (like the tt in GA button).
*Example from Kabardian Adyghe dialect: , &quot;he asked her for something&quot;

In Avar, it represents an ejective consonant.
*Example from Avar: , &quot;to speak&quot;

In Chechen, the palochka makes a preceding stop or affricate ejective if voiceless, or pharyngealized if voiced, but also represents the voiced pharyngeal fricative (like the ayn in Arabic) when it does not follow a stop or affricate. As an exception, in the digraph ⟨хӀ⟩, it produces the voiceless pharyngeal fricative . Ingush is similar.
*Examples from Chechen: , &quot;girl&quot; and жӀаьла [], &quot;shark”

Exceptionally among the Caucasian languages, Abkhaz does not use the palochka, but instead uses a series of special letters to distinguish ejective and non-ejective (aspirated) consonants.

==Computing codes==
: The lowercase form of the palochka was added to Unicode 5.0 in July 2006.

<text>Maritime studies is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses liberal arts or business as the foundation for exploring humankind&#x27;s relationship with waterways and watersheds. Incorporating maritime history, sea literature, poetry, film, cultural studies, anthropology, archeology, cartography, oceanography, environmental studies, and contemporary marine policy, maritime studies covers a broader scope than traditional maritime history or seamanship. 

Maritime Studies &quot;must be broad based and multidisciplinary and involve &#x27;almost every profession having to do with the sea.&#x27;&quot; 
Some of the institutions providing maritime studies combine a broad grounding in technical and scientific coursework with the study of courses in arts and humanities. 

While maritime academies frequently prepare cadets for careers in the merchant marine, maritime studies programs prepare students for a variety of careers in the civilian maritime industrial and service sectors. Graduate and undergraduate programs are offered at the following institutions:

* The University of Connecticut /Avery Point Campus
* East Carolina University
* Escola de Formação de Oficiais da Marinha Mercante
* Memorial University of Newfoundland
* Texas A &amp; M Galveston
* University of West Florida
* State University of New York Maritime College

<text>The Speaker was the presiding officer of the Fijian House of Representatives. At its first session following a general election, the House members elected a Speaker and a Deputy Speaker. With a view to ensuring impartiality, the Speaker was not allowed to be a member of the House, though he was required to qualify for membership. The Deputy Speaker, however, was elected from among members of the House.

The office of Speaker was an essential feature of the parliamentary system, and has proved to be the most durable of all the Westminster parliamentary traditions.

The House of Representatives of Fiji was preceded by Legislative Council of Fiji. In the 2013 Constitution, the House of Representatives was abolished, and replaced by a single chamber Parliament.

<doc id="480048" wikidata="Q992792" url="?curid=480048" title="Well-field system">
<text>The well-field system () was a Chinese land redistribution method existing between the ninth century BCE (late Western Zhou dynasty) to around the Warring States period. Though Mencius describes examples from the Xia and Shang dynasties, these could be mythological or imagined. The name comes from Chinese character (&quot;jǐng&quot;), which means &#x27;well&#x27; and looks like the # symbol; this character represents the theoretical appearance of land division: a square area of land was divided into nine identically sized sections; the eight outer sections (私田; &quot;sītián&quot;) were privately cultivated by farmers, or nong in Chinese, one of the occupations of the four occupations system; and the center section (公田; gōngtián) was communally cultivated on behalf of the government, or in some cases, the landowning aristocrat or duke.

While all fields were government- or aristocrat-owned, the private fields were managed exclusively by farmers and the produce was entirely the farmers&#x27;. It was only produce from the communal fields, worked on by all eight families, that went to the government for famine distribution or the aristocrats and which, in turn, could go to the king as tribute.

However, in Mencius it is said that all people in office got 50 mu (about half an acre).

As part of a larger fengjian system, the well-field system became strained in the Spring and Autumn period as kinship ties between aristocrats became meaningless. When the system became economically untenable in the Warring States period, it was replaced by a system of private land ownership. It was first suspended in the state of Qin by Shang Yang and other states soon followed suit, though King Hui of Wei and King Xuan of Qi did think about restoring it after Mencius talked to them. They ultimately did not. 

As part of the &quot;turning the clock back&quot; reformations by Wang Mang during the short-lived Xin dynasty, the system was restored temporarily and renamed to the King&#x27;s Fields (王田; &quot;wángtián&quot;). The practice was more-or-less ended by the Song dynasty, but scholars like Zhang Zai and Su Xun were enthusiastic about its restoration invoking Mencius&#x27;s frequent praise of the system.

It is mentioned in the book of rites and it is said most anciently that the farmers only had to work the government fields 3 days a year; though it is unknown whether this is true, it is also said that the most ancient had houses given away, and 3 days was all that was required. In addition, it was stated the market of the goods would not be taxed; only a small fee for a stall, and travelers weren&#x27;t taxed. It is later said in other texts that taxes were put on the market goods when a merchant was looking from side to side and people thought he was plotting.

<text>Andrew Matthew William Faulds (1 March 1923 – 31 May 2000) was a British actor and Labour Party politician. After a successful acting career on stage, on radio and in films, he was a Member of Parliament from 1966 to 1997.

==Early life==
Faulds was born to Church of Scotland missionary parents in Isoko, Tanganyika. Due to his father&#x27;s peripatetic vocation, he grew up in various parts of Britain, and was educated at George Watson&#x27;s College, Edinburgh, King Edward VI Grammar School, Louth, Daniel Stewart&#x27;s College, Edinburgh, and Stirling High School. He married Bunty Whitfield in 1945. The couple had one daughter. During the Second World War he served in both the Royal Air Force and the Fleet Air Arm.

After graduating from the University of Glasgow, he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1948. He first came to a wider public recognition playing Jet Morgan in Charles Chilton&#x27;s radio drama &quot;Journey into Space&quot; on the BBC Light Programme.

==Acting career==
In 1959, Faulds and his wife played host to Paul Robeson, who had travelled to Britain to appear at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon in Tony Richardson&#x27;s production of &quot;Othello&quot;. Robeson had only recently been permitted again to travel abroad, following the revocation of his passport. During this visit, Robeson inspired Faulds to take up political activism.

Faulds maintained his acting career throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and in particular became a key part of film director Ken Russell&#x27;s repertory company, appearing in, among other films, &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot; (1967) (as William Morris), &quot;The Devils&quot; (1971), &quot;Mahler&quot; (1974) and &quot;Lisztomania&quot; (1975). He appeared in Russell&#x27;s film &quot;The Music Lovers&quot; (1970) alongside Glenda Jackson, who later also become a Labour MP.

One of Faulds&#x27; best-remembered roles is Phalerus in &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; (1963), in which he took part in the skeleton fight scene that featured model work by Ray Harryhausen. Another was in &quot;The Radio Ham&quot; (1961), an episode of &quot;Hancock&quot;, as the unseen voice of &#x27;mayday&#x27;.

==Member of Parliament==
Faulds first stood for Parliament as the Labour candidate in the 1963 Stratford by-election, caused by the resignation of John Profumo over a security scandal. He fought the constituency again in the general election the following year, but on both occasions he was beaten by the Conservative future Cabinet minister Angus Maude.

In the 1964 general election, the Labour Shadow Foreign Secretary, Patrick Gordon Walker, was defeated in controversial circumstances in the Smethwick constituency by Conservative candidate Peter Griffiths. Smethwick had become the home of immigrants from the Commonwealth in the years following the Second World War, and Griffiths&#x27; 1964 campaign was critical of Conservative government policy as well as of Labour statements on the issue. Increasing the Labour vote in the Smethwick constituency for the first time since 1950, Faulds defeated Griffiths in the 1966 general election and became Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency, being re-elected until his retirement in 1997.

The constituency was renamed Warley East in 1974. Smethwick remained the focus of much racial tension in Britain throughout Faulds&#x27; time as an MP, in particular following the &quot;Rivers of Blood speech&quot; by fellow West Midlands MP Enoch Powell in 1968. Faulds characterised Powell&#x27;s speech as &quot;... unchristian ... unprincipled, undemocratic and racialist.&quot; Faulds has sometimes been named as a supporter of capital punishment on the basis of off-the-cuff remarks, but he is listed in &quot;Hansard&quot; as voting against the restoration of the death penalty in 1969.

Faulds became known for using controversial language in the House of Commons; for example, verbally attacking Norman St John-Stevas in a heated debate over abortion in 1967, saying that he &quot;has not the capacity to put a bun in anybody&#x27;s oven&quot; (referring to Stevas&#x27; homosexuality). In 1978, Faulds was pressured to apologise for calling John Davies, the Shadow Foreign Secretary at the time, a &quot;fat-arsed twit&quot;; ten years later, Faulds was reproached for calling David Shaw &quot;an honourable shit&quot;. In 1990, he called prime minister Margaret Thatcher a &quot;stupid, negative woman&quot; for sending troops into the Gulf.

In 1973, Labour leader Harold Wilson dismissed Faulds as Labour&#x27;s arts spokesman for accusing Jewish MPs of dual loyalty.

A Europhile, Faulds was one of only five Labour MPs to vote for the Third Reading of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993 (which gave effect in UK law to the Maastricht Treaty) in 1993. In so doing, he defied his party whip, which was to abstain.

<text>The boreal chickadee (Poecile hudsonicus) is a small passerine songbird in the tit family Paridae. It is found in the boreal forests of Alaska, Canada and the northern United States and remains within this range all year. This bird is known for its high pitched trill patterns used in communication with other birds and food storage habits in preparation for winter months.

==Description==
Adults are long with a weight of . They have grey-brown upperparts with a brown cap and greyish wings and tail; their face is mainly grey with white on the sides. Their underparts are white with brown on the flanks and a black throat. They have a short dark bill, short wings and a long notched tail. Their flight consists of brief gliding patterns followed by fast and bouncy wing beats as they travel through the air.

==Vocal communications==
The call is a husky &quot;tsee-day-day&quot;, as well as a high pitched trill sound, &quot;dididididididi&quot; a variant on the call which gives chickadees their name. This call is composed of five distinct note-type categories consisting of A, B, C, D and D-hybrid with the beginning and end note both displaying a high frequency pitch. Boreal chickadees use specialized notes within their vocal range to communicate with each other and convey information. Certain notes/calls can be used as a mating tactic or to indicate a bird&#x27;s rank to neighbouring fertile females in the area. Females have also been known to be more attracted to a male chickadee if he portrays complex and larger song repertoires. Calls can also be used in territory defence or to warn others of an invader that come to close to a nesting female. Cross species comparisons can be made by comparing the vocal similarities between other species of chickadee&#x27;s.

==Breeding/nesting behaviour==
Their breeding habitat is coniferous woods in Canada, Alaska, and the northernmost portions of the contiguous United States. They generally breed from early May to the end of August and remain within their breeding range throughout the year, but sometimes move south in winter. When a female chickadee finds a high quality male to mate with this provides direct and indirect benefits such as exceptional parental care and high quality genes. The pair remains together year round and may mate for life. Winter movements south of their range, however, appear to have become increasingly rare. Large bodies of water and mountain ranges may restrict dispersal of the boreal chickadee into places such as the Vancouver Islands and Haida Gwaii. They nest in a hole in a tree; the pair excavates the nest, using a natural cavity or sometimes an old woodpecker nest. This nest can be made of hair, fur or dead plants. Five to seven eggs are laid, white with fine reddish-brown spotting. Eggs are laid between May and July and hatch within 13–16 days. After the eggs have hatched it takes another 16–18 days for the birds to fully develop wings large enough to attempt flight.

==Foraging behaviour==
These birds forage on conifer branches or probe into the bark, gleaning insects and foraging for conifer seeds, which may be stored in preparation for winter months. Boreal chickadees are known to store large amounts of food in different trees, each location containing several food items. Food is usually stored in the mid-region of trees at a lower level than at which they foraged. They generally forage in black spruce, white spruce and tamarack trees which minimizes competition with black-capped chickadees who forage in more deciduous and mixed forests. Boreal chickadees often forage in small flocks including other small birds, especially in winter.

==Predators==
With the advantage of being a winged bird, the boreal chickadee has few predators. These consist of larger birds such as small owls, hawks and shrikes. Predators of eggs and baby boreal chickadees generally consist of tree climbing animals such as squirrels, chipmunks, mice, bears and rats.

==Threats==
The largest threat that is placed on boreal chickadees is clearcutting and logging that occurs in the boreal forest regions. These practices are causing dramatic reductions in mature forests and rapidly modifying the habitat of boreal chickadees.

==Taxonomy==
The species was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Parus&quot; with most other tits, but mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence data and morphology suggest that separating &quot;Poecile&quot; more adequately expresses these birds&#x27; relationships. Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the boreal chickadee is sister to the chestnut-backed chickadee (&quot;Poecile rufescens&quot;).

<text>The Advertiser is a daily tabloid format newspaper based in the city of Adelaide, South Australia. First published as a broadsheet named &quot;The South Australian Advertiser&quot; on 12 July 1858, it is currently a tabloid printed from Monday to Saturday. &quot;The Advertiser&quot; came under the ownership of Keith Murdoch in the 1950s, and the full ownership of Rupert Murdoch in 1987. It is a publication of Advertiser Newspapers Pty Ltd (ADV), a subsidiary of News Corp Australia, itself a subsidiary of News Corp. Through much of the 20th century, &quot;The Advertiser&quot; was Adelaide&#x27;s morning broadsheet, &quot;The News&quot; the afternoon tabloid, with &quot;The Sunday Mail&quot; covering weekend sport, and &quot;Messenger Newspapers&quot; community news. The head office was relocated from a former premises in King William Street, to a new News Corp office complex, known as Keith Murdoch House at 31 Waymouth Street.

==History==
===&quot;The South Australian Advertiser&quot;===
An early major daily colonial newspaper, &quot;The Adelaide Times&quot;, ceased publication on 9 May 1858. Shortly afterwards, Reverend John Henry Barrow, a former editor of the &quot;South Australian Register&quot; founded the morning newspaper &quot;The South Australian Advertiser&quot; and a companion weekly &quot;The South Australian Weekly Chronicle.&quot; The original owners were Barrow and Charles Henry Goode, and the first issues were published on 12 July 1858 and 17 July 1858 respectively. It initially consisted of four pages, each of seven columns, and cost 4 pence.

In 1863 the company started an afternoon newspaper &quot;The Express&quot; as a competitor to &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, an afternoon/evening daily paper independent of both &quot;The Advertiser&quot; and the &quot;South Australian Register&quot;. The company was then re-formed, effective 9 September 1864, with additional shareholders Philip Henry Burden, John Baker, Captain Scott, James Counsell, Thomas Graves and others. Burden, secretary of the company, died in 1864, and Barrow, whose wife had died in 1856, married his widow in 1865, thus owning together a quarter of the company. In December 1866, the syndicate bought the now defunct &quot;The Telegraph&quot; (by this time renamed &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; with a morning edition and a weekend &quot;Weekly Mail&quot;) at auction, and incorporated it with &quot;The Express&quot; to form &quot;The Express and Telegraph&quot;.

In 1871, when the shareholders were Barrow, Goode, Robert Stuckey, Thomas Graves, William Parkin, Thomas King, James Counsell, and George Williams Chinner, the partnership was dissolved and the business was carried on by Barrow and King. J. H. Barrow died on 22 August 1874, and Thomas King ran the papers for himself and Mrs. Barrow for about five years. In 1879 a new firm was created, consisting of Thomas King, Fred Burden (son of P. H. Burden and adopted son of J. H. Barrow), and John Langdon Bonython. In July 1884, Thomas King dropped out, and the firm of Burden &amp; Bonython was formed to run the paper.

=== &quot;The Advertiser&quot; ===

On 1 April 1889, the main publication was re-branded with an abbreviated title, &quot;The Advertiser&quot;. In December 1891, Burden retired, and sold his share of the company to Bonython, who, from 1894 to 1929, became the sole proprietor of &quot;The Advertiser&quot;. As well as being a talented newspaper editor, he also supported the movement towards the Federation of Australia. Later, in 1923, after a run of 60 years, &quot;The Express&quot; was stopped just as its renamed rival, &quot;The News&quot;, was starting. On 12 January 1929, &quot;The Mail&quot; announced that Bonython had sold &quot;The Advertiser&quot; for £1,250,000 to a group of Melbourne financiers &quot;The Herald and Weekly Times&quot;, an external media company, now had the controlling stake, but Bonython still retained a 48.7% interest. Bonython then retired from his newspapers in 1929, after 65 years&#x27; service, and his son, John Lavington Bonython, became editor. In February 1931, in the wake of the Great Depression, &quot;The Advertiser&quot; took over and shut down its ailing competitors, &quot;The Register&quot; (published 1836-1931), &quot;The Chronicle&quot; (&quot;Register&#x27;s&quot; Saturday sister publication), and &quot;The Observer&quot; (published 1843-1931), briefly renaming itself for seven months as &quot;The Advertiser and Register&quot;.

=== News Corp Australia ===
On the death of Keith Murdoch in 1952, ownership of &quot;The News&quot; and &quot;The Mail&quot; passed to his son Rupert Murdoch via News Limited. Following the handover, and in response to suggestions of external influences from Victoria made by competing newspaper &quot;The Mail&quot;, the Chairman of &quot;The Advertiser&#x27;s&quot; board published its policy in &quot;The Advertiser&quot; as follows:
&quot;It is the same today as when the late Sir Langdon Bonython was in sole control. It is based upon a profound pride and belief in South Australia, and the system of private enterprise which has made this State what it is.&quot;

On 24 October 1953 the company launched the &quot;Sunday Advertiser&quot; in direct competition to News Limited&#x27;s &quot;The Mail&quot;, but failed to outreach its rival, though no doubt affecting its profitability. It ceased publication five years or so later, after which the by then renamed &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; advertised itself as a joint publication of Advertiser Newspapers and News Ltd., and incorporated many of the &quot;Sunday Advertiser&quot; regular features. It had also introduced colour graphics on the comics page (rather primitive by today&#x27;s standards), but this was dropped shortly after joint publication commenced.

In addition, &quot;The Messenger&quot;, published since 1951 was partially purchased in 1962, and fully owned by 1983. When Murdoch acquired &quot;The Herald and Weekly Times&quot; in 1987, he also acquired the remaining 48.7% share of &quot;The Advertiser&quot;. He sold &quot;The News&quot; in 1987, and it was closed in 1992. Murdoch then changed the format of &quot;The Advertiser&quot; from a broadsheet to a tabloid in November 1997, and the masthead and content font and layout was modernised in September 2009.

==Circulation==
&quot;The Advertiser&quot; is available for purchase throughout South Australia and some towns and regions in New South Wales, Victoria and the Northern Territory located near or adjacent to the South Australia state border such as Broken Hill, Mildura, Nhill and Alice Springs. According to &quot;The Advertiser&quot;&#x27;s website, the newspaper is read by over 580,000 people each weekday, and by more than 740,000 people each Saturday. Circulation figures reported in May 2016 by Roy Morgan Research showed a continuing decline in readership, of 324,000 on weekdays, and 371,000 on Saturdays.

&quot;The Advertiser&quot;″s website, adelaidenow.com.au, was rated by third-party web analytics providers Alexa and SimilarWeb as, respectively, the 268th and 313rd most visited website in Australia, as of August 2015. SimilarWeb rates the site as the 29th most visited news website in Australia, attracting almost 1.8 million visitors per month. In 2015, along with other News Corp websites, &quot;The Advertiser&quot;″s website adopted a paywall with non-subscribers being locked out of &quot;premium&quot; content.

<doc id="480106" wikidata="Q1419915" url="?curid=480106" title="Royal Shrovetide Football">
<text>The Royal Shrovetide Football Match is a &quot;medieval football&quot; game played annually on Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday in the town of Ashbourne in Derbyshire, England. Shrovetide ball games have been played in England since at least the 12th century from the reign of Henry II (1154–89). The Ashbourne game also known as &quot;hugball&quot; has been played from at least c.1667 although the exact origins of the game are unknown due to a fire at the Royal Shrovetide Committee office in the 1890s which destroyed the earliest records. One of the most popular origin theories suggests the macabre notion that the &#x27;ball&#x27; was originally a severed head tossed into the waiting crowd following an execution. Although this may have happened, it is more likely that games such as the Winchelsea Streete Game, reputedly played during the Hundred Years&#x27; War with France, were adaptations of an original ball game intended to show contempt for the enemy.

One of the earliest references to football in the county of Derbyshire comes in a poem called &quot;Burlesque upon the Great Frost&quot; from 1683, written after the English Civil War by Charles Cotton, cousin to Aston Cockayne, Baronet of Ashbourne (1608–84):

Shrovetide football played between &quot;Two towns&quot; in Derby is often credited with being the source of the term &quot;local derby&quot;. A more widely accepted origin theory is The Derby horse race. Whatever the origins the &quot;local derby&quot; is now a recognised term for a football game played between local rivals and a Derby is a horse race.

 A previously unknown tentative link between Royal Shrovetide football and La soule played in Tricot, Picardy was established in 2012 by history and sociology of sport lecturer Laurent Fournier from the Universite de Nantes. Whilst undertaking a study of &quot;folk football&quot;, he noticed that the Coat of arms of the Cockayne family (seated in Ashbourne from the 12th century) painted on a 1909 Shrovetide ball displayed in the window of the &quot;Ashbourne Telegraph&quot; office contained three cockerels in its heraldic design. He recognised this matched the emblem of Tricot (also carrying three cockerels) where La soule is played on the first Sunday of Lent and Easter Monday. He was welcomed to Ashbourne by the Royal Shrovetide Committee and was a guest at the Shrovetide luncheon. Research into Royal Shrovetide Football&#x27;s lost history is ongoing (August 2012).

==History==
The concept of the ball game was understood in the Early Middle Ages (600–1066). Writing in the 9th century, Welsh monk and historian Nennius makes reference in his book Historia Brittonum to &quot;the field of Ælecti, in the district of Glevesing, where a party of boys were playing at ball&quot;. This account was attributed to a 5th-century source that has not survived. Ball games may have been played throughout the 1st millennium despite a lack of documented evidence. Oral traditions from the West Country and South East Wales assert that the games of Cornish &quot;Hurling to Country&quot; and &quot;Hurling to Goals&quot;, Devon &quot;Out-Hurling&quot; and Welsh &quot;Cnapan&quot; played during Christian festivals have more ancient Celtic origins. The wooden balls used in these games are only found in regions where Celtic culture is still venerated. These communal events may even have started with prehistoric workers hurling forward carved wooden balls or stone balls that archaeologists have theorised could have been used to move megaliths in stone circle construction. Records from antiquity have survived relating to various ball games played by the Romans, notably Harpastum which contained many elements that feature in the Shrovetide ball game. These influences were available to a Catholic Church Clergy familiar with native customs and educated in Latin when a ball game was introduced to Shrovetide festivities.

The earliest recorded Shrovetide ball game comes during the High Middle Ages (1066–1272) from the cleric William Fitzstephen in his description of London &quot;Descriptio Nobilissimae Civitatis Londoniae&quot; (c.1174–83). The game he witnessed was played at Carnival, an alternative name for Shrovetide, from the Latin &quot;Carnilevaria&quot;, a word variant of &quot;carne levare&quot; meaning to &quot;leave out meat&quot; an act of abstinence for Lent. Then as now games were played in the afternoon. His account suggests playing ball at Carnival had been an annual event for at least a generation.
…&quot;every year on the day called Carnival—to begin with the sports of boys (for we were all boys once)—scholars from the different schools bring fighting-cocks to their masters, and the whole morning is set apart to watch their cocks do battle in the schools, for the boys are given a holiday that day. After dinner all the young men of the town go out into the fields in the suburbs to play ball. The scholars of the various schools have their own ball, and almost all the followers of each occupation have theirs also. The seniors and the fathers and the wealthy magnates of the city come on horseback to watch the contests of the younger generation, and in their turn recover their lost youth: the motions of their natural heat seem to be stirred in them at the mere sight of such strenuous activity and by their participation in the joys of unbridled youth.&quot;
The location given for the &quot;suburbs&quot; was to the north of London. The area described of open fields and rivers is typical of the terrain still used for current games played in Ashbourne and in Workington, Cumbria, where &quot;Uppies and Downies&quot; games take place on Good Friday, Easter Tuesday and Easter Saturday.
…&quot;Everywhere outside the houses of those living in the suburbs, and adjacent to them, are the spacious and beautiful gardens of the citizens, and these are planted with trees. Also there are on the north side pastures and pleasant meadow lands through which flow streams
wherein the turning of mill-wheels makes a cheerful sound&quot;….
Although the names of the schools that participated were not stipulated, a previous reference to St. Paul&#x27;s, Holy Trinity, Aldgate and St. Martin-le-Grand College indicates these Church schools were integral to celebrating this holy-day.
…&quot;St. Paul, the church of the Holy Trinity, and the church of St. Martin have famous schools by special privilege and by virtue of their ancient dignity. But through the favour of some magnate, or through the presence of teachers who are notable or famous in philosophy, there are also other schools&quot;….


By the Late Middle Ages (1272–1485) there were many incarnations of the ball game being played at Shrovetide, Eastertide and Christmastide in and around the British Isles. All were played in a similar manner with localized innovations. Some of the other better-understood games, a few of which are still played, include the Ba&#x27; game (&quot;ba&quot;&#x27; being an abbreviation of &quot;ball&quot;), the Atherstone Ball Game, the Sedgefield Ball Game, Bottle-kicking (usually with a leather bottle as a substitute for the ball), Caid (an Irish name for various ball games and an animal-skin ball), Camp-ball (late medieval includes &quot;kicking camp&quot;), Football (late medieval), The Shrove Tuesday Football Ceremony of the Purbeck Marblers (Masonic ceremonial), Haxey Hood (&quot;Hood&quot; being the name given to a leather tube used instead of a ball), La soule (&quot;soule&quot; being the name for the ball in northern France), and Scoring the Hales (an alternative name for goals used in Cumbria and the Scottish borders). A contemporary collective term coined for these games is &quot;Mob football&quot;.

During the early modern period public schools open to the paying public (an alternative to private home education) adopted the ball game as a sports activity. The version they developed was called football and was played using a bladder-inflated ball. Scholars from these schools wrote the first standard codes for football. These inspired the development of modern codes of football, many created by the descendants of emigrants who spread the concept of football around the world.

==The Ashbourne game==

The game is played over two days on Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday, starting each day at 2:00 pm and lasting until 10:00 pm. If the goal is scored (in local parlance, the ball is &quot;goaled&quot;) before 6pm a new ball is released and play restarts from the town centre, otherwise play ends for the day. The ball is rarely kicked, though it is legal to kick, carry or throw it. Instead it generally moves through the town in a series of &quot;hugs&quot;, like a giant scrum in rugby, made up of dozens if not hundreds of people. When the ball is goaled, the scorer is carried on the shoulders of his colleagues into the courtyard of the Green Man Royal Hotel (this ceremony returned to its recognised spiritual home in 2014 after an absence in 2013 due to the closure of the hotel).

The two teams that play the game are known as the Up&#x27;Ards and the Down&#x27;Ards (local dialect for &quot;upwards and downwards&quot;). The Up&#x27;Ards are traditionally those town members born north of Henmore Brook, which runs through the town, and Down&#x27;Ards are those born south of the river. Each team attempts to carry the ball back to their own goal from the turn-up, rather than the more traditional method of scoring at/in the opponents goal. There are two goal posts apart, one at Sturston Mill (where the Up&#x27;Ards attempt to score), the other at Clifton Mill (where the Down&#x27;Ards score). Although the mills have long since been demolished, part of their millstones still stand on the bank of the river at each location and indeed themselves once served as the scoring posts. In 1996 the scoring posts were replaced once again by new smaller millstones mounted onto purpose-built stone structures, which are still in use to this day and require the players to actually be in the river in order to &#x27;goal&#x27; a ball, as this was seen as more challenging.

The actual process of &#x27;goaling&#x27; a ball requires a player to hit it against the millstone three successive times. This is not a purely random event, however, as the eventual scorer is elected en route to the goal and would typically be someone who lives in Ashbourne or at least whose family is well known to the community. The chances of a &#x27;tourist&#x27; goaling a ball are very remote, though they are welcome to join in the effort to reach the goal. When a ball is &#x27;goaled&#x27; that particular game ends.
The game is played through the town with no limit on the number of players or the playing area (aside from those mentioned in the rules below). Thus shops in the town are boarded up during the game, and people are encouraged to park their cars away from the main streets. The game is started from a special plinth in the town centre where the ball is thrown to the players (or &quot;turned-up&quot; in the local parlance), often by a visiting dignitary. Before the ball is turned-up, the assembled crowd sing &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; followed by &quot;God Save the King&quot;. The starting point has not changed in many years, although the town has changed around it; as a consequence, the starting podium is currently located in the town&#x27;s main car park, which is named Shaw Croft, this being the ancient name of the field in which it stands.

The game has been known as &quot;Royal&quot; since 1928, when the then–Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) turned up the ball. The prince suffered a bloody nose. The game received royal assent for a second time in 2003, when the game was once again started by the Prince of Wales, in this instance Prince Charles (later king Charles III). On this occasion, the prince threw the ball into play from a raised plinth. It is traditional for the dignitary of the day to be raised aloft near Compton Bridge, as the turner-up is escorted into the Shawcroft en route from the luncheon at the Leisure centre.

===The goals===


The Up&#x27;Ards&#x27; traditional goal was Sturston Mill in Sturston village east of Asbourne and the Down&#x27;Ards&#x27; goal was Clifton Mill in the village of Clifton west of Ashbourne. Clifton Mill was demolished in 1967. A stone obelisk with commemorative plaque marking the site was unveiled in 1968. This became the Down&#x27;Ards goal for the next 28 years. Sturston Mill was demolished in 1981. A timber post salvaged from the mill was erected on the site of the old mill to act as a goal for the Up&#x27;Ards.
The purpose-built goals erected in 1996 on the banks of Henmore Brook are located apart. The Up&#x27;Ards goal is upstream from Shawcroft adjacent to the site of the former Sturston Mill and the Down&#x27;Ards goal is downstream from Shawcroft adjacent to the site of the former Clifton Mill. The ball is goaled when tapped three times against a millstone incorporated in the goals.

===The ball===

 The game is played with a special ball, larger than a standard football, which is filled with Portuguese cork to help the ball float when it ends up in the river. It is now hand-painted by local craftsmen specially for the occasion, and the design is usually related to the dignitary who will be turning-up the ball. Once a ball is goaled it is repainted with the name and in the design of the scorer and is theirs to keep. If a ball is not goaled it is repainted in the design of the dignitary that turned it up and given back to them to keep. Many of the balls are put on display in the local pubs during the game for the public to view; traditionally these pubs are divided by team (The Wheel Inn being a popular Down&#x27;Ard base, and the Old Vaults for the Up&#x27;ards, for example).

===The rules===

There are very few rules in existence. The main ones are:

* Committing murder or manslaughter is prohibited. Unnecessary violence is frowned upon.
* The ball may not be carried in a motorised vehicle.
* The ball may not be hidden in a bag, coat or rucksack, etc.
* Cemeteries, churchyards and the town memorial gardens are strictly out of bounds.
* Playing after 10 pm is forbidden.
* To score a goal the ball must be tapped three times in the area of the goal.

===Roll of Honour===

Since 1891 a &quot;Roll of Honour&quot; has been kept, documenting both the turner-up and scorer of each game played. It can be seen from the list that the event has only been cancelled three times during that time, once in 1968, again in 2001, both times due to the outbreak of Foot-and-mouth disease and in 2021 due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Even during both World Wars the games were played; indeed, the Ashbourne Regiment even played a version of the game in the German trenches during the First World War.

On 7 March 1916 the 1/6th Battalion of the Sherwood Foresters (Notts and Derby) Regiment played a game whilst stationed in the French village of Ivergny. The ball was presented by the Ashbourne Committee and the first goal was scored by Private Robinson of &quot;C&quot; Company.

A series of wooden display frames carrying the names that are updated yearly are displayed at the new Ashbourne Library on Compton. The boards were originally in the Green Man, but were removed from there after the hotel shut in 2012.

==Local dialect==
The following are words and phrases used at the game, with a brief explanation of their meaning:

;Turner-up
:The person who starts that day&#x27;s game.
;Turning up
:The act of throwing the ball from the &quot;plinth&quot; into the crowd of waiting players to start a game.
;Hug
:The scrum-like formation that naturally forms as the Up&#x27;Ards and Down&#x27;Ards battle for the ball.
;Break
:When the ball is released from the hug and play moves quickly.
;Runners
:Players that wait on the outside of the hug for the ball to break in order to collect the ball and cover as much ground as possible in the direction of their team&#x27;s goal. There are selected runners for each team and they train regularly throughout the year, usually by running from goal to goal.
;River play
:As the name suggests, this is a reference to the sections of the game played in the river; as with runners there will be members of the team that specialise in river play. It is possible for the entire game to be played solely in the river.
;Clifton
:The Down&#x27;ards goal location.
;Sturston
:The Up&#x27;ards goal location.
;Duck
:Local colloquialism used as a friendly greeting, for example &quot;Do you know where the ball is, duck?&quot; Comparable words from other regions would include &quot;mate&quot; or &quot;pet&#x27;&quot;.
;The Green Man Royal Hotel
:Name of the pub/hotel where the pre-game dinner was hosted and speeches given; the turner-up was carried from here on the shoulders of the players and over to the Shawcroft. This function and ceremony has now moved to the Leisure Centre due to the closure of the Green Man in 2012. For 2014, it has been agreed with the new owner that the goal confirmation ceremony will return to the Green Man courtyard.
;Shrovie
:Slang for Shrovetide.
;&quot;Down wi&#x27; it&quot;
:Often shouted by many onlookers supporting the Up&#x27;ards or Down&#x27;ards, mainly women. To force the ball down in the centre of the &quot;hug&quot; thus slowing down the progress of the opposing team who are trying to throw the ball clear to their &quot;runners&quot; so they can make a &quot;break&quot; towards goal. This would typically happen when a team has won that day or the previous day and wish to force a draw in the game becoming overall winners that year.
;Plinth
:From where the ball is &quot;turned up&quot; (thrown) to start a game.

==The anthem==

The anthem is sung at a pre-game ceremony in a local hotel. It was written in 1891 for a concert held to raise money to pay off the fines ordered for playing the game in the street.
&lt;poem&gt;There&#x27;s a town still plays this glorious game
Tho&#x27; tis but a little spot.
And year by year the contest&#x27;s fought
From the field that&#x27;s called Shaw Croft.
Then friend meets friend in friendly strife
The leather for to gain,
And they play the game right manfully,
In snow, sunshine or rain.

Chorus

&#x27;Tis a glorious game, deny it who can
That tries the pluck of an Englishman.

For loyal the Game shall ever be
No matter when or where,
And treat that Game as ought but the free,
Is more than the boldest dare.
Though the ups and downs of its chequered life
May the ball still ever roll,
Until by fair and gallant strife
We&#x27;ve reached the treasur&#x27;d goal.

Chorus

&#x27;Tis a glorious game, deny it who can
That tries the pluck of an Englishman.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Films and media==
The event is often attended by reporters and documentary makers from several European countries, along with those from the United States and Japan. Appearances on UK television include &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, where the presenters experienced the game for themselves, and gameshow &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot;, where it was featured as the &quot;Unusual Sport&quot; and later in the show some local Down&#x27;Ards appeared on the &quot;Feel the Sportsman&quot; round.

The 2006 game was attended by a Los Angeles film company acquiring footage for a documentary titled &quot;Wild in the Streets&quot;, produced and co-directed by Peter Baxter and narrated by Sean Bean. The film premiered at the 2012 Slamdance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, USA. The film was released online and on-demand in the US in April 2013.

<text>Ecological genetics is the study of genetics in natural populations. It combines ecology, evolution, and genetics to understand the processes behind adaptation. It is virtually synonymous with the field of molecular ecology.

This contrasts with classical genetics, which works mostly on crosses between laboratory strains, and DNA sequence analysis, which studies genes at the molecular level.

Research in this field is on traits of ecological significance—traits that affect an organism&#x27;s fitness, or its ability to survive and reproduce. Examples of such traits include flowering time, drought tolerance, polymorphism, mimicry, and avoidance of attacks by predators.

Research usually involves a mixture of field and laboratory studies. Samples of natural populations may be taken back to the laboratory for their genetic variation to be analyzed. Changes in the populations at different times and places will be noted, and the pattern of mortality in these populations will be studied. Research is often done on organisms that have short generation times, such as insects and microbial communities.

Allele frequency change in a population changes over time due to various evolutionary forces which can shape the gene structure of populations. Ecological genetics examines these changes in natural populations, focusing on how environmental factors drive genetic variation. Four key mechanisms that drive genetic variation, includes; natural selection, adaptation, gene flow, and genetic drift. These four mechanisms play central roles in this allele frequency change.

Natural selection acts on existing genetic variation, favouring alleles that enhance survival and reproduction. Over time, this leads to adaptation, where populations become better suited to their environments. Adaptation occurs when beneficial alleles increase in frequency due to selective pressures, such as changes in climate, predation, or resource availability. However, not all allele frequency changes result from selection alone. Gene flow, the movement of alleles between populations through migration, can introduce new genetic variation and counteract local adaptation by bringing in alleles less suited to the local environment. In contrast, genetic drift—random fluctuations in allele frequencies—can have strong effects, especially in small populations. Unlike selection, drift is non-adaptive and can lead to the loss of beneficial alleles purely by chance. 

== History ==
Although work on natural populations had been done previously, it is acknowledged that the field was founded by the English biologist E.B. Ford (1901–1988) in the early 20th century. Ford started research on the genetics of natural populations in 1924 and worked extensively to develop his formal definition of genetic polymorphism. Ford&#x27;s magnum opus was &quot;Ecological Genetics&quot;, which ran to four editions and was widely influential.

Other notable ecological geneticists include R. A. Fisher and Theodosius Dobzhansky. Fisher helped form what is known as the modern synthesis of ecology, by mathematically merging the ideas of Darwin and Mendel. Dobzhansky worked on chromosome polymorphism in fruit flies. He and his colleagues carried out studies on natural populations of &quot;Drosophila&quot; species in western USA and Mexico over many years.

Philip Sheppard, Cyril Clarke, Bernard Kettlewell and A.J. Cain were all strongly influenced by Ford; their careers date from the post World War II era. Collectively, their work on lepidoptera and on human blood groups established the field and threw light on selection in natural populations, where its role had been once doubted.

== Research ==

=== Inheritance and natural selection ===
Ecological genetics is closely tied to the concept of natural selection. Many classical ecology works have employed aspects of ecological genetics, investigating how inheritance and the environment affect individuals.

==== Industrial melanism in peppered moths ====
Industrial melanism in the peppered moth &quot;Biston betularia&quot; is a well-known example of the process of natural selection. The typical wing color phenotype of &quot;B. betularia&quot; is black and white flecks, but variant &#x27;melanic&#x27; phenotypes with increased amounts of black also occur. In the nineteenth century, the frequency of these melanic variants increased rapidly. Many biologists proposed explanations for this phenomenon. It was demonstrated in the early 1910s, and again in many later studies, that the melanic variants were a result of dominant alleles at a single locus in the &quot;B. betularia&quot; genome. The proposed explanations, then, centered around various environmental factors that could contribute to natural selection. In particular, it was proposed that bird predation was selecting for the melanic moth forms, which were more cryptic in industrialized areas. H. B. D. Kettlewell investigated this hypothesis extensively in the early 1950s.

Uncertainty surrounding whether birds preyed on moths at all posed an initial challenge, leading Kettlewell to perform a series of experiments with captive birds. These experiments, while inititally unsuccessful, found that when a variety of insects are provided, the birds did preferentially prey on the most conspicuous moths: those with coloration unmatched to their surroundings. Kettlewell then performed field experiments using mark-recapture techniques to investigate the selective predation of moths in their natural habitat. These experiments found that, in woods near industrialized areas, melanic moth forms were recaptured at much higher rates than the traditional lighter-colored forms, while in non-industrialized woods, the reverse held true.

More recent research has further emphasized the role of genetics in the case of industrialized melanism in &quot;B. betularia&quot;. While research had already emphasized the role of alleles in determining wing-color phenotype, it was still unknown whether the melanic alleles had a single origin or had arisen multiple times independently. The use of molecular marking and chromosomal mapping in conjunction with population surveys demonstrated in the early 2010s that the melanic &quot;B. betularia&quot; variants have one single ancestral origin. Additionally, the melanic variants appear to have arisen by mutation from a typical wing-color phenotype.

===Polygenic selection===
Research on ecologically important traits often focuses on single alleles. However, it has been found that in many cases, phenotypes have a polygenic basis - they are controlled by many different alleles. Complex traits in particular are more likely to have a polygenic basis. Advances in genetic technology have allowed scientists to more closely investigate the genetic basis of complex traits, leading to an accumulation of evidence supporting the importance of polygenic control in understanding the evolution of these traits. 

A major line of evidence can be drawn from what we about artificial selection and its influence on traits. Many experiments that have utilized artificial selection have found traits to respond quickly and steadily. If only a small amount of genes have a large influence on a particular trait, this would not be seen. The way that complex traits with continuous variation change in response to natural selection can most reasonably be explained by many alleles having a small effect on the phenotype of interest. 

The prevalence of traits with a polygenic basis poses some issues when researching traits and adaptation in natural populations. Separating the effects of genes, environmental factors, and random genetic drift on traits can be difficult with complex traits.

== Limitations ==
Work of this kind needs long-term funding, as well as grounding in both ecology and genetics. These are both difficult requirements. Research projects can last longer than a researcher&#x27;s career; for instance, research into mimicry started 150 years ago and is still going strongly. Funding of this type of research is still rather erratic, but at least the value of working with natural populations in the field cannot now be doubted.

<doc id="480108" wikidata="Q1228827" url="?curid=480108" title="Disko Island">
<text>Disko Island (, ) is a large island in Baffin Bay, off the west coast of Greenland. It has an area of , making it the second largest island of Greenland after the main island and one of the 100 largest islands in the world.

==Etymology==
The island&#x27;s Greenlandic name means &quot;The Large Island&quot; (from = island).

==Geography==

The island has a length of about , rising to an average height of , peaking at . The port of Qeqertarsuaq (named after the island, and also known as Godhavn) lies on its southern coast. Blæsedalen valley is north of Qeqertarsuaq.

The island is separated from Nuussuaq Peninsula in the northeast by the Sullorsuaq Strait. To the south of the island lies Disko Bay, an inlet bay of Baffin Bay.

==History==

Research indicates that nine large tsunamigenic landslides struck Sullorsuaq Strait in prehistoric times during the Holocene, seven of them from the southern coast of the Nuussuaq Peninsula and two others from the northern coast of Disko Island. Seven of the landslides apparently occurred between about 8020 BC and 6520 BC with unidentified tsunamigenic effects. The two most recent prehistoric landslides generated megatsunamis which struck Alluttoq Island, the first sometime around 5650 BC with a run-up height of , and another that struck around 5350 BC with a run-up height of .

Erik the Red paid the first recorded visit to Disko Island at some time between 982 and 985. The island was used as a base for summer hunting and fishing by Norse colonists.

The coal mining town of Qullissat was founded on the northeast coast of Disko Island in 1924. By 1952 it was a cultural hub and the third-largest settlement in Greenland, with a population of 995. On 15 December 1952, a major landslide on a slope of the mountain Niiortuut () on the southern coast of the Nuussuaq Peninsula generated a tsunami which traveled across Sullorsuaq Strait and struck Qullissat, where it had a run-up height of and inflicted damage on buildings. By 1966, Qullissat was the sixth-largest town in Greenland with a population of 1,400, but it was abandoned in 1972, leaving the northern coast of Disko Island uninhabited.

On 21 November 2000, a large landslide at Paatuut on the southern coast of the Nuussuaq Peninsula generated a megatsunami with a run-up height of near the landslide and at the former site of Qullissat, away, where it inundated the coast as far as inland.

==Geology==
Mineral deposits, fossil finds and geological formations add to interest in the area. One of the interesting geological features is the native iron found at the island. A 22-ton (44,000 lbs; 20 tonnes) lump mixture of iron and iron carbide (cohenite) has been found. There are only a few places on earth where native iron is found which is not of meteoric origin.

There are numerous hot springs on the island. The microscopic animal &quot;Limnognathia&quot;, the only known member of its phylum, was discovered in the Isunngua spring.

==Biodiversity==

Several studies on the meiofauna show high marine interstitial diversity in Disko Island. For instance, the gastrotrich species &quot;Diuronotus aspetos&quot; is found in Iterdla and Kigdlugssaitsut and is so far reported only in Disko Island. It is associated with a rich diversity of other gastrotrichs like &quot;Chaetonotus atrox&quot;, &quot;Halichaetonotus&quot; sp., &quot;Mesodasys&quot; sp., &quot;Paradasys&quot; sp., &quot;Tetranchyroderma&quot; sp., &quot;Thaumastoderma&quot; sp. and &quot;Turbanella&quot; sp.

<doc id="480110" wikidata="Q7387657" url="?curid=480110" title="Sidiq Koya">
<text>Siddiq Muhy&#x27;Ddin Kwaja, officially known as Siddiq Moidin Khoya (29 February 1924 – 25 April 1993) was a Fijian politician, Statesman and Opposition leader. He succeeded to the leadership of the mostly Indo-Fijian National Federation Party (NFP) on the death of the party&#x27;s founder, A. D. Patel, in October 1969, remaining in this post until 1977. He later served a second term as leader of the NFP, from 1984 to 1987.

Koya is credited with his role in paving the way for Fijian independence from Britain in 1970. The National Federation Party had been opposing plans for independence without significant changes to the constitution. The NFP, in particular, wanted a legislature to be elected by universal suffrage from a common electoral roll of all voters – a demand rejected by the main ethnic Fijian politicians, who wanted a communal franchise with parliamentary seats allocated among the different ethnic groups, elected from ethnic electoral rolls. Sidiq Koya was more willing to compromise than his predecessor, and he was instrumental in persuading his party and his people to accept independence with a communal franchise.

== Early life and family==

Sidiq Khoja was born in Ba District to a prominent Muslim Indo-Fijian Malabar Muslims-family, whose parents emigrated from the Indian state of Kerala. He only went to year six in primary school and never saw the doors of a high school. Being a son of a cane farmer he worked his way up and later worked for the law firm of S. B. Patel in Lautoka. He then travelled to Tasmania to obtain his law degree from the University of Tasmania. He and his wife Amina had three children, daughter Shahnaaz and sons Faiyaz and Faizal. Koya has six grandchildren, Aleisha, Benjamin, Elizabeth, Zane, Akif and Farhaan who now reside in Australia, Canada and Fiji.

== Community involvement ==

=== Kisan Sangh ===
In 1956, S.M. Koya went into partnership with N.S. Charmers, who was the legal advisor to the Kisan Sangh. This brought Koya closer to the Kisan Sangh hierarchy, and on 10 February 1957 he was elected the Vice-President of the organisation. In 1958 he was re-elected to the post. Although Koya had initially been accepted with open arms by the Kisan Sangh, which lacked any legally qualified person in its leadership team, differences soon arose between Koya and Ayodhya Prasad, who saw Koya as a threat to his leadership. Ayodhya Prasad managed to get Koya ousted from the Kisan Sangh but paid a heavy price for this as Koya worked against Ayodhya Prasad to have him defeated in the 1959 Legislative Council election.

=== Then India Maunatul Islam Association of Fiji ===
Koya also made contributions to religious and cultural organisations. He served as President and Speaker of the Then India Maunatul Islam Association of Fiji, an organisation representing Muslims of South Indian origin in Fiji. Koya&#x27;s family originated from Kerala, in South India.

=== The Federation of Cane Growers ===
Koya was one of the founding members of the Federation of Cane Growers, formed in 1959 to negotiate the new cane contract with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. He formed close ties with A.D. Patel and rose to prominence as the sugar cane dispute continued. He also involved himself with other industrial disputes in Fiji in 1959 by defending union leaders involved in strikes.

== Legislative Council Elections ==
The Federation Committee contested the 1963 under the banner of the Citizens Federation. Its three candidates, in the sugar cane growing areas, were A.D. Patel, James Madhavan, and Koya himself. All three Citizens Federation candidates were elected. Koya narrowly defeated James Shankar Singh of Ba by 3998 votes to 3480 votes, making him the first Muslim to be elected to the Legislative Council. Koya was responsible for drafting the constitution of the Federation Party which came into existence on 21 June 1964, making it the first political party in Fiji. He easily retained his seat at the 1966 general election and the 1968 by-election.

== Political career==

=== Party Leader and towards Independence ===
Following the death of A.D. Patel in 1969, Koya was elected the leader of the National Federation Party. He adopted a conciliatory style of leadership and soon had an agreement with the leader of the Alliance Party, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, for independence for Fiji. There were those within his party who had opposed his leadership and with the unveiling of the new constitution the opposition from within gained strength. At this time in Fiji&#x27;s history, Koya, the opposition leader, was seen as being too close to the Prime Minister.

=== Split in the National Federation Party ===
The first elections held after independence, in 1972, saw the NFP win 19 of the 52 seats in the House of Representatives. Opposition to Koya from within the party grew and by 1976 the party was divided into two groups when some members of his party expressed support for the Agricultural Landlord and Tenants Bill, which Koya and the NFP officially opposed. (Koya and his people did not oppose the changes but suggested the party abstain and thus defeat the bill, which required a 75% majority to help it to pass.) The differences were swept under the carpet for the parliamentary elections of March 1977. Koya led his National Federation Party (NFP) to a narrow victory, and would have become Prime Minister, but internal party strife resulted in the Governor General, Ratu Sir George Cakobau, calling on the defeated Prime Minister, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, to form a new government. As seen from Brij V Lal&#x27;s book on the life of Jai Ram Reddy called &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot;, all 26 members of the National Federation Party sent a signed memo, that is signed by each of them to the then Governor General pledging their support for Koya. The governor General was concerned that Sakeasi Butadroka, the Fijian leader who destroyed Mara&#x27;s majority by splitting 25% of the Fijian votes, would fulfil his promise made 7 April 1977 at the Old Suva Town Hall in his midday speech that if an Indian was elected Prime Minister Blood would flow. He pointed to his signature red tie. The Governor General who has asked the NFP to form government then changed his mind and appointed Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara as the Prime minister. There was no internal strife as Koya and his Parliamentary Caucus spent Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday pleading to Ratu Mara to form a coalition government and to remain Prime Minister. This &quot;strife among us&quot; was not evident in those four days. Koya had been opposed in the election by R. D. Patel, brother of the late leader of NFP and had won by a narrow margin. A second election to resolve the impasse was held in September that year, resulting in a heavy defeat for the NFP after it had split into two factions known as the Dove and Flower factions. Koya lost his parliamentary seat to Jai Ram Reddy, who became the new leader of the NFP. It is also often rumored that Koya had been backstabbed by his own party members who formed the flower faction on the basis that they did not want a muslim as the Prime Minister. Koya&#x27;s Dove faction had won only 3 seats compared to 12 won by the Flower faction.

=== Return to Leadership of NFP ===
The NFP had re-united for the 1982 elections and Koya regained his seat in the general election held that year. After the resignation of Jai Ram Reddy, Koya returned to the leadership of the NFP in 1984. He was not far from controversy, and after being accused of favouring his own supporters, lost a crucial by-election in 1985. With the emergence of Fiji Labour Party (FLP), the NFP lost ground and he resigned from the leadership of the NFP before the 1987 election, when the NFP formed an electoral coalition with the Fiji Labour Party, under the leadership of Timoci Bavadra.

<doc id="480118" wikidata="Q311363" url="?curid=480118" title="Al-Uzza">
<text>Al-ʻUzzā ( or Old Arabic, ) was one of the three chief goddesses of Arabian religion in pre-Islamic times and she was worshipped by the pre-Islamic Arabs along with al-Lāt and Manāt. A stone cube at Nakhla (near Mecca) was held sacred as part of her cult. She is mentioned in Qur&#x27;an 53:19 as being one of the goddesses who people worshipped.
Al-ʻUzzā, like Hubal, was called upon for protection by the pre-Islamic Quraysh. &quot;In 624 at the &#x27;battle called Uhud&#x27;, the war cry of the Qurayshites was, &quot;O people of Uzzā, people of Hubal!&quot;. Al-‘Uzzá also later appears in Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s account of the alleged Satanic Verses.

The temple dedicated to al-ʻUzzā and the statue was destroyed by Khalid ibn al Walid in Nakhla in 630 AD.

== Cult of al-‘Uzzá ==
According to the &quot;Book of Idols&quot; (&quot;Kitāb al-Aṣnām&quot;) by Hishām ibn al-Kalbī

:The Quraysh used to circumambulate the Ka‘bah and say,
::By al-Lāt and al-ʻUzzā,
::And al-Manāt, the third idol besides.
::Verily they are &quot;al-gharānīq&quot;
::Whose intercession is to be sought.
This last phrase is said to be the source of the so-called Satanic Verses; the Arabic term &quot;al-gharānīq&quot; is translated as &quot;most exalted females&quot; by Faris in the &quot;Book of Idols&quot;, but he annotates this much-argued &quot;hapax legomenon&quot; in a footnote as &quot;lit. Numidian cranes.&quot;

Each of the three goddesses had a separate shrine near Mecca. The most prominent Arabian shrine of al-ʻUzzā was at a place called Nakhlah near Qudayd, east of Mecca toward aṭ-Ṭā’if; three trees were sacred to her there (according to a narration through al-&#x27;Anazi Abū-‘Alī in the &quot;Kitāb al-Aṣnām&quot;.) &quot;‘Abdu l-‘Uzzá&quot; [&quot;Slave of the Mightiest One&quot;] was a favourite proper name before the advent of Islam. The name al-‘Uzzá appears as an emblem of beauty in late pagan Arabic poetry quoted by Ibn al-Kalbī, and oaths were sworn by her.

Susan Krone suggests that the identities of al-‘Uzzá and al-Lāt were fused in central Arabia uniquely.

On the authority of ‘Abdu l-Lāh ibn ‘Abbās, at-Tabari derived &quot;al-ʻUzzā&quot; from &quot;al-‘Azīz&quot; &quot;the Mighty&quot;, one of the 99 &quot;beautiful names of Allah&quot; in his commentary on Qur&#x27;an 7:180.

== Destruction of temple ==
Shortly after the Conquest of Mecca, Muhammad began efforts to eliminate the last cult images reminiscent of pre-Islamic practices.

He sent Khalid ibn Al-Walid during Ramadan 630 AD (8 AH) to a place called Nakhlah, where the goddess al-ʻUzzā was worshipped by the tribes of Quraish and Kinanah. The shrine&#x27;s custodians were from Bani Shaiba. Al-ʻUzzā was considered the most important goddess in the region.

Arab Muslim historian Ibn al-Kalbī ( CE) tells how Muhammad ordered Khālid ibn al-Walīd to kill the pre-Islamic Arabian goddess al-ʿUzzā, who was supposed to inhabit one of three trees:
: Khalid destroyed the first one, returned to Muhammad to report. Muhammad replied, asking whether something eventful happened, which Khalid denied. The same thing happened after cutting down the second tree. When Khalid was about to destroy the last tree, a woman with wild hair appeared, who is called &quot;al Uzza&quot; by al-Sulami the custodian of al-Uzza, and ordered to kill Khalid. Khalid struck the woman down with his sword, and chopped her head off at which she fell down in a pile of ashes. Khalid went on to kill Sulami and cut the last tree. When he returned to Muhammad, Muhammad is supposed to have said that the woman was al-Uzza, and she shall never be worshiped again.

== Influence in other religions ==
=== Uzza the garden ===
According to &quot;Easton&#x27;s Bible Dictionary&quot;, Uzza was a garden in which Manasseh and Amon were buried (2 Kings 21:18, 26). It was probably near the king&#x27;s palace in Jerusalem, or may have formed part of the palace grounds. Manasseh may have acquired it from someone of this name. Another view is that these kings were culpable of idolatry and drew the attention of Ezekiel.

<text>William John Charles (27 December 1931 – 21 February 2004) was a Welsh footballer who played as a centre-forward or as a centre-back. Best known for his first stint at Leeds United and Juventus, he was rated by many as the greatest all-round footballer ever to come from Wales. Charles is sometimes considered to be one of the greatest footballers in history.

John Charles began his career at Leeds United, having moved there in 1949 from his hometown club, Swansea Town. He was equally adept as a defender or a forward, due to his strength, pace, technique, vision, ability in the air and eye for goal. After returning from his National Service in 1952, Charles began to be used more often as a forward, and he was the Second Division&#x27;s top scorer in 1954. The following year, he was named club captain; in his first season as captain, he led the club to second place and promotion. Charles ended the 1956–57 season as the First Division&#x27;s top scorer and an eighth-place finish for Leeds. In the summer of 1957, Charles joined Juventus, where he partnered Giampiero Boniperti and Omar Sívori, with the trio becoming known as &quot;The Holy Trident&quot;. In his five seasons with the club, he won the &quot;scudetto&quot; three times and the Coppa Italia twice; he was also the &quot;capocannoniere&quot; winner for the 1957–58 season. In 1962, Charles returned to Leeds, but his time there proved unsuccessful as he was accustomed to the style of play in Italy, and by the end of the year, he had joined Roma. Charles moved back to his native country to play for Cardiff City, and ended his career in non-league football in player-manager roles at Hereford United and Merthyr Tydfil. He was never cautioned nor sent off during his entire career, owing to his philosophy of never kicking nor intentionally hurting opposing players. This led to the nickname he acquired while playing for Juventus, &quot;Il Gigante Buono&quot; (The Gentle Giant). In 1998, he was included in the Football League 100 Legends, and in 2002, he was one of the inaugural inductees to the Football Hall of Fame.

He played for the Welsh national team over fifteen years, from 1950 to 1965. Alongside his brother, Mel Charles, he was a member of the Welsh squad at the 1958 FIFA World Cup. At the tournament, he scored in a 1–1 draw with Hungary, but he was injured in a play-off match against the same opposition. Ruled out of the quarter-final against Brazil, Wales lost the match 1–0, with Pelé scoring the winner. Wales manager Jimmy Murphy opined that had Charles been fit, Wales might have won the match.

For its 50th anniversary in 2004, UEFA asked each of its then 52 member associations to nominate one player as the single most outstanding player of the period 1954–2003, and Charles was chosen as the Golden Player of Wales by its national association in November 2003.

==Early career==
Charles was born in the Cwmbwrla district of Swansea during late 1931. Charles would play football as a child, with younger brother Mel Charles who also went on to become a professional, later playing alongside each other for the Welsh national team. The brothers grew up on Alice Street in Swansea, being neighbours of fellow future Welsh internationals Ernie Jones, Mel Nurse, and Jackie Roberts.

While still at school, Charles joined the boys section of the local team Swansea Town, who later became Swansea City. When he left school at age 14 he was taken onto the groundstaff at Vetch Field, yet because of his young age Third Division Swansea never gave him a first-team call up. His only senior appearances came for the reserve side in the Welsh Football League.

==Club career==
===Leeds United===
While playing for Gendros, a local youth club, he was scouted by Leeds United and given a trial in September 1948. At his trial he impressed and duly signed for them at the age of 17, relocating to Yorkshire.

Then manager of Leeds United, Major Buckley, selected Charles in a variety of positions including right-back, centre-half and left-half for Leeds Reserves. Charles made his first team debut as a centre back for Leeds in a friendly versus Dumfries club Queen of the South on 19 April 1949. Charles was tasked with marking the incumbent Scotland centre forward Billy Houliston, who ten days previously at Wembley, had run the England defence ragged as the Scots won 3–1. The score at Elland Road was 0–0. After the game, Houliston said 17-year-old Charles was &quot;the best centre half I&#x27;ve ever played against&quot;. Charles made his league debut against Blackburn Rovers also in April 1949, playing at centre-half. From 1950 until 1952, Charles was away on National Service with the 12th Royal Lancers at Carlisle. The army allowed him to turn out for Leeds, but also saw to it that he played for them, and in 1952, Charles skippered his side to the Army Cup. It was during this period that he had operations to repair cartilages in both knees.

After his return to the Leeds side in November 1951, Charles played at centre-forward and centre half. This prompted a debate as to where Charles should play in the team, but he remained at centre-half until the 1952–53 season. In October 1952, he was switched to centre forward and immediately started to score, with 11 goals in 6 games. In 1955, he was appointed club captain and during the 1955–56 season, Leeds won promotion to the First Division. Charles was in sparkling form, scoring 29 goals in 42 appearances. In the following season, Charles scored a new club top flight record tally of 38 goals in 40 league appearances as Leeds secured an 8th-place finish in the first division, before finally moving away from the club. His influence on Leeds&#x27; success during his final season was so strong, reporters nicknamed the club &quot;John Charles United&quot;. In total, he scored 150 league goals in eight years for Leeds, including a club record 42 goals in 39 appearances during the 1953–54 season. He remains the second highest all time goal scorer for Leeds after Peter Lorimer.

===Juventus===

In August 1957, he joined the Italian club Juventus for a then British record £65,000 transfer fee, almost doubling the previous record. The transfer was notable as Charles became one of the first British professional players to be signed for an overseas team after John Fox Watson led the way moving from Fulham to Real Madrid in 1948.

His debut came on 8 September 1957 against Hellas Verona. Goals from Giampiero Boniperti and Omar Sívori had made the score 2–2, when up popped Charles to score the winner. The following week, he scored the only goal in the victory over Udinese, and he then hit the decisive strike in a 3–2 victory over Genoa. He had been the match-winner in his first three games.

In his first season in Italy, Charles was Serie A&#x27;s top scorer with 28 goals, and was voted player of the season as Juventus won the &quot;scudetto&quot;. He played in Turin for five years, scoring 108 goals in 155 matches, winning the &quot;scudetto&quot; (Italian league championship) three times, and the Coppa Italia twice. He placed third in the Ballon d&#x27;Or in 1959, the highest position for a Welsh footballer. His prolific partnership with Sívori and Boniperti in Juventus&#x27;s front-line earned the trio the nicknames &quot;The Holy Trident&quot; and &quot;The Magical Trio&quot;; Charles was also dubbed &quot;Il Gigante Buono&quot; (The Gentle Giant) during his five seasons with the club, due to his size and fair play. The respect Charles earned from Juventus fans was shown when, on the occasion of the club&#x27;s centenary in 1997, they voted him the club&#x27;s best-ever foreign player.

===Return to Leeds United===
Following his time at Juventus, Don Revie paid a club record £53,000 to secure the return of Charles to Yorkshire. As a result of the excitement this created, Leeds United raised admission prices for the start of the 1962–63 season. Charles second spell at Elland Road was less successful. After five years in Italy, he found it difficult to adjust to life and football back in Britain.

===Roma===
After 11 games and three goals – a shadow of his former strike rate – Charles was sold for £70,000 to Roma. Initially, the move was a success and Charles scored within fifteen minutes of his first game for Roma, in a match against Bologna. The early promise was never fulfilled, however, and Charles was on the move again a year later.

===Later career===
He left to join Cardiff City where he stayed until 1966, which marked the end of his league career. He later became manager of Hereford United, Merthyr Tydfil and the Swansea City youth team, and technical director of the Canadian team Hamilton Steelers, whom he became coach of midway through the 1987 season.

==International career==
Charles first played for the Welsh national team shortly after his 18th birthday.

He played for Wales at the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden – the first time the nation qualified for the competition. It was also the only time all four of the Home Nations qualified for the same World Cup, though only Wales and Northern Ireland made it past the group stage. Wales remained undefeated in the group stage, battling to draws with Hungary (thanks to a Charles goal), Mexico, and eventual runners-up Sweden. As Hungary also recorded three points, a play-off match ensued, and Wales came from behind at the Råsunda Stadium to advance with a 2–1 win; however, Charles was injured in the match and missed out on the rest of the tournament. Wales were eventually knocked out by Brazil in the quarter-finals thanks to a goal by Pelé in the 66th minute: the Brazilians went on to win the competition. Wales manager Jimmy Murphy said that &quot;with John Charles in the side we might have won&quot;.

In total for Wales, Charles made 38 appearances and scored 15 goals.

Charles played for the Great Britain team against Ireland in 1955.

==Player profile==
===Style of play===
Regarded as one of the greatest British footballers of all-time, Charles was a versatile footballer who was capable of playing both as a centre-forward and as a centre-back. As a striker, he was renowned for being a prolific goalscorer, as he was capable of scoring with either foot, courtesy of his powerful and accurate shot; due to his height, physique, and strength, as well as his heading power and accuracy, he also excelled in the air, which made him an aerial goal threat. Despite his size, he was also a fast player, with good technical skills and passing ability, which allowed him both to score and create goals. In addition to his ability, he was also known for his correct behaviour on the pitch, which along with his stature, earned him the nickname &quot;Il Gigante Buono&quot; (The Gentle Giant).

===Legacy===
In the foreword for Charles&#x27; autobiography, Sir Bobby Robson described him as &quot;incomparable&quot; and classed him among the all-time footballing greats such as Pelé, Diego Maradona and George Best, saying &quot;Incomparable. John wasn&#x27;t only one of the greatest footballers who ever lived. He was one of the greatest men ever to play the game.&quot; He also noted that Charles is the only footballing great to be world class in two very different positions. Giampiero Boniperti, the captain of Juventus when Charles had joined the &quot;Bianconeri&quot;, spoke of the Welshman&#x27;s nature as a person: &quot;I would say he was from another world because of his human qualities. John was one of the most loyal and honest people I have ever met, a very special person. He managed to keep the whole team united, and any quarrels or arguments quietened down as soon as he appeared on the pitch or in the dressing room.&quot; Jack Charlton said of his former teammate, &quot;John Charles was a team unto himself. People often say to me, &#x27;Who was the best player you ever saw?&#x27;, and I answer that it was probably Eusébio, Di Stéfano, Cruyff, Pelé or our Bob. But the most effective player I ever saw, the one that made the most difference to the performance of the whole team, was without question John Charles.&quot; Charles&#x27; sporting behaviour led international referee Clive Thomas to say &quot;If you had 22 players of John&#x27;s calibre, there would be no need for referees – only time-keepers.&quot;

In 1998, the Football League, as part of its centenary season celebrations, included Charles on its list of 100 League Legends. In 2002, Charles became an inaugural inductee to the English Football Hall of Fame. On 29 November 2003, to celebrate UEFA&#x27;s Jubilee, he was selected as the Golden Player of Wales by the Football Association of Wales as their most outstanding player of the past 50 years. In 2004, Charles was voted at number 19 in the &quot;100 Welsh Heroes&quot; poll. On 7 March 2018, Charles had one of Great Western Railway&#x27;s Intercity Express Trains named after him. In August 2019, a social housing complex named &quot;Clos John Charles&quot; was opened on the site of a former primary school in Cwmbwrla, Swansea.

The John Charles Lounge in Aberystwyth Town&#x27;s ground is named after Charles. The John Charles Centre for Sport in Leeds is named after Charles. The West stand at Elland Road is named &quot;The John Charles Stand&quot; and the entrance lobby to the Banqueting Suite attached to the back of the stand contains a bust of Charles, in memory of all he did for the club. A street near Elland Road in the Lower Wortley area of Leeds is named John Charles Way.

==Personal life and death==
Charles was married twice during his life. In 1953, he married Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; White; the couple had four sons together. They divorced in 1982. In 1988, Charles married Glenda Vero, whom he remained married to until his death in 2004. The Charles name continued in football through nephew Jeremy Charles, who also represented Wales, and grandson Jake Charles, who has represented Wales at youth level.

Following his retirement from football, Charles became the landlord of the New Inn public house on Elland Road, Churwell, Leeds which later was also managed by another Leeds United player and Wales international, Byron Stevenson. On 16 June 2001, as part of that year&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire &quot;for services to Association Football&quot;. Until shortly before his death he continued to attend every Leeds United home game. In 2002, he was made a vice-president of the Football Association of Wales, and in 2003, he was granted the freedom of the city of Swansea. There was a campaign to knight Charles, but it never came to fruition.

In January 2004, he suffered a heart attack shortly before an interview for Italian television, and required the partial amputation of one foot for circulation reasons before he was returned to Britain. He died in Pinderfields Hospital, Wakefield, West Yorkshire, early on 21 February 2004. His widow, Glenda, bequeathed his ashes to the city of Swansea.

<text>Jai Ram Reddy, CF (12 May 1937 – 29 August 2022) was an Indo-Fijian politician, who had a distinguished career in both the legislative and judicial branches of the Fijian government. In 1998, he received Fiji&#x27;s highest honour, the Companion of the Order of Fiji, in recognition of his services to his country.

As leader of the National Federation Party (NFP), he was Leader of the Official Opposition from 1977 to 1983, and again from 1992 to 1999. He went on to serve as President of the Fiji Court of Appeal. He held this post briefly in 2000, and again from 2002 to 2003. On 31 January 2003, the United Nations General Assembly elected him as a member of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, which is responsible for the prosecution of war crimes. He died on 29 August 2022.

== Early life and career ==

The eldest of five children born to Pethi and Yenkattama Reddy, Jai Ram Reddy was born at Lautoka Hospital on 12 May 1937. Both his paternal grandfather, Byanna Reddy, a (Kshatriya) from the Cuddapah District in what is now Andhra Pradesh, and his maternal grandfather, Iyyappa Reddy, a social worker and a founder of the Lovu Sangam Primary School, emigrated to Fiji in 1903 on the Elbe III.

Educated initially at Sri Vivekananda High School in Nadi and then at DAV College in Suva, Reddy enrolled in the University Entrance class at Wellington Technical College, New Zealand, in April 1955, and was the only non-accredited student in the college to pass the examination that year. He went on to enroll in the Law faculty of Wellington&#x27;s Victoria University in 1956, graduating in 1960, when he was admitted to the New Zealand bar. He was subsequently admitted to the bar in Fiji the following year. From 1961 to 1966 he was Staff Solicitor and Associate at the law firm of A. D. Patel &amp; Co in Nadi, Fiji. From 1966 to 1968, he served as Crown Counsel and was Principal Legal Officer in the Attorney-General&#x27;s Office from 1968 to 1970. He was the senior partner in a law firm of Stuart Reddy &amp; Co of Lautoka, Fiji. From 1988 to 1997, he was sole practitioner in Lautoka.

== Political career ==

Reddy entered politics when he was appointed to the Senate, in 1972, by the then leader of the opposition, Sidiq Koya. In 1976 he was instrumental in bringing the two factions of the party together.

Reddy replaced Sidiq Koya as leader of the NFP in September 1977, following major internal strife which had resulted in the party&#x27;s missing out on forming the government despite its narrow victory in the election of March 1977, and its subsequent crushing defeat in a second election held to resolve the political stalemate in September. Under his leadership, the NFP made substantial gains in the election of 1982, but fell short of ousting the longtime Prime Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, and was subsequently deposed as party leader in favour of Koya in 1983. Reddy briefly served as Attorney-General and Minister for Justice in the Bavadra government, in April and May 1987. Following the military coups of 1987, however, he again took over the leadership of the NFP, and continued to lead the party throughout the 1990s. In the elections of 1992 and 1994, the NFP won a majority of the 27 seats in the House of Representatives then reserved for Indo-Fijians.

In the late 1990s, Reddy decided to negotiate with the Prime Minister, General Sitiveni Rabuka, on amending the 1990 constitution, which was widely perceived as racist and was compared by many to South Africa&#x27;s apartheid regime, as it guaranteed the political supremacy of ethnic Fijians. As a result of these negotiations, assisted by Sir Paul Reeves, a former Governor General of New Zealand, a new constitution emerged, which removed all discriminatory provisions against Indo-Fijians (except the mainly honorary office of President, which remained reserved for a Fijian hereditary Chief). This was considered Reddy&#x27;s crowning achievement. His glory was short-lived, however. In the ensuing election of 1999, he entered into an electoral pact with his former enemy, Rabuka, an alliance which proved to be his undoing. Many Indo-Fijians had not forgiven Rabuka for carrying out the coups of 1987 and for his role in the subsequent adoption of the 1990 constitution, and the NFP lost all of its seats. Reddy&#x27;s parliamentary career of some twenty years had come to an end.

== Reddy as judge ==

In 2000, Reddy was appointed President of the Fijian Court of Appeal. He resigned in the wake of the overthrow of the constitutional government of Fiji in 2000, but was reappointed to the post in January 2002. He resigned the Presidency of the Court of Appeal on 18 April 2003 to take up his position with the Rwanda tribunal, but remained a member of the court. Fiji Television reported on 14 June 2006 that Reddy&#x27;s term on the Rwanda tribunal, along with that of ten other members, which had been due to expire in May 2007, had been extended to December 2008.

== Personal life ==

Reddy married Anne, a geology professor&#x27;s daughter in 1962. They had a son, Sanjay, and a daughter, Helen. After separating from Anne in 1970, Reddy remarried in 1972 to Chandra Wati Singh, a Hansard reporter in the Legislative Council of Fiji. They had a daughter, Sandhya, and a son, Prashant.

<doc id="480123" wikidata="Q5992950" url="?curid=480123" title="Ignite (youth programme)">
<text>Ignite is a program for gifted and talented young people in South Australia, created in 1997 and formerly known as SHIP (Students with High Intellectual Potential). It is administered by the South Australian Department of Education and Children&#x27;s Services.

==How the program works==
At the beginning of the school year in South Australia (i.e. January), DfE (Department for Education) advertises for Year 5 and Year 6 applicants to take part in the program in the following year. The applicants are charged $100 and take a test made up of reading comprehension, written literacy, mathematics and an Abstract Reasoning test at one of the three participating schools Aberfoyle Park High School, Glenunga International High School, or The Heights School. The best of the students who completed the test are notified later in the year (usually in the first term). Students are ranked on their performance and an aggregate is determined. The test is designed by ACER (Australian Council for Educational Research). Students who are eligible for school card do not pay the $100.

The top 25 students are given a chance to &quot;skip&quot; year 9 with the Ignite compacted course, these student can pick any of the following courses if they do not wish to do compacted: Maths accelerated (rank 25-50 needed), English accelerated (rank 50-75 needed) and Broad focus (75-100, or the waiting list, which does not &quot;skip&quot; any subject but does go into deeper study). None of the courses are forced on the students, and they are allowed to pick another course, but the new course cannot be the compacted course if the student did not receive an offer.(e.g. A maths student cannot move to compacted).

==Programs==
As well as the Ignite compacted program, there is also Maths accelerated, English Accelerated and Broad focus, which is similar to the compacted program, except that children in this program do not &quot;skip&quot; year nine.

<text>Ratu [[Sir]] Penaia Kanatabatu Ganilau (28 July 1918 – 15 December 1993) was a Fijian politician who served as the first President of Fiji, serving from 8 December 1987 until his death in 1993. He had previously served as Governor-General of Fiji, representing Elizabeth II, Queen of Fiji, from 12 February 1983 to 15 October 1987.

==Education and early career==
Ganilau was educated at the Northern Provincial School and the Queen Victoria School. In 1939 he was a member of the Fiji rugby team that toured New Zealand, earning a cap in a 14–4 win over New Zealand Maori on 16 September. During World War II he served as a company commander. He subsequently graduated from the Devonshire Course for administration officers at Wadham College, Oxford University in 1946.

Returning to Fiji, he joined the Colonial Administration Service the following year and served as a District Officer from 1948 to 1953. The following three years were spent in the Royal Fiji Military Forces. He fought in the Malayan Emergency, earning a Distinguished Service Order. He retired in 1956 with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He then became the &quot;Roko Tui Cakaudrove&quot;, his first administrative position. He became a nominated member of the Legislative Council in 1959 and subsequently returned to the civil service and became Deputy Secretary for Fijian Affairs in 1961.

== Political career ==

In 1963, in the first elections in which ethnic Fijians voted directly, Ganilau was elected to the Legislative Council. He did not stand in the 1966 elections, but when responsible government was instituted in 1967, he was appointed Minister for Fijian Affairs and Local Government, serving until 1970. He subsequently served as Minister for Home Affairs, Lands and Mineral Resources from 1970 to 1972, when he became Minister for Communications, Works and Tourism. In 1973, he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister, a position he was to hold for the next decade; during this time, he also served as Minister for Home Affairs (1975–1983) and as Minister for Fijian Affairs and Rural Development (1977–1983). In 1983 he became Governor-General.

==Last Governor-General, first President==

Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau was to be Fiji&#x27;s last Governor-General. Two military coups were carried out in 1987 by Lieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka. After the first coup on 14 May, Ganilau defiantly refused to give up the office of Governor-General. Attempting to uphold the constitution, he tried to return Fiji to parliamentary democracy, but a second coup forced him to resign as Governor-General on 15 October 1987, with the ending of Fiji&#x27;s monarchy.

In his letter of resignation, addressed to Queen Elizabeth II, Ganilau wrote: &quot;With humble duty, I wish to submit to you the following advice, acting in my capacity as your representative in Fiji. Owing to the uncertainty of the political and constitutional situation in Fiji, I have now made up my mind to request Your Majesty to relieve me of my appointment as Governor-General with immediate effect. This I do with utmost regret, but my endeavours to preserve constitutional government in Fiji have proved in vain, and I can see no alternative way forward. With the deepest respect, Penaia Ganilau, Governor-General.&quot;

On 8 December 1987, Ratu Ganilau was appointed the first president of the new Republic of Fiji. He saw to the appointment of the interim civilian government that was to lead Fiji for a five-year transitional period of constitutional change. During this time, he presided over the promulgation of the Fijian constitution of 1990. The first general elections since the crisis of 1987 were held in 1992. He remained President and head of state until his death in 1993, though ill-health had forced him to hand over most of his day-to-day functions to the vice-president, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, in 1992. He remained the official President until he died.

== Honours ==

Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau was awarded many honours throughout his lifetime. These included the DSO (1956), OBE (1960), Companion of the CMG (1968, CVO (1970), KBE (1974), KCVO (1982), and GCMG (1983). He also received an honorary doctorate in education in 1974.

== Personal details ==

A scion of the chiefly Ai Sokula clan, Ganilau was installed in 1988 as the fourteenth Tui Cakau, the traditional ruler of Cakaudrove Province. As such, he was recognised as the paramount chief of the Tovata Confederacy, covering much of northern and eastern Fiji, making him one of the three highest-ranking chiefs in the Fijian peerage.

Ganilau was married three times and had two daughters and six sons, of whom one, Ratu Epeli Ganilau, followed in his footsteps by pursuing a political career of his own. As a statesman, Ganilau was regarded as a moderate conservative, upholding the traditions of the chiefly system but embracing modern political institutions. He died at the age of 75 on 15 December 1993 in Washington, D.C., where he was receiving medical treatment.

<doc id="480129" wikidata="Q12416358" url="?curid=480129" title="Vice-chancellor">
<text>A vice-chancellor (commonly called a VC) serves as the chief executive of a university in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Kenya, other Commonwealth countries, and some universities in Hong Kong. In Scotland, Canada, and the Republic of Ireland, the chief executive of a university is usually called a principal or (especially in the Republic of Ireland) a president, with &quot;vice-chancellor&quot; being an honorific associated with this title, allowing the individual to bestow degrees in the absence of the chancellor. In Northern Ireland, a Vice-Chancellor of a university also usually has the subsidiary titles of either President or Principal; the title is Vice-Chancellor and President at The Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast.

The role of the VC contrasts with that of the chancellor, who is usually a prominent public figure who acts as a ceremonial figurehead only (e.g., the chancellor of the University of Cambridge for 36 years was Prince Philip), while the vice-chancellor is the chief executive. An assistant to a vice-chancellor is called a pro-vice-chancellor or deputy vice-chancellor; these were traditionally academics who were elected to take on additional responsibilities in addition to their regular teaching and research for a limited time, but are now increasingly commonly full-time appointments. In some universities (e.g. in Australian universities: Deakin University, Macquarie University), there are several deputy vice-chancellors subordinate to the vice-chancellor, with &quot;pro-vice-chancellor&quot; being a position at executive level ranking below &quot;deputy vice-chancellor&quot;.

==Vice-chancellor by countries==
===Australia===
The executive head of an Australian university is the vice-chancellor, who serves as the university equivalent of a chief executive officer. The vice-chancellor is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the university and reports directly to the University Council, which the chancellor heads. Assisting the vice-chancellor, the roles of deputy vice-chancellors and pro vice-chancellors have emerged to better manage the administrative overhead of the position.

===Canada and Scotland===

Canadian university vice-chancellors almost always carry the title of &quot;president (or equivalent) and vice-chancellor&quot;; likewise, in Scotland, they hold the position of &quot;principal and vice-chancellor&quot; (as do a few Canadian universities such as Queen&#x27;s and McGill). In the Scottish practice, the one individual may have two sets of official robes, reflecting a continuing division of responsibilities between the two posts. The vice-chancellor&#x27;s robes, therefore, should not be worn in the presence of the chancellor but should only be worn when deputizing for the chancellor.

===England, Wales and Northern Ireland===

Almost all chief executives of institutions with university status in England, Wales and Northern Ireland use vice-chancellor as their title. The full titles of the vice-chancellors of Oxford and Cambridge universities, used only in formal address, are &quot;the Reverend the Vice-Chancellor&quot; and &quot;the Right Worshipful the Vice-Chancellor&quot; respectively.

Additional titles are sometimes used alongside vice-chancellor in England and Wales. Most of these involve the use of either &quot;president and vice-chancellor&quot; or &quot;vice-chancellor and president&quot;, and have arisen in the 21st century, although the title of the chief executive of Durham University as &quot;vice-chancellor and warden&quot; dates back to 1937 (and refers back to the use of &quot;warden&quot; as the title of the chief executive of the university from its foundation to 1909). Some examples of the use of &quot;president&quot; include the University of Manchester (in England), where the statutes define the title of the chief executive officer of the university as &quot;President and Vice-Chancellor&quot;, Queen&#x27;s University Belfast (in Northern Ireland) and Cardiff University (in Wales). 

The chief executives of some member institutions of the University of London also use the title vice-chancellor, e.g. Birkbeck, the London School of Economics (as &quot;president and vice-chancellor&quot;) and St George&#x27;s, University of London

===India===
In India, most central and state level universities have a titular head called chancellor who is either an eminent person appointed by the Government of India (in central universities) or provincial governor (in state universities). The head of a university is the vice-chancellor, the highest paid official of the university. Next in command are more than one pro-vice-chancellor in charge of academic as well as administrative and financial affairs. In deemed universities and institutes of national importance, the head of the institution is either called director general or director, the latter designation being more commonly used in academic terms in the subcontinent.

===Bangladesh===
The President of Bangladesh is the titular chancellor of all universities in Bangladesh, public or private. The vice chancellor is the executive head, and his/her deputy, the pro-vice chancellor holds a full-time administrative office.

===Nepal===
The Prime Minister of Nepal is the titular chancellor of most universities in Nepal, public or private. The vice chancellor is the executive head, and along with Registrar holds a full-time administrative office.

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, all the government universities are administered by the vice-chancellor.

===Sudan===
In Sudan and South Sudan, universities are administered by the vice-chancellor.

===Kenya===
In Kenya, chancellors are titular heads of public universities, either appointed by the head of state (president) directly, or, in newly introduced legislation, at the recommendation of senate and alumni of the university. The day-to-day running of universities is the responsibility of the vice-chancellors. &quot;Rector&quot; and &quot;president&quot; are not commonly used terms in university administration.
The vice-chancellor is assisted by a number of high ranking University officials known as Deputy Vice-chancellor, popularly referred to as DVC. The DVC&#x27;s head specific departments of the university such as Finance and Administration, etc.

=== Malaysia ===

In Malaysia, all the government universities are administered by the vice-chancellor.

=== Nigeria ===
In Nigeria, chancellors are ceremonial heads of public universities (mostly traditional monarchs), appointed by the head of state (president), governor of a state (in the case of state-owned universities) or assumed by the owner of a private university. The day-to-day running of universities is the responsibility of the vice-chancellors. There are also pro-chancellors who are government appointees that head the universities&#x27; governing councils. The university governing council is the highest administrative organ of a Nigerian public universities. They approve projects, contracts, recruitments, promotions and are regarded as employer of university workers. They also appoint the principal officers of the university including the vice chancellor. They exercise all these functions on behalf of the &quot;visitor.&quot; The visitor is the president of the federation (for federal universities) and state governors for state-owned universities.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, day-to-day operations of the universities are under the directorship of a president (a provost in the case of Trinity College Dublin). However, the president of each constituent university of the National University of Ireland also has the title of pro-vice-chancellor of the NUI.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, University of Santo Tomas the day-to-day head of the university, as mandated by their duty as the Prior Provincial of the Philippine Dominican Province, the Dominican province that has majority control over the university.

As said earlier, the vice-chancellor or the &quot;grand vice-chancellor of the University of Santo Tomas&quot; is only the deputy to the chancellor of the university, but the chancellor is usually a prominent public figure who is not always in the country (e.g., the chancellor of University of Santo Tomas is the current Master of the Order of Preachers, the current being Very Rev. Fr. Bruno Cadoré, OP, while the rector acts as the day-to-day chief executive). The current vice chancellor of UST is the Prior Provincial of the Philippine Dominican Province, Very Rev. Fr. Napoleon Sipalay, OP. The current rector of the university is Rev. Fr. Herminio V. Dagohoy, OP.

In the University of the Philippines, the chancellor assigns different vice-chancellors to handle different aspects of running the university. There is one for instruction, administration, and community affairs, among others.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, the rektor (rector) is the head of a Swedish university, but the word &quot;vice-chancellor&quot; (&quot;vicekansler&quot;) is often used as the English translation of rektor. The &quot;vice-chancellor&quot; (&quot;vicekansler&quot;) is also an honorary title given to the &quot;rectores magnifici&quot; at the universities of Lund and Uppsala.

University chancellor (&quot;universitetskansler&quot;) is the office of the highest civil servant in the Swedish university system.

===United States===
In the United States, a vice chancellor (typically spelled without a hyphen) is an assistant to a chancellor, who is generally the (actual, not merely ceremonial) head of one campus of a large university which has several campuses. The head of the entire university is the president (the equivalent of a Commonwealth vice-chancellor), the chancellor is in charge of one campus, and a vice chancellor is one of their direct reports responsible for a broad area of authority at one campus. Some systems, such as the California State University and the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education invert this arrangement so that the chancellor is the head of the entire university system, while a vice chancellor is an executive who directly reports to the chancellor and is responsible for a broad area of authority across the entire system.

At the University of the South, the vice chancellor is the administrative head of the university (as well as mayor of the town of Sewanee). The chancellor is a bishop of one of the 28 southeastern Episcopal dioceses that own the university and is elected by the members of the board of trustees. The chancellor neither resides at the university nor holds administrative power; the office of chancellor is a ceremonial one.

<text>Liam Lawlor (19 October 1944 – 22 October 2005) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician. He resigned from the Fianna Fáil in 2000 following a finding by a party standards committee that he had failed to co-operate with its investigation into planning irregularities, and subsequently came into conflict with the Mahon Tribunal.

==Early life==
Lawlor was born in Dublin in 1944. He grew up in Crumlin and was educated at Synge Street CBS and the College of Technology, Bolton Street (now part of the Dublin Institute of Technology). In his youth he played hurling and was on the Dublin minor and the Leinster Railway Cup hurling teams. After college he went into the refrigeration business, running his own company.

==Professional life==
In 1974, he unsuccessfully stood as a candidate in the local elections to Dublin County Council. At the 1977 general election he was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin County West constituency. In 1979, he became a member of Dublin County Council.

At the 1981 general election he lost his Dáil seat in what was now the constituency of Dublin West, regained it in February 1982, but lost it again in the November 1982 general election. Lawlor regained his Dáil seat again at the 1987 general election, and was appointed Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies. He resigned the position in 1989 due to his position as a non-executive director of Food Industries, a company that wished to acquire the Irish Sugar Company. In 1991 he lost his seat on Dublin City Council, and at the 1992 general election he nearly lost his Dáil seat to Tomás Mac Giolla of the Workers&#x27; Party. It is widely believed that Mac Giolla was cheated by Fianna Fáil in the election; the emergence of information that the since disgraced and jailed George Redmond was one of the local government officials who conducted the election count has added weight to this view.

Lawlor was one of a number of local councillors who were called as witnesses before the Mahon Tribunal investigating planning and payments in County Dublin. He admitted receiving sums of money from the lobbyist Frank Dunlop which he stated were political donations and not bribes.

Lawlor was also a European member of the controversial private political group, the Trilateral Commission.

==Corruption==
In the light of allegations of planning corruption, Fianna Fáil established an internal committee on Standards in Public Life. The committee interviewed a number of party members, including Lawlor, but eventually found that Lawlor had failed to co-operate with it by not naming an individual who had furnished him with a donation. On the eve of publication of the committee report in June 2000, Lawlor resigned from the party; however he continued to support the government in Dáil Éireann. He did not stand at the 2002 general election. Lawlor appeared at the Flood Tribunal several times and was imprisoned on three occasions (in January 2001, January 2002 and February 2002, for a total of six weeks) in Mountjoy Prison for contempt of court arising from Orders of the High Court requiring him to co-operate with the tribunal. The final report of the Tribunal, eventually chaired by Justice Alan Mahon, was published on 22 March 2012.

On 7 February 2002 Lawlor was released from jail to make a Dáil appearance during which he ignored unprecedented all-party calls for his resignation. In what the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; described as &quot;one of the most sensational days in the House&quot;, Lawlor was released temporarily by the High Court to mount his own defence during an hour-long debate. Taken into Leinster House in a prison van, Lawlor sat alone at the rear of the Chamber while the five party leaders, in turn, called on him to step down. Instead Lawlor made an aggressive defence of his own position during a 20-minute speech while making no reference at all to the unprecedented joint motion.

Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, said Lawlor had repeatedly let politics down and his position was untenable. Lawlor, he said, had been committed to prison three times and political life was &quot;cheapened&quot; by this. No vote was required as the decision to ask him to resign was unanimous. Lawlor was released by the High Court for about two hours on third day of his 28-day sentence for not co-operating with the Flood Tribunal. As the Dáil sat at 10.30am, Lawlor&#x27;s legal advisers were petitioning the High Court to allow him make his own case to his fellow TDs. High Court president Justice Joseph Finnegan granted the request but laid down strict conditions on Lawlor&#x27;s release, saying he was to be taken from Mountjoy to Leinster House, stay for the debate and then be returned to jail.

==Death==
Lawlor was killed on 22 October 2005, when the Mercedes-Benz car he was being driven in on the way from Sheremetyevo International Airport crashed into a concrete street light on the Leningrad Shosse, the main road between Saint Petersburg and Moscow, twenty-three kilometres from Moscow. Lawlor had been travelling with Julia Kushnir, a Ukrainian legal assistant, aged 29, confirmed by the Lawlor family to be working as Lawlor&#x27;s interpreter in Russia. She was injured in the crash that killed Lawlor. The driver, a Russian businessman, Ruslan Suleymanov, was fatally injured, when he swerved the car to avoid a man and a woman who ran out onto the road in front of it.

The funeral of Lawlor was held in Lucan on 26 October 2005.

===False media claims about the accident===
The Russian police initially reported that the woman in Lawlor&#x27;s car may have been a sixteen-year-old prostitute. The report was the lead in a number of Sunday newspapers. The &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; editor Aengus Fanning apologised to the Lawlor family for the report, following a public outcry on the reportage and condemnation of the publication from the National Union of Journalists. The &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Sunday World&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot;, and a number of British tabloids also published the claim. &quot;The Observer&quot; initially refused to apologise for the error, but on the Tuesday following the accident, the newspaper issued a statement saying that &quot;serious discrepancies&quot; had arisen in the story it had published, and admitted that it had erred, removing the story from its website. The controversial nature of the coverage led to calls for a body to regulate and oversee standards in the Irish press similar to the Press Complaints Commission in the UK.

<text>The culture of Lithuania, dating back to 200 BC, with the settlement of the Balts and has been independent of the presence of a sovereign Lithuanian state.

==Pre-Lithuanian period (before the 10th century AD)==
The Lithuanian nation rose between the 7th and 9th centuries CE. Earlier, the Balts, ancestors of Lithuanians and Latvians, had arrived at the territories between the Dnepr and Daugava rivers and the Baltic Sea. An Indo-European people, the Balts are presumed to have come from a hypothetic original homeland of the Proto-Indo-Europeans; many scientists date this arrival to 3rd millennium BCE.

The Balts, who are believed to have arrived with the main wave of Indo-Europeans, were unconnected with the formation of later Indo-European nations in Southern and Western Europe. Thus, the Balts&#x27; culture is believed to have preserved primeval features of Indo-European culture for a longer time. When later contacts with newly formed European nations increased, differences between the Balts&#x27; primeval culture and the culture of the new European nations were so great that closer cultural interchange was difficult. This resulted in preservation of the Balts&#x27; Indo-European roots but may also have contributed to their isolation.

After the period of Gothic domination in Europe, the culture of the Balts appeared in a more restricted territory between the Wisla and Daugava rivers. Almost anything said about the Balts&#x27; cultural isolation level in these times is speculation, but it was likely decreasing. Still, the Balts conserved forms of ancient Indo-European proto-language until much later times. The most archaic language forms were preserved by the Western Balts, who lived approximately in the territory of later Prussia (today&#x27;s Kaliningrad and north-west Poland). These dialects developed into Old Prussian, which became extinct by the beginning of the 18th century.

The Eastern Balts had less archaic forms of language. For example, some popular simplifications took hold, such as a decrease in the number of verb forms, which presumably happened when the ancient cultural elite lost its influence over the people. It may have taken place, for example, in times of &quot;barbarian&quot; invasions (not later than the 8th century). Later, eastern dialects of Balts developed into the modern Lithuanian and Latvian.

Knowledge about the Balts&#x27; cultural life in these times is scanty. It is known that Balts at the end of this period had a social structure comparable with that of Celtic people in South-West Europe during the 2nd—1st centuries BC.

In the 10th century, religious life of the Balts was not unified, with various forms of cults present. An important feature of Balt culture was willful avoidance of using material attainments in their religious life. Some more complicated forms of architecture, equipment, and literacy were disapproved of, even when these things were allowed by and were well known from neighbouring nations. Religious life was concentrated on verbal tradition, with singing and perhaps with some elements of mystery theatre. Material forms of this life were closely connected with unsophisticated wooden shrines, nature objects ( such as trees and stones), and special ornamented vestments and their accessories.

==Period of the Lithuanian nation rising (10th – 14th centuries)==
The Lithuanian nation began to form in about 7th – 8th centuries CE. The growing difference between Western and Eastern Balts was a result of some cultural modernization of the Eastern Balts even before this period. Differences also grew between northern and southern parts of the Eastern Balts. Lithuanians derived from the southern parts of Eastern Balts till 9th century CE. At this time, the Eastern Balts did not form any political unit. They were divided into some autonomous clans, but culturally and religiously, they were part of the Balts. The common name for them, Lithuanians, was already known.

Historians have occasionally attributed the name &quot;Lithuania&quot; of this period only to one of the Eastern Balts&#x27; tribes. It is not known for certain in what political circumstances Lithuanians acquired their common name, and whether it took place before the beginning of the 11th century, when the name was first mentioned in written sources, or later. 

Traditionally, historians consider religion-based union of the Balts. This theory is supported by historical sources that wrote about existence of centers of religious life (named Romuva, using the present-day variant of this word), concentrated around more significant shrines, holy and mystic areas. Servants of these religious centers have influences on other not central shrines. This influence was based more on authority than on formal structure of organization. Finally, there is some historical data about the main religious center of all Balts. The level of organization and extent of this religious cooperation are under discussion. 
For example, some historians argue that union was more local and included only southern Balts (Lithuanians and Prussians), but Northern Balts (ancestors of Latvians) did not participate in it. Information concerning religious unity is influenced by later Lithuanian and Latvian myths and is not strongly based on historical sources and archaeological research.

The new point of distinguishing the Balts&#x27; nations and their cultural development was the occupation of a significant part of the land by Catholic military orders in the 13th century. The main areas of Western Balts, known under the name of Prussia, were occupied by Teutonic order. Livonian order occupied northern territories, beginning from areas around the Gulf of Riga, creating so-called Livonia.

Therefore, later cultural development of these two and the third unoccupied part of Balts&#x27; areas was different. Old Prussians (Balts) never regained a nation, but the Latvian nation was formed in Livonia. The third unoccupied part was a basis for the Lithuanian nation to form.

Outer aggression forced Baltic nations to form more strict institutions of political life. A Lithuanian state, Lithuania, was founded in 13th century and it included regions of still unoccupied Eastern Balts and remaining Western Balts&#x27; areas (These Western Balts&#x27; ethnic groups are known under names of Yotvingians and Sudovians).

In the middle of the 14th century, Lithuania emerged as a large eastern European state, with former Kievan Rus&#x27; and some Ruthenian regions to the north of it (approximately present Belarus) included. This expansion shows a great political potential of the Lithuanian ruling classes, and this potential could not be reached without respective cultural basis. Christian Ruthenian rulers became some kind of vassals of non-Christian Lithuanian rulers, but culturally the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (G.D.L.) remained bipolar. It consisted of a non-Christian Lithuanian part in North-West (later known as Lithuania Propria) and Eastern Christian Orthodox Ruthenian regions (partial Duchies).

The price of cooperation and recognition of pagan dominance by Ruthenian Orthodoxes in G.D.L. was recognition of wide cultural rights for orthodoxes. These rights included, for example, customs, that Lithuanian dukes had to be christened before taking office in a partial duchy in orthodox parts. Wives of Lithuanian dukes, if they were Ruthenians, stayed orthodox, but Grand Dukes in this case had to ensure that it was possible for his wife to perform orthodox rites and take part in orthodox services. Children of orthodox duchesses officially became observers of their father&#x27;s religion, the old-Lithuanian one in that case. In reality, the religion of the mother could have some (sometimes great) influence.

In this period, both nations of G.D.L. insistently stood on their cultural basis, and the main directions of Lithuanian culture remained unchanged until Christianization. Lithuanian culture stayed far from growing significant literacy in Europe and there were no significant changes, for example, in cult architecture. However, there were some new tendencies too. Religious intolerance, hardly avoidable during religiously-based war as with crusaders, was offset by tolerance to orthodox Christians, so the Lithuanian community stayed tolerant in the cultural and religious sense. There were some attempts to modernize Lithuanian religious life too. For example, there were at least two Christian churches, Catholic and orthodox, both of brick stonework, in Vilnius town. The main shrine of the old-religion in the town was bricked, and not wooden as it was customary.

==The Early Christian period (the end of the 14th to the middle of the 15th century)==

===Cultural changes in higher estates===

The cultural background of formation and persistence of higher estates before Christianization is almost unknown. Christianization of Lithuania brought changes towards European feudalism of the 15th century. It is logical that Lithuanian political culture had some influence of Western European and, especially, Ruthenian feudalism before Christianization, but the christening broke the isolation barrier and the influence became more direct.

Adding to this, the strengthening of Western cultural constituent by Christianization mostly affected political culture. For example, this situation caused interesting effects on jurisprudence. Presence of old Ruthenian legal norms and old Lithuanian traditions as well as coming of Western European legal norms raised various inconveniences, and, in the beginning of the 16th century, the Lithuanian law codex, the First Statute of Lithuania of 1529 was issued. Lithuanian law was exercised in the territory of G.D.L. till 1840, survived not only times of state independence before Union of Lublin of 1569, but the state itself. Thus, since its beginning, Lithuanian law became one of the factors of political integrity of G.D.L. and distinguished Lithuania from other European regions including The Crown of the Polish Kingdom. 

The issuance of the codex is an illustration of two different tendencies in the political elite of G.D.L. The issuance of a written law codex shows a significant western influence on Lithuanian political culture of this time. However, the existence of a Lithuanian system of law shows that cultural differences from Western Europe existed and were acknowledged by ruling classes.

In this time, Lithuanians were getting acquainted with Western European culture and this process had interesting discoveries, which also caused later ruling political ideas. However, the process was not trivial. To become &quot;educated in aristocratic manner&quot; a Lithuanian had to learn at least three languages: Ruthenian, Polish and Latin. German with variety of its dialects and Italian were also used. In reality, this educational objective could not usually be realised, so knowledge of languages (and even cultural orientation) depended on estate of person. Priests and humanitarians learned Latin, merchants learnt German. Polish was preferred by the upper classes, but Ruthenian by the lower strata of nobles.

Since the end of the 14th century, Lithuanians began to study in universities abroad, mostly in Kraków and Prague Universities and, sometimes, in Western European ones. Latin, being a church and humanitarian language, was studied by a number of Lithuanian citizens, mostly Catholics. Latin had a specific reason to be considered interesting for Lithuanian-speaking Lithuanians. Being acquainted with Latin language, Lithuanian humanitarians discovered great similarities between a large number of Lithuanian and Latin words, such as (Lithuanian words are given in their modern form) &quot;aušra – aurora&quot; (a dawn), &quot;dūmas – fumus&quot; (fume, smoke), &quot;mėnesis – mensis&quot; (a month), &quot;senis – senex&quot; (an old man) and so on. This paradoxical similarity was explained by raising an idea that Lithuanian was directly derived from Latin.

This idea, joined with one, maybe earlier, myth about modernized cultural hero &quot;Palemon&quot;, treating him as a Latin language pioneer in earlier pre-Christian Lithuania, has a great influence to the political mindset of noble Lithuanians. It constricted an area of Lithuanian cultural independence, prescribing to Lithuanians affinity with Italics and showing Lithuanian culture as secondary, derivative and mixed. On the other hand, it stimulated patriotism, arguing that Lithuanian popular culture is more &quot;Latin&quot; than Polish and German cultures, so more cultured according to the thinking of that time. This theory raised the prestige of old Lithuania (thought of by neighbors as &quot;pagan&quot; and &quot;barbarian&quot;) firstly in the eyes of Lithuanians themselves, and had the same effect on foreign people (especially Poles, who often treated their mediating in Lithuania&#x27;s Christianization as their own cultural achievement against &quot;eastern&quot; or &quot;pagan&quot; &quot;barbarism&quot;).

Despite using the existence of Lithuanian as a patriotic argument, the usage of the language itself became more and more narrow among the higher strata of nobles. Ruthenian became official after the Christianization, for it had more developed written tradition and, maybe, because of negative attitude of Orthodox nobles towards Lithuanian. During the 15th century, Ruthenian became anchored more in all machinery of the state. As it was common European tendency of the 15th to 17th centuries to make the transition from feudalism to bigger state dominance, the role of the state grew, and prestige of Lithuanian decreased. Documents of Lithuanian law were written in Ruthenian, and it looked normal. Usage of Ruthenian however never reached amounts of official language usage in modern sense, and stayed comparable with usage of Latin in medieval Europe.

On the other hand, not only Ruthenian, but Latin and Polish also narrowed the use of Lithuanian. The Great Duke of Lithuania (later, also the king of Poland) Alexander (as the Great Duke reigned 1492–1506) was taught &quot;Lithuanian&quot;. Even if &quot;Lithuanian&quot; does not mean &quot;Ruthenian&quot;, Alexander would have been the last Great Duke who knew Lithuanian.

The loss of ethnic basis did not reduce patriotism among nobles. The variegate Lithuanian mythology of this time (legend about emigration of &quot;Palemon&quot; from Rome to Lithuania, legend about the founding of the capital of Lithuania Vilnius by Duke Gediminas, and other pieces) had been presented in a spirit of high lucid and virtuous patriotism.

Original architectural style (with Western-European and Byzantine tendencies fused in it) and other manifestations of material culture of this time prove Lithuania as a distinctive cultural unit. However, Lithuania was too little known to Western Europeans in these times.

==The Middle Christian period (The mid 16th – 17th century)==

===The Protestant Reformation in Grand Duchy of Lithuania===
The Protestant Reformation was met differently by different strata of Lithuanians. Ruling classes entered into the Reformation struggles both on pro and contra sides. Urban people in the biggest towns, especially in the Catholic part of Grand Duchy of Lithuania (G.D.L.), were involved in these struggles too, mostly as clients of some persons of influence in the highest stratum. Ordinary people of towns played a role of believers in both Catholic and Protestant churches. From the mid 16th century until the end of the Reformation, sporadic street scuffles between Catholic and Protestant hotheads were often found in these towns. However even in the time of the religious struggle, some partial tolerance existed, and both involved sides proclaimed their abstinence from solving the question in the form of violence. The scuffles always were restricted by officials and they never grew into military conflicts or massacre.

The answer of ordinary country people to the Reformation was their return to &quot;paganism&quot;. After some stabilization, both Catholic Jesuits in G.D.L. and Protestant priests in Prussia describe the situation such, as if Lithuania was christened not before 250 years, but still before the events. It seems likely that both sources described this situation so emphatically in order to simulate bigger merits in rechristening. But it also points out that &quot;pagan&quot; tendencies still existed not only in a subconscious form, but also in performing rites. Besides to it, Christian life had to remain in some forms in country-regions too.

It must also be emphasized that the eastern part of G.D.L. stayed orthodox and orthodox culture had its broad cultural life. The same can be said about Jewish, Tatar and Karait minorities in G.D.L. And all these facts show how variegated and different-sided the cultural situation in Lithuania was.

Adding to this, there were some tendencies in cultural life of G.D.L. not directly connected with religious problems on Reformation background. In the first place, absorption of ideas of Western cultural development in 13th – 16th centuries by nobles (especially, urban ones). Italian cultural ideas of Rinascemento had an especially big influence. They were reflected on literature (written mostly in Latin or Polish, or, in case of orthodox, in Ruthenian).

The main reasons for such exceptional thoughts of Italy were conservatism of Lithuanians and position of the Royal court. All facts showed Italy to Lithuanians as a country of ancient and high culture. Additionally, the Queen of Poland wife of Sigismund I Bona was Italian. Thus despite the growth of Reformation, the cultural orientation hadn&#x27;t changed.

The Reformation in Lithuania remained on the level of political and religious regulating ideas and didn&#x27;t turn into a cultural movement as it did in West European countries. disputes about the Reformation were in the form of peaceful verbal discussion among the highest estate of the country. And in these discussions, the Latin language, eloquence, citation and knowledge of ancient philosophers referred more to Italy than to any other country of Western Europe.

In this atmosphere Catholics decided to use this cultural attachment to improve their position. Their leaders decided to found a unit of Jesuit order in Lithuania (Jesuits were known as masters of discussion and providers of a modernized Latin-based scholastic education). In their turn Jesuits founded the University of Vilnius (officially 1579). Students and graduates of the University soon became true supporters of the Catholic Church.

These events caused the wave of Reformation to fall. With the decrees of Reformation aspirations in the higher strata, activity of reformers among the rest of the urban population was more and more restricted by officials. Thus after the middle of the 17th century, the non-Orthodox part of Lithuania became firmly Catholic (with a Protestant minorities in some towns like Vilnius, Kėdainiai, and Biržai).

===Printing of books===
Another cultural factor, not connected with the reformation directly, was printing of books. The first printed books reached Lithuania before the beginning of the Reformation. But multiplied religious discussions and the increase of printing in Western Europe both activated interest in printing books in Lithuania. The first book in Lithuanian was printed in 1547 in Königsberg (it was a Protestant Catechism by Martynas Mažvydas). The first typography in G.D.L. was opened in approx. 1575 in Vilnius.

Presence of printed books became the signal factor to change ancient Lithuanian cultural attitude against literacy. The necessity of literacy became evident. But in G.D.L. at the same time the growing of literacy coincided with refusal of Lithuanian culture among the nobility.

===Lithuanian-language culture===

====Background====

Lithuanian-language culture derived directly from old Lithuanian culture, among lower strata prevalently. The language barrier caused it to remain isolated from innovations in culture in the 15th century. However the Christianity of higher estates and presence of Christian parishes even in country regions weakened a base of old religion and induced some non direct changes towards culture, based on common European values.

The higher strata in Lithuania for unknown reasons accepted innovations in culture directly, without any attempts at inculturation or adaptation to local cultural thinking. It meant accepting of extraneous culture in all its complexity, with using new language and so on. So, old Lithuanian culture (or, as a later form, Lithuanian-language culture) was negated and rejected by a part of the population in Lithuanian part of G.D.L., especially by the highest estates since approx. middle 15th century. This situation became a serious impediment to Lithuanian-language culture. Lithuanians of lower estates could not become acquainted with European Christian culture, but their peculiar cultural life was strongly slowed too. So all later facts of Lithuanian cultural life till the middle of the 19th century were more or less sporadic.

National Lithuanian culture did not become a factor of unification of Lithuanian elite during this period. Christianity was declared then as such a factor, but different European cultural influences made this idea complex. There were followers of Polish, German, Italian cultures, and Protestants and Catholics contested in Lithuania in that time. And both orthodoxes and Jews, even if they stayed a bit in a side, contributed to all this variety. - But this situation saved Lithuanian-language culture as well. Being strictly negated, it also did not have clear directions of change and stayed original. In its turn this having no direction was dangerous for self-isolation and remaining stagnate without creative flight.

When the Catholic Church (or the Lutheran one, if we speak about Lithuanians in Prussia) became a provider of new ideas for Lithuanian people, it became something like a window to the extraneous world. It&#x27;s a question how much this role was accepted voluntary by the church. Some historians argue that it was made by pressure of rivalry between Catholics and Protestants and it weakened when Reformation struggles decreased.

At any rate, the other, opposite to negating Lithuanian culture, tendency had its supporters too. Even more, these two tendencies, the inculturating and the negating one, remained as two main components in Lithuanian culture till the beginning of the 19th century and have their evident consequences now.

====The development====
Changes of old Lithuanian culture became mostly evident in a sphere of religion. We know only approximately what new elements had been introduced into (old) Lithuanian culture, clothing and so on in the beginning of this period. But the popular-kind simplifying (or becoming more rustic) of old Lithuanian religion is an unquestioned thing. The ritual became strictly connected with the calendar of rural works and other factors of this kind; witnesses of that time found a multitude of sacred objects (they simply described them as &quot;gods&quot;), which were connected totally with all material life, but didn&#x27;t refer to more philosophically common or abstract ideas (in opposition to descriptions of religion in the 14th century). It allows us to think about some form of pantheism, as if all the world was holy for Lithuanians.

This old vision of the world retreated slowly and finally was extinguished in the end of the 18th century. There were two stages of this process. Firstly the extinguishing of original attributes of the old religion, as names, forms of rite, details of clothing, and especially words of holy prayers, songs and poems. All these traditional forms still had some existence in the 16th century, but they became less and less known a century later. And we can date the beginning of the new stage approximately to the last quarter of the 16th century.

Two other processes started in this time. The first was stabilization of some old cultural forms, maybe less confronting to Christian requirements. Later, some of them survived the time of the very understanding old culture values and became known by neighboring nations as Lithuanian popular traditions since the middle of the 19th century or sporadically even earlier. The traditional popular songs (&quot;dainos&quot;) and Lithuanian woven sashes (&quot;juostos&quot;) are among them. Lithuanians began to create the songs in these times instead of forgotten or forbidden old holy songs and prayers. The melodic base of &quot;dainos&quot;, especially in the very beginning, was the same as in these songs. &quot;Juostos&quot; had been woven by women since old times. During this period they became the main ware, in which traditional Lithuanian ornaments still were used. The ornaments may have had some conventional symbolic significance, but during this period they began to be seen only as forms of art, which later developed into a standard of Lithuanian popular art.

The second process, which took place after the end of the 16th century, was introduction of ideas of Christianity into the Lithuanian environment, using Lithuanian culture&#x27;s symbols and traditions. This program was initiated by Jesuits (in G.D.L. only). The worship of various old religion holy essences was changed into cult of saints. On the other hand, traditional Catholic art forms of sacred objects were supplemented in Lithuania by some forms, which were comparable with ones, taken from old Lithuanian art ware. As the best example, traditional (both iron and wooden) crosses in present Lithuania, West Belarus and Northern Poland with raying sun and moon could be noted. In this case we can see old symbols still having symbolic (maybe different from pre-Christian times) sense too. 
During this period, new forms were added to country art. Local craftsmen made (mostly wooden) statues of saints, chapels, wooden an iron crosses (statues and chapels often had well-seen prototypes, made by famous European artists, but there were also original ones). Till the 19th century it became a significant branch of Lithuanian country art, known and used also by urban people. 

This program of inculturation required a good knowledge of Lithuanian. The superiors of Jesuits in Lithuania always paid some (though not very big) attention to it. The time after founding Jesuits in Lithuania was exceptional in this point. The rivalry with Reformers and, maybe, more direct survey from Rome caused, that attention, paid to Lithuanian by Jesuits was greater, than before or after it. Jesuit Lithuanian Daukša even wrote a manifesto (printed in his &quot;Postil&quot;, a collection of sermons in Lithuanian, in 1599), in which he exhorted Lithuanian nobles to regard and to use Lithuanian. Twenty years later the first dictionary with Lithuanian words was published (Polish–Latin–Lithuanian dictionary by Jesuit priest Konstantinas Sirvydas, in approx. 1620) and it became a significant fact of Lithuanian cultural life. The dictionary had a big influence to the development of Lithuanian, especially to its standardization and modernization. Adding to this, Lithuanian was presented in a satisfactory form in the dictionary, with borrowings forming only a small part of the entire word corpus. And it meant not only a difference of Lithuanian-language culture from others, but also a big potential of this culture.

So the short period during which Lithuanian-language culture was fostered by the Society of Jesus had positive effects.

After the middle of the 17th century, a moderate rise of Lithuanian-speaking culture took place. Politically it was the time of turmoils and wars. Despite this, towns were growing in Lithuania and various new realities came into life. The number of urban people increased and newcomers (in much cases Lithuanian-speaking) had significant input to it. The degree of communication between state and town officials and ordinary inhabitants increased as well. This development caused necessary changes in language policy. In non-orthodox regions of G.D.L. the middle and lower strata of urban people used Lithuanian. And only some regions in the South of G.D.L. as Grodna, Augustów regions and Vilnius town (not region) were exceptions to it, having however Lithuanian-speaking population parts, mostly in lower strata. This situation caused it to be necessary for the highest stratum of nobles to know Lithuanian too. The prestige of Lithuanian was increasing at this time and we can speak about some relative expansion and renovation of Lithuanian-speaking culture.

Lithuanian didn&#x27;t gain official status then. Among various causes of it, some more significant must be emphasized. Firstly, the two biggest towns in G.D.L. were polonized earlier and more than other towns. Secondly, position of Catholic church in G.D.L. was favorable to Polish. Adding to this, whereas publishing of books was sponsored by the highest nobles and by Catholic and Orthodox churches, publishing of books in Lithuanian did not increase. Lithuanian-language books became more and more inconspicuous among Polish and Latin publications.

As a result, the Lithuanian-speaking culture did not expand among the highest nobles. But some positive changes took place in this time too. The language was modernized, it was no longer a language of mere country people. Style of courtesy re-appeared in the language (some style of this kind had to exist in pre-Christian Lithuania). All this contributed to the existence of a Lithuanian-speaking culture among further generations of nobles and urban people. And these processes, going on only on a part of the territory of G.D.L., were a sign of a growing modern Lithuania.

====Lithuanian-language culture in the Duchy of Prussia====
Lithuanians, mostly villagers, lived in the North and North-East regions of the Duchy of Prussia. This fact was confirmed later in administrative way, and administrative unit, called Lithuanian counties was created. Unofficially it was called Lithuania, Prussian Lithuania, or, in later times, also Lithuania Minor. In the beginning of the 16th century, Lithuanians in Prussia had the same cultural traditions as neighboring Lithuanians in G.D.L., and some inessential differences are not worth mentioning here. 

But later the cultural difference between Prussian Lithuania and Lithuanian part of G.D.L. increased. The main points of this process were: In 1530, Prussia became a secular Protestant state. So Prussian Lithuanians became Protestants (Lutherans), while Lithuanians in G.D.L. stayed Catholics. The next point was presence of some official attention to religious education in the native language in Prussia. At the beginning, after 1530, for this purpose the first secular ruler of Prussia, the duke Albert invited a number of educated Lithuanians Protestants from G.D.L. They became senior priests in Prussian Lithuania and authors of church texts, holy songs in Lithuanian and their translations into Lithuanian, but one of them, Martynas Mažvydas, wrote a catechism, which was published in 1547 in Königsberg, becoming the first printed book in Lithuanian.

Since this time priests of Lithuanian parishes were obliged to know Lithuanian and they did this obligation more or less. There were talented persons among them, and sometimes books in Lithuanian with new translations of religious texts, new holy songs and so on were published. In 1653 the first Lithuanian grammar, &quot;Grammatica Litvanica&quot; by Daniel Klein, was issued in Königsberg. And unpublished material on Lithuanian language and culture, collected by them, was big too.

The interest of Lutheran priests of Prussian Lithuanian parishes in Lithuanian was deeper than the interest of their Catholic colleagues in G.D.L., and they managed to print more books for a relatively small Lithuanian population in Prussia, than Catholic editors for all Lithuanian population in G.D.L.

Catholic priests paid less attention towards Lithuanian popular traditions than Lutheran ones. Also the existence of G.D.L. had some influence to Prussian ruling persons and even put some pressure on them, and it did not allow disregarding of existing Lithuanians and their cultural needs. And the situation of Lithuanians was better, than, for example, the Old Prussian population, whose language was called &quot;barbarian&quot; and attained only minimal attention. 
Despite good attention to Lithuanian, Lithuanians were not admitted to the Prussian ruling class, which remained German. And the church career was the only one available for Lithuanians. Concentration of Lithuanian intellectuals in priest estate had some significant consequences. Lithuanian remained in use in Prussian Lithuania till the beginning of the 20th century and later. Besides this, Lithuanians became loyal and faithful to Evangelical Church in Prussia and Protestantism, their faith assumed some forms of pietism. And, in its turn, they became loyal and devoted subjects and patriots of Prussia. Thus, in fact, this part of the Lithuanian nation was separated from the main part in G.D.L. during this period.

The later part of Middle Christian period from the end of the 17th century to the mid-19th century suffered a period of decline for the Grand duchy of Lithuania.

<text>Char is the solid material that remains after light gases (e.g. coal gas) and tar have been driven out or released from a carbonaceous material during the initial stage of combustion, which is known as carbonization, charring, devolatilization or pyrolysis.

Further stages of efficient combustion (with or without char deposits) are known as gasification reactions, ending quickly when the reversible gas phase of the water gas shift reaction is reached.

<text>Sir Clive William John Granger (; 4 September 1934 – 27 May 2009) was a British econometrician known for his contributions to nonlinear time series analysis. He taught in Britain, at the University of Nottingham and in the United States, at the University of California, San Diego. Granger was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2003 in recognition of the contributions that he and his co-winner, Robert F. Engle, had made to the analysis of time series data. This work fundamentally changed the way in which economists analyse financial and macroeconomic data.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Clive Granger was born in 1934 in Swansea, south Wales, United Kingdom, to Edward John Granger and Evelyn Granger. The next year his parents moved to Lincoln.

During World War II Granger and his mother moved to Cambridge because Edward joined the Royal Air Force and deployed to North Africa. Here they stayed first with Evelyn&#x27;s mother, then later Edward&#x27;s parents, while Clive began school. Clive would later recall a primary school teacher telling his mother that &quot;[Clive] would never be successful&quot;.

Clive started secondary school in Cambridge, but continued in Nottingham, where his family moved after the war. Here two teachers encouraged Granger&#x27;s interest in physics and applied mathematics. He had anticipated following the convention of completing schooling at age 16 to enter the workforce and saw himself working in a bank or insurance company. However, positive social influence from his peers and support from his father led him to enroll in sixth-form for two years as preparation for a university degree.

Granger enrolled in a joint degree in economics and mathematics at the University of Nottingham but switched to full mathematics in his second year. After receiving his BA in 1955, he remained at the University of Nottingham for a PhD in statistics under the supervision of Harry Pitt.

In 1956, aged 21, Granger was appointed a junior lecturer in statistics at the university. His interest in applied statistics and economics led him to choose as the topic of his doctoral thesis time series analysis, a field in which he felt that relatively little work had been done at the time. In 1959 Granger completed his PhD degree with a thesis titled &quot;Testing for Non-stationarity&quot;.

===Academic life===
Granger spent the next academic year, 1959–60, at Princeton University under a Harkness Fellowship of the Commonwealth Fund. He had been invited to Princeton by Oskar Morgenstern to participate in his Econometrics Research Project. Here, Granger and Michio Hatanaka as assistants to John Tukey on a project using Fourier analysis on economic data.

In 1964, Granger and Hatanaka published the results of their research in a book on &quot;Spectral Analysis of Economic Time Series&quot; (Tukey had encouraged them to write this themselves, as he was not going to publish the research results.) In 1963, Granger also wrote an article on &quot;The typical spectral shape of an economic variable&quot;, which appeared in &quot;Econometrica&quot; in 1966. Both the book and the article proved influential in the adoption of the new methods.

Granger also became a full professor at the University of Nottingham.

In a 1969 paper in &quot;Econometrica&quot;, Granger also introduced his concept of Granger causality.

After reading a pre-print copy of the time series book by George Box and Gwilym Jenkins in 1968, Granger became interested in forecasting. For the next few years he worked on this subject with his post-doctoral student, Paul Newbold; and they wrote a book which became a standard reference in time series forecasting (published in 1977). Using simulations, Granger and Newbold also wrote the famous 1974 paper on spurious regression which led to a re-evaluation of previous empirical work in economics and to the econometric methodology.

Granger spent 22 years at the University of Nottingham. In 2005, the building that houses the Economics and Geography Departments was renamed the &quot;Sir Clive Granger Building&quot; in honor of his Nobel prize award.

In 1974 Granger moved to the University of California at San Diego. In 1975 he participated in a US Bureau of Census committee, chaired by Arnold Zellner, on seasonal adjustment. At UCSD, Granger continued his research on time series, collaborating closely with Nobel prize co-recipient Robert Engle (whom he helped bring to UCSD), Roselyne Joyeux (on fractional integration), Timo Teräsvirta (on nonlinear time series) and others. Working with Robert Engle, he developed the concept of cointegration, introduced in a 1987 joint paper in &quot;Econometrica&quot;; for which he was awarded the Nobel prize in 2003.

Granger also supervised many PhD students, including Mark Watson (co-advisor with Robert Engle).

In later years Granger also used time series methods to analyse data outside economics. He worked on a project forecasting deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. In 2003, Granger retired from UCSD as a professor emeritus. He was a Visiting Eminent Scholar of the University of Melbourne and the University of Canterbury. He was a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reform of the United Nations.

Granger was married to Patricia (Lady Granger) from 1960 until his death. He was survived by their son, Mark William John, and their daughter, Claire Amanda Jane.

Granger died on 27 May 2009, at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, California.

==Honors and awards==
In 2003, Granger and his collaborator Robert Engle were jointly awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. He was made a Knight Bachelor in the New Year&#x27;s Honours in 2005.

Granger was a fellow of the Econometric Society since 1972 and a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy since 2002. In 2004, he was voted as one of the 100 Welsh Heroes.

<doc id="480149" wikidata="Q4208918" url="?curid=480149" title="George Cakobau">
<text>Ratu [[Sir]] George Kadavulevu Cakobau (6 November 1912 – 25 November 1989) was a Fijian statesman and athlete. A great-grandson of &quot;Ratu&quot; Seru Epenisa Cakobau, the paramount chief of Bau who had unified all the tribes of Fiji under his reign in the mid-1800s, &quot;Ratu&quot; Sir George held the traditional titles of &quot;Vunivalu&quot; of Bau and &quot;Tui Levuka&quot; and thus was considered by many as Fiji&#x27;s highest-ranking traditional chief. &quot;Ratu&quot; Cakobau was appointed Governor-General of Fiji in 1973, becoming the first indigenous Fijian to serve as the viceregal representative of Elizabeth II, Queen of Fiji.

== Education and early career ==
Cakobau was educated first at Fiji&#x27;s Queen Victoria School, then at Newington College in Australia (1927–1932) and Wanganui Technical College in Wanganui, New Zealand. He became a member of the Great Council of Chiefs in 1938, where he remained until 1972. When he first joined the Council, it had the power to make laws for the ethnic Fijian population, but this power was removed towards the end of the colonial era, as modern political institutions were built.

Cakobau served with the Royal Fiji Military Forces in World War II (1939–1945), rising to the rank of captain. Following his return to Fiji after the end of the war, he was nominated to the Legislative Council in 1951 to replace the deceased George Toganivalu. He remained a member of this body, which was renamed the House of Representatives when Fiji became independent in 1970 as the Dominion of Fiji until his appointment as Governor-General. He served in the Cabinet, first as Minister for Fijian Affairs and Local Government and subsequently as a minister without portfolio, from 1970 to 1972.

== Governor-General of Fiji ==
One significant event marked Cakobau&#x27;s tenure as Governor-General. In March 1977, a constitutional crisis developed following a general election that gave a narrow majority to the Indo-Fijian dominated National Federation Party (NFP). Three days after the election, the NFP splintered in a leadership brawl, and Cakobau, acting as Fiji&#x27;s effective head of state, then called on the defeated Prime Minister, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, to form a new government, pending fresh elections (which were held in September, and resulted in a landslide win for Mara&#x27;s Alliance Party).

In a public statement, Cakobau defended his actions thus: &quot;In the recent general election, the people of Fiji did not give a clear mandate to either of the major political parties. It, therefore, became the duty of the Governor-General under the Constitution to appoint as Prime Minister the Member of the House of Representatives who appeared to him best able to command the support of the majority of the Members of the House. The Governor-General has not been able to act sooner as it was not until this afternoon that he was informed who had been elected leader of the National Federation Party. The Governor-General, after taking all relevant circumstances into account, has come to the firm conclusion that the person best able to command support of the majority of the Members is the Leader of the Alliance Party, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. In compliance with the Constitution and acting in his own deliberate judgment the Governor-General has accordingly appointed Ratu Sir Kamisese as Prime Minister.&quot;

Although Cakobau&#x27;s actions were unquestionably constitutional, they were controversial. Despite the disarray in the NFP, many people, especially in the Indo-Fijian community, were outraged at his role in usurping a popular election, in what many Indo-Fijians saw as a blatant move to protect the privileged position of his fellow Fijian chiefs, who dominated the Mara government.

== Honours ==
Cakobau was decorated with many honours during his lifetime. Among these was Royal Victorian Chain, a rare and prestigious honour awarded as a sign of the special relationship between Fiji and the Monarchy, following the visit of Queen Elizabeth II in 1982. He was a Freemason.

== Sport ==
Cakobau played four first-class cricket matches for Fiji during their 1947–48 tour to New Zealand. Cakobau made his debut first-class debut against Auckland and played his fourth and final first-class match on tour against Otago.

In his four first-class matches Cakobau scored 176 runs at a batting average of 25.14, with a single half-century score of 67* coming against Wellington. With the ball, he took 5 wickets at a bowling average of 52.00, with best figures of 2/48. Additionally, he took 3 catches in the field.

During the tour to New Zealand, Cakobau also played 9 non-first-class matches for Fiji, with his final match coming against Hawke&#x27;s Bay.

He also played a rugby union Test match for Fiji in 1939, against a New Zealand Maori team at Hamilton. Fiji won by 10 points, with Cakobau contributing two points, through a conversion.

== Personal life and legacy ==

Ratu Sir George Cakobau&#x27;s father was Ratu Popi, and his grandfather was Ratu Celua, the youngest son of the Vunivalu, Ratu Cakobau.

Cakobau was married twice, first to &quot;Adi&quot; Veniana Gavoka then to Lady Lelea Seruwaia Balekiwai. Several of his children have distinguished themselves in public service. Adi Samanunu Talakuli has held Cabinet office and has been her country&#x27;s High Commissioner to Malaysia, before being appointed to the Senate in June 2006. Ratu George Cakobau Jr. and Adi Litia Cakobau also served in the Senators from 2001 to 2006. His youngest son, Ratu Tanoa Cakobau, was President of the Conservative Alliance, the junior partner in the ruling coalition from 2001 to 2006.

Cakobau retired from office in 1983, but as Fiji&#x27;s traditional Paramount Chief, he remained influential until his death in 1989.

&quot;Ratu&quot; Epenisa Cakobau was installed as Ratu Sir George&#x27;s successor as &quot;Vunivalu&quot; of Bau on the 10th of March 2023.

<text>St Edmund&#x27;s College is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge in England. Founded in 1896, it is the second-oldest of the three Cambridge colleges oriented to mature students, which accept only students reading for postgraduate degrees or for undergraduate degrees if aged 21 years or older.

Named after St Edmund of Abingdon (1175–1240), who was the first known Oxford Master of Arts and Archbishop of Canterbury from 1234 to 1240, the college has Catholic roots. Its founders were Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk, and Baron Anatole von Hügel (1854–1928), the first Catholic to take a Cambridge degree since the deposition of King James II in 1688. The Visitor is the Archbishop of Westminster (at present Cardinal Vincent Nichols).

The college is located on Mount Pleasant, northwest of the centre of Cambridge, near Lucy Cavendish College, Murray Edwards College and Fitzwilliam College. Its campus consists of a garden setting on the edge of what was Roman Cambridge, with housing for more than 350 students.

Members of St Edmund&#x27;s include cosmologist and Big Bang theorist Georges Lemaître, Norman St John-Stevas, Archbishop Eamon Martin, of Armagh, Bishop John Petit of Menevia, and Olympic medalists Simon Schürch (Gold), Thorsten Streppelhoff (Silver), Marc Weber (Silver), Stuart Welch (Silver) and Simon Amor (Silver). St Edmund&#x27;s was the residential hall of the university&#x27;s first Catholic students in 200 years – most of whom were studying for the priesthood – after the lifting of the papal prohibition on attendance at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in 1895 at the urging of a delegation to Pope Leo XIII led by Baron von Hügel.

== History ==
===Foundation===
St Edmund&#x27;s House was founded in 1896 by Henry Fitzalan-Howard, the 15th Duke of Norfolk, and Baron Anatole von Hügel as an institution providing board and lodging for Roman Catholic students at the University of Cambridge.

After Catholic Emancipation, in particular after the Universities Tests Act 1871, students who were Roman Catholics were admitted as members of Oxford and Cambridge universities. However, the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith decreed that it would be next to impossible for the ancient English universities to be frequented without mortal sin, stressing the dangers of an increasing atmosphere of liberalism and scepticism. This decision was met with public outcry from the wealthy laity, who wished for their sons to attend Oxbridge colleges. After a petition led by Anatole von Hügel, this ban was lifted in 1895 by Pope Leo XIII with the condition that a chaplain be appointed, a library with Catholic books be founded, and public lectures on philosophy, history and religion be established. As a result, the Universities Catholic Education Board (later Oxford and Cambridge Catholic Education Board) was founded and Edmund Nolan was appointed Chaplain. The Duke of Norfolk purchased property in Cambridge and the Cambridge University Catholic Chaplaincy was established at St Edmund&#x27;s House in November 1886.

In its early days the college functioned predominantly as a lodging house, or hall of residence, for students who were matriculated at other colleges. Most of the students, at that time, were ordained Catholic priests who were reading various subjects offered by the University. The college was established in the buildings of Ayerst Hostel, which had been set up for non-collegiate students by the Anglican priest William Ayerst in 1884. In 1896 Ayerst Hostel closed due to lack of funds, and the property was transferred to the Catholic Church. The founding master of St Edmund&#x27;s House was Edmund Nolan, then vice-rector of St Edmund&#x27;s College, Ware.

===Collegiate Status===
Attempts to have St Edmund&#x27;s House become a constituent college of the University of Cambridge were undertaken at various junctures, but were met in pre-ecumenical days by continuing opposition from the predominantly Protestant membership of the university’s governing Regent House. Among motives cited were that the college was not self-governing and its assets were held in trust by an external body, namely, the Catholic Church.

The chapel was consecrated in 1916 by Cardinal Francis Bourne, Archbishop of Westminster. A new dining hall was constructed in 1939 and the membership of the college increased steadily as it became a recognised House of Residence of the university, without college status.

In response to growing postgraduate student numbers in the early 1960s, the Regent House of the university established several Colleges primarily for postgraduate students, and St Edmund&#x27;s House became one of the graduate Colleges in the University (the others being Wolfson College, Hughes Hall, Clare Hall and Darwin College). This spurred further progress regarding St Edmund&#x27;s status within the University, and in 1965, the College was permitted to matriculate its own students and new fellows were elected. In 1975 St Edmund&#x27;s acquired the status of an &quot;Approved Foundation&quot;, and after the transfer of the College assets from the Catholic Church to the autonomous governing body comprising the Masters and Fellows of the College in 1986, the College changed its name from &quot;St Edmund&#x27;s House&quot; to &quot;St Edmund&#x27;s College&quot;. It received university approval for full collegiate status in 1996, and this was confirmed by the grant of its royal charter in 1998. The college now accepts students of all faiths and none.

===Allegations of Misconduct===

====Noah Carl racism controversy====

St Edmund’s College faced backlash over its handling of Noah Carl&#x27;s appointment, following revelations about his research promoting links between race, intelligence, and criminality. An investigation led to his dismissal, citing ethical and scholarly shortcomings. However, the college had failed to vet his background thoroughly and acted only under pressure from public protests. The college dismissed Carl as there &quot;was a serious risk that Dr Carl’s appointment could lead, directly or indirectly, to the college being used as a platform to promote views that could incite racial or religious hatred, and bring the college into disrepute&quot;. While the college maintained it upheld academic standards, its approach to the recruitment and eventual dismissal drew criticism for lack of transparency and effective oversight.

==== Accusations of Hinduphobia ====

In March 2023, the college faced accusations of Hinduphobia after Hindu students were criticised for unintentionally colouring a statue during Holi. The CR president was forced by college fellows to issue an apology despite believing no harm was intended. The college was seen by many students to have overstepped their authority, by interfering with the CR’s independence, and to have alienated Hindu students at the college.

== Buildings and grounds ==

===Norfolk Building===
The Norfolk Building is the oldest building on site, dating back to 1896 as the former Ayerst Hostel; it provided accommodation for Edmund Nolan, the first Master of St Edmund&#x27;s, along with the first four students of the college. Known for its clean Gothic revival style, the building underwent a three-phase extension scheme designed by Roderick Gradidge in 1989, and now houses amenities including the Combination Room, Dining Hall, Kitchens and a Porter&#x27;s office.
===Chapel===

The chapel is a Grade II listed building designed by the architect Benedict Williamson CSSP and was consecrated by Cardinal Francis Bourne, Archbishop of Westminster in 1916. Notable for its simplicity and Gothic Revival architecture, the chapel is a Catholic foundation, although it is open to members of other Christian denominations. In 2003, a stained-glass window depicting the ministry of Saint Boniface of Crediton (c. 675 - 754 AD), the apostle to Germany, was donated by Stephen Frowen and blessed by Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O&#x27;Connor, Archbishop of Westminster.

A bronze sculpture of the college patron, St Edmund of Abingdon, is located at the front of the chapel, his left hand holding a Bible. The statue is the work of Rodney Munday, an alumnus of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, and was commissioned by the College in 2007. The Chapel Schola and Choir perform in concerts in collaboration with St Edmund Hall, Oxford and St Edmund&#x27;s College, Ware in commemoration of their Patron Saint.

===Expansion===
St Edmund&#x27;s continues to expand and develop its buildings. In 2000, a new residential building housing 50 students was opened, named after Richard Laws, one of the former Masters. In 2006, two new residential buildings, including rooms for 70 students as well as apartments for couples, were opened; these were named after the former Master of the College, Sir Brian Heap, and the former Vice-Master, Geoffrey Cook.

In 2016, major plans were announced for the development of two new courts and several buildings. It was planned that brick buildings would form the perimeter of two new courts and a new multi-million pound student centre will frame the west side of the College. The expansion plans received planning consent from Cambridge City Council in June 2017, but building work never started.

===Okinaga Tower===
Created in 1993 by the bequest of the Teikyo Foundation, the Okinaga Tower is the college&#x27;s tallest structure. Designed by architect Roderick Gradidge in 1989 it houses the Master&#x27;s Lodge, as well as a suite with views of the city and was opened by Betty Boothroyd, Speaker of the House of Commons.

===Courts and other buildings===
The Brian Heap, Richard Laws, Geoffrey Cook and the Luizo buildings were constructed to accommodate growing student numbers in the 2000s, with most buildings providing are student dormitories.

In 2019 the college constructed Mount Pleasant Halls, occupying the site of a substantial office block formerly on the site and giving St Edmund College a frontage to the main thoroughfare of Huntington Road.

The College Sporting Grounds is located west of the Richard Laws Building, and offers a full-sized football pitch for college sports and other outdoor activities.

The College Orchard is south of the Sporting Grounds, and consists of a small lawn with 5 apple trees, outdoor seating, and a barbecue pit for students.

White Cottage is a modest 18th-century brick farmhouse which pre-dates the college buildings on the site and is painted white, situated adjacent to Mount Pleasant Halls against which it appears an incongruous survival. White Cottage was the first home of the Von Hugel Institute, a Catholic Institute for Critical Enquiry working in the fields of Christianity and society. The Institute was founded in 1987 to preserve the Roman Catholic legacy of the College when control of the College itself was ceded to its autonomous Governing Body in 1985 in order to achieve university collegiate status.

Bene&#x27;t House is a detached Edwardian house, south-east of the Norfolk Old Wing. Named after St Benedict of Nursia (c.480 - 547 AD), it has since 2018 contained the facilities and offices for the Von Hugel Institute.

== Academic profile ==
The full spectrum of academic subjects is represented in the college. The fellowship of the college represents many academic disciplines, spread across arts, humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, and veterinary medicine.

The college has one research institute attached to it: the Von Hügel Institute founded in 1987 to carry out research on Catholic Social Teaching. Describing itself as a &#x27;Catholic Institute for Critical Enquiry&#x27; it works in the fields of Christianity and society, and seeks to preserve the Roman Catholic legacy of St Edmund&#x27;s College when control of the College itself was ceded to its autonomous Governing Body in 1985 in order to achieve university collegiate status. The Von Hügel Institute is therefore a link to the Roman Catholic origins of the college.

The overall examination results of the college&#x27;s comparatively few undergraduates tend to be in the middle among the Cambridge colleges, with St Edmund&#x27;s ranking 21st on the Tompkins table in 2018.
==Student life==
The college is younger than some of the more traditional colleges of the university. Despite this St Edmund&#x27;s maintains many ancient Cambridge traditions including formal hall, albeit with modifications. Fellows at most Cambridge and Oxford colleges dine at a &quot;high table&quot; (separately from the students); however, St Edmund&#x27;s has no such division, with undergraduates, postgraduates and fellows sitting together at dinners. Unlike most mature and modern colleges, St Edmund&#x27;s still requires students to wear their academic gowns during formal halls, ceremonies, and college occasions. St Edmund&#x27;s retains several other dining traditions unusual for modern colleges, including a requirement to ask the master to leave the hall to use the bathroom, a banning of technological devices and newspapers, and a strict requirement to only speak English. The St Edmund&#x27;s undergraduate gown is fashioned from distinctive black cloth with close detailing around the neck and sleeves.

The college has a long sporting tradition, including the St Edmund&#x27;s College Boat Club, the St Edmund&#x27;s College Hockey Club (SECHC) and the St Edmund&#x27;s College Cricket Club (SECCC). SECHC (merged with St Catherine&#x27;s College Hockey Club) won 2024 Cuppers and SECCC reached the 2023 Cuppers finals. In recent years members have competed in varsity teams representing Cambridge against Oxford University in a wide variety of sports, most notably, at The Boat Race, The Varsity Match, the University Match (hockey) and The University Match (cricket). Punts are available to students in the spring and summer months.

On 15 September 2017, a team of four rowers from the college broke the World record for the &#x27;Longest Continual Row&#x27; in the male 20–29 small team category by over an hour. The following year, on 13 April 2018, a team of ten rowers from the college went on to set the British and World record for &quot;One Million Meters&quot; on the indoor rowing machine in the male 20-29 large team category.

<doc id="480152" wikidata="Q143518" url="?curid=480152" title="Tinder">
<text>Tinder is easily combustible material used to start a fire. Tinder is a finely divided, open material which will begin to glow under a shower of sparks. Air is gently wafted over the glowing tinder until it bursts into flame. The flaming tinder is used to ignite , which in turn is used to ignite the bulk material, to produce a fire. 

Tinder can be made of any flammable substance, as long as it is finely divided and has an open structure.

== Technique ==
Any flammable material may be used as long as it is finely divided. As the tinder gets thinner, the surface area and edges increase, making it ignite more easily.

Wood tinder can be made by carefully shaving thin slivers off a larger piece. Another method which keeps these slivers together, is to make a feather stick. The driest wood, which makes the best tinder, is that of dead branches that have not yet fallen to the ground.

If a fire is to be lit by sparks rather than matches, char cloth, punkwood, fungus or down are commonly used to catch the sparks. However, fungi should be selected with care as some release toxic fumes on combustion. Char cloth can be made by placing plant-based fabric (usually cotton) in a tin box into a campfire; like charcoal, it is the product of anhydrous pyrolysis. It is very fragile, and should usually be prepared only in small quantities.

Pitchwood is the resinous wood which decays last from dead conifers. It can be found on the ground where conifer tree trunks have fallen and decayed. The parts of the deadwood that would form the knots in lumber, i.e. the places where branches entered the trunk, are impregnated with resin which has the combustibility of wood soaked in lighter fluid. Pitchwood can also be found in the stumps left in the ground when conifers die. These stumps contain spires of resin-impregnated wood, called fatwood, which can easily be lighted using only a single match or lighter. Pitchwood that has been shaved into small splinters is easy to ignite, and it does not absorb water, so it remains easy to ignite in any weather as long as the flame is sheltered from rain and wind. In the southeastern United States, pitchwood is known as &quot;fat lighter&quot; or &quot;lighter&#x27;d&quot; (a shortening of lighter-wood).

Embers of burned paper, leaves and other sheetlike materials are easily carried off by air currents, where they can alight upon other objects and ignite them. In outdoor campfires, paper can be wadded up to reduce this hazard; wadded paper also burns more quickly.

Magnesium is sold in stores in shaved or bar form. Shavings burn white-hot, are impossible to smother with carbon dioxide or sand, and can ignite even wet kindling. Solid bars are impossible to ignite under normal conditions (and difficult even with a welding torch), and are thus very safe to carry. Magnesium powder and shavings are pyrophoric (they oxidise rapidly when exposed to the air). It is dangerous to carry pre-shaved magnesium — at best, it loses potency, at worst, it can spontaneously ignite and is then nearly unquenchable. Magnesium bars are sometimes sold with a length of ferrocerium cast into one edge.

The gathering of tinder, and perhaps more importantly, its dry storage is one of the most critical aspects of many survival situations.

== Materials==

Materials used as tinder around the world include:

* Small twigs (poor tinder but commonly available)
* Paper, paper towels, toilet paper, etc.

* Dry pine needles, leaves or grass
* Birch bark
* Dead, standing (usually one season old) goldenrod
* Cloth, lint, or frayed rope (if made from plant fibers and not treated with fire retardant)
* Char cloth
* Cotton balls, cotton swabs, tampons
*seed &quot;fluff&quot; from plants like milkweed, dandelions, Cottonwood, etc.
* Some types of fungus, such as chaga and amadou (or horse&#x27;s hoof fungus)
* Dry bread or knäckebröd and shoe polish 
* Punk wood (in the process of rotting) or charred wood
* Bird down
* abandoned bird nests
* Fatwood, also known as rich pine or pine knot
* Fine-grade soap-coated steel wool
* Shaved magnesium or other alkaline earth metals
*Specially prepared stringybark, known as &quot;morthi&quot;, used by the Kaurna people of South Australia

<doc id="480153" wikidata="Q637033" url="?curid=480153" title="Little Britain (TV series)">
<text>Little Britain is a British sketch comedy series that began as a radio show in 2000 and ran as a television series between 2003 and 2006. It was written and performed by David Walliams and Matt Lucas. Financed by the BBC, the radio series was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4, with the initial two television series premiering on BBC Three and the third and final series on BBC One.

The programme consists of sketches involving exaggerated parodies of British people from various walks of life. Each sketch was introduced by a voice-over narration (Tom Baker) suggesting that the programme was a guide – aimed at non-British people – to British society. Despite the narrator&#x27;s description of &quot;great British institutions&quot;, the comedy arises from the British audience&#x27;s self-deprecating understanding of themselves or people known to them. Recurring characters included Andy Pipkin who falsely presented himself as requiring the use of a wheelchair to gain the attention of his carer Lou Todd; Daffyd Thomas, who claims to be &quot;the only gay in the village&quot; despite much evidence to the contrary; and Vicky Pollard, presented as a working-class &quot;chav&quot; engaging in anti-social behaviour.

The programme&#x27;s title was inspired by both Great Britain and the phrase Little Englander, referring to narrow-mindedness and complacent insularity. It is also the name of a London street described by Washington Irving as &quot;a stronghold of true &quot;. The radio show was trailed as &quot;exploring British life in Britain as it is lived by Britons today in Britain&quot;. It spawned a live show, which toured internationally between 2005 and 2007, various specials for the &quot;Comic Relief&quot; charity marathons, and the HBO-produced &quot;Little Britain USA&quot; spin-off in 2008. Walliams and Lucas followed &quot;Little Britain&quot; with another sketch show, &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot;.

The series was popular and received high viewing figures, receiving 9.5 million viewers following its move to BBC One in 2005. Despite the series&#x27;s popularity, commentators expressed concern on the impact that the show had on the large numbers of children who watched it, despite being aired after the watershed and on the heavy use of toilet humour, particularly in the second and third series. Criticism was also raised regarding the perceived derogatory manner in which &quot;Little Britain&quot; depicted racial and ethnic minority groups. In 2017, Lucas stated that he had agreed with the latter criticism. In June 2020, the show was pulled from various UK streaming services due to its use of blackface. In March 2022, the BBC made Little Britain available to view on BBC iPlayer again, with some of the more controversial characters being cut from the original release.

==History==

===Radio show===
&quot;Little Britain&quot; initially appeared as a radio show produced by Edward Flinn, which ran on BBC Radio 4 from 2000 until 2002.

Radio 4 began a rerun of all nine episodes in February 2004 (which were slightly edited for content to suit the 6:30 pm timeslot). Unusually, this overlapped with a rerun, beginning in mid-March, of the first five programmes on the digital radio channel BBC 7. In June–July 2004, BBC 7 broadcast the remaining four.

It was announced in October 2019 that the series would return for a one-off radio special, titled &quot;Little Brexit&quot;, on BBC Radio 4 on 31 October 2019.

===Television series===

Like several other BBC comedies (such as &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; and &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot;), &quot;Little Britain&quot; made the transition from radio to television. All the episodes for the series were filmed at Pinewood Studios. Much of the TV material was adapted from the radio version but with more emphasis on recurring characters and catchphrases.

;Series One, 2003
The first TV series was one of the new programmes in the launch line-up for digital channel BBC Three, the replacement for BBC Choice, which launched in February 2003. As a result of its success, the first series was repeated on the more widely available BBC Two. Although reactions were mixed, many critics were enthusiastic, and the programme was commissioned for another run. Part of the series was filmed at Herne Bay in Kent: Emily Howard the Lady, and the Lou and Andy sketches. Every episode of the series ended with a failed world record attempt.

;Series Two, 2004
The second series, featuring several new characters, began on BBC Three on 19 October 2004. Its continued popularity meant the repeats moved to BBC One, starting 3 December 2004. The episodes were edited for their BBC One run to remove any material that might have been too offensive for the more mainstream BBC One audience. Every episode of this series ended with a Lou and Andy sketch.

;Series Three, 2005
A third series began on 17 November 2005, for the first time on BBC One rather than BBC Three, and ended six weeks later. After its transmission, it was unclear whether there would be another, as many sketches were given dramatic twists and &quot;wrapped up&quot; (see individual character articles for more information). Lucas and Walliams were reportedly in talks for a fourth series with the BBC. Furthermore, they admitted in an interview they preferred to &quot;kill off&quot; certain characters to make way for new ones.
Again, Lou and Andy appeared in the last sketch at the end of each episode, bar one.

;&quot;Little, Little Britain&quot;, 2005
In 2005, to raise money for Comic Relief, Walliams and Lucas made a special edition of the show, dubbed &quot;Little, Little Britain&quot;. The episode included a variety of sketches with celebrities, including George Michael, Robbie Williams and Sir Elton John. This was released on a limited edition DVD and was released in the United States as &quot;Little, Little Britain&quot; on the Region 1 version of the &quot;Little Britain: Series 2&quot; DVD.

;&quot;Little Britain Abroad&quot;, 2006
In 2006, a two-part Christmas special was released, in which characters from the programme were depicted as visiting other countries.

===&quot;Little Britain Live&quot;===

As a success of the television series, Lucas and Walliams created a travelling stage show based on their series.

;&quot;Comic Relief Does Little Britain Live&quot;, 2007
A special live version featuring appearances from celebrities such as Russell Brand and Dennis Waterman was filmed in 2006 and appeared on 2007&#x27;s Comic Relief show.

===&quot;Little Britain USA&quot;===

In 2007, Lucas and Walliams announced that there would be no more of the British &quot;Little Britain&quot;, but they taped an American continuation of the programme entitled &quot;Little Britain USA&quot;, which featured both returning characters from the British series and new American characters. According to Walliams, the new show was &quot;effectively &quot;Little Britain&quot; series four&quot;. The show debuted on HBO at 10:30 pm EST Sunday 28 September 2008, then the following week on BBC One in Britain. It also started airing on The Comedy Network in Canada in January 2010.

=== Specials ===
==== &quot;Little Britain Comic Relief Special&quot;, 2005 ====
This was the first Little Britain Comic Relief special, with the usual cast and guest appearances from George Michael, Elton John, and Robbie Williams.

==== &quot;Comic Relief Does Little Britain Live&quot;, 2007 ====
The Little Britain cast returned for a second Comic Relief Special, this time live and with special guests: Russell Brand, Kate Moss, Patsy Kensit, Jonathan Ross, Kate Thornton, Chris Moyles, Dennis Waterman, Peter Kay, David Baddiel, Jeremy Edwards, and Dawn French.

==== &quot;Little Britain Comic Relief Special&quot;, 2009 ====
A crossover between the UK and USA versions, this featured guest appearances by Catherine Tate and Robbie Williams.

==== &quot;Little Britain Comic Relief Sketch&quot;, 2015 ====
Walliams reprises the role of Lou Todd for Comic Relief. Guest stars included Stephen Hawking and Catherine Tate. However, Lucas does not feature.

==== &quot;Little Britain Does Sport Relief&quot;, 2016 ====
This featured Walliams reprising the role of Emily Howard. Lucas did not feature.

==== &quot;Little Brexit&quot;, 2019 ====
This one-off special was broadcast on 31 October 2019 on BBC Radio 4. The concept was created due to Brexit, the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the EU. Lucas and Walliams both returned for this episode.

====&quot;The Big Night In&quot;, 2020 ====
The concept was revived for &quot;The Big Night In&quot;, a 23 April 2020 telethon held during the COVID-19 pandemic, in a skit which had the pair revisiting several characters. Social distancing requirements meant that they appeared in separate video feeds from their own homes, and used improvised costumes.

==Cast and characters==
As a sketch show, &quot;Little Britain&quot; features many characters with varying degrees of costume and makeup. Matt Lucas and David Walliams play all the main characters in the show. Tom Baker narrates and Paul Putner, Steve Furst, Sally Rogers and Stirling Gallacher regularly appear as several different characters.

Other regular cast members include Anthony Head as the Prime Minister, Ruth Jones as Myfanwy, and Joann Condon as Pat.

==Broadcast==

A two-part Christmas special, &quot;Little Britain Abroad&quot;, was broadcast in December 2006 and January 2007, bringing the total number of episodes to 25. There was also the &quot;Little Britain Live&quot; show.

In the UK, the series was originally broadcast on BBC Three and BBC One and was aired in repeats on Dave, Gold, and Watch. In the US and Bermuda, the series airs on BBC America. BBC Canada has aired the program from 3 March 2005  to present. UKTV broadcasts the programme in Australia and New Zealand. Comedy Central India broadcast the programme for Indian audiences.
==Criticism==
The programme, notably the second and third series, has been criticised for its treatment of racial and ethnic minority groups and &quot;punch-down&quot; comedic style. Fellow comedian Victoria Wood said that while the sketches amused her, she found them to be &quot;very misogynistic&quot;. In 2005, Fergus Sheppard wrote in &quot;The Scotsman&quot;:

&quot;The Guardian&quot; columnist Owen Jones argued in his book &quot;&quot; that &quot;Little Britain&quot; helped to perpetuate unkind stereotypes about working-class people, exacerbated by the fact that both Walliams and Lucas attended private schools.

The series became increasingly popular with children despite being shown after the watershed. There was also criticism from teachers that the programme led to inappropriate copycat behaviour in the playground.

Speaking in October 2017, Lucas stated that if he were to remake &quot;Little Britain&quot; he would avoid making jokes about transvestites and would not play the role of a black character, saying, &quot;Basically, I wouldn&#x27;t make that show now. It would upset people. We made a more cruel kind of comedy than I&#x27;d do now... Society has moved on a lot since then and my own views have evolved&quot;. He defended decisions that were taken at the time, and explained that he and Walliams deliberately sought to play a very diverse group of people. The pair went on to reproduce some of the characters – including a brief reprisal of Emily and Florence, the transvestites – on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Big Night In&quot; during the 2020 pandemic where they acknowledged in character that they would not play the characters again.

In June 2020, &quot;Little Britain&quot; was pulled from BBC iPlayer, Netflix and BritBox, alongside &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot;, for its use of blackface. A spokesperson for the BBC said: &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of historical programming available on BBC iPlayer, which we regularly review.&quot; On its decision to remove the shows, BritBox added: &quot;Times have changed since &quot;Little Britain&quot; first aired, so it is not currently available on BritBox.&quot; Speaking shortly after the removal, Lucas and Walliams apologised again, saying: &quot;Once again we want to make it clear that it was wrong and we are very sorry.&quot;

In March 2022, &quot;Little Britain&quot; was restored to BBC iPlayer after scenes containing the use of blackface with the characters of Ting Tong and Desiree DeVere were removed and a content warning included. In a statement, the BBC said &quot;Little Britain has been made available to fans on BBC iPlayer following edits made to the series by Matt and David that better reflect the changes in the cultural landscape over the last 20 years since the show was first made.&quot;

==Spin-offs and merchandise==

&quot;I&#x27;m Gay&quot;, the song that Matt Lucas&#x27;s character Daffyd Thomas sang at the end of the &quot;Little Britain Live&quot; shows, was released as a CD single in Australia in March 2007 and reached number 66 on the ARIA Singles Chart.

Matt Lucas and Peter Kay, in the guise of their characters Andy Pipkin and Brian Potter, re-recorded the song &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot; with its creators, The Proclaimers. This version was released as a charity single for Comic Relief on 19 March 2007.

&quot;Little Britain: The Video Game&quot; was released in February 2007. It featured a variety of characters in mini-games and received very negative reviews, being referred to by some as one of the worst games ever made.

The Russian series &quot;Nasha Russia&quot; is inspired by &quot;Little Britain&quot;.

In 2010, characters returned for Nationwide Building Society adverts, including Lou and Andy, Vicky Pollard and Eddie (Emily) Howard.

==Little Britain Productions==
Little Britain Productions is a production company set up by Lucas and Walliams to produce their future television projects, such as &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot;, &quot;Rock Profile&quot; and &quot;The One...&quot;.

==Home media==
===VHS===
On 11 October 2004, Little Britain The Complete First Series was released on VHS.

<text>In Step is the fourth studio album by Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble, released in 1989. The title &quot;In Step&quot; can be seen as referring to Vaughan&#x27;s new-found sobriety, following the years of drug and alcohol use that eventually led Vaughan into rehabilitation. It was also Vaughan&#x27;s final album with Double Trouble and the last album to be released during his lifetime. In 1990, he recorded an album with his brother, Jimmie Vaughan, called &quot;Family Style&quot;; later that same year, Stevie Ray Vaughan died in a helicopter crash.

At the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards in 1990, the album won the Grammy for Best Contemporary Blues Recording.

In 1999, a reissue of the album was released which contains an audio interview segment and four live bonus tracks.

==Reception==
Reviews for &quot;In Step&quot; have generally been positive. Robert Christgau rated the album an A−, signifying &quot;a very good record.&quot; Although he stated that &quot;Wall of Denial&quot; and &quot;Tightrope&quot; fall into ex-addict jargon like it was natural speech and that &quot;if the music was preachy or wimpy this would be a disaster,&quot; he concluded that &quot;House Is Rockin&#x27;&quot; keeps on boogieing on and that on the mood-jazz closer he escapes the blues undamaged for the first time in his career.

Lou Reed selected &quot;In Step&quot; as one of his &#x27;picks of 1989&#x27;.

In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic rated &quot;In Step&quot; five out of five stars. He noted that before the album was released, &quot;his songwriting was hit or miss. Even when he wrote a classic modern blues song, it was firmly within the genre&#x27;s conventions.&quot; He further stated that it helped &quot;Vaughan found his own songwriting voice, blending blues, soul, and rock in unique ways, and writing with startling emotional honesty.&quot; Although he stated that &quot;tunes like the terse &quot;Tightrope&quot; and the dense &quot;Wall of Denial&quot; feel so intensely personal, it&#x27;s hard to believe that they weren&#x27;t the product of just one man&quot;, he also stated that &quot;the lighter numbers [...] are just as effective as songs.&quot; He concluded that &quot;it&#x27;s fully realized, presenting every facet of Vaughan&#x27;s musical personality, yet it still soars with a sense of discovery. It&#x27;s a bittersweet triumph, given Vaughan&#x27;s tragic death, [...] yet it&#x27;s a triumph all the same.&quot;

<doc id="480161" wikidata="Q10329451" url="?curid=480161" title="Michael Hopkins (architect)">
<text>Sir Michael John Hopkins (7 May 1935 – 17 June 2023) was an English architect.

The RIBA Royal Gold Medal-winning architect founded Hopkins Architects with his wife Patty and was widely regarded as among the greatest of contemporary British architectural figures. Michael, alongside Patty, was part of a small group of leading British architects who were regarded as the founders of the &quot;High-Tech&quot; architectural movement (the other four included Richard Rogers, Norman Foster, Nicholas Grimshaw and Terry Farrell).

==Life and career==
Hopkins was born in 1935 in Poole. His father, Gerald, was a builder and his mother, Barbara, decided at a young age that Hopkins would become an architect. Hopkins attended a public school in Sherborne. He studied architecture at the Bournemouth School of Art and worked with Basil Spence and Frederick Gibberd before, aged 23, enrolling at the Architectural Association in London.

While studying at the Architectural Institute, Hopkins met Patty Wainwright (later Hopkins), who would go on to be his lifelong collaborator. The couple married in 1962.

Hopkins partnered with Norman Foster, where he was the project architect of the Willis Faber headquarters in Ipswich. With Foster, Richard Rogers, Terry Farrell and Nicholas Grimshaw, both Hopkins and his wife were leading figures in the introduction of high-tech architecture into Britain.

In 1976, Hopkins set up what became Hopkins Architects in partnership with his wife, who had run her own practice. One of their first buildings was their own house in Hampstead, a lightweight steel structure with glass façades. Early Hopkins Architects&#x27; buildings, such as the Greene King brewery in Bury St Edmunds and the Schlumberger laboratories near Cambridge, used new materials and construction techniques. The firm challenged conventional architectural wisdom by demonstrating that lightweight steel-and-glass structures could be energy efficient and pioneered the use in Britain of permanent lightweight fabric structures, of which the Mound Stand at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground is a notable example. 

From the mid-1980s the practice began to explore what they called the &quot;updating of the traditional materials&quot;, adding to the expressive potential of traditional crafts like masonry and carpentry by combining them with contemporary engineering. The practice became recognised for its combination of ultra-modern techniques with traditional architecture, broadening their palette of materials and forms.

Together, the Hopkins received the Royal Institute of British Architects Royal Gold Medal, awarded in 1994. The citation describes the Hopkins&#x27; work as &quot;not only a matter of exploiting technology to build beautifully, nor simply of accommodating difficult and changing tasks in the most elegant way, but above all of capturing in stone and transmitting in bronze the finest aspirations of our age&quot;, praising their contribution to the debate about the &quot;delicate relationship between modernity and tradition&quot; and adding: &quot;For Hopkins, progress is no longer a break with the past but rather an act of continuity where he deftly and intelligently integrates traditional elements such as stone and wood, with advanced and environmentally responsible technology.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Patty and Michael&#x27;s three children, Sarah, Abigail and Joel, grew up in the Hopkins’ open-plan house in Hampstead, though the children later demanded that their bedrooms were given walls. All three children followed their parents into creative/design-based professions: Sarah is project director for the refurbishment of the National Gallery; Abigail became an architect and has a joint practice with her husband; and Joel is a BAFTA-winning film writer/ director. Hopkins had 11 grandchildren.

Hopkins died from vascular dementia on 17 June 2023, aged 88.

== Honours and awards ==
Hopkins’ contribution to architecture was recognised both with a CBE in 1989 and a knighthood in 1995 for Services to Architecture. In 2011 he was awarded the AJ100 Contribution to the Profession award. He was elected a Royal Academician in 1992 and two years later he was jointly awarded the RIBA Gold Medal for Architecture with Patty Hopkins.

<text>The yellow-billed cardinal (Paroaria capitata) is a bird species in the tanager family (Thraupidae). It is not very closely related to the cardinals proper (Cardinalidae).

It occurs in Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia, Uruguay, and northern Argentina and has been introduced on the island of Hawai&#x27;i. It breeds in moist shrubland. The yellow-billed cardinal could be easily confused with the red-crested cardinal. The yellow-billed cardinal does not have a crest.

<doc id="480170" wikidata="Q2183761" url="?curid=480170" title="Sutton Bonington">
<text>Sutton Bonington () is a village and civil parish lying along the valley of the River Soar in the Borough of Rushcliffe, south-west Nottinghamshire, England. The University of Nottingham has the Sutton Bonington Campus, a site just to the north of the village.

The parish covers some and includes the hamlet of Zouch. The population at the 2011 census was 2,202, rising to 2,338 at the 2021 census. The River Soar is the county boundary with Leicestershire and approximately to the north-west, in Leicestershire, is the large village of Kegworth. The nearest town is Loughborough, some by road to the south, and the nearest village is Normanton on Soar.

==History==
Originally, Sutton and Bonington were two settlements, probably originating in Anglo-Saxon times (the names likely derive from &quot;South farm&quot; and &quot;Buna&#x27;s farm&quot;); Sutton was to the south of Bonington. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the villages were recorded as &quot;Sudtone&quot; and &quot;Bonitone&quot;. The two villages gradually grew together along the edge of the flood plain of the River Soar to make one long, narrow village, which by 1340 had come by the name of &quot;Sutton Bonynton&quot;.

Today it continues to be a linear village, with much of the 20th century housing built along and just off Park Lane, making the Sutton part now larger than the Bonington part. Sutton Bonington Hall&#x27;s gardens and parkland are set between the two original settlements and create a gap in the built-up area, and each part continues to have its own pub and parish church. The most recent significant development are houses built on the former rectory gardens near St Anne&#x27;s Church, again enlarging the Sutton part. The total length of the village is now , not including the university campus.

The Midland Railway was constructed through the parish in 1840. Sir Cecil Paget, a notable locomotive engineer and railway administrator, was born in Sutton Bonington and in 1923 succeeded his father (Sir Ernest Paget, who was Chairman of the Midland Railway, 1890—1911) to become the 2nd Baronet Paget of Sutton Bonington. He died in 1936, without children (the title thereby becoming extinct), and was buried in the family plot at Marlepit Hill cemetery. The Paget family were the main landowners in the parish for much of the 19th century, owning the two ancient manors of St Anne and St Michael. It was under the Pagets that the current St Anne&#x27;s Manor house and parkland was built, in 1848.

===University===

The university campus was originally the Midland Agricultural and Dairy College, which formed in the first decades of the 20th century. The site was used as a prisoner of war camp during the First World War. In 1948 the college became part of the University of Nottingham.

The campus has steadily grown over the decades (the main part is now approximately 20 hectares) and in 2006 the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science opened. The residential aspect of the campus (&quot;Bonington Halls&quot; – it consists of a number of spread out halls and houses) has also grown substantially in recent years and is now managed by Campus Living Villages (CLV). A masterplan was created in 2008 for the campus and envisages its development over the coming years – growth at present is towards Landcroft Lane, whilst in the future a considerable expansion is planned northwards towards Melton Lane. In 2011 two new buildings will have been completed on the campus: the Gateway Building housing veterinary medicine and agricultural and environmental sciences (adjacent to the recently built veterinary sciences building) and the BioEnergy Centre which is a research centre for international brewing company SAB Miller.

==Features and amenities==
The village boasts a number of small shops, a Coffee shop, a post office, a village hall and library, a primary school, a doctor&#x27;s surgery and two pubs: The Anchor (in the Bonington part) and The King&#x27;s Head (in the Sutton part). A small industrial estate exists just outside the village on Rempstone Road.

The village also has two medieval churches, a result of the merging of the two original villages (Sutton and Bonington); they are St Michael&#x27;s Church (Bonington&#x27;s parish church, located on Main Street) and St Anne&#x27;s Church (Sutton&#x27;s church, located down St Anne&#x27;s Lane). The village has a large conservation area at its heart, with 25 listed buildings contained within it. Sutton Bonington Hall and St Anne&#x27;s Church are Grade II* (the remainder being Grade II). Sutton Bonington Hall is a country house largely erected in the Queen Anne period and is locally known as &quot;The Hall&quot;. In 1825 it came into the ownership of the Paget family and remained a residence until 2000; it has since gone into commercial use as a location for weddings, conferences and parties. There is a Methodist church and a Baptist church in the Sutton part of the village.

Aside from the main village, the parish contains a number of outlying areas of settlement, including the university campus and the hamlet of Zouch. There are also two adjacent clusters of housing towards West Leake, at the junctions of Landcroft Lane/Melton Lane and Melton Lane/Pithouse Lane/Trowell Lane. Within the latter cluster is a 200-year-old public house called the &quot;Star Inn&quot; known locally as &quot;Pit House&quot;, the Victoria County History for Sutton Bonington states that &quot;[i]t was also known as Pit House because it was used by miners from the gypsum ‘pits’.&quot; Between 1982 and 2004 specialist car manufacturer GTM Cars used buildings in Trowel Lane as their factory and offices. Since their departure to Coventry these were used by Talon Sportscars until July 2008.

In Zouch is the &quot;Rose and Crown&quot; pub. The &quot;Station Hotel&quot; was located adjacent to the former Kegworth railway station, lying just outwith the parish, but closed in 2011. Opposite the Hotel on Station Road are two further Listed buildings within the parish (in addition to the 25 in the village) at Sutton Fields – the House and its Lodge. The Kegworth Old Lock, replaced by the Kegworth Deep Lock in the mid-1980s, on the River Soar navigation, also lies within Sutton Bonington parish, and became Grade II Listed on 12 October 1987.

The Kingston Brook runs to the northeast of the parish, forming part of the boundary with West Leake parish. The boundary with Leicestershire is the River Soar and runs along the centre of the river. In places the river has more than one channel, and the boundary then runs at the centre of the widest channel of water, resulting in a number of islands falling within the parish, especially near Kegworth and at Zouch.

Adjacent to the main university campus is the University Farm, a 400 hectare (4 km2) commercial research farm, and an associated high-technology dairy centre; the farm partly lies in the neighbouring parish of Kingston on Soar, as does the dairy. Between the university campus and the railway line are offices (formerly a residence called &quot;The Elms&quot;) and a laboratory belonging to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, and a new sports hall and associated pitches.

===Sport===
Sutton Bonington Cricket Club was founded in 1824. There is a lawn bowls club and a tennis club, both situated at the junction of Marle Pit Hill and Landcroft Lane. Sutton Bonington F.C. has 3 male teams that currently play in the Leicestershire Senior League, County league and Sunday Charnwood League, they are based at the Recreation Ground on Main Street.

A Kickboxing club (PKA - Sutton Bonington) is based in the Village hall.

==Transport==
There were two railway stations close to the village: Kegworth station (closed in 1968) to the north and Hathern station (closed in 1960) to the south-east. In 2008, East Midlands Parkway station opened at Ratcliffe on Soar, approximately to the north, providing good links on the Midland Main Line which passes through the parish and on the eastern edge of the village in a cutting.

Junction 24 of the M1 motorway is only away, near Kegworth, and the East Midlands Airport is also nearby to the west. The A6006 &quot;Rempstone Road&quot; runs along the south-east boundary of the parish, and through Zouch, and leads to the A6.

The &quot;Skylink&quot; bus route serves the village and the university campus, with regular buses running between Nottingham city centre and Loughborough, including stops at Kegworth, the Airport, Long Eaton and Beeston. Another, less regular, bus service operates between Nottingham city centre and Normanton on Soar, via Clifton.

The long-distance footpath, the Midshires Way, passes through the parish, running from West Leake to Kegworth along Melton Lane and Station Road. Two of the country lanes in the parish (Landcroft Lane and Hungary Lane) were designated as &quot;quiet lanes&quot; in 2004, giving equal priority between vehicular traffic and pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders. The River Soar, which runs through Zouch and then along the western boundary of the parish, is canalised and is well used by small watercraft.

==Local government and elections==
The parish comes within the Soar Valley electoral district for purposes of electing a councillor to Nottinghamshire County Council. The most recent election was in 2009 when Linda Sykes, of the Conservative party, won the seat. For the election of a councillor to Rushcliffe Borough Council, the parish forms part of the Soar Valley ward, which covers a smaller area than the electoral district of the same name, and consists of the three parishes of Sutton Bonington, Kingston on Soar and Ratcliffe on Soar. The most recent election was in 2007 when Terry Holt, of the Liberal Democrats, won the seat. The next Borough election will be held in 2011.

The parish council has 11 councillors; there was an uncontested election for these seats in 2007.

The parish falls within the parliamentary constituency of Rushcliffe.

===Historic local government===
The parish fell within the ancient Rushcliffe wapentake of Nottinghamshire. The two ancient ecclesiastical parishes of Sutton and Bonington were also separate townships; they were united for civil purposes in 1829 and combined in 1923 into one ecclesiastical parish. Related to the situation of the two original parishes, Sutton and Bonington are separate manors, named after their churches – St Anne and St Michael respectively. From 1894 the parish was part of the Leake Rural District, until its abolition in 1935, when the parish was transferred to the Basford Rural District. In 1974 Basford Rural District was abolished and the non-metropolitan district of Rushcliffe was created, granted with borough status immediately, with Sutton Bonington becoming a part of it.

<text>The common myna or Indian myna (Acridotheres tristis), sometimes spelled mynah, is a bird in the family Sturnidae, native to Asia. An omnivorous open woodland bird with a strong territorial instinct, the common myna has adapted extremely well to urban environments.

The range of the common myna is increasing at such a rapid rate that in 2000 the IUCN Species Survival Commission declared it one of the world&#x27;s most invasive species and one of only three birds listed among &quot;100 of the World&#x27;s Worst Invasive Species&quot; that pose a threat to biodiversity, agriculture and human interests. In particular, the species poses a serious threat to the ecosystems of Australia, where it was named &quot;The Most Important Pest/Problem&quot; in 2008.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760, the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the common myna in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot;, based on a specimen that he mistakenly believed had been collected in the Philippines. He used the French name &quot;Le merle des Philippines&quot; and the Latin &quot;Merula Philippensis&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, they do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature.

When the Swedish naturalist, Carl Linnaeus, updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1766, for the 12th edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of them was the common myna. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Paradisea tristis&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The type location was subsequently corrected to Pondicherry in southern India. The specific name &quot;tristis&quot; is Latin for &quot;sad&quot; or &quot;gloomy&quot;. This species is now placed in the genus &quot;Acridotheres&quot; that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816. The generic name &quot;Acridotheres&quot; is from the Greek ακριδος (&quot;akridos&quot;), meaning locust, and θηρας (&quot;theras&quot;), meaning hunter.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* the Indian myna (&quot;A. t. tristis&quot;) (Linnaeus, 1766) – It is found from southern Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and eastern Iran to southern China, Indochina, the Malay Peninsula and southern India. It has also been introduced to Hawaii and North America. Populations from the northwest of its range have sometimes been separated as a distinct subspecies, A&quot;. t. neumanni&quot;, while populations from Nepal and Myanmar have been described as &quot;A. t. tristoides&quot;.
* the Sri Lankan myna (&quot;A. t. melanosternus&quot;) Legge, 1879 – Sri Lanka
The Sri Lankan subspecies &quot;melanosternus&quot; is darker than the Indian subspecies &quot;tristis&quot; and has half-black and half-white primary coverts and a larger yellow cheek-patch.

==Description==

The common myna is readily identified by the brown body, black hooded head and the bare yellow patch behind the eye. The bill and legs are bright yellow. They have rounded wings as well, and a round square tipped tail. There is a white patch on the outer primaries and the wing lining on the underside is white, as well as having a white tail tip. The sexes are similar and birds are usually seen in pairs.
The common myna obeys Gloger&#x27;s rule in that the birds from northwestern India tend to be paler than their darker counterparts in southern India.

===Vocalization===
The calls includes croaks, squawks, chirps, clicks, whistles and &#x27;growls&#x27;, and the bird often fluffs its feathers and bobs its head in singing. The common myna screeches warnings to its mate or other birds in cases of predators in proximity or when it is about to take off flying. Common mynas are popular as cage birds for their singing and &quot;speaking&quot; abilities. Before sleeping in communal roosts, common mynas vocalise in unison, which is known as &quot;communal noise&quot;.

===Morphometry===

==Distribution and habitat==

The common myna is native to Asia, with its initial home range spanning Iran, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, peninsular Thailand, Indochina, Japan (both mainland Japan and the Ryukyu Islands) and China.

The common myna has been introduced to many other parts of the world such as Canada, Australia, Israel, New Zealand, New Caledonia, Fiji, the United States (South Florida only), South Africa, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan Uzbekistan, the Cayman Islands, islands in the Indian Ocean (the Seychelles – from which it was subsequently eradicated at great expense, Mauritius, Réunion, Madagascar, the Maldives, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the Lakshadweep archipelago) and also in islands of the Atlantic (such as Ascension and Saint Helena, Pacific Ocean and Cyprus February 2022. The range of the common myna is increasing to the extent that in 2000 the IUCN Species Survival Commission declared it among 100 of the world&#x27;s worst invasive species.

It is typically found in open woodland, cultivation and around habitation. Although it is an adaptable species, its population is abnormal and very much considered a pest in Singapore (where it is locally called as &quot;gembala kerbau&quot;, literally &#x27;buffalo shepherd&#x27;) due to competition with the related introduced Javan myna.

The common myna thrives in urban and suburban environments; in Canberra, for instance, 110 common mynas were released between 1968 and 1971. By 1991, common myna population density in Canberra averaged 15 birds per square kilometer. Only three years later, a second study found an average population density of 75 birds per square kilometer in the same area.

The bird likely owes its success in the urban and suburban settings of Sydney and Canberra to its evolutionary origins; having evolved in the open woodlands of India, the common myna is pre-adapted to habitats with tall vertical structures and little to no vegetative ground cover, features characteristic of city streets and urban nature preserves.

The common myna (along with common starlings, house sparrows, and feral rock doves) is a nuisance to city buildings; its nests block gutters and drainpipes, causing water damage to building exteriors.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===

Common mynas are believed to pair for life. They breed through much of the year depending on the location, building their nest in a hole in a tree or wall. They breed at elevations of in the Himalayas.

The normal clutch size is 4–6 eggs. The average size of the egg is . The incubation period is 17 to 18 days and fledging period is 22 to 24 days. The Asian koel is sometimes brood parasitic on this species. Nesting material used by common mynas includes twigs, roots, tow and rubbish. Common mynas have been known to use tissue paper, tin foil and sloughed off snake-skin.

During the breeding season, the daytime activity-time budget of the common myna in Pune in April to June 1978 has been recorded to comprise the following: nesting activity (42%), scanning the environment (28%), locomotion (12%), feeding (4%), vocalisation (7%) and preening-related activities, interactions and other activities (7%).

The common myna uses the nests of woodpeckers, parakeets, etc. and easily takes to nest boxes; it has been recorded evicting the chicks of previously nesting pairs by holding them in the beak and later sometimes not even using the emptied nest boxes. This aggressive behaviour contributes to its success as an invasive species.

There is also some evidence that shows that in introduced environments, the species chooses to nest in more modified and artificial structures than in natural tree cavities when compared to native species.

===Food and feeding===
Like most starlings, the common myna is omnivorous. It feeds on insects, grubs, earthworms, arachnids, crustaceans, reptiles, small mammals, seeds, grain, fruits, flower nectar and petals, and discarded waste from human habitation. It forages on the ground among grass for insects, and especially for grasshoppers, from which it gets the generic name &quot;Acridotheres&quot;, &quot;grasshopper hunter&quot;. It, however, feeds on a wide range of insects, mostly picked from the ground. It is a cross-pollinator of flowers such as &quot;Salmalia&quot; and &quot;Erythrina&quot;. It walks on the ground with occasional hops and is an opportunistic feeder on the insects disturbed by grazing cattle as well as fired grass fields. They prey on eggs and young of other birds, such as Hawaiʻi ʻakepas (&quot;Loxops coccineus&quot;). They sometimes even wade in shallow waters to catch fish. Living in close proximity to human-made habitats, common mynas may also appear near roadsides to feed on roadkill.
===Roosting behaviour===
Common mynas roost communally throughout the year, either in pure or mixed flocks with jungle mynas, rosy starlings, house crows, jungle crows, cattle egrets and rose-ringed parakeets and other birds. The roost population can range from less than one hundred to thousands. The time of arrival of mynas at the roost starts before and ends just after sunset. The mynas depart before sunrise. The time and timespan of arrival and departure, time taken for final settlement at the roost, duration of communal sleep, flock size and population vary seasonally.

The function of communal roosting is to synchronise various social activities, avoid predators, exchange information about food sources.

Communal displays (pre-roosting and post-roosting) consist of aerial maneuvers which are exhibited in the pre-breeding season (November to March). It is assumed that this behaviour is related to pair formation.

==Invasive species==

The IUCN declared the common myna as one of only three birds among the world&#x27;s 100 worst invasive species (the other two being the red-vented bulbul and the common starling).
The French introduced it in the 18th century from Pondicherry to Mauritius with the aim of controlling insects, even levying a fine on anyone persecuting the bird. It has since been introduced widely elsewhere, including adjacent areas in Southeast Asia, Madagascar, the Middle East, South Africa, the United States, Argentina, Germany, Spain and Portugal, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and various oceanic islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, including prominent populations in Fiji and Hawaii.

The common myna is regarded as a pest in South Africa, North America, the Middle East, Australia, New Zealand and many Pacific islands. It is particularly problematic in Australia. Several methods have been tried to control the bird&#x27;s numbers and protect native species.

===Australia===

In Australia, the common myna is an invasive pest. They are often the predominant bird in urban areas along the whole east coast. In a 2008 popular vote, the bird was named &quot;The Most Important Pest/Problem&quot; in Australia. They have earned the nickname &quot;flying rats&quot;, due to their numbers and their scavenging behaviour. They are also known as &quot;the cane toad of the sky&quot;. However, there is little scientific consensus concerning the extent of its impact on native species. 

The common myna was first introduced to Australia between 1863 and 1872, in Victoria, to control insects in the market gardens of Melbourne. At about the same time, the bird is likely to have spread to New South Wales, where it is currently most populous, but documentation is uncertain. The bird was later introduced to Queensland as a predator of grasshoppers and cane beetles. Common myna populations in Australia are now concentrated along the eastern coast around Sydney and its surrounding suburbs, with sparser populations in Victoria and a few isolated communities in Queensland. During 2009, several municipal councils in New South Wales began trials of catching myna birds in an effort to reduce numbers.

The myna can live and breed in a wide range of temperatures, ranging from the frosty winters of Canberra to the tropical climate of Cairns. Self-sustaining populations have been found in regions with a mean monthly highest temperature no less than and a mean monthly lowest temperature no less than , implying that the common myna could spread from Sydney northwards along the eastern coast to Cairns, and westwards along the southern coast to Adelaide, but not to Tasmania, Darwin, or the arid outback regions.

===Europe===
In 2019, common mynas were added to the List of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern. They have established in Spain and Portugal and were introduced to France, where they occasionally bred.

===New Zealand===
The common myna was introduced to both the North Island and South Island of New Zealand in the 1870s. However, the cooler summer temperatures in the South Island appear to have impeded the breeding success rate of the southern populations, preventing the proliferation of the species, which was largely non-existent there by the 1890s. In contrast, the North Island population was able to breed more successfully and large portions of the North Island are now populated. However, in the southern reaches of the North Island, the cooler summer temperatures, like those of the South Island, have prevented the establishment of large myna populations. Since the 1950s, mynas have spread northwards and presently inhabit beyond the Waikato region, leading to a majority of its successful population thriving upon lower latitude regions due to the warmer climate. At present, mynas have become especially common in regions of lower latitude, particularly the Northland region, but rarely found south of Whanganui.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, where it escaped into the wild in 1902, it has become very common and its distribution is greater where human populations are greater or where there is more human disturbance. The bird is also notorious for being a pest, kicking other birds out of their nests and killing their young due to the myna&#x27;s strong territorial instinct. It is considered somewhat of a major pest and disturbance of the natural habitat; as a result, it has been declared an invasive species, requiring it to be controlled.

Morphological studies show that the process of spatial sorting is at work on the range expansion of &quot;A. tristis&quot; in South Africa. Dispersal-relevant traits are significantly correlated with distance from the range core, with strong sexual dimorphism, indicative of sex-biased dispersal. Morphological variations are significant in wing and head traits of females, suggesting females as the primary dispersing sex. In contrast, traits not related to dispersal such as those associated with foraging show no signs of spatial sorting but are significantly affected by environmental variables such as vegetation and intensity of urbanisation. To study the invasion genetics and landscape-scale dynamics of &quot;A. tristis&quot; in South Africa, scientists have recently developed 16 polymorphic nuclear microsatellite markers using the next generation sequencing (NGS) approach.

===The United States===
In Hawaii, it is out-competing many native birds for food and nesting areas.

===Effect on ecosystems and humans===

====Threat to native birds====
The common myna is a hollow-nesting species; that is, it nests and breeds in protected hollows found either naturally in trees or artificially on buildings (for example, recessed windowsills or low eaves). Compared to native hollow-nesting species, the common myna is extremely aggressive, and breeding males will actively defend areas ranging up to 0.83 hectares in size (though males in densely populated urban settings tend to only defend the area immediately surrounding their nests).

This aggressiveness has enabled the common myna to displace many breeding pairs of native hollow-nesters, thereby reducing their reproductive success. In Australia, their aggressiveness has enabled them to chase native birds as large as galahs out of their nests.

The common myna is also known to maintain up to two roosts simultaneously; a temporary summer roost close to a breeding site (where the entire local male community sleeps during the summer, the period of highest aggression), and a permanent all-year roost where the female broods and incubates overnight. Both male and female common mynas will fiercely protect both roosts at all times, leading to further exclusion of native birds.

====Threat to crops and pasture====
The common myna (which feeds mostly on ground-dwelling insects, tropical fruits such as grapes, plums and some berries and, in urban areas, discarded human food) poses a serious threat to Australian blueberry crops, though its main threat is to native bird species.

In Hawaii, where the common myna was introduced to control pest armyworms and cutworms in sugarcane crops, the bird has helped to spread the robust &quot;Lantana camara&quot; weed across the islands&#x27; open grasslands. It also has been recorded as the fourth-ranking avian pest in the fruit industry by a 2004 survey of the Hawaiian Farm Bureau and the sixth in number of complaints of avian pests overall.

Common mynas can cause considerable damage to ripening fruit, particularly grapes, but also figs, apples, pears, strawberries, blueberries, guava, mangoes and breadfruit. Cereal crops such as maize, wheat and rice are susceptible where they occur near urban areas. Roosting and nesting commensal with humans create aesthetic and health concerns. Common mynas are known to carry avian malaria and exotic parasites such as the &quot;Ornithonyssus bursia&quot; mite, which can cause dermatitis in humans. The common myna can help spread agricultural weeds: for example, it spreads the seeds of &quot;Lantana camara&quot;, which has been classed as a Weed of National Significance because of its invasiveness. Common mynas are regularly observed to usurp nests and hollows, destroy the eggs and kill the young of native bird species, including seabirds and parrots. There is evidence that common mynas have killed small land
mammals such as mice, squirrels and possums, but further research on these occurrences is under consideration.

===Control===
The common myna, being a major agricultural pest and posing a threat to native species in non-native countries, is controlled by various factors. Mynas are either killed or chased away as control. Poison, shooting, cage traps, and bird-scaring devices are currently used for control.

== In culture==
In Sanskrit literature, the common myna has a number of names, most are descriptive of the appearance or behaviour of the bird. In addition to &quot;saarika&quot;, the names for the common myna include &quot;kalahapriya&quot;, which means &quot;one who is fond of arguments&quot; referring to the quarrelsome nature of this bird; &quot;chitranetra&quot;, meaning &quot;picturesque eyes&quot;; &quot;peetanetra&quot; (one with yellow eyes) and &quot;peetapaad&quot; (one with yellow legs).

The bird called &quot;śārikā&quot; () seems to refer to the common myna, though there are other candidates.

<doc id="480174" wikidata="Q7895993" url="?curid=480174" title="University of Nottingham Halls of Residence">
<text>This is a list of halls of residence on the various campuses of the University of Nottingham in Nottingham, England.

The University of Nottingham has a particularly well developed system of halls located on its campus. The halls acts a microcosms of the university at large and provide a community-level forum for the interaction of undergraduates, postgraduates and senior academics.

As of 2020, incoming undergraduate students do not apply for a specific hall but a room type and a &#x27;zone&#x27;; they can be allocated into any of the halls in that zone. The zones are as follows:

Central Zone: Derby and Hugh Stewart

North Zone: Cripps and Lenton &amp; Wortley

Sports Zone: Ancaster, Nightingale, Rutland and Sherwood

West Zone: Cavendish, Florence Boot and Willoughby

Quiet Zone: Lincoln (part of a trial for 2020, aimed at students in search of a quieter lifestyle with no alcohol and earlier quiet hours.)

The halls are generally named either after counties, districts or places in the English East Midlands (Nottingham having been originally conceived as a regional university for this area) or significant people associated with the university. Beeston, Lenton, Lincoln, Derby, Rutland, Sherwood, Newark, Southwell, Ancaster and Melton halls fall into the former category; Hugh Stewart, Cripps, Cavendish, Nightingale, Florence Boot, Wortley and Willoughby into the latter.

==University Park Campus==

All halls of residence on University Park Campus are of mixed-sex undergraduate type.

===Ancaster===

Ancaster Hall () provides accommodation for about 270 students. The current warden is Professor Svenja Adolphs. It has a particularly high proportion of ensuite rooms. 
Ancaster Hall was the first &quot;mixed sex&quot; hall of residence at Nottingham University - and had a vibrant reputation very much managed by its first Warden - Dr Virginia van der Lande.

Notable alumni
* London Grammar – British trip hop trio. The band are said to have practised using the piano that was located in the bar/study area, now located in the dining area.
===Cavendish===

Cavendish Hall () provides accommodation for 278 students. The hall is named after the Cavendish family or, more specifically, the Duke of Devonshire. The hall surrounds a lawn quadrangle, with its own rose garden and is reached via a bridge over a grass moat. A short walk brings guests to the university boating lake.
===Cripps===
Cripps Hall () provides accommodation for over 300 students. The hall is named after its benefactor, Sir Cyril Cripps. It opened in 1959 and was originally all male, but has been mixed sex since 2000. Cripps Hall was designed by the architects Donald McMorran and George Whitby, and is Grade II listed (one of only relatively few post-war buildings to be given such status).

Built around traditional quads, the Dining Hall is notable in being wood-panelled with several paintings of former Wardens above it a Library and functional bell tower. There is also a junior common room and a bar room with pool table, though it does not serve drinks; the nearest licensed Campus Bar being at neighbouring Hugh Stewart Hall.

Owing to a substantial donation from the Cripps Foundation to build a brand new Health Centre opposite the hall, the old Cripps Health Centre was converted into an extra accommodation block for Cripps Hall for the start of the 2018–19 academic year; it is named &#x27;Lower Cripps&#x27; and added a further 55 rooms to the hall. This brings the total number of rooms to 368, making it the largest catered hall on the University Park campus.

Alumni and current students resident in Cripps Hall can join the Cripps Hall Association which is the membership arm of the Cripps Hall Trust. The Association reflects the original Hall Founder’s principles of community and fellowship, allowing former students to remain connected and offer something back to the Hall. The Cripps Hall Trust (Registered Charity No: 528348) exists to support existing and past members of Cripps Hall through the provision of travel scholarships to encourage personal development and benefits to the wider community, discretionary grants for additional Hall facilities, support for cases of individual hardship, and on-going membership / communication services. These include the Harry Lucas Travel Scholarships assisting students travelling to expand their education.

===Derby===
Derby Hall () provides accommodation for over 300 students. The hall is named after the local city of Derby. The hall, completed in 1963, was designed by the New Zealand architect, Brian O&#x27;Rorke, in classical style around a central quad. An extension block named Matlock was later added, greatly increasing accommodation by adding 96 rooms.
===Florence Boot===

Florence Boot Hall () provides accommodation for just under 200 students. The hall is named after Florence Boot, the wife of Jesse Boot, the first Lord Trent, a major benefactor to the university. The hall was designed by Percy Richard Morley Horder. It was opened in 1928, making it the oldest hall on the campus (Hugh Stewart Hall has existed for longer as Lenton Hall, but Florence Boot has been designated as a hall for longer). It was originally all female, but has been mixed sex since 2000. 
===Hugh Stewart===
Hugh Stewart Hall () is the largest hall on University Park Campus (the third largest at the university), providing accommodation for around 340 students. The hall is named after Hugh Stewart (1884–1934), who was Principal of University College Nottingham from 1929 until his death. Until 2000, the hall was all male. The oldest part of Hugh Stewart Hall was originally called Lenton Hall and was built in about 1792, by the architect William Stretton, as a home for Nottingham banker and owner of the Butterley Company, John Wright. This oldest part is known as Warden&#x27;s House and is Grade II listed. The hall was extended in 1937, at which time it was renamed Hugh Stewart. It was extended again in 1969.

The Hall&#x27;s Warden is Professor Glenn McDowell. He is also Warden of Lenton &amp; Wortley and Cripps Halls, and Head of the Department of Civil Engineering. The Deputy Warden is Ms Stacy Johnson of the School of Nursing, who was Warden from September 2005 – 2010 and took over from archaeologist Dr Jon Henderson; he unexpectedly had to resign due to academic commitments, having been warden for only a year. He was preceded by Dr. Don Rees, who had been Warden of the hall for 29 years, and after whom the hall library is named. The hall features &#x27;Latitude&#x27;, one of four licensed hall bars on campus. 
===Lenton &amp; Wortley===

Lenton and Wortley Hall () is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. Like Cripps Hall, it was designed by Donald McMorran and George Whitby. It provides accommodation for around 283 students, making it the third largest hall on campus. Lenton and Wortley Hall is located in the &#x27;North Zone&#x27;, along with Cripps Hall, and lies between Derby Road and Beeston Lane. The Hall consists of blocks 1-12 and one en-suite block, Wortley House.

The hall results from the amalgamation of two previous halls of residence, New Lenton Hall and Wortley Hall, named after the local district of Lenton and Professor Harry Almond Saville Wortley, Principal of University College Nottingham from 1935 to 1947, as well as Lenton Hurst. Lenton Hurst, a large old house by the architect Arthur George Marshall next to the Lenton Hall (then so called), was until the 1970s used for student accommodation. The Hall is home to Hops, one of the four cafe-bars on campus. Between 1980 and 2006, the Warden was Mr William Hooker. Professor Glenn McDowell, who was previously warden of Nightingale Hall, was Warden until 2019.

The hall is represented by its crest, which notably features the hall&#x27;s symbolic animal, a squirrel, and a fir tree designed to represent the nearby fir trees; the large fir tree provides a focal point to the hall&#x27;s main quad. The crest is believed to be designed around the conception of the halls and has the Latin motto &quot;Desiderium nostrum servire&quot;, which translates to &quot;Our desire to serve&quot;.

===Lincoln===
Lincoln Hall () is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for about 221 students. The hall is named after the nearby East Midlands city of Lincoln. The current Hall Warden is Prof Vicky Chapman.

The Hall was designed by the Nottingham architect F.E. Wooley and opened in 1962; until 1997, it was an all-male hall. The buildings overlook parkland at the rear and form two main courts. The rectangular lower court consists of 12 self-contained accommodation blocks, each named after places found in the county of Lincolnshire. The upper court features the dining hall, the Coveney Library, the Senior Common Room and the gatehouse, all enclosing a circular lawn. Two gilded herons, the Hall&#x27;s emblem, adorn the wrought iron gates leading to the park.

Notable alumni
* Sir John Henry Hayes – MP for South Holland and the Deepings in Lincolnshire since 1997 and former Minister of State for Transport; President of Lincoln JCR
* Levison Wood – explorer and writer 
===Nightingale===

Nightingale Hall () is the smallest hall of residence on campus with accommodation for 150 students. The hall opened in 1950. The first warden was the historian and poet Audrey Beecham. The hall was refurbished in 1998 and again in 2007.

It is named after the nursing pioneer Florence Nightingale, and originally stored the university&#x27;s collection of documents and memorabilia associated with her, although this is now stored in the Hallward Library and the Florence Nightingale Museum in Southwark, London. Until 2000, the hall was all female, but it is now mixed. The Hall was one of the first to offer students &#x27;large study bedroom&#x27; accommodation in September 2007, in which the rooms are fitted with three-quarter sized beds and a mini fridge; this is now common across all of University Park. The present warden is Professor Jan Bradley.
===Rutland===
Rutland Hall () provides accommodation for 284 students. It is named after both the East Midlands county of Rutland and the Duke of Rutland himself. The hall was originally opened in 1964, as part of a large expansion of the university during that period. It was originally a men&#x27;s hall, but it and Ancaster became the university&#x27;s first mixed halls in 1970. By the 1990s, it was clear that more accommodation was needed. Therefore, in 1993, a new, en suite wing was built—K Block. The building was completely refurbished in the summer of 1999. A particularly notable feature of the building is the unusual shape of its library, which is an octagon.
===Sherwood===
Sherwood Hall () is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for about 267 students. The hall was designed by the architects J Fletcher Watson as part of the 1960s expansion programme on University Park. Building work started in March 1963 and the hall opened, as a male hall of residence, in October 1964.

Sherwood Hall was designed as an interpretation of the traditional collegiate quadrangle, but using contemporary forms and materials. A distinctive feature is the white painted shiplap weatherboarding, which gives the hall something of a North American feel. As originally built, the hall had a single quadrangle of accommodation blocks, with a further accommodation block and the main hall and library forming a second, but open-ended, court. Subsequent extensions have transformed this into a second quadrangle. For the first twenty-two years of its life, the warden was the late W. R. &quot;Bunny&quot; Chalmers; he was succeeded in 2006 by Prof. Antonino La Rocca.

===Willoughby===

Willoughby Hall () is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence, built in 1964, and was a female hall at its inception, though now mixed for some time. It provides accommodation for around 260 students. The hall is named after the local Willoughby (or Willughby) family, whose family home Wollaton Hall is adjacent to the university campus. 2007 saw the addition of The Mix, now named Vesper, the largest of the 4 remaining hall bars on campus. It also features a TV room alongside the JCR; in addition to a study room, it also features a centrally timetabled seminar room known as the Machicado Suite and boardroom (Morton Colville Suite). The hall is located near the west entrance of the university, close to Broadgate Park.
==Jubilee Campus==
As of September 2011 all of the Jubilee Campus halls fall under the authority of a single warden. At present the Jubilee Campus halls warden is Dr Slawomir Sujeki.

===Melton===
Melton Hall is the university&#x27;s only postgraduate hall of residence, and is named after the local town of Melton Mowbray. It provides accommodation for roughly 140 students in en-suite bedrooms and, along with the rest of the first stage of the campus, was designed by Sir Michael Hopkins. The hall is self-catered, with each kitchen shared by up to thirteen students. There are two common rooms and one study room. 
===Newark===
Newark Hall is an undergraduate hall of residence named after the local town of Newark, sharing its coat of arms and motto &quot;Deo Fretus Erumpe&quot; (&quot;Trust in God and Sally Forth&quot;). Housing about 400 students, this makes it the second largest hall of residence in the university (after Bonington Hall). As the rest of the campus, it was designed by Sir Michael Hopkins in the shape of an eight framing two quads surrounded by the building. The current warden is Dr Slawomir Sujecki. Unlike University Park halls, Newark does not have its own catering facilities, residents instead eat in the nearby Atrium restaurant with Southwell residents.
===Southwell===
Southwell Hall is an undergraduate hall of residence named after the local town of Southwell. It houses about 200 students, and along with the rest of the first stage of the campus, was designed by Sir Michael Hopkins. The administrative team also cover Melton Hall. Unlike University Park halls, Southwell does not have its own catering facilities, residents instead eat in the nearby Atrium restaurant with Newark residents.
==Sutton Bonington Campus==
Bonington Halls is the name given by the university to the student accommodation (halls of residence) at Sutton Bonington Campus. It is a mixed-sex hall holding both undergraduates and postgraduates. In reality, it is not really a single hall, but a number of small separate &quot;halls&quot; and &quot;houses&quot; of varying age and design, holding between eight and sixty people, in addition to a shared dining room, laundry and bar. Bonington Halls house approximately 650 students. This makes it the university&#x27;s largest hall of residence (regaining the title from Jubilee&#x27;s Newark hall). The halls have a single JCR committee, but this operates more along the lines of the entertainment committee of the Student Guild as it arranges activities for both the residents of Bonington Halls and those students studying at Sutton Bonington but living off campus. The houses and halls at Sutton Bonington are named after local villages and are as follows:

* Kingston – the oldest hall, built just before the First World War and used to house German POWs during the war; until recently it was an all-male hall
* Normanton – originally built as an all-female hall, and remained so until recently
* Wymeswold
* Ratcliffe
* Rempstone
* Kegworth
* Dishley
* Hathern
* Lockington
* Zouch
* Stanford
* Barton
* Costock
* Thrumpton
* Eviton House – postgraduate-only house at the far end of the arboretum
* St. Michaels Flats – located nearer the village itself, these house students with families, mainly international students

==University-arranged self-catering accommodation==

*Broadgate Park is a collection of self catered student accommodation of some 2400 undergraduate and postgraduate students. It is operated privately by UPP (Broadgate Park) Ltd and is situated immediately to the southwest of University Park, between the campus and the town of Beeston. The current Warden is Dr Anna Pelekanou.
*Raleigh Park is a self-catering hall located close to Jubilee Campus, though not very close to the university campus. It is owned and operated by Derwent Living. It consists of five courts: Sillitoe, Madison, Roddice, Byron and Chatterley.
*St. Peter&#x27;s Court is a self-catering hall, owned and managed by Unite, who run numerous other third party halls across the country. Recently extended it can now house over 800 students all with en suite rooms.
*Cloister House is a self-catering hall, owned and managed by UPP (Broadgate Park) Ltd, housing almost 70 postgraduate students outside the south east corner of University Park in the Dunkirk area.
*Albion House is a self-catering hall, owned and managed by UPP (Broadgate Park) Ltd, housing mainly undergraduate students and situated in the town of Beeston.

==Defunct Halls==

===Beeston===
Beeston Hall provided accommodation for 225 students between 2018-2023. It opened in the 2018–19 academic year owing to an accommodation shortage. Built on the site of the old sports centre, which preceded the new David Ross Sports Village, it was constructed of ‘modular” buildings, provided by Portakabin. The first intake of students were notably housed in hotels across the city until November 2018, as the building was not complete in time for the start of the academic year. A JCR (junior common room) was added soon after opening, residents previously used facilities at Nightingale. There was no dining room; residents dined at the nearby Rutland Hall. The hall was intended to be used for just two years, this was extended up to the 2022-23 academic year, at the end of which the buildings were dismantled. 
University Hall was a hall-grouping to which all off-campus students belonged in the days before such a group became so large that it was meaningless to attempt to make it conform with the halls system. The hall was dissolved in the 1990s.

Wortley Hall was a hall named after the last Principal of University College Nottingham, Harry Wortley. It was located in the extreme north of University Park in Lenton Firs House. The hall was subsumed by New Lenton Hall in the 1980s, with the School of Architecture (now the School of the Built Environment) taking over the occupation of Lenton Firs.

== Facilities ==

Facilities vary by hall, but most halls have a bar, common room, study room, pantries (with kettle, sink, fridge/freezer and microwave) and laundry facilities. Melton Hall is self-catered, and has full kitchens rather than pantries. Rooms vary in size and equipment; most rooms on University Park have shared bathroom facilities, while all rooms on Jubilee Campus have en-suite bathrooms. The basic equipment provided with a bedroom includes a bed (usually a half-double), wardrobe, bedside table, desk, chair, lamp, pinboard and mirror. Internet access is provided, with both wired and wireless connections available. Undergraduate rooms include a small fridge.

<text>An infinitesimal rotation matrix or differential rotation matrix is a matrix representing an infinitely small rotation.

While a rotation matrix is an orthogonal matrix formula_1 representing an element of formula_2 (the special orthogonal group), the differential of a rotation is a skew-symmetric matrix formula_3 in the tangent space formula_4 (the special orthogonal Lie algebra), which is not itself a rotation matrix.

An infinitesimal rotation matrix has the form

:formula_5

where formula_6 is the identity matrix, formula_7 is vanishingly small, and formula_8

For example, if formula_9 representing an infinitesimal three-dimensional rotation about the -axis, a basis element of formula_10

:formula_11

The computation rules for infinitesimal rotation matrices are as usual except that infinitesimals of second order are routinely dropped. With these rules, these matrices do not satisfy all the same properties as ordinary finite rotation matrices under the usual treatment of infinitesimals. It turns out that &quot;the order in which infinitesimal rotations are applied is irrelevant&quot;.

==Discussion==
An infinitesimal rotation matrix is a skew-symmetric matrix where:
* As any rotation matrix has a single real eigenvalue, which is equal to +1, the corresponding eigenvector defines the rotation axis.
* Its module defines an infinitesimal angular displacement.

The shape of the matrix is as follows:
formula_12

===Associated quantities===
Associated to an infinitesimal rotation matrix formula_13 is an &quot;infinitesimal rotation tensor&quot; formula_14:

formula_15

Dividing it by the time difference yields the &quot;angular velocity tensor&quot;:

:formula_16

==Order of rotations==

These matrices do not satisfy all the same properties as ordinary finite rotation matrices under the usual treatment of infinitesimals. To understand what this means, consider

:formula_17

First, test the orthogonality condition, . The product is

:formula_18

differing from an identity matrix by second-order infinitesimals, discarded here. So, to first order, an infinitesimal rotation matrix is an orthogonal matrix.

Next, examine the square of the matrix,

:formula_19

Again discarding second-order effects, note that the angle simply doubles. This hints at the most essential difference in behavior, which we can exhibit with the assistance of a second infinitesimal rotation,

:formula_20

Compare the products to ,

:formula_21

Since formula_22 is second-order, we discard it: thus, to first order, multiplication of infinitesimal rotation matrices is &quot;commutative&quot;. In fact,

:formula_23

again to first order. In other words, .

This useful fact makes, for example, derivation of rigid body rotation relatively simple. But one must always be careful to distinguish (the first-order treatment of) these infinitesimal rotation matrices from both finite rotation matrices and from Lie algebra elements. When contrasting the behavior of finite rotation matrices in the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula above with that of infinitesimal rotation matrices, where all the commutator terms will be second-order infinitesimals, one finds a bona fide vector space. Technically, this dismissal of any second-order terms amounts to Group contraction.

== Generators of rotations ==
Suppose we specify an axis of rotation by a unit vector [&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;], and suppose we have an infinitely small rotation of angle Δ&quot;θ&quot; about that vector. Expanding the rotation matrix as an infinite addition, and taking the first-order approach, the rotation matrix Δ&quot;R&quot; is represented as:
: formula_24

A finite rotation through angle &quot;θ&quot; about this axis may be seen as a succession of small rotations about the same axis. Approximating Δ&quot;θ&quot; as &quot;θ&quot;/&quot;N&quot;, where &quot;N&quot; is a large number, a rotation of &quot;θ&quot; about the axis may be represented as:
: formula_25

It can be seen that Euler&#x27;s theorem essentially states that &quot;all&quot; rotations may be represented in this form. The product &quot;Aθ&quot; is the &quot;generator&quot; of the particular rotation, being the vector associated with the matrix &quot;A&quot;. This shows that the rotation matrix and the axis-angle format are related by the exponential function.

One can derive a simple expression for the generator &quot;G&quot;. One starts with an arbitrary plane defined by a pair of perpendicular unit vectors &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. In this plane one can choose an arbitrary vector &quot;x&quot; with perpendicular &quot;y&quot;. One then solves for &quot;y&quot; in terms of &quot;x&quot; and substituting into an expression for a rotation in a plane yields the rotation matrix &quot;R&quot;, which includes the generator .

:formula_26

To include vectors outside the plane in the rotation one needs to modify the above expression for &quot;R&quot; by including two projection operators that partition the space. This modified rotation matrix can be rewritten as an exponential function.

: formula_27

Analysis is often easier in terms of these generators, rather than the full rotation matrix. Analysis in terms of the generators is known as the Lie algebra of the rotation group.

== Exponential map ==

Connecting the Lie algebra to the Lie group is the exponential map, which is defined using the standard matrix exponential series for For any skew-symmetric matrix , is always a rotation matrix.

An important practical example is the case. In rotation group SO(3), it is shown that one can identify every with an Euler vector , where is a unit magnitude vector.

By the properties of the identification , is in the null space of . Thus, is left invariant by and is hence a rotation axis.

Using Rodrigues&#x27; rotation formula on matrix form with , together with standard double angle formulae one obtains,
: formula_28
This is the matrix for a rotation around axis by the angle in half-angle form. For full detail, see exponential map SO(3).

Notice that for infinitesimal angles second-order terms can be ignored and remains 

==Relationship to skew-symmetric matrices==

Skew-symmetric matrices over the field of real numbers form the tangent space to the real orthogonal group formula_29 at the identity matrix; formally, the special orthogonal Lie algebra. In this sense, then, skew-symmetric matrices can be thought of as &quot;infinitesimal rotations&quot;.

Another way of saying this is that the space of skew-symmetric matrices forms the Lie algebra formula_30 of the Lie group formula_31 The Lie bracket on this space is given by the commutator:

:formula_32

It is easy to check that the commutator of two skew-symmetric matrices is again skew-symmetric:

: formula_33

The matrix exponential of a skew-symmetric matrix formula_13 is then an orthogonal matrix formula_35:

:formula_36

The image of the exponential map of a Lie algebra always lies in the connected component of the Lie group that contains the identity element. In the case of the Lie group formula_37 this connected component is the special orthogonal group formula_38 consisting of all orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. So formula_39 will have determinant +1. Moreover, since the exponential map of a connected compact Lie group is always surjective, it turns out that &quot;every&quot; orthogonal matrix with unit determinant can be written as the exponential of some skew-symmetric matrix. In the particular important case of dimension formula_40 the exponential representation for an orthogonal matrix reduces to the well-known polar form of a complex number of unit modulus. Indeed, if formula_40 a special orthogonal matrix has the form
:formula_42

with formula_43. Therefore, putting formula_44 and formula_45 it can be written
:formula_46

which corresponds exactly to the polar form formula_47 of a complex number of unit modulus.

The exponential representation of an orthogonal matrix of order formula_48 can also be obtained starting from the fact that in dimension formula_48 any special orthogonal matrix formula_35 can be written as formula_51 where formula_52 is orthogonal and S is a block diagonal matrix with formula_53 blocks of order 2, plus one of order 1 if formula_48 is odd; since each single block of order 2 is also an orthogonal matrix, it admits an exponential form. Correspondingly, the matrix &quot;S&quot; writes as exponential of a skew-symmetric block matrix formula_55 of the form above, formula_56 so that formula_57 exponential of the skew-symmetric matrix formula_58 Conversely, the surjectivity of the exponential map, together with the above-mentioned block-diagonalization for skew-symmetric matrices, implies the block-diagonalization for orthogonal matrices.

<text>Miranda () is a suburb in southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The suburb is known as a commercial centre for the southern suburbs. Miranda is 24 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district, in the Sutherland Shire.

==History==
Thomas Holt (1811–88) owned the land that stretched from Sutherland to Cronulla. James Murphy, the manager of the Holt estate named the area after Miranda, a character in the William Shakespeare play &quot;The Tempest&quot;. In a 1921 letter, James Murphy said &quot;the name Miranda was given to the locality by me as manager of the Holt Sutherland Company which I formed in 1881. I thought it a soft, euphonious, musical and appropriate name for a beautiful place.&quot; It is believed that the character in the play was named after Miranda de Ebro, a town in Spain.

In 1918, the Miranda War Memorial was built in the grounds of the then Miranda Public School (now part of Miranda Westfield).

By the 1920s, steam trams operated between Cronulla and Sutherland, via Miranda. The trip from Miranda to Sutherland took fifteen minutes and cost three pence (2.5 cents). In 1923 there were five shops in Miranda, including a post office and butcher, at the intersection of the main road from Sutherland and Port Hacking Road. Settlements of returned soldiers from World War I were well established in Miranda at this time and the area was considered to be one of the best fruit-growing and poultry farming areas.

In 1955, Miranda Library opened.

In 1968, the war memorial moved to the cul-de-sac at the end of Central Road.

==Commercial areas==

Miranda is the main retail and commercial centre of the Sutherland Shire with shops located on either side of the railway line.

Westfield Miranda (previously known as Miranda Fair) is large shopping centre in the middle of the suburb, adjacent to the Miranda railway station.

There are also two smaller shopping centres nearby, Lederer Shopping Centre Miranda (previously known as Parkside Plaza) and The Kiora Centre. Miranda also has a shopping strip, running along Kingsway and Kiora Road. Numerous commercial developments are also located on these roads and surrounding streets.

Miranda also has a light industrial area located in the north part of the centre and is located on Port Hacking and Box Roads.

The Miranda Hotel is also located on Kingsway and was formerly the Miranda Rex. It was originally designed in the 1950s by Lipson &amp; Kadd who also designed the Padstow Hotel.

==Transport==
* Kingsway, Port Hacking Road, The Boulevarde and Kiora Road are the main roads through Miranda. Until 2002 a Miranda landmark was called &quot;the number one black spot in the State for minor accidents,&quot; the five-ways roundabout which intersected The Boulevard, Kiora Road and Port Hacking Road. An AUD$8m project was completed from 25 February 2002 – 20 November 2002 to remove the roundabout and implement a series of traffic lights at the intersection. Collisions at the intersection fell from 222 in 2002 to 13 in 2003.
* Miranda railway station is on the Cronulla branch of the Illawarra railway line on the Sydney Trains network. The railway station gives quick access to Cronulla Beach by train and also to Sydney Airport and the Sydney CBD.
* Maianbar Bundeena Bus Service, Transit Systems and U-Go Mobility provide bus service to Miranda. For full route details see Miranda station.

<doc id="480182" wikidata="Q709723" url="?curid=480182" title="James M. McPherson">
<text>James Munro McPherson (born October 11, 1936) is an American historian specializing in the American Civil War. He is the George Henry Davis &#x27;86 Professor Emeritus of United States History at Princeton University. He received the 1989 Pulitzer Prize for &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era&quot;. McPherson was the president of the American Historical Association in 2003.

==Early life and education==
Born in Valley City, North Dakota, McPherson graduated from St. Peter High School in St. Peter, Minnesota, and received his Bachelor of Arts in 1958 from Gustavus Adolphus College, also in St. Peter, from which he graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot;. He received his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1963, where he studied under C. Vann Woodward.

==Career==

McPherson joined the faculty of Princeton in 1962. His works include &quot;The Struggle for Equality: Abolitionists and the Negro in the Civil War and Reconstruction&quot;, awarded the Anisfield-Wolf Award in 1965. In 1988, he published his Pulitzer-winning book, &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era&quot;. His 1990 book, &quot;Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution&quot; argues that the emancipation of slaves amounts to a second American Revolution. McPherson&#x27;s 1998 book, &quot;For Cause and Comrades: Why Men Fought in the Civil War&quot;, received the Lincoln Prize. In 2002, he published both a scholarly book, &quot;Crossroads of Freedom: Antietam 1862&quot;, and a history of the American Civil War for children, &quot;Fields of Fury&quot;.

In 2007, McPherson published &quot;This Mighty Scourge: Perspectives on the Civil War&quot;, a series of essays about the American Civil War. One essay describes the huge difficulty of negotiation when regime change is a war aim on either side of a conflict. &quot;For at least the past two centuries, nations have usually found it harder to end a war than to start one. Americans learned that bitter lesson in Vietnam, and apparently having forgotten it, we&#x27;re forced to learn it all over again in Iraq.&quot; One of McPherson&#x27;s examples is the American Civil War, in which both the Union and the Confederacy sought regime change. It took four years to end the war.

Among McPherson&#x27;s other books are &quot;The Negro&#x27;s Civil War: How American Blacks Felt and Acted During the War for the Union&quot; (1965), &quot;The Abolitionist Legacy: From Reconstruction to the NAACP&quot; (1975), and &quot;Drawn with the Sword: Reflections on the American Civil War&quot; (1996).

==Honors==

McPherson was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1991. In 1995, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member David McCullough. 

McPherson was named the 2000 Jefferson Lecturer in the humanities by the National Endowment for the Humanities. In making the announcement of McPherson&#x27;s selection, NEH Chairman William R. Ferris said:

James M. McPherson has helped millions of Americans better understand the meaning and legacy of the American Civil War. By establishing the highest standards for scholarship and public education about the Civil War and by providing leadership in the movement to protect the nation&#x27;s battlefields, he has made an exceptional contribution to historical awareness in America.

In 2002, McPherson received The Lincoln Forum&#x27;s Richard Nelson Current Award of Achievement.
In 2007, he was awarded the $100,000 Pritzker Military Library Literature Award for lifetime achievement in military history and was the first recipient of the prize. In 2007, he was awarded the Samuel Eliot Morison Prize for lifetime achievement in military history given by the Society for Military History. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2009.

In 2009, he was the co-winner of the Lincoln Prize for &quot;Tried by War: Abraham Lincoln as Commander in Chief&quot;.

==Activism==

McPherson is known for his outspokenness on contemporary issues and for his activism, such as his work on behalf of the preservation of Civil War battlefields. As president in 1993–1994 of Protect Historic America, he lobbied against the construction of a Disney theme park near Manassas battlefield. He has also served on the boards of the Civil War Trust as well as the Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites, a predecessor to the Civil War Trust. From 1990 to 1993, he sat on the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission.

Along with several other historians, McPherson signed a May 2009 petition asking U.S. President Barack Obama not to lay a wreath at the Confederate Monument Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery. The petition stated:

President Obama himself never addressed the issue. Instead, he sent a wreath not only to the Confederate Memorial but also instituted a new tradition of sending a presidential wreath to the African American Civil War Memorial in Washington, D.C. He also won the praise of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.

==Personal life==
McPherson is married and has one child.

<doc id="480183" wikidata="Q1110323" url="?curid=480183" title="Myer">
<text>Myer (stylised MYER) is an Australian mid-range to upscale department store. It trades in all Australian states and one of Australia&#x27;s two self-governing territories. Myer retails a broad range of products across women&#x27;s, men&#x27;s, and children&#x27;s clothing, as well as footwear and accessories, cosmetics and fragrance, homewares, electrical, connected home, furniture, toys, books and stationery, food and confectionery, and travel goods.

Myer&#x27;s primary department store rival is David Jones.

Australian model, and Miss Universe 2004, Jennifer Hawkins was the long-serving &#x27;face of Myer&#x27; for 12 years, until her departure from the role in 2018.

==History==
===Early history===
The Myer retail group was founded by Sidney Myer, who migrated from Belarus to Melbourne in 1899 after the height of Victoria&#x27;s gold rush, with very little money and little knowledge of English to join his elder brother, Elcon Myer (1875–1938), who had left Russia two years earlier. They opened the first Myer store in Bendigo in 1900. After prospering, they opened a second store in Bendigo in 1908.

In 1911, Myer purchased the business of Wright and Neil, Drapers, in Bourke Street, Melbourne, near the General Post Office, and a new building was completed and opened in 1914. From this base, Myer built Australia&#x27;s largest chain of department stores, and the only chain with stores in all Australian states.

In 1918, the Doveton woollen mills at Ballarat were purchased, and in 1921 a new building fronting Post Office Place was added at Melbourne and in the following years Myer purchased adjoining properties, eventually building a store known as the Myer Emporium. The 1914 building had been designed by architects HW &amp; FB Tompkins, who went on to design all the extensions over the next 20 years. The Myer store expanded to Lonsdale Street in the 1920s, and the Bourke Street frontage was expanded and rebuilt in 1933.

The Myer Emporium grew with the purchase of the old established businesses of Robertson &amp; Moffat and Stephens &amp; Sons. In Adelaide, in 1925, the company Myer SA Stores Ltd acquired a controlling interest in Marshall&#x27;s department store and its shares continued to be listed on the Adelaide Stock Exchange until Myer Emporium Ltd made a successful takeover bid in 1966. A separate building in Queensberry Street, Melbourne, was put up in 1928, it was called Carlton Despatch, Myer had a large number of trucks that delivered items to the suburbs of Melbourne. People phoned the department that sold what they wanted. It was then sent to Carlton Despatch and delivered to peoples homes. They paid with a Myer Card, that put the amount on their account, that was sent to customers monthly. The Collins Street businesses of T. Webb and Sons, china importers, and W. H. Rocke and Company, house furnishers, were bought and transferred to the Bourke Street building. By 1934, the public company had a paid-up capital of nearly £2.5 million.

On the death of Sidney Myer in 1934, leadership of the company fell to briefly to Lee Neil, who died a few months later, and thence to Elcon Myer. On the death of Elcon in 1938, leadership went to their nephew Norman Myer. Norman Myer led the company until his death in 1956.

Myer grew by developing its own stores (becoming one of Australia&#x27;s major property owners and developers in the process) and acquiring other department stores, including Adelaide&#x27;s Marshall&#x27;s and Bell&#x27;s (Victor Harbor, Mount Barker, Murray Bridge and Strathalbyn and Tailem Bend) in South Australia, Western Australia&#x27;s Boans in 1984, Queensland&#x27;s Barry &amp; Roberts as well as McWhirters of Brisbane&#x27;s Fortitude Valley in 1955 and Allan &amp; Stark in 1959, in Victoria Paterson Powell Pty Ltd in 1953 (Ballarat), Bilson&#x27;s (Colac) and Shilliday&#x27;s (Mildura), and in New South Wales they acquired Western Stores, McLean&#x27;s Central Stores (Lismore), Morley&#x27;s (Tweed Heads), Farmers &amp; Co in 1961, Mortimer&#x27;s (Gosford) in 1968, P.G.Smith &amp; Regans (Tamworth) in 1953 and Grace Bros in 1983.

===Target and Grace Bros===
In 1968, Myer acquired Lindsay&#x27;s stores in Geelong, renaming the business Target, positioning it as a discount department store chain.

The core business of the company began to expand even further with the purchase of liquor retailers (San Remo and Crittendens) and fast food outlets (Red Rooster).

In 1983, Grace Bros bought Myer in New South Wales, and then in July of that year Myer acquired Grace Bros Holdings Ltd. The Myer store on Market and Pitt Streets in Sydney became the main Grace Bros store.

In 1984, Myer acquired Boans, the dominant Western Australian department store chain and embarked on a major redevelopment of its Perth City Store.

===Merger with GJ Coles===

In 1985 the Myer Emporium (and Target, its discount department store) merged with GJ Coles &amp; Coy forming Coles Myer, then Australia&#x27;s largest retailer. Myer remained a distinct entity within the new corporate structure until it was sold in 2006.

In 2000, Coles Myer CEO Dennis Eck, faced with lower sales and profits from Myer and Grace Bros stores took the department stores down market, reducing service levels, increasing stock volumes on the selling floor and introducing product to appeal to younger consumers. In doing so, he ended up replicating the approach of another of Coles Myer&#x27;s chains, Target. The resulting effect included reduced customer visits and reduced units sold per transaction. In 2001, Coles Myer set about to reposition the store to appeal to customers lost in the down market experiment.

In 2003, one of the key changes made by the recently appointed Managing Director, Dawn Robertson, was to classify each Myer Grace Bros store using a grid system referencing the socio-economic status of the area, its turnover and growth potential. Larger city-centre stores would rank at the top of the grid and smaller regional stores would rank at the bottom of the grid. The grid would affect the merchandise allocated to each store, rather than selling the same range of product in downtown Melbourne as in regional Queensland.

On 13 February 2004, Grace Bros stores were re-branded as Myer.
In April 2004, Myer re-opened its Bondi Junction, store which replaced a former Grace Bros store closed in April 2002 to make way for the redevelopment of Westfield Bondi Junction. It was the first Myer store to open in several years and incorporated new features such as white glossy floor tiles, extensive use of glass, and greater use of mannequins.

Under managing director Dawn Robertson, Myer began to target the Sydney market more strongly, to challenge the position of chief rival David Jones particularly in ladies fashion. In February 2004, Myer held its Sydney fashion parade the day before David Jones. On 9 August 2004, Myer staged a fashion parade open-air in Martin Place, gaining widespread attention, and again it was held the day before David Jones&#x27; show.

===Divestment by Coles Myer===
On 17 August 2005, Coles Myer announced that within 12 months, it would decide to demerge, divest or retain Myer. Thirteen expressions of interest were made for all or part of Myer.

On 13 March 2006, Coles Myer announced it would sell Myer to a consortium controlled by US private equity group Newbridge Capital. The consortium also included the Myer family, who held a 5% stake. The new owners, who also secured the freehold on the flagship Bourke Street store, indicated that they would not radically change the business, at least in the short term, and had no plans to redevelop the Bourke Street site as this would impact too heavily on profitability during the construction period. Texas Pacific also had interests in UK department store Debenhams and high-end US retailer Neiman Marcus. This sale was completed for A$1.4 bn on 2 June 2006.

===Private ownership===
After being divested from Coles Myer (later Coles Group, then purchased by Wesfarmers), new owners Newbridge Capital and the Myer family appointed chairman Bill Wavish and chief executive Bernie Brookes, both formerly of Woolworths. Rupert Myer joined the board representing the Myer family. Head office for Myer, moved from Coles Myer head office in Hawthorn East back to Lonsdale House (Lonsdale Street store) in Melbourne&#x27;s CBD.
Beginning July 2006, Myer held a &quot;History Making Clearance&quot; to clear out excess stock deemed either unprofitable or unpopular, and reduced inventories from $1.5 billion to $750 million, and all store-specific warehouses were closed.

Former Miss Universe Jennifer Hawkins began appearing in campaigns for Myer in 2006 and in January 2007 signed a $4 million deal to be the &quot;face&quot; of Myer for four years.

Myer withdrew from the Coles Group part-owned flybuys rewards program on 1 February 2007.

In March 2007, Myer announced first half earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of $123 million, an increase of 84% on the previous year. This represents a profit margin of 6.8%, compared with 3.9% in the previous corresponding period. According to chairman Bill Wavish, all Myer stores were now profitable, and all stores were more profitable than in the previous year. Myer acquired four Harris Scarfe stores (including regaining a store it divested to Harris Scarfe in 1998) and took a minority shareholding in Harris Scarfe.

The Mymerch system, developed with IBM and Oracle, cost $99 million and was implemented early April 2007. Among other functions, Mymerch increased Myer&#x27;s ability to carry out statistical analysis of customer habits giving it greater capacity to forecast sales trends and target promotions.

Myer&#x27;s profit turnaround was tempered in April 2007 by the loss of key staff. Bob Boutin, apparel director, Mark Bingemann, women&#x27;s wear business manager and Jasmine Bingemann, footwear and accessories manager all resigned within a short period. This followed reports of management dissatisfaction over the direction of the fashion business signified by the defection of designers such as Alex Perry and Tigerlily to David Jones.

In June 2007, a consortium comprising the Myer family, Colonial First State and GIC Real Estate (Singapore) announced it would be purchasing Myer&#x27;s Melbourne CBD store. The Bourke Street part of the store was planned to be redeveloped by 2009, with Myer taking a 60-year lease, but the development was not completed until March 2011. The Lonsdale Street part of the store closed in 2009.

=== Public company ===
In September 2009, following rumours from the previous month, Myer indicated it would float the business at an indicative share price range of $3.90 to $4.90 when it listed on 2 November, giving it a market capitalisation between $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion. The final issue price was $4.10, but by August 2011 the shares had fallen to $2.09.

In 2010, Myer&#x27;s re-developed Bourke Street mall store opened, becoming the company&#x27;s new flagship store. Head office moved to a new site in Docklands. The historic Lonsdale Street store was officially closed.

In early 2011, Myer purchased a 65% stake in Australian women&#x27;s fashion label Sass &amp; Bide for A$42.25 million. In October 2013, Myer purchased the remaining 35% of the business for $30 million.

In January 2014, it was revealed by Fairfax Media that Myer had made a bid to purchase and merge with department store rival David Jones. The merger would have kept both chains operating independently on the surface, combining back-office and supply chain operations saving both companies an estimated $5 billion per year. The $3 billion non-binding indicative proposal was made to the David Jones board of directors in late October 2013, however was rejected by the board in November 2013. In February 2014, Myer reapproached David Jones, offering to purchase David Jones at market value (estimated to be 1.7 billion). David Jones had not yet commented on the new proposal, when food and clothing retailer, Woolworths South Africa offered to purchase David Jones, by way of a scheme implementation deed, in which shareholders of David Jones would be offered $4-per-share. In response to the Woolworths deal, Myer withdrew their proposal to David Jones. Myer&#x27;s long serving CEO Bernie Brookes, whose strategy was to clean up the business and develop efficiency strategies, announced his departure in March 2015.

In September 2015, as part of an outcome from the 2015 strategic review, a $221mn capital raising was announced. The resulting dilution of shareholder value in conjunction with little support for the actions in the strategic plan saw the share price decline to $0.91.

In April 2017, Myer acquired two fashion brands—Marcs and David Lawrence—after they were placed in voluntary administration.

On 27 March 2020, Myer announced it would be temporarily closing down all of its stores from the close of business 29 March 2020 for a period of four weeks, standing down 10,000+ staff members, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Myer continued to operate their online store, with no contact delivery available and click &amp; collect at certain stores. Myer announced a plan to re-open all stores by 30 May 2020.

In late October 2024, Myer announced they had reached a deal to buy Premier Investments&#x27; Apparel Brands division (comprising the fashion brands Just Jeans, Jay Jays, Jacqui E, Portmans and Dotti). As part of the transaction, Myer will issue new shares (worth $863.78 million) to Premier Investments, while Premier will contribute $82 million to the business. Solomon Lew will join the Myer board as a non-executive director. The deal requires approval from the shareholders of both companies.

==Stores and services==

===MYER one rewards program===

The MYER one program was introduced in August 2004 after Coles Myer discontinued its shareholder discount card the previous month.

Myer revamped its MYER one program by introducing a graduated rewards system with four levels including &quot;Standard,&quot; &quot;Silver,&quot; &quot;Gold and&quot; &quot;Platinum&quot;. Each reward level is dependent on customer spend and confers exclusive benefits. The Platinum membership is by invitation only and is for Myer&#x27;s highest spending customers and was added to the program in May 2013.

In September 2010, Myer stated there were 3.7 million members and five million cards in circulation. Of these, over 20,000 had Gold status, spending over $7,500 per annum. Sales attributed to members accounted for 68% of total Myer sales. Gift cards valued at $51 million had been provided to members as rewards in the previous year. As of February 2024, the Myer One program has more than 7 million members.

===Myer store card and branded credit cards===
Myer originally had a store card managed by Australian Retail Financial Network (ARFN), sold in 1995 to GE Money. This was superseded by a Coles Myer Card and Coles Myer Gift Card which could be used at all Coles Myer stores. This was augmented by the Coles Myer Source Mastercard, also managed by GE Money. 

Following its sale, Myer relaunched the Myer card in October 2006 in conjunction with GE Money. According to GE Money, 125,000 accounts had been opened by August 2007.

In November 2007, Myer launched a Visa credit card, also in conjunction with GE Money. Myer stated it was prepared to wear losses from the card for two years and that its objective was to drive increased loyalty from the card (which links with the MYER one card) rather than being profitable in its own right. It expected to sign 100,000 customers to the Visa card by November 2008. Myer reported it had signed 15,000 customers to its Visa card in the first five weeks from launch, half of whom were converts from the existing store card.

In 2007, the Coles Myer Card, Coles Myer Gift Card and Coles Myer Source MasterCard were renamed Coles Group Card, Coles Group &amp; Myer Gift Card and Coles Group Source MasterCard respectively and as such were no longer affiliated with Myer.

In 2017, Myer&#x27;s partnership with GE Money (now Latitude Financial Services) ended, and Myer relaunched their store branded credit programme as the New Myer Credit Card, now offered by Macquarie Group. Existing card holders were invited to join the new programme, or have their existing Myer point earning cards converted to non-Myer point earning Latitude Finance cards.

=== Store locations ===
As of April 2024, Myer has 56 stores across Australia, in both capital cities and regional centres. 

The national flagship store is located in the Bourke Street Mall in Melbourne and received a $300 million redevelopment which officially opened in April 2011.

In 1988, the Myer Centre in Brisbane&#x27;s Queen Street Mall opened in time for World Expo 88. The shopping centre featured 6 floors of stores. The top two levels featured an indoor amusement park, named Tops, with a swinging ship and Australia&#x27;s first indoor roller coaster. The amusement park closed in the year 2000 and all the rides dismantled in preparation to convert the top two levels into a cinema complex.

In 1991, the Myer Centre opened in Adelaide housing the largest Myer store in South Australia and over 80 smaller shops, with an eight level atrium inside the shopping centre and six levels inside the Myer store. Until 1998, the top two levels of the atrium housed an indoor amusement park known as Dazzeland featuring Australia&#x27;s only indoor rollercoaster.

In 1994, Myer opened a store at Galleria Shopping Centre (Perth). A retailer Boans was burnt during the 1980s and was replaced with Galleria.

In 2006, Myer announced the opening of several new stores, starting with four former Harris Scarfe stores (two in South Australia and two in Victoria). Further to this, in 2008 in Sydney, Myer opened two new stores in Sydney at Westfield Eastgardens and Bankstown Central replacing the former David Jones stores, while David Jones replaced the Myer store at Westfield Burwood, and stated it would open a store in suburban Townsville centre in early 2009. This project was delayed due to problems with the acquisition of land; however, in late October 2012 a Myer store opened in that centre.

In 2007, Chairman Bill Wavish stated Myer was willing to build new stores if necessary, and that new locations could be in any city or town with a population over 40,000 people.

On 22 September 2007, Myer&#x27;s Liverpool Street, Hobart building was destroyed by a fire that is believed to have started in the cosmetic section. Building damage was estimated at $50 million, and most stock was destroyed. The building including its historic façade was subsequently demolished. The adjacent Murray Street building suffered substantial smoke and water damage. Within a day of the fire, Myer issued a statement saying it would rebuild, and the Murray Street section of the store reopened on 16 November – 44 days after the fire. A new 8797 sq m, five-level Myer store finally reopened in November 2015.

Myer opened a store in the redeveloped Top Ryde City in northern Sydney in 2010. There was (previously an A.J. Benjamin&#x27;s store) Grace Bros store at this centre from 1964 until closure in early 1985. The Myer store closed in July 2015.

In April 2008, Myer announced that it would open three new stores in Queensland. The first two stores were planned to open in 2010 at Westfield Garden City – Upper Mount Gravatt, Robina Town Centre with the third store planned to open in Mackay in 2011. Myer also announced that it would open a store at East Maitland in 2011 when the redevelopment was completed, later delayed until 2013.

In July 2008, Myer stated it planned to expand into the Middle East and open its first overseas store in Dubai, but by March 2009 had put such plans on hold.

In 2009, Myer stated it would open stores at Westfield Tuggerah on the New South Wales Central Coast, Westfield Woden in Canberra and Robina on the Gold Coast, Queensland, with plans for 12 stores in total to open progressively from 2010 to 2013. However, it subsequently pulled back on these plans.

In 2010, plans were put on the table and approved for a new subsequently-shelved 10,000sqm 2-level Myer store in Coffs Harbour, making it the first department store on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales. Had it been built, it would have been northern New South Wales’ own eco-friendly Myer department store beating short-listed favourites Tamworth (which previously had its own Grace Bros store until June 2003, prompting a strong Facebook campaign and petition to get one back in the first decade of the new millennium) and Port Macquarie as contenders to get a Myer store built and opened and operating in northern NSW. The “Vote Yes to Myer” online petition got 5,000 signatures for the proposed Coffs Harbour development.

In 2012, Myer also proposed a 12,000sqm 2 level full-line department store at Casuarina Square in Darwin, which would’ve been the first of its kind in the city and the Northern Territory. Due to open in 2016, the store was never built and Darwin remains the only state/territory capital without a Myer (or any other) department store in the country.

In January 2013, Myer closed its Kings Square, Fremantle store. Myer closed its Elizabeth, South Australia store in February 2014 and its store at Westfield Hurstville in January 2015. It opened a store at Lakeside Joondalup in November 2014.

Myer places stores into one of four clusters, which reflects the store specific shopper demographics. The cluster determines the merchandise mix, brand assortment, services offered, and capital expenditure. The sales performance expectations are also based on which cluster a store is placed. As of September 2015 the clusters (store numbers) were Flagship (7), Premium (16), Mainstream (27), and Community (17). At the time of the announcement it was stated ca. 20% of footprint rationalisation could occur.

In 2017, Myer announced it would cut 20% of its overall footprint, via a reduction in floor space of its Myer stores, office and close other Myer stores. Since the announcement, Myer has closed its stores in Wollongong Central (Replaced by David Jones), Brookside Shopping Centre (Replaced by Target and TK Maxx), and Orange, which was one of Orange&#x27;s main clothing shops for 60 years. Myer also announced the introduction of Clearance Floors, which was a format initially trialled at Myer Frankston. These floors used yellow signs with a coat hanger to show they were clearance floors, had minimal shelves and displays and were on the top floor of a Myer store. These floors would sell Myer’s unsold stock at a discounted price, essentially one space for all discounted items and a larger stock of discounted items. These floors were available at Frankston and Knox in Victoria, Loganholme and Pacific Fair in Queensland, Roselands and Penrith in New South Wales, Westfield Tea Tree Plaza in South Australia and Perth in Western Australia. These eight clearance floors ran from 2017 until 2019, intended to compete with the newly established international discount department store TK Maxx. Newly appointed CEO John King announced a plan to discontinue the model in 2019, with a stronger focus on its premium offerings.

In September 2017, Myer stated it would close three more stores, Colonnades (Replaced by Cheap as Chips, Best &amp; Less and JB Hi-Fi), Belconnen, and Hornsby.

In January 2019, Myer closed its Logan Hyperdome store in Loganholme, Queensland. This has resulted in five closures and two more planned closures in 2019.

On 13 January 2020, the Myer location at Hornsby, Sydney, closed, leaving 60 locations. The final store in the planned closures was Myer at Belconnen, although Myer has decided it shall instead spare the store and refurbish it instead. This concludes Myer’s strategy, resulting in 6 store closures and 60 Myer stores remaining, including Belconnen.

On 4 December 2020, Myer Belconnen reopened to two floors.

In March 2021, Myer announced its store at Westfield Knox, in Melbourne&#x27;s eastern suburbs would close after 44 years of operation. Myer Knox closed for the last time in late July of that year.

In April 2022, the store at Westpoint Blacktown in Sydney&#x27;s western suburbs closed after first opening in 1973.

In August 2022, Myer announced its Frankston store in bayside Melbourne would close permanently, with the last day of trading scheduled for 15 January 2023.

On 16 March 2023, Myer announced that, after being unable to reach a commercial agreement with the landlord, it would not be renewing its lease at the Brisbane Queen Street Mall location and seeking a new location in the CBD, thus ceasing 35 years of continuous operation at the site in July 2023. Griffith University emerged as a possible occupant of the site, albeit temporary, as the university required immediate expansion space whilst finding a more permanent CBD location. As of March 2023, the future of the site remains unclear, although the possibility of building demolition and site redevelopment has also been suggested.

===Mail order and online shopping===
Myer operated its own direct mail order company, Myer Direct, from 1989 until its sale to EziBuy in January 2002. In October 2007, Myer launched an online gift store, including electronic goods, perfumes, miss shop clothing and gift cards.

In 2011, Myer launched a Hong Kong based online shopping site called myfind.com (since closed) for Australian shoppers.

In December 2017, Myer launched The Myer Market, an online marketplace operating independently of myer.com.au. It offers an extended range of products, some of which are not traditionally available in Myer stores.

<doc id="480188" wikidata="Q1440157" url="?curid=480188" title="Fox sisters">
<text>The Fox sisters were three sisters from Rochester, New York who played an important role in the creation of Spiritualism: Leah (April 8, 1813 – November 1, 1890), Margaretta (also called Maggie), (October 7, 1833 – March 8, 1893) and Catherine Fox (also called Kate) (March 27, 1837 – July 2, 1892). The two younger sisters used &quot;rappings&quot; to convince their older sister and others that they were communicating with spirits. Their older sister then took charge of them and managed their careers for some time. They all enjoyed success as mediums for many years.

In 1888, Margaretta confessed that their rappings had been a hoax and publicly demonstrated their method. Despite their confession, the Spiritualism movement continued to grow in popularity.

== Early years ==
In 1848, the two younger sisters – Catherine and Margaretta – lived with their parents John and Margaret, who were Methodists, in Hydesville, New York, a former hamlet that was part of the township of Arcadia in Wayne County, New York, just outside Newark. The girls had been born and raised &quot;in or near Consecon, a tiny village in Prince Edward County, Ontario where their father owned a farm. The family moved to Hydesville, New York in 1847.

The house was reputed to be haunted, yet is reported to have been a prank. (The sisters claimed in 1888 that they made the sounds by cracking their knuckles and other joints as well as other means. By that time, 40 years later, the sisters were famous mediums.) Margaretta Fox, in her later years noted that neighbors were sure that the house was haunted, reputedly after a man who had been murdered in the house by a (falsely accused) man named Bell.

Kate and Margaretta were sent to nearby Rochester during the excitement – Kate to the house of her sister Leah (now the married Leah Fox Fish), and Margaretta to the home of her brother David – and the rappings followed them. Amy and Isaac Post, a radical Quaker couple and long-standing friends of the Fox family, invited the girls into their Rochester home. Immediately convinced of the genuineness of the phenomena, they helped to spread the word among their radical Quaker friends, who became the early core of Spiritualists. In this way appeared the association between Spiritualism and radical political causes, such as abolition, temperance, and equal rights for women.

== Emergence as mediums ==
On 14 November 1849, the Fox sisters demonstrated their spiritualist rapping at the Corinthian Hall in Rochester. This was the first demonstration of spiritualism held before a paying public and inaugurated a long history of public events featured by spiritualist mediums and leaders in the United States and in other countries.

Kate and Margaretta became famous mediums and they held séances for hundreds of people. Many of these early séances were entirely frivolous, where sitters sought insight into &quot;the state of railway stocks or the issue of love affairs.&quot;

Horace Greeley, the prominent publisher and politician, became a kind of mentor for them, enabling their movement in higher social circles. Their public séances in New York in 1850 attracted notable people, including William Cullen Bryant, George Bancroft, James Fenimore Cooper, Nathaniel Parker Willis, Horace Greeley, Sojourner Truth and William Lloyd Garrison. Although Greeley watched over the sisters, the lack of parental supervision was , as both of the young women began to drink wine.

===Criticism===

Beginning in 1850, some critics concluded that the girls made the rappings themselves, including physician E. P. Longworthy, John W. Hurn, Reverend John M. Austin, and Reverend D. Potts. In 1851, the Reverend C. Chauncey Burr wrote in the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; that by cracking toe joints the sounds were so loud, they could be heard in a large hall. In the same year, investigators from the University at Buffalo concluded that the raps were made by cracking joints of their body and that the raps would not occur if they had cushions under their feet.

In 1851, Mrs. Norman Culver, a relative of the Fox family, admitted in a signed statement that she had assisted them during their séances by touching them to indicate when the raps should be made. She also claimed that Kate and Margaretta revealed to her the method of producing the raps by snapping their toes and using their knees and ankles.

Charles Grafton Page, a patent examiner and patent advocate, had developed a keen eye for detecting fraudulent claims about science. In his book &quot;Psychomancy&quot; (1853), Page observed that the rapping sounds came from underneath the girls&#x27; long dresses. In 1857, the &quot;Boston Courier&quot; set up a prize of $500 to any medium who could demonstrate a paranormal ability to their committee. The Fox sisters made an attempt and were investigated by a committee which included the magician John Wyman. The committee concluded the raps were produced by bone and feet movements and thus the Fox sisters failed the challenge. A report by the Seybert Commission in 1887 stated that after investigating various mediums including Margaretta, the phenomena could have easily been produced by fraudulent methods. The report noted that the raps were heard close to Margaretta and a séance sitter, Professor Furness had felt pulsations in her foot.

Kate was examined by William Crookes, the prominent physicist, between 1871 and 1874, who concluded the raps were genuine. However, Crookes was described as gullible and the mediums he investigated were caught using trickery.

Harry Houdini, the magician who devoted a large part of his life to debunking Spiritualist claims, provided this insight:

=== Confession ===
In 1888, the two sisters traveled to New York City, where a reporter offered $1,500 if they would &quot;expose&quot; their methods and give him an exclusive on the story. Margaretta appeared publicly at the New York Academy of Music on October 21, 1888, with Kate present. Before an audience of 2,000, Margaret demonstrated how she could produce—at will—raps audible throughout the theater. Doctors from the audience came on stage to verify that the cracking of her toe joints was the source of the sound.

Margaretta told her story of the origins of the mysterious &quot;rappings&quot; in a signed confession given to the press and published in &quot;New York World&quot;, October 21, 1888. In it, she explained the Hydesville events.

===Later career and recantation===
Margaretta expanded on her career as a medium after leaving the homestead to begin her Spiritualist travels with her older sister, Mrs. Underhill. Margaretta used new methods of creating raps by using the muscles of her lower leg.

Pressured by the Spiritualist movement and her own dire financial circumstances, Margaretta recanted her confession in writing in November 1889, about a year after her exhibition. She had attempted to return to Spiritualist performances, but never again attracted the attention or paying clientele of the sisters&#x27; earlier careers.

In 1904, remains were found in the cellar when a false wall fell down. The &quot;Boston Journal&quot; published a story about the discovery, claiming that it was the body of the supposed peddler, on November 22, 1904. However, the police at the time didn&#x27;t open an investigation, as a physician who examined the bones found that it consisted of random bits of bones, including chicken bones, and concluded they had been placed there as a practical joke.

A few years later, a &quot;peddler tin box&quot; was claimed to have been found in the cellar along with the remains, although there is no mention of the box in earlier accounts of the finding. The remains and the tin box are now in the Lily Dale Museum. Skeptical researcher Joe Nickell concluded after researching the box that at least part of the bones were those of animals, a continuation of the hoax. There has been no confirmation that the peddler existed. The alleged false wall appears to be due to an expansion of the foundation, not the concealment of a secret grave.

==Personal lives==
Leah, on the death of her first husband, married a successful Wall Street banker. Margaretta met Elisha Kane, the Arctic explorer, in 1852. Kane was convinced that Margaretta and Kate were engaged in fraud, under the direction of their sister Leah, and he sought to break Margaretta from the group. Kane married Margaretta nonetheless, and she converted to the Roman Catholic faith. When Kane died in 1857, she returned to her activities as a medium.

Kate had traveled to England in 1871, the trip paid for by a wealthy New York banker, so she would not be compelled to accept payment for her services as a medium. The trip was apparently considered missionary work since Kate sat only for prominent persons, who would let their names be printed as witnesses to a séance. In 1872, Kate married H.D. Jencken, a London barrister, legal scholar, and enthusiastic Spiritualist. Jencken died in 1881, leaving Kate with two sons. In 1876, Margaretta joined her sister Kate, who was living in England.

Over the years, sisters Kate and Margaretta had developed serious drinking problems. Around 1888, they became embroiled in a quarrel with their sister Leah and other leading Spiritualists, who were concerned that Kate was drinking too much to care for her children. At the same time, Margaretta, contemplating a return to the Roman Catholic faith, became convinced that her powers were diabolical.

Kate died at her home, at 609 Columbus Avenue in New York City, on July 3, 1892. Less than a year later, Margaretta, deep in alcoholism, was living on charity as the sole tenant of an old tenement house at 456 West 56th Street. She was taken to the home of Spiritualist Mrs. Emily B. Ruggles, 492 State Street in Brooklyn, where she died on March 8, 1893. All three sisters are interred in Brooklyn, New York: Margaretta and Catherine in Cypress Hills Cemetery, and Leah with the Fox family in Green-Wood Cemetery.

===Parapsychology===
The Fox sisters have been widely cited in parapsychology and spiritualist literature. According to psychologists Leonard Zusne and Warren Jones, &quot;many accounts of the Fox sisters leave out their confession of fraud and present the rappings as genuine manifestations of the spirit world.&quot; C. E. M. Hansel notes in 1989 that &quot;remarkably, the Fox sisters are still discussed in the parapsychological literature without mention of their trickery.&quot;

<doc id="480190" wikidata="Q61620" url="?curid=480190" title="Cunigunde of Luxembourg">
<text>Cunigunde of Luxembourg, OSB () ( 975 – 3 March 1033), also called Cunegundes, Cunegunda, and Cunegonda and, in Latin, Cunegundis or Kinigundis, was Empress of the Holy Roman Empire by marriage to Holy Roman Emperor Henry II. She ruled as interim regent after the death of her spouse in 1024. She is a saint and the patroness of Luxembourg; her feast day is 3 March.

==Life==
Cunigunde was one of eleven children born to Siegfried I of Luxembourg (922 – 15 August 998) and a woman called Hedwig. Numerous genealogists have tried to find out which Hedwig it is; there are different views. One of the most famous theses regarding her identity is from Joseph Depoin, who claims that Hedwig is the daughter of Duke Gilbert of Lorraine and his wife Gerberga of Saxony, the daughter of Henry I. If this is correct, then Cunigunde married her distant cousin, but Henry II was strongly against consanguineous marriage, so it can be assumed that this is not the case. It can also often be read that she is the daughter of Berthold of Schweinfurt from the House of Babenberg and Eilika of Walbeck, daughter of Count Lothar. Cunigunde&#x27;s paternal grandmother, also called Cunigunde, was a Carolingian. So Cunigunde of Luxembourg was a seventh-generation descendant of Charlemagne. She married King Henry in 999. It is said that she had long wanted to be a nun, and that her marriage to Henry II was a spiritual one (also called a &quot;white marriage&quot;); that is, they married for companionship alone, and by mutual agreement did not consummate their relationship. It has been claimed that Cunigunde made a vow of virginity with Henry&#x27;s consent prior to their marriage. The truth of this is debatable; while the couple were both certainly childless, it is supposed by some authors that later hagiographers mistakenly construed the fact to imply a virginal marriage. Others, however, accept that the marriage was purely platonic.
During their marriage, her husband, Henry II, then only Duke of Bavaria, was crowned king of Germany (&quot;Rex Romanorum&quot;). The couple were crowned on 9 July 1002 in Mainz, in present-day Germany, by Willigis, Archbishop of Mainz. Cunigunde was crowned on 10 August 1002 in Paderborn, in present-day Germany, also by Willigis. It is the first known crowning of a German queen. Her predecessors were married to a king who was already crowned and therefore were not crowned alone. They directly were crowned empress in Rome. Later, her husband was also crowned as king of Italy on 15 May 1004 in Pavia, Italy, but no evidence has been given of her being crowned as queen of Italy.

It appears that Cunigunde was active politically. The title &quot;consors regni&quot; (meaning &quot;partner in the rule&quot;) for the wives of the Ottonian rulers was often used in charters. In one-third of Henry&#x27;s remaining charters, Cunigunde emerges as an advocate or initiator. As the closest adviser of her husband, she took part in Imperial councils. She is also reported to have exerted an influence on her husband in his endowments of land to the Church. These included the cathedral and monastery at Bamberg, Bavaria, in present-day Germany.

Cunigunde traveled with her husband to Rome for his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor (&quot;Romanorum Imperator&quot;) as was the tradition for the King of Germany, and was crowned as Holy Roman Empress with him on 14 February 1014 in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, Rome, receiving together with Henry the Imperial Crown from the hands of Pope Benedict VIII. During her reign she suffered from a grave illness and made a vow that if she were to regain her health, she would found a Benedictine monastery at Kassel. Upon her recovery, she kept her oath and work began on the building; however, Henry died in 1024 before it was finished. Upon his death, Cunigunde was obliged to assume the office of Regent of the Empire. This she did with her brother, and later handed over the Imperial insignia when Conrad II was elected to succeed her late husband on 8 September 1024.

==Religious life and death==

As a widow, Cunigunde was left comparatively poor, owing to the enormous wealth given away by her and Henry in charitable works.

In 1025, exactly one year after the death of her husband, Cunigunde retired to Kaufungen Abbey, in Hesse, Germany, where she entered the monastery of Benedictine nuns she had founded there. At the dedication of the monastery, she offered a relic of the True Cross, removed her regalia, and donned the habit of the nun. There she remained at the monastery, performing charitable works, caring for the sick and devoting her time to prayer. She died on 3 March 1033 at Kaufungen. She was buried at Bamberg Cathedral beside her husband, but may have been buried elsewhere first and then re-interred at the Cathedral in 1201 after her canonization.

==Canonization and veneration==
Cunigunde was canonised by Pope Innocent III on 29 March 1200, 53 years after the canonization of her husband Henry II in July 1147. To prepare a case for canonization her biography was compiled. This and the Papal bull for her canonization relate several instances of miracles to have been worked by the Empress.

One of these relates how, when calumniators accused her of scandalous conduct, her innocence was signally vindicated by divine providence as she walked over pieces of flaming irons without injury, to the great joy of her husband, the Emperor. Another tells of Cunigunde falling asleep one night and being carried into bed. Her maid also fell asleep and a candle set the bed on fire. The blaze awoke both of them and upon Cunigunde executing the Sign of the Cross, the fire immediately disappeared, saving them from burning. A final legend tells of one of Cunigunde&#x27;s nieces, Judith, the abbess of Kaufungen Abbey. A frivolous young woman, Judith preferred feasting and carousing with the young sisters to the Sabbath rituals. Cunigunde remonstrated with her, to little effect. Finally Cunigunde became so vexed with her niece that she slapped her across the face; the marks remained on her face for the rest of her life, serving as a warning to those of the community who would not take their vows or observances seriously.

Cunigunde is widely venerated. As well as churches that are dedicated to her, such as St. Cunegunda Church in Detroit, USA, Poland, and the Archdiocese of Bamberg, Germany, she is the Patroness of Luxembourg, where the parish church of Clausen (which has on Sundays and holy days a celebration of the Tridentine Mass) is dedicated to her.

Saint Cunigunde of Luxembourg is venerated in Eastern Orthodox Church on 3 March.

==Reception and iconography==

As well as in his political life, Henry II often included his wife in his imperial representation.

Her participation in the reign of her husband is underlined on the dedication picture of the Pericopes of Henry II. The couple commissioned the book in 1012 to the monks on the island Reichenau in Lake Constance, which was a leading center for book illumination at the time. With its precious cover and the 28 full-page miniatures, this is one of the most important works of book art at the time. On the dedication picture, the coronation of the couple by Jesus Christ is shown. The couple is led by the Apostles Peter and Paul. Henry is shown with an orb and scepter. The role of Cunigunde, who is represented in the same size as her husband, consists in the hand movement, pointing directly to Christ. This active hand movement can be seen as a sign of her political action readiness. In the accompanying dedicatory poem, she is referred to as co-regent (&quot;conregnans&quot;). Again, the aspect of the ruler couple moves forward, she appears as a partner in the rule of Henry II.

After her canonization, representations of her as a saint can be seen in ecclesiastical art, especially in the Franconian area. As the founder of the Dome and Diocese of Bamberg, she is to be seen together with her husband in the group of figures of the doorcase of the &quot;Adamspforte&quot; at Bamberg Cathedral. This doorcase, created in 1235, is the most significant monumental depiction of Cunigunde in the High Middle Ages. On the left are Stephen, Cunigunde and Henry, on the right opposite side, Peter, Adam and Eve can be seen. Stephen, the first Christian martyr is in the guise of a deacon. He stands next to the Empress. As a donor, she is holding the model of a church in the right hand, as in many representations. With her left hand, she is pointing to her husband, Henry II, the founder of the diocese.
Cunigunde&#x27;s usual attribute is a ploughshare. According to the legend, she walked over glowing ploughshares without being hurt. This scene is shown on the Tumba made of limestone at Bamberg Cathedral, created in the years 1499-1513 by Tilman Riemenschneider, the most important German sculptor of the time. The double tomb of the imperial couple shows the lying couple with two lions and the Bavarian-Luxembourgish double coat of arms with blue-silver diamonds and the &quot;Roude Leiw&quot; at their feet. In such tomb effigies, the lion, as a symbol of strength, is usually reserved for men. At the feet of women, there usually is a dog, as a sign of loyalty. The fact, that Cunigunde was also assigned a lion, is a reference of posterity to the duchess, queen and empress, who exercises her own sovereign rights. The &quot;Roude Leiw&quot; (meaning &quot;red lion&quot; in Luxembourgish) is also the coat of arms of Luxembourg since 1235–1239. Three of the four sides of the Tumba are decorated with scenic reliefs and architectural ornaments. Those depict events from the legends of the saints. Cunigunde is depicted as a miraculous saint in the &quot;Ploughshare test&quot; and the &quot;Key miracle&quot;.

In Luxembourg, where she is the only female saint, there is the parish Church of Saint Cunigunde in Clausen, which was consecrated in 1865 and decorated with murals depicting scenes from the life of Cunigunde in 1906. In 1959, the Cunigunde bell (&quot;Cloche St. Cunégonde&quot;) was consecrated. In addition to a wooden sculpture of the saints, a tooth relic of Cunigunde is revered in this church. There is also an octagonal Cunigunde Chapel in Heiderscheidergrund (&quot;Heischtergronn&quot;), built in 1848–1852. A statue is located there to the left of the main altar. There are two churches consecrated to her in the parish of Park Hosingen, the chapel of the village of Oberschlinder dedicated to her and the Archangel Michael in 1875, and the church of Hoscheid-Dickt in 1852, which is also the oldest church in Luxembourg dedicated to the Holy Empress.

<text>Peter of Sebaste (; c. 340 – 391) was a bishop, taking his usual name from the city of his bishopric, Sebaste in Lesser Armenia. He was the younger brother of Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, the famous Christian jurist Naucratius, and Macrina the Younger. 
He is also known as Peter of Sebasteia. Peter was not intellectually inferior to the more celebrated members of his family, but his genius &quot;seems to have been rather practical than literary&quot;.

==Life==
His parents were Basil and Emmelia of Caesarea-in-Cappadocia, who were banished for their faith in the reign of the Emperor Galerius Maximian, and fled into the deserts of Pontus. His grandmother was Macrina the Elder, who was instructed by Gregory Thaumaturgus. The youngest of ten, he was brother to Macrina the Younger and the two Cappadocian doctors, Basil of Caesarea and Gregory of Nyssa. Macrina, his eldest sister, exercised a great influence over his religious training, acting as his instructor and directing him toward the spiritual and ascetic life.

Renouncing the study of secular sciences, he devoted himself to meditation on the Bible and the cultivation of the religious life. Basil appears to have employed his brother as his confidential agent in some matters. Subsequently, he withdrew from active affairs, and resumed the life of a solitary ascetic. He assisted his sister and his mother in establishing their monastic community after his father&#x27;s death. Peter became involved in the gradual transformation of his mother&#x27;s household from a community of virgins to a cenobitic community of both women and men. For some years his brother Basil was his near neighbour on the other side of the Iris, where he had established a monastery for male ascetics, in the presidency of which Peter succeeded him when in 365 Basil was finally recalled to Caesarea by bp. Eusebius. Peter headed the male monastery while Macrina was responsible for the female community. When the provinces of Pontus and Cappadocia were visited by a severe famine, he gave a remarkable proof of his charity, liberally disposing of all that belonged to his monastery, and whatever he could raise, to supply with necessaries the numerous crowds that daily resorted to him, in that time of distress. Shortly after his brother&#x27;s elevation to the episcopal See of Caesarea in 370, Peter received from him priestly ordination. He continued to reside in his monastery till after Basil and Macrina died in 378/379.

About 380 he was elevated to the See of Sebaste in Armenia and took his stand beside his brothers Basil and Gregory in their fight against Arianism. In his life and episcopal administration he displayed the same characteristics as Basil. Linked together in the closest manner with his brothers, he followed their writings with the greatest interest. At his advice Gregory of Nyssa wrote his great work, &quot;Against Eunomius&quot;, in defense of Basil&#x27;s similarly named book answering the polemical work of Eunomius. It was also at his desire that Gregory wrote the &quot;Treatise on the Work of the Six Days&quot;, to defend Basil&#x27;s similar treatise against false interpretations and to complete it. Another work of Gregory&#x27;s, &quot;On the Endowment of Man&quot;, was also written at Peter&#x27;s suggestion and sent to the latter with an appropriate preface as an Easter gift in 397. 

No detailed information is available concerning his activity as a bishop, except that he was present at the Ecumenical Council of Constantinople in 381. Olympias, the deaconess and friend of Chrysostom, entrusted large funds to him for distribution to the poor. After his death in 391 he was venerated as a saint. His feast was historically kept by Roman Catholics on 9 January, but he is now listed under 26 March in the second edition of the Roman Martyrology (2004).

<text>An alembic (from , originating from , &#x27;cup, beaker&#x27;) is an alchemical still consisting of two vessels connected by a tube, used for distillation of liquids.

== Description ==
The complete distilling apparatus consists of three parts: 

* the &quot;&quot; (Arabic: ; Greek: , ), the still pot containing the liquid to be distilled, which is heated by a flame
* the &quot;head&quot; or &quot;cap&quot; (, ; Greek , ) which fits over the mouth of the cucurbit to receive the vapors, with an attached downward-sloping &quot;tube&quot; (, )
* the &quot;receiver&quot; (, ; , or , ) container

In the case of another distilling vessel, the retort, the &quot;cap&quot; and the &quot;cucurbit&quot; have been combined to form a single vessel. The anbik
is also called the &quot;raʾs&quot; (the Arabic word &quot;raʾs&quot; means &quot;head&quot;) of the cucurbit. The liquid in the cucurbit is heated or boiled; the vapour rises into the &quot;anbik&quot;, where it cools by contact with the walls and condenses, running down the spout into the receiver. A modern descendant of the alembic is the pot still, used to produce distilled beverages.

== History ==
Dioscorides&#x27;s ambix, described in his (c. 50 C.E.), is a helmet-shaped lid for gathering condensed mercury. For Athenaeus (c. 225 C.E.) it is a bottle or flask. For later chemists it denoted various parts of crude distillation devices.

Alembic drawings appear in works of Cleopatra the Alchemist (3rd century C.E.), Zosimos of Panopolis (c. 300 C.E.), and Synesius (c. 373 – c. 414 C.E.). There were alembics with two (dibikos) and three (tribikos) receivers. According to Zosimos of Panopolis, the alembic was invented by Mary the Jewess.

The anbik is described by Ibn al-Awwam in his (&quot;Book of Agriculture&quot;), where he explains how rose-water is distilled. Amongst others, it is mentioned in the (&quot;Key of Sciences&quot;) of Khwarizmi and the (&quot;Book of Secrets&quot;) of al-Razi. Some illustrations occur in the Latin translations of works which are attributed to Geber.
== Unicode ==
The Unicode character set specifies three symbols for alembics: the pictogram ⚗ (), its emoji variation ⚗️ (), and the ancient alchemical symbol 🝪 ().

<text>67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko (abbreviated as 67P or 67P/C–G) is a Jupiter-family comet. It is originally from the Kuiper belt and has an orbital period of 6.45 years as of 2012, a rotation period of approximately 12.4 hours, and a maximum velocity of . Churyumov–Gerasimenko is approximately at its longest and widest dimensions. It was first observed on photographic plates in 1969 by Soviet astronomers Klim Ivanovych Churyumov and Svetlana Ivanovna Gerasimenko, after whom it is named. It most recently came to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) on 2 November 2021, and will next come to perihelion on 9 April 2028.

Churyumov–Gerasimenko was the destination of the European Space Agency&#x27;s &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission, launched on 2 March 2004. &quot;Rosetta&quot; rendezvoused with Churyumov–Gerasimenko on 6 August 2014 and entered orbit on 10 September 2014. &quot;Rosetta&quot; lander, &quot;Philae&quot;, landed on the comet&#x27;s surface on 12 November 2014, becoming the first spacecraft to land on a comet nucleus. On 30 September 2016, the &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft ended its mission by landing on the comet in its Ma&#x27;at region.

== Discovery ==
Churyumov–Gerasimenko was discovered in 1969 by Klim Ivanovich Churyumov of Kyiv University&#x27;s Astronomical Observatory, who examined a photograph that had been exposed for comet Comas Solà by Svetlana Ivanovna Gerasimenko on 11 September 1969 at the Alma-Ata Astrophysical Institute, near Alma-Ata, the then-capital city of Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, Soviet Union. Churyumov found a cometary object near the edge of the plate, but assumed that this was comet Comas Solà.

After returning to his home institute in Kyiv, Churyumov examined all the photographic plates more closely. On 22 October, about a month after the photograph was taken, he discovered that the object could not be Comas Solà, because it was about 1.8 degrees off the expected position. Further scrutiny produced a faint image of Comas Solà at its expected position on the plate, thus proving the other object to be a different body.

== Shape ==

The comet consists of two lobes connected by a narrower neck, with the larger lobe measuring about and the smaller one about . With each orbit the comet loses matter, as gas and dust are evaporated away by the Sun. It is estimated that a layer with an average thickness of about is lost per orbit as of 2015. The comet has a mass of approximately 10 billion tonnes.

The two-lobe shape of the comet is the result of a gentle, low-velocity collision of two objects, and is called a contact binary. The &quot;terraces&quot;, layers of the interior of the comet that have been exposed by partial stripping of outer layers during its existence, are oriented in different directions in the two lobes, indicating that two objects fused to form Churyumov–Gerasimenko.

== Surface ==


There are 26 distinct regions on Churyumov–Gerasimenko, with each named after an Egyptian deity; regions on the large lobe are named after gods, whereas those on the small lobe are named after goddesses. 19 regions were defined in the northern hemisphere prior to equinox. Later, when the southern hemisphere became illuminated, seven more regions were identified using the same naming convention.

=== Gates ===
Features described as &quot;gates&quot;, twin prominences on the surface so named for their appearance, were named after deceased members of the &quot;Rosetta&quot; team.
=== Surface changes ===
During &quot;Rosetta&quot; lifetime, many changes were observed on the comet&#x27;s surface, particularly when the comet was close to perihelion. These changes included evolving patterns of circular shapes in smooth terrains that at some point grew in size by a few metres per day. A fracture in the neck region was also observed to grow in size; boulders tens of metres wide were displaced, sometimes travelling more than 100 metres; and patches of the ground were removed to expose new features. A number of collapsing cliffs have also been observed. One notable example in December 2015 was captured by &quot;Rosetta&quot; NAVCAM as a bright patch of light shining from the comet. &quot;Rosetta&quot; scientists determined that a large cliff had collapsed, making it the first landslide on a comet known to be associated with an outburst of activity. An apparent outburst of the comet was observed on 14 November 2021. According to the researchers, &quot;At the time of the outburst discovery with ZTF, the comet was 1.23 au from the Sun and 0.42 au from the Earth. The comet&#x27;s last perihelion passage was on 2021 Nov 2.&quot;.

=== Cheops boulder ===
Cheops is the largest boulder on the surface of the comet, measuring up to 45 meters. It is located in the comet&#x27;s larger lobe. It was named for the pyramid in Giza because its shape is similar to that of a pyramid.

== Orbit and rotation ==


Like the other comets of the Jupiter family, Churyumov–Gerasimenko probably originated in the Kuiper belt and was ejected towards the interior of the Solar System, where later encounters with Jupiter successively changed its orbit. These interactions will continue until the comet is eventually thrown out of the Solar System or collides with the Sun or a planet.

On 4 February 1959, a close encounter with Jupiter of moved Churyumov–Gerasimenko&#x27;s perihelion inward from to , where it basically remains today. In November 2220 the comet will pass about from Jupiter which will move perihelion inwards to about from the Sun.

Before Churyumov–Gerasimenko&#x27;s perihelion passage in 2009, its rotational period was 12.76 hours. During this perihelion passage, it decreased to 12.4 hours, which likely happened because of sublimation-induced torque.

=== 2015 perihelion ===
, Churyumov–Gerasimenko&#x27;s nucleus had an apparent magnitude of roughly 20. It came to perihelion on 13 August 2015. From December 2014 until September 2015, it had an elongation less than 45 degrees from the Sun. On 10 February 2015, it went through solar conjunction when it was 5 degrees from the Sun and was from Earth. It crossed the celestial equator on 5 May 2015 and became easiest to see from the Northern Hemisphere. Even right after perihelion when it was in the constellation of Gemini, it only brightened to about apparent magnitude 12, and required a telescope to be seen. , the comet had a total magnitude of about 20.
=== 2021 perihelion ===

The 2021 apparition marked the closest approach to Earth since 1982. The comet reached perihelion on 2 November 2021 and the closest approach to Earth was on November 12, 2021, at 00:50 UTC, at a distance of 38 million miles (61 million km). The comet brightened to an apparent magnitude of 9, meaning it was visible with amateur telescopes. Two outbursts were observed during the apparition, on 2021 October 29.940 and November 17.864 UTC, −3.12 days and +15.81 days respectively from the perihelion date. During the first outburst the comet brightened by 0.26 ± 0.03 mag in the outburst, with a 27% increase in the effective geometric cross-section and total outburst dust mass of . The second outburst caused a brightening of 0.49 ± 0.08 mag with effective geometric cross-section and total outburst dust mass 2.5 times larger than the first event.

== Exploration ==
=== &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission ===
The &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission was the first mission to include an orbiter that accompanied a comet for several years, as well as a lander that collected close-up data from the comet&#x27;s surface. The mission launched in 2004, arrived at comet 67P in 2014, and concluded with a touchdown on the comet&#x27;s surface in 2016.

==== Advance work ====

As preparation for the &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission, Hubble Space Telescope pictures taken on 12 March 2003 were closely analysed. An overall 3D model was constructed and computer-generated images were created.

On 25 April 2012, the most detailed observations until that time were taken with the 2-metre Faulkes Telescope by N. Howes, G. Sostero and E. Guido while it was at its aphelion.

On 6 June 2014, water vapor was detected being released at a rate of roughly when &quot;Rosetta&quot; was from Churyumov–Gerasimenko and from the Sun. On 14 July 2014, images taken by &quot;Rosetta&quot; showed that its nucleus is irregular in shape with two distinct lobes. The size of the nucleus was estimated to be . Two explanations for its shape were proposed at the time: that it was a contact binary, or that its shape may have resulted from asymmetric erosion due to ice sublimating from its surface to leave behind its lobed shape. By September 2015, mission scientists had determined that the contact binary hypothesis was unambiguously correct.

==== Rendezvous and orbit ====

Beginning in May 2014, &quot;Rosetta&quot; velocity was reduced by with a series of thruster firings. Ground controllers rendezvoused &quot;Rosetta&quot; with Churyumov–Gerasimenko on 6 August 2014. This was done by reducing &quot;Rosetta&quot; relative velocity to . &quot;Rosetta&quot; entered orbit on 10 September, at about from the nucleus.

==== Landing ====

Descent of a small lander occurred on 12 November 2014. &quot;Philae&quot; is a robotic probe that set down on the surface with landing gear. The landing site has been christened &quot;Agilkia&quot; in honor of Agilkia Island, where the temples of Philae Island were relocated after the construction of the Aswan Dam flooded the island. The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of Churyumov–Gerasimenko has been estimated for simulation purposes at 10−3 m/s, or about 1/10000 of that on Earth.

Because of its low relative mass, landing on the comet relied on tools to anchor &quot;Philae&quot; to the surface. The probe had an array of mechanisms designed to manage Churyumov–Gerasimenko&#x27;s low gravity, including a cold gas thruster, harpoons, landing-leg-mounted ice screws, and a flywheel to keep it oriented during its descent. During the event, the thruster and the harpoons failed to operate, and the ice screws did not gain a grip. The lander bounced twice and only came to rest when it made contact with the surface for the third time, two hours after first contact.

Contact with &quot;Philae&quot; was lost on 15 November 2014 because of dropping battery power. The European Space Operations Centre briefly reestablished communications on 14 June 2015 and reported a healthy spacecraft but communications were lost again soon after. On 2 September 2016, &quot;Philae&quot; was located in photographs taken by the &quot;Rosetta&quot; orbiter. It had come to rest in a crack with only its body and two legs visible. While the discovery solves the question of the lander&#x27;s disposition, it also allows project scientists to properly contextualise the data it returned from the comet&#x27;s surface.

==== Physical properties ====

The composition of water vapor from Churyumov–Gerasimenko, as determined by the &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft, is substantially different from that found on Earth. The ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in the water from the comet was determined to be three times that found for terrestrial water. This makes it unlikely that water found on Earth came from comets like Churyumov–Gerasimenko. The water vapor is also mixed with significant amount of formaldehyde (0.5 wt%) and methanol (0.4 wt%), these concentrations falling within common range for Solar system comets. On 22 January 2015, NASA reported that, between June and August 2014, the comet released increasing amounts of water vapor, up to tenfold as much. On 23 January 2015, the journal &quot;Science&quot; published a special issue of scientific studies related to the comet.

Measurements carried out before &quot;Philae&quot; batteries failed indicate that the dust layer could be as much as thick. Beneath that is hard ice, or a mixture of ice and dust. Porosity appears to increase toward the center of the comet.

The nucleus of Churyumov–Gerasimenko was found to have no magnetic field of its own after measurements were taken during &quot;Philae&quot; descent and landing by its ROMAP instrument and &quot;Rosetta&quot; RPC-MAG instrument. This suggests that magnetism may not have played a role in the early formation of the Solar System, as had previously been hypothesized.

The ALICE spectrograph on &quot;Rosetta&quot; determined that electrons (within above the comet nucleus) produced from photoionization of water molecules by solar radiation, and not photons from the Sun as thought earlier, are responsible for the degradation of water and carbon dioxide molecules released from the comet nucleus into its coma. Also, active pits, related to sinkhole collapses and possibly associated with outbursts are present on the comet.

Measurements by the COSAC and Ptolemy instruments on the &quot;Philae&quot; lander revealed sixteen organic compounds, four of which were seen for the first time on a comet, including acetamide, acetone, methyl isocyanate and propionaldehyde. Astrobiologists Chandra Wickramasinghe and Max Wallis stated that some of the physical features detected on the comet&#x27;s surface by &quot;Rosetta&quot; and &quot;Philae&quot;, such as its organic-rich crust, could be explained by the presence of extraterrestrial microorganisms. &quot;Rosetta&quot; program scientists dismissed the claim as &quot;pure speculation&quot;. Carbon-rich compounds are common in the Solar System. Neither &quot;Rosetta&quot; nor &quot;Philae&quot; is equipped to search for direct evidence of organisms. The only amino acid detected thus far on the comet is glycine, along with precursor molecules methylamine and ethylamine.

Solid organic compounds were also found in the dust particles emitted by the comet; the carbon in this organic material is bound in &quot;very large macromolecular compounds&quot;, analogous to the insoluble organic matter in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Scientists think that the observed cometary carbonaceous solid matter could have the same origin as the meteoritic insoluble organic matter, but suffered less modification before or after being incorporated into the comet.

One of the most outstanding discoveries of the mission was the detection of large amounts of free molecular oxygen () gas surrounding the comet. Solar system models suggest the molecular oxygen should have disappeared by the time 67P was created, about 4.6 billion years ago in a violent and hot process that would have caused the oxygen to react with hydrogen and form water. Molecular oxygen has never before been detected in cometary comas. &quot;In situ&quot; measurements indicate that the / ratio is isotropic in the coma and does not change systematically with heliocentric distance, suggesting that primordial was incorporated into the nucleus during the comet&#x27;s formation. This interpretation was challenged by the discovery that may be produced on the surface of the comet in water molecule collisions with silicates and other oxygen-containing materials. Detection of molecular nitrogen () in the comet suggests that its cometary grains formed in low-temperature conditions below .

On 3 July 2018, researchers hypothesized that molecular oxygen might not be made on the surface of comet 67P in sufficient quantity, thus deepening the mystery of its origin.

=== Future missions ===
CAESAR was a proposed sample-return mission aimed at returning to 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, capturing regolith from the surface, and returning it to Earth. This mission was competing in NASA&#x27;s New Frontiers mission 4 selection process, and was one of two finalists in the program. In June 2019, it was passed over in favor of &quot;Dragonfly&quot;.

<text>Catherine Booth (&quot;née&quot; Mumford, 17 January 1829 – 4 October 1890) was co-founder of The Salvation Army, along with her husband William Booth. Because of her influence in the formation of The Salvation Army she was known as the &#x27;Mother of The Salvation Army&#x27;.

==Life==
She was born as Catherine Mumford in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, England, in 1829 to Methodist parents, John Mumford and Sarah Milward. Her father was an occasional lay preacher and carriage maker. Her family later moved to Boston, Lincolnshire, and later lived in Brixton, London. From an early age, Catherine was a serious and sensitive girl. She had a strong Christian upbringing and was said to have read the Bible through eight times before the age of 12.

During Catherine&#x27;s adolescence a spinal curvature led to years of enforced idleness. She kept herself busy, however, and was especially concerned about the problems of alcoholism. Even as a young girl she had served as secretary of a Juvenile Temperance Society writing articles for a temperance magazine. Catherine was a member of the local Band of Hope and a supporter of the national Temperance Society.

When Catherine refused to condemn Methodist Reformers in 1850, the Wesleyan Methodists expelled her. For the Reformers she led a girls&#x27; Sunday school class in Clapham. At the home of Edward Rabbits, in 1851, she met William Booth, who also had been expelled by the Wesleyans for reform sympathies. William was reciting a temperance poem, &quot;The Grog-seller’s Dream&quot;, which appealed to Catherine, who had embraced the new Methodist passion for abstinence.

They soon fell in love and became engaged. During their three-year engagement, Catherine constantly wrote letters of encouragement to William as he performed the tiring work of a preacher. They were married on 16 June 1855 at  Stockwell  Green Congregational Church in London. Their wedding was very simple, as they wanted to use their time and money for his ministry. Even on their honeymoon, William was asked to speak at meetings.

The Booths had eight children: Bramwell Booth,  Ballington Booth, Kate Booth, Emma Booth, Herbert Booth, Marie Booth, Evangeline Booth and Lucy Booth, and were dedicated to giving them a firm Christian knowledge. Two of their offspring, Bramwell and Evangeline, later became Generals of The Salvation Army.

==Ministry==

Catherine began to be more active in the work of the church at Brighouse. Though she was extremely nervous, she enjoyed working with young people and found the courage to speak in children&#x27;s meetings. During this period she discovered a model, American Wesleyan revivalist Phoebe Palmer. With William&#x27;s encouragement, Catherine wrote a pamphlet, &quot;Female Ministry: Woman’s Right to Preach the Gospel&quot; (1859), in defense of American preacher Mrs. Phoebe Palmer&#x27;s preaching, whose preaching had caused a great stir in the area where the Booths lived. &quot;Female Ministry&quot; was a short, powerful apology for women&#x27;s rights to preach the gospel. The pamphlet identifies three major principles on which her convictions rested. First, Catherine saw that women are neither naturally nor morally inferior to men. Second, she believed there was no scriptural reason to deny them a public ministry. Third, she maintained that what the Bible urged, the Holy Spirit had ordained and blessed and so must be justified. She complained that the &quot;unjustifiable application&quot; of Paul&#x27;s advice, “ &#x27;Let your women keep silence in the Churches&#x27; (1 Corinthians 14:34), has resulted in more loss to the Church, evil to the world, and dishonor to God, than any of [its] errors&quot;.

At that time, it was unheard of for women to speak in adult meetings. She was convinced that women had an equal right to speak. In January 1860, following the birth of their fourth child, at Gateshead, during William&#x27;s sermon, she asked to &quot;say a word&quot;. She witnessed to her timidity about claiming her calling, yet William announced that she would speak that night. It was the beginning of a tremendous ministry, as people were greatly challenged by her preaching.

She became a partner in her husband&#x27;s work and soon found her own sphere as a powerful preacher. She also spoke to people in their homes, especially to alcoholics, whom she helped to make a new start in life. Often she held cottage meetings for converts. She eventually began to hold her own campaigns. Many agree that no man of her era, including her husband, exceeded her in popularity or spiritual results. Her first written article, the pamphlet &quot;Female Teaching&quot; was published in December 1859.

Catherine Booth was eloquent and compelling in speech, articulate and devastatingly logical in writing, she had for over twenty years defended the right of women to preach the gospel on the same terms as men. At first, Catherine and her husband had shared a ministry as traveling evangelists, but then she came into great demand as a preacher in her own right, especially among the well-to-do. A woman preacher was a rare phenomenon in a world where women had few civil rights, and no place in the professions. Catherine Booth was both a woman and a fine preacher, a magnetic combination that attracted large numbers to hear her and made its own statement about the validity of women&#x27;s ministry.

Amongst other activities, Catherine lobbied Queen Victoria to seek legislation for safeguarding females, in the form of the &quot;Parliamentary Bill for the protection of girls&quot;

==The Christian Mission==
They began the work of The Christian Mission in 1865 in London&#x27;s East End. William preached to the poor and ragged and Catherine spoke to the wealthy, gaining support for their financially demanding ministry. The textile industry employed as many women as men and contributed a substantial number of female officers. In addition, domestic indoor servants flocked to the Army, and many became officers. William and Catherine and their son Bramwell and daughter-in-law Florence were all vegetarian. Bramwell wrote a list of reasons he had maintained the diet.

The &quot;Appointments of Officers, 1883&quot; lists 127 married men. This number is important, because wives were expected to help run the corps. Since wives were not compelled to attend the officers&#x27; course at the Training Home, they were not given a commission and, therefore, did not appear in the list. General Booth had an active policy of encouraging officers to intermarry. The &quot;Appointments of Officers, 1883&quot; lists thirty-six couples who had done so, the women resigning their own rights of officership to become joint officers with their husbands. The loss of the women officers&#x27; rights when marrying contradicts the constant statement regarding equality. The Army leaders were clearly not so radical as to lose the concept of man&#x27;s conjugal superiority. This social policy carried into pay; the husband, as head of the household, received the pay for the couple. The idea that single female officers could manage on less money than their male counterparts was abolished before the Second World War. Until that time, male officers received a third more pay than their female counterparts. 

Catherine Booth organized Food for the Million shops where the poor could buy a cheap meal and at Christmas, hundreds of meals were distributed to the needy.

When the name was changed in 1878 to The Salvation Army and William Booth became known as the General, Catherine became known as the &#x27;Mother of The Salvation Army.&#x27; She was behind many of the changes in the new organization, designing the flag and bonnets for the ladies, and contributed to the Army&#x27;s ideas on many important issues and matters of belief.

The Booths rented a small villa, Crossley House, in Clacton-on-Sea, which had a sea view that she loved.

Catherine Booth died of breast cancer at age 61 at Crossley House. She is interred with her husband in Abney Park Cemetery, London.

Subsequently, Crossley House was donated to people with learning disabilities and provided many summer holidays until it was sold to property developers in 2005.

<doc id="480207" wikidata="Q1354905" url="?curid=480207" title="James B. McPherson">
<text>James Birdseye McPherson (/məkˈfərsən/) (November 14, 1828 – July 22, 1864) was a career United States Army officer who served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. McPherson was on the general staff of Henry Halleck and later of Ulysses S. Grant and was with Grant at the Battle of Shiloh. He was killed at the Battle of Atlanta, facing the army of his old West Point classmate John Bell Hood, who paid a warm tribute to his character. He was the second-highest-ranking Union officer killed in action during the war.

==Early life and career==
McPherson was born in Clyde, Ohio. He attended Norwalk Academy in Norwalk, Ohio, and graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1853, first in his class, which included Philip H. Sheridan, John M. Schofield, and John Bell Hood; Hood would oppose him later in the Western Theater. McPherson was directly appointed to the Corps of Engineers with the rank of brevet second lieutenant. For a year after his graduation, he was assistant instructor of practical engineering at the Military Academy, a position never before given to so young an officer.

From 1854 to 1857, McPherson was the assistant engineer upon the defenses of the harbor of New York and the improvement of the Hudson River. In 1857 he superintended the building of Fort Delaware, and in 1857–61 was superintending engineer of the construction of the defenses of Alcatraz Island, at San Francisco, California. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1858.

In 1859, while in San Francisco, he met Emily Hoffman, a woman from a prominent merchant family in Baltimore who had come to California to help care for her sister&#x27;s children. They soon became engaged and a wedding was planned, but ultimately put off by the onset of the Civil War.

==Civil War==

At the start of the American Civil War, McPherson requested a transfer from California back east. He departed the state on August 1, 1861, and arrived soon after in New York. He requested a position on the staff of Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, one of the senior Western commanders. Promoted to captain on August 6, he was sent to St. Louis, Missouri, serving under Halleck. Halleck appointed him to command of the Department of the West in November, where he was chosen aide-de-camp to Halleck while also being promoted to lieutenant colonel.

McPherson&#x27;s career began rising after this assignment. He was a lieutenant colonel and the Chief Engineer in Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s army during the capture of forts Henry and Donelson in February 1862.

During the days that led up to the Battle of Shiloh, McPherson accompanied Sherman questioning people in the area and learned that the Confederates were bringing large numbers of troops from every direction by train to Corinth, Mississippi, which was itself an important railroad junction.

He was promoted to brigadier general on May 15 and served as military superintendent of the railroads in western Tennessee. On October 8 he was promoted to major general and was soon after given command of the XVII Corps in Grant&#x27;s Army of the Tennessee.

In September 1862, McPherson assumed a position on the staff of General Grant. He briefly commanded an infantry brigade before being promoted to major general, rising to that position primarily due to the influence of Halleck and Grant. Immediately after the siege of Vicksburg in which McPherson commanded the center, on Grant&#x27;s recommendation McPherson was confirmed a brigadier general in the regular army, dating from August 1, 1863. Soon after this promotion, McPherson led a column of infantry into Mississippi and repulsed the enemy at Canton.

On March 12, 1864, he was given command of the Army of the Tennessee, after its former commander, Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, was promoted to command of all armies in the West. He then requested leave to go home and marry his fiancé Emily Hoffman in Baltimore, Maryland. His leave was initially granted, but quickly revoked by Sherman, who explained McPherson was needed for his upcoming Atlanta Campaign. McPherson&#x27;s army was the right wing of Sherman&#x27;s army, alongside the Army of the Cumberland and the Army of the Ohio.
Sherman planned to have the bulk of his forces feint toward Dalton, Georgia, while McPherson would bear the brunt of Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s attack, and attempt to trap them. However, the Confederate forces eventually escaped, and Sherman blamed McPherson (for being &quot;slow&quot;), although it was mainly faulty planning on Sherman&#x27;s part that led to the escape. McPherson&#x27;s troops followed the Confederates &quot;vigorously&quot;, and were resupplied at Kingston, Georgia. The troops drew near Pumpkinvine Creek, where they attacked and drove the Confederates from Dallas, Georgia, even before Sherman&#x27;s order to do so. Johnston and Sherman maneuvered against each other, until the Union tactical defeat at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. McPherson then tried a flanking maneuver at the Battle of Marietta, but that failed as well.

Confederate President Jefferson Davis became frustrated with Johnston&#x27;s strategy of maneuver and retreat, and on July 17 replaced him with Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood. With the Union armies closing in on Atlanta, Hood first attacked George Henry Thomas&#x27;s Army of the Cumberland north of the city on July 20, at Peachtree Creek, hoping to drive Thomas back before other forces could come to his aid. The attack failed. Then Hood&#x27;s cavalry reported that the left flank of McPherson&#x27;s Army of the Tennessee, east of Atlanta, was unprotected. Hood visualized a glorious replay of Jackson&#x27;s famous flank attack at Chancellorsville and ordered a new attack. McPherson had advanced his troops into Decatur, Georgia, and from there, they moved onto high ground on Bald Hill overlooking Atlanta. Sherman believed that the Confederates had been defeated and were evacuating; however, McPherson rightly believed that they were moving to attack the Union left and rear. On July 22, while they were discussing this new development, however, four Confederate divisions under Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee flanked Union Maj. Gen. Grenville Dodge&#x27;s XVI Corps. While McPherson was riding his horse toward his old XVII Corps, a line of Confederate skirmishers appeared, yelling &quot;Halt!&quot;. McPherson raised his hand to his head as if to remove his hat, but suddenly wheeled his horse, attempting to escape. The Confederates opened fire and mortally wounded McPherson in the back. When the Confederate troops approached and asked his orderly who the downed officer was, the aide replied &quot;Sir, it is General McPherson. You have killed the best man in our army.&quot; This was early in the one-day Battle of Atlanta, part of the Atlanta Campaign that led to the surrender of Atlanta a month later. General Otis Howard succeeded him as commander of the Army and Department of the Tennessee.

== Aftermath and tributes ==

McPherson was the second-highest-ranking Union officer to be killed in action during the war (the highest ranking was John Sedgwick).

When Sherman received word of McPherson&#x27;s death, he openly wept. He then penned a letter to Emily Hoffman in Baltimore, stating:

Hoffman never recovered from his death, living a quiet and lonely life until her death in 1891.

Sherman declared in his official report:

His public enemies, even the men who directed the fatal shot, never spoke or wrote of him without expressions of marked respect; those whom he commanded loved him even to idolatry; and I, his associate and commander, fail in words adequate to express my opinion of his great worth. I feel assured that every patriot in America, on hearing this sad news, will feel a sense of personal loss, and the country generally will realize that we have lost, not only an able military leader, but a man who, had he survived, was qualified to heal the national strife which has been raised by designing and ambitious men.

McPherson&#x27;s adversary, John Bell Hood, wrote,

==Legacy==

Fort McPherson in Atlanta, Georgia, area was named in Gen. McPherson&#x27;s honor on February 20, 1866.

McPherson Square in Washington, D.C., and its Metro rail station are named in the general&#x27;s honor. At the center of the square is a statue of McPherson on horseback.

McPherson County, Kansas, and the town of McPherson, Kansas, are named in his honor. McPherson Township, Blue Earth County, Minnesota is also named for him. There is also an equestrian statue of him in the park across from the McPherson County Courthouse.

McPherson County, South Dakota, founded in 1873, and organized in 1885, was also named in his honor.

McPherson County, Nebraska, and Fort McPherson National Cemetery, located near Maxwell, Nebraska, were named in his honor, and the National Cemetery was established on March 3, 1873. This cemetery is located two miles (3 km) south of Interstate 80, near Exit 190.

A monument marking the death of McPherson was established at the location of his death in East Atlanta, at the intersection of McPherson Avenue and Monument Avenue. McPherson Avenue in Atlanta was named for him. The spot is marked by a Union cannon once placed at Glenwood Road and Flat Shoals Road to protect the flank of the front line and return fire against the defensive positions built by Lemuel P. Grant.

A distinctive engraved portrait of McPherson appeared on U.S. paper money in 1890 and 1891. The bills are called &quot;treasury notes&quot; or &quot;coin notes&quot; and are widely collected today because of their fine, detailed engraving. The $2 McPherson &quot;fancyback&quot; note of 1890, with an estimated 600–900 in existence relative to the 4.9 million printed, ranks as number 15 in the &quot;100 Greatest American Currency Notes&quot; compiled by Bowers and Sundman (2006).

The James B. McPherson Elementary School in the Ravenswood area of Chicago, Illinois, was named for McPherson.

In his home town of Clyde, Ohio, James B. McPherson Highway (US 20) was dedicated and named in his honor on August 9, 1941; the designation was extended across the state in 1973. The McPherson Middle School and McPherson Cemetery are named for him as well. The cemetery was named Evergreen Cemetery, but was renamed McPherson Cemetery on December 15, 1868. There is also a monument that was erected in his honor on July 22, 1881, at the McPherson Cemetery. President Rutherford B. Hayes gave the dedication speech during the ceremony for the monument. There were many US Civil War officers in attendance for the dedication of the monument, including General William Tecumseh Sherman. His childhood home on E. Maple Street in Clyde, Ohio is now owned by the Clyde Heritage League and is a museum that can be toured.

==In popular media==

The alternate history novel &quot;Never Call Retreat: Lee and Grant: The Final Victory&quot;, by Newt Gingrich, and William R. Forstchen, includes McPherson as a major character.

In another alternate history, &quot;If the South Had Won the Civil War&quot; by MacKinlay Kantor – in which the war ended in 1863 with a decisive Confederate victory – McPherson survived to become President of the United States for two terms in the 1880s and strongly pursue a line of reconciliation with the Confederate States.

McPherson and his hat also feature prominently in the book &quot;Map of Thieves&quot;, by Michael Karpovage.

McPherson has been mentioned several times on the &quot;Drunken Peasants&quot; podcast by host TJ Kirk who has stated he is a relative of McPherson&#x27;s. Unless he is a very distant relative then he is not related to McPherson. One of McPherson&#x27;s brothers died without issue, the other had one son, who then died without issue. McPherson&#x27;s sister Emeline had 3 children, with only her oldest daughter, Emma McPherson VanderCook, having living decedents today; none of whom are TJ Kirk. In 2023 Kirk stated that it was possible that the claims of his ancestry to McPherson were just &quot;family bullshit.&quot;

The 1939 film &quot;Union Pacific&quot; depicts a (fictional) steam locomotive named after McPherson.
