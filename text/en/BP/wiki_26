<text>The Penrith Panthers are an Australian professional rugby league football club based in the Greater Western Sydney suburb of Penrith that competes in the National Rugby League (NRL). The team is based west of the centre of Sydney, at the foot of the Blue Mountains. Penrith are the current reigning NRL Premiers, having won the title six times, including the last four times consecutively.

Penrith were admitted to the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition in 1967. Penrith struggled for almost twenty years before finally reaching their first finals series. The club achieved its first grand final appearance in 1990 but were beaten by the Canberra Raiders 18–14. The following year, Penrith met Canberra again in the 1991 Grand Final, this time winning the game 19–12.

Penrith won their second NRL premiership in 2003. Their most recent premiership achievement came in 2024, where they defeated the Melbourne Storm by 14–6 in the Grand Final. After losing the 2020 grand final to the Melbourne Storm, Penrith became the second club to retain the premiership in the NRL-era as well as the first to win three and subsequently four consecutive Premierships, winning the 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 Grand Finals.

Ivan Cleary was appointed head coach in October 2018, having previously served in the same role between 2012–15. Former Penrith premiership winning head coach Phil Gould was the club&#x27;s general manager but departed in 2019.

==History==
Varied Penrith teams had played for many years between 1912 and 1966 in the Western Districts League under the control of the Western Suburbs RLFC. In the Parramatta competition after Parramatta was admitted to the NSWRL in 1947, and also in a second-tier Sydney competition introduced by the NSWRL in 1962. By this time a single top level rugby league team had emerged in the Penrith area and in 1964 they became known as the Penrith Panthers. The Panther had been chosen as the Penrith emblem after a public competition won by a graphic artist from Emu Plains named Deidre Copeland.

In 1966 word was out that the New South Wales Rugby League in 1967 would introduce two new teams to the Sydney premiership. There were three teams vying for the two proposed slots, Penrith, Cronulla-Sutherland, and the Wentworthville Magpies. Cronulla-Sutherland had been assured of one place, leaving Penrith and Wentworthville to fight it out for the other place. The NSWRL eventually settled on Penrith due to their location and a win in the 1966 Second Division title.

===1967 season (first season)===
After admission to the competition in 1967, they came second last (11th) on the competition ladder finishing only ahead of fellow 1967 newcomers Cronulla-Sutherland. Hopes were raised in 1968 under new Captain-Coach Bob Boland when they won the pre-season competition and finished 8th, but this improvement proved to be short-lived.

===1985 season (first finals appearance)===
Penrith had trouble attracting the sort of experienced players they knew they needed, and although they always had good junior talent coming through, they did not get the on-field leadership they needed. Penrith needed to wait until they could develop their own &#x27;stars&#x27;. They consequently struggled for almost 20 years before finally reaching their first finals series in 1985 with a team boasting new local star Greg Alexander and captained by Royce Simmons.

===1988–1991 seasons (first grand finals)===
Penrith developed a strong team in the late 80s and started to build momentum. They made their first Grand Final appearance in 1990 with a team boasting notable players Greg Alexander, John Cartwright, Brad Fittler and Mark Geyer only to be beaten by the Canberra Raiders 18–14. The next year Penrith met Canberra again in the Grand Final, this time winning 19–12, including two tries by Royce Simmons the former team captain in his last game. They went on to play Wigan in England for the 1991 World Club Challenge but were beaten by the British champions 21–4.

===1992–1995 seasons (downfall)===
Their reign was short-lived as in 1992 tragedy struck the club when the younger brother of Captain Greg Alexander, Ben, died in a car accident on June 21, 1992. Greg and close family friends Mark Geyer and Brad Fittler left the club soon after (Fittler left after the 1995 season as Penrith had signed with Super League) as well as coach Phil Gould who left midway through the 1994 season.

Penrith were coached by former player and club captain Royce Simmons starting with the last six games in 1994 until the end of 2001.

===1997–2000 seasons (back to finals)===
They made the finals during the 1997 Super League season.

The Panthers began the 1998 NRL Season with 2 wins from 5, to sit in the top 10, however, they would go on to win only 6 of their remaining 19 games to sit in 14th place out of 20, in doing so, setting an unwanted record for conceding the equal biggest choke in NRL history, against the Cowboys in Round 12, where they led 26-0, before losing 28-36 in Bluebet Stadium
In 2000, the Panthers finished in 5th place where they were defeated 28–10 by the Parramatta Eels in the elimination semi-final.

===2001–2004 season (build to a premiership)===
In the 2001 NRL season, Penrith came last on the competition ladder. The same year was Royce Simmons&#x27; last season as coach for Penrith, and he was replaced by John Lang from Cronulla in 2002, where they finished 12th. Their last game of 2002 showed hope as they proceeded to thrash the Northern Eagles, knocking them out of the final eight.

2002 showed the promise that was to come the next year. With the signing of Preston Campbell and Joe Galuvao, the side fired in 2003. Coming off 3 early season losses, they proceeded to lose only 3 other games for the rest of the competition with the local hero, Rhys Wesser scoring a new club record 25 tries. Penrith finished as Minor Premiers after convincingly accounting for the Parramatta Eels in the last round of competition. In the Finals series Penrith beat the Brisbane Broncos and New Zealand Warriors to reach the 2003 NRL grand final. Entering the match as underdogs, Penrith defeated the Roosters 18–6, with winger Luke Rooney scoring two tries. Hooker Luke Priddis, the other try-scorer for the Panthers, received the Clive Churchill Medal. The game is also remembered for a spectacular tackle by Scott Sattler in the 2nd Half, where he ran down and tackled Roosters winger Todd Byrne, who was sprinting down the left wing for an almost certain try. Penrith lost the 2004 World Club Challenge in the following pre-season, with the Bradford Bulls defeating them 22–4 in sub-zero temperatures. Penrith did however rally after that loss and once again qualified for the NRL semi-final series by finishing fourth and defeating St. George in the first week of the semi-finals before being knocked out by Canterbury-Bankstown in the grand final qualifier two weeks later.

===2005–2009 season (continued failures)===
Penrith then just failed to qualify for the Top 8 in 2005 finishing two points out and in 10th spot on percentages. They endured another below-par season in 2006 this time falling well short of the finals finishing the year in 12th position. The 2007 season turned out to be a poor one for the Panthers, they won only eight games, finished last and &quot;won&quot; the wooden-spoon for the second time in six years after losing to the New Zealand Warriors in the last round of the regular season competition.

In 2008, Penrith improved four spots on their 2007 performance by finishing in 12th spot out of 16 teams in the NRL competition with 10 wins, one draw and 13 losses. In 2009 they finished the season in 11th spot out of 16 teams in the NRL competition with 11 wins, one draw and 12 losses.

In 2009, Penrith finished 11th. In round 21 of the 2009 NRL season, Penrith drew with the New Zealand Warriors 32–32 the 2nd highest drawn NRL game of all time.

===2010 season (brief finals appearance)===
In 2010, Penrith had an excellent season, finishing in 2nd place in the ladder out of the 16 teams, with 16 wins and 9 losses. However, in the first round of the Finals series, they lost 24–22 at home to the Canberra Raiders and were knocked out in the second round when they lost 34–12 to the Sydney Roosters.

Michael Gordon played very well in that year, setting two new club records. In round 24, against the South Sydney Rabbitohs, he set a new club record for most points scored in one game: 30. By the end of the final game of the regular season, game 24, round 26, he had also set a new club record for the most points scored in one season at 270.

===2011–2013 seasons (rebuilding the club)===
After a 2010 season where the club went above and beyond expectations, they were looking to starting the new season on a high. It wasn&#x27;t to be, however, when they were thumped by Newcastle at the newly named Centrebet Stadium, 42–8. While round 2 went a lot better for the team, beating rivals the Eels at Parramatta Stadium 20–6, the year was marked by inconsistency as they finished 12th on the ladder.

In 2011, following another terrible start to the season, the Penrith board decided to sever ties with coach Matthew Elliot at season&#x27;s end. On 20 June 2011 he stepped down as coach and that same day Steve Georgallis was appointed caretaker coach for the remainder of the season. On 29 June Ivan Cleary was announced as coach for the next 3 seasons, with Georgallis staying as assistant coach for the remainder of the season.

2012 was again a disappointing year for Penrith, finishing second last with an 8–16 record. However, the club discovered some new talent in the form of winger Josh Mansour, a candidate for Rookie of the Year, as well as fullback Lachlan Coote&#x27;s successful move to five-eighth.

2013 began poorly for the Penrith; after a first up win against the Canberra Raiders, they went on to lose their next five games. However, a more inspired performance against the Parramatta Eels in round 7, where they won 44–12, was a trigger for a strong run; four wins from five games to see Penrith move into the top eight of the competition. The four wins included a 12–10 victory over the reigning premiers, Melbourne Storm, and a 64–6 thrashing of the New Zealand Warriors. However, after a year with mixed results, Penrith finished in tenth position, one win out of the top eight. At the end of the season, the likes of Luke Walsh, Lachlan Coote, Mose Masoe and Brad Tighe departed.

A playing roster overhaul saw the arrival of big name players such as Jamie Soward, Peter Wallace, Jamal Idris, Tyrone Peachey and Elijah Taylor at Penrith, while Matt Moylan took the vacant fullback role left by the departed Lachlan Coote.

===2014 season (big signings paid off)===
The 2014 NRL season was a good year for Penrith as they qualified for the finals and made it to the preliminary final before losing to the Bulldogs 18–12.

===2015 season (continued rebuilding phase)===
In the 2015 NRL season, Penrith endured a horror year on the field finishing second last. Penrith defeated bottom placed Newcastle in the final game of the season to avoid the wooden spoon.

===2016–2018 seasons (multiple finals appearances)===
The Penrith Panthers celebrated their 50th year in the NRL in 2016. Penrith started the season with 7 wins and 9 losses, they then finished the season winning 7 from 8 games to finish in 6th. In week 1 of the finals they defeated Canterbury 28-12, the next week Penrith were knocked out by Canberra losing 12–22.

In 2017, Penrith finished 7th on the NRL Premiership table and qualified for the finals. Penrith defeated Manly in week one of the finals 22–10 and then were defeated by Brisbane the following week 13–6 at Suncorp Stadium thus eliminating them from the competition. The Penrith reserve grade side fared much better, firstly winning the Intrust Super Premiership by defeating Wyong 20-12 and then defeating the PNG Hunters the following week in the NRL State Championship final 42-18.

In 2018, Penrith finished 5th on the table at the end of the regular season during which coach Anthony Griffin was sacked four weeks before the finals series after falling out with Phil Gould. Griffin was then replaced by Cameron Ciraldo for the remainder of the season. In week one of the finals, Penrith easily accounted for the New Zealand Warriors to set up a clash with Cronulla. Although both clubs were admitted into the competition in 1967 this would provide the first meeting between the two clubs in a finals match. In a tight game, Cronulla defeated Penrith 21–20 ending their season.

===2019 season (high expectations, low results)===
Before the commencement of the 2019 NRL season, Penrith were predicted by many to challenge for the premiership and reach the finals. Penrith got off to a bad start with the club winning only 2 of their first 10 matches leaving the team bottom of the table. Penrith would then go on to win their next 7 games in a row leaving them just outside the finals places. In a must win game against the Sydney Roosters in round 24, Penrith lost the match 22-6 at the Sydney Cricket Ground which meant that the club would miss out on the finals series for the first time since 2015.

===2020–2021 season (Back-to-back grand final appearances, third premiership)===
Penrith started the 2020 NRL season with three wins and a draw before suffering a 16–10 loss to Parramatta. The club then went on a 15-game unbeaten run to claim the 2020 Minor Premiership, only the third time in the club&#x27;s history they had achieved this feat.

Penrith would go on to reach the 2020 NRL grand final after going 17 games unbeaten throughout the year and in the finals. The opponents in the grand final were Melbourne who raced out to a 22–0 lead at half-time. Penrith came back in the second half of the game but lost the grand final 26–20 at Stadium Australia.

At the start of the 2021 NRL season, Penrith became the first team in Rugby League History to win their opening two games without conceding a point as they beat North Queensland 24–0 and then defeated Canterbury 28-0.

In round 4 of the 2021 NRL season, Penrith defeated Manly-Warringah 46–6 at Brookvale Oval inflicting Manly&#x27;s worst ever home defeat. The win also meant that Penrith had their best start to a season since 1997 when they won their opening four games in that year. It extended Penrith&#x27;s longest away winning streak to 10 which is tied in 1st all time in the NRL.

In round 5 of 2021 NRL season, Penrith defeated Canberra 30–10 at Penrith Stadium. It was Penrith&#x27;s best start to a season in their history. Penrith also became the first team to win 20 straight regular season games.

In round 6 of 2021 NRL season, Penrith defeated Brisbane 20–12 at Lang Park. It continued Penrith&#x27;s best start to a season, And also became the first team to win 21 straight regular season games. This win also made Penrith hold the record for most consecutive away wins (11).

The club would finish the 2021 regular season in second place, equal on points with Minor Premiers Melbourne but missed out on first place due to points differential. Penrith would then lose their opening match of the 2021 finals series losing to South Sydney 16–10.

In the week two elimination final, Penrith played against Parramatta for the first time in the finals since 2000. In the lowest scoring game of the year, Penrith won the match 8–6. In the aftermath, the club was fined $25,000 by the NRL after allegedly breaching the rules of the game in their victory over Parramatta. In a crucial part of the match with Parramatta on the attack, Penrith trainer Pete Green ran onto the field which stopped play as he attended to hooker Mitch Kenny in the 76th minute. The NRL rules state that trainers must not signal to the referee to stop play until an initial assessment has been performed, which was not done, and only then it should be stopped for serious injury.

In the 2021 preliminary final, Penrith gained revenge against Melbourne by winning the match 10–6 and booking a place in the 2021 NRL grand final against South Sydney.

Penrith met South Sydney in the 2021 NRL grand final and looked to redeem their loss in the previous years&#x27; Grand Final. The Penrith club finished the game in a thrilling 14–12 victory to claim their third premiership in the club&#x27;s history with Co-Captain Nathan Cleary securing the Clive Churchill Medal for his outstanding performance in the match.

On 8 October, the Penrith club were placed under investigation by the NRL after photos emerged which showed that the Provan-Summons Trophy had been damaged. The photos showed that the trophy had been separated from the base and surrounding wreath. Another image on social media also showed the trophy being treated as a baby with the bronzed artwork being carried around in a stroller.
The following week, it was announced that the Penrith players had been cleared of any wrongdoing in relation to the broken trophy. It was revealed that the trophy had been broken by a fan who had accidentally knocked it off the table which caused the trophy to break off at the base. On 19 October 2021, Nathan Cleary and Stephen Crichton were handed proposed fines of $7000 and $4000 by the NRL along with breach notices. This was in relation to both players caught on social media acting in a disrespectful manner toward the NRL Telstra Premiership Trophy. The NRL alleged Cleary and Crichton showed disrespect towards the individuals depicted in the iconic moment on the Trophy. On the same day, Tyrone May was stood down by the club and handed a breach notice along with a proposed fine of $7500. The NRL alleged May acted contrary to the best interests of the game for posting and being part of social media posts which do not align with the values of the game. On the 3 November 2021, Tyrone May was terminated with immediate effect following the grand final antics, as well as to previous breaches dating back to 2019. “As a club we understand our responsibilities to the game, our corporate partners, our members and fans, and the wider Rugby League community,&quot; Panthers CEO Brian Fletcher said.
&quot;The Board observed due process in this matter and considered all relevant factors before reaching its final decision. &quot;Panthers will coordinate with the NRL to ensure Tyrone receives access to any support services he needs moving forward.&quot;

===2022–2024 (Dynasty, Further Premierships)===
Penrith started the 2022 NRL season in strong fashion winning their opening eight matches in a row. In round 9, the club was defeated 22–20 by Parramatta at Penrith Stadium which ended their 21-game winning streak at the ground that stretched all the way back to the 2019 NRL season.

In round 23 against South Sydney, Penrith secured their fourth minor premiership by winning 26–22 at Stadium Australia.
Penrith would then go on to win both their finals matches against Parramatta and South Sydney respectively to reach the 2022 NRL grand final.

In the final, Penrith took an 18–0 lead at half-time against Parramatta before running out winners 28–12 to secure their second consecutive title and becoming only the second team after the Sydney Roosters to win back to back titles in the NRL era.

Following the grand final victory, the Penrith club came under scrutiny from sections of the media for their behaviour after the premiership win with James Fisher-Harris and Jarome Luai coming under the most criticism for their comments directed towards Parramatta.

Before the start of the 2023 NRL season, Penrith played against the Super League champions St Helens R.F.C. in the 2023 World Club Challenge. Penrith went into the game as heavy favourites but suffered a shock 13–12 defeat in golden point extra-time.

At the conclusion of the 2023 regular season, Penrith claimed their second Minor Premiership in a row and their fifth overall as they defeated North Queensland 44–12 to finish ahead of Brisbane on for and against. Penrith won their third straight premiership, and fifth overall, by beating the Brisbane Broncos 26–24 in the 2023 Grand Final after coming back from being 16 points down in the final 20 minutes. Ahead of the 2024 NRL season, Penrith travelled to England for their 2024 World Club Challenge final against Wigan. Penrith would lose the match 16–12.

On 6 October 2024, Penrith captured their fourth successive NRL premiership by defeating the Melbourne Storm in the Grand Final to the 2024 NRL season. This win exorcised the demons from their heartbreaking defeat to the Storm four years prior in what was to be the first of five consecutive Grand Finals which they would contest during this remarkable dynastic run of successive championships, the likes of which is unprecedented in the history of top-tier salary-capped sports leagues worldwide.

==Emblem and colours==

 Penrith&#x27;s uniform colours in the 1966 NSWRL Second Division and earlier years were blue and white but due to the Cronulla-Sutherland side registering a predominantly blue jersey design first, and with Newtown, Canterbury, Eastern Suburbs and Parramatta also displaying various shades of blue, Penrith went in search of an alternative. A decision was made to change their colours to Brown with a white V. This decision subsequently earned them the affectionate name of the &quot;Chocolate Soldiers&quot; thanks to radio commentator Frank Hyde who wrote in the Penrith Club journal &quot;these chocolate soldiers from out west – they don&#x27;t melt!&quot;.

The team had been referred to as the &#x27;Panthers&#x27; as early as 1970.

In 1974 Penrith changed their strip to a jerseys with brown and white vertical bars and again in 1991 they changed the colours to Black with White, Red, Yellow and Green stripes (drawing another confectionery-related nickname, the Liquorice Allsorts) until 1997 when Super League had all new jerseys made by Nike. The yellow was all but removed from the jersey at this stage. Then in 2000 they changed the colours once more to Black, Rust red, Teal green and White. In 2004 the design of the jersey changed once more to its current design. On Thursday, 23 November 2006 the club launched a new &#x27;alternate/away&#x27; jersey predominantly white in colour as a stark contrast to its main design.
 Just before Christmas 2007 the Panthers launched a new &#x27;home&#x27; jersey which is predominantly black with light grey claw marks on either side at the front and back. For Season 2010, the Panthers have launched a new predominantly teal away jersey, this teal jersey connect with the away jersey from their 03 and 04 season&#x27;s. With their official colours still Black, Teal green and rust red the alternate jersey was chosen to represent their secondary colour. The inception of Teal into the colour palet of Panthers links directly back to the unique colour their 2nd division jerseys had before brown and white.
In late October, 2010, the Panthers announced that rust would no longer be a secondary colour for the club. A was also launched, black with grey claw marks on either side. The club&#x27;s teal jersey was also scratched in Round 4, 2011, when a new white jersey with grey claw marks and teal and black stripes was announced the club&#x27;s new alternate jersey.

For the 2014 season the Panthers wore a redesigned black home jersey while the white away jersey prominently displays the new club logo. The Pink Jersey was also retained as a 3rd alternate strip, and used for Women in League and Breast Cancer Awareness rounds, or when both strips would clash with the opposing side. There was also a special Indigenous Jersey, worn in round 23 for the Indigenous Awareness round.

The Penrith Panthers unveiled a 50th anniversary logo to be used in 2016.

In 2017, Penrith decided to revert to their Liquorice Allsorts jersey from The 1990s. The club had asked the fans in 2016 what jersey design they wanted and the majority voted for a return of the jersey the club won its first premiership in. Panthers executive general manager Phil Gould said &quot;This is the jersey you wanted, We will respect our past as we set about creating our future – and this is the jersey that will carry us forward, You know in 50 years here at Panthers we&#x27;ve had over 50 jerseys, Now wouldn&#x27;t it be nice to have just one jersey for the next 50 years? I don&#x27;t know if that is possible but this is where we need to start&quot;.

Following their elimination from the 2018 finals, on 26 September 2018, the Panthers introduced a re-coloured logo to take effect in 2019. Completely removing teal.

After resting the Pink jerseys for the 2018 and 2019 seasons, the Panthers installed them as the permanent away jerseys from 2021 onwards. In 2024, they became the first team to both play in and win a Grand Final wearing Pink, as they were forced to wear their away jerseys due to opponents Melbourne finishing above them in the season.

==Ground==

The Panthers have played their home games at Penrith Stadium since their entry into the NSWRFL in 1967. Due to renovations and a complete stadium upgrade scheduled to take place during the 2025 season. The Panthers will play at CommBank Stadium in Parramatta, before returning to the new Penrith Stadium in 2026.

==Reserve and Junior Teams==

Notes: * Penrith will enter the NSWRL Women&#x27;s Premiership in 2025.

The club&#x27;s Juniors district is the largest Rugby League district in the world, with 8500 players and 580 teams split across all age levels in Penrith and Districts Junior Rugby League. The district encompasses the area between Blacktown, Katoomba, Hawkesbury and Wallacia.

Starting in the early 2010&#x27;s, the club expanded their focus further east of the Blue Mountains, investing in the surrounding areas of Bathurst, Forbes and Dubbo to expand their potential selection pool. This investment, as well as a greater focus on the Penrith Junior District resulted in an increase from five out of twenty five local players in 2012 to eleven of seventeen in the 2020 Grand Final.

==Penrith Panthers Leagues Club==

The Penrith Panthers Rugby League Football Club is the major financier the Penrith Panthers Leagues Club (of the Panthers Entertainment Group).

The Panthers Entertainment Group has five licensed club sites in NSW – Penrith, Port Macquarie, Bathurst, North Richmond, and Glenbrook. The clubs cater for a wide range of activities for members, their families and guests.

==Rivalries==

===Parramatta Eels===
Parramatta entered the NSWRL now NRL competition in 1947, meanwhile Penrith entered 20 years later in 1967. Parramatta are the closest NRL team to Penrith geographically.

Former Penrith player Reagan Campbell-Gillard spoke about Penrith and Parramatta saying &quot;As a Penrith junior, you come through the system to hate them. “I also don&#x27;t like that word but it is. It doesn&#x27;t matter what form you&#x27;re in, it&#x27;s a game you get up for&quot;.

In 2002, Parramatta thrashed Penrith 64–6 after a season in which Parramatta finished in first place on the ladder (and Penrith last). They would not meet again until Round 26, 2003, when the Panthers - in front of a then-record crowd - defeated Parramatta 40–22, denying the Eels a place in the finals (Parramatta had to win by 28+ points). Penrith went on to win the premiership that year. Round 17, 2009 saw a Penrith win by 38–34 in which the lead changed several times, before Parramatta recorded a huge 48–6 win in the penultimate round of the 2009 NRL season.

In the 2010 NRL season, Parramatta came from 22–0 down at half-time against Penrith to win 34–28 at Penrith Stadium with Parramatta player Jarryd Hayne starring with a man of the match performance.

Penrith then spoiled Nathan Hindmarsh&#x27;s 300th NRL game in Round 19 of the 2011 NRL Season. The Eels were up by 6 with two seconds to play before Penrith&#x27;s Michael Jennings made a break and kicked ahead for Lachlan Coote to score and force the game into golden point extra time. Halfback Luke Walsh then kicked a field goal in extra time to consign Hindmarsh to a 23-22 loss in his milestone match.

In round 5 of the 2020 NRL season, Parramatta came back from a 10–0 deficit at the 61st minute to beat Penrith 16–10, that would be Penrith&#x27;s only loss in the 2020 NRL regular season that year as Penrith finished as minor premiers.

In 2021, Penrith won both regular season games against Parramatta, the first being a one-point victory at Penrith. Parramatta had a chance in the dying seconds to win the match, which was supposedly to cement Mitchell Moses against Adam Reynolds for a position as half-back in the New South Wales State of Origin squad to replace the injured Nathan Cleary. The other match was played in Queensland due to the Sydney Coronavirus outbreak, saw Penrith defeat Parramatta 40–6 where Parramatta rested most of their starting players.

In the 2022 regular season, Parramatta were the only club to beat Penrith twice and were also responsible for ending Penrith&#x27;s unbeaten home winning streak which went back to the 2019 NRL season. In the 2022 Finals Series, Penrith and Parramatta faced off in the first week of finals. Penrith won 27–8 after a dazzling performance from Nathan Cleary. Parramatta managed to make their way to the 2022 NRL grand final facing off against Penrith for the fourth time that year. Penrith stunned Parramatta by going 18–0 up at half time with Nathan Cleary stating it was the best half they ever played. The onslaught continued as Penrith went 28–0 up at one stage, with Parramatta scoring two late consolation tries from Clinton Gutherson and Jakob Arthur. The final score ended 28–12 in favour of Penrith as they became the second team to win consecutive titles in the NRL era.

In round 4 of the 2023 NRL season, Parramatta met Penrith in the grand final rematch. Parramatta went into the game having started the season winless. Parramatta lead the match 16–8 with less than seven minutes to play but Penrith levelled the game at 16–16 after Nathan Cleary kicked a 40 metre field goal with seconds remaining. In golden point extra-time, Mitchell Moses kicked a field goal to win the game for Parramatta 17-16. In round 26 of the 2023 NRL season, Parramatta ended Penrith&#x27;s eight game winning streak, defeating them 32-18 at home and potentially halting their chances of a minor premiership.
In round 23 of the 2024 NRL season, Penrith staged one of the best comebacks in recent memory as they came from 16 points down to defeat Parramatta 36-34. Penrith scored three converted tries in six minutes to claim the victory.

Since Penrith entered the competition in 1967, the two clubs have only met in finals five times. The last being in the 2022 NRL grand final where Parramatta were beaten by Penrith 28–12 at Accor Stadium.

The name Inari can be literally translated into &quot;rice-bearer&quot;. In earlier Japan, Inari was also the patron of swordsmiths and merchants. Alternatingly-represented as male and/or female, Inari is sometimes seen as a collective of three or five individual &quot;kami&quot;. Inari appears to have been worshipped since the founding of a shrine at Inari Mountain in 711 CE, although some scholars believe that worship started in the late 5th century.

By the 16th century, Inari had become the patron of blacksmiths and the protector of warriors, and worship of Inari spread across Japan in the Edo period. Inari is a popular figure in both Shinto and Buddhist beliefs in Japan. More than one-third (40,000) of the Shinto shrines in Japan are dedicated to Inari. Modern corporations, such as cosmetic company Shiseido, continue to revere Inari as a patron kami, with shrines atop their corporate headquarters.

Inari&#x27;s foxes, or &quot;kitsune&quot;, are pure white and act as their messengers but it is more likely that in ancient times the fox itself was revered as the kami of rice.

According to myth, Inari, as a megami (female Kami), was said to have come to Japan at the time of its creation amidst a harsh famine that struck the land. &quot;She [Inari] descended from Heaven riding on a white fox, and in her hand she carried sheaves of cereal or grain. &quot;Ine&quot;, the word now used for rice, is the name for this cereal. What she carried was not rice but some cereal that grows in swamps. According to legend, in the ancient times Japan was water and swamp land.&quot;

Foxes running wild in rice-fields might have inspired the idea of Inari as they seemed to inspect the crops. To show their gratitude the farmers offered red rice and fried bean curd to the foxes.

==Depiction==
Inari has been depicted both as female and as male. The most popular representations of Inari, according to scholar Karen Ann Smyers, are a young female food megami and an old man carrying grains of rice. Historically, Inari started off as female until the rise of the Buddhist controlled government in Japan. At the time, many female high-power deities were changed to male, Inari included. The separation of Buddhism and Shinto began in the late 19th century under the Meiji regime as one of the early reforms. Some did not know whether to refer to Inari as male or female, so they left it up to each person. Because of her close association with &quot;kitsune&quot;, Inari is often believed to be a fox; though this belief is widespread, both Shinto and Buddhist priests discourage it. Inari also appears in the form of a snake or dragon, and one folktale has Inari appear to a wicked man in the shape of a monstrous spider as a way of teaching him a lesson.

Inari is sometimes identified with other mythological figures. Some scholars suggest that Inari is the figure known in classical Japanese mythology as the Shinto female deity Uka-no-Mitama (or possibly Uke Mochi); others suggest Inari is the same figure as the Shinto female deity, Toyouke. Some take Inari to be identical to any grain &quot;kami&quot;.

Inari&#x27;s female aspect is often identified or conflated with Dakiniten, a Buddhist deity who is a Japanese transformation of the Indian &quot;dakini&quot;, or with Benzaiten of the Seven Lucky Gods. Dakiniten is portrayed as a female or androgynous bodhisattva riding a flying white fox. Inari&#x27;s association with Buddhism may have begun in the 8th century, when Shingon Buddhist monk and founder, Kūkai, took over administration of the temple of Tōji, and chose Inari as a protector of the temple. Thus, Inari is still closely associated with Shingon Buddhism to this day.

Inari is often venerated as a collective of three deities (&quot;Inari sanza&quot;); since the Kamakura period, this number has sometimes increased to five &quot;kami&quot; (&quot;Inari goza&quot;). However, the identification of these &quot;kami&quot; has varied over time. According to records of Fushimi Inari, the oldest and perhaps most prominent Inari shrine, these &quot;kami&quot; have included Izanagi, Izanami, Ninigi, and Wakumusubi, in addition to the food deities previously mentioned. The five &quot;kami&quot; today identified with Inari at Fushimi Inari are Ukanomitama, Sarutahiko, Omiyanome, Tanaka, and Shi. However, at Takekoma Inari, the second-oldest Inari shrine in Japan, the three enshrined deities are Ukanomitama, Ukemochi, and Wakumusubi. According to the Nijūni shaki, the three &quot;kami&quot; are Ōmiyame no mikoto (water) Ukanomitama no mikoto (grain) and Sarutahiko no mikami (land). He is also &quot;associated&quot; with and/or thought to be Ukemochi. He is also sometimes thought to be the son of Susanoo named Uka no Mitama no Kami.

The fox, magical gems, scrolls with divine writings, and the wish-fulfilling jewel are prominent symbols of Inari. Other common elements in depictions of Inari, and sometimes of their &quot;kitsune&quot;, include a sickle, a sheaf or sack of rice, and a sword. Another belonging was their whip—although they were hardly known to use it, it was a powerful weapon that was used to burn people&#x27;s crops of rice.

Inari is also associated with the numbers 2 and 3, numbers with either one at the beginning, including and especially multiples of them able to be evenly divided by powers of 10, and multiples of 2 and 3.

He is also associated with brothels, entertainers, swords and swordsmiths, and food and meals in general besides rice.

==History==

=== Origins and Early History ===
The origin of Inari worship is not entirely clear. The first recorded use of the present-day &quot;kanji&quot; (&quot;characters&quot;) of Inari&#x27;s name, which mean &quot;carrying rice&quot;, (literally &quot;rice load&quot;) was in the &quot;Ruijū Kokushi&quot; in 892 AD. Other sets of &quot;kanji&quot; with the same phonetic readings, most of which contained a reference to rice, were in use earlier, and most scholars agree that the name &quot;Inari&quot; is derived from . 

The worship of Inari is known to have existed as of 711 AD, the official founding date of the shrine at Inari Mountain in Fushimi, Kyoto. The first reported occurrence of Inari is also recorded 711 in the story that a rich man used rice cakes as targets for practice and made the kami of rice resentful. The kami flew towards the mountains in the shape of a white bird and perched on a cedar. The man realised he had abused a divine gift and in order to pacify the kami he built a shrine where the bird had landed. 

Scholars such as Kazuo Higo believe worship was conducted for centuries before that date; they suggest that the Hata clan began the formal worship of Inari as an agriculture &quot;kami&quot; in the late fifth century. The descendants of the Hata-clan were conduction Inari-worship to protect their crops and let their commerce and trade flourish, showing that even at the early stages of Inari-worship the &quot;kami&quot; was already associated with rice and commerce. The name Inari does not appear in classical Japanese mythology.

Other possible origins could come from the Ainu who have ceremony for the harvest of crops. In this ceremony the older men receive cereal cakes and offer their prayers. This is reminiscent of the idea of kami being food and would explain the close relationship inari has with food, especially rice. Other practices in witchcraft and divination of the Ainu include the use of a fox skull, showcasing other similarities to Inari.

=== Heian Period ===
By the Heian period, Inari worship began to spread. In 823 AD, after Emperor Saga presented the Tō-ji temple to Kūkai, the founder of the Shingon Buddhist sect, the latter designated Inari as its resident protector &quot;kami&quot;. In 827, the court granted Inari the lower fifth rank, which further increased the deity&#x27;s popularity in the capital. Inari&#x27;s rank was subsequently increased, and by 942, Emperor Suzaku granted Inari the top rank in thanks for overcoming rebellions. At this time, the Fushimi Inari-taisha shrine was among the twenty-two shrines chosen by the court to receive imperial patronage, a high honor. The second Inari shrine, Takekoma Inari, was established in the late ninth century.

Inari&#x27;s popularity continued to grow. The Fushimi shrine, already a popular pilgrimage site, gained wide renown when it became an imperial pilgrimage site in 1072. By 1338, the shrine&#x27;s festival was said to rival the Gion Festival in splendor.

=== Medieval Period (1185-1600) ===
In 1468, during the Ōnin War, the entire Fushimi shrine complex was burned. Rebuilding took about thirty years; the new building was consecrated in 1499. While the old complex had enshrined three &quot;kami&quot; in separate buildings, the new one enshrined five &quot;kami&quot; in a single building. The new shrine also included a Buddhist temple building for the first time, and the hereditary priesthood was expanded to include the Kada clan.

=== Edo Period ===

During the Edo period, Inari worship spread across Japan; it became especially prominent in Edo. Smyers attributes this spread to the movement of &quot;daimyōs&quot; (feudal lords). Inari had by the sixteenth century become the patron of blacksmiths and the protector of warriors—for this reason, many castle compounds in Japan contain Inari shrines—and the &quot;daimyōs&quot; took their belief in their protector &quot;kami&quot; with them when they relocated to a new domain. Inari&#x27;s divine role continued to expand; on the coast, they became a protector of fishermen; in Edo, they were invoked to prevent fires. They became the patron of actors and of prostitutes, since their shrines were often found near the pleasure quarters where these individuals lived. They began to be worshipped as the &quot;Desire-Fulfilling Inari&quot;, a deity of luck and prosperity; a common saying in Osaka was &quot;Byō Kōbō, yoku Inari&quot; (&quot;For sickness [pray to] Kōbō, for desires [pray to] Inari&quot;). Inari also began to be petitioned for good health; they are credited with curing such diverse afflictions as coughs, toothaches, broken bones, and syphilis. Women prayed to Inari to grant them children.

After a government decree mandated the separation of Buddhist and Shinto beliefs, many Inari shrines underwent changes. At Fushimi Inari, for instance, structures that were obviously Buddhist were torn down. Among the populace, however, the blended form of worship continued. Some Buddhist temples, such as Toyokawa Inari, maintained Inari worship by arguing that they had always been devoted to a Buddhist deity (often Dakiniten), which the common folk had mistaken as Inari.

In the Tokugawa period, when money replaced rice as the measure of wealth in Japan, Inari&#x27;s role as a &quot;kami&quot; of worldly prosperity was expanded to include all aspects of finance, business, and industry. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, followers of Inari at the Ginza mint struck coins meant for offerings to Inari, which featured pictures of two foxes and a jewel or the characters for &quot;long life&quot; and &quot;good luck&quot;.

==Shrines and offerings==

Inari is a popular deity with shrines and temples located throughout most of Japan. According to a 1985 survey by the National Association of Shinto Shrines, 32,000 shrines—more than one-third of Shinto shrines in Japan—are dedicated to Inari. This number includes only Shinto shrines with full-time resident priests; if small roadside or field shrines, shrines kept in a home or corporate office, smaller shrines without full-time resident priests, and Buddhist temples were included, the number would increase by at least an order of magnitude.

The entrance to an Inari shrine is usually marked by one or more vermilion torii and some statues of &quot;kitsune&quot;, which are often adorned with red &quot;yodarekake&quot; (&quot;votive bibs&quot;) by worshippers out of respect. This red color has come to be identified with Inari, because of the prevalence of its use among Inari shrines and their torii. The main shrine is the Fushimi Inari Shrine on mount Inari (稲荷⼭ &quot;Inariyama&quot;) in Fushimi, Kyoto, Japan, where the paths up the shrine hill are marked in this fashion. The &quot;kitsune&quot; statues are at times taken for a form of Inari, and they typically come in pairs, representing a male and a female. These fox statues hold a symbolic item in their mouths or beneath a front paw—most often a jewel and a key, but a sheaf of rice, a scroll, or a fox cub are all common. Almost all Inari shrines, no matter how small, will feature at least a pair of these statues, usually flanking or on the altar or in front of the main sanctuary. The statues are rarely realistic; they are typically stylized, portraying a seated animal with its tail in the air looking forward. Despite these common characteristics, the statues are highly individual in nature; no two are quite the same.

Offerings of rice, sake, and other food are given at the shrine to appease and please these &quot;kitsune&quot; messengers, who are then expected to plead with Inari on the worshipper&#x27;s behalf. Inari-zushi, a Japanese sushi roll of packaged fried tofu, is another popular offering. Fried tofu is believed to be a favorite food of Japanese foxes, and in some regions an Inari-zushi roll has pointed corners that resemble fox ears, thus reinforcing the association. Priests do not normally offer these foods to the deity, but it is common for shops that line the approach to an Inari shrine to sell fried tofu for devotees to offer. Fox statues are often offered to Inari shrines by worshippers, and on occasion a stuffed and mounted fox is presented to a temple. At one time, some temples were home to live foxes that were venerated, but this is not current practice.

== Personalization ==
According to Inari scholar Karen A. Smyers, the &quot;most striking feature of Inari worship is the high degree of diversification and even personalization of this kami. Devotees do not simply worship &#x27;Inari,&#x27; but a separate form of Inari with its own name. Various Inari shrines and temples worship entirely different kami &quot;as&quot; Inari; traditions and symbols have a multiplicity of meanings.&quot; This is exemplified by the various kami Inari is identified with such as Uganomitama no Okami, Ukanomitama no kami, Ukemochi no kami, Wakumusubi no kami, and many more. In fact, except for ancestor worship, Inari worship is the most personalized of all Japanese religiosity. 

Smyers also describes the concept of &quot;personal Inari&quot; or &quot;watashi no O-Inari-sama&quot; in Japanese. &quot;One Shinto priest argued that the impulse to worship &#x27;my own Inari&#x27; arose during the late Edo period and accounted for the great spread of Inari shrines at that time.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;If there are one hundred believers, they will have a hundred different ideas about Inari.&quot; Smyers notes that Inari has been re-enshrined and divided with &quot;far greater ease and frequency than other Shinto kami, and this may in part account for its great diversity.&quot;

This personalization is not restricted to Shinto practitioners, but also has ties with Buddhism. Inari is often described as being the &quot;closest deity to humans&quot; according to a Toyokawa priest in Smyers&#x27;s article. &quot;&#x27;It [Inari] is like your own mother, it grants your wishes. In times of illness when even a doctor cannot cure you, you have no alternative but to ask Inari. Buddhas have various ranks; Dakiniten [one of Inari&#x27;s many other names] is at the &quot;ten&quot; (deva) level, the level closest to that of humans. So Inari has very close relations to people.&#x27;&quot;

Inari&#x27;s personalization also extends to Inari&#x27;s messengers, the kitsune. In fact, Smyers attests that the fox is &quot;the symbol most often equated with Inari.&quot;

Smyers&#x27;s analysis is essentially thus: &quot;Inari seems to have struck a fortuitous balance: famous and powerful enough to make people feel confident that he can help them, but lacking the sort of clear historical narrative that would prevent his personalization to fit particular needs.&quot;

Inari is thought to have both good and evil attributes.

== Inari pilgrimage ==
Like many other places of spiritual prominence, many practitioners of Shinto, especially Inari worship, take pilgrimage to Inari Mountain at the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto. Unlike other religions however, pilgrimage to and around the Fushimi Inari Shrine is the only standardized pilgrimage despite having some 40,000 shrines across Japan. This is in part due to the personalization Inari practitioners tend to have towards Inari as described above. &quot;They have little reason to worship some other form in another place, which may even be seen as someone else&#x27;s Inari,&quot; says Karen A. Smyers.

The pilgrimage begins starting &quot;at the foot of the mountain, in the midst of elegant red buildings house the five kami of Fushimi Inari Shrine and a number of other deities.&quot; Visitors need to first rinse their mouths and wash their hands, a means to symbolically purify one&#x27;s self before becoming near the kami. The many red torii that Fushimi is known for is the main gateway to convey that one is entering a sacred space. Along the way through these torii and up the mountain, one will find various rock altars, tea houses, waterfalls, and many cedar trees, which symbolizes Inari&#x27;s &quot;manifestation in the grandeur of nature.&quot; Upon reaching the peak, one &quot;passes the place associated with the miraculous assistance of Inari in forging the emperor&#x27;s sword.&quot; Then the pilgrim has a steady descent down the mountain and returns to the regular world outside of the sacred space. Despite this pathway, there is actually &quot;no fixed route one must take through the thousands of sacred sites on the mountain, and pilgrims and groups tend to develop their own sacred histories, worshipping at the sites that are invested with particular meaning to them.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;each version of the pilgrimage is a kind of musical improvisation on the theme of Inari.&quot;

Many traditions are also associated with Inari pilgrimage:

* Omo-karu ishi
** A type of rock divination in which one may be granted an answer to a yes or no question.
* Neagari no matsu
** This is a tree in which pilgrims in search of better business pray to.
* Echo Pond
** If someone has lost someone, the pilgrim claps loudly and if they hear an echo, it signifies that the person they lost shall return. 
* Oseki-San
** One of the many forms of Inari that is said to be able to cure coughs, and many letters are sent to this rock altar from all across Japan. Priests of Fushimi personally deliver these letters to the mailbox next to the altar. 
* Ninaigi
** Another tree upon the shrine grounds that is &quot;fallen over at an angle.&quot; Pilgrims who have &quot;stiff shoulders from carrying things come and rub them under this inclined tree, which is polished smooth as a result.&quot;
* Other traditions include &quot;tying votive bibs on the fox (and other) statues, offering food, dedicating larger or small torii, lighting candles, making segyo offerings (sometimes to the foxes) during the coldest season, and offering nobori banners in the kami&#x27;s name. Offering small banners (konobori) in large numbers was also practiced; each small prayer flag made of paper had the name of the kami (i.e., Suehiro okami), the name and age of the petitioner, and the request (e.g., complete recovery from sickness).&quot;

== Festival ==
Inari&#x27;s traditional festival day was the first horse day (the sixth day) of the second month (&quot;nigatsu no hatsuuma&quot;) of the lunisolar calendar.

In some parts of Kyūshū, a festival or praying period begins five days before the full moon in November; occasionally it is extended to a full week. This is accompanied by bringing offerings of rice products to a shrine to Inari each day and receiving &quot;o-mamori&quot; (&quot;protection charms&quot;).

<text>The City of Ephraim or Ephraim in the wilderness () is a city or village in Judea referred to in the New Testament in Gospel of John (). According to the Biblical narrative, after Jesus had raised Lazarus from the dead, the Pharisees and Chief Priests began plotting to put Jesus to death, so He retired to Ephraim with his disciples. They departed Jerusalem, shortly before Jesus&#x27; final Passover, arriving in Bethany six days before the Passover (John 12:1).

The New King James Version and World English Bible call Ephraim a &quot;city&quot;, whereas the New International Version and the New Living Translation call it a &quot;village&quot;.

Ephraim was located in the wild, uncultivated hill-country thirteen miles to the northeast of Jerusalem, &quot;perched on a conspicuous eminence and with an extensive view&quot; between the central towns and the Jordan valley. It is probably the same place as Ophrah (), Ephron () and the modern Palestinian-Christian city of Taybeh.

<text>Viscount Ridley is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1900 for the Conservative politician Sir Matthew White Ridley, 5th Baronet, Home Secretary from 1895 to 1900. He was made Baron Wensleydale, of Blagdon and Blyth in the County of Northumberland, at the same time, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The latter title was a revival of the barony held by his maternal grandfather James Parke, Baron Wensleydale, whose title became extinct upon his death since none of his sons survived him.

Lord Ridley was succeeded by his son, the second Viscount. He represented Stalybridge in the House of Commons. His son, the third Viscount, was Chairman of Northumberland County Council. The latter&#x27;s son, the fourth Viscount, succeeded in 1965. He notably served as Lord Steward of the Household from 1989 to 2001. , the titles are held by his son, the fifth Viscount, who succeeded in 2012. He is a writer.

The Ridley baronetcy, of Blagdon in the County of Northumberland, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain in 1756 for Matthew White, with remainder to the heirs male of his sister Elizabeth, wife of Matthew Ridley. He was succeeded according to the special remainder by his nephew, the second Baronet. He represented Morpeth and Newcastle-upon-Tyne in Parliament. On his death the title passed to his eldest son, the third Baronet. He was also a Member of Parliament for Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Baronet. He represented Northumberland North in Parliament as a Conservative. Ridley was the husband of Cecilia Anne Parke, daughter of James Parke, 1st Baron Wensleydale. When he died the title was inherited by his son, the fifth Baronet, who was raised to the peerage as Viscount Ridley in 1900.

Three other members of the family have also gained distinction. Nicholas Ridley-Colborne, younger son of the second Baronet, was a politician and was created Baron Colborne in 1839. The Honourable Sir Jasper Nicholas Ridley, younger son of the first Viscount, was an authority on banking and the arts. Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale, younger son of the third Viscount, was a Conservative politician.

The family seat is Blagdon Hall, near Cramlington, Northumberland.

<text>The Mark-8 is a microcomputer design from 1974, based on the Intel 8008 CPU (which was the world&#x27;s first 8-bit microprocessor). The Mark-8 was designed by Jonathan Titus, a Virginia Tech graduate student in chemistry. After building the machine, Titus decided to share its design with the community and reached out to &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; and &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;. He was turned down by &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;, but &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; was interested and announced the Mark-8 as a &#x27;loose kit&#x27; in the July 1974 issue of &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; magazine.

The Mark-8 was introduced as a &#x27;build it yourself&#x27; project in &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot;&#x27;s July 1974 cover article, offering a US$5 () booklet containing circuit board layouts and DIY construction project descriptions, with Titus himself arranging for US$50 () circuit board sets to be made by a New Jersey company for delivery to hobbyists. Prospective Mark-8 builders had to gather the various electronics parts themselves from various sources. A couple of thousand booklets and some one hundred circuit board sets were eventually sold.

The Mark-8 was introduced in &quot;R-E&quot; as &quot;Your Personal Minicomputer&quot; as the word &#x27;microcomputer&#x27; was still far from being commonly used for microprocessor-based computers. In their announcement of their computer kit, the editors placed the Mark-8 in the same category as the era&#x27;s other &#x27;minisize&#x27; computers. As quoted by an Intel official publication: &quot;The Mark-8 is known as one of the first computers for the home.&quot;

== Influences ==
Although not very commercially successful, the Mark-8 prompted the editors of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; magazine to consider publishing a similar but more easily accessible microcomputer project, and just six months later, in January 1975, they went through with their plans announcing the Altair 8800.

According to a 1998 Virginia Tech University article, Titus&#x27; Mark-8 microcomputer now resides in the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s &quot;Information Age&quot; display

<doc id="471326" wikidata="Q203251" url="?curid=471326" title="Ephraim">
<text>Ephraim (; , in pausa: &quot;ʾEp̄rāyīm&quot;) was, according to the Book of Genesis, the second son of Joseph ben Jacob and Asenath, as well as the adopted son of his biological grandfather Jacob, making him the progenitor of the Tribe of Ephraim.

Asenath was an ancient Egyptian woman whom Pharaoh gave to Joseph as wife, and daughter of Potipherah, priest of ʾOn (Heliopolis) (). Ephraim was born in Egypt before the arrival of the Israelites from Canaan.
The Book of Numbers lists three sons of Ephraim: Shuthelah, Beker, and Tahan. However, 1 Chronicles 7 lists eight sons, including Ezer and Elead, who were killed in an attempt to steal cattle from the locals. After their deaths he had another son, Beriah. He was the ancestor of Joshua, son of Nun ben Elishama, the leader of the Israelite tribes in the conquest of Canaan.

According to the biblical narrative, Jeroboam, who became the first king of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, was also from the house of Ephraim.

==Biblical criticism==
The Book of Genesis related the name &quot;Ephraim&quot; to the Hebrew root &quot;pārā&quot; &quot;to be fruitful&quot;. This referring to Joseph&#x27;s ability to produce children, specifically while in Egypt (termed by the Torah as &quot;the land of his affliction&quot;). The name Ephraim can therefore be translated as &quot;I will be fruitful&quot;, with the prefix of aleph (א) indicating the first person, singular, future tense.

In the biblical account, Joseph&#x27;s other son is Manasseh. Joseph himself is one of the two children of Rachel and Jacob, the other being Benjamin. Biblical scholars regard it as obvious, from their geographic overlap and their treatment in older passages, that originally Ephraim and Manasseh were considered one tribe – that of &quot;Joseph&quot;. According to several biblical scholars, Benjamin was originally part of the suggested Ephraim-Manasseh single &quot;Joseph&quot; tribe, but the biblical account of Joseph as his father became lost. Several biblical scholars suspect that the distinction of the &quot;Joseph tribes&quot; (including the Tribe of Benjamin) is that they were the only Israelites who went to Egypt and returned, while the main Israelite tribes simply emerged as a subculture from the Canaanites and had remained in Canaan throughout. According to this view, the story of Jacob&#x27;s visit to Laban to obtain a wife originated as a metaphor for this migration, with the property and family which were gained from Laban representing the gains of the Joseph tribes by the time they returned from Egypt; according to textual scholars, the Jahwist version of the Laban narrative only mentions the Joseph tribes, and Rachel, and does not mention the other tribal matriarchs at all.

In the Torah, the eventual precedence of the tribe of Ephraim is argued to derive from Jacob, half blind and on his deathbed, blessing Ephraim before Manasseh. The text describing this blessing features a hapax legomenon – the word שכל (&quot;sh-k-l&quot;) – which classical rabbinical literature has interpreted in esoteric manners; some rabbinical sources connect the term with &quot;sekel&quot;, meaning &quot;mind&quot;/&quot;wisdom&quot;, and view it as indicating that Jacob was entirely aware of who he was actually blessing; other rabbinical sources connect the term with &quot;shikkel&quot;, viewing it as signifying that Jacob was &quot;despoiling&quot; Manasseh in favour of Ephraim; yet other rabbinical sources argue that it refers to the power of Jacob to &quot;instruct&quot; and guide the Holy Spirit. In classical rabbinical sources, Ephraim is described as being modest and not selfish. These rabbinical sources allege that it was on account of modesty and selflessness, and a prophetic vision of Joshua, that Jacob gave Ephraim precedence over Manasseh, the elder of the two; in these sources Jacob is regarded as being sufficiently just that God upholds the blessing in his honour, and makes Ephraim the leading tribe.

<text>Viscount Runciman of Doxford, of Doxford in the County of Northumberland, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1937 for the Hon. Walter Runciman, a politician whose career included service as a Member of Parliament, President of the Board of Trade and Lord President of the Council. He was the son and heir apparent of the shipping magnate and Liberal politician Walter Runciman, who had been created a Baronet in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom in 1906 and Baron Runciman, of Shoreston in the County of Northumberland, in 1933, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. As his father was still alive at the time of the creation of the viscountcy the title of this peerage was &quot;Runciman of Doxford&quot; rather than simply &quot;Runciman&quot;. the titles are held by the first Viscount&#x27;s great-grandson David, the fourth Viscount, who succeeded his father in 2020. He is a well-known political scientist at the University of Cambridge.

Hilda Runciman, Viscountess Runciman of Doxford, wife of the first Viscount, represented St Ives, Cornwall in the House of Commons from 1928 to 1929. Also, the Hon. Sir Steven Runciman, younger son of the first Viscount and Hilda, Viscountess Runciman of Doxford, was a noted historian.

<doc id="471329" wikidata="Q412228" url="?curid=471329" title="Thyroglobulin">
<text>Thyroglobulin (Tg) is a 660 kDa, dimeric glycoprotein produced by the follicular cells of the thyroid and used entirely within the thyroid gland. Tg is secreted and accumulated at hundreds of grams per litre in the extracellular compartment of the thyroid follicles, accounting for approximately half of the protein content of the thyroid gland. Human TG (hTG) is a homodimer of subunits each containing 2768 amino acids as synthesized (a short signal peptide of 19 amino acids may be removed from the N-terminus in the mature protein).

Thyroglobulin is in all vertebrates the main precursor to thyroid hormones, which are produced when thyroglobulin&#x27;s tyrosine residues are combined with iodine and the protein is subsequently cleaved. Each thyroglobulin molecule contains approximately 16 tyrosine residues, but only around 10 of these are subject to iodination by thyroperoxidase in the follicular colloid. It takes two iodinated tyrosines to make a thyroid hormone molecule; therefore, each Tg molecule forms approximately 5 thyroid hormone molecules.

== Function ==

Thyroglobulin (Tg) acts as a substrate for the synthesis of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), as well as the storage of the inactive forms of thyroid hormone and iodine within the follicular lumen of a thyroid follicle.

Newly synthesized thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) exist as prohormonal modified tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin, which comprise the colloid within the follicle. When stimulated by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), the colloid of the follicular lumen is endocytosed into the surrounding thyroid follicular epithelial cells. When endosomes fuse with lysosomes in these cells, Tg is subsequently cleaved by proteases to release thyroglobulin from its T3 and T4 attachments.

Because of the hydrophobic nature of T3 and T4, they are able to then diffuse across the lysosomal membrane and into the cytoplasm. The active forms of thyroid hormone (T3 and T4), are then released into circulation where they are either unbound or attached to plasma proteins. Iodine is recycled back into the follicular lumen where it can continue to serve as a substrate for thyroid hormone synthesis, while the non-modified residues of Tg reenter cellular metabolic pathways.

== Clinical significance ==
===Half-life and clinical elevation===
Metabolism of thyroglobulin occurs in the liver via thyroid gland recycling of the protein. Circulating thyroglobulin has a half-life of 65 hours. Following thyroidectomy, it may take many weeks before thyroglobulin levels become undetectable. Thyroglobulin levels may be tested regularly for a few weeks or months following the removal of the thyroid. After thyroglobulin levels become undetectable (following thyroidectomy), levels can be serially monitored in follow-up of patients with papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma. 

A subsequent elevation of the thyroglobulin level is an indication of recurrence of papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma. In other words, a rise in thyroglobulin levels in the blood may be a sign that thyroid cancer cells are growing and/or the cancer is spreading. Hence, thyroglobulin levels in the blood are mainly used as a tumor marker for certain kinds of thyroid cancer (particularly papillary or follicular thyroid cancer). Thyroglobulin is not produced by medullary or anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.

Thyroglobulin levels are tested via blood tests including immunoassays and highly-sensitive thyroglobulin (hsTg) assays. These tests are often ordered after thyroid cancer treatment.

=== Thyroglobulin antibodies ===
In the clinical laboratory, thyroglobulin testing can be complicated by the presence of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (ATAs, alternatively referred to as TgAb). Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are present in 1 in 10 normal individuals, and a greater percentage of patients with thyroid carcinoma. The presence of these antibodies can result in falsely low (or rarely falsely high) levels of reported thyroglobulin, a problem that can be somewhat circumvented by concomitant testing for the presence of ATAs. The ideal strategy for a clinician&#x27;s interpretation and management of patient care in the event of confounding detection of ATAs is testing to follow serial quantitative measurements (rather than a single laboratory measurement).

ATAs are often found in patients with Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis or Graves&#x27; disease. Their presence is of limited use in the diagnosis of these diseases, since they may also be present in healthy euthyroid individuals. ATAs are also found in patients with Hashimoto&#x27;s encephalopathy, a neuroendocrine disorder related to—but not caused by—Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis.

<text>In mathematics, a partition of an interval on the real line is a finite sequence of real numbers such that

In other terms, a partition of a compact interval is a strictly increasing sequence of numbers (belonging to the interval itself) starting from the initial point of and arriving at the final point of .

Every interval of the form is referred to as a subinterval of the partition &quot;x&quot;.

==Refinement of a partition==
Another partition of the given interval [a, b] is defined as a refinement of the partition , if contains all the points of and possibly some other points as well; the partition is said to be “finer” than . Given two partitions, and , one can always form their common refinement, denoted , which consists of all the points of and , in increasing order.

==Norm of a partition==
The norm (or mesh) of the partition

is the length of the longest of these subintervals

==Applications==
Partitions are used in the theory of the Riemann integral, the Riemann–Stieltjes integral and the regulated integral. Specifically, as finer partitions of a given interval are considered, their mesh approaches zero and the Riemann sum based on a given partition approaches the Riemann integral.

==Tagged partitions==
A tagged partition or Perron Partition is a partition of a given interval together with a finite sequence of numbers subject to the conditions that for each ,

In other words, a tagged partition is a partition together with a distinguished point of every subinterval: its mesh is defined in the same way as for an ordinary partition. It is possible to define a partial order on the set of all tagged partitions by saying that one tagged partition is bigger than another if the bigger one is a refinement of the smaller one.

Suppose that together with is a tagged partition of , and that together with is another tagged partition of . We say that together with is a refinement of a tagged partition together with if for each integer with , there is an integer such that and such that for some with . Said more simply, a refinement of a tagged partition takes the starting partition and adds more tags, but does not take any away.

<text>Ara Gaya, also known as Ana Gaya, Asiryangguk (), and Anra, Alla (안라, 安羅), was a city-state kingdom in the part of Gaya confederacy, in modern-day Haman County of South Korea in the 6th century.

==History==
As the confrontational foreign policy of Daegaya failed, Ara Gaya and its less confrontational policy gained support in the 540s AD.

By the 6th century AD, Gaya could not risk the hostility of either Baekje or Silla (two of the Three Kingdoms of Korea that dominated the peninsula, the third being Goguryeo). Ara Gaya put a great deal of effort into pursuing a diplomatic solution for maintaining its independence, including hosting summits between Baekje, Silla and Yamato-Wa.

The Gaya confederacy was greatly weakened at the time, as northwestern Gaya states fell under the influence of Baekje and southeastern states fell under Silla&#x27;s influence. Ara Gaya sought to maintain its independence by allying itself with Goguryeo, and then asked Goguryeo to invade Baekje in 548 AD. This attempt to weaken Baekje&#x27;s sphere of influence failed when Goguryeo failed to succeed in the campaign.

In 553 AD, Silla defeated Baekje in war and occupied the Gyeonggi area (the Han River basin), breaking its 120-year alliance with Baekje. Silla, having started incorporating the parts of Gaya already under its sphere of influence, also invaded the rest of Gaya to eliminate Baekje&#x27;s sphere of influence there. Ara Gaya capitulated to Silla in 559 AD.

According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, It is presumed the four countries, Sinunsin (臣雲遣支報), Anra (安邪踧支濆), Sinbunhwal (臣離兒不例) and Geumgwan (拘邪秦支廉), have superior position in southern peninsula around the 3rd century.

Archaeologically confirmed remains include Ancient Tombs in Haman Marisan. its turned out to be the tombs of the ruling class of Ara gaya.

==Anra Conference==
Anra Conference (安羅會議) was held in 529, with following 1st Sabi Conference (541) and 2nd Sabi Conference (544).

<doc id="471354" wikidata="Q378148" url="?curid=471354" title="Johannes Ciconia">
<text>Johannes Ciconia ( – between 10 June and 13 July 1412) was an important Franco-Flemish composer and music theorist of trecento music during the late Medieval era. He was born in Liège, but worked most of his adult life in Italy, particularly in the service of the papal chapels in Rome and later and most importantly at Padua Cathedral.

==Life==
He was the son of a priest (also named Johannes Ciconia) and a woman of high social standing. Since at least three other men around Liège had that name as well, this has created biographical confusion, first solved by David Fallows in 1975. A Johannes Ciconia, probably the composer&#x27;s father, worked in Avignon in 1350 as a clerk for the wife of Pope Clement VI&#x27;s nephew. Another Johannes Ciconia is recorded in Liège in 1385 as a , generally identifying a person of young age; scholars agree that this is the composer himself.

Papal records suggest that Ciconia was in the service of Pope Boniface IX in Rome in 1391. His whereabouts between the early 1390s and 1401 are unknown. From 1401 until his death in 1412, he was connected to the cathedral of Padua in some capacity, likely in the service of archpriest Francesco Zabarella for whom he wrote the motet &quot;Doctorum Principum&quot;. However, it is unclear whether Ciconia arrived in Padua even earlier than 1401. His lament &quot;Con lagrime bagnadome&quot; is described in one source as written for the death of Francesco of Carrara – if this refers to Francesco il Nuovo (&quot;the New&quot;), it would date from after 1406; if, however, it was written for the death of Francesco il Vecchio (&quot;the Old&quot;), as scholars have assumed, this would place him in Padua as early as 1393. There is also the possibility of an intermediate stay in Pavia (as suggested by the scholars John Nádas and Agostino Ziino), on the grounds that this is where he would have connected with the House of Visconti and acquired knowledge of the &quot;ars subtilior&quot; style and the compositions of Philippus de Caserta quoted in his &quot;Sus un fontayne&quot; (&quot;Under a fountain&quot;) (see below).

==Music==
Ciconia&#x27;s music is an eclectic blend of styles. Pieces typical of northern Italy, such as his madrigal &quot;Una panthera&quot;, appear with pieces steeped in the French &quot;ars nova&quot;. The more complex &quot;ars subtilior&quot; style surfaces in &quot;Sus un fontayne&quot;. While it remains late medieval in style, his writing increasingly points toward the melodic patterning of the Renaissance, for instance in his setting of &quot;O rosa bella&quot;. He wrote music both secular (French virelais, Italian ballate and madrigals) and sacred (motets and Mass movements, some of them isorhythmic) in form. He is also the author of two treatises on music, &quot;Nova Musica&quot; and &quot;De Proportionibus&quot; (which expands on some ideas in &quot;Nova Musica&quot;). His theoretical ideas stem from the more conservative Marchettian tradition in contrast to those of his Paduan contemporary Prosdocimus de Beldemandis.

Although contrafacts and later manuscript sources of his compositions suggest that he was well known in Florence, his music is scarcely represented in major Florentine sources of the period; for instance, the Squarcialupi Codex contains nothing by Ciconia. But on the other hand, many of his motets and Mass movements are included in the manuscript known as &quot;Bologna MS Museo Internazionale e Biblioteca della Musica Q15&quot;.

<text>The People&#x27;s Redemption Council (PRC) was a military junta that ruled Liberia from 1980 to 1984. It was established after the 1980 Liberian coup d&#x27;état wherein Samuel Doe seized power on 12 April 1980. The Council, with Doe as its chairman, promised a complete overhaul of Liberia&#x27;s society, economy, and political system and the replacement of the corruption of previous regimes with respect for the rights of the Liberian people. The PRC had 17 founding members and was later expanded to 28. The PRC initially functioned as the executive and legislative body in Doe&#x27;s government. However, over time Doe consolidated power as a central executive. In 1984, the PRC was dissolved and replaced by the Interim National Assembly.

== History ==

=== Context ===

Since 1847, Liberia operated as an independent nation with a constitutional system modeled on that of the United States. For a long portion of its history, its government was dominated by Americo-Liberians, a group of free people of color and freed slaves from the United States and their descendants who first established Liberia in 1822 as a colony of the American Colonization Society, a private philanthropic organization based in Washington, D.C. and led by a number of leading American statesmen. From Liberia&#x27;s independence until the coup that gave rise to the PRC, the Americo-Liberians controlled nearly every aspect of Liberian political and social life, eventually creating a strict one-party system organized around the True Whig Party. After the death of long-serving President William Tubman in 1971, William Tolbert, Jr., became president. Tolbert&#x27;s administration, like his predecessor&#x27;s, was characterized by political suppression, a government dominated by the executive, and a continuation of the True Whig Party&#x27;s unquestioned control of the Liberian political sphere. In 1979, civil discord rose to an all-time high due to a 50% increase in rice prices, resulting in the deaths of dozens of Liberians in what became known as the Rice Riots of 1979. Public disaffection continued with Tolbert&#x27;s decision to host the 1979 Organization of African Unity annual summit in Monrovia, building a state-of-the-art conference center and hotel specifically for the event at a cost of more than USD$25 million. In addition to an overall lack of development and a stagnant economy, this unrest precipitated the 1980 Liberian coup d&#x27;état that would lead to the creation of the PRC.

=== Inception and operation ===

On 12 April 1980, Samuel K. Doe led a group of 17 soldiers in a coup d&#x27;état that overthrew and killed then-president William Tolbert. By 16 April 1980, Doe&#x27;s forces were able to begin consolidating power. The group formed the People&#x27;s Redemption Council as the supreme legislative and executive power with Doe as its chairman. In the wake of the coup, the PRC emphasized a goal of creating a new system of governance and societal organization rooted in support of the country&#x27;s commoners. Doe, as a native Liberian, claimed to be seeking equality of rights and status among all Liberians.

Shortly after its formation, the PRC authorized the arrest of over 100 former government officials from the Tolbert administration. Several of them were brutally beaten and executed in the weeks following the coup.

In its first fiscal year, the PRC increased military spending by 150%, which critics used to question the body&#x27;s commitment to a transition towards democracy. By early 1981, Liberian debt had nearly reached $800 million. Under the PRC, Liberia&#x27;s economy remained dependent on income from abroad. In mid-1981, the PRC created the National Constitutional Commission (NCC), the Constitutional Advisory Assembly (CAA), and Special Elections Commission (SEC) to, respectively, write a new constitution, revise the newly drafted constitution, and run democratic elections.

Shortly after its founding, Doe and the PRC increased the size of the body. Three of these new members were former officials from the Tolbert administration. Over time, conflict between military and civilian members led to division between progressives and conservatives, especially along ethnic lines. Some PRC members criticized their fellow councilmen for engaging in the very corruption that they publicly disavowed. In 1982, Doe and military PRC members executed several civilian PRC members who opposed them, which effectively ended the intra-council conflict.

=== International response ===
After the coup, the United States, the Organisation of African Unity, and the West African Economic Community criticized Doe and the PRC. Additionally, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank restricted loan terms offered to Liberia under the PRC.

=== Transition and disbandment ===
By December 1982, the NCC had completed its task of drafting a constitution. Despite disagreements between the PRC and the NCC concerning the timeline of a transition, the NCC&#x27;s draft was submitted to the CAA for revision. After their revisions were completed in late 1983, a referendum took place on 3 July 1984, that ratified the constitution.

With the ratification of the new constitution in 1984, the PRC was dissolved and replaced with the Interim National Assembly (INA) on 22 July 1984.

== Composition ==
At its inception, the PRC consisted of 17 soldiers. The PRC quickly grew to include a handful of civilians and several high-ranking members of the previous administration, bringing the PRC&#x27;s total membership to 28. The PRC was mainly made up of native Liberians and the majority of PRC members were Krahn, similarly to Doe, with a large number of members hailing from the same county as Doe.

== Powers ==
Immediately after the coup, the PRC prohibited organized opposition, dissolved the Legislature of Liberia, and suspended the Constitution, leaving the PRC as the sole executive and legislative body in the national government.

However, despite this consolidation of authority, Doe quickly consolidated executive and legislative power, effectively making the PRC a de facto cabinet rather than a body with powers of its own. Doe preserved his power through clientelism involving the army and by threat/use of force towards his opposition, including within the PRC itself.

== Legacy ==

Immediately after the PRC was disbanded, many of its members pursued positions of authority in the new government. Doe would win election as president in a highly contested and controversial election as the nominee of the National Democratic Party of Liberia. Many former PRC members then became members of Doe&#x27;s presidential cabinet.

While the PRC ruled formally by decree, its decisions and amendments to Liberian law would continue in effect unless and until a successor body rescinded them. Under the new constitution, Article 97, referred to by some as &quot;transitional provisions&quot;, provided no action taken by the PRC &quot;shall be questioned in any proceedings whatsoever&quot; and prevented any court or tribunal from hearing any case pertaining to the 1980 coup, the suspension of the prior constitution, the establishment and actions of the PRC, or any legal decisions made or penalties imposed by the PRC.

Colonist-native ethnic tension in Liberia had been prevalent since the arrival of the Americo-Liberians in the early 1800s. Doe&#x27;s favoritism towards the Krahn people increased tensions by encouraging boundaries and status differences among native Liberian ethnic groups. These differences led to sometimes violent relationships with the Gio and Mano peoples.

Under Doe and the PRC, poor nutrition, lack of access to drinking water, unemployment, and rising violent crime rates characterized life in Liberia. In the political sphere, political imprisonment was high and political discourse was suppressed.

<text>The Rivingtons were a 1960s doo-wop band, known for their 1962 novelty hit &quot;Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow&quot;. The members were lead vocalist Carl White (June 21, 1932 – January 7, 1980), tenor Al Frazier (died November 13, 2005), baritone Sonny Harris and bassist Turner &quot;Rocky&quot; Wilson Jr. Frazier was replaced by Madero White for a period in the late 1970s.

== History ==
The Rivingtons had originally been known as The Sharps and had success in the charts with Thurston Harris&#x27;s &quot;Little Bitty Pretty One&quot; in 1957. They then appeared on Duane Eddy&#x27;s 1958 hit &quot;Rebel-&#x27;Rouser&quot;, providing handclaps and rebel yells. They also recorded on Warner Brothers Records as The Crenshaws in 1961.

Their first hit as the Rivingtons was &quot;Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow&quot; (Liberty #55427, 1962). Like many such songs, it began with the bass chanting nonsense syllables (in this case the title), followed by the tenor singing over repetitions of it. &quot;Mama-Oom-Mow-Mow&quot;, an even more baroque rewrite of the theme, failed to sell, but they returned to the charts the following year with &quot;The Bird&#x27;s the Word&quot;. The B-side of &quot;Mama-Oom-Mow-Mow&quot; was &quot;Waiting&quot; (Liberty #55528).

After their two hit singles, the Rivingtons struggled to hit the charts. However, &quot;Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow&quot; and &quot;The Bird&#x27;s the Word&quot; were revived in 1963, thanks to a Minnesota-based group called The Trashmen recording &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot;, made up from the Rivingtons&#x27; songs&#x27; nonsense syllables. The Trashmen made it in a record shop and failed to properly credit the Rivingtons. &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot; was a medley of the Rivingtons&#x27; choruses minus the verses. The Rivingtons&#x27; manager reported it to their lawyers, and the Trashmen were ordered to add the surnames of the Rivingtons to the credits. Because of the publicity in &quot;Billboard&quot;, the Trashmen had to share the writing credits on the recording and on a later version as a sign of good faith. &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot; itself was revived in the late 1970s by The Ramones and The Cramps. The Trashmen&#x27;s version is now considered a classic by rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll aficionados.

The Rivingtons recorded several more songs in the 1960s, but their recording career ended after the Columbia single &quot;A Rose Growing in the Ruins&quot; failed to sell. They began performing live again in the 1970s, with Madero White replacing Al Frazier.

Carl White died of acute tonsillitis at age 47 in his Los Angeles home. Al Frazier, Sonny Harris and Rocky Wilson played the &quot;oldies&quot; circuit extensively throughout the 1980s, replacing White with Clay Hammond until 1987, then Andrew Butler into the 1990s. In 1989, the Rivingtons appeared in an episode of &quot;L.A. Law&quot; as a doo-wop group, &quot;The Sensations&quot;. They were later featured in a 1990 episode of &quot;Night Court&quot;, &quot;Razing Bull&quot;, as Mac&#x27;s former group-mates &quot;The Starlites&quot;.

==Discography==
The Rivingtons released a number of records on the Liberty label, including:

<doc id="471365" wikidata="Q205124" url="?curid=471365" title="Fuchsian group">
<text>In mathematics, a Fuchsian group is a discrete subgroup of PSL(2,[[Fuchsian group|R]]). The group PSL(2,R) can be regarded equivalently as a group of orientation-preserving isometries of the hyperbolic plane, or conformal transformations of the unit disc, or conformal transformations of the upper half plane, so a Fuchsian group can be regarded as a group acting on any of these spaces. There are some variations of the definition: sometimes the Fuchsian group is assumed to be finitely generated, sometimes it is allowed to be a subgroup of PGL(2,R) (so that it contains orientation-reversing elements), and sometimes it is allowed to be a Kleinian group (a discrete subgroup of PSL(2,[[Fuchsian group|C]])) which is conjugate to a subgroup of PSL(2,R).

Fuchsian groups are used to create Fuchsian models of Riemann surfaces. In this case, the group may be called the Fuchsian group of the surface. In some sense, Fuchsian groups do for non-Euclidean geometry what crystallographic groups do for Euclidean geometry. Some Escher graphics are based on them (for the &quot;disc model&quot; of hyperbolic geometry).

General Fuchsian groups were first studied by , who was motivated by the paper , and therefore named them after Lazarus Fuchs.

== Fuchsian groups on the upper half-plane ==
Let formula_1 be the upper half-plane. Then formula_2 is a model of the hyperbolic plane when endowed with the metric

:formula_3

The group PSL(2,R) acts on formula_2 by linear fractional transformations (also known as Möbius transformations):

:formula_5

This action is faithful, and in fact PSL(2,R) is isomorphic to the group of all orientation-preserving isometries of formula_2.

A Fuchsian group formula_7 may be defined to be a subgroup of PSL(2,R), which acts discontinuously on formula_2. That is,

* For every formula_9 in formula_2, the orbit formula_11 has no accumulation point in formula_2.

An equivalent definition for formula_7 to be Fuchsian is that formula_7 be a discrete group, which means that:

* Every sequence formula_15 of elements of formula_7 converging to the identity in the usual topology of point-wise convergence is eventually constant, i.e. there exists an integer formula_17 such that for all formula_18, formula_19, where formula_20 is the identity matrix.

Although discontinuity and discreteness are equivalent in this case, this is not generally true for the case of an arbitrary group of conformal homeomorphisms acting on the full Riemann sphere (as opposed to formula_2). Indeed, the Fuchsian group PSL(2,Z) is discrete but has accumulation points on the real number line formula_22: elements of PSL(2,Z) will carry formula_23 to every rational number, and the rationals Q are dense in R.

== General definition ==
A linear fractional transformation defined by a matrix from PSL(2,C) will preserve the Riemann sphere P1(C) = C ∪ ∞, but will send the upper-half plane H to some open disk Δ. Conjugating by such a transformation will send a discrete subgroup of PSL(2,R) to a discrete subgroup of PSL(2,C) preserving Δ.

This motivates the following definition of a Fuchsian group. Let Γ ⊂ PSL(2,C) act invariantly on a proper, open disk Δ ⊂ C ∪ ∞, that is, Γ(Δ) = Δ. Then Γ is Fuchsian if and only if any of the following three equivalent properties hold:

# Γ is a discrete group (with respect to the standard topology on PSL(2,C)).
# Γ acts properly discontinuously at each point &quot;z&quot; ∈ Δ.
# The set Δ is a subset of the region of discontinuity Ω(Γ) of Γ.

That is, any one of these three can serve as a definition of a Fuchsian group, the others following as theorems. The notion of an invariant proper subset Δ is important; the so-called Picard group PSL(2,Z[&quot;i&quot;]) is discrete but does not preserve any disk in the Riemann sphere. Indeed, even the modular group PSL(2,Z), which &quot;is&quot; a Fuchsian group, does not act discontinuously on the real number line; it has accumulation points at the rational numbers. Similarly, the idea that Δ is a proper subset of the region of discontinuity is important; when it is not, the subgroup is called a Kleinian group.

It is most usual to take the invariant domain Δ to be either the open unit disk or the upper half-plane.

== Limit sets ==
Because of the discrete action, the orbit Γ&quot;z&quot; of a point &quot;z&quot; in the upper half-plane under the action of Γ has no accumulation points in the upper half-plane. There may, however, be limit points on the real axis. Let Λ(Γ) be the limit set of Γ, that is, the set of limit points of Γ&quot;z&quot; for &quot;z&quot; ∈ H. Then Λ(Γ) ⊆ R ∪ ∞. The limit set may be empty, or may contain one or two points, or may contain an infinite number. In the latter case, there are two types:

A Fuchsian group of the first type is a group for which the limit set is the closed real line R ∪ ∞. This happens if the quotient space H/Γ has finite volume, but there are Fuchsian groups of the first kind of infinite covolume.

Otherwise, a Fuchsian group is said to be of the second type. Equivalently, this is a group for which the limit set is a perfect set that is nowhere dense on R ∪ ∞. Since it is nowhere dense, this implies that any limit point is arbitrarily close to an open set that is not in the limit set. In other words, the limit set is a Cantor set.

The type of a Fuchsian group need not be the same as its type when considered as a Kleinian group: in fact, all Fuchsian groups are Kleinian groups of type 2, as their limit sets (as Kleinian groups) are proper subsets of the Riemann sphere, contained in some circle.

== Examples ==
An example of a Fuchsian group is the modular group, PSL(2,Z). This is the subgroup of PSL(2,R) consisting of linear fractional transformations

:formula_24

where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; are integers. The quotient space H/PSL(2,Z) is the moduli space of elliptic curves.

Other Fuchsian groups include the groups Γ(&quot;n&quot;) for each integer &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0. Here Γ(&quot;n&quot;) consists of linear fractional transformations of the above form where the entries of the matrix

:formula_25

are congruent to those of the identity matrix modulo &quot;n&quot;.

A co-compact example is the (ordinary, rotational) (2,3,7) triangle group, containing the Fuchsian groups of the Klein quartic and of the Macbeath surface, as well as other Hurwitz groups. More generally, any hyperbolic von Dyck group (the index 2 subgroup of a triangle group, corresponding to orientation-preserving isometries) is a Fuchsian group.

All these are Fuchsian groups of the first kind.

* All hyperbolic and parabolic cyclic subgroups of PSL(2,R) are Fuchsian.
* Any elliptic cyclic subgroup is Fuchsian if and only if it is finite.
* Every abelian Fuchsian group is cyclic.
* No Fuchsian group is isomorphic to Z × Z.
* Let Γ be a non-abelian Fuchsian group. Then the normalizer of Γ in PSL(2,R) is Fuchsian.

If &quot;h&quot; is a hyperbolic element, the translation length &quot;L&quot; of its action in the upper half-plane is related to the trace of &quot;h&quot; as a 2×2 matrix by the relation

:formula_26

A similar relation holds for the systole of the corresponding Riemann surface, if the Fuchsian group is torsion-free and co-compact.

<doc id="471370" wikidata="Q467290" url="?curid=471370" title="An American Werewolf in London">
<text>An American Werewolf in London is a 1981 comedy horror film written and directed by John Landis. An international co-production of the United Kingdom and the United States, the film stars David Naughton, Jenny Agutter, Griffin Dunne and John Woodvine. The title is a cross between &quot;An American in Paris&quot; and &quot;Werewolf of London&quot;. The film&#x27;s plot follows two American backpackers, David and Jack, who are attacked by a werewolf while travelling in England, causing David to become a werewolf under the next full moon.

Landis wrote the first draft of the screenplay for the film in 1969 and shelved it for over a decade. Prospective financiers believed that Landis&#x27;s script was too frightening to be a comedy film and too humorous to be a horror film. After achieving success in Hollywood with the comedies &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot;, &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; and &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, Landis was able to secure financing from PolyGram Pictures to produce &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;.

&quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; was released in the US by Universal Pictures on August 21, 1981. It was a critical and commercial success, winning the 1981 Saturn Award for Best Horror Film and makeup artist Rick Baker winning the inaugural Academy Award for Best Makeup. Since its release, it has become a cult classic. A sequel, &quot;An American Werewolf in Paris&quot;, was released by Hollywood Pictures in 1997.

== Plot ==

Two American graduate students from New York City, David Kessler and Jack Goodman, are trekking across the North York Moors. As night falls, they stop at the Slaughtered Lamb, a local pub. Jack notices a five-pointed star on the pub&#x27;s wall. When he asks about it, the pub-goers grow hostile, prompting him and David to leave. The pub-goers warn the pair to keep to the road, stay clear of the moors, and beware of the full moon. David and Jack wander off the road and onto the moors, where a vicious creature attacks them. Jack is mauled to death and David is seriously injured. The beast is shot and killed by some concerned pub-goers who followed the pair. Instead of an animal carcass, David sees a nude dead man lying next to him before passing out.

David wakes up three weeks later in a London hospital. Inspector Villiers interviews David and informs him that the locals reported that an escaped lunatic attacked him and Jack. David insists a rabid dog or wolf attacked them. An undead Jack later appears to David and explains that they were attacked by a werewolf; since David was bitten, he is now a werewolf too. Jack is cursed to walk the earth in limbo, neither dead nor alive, until the wolf&#x27;s bloodline is severed. Jack urges David to kill himself before the next full moon so he does not harm anyone.

Dr Hirsch visits the Slaughtered Lamb to investigate, suspecting that David might have been influenced by local superstitions. When asked about the incident, the pub-goers deny any knowledge of David, Jack, or the attack. However, one distraught pub-goer privately tells Dr. Hirsch that David will endanger other people when he transforms.

Upon being released from the hospital, David stays with Alex Price, the attractive nurse who cared for him. Alex tells David that she is worried about his mental state, as he has been having hyper realistic dreams and nightmares. David is unconcerned, exhibiting a heightened sexual drive that he uses to seduce Alex. Jack, now even more decayed, appears and warns David that he will become a werewolf the following night, and again advises him to commit suicide. David refuses to believe him but when the full moon rises, he painfully transforms into a werewolf. He prowls the streets and the London Underground, killing six people. He wakes up the next morning naked on the floor of a wolf enclosure at the London Zoo, with no recollection of what happened, and returns to Alex&#x27;s flat.

After learning of the previous night&#x27;s murders and realizing that he is responsible, David unsuccessfully attempts to get himself arrested in Trafalgar Square. He calls his family to say he loves them, then loses the courage to slit his wrists with a pocket knife. David spots Jack, whose skeleton is now showing, outside an adult cinema. Inside, Jack introduces David to his previous night&#x27;s victims, some of whom are furious with David and suggest different suicide methods to free them from their undead state.

David transforms into a werewolf inside the cinema. He decapitates Inspector Villiers and wreaks havoc in the streets, killing several motorists and bystanders. The police surround and trap David in an alleyway. Alex arrives, runs down the alley and tries calming David by saying she loves him. Although David&#x27;s consciousness briefly appears to recognize Alex, the beast takes over and lunges towards her, forcing the police to shoot him dead. David reverts to human form in front of Alex as she mourns him.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
=== Development ===
John Landis came up with the story while he worked in Yugoslavia as a production assistant on the film &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (1970). According to Landis, he and a Yugoslav member of the crew were driving in the back of a car on location when they came across a group of Romani people. The Romani people appeared to be performing rituals on a man being buried so that he would not &quot;rise from the grave.&quot;

Landis wrote the first draft of &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; in 1969 and shelved it for over a decade. Two years later, Landis wrote, directed, and starred in his debut film, &quot;Schlock&quot;, which developed a cult following. Landis developed box-office status in Hollywood through the successful comedies, &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot;, &quot;Animal House&quot; and &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; before securing $10 million financing from PolyGram Pictures for his werewolf film. Financiers believed that Landis&#x27;s script was too frightening to be a comedy and too funny to be a horror film. Universal Studios execs were pressuring the director to cast Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as David Kessler and Jack Goodman but Landis went with unknown actors instead.

=== Filming ===
Filming took place between February and March 1981 because director John Landis wanted the film to take place during poor weather.

The moors were filmed around the Black Mountains in Wales, and East Proctor is in reality the tiny village of Crickadarn, about southeast of Builth Wells off the A470. The Angel of Death statue was a prop added for the film, but the red phone box is real, though the Welsh road signs were covered by a fake tree.

The pub shown in the film known as the Slaughtered Lamb was actually a cottage located in Crickadarn, and the interior scenes were filmed in the Black Swan, Old Lane, Martyrs Green in Surrey.

&quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; was the first film allowed to shoot in Piccadilly Circus in 15 years. Landis accomplished this by inviting 300 members of Greater London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Service to a screening of his new film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. The police were so impressed by his work that they granted the production a two-night filming permit between 1 and 4 a.m. Traffic was stopped only three times for two-minute increments to film the automobile stunts involving the double-decker bus. Other filming locations included Putney General Hospital, Chiswick Maternity Hospital, Redcliffe Square in Earl&#x27;s Court, the area around Tower Bridge, South Kensington Underground station, Tottenham Court Road Underground station, London Zoo, Putney High Street, Belgravia, Hampstead and Southwark.

Filming also took place at Twickenham Film Studios in Richmond Upon Thames.

=== Music ===
The film&#x27;s ironically upbeat soundtrack consists of songs which refer to the moon. Bobby Vinton&#x27;s slow, soothing version of &quot;Blue Moon&quot; plays during the opening credits, Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Moondance&quot; plays as David and Alex make love for the first time, Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; plays as David nears the moment of changing to the werewolf, a soft, bittersweet ballad version of &quot;Blue Moon&quot; by Sam Cooke plays during the agonizing wolf transformation, and the Marcels&#x27; doo-wop version of &quot;Blue Moon&quot; plays over the end credits.

The score was composed and conducted by Elmer Bernstein and recorded at Olympic Studios in London, engineered by Keith Grant. Bernstein&#x27;s score can be heard during David&#x27;s nightmares, when Dr Hirsch drives through the moors to East Proctor, and when Alex confronts David in the alley. Though Bernstein wrote and recorded music to accompany the transformation scene, the director chose not to use it. The three-minute passage was eventually released by Bernstein under the title &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;.

== Release ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; was released August 21, 1981, and grossed $30 million at the box office in the United States and $62 million worldwide against the budget of under $6 million.

=== Home media ===
The film was first released in 1981 on VHS and Betamax under the MCA Videocassette Inc. label and on LaserDisc and CED under the MCA Videodisc label. In 1984, MCA Home Video released it on LaserDisc. This would be the last time Universal would release the movie on home video for 17 years. The following year, Vestron Video acquired the video rights from MCA/Universal and released it on VHS, Betamax and LaserDisc in 1985. It was released again on LaserDisc in 1989 (under Image Entertainment through Vestron) and 1995 (under LIVE Entertainment), and again on VHS in 1990 under the Video Treasures label and 1991 and 1994 from Vestron Video (through LIVE Home Video).

The film was first released on DVD in December 1997 by LIVE Entertainment according to a LIVE DVD Advertisement. It was presented in a non-anamorphic widescreen transfer and contained the film&#x27;s theatrical teaser trailer. Universal eventually got the video rights back and released a 20th-anniversary &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; DVD on September 18, 2001, making it the first time Universal released the film on home video since 1984. It included an audio commentary with actors David Naughton and Griffin Dunne, interviews with John Landis and Rick Baker, a 1981 promotional featurette, silent outtakes, storyboards and production photographs. A coinciding VHS was released on the same day. The high-definition version of the film was first released on HD DVD by Universal on November 28, 2006. A high-definition Blu-ray Disc and 2-disc standard-definition Region 1 DVD release of the film titled &quot;An American Werewolf in London – Full Moon Edition&quot; was released by Universal on September 15, 2009. The Region 2 DVDs and Blu-ray were released on September 28 and are known as &quot;An American Werewolf in London – Special Edition&quot;.

The Region 2 DVD release does not include a scene that is fully intact on the Region 1 release and all previous Region 1 and 2 releases. The scene takes place near the end of the film when David calls his parents from a public telephone box. All but the end of this scene had been cut from the Region 2 release due to a mastering error.

As of October 2009, Universal said that they were scrapping all existing faulty stock and issuing replacement DVDs. All Blu-ray releases, however, are intact.

In 2016, Universal re-released the film on Blu-ray as a &quot;Restored Edition&quot; to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the film&#x27;s release. On October 29, 2019, Arrow Video released a 4K restoration as part of a Blu-ray box set that contains all previously released extra material; the documentary &quot;Mark of The Beast: The Legacy of the Universal Werewolf&quot;; the 2009 making-of documentary &quot;Beware the Moon&quot;; filmmaker Jon Spira&#x27;s video essay &quot;I Think He&#x27;s a Jew: The Werewolf&#x27;s Secret;&quot; a new interview with Landis; lobby cards and a booklet.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===

At the time of its release, Roger Ebert reviewed the film unfavorably, giving it two out of four stars and writing,&quot;&quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; seems curiously unfinished, as if director John Landis spent all his energy on spectacular set pieces and then didn&#x27;t want to bother with things like transitions, character development or an ending.&quot;

In retrospective reviews, critics have extolled the film as a cult classic. &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; described it as a &quot;curious but oddly endearing mixture of horror film and spoof, of comedy and shock, with everything grist to its mill including tourist Britain and the wedding of Prince Charles. The special effects are notable and signaled new developments in this field.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed it in their 1996 &quot;Greatest Movies Ever Made&quot;, saying that the transformation effects by Rick Baker changed the face of horror makeup in the 1980s. In his book &quot;Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914-2008&quot;, Bruce G. Hallenbeck lambasted the film&#x27;s inconsistent tone, juvenile humor, poor direction, and emphasis on shock value to the detriment of continuity and plot. He cited Rick Baker&#x27;s makeup effects and Jenny Agutter&#x27;s performance as genuinely powerful, but concluded that &quot;thanks to the director&#x27;s insincerity, slapdash approach and what appears to be a thinly veiled contempt for the material, [&quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;] succeeds neither as comedy nor as horror.&quot;

 On Metacritic, the film has a score of 55 out of 100 based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Kim Newman of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine gave the film a rating of four out of five stars, writing that &quot;carnivorous lunar activities rarely come any more entertaining than this&quot;. Tom Huddleston of &quot;Time Out&quot; also gave the film a positive review, calling it &quot;not just gory but actually frightening, not just funny but clever&quot;.

=== Awards and accolades ===
At the 54th Academy Awards, &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; won the first-ever Academy Award for Best Makeup. During the 1982 Saturn Awards, the film won for Best Horror Film and Best Makeup and was nominated for Best Actress and Best Writing.

A 2008 &quot;Empire&quot; magazine poll of critics and readers named &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; as the 107th-greatest film of all time.

== Legacy ==
=== Media recognition ===
&quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; is chiefly appreciated as a milestone in the comedy-horror genre and for its innovative makeup effects. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; stated that it was &quot;the first mainstream hit which managed to make its gross-out effects simultaneously shocking and hilarious&quot; and called the signature werewolf transformation scene &quot;stunningly ingenious, without a computer effect in sight, but also suffused with squirm-inducing agony.&quot; The &quot;Telegraph&quot; also cited the slew of 1980s genre films which came after &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; and followed the film&#x27;s example of blending visceral horror effects with comedy, such as &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, &quot;Gremlins&quot; and &quot;Evil Dead 2&quot;. Director Edgar Wright (&quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;) cited the film as a major inspiration for his own film-making and a milestone in the genre. The low budget independent film &quot;The Snarling&quot; (2018) was heavily inspired by Landis&#x27;s film and contains various motifs and references including a cameo by Albert Moses paying direct tribute to his role in the film.

Pat Reid of &quot;Empire&quot;, reviewing the film in 2000, thought that the blending of comedic and horror elements &quot;don&#x27;t always sit well side-by-side,&quot; but called the transformation scene &quot;undoubtedly a classic&quot; because of its &quot;good old-fashioned makeup and trickery making the incredible seem real.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Joshua Rothkopf, writing on the 35th anniversary of the film&#x27;s release, called &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; an &quot;allegory of exoticized Jewishness&quot;. This is embodied by the character of David and his growing awareness of his &quot;otherness&quot; as a werewolf alongside his own outsider status as a Jewish American in England. &quot;Hiding a secret deep within one&#x27;s body, strange urges, xenophobic glances, accusatory feelings of guilt: David&#x27;s condition already has a name, and this won&#x27;t be the first film in which Jewish otherness is made monstrous.&quot; The article also celebrated the film as an innovative mix of humor and horror, &quot;a landmark in startling makeup effects&quot;, and &quot;a riotous piece of fish-out-of-water college humor.&quot;

Michael Jackson, who was a fan of the film, chose John Landis to direct and Rick Baker to direct makeup effects for his 1983 &quot;Thriller&quot; music video based on the strength of their work in &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;. It went on to become one of the most lauded music videos of all time.

=== Director&#x27;s regrets ===
Director John Landis has expressed regret over changing, and even cutting, certain sequences from the final cut of the film in order to earn an R-rating in the United States. The sex scene between Alex and David was edited to be less explicit, and an extended scene showing the homeless men along the Thames being attacked by the werewolf was eliminated after a test audience reacted negatively to it. Another showed the undead Jack eating a piece of toast which falls out of his torn throat. Landis also concluded that the werewolf transformation scene should have been shorter; he was so fascinated by the quality of Rick Baker&#x27;s effects that he spent more time on the scene than he otherwise would have.

=== Radio adaptation ===
A radio adaptation of the film was broadcast on BBC Radio 1 in 1997, produced by Dirk Maggs and featuring Jenny Agutter, Brian Glover, and John Woodvine reprising the roles of Alex Price, the chess player (now named George Hackett, and with a more significant role as East Proctor&#x27;s special constable), and Dr Hirsch, respectively. The roles of David and Jack were played by Eric Meyers and William Dufris.

=== Sequel ===
The film was followed by a sequel, &quot;An American Werewolf in Paris&quot;, released in 1997. The sequel features a completely different cast and crew, and was distributed by Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Pictures. It was poorly-received by critics and flopped at the box office.

=== Retrospective documentary ===
In 2009, a retrospective documentary film, &quot;Beware the Moon: Remembering An American Werewolf in London&quot;, was released. An accompanying book by the documentary&#x27;s director, Paul Davis, was published in 2016.

=== Proposed remake ===
In June 2009, it was announced that Dimension Films was working with producers Sean and Bryan Furst on a remake of the film. This has since been delayed due to other commitments. In August 2016, several reports suggested that Max Landis (son of director John Landis) was considering remaking the film. In November 2016, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that Max Landis would write and direct a remake.

In December 2017, Max Landis confirmed on Twitter that he had completed the first draft of the script. But beginning in late 2017, accusations by a number of women that Landis had abused them emotionally or sexually began to emerge publicly. In the wake of those allegations, it remains unknown if Landis will be replaced or if the project will be put on indefinite hold.

In November 2019, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Robert Kirkman, creator of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; comic book series, was in consideration as a producer for a new reboot of &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;.

<doc id="471373" wikidata="Q1900757" url="?curid=471373" title="Marker interface pattern">
<text>The marker interface pattern is a design pattern in computer science, used with languages that provide run-time type information about objects. It provides a means to associate metadata with a class where the language does not have explicit support for such metadata.

To use this pattern, a class implements a marker interface (also called tagging interface) which is an empty interface, and methods that interact with instances of that class test for the existence of the interface. Whereas a typical interface specifies functionality (in the form of method declarations) that an implementing class must support, a marker interface need not do so. The mere presence of such an interface indicates specific behavior on the part of the implementing class. Hybrid interfaces, which both act as markers and specify required methods, are possible but may prove confusing if improperly used.

== Example ==
An example of the application of marker interfaces from the Java programming language is the interface:
package java.io;

public interface Serializable {

A class implements this interface to indicate that its non-transient data members can be written to an . The codice_1 private method codice_2 contains a series of codice_3 tests to determine writeability, one of which looks for the codice_4 interface. If any of these tests fails, the method throws a codice_5.

==Critique==
One problem with marker interfaces is that, since an interface defines a contract for implementing classes, and that contract is inherited by all subclasses, a marker cannot be &quot;unimplemented&quot;. In the example given, any subclass not intended for serialization (perhaps it depends on transient state), must explicitly throw NotSerializableException exceptions (per codice_1 docs).

Another solution is for the language to support metadata directly:
* Both the .NET Framework and Java (as of Java 5 (1.5)) provide support for such metadata. In .NET, they are called &quot;custom attributes&quot;, in Java they are called &quot;annotations&quot;. Despite the different name, they are conceptually the same thing. They can be defined on classes, member variables, methods, and method parameters and may be accessed using reflection.
* In Python, the term &quot;marker interface&quot; is common in Zope and Plone. Interfaces are declared as metadata and subclasses can use codice_7 to declare they do not implement everything from their super classes.

<doc id="471374" wikidata="Q181460" url="?curid=471374" title="Er (Cyrillic)">
<text>Er (Р р; italics: &quot;Р р&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script.

It commonly represents the alveolar trill , like the &quot;rolled&quot; sound in the Scottish pronunciation of in &quot;curd&quot;.

==History==
The Cyrillic letter Er was derived from the Greek letter Rho (Ρ ρ). It has no connection to the Latin letter P (P p), which evolved from the Greek letter Pi (Π π), despite both having the same form.

The name of Er in the Early Cyrillic alphabet was (&quot;rĭci&quot;), meaning &quot;speak&quot;.

In the Cyrillic numeral system, er had a value of 100.

==Form==
The Cyrillic letter Er (Р р) looks similar to the Greek letter Rho (Ρ ρ), and the same as the Latin letter P (P p; П in Cyrillic).

==Usage==
As used in the alphabets of various languages, р represents the following sounds:

<text>Pruning is a horticultural, arboricultural, and silvicultural practice involving the selective removal of certain parts of a plant, such as branches, buds, or roots.

The practice entails the &quot;targeted&quot; removal of diseased, damaged, dead, non-productive, structurally unsound, or otherwise unwanted plant material from crop and landscape plants. In general, the smaller the branch that is cut, the easier it is for a woody plant to compartmentalize the wound and thus limit the potential for pathogen intrusion and decay. It is therefore preferable to make any necessary formative structural pruning cuts to young plants, rather than removing large, poorly placed branches from mature plants.

Woody plants may undergo a process referred to as &quot;self-pruning&quot;, where they will drop twigs or branches which are no longer producing more energy than they require. It is theorized that this process can also occur in response to lack of water, in order to reduce the surface area where water can be lost. This natural shedding of branches is called cladoptosis.

Specialized pruning practices may be applied to certain plants, such as roses, fruit trees, and grapevines. Different pruning techniques may be used on herbaceous plants than those used on perennial woody plants.

Reasons to prune plants include deadwood removal, shaping (by controlling or redirecting growth), improving or sustaining health, reducing risk from falling branches, preparing nursery specimens for transplanting, and both harvesting and increasing the yield or quality of flowers and fruits.

==Pruning terms==
=== Branch wood ===
Branch wood is an individual stem that grows off of another stem.

=== Trunk wood ===
Trunk wood is the main stem of a tree which individual stems grow out of. 

=== Branch collar ===
This refers to the area below the union of where branch wood attaches with the trunk/stem wood. This can often appear raised.

=== Branch bark ridge ===
This refers to the junction between branch wood and trunk/stem wood. It usually looks raised. 

==Types of Pruning==

Pruning in an urban setting is crucial due to the tree being in drastically different conditions than where they naturally grow. 

Arborists, orchardists, and gardeners use various garden tools and tree cutting tools designed for the purpose, such as secateurs, loppers, handsaws, or chainsaws. Additionally in forestry, pole pruners and pole saws are commonly used and these are often attached to poles that reach up to 5-6 m, this is a more efficient way of pruning than with ladders. These bush saws on polls have also been motorized as chainsaws which is even more efficient. Older technology used Billhooks, Kaiser blades and pruning knives. Although still used in some coppicing they are not used so much in commercial forestry due to the difficulty of cutting flush with the stem. Flush cuts happen when you cut into the cambium layer of the main trunk which can happen when you are not precise with pruning cuts and remove a portion of the branch collar which can put the tree at risk of entry cords from forest pathogens.

Although there are several different types of pruning they can be simplified into two categories. One of which is cutting the branch back to a specific and intermediate point, called &quot;reduction cut&quot;, and the other completely removes a branch back to the union where the branch connects which the main trunk, called &quot;removal cut&quot;.

Reduction cuts is when you remove a portion of a growing stem down to a set of desirable buds or side-branching stems. This is commonly performed in well trained plants for a variety of reasons, for example to stimulate growth of flowers, fruit or branches, as a preventive measure to wind and snow damage on long stems and branches, and finally to encourage growth of the stems in a desirable direction. 
*Thinning: A more drastic form of pruning, a thinning out cut is the removal of an entire shoot, limb, or branch at its point of origin. This is usually employed to revitalize a plant by removing over-mature, weak, problematic, and excessive growths. When performed correctly, thinning encourages the formation of new growth that will more readily bear fruit and flowers. This is a common technique in pruning roses and for amplifying and &quot;opening-up&quot; the branching of neglected trees, or for renewing shrubs with multiple branches.
* Topping: Topping is a very severe form of pruning which involves removing all branches and growths down to a few large branches or to the trunk of the tree. When performed correctly it is used on very young trees, and can be used to begin training younger trees for pollarding or for trellising to form an espalier.
* Raising removes the lower branches from a tree in order to provide clearance for buildings, vehicles, pedestrians, and vistas. 
* Reduction reduces the size of a tree, often for clearance for utility lines. Reducing the height or spread of a tree is best accomplished by pruning back the leaders and branch terminals to lateral branches that are large enough to assume the terminal roles (at least one-third the diameter of the cut stem). Compared to topping, reduction helps maintain the form and structural integrity of the tree.

In orchards, fruit trees are often lopped to encourage regrowth and to maintain a smaller tree for ease of picking fruit. The pruning regime in orchards is more planned and the productivity of each tree is an important factor.

=== Deadwooding ===
Branches die off for a number of reasons including sunlight deficiency, pest and disease damage, and root structure damage. A dead branch will at some point decay back to the parent stem and fall off. This is normally a slow process but can be hastened by high winds or extreme temperatures. The main reason deadwooding is performed is safety. Situations that usually demand removal of deadwood include trees that overhang public roads, houses, public areas, power lines, telephone cables and gardens. Trees located in wooded areas are usually assessed as lower risk but assessments consider the number of visitors. Trees adjacent to footpaths and access roads are often considered for deadwood removal.

Another reason for deadwooding is amenity value, i.e. a tree with a large amount of deadwood throughout the crown will look more aesthetically pleasing with the deadwood removed. The physical practice of deadwooding can be carried out most of the year though should be avoided when the tree is coming into leaf. The deadwooding process speeds up the tree&#x27;s natural abscission process. It also reduces unwanted weight and wind resistance and can help overall balance.

=== Preventive structural pruning ===
Preventative and structural pruning can be done to mitigate several issues young trees may have in the future. The structural pruning can reduce tree stress, increase the lifespan of trees, and promotes resistance to damage due to natural weather events. Attributes of trees with good structure include excurrent growth by having a single dominant leader, branch unions without included bark, and a balanced canopy. Structural pruning does this by developing or maintaining a dominant leader, identify the lowest branches in the canopy, prevent branches below the permanent canopy from growing too large, keeping all branches less than one half the trunk diameter, space main branches along one dominant trunk, and suppress growth on branches with included bark. 

=== Subordination pruning ===
Subordination pruning is done on limbs that will exceed 50% percent of the stem diameter. A reduction cut may be performed while still allowing about 50% of the branch. This is done to help maintain form and deter the formation of co-dominant leaders. Temporary branches may be too large for a removal cut so subordination pruning should be done to slowly reduce a limb by 50% each year to allow the tree to properly heal from the cut. As a tree becomes larger the slower it grows. Reducing the larger limbs for eventual removal will allow for the tree to promote new growth rather than using energy in encouraging unwanted limbs to continue to grow. Removing a large branch increases the likelihood of the cut to not heal properly which also may attract insects, diseases and fungus. 

===Crown thinning===
Crown thinning is the removal of live healthy branches which increases light penetration, air circulation and reduces wind resistance which reduces risks from damage and the possibility of pest infestation. 

===Crown raising===
Crown raising involves the removal of the lower branches to a given height. The height is achieved by the removal of whole branches or removing the parts of branches which extend below the desired height. The branches are normally not lifted to more than one third of the tree&#x27;s total height.

Crown lifting is done for access; these being pedestrian, vehicle or space for buildings and street furniture. Lifting the crown will allow traffic and pedestrians to pass underneath safely. This pruning technique is usually used in the urban environment as it is for public safety and aesthetics rather than tree form and timber value.

Crown lifting introduces light to the lower part of the trunk; this, in some species can encourage epicormic growth from dormant buds. To reduce this sometimes smaller branches are left on the lower part of the trunk. Excessive removal of the lower branches can displace the canopy weight, this will make the tree top heavy, therefore adding stress to the tree. When a branch is removed from the trunk, it creates a large wound. This wound is susceptible to disease and decay, and could lead to reduced trunk stability. Therefore, much time and consideration must be taken when choosing the height the crown is to be lifted to.

This would be an inappropriate operation if the tree species’ form was of a shrubby nature. This would therefore remove most of the foliage and would also largely unbalance the tree. This procedure should not be carried out if the tree is in decline, poor health or dead, dying or dangerous (DDD) as the operation will remove some of the photosynthetic area the tree uses. This will increase the decline rate of the tree and could lead to death.

If the tree is of great importance to an area or town, (i.e. veteran or ancient) then an alternative solution to crown lifting would be to move the target or object so it is not in range. For example, diverting a footpath around a tree&#x27;s drip line so the crown lift is not needed. Another solution would be to prop up or cable-brace the low hanging branch. This is a non-invasive solution which in some situations may be more economical and environmentally friendly. 

===Vista pruning===
Selectively pruning a window of view in a tree.

===Crown reduction===
Reducing the height and or spread of a tree by selectively cutting back to smaller branches and in fruit trees for increasing of light interception and enhancing fruit quality.

===Pollarding===
A regular form of pruning where certain deciduous species are pruned back to pollard heads every year in the dormant period. This practice is usually commenced on juvenile trees so they can adapt to the harshness of the practice. This practice can be used for tree shaping but is also used in specific species which young branches can be sold for floral arrangements. 

=== Deadheading ===
Deadheading is the act of removing spent flowers or flowerheads for aesthetics, to prolong bloom for up to several weeks or promote rebloom, or to prevent seeding.

==Time period==
In general, pruning deadwood and small branches can be done at any time of year. Depending on the species, many temperate plants can be pruned either during dormancy in winter, or, for species where winter frost can harm a recently pruned plant, after flowering is completed. In the temperate areas of the northern hemisphere autumn pruning should be avoided, as the spores of disease and decay fungi are abundant at this time of year.

Some woody plants tend to bleed profusely from cuts, such as mesquite and maple. Some callus over slowly, such as magnolia. In this case, they are better pruned during active growth when they can more readily heal. Woody plants that flower early in the season, on spurs that form on wood that has matured the year before, such as apples, should be pruned right after flowering as later pruning will sacrifice flowers the following season. Forsythia, azaleas and lilacs all fall into this category.

<text>Baron O&#x27;Neill, of Shane&#x27;s Castle in the County of Antrim, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1868 for the musical composer The Reverend William O&#x27;Neill. Born William Chichester, he succeeded to the estates of his cousin John Bruce Richard O&#x27;Neill, 3rd Viscount O&#x27;Neill, in 1855 (on whose death the viscountcy and first barony of O&#x27;Neill became extinct) and assumed by royal licence the surname of O&#x27;Neill in lieu of Chichester in order to inherit the lands of his cousin, despite not being descended in the male line from an O&#x27;Neill. The Chichesters trace their lineage to the name O&#x27;Neill through Mary Chichester, daughter of Henry O&#x27;Neill of Shane&#x27;s Castle. Lord O&#x27;Neill was the patrilineal great-great-great-grandson of John Chichester, younger brother of Arthur Chichester, 2nd Earl of Donegall. The latter two were both nephews of Arthur Chichester, 1st Earl of Donegall, and grandsons of Edward Chichester, 1st Viscount Chichester (see the Marquess of Donegall for more information). Lord O&#x27;Neill was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Antrim.

His eldest son and heir apparent, the Hon. Arthur O&#x27;Neill, represented Antrim Mid in the House of Commons as a Conservative from 1910 until 1914, when he was killed in action during the First World War, the first MP to die in the conflict. The second Baron was therefore succeeded by his grandson, Shane O&#x27;Neill, 3rd Baron O&#x27;Neill (the son of the Hon. Arthur O&#x27;Neill). He was killed in action in Italy during the Second World War. The title is currently held by his son, the fourth Baron, who succeeded in 1944. He was Lord Lieutenant of Antrim from 1994 to 2008.

Two other members of the O&#x27;Neill family have been elevated to the peerage. Hugh O&#x27;Neill, 1st Baron Rathcavan, was the youngest son of the second Baron O&#x27;Neill, while Terence O&#x27;Neill, Baron O&#x27;Neill of the Maine, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, was the youngest brother of the third Baron.

The family seat is Shane&#x27;s Castle, near Randalstown, County Antrim.

<text>Mahmoud Mahmoud Atta () (born 1954) is an American and alleged militant from the Palestine Liberation Organization who was suspected to be responsible for bombing a bus in 1986, on the West Bank, killing one and severely injuring three.

==Biography==
A naturalized US citizen, Mahmoud Atta arrived at Simon Bolivar Airport, Venezuela&#x27;s main international airport in June 1987. He was coming from Mexico, and was monitored by the DISIP Venezuelan Counterintelligence Service. Mahmoud Atta was responsible for Abu Nidal clandestine terrorist operations in Central and South America countries. From the airport, Atta took a taxi to the city of Valencia, State of Carabobo, Venezuela, where he had high level Abu Nidal officials contacts.

After 7 days of surveillance and monitoring his calls, the apartment was raided by the DISIP commandos unit, and Atta was arrested, and transferred to Caracas, Venezuela. With all the information collected by the surveillance, Atta was interrogated by the Venezuelan DISIP Counterintelligence Department. 
Venezuelan Counterintelligence officials found a false bottom in his suitcase, finding two false US passports, and letters hand-written by Atta. Addresses, telephone numbers, names, and countries of the Abu Nidal Terrorist Organization were found in the false bottom of his suitcase. Atta was deported by the government of Venezuela to the U.S. and arrested by the FBI. 
After that, Atta was extradited to Israel in 1990, tried and sentenced to life in prison.

==Disappearance==
Following the September 11 attacks in the United States it was initially thought that Mahmoud Mahmoud Atta was one of the hijackers on board the first plane to hit the World Trade Center. This led to the harsh questioning of US immigration authorities and the intelligence community, because it was felt that they had failed to stop a known terrorist from entering the country under his true name. However, his identity was confused with the Egyptian militant leader Mohamed Atta who was actually on board the flight.

Mahmoud Mahmoud Atta&#x27;s current whereabouts are unknown.

<doc id="471383" wikidata="Q915468" url="?curid=471383" title="The Soft Bulletin">
<text>The Soft Bulletin is the ninth studio album by American rock band the Flaming Lips, released by Warner Bros. Records on May 17, 1999, in the United Kingdom, and on June 22, 1999, in the United States. The album was released to widespread acclaim, and was hailed by critics as a departure from their previous guitar-heavy alternative rock sound into a more layered, intricately arranged work.

==Music and lyrics==
The album was considered to mark a change in the course for the band, with more traditional catchy melodies, accessible-sounding music (their previous album &quot;Zaireeka&quot; was a quadruple album of experimental sounds meant to be played on four separate stereo systems simultaneously), and more serious and thoughtful lyrics.

The album was also noted for its fusion of ordinary rock instruments, electronic beats, and synthesizers. Its large, layered, symphonic sound has also earned it a reputation as the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; of the 1990s from a few critics. This sound was achieved in part by detuning and layering multiple MIDI keyboards as opposed to recording a live orchestra.

===Artwork===
The cover artwork of the album is a modified version of a photograph taken by Lawrence Schiller titled &quot;The Acid Test: Neal Cassady&quot;, which according to Schiller, depicts Neal Cassady dancing with his own shadow during an Acid Test conducted by the Merry Pranksters. The original photograph was featured in a 1966 &quot;Life&quot; magazine article on LSD.

==Reception==

&quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; was lauded by critics and fans alike and topped numerous &quot;Best of 1999&quot; lists. The album is now considered by many to be the Flaming Lips&#x27;s masterpiece. &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; is considered by some to be partially responsible for establishing the latter-day identity of the Flaming Lips, and as its following expanded over the years after its release, paving the way to their being among the most well-respected groups of the 2000s.

In 2006, Robert Dimery chose &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; and its follow-up &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; as part of his book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked the album 3rd on the Top 100 albums of the 1990s list, and awarded it a rare score of 10.0. AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Ankeny gave it a highly enthusiastic review, concluding that &quot;there&#x27;s no telling where The Lips will go from here, but it&#x27;s almost beside the point – not just the best album of 1999, &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; might be the best record of the entire decade&quot;.

Since late 2010, the album has been sporadically performed live in its entirety over the years, and on May 26, 2016, an orchestra was used to embellish sounds of the album while the band played their main instruments for the album at the concert.

As of 2002 it had sold 100,000 units in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.

==Track listing==
Upon its release, &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; was subject to record company demands for commercial-sounding music, hence the inclusion of remixes of several songs. In addition, the US (&quot;The Spiderbite Song&quot;) and UK (&quot;Slow Motion&quot;) CDs each contain one track that the other does not.

===US CD release===
The worldwide digital edition uses the US track listing but switches the versions of &quot;Race for the Prize&quot; (track 1 and 13).

===UK and Australian CD release===
===Vinyl release===

==&quot;The Soft Bulletin 5.1&quot;==
On January 31, 2006, Warner Bros. re-released &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; in the US as a two-disc package titled &quot;The Soft Bulletin 5.1&quot;. It includes a remastered CD and a DVD-Audio disc that contains a 5.1-channel surround sound mix of the album.

*The 5.1 package has the UK track list with the remixes at the end removed. They were replaced with &quot;The Spiderbite Song&quot; and the original mix of &quot;Buggin which had previously only seen release on a US promotional CD.
*This package marks the first time that US consumers have been able to get &quot;Slow Motion&quot; on CD, as this had previously only been available on the UK CD and the US vinyl releases.

===Packaging error===
The first pressings of &quot;The Soft Bulletin 5.1&quot; were erroneously shipped with an original US CD instead of the new remastered CD with the revised track list. The band offered to replace the incorrect CD with the new version for anyone who received the wrong CD in their package. In addition, many people who sent their incorrect CDs in for replacement also received a handwritten letter of apology from the band&#x27;s bassist, Michael Ivins. Warner Bros. has since fixed this problem.

<doc id="471385" wikidata="Q141672" url="?curid=471385" title="Impatiens">
<text>Impatiens is a genus of more than 1,000 species of flowering plants, widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere and the tropics. Together with the genus &quot;Hydrocera&quot; (one species), &quot;Impatiens&quot; make up the family Balsaminaceae.

Common names in North America include impatiens, jewelweed, touch-me-not, snapweed and patience. As a rule-of-thumb, &quot;jewelweed&quot; is used exclusively for Nearctic species, and balsam is usually applied to tropical species. In the British Isles by far the most common names are impatiens and busy lizzie, especially for the many varieties, hybrids and cultivars involving &quot;Impatiens walleriana&quot;. &quot;Busy lizzie&quot; is also found in the American literature. &quot;Impatiens glandulifera&quot; is commonly called policeman&#x27;s helmet in the UK, where it is an introduced species.

==Description==

Most &quot;Impatiens&quot; species are herbaceous annuals or perennials with succulent stems. Only a few woody species exist. Plant size varies, from five centimeters to 2.5 meters, depending on the species. Stems often form roots when they come into contact with the soil. The leaves are entire, often dentate or sinuate with extrafloral nectaries. Depending on the species, leaves can be thin to succulent. Particularly on the underside of the leaves, tiny air bubbles are trapped over and under the leaf surface, giving them a silvery sheen that becomes pronounced when they are held underwater.

The zygomorphic flowers of &quot;Impatiens&quot; are protandric (male becoming female with age). The calyx consists of five free sepals, of which one pair is often strongly reduced. The non-paired sepal forms a flower spur-producing nectar. In a group of species from Madagascar, the spur is completely lacking, but they still have three sepals. The crown consists of five petals, of which the lateral pairs are fused. The five stamens are fused and form a cap over the ovary, which falls off after the male phase. After the stamens have fallen off, the female phase starts and the stigma becomes receptive, which reduces self-pollination.

The scientific name &quot;Impatiens&quot; (Latin for &quot;impatient&quot;) and the common name &quot;touch-me-not&quot; refer to the explosive dehiscence of the seed capsules. The mature capsules burst, sending seeds up to several meters away.

==Distribution==
The genus &quot;Impatiens&quot; occurs in Africa, Eurasia and North America. Two species (&quot;Impatiens turrialbana&quot; and &quot;Impatiens mexicana&quot;) occur in isolated areas in Central America (southern Mexico and Costa Rica). Most &quot;Impatiens&quot; species occur in the tropical and subtropical mountain forests in Africa, Madagascar, the Himalayas, the Western Ghats (southwest India) and southeast Asia. In Europe only a single &quot;Impatiens&quot; species (&quot;Impatiens noli-tangere&quot;) occurs naturally. However, several neophytic species exist.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, humans transported the North American orange jewelweed (&quot;I. capensis&quot;) to England, France, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Finland, and potentially other areas of Northern and Central Europe. For example, it was not recorded from Germany as recently as 1996, but since then a population has naturalized in Hagen at the Ennepe River. The orange jewelweed is quite similar to the touch-me-not balsam (&quot;I. noli-tangere&quot;), the only &quot;Impatiens&quot; species native to Central and Northern Europe, and it utilizes similar habitats, but no evidence exists of natural hybrids between them. Small balsam (&quot;I. parviflora&quot;), originally native to southern Central Asia, is even more extensively naturalized in Europe. More problematic is the Himalayan balsam (&quot;I. glandulifera&quot;), a densely growing species which displaces smaller plants by denying them sunlight. It is an invasive weed in many places, and tends to dominate riparian vegetation along polluted rivers and nitrogen-rich spots. Thus, it exacerbates ecosystem degradation by forming stands where few other plants can grow, and by rendering riverbanks more prone to erosion, as it has only a shallow root system.

==Ecology==
Most &quot;Impatiens&quot; species are perennial herbs. However, several annual species exist, especially in the temperate regions as well as in the Himalayas. A few &quot;Impatiens&quot; species in southeast Asia (e.g. &quot;Impatiens kerriae&quot; or &quot;Impatiens mirabilis&quot;) form shrubs or small trees up to three meters tall. Most &quot;Impatiens&quot; species occur in forests, especially along streams and paths or at the forest edge with a little bit of sunlight. Additionally, a few species occur in open landscapes, such as heathland, river banks or savanna.

The genus &quot;Impatiens&quot; is characterized by a large variety of flower architectures. Traditionally two flower types are differentiated: one with a sacculate spur and a more or less two-lipped flower and a second with a filiform spur and a flat flower surface. However, several transition forms exist. Additionally, a group of 125 spur-less species exist on Madagascar, forming a third main flower type. Due to the large variability in flower architecture it seems reasonable to group the species by their main pollinators: such as bees and bumblebees, butterflies, moths, flies, and sunbirds. Further, a few cleistogamous species exist. However, most species are dependent on pollinator activity for efficient seed production but many of them are self-compatible. Most temperate species as well as some tropical species can switch from chasmogamous (pollinator-dependent) to cleistogamous (seed production within closed flowers) flowers when nutrient and light conditions become adverse.

&quot;Impatiens&quot; foliage is used for food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, such as the dot moth (&quot;Melanchra persicariae&quot;), as well as other insects, such as the Japanese beetle (&quot;Popillia japonica&quot;). The leaves are toxic to many other animals, including the budgerigar (&quot;Melopsittacus undulatus&quot;), but the bird will readily eat the flowers. The flowers are also visited by bumblebees and certain Lepidoptera, such as the common spotted flat (&quot;Celaenorrhinus leucocera&quot;).

Parasitic plants that use impatiens as hosts include the European dodder (&quot;Cuscuta europaea&quot;). A number of plant diseases affect this genus.
The starkly differing flower shapes found in this genus, combined with the easy cultivation of many species, have served to make some balsam species model organisms in plant evolutionary developmental biology. Also, &quot;Impatiens&quot; is rather closely related to the carnivorous plant families Roridulaceae and Sarraceniaceae. Peculiar stalked glands found on balsam sepals secrete mucus and might be related to the structures from which the prey-catching and -digesting glands of these carnivorous plants evolved. Balsams are not known to be protocarnivorous plants, however.

In 2011–2013, the United States experienced a significant outbreak of the fungal disease downy mildew that affects impatiens, particularly &quot;Impatiens walleriana&quot;. The disease was also reported in Canada as well. The pathogen &quot;plasmopara obducens&quot; is the chief culprit suspected by scientists, but &quot;Bremiella sphaerosperma&quot; is related. These pathogens were first reported in the United States in 2004.

== Medicinal uses and phytochemistry ==
Impatiens contain 2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, an anti-inflammatory and fungicide naphthoquinone that is an active ingredient in some formulations of Preparation H.

North American impatiens have been used as herbal remedies for the treatment of bee stings, insect bites, and stinging nettle (&quot;Urtica dioica&quot;) rashes. They are also used after poison ivy (&quot;Toxicodendron radicans&quot;) contact to prevent a rash from developing. The efficacy of orange jewelweed (&quot;I. capensis&quot;) and yellow jewelweed (&quot;I. pallida&quot;) in preventing poison ivy contact dermatitis has been studied, with conflicting results. A study in 1958 found that &quot;Impatiens biflora&quot; was an effective alternative to standard treatment for dermatitis caused by contact with sumac, while later studies found that the species had no antipruritic effects after the rash has developed. Researchers reviewing these contradictions state that potential reason for these conflicts include the method of preparation and timing of application. A 2012 study found that while an extract of orange jewelweed and garden jewelweed (&quot;I. balsamina&quot;) was not effective in reducing contact dermatitis, a mash of the plants applied topically decreased it.

&quot;Impatiens glandulifera&quot; is one of the Bach flower remedies, flower extracts used as herbal remedies for physical and emotional problems. It is included in the &quot;Rescue Remedy&quot; or &quot;Five Flower Remedy&quot;, a potion touted as a treatment for acute anxiety and which is supposed to be protective in stressful situations. Studies have found no difference between the effect of the potion and that of a placebo.

All &quot;Impatiens&quot; taste bitter and seem to be slightly toxic upon ingestion, causing intestinal ailments like vomiting and diarrhea. The toxic compounds have not been identified but are probably the same as those responsible for the bitter taste, likely might be glycosides or alkaloids.
α-Parinaric acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid discovered in the seeds of the makita tree (&quot;Atuna racemosa subsp. racemosa&quot;), is together with linolenic acid the predominant component of the seed fat of garden jewelweed (&quot;I. balsamina&quot;), and perhaps other species of &quot;Impatiens&quot;. This is interesting from a phylogenetic perspective, because the makita tree is a member of the Chrysobalanaceae in a lineage of eudicots entirely distinct from the balsams.

Certain jewelweeds, including the garden jewelweed contain the naphthoquinone lawsone, a dye that is also found in henna (&quot;Lawsonia inermis&quot;) and is also the hair coloring and skin coloring agent in mehndi. In ancient China, &quot;Impatiens&quot; petals mashed with rose and orchid petals and alum were used as nail polish: leaving the mixture on the nails for some hours colored them pink or reddish.

==Cultivation==

Impatiens are popular garden annuals. Hybrids, typically derived from busy lizzie (&quot;I. walleriana&quot;) and New Guinea impatiens (&quot;I. hawkeri&quot;), have commercial importance as garden plants. &quot;I. walleriana&quot; is native to East Africa, and yielded &#x27;Elfin&#x27; series of cultivars, which was subsequently improved as the &#x27;Super Elfin&#x27; series. Double-flowered cultivars also exist.
Other &quot;Impatiens&quot; species, such as African queen (&quot;I. auricoma&quot;), garden jewelweed (&quot;I. balsamina&quot;), blue diamond impatiens (&quot;I. namchabarwensis&quot;), parrot flower (&quot;I. psittacina&quot;), Congo cockatoo (&quot;I. niamniamensis&quot;), Ceylon balsam (&quot;I. repens&quot;), and poor man&#x27;s rhododendron (&quot;I. sodenii&quot;), are also used as ornamental plants.

<text>The &#x27; (EGA&quot;&quot;&#x27;; from French: &quot;Elements of Algebraic Geometry&quot;) by Alexander Grothendieck (assisted by Jean Dieudonné) is a rigorous treatise on algebraic geometry that was published (in eight parts or fascicles) from 1960 through 1967 by the . In it, Grothendieck established systematic foundations of algebraic geometry, building upon the concept of schemes, which he defined. The work is now considered the foundation and basic reference of modern algebraic geometry.

==Editions==
Initially thirteen chapters were planned, but only the first four (making a total of approximately 1500 pages) were published. Much of the material which would have been found in the following chapters can be found, in a less polished form, in the &quot;Séminaire de géométrie algébrique&quot; (known as &quot;SGA&quot;). Indeed, as explained by Grothendieck in the preface of the published version of &quot;SGA&quot;, by 1970 it had become clear that incorporating all of the planned material in &quot;EGA&quot; would require significant changes in the earlier chapters already published, and that therefore the prospects of completing &quot;EGA&quot; in the near term were limited. An obvious example is provided by derived categories, which became an indispensable tool in the later &quot;SGA&quot; volumes, but was not yet used in &quot;EGA III&quot; as the theory was not yet developed at the time. Considerable effort was therefore spent to bring the published &quot;SGA&quot; volumes to a high degree of completeness and rigour. Before work on the treatise was abandoned, there were plans in 1966–67 to expand the group of authors to include Grothendieck&#x27;s students Pierre Deligne and Michel Raynaud, as evidenced by published correspondence between Grothendieck and David Mumford. Grothendieck&#x27;s letter of 4 November 1966 to Mumford also indicates that the second-edition revised structure was in place by that time, with Chapter VIII already intended to cover the Picard scheme. In that letter he estimated that at the pace of writing up to that point, the following four chapters (V to VIII) would have taken eight years to complete, indicating an intended length comparable to the first four chapters, which had been in preparation for about eight years at the time.

Grothendieck nevertheless wrote a revised version of &quot;EGA I&quot; which was published by Springer-Verlag. It updates the terminology, replacing &quot;prescheme&quot; by &quot;scheme&quot; and &quot;scheme&quot; by &quot;separated scheme&quot;, and heavily emphasizes the use of representable functors. The new preface of the second edition also includes a slightly revised plan of the complete treatise, now divided into twelve chapters.

Grothendieck&#x27;s &quot;EGA V&quot; which deals with Bertini type theorems is to some extent available from the Grothendieck Circle website. &quot;Monografie Matematyczne&quot; in Poland has accepted this volume for publication, but the editing process is quite slow (as of 2010).
James Milne has preserved some of the original Grothendieck notes and a translation of them into English. They may be available from his websites connected with the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

==Chapters==
The following table lays out the original and revised plan of the treatise and indicates where (in &quot;SGA&quot; or elsewhere) the topics intended for the later, unpublished chapters were treated by Grothendieck and his collaborators.

In addition to the actual chapters, an extensive &quot;Chapter 0&quot; on various preliminaries was divided between the volumes in which the treatise appeared. Topics treated range from category theory, sheaf theory and general topology to commutative algebra and homological algebra. The longest part of Chapter 0, attached to Chapter IV, is more than 200 pages.

Grothendieck never gave permission for the 2nd edition of &quot;EGA I&quot; to be republished, so copies are rare but found in many libraries. The work on &quot;EGA&quot; was finally disrupted by Grothendieck&#x27;s departure first from IHÉS in 1970 and soon afterwards from the mathematical establishment altogether. Grothendieck&#x27;s incomplete notes on &quot;EGA V&quot; can be found at Grothendieck Circle.

In historical terms, the development of the &quot;EGA&quot; approach set the seal on the application of sheaf theory to algebraic geometry, set in motion by Serre&#x27;s basic paper &quot;FAC&quot;. It also contained the first complete exposition of the algebraic approach to differential calculus, via principal parts. The foundational unification it proposed (see for example unifying theories in mathematics) has stood the test of time.

&quot;EGA&quot; has been scanned by NUMDAM and is available at their website under &quot;Publications mathématiques de l&#x27;IHÉS&quot;, volumes 4 (EGAI), 8 (EGAII), 11 (EGAIII.1re), 17 (EGAIII.2e), 20 (EGAIV.1re), 24 (EGAIV.2e), 28 (EGAIV.3e) and 32 (EGAIV.4e).

<text>Dan Geer is a computer security analyst and risk management specialist. He is recognized for raising awareness of critical computer and network security issues before the risks were widely understood, and for ground-breaking work on the economics of security.

== Career ==
Geer is currently the chief information security officer for In-Q-Tel, a not-for-profit venture capital firm that invests in technology to support the Central Intelligence Agency.

In 2003, Geer&#x27;s 24-page report entitled &quot;Cyber&quot;In&quot;security: The Cost of Monopoly&quot; was released by the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA). The paper argued that Microsoft&#x27;s dominance of desktop computer operating systems is a threat to national security. Geer was fired (from consultancy @Stake) the day the report was made public. Geer has cited subsequent changes in the Vista operating system (notably a location-randomization feature) as evidence that Microsoft &quot;accepted the paper.&quot;

Geer received a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT, where he was a member of the Theta Deuteron charge of Theta Delta Chi fraternity. He also received a Sc.D. in biostatistics from Harvard, and has worked for:

* Health Sciences Computing Facility, Harvard School of Public Health
* Project Athena, MIT
* Digital Equipment Corporation
* Geer Zolot &amp; Associates
* OpenVision Technologies
* Open Market
* Certco
* @stake (acquired by Symantec in November 2004)
* Verdasys

In 2011, Geer received the USENIX Lifetime Achievement Award.

<text>Harry George Hawker, MBE, AFC (22 January 1889 – 12 July 1921) was an Australian aviation pioneer. He was the chief test pilot for Sopwith and was also involved in the design of many of their aircraft. After the First World War, he co-founded Hawker Aircraft, the firm that would later be responsible for a long series of successful military aircraft. He died on 12 July 1921 when the aircraft he was to fly in the Aerial Derby crashed in a park at Burnt Oak, Edgware, not far from Hendon Aerodrome.

==Early life==
Hawker was born on 22 January 1889 at Moorabbin, Victoria in Australia, the second son of George Hawker, a blacksmith, and Mary Ann Gilliard Anderson. He attended Moorabbin Primary School. As an 11-year-old, he worked at the Melbourne garage of Hall &amp; Warden, helping to build engines for five shillings a week, moving on to the Tarrant Motor &amp; Engineering Co, helping make Tarrant cars, where he qualified as a mechanic. In 1907, he moved again to become the chauffeur and mechanic for Ernest De Little in Caramut, Western Victoria. In 1910 he travelled to Diggers Rest, north-west of Melbourne, to see the first public demonstrations of powered flight made in Australia, and decided to go to England to become involved in aviation, arriving in May 1911.

On 14 November 1917, Hawker married Muriel Alice Peaty at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Ealing.

==Aviation career==
In England, Hawker obtained a job with the Commer Car Company, moving to the Mercedes company in January 1912 and then to Austro Daimler. During this time he spent much of his spare time at Brooklands, then the hub of British aviation, and in June 1912 he got a job as a mechanic for the Sopwith Aviation Company.

He soon persuaded Sopwith to teach him to fly, and succeeded in making his first solo flight after only three lessons. He was awarded his Royal Aero Club pilot&#x27;s licence, No. 297, in September 1912 and shortly afterwards, on 24 October, he won the Michelin Cup for flight endurance with a flight lasting 8 hr 23 min.
He also appears to have been the first person to perform an intentional spin and recovery, demonstrating in 1914 one method (though generally not the one used today) to return to level flight from this unusual attitude. Because spins had killed several pilots, this was a major advance in aviation safety.

Having established his name as an aviator, he became chief test pilot for Tom Sopwith. At Sopwiths in 1916, Hawker had the personal use of a small aircraft, the Sopwith Bee. He was also a regular competitor in motor car and motorcycle races at Brooklands before and after the First World War. Among his competitive achievements were a number of altitude records set in June 1913 He also won a £1,000 consolation prize in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; Circuit of Britain Waterplane Race on 25 August 1913.

===Brief return to Australia===
In 1914, Harry Hawker returned to Australia to demonstrate the advanced Sopwith Tabloid, which he had helped design. A wild crowd nearly wrecked the plane on one occasion, and he further damaged it during stunt flying. On his return to England, he continued designing and testing aircraft with Sopwith throughout the First World War.

===Attempt at first transatlantic flight===

After the war, together with navigator Kenneth Mackenzie Grieve, he attempted to win the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; £10,000 prize for the first flight across the Atlantic in &quot;72 consecutive hours&quot;. On 18 May 1919, they set off from Mount Pearl, Newfoundland, in the Sopwith Atlantic biplane. After fourteen and a half hours of flight, the engine overheated and they were forced to change course to intercept the shipping lanes, where they were able to locate a passing freighter, the Danish &quot;Mary&quot;. The &quot;Mary&quot; did not have a functioning radio, so that it was not until six days later, when the steamer reached Butt of Lewis, Scotland, that word was received that they were safe. Hawker and Grieve were awarded a consolation prize of £5,000 by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. Hawker later named his second daughter Mary after the ship that had rescued him and Grieve.

The &quot;Atlantic&quot; was found afloat and recovered by the US steamer &quot;Lake Charleville&quot;. The wheels from the undercarriage, jettisoned soon after takeoff were later recovered by local fishermen and later donated to the Rooms Provincial Museum in St John&#x27;s. One wheel is currently on display at Admiralty House Communications Museum in Mount Pearl.

===A new beginning===
In September 1920, Sopwith Aviation was liquidated because of fears the government would examine the wartime aircraft production contracts of companies like Sopwith and impose a crippling retrospective tax liability on them.

Harry Hawker, Tom Sopwith, Fred Sigrist, and Bill Eyre then formed a new company, each contributing £5,000. To avoid any possible claims against the new company for the wartime contracts of the old company, they chose to call it H.G. Hawker Engineering. (It was renamed Hawker Aircraft in 1933.) As Tom Sopwith put it: to avoid any muddle if we had gone on building aeroplanes and called them Sopwiths—there was bound to be a muddle somewhere—we called the company the Hawker Company. I didn&#x27;t mind. He was largely responsible for our growth during the war.

==Death==
Hawker was killed on 12 July 1921 when his Nieuport Goshawk crashed while he was climbing away from Hendon Aerodrome while practising for the Aerial Derby. &quot;Medical examination led physicians to believe that Hawker had suffered a haemorrhage and that he had tried to get back down on the ground.&quot; Fire in the air and spinal tuberculosis were considered contributing factors to his death.

&quot;The king sent a message of condolence, asserting &#x27;The nation had lost one of its most distinguished airmen.&#x27;&quot;

Hawker is buried in St Pauls&#x27; Church, Hook, Chessington, Surrey. He was survived by his wife, Muriel, and two daughters.

==Honours==
In 1978, he was honoured with a postage stamp depicting his portrait issued by Australia Post. In addition five hundred commemorative First Day Covers were printed, many of which were purchased by the families of children attending the Moorabbin School.

In 1989, Moorabbin Airport at Mentone in Australia was renamed &quot;Moorabbin (Harry Hawker) Airport&quot;

In 2007, Kingston University London named the extension to their Roehampton Vale Campus the &quot;Hawker Wing&quot;.

Moorabbin Primary School has named one of the school houses Hawker House in his honour.

<doc id="471397" wikidata="Q314799" url="?curid=471397" title="Antonio Soler">
<text>Antonio Francisco Javier José Soler Ramos, usually known as Padre (&#x27;Father&#x27;, in the religious sense) Antonio Soler, known in Catalan as Antoni Soler i Ramos (baptized 3 December 1729 – died 20 December 1783) was a Spanish composer whose works span the late Baroque and early Classical music eras. He is best known for his many mostly one-movement keyboard sonatas.

==Early life and training==
Soler was born in Olot (Catalonia, Spain) in the County of Besalú. In 1736, when he was six, he entered the Escolania of the Monastery of Montserrat where he studied music with the resident &quot;mestre&quot; Benet Esteve and organist Benet Valls. In 1746, when he was only 17, he was appointed Director of Music in Lleida, and some sources say he also exercised that position at La Seu d&#x27;Urgell. In 1752, when he was 23, he moved to Castile, having been admitted to the Monastery of San Lorenzo del Escorial for his talents as a composer and organist. His fame soon led Domenico Scarlatti and José de Nebra to accept him as a student, completing his high-level training there.

== Life at El Escorial Monastery and Royal Court ==
Soler entered the monastery as a novice in 1752, at the age of 23, and took holy orders a year later, embarking on a busy routine as a Hieronymite at El Escorial (near Madrid). There he studied under José de Nebra and (according to some sources) Domenico Scarlatti, before teaching in his own right. He was appointed music teacher for the Infantes Antonio and Gabriel, sons of Carlos III.

While there, he was known to have 20-hour workdays, in the course of which he produced more than 500 compositions. Among these were around 150 keyboard sonatas, many believed to have been written for his pupil, the Infante Don Gabriel, a son of King Carlos III. Other pieces include Christmas &quot;villancicos&quot; and Catholic liturgical music, including Masses. He died in the monastery of San Lorenzo del Escorial.

==Compositions==
Padre Soler&#x27;s most celebrated works are his keyboard sonatas, which are comparable to those composed by Domenico Scarlatti (with whom he may have studied) but are more varied in form than those of Scarlatti, with some pieces in three or four movements; Scarlatti&#x27;s pieces are in one (mostly) or two movements. Soler&#x27;s sonatas were cataloged in the early twentieth century by Fr. Samuel Rubio and so all have &#x27;R&#x27; numbers assigned.

Soler also composed concertos, quintets for organ and strings, motets, masses and pieces for solo organ. He also wrote a treatise, &quot;Llave de la modulación&quot; (&quot;The Key to Modulation&quot;, 1762).

Soler&#x27;s &quot;Six Concertos for Two Organs&quot; are still very much in the repertoire and have often been recorded. A fandango authored by Soler, and probably more often performed than any other work of his, is claimed by Isidro Barrio and some others to be of doubtful authorship.

<text>The Marcels were an American doo-wop group known for turning popular music songs into rock and roll. The group formed in 1959 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and signed to Colpix Records with lead Cornelius Harp, bass Fred Johnson, Gene Bricker, Ron Mundy, and Richard Knauss. The group was named after a popular hair style of the day, the marcel wave, by Fred Johnson&#x27;s younger sister Priscilla.

==Career==
In 1961, the Marcels released a doo-wop cover of the ballad &quot;Blue Moon&quot; that began with the bass singer singing, &quot;bomp-baba-bomp-ba-bomp-ba-bomp-bomp... vedanga-dang-dang-vadinga-dong-ding...&quot;. The record sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. It is featured in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.

The disc went to number one in the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and UK Singles Chart. In the US, additional revivals in the same vein as &quot;Blue Moon&quot;—&quot;Heartaches&quot; and &quot;My Melancholy Baby&quot;—were less successful, although &quot;Heartaches&quot; peaked at No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and eventually sold over one million copies worldwide.

The introduction to &quot;Blue Moon&quot; was an excerpt of an original song that the group had in its act, a cover of &quot;Zoom&quot; by the Cadillacs. Colpix A&amp;R director Stu Phillips transferred the introduction to &quot;Blue Moon&quot; to give the song additional flair. The Marcels recorded &quot;Blue Moon&quot; in two takes. A promotion man asked for and got a copy of the finished tape, which found its way to DJ Murray the K. He promoted it as an &quot;exclusive&quot; and reportedly played it 26 times on one show.

In August 1961, due to racial problems encountered while touring in the Deep South because of the group being multi-racial, Knauss and Bricker and Daniel Mercado left and were replaced by Allen Johnson (brother of Fred) and Walt Maddox and Mundy. In 1962, Harp and Allen Johnson left and were replaced by Richard Harris and William Herndon. There was a brief reunion of the original members in 1973. The group made several recordings in 1975 with Harp back on lead. Original member Gene Bricker died on December 10, 1983. Allen Johnson died of cancer on September 28, 1995, at age 55.
By the early 1990s, the group included Johnson, Maddox, Harris, Jules Hopson, and Richard Merritt. The group split around 1995. Fred Johnson formed his own group with new members, while the other four members recruited new bassist Ted Smith. Maddox won a lawsuit against Sunny James Cvetnic, the manager of Johnson&#x27;s group, for trademark infringement in 1996. Johnson reunited with Harp, Mundy and Knauss in 1999 for the PBS special &quot;Doo Wop 50&quot;.

The Marcels were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002.

Original lead singer Cornelius &quot;Nini&quot; Harp died on June 4, 2013, at the age of 73.

Ronald &quot;Bingo&quot; Mundy (born on April 20, 1940) died of pneumonia on January 20, 2017, at the age of 76.

Fred Johnson died March 31, 2022, aged 80.

==Filmography==
* &quot;Twist Around the Clock&quot; (1961)
The Marcels&#x27; popularity in 1961 was so great that they were included in the Oscar Rudolph film &quot;Twist Around the Clock&quot;.
Released on December 30, 1961, with the tagline &quot;It&#x27;s Twist-eriffic! The first full-length movie about the Twist!&quot; the film also showcased fellow artists Chubby Checker, Dion DiMucci, Vicki Spencer and singer-songwriter and TV show host turned actor Clay Cole. Allen Johnson, Gene Bricker, Cornelius Harp, Fred Johnson, Richard Knauss and Ronald Mundy of The Marcels were all included—and had speaking parts in addition to performing musical numbers. They sing &quot;Merry Twist-Mas&quot;, which was released over Christmas 1961, though no chart action ensued.
* &quot;Bikini Beach&quot; (1964)
This Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon movie, about a millionaire who sets out to prove his theory that his pet chimpanzee is as intelligent as the teenagers who hang out on the local beach where he is intending to build a retirement home but ends in hilarious results, also included two of The Marcels, Gene Bricker and Cornelius Harp. They provided backing vocals for two songs, Avalon&#x27;s &quot;Gimme Your Love Yeah Yeah Yeah&quot; and Little Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;(Happy Feelin&#x27;) Dance And Shout&quot;.

<doc id="471403" wikidata="Q19270" url="?curid=471403" title="Celebes Sea">
<text>The Celebes Sea ( ; ) or Sulawesi Sea (; ) of the western Pacific Ocean is bordered on the north by the Sulu Archipelago and Sulu Sea and Mindanao Island of the Philippines, on the east by the Sangihe Islands chain, on the south by Sulawesi&#x27;s Minahasa Peninsula, and the west by northern Kalimantan in Indonesia. It extends 420 miles (675 km) north-south by east-west and has a total surface area of , to a maximum depth of . South of the Cape Mangkalihat, the sea opens southwest through the Makassar Strait into the Java Sea.

The Celebes Sea is a piece of an ancient ocean basin that formed 42 million years ago in a locale removed from any landmass. By 20 million years ago, the earth&#x27;s crust movement had moved the basin close enough to the Indonesian and Philippine volcanoes to receive emitted debris. By 10 million years ago the Celebes Sea was inundated with continental debris, including coal, which was shed from a growing young mountain on Borneo and the basin had docked against Eurasia.

The border between the Celebes and the Sulu Sea is at the Sibutu-Basilan Ridge. Strong ocean currents, deep sea trenches, and seamounts, combined with active volcanic islands, result in complex oceanographic features.

==Delimitation of the Exclusive Economic Zone boundary==
On 23 May 2013, the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia signed an agreement to establish the boundary line that delimits the overlapping Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) between the two countries. It has been agreed that north of the boundary line will be under the jurisdiction of the Philippines (named Mindanao Sea) and Indonesia be south of the boundary line (named &quot;Celebes Sea&quot;).

==Extent==
The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defines the Celebes Sea as being one of the waters of the East Indian Archipelago. The IHO defines its limits as follows:

&quot;On the North.&quot; The Southern limit of Sulu Sea [From Tagolo Point, down the West coast of Mindanao to the Southwest extremity thence to the North coast of Basilan Island (), through this island to its Southern extremity, thence a line to Bitinan Island () off the Eastern end of Jolo Island, through Jolo to a point in long. 121°04&#x27;E on its South coast, thence through Tapul and Lugus Islands and along the North coast of Tawitawi Island to Bongao Island off its Western end (), and from thence to Tanjong Labian, the Northeastern extreme of Borneo] and the Southwest coast of Mindanao.

&quot;On the East.&quot; A line from Tinaca Point, the Southern point of Mindanao, to the North point of Pulau Sangihe Besar () thence through the pulau-pulau Sangihe to Tanjung Puisan, the Northeast extreme of Celebes [Sulawesi].

&quot;On the South.&quot; The North coast of Celebes between tanjung Puisan and tanjung Binar (Cape Rivers) () and thence a line to Tanjung Mangkalihat in Borneo, the Northern limit of Makassar Strait [a line joining Tanjung Mangkalihat, Borneo () and tanjung Binar (Cape Rivers), Celebes ()].

&quot;On the West.&quot; The East coast of Borneo is between Tanjung Mangkalihat and Tanjong Labian, the Southern limit of the Sulu Sea.
== Marine life ==

The Celebes Sea is home to a wide variety of fish and aquatic creatures. The tropical setting and warm clear waters permit it to harbor about 580 of the world&#x27;s 793 species of reef-building corals, which grow as some of the most bio-diverse coral reefs in the world, and an impressive array of marine life, including whales and dolphins, sea turtles, manta rays, eagle rays, barracuda, marlin and other reef and pelagic species. Tuna and yellowfin tuna are also abundant. In addition to the high abundance of fish caught in the Celebes Sea, this sea also yields other aquatic products like sea tang.

== Commercial significance ==
The Celebes Sea is an important sea route for regional trade. The sea is also popular for scuba diving and luxury ocean cruising.

== Geology ==
The Celebes Sea is underlain by an oceanic plate with a mid-oceanic spreading in the center part. This plate is subducted to the south and north. Several seismic surveys and research drillings were done in this area to gather geological information.

<doc id="471406" wikidata="Q1583411" url="?curid=471406" title="Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771">
<text>Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Los Angeles, California, to San Francisco. On December 7, 1987, the British Aerospace 146-200A, registration N350PS, crashed in San Luis Obispo County near Cayucos, after being hijacked by a passenger.

All 43 passengers and crew aboard the plane died, five of whom, including the two pilots, were presumably shot dead before the plane crashed. The perpetrator, David Burke, was a disgruntled former employee of USAir, the parent company of Pacific Southwest Airlines. The crash was the second-worst mass murder in Californian history, after the similar crash of Pacific Air Lines Flight 773 in 1964. It was the second fatal crash of PSA, after Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 182.

== Aircraft and crew ==
The aircraft involved was a British Aerospace 146-200A. The aircraft was powered by four Lycoming ALF502R-3 turbofan engines.

The flight crew consisted of Captain Gregg Lindamood (43) and First Officer James Howard Nunn (48), who had been working for the airline since 1973 and March 1987 respectively. Captain Lindamood had 11,000 flight hours, with 1,500 of them on the BAe-146. First Officer Nunn had 12,000 flight hours, but only 300 of them were on the BAe-146. There were three flight attendants on board: Debbie Nissen Neil (37), Debra Watterson Vuylsteke (32), and Julie Gottesman (20), employed by the airline in 1970, 1977, and 1987 respectively.

== Incident ==

USAir, which had recently purchased Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA), terminated David A. Burke, a ticketing agent, for petty theft of $70 from in-flight cocktail receipts; he had also been suspected of involvement with a narcotics ring. After meeting with Ray Thomson, his manager, in an unsuccessful attempt to be reinstated, Burke purchased a ticket on PSA Flight 1771, a daily flight from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to San Francisco International Airport (SFO). Thomson was a passenger on the flight, which he regularly took for his daily commute from his workplace at LAX to his home in the San Francisco Bay Area. Flight 1771 departed from LAX at 15:31 PST, scheduled to arrive in San Francisco at 16:43.

Using USAir employee credentials that he had not yet surrendered, Burke, armed with a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29 .44 Magnum revolver that he had borrowed from a coworker, was able to bypass the normal passenger security checkpoint at LAX. He gained access to the plane via the locked crew door using the access code scratched above the lock as reported by one of the lawyers representing families of two dead passengers. After boarding the plane, Burke wrote a message on an airsickness bag, but whether or not he gave the message to Thomson to read before shooting him is unknown. The note read:

Hi Ray. I think it&#x27;s sort of ironical that we end up like this. I asked for some leniency for my family. Remember? Well, I got none and you&#x27;ll get none.

The exact sequence of events remains undetermined, though some details were able to be determined based on information from the aircraft&#x27;s cockpit voice recorder (CVR). Due to the poor quality of the recording, it was not possible to decipher everything spoken in the cockpit, nor was it possible to positively attribute phrases to specific individuals. First, the sound of the lavatory door opening was heard. It is speculated that this was Burke entering to load the gun and giving Thomson time to read the note. As the aircraft, a four-engined British Aerospace BAe 146-200, cruised at over the central California coast, the CVR recorded either Captain Lindamood or First Officer Nunn asking air traffic control about reports of turbulence. During the controller&#x27;s reply, the CVR picked up two &quot;high-level gunshot-like sound[s]&quot;. Burke had likely shot Thomson at this time. One of the pilots reported twice to the center controller that there had been gunshots fired aboard the aircraft. As the controller asked the pilots whether they wished to divert to Monterey, the sound of the cockpit door opening could be heard, followed by the sound of a female voice, believed to be Flight Attendant Neil. What was said by her could not be discerned, aside from the word &quot;captain&quot;. This was followed one second later by a male voice saying something that was mostly unintelligible on the recording but ended with the word &quot;problem.&quot; The FBI&#x27;s transcript notes that this may have been Burke&#x27;s voice. Although it is popularly believed that the complete phrase spoken by Burke had been &quot;I&#x27;m the problem,&quot; this does not appear in the official FBI report. Immediately following this exchange, two more gunshot sounds were registered, followed by another gunshot six seconds later.

Burke shot Neil, Lindamood, and Nunn, incapacitating them, if not killing them. Fifteen seconds later, the CVR picked up the sound of the cockpit door either opening or closing, as well as increasing windscreen noise as the airplane pitched down and accelerated, indicating that either Burke pushed the control column down and forced the plane into a dive or the Captain or First Officer were slumped against it. Thirty-two seconds after the sounds made by the cockpit door, a sixth and final gunshot was heard. All that could be determined was that this shot occurred in the passenger cabin. Some speculation arose that Burke shot himself, though this seems unlikely because a fragment of Burke&#x27;s fingertip was lodged in the trigger when the investigators found the revolver. This indicated that he was alive and was holding the gun until the moment of impact. The most probable victim was an off-duty pilot that was working for PSA, Douglas Arthur, who was likely trying to enter the cockpit in an attempt to get the plane out of the dive. For the remainder of the recording, the sound of windscreen noise and &quot;distant voices&quot; could be heard.

At 4:16 pm, the plane crashed into a hillside on the Santa Rita cattle ranch in the Santa Lucia Mountains between Paso Robles and Cayucos. The plane was estimated to have crashed slightly faster than the speed of sound, around , disintegrating instantly. Based on the deformation of the titanium black box data recorder case, the aircraft experienced a deceleration of when it hit the ground. It was traveling around a 70° angle toward the south. The plane struck a rocky hillside, leaving a crater less than deep and across. Only 11 of the passengers were ever identified.

Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Bureau of Investigation determined that Burke was responsible for the crash, based on the discovery of parts of a handgun containing 6 spent cartridge cases and a note written by Burke on an airsickness bag. Other evidence connected Burke to the flight, such as an answering machine message he had left for his estranged girlfriend, and part of his body that was recovered from the crash site.

== David A. Burke ==

David Augustus Burke (18 May 1952 – 7 December 1987) was born in Croydon, England, to Jamaican parents. Burke later emigrated to the United States with his parents. He had previously worked for USAir in Rochester, New York, where he was a suspect in a drug-smuggling ring that was bringing cocaine from Jamaica to Rochester via the airline. Never officially charged, he reportedly relocated to Los Angeles to avoid future suspicions. Some former girlfriends, neighbors, and law enforcement officials described him as a violent man before the events of Flight 1771. He had seven children from four women, but never married.

== Aftermath ==
Several federal laws were passed after the crash, including a law that required &quot;immediate seizure of all airline and airport employee credentials&quot; after an employee&#x27;s termination, resignation or retirement from an airline or airport position. A policy was also implemented stipulating that all airline flight crew and airport employees were to be subject to the same security measures as airline passengers.

The crash killed the president of Chevron USA, James Sylla, along with three of the company&#x27;s public-affairs executives. Also killed were three officials of Pacific Bell, prompting many large corporations to create policies to forbid travel by multiple executives on the same flight.

In the &quot;Garden of Hope&quot; section of the Los Osos Valley Memorial Park, a granite and bronze marker honors the 42 victims of Flight 1771, and a number of the passengers and crew are buried in that cemetery.

== Dramatization ==

An episode of the Canadian documentary TV series &quot;Mayday: Air Disasters&quot; titled &quot;I&#x27;m the Problem&quot; (&quot;Murder on Board&quot; for UK broadcasts) on Smithsonian Channel, chronicled the events of Flight 1771 and its ensuing investigation.

The incident and aftermath were featured in episode 113 of the Rooster Teeth podcast &quot;Black Box Down&quot;.

<doc id="471414" wikidata="Q3141413" url="?curid=471414" title="Ilex cassine">
<text>Ilex cassine is a holly native to the southeastern coast of North America that grows from Virginia to the Colorado River in Texas, with subspecies growing southward on the Gulf Coast as far as Veracruz, Mexico, and in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Bahamas in the Caribbean. It is commonly known as dahoon holly or cassena, the latter derived from the Timucua name for &quot;I. vomitoria&quot;.

It is a large shrub or small tree growing to . The leaves are evergreen, 6–15 cm long and 2–4 cm broad, glossy dark green, entire or with a few small spines near the apex of the leaf. The flowers are white, with a four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a red drupe, 5–6 mm in diameter, containing four seeds.

As with other hollies, it is dioecious with separate male and female plants. Only the females have berries, and a male pollenizer must be within range for bees to pollinate them.

==Varieties==
There are three varieties:
*&quot;Ilex cassine&quot; var. &quot;cassine&quot; (United States, Caribbean)
*&quot;Ilex cassine&quot; var. &quot;angustifolia&quot; (United States)
*&quot;Ilex cassine&quot; var. &quot;mexicana&quot; (Mexico)

&quot;Ilex × attenuata&quot; is a naturally occurring hybrid of &quot;Ilex cassine&quot; and &quot;Ilex opaca&quot;.

==Natural range and cultivation==
&quot;Ilex cassine&quot; is indigenous to the southeastern coast of North America and the Caribbean, growing along the margins of waterways and swamps from Virginia to the Colorado River in Texas, with subspecies growing southward as far as Veracruz on the Gulf Coast, and in the Caribbean on the coasts of Cuba, the Bahamas, and Puerto Rico.

It is cultivated in warmer climates as an ornamental plant for the attractive bright red berries set against the glossy green leaves. It is known to grow as high as .

==Stimulant==
&quot;Ilex cassine&quot; leaves, like those of its sister species &quot;I. vomitoria&quot;, contain measurable amounts of the stimulants caffeine and theobromine. The leaves of both species may have been used in the Native American &quot;cassena&quot; (the Black drink), and there has been confusion in the literature as to which species was commonly used to brew the drink, but &quot;I. vomitoria&quot; provides more caffeine and was probably the usual ingredient in cassena. 

An analysis of the levels of methylxanthines in the leaves used in various stimulant drinks found that &quot;I. cassine&quot; leaves have about 20% (by dry weight) of the amount of caffeine found in &quot;I. vomitoria&quot;, 8% of that in &quot;Coffea arabica&quot;, and about 3% of the caffeine in &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; Kunze. &quot;I. cassine&quot; has twice as much theobromine as &quot;I. vomitoria&quot; and 20% of the level in &quot;C. sinensis&quot; Kunze (&quot;C. arabica&quot; does not contain significant amounts of theobromine), but the stimulant effect of theobromine is just 10% of that of caffeine. 

The Native peoples of Florida used the hollowed-out shells of Lightning Whelks (Busycon contrarium), a kind of sea snail found on the east and west coasts of Florida, as drinking vessels in their black drink ceremonies.

<doc id="471415" wikidata="Q934888" url="?curid=471415" title="Adrenal medulla">
<text>The adrenal medulla () is the inner part of the adrenal gland. It is located at the center of the gland, being surrounded by the adrenal cortex. It is the innermost part of the adrenal gland, consisting of chromaffin cells that secrete catecholamines, including epinephrine (adrenaline), norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and a small amount of dopamine, in response to stimulation by sympathetic preganglionic neurons.

==Structure==
The adrenal medulla consists of irregularly shaped cells grouped around blood vessels. These cells are intimately connected with the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). These adrenal medullary cells are modified postganglionic neurons, and preganglionic autonomic nerve fibers lead to them directly from the central nervous system. The adrenal medulla affects energy availability, heart rate, and basal metabolic rate. Recent research indicates that the adrenal medulla may receive input from higher-order cognitive centers in the prefrontal cortex as well as the sensory and motor cortices, providing credence to the idea that there are psychosomatic illnesses.

===Development===
Chromaffin cells are derived from the embryonic neural crest, and are modified postganglionic sympathetic neurons. They are modified postganglionic sympathetic neurons of the autonomic nervous system that have lost their axons and dendrites, receiving innervation from corresponding preganglionic fibers. The cells form clusters around fenestrated capillaries where they release norepinephrine and epinephrine into the blood.

As a cluster of neuron cell bodies, the adrenal medulla is considered a modified ganglion of the sympathetic nervous system.

==Function==
Rather than releasing a neurotransmitter, the cells of the adrenal medulla secrete hormones.

The adrenal medulla is the principal site of the conversion of the amino acid tyrosine into the catecholamines; epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine.

Because the ANS, specifically the sympathetic division, exerts direct control over the chromaffin cells, the hormone release can occur rather quickly. In response to stressors, such as exercise or imminent danger, medullary cells release the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline into the blood. Adrenaline composes about 85% of the released catecholamines, and noradrenaline the other 15%.

Notable effects of adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) include increased heart rate and blood pressure, blood vessel constriction in the skin and gastrointestinal tract, smooth muscle (bronchiole and capillary) dilation, and increased metabolism, all of which are characteristic of the fight-or-flight response. Release of catecholamines is stimulated by nerve impulses, and receptors for catecholamines are widely distributed throughout the body.

==Clinical significance==
Neoplasms include:
* Pheochromocytoma (most common), a catecholamine-secreting tumor of the adrenal medulla. Pheochromocytomas may generate sudden bursts of paroxysmal symptoms due to excess catecholamine secretion. In a classical presentation of these tumors, some symptoms that commonly occur are palpitations, sweating, and headaches; these last a variable amount of time (minutes to hours) and occur periodically. Other symptoms include but are not limited to pallor, nausea, and panic attacks. Pheochromocytoma is often called a medical &quot;mimic&quot; since it often presents with signs and symptoms that mimic other conditions. For example, pheochromocytoma can result in flushing, nausea, weight loss, fatigue, abdominal pain, constipation, chest pain, and onset of diabetes.
* Neuroblastoma, a neuroendocrine tumor of any neural crest tissue of the sympathetic nervous system.
* Ganglioneuroma, a tumor in the nerve cells of the peripheral nervous system.
The adrenal medulla may be poorly formed or absent in cases of absent adrenal gland. The deficiency in circulating catecholamines is mildly symptomatic due to compensation by the autonomous nervous system, except in episodes of hypoglycemia where glycogenolysis cannot be stimulated by circulating epinephrine .

In dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency, the entire body cannot efficiently produce epinephrine and norepinephrine from dopamine, this results in severe dysautonomia but most crucially due to autonomous nervous system failure which requires epinephrine and norepinephrine as neurotransmitters, dopamine being used in this pathology as an inadequate substitute.

<text>Statistics Canada divides the province of Alberta into nineteen census divisions. Unlike in some other provinces, census divisions do not reflect the organization of local government in Alberta. These areas exist solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation; they have no government of their own.

Alberta&#x27;s census divisions consist of numerous census subdivisions. The types of census subdivisions within an Alberta census division may include:
*cities, towns, villages, and summer villages (urban municipalities); 
*specialized municipalities;
*municipal districts, special areas, and improvement districts (rural municipalities);
*Indian reserves; and
*Indian settlements.

<text>The Oak Ridges Moraine is an ecologically important geological landform in the Mixedwood Plains of south-central Ontario, Canada. The moraine covers a geographic area of between Caledon and Rice Lake, near Peterborough. One of the most significant landforms in southern Ontario, the moraine gets its name from the rolling hills and river valleys extending east from the Niagara Escarpment to Rice Lake, formed 12,000 years ago by advancing and retreating glaciers (see &quot;geological origins&quot;, below) during the last glaciation period. Below the approximately 200 metre thick glacial derived sediments of the moraine lies thick bedrock successions of Precambrian rocks and up to 200 metres of Ordovician aged rock (see &quot;geology&quot; below), capped by a regional unconformity of erosion and non-deposition to the Quaternary period. Rivers and lakes scatter the landscape and are important for creating habitat for the rich diversity of species of animals, trees and shrubbery (see &quot;ecology&quot;). These are also the supply of fresh water to aquifers in the moraine through complex subterranean connections (see &quot;hydrology&quot;). Construction development nearby, and with expansion of communities around the moraine in need of potable water, it is a contested site in Ontario, since it stands in the path of major urban development (see &quot;political action&quot;). Conservation of the moraine is thus an important step for keeping aquifers in a safe drinkable condition while also protecting the natural ecosystems surrounding and within the moraine (see &quot;conservation&quot;). This region has been subject to multiple decades of scientific research to study the origins of formation, and how early communities used the land. A larger focus currently is how to source potable water without removing the aquifer entirely (see &quot;research&quot; section).

==Physiography==
The Oak Ridges Moraine is a pair of large ridges composed of four elevated wedges. It is bounded to the west by the Niagara Escarpment, a cuesta which was critical to the formation of the moraine, and to the east by the Trent River and Rice Lake. The four wedges (&quot;Albion&quot;, &quot;Uxbridge&quot;, &quot;Pontypool&quot; and &quot;Rice Lake&quot; from west to east) formed in stages, though some synchronous formation also occurred at an early period of formation. The moraine peaks at the Uxbridge wedge, generally rising from east to west, a result of the moraine&#x27;s west-to-east formation. That is, the western portion of the moraine received earlier and more frequent sedimentary deposition than the eastern portion, as the ice lobes which controlled the moraine&#x27;s eastern formation slowly retreated. The Rice Lake wedge is separated from the other wedges where the Oak Ridges Moraine intersects Rice Lake. As the moraine is a local topographic high, streams originating in the lower Oak Ridges Moraine sediment packages, by groundwater movement, either flow south into Lake Ontario or north toward Lake Simcoe or Georgian Bay through large river valleys carved during melting of glaciers.

To the north are drumlinized uplands, referred to as the &quot;Peterborough drumlin field,&quot; which may continue south of Rice Lake and the Rice Lake wedge&quot;.&quot; Near the Rice Lake wedge and Peterborough drumlin field are a couple of low-lying terrain plains and small hills on bedrock basement.

==Geological origins==
The Oak Ridges Moraine probably formed in the Late Wisconsin glacial period. Ice melt from the Niagara Escarpment flowed into the western boundaries of the moraine, wherein conduits beneath the ice expanded to form a west-to-east passage between the main Laurentide Ice Sheet and a mass of ice in the Lake Ontario basin.

Stratified sediment was deposited rapidly on the high-relief erosional surface. Up to in some areas, the deposits occurred on surfaces defined by highly eroded channels and drumlin uplands. The channel tunnels were primarily created by the erosion from glacial rivers, a typical process before moraine formation.

Characteristic of this moraine is the transition of deposition layers from glaciofluvial to glaciolacustrine. Sedimentary glaciofluvial areas form the core of the Oak Ridges Moraine, though restricted to subglacial cavity fills of confined subaqueous fans. Overlaying this core is a glaciolacustrine sedimentary layer that is younger and topographically lower, principally in the delta and basin areas of the moraine.

In the late stages of its development, random unstratified accumulation (known as diamicton) occurred along the ice margins. Whereas the glacial river deposits were more substantial by volume, the diamicton deposits represent a greater portion of the moraine&#x27;s exposed surface. Research suggests that sedimentation occurred in a west to east sequence along the four main sedimentary wedges: &quot;Albion&quot;, &quot;Uxbridge&quot;, &quot;Pontytool&quot; and &quot;Rice Lake&quot;. The wedges may have formed in a relatively short period of time, perhaps no more than a few hundred years, as indicated by the annual deposition cycles in glacial lakes (known as varves) within the moraine sediments. However, the lowest beds in the moraine may have experienced synchronous sedimentation.

== Geology ==
===Glacial sediments===

In the area of the Oak Ridges Moraine, glacially derived sediments, mainly of Pleistocene age, may overlie a regional unconformity and lower Newmarket till, up to 200 metres thick in some places. Extensive research in the moraine area indicate there may be 6 different periods of sedimentation from the onset of glaciation. There are &quot;lower deposits&quot; of sand, silt and clay, which rest directly above the regional time unconformity up to thick in some areas. These lower deposits are thought to be proglacial lake derived, and contain from bottom to top: York Till, Don Interglacial beds, Scarborough Formation, Sunnybrook Till and Thorncliffe Formation. Next comes the &quot;Newmarket Till&quot; of stony, silty sand and sandy-silt diamicton ranging from thick and is thought to extend southward under Lake Ontario. Cutting into the &quot;Newmarket Till&quot; is another regional unconformity, which led to coarse grained &quot;channel fill&quot; sediments. Some &quot;channel fills&quot; are 10 to 25 metres of gravels or sands that decrease in grain size during later deposition following a period of slowing meltwater runoff. &quot;Channel fill&quot; sediments comprise the base of &quot;Oak Ridges Moraine sediments&quot;, atop the unconformity. Lower deposits of the &quot;Oak Ridges Moraine sediments&quot; stratigraphic package start as coarse sands and gravels whereas upper sediments are interbedded fine sands and silts with &quot;channel fill&quot;. There may also be sequences of sediments decreasing in size from medium sands to silts and clays up to ten&#x27;s of metres thick. Above these sediments lie clayey-silt to silt till of the &quot;Halton Till&quot;, at thicknesses reaching . The &quot;Halton Till&quot; is not present over the entire expanse of the moraine, cropping out locally and interspersed. 

Glacial lake sediments cap the entire sequence of &quot;Oak Ridges Moraine sediment&quot; stratigraphy in the region, namely from two glacial lakes, Lake Algonquin and Lake Iroquois. The main depositional ingredient from these lakes is silt with some clay content, as layers of thick in places. Glacial sediments are subject to erosional forces and valley cutting processes, removing previously laid sediments and placing them further along the river path.

===Unconformity===

At the Oak Ridges Moraine system, rocks from the Ordovician Period underlie the post-glacial sediment and are a large part of the bedrock geology, aside from the presence of some older basement rock beneath. From the basement rocks to the overlying stratigraphic successions is an unconformity (a gap in the geologic record) where many millions of years of depositional or crystalline record are erased (mostly Silurian to Pleistocene rocks) by regional erosion processes and continent building phases. A large time gap is important in this context to correlate where and when this event occurred with respect to both local and surrounding geology of the lithostratigraphic and geographical record. Cause of this stratigraphic gap may originate from a couple large scale meltwater events, the older Algonquin and younger Ontarian erosional floods from melting glaciers of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation.

===Paleozoic bedrock===

Basement layers are composed of Early Ordovician aged dolostone as a first sequence only to be stripped away by erosion in the Middle Ordovician. Sea transgression during continent reformation in the Middle Ordovician brought in a second sequence of deposition as clastic and carbonate sediments above this new unconformity. A third depositional sequence is found in the Late Ordovician, separated from the Middle Ordovician by local erosion and clastic sediments, consists of a shale base topped with more shale interbedded with limestone and calcareous siltstones. Above this is yet another unconformity, this time due to sea regression in the Late Ordovician to Early Silurian time. Large gaps in deposition from the Early Silurian through Mesozoic time allowed large scale erosion to occur in this geographic region, to the onset of Quaternary glaciation and subsequent sediment deposition. A 1997 report from the Geological Survey of Canada estimates the bedrock thickness to range between thick, below approximately of Pleistocene aged sediments. This broad range of thickness is representative of the unequal effects of regional erosion, uplift, sedimentary deposition and continental processes (tectonics, building and destroying of continents).

===Precambrian bedrock===

Rocks from the Grenville Province of Precambrian age lie below Ordovician aged limestones and shales in much of the Oak Ridges Moraine area. These come from a period of continental scale orogeny in eastern North America about 1.2 to 1.3 billion years ago. This area of the Grenville Province is mainly composed of metamorphosed gneiss and mylonite, while also including intrusions of granitic composition as well. Both the metamorphic and igneous rocks are able to better withstand erosional forces from the advancing ice sheets compared to some softer rock types. Softer metamorphic rocks of the Precambrian basement include marbles or metaturbidites, both from sedimentary origin.

== Ecology ==

The ecologically diverse moraine is the water source for many headwaters streams flowing south into rivers that drain into Lake Ontario and north into rivers that drain into Lake Scugog and Lake Simcoe. Varied landforms on the moraine, such as woodlands, wetlands, watercourses, kettle lakes and bogs, have provided an environment suitable for significant flora and fauna communities to develop and thrive. The moraine contains one of the last large contiguous forested spans in southern Ontario.

Some of the wide variety of plant and animal species found in the moraine are &quot;species at risk&quot; in Canada and Ontario, including the West Virginia white butterfly, Jefferson salamander, and red-shouldered hawk. Unique ecosystems in the moraine include wetlands similar to those of boreal forests in Northern Ontario, and remnants of tallgrass prairie and oak-pine savanna that are globally threatened ecosystems. A representative portion of the moraine may be found in the Happy Valley Forests, in York Region, north of Toronto.

== Hydrology ==
A number of features comprise the hydrological system of the Oak Ridges Moraine:

* permanent and ephemeral streams,
* wetlands,
* kettle lakes and ponds, and their catchment areas,
* seepage areas and springs, and
* aquifers and other recharge areas.

This hydrological system is inter-twined with a regional flow systems not bound by the morphological limits of the moraine. For this reason, environmentalists and researchers promote an aggressive protection strategy extending beyond the moraine, thus ensuring a contiguously protected hydrological system. Preservation of aquifers under the moraine is especially important, since they are used as a primary water source by some municipalities located on or near the moraine. These aquifers also discharge into tributaries that are the headwaters of approximately 65 creeks and rivers which eventually flow into Lake Simcoe, Lake Scugog and Lake Ontario or Georgian Bay.

The &quot;Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act&quot; stipulates that any development which targets the moraine or nearby areas must satisfy several conditions, most prominently that each development leave a buffer zone of between it and any hydrological feature; for a kettle lake, this measure is from the edge of the lake&#x27;s catchment area.

The Oak Ridges Moraine&#x27;s hydrological system is a major constituent of the Humber Watershed, so that any factors affecting the moraine may affect the connected systems. A specific concern is urbanization, which affects water quality by increasing its load of metals and organic contaminants. A study by Cook et al. (1985) found an increase in mean annual runoff, instantaneous discharge, and hydrograph peak flow as a result of urbanization: &quot;...changes in land use coincided with changes in volumetric and time distribution aspects of hydrologic response&quot;.

==Research on the moraine==
In 1829, John Bigsby conducted the first investigation of the moraine. He noted the elevation, and styled the area &quot;Oak Ridge&quot;, identifying the portion of moraine north of Toronto. The moraine&#x27;s extent was not established until 1863 when William Logan conducted the Geological Survey of Canada.

Taylor formally defined the landform as the Oak Ridges Moraine in 1913. He described its extent to be from King and Maple in the west to the Trent River in the east. He also proposed that its origin was overlapping, interlobate glaciation retreat, between the Lake Ontario Lobe and the older Lake Simcoe Lobe. This has become the accepted explanation for the moraine&#x27;s development, though research in the 1970s suggested the moraine may not be interlobate.

Research conducted in the 1990s revealed that the moraine has multiple origins: its eastern area has subglacial depositions (Gorrell and McCrae, 1993); early parts of the moraine were deposited in an esker (Brennand and Shaw, 1994); and that the moraine is not continuous, but is composed of multiple depositional environments: subglacial, ice-marginal and proglacial lacustrine (Barnett et al., 1998).

Current research efforts on the moraine are quite extensive. Because of the political implications of development on the moraine, and because its aquifers are a source of potable water for numerous communities, both federal and provincial governments have invested resources towards research on the moraine. The Geological Survey of Canada and Ontario Geological Survey both investigate hydrostratigraphy and hydrology throughout the moraine.

Palaeo-Indian hunter-gatherers were in this area between 11,000 - 9,500 BP. The oldest artifact found in what is now Richmond Hill, Ontario, from these people, was a stone scraper about 40 mm long, at the Mortson Site, near Leslie Street and 19th Avenue. Other artifacts were found in a settlement site on the eastern shore of Lake Wilcox.

Late Archaic artifacts c. 3800 BP have also been found at the Silver Stream site, near the headwaters of the Rouge River on Leslie Street, just north of Major Mackenzie Drive, and at the Esox site, on the eastern shore of Lake Wilcox.

==Political action==
Although preservation of the moraine was first suggested in the 1940s, it was not until 1991 that the issue achieved prominence in political discourse. Part of the reason for its entry into political discourse, was due to the formation, in 1989, of the Save the Oak Ridges Moraine (STORM) Coalition.

The Government of Ontario created the &quot;Oak Ridges Moraine Technical Working Committee&quot; in June 1991, with the aim of creating a regional planning strategy for the moraine. The plan was completed in 1994, but was subsequently dismissed in favour of local government administration of the affected lands. This led to intense development on some portions of the moraine.

In early 1999, developers targeted Richmond Hill for large subdivisions on the moraine which would house over 100,000 people. On July 20, 1999, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Steve Gilchrist announced, on &quot;Rouge Park Day&quot;, that he would be implementing a ban on all development on the Oak Ridges Moraine. This announcement sparked considerable opposition by the development industry which, in turn, attracted considerable media attention and public interest. A media campaign by environmental groups built on the public opposition of the developments, and the issue was transferred to the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) in 2000.

By May 2001, with the issue still unresolved, the provincial Conservative government announced a six-month moratorium on moraine development. A panel was formed to create a land-use plan consistent with the current &quot;smart growth&quot; policy. The plan was released in October 2001, and became the basis for Bill 122, the &quot;Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001&quot;, which divided the moraine into four zones with increasingly stringent controls on development in each. The Act prevented development of over 92% of the land mass of the moraine and only those development projects which had already received zoning and planning approval were allowed to be completed.

During the provincial election of 2003, the Liberal Party of Ontario promised to terminate development on the moraine as part of their election campaign. The government, in its attempt to halt developments, proposed the &quot;North Pickering Land Exchange.&quot; This involved exchanging government-owned public lands in North Pickering (the Seaton lands) for privately owned lands on the Oak Ridges Moraine in Richmond Hill and Uxbridge. The exchange settled outstanding disputes being considered by the OMB involving moraine lands in Richmond Hill and Uxbridge.

Despite all these efforts, including the government&#x27;s creation of a permanently protected Greenbelt, the political struggle regarding the moraine continues.

Unless approved prior to the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act coming into force in 2001 or through orders of the Ontario Municipal Board to the contrary, development on the Oak Ridges Moraine is restricted to the Settlement Area. Smaller-scale development which improves the ecological integrity of the moraine is permitted in other areas (i.e., tree farm), but is otherwise restricted. Given that the land-subdivision process is lengthy and that Markham, Vaughan, Richmond Hill, Whitchurch-Stouffville and King Township are experiencing a shortage in servicing capacity, what often appears as &quot;new&quot; development in Markham, Vaughan, Richmond Hill, Whitchurch-Stouffville and King Township on the moraine is in the majority of cases development which has had approval for many years.

==Development pressures==
The greatest threat to the function of the moraine is land development on and below its surface, particularly in the headwaters. The estimated current population on the moraine land itself is roughly 200,000 but this number continues to grow at a frantic pace, with large urban developments occurring in Stouffville, Vaughan, Richmond Hill, and Aurora. This rapid development is especially apparent in Oak Ridges, where land previously set aside for conservation has, as of 2009, been opened up by the Richmond Hill Town Council for development. Another five million people live in close proximity. Use of the moraine is currently under dispute; environmental groups such as the Sierra Club maintain the area&#x27;s delicate ecosystems are threatened by development pressures. Attractive forests and hilly relief typical of the moraine are a magnet for developers looking for building opportunities in the densely populated Greater Toronto Area. However, many planners and residents see a need to preserve the moraine from the negative aspects of urban sprawl.

Moreover, because it is a rich resource for sand and gravel, it has become a significant source of materials for the aggregate industry of the Greater Toronto Area.
==Conservation==
Fisher and Alexander in the early 1990s described a &quot;metropolitan&quot; invasion of the Oak Ridges Moraine, in response to which organizations such as Save the Oak Ridges Moraine (STORM) were formed. Conservation Authorities Moraine Coalition (CAMC) is a coalition of nine Conservation Authorities with watersheds on the Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM). The Coalition formed in 2000 two years prior to the ORM conservation Plan, in response to the need for a comprehensive policy, planning and management approach geared to sustaining the health of the entire ORM. The CAMC is a partnership organization. It collaborates with numerous groups and individuals to achieve common objectives to support a robust and resilient environment across the ORM landscape. These objectives include; undertaking science-based research; providing opportunities for recreation; taking action for the protection and restoration of the ORM and; providing expert advice for environmental planning and policy matters.

Local concerns for preserving wildlife habitat on the moraine have increased in recent years. In April 2000, the Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust was formed. The ORMLT is a non-profit organization that raises funds to protect areas on the moraine through conservation easements and outright purchases. They have protected . The Nature Conservancy of Canada is also active and are raising funds to protect a property called Happy Valley Forest.

<doc id="471427" wikidata="Q3309433" url="?curid=471427" title="Selling out">
<text>&quot;Selling out&quot;, or &quot;sold out&quot; in the past tense, is a common expression for the compromising of a person&#x27;s integrity, morality, authenticity, or principles by forgoing the long-term benefits of a collective or group in exchange for personal gain, such as money or power. In terms of music or art, selling out is associated with attempts to tailor material to a mainstream or commercial audience. For example, a musician who alters their material to encompass a wider audience, and in turn generates greater revenue, may be labeled by fans who pre-date the change as a &quot;sellout&quot;. &quot;Sellout&quot; also refers to someone who gives up, or disregards someone or something for some other thing or person.

== In sports ==
In sports franchises, a &quot;sellout&quot; is a person or group claiming to adhere to the ideology of putting the collective interests of the team, franchise or fans above their own individual accomplishments or financial gain, only to follow these claims up with actions contradicting them, such as an athlete or coach pledging to stay with a team until a specific goal is accomplished, but immediately deciding to leave the team for financial gain. 

==In politics==
In political movements, a &quot;sellout&quot; is a person or group claiming to adhere to one ideology, only to follow these claims up with actions contradicting them, such as a revolutionary group claiming to fight for a particular cause, but failing to continue this upon obtaining power.

An example of political &quot;selling out&quot; is a political party who has formed a coalition with another party it had historically opposed, such as the Liberal Democrats&#x27; leader Nick Clegg&#x27;s coalition with the Conservative Party after the 2010 general election in the United Kingdom, during which he reneged on his pledge to oppose any increase in student tuition fees.

==In music and entertainment==

===Music===

There are three distinct forms of &quot;selling out&quot; in terms of music. First, there is the use of the term &quot;sell-out&quot; to refer to those who sign for major labels or to those who license their music to companies for use in advertising that contradicts their apparent values. Secondly, the expression can refer to those who sacrifice their musical integrity through a change in their musical sound, sometimes due to pressure from major labels or in order to gain profit by making their music more appealing to a mainstream audience. The third form of selling out is simply to sell out a venue, which normally has nothing to do with a lapse of integrity.

====Record labels and advertising====

Since the time of big band radio shows, there has been an established relationship between musicians and commercialization. There had been some signs of resistance to this model as early as the 1960s, when gospel group The Blind Boys of Alabama refused to sign record deals to record secular music. It was not until the punk subculture in the 1970s that the notion that musicians should be completely independent of commercial influences began to increase in popularity. This partly manifested itself in the reluctance of bands to sign for major labels, as this would include taking part in activities that were seen as crass and overly commercial. This continued into the 1980s, when bands were scorned by fanzines for signing with major labels as the mainstream success this would bring was symptomatic of the general decay in culture. However, after a number of bands maintained the quality of their records after signing for a major label, by the end of the 1980s the focus on &quot;selling out&quot; shifted to advertising.

The attitude held by those who disliked the idea of &quot;selling out&quot; towards advertising was negative; comedian Bill Hicks claimed that any band who licensed their music for advertising was &quot;off the artistic roll call forever&quot;, and Neil Young mocked the fact that songs became associated with brands on his 1988 album &quot;This Note&#x27;s for You&quot;. However, although it was possible for fans to feel a sense of betrayal due to the relationship they developed with the song and artist, when artists did allow their music to be used for commercials others considered the advertised product to be more appealing. As CD sales fell and record companies became unwilling or unable to afford the push new bands needed to become established, sponsorship of bands by major companies began to be seen as more acceptable, with even minor record labels devoting time and money towards marketing deals with well-known brands.

By the 2010s, the use of licensing of artists in commercials had become an accepted part of the music industry, and even those who would previously have been considered part of the 1970s resistance to &quot;selling out&quot; have been used in advertising products, such as former Sex Pistols frontman John Lydon advertising Country Life butter and Iggy Pop endorsing car insurance. Consequently, it has been suggested that the acceptance of music in advertising is generational, as younger listeners are comfortable with the relationship to the point of indifference whilst those who have seen the industry evolve still reject it.

====Musical integrity====

Another definition of &quot;selling out&quot; refers to putting aside musical quality or original intentions in favor of commercial success, where a distinction is made for those who achieve success without changing their original sound. The difference between the two is often subjective. While artists may change their musical direction for commercial reasons, such as pressure from major labels who require songs to appeal to mass markets, a change in sound may also be part of a natural progression of creative maturity.

An example of artists being accused of &quot;selling out&quot; is the band Metallica, whose 1991 eponymous album has been considered the turning point in the band&#x27;s musical direction; the band members were called the &quot;poster boys for musical un-integrity&quot; after many incorrectly thought that the band attempted to sue fans who were downloading their music through Napster. The album, known as &quot;The Black Album&quot;, saw critics and Bob Rock, the album&#x27;s producer, acknowledge that there was a move away from the band&#x27;s previous thrash metal sound. Rock claimed that the change stemmed from the band&#x27;s desire to &quot;make the leap to the big, big leagues&quot;, while some fans blamed Rock himself, going as far to eventually create an internet petition demanding the band cut their ties with him. However, other fans did not consider the change in sound to be significant enough to be considered &quot;selling out&quot;, and others accepted the change as part of a natural evolution of the band&#x27;s style. Ultimately &quot;The Black Album&quot; became the band&#x27;s most commercially successful release, going 16× Platinum in the United States. The differing reaction by fans to the album demonstrates the difficulty in labelling an artist as a &quot;sellout&quot; objectively.

&quot;Poseur&quot; is a pejorative term, often used in the punk, heavy metal, hip hop, and goth subcultures, to describe a person who copies the dress, speech, and/or mannerisms of a group or subculture, generally for attaining acceptability within the group or for popularity among various other groups, yet who is deemed not to share or understand the values of the subculture.
While this perceived is viewed with scorn and contempt by members of the subculture, the definition of the term and to whom it should be applied is subjective. While the term is most associated with the 1970s- and 1980s-era punk and hardcore subculture, English use of the term originates in the late 19th century.

===Film and television===
In film and television &quot;selling out&quot; refers to compromising the content of produced media, primarily for financial reasons; for example, introducing product placement.

Product placement, or embedded marketing, is the placement of brands or products in media in order to advertise, and has been in television from almost the very beginning, but has increased with introduction of devices such as DVRs which allow viewers, and therefore consumers, to fast-forward through adverts. It has been suggested that the idea that product placement is a form of selling out is Anglocentric, as American television shows such as &quot;American Idol&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; recorded over 500 examples of brand integration in 2011 according to Nielsen.

===Comedy===

Stand-up comedians occasionally face accusations of &quot;selling out&quot;. Comedians who start out in comedy clubs might often use foul language and blue humor in their routines. A comic who alters their routine by &quot;sugar-coating&quot; their language and using less-offensive material to obtain mainstream success may be accused of &quot;selling out&quot;.

George Carlin was accused of being a &quot;sellout&quot; for appearing in television commercials for MCI&#x27;s 10-10-220. Carlin had previously spoken of his dislike for MCI&#x27;s commercials in his 1996 album &quot;Back in Town&quot;. In his 1999 album &quot;You Are All Diseased&quot;, which contains rants against advertising and business, Carlin admits the dichotomy but makes no attempt to explain himself, stating, &quot;You&#x27;re just gonna have to figure that shit out on your own.&quot; In interviews, Carlin revealed he appeared in the advertisements to help pay off a large tax debt to the IRS.

Comedian/actress Janeane Garofalo has described herself as a &quot;sellout&quot; based on her participation with the TV show &quot;24&quot; playing Janis Gold. Garofalo initially turned down the role because of the way the show depicted torture scenes; however, she changed her mind later on, saying in an interview, &quot;Being unemployed and being flattered that someone wanted to work with me outweighed my stance [on torture].&quot; Garofalo admitted to &quot;selling out&quot; for losing weight in order to gain more acting work.

==In the brewing industry==
The term has been used amongst fans of craft beer to describe when an independent brewery signs a deal with a big brewery, with the latter seen much as big record labels in the music industry. An example is when the Elysian Brewing Company signed a distribution deal with Anheuser-Busch InBev.

==Criticism of the term==
An artist may also be accused of &quot;selling out&quot; after changes in artistic direction. This conclusion is often due to the perception that the reason for the artist changing artistic style or direction was simply potential material gain. This ignores other causes of artistic development, which may lead an artist in new directions from those that attracted their original fans. Artists&#x27; improvements in musical skill or change in taste may also account for the change.

Other times, artists (including those with politically oriented messages) resent the term on the grounds that the perceived desire for material gain is simply a result of the band seeking to expand its message. To such artists, &quot;not&quot; going mainstream or signing to a bigger label to avoid &quot;selling out&quot; prevents them from addressing a wider audience, regardless of whether or not there is any real artistic change, and arbitrarily hampers the artists&#x27; course of mainstream success. Such an accusation, then, assumes that mainstream success must be against the artists&#x27; original intentions. For example, when questioned about signing to a major label, Rage Against the Machine answered &quot;We&#x27;re not interested in preaching to just the converted. It&#x27;s great to play abandoned squats run by anarchists, but it&#x27;s also great to be able to reach people with a revolutionary message, people from Granada Hills to Stuttgart.&quot; Similarly, when confronted with the accusation of &quot;selling out&quot; in 2001, Mike Dirnt of Green Day said:
&quot;If there&#x27;s a formula to selling out, I think every band in the world would be doing it. The fact that you write good songs and you sell too many of them, if everybody in the world knew how to do that they&#x27;d do it. It&#x27;s not something we chose to do...The fact was we got to a point that we were so big that tons of people were showing up at punk-rock clubs, and some clubs were even getting shut down because too many were showing up. We had to make a decision: either break up or remove ourselves from that element. And I&#x27;ll be damned if I was going to flip fucking burgers. I do what I do best. Selling out is compromising your musical intention and I don&#x27;t even know how to do that.&quot;

<text>Viscount St Vincent, of Meaford in the County of Stafford, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 27 April 1801 for the noted naval commander John Jervis, Earl of St Vincent, with remainder to his nephews William Henry Ricketts and Edward Jervis Ricketts successively, and after them to his niece Mary, wife of William Carnegie, 7th Earl of Northesk. He had already been created Baron Jervis, of Meaford in the County of Stafford, and Earl of St Vincent, in the Peerage of Great Britain, on 23 August 1797, with normal remainder to his heirs male. On Lord St Vincent&#x27;s death in 1823 the barony and earldom became extinct while he was succeeded in the viscountcy according to the special remainder by his nephew, the second viscount. In 1823 he assumed by royal licence the surname of Jervis in lieu of Ricketts. His great-grandson, the fourth viscount, was part of the force that was sent in 1884 to rescue General Gordon at Khartoum, and died from wounds received at the Battle of Abu Klea in January 1885. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth viscount. the title is held by the eighth viscount, who succeeded his father in September 2006.

The heir presumptive is the present holder&#x27;s uncle Ronald Nigel John Jervis (born 1954).

The only male line that still exists in remainder to the Viscountcy is the current male line of the 2nd Viscount. The male line of Mary Ricketts, sister of the 2nd Viscount, with her husband the 7th Earl of Northesk, which the title would pass to on the extinction of the 2nd Viscount&#x27;s line, became extinct with the death of the 14th Earl of Northesk.

<doc id="471429" wikidata="Q83501" url="?curid=471429" title="Vladimir Prelog">
<text>Vladimir Prelog (23 July 1906 – 7 January 1998) was a Croatian-Swiss organic chemist who received the 1975 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his research into the stereochemistry of organic molecules and reactions. Prelog was born, and spent his infancy, in Sarajevo, and youth in Zagreb, Osijek and Prague. He later lived and worked in Prague, Zagreb and Zürich.

==Early life==
Prelog was born in Sarajevo, Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina, at that time within Austria-Hungary, to Croat parents who were working there. His father, Milan, a native of Zagreb, was a history professor at a gymnasium in Sarajevo and later at the University of Zagreb. As an 8-year-old boy, he stood near the place where the assassination of Franz Ferdinand occurred.. 

===Education===

Prelog started elementary school in Sarajevo. In 1915, at the beginning of the first World War, at Prelog moved to Zagreb (then part of the Austro-Hungary) with his parents. In Zagreb he graduated from elementary school and, from 1916 to 1919, attended gymnasium there. From 1919 to 1921 his father got a job in Osijek, so family moved there, and Prelog spent those two years attending Osijek gymnasium. There his professor Ivan Kuria sparked his interest and enthusiasm for chemistry.

It was in 1921 that, at the age of , and with his teacher’s help, he published a short communication entitled »Eine Titriervorrichtung« (Preparation for Titration) in the prestigious German journal »Chemiker-Zeitung«. 

Prelog and Kuria became friends, and continued communicating by letters after Prelog left Osijek.. In a letter from March 16, 1922, Prelog wrote:
Prelog completed his high school education in Zagreb in 1924. Following his father&#x27;s wishes, he moved to Prague, where he received his diploma in chemical engineering from the Czech Technical University in 1928. He received his Sc.D in 1929. His teacher was Emil Votoček, while his assistant and mentor Rudolf Lukeš introduced him to the world of organic chemistry.

Upon leaving the Czech Technical University, Prelog worked in the plant laboratory of the private firm of G.J. Dríza in Prague; few academic positions were available due to the Great Depression. Prelog was in charge of the production of rare chemicals that were not commercially available at that time. He worked for Driza from 1929 until 1935. During the time, he got his first doctoral candidate, a company owner at Driza. He performed research in his spare time, investigating alkaloids in cacao bark.

==Career and research==

Prelog wanted to work in an academic environment, so he accepted the position of lecturer at the University of Zagreb in 1935. At the Technical Faculty in Zagreb, he lectured on organic chemistry and chemical engineering.

With the help of collaborators and students, Prelog started researching quinine and its related compounds. He was financially supported by the pharmaceutical factory &quot;Kaštel&quot;, currently Pliva. He developed a financially successful method of producing Streptazol, one of the first commercial sulfonamides. In 1941, while at Zagreb, Prelog developed the first synthesis of adamantane, a hydrocarbon with an unusual structure that was isolated from Moravian oil fields.

===Zürich===
In 1941, in the midst of World War II, Prelog was invited to lecture in Germany by Richard Kuhn. Shortly afterwards, Lavoslav Ružička, whom Prelog asked for help, invited Prelog to visit him on his way to Germany. He and his wife used those invitations to escape to Zürich in Switzerland. With Ružička&#x27;s help, he gained support from CIBA Ltd. and started to work in the Organic Chemistry Laboratory in the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (&quot;ETH&quot;, or &quot;Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule&quot;). Prelog was able to separate the chiral enantiomers of Tröger&#x27;s base in 1944 by chromatography on an optically active substrate.

With this chiral resolution, he was able to prove that not only carbon but also nitrogen atoms can be the chiral centre in a molecule, which had been speculated for several years. His relationship with Ružička helped him climb up the academic hierarchical ladder. Starting as an assistant, he became &quot;Privat-Dozent&quot;, &quot;Titularprofessor&quot;, associate professor, and in 1952 full professor. In 1957 he succeeded Ružička as head of the Laboratory. Since Prelog disliked administrative duties, he implemented rotating chairmanship in the ETH. Prelog joined the ETH at the right time, since Ružička&#x27;s Jewish co-workers left the country and went to the United States, so Prelog filled the vacuum they left.

===Later work in Switzerland===
Prelog&#x27;s main interest was focused on alkaloids. He found an ideal topic in the elucidation of the structure of solanine; he continued his work on &quot;Cinchona&quot; alkaloids and started to investigate strychnine. He showed that Robert Robinson&#x27;s formula for strychnine was not correct. Although the formula he proposed was also not the right one, the discovery increased his international prestige. Later he worked on elucidating the structures of aromatic &quot;Erythrina&quot; alkaloids with Derek Barton, Oskar Jeger and Robert Burns Woodward.

At mid-century, the instrumental revolution necessitated a new approach to structural elucidation. Purely chemical methods had become outdated and had lost some of their intellectual appeal. Recognizing the growing importance of microbial metabolites, Prelog started working on these compounds, which possess unusual structures and interesting biological properties. It led him into antibiotics, and he subsequently elucidated the structures of such compounds as nonactin, boromycin, and rifamycins. For Prelog, natural products represented more than a chemical challenge. He considered them a record of billions of years of evolution.

In 1944 at the ETH, Prelog managed to separate enantiomers with &quot;asymmetric&quot; trivalent nitrogen by column chromatography at a time when this method was still in its infancy. His work on medium-sized alicyclic and heterocyclic rings established him as a pioneer in stereochemistry and conformational theory and brought an invitation to give the first Centenary Lecture of the Chemical Society in London in 1949. He synthesised medium-sized ring compounds with 8 to 12 members from dicarboxylic acid esters by acyloin condensation and explained their unusual chemical reactivity by a &quot;nonclassical&quot; strain because of energetically unfavorable conformations. He also contributed to the understanding of Bredt&#x27;s rule by showing that a double bond may occur at the bridgehead if the ring is large enough.

In his research of asymmetric syntheses, Prelog studied enantioselective reactions and established rules for the relationship between configuration of educts and products. From Prelog&#x27;s researches into the stereospecificity of microbiological reductions of alicyclic ketones and the enzymic oxidation of alcohols, he contributed not only to the knowledge of the mechanism of stereospecificity of enzymic reactions in general but also to the structure of the active site of the enzyme.

Specifying the growing number of stereoisomers of organic compounds became for Prelog one of his important aims. In 1954 he joined R. S. Cahn and Christopher Ingold in their efforts to build a system for specifying a particular stereoisomers by simple and unambiguous descriptors that could be easily assigned and deciphered: The CIP system (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog) was developed for defining absolute configuration using &quot;sequence rules&quot;. Together they published two papers. After Cahn and Ingold died, Prelog published a third paper on the topic. In 1959, Prelog obtained Swiss citizenship.

==Awards and honours==
Prelog was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1960 and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1961.

Prelog was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1962 for his contribution to the development of modern stereochemistry.

Prelog received the 1975 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research into the stereochemistry of organic molecules and reaction, sharing it with the Australian/British research chemist John Cornforth. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society the following year.

In 1986, he became an honorary member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts. Prelog was also a member of Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

==Personal life==
In 1933, Prelog married Kamila Vitek. The couple had a son Jan (born 1949).

An intellectual with a wide cultural background, Prelog was one of the 109 Nobel Prize winners who signed the peace appeal for Croatia in 1991.

Vladimir Prelog died in Zürich, at the age of 91. An urn containing Prelog&#x27;s ashes was ceremoniously interred at the Mirogoj cemetery in Zagreb on 27 September 2001. In 2008, a memorial to Prelog was unveiled in Prague.

<text>Philip Bruce Goff (born 22 June 1953) is a New Zealand politician and diplomat. He currently serves as High Commissioner of New Zealand to the United Kingdom since 2023. He was a member of the New Zealand Parliament from 1981 to 1990 and again from 1993 to 2016. He served as leader of the Labour Party and leader of the Opposition between 11 November 2008 and 13 December 2011.

During the Fifth Labour Government, in office from 1999 to 2008, Goff was a senior minister in a number of portfolios, including Minister of Justice, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Minister of Defence, and Associate Minister of Finance.

Goff was elected mayor of Auckland in 2016, and served two terms, before retiring in 2022.

==Early life==
Goff was born and raised in Three Kings, Auckland. His family was very poor, and his father wanted Goff to enter the workforce immediately after finishing high school. Goff, however, wished to attend university, a decision that caused him to leave home when only sixteen years old. By working at Westfield Freezing Works and as a cleaner, Goff was able to fund himself through university, gaining an MA (with first class honours) in political studies at the University of Auckland. In 1973, he was Senior Scholar in Political Studies, and also won the Butterworth Prize for law. While completing his MA, he lectured in Political Studies. After his overseas experience in Europe Goff returned to New Zealand where he became an Insurance Workers Union organiser.

==Member of Parliament==




Goff joined the Labour Party in 1969, the same year he left home, and held a number of administrative positions within the party. He was chairman of the Labour Youth Movement and was twice elected a member of the Labour Party&#x27;s national council. Goff was also campaign chairman for Eddie Isbey in the electorate.

In early 1981 Goff put himself forward for the Labour candidacy for the Roskill electorate. He beat 13 contenders (including Malcolm Douglas, Owen Greatbatch, Ken Hastings, Norman Kingsbury, Wayne Mapp and Lois Welch) to win the nomination on 23 April 1981. The next day he resigned his trade union job to be a candidate full-time. In the 1981 elections, Goff was elected Member of Parliament for the Roskill electorate. In 1983 he was appointed as Labour&#x27;s spokesperson for housing.

===Cabinet minister: 1984–1990===
Three years later, when Labour won the 1984 elections, Goff was elevated to Cabinet by Prime Minister David Lange, becoming its youngest member. He served as Minister of Housing and (from 1986) Minister for the Environment. As Minister of Housing Goff provided money to finance loans to households in dire financial situations and purchased state rental units. In the disputes during the Fourth Labour Government between Roger Douglas (the reformist Finance Minister) and other Labour MPs, Goff generally positioned himself on the side of Douglas, supporting deregulation and free trade.

After the 1987 elections, Goff dropped the Housing portfolio, but also became Minister of Employment, Minister of Youth Affairs, Minister of Tourism and Associate Minister of Education (with responsibility for tertiary education). Goff instigated changes to funding of tertiary studies incorporating financial contributions by students rather than the complete government funding that existed at the time. State funding was seen as unsustainable due to large increases in student numbers. The changes included direct fees and streamlined bursaries and student loans. The bursary changes were generally regarded to be fair and were also backed up by a government guarantee to banks willing to fund loans by students. As Minister of Employment Goff oversaw a large increase in unemployment which had risen to 128,000 people by November 1988. There were several protests and marches on Parliament where he faced and spoke to crowds of unemployed people. In response he committed $100 million to reinstate government subsidised training schemes to help the unemployed gain skills for new jobs.

Later, after a significant rearrangement of responsibilities in August 1989 following Lange&#x27;s resignation, Goff became Minister of Education under new Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer while relinquishing Employment and Youth Affairs. As Minister of Education he was against any further cuts to tertiary education threatening to resign if there were. He also inherited responsibility for the Tomorrow&#x27;s Schools reform initiative discovering budgeting errors and a staffing shortage that occurred under his predecessor in the portfolio (Lange). According to cabinet colleague Michael Bassett Goff, despite his best efforts, was never able to regain the initiative in education as a result of this.

===In opposition: 1990–1999===
In the 1990 elections, Labour was defeated, and Goff lost his parliamentary seat to the National Party&#x27;s Gilbert Myles. While many commentators blamed Douglas&#x27;s controversial reforms for Labour&#x27;s loss, Goff said that the main problem had been in communication, not policy. Goff was appointed to a position at the Auckland Institute of Technology, and later accepted a scholarship to study for six months at Oxford University. Returning to New Zealand, he eventually decided to stand for parliament once again.

In the 1993 elections, Goff was re-elected as MP for Roskill. Helen Clark, Labour&#x27;s new leader, made him the party&#x27;s spokesperson for Justice. In 1996, Goff was part of the group which asked Clark to step down as leader. Clark survived the challenge, and was advised by her allies to demote Goff, but chose not to do so.

Goff retained his seat in the 1996 elections, having elected not to be placed on Labour&#x27;s party list. In Opposition from 1996 to 1999, Goff was Labour&#x27;s spokesperson on Justice, and Courts &amp; Corrections. After Mike Moore left Parliament to become Director-General of the World Trade Organization Goff also became the party&#x27;s spokesperson for Foreign Affairs.

===Cabinet minister: 1999–2008===
In the 1999 elections, which Labour won, Goff accepted seventh place on the party list, but also retained his electorate seat. In the Clark lead Fifth Labour Government, he became Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Minister of Justice. He retained this position after the 2002 elections. Following the 2005 elections Winston Peters was made Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Goff was made Minister of Defence and Disarmament and retained the Trade portfolio.

In 2001 he was centred in the decision to take in 131 refugees from the MV &quot;Tampa&quot;. The ship had previously been denied entry to Australia by the government of John Howard, dubbed by media as the &quot;Tampa affair&quot;. In 2019, Goff stated he thought that New Zealand&#x27;s decision to take refugees from the &quot;Tampa&quot; was one of the best decisions made by the Fifth Labour Government. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks Goff offered New Zealand support to the United States and worked to locate New Zealanders in the area. In 2021 he stated that he felt a personal responsibility when he learned that two New Zealand nationals died in the attack. In October 2001 New Zealand joined the war in Afghanistan against the perpetrators of the attacks. Goff defended the use of air strikes as part of the invasion which the government stressed were targeted at terrorists and were justified under the United Nations Charter stating that they were &quot;regrettably necessary&quot;.

In 2003 the Labour government was critical of the American lead Invasion of Iraq which lacked an explicit United Nations mandate, and the New Zealand government withheld military action in the Iraq War. Despite not sending combat troops, the government sent some medical and engineering units to Iraq. In 2003 convicted rapist Stewart Murray Wilson doctored and distributed a letter from Justice Minister Goff, in an apparent attempt to get his case reviewed. In 2005, as justice minister, Goff passed legislation that dramatically strengthened laws condemning child pornography and child sex.

As Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister, Goff favoured free trade deals as a means of diplomacy and strengthening New Zealand&#x27;s links with Asian neighbours. Goff had a strong public profile and became one of the better-known members of the Labour Party; he was placed number three on the Labour Party list during the 2008 general election. Clark and Goff differed substantially in their economic policies, but they were able to work relatively well together, and this was shown during Goff&#x27;s signing of the New Zealand–China Free Trade Agreement. The free trade agreement with China took over three years to negotiate with the first round of negotiations being held in December 2004 before the FTA was signed after fifteen negotiation rounds took place. Goff signed the agreement on behalf of the New Zealand government together with the Chinese Minister of Commerce Chen Deming at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 7 April 2008. Under the agreement, 37 per cent of Chinese exports to New Zealand and 35 percent of New Zealand exports to China would become tariff free by October 2008, all tariffs for Chinese exports to New Zealand were to be eliminated by 2016, and 96 percent of New Zealand exports to China would be tariff free by 2019.

===Leader of the Opposition: 2008–2011===

At the 2008 election Labour was defeated, and Clark resigned as leader. Goff was widely tipped as her successor. Goff became leader after a special caucus meeting on 11 November 2008 with former senior minister Annette King was elected as deputy leader.

After initial strong popularity, Goff and Labour began to struggle in public opinion polls. A July 2011 poll showed support for the Labour Party at a 10-year low, at just 27%. This followed a leaked policy proposal for a capital gains tax, which the party&#x27;s critics suggested was unpopular with the electorate. Polls in 2011 also showed an increase in support for the Green Party.

In an October 2010 speech, Goff emphasised the &quot;Kiwi Dream&quot; of high-wage jobs, home ownership and social protection. He criticised the National Government for free-market economic policies that Goff argued were accentuating inequality; he attributed social inequality to societal problems such as drug abuse and obesity.

Both Goff and Prime Minister John Key said that they would not vote in the 2009 corporal punishment referendum. Goff said that the question &quot;Should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in New Zealand?&quot; was &quot;absolutely&quot; the wrong question, and that &quot;the question implies that if you vote &#x27;yes&#x27; that you&#x27;re in favour of criminal sanctions being taken against reasonable parents – actually nobody believes that.&quot;

In John Key&#x27;s Statement to Parliament in February 2010, the government announced its consideration of raising Goods and Services Tax from 12.5% to 15%. Goff opposed the raise, saying that &quot;GST increase will hurt families that are already struggling to make ends meet&quot;, and the Labour caucus set out on an &#x27;Axe the Tax&#x27; nationwide road trip. In May 2010 Goff suggested exempting fresh fruit and vegetables from GST. Key called the exemption of such items &quot;very bureaucratic&quot; and Goff&#x27;s announcement &quot;desperate&quot;.

In February 2010 a discussion document was released, proposing that 7,058 ha of land in national parks be opened up for mining. Outside Parliament Goff told protesters that he and Labour would oppose the proposals &quot;at every stage&quot;, and pledged to re-protect any land released from Schedule 4, should his party return to power.

===Parliamentary career after being leader: 2011–2016===

On 26 November 2011 the results of the general election were very poor for Labour, which lost 6.86% of the party vote and nine seats. Phil Goff stated that this &quot;wasn&#x27;t our time this time ... but our time will come again ... we&#x27;re a bit bloodied but not defeated.&quot; Three days after conceding defeat Goff and his deputy, Annette King announced they would be standing down from their leadership positions on 13 December, but would stay on in Parliament as electorate MPs. Goff became the fourth Labour leader, the first since the ousting of Arnold Nordmeyer in 1965, to leave the Labour Party leadership without ever becoming prime minister. Goff was succeeded as leader by David Shearer, who designated him Shadow Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Goff resigned from Parliament on 12 October 2016, necessitating a by-election in his electorate of Mount Roskill.

==Mayor of Auckland: 2016–2022==

On 22 November 2015 Goff announced he would run for Mayor of Auckland in the 2016 mayoral election. On 8 October 2016 Phil Goff won the election, becoming the second mayor of the Auckland &#x27;super city&#x27;.

Goff was formally sworn in as Mayor of Auckland at a ceremonial event at the Auckland Town Hall on 1 November 2016. Upon taking office, he pledged to tackle social issues in Auckland, such as homelessness, so that &quot;no one is left behind&quot;; he also highlighted a need for improved infrastructure and housing availability in order to address the social issues.

===Proposed Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux speaking event===
In early July 2018, Mayor Goff announced that the Auckland Council would not allow the far right Canadian activists Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux to use council premises on the grounds that they stirred up ethnic or religious tensions and promoted divisive views. Southern and Molyneux have drawn controversy in the past for their controversial views on feminism, gender, and Muslim immigration. The pair had booked the Bruce Mason Centre in Auckland&#x27;s North Shore for a talk on 3 August 2018. While the Auckland Peace Action activist group and the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand had objected to Southern and Molyneux&#x27;s planned talk, Goff&#x27;s decision was criticised by the promoter David Pellowe and human rights lawyer Craig Tuck for violating free speech. In addition, &quot;The Spinoff&quot; contributor and self-described agnostic Muslim Ali Shakir defended the Southern and Molyneux tour and disputed the FIANZ&#x27;s claim to speak for all Muslims on this matter. New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Winston Peters and National Party leader Simon Bridges said they would have supported her right to speak, while Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson said she supported the ban.

In response to Goff&#x27;s decision, a group calling themselves the &quot;Free Speech Coalition&quot; announced that it would be collecting funds for a judicial review of the decision to ban Southern and Molyneux from Council premises. This group consisted of several business leaders, academics, lawyers, and journalists including the former Labour President Michael Bassett, former National and ACT parties leader Don Brash, Property Institute chief executive Ashley Church, Auckland University of Technology historian Paul Moon, left-wing commentator Chris Trotter, and New Zealand Taxpayers&#x27; Union Jordan Williams. Within 24 hours, the group had reached its initial fundraising target of NZ$50,000.

On 18 July, Free Speech Coalition spokesperson David Cumin announced that the group had filed legal proceedings against Mayor Goff and the Auckland Council after a failed attempt to broker a deal with Goff and the council to reinstate the speaking event planned by Southern and Molyneux. On 25 July, the Free Speech Coalition withdrew their proceedings against Mayor Goff but warned that further legal action could go ahead. Goff welcomed the development and reiterated his opposition to allowing Council facilities to host events promoting hate speech. The Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway had earlier granted Southern and Molyneux a visa allowing them to visit New Zealand on the grounds that they had not violated any immigration character requirements.

===Serious Fraud Office investigation, 2020===
In late February 2020, the Serious Fraud Office announced that it was investigating an election expanses declaration of cash donations from fundraising auctions of $366,115 filed by Goff during the 2016 mayoral election.

On 7 April 2022, the Serious Fraud Office closed it investigation into Goff&#x27;s mayoral fundraising campaigns, stating that the matter has been closed. Goff&#x27;s mayoral campaign welcomed the Office&#x27;s decision to close the investigation and stated that the matter was resolved.

===Three Waters reforms===
In late October 2021, Goff joined several other mayors across New Zealand including Mayor of Christchurch Lianne Dalziel, Mayor of Wellington Andy Foster, Mayor of the Far North District John Carter, and Mayor of Dunedin Aaron Hawkins in opposing the Government&#x27;s &quot;Three Waters reform programme&quot;, which proposes taking away control of water utilities from local councils and placing them under the control of four new entities.

=== 2022 retirement===

On 14 February 2022, Goff announced that he would not seek re-election for a third term of Auckland mayoralty in September 2022, saying that he intended to retire after 41 years in politics. He stated that it was time to pass the baton on to a new generation, and endorsed Efeso Collins for mayor.

== High commissioner to the United Kingdom: 2023– ==
In October 2022, it was announced that Goff would take up the position of high commissioner of New Zealand to the United Kingdom in January 2023.

In May 2023, Goff caused offence to the Māori King Tūheitia Paki during an official function for the New Zealand delegation in London attending the coronation of King Charles III. Goff forgot to perform a karakia (Māori prayer) and remarked that nobody in the room had experienced a coronation. In response, Ngira Simmonds, a spokesperson for Tūheitia, pointed out that many of the New Zealand delegates had attended two coronations; namely that of King Tūheitia and his mother Queen Dame Te Atairangikaahu. Goff subsequently apologised to Simmonds for not following protocol. Prime Minister Chris Hipkins described Goff&#x27;s actions as regrettable but reaffirmed his Government&#x27;s commitment to the Crown–Māori relationship.

==Personal life==
Phil Goff is married to Mary Ellen Goff, whom he met in 1971 and married in 1979. They have three adult children. He lives on an farmlet in the rural Auckland suburb of Clevedon.

==Honours==
In the 2017 New Year Honours, Goff was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (CNZM), for services as a member of parliament.

<text>Viscount Melville, of Melville in the County of Edinburgh, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==Origins==

The title was created on 24 December 1802 for the notable lawyer and politician Henry Dundas. He was created Baron Dunira, &quot;of Dunira in the County of Perth&quot;, at the same time, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Dundas, who was the fourth son of Robert Dundas, of Arniston, the elder, declined an earldom in 1809.

He was succeeded by his son, the second Viscount, who was also a noted politician. He assumed for himself the additional surname of Saunders, which was that of his father-in-law. His son, the third Viscount, was a General in the British Army. The latter was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Viscount, who in his turn was succeeded by his nephew, the fifth Viscount, the eldest son of Reverend the Honourable Charles Dundas, Rector of Epworth, Lincolnshire, fourth son of the second Viscount. The fifth Viscount was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth Viscount, a minor diplomat. The titles descended from father to son until the death of the sixth Viscount&#x27;s grandson, the eighth Viscount, in 1971. The latter was succeeded by his nephew, the ninth Viscount, the eldest son of the Honourable Robert Maldred St John Melville Dundas, second son of the seventh Viscount. the titles are held by the ninth Viscount&#x27;s eldest son, the tenth Viscount, who succeeded in 2011.

The family seat is Melville Castle between Dalkeith and Lasswade. The first five viscounts (including Henry Dundas) are buried in a simple vault (gated but unlocked) in Old Lasswade Kirkyard. The 6th Viscount Melville, Charles Saunders Dundas, lies opposite his wife, Mary Hamilton Dundas, in the small north cemetery in Lasswade, adjacent to the old kirkyard. Their son, the 7th Viscount merely appears as a footnote on the monument.

<text>Kabul University (KU; ) is one of the major and oldest institutions of higher education in Afghanistan. It is in the 3rd District of the capital Kabul near the Ministry of Higher Education. It was founded in 1931 by King Mohammed Nadir Shah, whose prime minister at the time was his younger brother, &quot;Sardar&quot; Mohammad Hashim Khan. Approximately 22,000 students attend Kabul University. In August 2021, before the Taliban takeover, nearly half were female.

Since December 2022, Kabul University has been closed to women, like other public universities in Afghanistan, to comply with the Taliban&#x27;s education ban on women. In March 2023, women protested outside of the university&#x27;s entrance by reading their books.

== History ==

===Early history===
Kabul University was established in 1932 during the reign of King Mohammed Nadir Shah and during the government of Prime Minister Mohammad Hashim Khan, opening its doors one year later to students from across the country. It benefitted from partnerships with the governments of Turkey, France, Germany, and the United States.

The first Faculty of Medicine in Kabul was established by a group of Turkish professors of Medicine and Surgery led by Kamil Rıfkı Urga in 1932 in the region of Aliabad. The first teaching-university hospital, the Aliabad Hospital, was also built here on the campus under the guidance and supervision of Turkish architects and teaching physicians. In 1936, the Faculty of Law &amp; Political Sciences on the same campus was established by Turkish Mehmed Ali Dağpınar. The Faculty of Law started to enroll students of law.

The first attending Turkish professors of medicine and surgery who had gone to Afghanistan under an official agreement between the governments of Afghanistan and the Turkish Republic served at Kabul University between 1932 and 1952. The first president (rector) of Kabul University and dean of the Faculty of Medicine was a Turkish surgeon and anatomist, Urga, who taught medicine and surgery for a period of 17 years with 15 other Turkish physicians. Later on, some additional teaching staff, including French professor Pierre Bolange, attended as the dean of the Faculty of Medicine after the previous Turkish dean, Zuhtu Bey, left Kabul for Ankara in 1952. The first nine graduates of the Faculty of Medicine played significant roles in Afghanistan&#x27;s university community reforms; two of them were Muhammad Yusuf (the prime minister) and Fattah Najeem.

Initially, the university accepted only male students, but in 1950, it was opened to women as well.
In the 1960s, foreign-educated scholars populated the campus. Notable students influenced during this era included Ahmad Shah Massoud, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Dr. Faiz Ahmad, and Saydal Sokhandan. Many different political groups were influenced by the university, such as Khalqists, Parchamites, Sholayees, and Ikhwanists. In a clash between Ikhwanis and Sholayees, a poet named Saydal Sokhandan was killed by Hekmatyar in the 1970s. Saydal was fired upon and shot by Gulbuddin during an argument.

During the governance of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), Kabul University lost several lecturers and staff. The majority of the university&#x27;s faculty left during the ten-year period of unrest or civil war that followed the fall of the PDPA government in 1992. The area around the university and Karte Char was a major battleground in the Afghan Civil War (1992–1996).

=== 2001–2021 ===
After the removal of the Taliban government in late 2001, the international community focused on rebuilding the educational institutions in Afghanistan. By January 2004 the campus had only 24 computers. As part of its recovery program, the university has established partnerships with four foreign universities, including Purdue University and the University of Arizona. Furthermore, the Information Technology Center was founded in 2002 with the cooperation of German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and Technische Universität Berlin. The number of students in higher education had increased across the country from 22,717 in 2002 to 56,451 in 2008. By 2008, Kabul University was attended by 9,660 students, 2,336 (24%) of them being women.

It was reported in 2007 that Iran donated funds to the university&#x27;s dentistry faculty and donated 25,000 books. The main library of Kabul University, which was built by the United States. It is equipped with computers, books and magazines. Nancy Dupree, wife of Louis Dupree, was the Director of the Afghanistan Center at the university.

In 2008, the campus of Kabul University was provided with local network facilities by the Information Technology center of Kabul University (ITCK). Each building is connected to the campus network and is provided with the internet connection from a fiber optic backbone. The voice over IP (VoIP) technology was also part of the networking project.

At the beginning of 2020, Chancellor Babury has introduced a new program for the change and development of Kabul University.

On 19 July 2019, a car bomb exploded outside the university. It killed 8 people and injured another 33.

ISIL gunmen attacked the university on 2 November 2020, killing 35 and wounding 56. The attack occurred at around 11:00. Afghan security officials claimed they have arrested the person who instigated the attack. The three gunmen were killed by Afghan and American forces who came to the scene.

=== Since 2021 ===
Following the Fall of Kabul (2021), the university fell under Taliban control. The Taliban replaced Chancellor Mohammad Osman Babury, a longtime KU professor and expert on medicinal plants, with Mohammad Ashraf Ghairat, a Taliban fighter and former journalism student. Critics noted that Ghairat had no qualifications beyond running a small madrassah, and believes he was installed for his loyalty to the Taliban. At least 70 faculty members at the university resigned following Ghairat&#x27;s installation, with the remainder demanding the Taliban rescind the installation. Ghairat had pledged to &quot;rid Kabul University of Western and infidel thoughts&quot; and to impose a policy of segregation, stating, &quot;As long as real Islamic environment is not provided for all, women will not be allowed to come to universities or work. Islam first.&quot;

In October 2021, Ghairat was replaced by Osama Aziz, who holds a doctorate in Islamic Jurisprudence (Sharia law). classes were still suspended and research at the university had come to a standstill. Faizullah Jalal, a university worker and a critic of the Taliban, was arrested in 2022.

Kabul University reopened on 26 February 2022, with female students attending in the morning and males in the afternoon. Other than the closure of the music department, few changes to the curriculum were reported.

In December 2022, Kabul University banned women from attending.

<text>Viscount Sidmouth, of Sidmouth in the County of Devon, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 12 January 1805 for the former prime minister, Henry Addington. In May 1804, King George III intended to confer the titles of Earl of Banbury, Viscount Wallingford and Baron Reading on Addington (an earldom was the customary retirement honour for a former prime minister). However, Addington refused the honour and chose to remain in the House of Commons until 1805, when he joined William Pitt the Younger&#x27;s government as Lord President of the Council with the lesser title of Viscount Sidmouth. His grandson, the third viscount, briefly represented Devizes in Parliament. The current holder of the title is the latter&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the eighth viscount, who succeeded his father in 2005.

Anthony Addington, father of the first viscount, was a distinguished physician. Henry Unwin Addington, nephew of the first viscount, was a diplomat and civil servant.

The family seat now is Highway Manor (near Calne, Wiltshire) which was inherited in 1936. The former ancestral seat was Upottery Manor, near Upottery, Devon.

<text>The Klamath River (Karuk: Ishkêesh, Klamath: Koke, Yurok: Hehlkeek &#x27;We-Roy) is a long river in southern Oregon and northern California. Beginning near Klamath Falls in the Oregon high desert, it flows west through the Cascade Range and Klamath Mountains before reaching the temperate rainforest of California&#x27;s North Coast, where it empties into the Pacific Ocean. The Klamath River is the third-largest salmon and steelhead producing river on the west coast of the contiguous United States. The river&#x27;s watershed – the Klamath Basin – encompasses more than , and is known for its biodiverse forests, large areas of designated wilderness, and freshwater marshes that provide key migratory bird habitat.

Native Americans have used the river as a source of food and trade for thousands of years, and it continues to hold great cultural significance for tribes. Most lands along the upper Klamath were settled by Euro-Americans following exploration by fur trappers in the early to mid-19th century. Violent conflict and displacement of tribes occurred during the California Gold Rush as prospectors pushed into the lower Klamath basin, leading to a bitter fight over establishing reservation lands. In the early 20th century, the federal government drained the upper basin&#x27;s once extensive lakes and wetlands for agriculture, while private utilities constructed hydroelectric dams along the river. As salmon runs declined in the mid-20th century, tribes pushed for legal recognition of their senior water rights to support Klamath River fisheries, which have led to controversial reductions in irrigation water supply.

In the 21st century, the Klamath River hosts a wide variety of uses, including tribal subsistence fishing and ceremonies, recreational fishing and whitewater boating, and agricultural and domestic water supply. Starting in 1981, much of the Klamath River and its tributaries have been designated National Wild and Scenic Rivers. Four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River were demolished by October 2024, following almost two decades of negotiations between local representatives, tribes, conservation groups and the utility company operating the dams. This enabled salmon migration to the Upper Klamath Basin for the first time in over 100 years, and established new guidelines for Klamath water use to achieve a compromise between agricultural needs and fishery flows.

==Course==

The official beginning of the Klamath River is at Lake Ewauna, a small natural lake near Klamath Falls, Oregon. The primary inflow of Lake Ewauna is the short Link River, which connects it to Upper Klamath Lake. Upper Klamath, in turn, is fed by the Williamson River (originating in the Winema National Forest) and Wood River (originating in Crater Lake National Park). For the first below Lake Ewauna, the Klamath River takes a slow meandering course through what was formerly the Klamath Marshes, which were drained for agriculture in the early 20th century. An artificial channel diverts water from the Lost River, which normally flows into Tule Lake, into the Klamath during periods of high runoff.
Below Keno Dam (which controls the level of the upstream Klamath River and Lake Ewauna), the river flows swiftly through the narrow Klamath River Canyon, which cuts through volcanic rock of the southern Cascade Range. Entering Siskiyou County, California, it passes the former sites of four hydroelectric dams operated by PacifiCorp until their demolition in 2024. After passing under Interstate 5, the Klamath receives the Shasta River from the left then flows west into the Siskiyou Mountains (a sub-range of the Klamath Mountains), entering the Klamath National Forest. It receives the Scott River from the left, passing through Seiad Valley and Happy Camp. Turning south, it flows towards Somes Bar, where it receives the Salmon River from the left as it enters Humboldt County and the Six Rivers National Forest. After passing Orleans, the Klamath reaches Weitchpec, where it receives the Trinity River, its largest tributary, from the left. State Route 96 follows the Klamath River for from Hornbrook to Weitchpec.

Downstream of the Trinity River, the Klamath turns sharply northwest. The entire lower section of the river flows through coast redwood forests in the Yurok Indian Reservation. State Route 169 follows most of this section of the river, except for an unconstructed segment between river miles 8–23 (13–37 km) which is only accessible by boat. The river enters Del Norte County, where Highway 101 bridges it at the town of Klamath. The river empties into the Pacific Ocean at a tidal estuary near Requa, in an area shared by the Yurok Reservation and Redwood National and State Parks, about south of Crescent City.

==Watershed==

The Klamath River watershed, known as the Klamath Basin, drains parts of Klamath, Lake and Jackson Counties in Oregon and Siskiyou, Modoc, Trinity, Humboldt and Del Norte Counties in California. About 37 percent of the basin is in Oregon and 63 percent is in California. More than half of the Klamath Basin is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, on the Fremont, Winema, and Rogue River National Forests in Oregon and the Modoc, Klamath, Shasta-Trinity and Six Rivers National Forests in California. The Klamath Basin borders the Smith, Rogue and Umpqua River watersheds to the northwest, the Mad and Eel River watersheds to the southwest, the Sacramento River watershed to the southeast, and various closed basins of interior Oregon to the northeast.

Hydrologically, the Upper Klamath Basin is considered to be upstream from the former site of Iron Gate Dam, about from the river&#x27;s mouth. Most of the Upper Klamath Basin is in Oregon, with some parts extending south into California. Situated between the Cascades and the Oregon high desert and northwest of the Modoc Plateau, it features a semi-arid climate and is characterized by large, flat alluvial valleys separated by long mountain ridges. Elevations range from in the valleys to in the Cascades. The mountain ridges are forested, while the valleys mostly consist of wetlands or farmland. Although many streams flowing into Upper Klamath Lake derive their flow from snowmelt, its largest sources – the Williamson and Wood Rivers – are predominantly fed by large springs.

Upper and Lower Klamath Lakes and Tule Lake were once part of of connected wetlands, over three-quarters of which have been drained for agriculture. The Lost River basin, situated east and south of Klamath Falls, was historically a closed basin terminating at Tule Lake. During high water events, the Klamath River overflowed into Lost River Slough near Klamath Falls and flow into Tule Lake. A topographic constriction occurred further west at the Keno Reef, a bedrock barrier where water backed up during flood events and flowed south along Klamath Straits into Lower Klamath Lake. Since the 20th century, the Lost River and Lower Klamath Lake basins – as well as the neighboring Butte Valley–Meiss Lake basin – have been artificially altered to discharge floodwaters into the Klamath River via diversion dams and drainage facilities.

The Lower Klamath Basin, consisting mostly of mountains and coniferous forest, is located almost entirely in California except for the headwaters of a few tributaries that flow south from Oregon. The Klamath Mountains include numerous sub-ranges, with the Siskiyou Mountains to the north and west of the river, and the Marble Mountains and Salmon Mountains to the east and south. These mountains experience heavy winter snowfall, while summers are warm and dry with little precipitation. Closer to the coast, winters are cool with heavy rainfall, while summer temperatures are mild and often foggy. About 88 percent of the Klamath River&#x27;s total flow originates in the Lower Basin, even though it only accounts for 62 percent of the land area. The Trinity River is the largest sub-basin of the Lower Klamath; the main stem originates in the Trinity Alps west of Redding, while the South Fork Trinity River&#x27;s origin at North Yolla Bolly Mountain is the southernmost point in the entire Klamath Basin. Much of the Lower Klamath and Trinity River basins are bounded on the west by South Fork Mountain, which forms one of the longest continuous ridgelines in North America. South Fork Mountain defines much of the boundary between the Klamath Mountains and the Northern Coast Ranges.

Most of the Lower Klamath Basin is remote and rugged, with limited access routes. In California, SR 96 provides access to the entire stretch of the middle Klamath River from Hornbrook to the Trinity River, while SR 299 runs along the Trinity River between Willow Creek and Junction City. SR 169 follows most of the lower Klamath below the Trinity, except for an unconstructed segment between river miles 8–23 (13–37 km) which is only accessible by boat. Although the Lower Klamath Basin is almost entirely covered by mountains, there are also several prominent valleys used for agriculture. Shasta Valley in Siskiyou County is the largest, and is characterized by volcanic features such as basalt flows and lava caves. The Shasta River flows northwest through the valley from Mount Shasta, the highest point in the Klamath River basin at . Yreka and Montague are located within Shasta Valley. To the west is the smaller Scott Valley, which includes the towns of Fort Jones, Etna, Greenview and Callahan. Hayfork Valley and the community of Hayfork are located in Trinity County, while Hoopa Valley and the surrounding Hoopa Reservation are on the Trinity River in Humboldt County.

===Tributaries and sub-basins===

The below table lists major sub-basins of the Klamath River system. 

==Flooding==
The lower and middle sections of the Klamath River are vulnerable to flooding, and major floods have occurred in years where major flooding has taken place in Northern California, particularly in the wake of Pineapple Express storms that bring large amounts of warm rain to Northern California. Fort Ter-Waw, located at what is now the town of Klamath Glen, was destroyed by the flood in December 1861 and abandoned on June 10, 1862. Other significant floods on the Klamath River have occurred in 1926–1927, 1955, 1964, 1997, and 2005, in several cases changing the course of the river. The Christmas flood of 1964 was particularly devastating. The Klamath River reached flows of ,
with high water reaching , inundating the towns of Klamath and Klamath Glen under as much as of water, and destroying most of the Highway 101 bridge crossing the river. The highway bridge was rebuilt in a different location, though entrances to the old bridge still stand.

The mouth of the Klamath and nearby sections of the river are also susceptible to oceanic tsunami surges, and fatalities have occurred there during the 1964 Alaskan and 2011 Japanese tsunamis.

==Geology==
The Upper Klamath Basin, defined by the drainage area of the Klamath River above Iron Gate Dam, is a unique transitional area between the Cascade Range to the west and the Basin and Range Province of the northern Great Basin to the southeast. This region extends from the southern Lower Klamath Lake area into the Lost River and Upper Klamath Lake basins. Crustal stretching and block faulting created a topography with characteristics similar to both regions. Almost the entire basin is a graben region, bearing basin and range characteristics, formed by uplifting and subsidence along several north–south faults.

Pre-Quaternary, igneous and sedimentary rocks compose the Yonna Formation, which crosses much of the region and rises above the surface in large outcroppings of solid rock in many of the ridges. Underlying rocks are generally younger from east to west. The many ridges crossing the upper Klamath Basin divide it into valleys with up to of vertical relief, and drainage patterns generally follow the topography. An extensive geothermal system occurs deep underground within the upper basin, creating hot springs and artesian springs, but is not well understood. Further south, in the Shasta River area in Siskiyou County, much of the underlying rock is composed of lava flows issuing from the Mount Shasta volcanic region.

The same age pattern is true in the Cascade Range and Klamath Mountains that cover the western half of the Klamath River watershed. As the North American Plate moved slowly southwestward over the past 10 million years, successive oceanic terranes dating from the Cambrian to the late Jurassic were added to the bulk of the North American continent. There are four distinct terranes from west to east. While the coastal mountains date to less than 3 million years ago, the farther inland High Cascades are as old as 7.5 million years. Granite batholiths, overlying sedimentary rock, and volcanic rock were crumpled into the massif of southwestern Oregon and northwestern California. Instead of being diverted southwards, however, the Klamath continued to flow westward and created a steep-walled gorge through the rising range. One of these terranes brought with it a long north–south band of easily eroded mica that now lies about inland from the Pacific coast of Northern California. When the Klamath encountered this layer, it began cutting its canyon along the mica instead of continuing southwest to the Pacific, resulting in the sharp northward bend where the Trinity River joins. The lower Trinity also follows portions of the mica and its south fork as well.

==Indigenous peoples==

Human habitation on the Klamath dates to at least 7,000 years ago. Many of the Native American groups along the river depended on the huge runs of Pacific salmon, the third largest on the Pacific coast of what is now the United States. These groups included the Shasta along the middle and upper parts of the river, the Yurok, Hupa, and Karuk along the canyons of the lower river, and the Modoc, Klamath and Yahooskin in the desert valleys of the upper basin. About of the Klamath River, or half the river&#x27;s length, was on Shasta territory. The Yurok were the second most prominent group on the river, controlling about of the lower Klamath River and a large section of the Northern California coast. Along with the Hupa and Karuk, the lower to mid-upper Tribes caught salmon from the river with weirs, basket traps and harpoons. Ishi Pishi Falls, a set of rapids on the Klamath River near the confluence with the Salmon River, has been a traditional fishing ground for thousands of years. 

Tribes of the upper basin were primarily hunter-gatherers, and did not depend on salmon as much as downstream tribes. The Klamath River&#x27;s name was recorded by Europeans in the 19th century derived from the word &quot;klamet&quot; or the Klamath Tribe. Prior to European contact, the river was called by many different names, including &quot;Ishkêesh&quot; and &quot;Koke&quot;. The Klamath Tribe&#x27;s name came from the Upper Chinookan word &quot;/ɬámaɬ/&quot;,
literally &quot;they of the river&quot;.

The tribes along the Klamath River, in their hunting, fishing, and landscape stewardship practices, employed traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). Traditional ecological knowledge describes the type of natural science information that indigenous people have gathered about the places they live in over the course of hundreds, if not thousands, of years. It encompasses knowledge, beliefs, and practices that native people have accumulated through their immersive stewardship of the natural world. On the Klamath River, tribes have historically, and continue to, use traditional ecological knowledges and practices to care for and manage their landscape.

=== Tribes in the 21st century ===
The Klamath River tribes consist of the Klamath, Yurok, Karuk, Hupa, and Shasta. The movement of forced creation of reservations in the United States resulted in the loss of culturally, ecologically, and economically significant land of indigenous peoples. While many of them are federally recognized sovereign nations, they are still fighting to reclaim the land and resources that were taken from them. The Klamath River tribes mission statements include the preservation of their cultural heritage along with their land and the resources it provides. The Klamath River basin tribes are deeply connected and entwined with their land. The Klamath river, the food it provides and the spiritual significance it holds, is centrally situated in the identities of all four tribes that live along the Klamath.

==== Yurok ====
The Yurok tribe has almost 5,000 members, making it the largest federally recognized tribe in California. Federal recognition was given in 1855, in which the Yurok Reservation was created. Throughout the late 1800s, Yurok were moved to several newly established reservations, several of which were later destroyed or closed. The reservation covers around 63,000 acres along the coastal region of the lower Klamath River.

The Yurok people think of the Klamath river as &quot;the Bloodline: the life blood of the people&quot; relying on it for foods like salmon (ney-ouy), sturgeon (Kaa-ka), candlefish (kwor-ror), and seaweed (chey-gel’). These foods, specifically fish and specifically from the Klamath river are of utmost important to the culture and religion of the Yurok tribe. Located along the river are various villages important to specific ceremonial practices of the Yurok, like the Jump Dance or the annual Salmon ceremony. Yurok culture and religion emphasizes direct connection and communication with the Klamath river. Yurok cosmologies and oral histories emphasize the importance of the Klamath river and its salmon as a gift from the creator to provide for the Yurok people. &quot;Without this river we would not know who we are, where we’re from or where we’re going&quot; said an elder in the tribal community. For the Yurok people, the health of the river and the salmon is indicative of the health of the tribe, making the current policies surrounding river dams, and declining salmon populations deeply personal. Like with other Klamath Basin Tribes, an annual salmon ceremony takes place to honor and celebrate the salmon, which the Yurok people see as ancestors. The Yurok tribe’s ceremonies emphasize the Klamath River, and many traditional practices require close proximity to the river and include some type of bathing in or ingesting of the water. Recreational games are played on constructed &quot;courts&quot; along the river banks.

The cycle of life in the Yurok culture is closely tied to the Klamath and those who have passed away are thought to take one last boat ride upriver.

Like the Karuk, the Yurok language references the Klamath river in their descriptions of direction.

==== Karuk ====
The Karuk tribe recognized self-governance in 1994 and gained federal recognition in 1979. As the California legislature rejected treaties to create federal designated land, the Karuk peoples do not have a reservation. The Klamath Forest Reserve was created by the U.S. government in 1905 and claimed Karuk land as public land. Members have been working to reclaim parcels of their original land and place them in trusts.

The concept of World Renewal plays heavily into both Karuk and Yurok culture. Although the term &quot;world renewal&quot; was coined by anthropologist Kroeber and Gifford, the Karuk tribe has adopted the phrase to refer to their annual ceremony that they view as essential to maintaining the reciprocal and stewarding relationship they have with the environment. The ceremony is meant to renew and sustain this relationship. Many aspects of the larger ceremony involve being near or on the Klamath river, such as boat dances that take place in canoes and involve giving thanks and gratitude to the river. Salmon are an integral aspect of Karuk identity, culture, and subsistence. Karuk fisherman continue to sustainably fish for Salmon despite their decreasing numbers, drought and myriad other ecological issues. Ishi Pishi falls, located near the town of Somes Bar, remains the traditional location for Karuk men to fish. Karuk fishermen use a traditional dip-net fishing technique using long poles with nets on the end. This style of fishing works to naturally limit the amount of fish caught in a fishing session, thus ensuring that many salmon are able to spawn upstream and resupply the fishery.

The Karuk language also revolves around the Klamath River, and the word &quot;karuk&quot; means &quot;upriver&quot;. To indicate uphill, the word maruk is used, meaning away from the river. Conversely, the word saruk, meaning towards the river, is used to indicate downhill.

==== Hupa ====
The Hupa Valley Tribe is a federally recognized tribe with around 3,000 members. The reservation spans 80,000 acres and is the largest in California. It is located in the lower area of the Klamath River along the Trinity River. Around 3,000 people reside in the Hoopa Valley Reservation. Spanning around 85,000 acres, it is the largest reservation in California.

The Hupa Valley tribe hold similar ceremonial and religious beliefs regarding the river as the Yurok and Karuk people, including practices of jump dances and cultural/subsistence reliance on the Klamath&#x27;s salmon runs.

==== Shasta ====
Located in Northern California and Southern Oregon, the Shasta tribe is not federally recognized by the U.S. government due to the California legislature rejecting a treaty in 1851 that would have created a Shasta reservation. The tribe is currently in the process of gaining federal recognition.

Shasta people celebrate the first salmon of the season, which they think of as &quot;salmon medicine&quot; with ceremonies similar to the other Klamath basin tribes. Their relationship to the Klamath and its salmon was, and continues to be, deep-seated in their culture.

==== Klamath ====
The Klamath Tribes, consisting of the Klamath, Modoc, and Yahooskin-Paiute, are a federally recognized tribe with around 4,800 members. The Klamath and United States federal government created a treaty in 1864 (that was ratified in 1870) which gave the Klamath sovereign rights to the new reservation. However, through the 1954 Termination Act, federal aid to the tribes was halted. After losing federal recognition in 1954, they regained the status in 1986. They are dispersed across Southern Oregon and Northern California. The Klamath Reservation covers around 300 acres along the western coast.

The Klamath Tribes, made up of the Klamath, Modoc and Yahooskin-Paiute people, reside in the Klamath Basin but hold many of their sacred ceremonies along the Sprague River.  The Upper Klamath Lake, and its fish populations, is also an important cultural and subsistence location for the Klamath Tribes.

==== Management of national forests ====
In 1905, the United States Forest Service, an agency of the Department of Agriculture headed by Gifford Pinchot – a prominent conservationist and staunch opponent of burning – began to manage what was traditionally Klamath lands. The Forest Service oversaw extensive logging, mining, and dam construction, which degraded much of the environment, particularly salmon stocks and redwood forests. In 1947, the lower section of Karuk Aboriginal Territory was made part of the Six Rivers National Forest. In 1964, the first wilderness area in the Klamath basin was designated, effectively banning timber harvesting and road development in the area. Indigenous people were not allowed to steward their traditional territories because the Forest Service believed they would further deplete the damaged ecosystems. This led to a legal battle in 1970 over whether Klamath tribes could fish in these territories. Not until the late 1990s and early 2000s did the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management start collaborating with tribal peoples in the Offield Mountain Ceremonial Burning project and Tribal Forest Protection Act to incorporate traditional ecological knowledge and stewardship practices into land management.

==Exploration and settlement==
===Fur trade===
In the late 1820s, fur trappers of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company traveling south from Fort Vancouver reached the Klamath River basin. The first party to see the Klamath River was led by Alexander McLeod in the winter of 1826–27. In 1828, the Jedediah Smith fur trapping expedition was helped across the Trinity River by the Yurok and camped on the east side of the Trinity River. His clerk, Harrison G. Rogers, wrote, &quot;Mr. Smith purchases all the beaver furs he can from them,&quot; suggesting that beaver were then plentiful on the Trinity. Joseph Grinnell, in &quot;Fur-bearing Mammals of California&quot;, noted that beaver had been present on other Klamath River tributaries such as the Scott River and Shasta River, and further cited a Fish and Game report of beaver from 1915–1917 on High Prairie Creek at the mouth of the Klamath River near Requa, California. Fur trappers eventually moved southwest into the Sacramento Valley and extended the Siskiyou Trail, an early path between the Oregon Territory and San Francisco Bay. 

Within a matter of years, the plentiful beaver in the Klamath Basin had been mostly wiped out. Beaver dams had previously been an important factor in stream habitat in the Klamath River watershed, helping to moderate the power of floods and creating extensive wetlands. The loss of the beaver dams resulted in detrimental consequences for watercourses in the basin, exacerbating the power of winter floods, and causing severe erosion. Despite the environmental implications, extensive and fertile meadows left behind by the draining of beaver ponds attracted many settlers to the region later on.

===Gold rush===
The 1850s saw discoveries of rich placer and lode gold deposits along the predominantly Shasta areas of the Klamath, Trinity, Shasta and other rivers in northwestern California. The gold is thought to have originated from volcanic activity in the Klamath Mountains. Miners searching for gold in the Klamath Mountains and Trinity Alps in the aftermath of the California Gold Rush first discovered gold along Salmon Creek in the spring of 1850, and additional deposits were found on the main stem by July. Gold was also discovered in great quantities in Shasta lands at French Gulch and Yreka. 

The Gold Rush was the first large incursion into the Klamath River region, and conflict soon broke out between tribes and gold seekers. As miners established claims along the river, they forced indigenous peoples from their settlements and fishing grounds; many natives were killed, while others died of introduced diseases. Several place names in the Klamath Basin originate from this era, including that of the Scott River, which is named for pioneer John Walter Scott. Gold deposits are still present in the Klamath River watershed even though it was mined far past the end of the gold rush.

After the establishment of California in 1850, the state government signed treaties with the Karuk establishing aboriginal territories, but the treaties were never ratified in the senate and so the Karuk never got their own reservation land. In 1864, the Native Americans of the Klamath Basin and surrounding area signed a treaty that had them cede of land to the United States and forced them to move to the newly created Klamath Indian Reservation. This reservation clumped the Yurok, Karuk, and Hoopa tribes into one small area. These reservation lands were created as a result of wars between American settlers and indigenous peoples including the Red Cap War in 1855. The US government wanted to stop these violent clashes and relegate the indigenous people to limited territory where they could be sovereign. 

The reservation policy was reversed in 1887 with the Dawes Act which designated allotments to individuals of indigenous descent who could stake claim. However into the 1920s many of these individual land owners sold away their allotments to timber companies as they could not afford the taxes. Eventually, the tribes began to profit from the sale of timber produced on the reservation, although unfairly distributed because of the lack of consideration of the three differing tribes. In 1954, however, Congress removed their federal recognition and the reservation was no longer economically successful. The tribes won back federal recognition in the 1970s, but by then poverty was widespread among tribal members. Additionally more indigenous land was lost in the 1970s after the completion of the construction of a section of highway 96 which ran through traditional Karuk territory and paved over cemeteries, villages, spiritual sites and allotments.

=== Colonization and assimilation ===
One of the main Klamath tribal land stewardship practices of cultural burning was first disrupted with the beginning of Spanish colonization in California in the 1780s. Spanish colonization led to diseases, genocide, forced removal of indigenous people, relocation to missions, and laws banning burning in the region. In the 1840s many white Americans started moving west into the region with the Gold Rush. Many more members of the Klamath tribes were displaced or killed in the destruction of villages and a series of wars over territory, among other threats. Into the 20th century, many Klamath children were separated from their tribes and families and forced to attend boarding schools which attempted to assimilate the children by forcing them to speak English and dress in Western clothing and eat Western foods. This led to a generational disconnect and loss of knowledge of many cultural practices.

===Industry and development in the 20th century===

Beginning in the early 20th century, steamboats began operating on Lower Klamath Lake between Siskiyou County, California, and Klamath Falls, Oregon. The steamboats completed a link between Klamath Falls and a railroad branch line following the McCloud River—the final part of which was called the Bartle Fast Freight Road, after Bartle, California. The end of this line, Laird&#x27;s Landing, was the beginning of the Lower Klamath Lake steamboat line, which began operating with an screw steamer in 1905. By 1909, however, the railroad had circumnavigated Lower Klamath Lake directly to Klamath Falls. The steamboat line fell into disuse—and much of Lower Klamath Lake was later drained and filled in.

In the early 1910s and 1920s, logging was a growing industry on the west side of the upper Klamath River valley, especially around Upper Klamath Lake. The Great Northern Railway and Southern Pacific Railroad built a joint-use line running along the eastern shore of the lake, delivering logs from the north side to a sawmill downstream from the outlet of the lake. Many of the seasonal marshlands surrounding the lake and rivers were diked in this period to host lumber operations. In 1919, the first Link River Dam, a timber crib dam, was constructed at the outlet of Upper Klamath Lake, raising it by about . Steamboats continued mail, passenger and freight operations on Upper Klamath Lake until about 1928, in a period when many of the lumber companies shut down due to drought.

==Economic uses and water management==
===Irrigation===

About of farmland are irrigated in the Upper Klamath Basin, divided between the federal Klamath Irrigation Project located south of Upper Klamath Lake, and various local and private irrigation districts, mostly located north of the lake. In 1905, the Reclamation Service (today&#x27;s U.S. Bureau of Reclamation) was authorized to construct the Klamath Irrigation Project, to drain and reclaim for agriculture over of former lake beds and wetlands. The first homesteaders moved onto project lands in 1917, while expansions of the project continued into the 1940s.

The Klamath Irrigation Project includes of main canals, chief of which are the A Canal which delivers water south from Upper Klamath Lake, dividing into the B Canal which heads east towards the Lost River Valley and the C Canal which heads south towards Tule Lake Valley. A diversion channel was opened to carry floodwaters from the Lost River to the Klamath, and a tunnel excavated to drain the remaining waters of Tule Lake towards Lower Klamath Lake, where the Klamath Straits Drain conveys excess water back to the Klamath River near Keno. A cut was blasted through Keno Reef, the natural bedrock barrier that historically backed up floodwaters into Lower Klamath Lake. This enabled the near complete draining of both Tule and Lower Klamath Lakes.

Link River Dam (originally built as part of the Klamath Hydroelectric Project in 1921) controls the level of Upper Klamath Lake, creating the project&#x27;s main storage reservoir. The dam did not actually raise the water level, but was built within an artificial cut made in the lake&#x27;s outlet, enabling water to be released consistently from deeper levels. Prior to the cut, south winds sometimes pushed water out of the lake&#x27;s shallow outlet, causing the Link River to run dry – a phenomenon reflected in the stream&#x27;s native Klamath name, &quot;Yulalona&quot;, &quot;back and forth&quot;. The project includes two other storage facilities at Clear Lake Dam on the Lost River and Gerber Dam on Miller Creek (a tributary of Lost River). Parts of Lower Klamath and Tule Lakes are designated as sumps, reserved for flood control and drainage.

In normal precipitation years, the Klamath Irrigation Project delivers of water to farmers, although this can be substantially less in drought years. The main crops grown on the Klamath Irrigation Project are grain, alfalfa, onions, potatoes and grass seed, as well as irrigated pasture for cattle. In 2011, crops grown on the Project were valued at about $204 million.

===Water rights===

Because most precipitation falls in the Lower Klamath Basin while most agricultural demand occurs in the Upper Basin, the latter suffers from frequent water shortages. Traditionally, water rights have been determined by prior appropriation, as in the case of most of the western US. In 1957, California and Oregon signed the Klamath River Compact, which gave preference to the &quot;higher uses&quot; of domestic and irrigation water supply, over the &quot;lower uses&quot; of recreation, fish and wildlife, industry and power generation. Among other requirements, the Compact established that all water diverted from the upper Klamath River must be used within the Upper Klamath Basin. No such restriction applies to the Lower Basin. In addition, the Compact does not impact water rights vested prior to 1957.

In Oregon, the Klamath Basin Adjudication (KBA) – legal validation of pre-1909 water claims – is an ongoing process. This has had significant consequences for water management in the Upper Klamath Basin, as the Klamath Tribes were guaranteed water for hunting and fishery purposes in the 1864 treaty establishing their reservation. Even though the Klamath were forced to surrender treaty lands in the mid-20th century, the tribes&#x27; water rights were upheld in a 1983 court decision (&quot;United States vs. Adair&quot;), and Oregon formally quantified their share in 2012. The Klamath Tribes independently exercised their water rights for the first time in 2013, a drought year, when a &quot;water call&quot; reduced irrigation diversions to maintain sufficient river flow for fisheries. 

During a severe drought in 2001, federal water deliveries to farmers were temporarily halted to satisfy Endangered Species Act requirements and tribal fisheries. A group of farmers sued the U.S. government for $30 million in lost income caused by the 2001 irrigation shut-off (&quot;Baley v. United States&quot;). In 2017, the Court of Federal Claims ruled in favor of the government, as the water restrictions had been enacted, in part, on behalf of the tribes&#x27; senior water rights. Klamath Project customers were only entitled to receive water after the tribes&#x27; water rights had been met, so the government was not responsible for damages. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case in 2020, thus cementing the lower court&#x27;s decision.

===Interbasin transfers===
Several projects have been constructed to divert water out of the Klamath Basin for use in other parts of California and Oregon. The Trinity River Division of the Bureau of Reclamation&#x27;s Central Valley Project consists of Trinity and Lewiston Dams on the upper Trinity River, and a series of tunnels and power plants that convey water to the Sacramento River. Starting in 1963, these works directed about per year out of the Trinity River, representing about one-tenth of the total runoff of the Klamath-Trinity River system. Trinity River water was a key factor in the development of the Westlands Water District, today one of the most productive agricultural areas in California, on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley. From 1987 to 2000, Trinity River diversions averaged , as greater amounts of water were released to the Trinity River for fisheries restoration. 

The Rogue River Basin Project provides water for the Rogue River Valley around Medford, Oregon. The Fourmile Lake Dam and Hyatt Dam, which divert water from tributaries of the Klamath River into the Rogue River system, were originally built by private irrigation companies in the 1920s. In 1954, the Bureau of Reclamation was authorized to expand the project. Howard Prairie Reservoir, in the upper part of Jenny Creek watershed, was completed in 1959. The Bureau also constructed Green Springs Power Plant, which generates power using water diverted from Jenny Creek, and rehabilitated and expanded other existing reservoirs and canals. An annual average of are diverted from the Klamath Basin to the Rogue River Valley. 

The Klamath&#x27;s plentiful flow at its mouth has long been of interest to more populous parts of California, which often experience water shortages. In a 1951 report titled the United Western Investigation, the Bureau of Reclamation proposed building the enormous Ah Pah Dam that would have diverted almost the entire flow of the Klamath and Trinity Rivers to Southern California. It would have flooded most Yurok and Hupa lands along the river, but the government mostly ignored objections raised by the tribes. However, the dam was opposed by one of its chief beneficiaries – the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, representing Los Angeles and numerous other cities – who believed that the Klamath project would be used to pressure it into giving up its share of the Colorado River. As such, the project was scrapped due to lack of political support.

In the 1960s, the California Department of Water Resources also looked to the Klamath River as a supply for the State Water Project. Its own North Coastal Area Investigation in 1964 contemplated damming the Klamath, Trinity, Eel, Van Duzen and Mad Rivers to direct – comparable to the entire flow of the Colorado River – to agricultural and urban areas in central and southern California. About half of this would come from the Klamath River alone. As the environmental movement strengthened in the late 1960s, public pressure mounted to protect California&#x27;s remaining undammed rivers. In 1972, the state designated the Klamath River downstream of Iron Gate Dam as a wild and scenic river, and in 1981 it was incorporated into the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, making it off-limits to new dams.

===Hydroelectricity===

The oldest hydroelectric plant in the Klamath Basin is the Fall Creek power plant, built in 1903 by the Siskiyou Electric Power Company. This dammed a small tributary of the Klamath River to provide power for Yreka and Dunsmuir, California. In 1911, the California-Oregon Power Company (Copco) acquired Siskiyou Electric and the Fall Creek plant. In 1917, Copco entered a partnership with the Reclamation Service to construct and operate the Link River Dam. While the dam&#x27;s primary purpose was to store water in Upper Klamath Lake for the Klamath Irrigation Project, Copco would benefit from its regulation of the river flow, as it planned to build several power dams downstream in the Klamath River Hydroelectric Project.

In 1918, the Copco #1 Dam was constructed in Ward&#x27;s Canyon, a steep and narrow stretch of the Klamath River just south of where it enters California. Copco #2 Dam was constructed just downstream in 1925. It diverted water into a penstock, bypassing and dewatering of the river. In 1920, Copco acquired another private hydroelectric plant at Keno, and in 1931 it built the Needle Dam there to regulate outflows from Link River Dam. Needle Dam was replaced by the modern Keno Dam after damage from flooding in the winter of 1964–65.

J.C. Boyle Dam, located between Keno and Copco #1 in Oregon, was completed in 1958. Its penstock and power plant bypassed and dewatered another of the river. In 1961, Copco merged into Pacific Power and Light (PP&amp;L), now known as PacifiCorp. In 1962, PP&amp;L constructed Iron Gate Dam, just downstream of Copco #2. Its main purpose was to re-regulate power releases from the Copco dams and provide a more steady flow downstream. Prior to Iron Gate&#x27;s construction, discharge from the Copco dams fluctuated greatly due to peaking power operation, creating hazardous conditions for fishermen and other people using the river. 

Before their removal in 2023–24, the J.C. Boyle, Copco #1, Copco #2 and Iron Gate Dams had a combined generating capacity of 163 megawatts, representing about 1.5 percent of PacifiCorp&#x27;s total energy portfolio. Following the dam removal, PacifiCorp would continue to operate the Fall Creek power plant, while ownership of the Link River and Keno Dams was officially transferred to the Bureau of Reclamation. As of 2024, the aging power generators at Link River Dam are planned to be decommissioned, although the dam itself will remain.

==Ecology==
===Wildlife and plants===

During the 19th century, the Upper Klamath Basin&#x27;s abundance of wetlands and wildlife led explorers to call it a &quot;western Everglades&quot;. Despite the great reduction in wetlands over the 20th century, the Upper Klamath Basin still hosts large concentrations of migrating waterfowl, with as much as 80 percent of birds along the Pacific Flyway passing through. The five units of the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge Complex provide feeding and resting grounds for 3 to 5 million ducks, geese and other waterfowl each year. The area also hosts the largest wintering bald eagle population in the contiguous US. These areas also provide habitat for large mammals such as deer, elk, antelope, bear and cougar; fur-bearers including muskrat, beaver and mink; and upland game birds such as doves, pheasant, grouse and quail. The Lower Klamath Lake unit, established by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1908, is the oldest federal waterfowl refuge in the US. 

The Lower Klamath Basin is mostly within the Klamath Mountains ecoregion, which is &quot;widely recognized as an important biodiversity hotspot&quot; due to its location adjacent to Cascades, Sierra Nevada and Coast Range ecoregions. The area includes 3,500 plant species, including over 200 endemic species, many associated with serpentinite soils that are toxic to other plants. The area is known for its conifer diversity, with 29 identified species ranging from coastal redwood forests to inland mixed-conifer forests dominated by Douglas-fir, sugar pine, ponderosa pine, incense cedar, Jeffrey pine and white fir, while upper elevations include Shasta red fir, mountain hemlock, foxtail pine and western white pine. Oak woodlands and shrublands occur at lower elevations, while many exposed ridgetops are grasslands, locally called prairies. 

===Fish===

The Klamath Basin provides important habitat for anadromous salmonids, particularly Chinook salmon, coho salmon and steelhead trout, which spend their adult lives in the ocean but return to freshwater streams to spawn. The Klamath River system is the third-largest producer of salmon on the west coast of the contiguous United States, after the Columbia and Sacramento Rivers. Before the mid-19th century, 650,000–1,000,000 salmon and steelhead were estimated to spawn in the Klamath each year. Chinook alone numbered up to 800,000, split between fall and spring runs. Before damming, Chinook and steelhead once spawned as far upstream as the Williamson and Sprague Rivers that flow into Upper Klamath Lake. Coho and the anadromous Pacific lamprey spawned nearly as far upstream as Keno, where a naturally occurring constriction and falls (now the site of Keno Dam) prevented further progress. This may have also been a barrier for Chinook and steelhead during low water years. There are some historical accounts of a sockeye salmon run, which disappeared after dam construction. However, kokanee salmon (landlocked sockeye) are still present in Upper Klamath Lake. Small numbers of chum salmon also spawn in the river&#x27;s lower reaches.

Both the upper and lower Klamath River have resident rainbow, redband, brook and brown trout. Above Upper Klamath Lake, clear spring-fed river systems such as the Williamson and Wood Rivers provide cold water year round and good trout habitat. Bull trout were once widespread throughout both the Upper and Lower Klamath Basins, but today are limited to a few streams above Upper Klamath Lake. Eulachon and green sturgeon were historically common in the lower Klamath River, with much smaller populations today. The Klamath Lake sculpin, Klamath River and Pit-Klamath brook lamprey, Klamath tui chub and blue chub are common in the Upper Klamath Basin. The endangered shortnose sucker and Lost River sucker are endemic to the upper Klamath Basin. Reservoirs and lakes in the Upper Basin host many species of nonnative warm-water game fish, including yellow perch, brown bullhead, and pumpkinseed.

In California, commercial and tribal fishing in the Klamath were banned in 1934 as salmon runs declined. In 1972, following the controversial arrest of a Yurok subsistence fisherman, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Mattz v. Arnptt&quot; that the state did not have jurisdiction over tribal fisheries, as Indian reservations were created by federal executive order. In 1977 the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs took over management of the tribal fishery and reopened the lower river to fishing, but it was closed again the next year after conservation groups objected. From 1985 to 2011, ocean fishing for Chinook salmon was also restricted off the California and Oregon coasts. In 1986, the Klamath Fishery Management Council was established to monitor fish populations and recommend annual harvest limits; the following year, it reopened the river to tribal and commercial fishing for adult fall Chinook. After another brief closure from 1991–1993 the Department of the Interior revised fishery allocations, setting the tribes&#x27; share at 50 percent.

===Environmental issues===
Gold mining, dam construction, commercial fishing, logging and other human activities heavily damaged anadromous fish runs in the 19th and 20th centuries. The construction of Copco No. 1 Dam in 1918 blocked fish migration to more than of streams in the Upper Klamath Basin. This dam was built without fish ladders after Copco agreed with the state of California to construct fish hatcheries at Iron Gate and Lewiston as a mitigation measure. Starting in 1963, the Central Valley Project diverted most of the upper Trinity River&#x27;s flow to the Sacramento Valley, and cut off an additional of streams in the Trinity watershed. While most of the Klamath River&#x27;s annual water volume originates in the Lower Basin, the Lower Basin experiences a greater seasonal variation in runoff than the Upper Basin, and thus upstream water diversions can have a substantial impact on downstream river levels at certain times of the year. Outflow from the Upper Basin accounts for only 15 percent of flow at the river&#x27;s mouth in the winter and spring, but about 40 percent during summer and fall. This can result in critically low river levels during drought years when irrigation demand is high.
By 1992, the fall Chinook run had collapsed to just 26,700 spawning adults. This was attributed largely to Central Valley Project diversions on the Trinity River, where salmon numbers had fallen 80 percent since 1963. The Hupa and Yurok Tribes contended that increased instream flows were needed to save the fishery. In 1991, Congress passed the Central Valley Project Improvement Act, directing the Bureau of Reclamation to increase minimum Trinity River flows over a five-year period. The Trinity River Restoration Program was established in 2000, solidifying plans for permanently increased flows. With restoration efforts, the fall Chinook run recovered to 150,000 per year by the 2010s, with the Klamath, Trinity, Salmon, Scott and Shasta rivers all hosting spawning populations. 

Spring-run Chinook have continued to decline, averaging less than 2,000 per year in the early 21st century, and are considered at risk of extirpation. The only remaining spawning populations are in the Salmon and South Fork Trinity Rivers. Hybridization with hatchery fish has been a major concern for wild spring-run Chinook in the 21st century. In 2021, the state of California recognized Klamath spring-run Chinook as endangered. Klamath River coho, which spawn only in the fall, have been listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act since 1997. While most of the natural range of Klamath coho has never been blocked by dams, they have been impacted more severely by habitat degradation related to mining and logging, as they spend more time in freshwater than Chinook.

After the controversial 2001 Klamath Irrigation Project water shut-off, Vice President Dick Cheney intervened to ensure water supply to farmers. In 2002, the government made water deliveries on the project despite the drought continuing. The lower Klamath River experienced a mass die-off of at least 34,000 adult Chinook salmon in September 2002, which was attributed to atypically low flows that delayed salmon migration and high water temperatures that allowed massive spread of ich and columnaris among the waiting fish. The House Natural Resources Committee investigated Vice President Cheney for having released extra water to farmers for political gain. In 2006, a federal judge ordered the Klamath Irrigation Project to maintain higher river releases to protect fisheries.

During dry seasons, the lower Klamath River also experiences elevated phosphorus and nitrogen levels from irrigation run-off, while toxic algae blooms result in eutrophication. These issues were exacerbated by the river&#x27;s dams, which by slowing flows and exposing more water to solar heating created ideal conditions for algae bloom formation. In 2005, PacifiCorp began the mandatory 50-year Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) relicensing process for its dams on the Klamath. Tribes and conservation groups opposed the relicensing, arguing that the dams should be removed. FERC ruled that as part of the relicensing, PacifiCorp must install fish ladders on the dams. In 2009 PacifiCorp terminated the relicensing process, remarking that retrofitting the dams would be too expensive and tearing them down made more financial sense.

===Dam removal===

In 2010, the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement was signed by nearly 50 parties including farmers, tribes, fishermen, conservation groups, and government agencies. This established a framework to address future water rights disputes in the Klamath Basin, and called for the removal of the four lower dams of the Klamath Hydroelectric Project (J.C. Boyle, Copco #1, Copco #2 and Iron Gate). The Link River and Keno Dams, which have fish ladders, would remain. In 2013, the U.S. Department of the Interior released its final environmental impact statement on the plan. The Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement was enacted in 2016, outlining the regulatory procedures needed to remove the dams, increase flows for fisheries, maintain irrigation water and power supply, reintroduce salmon to the Upper Klamath Basin, restore habitat impacted by the dams, and provide economic assistance to counties, tribes and residents impacted by dam removal. 

In 2020, the states of California and Oregon, the Yurok and Karuk Tribes, PacifiCorp, and the newly created Klamath River Renewal Corporation (KRRC) signed a final Memorandum of Agreement to implement the project. This formally requested the federal government to transfer the dams&#x27; licenses to KRRC, which would oversee the removal with Kiewit Construction as the primary contractor. The project&#x27;s $450 million cost would be borne mostly by PacifiCorp customers and the state of California, with Oregon contributing only to contingency funding. 

The first dam to be removed was Copco No. 2 in October 2023. The reservoirs behind Iron Gate, Copco No. 1 and J.C. Boyle dams were drained in January-March 2024, and the dams themselves were demolished by August 2024. This represents the largest dam removal project conducted in the US to date. During and immediately after the removal process, the river experienced a temporary drop in water quality and increase in turbidity as accumulated sediments behind the dams were flushed out. In March 2024, a large die-off of hatchery Chinook salmon occurred when they were released upstream of Iron Gate Dam. The fish are believed to have succumbed to gas bubble disease when they passed through the temporary diversion tunnel used to drain Iron Gate reservoir; water flowing through the tunnel had a much greater level of turbulence than expected.

Restoration work was already ongoing prior to and during dam removal, and is planned to continue for several years afterward. Restoration is being conducted by Resource Environmental Solutions (RES) under the direction of KRRC. This involves revegetating of newly exposed land in drained reservoirs, stabilizing sediment to prevent erosion, restoring the river&#x27;s main channel as well as of tributaries within the reservoir zones to improve fish passage, and monitoring water quality all the way to the river&#x27;s mouth. On October 17, 2024, the first fall-run Chinook salmon was observed in the Upper Klamath Basin in Oregon.

==Recreation==

Whitewater rafting and kayaking are popular recreational activities along the upper Klamath River below the J.C. Boyle Dam, and also along the lower Klamath River downstream of the town of Happy Camp. There are long stretches—over in one instance—of Class I–II whitewater rapids, while there are some Class III–IV rapids in some of the narrower stretches. The most popular section for whitewater rafting is below Happy Camp, from Indian Creek to Coon Creek. Beyond Weitchpec, the river slows down into a wider, deeper channel. About of the river is designated Wild, and Recreational.

Sport fishing is also popular on the Klamath River, with steelhead trout being the most popular, though Chinook salmon are also highly sought after when low salmon returns do not prevent fishing. A fly fishing guide said that the Klamath was one of the most productive steelhead rivers on the West Coast of the United States.

Recreational gold mining is popular along the Klamath and some of its tributaries, including the Salmon and the Trinity. Although simple methods such as panning are still used, some methods use suction pumps—a practice involving turning over deposits of sediment and spreading them in order to find gold. Debates over the practice, which opponents contend damage water quality (mercury) and fish habitat, continue. Since at least 2016, suction dredge mining is banned in California.

A variety of national forests and wildlife preserves—including the Klamath National Forest, Six Rivers National Forest, Klamath National Wildlife Refuges Complex, and Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge—are located in the Klamath River watershed. The Klamath National Forest is located in Siskiyou County with a small portion in Oregon, and Six Rivers National Forest is located in the southern Klamath watershed, mostly in the Trinity River watershed. The latter two are located in the Upper Klamath Lake-Lower Klamath Lake area. Lava Beds National Monument, which contains a large array of lava tubes and formations, is also in the Lower Klamath Lake area, to the south of the remnants of the lake.

Prior to its 2024 removal, Iron Gate Dam was the lowermost dam on the Klamath River and effectively cut off migration and spawning habitat of 675 to 970 km of spawning and rearing habitat in the Upper Klamath Basin. Once the Upper Klamath Basin is opened up for salmon migration this will create a more diverse river ecosystem, providing more opportunities for recreational fishing and new economic opportunities like guided salmon fishing tours. Also opportunities for ecotourism can be maintained to view and help conserve a new habitat for salmon in the Upper Klamath Basin.

=== Klamath Salmon Festival ===
An annual festival takes place along the Klamath River to honor the mighty salmon by Yurok people. The Klamath Salmon Festivals are usually in August and include games, meals, parades, and other ways of celebrating.

<doc id="471442" wikidata="Q366373" url="?curid=471442" title="Li Hongzhi">
<text>Li Hongzhi (; born 1951 or 1952) is a Chinese religious leader. He is the founder and leader of Falun Gong, or &quot;Falun Dafa&quot;, a United States–based new religious movement. Li began his public teachings of Falun Gong on 13 May 1992 in Changchun, and subsequently gave lectures and taught Falun Gong exercises across China.

In 1995, Li began teaching Falun Gong abroad, and settled as a permanent resident in the United States in 1998. Li&#x27;s Falun Gong movement gained significant popularity in the 1990s, including in government and qigong circles, but was suppressed by the Chinese government in 1999 after it was officially accused of being a doomsday cult. According to Freedom House, &quot;Today, Chinese citizens who practice Falun Gong live under constant threat of abduction and torture. The name of the practice, its founder Mr. Li Hongzhi, and a wide assortment of homonyms are among the most censored terms on the Chinese internet. Any mention in state-run media or by Chinese diplomats is inevitably couched in demonizing labels.&quot;

Li has been also associated with performance arts group Shen Yun (&quot;Divine Rhythm&quot;), and the media organizations &quot;The Epoch Times&quot; and New Tang Dynasty Television, which operate as extensions of Falun Gong. They have promoted Falun Gong&#x27;s philosophical beliefs and unfounded conspiracy theories. Li has stated that he believes extraterrestrial aliens from other dimensions walk the Earth and are responsible for introducing technology, war, and immorality. Li says that he is a being who has come to help humankind from the destruction it could face as the result of rampant evil. When asked if he was a human being, Li replied &quot;You can think of me as a human being.&quot;

==Early life==
There are competing accounts of Li&#x27;s life that surfaced before and after the suppression of Falun Gong began in July 1999, and there is very little authoritative information on his early life. Accounts between Li&#x27;s supporters and detractors diverge significantly, and as a result, can be understood within the context of the political and spiritual purposes for which different narratives were developed.

===Hagiography===
An unofficial biography appeared in the first of Li&#x27;s major publications, &quot;Zhongguo Falun Gong&quot;, and was written by journalist Zhu Huiguang. A second, official spiritual biography appeared in early editions of Falun Gong&#x27;s primary text, &quot;Zhuan Falun&quot;, and was written by the Falun Dafa Research Society. As such, this account can be understood as part of Li&#x27;s (and his religion&#x27;s) publicity campaign against the People&#x27;s Republic of China. These biographies placed emphasis on Li&#x27;s spiritual development, with minimal details on Li&#x27;s ordinary work or family life. The style and content of these biographies is consistent with the &quot;centuries-old tradition of religious biography in China.&quot; As Benjamin Penny wrote, &quot;as with its precursors [in Chinese history], this biography seeks to establish a genealogy of the figure whose life is recorded and to buttress the orthodoxy of his doctrine.&quot; Both biographies were omitted from later printings of Falun Gong books, as Li explained that he did not want people to focus their attention on his own history or circumstances.

These biographies state that Li was born in the town of Gongzhuling, Jilin Province. The first account, by Zhu Huiguang, stated that Li&#x27;s family lived amidst poverty. In this edition, Li was described as developing a &quot;spirit of bearing hardships and tolerating hard work&quot; as he helped care for his younger siblings. The second, official version of his biography emphasized Li&#x27;s average social background, stating that he belonged to an &quot;ordinary intellectual&#x27;s family&quot;.

Both biographies ascribe to Li innate virtues of compassion and discipline. The official biography focuses mainly on the lineage of Daoist and Buddhist masters who it says provided Li with instruction from an early age. At four, he was trained by Quan Jue, the Tenth Heir to the Great Law of the Buddha School. By age eight, he had acquired &quot;the superb great law with supernatural powers,&quot; which was supposed to include invisibility, levitation, etc. Master Quan left him at age twelve, to be replaced by Taoist master Baji Zhenren, who provided instruction in martial arts and physical skills.

A third Master arrived in 1972 from the Great Way School. Zhendaozi came from the Changbai Mountains near the North Korean border. Unlike Li&#x27;s other spiritual tutors, Zhendaozi wore ordinary attire, and taught Li the way of inner cultivation through &quot;Qigong&quot;, stressing &quot;xinxing&quot; (i.e. &quot;mind or heart nature, moral character&quot;). Li&#x27;s training in this period mostly took place under cover of night, possibly due to the political environment of the Cultural Revolution. Zhu Haiguang&#x27;s version of the biography notes that Li consistently refused to take part in the campaigns of the Cultural Revolution, never joining the Red Guards or communist organizations.

A fourth Master—a woman from the Buddha School—began instructing Li in 1974. After training with these four Masters, Li&#x27;s &quot;energy potency had reached a very high level.&quot; His personal development plateaued around this time, with the biography stating that Li was able &quot;to see the truth of the universe, many more beautiful things which have existed there for a long time, as well as the origin, development and future of mankind.&quot;

In 1982, Li moved to the city of Changchun for &quot;civilian employment,&quot; the implication being that his previous work was with the military. At some point in the 1980s, Li married and had a daughter.

In 1984, Li began synthesizing the teachings he received into what would become Falun Dafa. The practice would not be exactly the same as what had been transmitted to him, as those systems were not suitable to be &quot;popularised on a large scale.&quot; Li began observing the teaching methods of other qigong masters, and by 1989 had finalised his qigong system. For the next three years until 1992, Li was said to have begun testing the system with a small group of students.

Falun Gong books published after 1999 no longer contain biographies of Li. These changes reflected a larger trend of Li retreating from the public eye. Since 2000 he has rarely appeared in public, his presence being almost entirely electronic or re-routed through quotations on Falun Gong&#x27;s websites. Li Hongzhi&#x27;s biography was removed from Falun Gong websites some time after 2001.

=== Details published by Chinese government ===
The Chinese government began publishing biographies of Li after the suppression of Falun Gong began in July 1999. As such, details on Li&#x27;s life published in the PRC can be understood as part of the government&#x27;s publicity campaign against Falun Gong. Their objective was to &quot;demonstrate that Li Hongzhi was thoroughly ordinary and that his claims to exceptional abilities and experiences were fraudulent.&quot;

Li was born in 1951 or 1952. His parents divorced whilst he was a toddler, and Li and his siblings remained with his mother. In 1955 they relocated to Changchun.

Li is said to have attended primary and middle school in Changchun between 1960 and 1970. As with most school-aged children in China, Li&#x27;s formal education was interrupted by the Cultural Revolution. He did not attend high school, but ultimately completed high school through correspondence courses in the 1980s. Chinese government accounts emphasize repeatedly that Li lacks a higher education, and was an undistinguished student, notable only for playing the trumpet.

After attaining his middle school diploma in 1970, Li was said to have held &quot;a series of unremarkable jobs&quot;: between 1970 and 1972, Li worked at an army horse farm; from 1972 to 1978, was a trumpet player in a forest police unit in Jilin Province, and subsequently worked as a clerk in the Grain and Oil Procurement company in Changchun. Unnamed former classmates and co-workers cited in government accounts stress repeatedly that Li was unremarkable, that they never saw him practising qigong, and that they had no knowledge of the Buddhist and Daoist Masters Li claimed to have studied under.

A group of early adopters in Changchun became disenchanted after Li forbade his followers from charging fees for the practice at the end of 1994, amongst other things. The group left the Falun Gong movement, and proceeded to send to government ministries a series of accusations against Li, among them that he had not shown any supernatural powers during his youth. Falun Gong sent detailed rebuttals to the ministries. Following the suppression of Falun Gong in 1999, Chinese authorities republished all these accusations, point by point.

===Birth date controversy===
Li&#x27;s date of birth became a controversy after 1999. Falun Gong sources published that Li was born on 13 May 1951. The Chinese government published his birthday as 7 or 27 July 1952, pointing out that his claimed birthday was the same as Gautama Buddha. As evidence of the 1952 birth, authorities quoted Pan Yufang, a midwife who recalled delivering Li in July 1952. Pan&#x27;s account included the assertion that she used oxytocin to assist in the birth, which was disputed by Falun Gong practitioners as they claimed that oxytocin was not available until after 1953. Professor David Ownby wrote in 2008 that Li Hongzhi was born Li Lai on 27 July 1952 in Gongzhuling, Jilin province, China. The Chinese government said that Li changed his name from Lai to Hongzhi because Hongzhi, meaning &quot;vast will&quot;, sounded more revolutionary. In 2017, Professor James R. Lewis analyzed a 2015 report by Kaiwind, an anti-cult non-profit group in China, and agreed with their photographic evidence that Li was born on 7 July 1952. The Kaiwind report documented how Li approached a friend in government service who helped him change his government identification papers in late September 1994, and that the necessary government clerk&#x27;s signature was forged by a police woman named Sun Lixian, who changed his birthdate and his government identification number, after which he was issued a new identification card in October.

Li does not argue that he changed his identification in 1994, but he said his date of birth had been misprinted as one of the pervasive bureaucratic errors of the Cultural Revolution, and he was merely correcting it. Regarding the accusation that he selected Gautama Buddha&#x27;s birthday as his own, Li characterized it as a &quot;smear&quot;, and said, &quot;What&#x27;s the big deal about having the same birthday as Sakyamuni [Gautama Buddha]? Many criminals were also born on that date. I have never said that I am Sakyamuni. I am just a very ordinary man.&quot; However, Li has claimed a variety of superhuman powers, such as the power to become invisible.

==Falun Gong==

Li Hongzhi followed Li Weidong&#x27;s &quot;Chanmi Gong&quot; in 1988. Then, he took a class of &quot;Jiugong Bagua Gong&quot; offered by Yu Guangshen. Falun Gong was produced on the basis of these two practices. Li Hongzhi introduced &quot;Falun Dafa&quot;, or the Great Law of the Wheel of Dharma, on 13 May 1992 (Li&#x27;s 41st birthday as claimed) at the fifth Middle School in Changchun, Jilin. From 1992 to 1994 he traveled throughout China, giving lectures and teaching Falun Gong exercises; his following grew rapidly. Li&#x27;s success was largely linked to the huge popularity enjoyed by &quot;qigong&quot; in the late 1980s and early 1990s under Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s social liberalization. He differentiated Falun Gong by prioritising &quot;accessibility to the public&quot; and moral content, away from esoteric notions often found in other Qigong systems.
Falun Gong&#x27;s teachings are compiled from Li&#x27;s lectures, and he holds definitional power in the Falun Gong belief system. Li claims that he holds supernatural powers like clairvoyance, an ability to prevent illness, as well as having eternal youth. He created a program that promises practitioners that they will have perfect health and supernatural powers quickly and easily. He was also critical of alternative systems within the &quot;Qigong&quot; movement, stating it was &quot;rife with false teachings and greedy and fraudulent &#x27;masters&#x27;&quot; and set out to rectify it. Li said that Falun Gong was a part of a &quot;centuries-old tradition of cultivation&quot;, and in his texts would often attack those who taught &quot;incorrect, deviant, or heterodox ways&quot;. Li differentiated Falun Gong from other movements in Qigong by emphasizing moral values aimed to &quot;purify one&#x27;s heart and attain spiritual salvation&quot; rather than what he saw as undue emphasis on physical health and the development of supernatural powers.

Ian Johnson pointed out that during the greatest period of Falun Gong book sales in China, Li Hongzhi never received any royalties because all publications were bootleg. Li&#x27;s success also had a large part to do with people seeking alternative medicine treatments at a time when China&#x27;s health care system was struggling desperately to meet demand. As the Master of the Falun Gong cultivation system, Li claimed to &quot;purify the students&#x27; bodies&quot; and &quot;unblock their main and collateral channels&quot; and in doing so &quot;remove the root of their disease&quot;, if they were ill. He also reputedly planted a &quot;Falun&quot; or &quot;law wheel&quot; in the abdomen of each student, and other &quot;energy mechanisms&quot; in other parts of their bodies. Li also described how his &quot;Law bodies&quot; will protect each practitioner and how he &quot;clear[s] up the students&#x27; house and places of practice and then put[s] a covering of safety&#x27;&quot;. In Li&#x27;s Falun Gong teachings, he emphasizes that practitioners should abide by the moral principles of truth, compassion and forbearance, in their daily lives. According to New Zealand scholar Heather Kavan, these principles have been repeated by Falun Gong members to outsiders as a tactic for evading deeper inquiry. Li has instructed his followers to lie to outsiders about Falun Gong.

According to Falun Gong groups, Li&#x27;s early success was recognized at the 1992 and 1993 Beijing Oriental Health Expos. At the first of these events, the fair&#x27;s organizer remarked that Falun Gong and Li &quot;received the most praise [of any qigong school] at the fair, and achieved very good therapeutic results&quot;. The event helped cement Li&#x27;s popularity in the qigong world, and journalistic reports of Falun Gong&#x27;s healing powers spread. The following year, Li was made a member of the organizing committee of the Beijing Health Expo, and won several awards and commendations at the event.

In this era, Li developed a positive rapport with the Ministry of Public Security (MPS). In 1993, he provided treatment for 100 police officers who had been injured on the job, earning praise from an organization under the MPS. Li gave lectures at the Public Security University in Beijing in 1994, and contributed proceeds from the seminars to a foundation for injured police officers. The publishing ceremony for Li&#x27;s book, Zhuan Falun, was held in the auditorium of the Ministry of Public Security in January 1995.

In 1998 Li Hongzhi stated that he believes alien invaders walk the Earth and that modern science and race-mixing are part of their ploy to overtake humanity, and he has reportedly said that he can walk through walls and make himself invisible. Li says that he is a being from a higher level who has come to help humankind from the destruction it could face as the result of rampant evil. Regarding these concepts, he said, &quot;You must not talk with ordinary people about the high-level things I have taught you. Instead, only talk about being persecuted... about our human rights being violated.&quot; Lewis says that Li&#x27;s &quot;emphatic&quot; claims to his followers that he holds &quot;exalted status&quot;, and his instructions to his followers to deflect outsiders from this fact, are contradictory to his teachings about &quot;Truthfulness&quot;, a cornerstone of Falun Gong belief.

==Life abroad==
In 1995, Li declared that he had finished teaching Falun Gong in China, and began spreading the practice abroad. His first stop in March 1995 was to the Chinese embassy in Paris, where he had been invited to teach the practice. This was followed by seminars in Sweden. Between 1995 and 1999, Li gave lectures in Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland and the United States. Falun Gong associations and clubs began appearing in Europe, North America and Australia, with activities centered mainly on university campuses.

In 1996, the city of Houston named Li as an honorary citizen and goodwill ambassador for his &quot;unselfish public service for the benefit and welfare of mankind.&quot;

After the event, Li received more measures of recognition from North American municipalities. In May 1999, Li was welcomed to Toronto with greetings from the Mayor of Toronto and the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, and in the two months that followed also received recognition from the cities of Chicago and San Jose.

Li Hongzhi moved to the United States in 1996 with his wife and daughter, and in 1998 became a U.S. permanent resident, settling in New York.

On 29 July 1999, after Falun Gong was banned, the Ministry of Public Security of China leveled a series of charges against Li, including the charge of &quot;disturbing public order&quot; and issued a circular indicating his status as being wanted and pressing for his arrest. At that time, Li Hongzhi was living in the United States. The Chinese government&#x27;s request to Interpol for his arrest was rejected on the grounds that the request was a matter &quot;of a political or religious character&quot; and lacked information on any &quot;ordinary law crime he would have committed.&quot; The Chinese government also revoked his passport, preventing him from travelling internationally.

By April 2001, Li Hongzhi had received over 340 awards and proclamations from Australia, Canada, China (before crackdown), Japan, Russia, and the U.S. in recognition of the contributions to people&#x27;s spiritual and physical health, and to freedom of belief in the world. These include certificates of recognition from several governmental bodies in the United States—including Honorary Citizenship awarded by The State of Georgia and city of Atlanta. On 14 March 2001, The Freedom House bestowed Li Hongzhi and Falun Gong with an International Religious Freedom Award for the advancement of religious and spiritual freedom at a ceremony in the United States Senate. He was nominated for the 2001 Sakharov Prize by over 25 members of European Parliament, was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 and 2001, and in 2013 was ranked by Foreign Policy Magazine as one of the 500 most powerful people in the world.

==Shen Yun, &quot;The Epoch Times&quot;, and political involvement==
Performance arts group Shen Yun, the media organization &quot;The Epoch Times&quot;, and a variety of other organizations such as New Tang Dynasty Television operate as extensions of Falun Gong. These extensions promote Falun Gong and Hongzhi&#x27;s teachings, and, in the case of &quot;The Epoch Times&quot;, promote conspiracy theories and far-right politics in both the United States and Europe. According to a March 2020 report by Samuel Braslow published in &quot;Los Angeles Magazine&quot;:

(&quot;Los Angeles Magazine&quot; retracted Braslow&#x27;s article in September 2020 after Falun Gong filed a defamation lawsuit in May.)

The exact financial and structural connections between Falun Gong, Shen Yun, and &quot;The Epoch Times&quot; remains unclear. According to NBC News:

:The Epoch Media Group, along with Shen Yun, a dance troupe known for its ubiquitous advertising and unsettling performances, make up the outreach effort of Falun Gong, a relatively new spiritual practice that combines ancient Chinese meditative exercises, mysticism and often ultraconservative cultural worldviews. Falun Gong&#x27;s founder has referred to Epoch Media Group as &quot;our media&quot;, and the group&#x27;s practice heavily informs The Epoch Times&#x27; coverage, according to former employees who spoke with NBC News.

:The Epoch Times, digital production company NTD and the heavily advertised dance troupe Shen Yun make up the nonprofit network that Li calls &quot;our media&quot;. Financial documents paint a complicated picture of more than a dozen technically separate organizations that appear to share missions, money and executives. Though the source of their revenue is unclear, the most recent financial records from each organization paint a picture of an overall business thriving in the Trump era.

Reporter Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian speculates that Li Hongzhi&#x27;s anti-miscegenation beliefs, based on the argument that multiracial heritage has no place in a supposedly race-segregated heaven, could have influenced &quot;The Epoch Times&quot;″ support of German far-right nativism. Falun Gong&#x27;s cosmology includes the belief that different ethnicities each have a correspondence to their own heavens, and that individuals of mixed race lose some aspect of this connection. Falun Gong&#x27;s teachings include belief in reincarnation and that one&#x27;s soul (original spirit) always maintains single racial identity despite having a body of mixed race. Investigative journalist Ethan Gutmann noted that interracial marriage is common in Falun Gong community.

<doc id="471444" wikidata="Q963944" url="?curid=471444" title="Melioidosis">
<text>Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by a gram-negative bacterium called &quot;Burkholderia pseudomallei&quot;. Most people exposed to &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; experience no symptoms; however, those who do experience symptoms have signs and symptoms that range from mild, such as fever and skin changes, to severe with pneumonia, abscesses, and septic shock that could cause death. Approximately 10% of people with melioidosis develop symptoms that last longer than two months, termed &quot;chronic melioidosis&quot;.

Humans are infected with &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; by contact with contaminated soil or water. The bacteria enter the body through wounds, inhalation, or ingestion. Person-to-person or animal-to-human transmission is extremely rare. The infection is constantly present in Southeast Asia particularly in northeast Thailand and northern Australia. In temperate countries such as Europe and the United States, melioidosis cases are usually imported from countries where melioidosis is endemic. The signs and symptoms of melioidosis resemble tuberculosis and misdiagnosis is common. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by the growth of &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; from an infected person&#x27;s blood or other bodily fluid such as pus, sputum, and urine. Those with melioidosis are treated first with an &quot;intensive phase&quot; course of intravenous antibiotics (most commonly ) followed by a several-month treatment course of co-trimoxazole. In countries with an advanced healthcare system, approximately 10% of people with melioidosis die from the disease. In less developed countries, the death rate could reach 40%.

Efforts to prevent melioidosis include: wearing protective gear while handling contaminated water or soil, practising hand hygiene, drinking boiled water, and avoiding direct contact with soil, water, or heavy rain. There is little evidence to support the use of melioidosis prophylaxis in humans. The antibiotic co-trimoxazole is used as a preventative only for individuals at high risk of getting the disease after being exposed to the bacteria in laboratory settings. One study conducted in 2018 determined that the drug could be useful in preventing melioidosis in high-risk renal failure patients undergoing haemodialysis. There is no approved vaccine for melioidosis.

Approximately 165,000 people are infected by melioidosis per year, resulting in about 89,000 deaths, based on a mathematical model published in 2016. Diabetes is a major risk factor for melioidosis; over half of melioidosis cases are in people with diabetes. Increased rainfall and severe weather events such as thunderstorms are associated with an increased number of melioidosis cases in endemic areas.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Acute===


Most people exposed to &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; experience no symptoms. The mean incubation period of acute melioidosis is 9 days (range 1–21 days). Nevertheless, symptoms of melioidosis can appear in 24 hours for those who experienced near drowning in water. Those affected present with symptoms of sepsis (predominantly fever) with or without pneumonia, or localised abscess or other focus of infection. The presence of non-specific signs and symptoms has caused melioidosis to be nicknamed &quot;the great mimicker&quot;.

Diabetes mellitus is one of the most important risk factors in developing melioidosis. The disease should be considered in anyone who has spent time in endemic areas who develops a fever, pneumonia, or abscesses in their liver, spleen, prostate, or parotid gland. The clinical manifestation of the disease can range from simple skin changes such as abscesses or ulcerations to severe organ problems. The commonest organs affected are the liver, spleen, lungs, prostate, and kidneys. Among the most common features are bacteremia (in 40 to 60% of cases), pneumonia (50%), and septic shock (20%).
People with only pneumonia may have a prominent cough with sputum and shortness of breath. However, those with septic shock together with pneumonia may have minimal coughing. Results of a chest X-ray can range from diffuse nodular infiltrates in those with septic shock to progressive consolidation located most commonly in the upper lobes for those with pneumonia only. Pleural effusion and empyema are more common for melioidosis affecting the lower lobes of the lungs. In 10% of cases, people develop secondary pneumonia caused by other bacteria after the primary infection. In northern Australia, 60% of the infected children presented with only skin lesions, while 20% presented with pneumonia.

Depending on the course of infection, other severe manifestations develop. Approximately 1 to 5% of those infected develop inflammation of the brain and brain covering or brain abscess; 14 to 28% develop pyelonephritis, kidney abscess or prostatic abscesses; 0 to 30% develop neck or salivary gland abscesses; 10 to 33% develop liver, spleen, or paraintestinal abscesses; and 4 to 14% develop septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. Rare manifestations include lymph node disease resembling tuberculosis, mediastinal masses, pericardial effusion, mycotic aneurysm, and inflammation of the pancreas. In Australia, up to 20% of infected males develop prostatic abscess which may manifest clinically as pain during urination, difficulty in passing urine, and urinary retention requiring catheterisation. Rectal examination may find enlarged prostate. In Thailand, 30% of the infected children develop parotid abscesses. Encephalomyelitis not only happens in those with risk factors but can also occur in healthy people without risk factors. Those with melioidosis encephalomyelitis tend to have normal computed tomography (CT) scans but increased T2 signal by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), extending to the brain stem and spinal cord. Clinical signs include: unilateral upper motor neuron limb weakness, cerebellar signs, and cranial nerve palsies (VI, VII nerve palsies and bulbar palsy). Some cases presented with flaccid paralysis alone. In northern Australia, all melioidosis with encephalomyelitis cases had elevated white cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), mostly mononuclear cells with elevated CSF protein.

===Chronic===
Chronic melioidosis is usually defined by symptoms lasting greater than two months and occurs in about 10% of patients. Clinical presentations include fever, weight loss, productive cough with or without bloody sputum which may mimic tuberculosis. Additionally, long-standing abscesses at multiple body sites may also present. Tuberculosis should be considered for lymph nodes enlargement at the root of the lung. Additionally, pneumonia caused by melioidosis rarely causes scarring and calcification of the lungs, unlike tuberculosis.

===Latent===
The potential for prolonged incubation was recognized in US servicemen involved in the Vietnam War, and was referred to as the &quot;Vietnam time-bomb&quot;. Initially, it was thought that the longest period between presumed exposure and clinical presentation is 62 years in a prisoner of war in Burma-Thailand-Malaysia. However, subsequent genotyping of the bacteria isolate from the Vietnam veteran showed that the isolate may not come from , but from South America. This reinstates another report that put the longest latency period for melioidosis as 29 years. Patients with latent melioidosis may be symptom-free for decades. Less than 5% of all melioidosis cases have activation after a period of latency. Various comorbidities such as diabetes, renal failure, and alcoholism can predispose to reactivation of melioidosis.

==Cause==
===Bacteria===

Melioidosis is caused by gram-negative, motile, saprophytic bacteria named &quot;Burkholderia pseudomallei&quot;. The bacteria are usually opportunistic, facultative intracellular pathogens. It is also aerobic and oxidase test positive. A granule at the centre of the bacterium makes it resemble a &quot;safety pin&quot; when Gram stained. The bacteria emit a strong soil smell after 24 to 48 hours of growth in culture, however smelling for the identification of the bacteria is not recommended for routine laboratory practice. One of the factors causing &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; resistance to various kinds of antibiotics is because it produces a glycocalyx polysaccharide capsule. It is generally resistant to gentamicin and colistin but sensitive to co-amoxiclav. &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; is a biosafety level 3 pathogen which requires specialized laboratory handling. In humans and animals, another similar organism named &quot;Burkholderia mallei&quot; is the causative agent of the disease glanders. &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; can be differentiated from another closely related, but less pathogenic species &quot;B. thailandensis&quot; by its ability to assimilate arabinose. &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; is highly adaptable to various host environments ranging from inside mycorrhizal fungi spores to amoeba. Its adaptability may give it a survival advantage in the human body.

The genome of &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; consists of two replicons: chromosome 1 encodes housekeeping functions of the bacteria such as cell wall synthesis, mobility, and metabolism; chromosome 2 encodes functions that allow the bacteria to adapt to various environments. Horizontal gene transfer has resulted in highly variable genomes in &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot;. Australia has been suggested as the origin for &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; because of the high genetic variability of the bacteria found in this region. Bacteria that were introduced to Central and South America in the 17th to 19th centuries seem to have a common ancestor from Africa. &quot;B. mallei&quot; is a clone of &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; that has lost substantial portions of its genome as it adapted to live exclusively in mammals. This makes the &quot;B. mallei&quot; genome much smaller than &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot;.

===Transmission===
&quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; is normally found in soil and surface water, and is most abundant at soil depths of 10 to 90 cm. It has been found in soils, ponds, streams, pools, stagnant water, and rice paddy fields. &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; can survive in nutrient-poor conditions such as distilled water, desert soil, and nutrient-depleted soil for more than 16 years. It can also survive in antiseptic and detergent solutions, acidic environments (pH 4.5 for 70 days), and in environments at temperatures ranging from 24 °C (75.2 °F) to 32 °C (89.6 °F). However, the bacteria may be killed by the presence of ultraviolet light.

Bacteria can enter the body through wounds, inhalation, and ingestion of contaminated soil or water. Person-to-person transmission is extremely rare. Melioidosis is a recognised disease in animals including pigs, cats, dogs, goats, sheep, horses, and others. Cattle, water buffalo, and crocodiles are considered to be relatively resistant to melioidosis despite their constant exposure to mud. Birds are also considered resistant to melioidosis although several cases had been reported in Australia and aquatic birds. Transmission from animals to humans is rare.

Inadequate chlorination of the water supply has been associated with &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; outbreak in Northern and Western Australia. There were also several cases of bacteria being found in unchlorinated water supply in rural Thailand. Based on the whole genome sequencing of the bacteria, the variety of the bacteria &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; in Papua New Guinea is narrow due to limited movements of the indigenous people. This findings supports the hypothesis that humans play an important role in bacterial dispersal.

==Pathogenesis==

&quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses. Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or mucous membrane and replicate in the epithelial cells. From there, they use flagellar motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the bloodstream, the bacteria can infect both phagocytes and non-phagocytes. &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; use their flagella to move near host cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the type IV pilus protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein Protease-activated receptor-1 which is present on the surface of endothelial cells, platelets, and monocytes. Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through endocytosis, ending up inside an endocytic vesicle. As the vesicle acidifies, &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; uses its type 3 secretion system (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host cytoplasm. Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host autophagy using various T3SS effector proteins. The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.

Inside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of the host actin behind them, propelling the bacteria forward. This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the autotransporter BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium. The bacteria that carry a BimABm allele have a higher possibility of causing neurological melioidosis—and thus a higher chance of death and residual disability to the host—when compared to bacteria that have the BimABp variant. Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protrusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) that provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or latent infection. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. In addition to spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the bloodstream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in antigen-presenting cells and dendritic cells. Thus, these cells act as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.

While &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by interferon gamma (IFN) have improved the killing of &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; via the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase. Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however, the bacterial capsule and LPS make &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by pattern recognition receptors such as NOD-like receptors, triggering the formation of the inflammasome and activation of caspase 1, which induces death of the host cell by pyroptosis and further activation of the immune system. Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; triggers both the complement system and coagulation cascade, however, the thick bacterial capsule prevents the action of the complement membrane attack complex.

Additional elements of the immune system are activated by the host toll-like receptors such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the conserved pieces of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of cytokines such as Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and Interleukin 18 (IL-18). IL-18 increases IFN production through natural killer cells while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as neutrophils, dendritic cells, B cells, and s to the site of infection. T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot;; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers are associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis. Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated cytokine responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective. People infected with &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; may develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people who live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot;. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.

&quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; can remain latent in the human body for up to 29 years until it is reactivated during human immunosuppression or stress response. However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear. Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment. Granulomas (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.

==Diagnosis==


===Culture===
Bacterial culture has 60% sensitivity in diagnosing melioidosis. &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. However, culture from CSF is difficult because in one case series, only 29% of the neuromelioidosis cases are culture-positive. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive. &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; can be grown on any blood agar, MacConkey agar, and agar containing antibiotics such as (containing gentamicin), and Ashdown&#x27;s broth (containing colistin) for better isolation of &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; from other types of bacteria. Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37 °C (98.6 °F) in air and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; forms creamy, non-haemolytic, colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled. Colonies of &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8 mg/L and neutral red indicator replaced with 0.2% bromocresol purple) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, &quot;Burkholderia cepacia&quot; selective agar can be used if Ashdown&#x27;s medium is not available. It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; or &quot;Bacillus&quot; spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot;, including the API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit combined with Gram stain, oxidase test, typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria. API 20NE biochemical kit is 99% sensitive in identifying &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot;.

Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA sequencing, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and real-time PCR can also be used to identify &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; in culture. Other bacterial genes such as fliC genes encoding flagellin, rpsU gene encoding for ribosomal protein, and TTS genes encoding Type III secretion systems have also been employed for detection. Another method of gene detection namely multiple cross displacement amplification for the bacterial TTS1 gene detection produces results within an hour.

===Hematological and biochemical tests===
General blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased bilirubin levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction). Low blood glucose and acidosis predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis. However, other tests such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.

===Serological tests===
s such as indirect haemagglutination assay (IHA) have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot;. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so the interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibodies is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; so the diagnosis of melioidosis should not be reliant entirely on the serological tests done in endemic areas. Indirect immunofluorescent test (IFAT) uses either &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; or &quot;B. thailandensis&quot; antigens to look for the total number of antibodies in human serum. Using IFAT is labour intensive and is not used in large-scale investigations.

Antigen detection tests allow rapid detection of melioidosis. Examples of antigen detection tests are: the latex agglutination test and ELISA. Latex agglutination uses antibodies coated on latex beads to detect &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; antigens in solid or liquid media, although not all the assays can detect different species of &quot;Burkholderia&quot;. Latex agglutination is useful in screening for suspected &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; colonies. IgG and IgM ELISAs have been used to detect lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigens of &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot;, but plagued with low sensitivity. Commercial ELISA kits for melioidosis no longer available in the market due to low sensitivity to human antibodies detection. Nevertheless, antigen detection tests may be useful in severely ill patients because the bacterial load is high enough for detection. Other methods of antigen detection such as direct immunofluorescence, antibody-sandwich ELISAs, and lateral flow immunoassays using monoclonal antibody.

===Microscopy===
By microscopy, &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; is seen as and rod-shaped, with bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither specific nor sensitive. Immunofluorescence microscopy is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.

===Imaging===
Various imaging modalities can also help with the diagnosis of melioidosis. In acute melioidosis with the spreading of the bacteria through the bloodstream, the chest X-ray shows multifocal nodular lesions. It may also show merging nodules or cavitations. For those with acute melioidosis without the spread to the bloodstream, chest X-ray most commonly shows upper lobe consolidation or cavitations. In chronic melioidosis, the slow progression of upper lobe consolidation of the lungs resembles tuberculosis. For abscesses located in other parts of the body apart from the lungs, especially in the liver and spleen, CT scan has higher sensitivity when compared with an ultrasound scan. In liver and splenic abscesses, an ultrasound scan shows &quot;target-like&quot; lesions while a CT scan shows &quot;honeycomb sign&quot; (abscess with loculations separated by thin septa) in liver abscesses. For melioidosis involving the brain, MRI has higher sensitivity than a CT scan in diagnosing the lesion. MRI shows ring-enhancing lesions for brain melioidosis.

==Prevention==
Melioidosis is a notifiable disease in Australia which enables the country to monitor disease burden and contain outbreaks. On the other hand, melioidosis is only a notifiable condition in Thailand since June 2016. However, until recently, the official notification system in Thailand has significantly underestimated the incidence of culture-positive melioidosis and its mortality. Nevertheless, Australia also embarked on awareness campaigns to increase the community&#x27;s understanding of the disease. In the United Kingdom, where reporting by laboratories is mandatory, 41.3% of cases imported since 2010 were not notified. In the United States, lab workers can handle clinical specimens of &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; under BSL-2 conditions, while mass production of such organisms requires BSL-3 precautions. On the other hand, in other endemic areas where the &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; samples were handled less stringently, there has been no confirmed laboratory-acquired infection reported. This phenomenon may show that the risk of infection with &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; is less than a typical biohazard type 3 agent. There are also several cases of hospital-acquired infection of melioidosis. Therefore, healthcare providers are recommended to practice hand hygiene and universal precautions.

Large-scale water chlorination has been successful at reducing &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; in the water in Australia. In middle to low-income countries, water should be boiled before consumption. In high-income countries, water could be treated with ultraviolet light for those at risk of contracting melioidosis. Those who are at high risk of contact with the bacteria should wear protective gear (such as boots and gloves) during work. Those staying in endemic areas should avoid direct contact with soil and outdoor exposure to heavy rain or dust clouds. Bottled water or boiled water are preferred as drinking water. A study conducted from 2014 to 2018, however, showed no significant differences in whether behavioural changes can reduce the risk of contracting melioidosis. Modification of behavioural changes or more frequent interventions may be needed to ensure a definite reduction in the risk of getting melioidosis.

===Antibiotic prophylaxis===
Administering cotrimoxazole three times a week throughout a wet season for dialysis patients has no obvious benefit in preventing melioidosis. Besides, the high cost and side effects of this drug limit its use to only those with a high risk of getting melioidosis. After exposure to &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; (particularly following a laboratory accident, penetrating injuries, exposure of mouth and eyes to contaminated materials or aerosols), treatment with antibiotics is only given when in highly selected individuals after weighing the risk of adverse effects of the drugs against the benefits from contracting melioidosis. Cotrimoxazole can be used in this context. Alternatively, co-amoxiclav and doxycycline can be used for those who are intolerant to co-trimoxazole. Low-risk individuals would receive frequent monitoring instead.

===Vaccination===

Several vaccine candidates have been tested in animal models. Nevertheless, no vaccine candidates have been tried in humans. Major hurdles of the vaccines are limited efficacy in animal models, establishing the best method of vaccine administration in humans, and logistical and financial issues in establishing human trials in endemic areas.

==Treatment==
The treatment of melioidosis is divided into two stages: an intravenous intensive phase and an eradication phase to prevent recurrence. The choice of antibiotics depends upon the susceptibility of the bacteria to various antibiotics. &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; are generally susceptible to ceftazidime, meropenem, imipenem, and co-amoxiclav. These drugs generally kill bacteria. &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; is also susceptible to doxycycline, chloramphenicol, and co-trimoxazole. These drugs generally inhibit the growth of the bacteria. However, the bacteria are resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, 1st and 2nd generation cephalosporin, gentamicin, streptomycin, tobramycin, macrolides, and polymyxins. On the other hand, 86% of the &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; isolates from the region of Sarawak, Malaysia are susceptible to gentamicin and this has not been found elsewhere in other parts of the world.

Before 1989, the standard treatment for acute melioidosis was a three-drug combination of , co-trimoxazole, and doxycycline; this regimen is associated with a mortality rate of 80% and is no longer used unless no other alternatives are available. All three drugs are bacteriostatic (they stop the bacterium from growing, but do not kill it) and the action of co-trimoxazole antagonizes both chloramphenicol and doxycycline.

===Intensive phase===
Intravenous ceftazidime is the current drug of choice for the treatment of acute melioidosis and should be administered for at least 10 to 14 days. Meropenem, imipenem and the cefoperazone-sulbactam combination (Sulperazone) are also effective. Intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate (co-amoxiclav) may be used if none of the above four drugs is available; co-amoxiclav prevents death from melioidosis as well as ceftazidime. Co-amoxiclav is also used if the patient has an allergy towards sulfonamide, unable to tolerate co-trimoxazole, in pregnant patients or children. A high dose of co-amoxiclav (20 mg/kg for amoxicillin and 5 mg/kg for clavulanate) is recommended to prevent treatment failures. Intravenous antibiotics are given for a minimum of 10 to 14 days. The median fever clearance time in melioidosis is 9 days. The treatment duration is in accordance with Darwin melioidosis treatment guidelines where there is a low rate of recrudescence and .

Meropenem is the preferred antibiotic therapy for neurological melioidosis and for those with septic shock admitted into intensive care units. Co-trimoxazole is recommended in addition to ceftazidime for neurological melioidosis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, skin and gastrointestinal infection, and deeply seated abscesses. For deep-seated infections such as abscesses of internal organs, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and neurological melioidosis, the duration of antibiotics given should be longer (up to 4 to 8 weeks). The time taken for the fever to be resolved can be more than 10 days in those with deep-seated infection. According to the 2020 Revised Royal Darwin Hospital Guideline, the dosage for intravenous ceftazidime is 2g 6-hourly in adults (50 mg/kg up to 2g in children less than 15 years old). The dosage for meropenem is 1g 8-hourly in adults (25 mg/kg up to 1g in children). Acquired resistance to ceftazidime, carbapenems, and co-amoxiclav is rare in the intensive phase but resistance to cotrimoxazole during eradication therapy is technically difficult to assess. There are no differences between using cefoperazone/sulbactam or ceftazidime to treat melioidosis as both show similar death rates and disease progression following treatment. However, data are lacking to recommend cefoperazone/sulbactam usage. For those with kidney impairment, the dosage of ceftazidime, meropenem, and co-trimoxazole should be lowered. Once the clinical condition improves, meropenem can be switched back to ceftazidime.

===Eradication phase===
Following the treatment of the acute disease, eradication treatment with co-trimoxazole is the drug of choice and should be used for 3 months (12 weeks) as all-cause mortality was lower in 12 weeks group when compared to those receiving treatment for 20 weeks. For those with neurological melioidosis and osteomyelitis, drugs should be given for more than 6 months. Co-amoxiclav and doxycycline are drugs of second choice. Co-trimoxazole should not be used in those with deficiency as it can cause haemolytic anemia. However, in Thailand, usage of co-trimoxazole does not accompany G6PD screening. Other side effects such as rash, hyperkalemia, renal dysfunction, and gastrointestinal symptoms should prompt the reduction of co-trimoxazole doses. Chloramphenicol is no longer routinely recommended for this purpose. Co-amoxiclav is an alternative for patients unable to take co-trimoxazole and doxycycline (e.g. pregnant women and children under the age of 12), but is not as effective and has a higher relapse rate. Single-agent treatment with fluoroquinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin) or doxycycline for the oral eradication phase is ineffective.

In Australia, co-trimoxazole is used with children and pregnant mothers after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Meanwhile, in Thailand, co-amoxiclav is the drug of choice for children and pregnant women. &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; rarely acquires resistance when co-amoxiclav is used. The dosing regimen for co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) in eradication phase is 6/30 mg/kg, up to maximum 240/1200 mg in children, 240/1200 mg in adults weighing 40 to 60 kg, and 320/1600 mg in adults weighing more than 60 kg, taken orally every 12 hours. In both Thailand and Australia, co-trimoxazole is taken together with folic acid (0.1 mg/kg up to 5 mg in children). There are also cases where melioidosis is successfully treated with co-trimoxazole for 3 months without going through intensive therapy provided that there is only skin manifestations without the involvement of internal organs or sepsis. Resistance to cotrimoxazole is rare in Asia. Besides that, it is difficult to determine the resistance reliably because resistance to cotrimoxazole is defined when minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of more than 4 mg/L is required to completely inhibit the growth of 80% of the bacteria (80% inhibition point). Interpretation of the 80% inhibition point is subjective and prone to human error. In 2021, European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) released a new guideline on interpreting the susceptibility of &quot;B pseudomallei&quot; towards various antibiotics on disc susceptibility testing. The new guideline includes &quot;S&quot; for susceptible organisms, &quot;I&quot; for susceptible organisms only after increased exposure (when dosage or concentration of the drug increases), and &quot;R&quot; for resistant organisms.

===Surgery===
Surgical drainage is indicated for single, large abscesses in the liver, muscle, and prostate. However, for multiple abscesses in the liver, spleen, and kidney, surgical drainage may not be possible or necessary. For septic arthritis, arthrotomy washout and drainage are required. Surgical debridement may be necessary. For those with mycotic aneurysm, urgent surgery is required for prosthetic vascular grafts. Lifelong therapy with co-trimoxazole may be needed for those with prosthetic vascular grafts according to a review of case reports in 2005. Other abscesses rarely need to be drained because most resolve with antibiotic treatment. Prostate abscess may require routine imaging. Antibiotics treatment for prostatic abscess may be enough except for abscesses more than 10 to 15 mm where surgical drainage is required.

===Others===
Several immunomodulating therapies are suggested to boost the human body&#x27;s immune function against the bacteria because the pathogenesis of melioidosis is thought to be contributed by defects in neutrophils. The Royal Darwin Hospital 2014 guidelines recommended granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) as immunomodulating therapy for those with septic shock at 300 ug daily as soon as the bacteriological laboratory flag the culture as possibly &quot;Burkholderia pseudomallei&quot;. The main contraindication of starting (G-CSF) is a heart event. The G-CSF is continued for ten days depending on clinical response or a contraindication develops such as a white cell count greater than &gt;50,000 X106/litre.

Anti-PDI (programmed cell death) agents could be useful in melioidosis treatment, especially for those with septic shock. This is because &quot;Burkholderia pseudomallei&quot; bacteria increase the expression of PDI-1 that regulates and inhibits the formation of T-cells that are essential for fighting against melioidosis.

==Prognosis==
In well-resourced settings, where the disease can be detected and treated early, the risk of death is 10%. In resource-poor settings, the risk of death from the disease is more than 40%.

Recurrent melioidosis can occur either due to re-infection or relapse after the completion of eradication therapy. Re-infection is due to a new strain of &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; bacteria. Meanwhile, relapse is due to failure to clear infections after the eradication therapy. Recurrent melioidosis is rare since 2014 due to improved antibiotic therapy and prolongation of the intensive phase of therapy as evident in Darwin Prospective Melioidosis Study. On the other hand, are those who present with symptoms during the eradication therapy. Recrudescence rates may be improved by ensuring adherence to a full course of eradication therapy e.g. by reducing self-discharge .

Underlying medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and cancer can worsen the long-term survival and disability of those who recover from infection. One of the complications of melioidosis is encephalomyelitis. It can cause quadriparesis (muscle weakness in all the limbs), partial flaccid paraparesis (muscle weakness of both legs), or foot drop. For those with previous melioidosis-associated bone and joint infections, complications such as sinus tract infection, bone, and joint deformities with limited range of motion can occur.

==Epidemiology==

Melioidosis is an understudied disease that remains endemic in developing countries. In 2015, the International Melioidosis Society was formed to raise disease awareness. In 2016, a statistical model was developed which predicted that the number is 165,000 cases per year with 138,000 of those occurring in East and South Asia and the Pacific. In approximately half of those cases (54% or 89,000), people will die. Under-reporting is a common problem as only 1,300 cases have been reported worldwide since 2010, which is less than 1% of the projected incidence based on the modelling. Lack of laboratory diagnostic capabilities and lack of disease awareness amongst health care providers also causes underdiagnosis. Even if bacterial cultures show positive results for &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot;, they can be discarded as contaminants, especially in laboratories in non-endemic areas. In 2015, it was estimated that the yearly disability-adjusted life year (DALY) was 84.3 per 100,000 people. As of 2022, melioidosis is not included in the WHO list of .

===Geography===
Melioidosis is endemic in parts of southeast Asia (including Thailand, Laos, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, Myanmar and Vietnam), southern China, Taiwan northern Australia. India, and South America. Since 1991, a total of 583 cases were reported in India. Most Indian cases are located in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Fifty-one cases of melioidosis were reported in Bangladesh from 1961–2017. Nonetheless, lack of awareness and resources gives rise to underdiagnosis of the disease in the country. The true burden of melioidosis in Africa and the Middle East remains unknown due to the low amount of data. Several melioidosis cases have been reported over the years. Although 24 African countries and three Middle Eastern countries were predicted to be endemic with melioidosis, however not a single case was reported from these specific countries. In the United States, two historical cases (1950 and 1971) and four recent cases (2010, 2011, 2013, 2020) have been reported amongst people that did not travel overseas. Despite extensive investigations, the source of melioidosis was never confirmed. One possible explanation is that importation of medicinal plant products or exotic reptiles could have resulted in the introduction of melioidosis in the United States. In 2021, there was a melioidosis outbreak in several states in the United States due to usage of contaminated aromatherapy spray imported from India. There are also cases of infection through imported tropical fishes in home aquariums.
In Europe, more than half of the melioidosis cases are imported from Thailand.

===Age, risk factors===
Melioidosis is found in all age groups. For Australia and Thailand, the median age of infection is at 50 years; 5 to 10% of the patients are under 15 years. The single most important risk factor for developing melioidosis is , followed by hazardous alcohol use, chronic kidney disease, and chronic lung disease. More than 50% of people with melioidosis have diabetes; diabetics have a 12-fold increased risk of contracting melioidosis. Diabetes decreases the ability of macrophages to fight the bacteria and reduces the T helper cell production. Excessive release of Tumor necrosis factor alpha and Interleukin 12 by mononuclear cells increases the risk of septic shock. Other risk factors include thalassaemia, occupational exposure (e.g. rice paddy farmers), recreational exposure to soil, water, being male, age greater than 45 years, and prolonged steroid use/immunosuppression. However, 8% of children and 20% of adults with melioidosis have no risk factors. HIV infection does not appear to predispose to melioidosis, although several other co-infections have been reported. Infant cases have been reported possibly due to mother-to-child transmission, community-acquired infection, or healthcare-associated infection. Those who are well may also be infected with &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot;. For example, 25% of children started producing antibodies against &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; between 6 months to 4 years of staying in endemic areas although they did not experience any melioidosis symptoms; suggesting they were exposed to it over this time. This means that many people without symptoms will test positive in serology tests in endemic areas. In Thailand, the seropositivity rate exceeds 50%, while in Australia the seropositivity rate is only 5%. The disease is associated with increased rainfall, with the number of cases rising following increased precipitation. Severe rainfall increases the concentration of the bacteria in the topsoil, thus increasing transmission of the bacteria through the air. A recent CDC Advisory indicated that the recent detection of the organism in the environment in Mississippi following the occurrence of two Indigenous cases of melioidosis, confirms that parts of the southern USA should now be regarded as melioidosis-endemic.

==History==
Pathologist Alfred Whitmore and his assistant Krishnaswami first reported melioidosis among beggars and morphine addicts at autopsy in Rangoon, present-day Myanmar, in a report published in 1912. Whitmore could grow the organism in culture and it showed similarity with &quot;B. mallei&quot;, another bacteria that was known to cause glanders in animals. Therefore, he named the new organism &quot;Bacillus pseudomallei&quot;. He did no further work on the organism. Arthur Conan Doyle may have read Whitmore&#x27;s report before writing a short story that involved the fictitious tropical disease &quot;Tapanuli fever&quot; in a Sherlock Holmes story titled &quot;&quot; published in 1913. In the same year, melioidosis outbreak occurred inside the Institute for Medical Research (IMR), Kuala Lumpur, Malaya after its laboratory animals such as guinea pigs and rabbits were infected. William Fletcher and Ambrose Thomas Stanton, doctors who worked at the IMR, were the next ones to study the organism. They were unable to identify the organism that caused the outbreak. It was only in 1917 when Fletcher isolated an organism similar to Whitmore&#x27;s bacillus from a Tamil rubber estate worker, the presence of the new species of bacteria was confirmed. The term &quot;melioidosis&quot; was first coined in 1921. The name melioidosis is derived from the Greek &quot;melis&quot; (μηλις) meaning &quot;a distemper of asses&quot; with the suffixes -oid meaning &quot;similar to&quot; and -osis meaning &quot;a condition&quot;, that is, a condition similar to glanders. &quot;B pseudomallei&quot; is similar in clinical presentation and genome make-up with &quot;B. mallei&quot; but is distinguished from it due to epidemiological and zoonotic characteristics.

The first human case of melioidosis in South Asia was reported in Sri Lanka in 1927. In 1932, Thomas and Fletcher collected 83 cases of melioidosis from literature. In this case series, there were only two survivors. Since then, more case series of melioidosis have been reported. Thomas and Fletcher also pioneered the use of serological methods in diagnosing the disease. Thomas and Fletcher incorrectly believed that melioidosis infection came from human contact with rodents. However, observations on the disease noted that humans usually got it after exposure to mud or contaminated water. Besides, the organism was never grown from rats. This led to a search of the bacteria in the environment. In 1936, the first animal (pig) case of melioidosis in Africa was reported in Madagascar. In 1937, water was first identified as the habitat of &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot;. The first case of Australian melioidosis was described in an outbreak in sheep in 1949 at North Queensland. This was followed by the first case of human melioidosis at Townsville in 1950. Initially, the discovery of melioidosis in Australia led to a debate on when and how the disease spread from Southeast Asia to a new distant environment. However, this hypothesis was later disproved in 2017 when whole genome sequencing of &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; over 30 countries collected over 79 years suggested Australia as the early reservoir for melioidosis. In 1955, the first case of local human melioidosis was reported in Thailand. During the Vietnam War from 1967 to 1973, 343 American soldiers were reported with melioidosis, with about 50 cases transmitted through inhalation. An outbreak of melioidosis at the Paris Zoo in the 1970s (known as &quot;L&#x27;affaire du jardin des plantes&quot;) was thought to have originated from an imported panda or horses from Iran. It is unclear how imported melioidosis can persist in a completely new environment. Eventually, the outbreak terminated itself after some time. It was only during the 1980s, Infectious Disease Association of Thailand started to take notice of this disease. The first conference on melioidosis was held in 1985 in Thailand. It was during this meeting that collaboration between Sappasitprasong Hospital, Thailand, and Wellcome-Mahido-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Programme was established. Such collaboration made Thailand a world leader in clinical and epidemiology research on melioidosis.

In 1989, several studies conducted in Thailand demonstrated ceftazidime as an effective antibiotic against melioidosis. had been shown to reduce the risk of death of melioidosis from 74% to 37%. In 1990, a non-virulent &#x27;arabinose-positive B. pseudomallei&#x27; was found by Vanaporn Wuthiekanun. The organism was later reclassified into a new species called &quot;B. thailandensis&quot;. This species has become a useful tool in the laboratory for the studies of the pathogenesis of &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot;. &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; was previously classified as part of the genus &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;. In 1992, the pathogen was formally named &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot;. In 1994, the First International Symposium on melioidosis was held in Kuala Lumpur where 80 delegates attended. Papers were presented and later published as a book. Subsequent congresses were held in Thailand, Australia, and Singapore once every three years. In 2002, &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; was classified as a &quot;Category B agent&quot;. In 2004, the complete genome of &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; was published. In 2012, &quot;B pseudomallei&quot; was classified as a &quot;Tier 1 select agent&quot; by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. In 2014, co-trimoxazole was established as the only oral eradication therapy rather than the combination therapy of co-trimoxazole with doxycycline. In 2016, a statistical model was developed to predict the occurrence of global melioidosis per year.

==Biological warfare==
Interest in melioidosis has been expressed because it has the potential to be developed as a biological weapon. Another similar bacterium, &quot;Burkholderia mallei&quot; was used by the Germans in World War I to infect livestock shipped to Allied countries. Deliberate infection of human prisoners of war and animals using &quot;B. mallei&quot; were carried out in China&#x27;s by the Japanese during World War II. The Soviet Union reportedly used &quot;B. mallei&quot; during the Soviet–Afghan War in 1982 and 1984. &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot;, like &quot;B. mallei&quot;, was studied by both the US and Soviet Union as a potential biological warfare agent, but never weaponized. Other countries such as Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Syria may have investigated the properties of &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; for biological weapons. The bacterium is readily available in the environment. It can also be aerosolized and transmitted via inhalation. However, the &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; has never been used in biological warfare. The actual risk of the deliberate release of &quot;B. pseudomallei&quot; or &quot;B. mallei&quot; is unknown.

<doc id="471450" wikidata="Q1373468" url="?curid=471450" title="Cascade (juggling)">
<text>In toss juggling, a cascade is the simplest juggling pattern achievable with an odd number of props. The simplest juggling pattern is the three-ball cascade, This is therefore the first pattern that most jugglers learn. However, although the shower requires more speed and precision, &quot;some people find that the movement comes naturally to them,&quot; and it may be the pattern learned first. &quot;Balls or other props follow a horizontal figure-eight [or hourglass figure] pattern above the hands.&quot; In siteswap, each throw in a cascade is notated using the number of balls; thus a three ball cascade is &quot;3&quot;.

&quot;In the cascade...the crossing of the balls between the hands demands that one hand catches at the same rate that the other hand throws . The hands also take turns ...&quot;

==Number of props==

===Three-ball===
For the three-ball cascade the juggler starts with two balls in one hand and the third ball in the other hand. One ball is thrown from the first hand in an arc to the other hand. Before catching this ball the juggler must throw the ball in the receiving hand, in a similar arc, to the first hand. The pattern continues in this manner with each hand in turn throwing one ball and catching another.

All balls are caught on the outside of the pattern (on the far left and right) and thrown from closer to the middle of the pattern. The hand moves toward the middle to throw, and back towards the outside to catch the next object. Because the hands must move up and down when throwing and catching, putting this movement together causes the left hand to move in a counterclockwise motion, and the right hand to move in a clockwise motion.

This pattern is achievable with a wide array of props besides regular balls. Commonly used props are clubs, rings and scarves. Because of their slow falling speed due to high air resistance, scarves are often used as a first prop for beginning jugglers.

The cascade is only performed with an odd number of objects (3, 5, 7, etc.) The basic pattern for an even number of objects is the fountain.

===Greater numbers===

When extended to higher numbers of props (five, seven, nine, etc.) the cascade maintains the basic pattern of throwing one prop before catching another on its way down. Higher numbers require the balls to be tossed higher into the air in order to allow more time for a complete cycle of throws. However, in order to keep the number of props in the juggler&#x27;s hands to a minimum, it is necessary to begin the pattern by throwing, from alternating hands, all but one prop (in the same hand as the first throw, which started with one more prop than the other) before any catches are made.

==Reverse cascade==
The reverse cascade, or outside cascade, is a juggling pattern in which the props follow the same path as the cascade, but with time going backwards, hence the &#x27;reverse&#x27;. One throws every ball with, &quot;an outward instead of an inward scoop,&quot; and throws, &quot;every ball over the incoming ball rather than under it.&quot;

The pattern is performed with an odd number of props. As in the cascade, props are thrown from alternating hands and each prop is caught in the opposite hand from which it was thrown. The key difference between a regular cascade and the reverse cascade (from a juggler&#x27;s point of view) is that one throws each object &quot;over&quot; rather than &quot;under&quot; the others, i.e., outside rather than inside.

While in a cascade objects are caught on the outside of the pattern (on the far left and right) and thrown from closer to the middle of the pattern, causing each ball to pass under the ball previously thrown, in a reverse cascade objects are caught near the middle of the pattern and thrown from the outside, causing each ball to pass above the ball previously thrown. Thus from the juggler&#x27;s perspective the left hand moves in a clockwise motion, and the right hand in a counterclockwise motion.

The reverse cascade is generally considered to be more difficult to perform than the cascade, with a difficulty rating of 4 rather than 2 out of 10. The reverse cascade is, &quot;perhaps the simplest,&quot; of, &quot;several possible patterns that can be juggled with crossed arms.&quot;

==Tennis==

Many tricks or patterns are generated from mixing cascade and reverse cascade throws. For example, for tennis (siteswap: 3) one ball is thrown over (reverse) while the other two are thrown under (inside). One juggles, &quot;a cascade with two balls while the &#x27;tennis&#x27; ball is thrown [back and forth] over the top.&quot;

Reverse tennis is where one ball is thrown inside while the other two are thrown over.

==Chops==
Chops is a juggling pattern based on the cascade, performed with 3 objects that involves a semicircular carry performed with either one or both hands (Single Chops/Double Chops). Chops can be performed continuously, by one or both hands, or in single instances.

The distinctive carry occurs at the moment of catch; rather than returning the ball into the cascade pattern the juggler carries the ball in their hand in a downward-pointing semicircle over the ball just thrown by the other hand, in the case of single chops, or over the other hand, in the case of double chops. At the end of the semicircular movement the carried ball is tossed virtually straight up to be caught by the other hand. The hand used to carry then quickly returns to its original position to catch the ball that was thrown by the other hand.

This pattern is of medium difficulty since very fast and controlled arm movements are necessary, though with practice, the pattern can actually be performed in a slow-looking motion.

==Variants==
Named variants include the &quot;overhead cascade&quot; and a virtually infinite number of cascade patterns such as 522, 720, 900, 72222, and so on (see article on Siteswap notation).

==Shannon&#x27;s theorem==

Claude Shannon, builder of the first juggling robot, developed a juggling theorem, relating the time balls spend in the air and in the hands: &quot;(F+D)H=(V+D)N&quot;, where &quot;F&quot; = time a ball spends in the air, &quot;D&quot; = time a ball spends in a hand/time a hand is full, &quot;V&quot; = time a hand is vacant, &quot;N&quot; = number of balls, and &quot;H&quot; = number of hands. For example, a hand&#x27;s and a ball&#x27;s perspectives in the two-hand (&quot;H&quot;) three-ball (&quot;N&quot;) cascade pattern:
 1st 2nd 3rd
 hand: D--VD—VD--V
 ball: D--F--D--F--
 R L
:(F+D)H=(V+D)N
:(3+3)2=(1+3)3
:6×2=4×3
:12=12

<doc id="471451" wikidata="Q7712772" url="?curid=471451" title="The Afghan Women">
<text>The Afghan Women is a play by Emmy Award-winning playwright William Mastrosimone. It was produced by the Passage Theatre Company and premiered in 2003 at the Mill Hill Playhouse in Trenton, New Jersey. The first dozen performances raised US$10,000 for Afghan orphans. In January 2004, Mastrosimone presented a reading of the play to actors in Kabul which is the capital of Afghanistan.

==Plot summary==
The play is set after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. The heroine is an Afghan woman who had fled her homeland during the Civil War, but now returns from the United States to found an orphanage. In the ensuing plot, a warlord fails as he attempts a coup. As he retreats, he tries to use the orphans as human shields, prompting the heroine to kill the warlord. She then inspires the warlord&#x27;s vengeful son to find choices other than violence, a theme that is common throughout Afghanistan.

<text>Viscount Combermere, of Bhurtpore in the East Indies and of Combermere in the County Palatine of Chester, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1827 for the prominent military commander Stapleton Stapleton-Cotton, 1st Baron Combermere. He had already been created Baron Combermere, of Combermere in the County Palatine of Chester, in 1814, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He had previously inherited the baronetcy, of Combermere in the County Palatine of Chester, which was created in the Baronetage of England on 29 March 1677 for his great-great-grandfather Robert Cotton.

The title of the baronetcy, barony and viscountcy, Combermere, is pronounced &quot;Cumbermeer&quot;.

The first baronet represented Cheshire in the House of Commons. His grandson, the third Baronet, sat as a Member of Parliament for Cheshire as well as for Lostwithiel. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Baronet. He represented Denbighshire in the House of Commons. His son, the fifth Baronet, also represented Cheshire in Parliament. The latter was succeeded by his son, the sixth Baronet, who was later elevated to the peerage as Viscount Combermere. His son, the second Viscount, sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Carrickfergus. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the sixth Viscount, who succeeded his father in 2000.

Until 1919, the family seat of the viscounts Combermere was Combermere Abbey in Combermere Park, between Nantwich and Whitchurch in Cheshire. The traditional burial place of the viscounts was at St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Wrenbury.

== Slave trading ==

Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere was a joint owner of a number of plantations on St Kitts and Nevis between 1822 and 1834. He was appointed the Governor of Barbados in 1817 meaning he was involved with overseeing the operation of plantations, slaves being shipped in and out of the island through purchase and sales of African people and the overall use of slaves on the island. He also received a considerable amount of compensation (around £920,000 in today&#x27;s currency) for the loss of 420 enslaved people, at the time of release, on his estates.

<text>Robert Swan Mueller III (; born August 7, 1944) is an American lawyer who served as the sixth director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) from 2001 to 2013.

A graduate of Princeton University and New York University, Mueller served as a Marine Corps officer during the Vietnam War, receiving a Bronze Star for heroism and a Purple Heart. He subsequently attended the University of Virginia School of Law. Mueller is a registered Republican in Washington, D.C., and was appointed and reappointed to Senate-confirmed positions by presidents George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama.

Mueller has served both in government and private practice. He was an assistant United States attorney, a United States attorney, United States assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division, a homicide prosecutor in Washington, D.C., acting United States deputy attorney general, partner at D.C. law firm WilmerHale and director of the FBI. He is the only FBI Director that Congress has allowed to serve more than the statutory limit of 10 years since the death of J. Edgar Hoover in 1972 by giving him a special two-year extension.

On May 17, 2017, Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as special counsel overseeing an investigation into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and related matters. He submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr on March 22, 2019. On April 18, the Department of Justice released it. On May 29, he resigned his post and the Office of the Special Counsel was closed.

== Early life and education ==
Mueller was born on August 7, 1944, at Doctors Hospital in the New York City borough of Manhattan, the first child of Alice C. Truesdale (1920–2007) and Robert Swan Mueller Jr. (1916–2007). He has four younger sisters: Susan, Sandra, Joan, and Patricia. His father was an executive with DuPont who had served as a Navy officer in the Atlantic and Mediterranean theaters during World War II. His father majored in psychology at Princeton University and played varsity lacrosse.

Mueller is of German, English, and Scottish descent. His paternal great-grandfather, Gustave A. Mueller, was a prominent doctor in Pittsburgh, whose own father, August C. E. Müller, had immigrated to the United States in 1855 from the Province of Pomerania in the Kingdom of Prussia (a historical territory whose area included land now part of Poland and the north-eastern edge of Germany). On his mother&#x27;s side, he is a great-grandson of the railroad executive William Truesdale.

Mueller grew up in Princeton, New Jersey, where he attended Princeton Country Day School (now known as the Princeton Day School). After he completed eighth grade, his family moved to Philadelphia while Mueller himself went on to attend St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire for high school, where he was captain of the soccer, hockey, and lacrosse teams and won the Gordon Medal as the school&#x27;s top athlete in 1962. A lacrosse teammate and classmate at St. Paul&#x27;s School was future Massachusetts Senator and Secretary of State John Kerry.

After graduating from St. Paul&#x27;s, Mueller entered Princeton University, where he continued to play lacrosse, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in politics in 1966 after completing a senior thesis titled &quot;Acceptance of Jurisdiction in the South West Africa Cases.&quot; Mueller was a member of University Cottage Club while he was a student at Princeton. Mueller earned a Master of Arts in international relations from New York University in 1967.

In 1968, Mueller joined the United States Marine Corps. After his military service, he enrolled at the University of Virginia School of Law where he served on the &quot;Virginia Law Review&quot; and graduated in 1973.

== United States Marine Corps service ==

Mueller has cited the combat death of his Princeton lacrosse teammate David Spencer Hackett in the Vietnam War as an influence on his decision to pursue military service. Of his classmate, Mueller has said, &quot;One of the reasons I went into the Marine Corps was because we lost a very good friend, a Marine in Vietnam, who was a year ahead of me at Princeton. There were a number of us who felt we should follow his example and at least go into the service. And it flows from there.&quot; Hackett was a Marine Corps first lieutenant in the infantry and was killed in 1967 in Quảng Trị province by small arms fire.

After waiting a year so a knee injury could heal, Mueller was accepted for officer training in the United States Marine Corps in 1968, attending training at Parris Island, Officer Candidate School, Army Ranger School, and Army jump school. Of these, he said later that he considered Ranger School the most valuable because he felt &quot;more than anything teaches you about how you react with no sleep and nothing to eat.&quot;

In the summer of 1968, he was sent to South Vietnam, where he served as a rifle platoon leader as a second lieutenant with Second Platoon, H Company, 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, 3rd Marine Division. On December 11, 1968, during an engagement in Operation Scotland II, he earned the Bronze Star with &quot;V&quot; device for combat valor for rescuing a wounded Marine under enemy fire during an ambush in which he saw half of his platoon become casualties. In April 1969, he received an enemy gunshot wound in the thigh, recovered, and returned to lead his platoon until June 1969. For his service in and during the Vietnam War, his military decorations and awards include: the Bronze Star Medal with Combat &quot;V&quot;, Purple Heart Medal, two Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals with Combat &quot;V&quot;, Combat Action Ribbon, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal with four service stars, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross, Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, and Parachutist Badge.

After recuperating at a field hospital near Da Nang, Mueller became aide-de-camp to 3rd Marine Division&#x27;s commanding general, then–Major General William K. Jones, where he &quot;significantly contributed to the rapport&quot; Jones had with other officers, according to one report.

Mueller had originally considered making the Marines his career, but he explained later that he found non-combat life in the corps to be unexciting. After returning from South Vietnam, Mueller was briefly stationed at Henderson Hall, before leaving active-duty service in August 1970 at the rank of captain.

Reflecting on his service in the Vietnam War, Mueller said, &quot;I consider myself exceptionally lucky to have made it out of Vietnam. There were many—many—who did not. And perhaps because I did survive Vietnam, I have always felt compelled to contribute.&quot; In 2009, he told a writer that despite his other accomplishments, he was still &quot;most proud the Marine Corps deemed me worthy of leading other Marines.&quot;

== Career ==

=== Private practice and Department of Justice ===

After receiving his Juris Doctor in 1973 from the University of Virginia School of Law, Mueller worked as a litigator at the firm Pillsbury, Madison and Sutro in San Francisco until 1976. He then served for 12 years in United States Attorney offices. He first worked in the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California in San Francisco, where he rose to be chief of the criminal division, and in 1982, he moved to Boston to work in the office of the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts as an Assistant United States Attorney, where he investigated and prosecuted major financial fraud, terrorism and public corruption cases, as well as narcotics conspiracies and international money launderers.

After serving as a partner at the Boston law firm of Hill and Barlow, Mueller returned to government service. In 1989, he served in the United States Department of Justice as an assistant to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and as acting deputy attorney general. James Baker, with whom he worked on national security matters, said he had &quot;an appreciation for the Constitution and the rule of law&quot;.

In 1990, Mueller became the United States Assistant Attorney General in charge of the United States Department of Justice Criminal Division. During his tenure, he oversaw prosecutions including that of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, the Pan Am Flight 103 (Lockerbie bombing) case, and of the Gambino crime family boss John Gotti.

In 1991, Mueller declared the government had been investigating the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) since 1986 in more-than-usual media exposure. Also in 1991, he was elected a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers.

In 1993, Mueller became a partner at Boston&#x27;s Hale and Dorr, specializing in white-collar crime litigation. He returned to public service in 1995 as senior litigator in the homicide section of the District of Columbia United States Attorney&#x27;s Office. In 1998, Mueller was named U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California and held that position until 2001.

=== Federal Bureau of Investigation ===
President George W. Bush nominated Mueller for the position of FBI director on July 5, 2001. He and two other candidates, Washington lawyer George J. Terwilliger III and veteran Chicago prosecutor and white-collar crime defense lawyer Dan Webb, were up for the job, but Mueller, described at the time as a conservative Republican, was always considered the front-runner. Terwilliger and Webb both pulled out from consideration around mid-June, while confirmation hearings for Mueller before the Senate Judiciary Committee were quickly set for July 30, only three days before his prostate cancer surgery.

The Senate unanimously confirmed Mueller as FBI director on August 2, 2001, voting 98–0 in favor of his appointment. He had previously served as acting deputy attorney general of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) for several months before officially becoming the FBI director on September 4, 2001, one week before the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

On February 11, 2003, one month before the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, Mueller gave testimony to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Mueller informed the American public that &quot;[s]even countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism—Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Cuba, and North Korea—remain active in the United States and continue to support terrorist groups that have targeted Americans. As Director Tenet has pointed out, Secretary Powell presented evidence last week that Baghdad has failed to disarm its weapons of mass destruction, willfully attempting to evade and deceive the international community. Our particular concern is that Saddam Hussein may supply terrorists with biological, chemical or radiological material.&quot; Highlighting this worry in February 2003, FBI Special Agent Coleen Rowley wrote an open letter to Mueller in which she warned that &quot;the bureau will [not] be able to stem the flood of terrorism that will likely head our way in the wake of an attack on Iraq&quot; and encouraged Mueller to &quot;share [her concerns] with the President and Attorney General.&quot;

On March 10, 2004, while United States Attorney General John Ashcroft was at the George Washington University Hospital for gallbladder surgery, then deputy attorney general James Comey received a call from Ashcroft&#x27;s wife informing him that White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales were about to visit Ashcroft to convince him to renew a program of warrantless wiretapping under the Terrorist Surveillance Program which the DOJ ruled unconstitutional. Ashcroft refused to sign, as he had previously agreed, but the following day the White House renewed the program anyway. Mueller and Comey then threatened to resign. On March 12, 2004, after private, individual meetings with Mueller and Comey at the White House, the president supported changing the program to satisfy the concerns of Mueller, Ashcroft, and Comey.

He was inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame in 2004.

As director, Mueller also barred FBI personnel from participating in enhanced interrogations with the CIA. At a dinner, Mueller defended an attorney, Thomas Wilner, who had been attacked for his role in defending Kuwaiti detainees. Mueller stood up, raised his glass, and said, &quot;I toast Tom Wilner. He&#x27;s doing what an American should.&quot; However, the White House pushed back, encouraging more vigorous methods of pursuing and interrogating terror suspects. When Bush confronted Mueller to ask him to round up more terrorists in the U.S., Mueller responded, saying, &quot;If they [suspects] don&#x27;t commit a crime, it would be difficult to identify and isolate&quot; them. Vice President Dick Cheney objected by saying, &quot;That&#x27;s just not good enough. We&#x27;re hearing this too much from the FBI.&quot;

In May 2011, President Barack Obama asked Mueller to continue at the helm of the FBI for two additional years beyond his normal 10-year term, which would have expired on September 4, 2011. The Senate approved this request 100–0 on July 27, 2011. On September 4, 2013, Mueller was replaced by James Comey.

In June 2013, Mueller defended NSA surveillance programs in testimony before a House Judiciary Committee hearing. He said that surveillance programs could have &quot;derailed&quot; the September 11 attacks. Congressman John Conyers disagreed: &quot;I am not persuaded that that makes it OK to collect every call.&quot; Mueller also testified that the government&#x27;s surveillance programs complied &quot;in full with U.S. law and with basic rights guaranteed under the Constitution&quot;. He said that &quot;We are taking all necessary steps to hold Edward Snowden responsible for these disclosures.&quot;

On June 19, 2017, in the case of &quot;Arar v. Ashcroft&quot;, Mueller, along with Ashcroft and former Immigration and Naturalization Services Commissioner James W. Ziglar and others, was shielded from civil liability by the Supreme Court for post-9/11 detention of Muslims under policies then brought into place.

=== Return to private sector ===

After leaving the FBI in 2013, Mueller served a one-year term as consulting professor and the Arthur and Frank Payne distinguished lecturer at Stanford University, where he focused on issues related to cybersecurity.

In addition to his speaking and teaching roles, Mueller also joined the law firm WilmerHale as a partner in its Washington office in 2014. Among other roles at the firm, he oversaw the independent investigation into the NFL&#x27;s conduct surrounding the video that appeared to show NFL player Ray Rice assaulting his fiancée. In January 2016, he was appointed as Settlement Master in the U.S. consumer litigation over the Volkswagen emissions scandal; as of May 11, 2017, the scandal has resulted in $11.2billion in customer settlements.

On October 19, 2016, Mueller began an external review of &quot;security, personnel, and management processes and practices&quot; at government contractor Booz Allen Hamilton after Harold T. Martin III was indicted for massive data theft from the National Security Agency. On April 6, 2017, he was appointed as Special Master for disbursement of $850million and $125million for automakers and consumers, respectively, affected by rupture-prone Takata airbags.

Mueller received the 2016 Thayer Award for public service from the United States Military Academy. In June 2017, he received the Baker Award for intelligence and national security contributions from the nonprofit Intelligence and National Security Alliance.

In October 2019, it was announced that Mueller, along with James L. Quarles and Aaron Zebley, would return to WilmerHale to resume private practice. On July 11, 2020, Mueller wrote an op-ed on The Washington Post stating that Roger Stone &quot;remains a convicted felon, and rightly so&quot; after the President of the United States granted Roger Stone clemency and defended his investigation.

=== Special Counsel for the Department of Justice ===


On May 16, 2017, Mueller met with President Trump as a courtesy to provide perspectives on the FBI and input on considerations for hiring a new FBI Director. This meeting was initially widely reported to have been an interview to serve again as the FBI Director. President Trump broached resuming the position in their meeting; however, Mueller was ineligible to return as FBI Director due to statutory term limits, and Mueller lacked interest in resuming the position.

The next day, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller to serve as special counsel for the United States Department of Justice. In this capacity, Mueller oversaw the investigation into &quot;any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump, and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation&quot;.

Mueller&#x27;s appointment to oversee the investigation immediately garnered widespread support from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. Newt Gingrich, former Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives and prominent conservative political commentator, stated via Twitter that &quot;Robert Mueller is a superb choice to be special counsel. His reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity.&quot; Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) said, &quot;Former Director Mueller is exactly the right kind of individual for this job. I now have significantly greater confidence that the investigation will follow the facts wherever they lead.&quot; Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) stated, &quot;former FBI dir. Mueller is well qualified to oversee this probe&quot;. Some, however, pointed out an alleged conflict of interest. &quot;The federal code could not be clearer—Mueller is compromised by his apparent conflict of interest in being close with James Comey,&quot; Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ), who first called for Mueller to step down over the summer, said in a statement to Fox News. &quot;The appearance of a conflict is enough to put Mueller in violation of the code. … All of the revelations in recent weeks make the case stronger.&quot;

Upon his appointment as special counsel, Mueller and two colleagues (former FBI agent Aaron Zebley and former assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force James L. Quarles III) resigned from WilmerHale. On May 23, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice ethics experts announced they had declared Mueller ethically able to function as special counsel. The spokesperson for the special counsel, Peter Carr, told NBC News that Mueller has taken an active role in managing the inquiry. In an interview with the Associated Press, Rosenstein said he would recuse himself from supervision of Mueller if he were to become a subject in the investigation due to his role in the dismissal of James Comey.

On June 14, 2017, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Mueller&#x27;s office was also investigating Trump personally for possible obstruction of justice, in reference to the Russian probe. The report was questioned by Trump&#x27;s legal team attorney Jay Sekulow, who said on June 18 on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, &quot;The President is not and has not been under investigation for obstruction, period.&quot; Due to the central role of the Trump family in the campaign, the transition, and the White House, the President&#x27;s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was also reportedly under scrutiny by Mueller. Also in June, Trump allegedly ordered the firing of Robert Mueller, but backed down when then-White House Counsel Don McGahn threatened to quit.

During a discussion about national security at the Aspen security conference on July 21, 2017, former CIA director John Brennan reaffirmed his support for Mueller and called for members of Congress to resist if Trump fires Mueller. He also said it was &quot;the obligation of some executive-branch officials to refuse to carry out some of these orders that, again, are inconsistent with what this country is all about&quot;. After Peter Strzok, an investigator for Mueller, was removed from the investigation for alleged partiality, Senator Mark Warner, the Ranking Member of the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in a speech on December 20, 2017, before the Senate, warned of a constitutional crisis if the President fired Mueller. On June 22, 2018, Warner hosted a fundraising party for 100 guests and was quoted there saying, &quot;If you get me one more glass of wine, I&#x27;ll tell you stuff only Bob Mueller and I know. If you think you&#x27;ve seen wild stuff so far, buckle up. It&#x27;s going to be a wild couple of months.&quot;
On October 30, 2017, Mueller filed charges against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and campaign co-chairman Rick Gates. The 12 charges include conspiracy to launder money, violations of the 1938 Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) as being an unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading FARA statements, and conspiracy against the United States.

On December 1, 2017, Mueller reached a plea agreement with former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to giving false testimony to the FBI about his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. As part of Flynn&#x27;s negotiations, his son, Michael G. Flynn, was not expected to be charged, and Flynn was prepared to testify that high-level officials on Trump&#x27;s team directed him to make contact with the Russians. On February 16, 2018, Mueller indicted 13 Russian individuals and 3 Russian companies for attempting to trick Americans into consuming Russian propaganda that targeted Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and later President-elect Donald Trump.

On February 20, 2018, Mueller charged attorney Alex van der Zwaan with making false statements in the Russia probe.

On May 20, 2018, Trump criticized Mueller, tweeting &quot;the World&#x27;s most expensive Witch Hunt has found nothing on Russia &amp; me so now they are looking at the rest of the World!&quot; Mueller started investigating the August 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and an emissary for the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The emissary offered help to the Trump presidential campaign. Mueller was also investigating the Trump campaign&#x27;s possible ties to Turkey, Qatar, Israel, and China.

On December 18, 2018, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published an article concerning a report prepared for the U.S. Senate which stated that Russian disinformation teams had targeted Mueller.

On March 22, 2019, Mueller concluded his investigation and submitted the special counsel&#x27;s final report to Attorney General William Barr. A senior Department of Justice official said that the report did not recommend any new indictments. On March 24, Attorney General Barr submitted a summary of findings to the United States Congress. He stated in his letter, &quot;The Special Counsel&#x27;s investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russian in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.&quot; Mueller&#x27;s report also reportedly did not take a stance on whether or not Trump committed obstruction of justice; Barr quoted Mueller as saying &quot;while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.&quot;
On April 18, 2019, the Department of Justice released &quot;Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election&quot;, the special counsel&#x27;s final report and its conclusions.

On May 29, 2019, Mueller announced that he was retiring as special counsel and that the office would be shut down, and he spoke publicly about the report for the first time. Saying &quot;The report is my testimony,&quot; he indicated he would have nothing to say that was not already in the report. On the subject of obstruction of justice, he said, &quot;under long-standing Department [of Justice] policy, a president cannot be charged with a crime while he is in office.&quot; He repeated his official conclusion that the report neither accused nor exonerated the president while adding that any potential wrongdoing by a president must be addressed by a &quot;process other than the criminal justice system.&quot; Mueller reasserted the involvement of Russian operatives in the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak and their parallel efforts to influence American public opinion using social media. Referring to those actions, he declared that &quot;there were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election. That allegation deserves the attention of every American.&quot;

Robert Mueller was initially scheduled to publicly testify before two House committees on July 17, 2019, with two hours for lawmakers to ask questions, but the hearing was postponed to July 24 with a third hour added for questions. His verbal testimony was expected to help inform the public, and to help Democratic leadership decide whether or not to impeach the President. In particular, the Democrats aimed to highlight what they considered to be the worst examples of Trump&#x27;s conduct. Representative Jamie Raskin from Maryland said he would use visual aids, such as posters, to help people understand the implications of the Mueller report. Republicans, on the other hand, planned to question Mueller on the origins of this investigation.

On July 24, 2019, Mueller attended both congressional committee hearings and was questioned by members of Congress. His testimony followed the guidelines he had stated would be appropriate regarding his report. In fact, many of his responses were one-word replies. He said he was &quot;not familiar&quot; with Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that commissioned the Steele dossier. He rejected claims that his investigation was a &quot;witch hunt&quot; or that it totally exonerated the President. He declined to answer questions outside of the scope of his investigation, but reiterated his concern about foreign interference with American elections. He noted that it continues, that he expects it to expand to include other foreign governments as well as the Russians, and that he considers it a great threat to the United States. According to the Nielsen Company, total viewership for the Mueller hearing fell just shy of 13million, significantly lower than other hearings involving the Trump administration, such as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh&#x27;s (20.4million), former FBI director James Comey&#x27;s (19.5million), and former Trump attorney Michael Cohen&#x27;s (15.8million). Reasons for this comparatively low television rating include the fact that the hearing occurred in July, vacation time for many Americans, and months after the release of the Mueller report. Fox News Channel enjoyed the top rating, with 3.03million views. Subsequently, Mueller&#x27;s words were distorted and misinterpreted to both defend and condemn the President. Mueller&#x27;s testimony was criticized by some as uncharacteristically confusing.

In late September 2019, it was reported Trump may have lied to Mueller about his knowledge of his campaign&#x27;s contacts with WikiLeaks, citing the grand jury redactions in the Mueller report.

Political scientists William G. Howell and Terry M. Moe described Mueller&#x27;s decision not to take a position on obstruction of justice for Trump—despite &quot;compiling a mountain of incriminating evidence&quot;—as something that &quot;will surely go down as one of the strangest—and most consequential—moves in modern legal history.&quot; They added, &quot;in refusing to draw legal conclusions from his evidence, Mueller simply didn&#x27;t do his job... because he didn&#x27;t, he failed to carry out his duty to tell the American people what his investigation actually revealed about Trump&#x27;s lawless behavior, and he failed to draw a bright line that would keep future presidents within legal bounds.&quot;

The University of Virginia Law School announced in June 2021 that in the coming fall Mueller would participate in a six-session course called &quot;The Mueller Report and the Role of the Special Counsel,&quot; along with three of his colleagues from the investigation.

In July 2024, the publisher Simon &amp; Schuster announced that the book &quot;Interference: The Inside Story of Trump, Russia, and the Mueller Investigation&quot; will be released in September. Its authors are Aaron Zebley, James Quarles, and Andrew Goldstein, whom Mueller recruited for his investigation as Special Counsel. Mueller wrote the introduction.

== Personal life ==
Mueller met his future wife, Ann Cabell Standish, at a high school party when they were 17. Standish attended Miss Porter&#x27;s School in Farmington, Connecticut, and Sarah Lawrence College, before working as a special-education teacher for children with learning disabilities. In September 1966, they married at St. Stephen&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Sewickley, Pennsylvania. They have two daughters and three grandchildren. One of their daughters was born with spina bifida.

In 2001, Mueller&#x27;s Senate confirmation hearings to head the FBI were delayed several months while he underwent treatment for prostate cancer. He was diagnosed in the fall of 2000, postponing being sworn in as FBI director until he received a good prognosis from his physician.

Although raised Presbyterian, he became an Episcopalian later in life.

Mueller and William Barr—the attorney general who supervised the late stage of Mueller&#x27;s special counsel investigation—have known each other since the 1980s and have been described as good friends. Mueller attended the weddings of two of Barr&#x27;s daughters, and their wives attend Bible study together.

<text>Viscount Bridport is a title that has been created twice, once in the Peerage of Great Britain and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The first creation became extinct in 1814, while the second creation is extant.

==History==
Sir Alexander Hood, younger brother of Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood, was a prominent naval commander. In 1794, he was created Baron Bridport in the Peerage of Ireland, with remainder to his great-nephew Samuel Hood, second son of Henry Hood (later 2nd Viscount Hood), eldest son of the 1st Viscount Hood, and in failure thereof to the heirs male of his uncle Alexander Hood (who was the ancestor of the Fuller-Acland-Hood baronets of St Audries and the Barons St Audies). In 1796, he was created Baron Bridport, of Cricket St Thomas in the County of Somerset, in the Peerage of Great Britain, and in 1800, he was even further honoured when he was made Viscount Bridport, of Cricket St Thomas in the County of Somerset, also in the Peerage of Great Britain. The latter titles were created with normal remainders to the male heirs of his body. 

The 1st Viscount Bridport died without male issue in 1814, and the barony of 1796 and the viscountcy of 1800 became extinct. However, he was succeeded in the barony of 1794, according to the special remainder, by his aforementioned great-nephew, Samuel Hood, the 2nd Baron Bridport. He notably represented Heytesbury in Parliament. In 1810, the 2nd Baron Bridport married Lady Charlotte Mary Nelson, 3rd Duchess of Bronte, the only surviving child and heiress of William Nelson, 1st Earl Nelson, elder brother of Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson. Lord Bridport was succeeded by his son Alexander Hood, the 3rd Baron Bridport. He was a General in the Army. In 1868, he was further created Viscount Bridport, of Cricket St Thomas in the County of Somerset and of Bronte, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, a revival of the title given to his great-great-uncle sixty-eight years earlier. In 1873, he also inherited from his mother the title of Duke of Bronte (Italian: &quot;Duca di Bronte&quot;), of the Kingdom of Sicily and the Duchy of Maniace. This ducal title was conferred on his great-great-uncle, Horatio Nelson, in 1799 by King Ferdinand, as a reward for his support of the monarchy.

While his eldest son Arthur Hood succeeded him as 2nd Viscount Bridport, he left the Dukedom of Bronte to his younger son, the Hon. Sir Alexander Nelson Hood, who became the 5th Duke of Bronte. This was possible because of a special and unusual clause in the letters patent granting the dukedom, which allowed the title&#x27;s holder to choose whoever he wanted as successor. The 2nd Viscount represented West Somerset in Parliament as a Conservative. He was succeeded by his grandson Rowland Hood, the 3rd Viscount Bridport and 6th Duke of Bronte. He was the son of the Hon. Maurice Henry Nelson Hood, who was killed in action at Gallipoli in 1915. The 3rd Viscount Bridport was a Lieutenant-Commander in the Royal Navy and also held minor political office from 1939 to 1940 under Neville Chamberlain.

The titles are currently held by his only surviving son, Alexander Hood, the 4th Viscount Bridport and 7th Duke of Bronte, who succeeded in 1969. As a descendant of Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood, he is also in remainder to this peerage and its subsidiary titles.
