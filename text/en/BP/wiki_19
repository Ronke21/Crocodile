<text>Crouch End is an area of North London, England, from the City of London in the western half of the borough of Haringey. It is within the Hornsey postal district (N8). It has been described as one of &quot;a new breed of urban villages&quot; in London. In 2023, it was voted the best place to live in London.

==Location==
Crouch End lies between Harringay to the east; Muswell Hill to the north-west; Hornsey to the north; Wood Green to the north-east; Finsbury Park, Stroud Green and Archway to the south; and Highgate to the west. It is located north of Charing Cross and from the City of London.

== Toponymy ==
The name Crouch End is derived from Middle English. A &quot;crouch&quot; meant cross while an &quot;end&quot; referred to an outlying area. Some think that this refers to the borders of the parish, in other words, the area where the influence of the parish ends.

Its name has been recorded as Crouchend (1465), Crowchende (1480), the Crouche Ende (1482), and Crutche Ende (1553). In 1593, it was recorded as &quot;Cruch End&quot;.

==History==
Crouch End was the junction of four locally important roads. A wooden cross was erected at the junction of these roads, roughly where the Clock Tower now stands, and a small settlement developed around it. Crouch End developed as an early centre of cultivation for Hornsey, and was where the farmsteads seem to have been grouped.

From the later part of the eighteenth century, Crouch End became home to wealthy London merchants seeking refuge from the City. However, the area remained rural in character until around 1880. The development of the railway changed the area significantly. By 1887 there were seven railway stations in the area.

Although the first patch of urbanisation along Park Road (Maynard Street until c1870) was distinctly working-class in character, by the end of the 19th century, the large merchants&#x27; villas had been replaced by urban middle-class housing and Crouch End had become a comfortable middle-class London suburb with a varied and popular range of shops.

Until 1965 Crouch End was part of the Municipal Borough of Hornsey and that body&#x27;s forerunners. In 1965, when local government in London was reorganised, Hornsey merged with the boroughs of Wood Green and Tottenham, and Crouch End became part of the London Borough of Haringey.

In the post-war years, the London-wide provision of social housing led to the demolition of the Park Road housing development and its replacement with council homes. Many of the older houses in the area lay empty post-war and many were bought cheaply by speculative landlords who then let them out to the growing student populations of the Mountview and Hornsey Art College. The area became known as bedsit land into the early 1980s, until rising house prices changed the social profile of the area and progressively wealthier residents moved in.

==Demographics==
There is no single figure that provides the demographic profile for Crouch End. As defined by the recent public-council conversation around the setting up of the Crouch End neighbourhood Forum, the neighbourhood is made up of parts of four wards. Between a half and two thirds of the area is formed by Crouch End ward. Its demographics in the 2011 census were as follows:

British 61.1%, White Other 17.5%, Irish 3.4%, Indian 1.6%, Black African 1.5%.

Christian 38.4%, Jewish 4.2%, Muslim 3.1% (no religion 41.2%).

==Notable buildings==
===Hornsey Town Hall===

Among its more prominent buildings is the modernistic Hornsey Town Hall, built by the Municipal Borough of Hornsey as their seat of government in 1933–35. It is now a Grade II* listed building, one of about 21,767. The architect was the New Zealand-born Reginald Uren. The interior and exterior have been used several times as a location by the BBC series &quot;The Hour&quot;, written by Abi Morgan, and other TV and films, including a scene in &quot;The Crown&quot;. 

Queen and the Kinks have both played at the Hornsey Town Hall when it was a major London venue for bands. The HTH was used as a set in the Queen film Bohemian Rhapsody.

The building is currently undergoing renovation and conversion into a hotel, apartments, restaurant and a contemporary arts centre by the Far East Consortium. Completion is expected to be by Summer 2024.

===Clocktower===
The red-brick Clock Tower has become a much-loved icon of Crouch End. Designed by the architect Frederick Knight, it was originally built as a memorial to Henry Reader Williams in 1895. Williams was chairman of the local authority of Hornsey from 1880 to 1894, and played a key part in shaping the district, in particular campaigning against developers for the preservation of Highgate Wood and Queen&#x27;s Wood. He also paved the way for the purchase of Alexandra Palace and Park by a consortium of local authorities in 1901. After Williams&#x27;s retirement the newly designated Hornsey Urban District Council decided to erect a clock tower to celebrate his achievements.

Out of the estimated cost of £1200, £900 was raised by public subscription. On 23 June 1895 a ceremony was held for its unveiling. The Broadway was hung with flags, and the Tower connected to nearby houses with festoons. Over a thousand people assembled, and at noon the Earl of Stafford, Lord-Lieutenant of Middlesex, released a blue ribbon hanging from the belfry and the clock struck its first notes. The bronze sculpture of the head of Williams was created by Alfred Gilbert, who also designed Eros in Piccadilly Circus.

Although closed to the public, it is now used at Christmas for a Santa&#x27;s Grotto.

===Crouch End Hippodrome===

The Crouch End Hippodrome originally opened on Tottenham Lane in July 1897 as the Queen&#x27;s Opera House with a production of &quot;The Geisha&quot;. The theatre was leased initially by H. H. Morell and Frederick Mouillot (who at the time owned another 17 theatres between them). It held an audience of 1,500 people. In 1907, it was renamed the Hippodrome and became a popular music hall. During a bombing raid in 1940 it was very badly damaged. It is now a Virgin Active gym.

===Hornsey College of Art===

In 1880 an art school was established by Charles Swinstead, an artist and teacher who lived at Crouch End. It became &quot;an iconic British art institution, renowned for its experimental and progressive approach to art and design education&quot;. In May 1968, as Hornsey College of Art, it was occupied by students as a protest against the ideology of art education and teaching in Britain. The occupation, soon joined by others around the country, and linked with similar events in Paris, offered a major critique of the education system at the time.

After the authorities regained control, known as the &quot;night of the dogs&quot;, sympathetic lecturers and students who had taken part (including Tom Nairn and Kim Howells) were dismissed. Later the college was merged with Middlesex Polytechnic, now University, in the 1970s. Subsequently, it was relocated to a Middlesex campus at Alexandra Palace and the lease of the building taken over by the TUC, which used it as its national training centre. In 2005 Haringey Council took it over, extending and converting the building in order to enlarge Coleridge Primary School.

===The Queens Pub===
One of the early Edwardian pubs-with-hotel, the Queen&#x27;s was built in 1899–1902 by developer John Cathles Hill. The pub&#x27;s Art Nouveau decor windows survive. Its larger sister pub, the Salisbury Hotel (now The Salisbury) in Harringay has some similar architectural details.

===Dunns Bakery===

Purpose built in 1850 to be a bakery, Dunns Bakery at 6 The Broadway is most likely the oldest retail building within Crouch End. At the top of the front facade one can see a gilded wheat sheaf which bears the initials of the builder, &#x27;WM&#x27;
Originally the gates located to the right of the store led to a yard area where the stables were located to house the horses used for deliveries. The stables had been damaged in the Blitz during a night time raid, and have since been rebuilt, expanding the bakery area.

The bakery continues to produce on site to this day, and is run by a sixth generation baker.

==Education==

There are three state secondary schools serving the N8 Crouch End area. Highgate Wood School in Montenotte Road is a nine form entry mixed school. Highgate Wood School was the senior school to the former Crouch End School based on the corner of Wolseley Road and Park Road, opposite the Maynard Arms. Hornsey School for Girls in Inderwick Road is the only single sex school in N8. In Hornsey, there is the Greig City Academy (formerly St David and St Katherines). Further away Heartlands High School which lies between Wood Green and Alexandra Palace was opened by Haringey in 2010; despite not being in Crouch End it is close enough to provide additional provision. St Thomas More Catholic School, Wood Green is the only Roman Catholic secondary school in the London Borough of Haringey.

Over 6,000 children school in the area, approx 2,300 in primary schools and 3,700 in secondary schools (11-18).

Kestrel House is an independent special school for pupils with autistic spectrum conditions and additional learning and behavioural needs. The vast majority of pupils are referred by local authorities in London and the Home Counties who pay the fees. It is housed in the former Mountview Theatre School premises at the north end of Crouch Hill -the end nearest Crouch End Broadway. Also in the independent (fee paying sector) are Highgate School and Channing School, both used by parents in Crouch End but located in Highgate.

There are a number of primary schools serving Crouch End (seven in total within the N8 postcode): Weston Park, Rokesly School, Coleridge Primary School at the top of Crouch End Hill near the border with Islington, St Aidans in Stroud Green (not N8), St Gildas and St Peter-in Chains, just off Crouch Hill and St Mary&#x27;s in Hornsey. Campsbourne Primary School on Nightingale Lane, North Harringay Primary School on Falkland Road and Ashmount Primary School. Ashmount was until December 2012 on the south side of Hornsey Lane, in Islington and in the N19 postal district, but only meters from Haringey. (The border between Haringey and Islington runs down Hornsey Lane.) The school moved January 2013 to a new building in Crouch Hill Park adjacent to the Parkland Walk in N8.

There are many nursery schools in the area, including Bright Horizons, Creative Explorers, Starshine, Keiki and MTO.

==Library provision==

Hornsey Library is located on Haringey Park, N8. The Grade II listed building is on a site adjoining the south side of Hornsey Town Hall. It has recently had a major refurbishment, including the fountain area, but due to RACC the main library building has a temporary crash desk, so full of scaffolding, while the roof is being replaced. 

The library contains a large book stock, DVDs, provides free access to the Internet, meeting rooms for adult education classes, the Original Gallery for art exhibitions, literary groups and performers. There is also a children&#x27;s library, where events for pre-school children take place.

Permanent artwork includes the engraved Hornsey Window by Fred Mitchell, and a bronze sculpture outside by Huxley-Jones. The library contains the Community and Youth Music Library, one of largest collections of music sets in the country. Owned by a charitable company, it was started over 100 years ago and is now located semi-permanently at Hornsey Library.

Since 2022 it has been one of 4 centres of the Crouch End Festival, and the Crouch End Literary Festival, with events covering arts, culture, comedy, music, drama, spoken word and live street art.

==Parks==
Crouch End does not officially have a park. The two main parks in the area are Stationers&#x27; Park (in Hornsey Vale) and Priory Park (in Hornsey).
To the immediate west, lies Highgate Wood, and the adjacent Queen&#x27;s Wood, as well as a large expanse of playing fields. To the north is Alexandra Park and to the south Finsbury Park. The Parkland Walk, a former railway line, makes a circuitous connection part of the way between these two parks and is in both Haringey and Islington.

==Local Civic Society==
=== Crouch End Neighbourhood Forum ===
The Neighbourhood Forum, set up in response to the government initiatives under the heading &quot;localism&quot;. The forum is formally recognised by the London Borough of Haringey as representative of Crouch End. One of the first tasks of the forum was to attempt to define the boundaries of Crouch End. The forum&#x27;s main task is to produce a neighbourhood plan.

===Hornsey Historical Society===
Founded in 1971, the HHS has over 400 members and is based in the old school house on the boundary between Hornsey and Crouch End by Holy Innocents. The HHS was originally formed to draw attention to and conserve historic buildings in Hornsey, and expanded to research, preserve and promote the history of the parish of Hornsey, and from 1983 included the area covered by the parliamentary constituency of Hornsey and Wood Green. They have over 21,000 items including articles, books, documents &amp; manuscripts, local newspapers, maps, photographs, postcards and video memories. They also sell books on the local history and organise talks.

==Local arts scene==
Crouch End has a long association with creativity, and most famous for the Hornsey College of Art which was regarded as one of the best art colleges in the UK in the 60s but also famous for the 1968 sit-in that challenged the government&#x27;s policy on removing art schools&#x27; independence.
Since the 1970s, when it was a cheap area to love, artists, musicians, film and TV makers, animators and performers moved to the area. A 2016 article in the Evening Standard stated that estate agents liked to call the area &quot;London&#x27;s Creative Village&quot;, and that &quot;ever since the heady days of student protests at nearby Hornsey College of Art in 1968, Crouch End has had an arty reputation&quot;.

===Cinema===
Crouch End has two cinemas, the independent Art House and the Crouch End Picturehouse. There will be a third cinema in the Hornsey Town Hall when it is finished.

===Comedy===
Crouch End is home to the Kings Head, London&#x27;s oldest comedy venue.

===Music===
Crouch End is the home of the symphonic choir, Crouch End Festival Chorus. The choir has worked with many classical and popular music artists including Ennio Morricone, Noel Gallagher, Andrea Bocelli, Katherine Jenkins. It has recorded with Lesley Garrett, Bryn Terfel, Ray Davies, Alfie Boe, EMI Classics and Classic FM, performed at The Proms in the Royal Albert Hall on several occasions and recorded works for film, television and sound track recording. Amongst those is the soundtrack for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. It also commissions works from modern composers on its own account.

It also has a thriving blues scene and a strong associations with famous bands, including the Kinks, Dave Stewart &amp; Annie Lennox (Tourists/Eurythmics), Bombay Bicycle Club and Pink Floyd who lived in the area in the &#x27;60s and played at the Hornsey College of Art.

It has two notable recording studios, the Church Studios (see below) and KONK (founded by the Kinks) where many bands have recorded including the Bay City Rollers, Thin Lizzy, the Bee Gees, Bombay Bicycle Club, and The Arctic Monkeys.

===The Church Studios and Bob Dylan===
The Church Studios is a recording studio located in the former Park Chapel in Crouch End. The Chapel was turned into a studio in 1984 by Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox of Eurythmics, who used it to record Eurythmics&#x27; sophomore album Sweet Dreams. David Gray acquired ownership in 2004 before UK leading music producer Paul Epworth bought and refurbished the studio in 2013. It has since been used by notable artists such as Adele, U2, Bob Dylan, Radiohead, Annie Lennox, Depeche Mode, Robert Plant, Patti Smith, Elvis Costello, Lana Del Rey, Tom Jones, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Florence + The Machine, Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds, Mumford and Sons, Seal, Spiritualized, The Stones Roses and many more.

In the early 1980s part of the old church on Crouch Hill was converted for use as a studio by Bob Bura and John Hardwick, the animators who worked on Camberwick Green, Captain Pugwash and Trumpton. It was named The Church Studios, and in the 1990s the space was rented to Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox of the Eurythmics (but at the time was in the Tourists). Dave and Annie worked and rehearsed in the Spanish Moon record shop, and lived in the flat above from 76 to 80, opposite what is now the Co-op.

In the 1990s Bob Dylan worked on an album in the studio, and became so fond of the area he looked for a property in Crouch End. He was a regular at the now-closed Shamrat Indian restaurant.

===Crouch End Festival===
The Crouch End Festival was launched in May 2012 by Chris Arnold, Robin Stevenson and Marice Cumber. It originally started as a Facebook site, Crouch End Creatives but is now run by London Community Arts CIC, a not for profit organisation that is staffed by volunteers (Directors Chris Arnold, Chris Currer, Amanda Carrara). 
It covers Crouch End, Hornsey and Stroud Green and includes art exhibitions, drama, dance, film, poetry, photography, fringe, music of all kinds, an outdoor cinema, (introduced by Peter Bradshaw). The festival is one of London&#x27;s biggest community arts festivals and features over 200 artists, plus 14 schools, 6 churches and numerous community groups across over 60 venues and was not described in the &quot;Ham &amp; High Broadway&quot; as &quot;London&#x27;s own mini Edinburgh Festival&quot;. The next festival is June 2025. 

The Festival team also runs the Crouch End Literary Festival (with Dave Cohen) and numerous events at Halloween, Easter and Christmas. They also manage two venues, &#x27;The Intmate Space&#x27; in St Mary&#x27;s Tower, and the Holy Eye in Holy Innocents church and organise üF-Beat Fringe Music Club and the Tower Music Festival.
London Community Arts also acts as a consultancy and advises community groups, other festival organisers, commercial organisations and councils.

===Arts scene urban legends===
* According to legend, in the 1990s Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics invited Bob Dylan to drop into his Crouch Hill recording studio any time he wanted to. It is said that Dylan took him up on his offer, but the taxi driver dropped him off on the adjacent Crouch End Hill. Dylan knocked on the door of the supposed home of Dave Stewart and asked for &quot;Dave&quot;. By coincidence, the plumber who lived there was also called Dave. He was told that Dave was out, and would he like to wait and have some tea? Twenty minutes later the plumber returned and asked his wife whether there were any messages. &quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;but Bob Dylan&#x27;s in the living room having a cup of coffee&quot;.
* The area gives its name to and is the setting for a short story of the supernatural by Stephen King. The writer and his wife, Tabitha, were invited to dinner by his friend Peter Straub, whose house is in Crouch End. En route to Straub&#x27;s house, they got lost, which was the inspiration for &quot;Crouch End&quot;. The story was later adapted as an episode of &quot;Nightmares and Dreamscapes: From the Stories of Stephen King&quot;.
* In claim seen only on local estate agents&#x27; websites, it is said that Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy once performed at the Crouch End Hippodrome and that they stayed at the Queen&#x27;s Hotel (now the Queen&#x27;s Pub).
* Artist Richard Hamilton is said to have taken visitor Marcel Duchamp to the Queen&#x27;s Pub.

<text>Donald Lawrence Keene (June 18, 1922 – February 24, 2019) was an American-born Japanese scholar, historian, teacher, writer and translator of Japanese literature. Keene was University Professor emeritus and Shincho Professor Emeritus of Japanese Literature at Columbia University, where he taught for over fifty years. Soon after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, he retired from Columbia, moved to Japan permanently, and acquired citizenship under the name &quot;Kīn Donarudo&quot; (キーン ドナルド) which is essentially his birth name in the Japanese name order. This was also his poetic and occasional nickname, spelled in the &quot;ateji&quot; form .

==Early life and education==
Donald Lawrence Keene was born on June 18, 1922 in Flatbush, Brooklyn. His father was an international trade businessman while his stay-at-home mother raised both Keene and his elder sister. When Keene was seven years old, the Great Depression was beginning to gain momentum in the United States, which subsequently had a negative effect on his family. In July 1931, amid the economic crisis, a 9-year-old Keene begged his father to allow him to accompany him on a business trip to Europe, to which his father agreed. He and his father boarded a United States Lines ship sailing to Normandy in France disembarking at Cherbourg. By train he and his father went to Paris. In Paris, Keene met a girl around the same age, but had a hard time talking to her due to a language barrier, but proceeded to sing to her &quot;Frère Jacques&quot; which was the only song he knew in French. These experiences instilled in him great sense of curiosity for cultures abroad, as well as learning languages. 

In 1933, two years after his visit to France, Keene&#x27;s elder sister died of illness which was followed by his parents divorce. Keene attended the James Madison High School, while living with his mother, where he showed great academic achievement. He than enrolled at Columbia University, where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree 1942, studying under Mark Van Doren, Moses Hadas, Lionel Trilling, and Jacques Barzun. While at Columbia he was obsessed with Arthur Waley&#x27;s English translation of &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; and became increasingly interested in Japanese culture after he met Ryusaku Tsunoda, an individual who Keene cites as a mentor and key influence in his writings. Following his graduation, Keene was enlisted in the United States Navy under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, a pacifist at heart, Keene was not enthusatic about joining, especially after hearing about the Japanese-led Attack on Pearl Harbor. 

While in the Navy, Keene applied to and was accepted into the in Boulder, Colorado and in Berkeley, California, where he learned Japanese, and served as an intelligence officer and in the Pacific region during World War II. Upon his discharge from the Navy, he returned to Columbia where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in 1947. Keene studied for a year at Harvard University before transferring to Cambridge University as a Henry Fellow, where he earned a second master&#x27;s and became a Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge from 1948 to 1954, and a University Lecturer from 1949 to 1955. In the interim, in 1953, he also studied at Kyoto University, and earned a PhD from Columbia in 1949. While staying at Cambridge, Keene went to meet Arthur Waley who was best known for his translation work in classical Chinese and Japanese literature. For Keene, Waley&#x27;s translation of Chinese and Japanese literature was inspiring, even arousing in Keene the thought of becoming a second Waley.

==Career==
Keene was a Japanologist who published about 25 books in English on Japanese topics, including both studies of Japanese literature and culture and translations of Japanese classical and modern literature, including a four-volume history of Japanese literature which has become a standard work. Keene also published about 30 books in Japanese, some of which have been translated from English. He was president of the Donald Keene Foundation for Japanese Culture.

Keene was awarded the Order of Culture by the Japanese government in 2008, one of the highest honors bestowed by the Japanese Imperial Family in the country, becoming the first non-Japanese to receive the award. Soon after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Keene retired from Columbia and moved to Japan with the intention of living out the remainder of his life there. He acquired Japanese citizenship, adopting the legal name . This required him to relinquish his American citizenship, as Japan does not permit dual citizenship.

Keene was well known and respected in Japan and his relocation there following the earthquake was widely lauded.

==Personal life==
In 2013 Keene adopted shamisen player Seiki Uehara as a son. Keene was not married.

Keene died of cardiac arrest in Tokyo on February 24, 2019, aged 96.

<doc id="469860" wikidata="Q1186742" url="?curid=469860" title="Maeda Toshinaga">
<text>was a Sengoku period Japanese samurai and the second early-Edo period &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kaga Domain in the Hokuriku region of Japan, and the 3rd hereditary chieftain of the Maeda clan. He was the eldest son of Maeda Toshiie. His childhood name was &quot;Inuchiyo&quot; (犬千代).

== Biography ==

Toshinaga was born in what is now part of the city of Nagoya in Owari Province, where his father was in the service of Oda Nobunaga In 1581, he married one of Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s daughters, Ei-hime, who was only six years old at the time. Nobunaga was assassinated the following year at the Honnō-ji Incident. 

In 1583, he assisted his father at the Battle of Shizugatake and after the death of Shibata Katsuie, he swore fealty to Toyotomi Hideyoshi and was awarded a 40,000 &quot;koku&quot; fief in Kaga Province. 

In 1585, he played a key role in Hideyoshi&#x27;s campaign against Sassa Narimasa, and his holdings were greatly expanded to 320,000 &quot;koku&quot; across Kaga and Etchū Provinces. He led some 3,000 men in Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s during the Kyūshū Campaign (1587) and the Siege of Odawara (1590). 

In 1598, he received the 267,000 &quot;koku&quot; Kanazawa holdings of his father, Maeda Toshiie. 
Toshiie died the following year 1599, and Hosokawa Tadaoki convinced Toshinaga to support Tokugawa Ieyasu over Ishida Mitsunari and Toyotomi Hideyori. 

In 1600, at the time of the Battle of Sekigahara, his role was primarily to contain the forces of Uesugi Kagekatsu and Niwa Nagashige, they clash at Battle of Asainawate, and at the same time, to keep the forces of his younger brother, Maeda Toshimasa, ruler of Noto Province, from joining the western army. 

On the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, Toshinaga was confirmed in his holdings, which had also been expanded by the addition of 225,000 &quot;koku&quot; formerly held by his brother Toshimasa, and 120,000 &quot;koku&quot; from Komatsu Castle and 63,000 &quot;koku&quot; from Daisho-ji Castle to a total of 1,025,000 &quot;koku&quot;, which covered the provinces of Kaga, Noto and Etchū. The &quot;kokudaka&quot; of Kaga Domain was exceeded only by the Shogunal house itself. Toshinaga built and resided in Kanazawa Castle.

With the establishment of the &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; system of alternative attendance in Edo, Toshinaga was the first &quot;daimyō&quot; to establish a residence in the new capital.

Toshinaga had no son and adopted his younger brother Maeda Toshitsune as his heir. He retired in 1605, and relocated from Kanazawa to Toyama Castle, setting aside 220,000 &quot;koku&quot; for his retirement expenses.

==Death==
When Toyama Castle burned down in 1609, he moved to Uozu, and later to Takaoka. During this period, he increasingly withdrew from public life due to complications from syphilis, and committed suicide by poison at Takaoka Castle in 1614. His mortuary temple is the temple of Zuiryū-ji in Takaoka.

<doc id="469872" wikidata="Q24074790" url="?curid=469872" title="Earl of Liverpool">
<text>Earl of Liverpool is a title that has been created twice in British history. The first time was in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1796 for Charles Jenkinson, 1st Baron Hawkesbury, a favourite of King George III (see Jenkinson baronets for earlier history of the family). He had already been made Baron Hawkesbury, of Hawkesbury in the County of Gloucester, in 1786, and had succeeded as seventh Baronet of Walcot and Hawkesbury in 1790. His eldest son, the second Earl, served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1812 to 1827. The peerages became extinct in 1851 on the death of the latter&#x27;s half-brother, the third Earl, while the baronetcy was inherited by a cousin (see Jenkinson baronets).

The earldom was revived in 1905 in favour of the Liberal politician Cecil Foljambe, 1st Baron Hawkesbury, son of George Foljambe and his second wife Lady Selina Charlotte Jenkinson, daughter of the third Earl of the first creation. He was made Viscount Hawkesbury, of Kirkham in the County of York and of Mansfield in the County of Nottingham, at the same time, and had already been created Baron Hawkesbury, of Haselbech in the County of Northampton and of Ollerton, Sherwood Forest, in the County of Nottingham, in 1893. His eldest son, the second Earl, served as Governor-General of New Zealand between 1912 and 1920. , the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s great-nephew, the fifth Earl, who succeeded his great-uncle, the fifth son of the first Earl, in 1969. He is the posthumous son of Captain Peter George William Savile Foljambe (1919–1944), who was killed in action in the Second World War, son of the Hon. Bertram Marmaduke Osbert Savile Foljambe (1891–1955), sixth son of the first Earl. Lord Liverpool is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits on the Conservative benches.

==Family estate and North Yorkshire roles==
The 4th Earl was Inspector of Driffield Division of the police&#x27;s East Riding Special Constabulary, 1926–1945. He was returned by the people to Norton Rural District in Yorkshire from 1927 to 1947. He had his main home published as Inverey, 11 West Park Road, Cupar, Fife, Scotland.

<text>Sidney Gottlieb (August 3, 1918March 7, 1999) was an American chemist and spymaster who headed the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s 1950s and 1960s assassination attempts and mind-control program, known as Project MKUltra.

==Early years and education==
Gottlieb was born to Hungarian Jewish immigrant parents Fanny and Louis Gottlieb in the Bronx on August 3, 1918. His older brother was plant biologist David Gottlieb. A stutterer since childhood, he earned a master&#x27;s degree in speech therapy from San Jose State University after retiring from the CIA. He was born with a club foot, which got him rejected from military service in World War II but did not prevent his pursuit of folk dancing, a lifelong passion.

Gottlieb graduated from James Monroe High School in 1936, and enrolled in the free City College in NYC. He decided to transfer to a school that offered an agricultural biology course, and wished to attend the University of Wisconsin. In order to take the specialized courses he wished to have, he first attended Arkansas Tech University, where he studied botany, organic chemistry, and principles of dairying. His success at ATU won him admission to the University of Wisconsin, where he was mentored by Ira Baldwin, the assistant dean of the College of Agriculture. Gottlieb graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1940. His accomplishments at the university, paired with a glowing recommendation from Baldwin, won him admission to the California Institute of Technology, where he received his Doctorate in Biochemistry in June 1943, writing his thesis on &quot;Studies of Ascorbic Acid in Cowpeas.&quot;

Gottlieb met his wife Margaret Moore, daughter of a Presbyterian missionary, while attending CIT, and then they married. Denied the chance of military service, he sought out another way to serve, and began looking for government work in Washington. By 1948, his wife and two daughters were living in a cabin near Vienna, Virginia, that had no electricity or running water. He was living there when he began working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). His lifestyle was in contrast to that of the Ivy League men the CIA normally recruited.

== Government career ==
Gottlieb&#x27;s first government position was at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he researched the chemical structure of organic soils. He later transferred to the Food and Drug Administration, where he developed tests to measure the presence of drugs in the human body. Gottlieb grew bored with this work and sought a more challenging position. In 1948, he found a job at the National Research Council, where he described being &quot;exposed to some interesting work concerning ergot alkaloids as vasoconstrictors and hallucinogens.&quot; He soon relocated to the University of Maryland as a research associate dedicated to studying metabolisms of fungi.

On July 13, 1951, Gottlieb reported for his first day of work for the CIA. Then-Deputy Director for Operations Allen Dulles hired him on Ira Baldwin&#x27;s recommendation. Baldwin had founded and run the biowarfare program at Fort Detrick years earlier, and had kept Gottlieb in his orbit. Gottlieb had advanced knowledge about poisons. In the 1950s, Communist infiltration concerned many Americans. These Cold War-era fears also contributed to the CIA expanding its experimental methods over the next two decades, worrying that the USSR and The People&#x27;s Republic of China had already mastered brainwashing and were using it against their own citizens and prisoners.

Project BLUEBIRD was already underway when Gottlieb was brought on board; BLUEBIRD experimented with &quot;Special Interrogation&quot; techniques on captured prisoners at black sites like Camp King and Villa Schuster, using drugs to attempt to break ego control and elicit information. BLUEBIRD lacked scientific knowledge and discipline; Dulles wanted Gottlieb to get it back on course. After proceeding through training, he was named chief of the newly formed Chemical Division of the Technical Services Staff (TSS). On August 20, 1951, Dulles ordered BLUEBIRD to be expanded and centralized, and renamed the Project Artichoke, which became a power base for Gottlieb. Dulles was promoted to Deputy Director of Central Intelligence shortly after expanding Artichoke&#x27;s scale.

Dulles and Gottlieb both believed there was a way to influence and control the human mind that could lead to global mastery. They also wanted a &quot;truth serum&quot;, something that had been investigated during the days of the OSS but never fully realized. Gottlieb conducted experiments using THC, cocaine, heroin, and mescaline before realizing LSD had not been properly tested or investigated by the agency. After trying LSD for the first time himself, Gottlieb accelerated LSD experiments at the agency, testing it on agents who agreed to be dosed under controlled environments and some who agreed to be dosed by surprise. LSD had been synthesized only 13 years earlier. After months of experimenting on agents, Gottlieb sought help from the Special Operations Division at Detrick.
Gottlieb&#x27;s first 18 months at the agency led to some frustrating discoveries. The drugs he was experimenting with were not the &quot;truth serums&quot; he had hoped, and often hindered interrogations rather than aiding them. He knew Dulles, now the Director of Central Intelligence under President Eisenhower, would approve his proposals. Gottlieb and Richard Helms, then-Chief of Operations for Directorate of Plans, wrote a memorandum to send to Dulles. Dulles formally approved Project MKUltra on April 13, 1953. His brother, John Foster Dulles, was appointed Secretary of State, giving further diplomatic cover to the project. On April 10, Dulles described the program and others like it in a speech to alumni of Princeton University, referencing the new battlefield of &quot;brain warfare&quot; as the battle for controlling the human mind. He described the program as something the Soviet Union was doing rather than something the CIA was pioneering. 

Gottlieb selected multiple researchers, scientists, and ex-OSS members to work for him under MK-ULTRA &quot;subprojects.&quot; Those contracted conducted experiments on Gottlieb&#x27;s behalf and reported their findings to him. He sponsored physicians such as Donald Ewen Cameron and Harris Isbell in controversial psychiatric research, including non-consensual human experiments.

Gottlieb administered LSD and other hallucinogenic drugs to unwitting subjects and financed psychiatric research and development of &quot;techniques that would crush the human psyche to the point that it would admit anything&quot;. He was named as the person who gave Army bacteriologist Frank Olson LSD at an MK-ULTRA retreat, leading to Olson&#x27;s mental spiral and death a week later.

Gottlieb was the liaison to the military subcontractor Lockheed, then working for the CIA on Project AQUATONE, later known as the U-2 spy plane. In 1953, he arranged a safe house for the Lockheed Aeronautics Services Division (LASD) with an easy and exclusive egress.

By 1955 Project MK-ULTRA had outgrown its government funding. At this point Subproject 27 (basic research of LSD) was a funding subproject that combined previous subprojects, including payment to Sandoz Pharmaceuticals for LSD, John Mulholland&#x27;s &quot;The Official CIA Manual of Trickery and Deception&quot; (subproject 15 magic support, Mulholland Supplement), and further procurement of LSD (subproject 18), but it grew to almost 150 documented subprojects, including a microwave gun and the search for alternatives to LSD, which led to later programs like Project MKCHICKWIT, most of which focused on South America.

In addition to working with subcontractors, the CIA worked with the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the Department of Defense and the Office of Naval Intelligence, though it is unclear what role Gottlieb played in these affairs other than authorization.

In March 1960, under The Cuban Project, a CIA plan approved by President Eisenhower—and under the direction of CIA Directorate for Plans Richard M. Bissell—Gottlieb proposed spraying Fidel Castro&#x27;s television studio with LSD and saturating Castro&#x27;s shoes with thallium to make his beard fall out. Gottlieb also hatched schemes to assassinate Castro, including the use of a poisoned cigar, a poisoned wetsuit, an exploding conch shell, and a poisonous fountain pen. Gottlieb also played a role in the CIA&#x27;s attempt to assassinate Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba of the Congo. He took a vial of poison to the Congo with plans to place it on Lumumba&#x27;s toothbrush in the summer of 1960. He provided these &quot;toxic biological materials&quot; to Larry Devlin, the CIA station chief in the Congo, and although Devlin declined the assignment, a military coup soon overthrew and killed Lumumba.

==Retirement and death==
Gottlieb retired from the CIA in 1973, saying he did not believe his work had been effective. Visited in retirement by the son of his late colleague Frank Olson, he was residing in Culpeper, Virginia, where he raised goats, ate yogurt, and advocated for peace and environmentalism. He and his wife, Margaret, spent two years traveling in Australia, Africa, and India before settling down for several months to run a leper hospital in India. He had two sons and two daughters. 

Gottlieb and his wife moved back to Santa Cruz, California, to be more involved in their young grandchildren&#x27;s lives. While there, Gottlieb got a master&#x27;s degree in speech pathology. After five years in California, the couple moved back to Virginia for their retirement years. Both volunteered, with Gottlieb using his new degree to help in middle schools, high schools, and occasionally hospice care facilities as a speech pathologist. The couple also enjoyed farming their own food in their free time.

On March 7, 1999, Gottlieb died at his home in Washington, Virginia. He was reported to have a history of heart problems, but his wife declined to give the cause of death.

<text>John Hadley Thompson, AM (né Pain; born 31 August 1940) is an Australian actor and a major figure of Australian cinema, particularly Australian New Wave. He is best known for his role as a lead actor in several acclaimed Australian films, including such classics as &quot;The Club&quot; (1980), &quot;Sunday Too Far Away&quot; (1975), &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot; (1982) and &quot;Petersen&quot; (1974). He won Cannes and AFI acting awards for the latter film. 

In 2002, he was made an honorary member of the Australian Cinematographers Society, and was the recipient of a Living Legend Award at the 2005 Inside Film Awards.

== Early life ==
Born John Hadley Pain in Manly, a suburb of Sydney, Thompson was five years old when his mother Marjorie died, leaving his father Harold (a purser for Qantas seconded to the RAAF during the war) unable to care for him and his brother, David. He was sent to &quot;LakeHouse orphanage&quot; in Narrabeen by his aunt and subsequently adopted by the poet and ABC broadcaster John Thompson and his wife Pat, after which he changed his surname. Jack is film reviewer Peter Thompson&#x27;s adopted brother.

Thompson was educated at Sydney Boys High School. He left school at 14, became a jackaroo in the Northern Territory, and took labouring jobs in New South Wales.

After working in an agricultural lab, Thompson at the age of 20, joined the army in 1960 so that he could earn a science degree.

==Career==
===Theatre===
He enrolled at the University of Queensland in 1963 and transferred to an arts degree, performing in theatre at night, including the Twelfth Night Theatre and UQ Dramatic Society in Brisbane.

His talent was nurtured and developed at the Producers Authors Composers and Talent (PACT) Centre.

He appeared on stage in &quot;The Devils&quot; in 1968.

===Television roles===
Thompson decided to take acting seriously, giving himself a year to make it.

His TV career began with the soap opera &quot;Motel&quot; (1968), and he had guest appearances on numerous serials, including &quot;Riptide&quot;, &quot;Woobinda, Animal Doctor&quot;, &quot;Skippy&quot;, &quot;The Rovers&quot;, &quot;Division 4&quot;, &quot;Homicide&quot; and &quot;Matlock Police&quot;. He also appeared in the documentary short &quot;Personnel, or People?&quot; (1969), directed by Donald Crombie.

Thompson had a leading role in spy drama series &quot;Spyforce&quot; (1971–1973), playing the role of Erskine who did missions in World War II.

He continued to guest-star on shows such as &quot;Over There&quot;, &quot;Matlock Police&quot; (again), &quot;Ryan&quot;, &quot;Boney&quot; and &quot;Elephant Boy&quot;.

He guest-starred on &quot;The Evil Touch&quot; and &quot;Homicide&quot; again; he also appeared in &quot;Marijuana: Possession and the Law&quot; (1974).

===Films and stardom===
Thompson made his film debut in &quot;That Lady from Peking&quot; in 1968, and his first lead role was in TV movie &quot;Silo 15&quot; (filmed in 1969 and released in 1971).

He had a supporting role in &quot;Wake in Fright&quot; in 1971, and he received excellent reviews for his performance in one of the stories in &quot;Libido&quot; in 1973, with his segment written by David Williamson. He also starred in TV movie &quot;Linehau&quot; in 1973.

Thompson became an Australian film star playing the title role in &quot;Petersen&quot; (1974), written by Williamson and directed by Tim Burstall. The film was a success at the box office. He did the TV movie &quot;Human Target&quot; (1974), then starred in the highly acclaimed &quot;Sunday Too Far Away&quot; (1975), playing a shearer.

Thompson played the title role in &quot;Scobie Malone&quot; (1975), based on the Jon Cleary novel &quot;Helga&#x27;s Web&quot;. It was produced by American Casey Robinson, who said &quot;Jack Thompson is a great part of my reason to become involved in this venture. I have no doubt whatsoever that when this film is seen overseas he&#x27;ll be turned instantly into an international star. There aren&#x27;t many male actors like him around any more. There&#x27;s something there that reminds me very much of Bogart.&quot; The film was a failure at the box office.

He did an episode of &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;, titled &quot;Tully&quot;.

Thompson had a supporting role in &quot;Caddie&quot; (1976), directed by Crombie, which was a big success.

Thompson had become nationally famous playing &quot;macho&quot; type roles. &quot;I think it reflects its time so accurately,&quot; he said later. &quot;There was a preoccupation with the macho Australian male; it&#x27;s a thing that had to be examined or purged in film.&quot;

===Character actor===
Thompson then deliberately decided to take character parts, out of a fear of typecasting and &quot;also an understanding that unless I could get out of that target area, then I wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to be seen as an actor.&quot;

He guest starred in an episode of &quot;Luke&#x27;s Kingdom&quot; and played the second lead in &quot;Mad Dog Morgan&quot; (1976) with Dennis Hopper. He took some time off to work on a script with his brother then had a key support role in &quot;The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith&quot; (1978). He supported imported stars Karen Black and Keir Dullea in a TV movie shot in Australia, &quot;Because He&#x27;s My Friend&quot; (1978).

Thompson returned to acting after another break to play the lead role in a sex comedy, &quot;The Journalist&quot; (1979). &quot;I haven&#x27;t made any films since then because I haven&#x27;t liked the parts I&#x27;ve been offered, and also I&#x27;ve been too busy promoting the Australian film industry overseas&quot;, said Thompson at the time. The film became a notorious flop. He worked on a script with his brother called &quot;Welcome Stranger&quot;.

He was offered a role in &quot;Breaker Morant&quot; (1980), directed by Bruce Beresford - the part of Private Hancock. Thompson turned it down, Beresford rewrote the script and offered him the part again, and Thompson accepted. Then filming was delayed. John Hargreaves who was to play the lawyer became unavailable; Thompson took that part and Bryan Brown played Hancock. The film was a considerable success. Thompson won Best Supporting Actor at Cannes.

Thompson supported US stars William Holden and Rick Schroeder in &quot;The Earthling&quot; (1980) then was top billed in &quot;The Club&quot; (1980), directed by Beresford from a play by Williamson.

&quot;You get awfully fed up with the public image that you must live up to,&quot; he said in an interview around this time. &quot;I just want to continue becoming a part of the Australian film industry, not for materialistic reasons but because I enjoy it. I not only want to act, but produce and possibly direct&quot;.

Thompson went to New Zealand to make &quot;Bad Blood&quot; (1982) playing killer Stanley Graham, then had a support role in &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot; (1982), playing Clancy of the Overflow.

===International career===
Thompson went overseas to support Ingrid Bergman in &quot;A Woman Called Golda&quot; (1982). He was Lee Remick&#x27;s husband in a remake of &quot;The Letter&quot; (1982), and played a British POW in &quot;Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence&quot; (1983) with David Bowie and Tom Conti.

Back in Australia Thompson starred in a mini series about wharfies in the Depression, &quot;Waterfront&quot; (1983). He went to Europe to star in a swashbuckler for Paul Verhoeven, &quot;Flesh + Blood&quot; (1985), then returned to Australia to star in &quot;Burke and Wills&quot; (1985). This film was a box office disappointment.

Thompson supported Linda Evans and Jason Robards in a TV mini series, &quot;The Last Frontier&quot; (1986), which was a huge ratings success. In the US he had a role in &quot;&quot; (1987) then returned home to play an ASIO officer in &quot;Ground Zero&quot; (1987).

Thompson was a love interest for Stefanie Powers in &quot;Beryl Markham: A Shadow on the Sun&quot; (1988) on US TV, and had the lead in an Australian TV movie, &quot;The Riddle of the Stinson&quot; (1989), playing Bernard O&#x27;Reilly.

He co-starred with Raquel Welch in &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; (1989) for US TV, then did a mini series in New Zealand, &quot;The Rainbow Warrior Conspiracy&quot; (1989).

He did a US TV movie &quot;After the Shock&quot; (1990) and had a support part in &quot;Turtle Beach&quot; (1992) and &quot;Wind&quot; (1992).

He had a supporting part as Cliegg Lars in George Lucas&#x27;s Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002).

===Character actor===
Thompson began to increasingly work as a character actor in the US with roles in &quot;Ruby Cairo&quot; (1993), directed by Graeme Clifford, and &quot;A Far Off Place&quot; (1994).

He returned to Australia to play Russell Crowe&#x27;s father in &quot;The Sum of Us&quot; (1994), then did &quot;A Woman of Independent Means&quot; (1995) in the US and &quot;Flight of the Albatross&quot; (1995) in New Zealand.

He had a support role in &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; (1996), did &quot;The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years&quot; (1996) back home and &quot;Last Dance&quot; (1996) for Beresford in the US.

Thompson starred in the Australian TV movie &quot;McLeod&#x27;s Daughters&quot; (1996). He was Alicia Silverstone&#x27;s father in &quot;Excess Baggage&quot; (1997), then did &quot;Under the Lighthouse Dancing&quot; (1997) in Australia. He appeared in the Clint Eastwood-directed &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot; (1997) as Sonny Seiler, the attorney of Kevin Spacey&#x27;s character, Jim Williams. (Seiler himself appeared in the movie as the judge in Williams&#x27; trial.) &quot;I was amazed at how he adapted to Geechee to fit the role of playing me,&quot; Seiler said. &quot;It was a pleasure working with him.&quot;

Back in Australia Thompson provided a voice for &quot;The Magic Pudding&quot; (2000) and appeared in &quot;Yolngu Boy&quot; (2001). He had a support part in the new version of &quot;South Pacific&quot; (2001), the mini series based on &quot;My Brother Jack&quot; (2001), &quot;Original Sin&quot; (2001), &quot;Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002), &quot;The Assassination of Richard Nixon&quot; (2004), and &quot;Oyster Farmer&quot; (2005).

Thompson had a key role in two films directed by Brett Leonard: the Marvel Comics based &quot;Man-Thing&quot; (2005) and &quot;Feed&quot; (2006), the latter written by and starring his son.

Thompson had support roles in &quot;The Good German&quot; (2006), &quot;Bastard Boys&quot; (2007), &quot;December Boys&quot; (2007), &quot;Leatherheads&quot; (2008), &quot;Ten Empty&quot; (2008), &quot;Australia&quot; (2008), &quot;Mao&#x27;s Last Dancer&quot; (2009) for Beresford, &quot;The Karenskys&quot; (2009), &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid of the Dark&quot; (2010), &quot;Rake&quot; (2010), &quot;Blinder&quot; (2013), &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (2013), &quot;Mystery Road&quot; (2013), &quot;Around the Block&quot; (2013), &quot;Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot; (2013) for Beresford, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Playground&quot; (2014), &quot;Ruben Guthrie&quot; (2015), &quot;The Light Between Oceans&quot; (2016), &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; (2017), &quot;Blue World Order&quot; (2017) and &quot;Swinging Safari&quot; (2018).

He has also acted in television miniseries and appeared as the host of the Channel 7 factual series &quot;Find My Family&quot;.

===Other appearances===
Thompson was the first nude male centrefold in &quot;Cleo&quot; in 1972. He has also appeared in television commercials, including as the face of the Bank of Melbourne for a decade, and for Claytons. Thompson is featured in a series of recordings of Australian poetry, reciting poems by Henry Lawson, Banjo Paterson, C. J. Dennis, Patrick Joseph Hartigan (aka John O&#x27;Brien) and John O&#x27;Grady (see &quot;Discography&quot; below). Interviewed in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; he explains his love of poetry, noting that &#x27;Poetry is sometimes seen as too arty and perhaps not a suitable interest for blokes.&#x27;

==Personal life==
Thompson married Beverley Hackett in 1963, and the five-year marriage produced his son Patrick Thompson. He met Leona King and her sister Bunkie in 1969, and they entered into a 15-year polyamorous relationship. Leona was 20 and Bunkie was 15 when the relationship began. Bunkie left the relationship in 1985, and is estranged from her sister. Leona remained with Thompson, and gave birth to his second son, Billy.

Thompson featured in the first episode of the Australian version of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, which was televised on 13 January 2008 on SBS, with Thompson discovering that his great-grandfather was Captain Thomas Pain, and his great-great uncle was Alfred Lee, a prominent figure in Sydney society, who donated the journal of Joseph Banks, from Captain Cook&#x27;s navigation to Australia in the 1770s, to the Mitchell Library in Sydney.

Thompson used to own Hotel Gearin in Katoomba, Blue Mountains. He sold the hotel in June 2011.

<text>Earl St Aldwyn, of Coln St Aldwyn in the County of Gloucester, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1915 for the prominent Conservative politician Michael Hicks Beach, 1st Viscount St Aldwyn, known from 1854 to 1907 as Sir Michael Hicks Beach, 9th Baronet, of Beverston. He was Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1885 to 1886 and again from 1895 to 1902. Hicks Beach had already been created Viscount St Aldwyn, of Coln St Aldwyn in the County of Gloucester, in 1906, and was made Viscount Quenington, of Quenington in the County of Gloucester, at the same time he was given the earldom. Both titles are in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his grandson, the second Earl, the son of Michael Hicks Beach, Viscount Quenington, Member of Parliament for Tewkesbury, who was killed in action in 1916. Lord St Aldwyn was also a Conservative politician and was Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms (government chief whip in the House of Lords) between 1958 and 1964 and 1970 and 1974. the titles are held by his eldest son, the third Earl, who succeeded in 1992.

The Hicks, later Hicks Beach family, descends from Robert Hicks, a textile merchant in London. His third son Baptist Hicks was created Viscount Campden in 1628 and is the ancestor of the Earls of Gainsborough. Robert Hicks&#x27;s eldest son Sir Michael Hicks was private secretary to William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley. His only son William Hicks was created a baronet, of Beverston in the County of Gloucester, in the Baronetage of England in 1619. He later represented Marlow and Tewkesbury in the House of Commons. The line of his eldest son, the second Baronet, failed in 1768 on the death of the latter&#x27;s grandson, the fourth Baronet. The late Baronet was succeeded by his cousin, the fifth Baronet. He was the son of Charles Hicks.

On his death in 1792 this line of the family also failed and the title passed to his cousin, the sixth Baronet. He was the son of Howe Hicks. He was succeeded by his son, the seventh Baronet. When he died in 1834 the title was inherited by his great-nephew, the eighth Baronet. He was the grandson of Michael Hicks Beach, younger brother of the seventh Baronet, who had assumed the additional surname of Beach when he married Henrietta Maria Beach, only surviving daughter and heiress of William Beach of Netheravon, Wiltshire. Hicks Beach briefly represented Gloucestershire East in Parliament in 1854. He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned ninth Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage as Viscount St Aldwyn in 1906 and created Earl St Aldwyn in 1915.

The family seat was Williamstrip House, near Coln St Aldwyns, Gloucestershire, until its sale in 2007.

<text>Tokugawa Ieharu 徳川 家治 (20 June 1737 – 17 September 1786) was the tenth &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan, who held office from 1760 to 1786.

His childhood name was Takechiyo (竹千代).

Ieharu died in 1786 and given the Buddhist name Shunmyoin and buried at Kan&#x27;ei-ji.

==Family==
* Father: Tokugawa Ieshige
* Mother: Oko no Kata (d. 1728) later Shinshin&#x27;in
* Wife: Iso no Miya Tomoko (1738–1771)
* Concubines:
** Omiyo no Kata
** Ochiho no Kata (1737–1791) later Renkoin
** Oshina no Kata (d. 1778) later Yoren-in
* Child:
** Chiyohime (1756–1757) by Tomoko
** Manjuhime (1761–1773) (born by Tomoko but after she died adopted by Ieharu&#x27;s concubine, Omaki no Kata)
** Tokugawa Takechiyo later Tokugawa Iemoto (1762–1779) born by Ochiho no Kata
** Tokugawa Teijiro (1762–1763) born by Oshina no Kata
* Adopted: 
** Tokugawa Ienari
** Tanehime (1765–1794), daughter of Tokugawa Munetake and married Tokugawa Harutomi of Kishū Domain

==Events of the Ieharu&#x27;s &quot;bakufu&quot;==
* Tenmei gannen (天明元年) or Tenmei 1 (1781): The new era name of &quot;Tenmei&quot; (meaning &quot;Dawn&quot;) was created to mark the enthronement of Emperor Kōkaku. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in &quot;An&#x27;ei&quot; 11, on the 2nd day of the 4th month. According to Nihon Ōdai Ichiran, Ieharu was appointed Udaijin (Minister of the Right) of the Emperor&#x27;s Kugyō, which was quite rare and considered a great favour. 
* Tenmei 2 (1782): Great &quot;Tenmei&quot; Famine begins.
* Tenmei 2 (1782): An analysis of silver currency in China and Japan &quot;Sin sen sen pou (Sin tchuan phou)&quot; was presented to the emperor by Kutsuki Masatsuna (1750–1802), also known as Kutsuki Oki-no kami Minamoto-no Masatsuna, hereditary &quot;daimyō&quot; of Oki and Ōmi with holdings in Tanba and Fukuchiyama -- &quot;related note at Tenmei 7 below&quot;.
* Tenmei 3 (1783): Mount Asama (浅間山, &quot;Asama-yama&quot;) erupted in Shinano, one of the old provinces of Japan (Tenmei eruption). Japanologist Isaac Titsingh&#x27;s published account of the Asama-yama eruption was the first of its kind in the West (1820). The volcano&#x27;s devastation makes the Great Tenmei Famine even worse.
* Tenmei 4 (1784): Country-wide celebrations in honor of Kūkai (also known as Kōbō-Daishi, founder of Shingon Buddhism) who died 950 years earlier.
* Tenmei 4 (1784): The son of the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s chief counselor was assassinated inside Edo Castle. The comparatively young &quot;wakadoshiyori&quot;, , was the son of the senior &quot;wakadoshiyori&quot; Tanuma Tonomo-no-kami Okitsugu. The younger Tanuma was killed in front of his father as both were returning to their litter after a meeting of the Counselors of State had broken up. The involvement of senior figures in the &quot;bakufu&quot; was suspected; however, none but the lone assassin himself, Sano Masakoto, was punished. The result was that Tanuma-initiated, liberalizing reforms within the &quot;bakufu&quot; and relaxation the strictures of &quot;sakoku&quot; were blocked.
* Tenmei 6, on the 8th day of the 9th month (17 September 1786): Death of Tokugawa Ieharu. He is buried in Edo.
* Tenmei 7 (1787): Kutsuki Masatsuna published &quot;Seiyō senpu&quot; (&quot;Notes on Western Coinage&quot;), with plates showing European and colonial currency – &quot;related note at Tenmei 2 above&quot;. – see online image of 2 adjacent pages from library collection of Kyoto University of Foreign Studies and Kyoto Junior College of Foreign Languages

==Eras of Ieharu&#x27;s &quot;bakufu&quot;==
The years in which Ieharu was &quot;shōgun&quot; are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Hōreki&quot; (1751–1764)
* &quot;Meiwa&quot; (1764–1772)
* &quot;An&#x27;ei&quot; (1772–1781)
* &quot;Tenmei&quot; (1781–1789)

<doc id="469887" wikidata="Q77112" url="?curid=469887" title="David Foster">
<text>David Walter Foster (born November 1, 1949) is a Canadian record producer, pianist, film composer, and music executive. He has won 16 Grammy Awards from 47 nominations. Foster&#x27;s career began as a keyboardist for the pop group Skylark in the early 1970s before focusing largely on composing and production. Often in tandem with songwriter Diane Warren, Foster has contributed to material for prominent music industry artists in various genres since then, and is credited with production on over 40 pop hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. He has also chaired Verve Records from 2012 to 2016.

==Early life and career==
Foster was born in Victoria, British Columbia, the son of Maurice &quot;Maury&quot; Foster, an office worker, and Eleanor May Foster (née Vantreight), a homemaker. In 1963, at the age of 13, he enrolled in the University of Washington music program. In 1965, he auditioned to lead the band in an Edmonton nightclub owned by jazz musician Tommy Banks. Banks mentored Foster in jazz, producing records, and the music business. After one year there, he moved to Toronto to play with Ronnie Hawkins. In 1966, he joined a backup band for Chuck Berry. In 1972, he moved to Los Angeles with his band Skylark.

==Career==
===Early years===
Foster was a keyboardist for the pop group Skylark, discovered by Eirik Wangberg. The song &quot;Wildflower&quot; was a top ten hit in 1973. When the group disbanded, Foster remained in Los Angeles and, together with Jay Graydon, he formed the band Airplay. In 1975, Foster played on George Harrison&#x27;s album &quot;Extra Texture&quot;. He followed that up a year later by playing the Fender Rhodes and clavinet on Harrison&#x27;s album &quot;Thirty Three &amp; 1/3&quot;. In 1976, Foster joined Guthrie Thomas on Thomas&#x27; second Capitol Records album, &quot;Lies and Alibis&quot;, with Ringo Starr and a host of other performers. Foster was a major contributor to the 1979 Earth, Wind &amp; Fire album &quot;I Am&quot;, as a studio player and arranger. He was a co-writer on six of the album&#x27;s tracks, such as &quot;After the Love Has Gone&quot;, for which he and his co-writers, Graydon and Bill Champlin, won the 1980 Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song.

===1981–1999===
Foster worked as a producer on albums for The Tubes: 1981&#x27;s &quot;The Completion Backward Principle&quot; and 1983&#x27;s &quot;Outside Inside&quot;. Foster co-wrote such songs as &quot;Talk to Ya Later&quot;, with Tubes singer Fee Waybill and Steve Lukather from Toto; the Top 40 hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Want to Wait Anymore&quot;; and the number 10 US hit &quot;She&#x27;s a Beauty&quot;. On the 1980 Boz Scaggs album &quot;Middle Man&quot;, he co-wrote and he played keyboard on some of Scaggs&#x27;s most successful songs, including &quot;Breakdown Dead Ahead&quot;, &quot;Jojo&quot;, and &quot;Simone&quot;, followed by &quot;Look What You&#x27;ve Done to Me&quot; from the film &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;.

Foster was a major contributor to the career of jazz rock band Chicago in the early and middle 1980s, having worked as the band&#x27;s producer on &quot;Chicago 16&quot; (1982), &quot;Chicago 17&quot; (1984) — their biggest selling, multi-platinum album — and &quot;Chicago 18&quot; (1986). As was typical of his producing projects from this period, Foster was a co-writer on &quot;Hard to Say I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; (US No. 1), &quot;Love Me Tomorrow&quot; (US No. 22), &quot;Stay the Night&quot; (US No. 16), and &quot;You&#x27;re the Inspiration&quot; (US No. 3). These were co-written with the band&#x27;s bassist Peter Cetera. In 1986, Foster also helped Cetera co-write (along with Cetera&#x27;s wife Diane Nini) his US No. 1 solo hit &quot;Glory of Love&quot;.

Foster co-wrote Kenny Loggins&#x27;s songs &quot;Heart to Heart&quot; (US No. 15), from the 1982 album &quot;High Adventure&quot;, and &quot;Forever&quot; (US No. 40), from the 1985 album &quot;Vox Humana&quot;.

Foster worked with country singer Kenny Rogers on the hit albums &quot;What About Me?&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; (1985). The latter features &quot;The Best of Me&quot;, co-written with Richard Marx that was covered by Cliff Richard in 1989, resulting in a number-two UK hit.

In 1985, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named Foster the &quot;master of . . . bombastic pop kitsch&quot;. That year, Foster composed the score for the film &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;, including the instrumental &quot;Love Theme from St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;, which hit No. 15 on the US pop charts. Another song from the film, &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire (Man in Motion)&quot;, recorded by John Parr, reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on September 7, 1985.

In 1985, Foster also co-wrote and produced &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot;, which reached top 15 status. The album was recorded by a group of fellow Canadian artists including Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, and Bryan Adams.

Foster continued turning out occasional film scores, including the Michael J. Fox comedy &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot; (1987), which featured a song co-written by Foster titled &quot;The Price of Love&quot;, a version of which was performed by Roger Daltrey on his album &quot;Can&#x27;t Wait to See the Movie&quot;, which Foster also produced. Foster wrote the score for the Jodie Foster-Mark Harmon film &quot;Stealing Home&quot; (1988). Both films spawned soundtrack albums with Foster&#x27;s prominent contributions.

Foster composed &quot;Winter Games&quot;, the instrumental theme song for the 1988 Winter Olympics and performed &quot;Winter Games&quot; and its vocal version &quot;Can&#x27;t You Feel It?&quot; in Calgary, Alberta. &quot;Winter Games&quot; is the soundtrack for fountain shows at the Bellagio resort in Las Vegas.

Foster collaborated with then-wife Linda Thompson on the song &quot;I Have Nothing&quot;, sung by Whitney Houston in the 1992 film &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;. The couple appeared in the film&#x27;s Oscars scene as the conductor and an Academy member.

In 1995, Foster signed a deal with Warner Brothers for his own boutique label, 143 Records, as a joint venture with Warner. Foster gave responsibility for running the label to then-manager Brian Avnet. One of the label&#x27;s first signings was a then-little known Irish folk-rock band, the Corrs, whose debut album he produced. By 1997, Foster decided that, in the American market at least, &quot;logo labels&quot; like 143 were in a &quot;bad spot&quot;, so he sold the label back to Warner and became a senior vice president at the corporation. Foster and Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds composed &quot;The Power of the Dream&quot;, the official song of the 1996 Summer Olympics. Foster produced the Diane Warren songs &quot;Un-Break My Heart&quot; sung by Toni Braxton, &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; sung by Celine Dion, and &quot;Have You Ever?&quot; sung by Brandy.

===2000s===
Foster produced major-label debut albums for Josh Groban (2001), Michael Bublé (2003), Renee Olstead (2004), and Charice (2010), which were released under his 143 Records.

In 2001, Foster collaborated with Lara Fabian and the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra to record English-language, French-language, and bilingual versions of the Canadian national anthem, &quot;O Canada&quot;, for a promotion of the Canadian government. Foster, with his then-wife Linda Thompson, composed &quot;Light the Fire Within&quot;, sung by LeAnn Rimes for the 2002 Winter Olympics. In 2003, Foster won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Music and Lyrics for &quot;The Concert for World Children&#x27;s Day&quot;. His song, &quot;I Will Be There With You&quot; (sung with Katharine McPhee), has been used by Japan Airlines to promote the introduction of new aircraft for its US flights.

The 2001 film &quot;The Score&quot;, starring Robert De Niro and Marlon Brando, features a Diana Krall recording, &quot;I&#x27;ll Make it Up as I Go&quot;. The song was composed by Foster together with his daughter Amy Foster-Gillies.

In 2005, Foster, his daughter Amy Foster-Gillies, and Beyoncé wrote &quot;Stand Up For Love&quot; as the anthem to the World Children&#x27;s Day, an annual worldwide event to raise awareness and funds for children&#x27;s causes. Over the years, more than $50 million has been raised to benefit Ronald McDonald House Charities and other children&#x27;s organizations.

In 2008, Foster held a one-night concert called Hitman: David Foster &amp; Friends at the Mandalay Bay resort in Las Vegas featuring Foster presiding center stage at the keyboard, Andrea Bocelli, Michael Bublé, Josh Groban, Peter Cetera, Katharine McPhee, Celine Dion, Blake Shelton, Brian McKnight, and Charice.

In 2009, it was revealed by songwriter Diane Warren that she had worked with Foster to produce tracks for Whitney Houston&#x27;s upcoming album and the singer&#x27;s comeback single would be the Foster-produced &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Know My Own Strength&quot;.

===2010s===
On May 30, 2011, Foster teamed with young singer Jackie Evancho in her Dream With Me Concert on PBS at the Ringling Brothers Museum in Sarasota, Florida. On December 15, 2011, it was confirmed that Foster would become the Chairman of Verve Music Group.

In 2013, Foster produced Mary J. Blige&#x27;s first Christmas album &quot;A Mary Christmas&quot; released October 15 of that year. The album includes 12 classics such as swing-styled &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;. It features artists Marc Anthony, Jessie J, The Clark Sisters, Barbra Streisand, and Chris Botti. Foster produced Andrea Bocelli&#x27;s album &quot;Passione&quot;, released in January 2013. The album is a collection of Mediterranean love songs featuring duets with Jennifer Lopez, Nelly Furtado, and a virtual duet with Edith Piaf.

Foster produced an album with Bryan Adams titled &quot;Tracks of My Years&quot; released in 2014.

Foster left Verve in 2016 in a label reorganization.

As of 2018, he was writing a musical with Jewel, based on Amy Bloom&#x27;s novel &quot;Lucky Us&quot;.

===2020s===
Foster composed a musical based on Betty Boop, with lyrics by Susan Birkenhead and a book by Bob Martin. &quot;Boop! The Musical&quot; had its world premiere at the CIBC Theatre in Chicago, on November 19, 2023.

==Television appearances==
In 1992, Foster went to Indonesia to record the TV show &quot;David Foster&#x27;s Twilight Orchestra&quot; on the national television station RCTI. In early 2001, Foster appeared in &quot;Popstars&quot;, a WB reality series aimed at coming up with the next girl group. The result was Eden&#x27;s Crush (featuring Nicole Scherzinger). Foster and Linda Thompson wrote and produced several songs on their album.

In 2005, his and Linda Thompson&#x27;s home life was featured in a &quot;staged&quot; reality television show, &quot;The Princes of Malibu&quot;, on Fox. The premise was Foster attempting to teach his spoiled stepsons, Brandon and Brody Jenner—the children of Thompson and Olympian Caitlyn Jenner—to straighten their lives up and earn their own way.

In late April 2006, he appeared as a guest mentor on &quot;American Idol&quot; and as a guest judge on &quot;Nashville Star&quot;. In 2006, he was a judge on the FOX TV show &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot; and appeared on &quot;Star Tomorrow&quot;, for which auditions were held in Los Angeles and New York City for undiscovered talent.
In July 2006, Foster made a brief appearance on &quot;The View&quot; as Star Jones&#x27;s vocal coach. In August 2006, he was the musical director for JCPenney Jam&#x27;s &quot;The Concert For American Kids&quot;. Also in 2006, Foster was featured in &quot;Under the Desert Sky&quot;, Andrea Bocceli&#x27;s live album and DVD of a pop concert held in Las Vegas. In 2007, Foster was featured in Bocelli&#x27;s &quot;Vivere Live in Tuscany&quot;, a live album and DVD of a pop concert performed at Bocelli&#x27;s Teatro del Silenzio in Lajatico, Tuscany in July. In November 2007, Foster appeared in &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;″s annual &quot;Favorite Things&quot; episode, performing with Josh Groban.

In September 2008, singer Charice joined Foster on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; with Celine Dion via satellite; and on October 31, he and Andrea Bocelli appeared on &quot;Oprah&quot; again together, where he stated that Bocelli was his &quot;favourite singer on the planet&quot;.

In December 2008, Foster was featured in a PBS special titled &quot;Hit Man: David Foster &amp; Friends&quot;, a concert featuring live performances by Foster and numerous other performers.

Later in 2011, he was featured in Andrea Bocelli&#x27;s live album, &quot;&quot; (also known as &quot;Live in Central Park&quot;) and in Bocelli&#x27;s four PBS specials. Bocelli also performed during Foster&#x27;s &quot;Hit Man&quot; special.

In late 2012, Foster appeared in an episode of &quot;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&quot;. His wife, Yolanda Foster, joined the cast of season three.

In 2015, Foster joined the panel of judges for &quot;Asia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. In 2017 and 2019, he returned as judge with Anggun, Mel C, and Vanness Wu for the second season and third season with Anggun and Jay Park, and also judged the Chinese-language &quot;World&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.

In 2019, PBS hosted &quot;An Intimate Evening with David Foster&quot;. The show includes his wife Katharine McPhee, tenor Fernando Varela, Pia Toscano, Loren Allred, and Shelea.
In 2019, the biographical documentary, &quot;David Foster: Off the Record&quot; was produced and directed by Barry Avrich. It debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2019. It includes archival footage and interviews, and appearances by singers including Barbra Streisand, Michael Bublé, Josh Groban, and Celine Dion.

In 2021, Foster and McPhee competed in season six of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Banana Split&quot;. Foster dressed up as the banana half and did most of the instrument playing while McPhee dressed up as the ice cream half and did most of the singing. They were eliminated in the Group B Finale, where they competed against Jewel as &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot;.

==Christmas album productions==
Foster has produced multiple best-selling Christmas albums beginning with &quot;Once Upon a Christmas&quot;, by Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton in 1984. He produced Celine Dion&#x27;s &quot;These Are Special Times&quot; (1998), Josh Groban&#x27;s &quot;Noël&quot; (2007), Andrea Bocelli&#x27;s &quot;My Christmas&quot; (2009), Michael Bublé&#x27;s &quot;Christmas&quot; (2011), Rod Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Merry Christmas, Baby&quot; (2012), Mary J. Blige&#x27;s &quot;A Mary Christmas&quot; (2013), and Jordan Smith&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Tis the Season&quot; (2016). Thus, he has produced the best-selling Christmas albums of 1984, 1998, 2007–09, and 2011–12. Four of these albums rank among the top fifteen best-selling Christmas albums ever. He composed &quot;Grown-Up Christmas List&quot; (1990).

Foster and his fifth wife Katharine McPhee recorded a seven-song Christmas EP called &quot;Christmas Songs&quot; in 2022. On October 20, 2023, the album was &quot;completed&quot; and re-released with seven additional songs.

==Philanthropy==
Foster created the David Foster Foundation, which supports children in need of medical transplants, for which he was acknowledged in the Juno Awards 2019. In 2018, Foster and his then-fiancée Katharine McPhee attended a fundraiser gala for Friends of the Israel Defense Forces (FIDF) at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles. The event raised a record $60 million for the organization.

==Personal life==
Foster has been married five times and has five daughters, one son and ten grandchildren. His first child, Allison Jones Foster, was born in 1970 when Foster was 20. He placed her for adoption and reconnected with her when she was 30. His first marriage was to singer and writer B.J. Cook. Cook and Foster had one daughter together, Amy (b. 1973), a songwriter and author.

He married his second wife, Rebecca Dyer, on October 27, 1982 and they divorced in 1986. They had three daughters: Sara (b. 1981), Erin (b. 1982), and Jordan (b. 1986).

He married his third wife, songwriter Linda Thompson, in 1991 and divorced in 2005. The two became a songwriting team, collaborating on several songs, including &quot;I Have Nothing&quot;, performed by Whitney Houston in &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; (1992), and &quot;Grown-Up Christmas List&quot;. Foster was stepfather to Brandon and Brody Jenner (Linda&#x27;s sons with Caitlyn Jenner), who both grew up living in his Malibu home. Both Jenner boys starred in a short-lived TV reality show called &quot;The Princes of Malibu&quot; in 2005 which also featured Foster and Thompson and was filmed in their home.

In 1992, Foster was driving on the Pacific Coast Highway when he hit actor and dancer Ben Vereen, who had just suffered a stroke while driving near his Malibu home and was stumbling on the highway, with his car. Vereen was critically injured but recovered after going through physical rehabilitation. Vereen said afterward that he would have died if Foster had not collided with him and then called for emergency services.

Foster married his fourth wife, Dutch model Yolanda Hadid, in Beverly Hills, California on November 11, 2011. David had three stepchildren from Yolanda Foster&#x27;s previous marriage to Mohamed Hadid: Gigi (b. 1995), Bella (b. 1996), and Anwar (b. 1999). On December 1, 2015, Foster announced that after four years of marriage and nine years together, he and Yolanda had made the decision to divorce. The divorce was finalized on October 16, 2017.

In June 2018, Foster became engaged to Katharine McPhee. On June 28, 2019, the couple wed at the Armenian Church of St Yeghiche, South Kensington in London. McPhee gave birth to a son, Rennie David, in February 2021.

Foster&#x27;s sister, producer Jaymes Foster, has a son with Clay Aiken. Foster is a cousin of racecar driver Billy Foster.

<text>(17 July 1846 – 29 August 1866) was the 14th &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan, who held office from 1858 to 1866. During his reign there was much internal turmoil as a result of the &quot;re-opening&quot; of Japan to western nations. Iemochi&#x27;s reign also saw a weakening of the shogunate.

Iemochi died in 1866 and was buried in Zōjō-ji. His Buddhist name was Shonmyoin.

==Biography==

Iemochi, known in his childhood as Kikuchiyo (菊千代), was the eldest son of the 11th-generation Wakayama Domain lord Tokugawa Nariyuki (1801–1846) with his concubine known as Jitsujoin and was born in the domain&#x27;s residence in Edo (modern-day Minato-ku in Tokyo). Nariyuki was a younger son of the 11th &quot;shōgun&quot;, Tokugawa Ienari.

In 1847, at age 1, he was adopted as the heir of the 12th-generation &quot;daimyō&quot; Tokugawa Narikatsu, and succeeded him in 1850, taking the name Tokugawa Yoshitomi following his coming of age in 1851. In 1858 he had audience with &quot;shōgun&quot; Iesada and his wife, Atsuhime short after he was adopted as their son and named as the successor to the main Tokugawa house. The choice of Yoshitomi was not without conflict; there were other factions in the government who supported Tokugawa Yoshinobu or Matsudaira Naritami for &quot;shōgun&quot;; both of them, unlike Yoshitomi, were adults. After assuming the office of shogun, Yoshitomi changed his name to Iemochi.

Before Iesada died he give his will to Ii Naosuke, that:
* First, Ii Naosuke must help Iemochi at administration until Iemochi was old enough to rule.
* Second, all political issues must be discussed with Tenshoin, as Iemochi&#x27;s mother.

As part of the &quot;kōbu gattai&quot; (&quot;Union of Court and Bakufu&quot;) movement, On 11 February 1862, Iemochi married Princess Kazu, daughter of Emperor Ninko. Princess Kazu refused to use the title &quot;Midaidokoro&quot;, and instead only used the title &quot;Miya&quot;.

On 22 April 1863 (&quot;Bunkyū 3, 5th day of the 3rd month&quot;), &quot;shōgun&quot; Iemochi traveled in a great procession to the capital. He had been summoned by the emperor, and had 3,000 retainers as escort. This was the first time since the visit of Iemitsu in the &quot;Kan&#x27;ei&quot; era, 230 years before, that a shogun had visited Kyoto.

His early death at the age of 20 put an end to his short marriage with princess Kazu-no-Miya. Before he died he adopted a son, Tayasu Kamenosuke (later known as Tokugawa Iesato), as his heir. At that time Tayasu Kamenosuke was only 3 years old, but as the Tokugawa shogunate was at war with Chōshū, the adult Yoshinobu was appointed the fifteenth &quot;shōgun&quot;. &quot;Shōgun&quot; Yoshinobu then adopted Iemochi&#x27;s adopted son, Tayasu Kamenosuke. After Iemochi&#x27;s death, Kazu-no-Miya changed her name to Seikan&#x27;in no Miya. The cause of Iemochi&#x27;s death is widely reported as heart failure due to beriberi, a disease caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency.

His successor, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, was the last Tokugawa &quot;shōgun&quot; and witnessed the end of the shogunate, which gave way to the Meiji Restoration.

<text>Tokugawa Ienari (, 18 November 1773 – 22 March 1841) was the eleventh and longest-serving &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan who held office from 1787 to 1837. He was a great-grandson of the eighth shōgun Tokugawa Yoshimune through his son Munetada (1721–1764), head of the Hitotsubashi branch of the family, and his grandson Harusada (1751–1827).

Ienari died in 1841 and was given the Buddhist name Bunkyouin and buried at Kan&#x27;ei-ji.

==Events of Ienari&#x27;s &quot;bakufu&quot;==

The emperor and his court flee the fire, and the Imperial Palace is destroyed. No other re-construction is permitted until a new palace is completed. This fire was considered a major event. The Dutch &quot;VOC&quot; &quot;Opperhoofd&quot; in Dejima noted in his official record book that &quot;people are considering it to be a great and extraordinary heavenly portent.&quot;

==Family life==

===First wife===

In 1778, the four-year-old Hitotsubashi Toyochiyo (豊千代), a minor figure in the Tokugawa clan hierarchy, was betrothed to Shimazu Shigehime or Tadakohime, the four-year-old daughter of Shimazu Shigehide, the &quot;tozama daimyō&quot; of Satsuma Domain on the island of Kyūshū. The significance of this alliance was dramatically enhanced when, in 1781, the young Toyochiyo was adopted by the childless shōgun, Tokugawa Ieharu. This meant that when Toyochiyo became Shōgun Ienari in 1786, Shigehide was set to become the father-in-law of the shōgun. The marriage was completed in 1789, after which Tadako became formally known as &quot;Midaidokoro&quot; Sadako, or &quot;first wife&quot; Sadako. Protocol required that she be adopted into a court family, and the Konoe family agreed to take her in but this was a mere formality.

===Other relationships===
Ienari kept a harem of 900 women and fathered over 75 children.

<text>was a Japanese businessman responsible for founding a number of companies, including what became today&#x27;s Sapporo Breweries, Toa Construction Corporation, Oki Electric Industry, JFE Group and Taiheiyo Cement (formerly Asano Cement).
He came from a samurai family in the Toyama region. His Y-DNA is D1a2a1a2b1a1a8a (D-CTS4093). He was Doctor Asano Taijun&#x27;s son. He was originally named Asano Taijiro. Although He studied medicine, he began business in his hometown and failed. He lost his money and did moonlight flit to Tokyo. He sold drinking water as a street vendor. Then he moved to Yokohama, bought coke (fuel), which a gas company threw away, sold it to Fukagawa Cement Works, and became very rich.
He purchased Fukagawa Cement Works from the government in 1884 (Asano Cement), with help from Shibusawa Eiichi, founded Iwaki Coal Mine in 1884, Oriental Liner (Toyo Kisen) in 1896, Tsurumi Reclamation Company (Toa Construction Corporation) in 1913, Asano Shipbuilding and Engineering (Japan Marine United) in 1916, Nippon Chuya Bank in 1916, Oki Electric Industry in 1917, Asano and Company in 1918, Asano Holding Company in 1918, and diversified his business interests, which eventually became a minor zaibatsu (Asano zaibatsu). His Nippon Chuya Bank was unsuccessful, so he sold it to Yasuda zaibatsu in 1922. Asano zaibatsu kept minor because it did not include a bank and was ranked fifth in scale. Asano is called &quot;the cement king.&quot;

Asano also reclaimed Tokyo bay from 1913 to 1927, made a coastal industrial zone (Keihin Kogyo Chitai) and established the forerunner of the JR Tsurumi Line there, located between Tokyo and Yokohama. Asano Station is named after him. He is called the &quot;father of Keihin industrial area&quot; now.

He founded Asano High School in 1920, and Asano Institute of Technology in 1925.

<doc id="469901" wikidata="Q336383" url="?curid=469901" title="Tokugawa Iesada">
<text>was the 13th &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan. He held office for five years from 1853 to 1858. He was physically weak and was therefore considered by later historians to have been unfit to be &quot;shōgun&quot;. His reign marks the beginning of the Bakumatsu period.

==Early years==
Iesada was born in Edo Castle as Masanosuke (政之助)—the fourth son of the 12th &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyoshi with his concubine, known as Honjuin. As most of Ieyoshi&#x27;s children died in infancy or before coming of age, Iesada was appointed heir at a very early age, but his interaction with people was very restricted in an effort to prevent contracting any illnesses. Some historians have theorized that he may have suffered from cerebral palsy. He had suffered from smallpox in early childhood, which left his face pockmarked.
On the death of Tokugawa Ienari in 1841, concerns were raised on the fitness of Iesada as heir, with Tokugawa Yoshinobu named as a potential successor. However, this was strongly opposed by the &quot;rōjū&quot; Abe Masahiro, and Iesada remained heir.

==&quot;Shōgun&quot; (1853–1858)==
Iesada became &quot;shōgun&quot; on the sudden death of his father, Tokugawa Ieyoshi at the height of the Black Ships episode. Already in poor health, he took no active role in political affairs, leaving negotiations with the Americans in the hand of Abe Masahiro. The Convention of Kanagawa was signed on 31 March 1854. Abe resigned his post shortly afterwards, and was replaced as leader of the &quot;rōjū&quot; by Hotta Masayoshi.

On 4–7 November 1854, the Great Nankaidō earthquakes and tsunamis killed 80,000 people. This was followed by the 1854 Tōkai earthquake on 23 December 1854. The earthquake struck primarily in the Tōkai region but destroyed houses as far away as in Edo. The accompanying tsunami caused damage along the entire coast from the Bōsō Peninsula in modern-day Chiba Prefecture to Tosa Province (modern-day Kōchi Prefecture). The earthquake and tsunami also struck Shimoda on Izu peninsula; and because the port had just been designated as the prospective location for a U.S. consulate, some construed the natural disasters as demonstration of the displeasure of the &quot;kami&quot;.

The 1854 Nankai earthquake followed on 24 December 1854, killing over 10,000 people from the Tōkai region down to Kyushu, and the 1855 earthquake in Edo, one of the Ansei great earthquakes, with resulting fire damage and loss of life. 

On 18 December 1856, he married Princess Atsu, adopted daughter of Shimazu Nariakira and Konoe Tadahiro. She was known as Midaidokoro Atsuko (first-wife Atsuko).

On 21 October 1857, Iesada received the newly arrived American Consul Townsend Harris in an audience at Edo Castle.

Under Hotta Masayoshi&#x27;s advice, Iesada ultimately signed the Harris Treaty of 1858 (the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between Japan and the United States), and subsequently other Unequal Treaties (including the Anglo-Japanese Friendship Treaty, and Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Amity and Commerce) which broke the &quot;sakoku&quot; (isolation) policy and opened Japan to foreign influences.

Kōmei, the reigning emperor at the time, was a major opponent of his policies. This strengthened the &quot;sonnō jōi&quot; movement.

Ii Naosuke was appointed &quot;tairō&quot; from 23 April 1858.

A widespread cholera outbreak from 1858 to 1860 is believed to have killed between 100,000 and 200,000 people in Edo alone.
Iesada died childless in 1858, possibly from the cholera outbreak. His grave is at the Tokugawa clan temple of Kan&#x27;ei-ji in Ueno. His buddhist name was Onkyoin.

Political factions within the &quot;bakufu&quot; clashed over the succession. Tokugawa Nariaki of Mito, Satsuma and others wanted to see Tokugawa Yoshinobu as his successor, while the Ōoku and shogunate officials including Ii Naosuke supported Tokugawa Iemochi, and succeeded. These quarrels ended in the Ansei Purge.

== Health Problem ==
In the difficult situation at the end of the Edo period, the problem of the shogunate before Iesada took office immediately after he took office, and Iesada&#x27;s constitution was very weak when he succeeded him, and he was even said to be a &quot;wasted person&quot;. The abolition refers to the possibility that he may suffer from traumatic cerebral palsy, as well as the performance of the general.

==Family==
Iesada was initially married to Princess Takatsukasa Atsuko (1823–1848), the daughter of &quot;kampaku&quot; Takatsukasa Masahiro in 1842. However, she died of smallpox without having given birth to an heir. His second official wife was Princess Ichijō Hideko (1825–1850), daughter of Ichijō Tadayoshi in 1849. She died of illness less than a year later. His third marriage was to Princess Atsu (1836–1883), the adopted daughter of the daimyō of Satsuma, Shimazu Nariakira. However, none of these marriages produced any children. Before he died, he adopted his cousin as his son, Tokugawa Yoshitomi (later Tokugawa Iemochi).

* Father: Tokugawa Ieyoshi
* Mother: Honjuin (1807–1885)
* Wives: 
** Takaatsukasa Atsuko (1823–1848) later Tenryuin
** Ichijo Hideko (1825–1850) later Sunjoin
** Shimazu Atsuko or Konoe Sumiko, later Tenshō-in
* Concubine: Oshiga no Kata (d. 1857) later Hoken&#x27;in
* Adopted son: Tokugawa Iemochi

==Eras of Iesada&#x27;s &quot;bakufu&quot;==
The years in which Iesada was &quot;shōgun&quot; are more specifically identified by more than one era name, or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Kaei&quot; (1848–1854)
* &quot;Ansei&quot; (1854–1860)

==Ancestry==


==In fiction==
Tokugawa Iesada is featured in the 2008 NHK taiga drama &quot;Atsuhime&quot;, which chronicles the life of his wife Tenshō-in. He is portrayed by Masato Sakai. Iesada&#x27;s portrayal in this series (unlike most other characterizations of him as an imbecile), presents a romanticized (and largely-fictionalized) image him as a reasonable, if weak-willed individual, whose interactions with his wife Atsuhime pushed him to exert effort into his work as &quot;shōgun&quot;.

<doc id="469902" wikidata="Q323443" url="?curid=469902" title="Tokugawa Ieshige">
<text>Tokugawa Ieshige; 徳川 家重 (28 January 1712 – 13 July 1761) was the ninth &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan.

The first son of Tokugawa Yoshimune, his mother was the daughter of Ōkubo Tadanao, known as Osuma no kata. His mother died in 1713 when he was only 2 years old, so he was raised by Yoshimune&#x27;s concubine, Okon no Kata; Okon later gave birth to Tokugawa Munetake, so he was raised by another of Yoshimune&#x27;s concubines, Okume no Kata, as her biological son.

His childhood name was Nagatomi-maru (長福丸). He underwent the &quot;genpuku&quot; coming-of-age ceremony in 1725. His first wife, Nami-no-miya, was the daughter of Prince Fushimi-no-miya Kuninaga (伏見宮 邦永親王). In 1733, Nami-no-Miya Masuko had a miscarriage and died. His second wife, Okō, was the daughter of one of the courtiers who had followed his first wife from the Imperial Court to the Shogunal Court in Edo. This famously good-natured second wife was the mother of Ieharu, who would become Ieshige&#x27;s heir. In &quot;Enkyō&quot; 2 or 1745, Ieshige was made shogun.

Ieshige suffered from chronic ill health and a severe speech defect which rendered his speaking nearly incomprehensible. Yoshimune&#x27;s choice of Ieshige as his heir created considerable controversy within the shogunate as his younger brothers Tokugawa Munetake and Tokugawa Munetada appeared to be far more suitable candidates. Yoshimune continued to insist on his decision, favoring the Confucian principle of primogeniture; and Ieshige continued in the role of formal head of the shogunate. Yoshimune directed affairs after his official retirement in 1745. This attention was designed to ensure that Ieshige was secure in his office. Ieshige remained shogun until 1760.

Uninterested in government affairs, Ieshige left all decisions in the hands of his chamberlain, (1709–1760). He officially retired in 1760 and assumed the title of &quot;Ōgosho,&quot; appointed his first son Tokugawa Ieharu as the 10th &quot;shōgun&quot;, and died the following year.

Ieshige&#x27;s second son Tokugawa Shigeyoshi became the founder of the Shimizu Tokugawa clan, which together with the Tayasu and Hitotsubashi (established by Ieshige&#x27;s younger brothers) became the &quot;gosankyō&quot;, three cadet branches of the Tokugawa family from which future shoguns might be selected if the main line were to die out. They joined the existing three cadet branches, the &quot;gosanke&quot;, to which Ieshige&#x27;s father Yoshimune had been born.

Ieshige&#x27;s reign was beset by corruption, natural disasters, periods of famine and the emergence of the mercantile class, and his clumsiness in dealing with these issues greatly weakened the rule of Tokugawa.
Ieshige died in 1761. His posthumous title is &quot;Junshin-in;&quot; and his grave is at the Tokugawa family mausoleum at Zōjō-ji in Shiba. His remains were disinterred and underwent scientific investigation from 1958 to 1960. It was discovered that his teeth were crooked and badly deformed, confirming historical references to his speech defect.

<doc id="469903" wikidata="Q5025614" url="?curid=469903" title="Cambridge Students' Union">
<text>Cambridge Students&#x27; Union, known as Cambridge SU, is the university-wide representative body for students at the University of Cambridge, England. Its predecessor union was known as Cambridge University Students&#x27; Union or CUSU until its dissolution in July 2020.

Cambridge SU should not be confused with the Cambridge Union Society (often referred to as simply &#x27;the Union&#x27;); membership of both is open to all students at Cambridge, but the Cambridge Union Society is a private society, whereas all students at the University of Cambridge are automatically members of Cambridge SU (although they can opt-out), and Cambridge SU is partially funded by grants from the university.

Until 2020, graduate students at the University of Cambridge were eligible for membership of CUSU as well as the University of Cambridge Graduate Union, specifically for graduate student affairs. In November 2019, students voted by referendum to dissolve both CUSU and the Graduate Union to form one student union, Cambridge SU. The new single Students&#x27; Union was established on 13 July 2020.

==History==
CUSU was founded as the Cambridge Students&#x27; Union (CSU) in 1971 to represent all higher education students studying in Cambridge, that is students attending the University of Cambridge plus undergraduates at CCAT (the then Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology, which in 1993 became Anglia Polytechnic University, Cambridge, renamed to Anglia Ruskin University in 2005). CSU also represented students at Homerton College, then a separate teacher training college in the city.

CSU during its early years from 1971 to 1974 received support from CCAT Students&#x27; Union as CCATSU was from the 1960s the only large NUS-affiliated, and conventionally funded, students&#x27; union in Cambridge. CSU in turn supported CCATSU in its campaigns to get more student housing provided for CCAT degree students, a serious issue for the college by the early 1970s. CCATSU and CSU went their separate ways after 1974.

CSU was formally recognised by the University of Cambridge authorities on 25 May 1984 and renamed, following a student referendum in March 1985, as CUSU – Cambridge University Students Union. CSU&#x27;s second president, in 1972, was Charles Clarke, later a Labour MP, Secretary of State for Education and Home Secretary.

There had been previous university-wide groups, such as CAMNUS (Cambridge NUS), which was founded in 1964 by Gordon Heald, John Bibby and others. CAMNUS arranged certain university-wide student facilities, such as &#x27;CAMNUS Coaches&#x27; (an end-of-term bus service to all parts of the country), and an inter-collegiate mail service.

Following a referendum of members of CUSU and the University of Cambridge Graduate Union in 2019, the two agreed to merge. The new union, Cambridge SU, was established in July 2020.

Between 2020 and 2024, Cambridge SU had seven &quot;SU Campaigns&quot;, which were free to differ from the central SU on policy matters, with six of which representing a particular subset of students. They were:
* LGBT+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender)
* International Students&#x27; Campaign: international students
* Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) Campaign: Black and minority ethnic students
* Women&#x27;s Campaign, known as &quot;WomCam&quot; 
* Disabled Students&#x27; Campaign 
* Class Act, representing students from working-class and disadvantaged educational backgrounds
* Ethical Affairs Campaign, which leads Cambridge SU&#x27;s work on ethical and environmental issues in the university and wider society

The Campaigns were dissolved in the 2024 Governance Review.

==Officers==
Cambridge SU holds elections annually for 8 full-time officers, several part-time officers and a number of delegates to the National Union of Students (NUS) Annual Conference.

The full-time officers take a one-year sabbatical from their studies (or directly after they have graduated) and are:
*President (PG)
*President (UG)
*Access, Education and Participation Officer (PG)
*Access, Education and Participation Officer (UG)
*Disabled Students&#x27; Officer
*Welfare &amp; Community Officer
*Women&#x27;s Officer
*BME Officer

Cambridge SU is unusual in having 8 full time sabbatical roles, with this number placing it at the highest end of all UK students&#x27; unions in terms of number of full-time, elected officers. This number is due to be reduced to five for 2025-26 onwards as part of the 2024 Governance Review.

==Controversy==

In March 2006, the largest Cambridge college students&#x27; union, Trinity College Students&#x27; Union voted to disaffiliate from CUSU for the academic year 2006/2007. Several other colleges were reported to be also considering the option. Trinity College Students&#x27; Union reaffiliated in early 2007, following re-engagement work by the incumbent sabbatical officers. On 14 November 2010, both the JCR and MCR of Corpus Christi College disaffiliated, following a college-wide ballot in which 71% of undergraduates and 86% of postgraduates voted in favour of disaffiliation. Also, in November 2013 Gonville and Caius College disaffiliated following a referendum which saw a result of 213 votes for disaffiliation and 91 votes against.

In 2015 the university had to give CUSU a £100,000 bailout, but incumbent president Priscilla Mensah denied that this was due to financial mismanagement.

In 2019, CUSU presented a surplus budget, ending what the Union described as “a few difficult years in recent history” with regards to its financial situation.

==Former officers==
Notable former officers and sabbaticals include:
* Charles Clarke (King&#x27;s), former Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Norwich South and Home Secretary, President 1971–72
* Mike Gapes (Fitzwilliam), former Labour and Co-operative and, subsequently, Change UK Member of Parliament (MP) for Ilford South, Secretary 1973
* Tom Hayhoe (Corpus Christi), Chairman of West London NHS Trust, President 1977–78
* David Lidington (Sidney Sussex), former Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Aylesbury and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Deputy President 1977–78
* Natalie Ceeney (Newnham), senior civil servant and businessperson, President 1990–91

<doc id="469904" wikidata="Q7575189" url="?curid=469904" title="Spectral evidence">
<text>Spectral evidence is a form of legal evidence based upon the testimony of those who claim to have experienced visions.

Such testimony was frequently given during the witch trials of the 16th and 17th centuries. The alleged victims of witchcraft would claim to have been tormented by the spectral images of certain named members of the community; this was taken as evidence that those named were witches, and had given the Devil permission to assume their appearance. If accepted by a court, this testimony was virtually impossible to refute. However, spectral evidence was rarely used to secure a conviction, as theologians were unable to agree that the Devil could not take on the shape of an innocent person. The debate about the validity of spectral evidence rose to a climax with the Bury St Edmunds witch trial of 1662, and the Salem witch trials of 1692–93.

==Bury St Edmunds witch trial==
At the Bury St Edmunds witch trial of 1662, charges of witchcraft were brought against Amy Denny and Rose Cullender, two elderly residents of Lowestoft, Suffolk, England. The trial acquired lasting significance (chiefly due to the involvement of Matthew Hale, &quot;one of the greatest legal figures&quot; of the 17th century), and became an important precedent for the admissibility of spectral evidence. A published report of the trial, titled &quot;A Tryal of Witches at the Assizes Held at Bury St. Edmunds&quot;, was consulted by magistrates presiding over the Salem witch trials, thirty years later.

The suspected witches, Amy Denny and Rose Cullender, were accused of bewitching several of their neighbours&#x27; children. The alleged victims were reported to be suffering from fits, lameness, and temporary speech loss, and were often said to have been seen coughing up pins. The evidence which tied these afflictions to Denny and Cullender was the testimony of the children that they had often been threatened by apparitions of these women. For instance, Samuel Pacy made the following statement concerning his two daughters:

Not everybody present at the trial accepted this evidence unquestioningly. Three Serjeants-at-Law, among them John Kelynge, raised an objection (although the trial report appears to have been altered, to attribute this objection to Kelynge alone). According to the report:

The judge, Hale, may have taken this point into consideration when he remarked to the jury that they had two questions to consider: &quot;First, Whether or no these Children were Bewitched? Secondly, Whether the Prisoners at the Bar were Guilty of it?&quot; Nevertheless, the jury found Denny and Cullender guilty of thirteen of the fourteen charges brought against them, and they were sentenced to death by hanging.

==Salem witch trials==
===Initial accusations===
The Salem witch trials began in February 1692, when four children of Salem, Massachusetts, began suffering from fits, and complained of being &quot;bitten and pinched by invisible agents&quot;. When pressed to name their assailants, they accused Sarah Good, Sarah Osborne, and the slave Tituba, crying out &quot;that they or specters in their shapes did grievously torment them&quot;.

Brought before the magistrates, Good and Osbourne denied the charges, but Tituba confessed. She claimed to have been coerced by the devil into hurting the children; she had also been threatened by a tall man in black clothes, who made her sign her name in a book. She said that Good and Osbourne were also witches, and described their familiars, which no-one else could see; Good&#x27;s was a yellow bird, and Osbourne&#x27;s were two grotesque creatures. While this testimony was being given, the children broke out into fits, and Tituba claimed to see the spectre of Sarah Good attacking them. All three women were indicted, and were returned to jail to await trial.

This was the beginning of a mass hysteria which saw numerous residents of Salem and surrounding towns arrested on charges of witchcraft. Tituba&#x27;s confession had a far-reaching influence, and set the tone for later claims made against the accused. It was often said that apparitions of the suspected witches had tried to compel their victims to write their names in a book, and both the man in black and the yellow bird were seen in the company of several of the accused, including Martha Corey, Rebecca Nurse, and Sarah Cloyce. Another prominent form of spectral evidence was the appearance of the spirits of the dead, as minister Deodat Lawson wrote:

In May 1692, a Court of Oyer and Terminer was established to try these cases. However, the court faced the problem of how much weight to give to spectral evidence. During the pre-trial hearings, various other types of evidence had been brought against the accused – including evidence of &quot;ordinary witchcrafts&quot; (i.e. the casting of spells resulting in injury or property damage), the discovery of poppets, witches&#x27; marks, and signs of unusual physical strength – but only the spectral evidence had been gathered for every case. Furthermore, of the 156 people taken into custody before the court suspended its activities in September, 79 were charged on the basis of spectral evidence alone.

The strength of spectral evidence was based on the assumption that the Devil could not assume another person&#x27;s shape without their consent. Deodat Lawson stressed this point in a sermon preached on 24 March. He also explained that the Devil, wherever possible, binds into his service &quot;those that make a Visible Profession&quot; of holiness, in order to &quot;more readily pervert others to Consenting unto his subjection&quot;. This was an attempt to allay doubts about the fact that some of the accused, such as Nurse and Corey, were well-respected community members with a reputation for piety.

However, Puritan minister Cotton Mather took a different view. In a letter to magistrate John Richards, Mather advised the court not to place too much stress upon spectral evidence, because &quot;it is very certain that the devils have sometimes represented the shapes of persons not only innocent, but also very virtuous&quot;. He suggested that spectral evidence should be taken as a presumption of guilt, but would not in itself be sufficient for a conviction.

===Internal division===
The first to be tried by the court was Bridget Bishop, who was found guilty and executed. At this point, however, a debate arose among the judges. Contrary to Mather&#x27;s advice, spectral evidence had played a large part in securing Bishop&#x27;s conviction, and this raised questions about the methods of the court. Formal advice was requested from the ministry, and twelve ministers of the Boston area (including Increase Mather) drew up a document entitled &quot;The Return of the Several Ministers Consulted&quot;. Once again, caution was advised:

It was even suggested that a more critical approach to spectral testimonies might give &quot;some remarkable affronts&quot; to the devils responsible for them, and &quot;put a period&quot; to the troubles at Salem. On the other hand, the document closed by recommending &quot;the speedy and vigorous prosecution&quot; of those who had &quot;rendered themselves obnoxious&quot; to the laws of God and man. As a result, the overall message was equivocal. Robert Calef, a contemporary critic of the trials, called the document &quot;perfectly ambidexter, giving as great or greater encouragement to proceed in those dark methods, than cautions against them&quot;. The presiding judge, William Stoughton, read into it only an endorsement of the previous proceedings of the court, and the other judges followed his lead – the only dissenter being Nathaniel Saltonstall, who resigned.

===Wider controversy===
The Court of Oyer and Terminer adjourned on 22 September, with the expectation of reconvening before long. By this time, however, with nineteen people hanged (and one, Giles Corey, crushed to death), criticism of the trials was becoming increasingly vocal.

On 8 October, an influential Boston merchant, Thomas Brattle, wrote an open letter arguing against the unjust proceedings of the court. Brattle rejected the validity of spectral evidence, which he claimed was the &quot;only pertinent evidence&quot; brought against any of the accused. &quot;I think it is clear,&quot; he wrote, &quot;that the prisoner at the bar is brought in guilty, and condemned, merely from the evidences of the afflicted persons.&quot; He argued that the judges were therefore receiving testimony from the Devil, and thought it strange that they &quot;should so far give ear to the Devill, as merely upon his authority to issue out their warrants, and apprehend people&quot;. One proof Brattle gave against spectral evidence was the following:

It was around this time, on September 29, 1692, that the governor of the province, William Phips, who had been absent during the trials, returned to Massachusetts from Maine. In a letter of 12 October, he remarked that he had been surprised to find &quot;many persons in a strange ferment of dissatisfaction&quot;, and on enquiring into the matter, he learned that &quot;the Devill had taken upon him the name and shape of severall persons who were doubtless inocent and to my certain knowledge of good reputation&quot;. He suspended the trials, and forbade the incarceration of any more suspected witches. On 29 October, the court was officially dismissed. Phips next reviewed the petitions for the release of those who remained in jail, and where he found the evidence to be primarily spectral, he released the prisoners on bond to their families.

Cotton Mather defended the court&#x27;s methods in his book, &quot;The Wonders of the Invisible World&quot; (which began circulating in manuscript form in October, but was not published until the following year). While admitting the possibility that &quot;among the Persons represented by the Spectres which now afflict our Neighbours, there will be found some that never explicitly contracted with any of the Evil Angels&quot;, he suggested that these people may have been guilty of lesser offences, for which reason God had permitted the Devil &quot;to bring in these Lesser ones with the rest for their perpetual Humiliation&quot;. Mather also cited the precedent of previous trials, including the Bury St Edmunds case.

Cotton&#x27;s father, Increase Mather, took the opposite approach in his own work, &quot;Cases of Conscience Concerning Evil Spirits Personating Men&quot;. He argued that the Devil could indeed appear in the shape of an innocent person, and cited numerous authorities to that effect, including the Biblical story of the Witch of Endor. Against the argument that God would not allow the Devil to impose upon innocent people in this way, Increase brought forward the example of Job, and insisted that God&#x27;s ways are inscrutable. He concluded that &quot;to take away the Life of any one, meerly because a Spectre or Devil, in a bewitched or possessed person does accuse them, will bring a Guilt of innocent Blood on the Land, where such a thing shall be done&quot;.

However, in a postscript, Increase asserted that his work was not intended as &quot;any Reflection on those worthy Persons who have been concerned in the late Proceedings at Salam&quot;. He recommended Cotton&#x27;s account of the trials, and hoped that &quot;the thinking part of Mankind will be satisfied, that there was more than that which is called Spectre Evidence for the Conviction of the Persons condemned&quot;.

A new court convened in January 1693, to consider the remaining cases; this time, the use of spectral evidence was firmly limited. Almost all of those brought before the court were acquitted; and in May, Phips issued a general pardon, bringing the trials to an end.

==Other cases==
Concurrent with the trials in Salem, spectral evidence was also used in a trial in colonial Rhode Island where Thomas Cornell, Jr., son of Thomas Cornell, was convicted of matricide in the death of his mother, Rebecca.

<doc id="469907" wikidata="Q323422" url="?curid=469907" title="Tokugawa Ietsuna">
<text>was the fourth &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa dynasty of Japan who was in office from 1651 to 1680. He is considered the eldest son of Tokugawa Iemitsu, which makes him the grandson of Tokugawa Hidetada and the great-grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu.

==Early life (1641–1651)==
Tokugawa Ietsuna was born in 1641, allegedly the eldest son of Tokugawa Iemitsu with his concubine, Oraku no Kata later Houjuin. Later Ietsuna was raised with his sister, Chiyohime (born by Ofuri) by Iemitsu&#x27;s concubine, Oman no kata (later Eikoin) and Iemitsu&#x27;s wife, Takatsukasa Takako later Honriin. After Eikoin retired, Senhime (also called Tenjuin) raised him with Honriin. At that time his father was shogun in his own right and had enacted several anti-Christian measures after the bloody Shimabara Rebellion of 1637. Though the suppression of this rebellion quelled all serious threats to Tokugawa rule, it was nonetheless an unsure era. Ietsuna was a frail child, and this carried over into his adult years. Nothing else is known of his youth. His childhood name was Takechiyo (竹千代).

==Shogunal regency (1651–1663)==
Tokugawa Iemitsu died in early 1651, at the age of forty-seven. After his death, the Tokugawa dynasty was at major risk. Ietsuna, the heir, was only ten years old. Nonetheless, despite his age, Tokugawa Ietsuna became shogun in &quot;Kei&#x27;an&quot; 4 (1651). Until he came of age, five regents were to rule in his place, but Shogun Ietsuna nevertheless assumed a role as formal head of the bakufu bureaucracy.

In this period, regents exercised power in the &quot;shogun&quot;″s name. These were Sakai Tadakatsu, Sakai Tadakiyo, Inaba Masanori, Matsudaira Nobutsuna (a distant member of the Tokugawa), and one other. In addition to this regency, Iemitsu handpicked his half-brother, Hoshina Masayuki.

The first thing that Shogun Ietsuna and the regency had to address was the &quot;rōnin&quot; (masterless samurai). During the reign of Shogun Iemitsu, two samurai, Yui Shōsetsu and Marubashi Chūya, had been planning an uprising in which the city of Edo would be burned to the ground and, amidst the confusion, Edo Castle would be raided and the &quot;shōgun&quot;, other members of the Tokugawa and high officials would be executed. Similar occurrences would happen in Kyoto and Osaka. Shosetsu was himself of humble birth and he saw Toyotomi Hideyoshi as his idol.

Nonetheless, the plan was discovered after the death of Iemitsu, and Ietsuna&#x27;s regents were brutal in suppressing the rebellion, which came to be known as the Keian Uprising or the &quot;Tosa Conspiracy&quot;. Chuya was brutally executed along with his family and Shosetsu&#x27;s family. Shosetsu chose to commit seppuku rather than being captured.

In 1652, about 800 &quot;rōnin&quot; led a small disturbance on Sado Island, and this was also brutally suppressed. But for the most part, the remainder of Ietsuna&#x27;s rule was not disturbed anymore by the &quot;rōnin&quot; as the government became more civilian-oriented.

In &quot;Meireki&quot; 3 (1657), on the 18th–19th days of the 1st month, when Ietsuna was almost 20 years old, a great fire broke out in Edo and burned the city to the ground. Ietsuna&#x27;s concubine Oyo burned to death in the fire. It took two years to rebuild the city and bakufu officials supervised the rebuilding of the city. In 1659, Ietsuna presided over the opening ceremonies. In the 11th month he married Asa no Miya Akiko, daughter of Fushimi no Miya Sadakiyo. It is said that his relationship was quite good with Asa no Miya, though they didn&#x27;t have a child; they adopted Naohime, daughter of Tokugawa Mitsutomo.

==&quot;Bakufu&quot; power struggle (1663–1671)==

In 1663, the regency for &quot;shōgun&quot; Ietsuna ended, but the regents still held power for him, the first time that the power behind the bakufu was not a former &quot;shōgun&quot;. Ietsuna&#x27;s chief advisors were now Hoshina Masayuki, Ietsuna&#x27;s uncle (whom he had deep regard for) Itakura Shigenori, Tsuchiya Kazunao, Kuze Hiroyuki, and Inaba Masanori. Even though Ietsuna was now ruling in his own right, these former regents now became his official advisors, and in some cases, acted for him. In some cases, however, Ietsuna acted upon his own accord, as when he came up with the idea of abolishing junshi, where a samurai follows his lord into death.

* 1663 (&quot;Kanbun 3&quot;). The shogunate banned suicides due to fidelity (&quot;junshi&quot;).
* 1669 (&quot;Kanbun 9&quot;). An Ainu rebellion broke out in Hokkaido.

Another example of this is in 1671 when the Date family of Sendai was involved in a succession dispute. The bakufu intervened and prevented another rendition of the Ōnin War. By 1671, however, many of the former regents were either dead or retired, and Ietsuna began to rule in his own right.

==&quot;Shōgun&quot; (1671–1680)==

Following the succession dispute of the Date, very few disturbances occurred for the remainder of Ietsuna&#x27;s reign, except some defiant &quot;daimyōs&quot;.

In 1679, &quot;shōgun&quot; Ietsuna fell ill. His succession began to be discussed, in which Sakai Tadakiyo took an active role. He suggested that a son of Emperor Go-Sai become the next shogun, following the precedent of the later Kamakura shoguns, who in reality were members of the blood royal. Tadakiyo probably saw himself as becoming powerful like the Hōjō regents, and thus many members of the Tokugawa blood preferred Shogun Ietsuna&#x27;s younger brother Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, also a son of Shogun Iemitsu, to become &quot;shōgun&quot;.

* 4 June 1680 (&quot;Enpō 8, 8th day of the 5th month&quot;): &quot;Shōgun&quot; Ietsuna dies; and he is succeeded as shogun by Tsunayoshi.

Tadakiyo retired, embarrassed, and shortly after, Tokugawa Ietsuna died in 1680. His posthumous name was Genyū-in (厳有院) and was buried in Kan&#x27;ei-ji. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Tsunayoshi.

Though Ietsuna proved to be an able leader, affairs were largely controlled by the regents his father had appointed, even after Ietsuna was declared old enough to rule in his own right.

==Eras of Ietsuna&#x27;s &quot;bakufu&quot;==
The years in which Ietsuna was &quot;shōgun&quot; are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Keian&quot; (1648–1652)
* &quot;Jōō&quot; (1652–1655)
* &quot;Meireki&quot; (1655–1658)
* &quot;Manji&quot; (1658–1661)
* &quot;Kanbun&quot; (1661–1673)
* &quot;Enpō&quot; (1673–1681)

<text>Giuseppe Pizzardi (13 July 1877 – 1 August 1970) was an Italian cardinal of the Catholic Church who served as prefect of the Congregation for Seminaries and Universities from 1939 to 1968, and secretary of the Holy Office from 1951 to 1959. Pizzardo was elevated to the cardinalate in 1937.

==Biography==

Born in Savona, Pizzardo studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University, Pontifical Roman Athenaeum Saint Apollinare, and the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy before being ordained a priest on 19 September 1903.

From 1908 to 1909, he did pastoral work in Rome and served in the Vatican Secretariat of State. Pizzardo was raised to the rank of monsignor, and appointed secretary of the nunciature to Bavaria, on 7 June 1909. In the Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, he was appointed: undersecretary (1920), substitute (1921), and secretary (1929). He became an apostolic protonotary on 11 January 1927.

Pope Pius XI appointed him Titular Archbishop of Cyrrhus on 28 March 1930, and on the following 22 April, Titular Archbishop of Nicaea. Pizzardo received his episcopal consecration on 27 April of that same year from Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli, with Archbishop Giuseppe Palica and Francesco Marchetti-Selvaggiani serving as co-consecrators.

He was named president of the Pontifical Commission for Russia on 21 December 1934, and an assistant at the papal throne on 19 January 1936. He was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Via Lata by Pius XI in the consistory of 13 December 1937. Pizzardo was prefect of the Congregation for Seminaries and Universities from 14 March 1939 until his resignation on 13 January 1968.

He was named secretary of the Holy Office (the equivalent of what is now called prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) on 16 February 1951 by Pope Pius XII, for whom he had worked many years in the Secretariat of State. He resigned on 12 October 1959. He was Cardinal-Bishop of Albano from 21 June 1948. He attended the Second Vatican Council.

Archives opened to the public in 2024 show Pizzardo defended Marcial Maciel, a priest known to the Vatican as a drug addict and sexual abuser, from a measure being written by Giovanni Battista Scapinelli. Memos show the measure originally required Maciel to cease any contact with his students or be suspended a divinis. The measure was edited to remove the prohibition against contact with seminarians, and later documents say further actions against Maciel could not proceed due to &quot;recommendations and interventions by high-ranking personalities&quot;.

He was known as an early patron and mentor of Giovanni Battista Montini, the future Pope Paul VI, who is said to have voted for Pizzardo at the 1963 papal conclave. Though they became more distant as Montini rose in power, Pope Paul&#x27;s final trip away from his summer residence before his death in August 1978 was to a memorial Mass on the anniversary of Pizzardo&#x27;s death.

Pizzardo was considered to be a highly conservative clergyman. He opposed the French worker-priest movement, and Catholic participation in the Protestant Cold War group, Moral Re-Armament.

==Other roles ==
He was also involved in Azione Cattolica, serving on its Central Committee as ecclesiastical assistant in 1923 and president in 1938.

Appointed sub-dean of the College of Cardinals on 29 March 1965, Cardinal Pizzardo was one of the cardinal electors in the conclaves of 1939, 1958, and 1963.

<doc id="469910" wikidata="Q16965816" url="?curid=469910" title="Normal balance">
<text>In accounting, the normal balance of an account is the type of net balance that it should have.

Any particular account contains debit and credit entries. The account&#x27;s net balance is the difference between the total of the debits and the total of the credits. This can be a net debit balance when the total debits are greater, or a net credit balance when the total credits are greater. By convention, one of these is the normal balance type for each account according to its category. Asset and expense accounts have a normal debit balance, while liability, equity and income accounts have a normal credit balance. Generally a normal balance is shown in statements as a positive number. In the case of a contra account, however, the normal balance convention is reversed and a normal balance is reported either as a negative number, or alongside its parent balance as an amount subtracted.

An abnormal balance often indicates an accounting error. Cash on hand should never have a net credit balance, since one cannot credit (pay from) cash what has not been debited (paid in). Similarly, if a liability account happens to be overpaid, it would be incorrect to continue reporting it as a liability with a debit balance because it no longer represents an amount owed. It would properly be reported as an asset, and possibly written off to a zero balance if the overpayment is not recoverable.

<doc id="469914" wikidata="Q7935762" url="?curid=469914" title="Viscount Gormanston">
<text>Viscount Gormanston is a title in the Peerage of Ireland created in 1478 and held by the head of the Preston family, which hailed from Lancashire. It is the oldest vicomital title in the British Isles; the holder is Premier Viscount of Ireland.

The Preston family descends from Sir Robert Preston, who served as Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Sometime between 1365 and 1370 he was created Baron Gormanston by writ to the Parliament of Ireland. His son and heir, the second Baron, played a prominent part in public affairs, and was arrested for treason in 1418. His great-grandson, the fourth Baron, served as Lord Deputy of Ireland: in 1478 he was created Viscount Gormanston in the Peerage of Ireland. His son, the second Viscount, served as Lord Justice of Ireland in 1525. A later descendant, the seventh Viscount, was a supporter of King James II and was outlawed after the Glorious Revolution.

Jenico Preston helped to suppress the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and in 1800 he had the outlawry reversed and was summoned to the Irish House of Lords as the twelfth Viscount Gormanston. He was the great-grandson of Anthony Preston, the &quot;de jure&quot; ninth Viscount Gormanston, the nephew of the seventh Viscount. The twelfth Viscount was succeeded by his son, the thirteenth Viscount. In 1868 he was created Baron Gormanston, in County Meath, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave the Viscounts an automatic seat in the House of Lords. His son, the fourteenth Viscount, notably served as Governor of British Guiana and as Governor of Tasmania. The 15th Viscount was a Captain in the Royal Irish Fusiliers and a Deputy Lieutenant for County Meath. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s great-grandson, the seventeenth Viscount who succeeded to the titles in 1940 at the age of seven months after his father was killed in action during the Battle of France during the Second World War.

Another member of the Preston family was Thomas Preston, 1st Viscount Tara. He was the second son of the fourth Viscount Gormanston. Also, John Preston, 1st Baron Tara, was a descendant of a younger brother.

The unusual first name Jenico borne by many Preston boys derives from the Gascon-born soldier Sir Jenico d&#x27;Artois, a prominent military commander who became a substantial landowner in Ireland. His daughter Jane married the 3rd Baron Gormanston, and was the mother of Sir Robert Preston, who was created a viscount.

The family seat was Gormanston Castle, County Meath, close to the county border with Dublin.

<text>In computing, a print job is a file or set of files that has been submitted to be printed with a printer.

Jobs are typically identified by a unique number, and are assigned to a particular destination, usually a printer. Jobs can also have options associated with them such as media size, number of copies and priority.

A Print Job is a single queueable print system object that represents a document that needs to be rendered and transferred to a printer. Printer jobs are created on specific print queues and can not be transferred between print queues.

== Components==
Job Id: Uniquely identifies the print job for the given print queue.

Spool file: It is responsible for the on-disk representation of data.

Shadow File: It is responsible for the on-disk representation of the job configuration.

Status: We can describe this in three parts:

* Spooling: It represents the message that the printing application is still working.
* Printing: It represents the message that spool file is being read by the print processor.
* Printed: It represents the message that the job has been fully written to the port.

Data Type: It Identifies the format of the data in the spool file like EMF, RAW.

Other configuration: Name, set of named properties, etc

== Route ==
In larger environments, print jobs may go through a centralized print server, before reaching the printing destination. Some (multifunction) printers have local storage (like a hard disk drive) to process and queue the jobs before printing.

== Security ==
When getting rid of old printers with local storage, one should keep in mind that confidential print jobs (documents) are potentially still locally unencrypted on the hard disk drive and can be undeleted.

<text>Balthasar Hubmaier (1480 – 10 March 1528) was an influential German Anabaptist leader. He was one of the most well-known and respected Anabaptist theologians of the Reformation.

== Early life and education ==
He was born in Friedberg, Bavaria, in 1480. Information on his parentage is lacking.

He attended Latin School at Augsburg, and entered the University of Freiburg on 1 May 1503. Insufficient funds caused him to leave the university and teach for a time at Schaffhausen, Switzerland. He returned to Freiburg in 1507 and received both a bachelor&#x27;s and a master&#x27;s degree in 1511. In 1512, he received a doctor&#x27;s degree from the University of Ingolstadt under John Eck, and became the university&#x27;s vice-rector by 1515. Hubmaier&#x27;s fame as a pulpiteer was widespread. He left the University of Ingolstadt for a pastorate of the Roman Catholic church at Regensburg in 1516. After Maximilian I&#x27;s death in 1519, Hubmaier helped orchestrate a violent pogrom against Regensburg&#x27;s Jews, as well as the total destruction of their synagogue; after the Jews&#x27; murder and expulsion, he was instrumental in orchestrating—near the site of the erstwhile synagogue—an image cult of the Beautiful Maria of Regensburg, which drew pilgrims from all over Europe and was much criticized by Reformers. In 1521 Hubmaier went to Waldshut-Tiengen. In 1524, he married Elizabeth Hügline from Reichenau, Baden-Württemberg.

==Reformer and Anabaptist==
In 1522 he became acquainted with Heinrich Glarean (Conrad Grebel&#x27;s teacher) and Erasmus at Basel. In March 1523, in Zürich, Hübmaier met with Huldrych Zwingli and even participated in a disputation there in October of that same year. In the disputation, he set forth the principle of obedience to the Scriptures, writing, &quot;In all disputes concerning faith and religion, the scriptures alone, proceeding from the mouth of God, ought to be our level and rule.&quot; It was evidently here that Hübmaier committed to abandoning infant baptism, a practice he could not support with Scripture. He held that even where the Scriptures appear to contain contradictions, both truths are to be held simultaneously.

Anabaptist Wilhelm Reublin arrived in Waldshut in 1525, having been driven out of Zürich. In April Reublin baptized Hubmaier and sixty others. In Waldshut, Hubmaier&#x27;s increasingly Anabaptist views gained him the disfavor of Prince Ferdinand. It was that rivalry that would eventually lead to Hubmaier&#x27;s martyrdom. Hubmaier initially went to Schaffhausen in order to find protection against the Prince.

In December 1525, Hubmaier again fled to Zürich to escape the Austrian army. Hoping to find refuge, Zwingli instead had him arrested. While a prisoner, Hubmaier requested a disputation on baptism, which was granted. The disputation yielded some unusual events. Ten men, four of whom Hubmaier requested, were present for the disputation. Within the discussion, Hubmaier proceeded to quote statements by Zwingli in which he asserted that children should not be baptized until they had been instructed. Zwingli responded that he had been misunderstood. Hubmaier&#x27;s criticism went further by placing Zwingli&#x27;s reversal on the issue against Zwingli&#x27;s reform against the Catholics. Hubmaier wrote, &quot;If you do not [demonstrate infant baptism from Scripture], the vicar will complain that you have used against him a sword that you now lay aside.&quot;

Despite Hubmaier&#x27;s arguments, the council sided with the native Zwingli and ruled in Zwingli&#x27;s favor. The bewildered Hübmaier agreed to recant. But before the congregation the next day, he attested the mental and spiritual anguish brought on by his actions and stated, &quot;I cannot and I will not recant.&quot; Back in prison and under the torture of the rack, he did offer the required recantation. He was then allowed to leave Switzerland and journeyed to Nikolsburg in Moravia. This weakness troubled him deeply and brought forth his &quot;Short Apology&quot; in 1526, which includes the statement: &quot;I may err—I am a man—but a heretic I cannot be… O God, pardon me my weakness&quot;.

== Prison and death==
In Nikolsburg, Hubmaier&#x27;s preaching soon made converts to Anabaptism out of the group of Zwinglians who lived in the area. Political fortunes turned, however, and Ferdinand, to whom Hubmaier had already become an enemy while in Waldshut, gained control of Bohemia, thus placing Hubmaier once again in Ferdinand&#x27;s jurisdiction. Hubmaier and his wife were seized by the Austrian authorities and taken to Vienna. He was held in the castle Gratzenstein (now called &quot;Burg Kreuzenstein&quot; in German), until March 1528.

&quot;I may err – I am a man,&quot; he wrote, &quot;but a heretic I cannot be, because I ask constantly for instruction in the word of God.&quot; He suffered torture on the rack, and was tried for heresy and convicted. On 10 March 1528, he was taken to the public square and executed by burning. His wife exhorted him to remain steadfast. A monument to &quot;Dr. Balthasar Hubmaier&quot; was erected on Dr.-Karl-Lueger-Platz in Vienna. There is a plaque in the platz. 

Three days after his execution, his wife, with a stone tied around her neck, was drowned in the River Danube.

== Views ==

===On the Trinity===
Hubmaier was more conservative than some Anabaptists, such as Hans Denck and Leonhard Schiemer, who went on to deny the doctrine of the Trinity, or avoided emphasis of the doctrine similar to Menno Simons. He was aided in regaining the support of the Nikolsburg preachers against Hans Hut by the latter&#x27;s assertion that Christ was only a &quot;great prophet.&quot;

===On government and the sword===
As a &quot;Schwertler&quot; (of-the-sword) Anabaptist, Hubmaier believed government to be an institution ordained by God. According to the view presented in his writings, Christians have a responsibility to support the secular government and pay taxes. While Hubmaier may be considered a moderate pacifist, he clearly stated his beliefs regarding the government&#x27;s responsibility to defend the righteous, the innocent, and the helpless, in his work, &quot;On the Sword&quot;. Moreover, he believed that Christians should take up the sword if ordered to do so by the ruling government for a just cause. The Christian&#x27;s use of the sword is the primary distinction between &quot;Schwertler&quot; Anabaptism and the total pacifism of &quot;Stäbler&quot; (staff/cane-bearing) Anabaptism.

===On baptism===
Much of Hubmaier&#x27;s work centered on the issue of baptism because of the polemical nature of the issue in distinguishing the emerging Anabaptist movement from Zwinglian or other magisterial reform movements. Hubmaier rejected the notion of infant baptism as unscriptural and was a proponent of believer&#x27;s baptism, i.e. that baptism is an ordinance for those who respond to the gospel. The importance of this point in Hubmaier&#x27;s theology is demonstrated by the fact that the first half of his catechism is reserved for clarification of the issue. He further rejected the Catholic doctrine of baptism insofar as it was &quot;ex opere operato&quot; and viewed the rite as a symbol of entrance into and accountability to the community of faith. It is not entirely clear what mode of baptism Hubmaier practiced, but it seems as though he continued practicing affusion as he had himself been baptized and that the mode of immersion among Anabaptists was a somewhat later development.

===On the mother of Jesus===
Despite his break from the Catholic Church, Hubmaier never abandoned his belief in the perpetual virginity of Mary and continued to esteem Mary as theotokos (&quot;mother of God&quot;). These two doctrinal stances are addressed in Articles Nine and Ten, respectively, of Hubmaier&#x27;s work, &quot;Apologia&quot;. &quot;Of course Mary was the mother of the LORD JESUS, who was God in the flesh—&quot;GOD WITH US EMANUEL&quot;. What Hubmaier rejected was the teaching that Mary was co-Redeemer and without sin. He believed that Jesus the Christ was the only sinless being without an earthly Father.

===On the vernacular===
Having a university education meant that Hubmaier would have been familiar with Latin, the language in which all official church communication was at that time conducted. Despite his familiarity with the language, he chose to communicate in the vernacular, which for him was German, for the purpose of communicating to the common people who would not have understood Latin. This is evidenced by the fact that his writings were written in German. Further evidence of this comes from this quote of his, &quot;The death of the Lord should be preached after any land’s tongue… It is much better that a single verse of the psalms be spoken in every land after the language of the common people than five entire psalms be sung in a foreign language and not be understood in the church.&quot;

===On women===
Hubmaier&#x27;s writings dealt a little with the subject of women. He compared God&#x27;s discipline of his children with a teacher whipping a student, or a man beating his wife. It is unknown if Hubmaier agreed with the practice of beating one&#x27;s students or one&#x27;s wife, for he did not elaborate in his work. As with any figure from earlier times, however, we cannot judge precisely Hubmaier&#x27;s view on women based on such a reference.

===On restoration===
Hubmaier believed that restored men and women had a free spirit, which was not affected by the Fall of Adam.

===On the Church Fathers===
Hubmaier made reference to the Church Fathers frequently in his works, often to show the historical nature of his arguments. Hubmaier was familiar with the works of at least a dozen Church Fathers, including Origen, Tertullian, Basil of Caesarea, Ambrose, John Chrysostom, Cyprian, and Augustine of Hippo.

According to historian and theologian Andrew Klager, &quot;Hubmaier not only cognitively accepted the teachings of the fathers on baptism and free will, but embraced them as co-affiliates with himself in the one, holy, apostolic &quot;ecclesia universalis&quot; in protest against the errant papal &quot;ecclesia particularis&quot; as per the composition of his ecclesiology.&quot; In terms of how Hubmaier accessed the writings of the Church Fathers, he &quot;was inspired by humanist principles, especially &quot;ad fontes&quot;, restitutionism, and rejection of scholastic syllogism and glosses in favour of full, humanist editions of the fathers based on an improved focus on grammar and philology.&quot; Although Hubmaier references the Church Fathers in many of his works, his two treatises called &quot;Old and New Teachers on Believers Baptism&quot; (1526) provide his most systematic and deliberate exploration of the thought of the Fathers on baptism specifically.

=== On the two wills of God ===
Hubmaier proposed an idea of God having two Wills; one was called the &quot;absolute&quot; will and could never be changed, also called God&#x27;s &quot;hidden&quot; will, and another which could be accepted or rejected by people was called the &quot;ordained&quot; will, also titled God&#x27;s &quot;Revealed&quot; will. The absolute will of God was paired with Predestination while the ordained will was connected to verses in the Bible which seemed to imply Free will. In Hubmaier&#x27;s concept both Determinism &amp; Free Will existed; a form of Theological Compatibilism, an idea in Christianity later articulated by Catholic Jesuit priest Luis de Molina (1535–1600) through his idea of &quot;Middle Knowledge.&quot;

<doc id="469924" wikidata="Q1157843" url="?curid=469924" title="Dale Hawerchuk">
<text>Dale Martin Hawerchuk (April 4, 1963 – August 18, 2020) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player and coach. Drafted first overall by the Winnipeg Jets in the 1981 NHL Entry Draft, Hawerchuk played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for 16 seasons as a member of the Jets, Buffalo Sabres, St. Louis Blues, and Philadelphia Flyers. He won the NHL&#x27;s Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year in 1982 and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in his second year of eligibility in 2001. Hawerchuk served as the head coach of the Barrie Colts of the Ontario Hockey League from 2010 to 2019.

==Playing career==
Hawerchuk was a young prodigy who received his first pair of skates at age two and, according to his father Ed, &quot;was skating before he could walk.&quot; Beginning competitive hockey at age four, Hawerchuk demonstrated superior skills almost immediately. At the Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament, he scored all eight goals during an 8–1 victory in the finals, smashing the longstanding record by the legendary Guy Lafleur. By age 15, the famed Oshawa Generals offered him a tryout, though he did not make the team. In 1979, Hawerchuk was selected sixth overall by the Cornwall Royals of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, and became somewhat of a rarity: a Toronto-born player starring in the QMJHL. He recorded 103 points and was named Rookie of the Year. Hawerchuk was the playoff MVP and led the Royals to the Memorial Cup championship. In his second junior year, he scored 81 goals and 183 points and led the Royals to their second consecutive Memorial Cup title. He was named a QMJHL First Team All-Star, the Canadian Major Junior Player of the Year, and Memorial Cup MVP.

The Winnipeg Jets selected Hawerchuk first overall in the 1981 NHL Entry Draft, ahead of fellow future Hall of Famers Ron Francis, Grant Fuhr, and Chris Chelios. Hawerchuk immediately became Winnipeg&#x27;s star attraction, leading the Jets to what was at the time the largest single-season turnaround in NHL history, a 48-point improvement. He set the NHL record for most points by an 18-year-old, finishing with 103, and won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s Rookie of the Year. He also played in that season&#x27;s All-Star Game. Hawerchuk recorded 91 points in his second season, then hit the 100-plus point plateau for the next five consecutive years, including a career-high 53 goals and 130 points in 1984–85.

During the 1990 NHL Entry Draft, Hawerchuk was involved in a blockbuster trade. Along with Winnipeg&#x27;s first-round choice (14th overall pick, Brad May) in the draft, he was dealt to the Buffalo Sabres for Phil Housley, Scott Arniel, Jeff Parker and Buffalo&#x27;s first-round choice (19th overall, Keith Tkachuk). Over the next four years, he recorded no fewer than 86 points in a season. His point totals fell off during an injury-plagued and lockout-shortened 1994–95 season. In 1995, with the Sabres looking to slash team salary, he signed a three-year contract with the St. Louis Blues, recording 41 points in 66 games before a trade to the Philadelphia Flyers in March 1996. He finished the season strongly, with 20 points in the final 16 regular-season games and adding nine points in the playoffs. The next season, he was plagued by injuries but managed 34 points and played in his fifth All-Star Game. Hawerchuk announced his retirement following the 1996–97 season at age 34 due to a degenerative left hip. His appearance with the Flyers in the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals marked the only time any of his teams advanced past the second round of the playoffs.

He played for Team Canada in the 1987 Canada Cup tournament, and had a goal and two assists in the decisive third game of the Finals against the Soviets. Late in the third period, he won the face-off that led to Canada&#x27;s most famous goal and tied up with the Russian player who tried to check Mario Lemieux at centre ice, allowing Lemieux to take Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s pass in the slot for the series winner. Hawerchuk was named Canada&#x27;s MVP for that decisive game. Commentators remarked on his ability in the series to switch from being a goal scorer to a mucker and grinder. Hawerchuk was also key to Canada&#x27;s 1991 Canada Cup victory.

In a poll of NHL general managers during the mid-1980s asking them to select the player they would start a franchise with, Hawerchuk was voted third behind only Gretzky and Paul Coffey. He retired with 518 goals, 891 assists and 1,409 points, placing him 18th on the career NHL points list. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001.

The Phoenix Coyotes (successor to the Jets) retired Hawerchuk&#x27;s No. 10 during the 2006–07 NHL season.

==Post-playing career==
Hawerchuk became the president, director of hockey operations, and primary owner of the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League&#x27;s Orangeville Crushers in 2007. He left this position in 2010.

On June 4, 2010, the Barrie Colts of the Ontario Hockey League named Hawerchuk as their head coach and director of hockey operations. The 2010–11 season was a rebuilding one for the Colts, as the team went 15–49–2–2, missing the playoffs for the first time in team history. In his sophomore year, the 2011–12 season, Hawerchuk amassed a record of 40–23–3–2; a significant improvement over his rookie season as bench boss of the Colts.

==Personal life==
Hawerchuk was born in Toronto, Ontario, but grew up in Oshawa, Ontario. He was married to Crystal, whom he met in Manitoba while playing for the Jets. The couple had three children. 

Hawerchuk&#x27;s son Ben Hawerchuk plays professional hockey as a forward for the Cincinnati Cyclones of the ECHL. Ben had previously played for the Barrie Colts.

===Illness and death===
In 2019, Hawerchuk announced he would be taking a leave of absence from the Colts for health reasons, which was later revealed to be stomach cancer. Hawerchuk completed a course of chemotherapy in April 2020, but died on August 18, 2020, at the age of 57. He was buried in Thornton Cemetery in Oshawa.

The new incarnation of the Jets, as a tribute to Hawerchuk, would include said tribute as part of their 10th anniversary logo for the 2020/21 season (the logo also being worn as a patch on all team jerseys), with his number 10 in the center enclosed in a black circle.

*Inducted into the Phoenix Coyotes &quot;Ring of Honor&quot; in 2007, joining Bobby Hull and Thomas Steen. The Jets/Coyotes franchise retired his number 10 on April 5, 2007. Unlike Hull and Steen, who were honored in Jets colors, Hawerchuk&#x27;s number was retired in Coyotes apparel, despite the fact that Hawerchuk never played in Phoenix.
*Honored by the second Winnipeg Jets franchise: named captain of the Jets&#x27; alumni squad at the 2016 Heritage Classic, inducted into the team&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2017, and by a statue near the Canada Life Centre, the Jets&#x27; current arena located in downtown Winnipeg. Out of respect for Hawerchuk, number 10 has not been worn by any Jets player since that team relocated to Winnipeg in 2011.
*Holds the record for most assists in a period, with five in the second period of Winnipeg&#x27;s 7-3 win at Los Angeles on March 6, 1984 .

<text>The Potala Palace is a &quot;dzong&quot; fortress in Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region in China. It was the winter palace of the Dalai Lamas from 1649 to 1959, has been a museum since then, and a World Heritage Site since 1994.

The palace is named after Mount Potalaka, the mythical abode of the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. The 5th Dalai Lama started its construction in 1645 after one of his spiritual advisers, Konchog Chophel (died 1646), pointed out that the site was ideal as a seat of government, situated as it is between Drepung and Sera monasteries and the old city of Lhasa. It may overlie the remains of an earlier fortress called the White or Red Palace on the site, built by Songtsen Gampo in 637.

The building measures east-west and north-south, with sloping stone walls averaging thick, and thick at the base, and with copper poured into the foundations to help proof it against earthquakes. Thirteen storeys of buildings, containing over 1,000 rooms, 10,000 shrines and about 200,000 statues, soar on top of Marpo Ri, the &quot;Red Hill&quot;, rising more than in total above the valley floor.

Tradition has it that the three main hills of Lhasa represent the &quot;Three Protectors of Tibet&quot;. Chokpori, just to the south of the Potala, is the soul-mountain () of Vajrapani, Pongwari that of Manjusri, and Marpori, the hill on which the Potala stands, represents Avalokiteśvara.

== History ==
The site on which the Potala Palace rises is built over a palace erected by Songtsen Gampo on the Red Hill. The Potala contains two chapels on its northwest corner that conserve parts of the original building. One is the Phakpa Lhakhang, the other the Chogyel Drupuk, a recessed cavern identified as Songtsen Gampo&#x27;s meditation cave. Lozang Gyatso, the Great Fifth Dalai Lama, started the construction of the modern Potala Palace in 1645 after one of his spiritual advisers, Konchog Chophel (died 1646), pointed out that the site was ideal as a seat of government, situated as it is between Drepung and Sera monasteries and the old city of Lhasa. The external structure was built in 3 years, while the interior, together with its furnishings, took 45 years to complete. The Dalai Lama and his government moved into the Potrang Karpo (&#x27;White Palace&#x27;) in 1649. Construction lasted until 1694, some twelve years after his death. The Potala was used as a winter palace by the Dalai Lama from that time. The Potrang Marpo (&#x27;Red Palace&#x27;) was added between 1690 and 1694.

The new palace got its name from a hill on Cape Comorin at the southern tip of India—a rocky point sacred to the bodhisattva of compassion, who is known as Avalokitesvara, or Chenrezi. The Tibetans themselves rarely speak of the sacred place as the &quot;Potala&quot;, but rather as &quot;Peak Potala&quot; (&quot;Tse Potala&quot;), or most commonly as &quot;the Peak&quot;.

The palace was moderately damaged during the Tibetan uprising against the Chinese in 1959, when Chinese shells were launched into the palace&#x27;s windows. Before Chamdo Jampa Kalden was shot and taken prisoner by soldiers of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, he witnessed &quot;Chinese cannon shells began landing on Norbulingka past midnight on 19 March 1959... The sky lit up as the Chinese shells hit the Chakpori Medical College and the Potala.&quot; It also escaped damage during the Cultural Revolution in 1966 through the personal intervention of Zhou Enlai, who was then the Premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. According to Tibetan historian Tsering Woeser, the palace, which harboured &quot;over 100,000 volumes of scriptures and historical documents&quot; and &quot;many store rooms for housing precious objects, handicrafts, paintings, wall hangings, statues, and ancient armour&quot;, &quot;was almost robbed empty&quot;.The Potala Palace was inscribed to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1994. In 2000 and 2001, Jokhang Temple and Norbulingka were added to the list as extensions to the sites. Rapid modernisation has been a concern for UNESCO, however, which expressed concern over the building of modern structures immediately around the palace which threaten the palace&#x27;s unique atmosphere. The Chinese government responded by enacting a rule barring the building of any structure taller than 21 metres in the area. UNESCO was also concerned over the materials used during the restoration of the palace, which commenced in 2002 at a cost of RMB180 million (US$22.5 million), although the palace&#x27;s director, Qiangba Gesang, has clarified that only traditional materials and craftsmanship were used. The palace has also received restoration works between 1989 and 1994, costing RMB55 million (US$6.875 million).

The number of visitors to the palace was restricted to 1,600 a day, with opening hours reduced to six hours daily to avoid over-crowding from 1 May 2003. The palace was receiving an average of 1,500 a day prior to the introduction of the quota, sometimes peaking to over 5,000 in one day. Visits to the structure&#x27;s roof were banned after restoration efforts were completed in 2006 to avoid further structural damage. Visitorship quotas were raised to 2,300 daily to accommodate a 30% increase in visitorship since the opening of the Qingzang railway into Lhasa on 1 July 2006, but the quota is often reached by mid-morning. Opening hours were extended during the peak period in the months of July to September, where over 6,000 visitors would descend on the site.

In February 2022, Tibetan pop star Tsewang Norbu set himself on fire in front of the Potala Palace and died. The Foreign Ministry of China has disputed this.

== Architecture ==

Built at an altitude of 3,700 m (12,100 ft), on the side of Ri Marpo (&#x27;Red Mountain&#x27;) in the centre of Lhasa Valley, the Potala Palace, with its vast inward-sloping walls broken only in the upper parts by straight rows of many windows, and its flat roofs at various levels, is not unlike a fortress in appearance. At the south base of the rock is a large space enclosed by walls and gates, with great porticos on the inner side. A series of tolerably easy staircases, broken by intervals of gentle ascent, leads to the summit of the rock. The whole width of this is occupied by the palace.

The central part of this group of buildings rises in a vast quadrangular mass above its satellites to a great height, terminating in gilt canopies similar to those on the Jokhang. This central member of Potala is called the &quot;red palace&quot; from its crimson colour, which distinguishes it from the rest. It contains the principal halls and chapels and shrines of past Dalai Lamas. There is in these much rich decorative painting, with jewelled work, carving and other ornamentation.

The lower white frontage on the south side of the palace was used to hoist two gigantic thangkas joined representing the figures of Tara and Sakyamuni during the Sertreng Festival on the 30th day of the second Tibetan month.

The Chinese Putuo Zongcheng Temple, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, built between 1767 and 1771, was in part modelled after the Potala Palace. The palace was named by the American television show &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and newspaper &quot;USA Today&quot; as one of the &quot;New Seven Wonders&quot;.

The nine-storey Leh Palace in Leh, Ladakh, India, built by King Sengge Namgyal (c. 1570–1642), was a precursor of the Potala Palace.

== The Lhasa Zhol Pillars ==

Lhasa Zhol Village has two stone pillars or &quot;rdo-rings&quot;, an interior stone pillar or &quot;doring nangma&quot;, which stands within the village fortification walls, and the exterior stone pillar or &quot;doring chima&quot;, which originally stood outside the South entrance to the village. Today the pillar stands neglected to the East of the Liberation Square, on the South side of Beijing Avenue.

The &quot;doring chima&quot; dates as far back as circa 764, &quot;or only a little later&quot;, and is inscribed with what may be the oldest known example of Tibetan writing.

The pillar contains dedications to a famous Tibetan general and gives an account of his services to the king including campaigns against China which culminated in the brief capture of the Chinese capital Chang&#x27;an (modern Xi&#x27;an) in 763 during which the Tibetans temporarily installed as Emperor a relative of Princess Jincheng Gongzhu (Kim-sheng Kong), the Chinese wife of Trisong Detsen&#x27;s father, Me Agtsom.

<text>143 Records was the record label of producer David Foster. 143 was a sub-label of Warner Records and Atlantic Records. The numbers 1-4-3 are derived from the words &quot;I (1 letter) love (4 letters) you (3 letters).&quot;

==History==
When record producer David Foster signed a deal with Warner Bros. in 1995, it enabled him to start 143 Records. Foster gave the responsibility for running the label to manager Brian Avnet. One of the label&#x27;s first signing was Irish folk-rock band the Corrs.

In 1997 Foster and Avnet concluded &quot;logo labels&quot; like 143 were in a &quot;bad spot&quot;. Foster sold the label back to Warner and then became senior vice-president at the corporation. On September 20, 2001, Warner Music Group announced it was shutting down the label.

<doc id="469932" wikidata="Q1471244" url="?curid=469932" title="Robin and the 7 Hoods">
<text>Robin and the 7 Hoods is a 1964 American musical film directed by Gordon Douglas and starring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and Bing Crosby. It features Peter Falk and Barbara Rush, with an uncredited cameo by Edward G. Robinson.

Written by David R. Schwartz, the film reimagines the Robin Hood legend in a 1920s Chicago gangster setting.

Produced by Frank Sinatra, the film introduced the hit song &quot;My Kind of Town&quot; by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn, which was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song and achieved a career of its own independent of the film.

==Plot==
&quot;Big&quot; Jim Stevens, undisputed boss of the Chicago underworld, gets an unexpected birthday present from his ambitious lieutenant, Guy Gisborne. Big Jim gets shot by all the guests at his birthday party, and Gisborne takes over. He orders all the other gangsters in town to pay him protection money, but declares it is still &quot;All for One&quot;. The news does not sit well with Big Jim&#x27;s friend and fellow gangster, Robbo, and a gangland war breaks out.

Robbo recruits pool hustler Little John, who demonstrates his billiards skills while singing &quot;Any Man Who Loves His Mother&quot;, plus quickdraw artist Will and a few others, but they are still greatly outnumbered. In addition, the corrupt Sheriff Octavius Glick is on Gisborne&#x27;s payroll. Gisborne and Robbo come up with the same idea, to destroy the other&#x27;s gambling joint on the same night, with Will enjoying every moment of shooting up Gisborne&#x27;s place (&quot;Bang! Bang!&quot;).

Big Jim&#x27;s refined, educated daughter, Marian, shows up. She asks Robbo to avenge her father&#x27;s death (wrongfully attributed to the sheriff), a request which Robbo flatly refuses. Gisborne disposes of the sheriff. Marian then invites Robbo to dinner and gives him $50,000, falsely assuming that Robbo did as she had asked. Robbo refuses the money, so Marian attempts to seduce him into joining forces to take over the whole town. Robbo turns her down. When she sends the money to his under-repair gambling club, Robbo donates it to a boys&#x27; orphanage.

Allen A. Dale, the orphanage&#x27;s director, notifies the newspapers about this good deed. A new Chicago star is born: a gangster who robs from the rich and gives to the poor. Robbo finds it useful to have the public on his side. He invites the delighted Dale to join his gang, having him handle all the charities. Dale starts the Robbo Foundation and opens a string of soup kitchens, free clinics and orphan shelters. He even gives green, feathered hats and bows and arrows to the orphans, while thoroughly milking the Robin Hood image. In the meantime, Robbo and Little John give tips to Dale on how to improve his own image (&quot;Style&quot;).

Robbo&#x27;s joint reopens and is an instant hit; while Gisborne, whose place is now empty, is infuriated. He and the new sheriff, Potts, organize a police raid. Robbo has anticipated this and when a few switches are pulled, the entire club is disguised as a mission. The sheriff and Gisborne burst in to find Robbo&#x27;s gang singing gospel songs and preaching the evils of alcohol, complete with hymnals and tambourines (&quot;Mr. Booze&quot;).

Robbo is framed for Glick&#x27;s murder. At the trial, Gisborne and Potts claim that Robbo planned the whole thing. Dale tries to teach the despondent orphans to view this as a lesson (&quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Do-Badder&quot;). The jury finds Robbo not guilty. Wearing a green suit, Robbo publicly thanks everyone in Chicago (&quot;My Kind of Town&quot;).

When he returns to his club, Robbo finds his charities are now a front for counterfeiting. The soup kitchen smuggles fake bills over state lines in soup cans. Robbo also finds Little John living it up in Marian&#x27;s mansion. Marian is willing to keep Robbo as a front, as long as &quot;she&quot; is in charge. Robbo shows his contempt for her and leaves, with Little John following him out the door.

Marian finds another willing partner in Gisborne, but the gangster is no match for Robbo and is killed. Robbo tells a shocked Marian to clear out of town.

She instead turns public opinion against him, starting a &quot;Women&#x27;s League for Better Government&quot; group and framing Robbo for the counterfeiting ring that she and Little John started, with Potts working as her new partner. Unable to fight a mob of angry women, Robbo and his gang flee. Robbo and his merry men are reduced to working as Santa Clauses to solicit charitable donations. They watch as Marian steps out of a car with her latest partner, Alan A. Dale, who casually gives the Santas money before going off with Marian. The trio shrug and walk down the street together ringing their bells.

==Cast==
Cast notes
*Peter Lawford was originally cast as Allen A. Dale, but was replaced with Bing Crosby following a falling out with Sinatra. The feud stemmed from a scheduled visit to Sinatra&#x27;s home by Lawford&#x27;s brother-in-law, President John F. Kennedy during a 1962 West Coast trip. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who was long concerned about Sinatra&#x27;s rumored ties with underworld figures, encouraged the President to change his plans and stay at Crosby&#x27;s home, which (it was maintained) could provide better security for the President. The change came at the last minute, after Sinatra made extensive arrangements for the promised and eagerly awaited presidential visit, including the construction of a helipad. Sinatra was furious, believing that Lawford had failed to intercede with the Kennedys on his behalf and ostracized him from the Rat Pack. Sinatra and Lawford never spoke again. Sinatra endorsed incumbent Democrat Pat Brown for his unsuccessful reelection as governor of California in 1966, then backed Vice-President Hubert Humphrey in his equally unsuccessful run for the presidency in 1968. These were the last two Democrats that Sinatra supported. Crosby, a staunch Republican, ended up cast in Lawford&#x27;s role.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an aggregate score of 40% based on 4 positive and 6 negative critic reviews. &quot;Variety&quot; commented: &quot;Warner Bros. has a solid money entry in &#x27;Robin and the Seven Hoods,&#x27; a spoof on gangster pix of bygone days sparked by the names of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Bing Crosby to give marquee power...Performance-wise, Falk comes out best. His comic gangster is a pure gem and he should get plenty of offers after this. Sinatra, of course, is smooth and Crosby in a &#x27;different&#x27; type of role rates a big hand. Martin seems lost in the shuffle. Davis is slick and Miss Rush, going heavy, is beautiful to look at.&quot;

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The minor musical whimsey that arrived at the Palace and other theaters yesterday under the just-too-cunning title of &#x27;Robin and the 7 Hoods&#x27; is almost as strained and archaic in the fable it has to tell of Prohibition-era gangsters in Chicago as the fable of Robin Hood it travesties. Dishing up Frank Sinatra as the leader of a mob that enhances its public image by giving large sums of money to charity, it runs through some all-too-familiar plot arrangements and farce routines that have a fleeting and far-away resemblance to some of the stuff in the old Damon Runyon tales.&quot;

Michael Thornton, writing in &quot;The Sunday Express&quot; had this to say as part of his review. &quot;I must confess I was yawning up to the moment Bing Crosby made his quiet and studious entrance as the unworldly secretary of a children&#x27;s orphanage. The years have not dealt lightly with Mr. Crosby. The tips of the famous toupee have receded still further back upon that time-honoured face. But after some moments of horrifying suspicion that he had been introduced as a mute stooge for the Sinatra Clan, the Old Master opened his mouth to sing again and to prove that his sweetness of tone remains unimpaired and undiminished for all his years of seniority.&quot;

The song &quot;My Kind of Town&quot; was nominated for the American Film Institute&#x27;s 2004 list AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs.

==Music==

Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen wrote the score. Crosby, still a major movie star at the time who had top billing over Sinatra in their last film together, &quot;High Society&quot;, sang more songs than Sinatra in this film as well.

&quot;My Kind of Town&quot; is the centerpiece number of the film. Orchestral versions of the song are the primary element of the opening and closing credits. A dance band also plays the song in Robbo&#x27;s speakeasy. Sinatra sings the song to the citizens outside the courthouse after his framing for and acquittal of murdering the sheriff.

==Production==
&quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot; was filmed from October to December 1963. It was a troubled production interrupted by both the assassination of John F. Kennedy, a personal former friend of Sinatra&#x27;s, and just weeks later, the kidnapping of Frank Sinatra Jr. Despite these difficulties, cast and crew ultimately decided to complete the film.

==Novelization==
A novelization by Jack Pearl was published by Pocket Books in 1964. The character of Marian features much more heavily in the book, including a scene in which she testifies against Robbo in court then has most of her clothes torn off by an angry mob outside the court room, and another in which she gives a lengthy speech about the nature of Robbo&#x27;s appeal to the masses.

==Stage musical==
A new version of &quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot;, with a book by Rupert Holmes, premiered on stage July 30, 2010 at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego, California. Updated to the early 1960s, it includes only one of the film&#x27;s songs, &quot;My Kind of Town&quot;, but features 18 others composed by Cahn and Van Heusen, among them &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Kick in the Head?.&quot; The piece ran throughout August 2010. Casey Nicholaw directed and choreographed the musical, set in the &quot;Mad Men&quot; era of 1962. The story is about a likable gangster hoping to get out of the crime business. A do-gooding TV reporter likens him to a modern-day Robin Hood.

==Home media==
&quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot; has been released on a number of home video editions, individually and as part of the deluxe multi-movie set &quot;The Rat Pack Ultimate Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;. Cases for DVD editions depicted a portrait of Sinatra, Martin, Davis Jr and Crosby with guns in their hands. Because Crosby&#x27;s character is not involved in the group&#x27;s criminal operations, the portrait was altered to show him gunless.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack album was rereleased on compact disc in 2000 on Artanis Records.

<text>The Comedy Store Players are a group of improvisational comedians who perform at The Comedy Store in London. The group first came into being in October 1985.

== The Players ==

Members of the group have included:

*Dave Cohen
*Jeremy Hardy
*Kit Hollerbach
*Josie Lawrence 
*Paul Merton
*Neil Mullarkey 
*Mike Myers
*Lee Simpson
*Andy Smart
*Jim Sweeney
*Sandi Toksvig
*Richard Vranch

Currently there are five regular cast members; Josie Lawrence, Neil Mullarkey, Lee Simpson, Richard Vranch and Ruth Bratt, who in 2024 became the first new permanent member of the Players in almost 30 years. Sweeney retired from performing in 2008 but is still listed as a member and is also the group&#x27;s President. Paul Merton ceased appearing as a full-time member in 2020 in order to concentrate on Paul Merton&#x27;s Impro Chums but makes occasional appearances as a guest performer. 

They are in the Guinness World Records for being the world’s longest-running comedy show with the same cast.

== Shows ==

The Players currently perform once a week on Sunday at The Comedy Store, but in recent times performed once each on Wednesdays and Sundays. 

Performances are usually with the regular cast, although occasionally a guest performer will appear. Guests have in the past included the likes of Niall Ashdown, Marcus Brigstocke, Stephen Frost, Eddie Izzard, Greg Proops, Steve Steen and Phill Jupitus. Shows start at 7.30pm on Sundays. They last approximately 2 hours (including interval), in which time they play 6 or 7 games. There is no one host of the show, and no points to be won; players rotate the introduction and performing duties.

Usually, the games are:
* Whoops - in which each performer takes turn to tell a story, with the audience shouting &quot;Whoops!&quot; when one makes a mistake. The game was formerly called &quot;Die!&quot;
* Freeze Tag - two performers start in positions suggested by the audience, and act out sketches. The other performers will &#x27;tag&#x27; someone to take their position and start a new sketch
* Guess The Job - A Player leaves the room while an outrageous job is concocted. When he re-enters, he/she has to guess the job based on clues dropped into the sketch
* Translation - Specialist lecture from a foreign expert who doesn&#x27;t speak English, so another Player translates for him
* Film &amp; Theatre Styles - A sketch between 2 people, performed in different film and theatre styles
* Musical - A story told with song, with the Players often playing several characters
* Emotions - Another sketch between 2 people, this time changing based on different emotions suggested by the audience
* The Three Headed Expert - An interview between one person and an expert (played by three people)

Aside from The Comedy Store in London, the Comedy Store Players perform annually at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe as well as other venues around the UK. From 2000 to 2003 they performed regularly at the Manchester Comedy Store and for many years appeared at Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre. They held national tours of the UK in 1990, 1991 and 2003, and toured India in 2004.

== Appearances ==

The Comedy Store Players performed improvised games in episodes of STV&#x27;s stand-up series Funny Farm (1990-1993). They also appeared on episode 4 of The Sitcom Trials - the line-up consisted of Neil Mullarkey, Suki Webster, Niall Ashdown and Richard Vranch.

Several of the Players appeared on the Channel 4 comedy game show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?.&quot; Lawrence, Merton, Simpson and Sweeney also starred in &quot;The Masterson Inheritance&quot;, an improvised comedy series which ran on BBC Radio 4 from 1993-1995.

<doc id="469939" wikidata="Q378614" url="?curid=469939" title="Bernardin Gantin">
<text>Bernardin Gantin (8 May 1922 – 13 May 2008) was a Beninese Catholic prelate who held senior positions in the Roman Curia for twenty years and the highest position in the College of Cardinals for nine years. His prominence in the hierarchy of the Church was unprecedented for an African and has been equaled by few non-Italians. 

He began his career in his native country first as an auxiliary bishop and then as Archbishop of Cotonou. In 1971, he began his thirty-year career in the Curia. After he had spent several years in the role of senior assistant, he held a series of senior positions as president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, president of the Pontifical Council &quot;Cor Unum&quot;, and prefect of the Sacred Congregation for Bishops.

Pope Paul VI made him a cardinal in 1977, Pope John Paul II promoted him to the rank of cardinal-bishop in 1986, and his peers elected him dean, the highest office in the College of Cardinals, in 1993. He retired and returned to Benin when he turned 80. His cause for canonization was opened after his death and he was declared a Servant of God by Pope Francis.

==Early career==
Bernadin Gantin was born in Toffo, French Dahomey (now Benin), on 8 May 1922. His name means &quot;tree of iron&quot; (&quot;gan&quot;, iron and &quot;tin&quot;, tree ). His father was a railway worker. He entered the minor seminary in Ouidah at age fourteen and was ordained to the priesthood on 14 January 1951 in Lomé, Togo, by Archbishop Louis Parisot of Cotonou. He then fulfilled pastoral assignments while also teaching languages at the seminary. In 1953 he was sent to Rome where he studied at the Pontifical Urban University and then at the Pontifical Lateran University, where he earned his licentiate in theology and canon law.

On 11 December 1956, Pope Pius XII appointed him titular bishop of Tipasa and auxiliary bishop of Cotonou. He received his episcopal consecration on 3 February 1957 from Cardinal Eugène Tisserant, Dean of the College of Cardinals. On 5 January 1960, Pope John XXIII appointed him Archbishop of Cotonou. As archbishop, he attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), where he first became friends with the future Pope John Paul II.

He was chairman of the West African Episcopal Conference.

==Roman curia==
Pope Paul VI appointed him to the Roman Curia and gave him a series of assignments, starring as adjunct secretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples in 1971 and secretary of that Congregation in 1973. On 19 December 1975 he was named Vice President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace and on 5 January 1976 Gantin received the additional responsibilities of the Vice President of the Pontifical Council &quot;Cor Unum&quot;, as Pope Paul was combining those two departments.

In 1976, Pope Paul appointed him head of the President of the Pontifical Commission for Justice and Peace, making him the first African to head a curial department. This commission was headed by a cardinal, so Gantin held the title &quot;Pro-President&quot; until Pope Paul made him a cardinal on 27 June 1977. He was made a member of the order of cardinal deacons and assigned the deaconry of Sacro Cuore di Cristo Re.

On 4 September 1978, he was named President of the Pontifical Council &quot;Cor Unum&quot; by Pope John Paul I, the only administrative appointment of his month-long papacy. Gantin met with John Paul I the day before he died.

He participated in the 1978 conclaves that elected Popes John Paul I and John Paul II. At the first of them he was reportedly one of three cardinals who counted the votes. During the second of these conclaves, Gantin was thought to be one of the &quot;papabili&quot;, those cardinals who are thought to have a chance of being elected pope.
In 1982, he accompanied Pope John Paul on his visit to Benin.

On 8 April 1984, Pope John Paul II appointed him prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, which supervises episcopal appointments in the non-missionary Latin Rite dioceses throughout the world. He was also made president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. On 25 June 1984, Gantin opted to become a member of the order of cardinal priests. For the next fourteen years he collaborated with Pope John Paul in shaping the hierarchy of the Church, both in making appointments and in managing the agendas for the periodic visits bishops make to consult with the pope and the Curia. On the pope&#x27;s behalf he managed appointments of conservative prelates in dioceses that did not welcome them in the Netherlands and Switzerland, removed an outspoken liberal French bishop, contended with Latin American advocates for the rights of indigenous peoples, and the excommunication of Marcel Lefebvre, with whom he had worked in Africa in the 1960s. Years later, John Paul referred to their years of &quot;regular contact and an almost unique familiarity&quot;.

==Cardinal bishop and dean==
On 29 September 1986, Pope John Paul appointed Gantin cardinal bishop of the suburbicarian diocese of Palestrina, one of six Latin-church members of the highest rank of cardinals, responsible for electing the dean and sub dean of the college who manage the conclave that elects the pope.

The six Latin-church cardinal bishops elect the dean and subdean, who takes his position when the pope consents to the election. On 5 June 1993, Gantin was elected and confirmed Dean of the College of Cardinals, which gave him the additional title cardinal bishop of Ostia. He was the first non-European to hold this office and remains the only one.

He ended his service as prefect of the Congregation for Bishops and President of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America on 25 June 1998. Less than a year later, in April 1999, he endorsed a views of Cardinal Vincenzo Fagiolo that bishops need to consider themselves married to their sees and expect their relationship to be lifelong. He said he had been shocked by overt expressions of &quot;careerism&quot; and &quot;social climbing&quot;. He suggested that bishops should be transferred &quot;to less developed, more difficult sees rather than to more comfortable and prestigious ones&quot;. He also said that there should be no connection between a see and a place in the College of Cardinals, offering Milan as an example.

On 29 November 2002, with the permission of Pope John Paul, he retired as Dean of the College of Cardinals and cardinal bishop of Ostia, which required he reside in Rome. Now eighty years old, he retired to Cotonou, which he had visited regularly throughout his years in Rome. He remained cardinal bishop of Palestrina. Two years into his retirement he described his situation: &quot;I left Rome in body but not in spirit. I am a Roman missionary in my country.&quot;

In retirement he spoke more freely than he had while under the obligations of office. In 2006 he criticized his contemporary bishops in Africa: &quot;If I have to make a complaint it would be this: if at one time the bishops moved little, today they travel too much. Sitting down, listening, praying with their own believers is more that ever necessary and urgent for them. Always keeping in mind what is set down in canon 395 of the Code of Canon Law on the obligation of residence in their diocese, they can also be an example to their own priests.&quot; He warned against allowing African priests to relocate permanently in Europe, to &quot;roam the dioceses of the Western world more in search of their own material comfort than out of genuine pastoral zeal&quot;. And he warned European religious orders against such personnel transfers: &quot;The European religious congregations on their last legs or threatened with extinction should not go seeking cheap reinvigoration among the young Churches in Asia or Africa.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Gantin died at Pompidou Hospital in Paris after a long illness on 13 May 2008, less than a week after being transferred there from Benin and five days after his 86th birthday. The Beninese government declared three days of mourning for him, beginning on 14 May.

Pope Benedict XVI visited his tomb in the chapel of the Seminary of Saint Gall in Ouidah on 19 November 2011.

In May 2013, Vatican officials inaugurated a chair named for him devoted to &quot;Socializing Policy in Africa&quot; at the Pontifical Lateran University.

The Cadjehoun Airport, Benin&#x27;s main international airport, was named in his honor.

==Cause of beatification and canonization==
On 30 January 2025, the Episcopal Conference of the Italian Region of Lazio, which includes the Diocese of Rome, has issued a favourable opinion for the opening of the cause for beatification of Gantin, the first African to lead the Dicastery for Bishops in the Vatican.

<text>John Bracken (22 June 1883 – 18 March 1969) was a Canadian agronomist and politician who was the 11th and longest-serving premier of Manitoba (1922–1943) and later the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada (1942–1948).

Bracken was born in Ontario, and was a professor of animal husbandry at the University of Saskatchewan before moving to Manitoba in 1920. A political outsider, he was named leader of the Progressive Party of Manitoba following its upset victory in the 1922 Manitoba general election. During his tenure as premier of Manitoba, he implemented policies dominated by rural interests and opposed organized labour. He oversaw the creation of a universal pension, the provincial income tax, and reductions in spending on health, education and welfare as well as the replacement of the first past the post voting system with alternative voting. He pursued development by promoting staple industries such as mining, timber and fishing. After leading the Progressive Party to a second consecutive majority in the 1927 election, he merged the Progressive Party with the Liberal Party of Manitoba to form the Liberal-Progressive Party in 1932. He led the Liberal-Progressive Party to consecutive victories in elections in 1932, 1936 and 1941, winning majority governments in all but the 1936 election.

In 1942, he agreed to run for the leadership of the federal Conservative Party of Canada at the condition that the party be renamed the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. After being elected leader of the newly renamed party, he resigned as premier of Manitoba and led the PCs to a second-place finish during the 1945 Canadian federal election against the incumbent Liberal Party government led by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. He resigned as leader of the party in 1948 and was succeeded by George A. Drew. After being defeated while running for reelection to the House of Commons in the 1949 federal election, he retired from politics and died in 1969.

==Early life==
Bracken was born in Ellisville, Ontario, the son of Ephriam Michael Bracken and Alberta Gilbert. He was raised on a large dairy farm and began managing it as a teenager. He and was educated at Brockville Collegiate Institute and the Ontario Agricultural College. He did a year of postgraduate work at the University of Illinois.

Not long after graduating from the Ontario Agricultural College, Bracken moved to Manitoba, where he worked for the Dominion Seed Branch. When Saskatchewan became a province in 1905, Bracken became its first inspector of institutes and fairs. He also spent two years as the province&#x27;s livestock commissioner. In 1909, he married Alice Wylie Bruce.

Bracken was chosen to be one of the first professors of the University of Saskatchewan&#x27;s agricultural college, which opened in 1910. He was head coach of the school&#x27;s football team in 1915 and 1917. In 1920, he moved to Winnipeg when he became president of the Manitoba Agricultural College.

==Premier of Manitoba==
In 1922, the United Farmers of Manitoba unexpectedly won the provincial election. The UFM&#x27;s expectations had been so low going into the election that they had not even named a leader and ran candidates in only two thirds of the seats.

With their upset victory, the UFM faced the task of naming a leader who would become the province&#x27;s new premier. After federal MPs Thomas Crerar and Robert Hoey turned down the UFM&#x27;s offer, they turned to Bracken, who accepted. His selection was a surprise, as he had never sought public office and had not been identified with the party prior to becoming its leader. He was sworn in as premier on August 8 and entered the legislature a few months later after winning a deferred election in the northern riding of The Pas.

Bracken was a political outsider and gave the UFM the professional grounding it needed. The United Farmers generally rejected the partisanship of the Liberal and Conservative parties and favoured government policies based on independence and principles of business management. The UFM governed as the Progressive Party of Manitoba, and Bracken served as Manitoba&#x27;s premier for over 20 years.

Bracken&#x27;s government was, in most respects, conservative and cautious. It was dominated by rural interests, who controlled the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. The first past the post voting system used in rural single-member districts was replaced by alternative voting during his government&#x27;s reign. Labour did not fare well under Bracken&#x27;s leadership; he had little sympathy for the leaders of the Winnipeg General Strike and once fired a number of government workers to show his independence from organized labour.

In the 1920s, Bracken oversaw an increase in taxation and created the provincial income tax. He lowered expenditures in health, education, and welfare but introduced a pension for all citizens over seventy years old in 1928. Under his administration, the province created a censorship board that regulated motion pictures. In 1923, Manitoba voted to end the prohibition of alcohol. The restrictive Liquor Control Act, passed that same year, sold liquor at provincially controlled outlets, resulting in the generation of a substantial new income.

Bracken worked to promote staple industries such as mining, timber cutting, and fishing, while also promoting hydroelectric power. He successfully had the Hudson Bay Railway create a branch line to Flin Flon, resulting in the opening of a copper and zinc mine there in 1926. Bracken was a vocal proponent of the provincial control of natural resources and influenced Mackenzie King&#x27;s 1930 decision to give Manitoba, Alberta, and Saskatchewan control over crown lands.

In keeping with the UFM&#x27;s &quot;anti-party&quot; philosophy, Bracken favoured non-partisan government. In 1931, his Progressives formed an alliance with the Manitoba Liberal Party, and the two parties eventually merged into one. In 1940, Bracken formed a wartime coalition government that included the Conservative, Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and Social Credit parties.
When Bracken left provincial politics in 1943, there were only 5 opposition Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) in a 57-member parliament. His coalition remained intact until 1950 although the CCF left in 1943.

==Federal politics==

Despite having co-operated with the Liberals at the provincial level, Bracken was asked by a number of senior federal Conservatives (including Arthur Meighen) to take over the leadership of the weak national Conservative Party in 1942. He agreed to seek the party&#x27;s leadership on the condition that it change its name to the Progressive Conservative Party. He was elected leader at the party&#x27;s 1942 leadership convention. Bracken stepped down as Manitoba premier shortly thereafter, and was succeeded by Stuart S. Garson.

Bracken did not seek a seat in the House of Commons until the 1945 Canadian election. While Bracken won the rural seat of Neepawa, the Tories were defeated nationally. The Tories picked up 29 seats, but were still well behind the governing Liberals; most of the seats that they did pick up were in Ontario, which was credited more to the popular provincial government of George A. Drew than Bracken&#x27;s leadership of the national party. Bracken became Leader of the Opposition and remained leader of the Tories until he was pushed to resign in favour of Drew in 1948.

It has been argued, with some credibility, that Bracken never succeeded in impressing his personal authority over the national PC organization. As a western populist, he was distrusted by the party&#x27;s eastern establishment. There are reports that some senior Tories wanted him removed as leader as early as 1944. More importantly, during the 1945 election, Bracken had promised conscription for the planned invasion of Japan. The Liberal Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, by contrast had promised that one division of volunteers would take part in the invasion of Japan. Operation Downfall, the code-name for the invasion of Japan, was widely expected to be bloody campaign as the Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa were the &quot;dress rehearsals&quot; for the invasion of the Japanese home islands. Canadian public opinion was not keen on conscription for what was expected to be a campaign that would last several years.

Bracken&#x27;s riding was merged into the seat of Brandon before the 1949 federal election. He was soundly defeated by Liberal incumbent James Matthews, and did not return to political life thereafter. Though his leadership of the Tories was generally viewed as a failure, he would gain some small degree of vindication in his later years as his western populist policies would be employed more successfully by John Diefenbaker, who succeeded Drew as leader in 1956, gaining the party a power base in the western provinces that would reliably support them from the late 1950s until their fall as a party of government in 1993.

Bracken died on March 18, 1969, and is buried in Rideauvale Cemetery at Kars, Ontario.

<text>Muslims (Serbo-Croatian Latin and , Serbo-Croatian Cyrillic and ) is a designation for the ethnoreligious group of Serbo-Croatian-speaking Muslims of Slavic heritage, inhabiting mostly the territory of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The term, adopted in the 1971 Constitution of Yugoslavia, groups together several distinct South Slavic communities of Islamic ethnocultural tradition. Before 1993, a vast majority of present-day Bosniaks self-identified as ethnic Muslims, along with some smaller groups of different ethnicities, such as Gorani and &quot;Torbeši&quot;. This designation did not include non-Slavic Yugoslav Muslims, such as Albanians, Turks and some Romani people.
After the breakup of Yugoslavia, a majority of the Slavic Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted the Bosniak ethnic designation, and they are today constitutionally recognized as one of three constituent nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Approximately 100,000 people across the rest of the former Yugoslavia consider themselves to be Slavic Muslims, mostly in Serbia. They are constitutionally recognized as a distinct ethnic minority in Montenegro.

== History ==

The Ottoman conquests led to many autochthonous inhabitants converting to Islam. However, nationalist ideologies appeared among South Slavs as early as the 19th century, as with the First and Second Serbian Uprising and the Illyrian movement, national identification was a foreign concept to the general population, which primarily identified itself by denomination and province. The emergence of modern nation-states forced the ethnically and religiously diverse Ottoman Empire to modernise, resulting in several reforms. The most significant of these were the Edict of Gülhane of 1839 and Imperial Reform Edict of 1856. These gave non-Muslim subjects of the Empire equal status and strengthened their autonomous Millet communities.

There was a strong rivalry between South Slavic nationalisms. Vuk Karadžić, then the leading representative of Serbian nationalism, considered all speakers of the Štokavian dialect, regardless of religious affiliation, to be Serbs. Josip Juraj Strossmayer, the Croatian Catholic bishop and his People&#x27;s Party advocated the idea of South Slavic unity, while Ante Starčević and his Party of Rights sought to restore the Croatian state based on the so-called historical right, considering Bosnian Muslims as Croats. In both Croatian and Serbian national ideology, the territory of the Bosnia vilayet was of great importance because both wanted to incorporate it into their future national states. From their point of view, Bosnian Muslims were Croats or Serbs who converted to Islam. In 1870, Bosnian Muslims made up 42.5 per cent of the population of the Bosnia Vilayet, while Orthodox were 41.7 and Catholics 14.5 per cent. Which national state would get the territory of the Bosnia vilayet thus depended on who the Bosnian Muslims would favour, the Croats or the Serbs.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina at that time, the population did not identify with national categories, except for a few intellectuals from urban areas who claimed to be Croats or Serbs. The population of Bosnia and Herzegovina primarily identified itself by religion, using the terms Turk (for Muslims), &quot;Hrišćani&quot; (Christians) or Greeks (for the Orthodox) and &quot;Kršćani&quot; or Latins (for the Catholics). Furthermore, the Bosna vilayet particularly resisted the reforms, which culminated with the rebellion of Husein Gradaščević and his ayans in 1831. Reforms were introduced in Bosnia and Herzegovina only after Omer Pasha Latas forcibly returned the province to the sultan&#x27;s authority in 1850. The reforms marked the loss of the influence of the &quot;ulama&quot; (the educated clergy), Sharia was no longer used outside of family matters, and a system of public education was introduced, in addition to religious education. The reforms marked the beginning of journalism and the establishment of modern political institutions, and ultimately the establishment of a provincial assembly in 1865, in which non-Muslims also sat.

The revolt of the Bosnian ayans and the attempted formulation of provincial identity in the 1860s are often portrayed as the first signs of a Bosnian national identity. However, Bosnian national identity beyond confessional borders was rare, and the strong Bosnian identity of individual ayans or Franciscans expressed at that time was a reflection of regional affiliation, with a strong religious aspect. Christians identified more with the Croatian or Serbian nation. For Muslims, identity was more related to the defence of local privileges, but it did not call into question the allegiance to the Ottoman Empire. The use of the term &quot;Bosniak&quot; at that time did not have a national meaning, but a regional one. When Austria-Hungary occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, national identification was still a foreign concept to Bosnian Muslims.

After World War II, in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Bosnian Muslims continued to be treated as a religious group instead of an ethnic one. Aleksandar Ranković and other Serb communist members opposed the recognition of Bosniak nationality. Muslim members of the communist party continued in their efforts to get Tito to support their position for recognition. Nevertheless, in a debate that went on during the 1960s, many Bosnian Muslim communist intellectuals argued that the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina are a distinct native Slavic people that should be recognized as a nation. In 1964, the Fourth Congress of the Bosnian branch of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia assured their Bosnian Muslim membership the Bosnian Muslims&#x27; right to self-determination will be fulfilled, thus prompting the recognition of Bosnian Muslims as a distinct nation at a meeting of the Bosnian Central Committee in 1968, however not under the Bosniak or Bosnian name, as opted by the Bosnian Muslim communist leadership. As a compromise, the Constitution of Yugoslavia was amended to list &quot;Muslims&quot; in a national sense; recognizing a constitutive nation, but not the Bosniak name. The use of &quot;Muslim&quot; as an ethnic denomination was criticized early on, especially on account of motives and reasoning, as well as disregard of this aspect of Bosnian nationhood. Following the downfall of Ranković, Tito also changed his view and stated that recognition of Muslims and their national identity should occur. In 1968 the move was protested in the Serbia and by Serb nationalists such as Dobrica Ćosić. The change was opposed by the Macedonian branch of the Yugoslav Communist Party. They viewed Macedonian speaking Muslims as Macedonians and were concerned that statewide recognition of Muslims as a distinct nation could threaten the demographic balance of the Macedonian republic.

During the Intra-Bosnian Muslim War (1993–95) the forces loyal to the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia retained their Muslim name, while those loyal to the central government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina adhered to the Bosniak term, adopted during the Bosnian war in 1993.

Sometimes other terms, such as &quot;Muslim with capital M&quot; were used, that is, &quot;musliman&quot; was a practising Muslim while &quot;Musliman&quot; was a member of this nation (Serbo-Croatian uses capital letters for names of peoples but small for names of adherents).

The election law of Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, recognizes the results from 1991 population census as results referring to Bosniaks.

==Population==

* In Serbia, according to the 2011 census there were 22,301 &quot;Muslims by nationality&quot;, 145,278 Bosniaks as well as few Serb Muslims (ethnic Serbs who are Muslims (adherents of Islam) by their religious affiliation).
* In Montenegro census of 2011, 20,537 (3.3%) of the population declared as &quot;Muslims by nationality&quot;; while 53,605 (8.6%) declared as Bosniaks; while 175 (0.03%) &quot;Muslims by confession&quot; declared as Montenegrin Muslims. Muslims and Bosniaks are considered as a two separate ethnic groups, and both of them have their own separate National Councils. Also, many Muslims consider themselves as Montenegrins of the Islamic faith. National Council of Muslims of Montenegro insists their mother tongue is Montenegrin.
* In 2002 Slovenia census, 21,542 persons identified as Bosniaks (thereof 19,923 Bosniak Muslims); 8,062 as &quot;Bosnians&quot; (thereof 5,724 Bosnian Muslims), 2,804 were Slovenian Muslims. while 9,328 chose &quot;Muslims by nationality&quot;.
* In North Macedonia, the census of 2021 registered 16,042 (0,87%) Bosniaks and 1,187 (0.13%) &quot;Muslims by ethnicity&quot;. There are also 455 identified as Macedonian Muslims, separate of the 4,178 Torbeši, a minority religious group within the community of ethnic Macedonians who are &quot;Muslims by religious affiliation&quot;. It is also important to note that most Torbeši were declared as &quot;Muslims by nationality&quot; before 1990.
* In Croatia, according to the census of 2011 there were 6,704 &quot;Muslims by nationality&quot;, 27,959 Bosniak Muslims, 9,594 Albanian Muslims, 9,647 Croat Muslims and 5,039 Muslim Roma. The Bosniaks of Croatia are the largest minority practicing Islam in Croatia.

<text>In mathematics and theoretical physics, a superalgebra is a Z2-graded algebra. That is, it is an algebra over a commutative ring or field with a decomposition into &quot;even&quot; and &quot;odd&quot; pieces and a multiplication operator that respects the grading.

The prefix &quot;super-&quot; comes from the theory of supersymmetry in theoretical physics. Superalgebras and their representations, supermodules, provide an algebraic framework for formulating supersymmetry. The study of such objects is sometimes called super linear algebra. Superalgebras also play an important role in related field of supergeometry where they enter into the definitions of graded manifolds, supermanifolds and superschemes.

==Formal definition==

Let &quot;K&quot; be a commutative ring. In most applications, &quot;K&quot; is a field of characteristic 0, such as R or C.

A superalgebra over &quot;K&quot; is a &quot;K&quot;-module &quot;A&quot; with a direct sum decomposition
:formula_1
together with a bilinear multiplication &quot;A&quot; × &quot;A&quot; → &quot;A&quot; such that
:formula_2
where the subscripts are read modulo 2, i.e. they are thought of as elements of Z2.

A superring, or Z2-graded ring, is a superalgebra over the ring of integers Z.

The elements of each of the &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; are said to be homogeneous. The parity of a homogeneous element &quot;x&quot;, denoted by , is 0 or 1 according to whether it is in &quot;A&quot;0 or &quot;A&quot;1. Elements of parity 0 are said to be even and those of parity 1 to be odd. If &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are both homogeneous then so is the product &quot;xy&quot; and formula_3.

An associative superalgebra is one whose multiplication is associative and a unital superalgebra is one with a multiplicative identity element. The identity element in a unital superalgebra is necessarily even. Unless otherwise specified, all superalgebras in this article are assumed to be associative and unital.

A commutative superalgebra (or supercommutative algebra) is one which satisfies a graded version of commutativity. Specifically, &quot;A&quot; is commutative if

:formula_4

for all homogeneous elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; of &quot;A&quot;. There are superalgebras that are commutative in the ordinary sense, but not in the superalgebra sense. For this reason, commutative superalgebras are often called &quot;supercommutative&quot; in order to avoid confusion.

==Sign conventions==
When the Z2 grading arises as a &quot;rollup&quot; of a Z- or N-graded algebra into even and odd components, then two distinct (but essentially equivalent) sign conventions can be found in the literature. These can be called the &quot;cohomological sign convention&quot; and the &quot;super sign convention&quot;. They differ in how the antipode (exchange of two elements) behaves. In the first case, one has an exchange map
:formula_5
where formula_6 is the degree (Z- or N-grading) of formula_7 and formula_8 the parity. Likewise, formula_9 is the degree of formula_10 and with parity formula_11 This convention is commonly seen in conventional mathematical settings, such as differential geometry and differential topology. The other convention is to take 
:formula_12
with the parities given as formula_13 and formula_14 the parity. This is more often seen in physics texts, and requires a parity functor to be judiciously employed to track isomorphisms. Detailed arguments are provided by Pierre Deligne

==Examples==
*Any algebra over a commutative ring &quot;K&quot; may be regarded as a purely even superalgebra over &quot;K&quot;; that is, by taking &quot;A&quot;1 to be trivial.
*Any Z- or N-graded algebra may be regarded as superalgebra by reading the grading modulo 2. This includes examples such as tensor algebras and polynomial rings over &quot;K&quot;.
*In particular, any exterior algebra over &quot;K&quot; is a superalgebra. The exterior algebra is the standard example of a supercommutative algebra.
*The symmetric polynomials and alternating polynomials together form a superalgebra, being the even and odd parts, respectively. Note that this is a different grading from the grading by degree.
*Clifford algebras are superalgebras. They are generally noncommutative.
*The set of all endomorphisms (denoted formula_15, where the boldface formula_16 is referred to as &quot;internal&quot; formula_16, composed of &quot;all&quot; linear maps) of a super vector space forms a superalgebra under composition.
*The set of all square supermatrices with entries in &quot;K&quot; forms a superalgebra denoted by &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot;|&quot;q&quot;(&quot;K&quot;). This algebra may be identified with the algebra of endomorphisms of a free supermodule over &quot;K&quot; of rank &quot;p&quot;|&quot;q&quot; and is the internal Hom of above for this space.
*Lie superalgebras are a graded analog of Lie algebras. Lie superalgebras are nonunital and nonassociative; however, one may construct the analog of a universal enveloping algebra of a Lie superalgebra which is a unital, associative superalgebra.

==Further definitions and constructions==

===Even subalgebra===

Let &quot;A&quot; be a superalgebra over a commutative ring &quot;K&quot;. The submodule &quot;A&quot;0, consisting of all even elements, is closed under multiplication and contains the identity of &quot;A&quot; and therefore forms a subalgebra of &quot;A&quot;, naturally called the even subalgebra. It forms an ordinary algebra over &quot;K&quot;.

The set of all odd elements &quot;A&quot;1 is an &quot;A&quot;0-bimodule whose scalar multiplication is just multiplication in &quot;A&quot;. The product in &quot;A&quot; equips &quot;A&quot;1 with a bilinear form
:formula_18
such that
:formula_19
for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; in &quot;A&quot;1. This follows from the associativity of the product in &quot;A&quot;.

===Grade involution===

There is a canonical involutive automorphism on any superalgebra called the grade involution. It is given on homogeneous elements by
:formula_20
and on arbitrary elements by
:formula_21
where &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; are the homogeneous parts of &quot;x&quot;. If &quot;A&quot; has no 2-torsion (in particular, if 2 is invertible) then the grade involution can be used to distinguish the even and odd parts of &quot;A&quot;:
:formula_22

===Supercommutativity===

The supercommutator on &quot;A&quot; is the binary operator given by
:formula_23
on homogeneous elements, extended to all of &quot;A&quot; by linearity. Elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; of &quot;A&quot; are said to supercommute if .

The supercenter of &quot;A&quot; is the set of all elements of &quot;A&quot; which supercommute with all elements of &quot;A&quot;:
:formula_24
The supercenter of &quot;A&quot; is, in general, different than the center of &quot;A&quot; as an ungraded algebra. A commutative superalgebra is one whose supercenter is all of &quot;A&quot;.

===Super tensor product===

The graded tensor product of two superalgebras &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; may be regarded as a superalgebra &quot;A&quot; ⊗ &quot;B&quot; with a multiplication rule determined by:
:formula_25
If either &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; is purely even, this is equivalent to the ordinary ungraded tensor product (except that the result is graded). However, in general, the super tensor product is distinct from the tensor product of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; regarded as ordinary, ungraded algebras.

==Generalizations and categorical definition==

One can easily generalize the definition of superalgebras to include superalgebras over a commutative superring. The definition given above is then a specialization to the case where the base ring is purely even.

Let &quot;R&quot; be a commutative superring. A superalgebra over &quot;R&quot; is a &quot;R&quot;-supermodule &quot;A&quot; with a &quot;R&quot;-bilinear multiplication &quot;A&quot; × &quot;A&quot; → &quot;A&quot; that respects the grading. Bilinearity here means that
:formula_26
for all homogeneous elements &quot;r&quot; ∈ &quot;R&quot; and &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;A&quot;.

Equivalently, one may define a superalgebra over &quot;R&quot; as a superring &quot;A&quot; together with an superring homomorphism &quot;R&quot; → &quot;A&quot; whose image lies in the supercenter of &quot;A&quot;.

One may also define superalgebras categorically. The category of all &quot;R&quot;-supermodules forms a monoidal category under the super tensor product with &quot;R&quot; serving as the unit object. An associative, unital superalgebra over &quot;R&quot; can then be defined as a monoid in the category of &quot;R&quot;-supermodules. That is, a superalgebra is an &quot;R&quot;-supermodule &quot;A&quot; with two (even) morphisms
:formula_27
for which the usual diagrams commute.

<text>In computers, a printer driver or a print processor is a piece of software on a computer that converts the data to be printed to a format that a printer can understand. The purpose of printer drivers is to allow applications to do printing without being aware of the technical details of each printer model.

Printer drivers should not be confused with print spoolers, which queue print jobs and send them successively to a printer.

== Printer drivers in different operating systems ==

=== Unix and Unix-like ===
Unix and other Unix-like systems such as Linux and OS X use CUPS (short for Common Unix Printing System), a modular printing system for Unix-like computer operating systems, which allows a computer to act as a print server. A computer running CUPS is a host that can accept print jobs from client computers, process them, and send them to the appropriate printer. Printer drivers are typically implemented as filters. They are usually named the &quot;front end&quot; of the printing system, while the printer spoolers constitute the &quot;back end&quot;.

Backends are also used to determine the available devices. On startup, each backend is asked for a list of devices it supports, and any information that is available.

=== DOS === 
DOS supports predefined character devices codice_1, codice_2, codice_3 and codice_4 associated with parallel printers supported in the system. Similarly, serial printers can be used with codice_1, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8 and codice_9.

Users can use commands like, for example, &quot;codice_10&quot; to print the content of a file to a printer. The contents is transferred to the printer without any interpretation. Therefore, this method of printing is either for files already stored in the corresponding printer&#x27;s language or for generic text files without more than simple line-oriented formatting.

DOS also provides a dynamically loadable print spooler named PRINT as well as optional support to support screen captures also in graphics mode through GRAPHICS. If the optional character device driver PRINTER.SYS is loaded, DOS provides its code page switching support also for the associated printers—different types of dot matrix and ink jet printers are supported by default.

Beyond this, there are no system-wide printer-specific drivers for use at application level under MS-DOS/PC DOS. Under DR-DOS, however, the SCRIPT command can be loaded to run in the background in order to intercept and convert printer output from applications into PostScript to support PS-capable printers also by applications not supporting them directly.

In order to support more complex printing for different models of printers, each application (e.g. a word processor) may be shipped with its own printer drivers, which were essentially descriptions of printer escape sequences. Printers, too, have been supplied with drivers for the most popular applications. In addition, it&#x27;s possible for applications to include tools for editing printer description, in case there was no ready driver. In the days when DOS was widely used, many printers had emulation modes for Epson FX-80 and IBM Proprinter commands. Many more recent laser printers also have emulation modes for HP PCL (HP LaserJet) or PostScript printers which will work in DOS. It appears that these are also compatible with Windows 3.x.

=== Windows ===
On Microsoft Windows systems, printer drivers make use of GDI (Unidrv or PScript-based) or XPS (XPSDrv). Programs then use the same standard APIs to draw text and pictures both on screen and on paper. Printers which use GDI natively are commonly referred to as Winprinters and are considered incompatible with other operating systems, although there is software (such as PrintFil) which will make these printers work in a DOS prompt within Windows.

Win32 APIs also allow applications to send data directly to the spooler, bypassing the printer driver; however, few applications actually use this option.

The printer driver is usually located on the C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository folder on a Windows machine.

=== Amiga ===
The original AmigaOS up to 1.3 supported printers through a standard series of drivers stored at the required path &quot;DEVS:Printers&quot;. All printer drivers were stored in that directory, and covered the standard printers in 1985-1989 circa, included Epson FX standard driver, Xerox 4020, HP, etcetera.

Any Amiga printer driver had to communicate though the standard Amiga printer.device (the default standard hardware device of Amiga dealing with printers), and the standard parallel.device (which controlled parallel port) and the driver would then control the printer on its own.

Amiga printer drivers were an innovation for their time. They spared users from individually configuring each of their applications. They had the ability to print up to 4096 colors.

Through the use of the Printer Preferences program printers could be connected to the serial port as well.

Amiga also had support for a virtual device &quot;PRT:&quot; to refer to printer.device so, for example the command &quot;COPY file TO PRT:&quot; caused the file to be printed directly bypassing parallel.device and the default printer driver. 
Amiga used ANSI escape codes, not the special ones defined by the various printer manufacturers. This way every application on the Amiga could use the same standard set of control sequences and wouldn&#x27;t need to know which printer is actually connected. The printer driver then translated these standard sequences into the special sequences a certain printer understands.

Amiga internal function &quot;PWrite&quot; of printer.device writes &#x27;length&#x27; bytes directly to the printer. This function is generally called on by printer drivers to send their buffer(s) to the printer. Number of buffers are decided by the persons who created the driver. Amiga lacked a standard Printer Spooler.

Since AmigaOS 2.0 a standard printer.device was changed to control various printers at same time. The Printer preferences were divided in three main panels: &quot;Prefs:Printer&quot; which selects main printer and other basic elements such as &quot;Print Spacing&quot; and &quot;Paper Size&quot;. &quot;PrinterGFX&quot; controlled features like Dithering and Scaling. &quot;PrinterPS&quot; controlled Postscript Printers. The printer drivers surprisingly remained almost same of Workbench 1.3, with 4096 limits.

This fact led Amiga users to prefer third party Printer Systems with their own drivers, like TurboPrint and PrintStudio, which introduced not only recent drivers, but also featured a functioning Printer Spooler into Amiga, and featured 16 million colors printing. MorphOS uses a special version of TurboPrint to pilot recent printers.

Many Amiga programs like DTP programs as PageStream featured in the past its own printer drivers.

USB printers are automatically recognized by the Poseidon USB Stack. This stack is capable of detecting any USB device by its class, but printers still require a driver to be controlled.

== Types of drivers ==

In addition to being install-able on a computer, drivers could also be present in the embedded firmware of printers and made available through a networking protocol (e.g. IPP). The embedded firmware of a printer could thus eliminate the need to install any driver on a computer, by accepting print data in a general purpose format (e.g. PDF) via a networking protocol. Despite some efforts to standardize various stages of the printing pipeline, printer interfaces are largely still very proprietary and manufacturer-specific. Hence, nature of functions performed by drivers can vary. Nonetheless, based on the function performed, drivers can be classified as follows.

=== Device-independent converters ===

These drivers can convert print data from one general purpose format (e.g. PDF, DVI etc) to another general purpose format (e.g. PS). Examples include Ghostscript, etc.

=== Converters to device-specific format ===

These drivers convert print data from one format (e.g. PS) to a final device-specific format that the printer hardware can process and create a print. These drivers act as the last stage in delivering a print job to the printer. These drivers are more likely to be embedded in printer firmware.

Examples of manufacturer specific formats include:

* Printer Command Language (PCL) (Hewlett-Packard)
* PostScript (PS) (Adobe)
* Ink Jet Printer Data Stream (Kodak)
* Samsung Printer Language
* Ultra Fast Rendering (Canon)

== Packaging formats ==

Install-able drivers can be packaged in various formats. PPD is a popular packaging format for drivers that accept Postscript data or PDF data as input. Due to dominance of select operating systems, the operating system–driver interface is more standardized than driver–printer interfaces. Hence there is more standardization in packaging formats of drivers than the actual functions performed by drivers.

* PostScript Printer Description file Usually the operating system needs to know the characteristics of a printer. The PPD files are the normal way to supply this information. They have the advantage of being system independent, and there is a freely available large database of them, Foomatic.

* CUPS filter This format is used by CUPS on Linux systems.

<doc id="469954" wikidata="Q7663689" url="?curid=469954" title="System V printing system">
<text>The printing subsystem of UNIX System V is one of several standardized systems for printing on Unix, and is typical of commercial System V-based Unix versions such as Solaris and SCO OpenServer. A system running this print architecture could traditionally be identified by the use of the user command as the primary interface to the print system, as opposed to the BSD  command (though some systems provide as an alias to ).

Typical user commands available to the System V printing system are:

*: the user command to print a document
*: shows the current print queue
*: deletes a job from the print queue
*: a system administration command that configures the print system
*: a system administration command that moves jobs between print queues

==History==
In the Unix programming model, device files are special files that act as access points to peripheral devices such as printers. For example, the first line printer on a Unix system might be represented by a file in the device () directory, &quot;i.e.&quot;, . Using the file metaphor, a document could by printed by &quot;copying&quot; the file onto the device: . While this worked well enough for the case where there was one printer per user, this model did not scale out well to multiple users having to share one printer. The solution was to create a queue (or &quot;spool&quot;) of documents to be printed and use a daemon (system process) to manage this queue and send the documents to the printer in the order in which they arrived.

Such a system, with an command to send documents to the queue, was first introduced in 1973 in Version 4 of Unix. By the release of System V Release 4, the suite of utilities had grown to include commands for canceling print jobs, moving jobs among queues, enabling and disabling queues, enabling and disabling a job scheduler daemon, and status reports of the print system. The command handled queue documents to be printed and had over 20 different options that controlled the appearance of the document and its place in the queue, and even handled email notification of the user once the document had finished printing. The command returned a &quot;job id&quot; which could be used by the &quot;cancel&quot; or &quot;lpstat&quot; commands to remove the job from the queue or check on its progress, respectively. While the system was considered to be quite complex to set up and administer, most uses were expected to only use these three commands.

With its distribution in the influential AT&amp;T Unix System V, the interface if not the implementation became the standard for users&#x27; control over printers. The command was included as a requirement in the POSIX.2 standard, and a command by that name appeared in the subsequent lpr, LPRng and CUPS printing systems. (In SVR4 derivates like SCO UNIX, the command was simply an alias for the command used by the BSD-based system.)

As late as 1996, &quot;Running Linux&quot; stated &quot;The Linux printing software consists of the UNIX standard &quot;lp&quot; and &quot;lpr&quot; software,&quot; but by 1999 support for &quot;lp&quot; was waning and the third edition simply stated &quot;The &quot;lpr&quot; command prints a document on Linux.&quot; By 2003, a survey of the Debian, Mandrake, Red Hat, Slackware and SuSE distributions showed that all of them were running some combination of lpr, LPRng and CUPS.

The original System V printing system remains proprietary; however, the Solaris print system, heavily modified from the original, has been released as open source software as part of the OpenSolaris project. The Common Unix Printing System emulates both System V and Berkeley print architectures on the interface level, though its internal architecture is different from both.

==Criticism==
In his introduction to a simplified configuration system for lp, author Peter Gray of the University of Wollongong described several weaknesses of the version shipping with the then-current Solaris (operating system) version 2.

*As opposed to the single daemon used by the simpler BSD lpr system, the lp system used separate daemons, one for scheduling and one for remote communication.
*The lpr system could be controlled with a single configuration file while lp requires a separate program for administration.
*The lp system did support permissions, but the model did not scale to hundreds of users.

As a result, Gray observed that &quot;many administrators choose to simply run the old lpr/lpd system on the SVR4 boxes.&quot;

<doc id="469965" wikidata="Q423541" url="?curid=469965" title="U. G. Krishnamurti">
<text>Uppaluri Gopala Krishnamurti (9 July 1918 – 22 March 2007) was a philosopher and orator who questioned the state of spiritual liberation. Having pursued a religious path in his youth and eventually rejecting it, U.G. claimed to have experienced a devastating biological transformation on his 49th birthday, an event he refers to as &quot;the calamity&quot;. He emphasized that this transformation back to &quot;the natural state&quot; is a rare, acausal, biological occurrence with no religious context. Because of this, he discouraged people from pursuing the &quot;natural state&quot; as a spiritual goal.

He rejected the basis of thought and in doing so negated all systems of thought and knowledge. Hence he explained his assertions were experiential and not speculative – &quot;Tell them that there is &quot;nothing&quot; to understand.&quot;

He was unrelated to his contemporary Jiddu Krishnamurti, although the two men had a number of meetings because of their association with the Theosophical Society and U.G. has, at times, referred to him as &quot;[his] teacher&quot; in spite of having ultimately rejected said teachings as well as the idea that anything could or should be taught in any spiritual context.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
U.G. was born on 9 July 1918 in Machilipatnam, a town in coastal Andhra Pradesh, India, and raised in the nearby town of Gudivada. His mother died seven days after he was born, and he was brought up by his maternal grandfather, a wealthy Brahmin lawyer, who was also involved in the Theosophical Society. U.G. also became a member of the Theosophical Society during his teenage years and mentions having &quot;inherited&quot; his association with the Theosophical Society from his grandfather. South Indian actresses Gautami and Soumya Bollapragada are his very close relatives.

During the same period of his life, U.G. reportedly practised various austerities and sought &quot;moksha&quot; or liberation. To that end, between the ages of 14 and 21, he undertook a variety of spiritual exercises, determined to find out whether moksha was possible. Wanting to achieve that state, he had also resolved to prove that if there were people who have thus &quot;realized&quot; themselves, they could not be hypocritical. As part of this endeavour, he searched for a person who was an embodiment of such &quot;realization&quot;.

He spent seven summers in the Himalayas with Swami Sivananda studying yoga and practising meditation. During his 20s, U.G. began attending the University of Madras, studying psychology, philosophy, mysticism, and the sciences. He dropped out of the Master&#x27;s program with the idea that the answers of the West – to what he considered were essential questions – were no better than those of the East.

=== Quest ===
In 1939, at age 21, U.G. met with known spiritual teacher Ramana Maharshi. U.G. related that he asked Ramana, &quot;This thing called moksha, can you give it to me?&quot; – to which Ramana Maharshi replied, &quot;I can give it, but can you take it?&quot;. This answer completely altered U.G.&#x27;s perceptions of the &quot;spiritual path&quot; and its practitioners. Later, U.G. would say that Maharshi&#x27;s answer – which he perceived as &quot;arrogant&quot; – put him &quot;back on track&quot;.

In 1941, he began working for the Theosophical Society, in C.W. Leadbeater&#x27;s library. Shortly after, he began an international lecture tour on behalf of the Society, visiting Norway, Belgium, Germany and the United States. Returning to India, he married a Brahmin woman named Kusuma Kumari in 1943, at age 25.

From 1947 to 1953, U.G. regularly attended talks given by Jiddu Krishnamurti in Madras, India, beginning a direct dialogue with him in 1953. U.G. related that the two had almost daily discussions for a while, which he asserted were not providing satisfactory answers to his questions. Finally, their meetings came to a halt. He described part of the final discussion:

After the break-up with Jiddu Krishnamurti, U.G. continued travelling, still lecturing. At about the same time he claims to have been &quot;puzzled&quot; by the continuing appearance of certain psychic powers. In 1955, U.G. and his family went to the United States to seek medical treatment for his eldest son, and stayed there for five years.:1

===London period===
He separated from his family and went to live in London. While sitting one day in Hyde Park, he was confronted by a police officer who threatened to lock him up if he didn&#x27;t leave the park. Down to his last five pence, he made his way to the Ramakrishna Mission of London where the residing Swami gave him money for a hotel room for the night. The following day, U.G. began working for the Ramakrishna Mission, an arrangement that lasted for three months. Before leaving the mission he left a letter for the residing &quot;Swamiji&quot; telling him that he had become a new man.:2

About this time, Jiddu Krishnamurti was in London and the two Krishnamurtis renewed their acquaintance. Jiddu tried to advise U.G. on his recent marital troubles, but U.G. didn&#x27;t want his help. Jiddu eventually persuaded him to attend a few talks he was giving in London, which U.G. did, but found himself bored listening to him.:3

In 1961, U.G. put an end to his relationship with his wife. Their marriage had been a unhappy affair, and by that time he described himself as being &quot;detached&quot; from his family, emotionally as well as physically. He then left London and spent three months living in Paris, using funds he had obtained by selling his unused return ticket to India, during which time he ate a different variety of cheese each day. Down to his last 150 francs, he decided to go to Switzerland where he still had a small bank account. By mistake he went by train to Geneva, rather than Zurich, where the bank account was.

===Early Swiss period===
After two weeks in Geneva, U.G. was unable to pay his hotel bill and sought refuge at the Indian Consulate. He was listless, without hope, and described himself as &quot;finished&quot; – he requested that he be sent back to India, which the consular authorities refused to do at the state&#x27;s expense. A consulate employee in her 60s named Valentine de Kerven offered U.G. shelter. Valentine and U.G. became good friends, and she provided him with a home in Switzerland.

For the next few years, the questions regarding the subject of enlightenment – or anything else – did not interest him, and he did nothing to further his enquiry. But by 1967, U.G. was again concerned with the subject of enlightenment, wanting to know what that state was, which sages such as Siddhārtha Gautama purportedly attained. Hearing that Jiddu Krishnamurti was giving a talk in Saanen, U.G. decided to attend. During the talk, Jiddu was describing the state and U.G. thought that it referred to himself. He explained it as follows:
He continues:
=== The Calamity ===
The next day U.G. was again pondering the question &quot;How do I know I am in that state?&quot; with no answer forthcoming. He later recounted that on suddenly realising the question had no answer, there was an unexpected physical, as well as psychological, reaction. It seemed to him like &quot;a sudden &#x27;explosion&#x27; inside, blasting, as it were, every cell, every nerve and every gland in my body.&quot; Afterwards, he started experiencing what he called &quot;the calamity&quot;, a series of bizarre physiological transformations that took place over the course of a week, affecting each one of his senses, and finally resulting in a deathlike experience. He described it this way:

Upon the eighth day:


U.G. could not, and did not, explain the provenance of the calamity experiences. In response to questions, he maintained that it happened &quot;in spite of&quot; his pre-occupation with – and search for – enlightenment. He also maintained that the calamity had nothing to do with his life up to that point, or with his upbringing. Several times he described the calamity happening to him as a matter of chance, and he insisted that he could not possibly, in any way, impart that experience to anybody else.

===Post-calamity===
According to U.G., his life-story can be separated into the pre- and post-calamity parts. Describing his post-calamity life, he claimed to be functioning permanently in what he called &quot;the natural state&quot;: A state of spontaneous, purely physical, sensory existence, characterised by discontinuity – though not absence – of thought. U.G. also maintained that upon finding himself in the &quot;natural state&quot;, he had lost all acquired knowledge and memories, and had to re-learn everything, as if &quot;...the slate had been wiped clean&quot;.

After his calamity experience, U.G. often traveled to countries around the world, declining to hold formal discussions yet talking freely to visitors and those that sought him out. He gave his only formal post-calamity public talk in India, in 1972.

His unorthodox non-message philosophy and the uncompromising, direct style of its presentation, generated a measure of notoriety and sharply-divided opinions. At the extremes, some people considered him enlightened, while others considered him nothing more than a charlatan. The clamour increased as books and articles about U.G. and his newly expounded philosophy continued appearing.

Several of his group discussions and interviews have been published in books, or are carried verbatim on various websites. There is also a variety of audio and video documents available online.

==Health==
U.G. was known for his unusual health and diet preferences. Carrying with him a &quot;portable kitchen&quot; in a tiny suitcase throughout his travels, he consumed a great deal of salt and cream, and stated &quot;no meal should take longer than a few minutes to prepare.&quot; After 1949, U.G. never saw a doctor or took medication, believing the body would take care of itself. Often complimented for good looks in his old age, U.G. would respond &quot;that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t eat healthy food, I don&#x27;t take vitamins, and I don&#x27;t exercise!&quot;

==Death==
On 22 March 2007, U.G. died at Vallecrosia in Italy. He had slipped and injured himself and was bedridden for seven weeks before his death. Three friends, including long-time devotee Mahesh Bhatt, were in the city with him when he died. Mahesh states in his biography of U.G., &quot;U.G. Krishnamurti, A Life&quot;, that U.G. died alone after Mahesh and those present went out for a brief walk with the specific intention of allowing U.G. some moments of solitude to die in peace. In February 2007, he had dictated his final speech, &quot;My Swan Song&quot;.

U.G. had asked that no rituals or funeral rites be conducted upon his death; also, he did not leave instructions on how to dispose of his body. His body was cremated by Bhatt the next day. True to his own philosophy, U.G. did not want to be remembered after his death.

==Philosophy==


U.G. emphasised the impossibility and non-necessity of any human change, radical or mundane. These assertions, he stated, cannot be considered as a &quot;teaching&quot;, that is, something intended to be used to bring about a change. He insisted that the body and its actions are already perfect, and he considered attempts to change or mould the body as violations of the peace and the harmony that is already there. The self, as he perceived, is an illusory entity projected by thought and sustained by the &quot;demand&quot; to bring about change in the world, in itself, or in both. Likewise, U.G. rejected the notion of a knower by turning the epistemological cornerstone &quot;Cogito, ergo sum&quot; by Descartes on its head, claiming that there is no one thinking, there is just thinking. He went one step further in his statement: &quot;What is there is about thought but not thought itself.&quot; Furthermore, human self-consciousness is not a thing, but a movement, one characterised by &quot;perpetual malcontent&quot; and a &quot;fascist insistence&quot; on its own importance and survival.

While U.G. denied the existence of an individual mind he accepted the concept of a world mind, which according to him contained the accumulation of the totality of man&#x27;s knowledge and experience. He also used &quot;thought sphere&quot; (atmosphere of thoughts) synonymously with the term &quot;world mind&quot;. He stated that human beings inhabit this thought realm or thought sphere and that the human brain acts like an antenna, picking and choosing thoughts according to its needs. U.G. held all human experience to be the result of this process of thought. The self-consciousness or &quot;I&quot; in human beings is born out of the need to give oneself continuity through the constant utilisation of thought. When this continuity is broken, even for a split second, its hold on the body is broken and the body falls into its natural rhythm. Thought also falls into its natural place – then it can no longer interfere or influence the working of the human body. In the absence of any continuity, the arising thoughts combust.

In its natural state, the senses of the body take on independent existences (uncoordinated by any &quot;inner self&quot;) and the ductless glands (that correspond to the locations of the Hindu &quot;chakras&quot;) become reactivated. U.G. described how it is the pineal gland, or the &quot;Ajna Chakra&quot;, that takes over the functioning of the body in the natural state, as opposed to thought.

U.G. also maintained that the reason people came to him (and to gurus) was to find solutions for their everyday real problems, and/or for solutions to a fabricated problem, namely, the search for spirituality and enlightenment. He insisted that this search is caused by the cultural environment, which demands conformity of individuals as it simultaneously places within them the desire to be special – the achievement of enlightenment thus viewed as a crowning expression of an individual&#x27;s &quot;specialness&quot; and uniqueness. Consequently, the desire for enlightenment is exploited by gurus, spiritual teachers, and other &quot;sellers of shoddy goods&quot;, who pretend to offer various ways to reach that goal. According to U.G., all these facilitators never deliver, and cannot ever deliver, since the goal itself (i.e. enlightenment), is unreachable.

According to U.G., &quot;The so called self-realization is the discovery for yourself and by yourself that there is no self to discover. That will be a very shocking thing because it&#x27;s going to blast every nerve, every cell, even the cells in the marrow of your bones.&quot;

<doc id="469969" wikidata="Q292982" url="?curid=469969" title="Alpha-1 antitrypsin">
<text>Alpha-1 antitrypsin or α1-antitrypsin (A1AT, α1AT, A1A, or AAT) is a protein belonging to the serpin superfamily. It is encoded in humans by the &quot;SERPINA1&quot; gene. A protease inhibitor, it is also known as alpha1–proteinase inhibitor (A1PI) or alpha1-antiproteinase (A1AP) because it inhibits various proteases (not just trypsin). As a type of enzyme inhibitor, it protects tissues from enzymes of inflammatory cells, especially neutrophil elastase.

When the blood contains inadequate or defective A1AT (as in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency), neutrophil elastase can excessively break down elastin, leading to the loss of elasticity in the lungs. This results in respiratory issues, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in adults. Normally, A1AT is produced in the liver and enters the systemic circulation. However, defective A1AT may accumulate in the liver, potentially causing cirrhosis in both adults and children.

A1AT not only binds to neutrophil elastase from inflammatory cells but also to elastase on the cell surface. In this latter role, elastase acts as a signaling molecule for cell movement, rather than as an enzyme. Besides liver cells, A1PI is also produced in bone marrow, lymphoid tissue, and the Paneth cells of the gut.

Inactivation of A1AT by other enzymes during inflammation or infection can halt T cell migration precisely at the site of the pathological insult. This suggests that α1PI plays a key role in lymphocyte movement and immune surveillance, particularly in response to infection.
A1AT is both an endogenous protease inhibitor and an exogenous one used as medication. The pharmaceutical form is purified from human donor blood and is sold under the nonproprietary name alpha1–proteinase inhibitor (human) and under various trade names (including Aralast NP, Glassia, Prolastin, Prolastin-C, and Zemaira). Recombinant versions are also available but are currently used in medical research more than as medication.

==Nomenclature==
The protein was initially named &quot;antitrypsin&quot; because of its ability to bind and irreversibly inactivate the enzyme trypsin in vitro covalently. Trypsin, a type of peptidase, is a digestive enzyme active in the duodenum and elsewhere. In older biomedical literature it was sometimes called serum trypsin inhibitor (STI, dated terminology), because its capability as a trypsin inhibitor was a salient feature of its early study.

The term &quot;alpha-1&quot; refers to the protein&#x27;s behavior on protein electrophoresis. On electrophoresis, the protein component of the blood is separated by electric current. There are several &quot;clusters&quot;, the first being albumin, the second being the &quot;alpha&quot;, the third &quot;beta&quot; and the fourth &quot;gamma&quot; (immunoglobulins). The non-albumin proteins are referred to as globulins.

The &quot;alpha&quot; region can be further divided into two sub-regions, termed &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is the main protein of the alpha-globulin 1 region.

Another name used is &quot;alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor&quot; (α1-PI).

== Genetics ==
The gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 14 (14q32.1).

Over 100 different variants of α1-antitrypsin have been described in various populations. North-Western Europeans are most at risk for carrying one of the most common mutant forms of A1AT, the Z mutation (Glu342Lys on M1A, rs28929474).

== Structure ==
A1AT is a single-chain glycoprotein consisting of 394 amino acids in the mature form and exhibits many glycoforms. The three N-linked glycosylations sites are mainly equipped with so-called diantennary N-glycans. However, one particular site shows a considerable amount of heterogeneity since tri- and even tetraantennary N-glycans can be attached to the Asparagine 107 (UniProtKB amino acid nomenclature). These glycans carry different amounts of negatively charged sialic acids; this causes the heterogeneity observed on normal A1AT when analysed by isoelectric focusing. Also, the fucosylated triantennary N-glycans were shown to have the fucose as part of a so-called Sialyl Lewis x epitope, which could confer this protein particular protein-cell recognition properties. The single cysteine residue of A1AT in position 256 (UniProtKB nomenclature) is found to be covalently linked to a free single cysteine by a disulfide bridge.

== Function ==
A1AT is a 52-kDa serpin and, in medicine, it is considered the most prominent serpin; the terms &quot;α1-antitrypsin&quot; and &quot;protease inhibitor&quot; (&quot;Pi&quot;) are often used interchangeably.

Most serpins inactivate enzymes by binding to them covalently. These enzymes are released locally in relatively low concentrations where they are immediately cleared by proteins such as A1AT. In the acute phase reaction, a further elevation is required to &quot;limit&quot; the damage caused by activated neutrophil granulocytes and their enzyme elastase, which breaks down the connective tissue fiber elastin.

Besides limiting elastase activity to limit tissue degradation, A1PI also acts to induce locomotion of lymphocytes through tissue including immature T cells through the thymus where immature T cells mature to become immunocompetent T cells that are released into tissue to elevate immune responsiveness.

Like all serine protease inhibitors, A1AT has a characteristic secondary structure of beta sheets and alpha helices. Mutations in these areas can lead to non-functional proteins that can polymerise and accumulate in the liver (infantile hepatic cirrhosis).

== Clinical significance ==
Disorders of this protein include alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, an autosomal co-dominant hereditary disorder in which a deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin leads to a chronic uninhibited tissue breakdown. This causes the degradation especially of lung tissue and eventually leads to characteristic manifestations of pulmonary emphysema. Evidence has shown that cigarette smoke can result in oxidation of methionine 358 of α1-antitrypsin (382 in the pre-processed form containing the 24 amino acid signal peptide), a residue essential for binding elastase; this is thought to be one of the primary mechanisms by which cigarette smoking (or second-hand smoke) can lead to emphysema. Because A1AT is expressed in the liver, certain mutations in the gene encoding the protein can cause misfolding and impaired secretion, which can lead to liver cirrhosis.

An extremely rare form of &quot;Pi&quot;, termed &quot;Pi&quot;Pittsburgh, functions as an antithrombin (a related serpin), due to a mutation (Met358Arg). One person with this mutation has been reported to have died of a bleeding diathesis.

A liver biopsy will show abundant PAS-positive globules within periportal hepatocytes.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been found to make autoantibodies toward the carbamylated form of A1AT in the synovial fluid. This suggests that A1AT may play an anti-inflammatory or tissue-protecting role outside the lungs. These antibodies are associated with a more severe disease course, can be observed years before disease onset, and may predict the development of RA in arthralgia patients. Consequently, carbamylated A1AT is currently being developed as an antigenic biomarker for RA.

== Analysis ==
A1AT has a reference range in blood of 0.9–2.3 g/L (in the US the reference range is expressed as mg/dL or micromoles), but the concentration can rise manyfold upon acute inflammation. 

The level of A1AT in serum is most often determined by adding an antibody that binds to A1AT, then using turbidimetry to measure how much A1AT is present. Other detection methods include the use of enzyme-linked-immuno-sorbent-assays and radial immunodiffusion.

Different analytical methods are used to determine A1AT phenotype. As protein electrophoresis is imprecise, the A1AT phenotype is analysed by isoelectric focusing (IEF) in the pH range 4.5-5.5, where the protein migrates in a gel according to its isoelectric point or charge in a pH gradient.

Normal A1AT is termed &quot;M&quot;, as it migrates toward the center of such an IEF gel. Other variants are less functional and are termed A-L and N-Z, dependent on whether they run proximal or distal to the M band. The presence of deviant bands on IEF can signify the presence of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Since the number of identified mutations has exceeded the number of letters in the alphabet, subscripts have been added to most recent discoveries in this area, as in the Pittsburgh mutation described above.

As every person has two copies of the A1AT gene, a heterozygote with two different copies of the gene may have two different bands showing on electrofocusing, although heterozygote with one null mutant that abolishes expression of the gene will only show one band.

In blood test results, the IEF results are notated as in &quot;Pi&quot;MM, where &quot;Pi&quot; stands for protease inhibitor and &quot;MM&quot; is the banding pattern of that patient.

&quot;Alpha-1 antitrypsin&quot; levels in the blood depend on the genotype. Some mutant forms fail to fold properly and are, thus, targeted for destruction in the proteasome, whereas others have a tendency to polymerise, being retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. The serum levels of some of the common genotypes are:

* PiMM: 100% (normal)
* PiMS: 80% of normal serum level of A1AT
* PiSS: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT
* PiMZ: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT
* PiSZ: 40% of normal serum level of A1AT
* PiZZ: 10-15% (severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency)
* PiZ is caused by a glutamate to lysine mutation at position 342 (366 in pre-processed form)
* PiS is caused by a glutamate to valine mutation at position 264 (288 in pre-processed form)
Other rarer forms have been described; in all, there are over 80 variants.

== Medical uses ==
Alpha-1 antitrypsin concentrates are prepared from the blood plasma of blood donors. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of four alpha-1 antitrypsin products derived from a human plasma: Prolastin, Zemaira, Glassia, and Aralast. These products for intravenous augmentation A1AT therapy can cost up to $100,000 per year per patient. They are administered intravenously at a dose of 60 mg/kg once a week; higher doses do not provide additional benefit although they can be used in anticipation of an interruption of weekly administration, such as for a vacation.

Alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (Respreeza) was approved for medical use in the European Union in August 2015. It is indicated for maintenance treatment, to slow the progression of emphysema in adults with documented severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency (e.g., genotypes PiZZ, PiZ (null), Pi (null, null), PiSZ). People are to be under optimal pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment and show evidence of progressive lung disease (e.g. lower forced expiratory volume per second (FEV1) predicted, impaired walking capacity or increased number of exacerbations) as evaluated by a healthcare professional experienced in the treatment of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency.

The most common side effects include dizziness, headache, dyspnoea (shortness of breath) and nausea. Allergic reactions have been observed during treatment, some of which were severe.

Aerosolized-augmented A1AT therapy is under study. This involves inhaling purified human A1AT into the lungs and trapping the A1AT into the lower respiratory tract. However, inhaled A1AT may not reach the elastin fibers in the lung where elastase injury occurs. Further study is currently underway. Recombinant alpha-1 antitrypsin is not yet available for use as a medication but is under development.

== History ==
Axelsson and Laurell first investigated the possibility of allelic variants of A1AT leading to disease in 1965.

<text>The Military Demarcation Line (MDL), sometimes referred to as the Armistice Line, is the land border or demarcation line between North Korea and South Korea. On either side of the line is the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The MDL and DMZ were established by the Korean Armistice Agreement.

In the Yellow Sea, the two Koreas are divided by a &quot;de facto&quot; maritime &quot;military demarcation line&quot; and maritime boundary called the Northern Limit Line (NLL) drawn by the United Nations Command in 1953. The NLL is not described by the Korean Armistice Agreement.

==Demarcation on land==

The DMZ runs near the 38th parallel, covering roughly . American and South Korean soldiers patrol this line along the South Korean side while North Korean soldiers patrol along the North Korean side.

In Korean, the line is called the &quot;Hyujeonseon&quot; (휴전선), meaning &quot;armistice line.&quot; It is also sometimes called the &quot;Gunsa Bungye-seon&quot; (군사분계선), which literally means &quot;military demarcation line.&quot; However, in colloquial usage, the dividing line is more often called the &quot;Sampalseon&quot; (삼팔선, &quot;38th parallel&quot;), a name likely coined at the end of World War II, when it would have been an accurate description of the North-South border.

The line itself is marked off by a series of 1,292 identical signs which are placed at intervals across the peninsula. The north facing side of the signs are written in Korean and Chinese, and in Korean and English on the south facing side. The signs are now aging and rusting.

===Military incidents===
There have been frequent skirmishes along the line since the armistice ended the fighting of the Korean War.

==Northern Limit Line==


Although the Korean Armistice Agreement specifies where the demarcation line and demilitarized zone are located on land, the agreement does not mention lines or zones in adjacent ocean waters. Shortly after the signing of the Armistice, a line in the sea was drawn unilaterally by the United Nations Command (UNC). This Northern Limit Line or North Limit Line (NLL) represented the northern limit of the area in which South Korea permits its vessels to navigate, not a demarcation line on which the two Koreas agreed. The Korean Armistice Agreement (KAA) provisions regarding the MDL and DMZ do not extend into the Yellow Sea or Sea of Japan.

In 1999, North Korea unilaterally asserted its own &quot;North Korean Military Demarcation Line in the West Sea (Yellow Sea)&quot;, also called the &quot;Inter-Korean MDL in the Yellow Sea&quot;.

Nonetheless, the UNC-drawn line functions as a &quot;de facto&quot; or &quot;practical&quot; extension of the 1953 MDL, despite occasional incursions and clashes.

== Joint Security Area crossing ==
On October 16, 2018, the governments of North and South Korea agreed to allow locals and tourists to cross the Military Demarcation Line&#x27;s infamous Joint Security Area location once it is cleared of personnel. The crossings will resemble the brief moment South Korean President Moon Jae-in stepped into North Korea with North Korean Chairman Kim Jong-un on April 27, 2018. After the Joint Security Area was cleared of armed military personnel on October 25, 2018, it was announced that tourism at the MDL crossing would be delayed.

== Establishment of buffer zones, no-fly zones and Yellow Sea peace zones==
On November 1, 2018, officials from the South Korean Ministry of Defense confirmed that buffer zones were established across the DMZ by the North and South Korean militaries to ensure that both militaries would keep their distance from the Military Demarcation Line (MDL). In compliance with the Comprehensive Military Agreement which was signed at the September 2018 inter-Korean summit, the buffer zones help ensure that both Koreas will ban hostility on land, air and sea. The buffer zones stretch from the north of Deokjeok Island to the south of Cho Island in the West Sea and the north of Sokcho city and south of Tongchon County in the East (Yellow) Sea. Both North and South Korea are prohibited from conducting live-fire artillery drills and regiment-level field maneuvering exercises or those by bigger units within 5 kilometers of the MDL.

No-fly zones have also been established along the DMZ to ban the operation of drones, helicopters and other aircraft over an area up to 40 km away from the MDL. For UAVs, the no-fly zone is 15 km from the MDL in the East and 10 km from the MDL in the West. For hot-air balloons, the zone is within 25 km from the MDL. For fixed-wing aircraft, no fly zones are designated within 40 km from the
MDL in the East (between MDL Markers No. 0646 and 1292) and within 20 km of the MDL in the West (between MDL Markers No. 0001 and 0646). For rotary-wing aircraft, the no fly zones are designated within 10 km of the MDL. 
Both Koreas also established &quot;peace zones&quot; in the area of the Yellow Sea which borders the MDL as well.

==Reconnecting of MDL-crossing road==
On November 22, 2018, North and South Korea completed construction to connect a three kilometer road along the DMZ. The road, which travels across the MDL, has 1.7 km in South Korea and 1.3 km in North Korea. The road was reconnected for the first time in 14 years in an effort to assist with a process at the DMZ&#x27;s Arrowhead Hill involving the removal of landmines and exhumation of Korean War remains.

==Inter-Korean transportation services==
On November 30, 2018, following the removal of the &quot;frontline&quot; guard posts and Arrowhead Hill landmines, rail transportation between North and South Korea (which ceased in November 2008) resumed when a South Korean train crossed the MDL into North Korea. On December 8, 2018, a South Korean bus crossed the MDL into North Korea.

==Military border crossing==
On December 12, 2018, militaries from both Koreas crossed the MDL into the opposition countries for the first time in history to verify the removal of &quot;frontline&quot; guard posts.

On June 5, 2024, South Korea&#x27;s military announced that it would resume all military activity on the MDL after the suspension of an inter-Korean military agreement.

<text>Myomancy (from &quot;&quot; &quot;mouse&quot; + &quot;&quot; &quot;divination by means of&quot;) is the practice of reading omens from the behavior of rats or mice, a &quot;theriomantic&quot; method of divination which might be implied in the Bible verse Isaiah 66:17.

In the context of Western history, certain mouse or rat vocalizations (&quot;their particular cries&quot;) and other phenomena, including severe cases of damage wreaked by the rodents, was taken to be a sign predictive of evil. For example, Ælain relates that Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus resigned the dictatorship in consequence of a &quot;warning&quot; from these creatures; according to Varro, Cassius Flaminius retired from the command of the cavalry for the same reason.

Horapollo describes the rat as a symbol of destruction. According to Herodotus, Sennacherib&#x27;s attempt to invade Egypt was thwarted due to his army&#x27;s weapons being systematically destroyed by rats the night before they were due to attack.

The Hebrew word for &quot;mouse&quot; is derived from a root meaning &quot;to separate, divide, or judge&quot;. It was remarked by one of the commentators on Horapollo that the mouse has a finely discriminating taste. An Egyptian manuscript in the &quot;Bibliothèque nationale de France&quot; in Paris contains the representation of a soul going to judgement in which one of the figures is depicted with the head of a rat wearing a traditional judges&#x27; wig.

<doc id="469990" wikidata="Q607538" url="?curid=469990" title="Whirlpool">
<text>A whirlpool is a body of rotating water produced by opposing currents or a current running into an obstacle. Small whirlpools form when a bath or a sink is draining. More powerful ones formed in seas or oceans may be called maelstroms ( ). &quot;Vortex&quot; is the proper term for a whirlpool that has a downdraft.

In narrow ocean straits with fast flowing water, whirlpools are often caused by tides. Many stories tell of ships being sucked into a maelstrom, although only smaller craft are actually in danger. Smaller whirlpools appear at river rapids and can be observed downstream of artificial structures such as weirs and dams. Large cataracts, such as Niagara Falls, produce strong whirlpools.

== Notable whirlpools ==
=== Saltstraumen ===
Saltstraumen is a narrow strait located close to the Arctic Circle, south-east of the city of Bodø, Norway.
It has one of the strongest tidal currents in the world. Whirlpools up to in diameter and in depth are formed when the current is at its strongest.

=== Moskstraumen ===
Moskstraumen or Moske-stroom is an unusual system of whirlpools in the open seas in the Lofoten Islands off the Norwegian coast. It is the second strongest whirlpool in the world with flow currents reaching speeds as high as . This is supposedly the whirlpool depicted in Olaus Magnus&#x27;s map, labeled as &quot;Horrenda Caribdis&quot; (Charybdis).

The Moskstraumen is formed by the combination of powerful semi-diurnal tides and the unusual shape of the seabed, with a shallow ridge between the Moskenesøya and Værøya islands which amplifies and whirls the tidal currents.

The fictional depictions of the Moskstraumen by Edgar Allan Poe, Jules Verne, and Cixin Liu describe it as a gigantic circular vortex that reaches the bottom of the ocean, when in fact it is a set of currents and crosscurrents with a rate of . Poe described this phenomenon in his short story &quot;A Descent into the Maelström&quot;, which in 1841 was the first to use the word &quot;maelstrom&quot; in the English language; in this story related to the Lofoten Maelstrom, two fishermen are swallowed by the maelstrom while one survives.

=== Corryvreckan ===
The Corryvreckan is a narrow strait between the islands of Jura and Scarba, in Argyll and Bute, on the northern side of the Gulf of Corryvreckan, Scotland. It is the third-largest whirlpool in the world. Flood tides and inflow from the Firth of Lorne to the west can drive the waters of Corryvreckan to waves of more than , and the roar of the resulting maelstrom, which reaches speeds of , can be heard away. Though it was classified initially as non-navigable by the Royal Navy it was later categorized as &quot;extremely dangerous&quot;.

A documentary team from Scottish independent producers Northlight Productions once threw a mannequin into the Corryvreckan (&quot;the Hag&quot;) with a high-visibility vest and depth gauge. The mannequin was swallowed and spat up far down current with a depth gauge reading of and evidence of being dragged along the bottom for a great distance.

===Niagara Whirlpool===

About three miles (4.8 kilometers) downstream from Niagara Falls is the Niagara Whirlpool. Located mostly in Canada and partially in the United States, the whirlpool is crossed by the Whirlpool Aero Car.
The basin of the whirlpool is 1,700 feet (518 meters) long and 1,200 feet (365 meters) wide. Its maximum water depth is 125 feet (38 meters).

=== Other notable maelstroms and whirlpools ===

Old Sow whirlpool is located between Deer Island, New Brunswick, Canada, and Moose Island, Eastport, Maine, USA. It is given the epithet &quot;pig-like&quot; as it makes a screeching noise when the vortex is at its full fury and reaches speeds of as much as . The smaller whirlpools around this Old Sow are known as &quot;Piglets&quot;.
The Naruto whirlpools are located in the Naruto Strait near Awaji Island in Japan, which have speeds of .

Skookumchuck Narrows is a tidal rapids that develops whirlpools, on the Sunshine Coast, British Columbia, Canada with speeds of the current exceeding .

French Pass () is a narrow and treacherous stretch of water that separates D&#x27;Urville Island from the north end of the South Island of New Zealand. In 2000 a whirlpool there caught student divers, resulting in fatalities.

A short-lived whirlpool sucked in a portion of the Lake Peigneur in Louisiana, United States after a drilling mishap on November 20, 1980. This was not a naturally occurring whirlpool, but a disaster caused by underwater drillers breaking through the roof of a salt mine. The lake then drained into the mine until the mine filled and the water levels equalized, but the formerly deep lake was now deep. This mishap caused a sinkhole, and in the end, resulted in the destruction of five houses, the loss of nineteen barges and eight tug boats, oil rigs, a mobile home, trees, acres of land, and most of a botanical garden. The adjacent settlement of Jefferson Island was reduced in area by 10%. A crater across was left behind. Nine of the barges, which had sunk, later resurfaced after the whirlpool subsided.

A more recent example of an artificial whirlpool that received significant media coverage occurred in early June 2015, when an intake vortex formed in Lake Texoma, on the Oklahoma–Texas border, near the floodgates of the dam that forms the lake. At the time of the whirlpool&#x27;s formation, the lake was being drained after reaching its highest level ever. The Army Corps of Engineers, which operates the dam and lake, expected that the whirlpool would last until the lake reached normal seasonal levels by late July.

== Dangers ==

Powerful whirlpools have killed unlucky seafarers, but their power tends to be exaggerated by laymen. One of the few reports of a large disaster comes from the fourteenth-century Mali Empire ruler Mansa Musa, as reported by a contemporary, Ibn Fadlallah al-Umari:

Tales like those by Paul the Deacon, Edgar Allan Poe, and Jules Verne are entirely fictional.

However, temporary whirlpools caused by major engineering disasters, such as the Lake Peigneur disaster, have been recorded as capable of submerging medium-sized watercraft such as barges and tugboats.

== In literature and popular culture ==
Besides Poe and Verne, another literary source is of the 1500s, Olaus Magnus, a Swedish bishop, who had stated that a maelstrom more powerful than the one written about in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; sucked in ships, which sank to the bottom of the sea, and even whales were pulled in. Pytheas, the Greek historian, also mentioned that maelstroms swallowed ships and threw them up again.

The monster Charybdis of Greek mythology was later rationalized as a whirlpool, which sucked entire ships into its fold in the narrow coast of Sicily, a disaster faced by navigators.

During the 8th century, Paul the Deacon, who had lived among the Belgii, described tidal bores and the maelstrom for a Mediterranean audience unused to such violent tidal surges:

Three of the most notable literary references to the Lofoten Maelstrom date from the nineteenth century. The first is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe named &quot;A Descent into the Maelström&quot; (1841). The second is &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; (1870), a novel by Jules Verne. At the end of this novel, Captain Nemo seems to commit suicide, sending his &quot;Nautilus&quot; submarine into the Maelstrom (although in Verne&#x27;s sequel Nemo and the &quot;Nautilus&quot; were seen to have survived). The &quot;Norway maelstrom&quot; is also mentioned in Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;.

In the &quot;Life of St Columba&quot;, the author, Adomnan of Iona, attributes to the saint miraculous knowledge of a particular bishop who sailed into a whirlpool off the coast of Ireland. In Adomnan&#x27;s narrative, he quotes Columba saying

The Corryvreckan whirlpool plays a key role in the 1945 Powell and Pressburger film &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;m Going!&quot;. Joan Webster (Wendy Hiller) is determined to get to the Isle of Kiloran and marry her fiancé. Dangerous weather delays her crossing, and her determination becomes desperate when she realizes that she is falling in love with Torquil MacNeil (Roger Livesey). Against the advice of experienced folk, she offers a young fisherman a huge sum of money to take her over. At the last moment, Royal Naval Officer Torquil steps into the boat, and after a squall knocks the engine out of commission, they face the whirlpool. Torquil manages to repair the engine before the tide turns, and they return to the mainland. This part of the picture uses footage Powell filmed, while tied to a mast to leave both hands free for the camera, at Corryvreckan, incorporated into scenes shot in a huge tank at the studio.

In the 2007 film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;, the final battle between the &quot;Black Pearl&quot; and the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; takes place with both ships sailing inside a giant whirlpool which appears to be over a kilometer wide and several hundred meters deep. The fantasy novels &quot;Eldest&quot; and &quot;The Bellmaker&quot; (otherwise unconnected) both feature a scene where the protagonists&#x27; ship escapes pursuit by successfully navigating a massive whirlpool, while the pursuing vessel fails to do so and is dragged under.

== Etymology ==

One of the earliest uses in English of the Scandinavian word &quot;malström&quot; or &quot;malstrøm&quot; was by Edgar Allan Poe in his short story &quot;A Descent into the Maelström&quot; (1841). The Nordic word itself is derived from the Dutch word &quot;maelstrom&quot; (; modern spelling ), from &quot;malen&quot; (&#x27;to mill&#x27; or &#x27;to grind&#x27;) and &quot;stroom&quot; (&#x27;stream&#x27;), to form the meaning &#x27;grinding current&#x27; or literally &#x27;mill-stream&#x27;, in the sense of milling (grinding) grain.

<doc id="470003" wikidata="Q422469" url="?curid=470003" title="Androsterone">
<text>Androsterone, or 3α-hydroxy-5α-androstan-17-one, is an endogenous steroid hormone, neurosteroid, and putative pheromone. It is a weak androgen with a potency that is approximately 1/7 that of testosterone. Androsterone is a metabolite of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In addition, it can be converted back into DHT via 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, bypassing conventional intermediates such as androstanedione and testosterone, and as such, can be considered to be a metabolic intermediate in its own right.

Androsterone is also known to be an inhibitory androstane neurosteroid, acting as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, and possesses anticonvulsant effects. The unnatural enantiomer of androsterone is more potent as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors and as an anticonvulsant than the natural form. Androsterone&#x27;s 3β-isomer is epiandrosterone, and its 5β-epimer is etiocholanolone. The 3β,5β-isomer is epietiocholanolone.

==Biological function==
Androsterone has generally been considered to be an inactive metabolite of testosterone, which when conjugated by glucuronidation and sulfation allows testosterone to be removed from the body, but it is a weak neurosteroid that can cross into the brain and could have effects on brain function.

The view of androsterone as generally being of low significance however, seems to need review in the light of 21st century research, which suggests that androsterone significantly affects masculinization in mammalian fetuses. Masculinization of the external genitalia in humans is subject to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) derived via the recognised androgenic pathway and also via a backdoor pathway. Therefore, androstanediol can be used a marker of the backdoor pathway of DHT synthesis. Spectrometric studies identify androsterone as the main backdoor androgen in the human male fetus. Circulating levels are sex dependent, DHT being essentially absent in the female, in which titres of backdoor intermediates also are very low.

In males, backdoor intermediates occur mainly in the liver and adrenal of the fetus, and in the placenta — hardly at all in the testis. Instead, progesterone in the placenta is the main backdoor substrate for androgen synthesis. This also is consistent with the observation that placental insufficiency has been associated with disruptions of development of fetal genitalia.

===Pheromone===
Androsterone is found in the human axilla and skin as well as in the urine. It may also be secreted by human sebaceous glands. It is described as having a musky odor similar to that of androstenol. Androsterone has been found to affect human behavior when smelled.

==Biochemistry==

===Biosynthesis===
Androsterone and its 5β-isomer, etiocholanolone, are produced in the body as metabolites of testosterone. Testosterone is converted to 5α-dihydrotestosterone and 5β-dihydrotestosterone by 5α-reductase and 5β-reductase, respectively. The enzyme 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase converts the reduced forms to 3α-androstanediol and 3β-androstanediol, which are subsequently converted by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to androsterone and etiocholanolone, respectively. Androsterone and etiocholanolone can also be formed from androstenedione via the action of 5α-reductase and 5β-reductase forming 5α-androstanedione and 5β-androstanedione which are then converted to androsterone and etiocholanolone by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, respectively.

===Metabolism===
Androsterone is sulfated into androsterone sulfate and glucuronidated into androsterone glucuronide and these conjugates are excreted in urine.

==Chemistry==
===Sources===
Androsterone has been shown to naturally occur in pine pollen, celery, truffles and is well known in many animal species.

==History==
Androsterone was first isolated in 1931, by Adolf Friedrich Johann Butenandt and Kurt Tscherning. They distilled over of male urine, from which they got of crystalline androsterone, which was sufficient to find that the chemical formula was very similar to estrone.

<doc id="470006" wikidata="Q234865" url="?curid=470006" title="Sue Grafton">
<text>Sue Taylor Grafton (April 24, 1940 – December 28, 2017) was an American author of detective novels. She is best known as the author of the &quot;alphabet series&quot; (&quot;&quot;A&quot; Is for Alibi&quot;, etc.) featuring private investigator Kinsey Millhone in the fictional city of Santa Teresa, California. The daughter of detective novelist, C. W. Grafton, she said the strongest influence on her crime novels was author Ross Macdonald. Before her success with this series, she wrote screenplays for television movies.

==Early life==
Sue Grafton was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to C. W. Grafton (1909–1982) and Vivian Harnsberger, both of whom were the children of Presbyterian missionaries.

Her father was a municipal bond lawyer who also wrote mystery novels, and her mother was a former high school chemistry teacher. Her father enlisted in the Army during World War II when she was three and returned when she was five, after which her home life started falling apart. Both parents became alcoholics, and Grafton said &quot;From the age of five onward, I was left to raise myself&quot;.

Grafton and her older sister, Ann, grew up in Louisville, where she went to Atherton High School. She attended the University of Louisville (first year) and Western Kentucky State Teachers College (now Western Kentucky University) in her sophomore and junior years before graduating from the University of Louisville in 1961 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English Literature and minors in humanities and fine arts. She was a member of Pi Beta Phi.

After graduating, Grafton worked as a hospital admissions clerk, a cashier, and a medical secretary in Santa Monica and Santa Barbara, California.

Grafton&#x27;s mother killed herself in 1960 after returning home from an operation to remove esophageal cancer brought on by years of drinking and smoking. Her father died in 1982, a few months before &quot;&quot;A&quot; Is for Alibi&quot; was published.

==Writing career==
Grafton&#x27;s father was enamored with detective fiction and wrote at night. He taught Grafton lessons on the writing and editing process and groomed her to be a writer. Inspired by her father, Grafton began writing when she was 18 and finished her first novel four years later. She continued writing and completed six more novels. Only two of these seven novels (&quot;Keziah Dane&quot; and &quot;The Lolly-Madonna War&quot;) were published. Grafton would later destroy the manuscripts for her five early, unpublished novels.

Unable to find success with her novels, Grafton turned to screenplays. Grafton worked for the next 15 years writing screenplays for television movies, including &quot;Sex and the Single Parent&quot;; &quot;Mark, I Love You&quot;; and &quot;Nurse&quot;. Grafton sold the movie rights for &quot;The Lolly-Madonna War&quot; and co-wrote the screenplay for the feature film. The adaptation, released in 1973 as &quot;Lolly-Madonna XXX&quot;, starred Rod Steiger and Jeff Bridges. Her screenplay for &quot;Walking Through the Fire&quot; earned a Christopher Award in 1979. In collaboration with her husband, Steven Humphrey, she also adapted the Agatha Christie novels, &quot;A Caribbean Mystery&quot; and &quot;Sparkling Cyanide,&quot; for television and co-wrote &quot;A Killer in the Family&quot; and &quot;Love on the Run&quot;. She is credited with the story upon which the screenplay for the made for TV movie &quot;Svengali&quot; (1983) was based.

Her experience as a screenwriter taught her the basics of structuring a story, writing dialogue, and creating action sequences. Grafton then felt ready to return to writing fiction. While going through a &quot;bitter divorce and custody battle that lasted six long years&quot;, Grafton imagined ways to kill or maim her ex-husband. Her fantasies were so vivid that she decided to write them down.

Grafton had been fascinated by mysteries series whose titles were related, such as John D. MacDonald&#x27;s Travis McGee series, each of which included a color in the title, and Harry Kemelman&#x27;s Rabbi Small series, each of which included a day of the week in the title. While reading Edward Gorey&#x27;s &quot;The Gashlycrumb Tinies&quot;, a picture book with an alphabetized list of ways for children to die, Grafton decided to write a series of novels whose titles would follow the alphabet. She immediately sat down and made a list of all of the crime-related words that she knew.

These became the series now known as the &quot;alphabet novels&quot;, featuring sleuth and private investigator, Kinsey Millhone. The name rhymes and alliterates with that of Sharon McCone, the heroine of crime novels by Marcia Muller, of whom Grafton wrote, &quot;Marcia Muller is the founding &#x27;mother&#x27; of the contemporary female hard-boiled private eye.&quot; The series is set in Santa Teresa, a fictionalized version of Santa Barbara. Grafton followed the lead of Ross Macdonald, who created the fictional version of the city. Grafton described Kinsey Millhone as her alter ego, &quot;the person I might have been had I not married young and had children.&quot;

The series begins with &quot;&quot;A&quot; Is for Alibi&quot;, published and set in 1982. &quot;&quot;B&quot; Is for Burglar&quot; followed in 1985; after that, Grafton usually put out a further book in the series every year or two. Each novel&#x27;s title combined a letter with a word, except &quot;X&quot;. After the publication of &quot;&quot;G&quot; Is for Gumshoe&quot;, Grafton was able to quit her screenwriting job and focus on her novel writing.

Though written between 1982 and 2017, the Kinsey Millhone novels are all set in the 1980s, with each novel chronologically taking place only a few weeks (or at most a few months) after the previous one. The final novel (&quot;Y&quot; Is for Yesterday) is set in 1989.

The name of each book was a source of speculation. In May 2009, Grafton told Media Bistro that she was &quot;just trying to figure out how to get from &quot;&quot;U&quot; is for Undertow&quot; to &quot;&quot;Z&quot; Is for Zero&quot;&quot; and that &quot;just because she knows the endgame title for Z [...] doesn&#x27;t mean she knows what V, W, X, and Y will be&quot;. Grafton said that the series would end with &quot;&quot;Z&quot; Is for Zero&quot;, but she died before she could begin writing it. Her daughter said Grafton would never allow a ghostwriter to write in her name and &quot;as far as we in the family are concerned, the alphabet now ends at Y.&quot;

Grafton&#x27;s novels have been published in 28 countries and in 26 languages. She refused to sell the film and television rights, because writing screenplays &quot;cured&quot; her of the desire to work with Hollywood. (TV movies in Japan, however, were adapted from &quot;&quot;B&quot; is for Burglar&quot; and &quot;&quot;D&quot; is for Deadbeat&quot;.) Grafton told her children her ghost would haunt them if they sold the film rights after her death. The books in the series were on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for an aggregate of about 400 weeks. &quot;F is for Fugitive&quot; was the first, entering at number 10 on the paperback list; by 1995 &quot;&quot;L&quot; is for Lawless&quot; entered the best seller list at number one followed by ten more in the series.

==Writing style==
Grafton&#x27;s style is characteristic of hardboiled detective fiction, according to the authors of &quot;&#x27;G&#x27; is for Grafton&quot;, who describe it as &quot;laconic, breezy, wise-cracking&quot;. The novels are framed as reports Kinsey writes in the course of her investigations, which are signed off in the epilogue of each novel. The first-person narrative allows the reader to see through the eyes of Kinsey, who chronicles various descriptions of &quot;eccentric buildings and places&quot;, giving depth to the narrative. The repeated descriptions of the Santa Barbara shoreline (chronicled as Kinsey&#x27;s early morning runs), are &quot;skillful, evocative writing of a caliber that takes Grafton well beyond being categorized as &#x27;merely&#x27; a writer of detective fiction and into the so-called mainstream of &#x27;serious&#x27; American fiction.&quot;

==Awards==
==Personal life==
Grafton first married in 1959, aged 18, to James L. Flood, with whom she had a son and a daughter. The two divorced by the time Grafton graduated from college in 1961. Her second marriage was with Al Schmidt in 1962, but it ended with protracted divorce and custody proceedings over their daughter.

She married her third husband, Steven F. Humphrey, in 1978. They divided their time between Santa Barbara, California, and Louisville, Kentucky; Humphrey taught at universities in both cities. In 2000, the couple bought and later restored Lincliff, a Louisville estate once owned by hardware baron William Richardson Belknap.

Grafton died at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara on December 28, 2017, after a two-year battle with cancer of the appendix.

In 2019, an award in Grafton&#x27;s memory was established by G.P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons and is under the aegis of the Mystery Writers of America.

==In popular culture==
Grafton&#x27;s introduction of a young, no-nonsense female private detective in the Alphabet Mystery series was ground-breaking at the time when &quot;A is for Alibi&quot; was first released in 1982. Until the creation of Kinsey Milhone and V.I. Warshawski, created by Sarah Paretsky, in &quot;Indemnity Only&quot;, also in 1982, private detectives in fiction were almost always male.

*In the &quot;Mayham&quot; episode of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, Carmela sits by Tony&#x27;s bedside in the hospital, reading Sue Grafton&#x27;s &quot;&quot;G&quot; Is for Gumshoe&quot;.
*In the &quot;Local Ad&quot; episode of &quot;The Office&quot;, Phyllis goes to a Sue Grafton book signing at the mall to try to get her to be in the Dunder-Mifflin Scranton branch commercial. She is told by Michael Scott not to take no for an answer. After waiting in line, Phyllis meets Grafton, only to be rebuffed by her. Phyllis continues to ask until she is thrown out of the store in front of all her friends. Meanwhile, Andy and Creed talk about how &quot;crazy hot&quot; the author is.
*A scene in the film &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot; shows Prof. Hilbert reading the Sue Grafton novel &quot;&quot;I&quot; Is for Innocent&quot; while serving as a lifeguard.
*In the &quot;Superego&quot; podcast Season 3 Episode 14, guest star, actor and comedian, Rob Delaney impersonates Sue Grafton.
*Sketch comedy group &quot;The Whitest Kids U&#x27; Know&quot; parodied Grafton in their sketch &quot;A Is For&quot;.
*Kinsey Millhone is featured in cameo appearances in crime novels by other authors. Bill Pronzini and Marcia Muller have their fictional detective spot Millhone at a convention in Chicago. Sara Paretsky has her sleuth V. I. Warshawski envy Millhone&#x27;s organization.
*Mick Herron has his fictional detective Zöe Bohm drive a loaned orange VW with a map of Santa Teresa, California in the glovebox in &quot;Why We Die&quot;.
*In the ninth episode of the first season of Tracey Wigfield sitcom &quot;Great News&quot; (&quot;Carol Has A Bully&quot;), the character Carol (Andrea Martin) secretly reads a fictional Sue Grafton book, &quot;S is for Sex Murder&quot; when she is supposed to be studying.

<doc id="470008" wikidata="Q7935819" url="?curid=470008" title="Viscount Mountgarret">
<text>Viscount Mountgarret is a title in the Peerage of Ireland.

The title was created in 1550 for the Hon. Richard Butler, younger son of Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond. 
Butler had largely rebuilt the tower house at Mountgarret in County Wexford.
His grandson, the third Viscount, was outlawed and excepted from pardon in 1652, one year after his death. His son, the fourth Viscount, received a pardon for all treasons and rebellions from King Charles II and was restored to his estates.

He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Viscount who was a supporter of King James II and led the siege of Derry in 1688 to 1689. Lord Mountgarret was taken prisoner and outlawed, with his estates forfeited. However, in 1715 the outlawry was reversed and in 1721 he claimed his seat in the Irish House of Lords.

His great-grandson, the eleventh Viscount, represented County Kilkenny in the Irish House of Commons. He was succeeded by his son, the twelfth Viscount. He was made Earl of Kilkenny in the Peerage of Ireland in 1793. The earldom technically became extinct on his death in 1846, when he was succeeded in the viscountcy by his nephew, the thirteenth Viscount.

Despite the official title version, members of the Butler family have been known to refer to themselves as the rightful heirs to both the earldom and dukedom of Kilkenny. His son, the fourteenth Viscount, assumed in 1891 by Royal licence the surname of Rawson-Butler and the arms of Rawson (which were those of his maternal grandfather) when he inherited the Nidd Hall estate but in 1902 he resumed by Royal licence the surname of Butler only. In 1911 he was created Baron Mountgarret, of Nidd in the West Riding of the County of York, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. the titles are held by his great-great-grandson, the eighteenth Viscount, who succeeded his father in 2004. He is understood to be the likely heir to the ancient earldom of Ormond (created in 1328) as well as to the 16th century earldom of Ossory, but has not successfully proven the claim.

The family seat is Stainley House, near Harrogate, North Yorkshire. The ancestral family home was Nidd Hall, also near Harrogate,

<doc id="470014" wikidata="Q157094" url="?curid=470014" title="Nebra sky disc">
<text>The Nebra sky disc (, ) is a bronze disc of around diameter and a weight of , having a blue-green patina and inlaid with gold symbols. These symbols are interpreted generally as the Sun or full moon, a lunar crescent, and stars, including a cluster of seven stars, axiomatically interpreted as the Pleiades.

Two golden arcs that were along the sides are thought to mark the angle between the solstices, one now is missing. Another arc at the bottom with internal parallel lines is usually interpreted as a solar boat with numerous oars, although some authors have also suggested that it may represent a rainbow, the Aurora Borealis, a comet, or a sickle.

In 1999, the disc was found buried on the Mittelberg hill near Nebra in Germany. It is dated by archaeologists to and attributed to the Early Bronze Age Unetice culture. Various scientific analyses of the disc, the items found with the disc, and the find spot have confirmed the Early Bronze Age dating.

The Nebra sky disc features the oldest concrete depiction of astronomical phenomena known from anywhere in the world. In June 2013, it was included in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register and termed &quot;one of the most important archaeological finds of the twentieth century.&quot;

== Discovery ==
The disc, together with two bronze swords, two sets of remains of axes, a chisel, and fragments of spiral armbands were discovered in 1999 by Henry Westphal and Mario Renner while they were treasure-hunting with a metal detector. The detectorists were operating without a license and knew their activity constituted looting and was illegal. Archaeological artefacts are the property of the state in Saxony-Anhalt. They damaged the disc with their spade and destroyed parts of the site. The next day, Westphal and Renner sold the entire hoard for 31,000 DM to a dealer in Cologne. The hoard changed hands, probably several times, within Germany during the next two years, being sold for up to a million DM. By 2001 knowledge of its existence had become public.

In February 2002, the state archaeologist, Harald Meller, acquired the disc in a police-led sting operation in Basel from a couple who had put it on the black market for 700,000 DM. The original finders were eventually traced. In a plea bargain, they led police and archaeologists to the discovery site. Archaeologists opened a dig at the site and uncovered evidence that supported the looters&#x27; claims. There were traces of bronze artefacts in the ground, and the soil at the site matched soil samples found clinging to the artefacts. The disc and its accompanying finds are held by the State Museum of Prehistory in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.

The two looters received sentences of four months and ten months, respectively, from a Naumburg court in September 2003. They appealed, but the Appeals Court raised their sentences to six and twelve months, respectively.

The discovery site is a prehistoric enclosure encircling the top of a elevation in the Ziegelroda Forest, known as (&quot;central hill&quot;), some west of Leipzig. The surrounding area is known to have been settled in the Neolithic era, and Ziegelroda Forest contains approximately 1,000 barrows.

At the enclosure&#x27;s location, the sun seems to set every summer solstice behind the Brocken, the highest peak of the Harz mountains, some to the northwest. The treasure hunters claimed the artefacts were discovered within a pit inside the bank-and-ditch enclosure.

== Dating ==
Axes and swords found buried with the disc were dated typologically to –1500 BCE. Remains of birch bark found in the sword hilts have been Radiocarbon dated to between 1600 and 1560 BCE, confirming this estimate. This corresponds to the date of burial, at which time the disc had likely been in existence for several generations. Analyses of metal radioactivity and the corrosion layer on the disc further support the early Bronze Age dating.

== Origin of the metals ==
According to an initial analysis of trace elements by x-ray fluorescence by E. Pernicka, then at the University of Freiberg, the copper originated at Bischofshofen in Austria, whilst the gold was thought to be from the Carpathian Mountains. A more recent analysis found that the gold used in the first development phase (see below) was from the River Carnon in southern Cornwall in England. The tin present in the bronze was also of Cornish origin.

== History ==
As preserved, the disc was developed in four stages:
# Initially the disc had thirty-two small round gold circles, a large circular plate, and a large crescent-shaped plate attached. The circular plate is interpreted as either the Sun or the full Moon, the crescent shape as the crescent Moon (or either the Sun or the Moon undergoing eclipse), and the dots as stars, with the cluster of seven dots likely representing a star cluster. The star cluster is thought to refer to the Pleiades, or possibly the general symbol of a star cluster.
# At some later date, two arcs (constructed from gold of a different origin, as shown by its chemical impurities) were added at opposite edges of the disc. To make space for these arcs, one small circle was moved from the left side toward the centre of the disc and two of the circles on the right were covered over, so that thirty remain visible. The two arcs span an angle of 82°, correctly indicating the angle between the positions of sunsets at summer and winter solstice at the latitude of the Mittelberg (51°N). The arcs relate to the Sun&#x27;s path – the ecliptic. Given that ancient astronomers knew the planets and many stars that mark the ecliptic, they could observe it sweep across the horizon within the arcs, in a single winter night, not just sunrise and sunset over an entire year. Thus, the arcs are consistent with wholly nighttime use.
# The final addition was another arc at the bottom, identified as a solar boat, again made of gold, but originating from a different source. 
# By the time the disc was buried it also had 38 to 40 holes punched out around its perimeter, each approximately in diameter. The exact number is obscured by damage to the disc edge.

== Significance ==
The find is regarded as reconfirming that the astronomical knowledge and abilities of the people of the European Bronze Age included close observation of the yearly course of the Sun and the angle between its rising and setting points at the summer and winter solstices. While much older earthworks and megalithic astronomical complexes, such as the Goseck circle and Stonehenge, had already been used to mark the solstices, the disc presents this knowledge in the form of a portable object. The disc may have had both a practical astronomical purpose as well as a religious significance.

===Calendar rule=== 

The depiction of the Pleiades on the disc in conjunction with a crescent moon is thought to represent a calendar rule for synchronising solar and lunar calendars, enabling the creation of a lunisolar calendar. This rule is known from an ancient Babylonian collection of texts with the title MUL.APIN. According to one of the seven rules in the compendium, a leap month should be added when the Pleiades appear next to a crescent moon a few days old in the spring, as depicted on the disc. This conjunction occurs approximately every three years. 

Harald Meller suggests that knowledge of this rule may have come from Babylonia to Central Europe through long-distance trade and contacts, despite it being attested earlier on the Nebra disc than in Babylonia. Baltic amber beads have been found in a foundational deposit under the large ziggurat of Aššur in Iraq dating from c. 1800-1750 BC, indicating that a connection existed between both regions when the Nebra disc was created. However some Assyriologists and astronomers have rejected the comparison of the Nebra Disc with MUL.APIN. 

The number of stars depicted on the disc (32) is also thought to be significant, possibly encoding the calendar rule numerically. Firstly, the conjunction of lunar crescent and Pleiades depicted on the disc occurs after 32 days following the last &quot;new light&quot; (the first visible crescent moon of the month), and not before. Secondly, because a lunar year (354 days) is eleven days shorter than a solar year (365 days), 32 solar years is equal in length to 33 lunar years (with an error of only two days). That is, 32 x 365 = 11680 days, and 33 x 354 = 11682 days. This 32 solar-year cycle may be represented on the disc by 32 stars, plus the sun (or full moon), adding up to 33.

The archaeologist Christoph Sommerfeld has argued that the disc encodes knowledge of the 19-year lunisolar Metonic cycle. According to Sommerfeld the Metonic cycle is similarly encoded on the disc of the Trundholm sun chariot, dating from c. 1500 BC. The Metonic cycle is also thought to be encoded on the Late Bronze Age Berlin Gold Hat, which features a band of 19 &quot;star and crescent&quot; symbols.

Some authors have argued that the number of pin holes around the rim of the disc (approximately 38 to 40) has an astronomical significance. The exact number is not known due to damage to the disc.

The Nebra Disc has been compared to a passage from the Greek poet Hesiod, written around 700 BC, which describes the role of the Pleiades for organizing the agricultural year:

&quot;When the Pleiades, daughters of Atlas, are rising, begin your harvest, and your ploughing when they are going to set. Forty nights and days they are hidden and appear again as the year moves round, when first you sharpen your sickle. This is the law of the plains, and of those who live near the sea, and who inhabit rich country, the glens and hollows far from the tossing sea,—strip to sow and strip to plough and strip to reap, if you wish to get in all Demeter&#x27;s fruits in due season, and that each kind may grow in its season.&quot;
Depictions of the Pleiades are also known from some rock carvings dating from the early Bronze Age, such as at Mont Bégo in the southern Alps and on the &#x27;Calendar Stone&#x27; at Leodagger in Austria, a cult site associated with the Únětice culture which may have functioned as a calendar. The Nebra Disc has some similarities to petroglyphs from the Nordic Bronze Age, some of which are thought to have a calendrical meaning.

===Mythology===

A depiction of a sun and crescent moon similar to the Nebra disc appears on a gold signet ring from Mycenae in Greece, dating from the fifteenth century BC. Beneath the sun and moon is a seated female figure holding three opium poppies in her hand, identified as a goddess of nature and fertility, possibly the Minoan poppy goddess, or an early form of the goddess Demeter. The gold arcs on the Nebra disc also bear a resemblance to the Minoan double-axe or &quot;labrys&quot;, which is centrally depicted on the gold signet ring and considered to be the main symbol of the Minoan goddess, as well as a symbol of Demeter. According to the archaeologist Kristian Kristiansen, imagery similar to that found on Mycenaean signet rings appears in Nordic Bronze Age petroglyphs from the Kivik King&#x27;s Grave in Sweden, dating from the 16th to 15th centuries BC, whilst Baltic amber has been found in the elite shaft graves at Mycenae. Opium poppy has also been found in settlements of the Únětice culture where it may have been used in cult rituals.

====Solar boat====

The gold arc at the bottom of the Disc is usually interpreted as a mythological solar boat or sun-ship, which carried the sun through the day and night. The short lines on each side of the gold arc may represent the oars of a large crew. According to the archaeologist Harald Meller this imagery was &quot;hitherto unknown in Europe&quot; and probably originated in Egypt, possibly reaching Central Europe through wide-ranging contacts and travel. In contrast the archaeologist Mary Cahill has argued that sun-ships were already depicted on gold lunulae from the Bell Beaker culture, from which the Únětice culture developed. Solar boats may even be depicted on rock art from the Neolithic or earlier. 

Solar boats or vessels also appear in later Indo-European traditions: in Latvian folk songs the sun goddess Saulė sleeps through the night in a golden boat, whilst in the Atharvaveda the Sun is twice told ‘O Aditya, thou hast boarded a ship of a hundred oars for well-being’. In Greek mythology the Sun&#x27;s vessel takes the form of a golden bowl or cup, which may resemble the bowl-like shape of the Nebra boat. Similar artefacts from the Bronze Age include the ship-like Caergwrle bowl from Wales and minature gold boats from Nors in Denmark. Gold bowls from the later Bronze Age such as from the Eberswalde Hoard in Germany feature circular solar symbols, and some of these may contain calendrical information, including the equivalence of 32 solar and 33 lunar years possibly depicted on the Nebra Disc.

Numerous depictions of solar boats are known from the Nordic Bronze Age, dating from c. 1600 BC onwards. Many of these are flat-bottomed vessels but some have a curved shape similar to the Nebra boat. Some of these depictions show people performing backward bends or backward leaps over ships, which the archaeologist Rune Iversen has connected to similar depictions from Egypt, which show backward-bend dances performed during festivals for the goddess Hathor. They may also be related to a later account from the Roman historian Tacitus, who stated that the Germanic Suebi worshipped the goddess Isis in the form of a ship. Isis was equated with Hathor from the New Kingdom onwards, and both goddesses were associated with the solar barque, often being depicted at the prow of the ship, which they steered and protected. Both were also associated with the goddess Demeter by the later Greeks.

The historians Joseph S. Hopkins and Haukur Þorgeirsson have connected Tacitus&#x27; &#x27;Isis of the Suebi&#x27; with the Norse goddess Freyja, arguing for a strong association between Freyja and ship imagery within Old Norse texts, and particularly with the stone ships of Scandinavia. Both Freyja and her twin brother Freyr have characteristics associated with solar gods, including the golden ship &quot;Skíðblaðnir&quot; belonging to Freyr, which may represent a solar boat. 

====Divine Twins====

According to Kristian Kristiansen the pairs of swords and axes deposited with the Nebra Disc represent the mythological Divine Twins, later known as the Dioscuri in Greece and as the Ashvins in India, among other Indo-European traditions. Similar depositions are known from a number of other Bronze Age burials. Kristiansen further suggests that the constellation of Gemini, which is associated with the Dioscuri, might be represented in the lower part of the Disc next to the solar boat. The archeologist Timothy Darvill has suggested a connection between these paired depositions and the Nebra Disc with the trilithons at Stonehenge, which may also represent an early form of the Divine Twins. The central trilithon in particular may have embodied &quot;a pair of deities representing day and night, the sun and moon, summer and winter, life and death, perhaps even the prehistoric equivalents of the twins Apollo and Artemis as they are known in later pantheons across the Old World.&quot; In Greece Apollo and Artemis were associated with the sun and the moon respectively, whilst the Pleiades were known as &#x27;the companions of Artemis&#x27;, echoing the depiction on the Nebra Disc. According an account recorded by the Greek historian Herodotus, the Egyptians maintained that Apollo and Artemis were the children of Isis, equivalent to the gods Horus and Bubastis, and that Isis was Demeter. 

===Connections with Britain===

Archaeoastronomist Emília Pásztor has argued against a practical astronomical function for the disc. According to Pásztor &quot;the close agreement of the length of the peripheral arcs with the movement of the sun&#x27;s risings or settings might be a pure coincidence&quot;. This claim is undermined by the finding of a similar feature on the roughly contemporary gold lozenge from Bush Barrow at Stonehenge, where the acute angles of the overall design (81°) correspond to the angle between the solstices at the latitude of Stonehenge. According to Euan MacKie (2009) &quot;The Nebra disc and the Bush Barrow lozenge both seem to be designed to reflect the annual solar cycle at about latitude 51° north.&quot; 

MacKie further suggests that both the Nebra disc and Bush Barrow lozenge may be linked to the solar calendar reconstructed by Alexander Thom from his analysis of standing stone alignments in Britain. Both the Nebra sky disc and Bush Barrow lozenge were made with gold from Cornwall, providing a direct link between them. According to the archaeologist Sabine Gerloff the gold plating technique used on the Nebra sky disc also originated in Britain, and was introduced from there to the continent.

== Authenticity ==

There were some initial suspicions that the disc might be an archaeological forgery. Peter Schauer of the University of Regensburg, Germany, argued in 2005 that the Nebra disc was a fake and that he could prove that the patina of the disc could have been created with urine, hydrochloric acid, and a blow torch within a short amount of time. He had to admit in court that he had never held the disc in his own hands, unlike the eighteen scientists who had examined the disc. Scientific analyses of the patina (or corrosion layer) have confirmed its authenticity.

Richard Harrison, professor of European prehistory at the University of Bristol, stated in a BBC documentary that &quot;When I first heard about the Nebra Disc I thought it was a joke, indeed I thought it was a forgery&quot;, due to the extraordinary nature of the find, although he had not seen the sky disc at the time. The same documentary presented scientific analyses confirming the authenticity of the disc.

A paper published in 2020 by Rupert Gebhard and Rudiger Krause questioned the Early Bronze Age dating of the Nebra disc and proposed a later Iron Age date instead. A response paper was published in the same year by Ernst Pernicka and colleagues, rejecting the arguments of Gebhard and Krause. Scientific analyses of the disc, the items found with the disc, and the find spot have all confirmed the Early Bronze Age dating.

== Exhibition ==
The disc was the centre of an exhibition entitled (German &quot;The forged sky&quot;), showing 1,600 Bronze Age artefacts, including the Trundholm sun chariot, shown at Halle from 15 October 2004 to 22 May 2005, from 1 July to 22 October 2005 in Copenhagen, from 9 November 2005 to 5 February 2006 in Vienna, from 10 March to 16 July 2006 in Mannheim, and from 29 September 2006 to 25 February 2007 in Basel.

On 21 June 2007, a multimedia visitor centre was opened near the discovery site at Nebra.

The disc is part of the permanent exhibition in the Halle State Museum of Prehistory (Landesmuseum für Vorgeschichte) in Halle.

The disc was on display at the British Museum in London as part of &quot;The World Of Stonehenge Exhibition&quot; from 17 February to 17 July 2022. The disc was on display at the Drents Museum in Assen from 6 August to 18 September 2022.

== Replica on the ISS ==
In November 2021, a replica of the Nebra Sky Disc was launched to the International Space Station on the Crew-3 mission, taken by German astronaut Matthias Maurer. Maurer, who was part of the European mission Cosmic Kiss, designed the mission&#x27;s patch with inspiration from the Nebra Sky Disk, as well as the Pioneer plaques and Voyager Golden Records that were sent into the unknown carrying messages from Earth.

== Legal issues ==

The state of Saxony-Anhalt registered the disc as a trademark, which resulted in two lawsuits. In 2003, Saxony-Anhalt successfully sued the city of Querfurt for depicting the disc design on souvenirs. Saxony-Anhalt also successfully sued the publishing houses Piper and Heyne over an abstract depiction of the disc on book covers. The Magdeburg court assessed the case&#x27;s relevance according to German copyright law. 

The defenders argued that as a cult object, the disc had already been &quot;published&quot; approximately 3,500 years earlier in the Bronze Age and that consequently, all protection of intellectual property associated with it has long expired. The plaintiff, on the other hand, argued that the of the disc is recent, and according to German law protected for 25 years, until 2027. Another argument concerned the question of whether a notable work of art may be registered as a trademark in the first place. The Magdeburg court decided in favour of the State of Saxony-Anhalt.

The case was appealed and on the basis of decisions from the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf in 2005 and the Federal Court of Justice in 2009, the initial ruling was overturned and the German Patent and Trademark Office withdrew the trademark rights. Thereafter, the state of Saxony-Anhalt registered the design of the disc as a trademark with the European Union Intellectual Property Office.

In 2023, the state of Saxony-Anhalt filed a DMCA take down notice requesting removal of nine images of the Nebra sky disc from Wikimedia Commons, asserting that they were the &quot;owner of the exclusive copyright in the Sky Disk of Nebra&quot;. Wikimedia Deutschland, a chapter of the Wikimedia Foundation, subsequently filed a DMCA counter-notice stating that since the implementation of Article 14 of the Directive 2019/790 of the European Parliament, there can be no such copyrights on reproductions of visual works that are in the public domain.

<text>The County of Nairn, or Nairnshire, () is a historic county, registration county and lieutenancy area of Scotland. The county was named after Nairn, its only town. The county was used for local government until 1975 when the area was redesignated as the Nairn District, one of the eight districts of the two-tier Highland region. Nairn district was abolished in 1996 when Highland became a single-tier council area.

The county borders Inverness-shire to the west and south, Moray to the east, and has a coastline along the Moray Firth to its north.

==History==
The area that would become Nairnshire was anciently part of the Province of Moray, ruled by the Earls or Mormaers of Moray, sometimes as a vassal of the Scottish crown, and at other times as a separate kingdom. The province was finally absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland during the 12th century. In order to secure the Scottish crown&#x27;s authority over the area, it was divided into shires, being areas administered by a sheriff. The old province of Moray was broadly split into the three shires of Elginshire, Nairnshire, and the mainland parts of Inverness-shire.

It is not known exactly when the shire of Nairn, administered by the Sheriff of Nairn, was created; there is some evidence that the area was initially included in Inverness-shire, but from the reign of William the Lion (reigned 1165–1214) there was a separate shire of Nairn. There was also a short-lived shire to the east centred on Forres, which in the early 14th century was grouped with Nairn, before later being united instead with Elginshire.

Over time, Scotland&#x27;s shires became more significant than the old provinces, with more administrative functions being given to the sheriffs. In 1667 Commissioners of Supply were established for each shire, which would serve as the main administrative body for the area until the creation of county councils in 1890. Following the Acts of Union in 1707, the English term &#x27;county&#x27; came to be used interchangeably with the older term &#x27;shire&#x27;.
Elected county councils were established in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, taking most of the functions of the commissioners (which were eventually abolished in 1930). Nairnshire County Council held its first meeting on 22 May 1890 at the Town and County Buildings in Nairn, the county&#x27;s courthouse (built 1818) which also served as the meeting place for the commissioners and for the town council of the burgh of Nairn.
The 1889 Act also led to a review of boundaries to eliminate exclaves. There were several such changes affecting the boundaries of Nairnshire, which had five detached parts: three small areas surrounded by Elginshire, a larger area of moorland at Dunmaglass surrounded by Inverness-shire, and the small village of Urquhart on the Black Isle, surrounded by Ross and Cromarty. Each of these areas was transferred to the county which surrounded them. Parish and county boundaries were also adjusted such that each parish was in a single county, with the exception of the parish of Croy and Dalcross, which was exceptionally allowed to continue to straddle Inverness-shire and Nairnshire. The boundary changes all took effect in 1891.

In 1927 Nairnshire, along with many of Scotland&#x27;s other counties, was granted a coat of arms by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, the governor of Scotland&#x27;s heraldry. The arms was as follows: &quot;Or, a chevron gules, between two water-bougets in chief and a stag&#x27;s head cabossed in base sable, three mullets argent.&quot; The motto was &quot;unite and be mindful&quot;.

Nairnshire was the second least populous of the Scottish counties at the 1921 census, with fewer than 9,000 people. Due to its low population, the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929 combined the county councils of Nairnshire and neighbouring Moray (as Elginshire had been renamed in 1919) for most purposes in 1930. The two councils continued to be elected as separate bodies, but operated together as the &quot;Joint County Council of Moray and Nairn&quot;, serving the combined area of the two counties. Nairnshire County Council did perform some roles alone after 1930, notably acting as the district council for the parts of Nairnshire outside the burgh of Nairn.

Local government was reformed in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which replaced Scotland&#x27;s counties, burghs and landward districts with a two-tier structure of upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. A new Nairn district was created covering the same area as the pre-1975 county. Nairn District Council was a lower-tier district level authority subordinate to the Highland Regional Council. A lieutenancy area covering the same area as the new district was created at the same time. Throughout the district council&#x27;s existence a majority of the seats were held by independents. The district council met at the Town and County Buildings, as the old county council had done, with its offices in the adjoining building at 4 Courthouse Lane.

Further local government reforms in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 saw the regions and districts created in 1975 abolished and replaced with single-tier council areas. The former Highland region became one of the new council areas. The Nairn lieutenancy area continues to be defined as the pre-1996 district of Nairn. The boundaries of the historic county of Nairnshire (as it was following the 1891 boundary changes) are still used for some limited official purposes connected with land registration, being a registration county.

The Highland Council has a number of area committees for debating local matters. One of the committees is called the Nairnshire Committee, comprising the councillors who represent the Nairn and Cawdor ward, which broadly corresponds to the pre-1975 county.

==Geography==
Nairnshire is about 22 miles in length and 15 miles in breadth (35×24 km); comprising an area of , or 128,000 acres. The county consists of a flattish coastal region where the vast majority of the population live, with a sparsely populated hilly interior, rising to the foothills of the Grampian Mountains in the south. These moorlands reach at , on the county march (boundary) just east of summit on the A9. There is no old-established name for these heights, but they have been termed the &quot;Nairnshire Hills&quot;. The coast forms an arc shape, with the Whiteness Head peninsula in the west and The Bar peninsula in the east. The main rivers are the River Nairn and the Findhorn, which both follow deeply incised courses across the general slope northwards. The chief bodies of water are Loch Loy, Cran Loch, Clunas Reservoir, Loch of Boath and Loch Kirkcaldy.

Nairn can be seen from several distant points such as Ben Rinnes, a peak that is a common point of distant view to such places as Inverness-shire and Longman Hill in Banffshire. To the north, Nairn is bounded by the Moray Firth.

===Civil parishes===

Civil parishes are still used for some statistical purposes, and separate census figures are published for them. As their areas have been largely unchanged since the 19th century this allows for comparison of population figures over an extended period of time.

The county consisted of the royal burgh of Nairn (chartered in 1476), the four parishes of Ardclach, Auldearn, Dyke &amp; Moy and Nairn; and most of the parish of Cawdor (also known as Calder), and parts of those of: Croy &amp; Dalcross; Moy &amp; Dalarossie; Petty; and Urquhart &amp; Logie Wester.

==Parliamentary constituencies==
The parliamentary constituency for the Westminster Parliament is Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey and the MP is Drew Hendry of the Scottish National Party.

The parliamentary constituency for the Scottish Parliament is Inverness and Nairn, represented by Fergus Ewing MSP.

==Transport==
The Aberdeen–Inverness railway line runs through the north of the county west–east.

<text>The Berkeley printing system is one of several standard architectures for printing on the Unix platform. It originated in 2.10BSD, and is used in BSD derivatives such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and DragonFly BSD. A system running this print architecture could traditionally be identified by the use of the user command &quot;lpr&quot; as the primary interface to the print system, as opposed to the System V printing system &quot;lp&quot; command.

Typical user commands available to the Berkeley print system are:

*&quot;lpr&quot; — the user command to print
*&quot;lpq&quot; — shows the current print queue
*&quot;lprm&quot; — deletes a job from the print queue

The &quot;lpd&quot; program is the daemon with which those programs communicate.

These programs support the line printer daemon protocol, so that other machines on a network can submit jobs to a print queue on a machine running the Berkeley printing system, and so that the Berkeley printing system user commands can submit jobs to machines that support that protocol.

<doc id="470022" wikidata="Q6519630" url="?curid=470022" title="Leigh Matthews">
<text>Leigh Raymond Matthews (born 1 March 1952) is a former Australian rules footballer and coach. He played for Hawthorn in the Victorian Football League (VFL) and coached and the in the VFL and renamed Australian Football League (AFL).

Squat, short-legged and barrel-chested, Matthews earned the iconic nickname &quot;Lethal Leigh&quot; due to his physical as well as skillful style of play. He is officially recognised as the &quot;best player of the 20th century&quot; according to the AFL, is a &#x27;Legend&#x27; in the Australian Football Hall of Fame, named in the Hawthorn and AFL teams of the century, and is one of the most successful AFL coaches of all time. Following his coaching career, Matthews has had multiple media roles, most notably as an AFL commentator on television with the Seven Network, and on radio with 3AW.

==Early life==

Matthews played his junior football at the Chelsea Football Club. He was part of a footballing family: Matthews&#x27; brother Kelvin played 155 games at Hawthorn and Geelong. Matthews was married and had his first child at 18.

==Playing career==

===Hawthorn===

===1960s===
Matthews joined Hawthorn in January 1969, aged sixteen and having already played senior suburban football. He made his senior debut for the Hawks in Round 16 of the 1969 season against Melbourne as a forward pocket, crumbing around the feet of Hawthorn&#x27;s champion full forward, Peter Hudson. Matthews kicked a goal with his first kick and went on to kick at least one goal in each of his five games that year, winning the club&#x27;s Best First Year Player award. By midway through 1970, Matthews had earned a regular place in the team as a rover rotating forward. He was immediately impressive, kicking 20 goals from 16 games for the season.

===1970s===
Though still a teenager, Matthews became one of the most important players in a dominant Hawthorn team in 1971. He developed an uncanny ability to win contests, especially near the goals. He kicked 43 goals at an average of 1.9 in 1971 and earned his first of fourteen Victorian guernseys, his first of eight Hawthorn best and fairest awards, and his first of four playing premiership medallions.

On 17 July 1971, Matthews notoriously felled one of the game&#x27;s fairest and best rovers, Barry Cable, with an elbow to the head. This was the first in a series of occasional violent lapses that punctuated, and ultimately soiled, Matthews&#x27; stellar career, culminating in his conviction for criminal assault arising out of an on-field incident in 1985.

In Round 2 of 1972, Matthews destroyed North Melbourne for the first of what would end up being many times during his playing career. He kicked 8 goals in the absence of Hudson (who suffered a season-ending knee injury the previous week). Matthews kicked another six goals against South Melbourne in Round 18 and finished the season with 45 goals at 2.1 per game; additionally, he won his second club best and fairest—all this before his 21st birthday.

Matthews made his presence felt early again in 1973 with an amazing 11-goal haul against Essendon in Round 3, also amassing 42 possessions in the same game. The rest of his season was comparatively quiet; however, his total of 51 goals from 19 games was an impressive figure given the increased time he spent in the midfield. By 1974, Matthews had become one of the toughest and most damaging players in the game. Strong, quick and almost impossible to tackle, Matthews regularly turned matches with brilliant solo efforts. Against Collingwood in a semi-final, Matthews proved the difference with 7 goals from 24 disposals. He went on to win his third best and fairest, averaging 21.8 disposals and kicking 52 goals for the season.

After six seasons in the VFL, Matthews established himself as a superstar of the competition in 1975, winning the Coleman Medal as the League&#x27;s leading goal kicker, with 67 goals (68 including finals), while averaging 22.9 disposals per game. While 67 goals was an unusually low tally, it was a rare result for a non-full forward to lead the competition. He started the season brilliantly with 47 goals in the first 12 games, including five bags of 5 or more. His 6 goals from 28 kicks in Round 9 against Footscray was a highlight. He was unable to maintain this pace in the second half of the season and could manage only 21 goals in his last 11 appearances. Hawthorn made the grand final; however, they fell to North Melbourne, with Matthews going goalless on the day.

Another brilliant season in 1976 confirmed Matthews as one of the best players in the game. He kicked more goals than most full-forwards, while also being one of the most effective ball-winners in the game. For the season, Matthews kicked 71 goals at 3.2 per game and averaged 22.5 disposals, winning his fourth best and fairest. His best game for the year came in a qualifying final against North Melbourne, when he had 31 kicks and kicked 7 goals from 13 scoring shots. It was an immense performance in a hard-fought win. Hawthorn again played North in the grand final, and although Matthews was not amongst the best this time, his second premiership medal was just reward for a brilliant season.

In the 1977 season, Matthews went from being from one of the best players in the league to one of the best of all time, with what was among the greatest individual seasons by any player in history. Matthews posted career highs in kicks, marks, handballs and goals, averaging 27.1 disposals per game and kicking 91 goals at 3.8 per game. He had 41 disposals in Round 10 against Melbourne, but the peak of Matthews&#x27; form came during the last eight games of the home-and-away season, during which he averaged 29.8 disposals and 5.1 goals. He kicked 7 goals and had 30-plus disposals three times in seven weeks and finished the season with another 30 disposals and 6 goals against Essendon in Round 22. He won Hawthorn&#x27;s best and fairest for the fifth time. Matthews&#x27; 91 goals that year was a record for goals kicked by a non-full-forward until it was broken in 1990 by Collingwood&#x27;s Peter Daicos (whom Matthews was then coaching).

Matthews&#x27; performances in 1978 further confirmed his status as the game&#x27;s number-one player, as he added another 71 goals to his career tally and averaged 25.5 disposals and a career-high 6.4 marks in a year that saw him win his sixth best and fairest and his third premiership medallion. The Hawks again played North Melbourne in the 1978 VFL Grand Final, but this time a best-afield display of 28 disposals and 4 goals by Matthews ensured the win for Hawthorn.

Matthews was on track for another stellar season in 1979 before injury forced him out of all but two of the last 10 games of the year. A 7-goal performance against Richmond in Round 5 was a highlight in a season that saw him spend less time in front of goals and more in the midfield.

===1980s===
In 1980, Matthews became the captain of Hawthorn, a position he held until his retirement in 1985. He was also selected as captain of the Victorian State of Origin team for the only time in his career, and he won his seventh club best and fairest. This year, Matthews spent less time in the forward line, and while it was the first time since 1971 that he averaged fewer than two goals per game, his 26.9 disposals per game was the second-highest in the league.

Hawthorn opened the 1981 season against Melbourne in Round 1 and Matthews, under a slight injury cloud, lined up at full-forward to great effect. In a dominating performance, he took 10 marks and kicked 11 goals. Matthews missed five games between Rounds 3 and 8 before returning to his customary role, alternating between the forward line and midfield for the rest of the season. He maintained impressive form for most of the year, averaging 23.5 disposals and 3 goals in his 16 games. Matthews finished the season as Hawthorn&#x27;s leading goal kicker and would continue this feat for the next four consecutive years.

After three seasons interrupted by injury and inconsistent form, Matthews returned to his best in 1982, winning the inaugural Players&#x27; Association Most Valuable Player award (which was later renamed, in Matthews&#x27; honour, to the Leigh Matthews Trophy). He kicked 7 goals in Round 16 against North Melbourne and two weeks later against Collingwood kicked 8 more and had 25 disposals. Matthews averaged 22.5 disposals and 3.4 goals per game for the year and won his eighth Hawthorn best and fairest award.

Matthews earned the nickname &quot;Lethal&quot; for his reputation for giving (and taking) very hard bumps, and in 1982 this reputation was enhanced to the point of legend when he famously collided with a behind post at Windy Hill and broke it. A piece of the post (measuring about one metre) broke off, hitting the boundary umpire, after Matthews ran into its base. It is believed that, to comply with a VFL directive, groundsmen at Windy Hill had glued an extension to the top of the post which broke loose after Matthews collided with it. At the time, commentator Lou Richards called him a &quot;He-Man&quot; due to his large size and strength.

Going into his fifteenth season in the VFL, Matthews showed no signs of slowing down in 1983. He averaged 22.3 disposals and 2.9 goals in his first twelve games before, in Round 15, he made the move to full-forward and remained there for the rest of the season. He went on to kick at least three goals in each of the last 10 games of the year, including the grand final, in which he kicked 6 goals and 5 behinds in his fourth premiership win. For the season, he averaged 20.1 disposals and 3.6 goals per game.

===Retirement===
The 1985 season was Matthews&#x27; last as a player. During a wild game versus which was marred by numerous brawls and reports, Matthews struck his opponent Neville Bruns in an off-the-ball incident, breaking Bruns&#x27; jaw. Geelong&#x27;s Steve Hocking exacted swift retribution, breaking Matthews&#x27; nose, and an all-in melee ensued. No report was laid by umpires against Matthews. However, the &#x27;behind play&#x27; incident had been captured on camera. After much public outcry, the VFL launched an investigation and subsequently deregistered Matthews for four weeks. He was also charged with assault and fined $1,000. His conviction was later overturned on appeal. The charge remains the only time a top-level player has been charged for an on-field incident.

Matthews&#x27; 332nd and final game was the 1985 grand final loss to Essendon.

Upon retirement, Matthews had scored 915 goals, which remains the highest VFL/AFL tally by a non-full-forward. At the time of his retirement, it was the fourth-highest tally by any player; he is now ninth in the all-time list. Matthews also accrued 202 Brownlow Medal votes in his career, currently the tenth-most of all time. His tally is the third most by a player who has not won the award, behind Scott Pendlebury and Joel Selwood.

==Coaching career==

===Collingwood===
Following his retirement, Matthews turned to coaching, becoming assistant coach at the Collingwood Football Club before taking over the head coaching role as senior coach from Bob Rose after three rounds in 1986. Matthews guided Collingwood to finish sixth at the end of the 1986 season, just missing out on the finals with twelve wins and ten losses. In the 1987 season, Collingwood under Matthews did not fare much better, where they finished twelfth at the end of the season with seven wins and fifteen losses.

In the 1988 season, Matthews guided Collingwood to finish second on the ladder, but they were eliminated by Melbourne in the semi-final. The following year, Matthews guided Collingwood to finish fifth on the ladder, but they were again knocked out by Melbourne, this time in the elimination final. In the 1990 grand final, the first under the new AFL banner, Collingwood defeated Essendon, ending its 32-year premiership drought generally referred to as &quot;the Colliwobbles&quot;.

In the 1991 season, Collingwood under Matthews just missed out on the finals, where they finished seventh on the ladder. The next season, Matthews guided Collingwood to finish third on the ladder, but they were eliminated by St Kilda in the elimination final. In 1993, Collingwood under Matthews just missed out on the finals, where they finished eighth on the ladder. Matthews returned Collingwood to the finals in 1994 after they finished eighth on the ladder, but were eliminated by the eventual premiers West Coast in the qualifying final.

Matthews was sacked as Collingwood senior coach at the end of the 1995 season, following an unsuccessful year where Collingwood finished tenth on the ladder, thereby missing out on the finals. After the sacking, Matthews stated, “I can see where they&#x27;re coming from, so there&#x27;s animosity. Sometimes you just need a change and sometimes the easiest position to change is the coaching position”. Matthews was replaced by Collingwood premiership captain Tony Shaw as Collingwood senior coach. Matthews coached a total of 224 games in ten seasons with 125 wins, 94 losses and 5 draws for a winning percentage of fifty-five percent with the Magpies. Under Matthews&#x27; guidance, Collingwood won one premiership in 1990, Matthews&#x27; fifth premiership medallion, and for which he would later be retrospectively awarded one of his four Jock McHale Medals.

===Brisbane Lions===
After three years, Matthews was coaxed out of retirement by the struggling Brisbane Lions, who had finished sixteenth, the last on the ladder for the 1998 wooden spoon. Matthews became the senior coach of Brisbane for the 1999 season, when he replaced caretaker senior coach Roger Merrett, who replaced John Northey after Northey was sacked in the middle of the 1998 season. Matthews&#x27; impact at the Lions was immediate, lifting the team from bottom to third on the ladder in 1999 and making the finals, but they were eliminated by eventual premiers the Kangaroos in the preliminary final. The Lions made the finals again in 2000, before being eliminated by Carlton in the semi-final by 82 points.

In 2001, Matthews famously used the &quot;Predator&quot; quote, &quot;if it bleeds, we can kill it&quot;, to inspire his team for its Round 10 game against Essendon, who sat atop the ladder, was the defending premier, and had lost only two of its previous 34 games. Brisbane finished as 28-point victors. Throughout the remainder of the season, the Lions were undefeated, eventually meeting and once again defeating Essendon in the 2001 grand final for their sixteenth consecutive win, and their first AFL premiership in club history. This would be the first of three consecutive premierships for the Lions under Matthews, including Collingwood in both the 2002 grand final and the 2003 grand final. These wins gave Matthews a total of eight premiership medallions as a player or coach. His tenure crested at this point. A bid for a fourth consecutive premiership was brought undone by Port Adelaide in the 2004 grand final, when the Lions lost by 40 points.

In the 2005 season, the Lions finished eleventh on the ladder with ten wins and twelve losses, missing the finals for the first time under Matthews. During the year, after his mother died, Matthews took a leave of absence for one game, which was coached by assistant coach John Blakey. Blakey filled in as caretaker coach in the absence of Matthews for the Round 18 game against the Western Bulldogs, which the Lions lost. In the 2006 season, the Lions did not fare much better, when their form dropped further as they finished thirteenth (third-last) on the ladder with seven wins and fifteen losses. In the 2007 season, the Lions under Matthews finished tenth on the ladder with nine wins, two draws and eleven losses. That year, Matthews coached his 200th game with the club, making him the first person to play or coach 200 games with three clubs. In the 2008 season, the Lions finished tenth on the ladder again for the second straight year in a row, this time with ten wins and twelve losses.

Matthews resigned from his position as Brisbane Lions senior coach on 1 September 2008, at the end of the 2008 season, stating that he &quot;felt the time was right&quot;. Matthews was then replaced by Michael Voss as Brisbane Lions senior coach.

Matthews coached Brisbane Lions to a total of 237 games with 142 wins, 92 losses and 3 draws with a winning percentage of 60 percent. Matthews&#x27; coaching style at the Lions was reportedly incredibly strict, although obviously successful. Despite his four premierships as a coach, Matthews never coached a team to the minor premiership—though he did finish second with Collingwood twice and second with Brisbane three times.

Matthews was named &quot;Player of the Century&quot; and inducted as an inaugural official Legend of the Australian Football Hall of Fame, the highest individual honour that can be bestowed upon a football personality. He was also named in both the AFL and Hawthorn teams of the century, in the forward pocket for the AFL and as rover for Hawthorn. In 2002, the AFLPA MVP award, of which Matthews was the inaugural recipient, was renamed the Leigh Matthews Trophy.

Matthews is one of only four Australian rules footballers recognised as a Legend of Australian Sport in the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, alongside Ron Barassi, Ted Whitten and Bob Skilton.

== Outside football ==

Matthews commentated throughout the 2008 finals series as well as in the 2008 grand Final. He is also a commentator of the game for 3AW and a feature writer and commentator for the &quot;Herald Sun&quot;.

<doc id="470023" wikidata="Q7935859" url="?curid=470023" title="Viscount Valentia">
<text>Viscount Valentia is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It has been created twice. The first creation came in 1621 for Henry Power. A year later, his kinsman Sir Francis Annesley, 1st Baronet, was given a &quot;reversionary grant&quot; of the viscountcy, which stated that on Power&#x27;s death Annesley would be created Viscount Valentia. Annesley, a member of an influential Anglo-Irish family which descended from Newport Pagnell in the County of Buckinghamshire, was a favourite of James I, who granted him land in Ireland, notably the fort of Mountnorris in County Armagh. He was knighted in 1616, created a baronet, of Newport Pagnell in the County of Buckingham, in the Baronetage of Ireland in 1620 and Baron Mountnorris, of Mountnorris in the County of Armagh, in 1628.

In 1642, on the death of Power, he became Viscount Valentia according to the reversionary grant given in 1622. Valentia&#x27;s fourth son Hon. Francis Annesley was the grandfather of William, 1st Viscount Glerawly (3rd son of his father), from whom the Earls Annesley descend. Valentia&#x27;s eldest son and successor, Arthur, the second Viscount, was created Baron Annesley, of Newport Pagnel in the County of Buckingham, and Earl of Anglesey, in Wales, in the Peerage of England, in 1661. Anglesey&#x27;s younger son Altham Annesley was created Baron Altham in the Peerage of Ireland on 14 February 1681.

On the death of the fifth Earl of Anglesey in 1737, the line of the eldest son of the first Earl failed. He was succeeded by his kinsman Richard Annesley, 5th Baron Altham (only surviving son of Richard, 3rd Baron Altham, 3rd son of the first Earl), who became the sixth Earl and seventh Viscount Valentia. However, after his assumption of the Earldom an extraordinary legal battle developed. A Mr James Annesley claimed the earldom and its subsidiary titles as the son of Arthur Annesley, fourth Baron Altham. He alleged that in 1728 he had been removed to an obscure school and that his death had subsequently been announced by his uncle, Richard, the sixth Earl of Anglesey. James was later to have been sold to an American planter as a slave by his uncle. He subsequently escaped to Jamaica and in September 1740 he made his way back to England.

On 11 November 1743, he took action against his uncle to eject him as Baron Altham and to retain his property. Richard&#x27;s defence was that James was not the legitimate son of Mary, second wife of the fourth Baron Altham, but actually the illegitimate son of a Joan Landy. The verdict was in James&#x27; favour, with his uncle being convicted of claiming he was dead and selling him into slavery so that he could take up the title and estates. James&#x27; estates were returned to him but he never took up his titles before his death in 1760 and his uncle continued to be recognised as Earl until he died in 1761.
In 1761, on the death of the sixth Earl, the story took a new twist. His son and heir, Arthur, assumed the titles as the &quot;seventh Earl of Anglesey&quot;. However, Arthur&#x27;s legitimacy was disputed, and on 22 April 1771, the British House of Lords decided that his claim to the English titles of Baron Annesley and Earl of Anglesey were invalid and that they had become extinct upon his father&#x27;s death. However, his claims to the baronetcy of Newport-Pagnell, the baronies of Mountnorris and Altham and the viscountcy of Valentia were twice confirmed by the Irish House of Lords. In 1793 he was compensated when he was created Earl of Mountnorris in the Peerage of Ireland. On the death of his son, the 2nd Earl, the earldom and barony of Altham became extinct, while he was succeeded in the baronetcy, barony of Mountnorris and viscountcy of Valentia by his distant relative, Arthur Annesley, who became the 10th Viscount Valentia. He was fifth in descent from the Honourable Francis Annesley, fourth son of the 1st Viscount, his great-grandfather Francis Annesley having been the elder brother of the first Viscount Glerawly referred to above.

The 11th Viscount, was created Baron Annesley of Bletchington, in the County of Oxford, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom on 7 May 1917. However, this title became extinct on the death of his son, the 12th Viscount, in 1949. The Irish titles were inherited by his distant relative Reverend William Monckton Annesley, who became the 13th Viscount Valentia. He was also a descendant of Hon. Francis Annesley, fourth son of the first Viscount. He was succeeded by his cousin Francis Dighton Annesley, who established his claim to the titles in 1959 and became the 14th Viscount Valentia. He was the son of George Dighton Annesley, uncle of the 13th Viscount.

On the 14th Viscount&#x27;s death in 1983 the titles passed to his son, Richard John Dighton Annesley. He was a Captain in the British Army, then farmed in Zimbabwe and returned to Britain in the early 1980s. As 2014 the titles are held by his son, the 16th Viscount, who succeeded in 2005. Lord Valentia is also the Premier Baronet of Ireland.

The present Viscount has not successfully proven his succession to the baronetcy and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant since 2005, as of 31 December 2013.

<text>The M48 Patton is an American first-generation main battle tank (MBT) introduced in February 1952, being designated as the 90mm Gun M48, armored, full-tracked, combat vehicle of the medium-gun tank class.&quot; It was designed as a replacement for the , M4 Sherman, M46 and M47 Patton tanks, and was the main battle tank of the and U.S. Marine Corps in the Vietnam War. Nearly 12,000 M48s were built, mainly by Chrysler and American Locomotive Company, from 1952 to 1961. The M48 Patton was the first U.S. medium gun tank with a four-man crew, featuring a centerline driver&#x27;s compartment and no bow machine gunner. As with nearly all new armored vehicles it had a wide variety of suspension systems, cupola styles, power packs, fenders and other details among individual tanks.

The early designs, up to the M48A2C, were powered by a gasoline engine. The M48A3 and A5 versions used a diesel engine, however, gasoline engine versions were still in use in the US Army National Guard through 1968 and by many West German Army units through 1975. Numerous examples of the M48 saw combat use in various Arab–Israeli conflicts and the Vietnam War. Beginning in 1959, most American M48A1s and M48A2s were upgraded to the M48A3 model.

The M48 Patton-series saw widespread service with the United States and NATO until it was superseded by the M60 tank. It was widely exported. The tank&#x27;s hull also became the basis for a wide variety of experimental, utility and support vehicles such as armored recovery vehicles and bridge layers. Some M48A5 models served into the mid-1980s with US Army National Guard units, and M48A3s were used as targets for weapons and radar testing into the mid-1990s.

Many M48s remain in service in countries other than the US. Most of these have been modified and their firepower, mobility and protection upgraded to increase their combat effectiveness on the modern battlefield. Turkey is the largest operator with over 750 units in service, Taiwan is second with approximately 500 upgraded variants, and Greece is third with 390 in service.

==History==
After the conclusion of World War II, the United States Ordnance Tank-Automotive Command (OTAC) drastically slowed or canceled many tank development and design programs. On 7 November 1950, the Ordnance Technical Committee mandated a change in the nomenclature for tanks in the US military. It was decided that weight designations (Light, Medium, Heavy) were no longer applicable due to changes in the way tanks were developed and employed on the battlefield, and the varying calibers of main guns now available. Thus the caliber of the gun replaced its weight designation. For example, the M103 Heavy Tank was redesignated as the 120 mm Gun Tank M103 and the Light Tank M41 Walker Bulldog as the 76 mm Gun Tank M41 Walker Bulldog.

The M47 Patton entered production in 1951 and was used by the United States Army and Marine Corps but ongoing technical and production problems kept it from serving in the Korean War. This forced the US to field older tank models, such as the M26 Pershing and M46 Patton. In response, the Army launched several design projects for a replacement of the M46 and M26. The United States entered a period of frenzied activity during the crisis atmosphere of the Korean War, when America seemed to lag behind the Soviet Union in terms of tank quality and quantity.

Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure speedy delivery of new tanks. Such rapid production caused problems but the importance given to rapidly equipping combat units with new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to its quantity production. Notable among these were the T42, T69 and T48 projects as well as continuing to pursue further improvements to the M47.

Compromise was inevitable, but not always welcomed, as General Bruce C. Clarke ironically observed: &quot;We know exactly what we want. We want a fast, highly mobile, fully armored, lightweight vehicle. It must be able to swim, cross any terrain, and climb 30 degree hills. It must be air-transportable. It must have a simple but powerful engine, requiring little or no maintenance. The operating range should be several hundred miles. We would also like it to be invisible&quot;.

===T48 project===
The T48 project was to focus on improving the turret of the M47 Patton and upgrading performance with a more powerful yet more efficient gasoline engine. 1/4 and 1/8 scale design mockups of the turret were constructed during May 1950 using the T119 90mm main gun of the M47 Patton. The design study was accepted by the Army in December and a contract for the advanced production design and engineering (APE) of a 90mm armed tank was awarded to the Chrysler Defense.

Hull redesign included moving the driver&#x27;s station to the front center and removal of the bow-mounted machine gun and its associated crew station, which was converted to safe container storage for additional main gun ammunition. The front glacis was sloped to offer much better ballistic protection than former welded and rather flat designs. An aircraft style steering wheel (a yoke) replaced lever steering. The power pack consisted of the Continental AV-1790-5B gasoline engine producing 704 brake horsepower coupled to an Allison CD-850-4A cross-drive transmission with 2 forward and 1 reverse ranges. The hull armor was increased to on the front glacis of rolled homogeneous steel. It had six roadwheel pairs per side and five return rollers, a torsion bar suspension system, and used T97E2 steel tracks. A new hemisphere-shaped turret eliminated the M47s noted shot traps and lowered the vehicle&#x27;s height.

T48 pilot #1 was constructed by Chrysler Engineering to begin testing at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal Test Center in December 1951. Six prototypes were built in all.

On 27 February 1951, shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War, the Ordnance Technical Committee Minutes (OTCM) #33791 initiated the simultaneous production and design refinement of the new tank, designating the production tanks as the 90mm Gun Tank M48. The Army planned to produce some 9,000 M48s within three years of development. Chrysler Corporation became the principal producer of the tank. Expected production and teething troubles led to the creation of integrating committees to coordinate tank and component development. These Army Combat Vehicle (ARCOVE) committees included military and industrial representatives who provided early warning of defects and recommended remedies.

Testing trials of the T48 tanks began in February 1952 and continued until the end of 1955. However, the perceived immediate threat of Soviet aggression in Western Europe and the ongoing Korean War impelled Army senior leadership to rush the T48 tank into series production before the inevitable bugs could be worked out of the new tank design. Instead, it was decided that any needed design changes uncovered by the continued testing and evaluation of the T48 tanks at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal Test Center would be incorporated into the M48 series production vehicles as quickly as possible.

T48 pilot #1 was designed and constructed by Chrysler Engineering to begin the APE design development at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal Test Center in December 1951. This tank was provisionally armed with the M36/T119 gun using a Y-shaped deflector and a muzzle brake. This gun was not used for production M48 tanks. It used the Mod A hull and turret designs with smaller diameter crew hatches. The driver&#x27;s hatch incorporated a mechanism that dropped his three periscope heads to provide clearance for the hatch door as it swung to the right, and the driver then had to reposition the periscopes by hand once the hatch was closed again. It had 5 return rollers, 6 roadwheel pairs per side with the drive sprocket at the rear and a torsion bar suspension system.

Pilot #2 was built in February 1952 and also used the early Mod A design with small hatches. It was fitted with the T139/M41 90mm gun replacing the muzzle brake with a cylindrical blast deflector. A T-shaped deflector was used for production M48 tanks. This vehicle had two machine guns installed, a .30cal M1919E4 mounted coaxially to the left of the main gun and a .50cal M2HB mounted on the commander&#x27;s cupola. The full image stereoscopic T46E1/M12 rangefinder was placed in the central section of the turret.

Pilot #3 was constructed in November 1952 and used the Mod B hull and turret designs with a simplified, larger diameter hatch that was easier for the driver to operate. Also the front vision block was removable and allowed for the future use of IR vision blocks by the driver. It also had 5 return rollers, 6 roadwheel pairs per side with the drive sprocket at the rear and a torsion bar suspension system. The Mod B turret also had larger hatches for the commander and loader. An additional three hulls were constructed (T48 pilots 4 through 6) in 1953. These tanks were used into 1955 for the component development of the M48A2 production tanks including fire control systems, turret cupolas, suspension configurations and powerpacks. At least one of these hulls was fitted with experimental silica glass composite armor panels.

===Components===

====Armor====
In conjunction with the development of the T48 project there was some discussion regarding armor. The weight of conventional armored steel needed to provide protection against the emerging large-caliber high-velocity main guns and improved APDS kinetic energy penetrators was making its continued use impractical. Composite applique armor panels made with fused silica glass was envisioned to be fitted to the hull. It was also desired that a turret be constructed using this special armor. The OTAC and Carnegie Institute of Technology began development of the armor in November 1952 at Fort Belvoir VA as Project TT2-782/51. This composite armor offered protection against HEAT, HESH, and HE rounds. Its overall slow development limited its use to the T48 and was dropped from consideration in the M48 by 1953, however its development was continued with the T95 Medium Tank until 1958.

There were two different hulls used for the M48 series. The M48 hull had a wedge-shaped front glacis compared to the M46&#x27;s rather flat design. Early Mod A hulls had smaller diameter driver&#x27;s hatches. The suspension consisted of six roadwheel pairs per side with a torsion bar suspension system and five return rollers. The engine exhaust vents were located on the top of the rear deck. There was a dual compensating idler arm at the front, and dual auxiliary track tension wheels behind the last road wheels, using the T97E2 track assembly. The drive sprocket was located at the rear of the hull. Shock absorbers were mounted at the first two and last roadwheel arms. This hull design was manufactured for the original M48 and M48A1 versions of the M48 series. Many Mod B hull designs used for the M48A1 (T48 Pilot #3) were further upgraded to the A2 hull design standard but retained their original 5 return roller configuration.

The M48A2 hull design saw several modifications including a reduction from five to three return rollers per side. The suspension system was simplified, a more compact powerpack compartment and additional fuel cells, with large louvered grill access doors replaced the complicated grill work of the rear engine decks of the M48/M48A1 hull designs. This hull was used on newly constructed M48A2 and M48A3 tanks of the M48 series.

The turret used for the M48 series was hemispherical in shape and was made from cast homogeneous steel. It had a flat gun shield and a standard pop-up styled hatch for the commander and an additional hatch for the loader&#x27;s station. Early production Mod A models of the turret had somewhat smaller diameter hatches. The gunner was provided with an M37 .30 cal machine gun with 5,900 rounds of ammunition.

====Rangefinders and fire control systems====
During WWII and the Korean War, most tanks used a direct sighting system where the gun sights and rangefinders were slaved directly to the gun&#x27;s barrel but its long range accuracy depended upon the focusing abilities of the individual gunner. There are two basic types of optical rangefinders, stereoscopic and coincidence. With a stereoscopic model range determination occurred by measuring the distance from the observer to a target using the observer&#x27;s capability of binocular vision. The coincidence rangefinder uses a single eyepiece. Light from the target enters the rangefinder through two windows located at either end of the instrument. The ARCOVE emphasis upon increased long range accuracy led to the incorporation of a fire control system (FCS) in the M48.

The fire control system included a rangefinder, mechanical ballistic computer, ballistic drive, and gunner&#x27;s sight. Collectively, these mechanical devices resembled in miniature the fire control systems used in naval gunnery. Only after the Second World War did such systems become small enough for use in combat vehicles. These mechanical fire control systems permitted tanks to engage effectively at much longer ranges than in World War II, a critical consideration for the Army, expecting to enter the European battlefield outnumbered. Instead of a gunner&#x27;s sight being slaved to the gun tube, the ballistic computer and drive computed the range and elevated the gun. The gunner&#x27;s primary responsibility lay in keeping the sight on the target. The mechanical ballistic computer made a more accurate computation of range possible by mathematically accounting for such factors as vehicle cant and ammunition type. Many developmental range finders based on pulses of IR light, such as the Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging (OPTAR) rangefinder of the T95 continued into 1957.

====Autoloader systems====
Another requirement of the T48 project was to explore the use of autoloaders for the main gun as they became available. Preliminary experiments with a loading system using the T48 turret were unsuccessful due to the limited space and the need to line up the breech with the loading system after each firing. It also was dropped from consideration for use on the M48 but was further developed on the T69 tank as the 90 mm T178 gun. It was fitted with an eight-round auto-loader system mounted in an oscillating turret.

====90 mm main gun====
ARCOVE also involved the Ordnance Department with the goal of improving the 90 mm gun and its ammunition. The Army expected difficulties in engagements with the Soviet IS-3 heavy tank, since the M47&#x27;s M36/T119 90 mm rifled main gun could not consistently penetrate its frontal armor, even with special armor-piercing capped (APC) or HEAT ammunition. Work was performed to address this by developing the improved T300E53 HEAT ammunition and the T137 series of hypervelocity armor-piercing discarding-sabot (HVAP-DS or simply APDS) ammunition for the M36 gun. The new APDS round could penetrate of homogeneous steel armor, angled at 30 degrees, at a distance of , but was not accepted for service.

Instead it was decided to use an improved version of the 90 mm gun, the T139 for the M48 production tanks. It allowed for easier barrel changing and weighed less than the preceding M36/T119 gun. It was later standardized as the 90mm Gun M41 in February 1951.

====Turret cupolas====
The T48 and M48(Mod A) tanks featured a remote controllable machine gun mount as the tank commander&#x27;s weapon on a pedestal, which allowed him to fire the .50 caliber (12.7 mm) M2HB machine gun from within the vehicle&#x27;s turret. It used a 100-round ammunition box and could also be employed manually by the commander. However, servicing and reloading of the weapon required the tank commander to open his roof hatch and expose his head and upper torso. This remote-controllable mount was designated as the .50 Caliber Machine Gun Mount, M1 and designed by Chrysler Defense Engineering.

By October 1954, the Army decided to amend the design of the tank by installing a cupola. During the production of M48s it was modified several times resulting in a wide mix of cupola styles among individual tanks. Afterwards it was renamed as the Cupola, Tank Commander&#x27;s Caliber .50 Machine Gun, M1. The new tank commander cupola would allow the tank commander to aim and fire his weapon while remaining under armor protection via a remote controlled M2HB machine gun, however the commander had to open the cupola hatch and expose his head to reload or service the machine gun due to the limited headroom. These cupolas had a small rearward opening hatch and a single, non-removable vision block. They were designed by Aircraft Armaments Incorporated. Because of its smaller turret roof hatch opening those M1 cupolas retro-fitted to early production M48 Mod A turrets used an adaptor ring.

The M1E1 cupola design used a G305 cupola riser with 9 non-removable vision blocks installed (some versions had 7 with the 2 rear blocks deleted) between the turret roof and the cupola. It also came with a new bulged hatch cover to provide the tank commander with more headroom and allowed him to reload the weapon while remaining under armor protection. A major drawback of both these cupolas was their inability to mount either daylight or infrared vision devices. The receiver of the M2HB took up a great deal of space in the already cramped cupola&#x27;s interior. Also due to restraints in the cupola, smaller 50 round ammunition boxes were used. Development of its eventual replacement, the T9/M19 cupola of the XM60 tank was continued into and some M19 cupolas were retro-fitted to M48A5s to allow for the use of IR and daylight periscopes by the commander.

===M48===
Chrysler began building the Newark Tank Plant in Newark, Delaware, in March 1951 to produce the M48 while Chrysler Defense Engineering and ARCOVE continued advanced production engineering (APE) to evolve the design using the T48 prototypes at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal. In May 1952 Chrysler agreed to take control of a Government-Owned and Contractor Operated (GOCO) basis of the Newark Tank plant production facility with the US Government and continue production design refinement of the T48 at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal. To meet the urgent need for tanks, production contracts were also awarded to General Motors Fisher Body Division (Grand Blanc Tank Plant) and Ford Motor Company (Livonia Tank Plant) to produce the tank in Michigan starting in April 1952. Also in July 1952 the Army awarded American Locomotive Company a $200 million contract to start producing the tank in 1953 at the Schenectady Tank Plant in New York. All four companies were given initial production contracts in that same year for around 400 tanks each. The first Chrysler production tank was unveiled on 1 July 1952 as the 90mm Gun Tank M48 and christened the M48 Patton by Mrs. Beatrice Ayer Patton, widow of the late General George S Patton.

The M48 featured a gasoline-powered engine, different models were used depending on availability and manufacturer. Originally the M48(Mod A) that was built by Chrysler Defense at the OTAC Test Center (T48 Pilot #1) in 1951 used the Continental AV-1790-5B coupled to a General Motors CD-850-4A cross-drive transmission as used for the M47. The M48s built by American Locomotive used a Continental AV-1790-5C gasoline engine and either an Allison CD-850-4A or 4B cross-drive transmission. Additionally a two-cylinder, gasoline, air-cooled engine (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Little Joe&quot; by tank crews) was provided to power a 28 volt, 300 ampere generator when the main engine was not needed.

Fuel capacity was providing a cruising range of about . The suspension consisted of six roadwheel pairs with a torsion bar suspension system and five return rollers. There was a dual compensating idler arm at the front, and dual auxiliary track tension wheels behind the last road wheels, as had the preceding M46 and M47 tanks. The M48 used the new wide T97E2 track assembly.

It had hydraulic shock absorbers mounted on the first, second and sixth roadwheel pairs (opposite of the M46 and M47). The bow mounted machine gun and its related crew station was eliminated thus providing more ammunition storage for the main gun. The driver&#x27;s station was moved to the front center of the hull. The steering controls were redesigned. A large aircraft-styled steering wheel (replacing the wobble stick control of the M46 and M47) and placing the transmission range selector on the floor to the driver&#x27;s right.

Mod A hulls had a small oval overhead hatch for the driver. T48 Pilots #1 &amp; 2 incorporated a mechanism that dropped the three periscope heads to provide clearance for the hatch door as it swung to the right, and the driver then had to reposition the periscopes by hand once the hatch was closed again. The vehicle did not have an NBC protection system for the crew and a fording depth of approximately . It had a crew of 4; the commander, gunner and loader were positioned in the turret and the driver stationed in the front center of the hull.

The M48&#x27;s turret consisted of a redesigned flat gun shield and standard pop-up hatch for the commander&#x27;s station. The M48 Mod A turret design had smaller roof hatches for both the commander and loader. A .50 cal M2HB using a M1 remote control mount on a pedestal was available for the commander. When not in use, the machine gun mount could be stowed on a bracket welded to the turret roof in front of the loader. The M48&#x27;s direct fire control system consisted of an M12/T41 stereoscopic rangefinder with a field of view of 5 degrees and magnification of x7.5, an azimuth indicator, an M20 gunner&#x27;s periscope and a T13 super elevation actuator. Two main bearings are bolted to the mounting plate on the roof of the tank turret to support the range finder on steel radial ball bearings. A parallel gun linkage between the gun trunnion and the range finder assures that the line of sight of the range finder reproduces the exact motion of the gun in elevation.

A .30 caliber M1919E4 machine gun was coaxially mounted to the main gun&#x27;s left and was operated by the gunner. An M12 full field optical range finder was used, the same as the M47. The tank was not fitted with any night fighting or computerized fire control systems. Some early production M48s used a Y-shaped blast deflector on the barrel and carried 53 rounds. Eight ready rounds were stored in the left side of the turret bustle for the loader, the rest were stored inside safe containers in the hull. Tank crews complained that the Y-shaped fume extractor was found to be prone to snagging brush. It was replaced with a T-shaped model early in production.

These early M48 tanks suffered from engine, transmission, track, and suspension problems. The first production vehicles suffered from excessive oil consumption and engine failures after only 1,000 mi (1,600 km). The gasoline engine managed only 0.33 mpg US (0.14 km/L), limiting range to 75 miles (121 km). The M12/T41 rangefinder was too fragile and often broke. Army Field Forces (AFF) found these tanks to be unsuitable for combat use in Europe and was regulated to limited use by US Army CONUS units until numerous shortcomings were corrected. Furthermore, some 120 hulls were found to have insufficient hull armor protection. These were denoted as the M48C and relegated by the Continental Army Command (CONARC) for non-ballistic training use by the Armor School at Fort Knox to train crewmembers and maintenance personnel.

===M48A1===

The Army concluded in January 1952 that the T42 had failed as a tank capable of combat in Europe against Soviet tanks and reached the same conclusion in November 1953 for the M48 Mod A versions. The M48A1 focused on improving the engine and the vehicle&#x27;s operational range and fixing numerous mechanical problems. To cope with the lack of range, an add-on modification allowed the use of 4 external jettisonable fuel drums of MOGAS (motor gasoline) that was mounted to the rear deck, extending the range to . This proved very unpopular with tank crews and operational range remained unsatisfactory.

Further ARCOVE changes included a desire for the commander to observe and operate his weapons station while remaining under armor protection. At this same time the US Army Field Forces (AFF) declared the T42 medium tank unfit for production in November 1952, mainly due to serious shortcomings of its hull design. Ford&#x27;s production of the M48 ended in August 1953 after a fire destroyed most of the Livonia Tank Plant.

Testing and feedback from ARCOVE had uncovered the fact that the original driver&#x27;s hatch design of the M48 Mod A hull&#x27;s design (T48 pilots #1 and 2) tanks proved to be too small and made for an uncomfortable seating position for the driver when operating the tank with his hatch in the open position. To rectify this problem a new larger driver hatch was devised that was introduced into series production vehicles as early as possible. Also the driver&#x27;s front vision block was removable and could be replaced with an infrared IR vision block. A redesigned power pack featured an AV-1790-7B gasoline engine and CD-850-4B transmission. The turret was fitted with the M1 cupola that enclosed the M2HB machine gun. Cupolas fitted on those tanks with early production Mod A turrets used an adapter ring. In April 1953, the Army standardized this configuration as the 90mm Gun Tank M48A1 Patton and originally applied this designation to both the early Mod A hull design and the Mod B hulls currently in series production.

Between April 1952 and December 1954, nearly 7,000 M48s and M48A1s were produced, with production contracts for an additional 2,500 tanks to be built through 1956. Army units in Europe immediately received 2,120 of these early M48A1 tanks, but correction of ARCOVE defects discovered after production delayed the fielding of the remaining tanks. The Marines Corps however continued to use the M47 Patton. The M48A1&#x27;s width proved too wide for many European tunnels, complicating rail transport. Operational readiness rates of M48-equipped units tended to be low. The tanks continued experiencing engine, transmission, track, and suspension problems, and the M12 stereoscopic rangefinder was uncomfortable to operate.

However, the M48A1 was considered an even match for its Soviet counterpart, the T-44 and fielded to combat units in Europe. On 25 October 1954, the Army decided to amend its designation of the M48 tank. Thereafter, the tanks with the original Mod A hull design and the Chrysler-designed M1 remote-control machine gun mount attached to the tank commander&#x27;s pop-up hatch would remain the 90mm gun tank M48. However, all those tanks with the Mod B hull (some production M48A1 tanks had the Mod B turret) and fitted with the new small turreted M1 cupola armed with a .50 caliber M2HB machine gun would be designated as the 90mm gun tank M48A1. M48A1 tanks with 5 return rollers and the ModB driver&#x27;s hatch were modified to the M48A2 hull configuration. The hull&#x27;s armor framing for the engine compartment was modified. In addition detachable headlights, armored boxes around the taillights, newly redesigned mudguards, an updated fuel delivery system and a tank infantry phone were added.

===M48A2===
The concurrent testing of the T48 and production of the M48 was the source of widespread debate among Congressional Budget Oversight committees. The Bureau of the Budget believed that the Army was not progressing with sufficient speed in its tank modernization program and recommended the immediate replacement of the M48A2 as well as better quality control. Under the ARCOVE&#x27;s &quot;single, efficient producer&quot; model, Defense Secretary Charles Erwin Wilson directed the Army to reduce the number of contractors producing each model of tank. In a new round of production bids for the M48A2, General Motors underbid Chrysler, and in September 1953 Army Secretary Robert T. Stevens awarded GM&#x27;s Fisher Body division a $200 million contract to become the sole producer of the M48A2 and started production at its Grand Blanc Tank Plant in Michigan in April 1953.

The decision raised skepticism among lawmakers. Senator Estes Kefauver noted the move would effectively leave GM as the only producer of light (the M41 Walker Bulldog) and medium tanks when the Chrysler production contract for M48A1 production was set to expire in April 1956. Months later Chrysler underbid GM in the new round of bidding. In September 1954 the Army awarded Chrysler an exclusive $160.6 million contract to restart production. In November 1955 the Army awarded American Locomotive Company a $73 million contract to begin producing 600 M48A2s the next year at the Schenectady Tank Plant, New York.

However Alco opted to wrap up its tank business when its contract ended in July 1956. In May the Army awarded Chrysler, the only bidder, a $119 million contract to continue production of the M48A2 at the Delaware Tank Plant. In December 1955 Chrysler took on orders initially intended for the American Locomotive after Alco opted production cutbacks to its tank program and became the only manufacturer of the tank by the end of 1956.

During the ARCOVE Questionmark III conference in June 1957 it was predicted that the Congress would not approve the procurement of the M48A2 after the fiscal year 1959. However, the ongoing T95 Tank Program was progressing slowly as its new technologies were being developed. Several ideas were proposed to replace the M48A2. General Bruce C. Clarke wrapped competing and even conflicting desires in irony, observing that &quot;We know exactly what we want. We want a fast, highly mobile, fully armored, lightweight vehicle. It must be able to swim, cross any terrain, and climb 30-degree hills. It must be air-transportable. It must have a simple but powerful engine, requiring little or no maintenance. The operating range should be several hundred miles. We would also like it to be invisible&quot;.
Some ideas proposed were to utilize a nuclear fission power plant in the R-32 or a vapor-cycled power plant fueled by hydrocarbons in the Chrysler TV-8 tank. In response to these findings an eventual replacement for the M48A2 was recommended. ARCOVE and the Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics (DCSLOG) submitted a proposal for a tank based on the M48A2 featuring improved firepower and a compression ignition engine and started the design development of the XM60 in September 1957.

The engine deck was redesigned with two large louvered doors that replaced the complicated grill work of the rear engine decks of the M48/M48A1 hull designs. This new rear hull arrangement on the M48A2 tank helped in cooling the engine and minimizing the infrared (heat) signature of the vehicle. The suspension system was simplified. The track tensioner arm was eliminated, modifications to the idler arm, the addition of bumper springs and friction snubbers, and a relocation of the air cleaner assembly. The number of return rollers was reduced to 3 per side. With the more compact AVI-1790-8 engine, additional fuel tanks were installed in the engine compartment, increasing fuel capacity to 335 gallons. Many older model M48A1s were rebuilt to this production configuration but retained their original 5 return rollers per side.

The M48A2C saw improvements for the turret implementing the Mod B turret design with larger hatches for the commander and loader. The M12 rangefinder was replaced with a full-field coincidence model along with an improved turret control system. The M13 Fire Control System (FCS) consists of the M5A2 ballistic drive and mechanical M13A3 gun data computer which integrated barrel temperature data with an M17 coincidence range finder. The rangefinder is a double image coincidence image instrument used as the ranging device of the gunner&#x27;s primary direct sighting and fire control system. The gunner is provided with an M20 day periscope with a magnification of x8 and an M105D day telescopic sight with a magnification of x8 and a field of view of 7.5 degrees.

Range information from the rangefinder is fed into the ballistic computer through a shaft. The ballistic computer is a mechanically driven unit that permits ammunition selection, range correction, and superelevation correction by the gunner. The ballistic drive receives the range input and, through the use of cams and gears, provides superelevation information to the superelevation actuator. The superelevation actuator adds sufficient hydraulic fluid to the elevating mechanism to correctly position the gun.

M48A2s were widely deployed to both the US Army and US Marine Corps fully replacing the M47 Patton in combat units as well as being exported to NATO allies and foreign governments. In 1967 M48A2 tanks still in service with National Guard units were upgraded to the A3 configuration. The M48A2 hull received modified armored boxing around the taillights, an updated fuel delivery system and a tank infantry phone (TIP). The gasoline engine was replaced with the AVDS-1790-2A. They remained in CONUS training use with the Army National Guard through 1979.

===M48A3===
Citing high fuel consumption, poor low-end torque, and the extreme fuel flammability of gasoline engines, ARCOVE industrial representatives had expressed desires for a diesel engine for the M48 since 1953. Continental Motors and OTAC began to develop an experimental X-shaped vapour-cycled engine design powered by hydrocarbons in 1954 for the T95 tank but it remained unreliable. In June 1955, OTAC adopted the recommendations and allowed a diesel engine to be used if it significantly improved fuel economy.

By August 1956 the diesel powered AVDS-1790 was recommended as meeting this requirement, and the Army requested the initial retrofitting of approximately 1,020 older M48A1s and A2s with the new engine in December. By February 1957, the Army had around 600 converted M48A3 Patton tanks and the Marine Corps had received 419. Because many M48A3 tanks were conversions from earlier models many details varied among individual examples of this type. M48A3 tanks could have either three or five support rollers on each side and might have either the early or later type headlight assemblies, some retained their earlier Mod A turrets and different cupola styles. 

During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, a Soviet T-54A medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the UK&#x27;s embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians. After a brief examination of this tank&#x27;s armor and 100 mm gun by a British military attaché, the UK decided that their 20 pounder (84mm L/66.7) was apparently incapable of defeating it. There were also rumors of an even larger 115 mm gun in the works. In response to this the US Army started development of the XM60 to replace the M48 tank series and incorporating the ARCOVE recommendation of a more powerful main gun, the Royal Ordnance L7 (105mm T254). Instead of immediately getting a 105mm main gun, large stockpiles of 90 mm main gun ammunition and funding shortfalls that made it impossible to supply enough 105mm main gun rounds for all the planned tank conversions left the M48A3s with their M41 90mm guns.

In addition to the conversion of older model M48s, Chrysler continued to build new vehicles. These used the M48A2 hull design (with 3 return rollers) and had redesigned fenders and mudguards, armored boxes around the taillights among other minor details. They were fitted with another re-designed commander&#x27;s cupola, the M1E1. It had a modified hatch to allow more room in comparison to the previous M1 cupola and the two rear vision blocks were eliminated. The driver&#x27;s steering wheel was replaced with a T-bar control and received a padded seat. M48 procurement for the Army ceased and M48A2 hull production ended in May 1961. The Newark Tank plant was closed in October. This newest version of the M48 series received the designation Tank, Combat, Full-Tracked; 90mm Gun, M48A3 on 19 March 1958.

The M48A3 was withdrawn from Europe by October 1961, being replaced by the M60 tank. As US armored and cavalry units rotated out of combat deployments to South Vietnam most of their M48A3s were either directly transferred to the South Vietnamese army or to Thailand. FORSCOM withdrew the M48A3 from combat service with both the US Army and US Marine Corps in 1973, replacing them with the M60A1. Some M48A3s continued in service with National Guard units until 1979. Some were repurposed as Armoured vehicle-launched bridges (AVLBs). Afterwards they were relegated to target use for the testing of radar and weapons systems until the mid 1990s. They were replaced in this role by the QM60.

===M48A4===
While the M60A1E1, later standardized as the M60A2, was under development, it appeared there would be many leftover M60 turrets, this resulted in a plan to transfer these turrets to M48A1 hulls modernized to the M48A3 standard. The turrets were essentially the same, although fitted with different guns, rangefinders and commander&#x27;s cupolas. However, the M60 turret featured a deeper basket necessitating the addition of spacers on the turret ring which elevated the turret by 2 inches. Also, the ammunition stowage had to be rearranged to accommodate the 105 mm ammunition, which was done by modifying the M60A1 racks.

Two of these tanks were built, with one being sent to Fort Knox during the spring of 1967, the program was approved to retrofit 243 M48A1 tanks to this new configuration. The tank was planned to be designated as the 105 mm Gun, Full-Tracked, Combat Tank M48A4, however due to the decision to limit the amount of M60 tanks converted to M60A2s, the project was cancelled with no more tanks being built.

===M48A5 ===
Retrofitting M48 with a 105 mm gun, which fit nicely in its turret, and the M60 powerpack, was an obvious idea explored since 1958, and M48A1E1 tank passed the trials in 1960. However, the cost of replacing large stores of 90 mm ammunition was considered too high, and the idea dragged without adoption for a decade and a half until the 90 mm gun became hopelessly obsolete.

The Yom Kippur War in 1973 demonstrated high attrition rates of tanks due to ATGMs and, besides diverging hundreds of American tanks to make up Israeli losses, forced the US Army to raise its inventory objectives from 8,300 initially to 10,300 and by 1976 to 14,400 tanks. The opened gap had to be closed as quickly and cheaply as possible, so it was decided to rearm and re-engine reserve M48s. The program cost on average under $170,000 per tank ($110,000 for diesel M48A3s and $236,000 for gasoline M48A1/A2Cs), which was about three times cheaper than a new M60A1.
The last major US upgrade of the M48 tank series was initially designated XM736, then M48A3E1 and was finally standardized as M48A5 in May 1975.

This conversion upgrade was applied to M48A3 versions still in service with Army National Guard units in order to maintain the training levels of Guard units as well as using a commonality in ammunition amongst tanks. The upgrade featured the mounting of the M68 105 mm gun carried in the M116 mount and the all-metric measurement M16 fire control system. The hull was upgraded by applying the M60A1 RISE Hull PIP Update Kit and incorporated as many of the components as possible.

Some of these included the retrofit of the AVDS-1790-2C RISE diesel engine incorporating TLAC engine panels coupled to with a CD-850-6 cross-drive transmission, a 300-gallon fuel capacity and the T142 track assembly, M13A1 NBC protection system for the crew and the replacement of the .30 caliber M37 coaxial machine gun with the 7.62mm NATO M219/T175 machine gun. Because all M48A5 tanks were conversions from earlier models, many characteristics varied among individual examples of this type. M48A5 tanks could have either three or five support rollers on each side and might have either the early or later type headlight assemblies, some retained their earlier cupola styles.

Starting in 1975 M48A3 tanks that were still in service with the Army National Guard were converted to the M48A5 standard. These tanks were initially converted from former M48A3 tanks using the M48A1 hull design (with 5 return rollers) and given the designation M48A5PI. But, after August 1976 these early hull conversions were further upgraded, the Product Improvement (PI) designation was removed, and these tanks were redesignated as the M48A5. By March 1978, 708 M48A5 tanks had been converted from the M48A1 hull model.:242 In conjunction with the conversion of M48A1 tank hulls, the conversion of M48A3s mated to M48A2 hulls (with 3 return rollers) to the M48A5 standard was also implemented in 1976. The conversion program ran from October 1975 to December 1979 with a total of 2,069 M48A3s converted to the A5 standard.:242
They were used by Guard units in CONUS to maintain their training levels and proficiency. In May 1987, at Fort McCoy, 1st Battalion, 632nd Armor Regiment of the Wisconsin Army National Guard retired the last M48 tanks in the US military. The tanks were parked in a holding pen at the WI ARNG Mobilization and Training Equipment Site (MATES) and later transferred to the Moroccan Army. They were replaced in National Guard service by the M60A3. However many other countries continue to use these M48 models.

Israel&#x27;s wartime experiences with their M48/E48C Magach tanks spurred the IDF to implement its own changes. These included replacing the M1 cupola with a low-profile &quot;Urdan&quot; type that mounted an M60D machine gun for use by the tank commander. A second M60 machine gun was mounted on the turret roof for use by the loader. Internal ammunition stowage for the 105mm main gun was also increased to 54 rounds. Many of them were fitted with Blazer ERA panels.

=== E48 series ===
M48s for use in foreign military service were designated as the E48 series by the US Foreign Military Sales (FMS). These were essentially M48s with minor modifications requested by approved foreign purchasers. Some of the modifications included removal of the M1 cupola, different models of machine guns, electronics, fire control systems or radios, external armor plates, smoke launchers and power packs. Israel purchased many of these tanks forming the genesis of the Magach series.

This series included the following designations:

*E48: modified M48/M48A1 variant for non-US service
*E48A: modified M48A2 variant for non-US service
*E48B: modified M48A3 variant for non-US service
*E48C: modified M48A5 variant for non-US service
*E48 AVLB: modified M48 AVLB variant for non-US service

==Combat service==
===Vietnam War===
The M48 saw extensive action with the US military during the Vietnam War. Over 600 Pattons would be deployed with US forces during that war. The initial M48s first landed with the US Marine 1st and 3rd Tank Battalions in 1965, with the 5th Marine Tank Battalion later becoming a back-up/reinforcement unit. The remaining Pattons deployed to South Vietnam were in three US Army battalions, namely the 1-77th Armor near the DMZ (67 M48A2C (23 tanks supplied from US Army Training Center at Fort Knox, and 44 tanks from Letterkenny Army Depot) tanks were used by the 77th Armor from August 1968 to January 1969.

These were later replaced with M48A3s, the 1-69th Armor in the Central Highlands of central South Vietnam and the 2-34th Armor positioned near the Mekong Delta. Each battalion consisted of approximately 57 tanks. M48s were also used by Armored Cavalry Squadrons in Vietnam until replaced by M551 Sheridan Armored Reconnaissance Airborne Assault Vehicles (ARAAV) in the Divisional Cavalry Squadrons. M48A3 tanks remained in service with the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment until the unit was withdrawn from the conflict. Some M48 variants, nicknamed &quot;Zippos&quot;, or M67A1 Flame tanks were used by some U.S Marine Corps units, but the U.S. Army no longer used them. From 1965 to 1968, 120 US M48A3 tanks were written off.

The M48 Patton has the distinction of playing a unique role in an event that was destined to radically alter the conduct of armored warfare. When US forces commenced redeployment operations, many of the M48A3 Pattons were turned over to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces, in particular creating the battalion-sized ARVN 20th Tank Regiment, which supplemented their M41 Walker Bulldog units. During the North Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) Easter Offensive in 1972, tank clashes between PAVN T-54/PT-76 and ARVN M48/M41 units became commonplace.

On 23 April 1972, tankers of the 20th Tank Regiment were attacked by a PAVN infantry-tank team, which was equipped with the new &quot;9M14M Malyutka&quot; (NATO designation: Sagger) wire-guided anti-tank missile. During this battle, one M48A3 Patton tank and one M113 Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle (ACAV) were destroyed, becoming the first losses to the Sagger missile; losses that would echo on an even larger scale a year later during the Yom Kippur War in the Middle East in 1973. By 2 May, the 20th Tank Regiment had lost all of their tanks to enemy fire. During the first month of the First Battle of Quảng Trị, all ARVN M48 Pattons (100 tanks) were lost.

The M48s performed admirably in South Vietnam in the infantry-support role. However, there were few actual tank-versus-tank battles. One was between the US 1-69th Armor and PT-76 light amphibious tanks of the PAVN 202nd Armored Regiment at Ben Het Camp in March 1969. The M48s provided adequate protection for its crew from small arms, mines, and rocket-propelled grenades. South Vietnamese M48s and M41s fought in the 1975 Spring Offensive. In several incidents, the ARVN successfully defeated PAVN T-34 and T-55 tanks and even slowed the North&#x27;s offensive.

However, due to shortages of fuel and munitions faced by the South Vietnamese military because of the US Congress-placed ban on the further funding and supply of military equipment and logistics to the country, the American-made tanks soon ran out of ammunition and fuel and were quickly abandoned to the PAVN, which then put them in their service after the war ended in May 1975. In total, 250 of the ARVN&#x27;s M48A3s were destroyed and captured and those captured (at least 30) were only used briefly before being phased out and turned into war-memorial displays all over Vietnam.


 M48s, along with Australian 20 pounder (84 mm)-gunned Centurions of the 1st Armoured Regiment, were the only vehicles in use by the anti-communist side in the Vietnam War that could reasonably protect their crews from land mines. They were often used for minesweeping operations along Highway 19 in the Central Highlands, a two-lane paved road between An Khe and Pleiku. Daily convoys moved both ways along Highway 19. These convoys were held up each morning while the road was swept for mines. At that time, minesweeping was done by soldiers walking slowly over the dirt shoulders of the highway with hand-held mine detectors.

During this slow process, convoys would build up into a dangerously inviting target for the enemy, especially their guerillas and partisans. As a result, a faster method was improvised, the &quot;Thunder Run&quot;, in which one M48 lined up on each side of the road, with one track on the dirt shoulder and the other track on the asphalt, and then with all guns firing, they raced to a designated position miles away. If the M48s made it without striking a mine, the road was clear, and the convoys could proceed. In most cases, an M48 that struck a land mine in these operations only lost a road wheel or two in the explosion; seldom was there any hull damage that would be considered a catastrophic kill.

Supply of M48A3 tanks to South Vietnam:

* 1971: 54.
* May 1972: 120.
* October 1972: 72.
* November 1972: 59.
* January 1973 - July 1974: 16.
* Total: at least 321 M48 tanks.

According to official US data 343 M48s were delivered to the ARVN up to March 1975., all of which were destroyed or captured.

The United States lost at least 123 M48 tanks (non-repairable) during the war. As a result, the United States with South Vietnam lost about 500 M48 tanks.

===Indo-Pakistani wars===


M47s and M48s were used in tank warfare by the Pakistan Army against the Indian Army&#x27;s Soviet T-55s, British Centurions and US M4 Sherman tanks in both the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 as well as the following war in 1971 with at least some good results. During Operation Grand Slam Pakistani tank forces, composed mainly of M47 and M48 Patton tanks, thrust through the Indian defense-lines very quickly and swiftly defeated Indian Army armored counterattacks. At the Battle of Chumb, India&#x27;s only tank battalion in the region was wiped out.

The Pakistanis used approximately a division&#x27;s worth of tanks in the operation, although not all were Pattons, with upgraded Shermans included as well. In contrast, Pakistan&#x27;s Patton tank failed to live up to its high expectations in the Battle of Asal Uttar in September 1965, where about 97 Pakistani tanks were lost, the majority of them being Pattons (M47s and M48s). Later, the Patton tank was the main Pakistani tank at the Battle of Chawinda and its performance at that battle was deemed satisfactory against Indian armor.

The Patton was later used by Pakistan again, this time, in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. A counterattack led by the 13th Lancers and the 31st Cavalry army units was defeated by the Indian 54th Division around Battle of Barapind in December 1971. The Pakistan Army Patton tanks could not stop an assault by Indian T-55 Soviet-supplied tanks of the 2nd Armored Brigade. At least 9 of the Pattons were destroyed by T-55 tanks during the battle of Nainakot. It total, more than 80 Pakistani Pattons were knocked out during the war, mainly by Centurion and T-55 fire.

India later set up a temporary war-memorial so named &quot;Patton Nagar&quot; (or &quot;Patton City&quot;) in Khemkaran District in Punjab, where the captured Pakistani Patton tanks were displayed for a short period of time before being scrapped or sent all across India for use as war monuments and military memorials.

Analyzing their overall performance in their wars with India, the Pakistani military held that the Patton was held in reasonably-high esteem by both sides and that combat-tactics were to blame for the setback at Asal Uttar. However, a post-war US study of the tank battles in South Asia concluded that the Patton&#x27;s armor could, in fact, be penetrated by the 20-pounder tank gun (84 mm) of the Centurion (later replaced by the even-more successful L7 105mm gun on the Mk. 7 version which India also possessed) as well as the 75 mm tank gun of the AMX-13 light tank.

===Middle East===
M48s were also used with mixed results during the Six-Day War of 1967. On the Sinai battlefront, Israeli M48s upgunned with the then-advanced 105 mm L7 rifled tank gun were used with considerable success against Egyptian IS-3s, T-54s/T-55s, T-34/85s and SU-100s supplied by the Soviet Union during the 1950s and the 1960s (such as during the Second Battle of Abu-Ageila. On the Sinai front, Israel lost 50 M48 tanks of 117: 39 M48A2C and 11 M48A3. However, on the West Bank war-front, Jordanian M48s (Jordan was also a user of the M48 Patton as was Israel at the same time-period) were often defeated by Israeli 105mm-armed Centurions and WWII-era upgraded M4 Shermans - M-51s upgunned with French-built 105 mm tank guns, not to be confused with the British L7 105mm tank gun.

In purely technical terms, the Pattons were far superior to the much-older Shermans, with shots at more than 1,000 meters simply glancing off the M48&#x27;s armor. However, the 105 mm main gun of the Israeli Shermans fired a HEAT round designed to defeat the Soviet T-62 tank, which was the USSR&#x27;s response to the M48&#x27;s successor in US service, the M60 tank. The Jordanian Pattons&#x27; general failure on the West Bank could also be attributed to excellent Israeli air superiority. The Israeli Army captured about 100 Jordanian M48 and M48A1 tanks and pressed them into service in their own units after the war, as were the Jordanian M113 APCs they seized during the war.

Israel used 445 M48 tanks in 1973 during the Yom Kippur War. From 15 to 18 October, M48 tanks participated in the largest tank battle of the war - Battle of the Chinese Farm. The battle involved the Egyptian 21st Armored Division (136 T-55s), 25th Armored Brigade (75 T-62s), tank battalion (21 T-55s) from 24th Armored Brigade (in the total 232 Egyptian tanks) and the Israeli 143rd and 162nd Armored Divisions (about 440 tanks).
The battle ended with an Israeli victory, but both sides lost a huge number of tanks in this battle (each side lost about two hundred tanks). On the night of 15/16 October, the Israeli 14th Brigade of the 143rd Division lost 70 tanks out of 97. Between the 16th at 0900 and the 17th at 1400, the Israeli 143rd and 162nd Divisions have lost 96 tanks. As of 18 October, the Egyptian 21st Armored Division had no more than 40 tanks remaining of an original 136 tanks available at the start of the battle, 25th Armored Brigade had only 10 tanks of an original 75 T-62s.

Totally, when the Yom Kippur War broke out, Israel had 540 M48-series (with 105 mm gun) and M60/M60A1 tanks. During the war, the tanks suffered heavy losses. The location of flammable hydraulic fluid at the front of the turret was discovered to be a severe vulnerability. Egypt had destroyed a large number of Israeli tanks, and after the war, only 200 M48 and M60A1 tanks remained. Israel entrenched most of these tanks in the Sinai front against opposite entrenched Egyptian infantry armed with 9M14 Malyutka anti tank missiles.

Aside from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the M48 was also operated by the Lebanese Army, the Christian Lebanese Forces militia, the Druze Progressive Socialist Party&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army militia, the Shia Amal militia and the South Lebanon Army. All the tanks seized by the militias were captured from the Army&#x27;s mostly Druze 4th Infantry Brigade which collapsed due to sectarian divisions in 1983. On 10 June 1982, eight Israeli M48A3s, two M60A1s and at least three M113 APCs were lost in a successful ambush by Syrian T-55 tanks and BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) during the Battle of Sultan Yacoub in 1982.
The Lebanese Army still operates about 100 M48s. In 2007, during the 2007 North Lebanon conflict, Lebanese Army M48s shelled militant outposts located in a refugee camp.

Together with the M47, M48 tanks were used by the Turkish Armed Forces during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. The Turkish Armed Forces in Northern Cyprus continue to use M48 tanks today.

When the Kurdish–Turkish conflict began, the Turkish Armed Forces had a number of M48s. These were used throughout the 1980s and the 1990s as static artillery and was used in defending military-base perimeters from enemy attacks.

Iranian M48 tanks were used widely in the Iran–Iraq War from 1980 to 1988, where they faced Iraqi T-55s, T-62s and T-72s, alongside M60 Pattons, in fierce and harsh combat with their Iraqi foes, with mixed results. M48s of the 37th Armored Brigade were used in the Battle of Abadan. About 150 M48s were lost in this tank battle alone.

===Africa===
In 1973, Morocco took delivery of its first M48A3s. By the end of the 1970s, further deliveries of M48A5 had occurred and the upgrade to M48A5 was achieved locally with the aid of US consultants. In 1987, a final shipment of 100 M48A5 tanks from the Wisconsin National Guard was delivered to the Moroccan army. There are unconfirmed reports of deliveries of Israeli M48A5s during the 1980s. The tanks were used in the Western Sahara desert against Polisario guerrillas.

Pakistan used M48 Pattons while reinforcing American troops during the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993.

<text>The M47 Patton was an American medium tank, a development of the M46 Patton mounting an updated turret, and was in turn further developed as the M48 Patton. It was the second American tank to be named after General George S. Patton, commander of the U.S. Third Army during World War II and one of the earliest American advocates of tanks in battle.

The M47 was the U.S. Army&#x27;s and Marine Corps&#x27; primary tank, intended to replace the M26 Pershing and M46 Patton medium tanks. The M47 was widely used by U.S. Cold War allies, both SEATO and NATO countries, and was the only Patton series tank that never saw combat while in US service.

Although the later M48s and M60s were similar in appearance, those were completely new tank designs. Many different M47 Patton models remain in service internationally. The M47 was the last US tank to have a bow-mounted machine gun in the hull.

==Design==
Although a new power plant corrected the mobility and reliability problems of the M26 Pershing, the subsequently renamed M46 was considered a stopgap solution that would be replaced later by the T42 medium tank. However, after fighting erupted in Korea, the Army decided that it needed the new tank earlier than planned. It was deemed that there was not enough time to finish the development of the T42. The final decision was to produce another interim solution, with the turret of the T42 mounted on the existing M46 hull. Although this interim tank was itself technically immature, Army officials felt the improvements over the M46 in firepower and armor were worth the risk. The composite tank, developed by the Detroit Arsenal, was named the M47 Patton.

In December 1950 the Army awarded a $100 million contract to the American Locomotive Company for the production of 500 tanks. It entered production in 1951. Its main gun was the M36 (T119E1) 90 mm gun with an M12 optical rangefinder fitted, which was developed as a more powerful version of the earlier 90 mm guns and were backwards-compatible with their ammunition (but not vice versa, the new cartridge case does not chamber in the weaker guns). The secondary armament consisted of two .30 cal Browning machine guns, one in the bow and one coaxial with the 90mm main gun in the turret, and a .50 caliber Browning M2 on a pintle mount on the turret roof. The M47 was the last American-designed tank to include a bow machine gun. The T42 turret had a larger turret ring than the M26/M46 turret, and featured a needle-nose design, which improved armor protection of the turret front, an elongated turret bustle and storage bin which protruded halfway across the engine deck, and sloped sides to further improve ballistic protection; this gave the turret a decidedly lozenge-shaped profile. It also featured the M12 stereoscopic rangefinder, which was designed to improve first-round hit probability but proved difficult to use; the rangefinder protruded from both sides of the upper turret front, which would be a feature of American tanks until the advent of the M1 Abrams in 1980.

Production at American Locomotive began in July 1951. Logistical and technical issues plagued production almost from the start.

Truman administration policy sought to strengthen American arms makers&#x27; resilience to aerial attack by encouraging more decentralized weapons production – away from Detroit. The U.S. curtailed civilian automotive production to boost military production with the onset of the Korean War. As a result, Detroit&#x27;s newly unemployed automotive workers found little work, while tank manufacturers outside Michigan lacked skilled workers. Truman&#x27;s policy also counted on civilian factories being able to quickly transition to war-time production. However, many factories lacked needed tank production machinery, done away with during World War II demobilization.

A faulty Ordnance Corps-designed hydraulic turret-control mechanism, shared by the M41 Walker Bulldog, kept the tanks from Korea while engineers worked on a fix. Engineers improved production quality controls of the hydraulics by April 1952, and set about correcting M47s sidelined in storage. By then Army officials had scrapped plans to send the tanks to Korea, in favor of providing them to troops stationed in Europe and at home.

The first M47s were not fielded to the 1st and 2nd Armored Divisions until summer 1952. Standardized in May 1952, the M47 Patton&#x27;s production ran until November 1953; Detroit built 5,481 tanks, and American Locomotive Company (Alco) produced 3,095, for a total production run of 8,576 M47 Pattons.

==Deployment==

After the U.S. Army in Germany was equipped with the M47, the first M47s delivered under the Mutual Security Agency program were delivered to Portugal in 1952. In October the agency announced that NATO member nations had agreed to adopt the British Centurion main battle tank and the M47 as standard. By October the at Camp Drum in July, the New Jersey Army National Guard was the first reserve force to train with the tank.

The Marine Corps also fielded M47s starting in late 1952; after the Korean War, all seven Marine tank battalions, three divisional, two reserve training, and two force level, each fielded M47s. But these were soon replaced with M48A1 Pattons and M103 heavy tanks, with the last M47s being retired in 1959.

American Locomotive production was halted in October when the company&#x27;s ordnance and locomotive divisions went on strike. Production resumed in February when union leaders agreed to a pay raise. In December 1952 the Defense Department ordered cutbacks to M47 and M48 tank production. In November 1953 American Locomotive halted production of the M47 after operators found drive gear defects in Europe. Army officials quickly acknowledged the issue arose from their own expedient decision to use lower grades of steel to circumvent wartime shortages. Chrysler laid off about 1000 workers at Detroit Tank Arsenal when it wrapped up production in November. American Locomotive resumed production in November. The company closed its tank division in June 1954.

With the arrival of the improved M48 Patton in 1953, the M47 was declared &quot;limited standard&quot; in 1955, and examples in tank units were replaced with the M48 series before long. After being declared obsolete in 1957, M46s and M47s were retained in active duty infantry division battlegroup assault gun platoons (four tanks each, one platoon per battlegroup, for a total of 20 tanks per division) until replaced with the light truck-mounted SS-10 anti-tank guided missile in the early 1960s. M47s were used by the Reserves for a relatively short time, soon being replaced by early production M48 Patton series tanks; thus, most of the M47s were exported in the late 1950s.

Out of the 8,576 M47s built, 8,552 (99.7 percent) were transferred to other countries through the Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) during the 1950s, forming the backbone of the NATO tank force for nearly 15 years.

The M47 was widely used by many countries, especially NATO and SEATO allies, including Austria (147), Belgium (784), Ethiopia (30), France (856), Greece (396), Portugal (161), from USA and West Germany), Iran (around 400), Italy (2,480), Japan (1 for evaluation only), Jordan (49), Pakistan (100), Portugal (161), Saudi Arabia (23 from the US, 108 on the international market), Somalia (25 from Saudi Arabia), South Korea (531), Sudan (17 from Saudi Arabia), Spain (389), Switzerland (2 for evaluation), Turkey (1,347 from the US and West Germany), West Germany (1,120), and Yugoslavia (319). Like the US Army of the time, the West German Bundeswehr also used the M47 in a tank destroyer role until replacing them with the Kanonenjagdpanzer in 1966.

U.S. Army M47s remaining in storage were expended as targets.

==Combat service==

*Near the end of the Korean war, some M47s were deployed for field testing. Some of these had 18-inch searchlights.
*France deployed a squadron of its M47s against Egypt during the Suez Crisis in 1956.
*Pakistan fielded M47s against India in both the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.
*Jordan used M47s against Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967. The Israelis regarded the Jordanians as the best enemy tankers during the conflict. Jordan lost a total of 131 M47 and M48 tanks.
*The M47 was used by the Turkish Army in the Turkish invasion of Cyprus between July and August 1974, with an estimated 200 Patton tanks involved in the combat action. At least one operational M47, Serial Number 092273, was captured by the Cyprus National Guard and remained in their service until 1993. This example is currently stored at the camp of the 25 ΕΜΑ in Paphos for use as a training and a war-memorial exhibit.
*During Ogaden War the Somalis used T-54 and T-55 tanks to defeat Ethiopian M41 and M47 tanks.
*Iran sent their M47s to fight against Iraq in the Iran–Iraq War between 1980 and 1988. Iranian M47s were roughly equivalent to the T-54s but not as good as the T-55s, performed very poorly against much-superior Iraqi tanks such as the T-62s and T-72s. Large numbers of M47 Patton tanks fell into Iraqi capture by the end of the war.
*The M47 saw small scale use during the Somali Civil War.
*In the 1980s and up to the early 1990s, the Turkish Army used M47 tanks against PKK guerrillas within Turkey and neighbouring Iraq. Turkish M48A5 variants replaced all remaining M47s by the late 1990s.
*Croatia used M47s against their Serbian enemies in the Croatian War of Independence but their performance was regarded as inferior to that of the Soviet-designed T-55. The M47s were retired from service immediately after the war and are now used as gunnery/missile live-firing targets during military exercises.

==Variants==

* M46E1 – pilot model, M46 hull with T42 turret, fitted with the M36 90 mm Gun, and was longer to incorporate a radio, ventilator, and featured a stereoscopic rangefinder; only one built

<text>The M60 is an American second-generation main battle tank (MBT). It was officially standardized as the Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 105-mm Gun, M60 in March 1959. Although developed from the M48 Patton, the M60 tank series was never officially christened as a Patton tank. It has been called a &quot;product-improved descendant&quot; of the Patton tank&#x27;s design. The design similarities are evident comparing the original version of the M60 and the M48A2. The United States fully committed to the MBT doctrine in 1963, when the Marine Corps retired the last (M103) heavy tank battalion. The M60 tank series became America&#x27;s primary main battle tank during the Cold War, reaching a production total of 15,000 M60s. Hull production ended in 1983, but 5,400 older models were converted to the M60A3 variant ending in 1990.

The M60 reached operational capability upon fielding to US Army European units beginning in December 1960. The first combat use of the M60 was by Israel during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, where it saw service under the &quot;Magach 6&quot; designation, performing well in combat against comparable tanks such as the T-62. In 1982, the Israelis again used the M60 during the 1982 Lebanon War, equipped with upgrades such as explosive reactive armor to defend against guided missiles that proved very effective at destroying tanks. The M60 also saw use in 1983 during Operation Urgent Fury, supporting US Marines in an amphibious assault on Grenada. M60s delivered to Iran also served in the Iran–Iraq War.

The United States&#x27; largest deployment of M60s was in the 1991 Gulf War, where the US Marines equipped with M60A1s effectively defeated Iraqi armored forces, including T-72 tanks. The United States retired the M60 from front-line combat after Operation Desert Storm, with the last tanks being retired from National Guard service in 1997. M60-series vehicles continue in front-line service with a number of countries&#x27; militaries, though most of these have been highly modified and had their firepower, mobility, and protection upgraded to increase their combat effectiveness on the modern battlefield.

The M60 has undergone many updates over its service life. The interior layout, based on the design of the M48, provided ample room for updates and improvements, extending the vehicle&#x27;s service life for over four decades. It was widely used by the US and its Cold War allies, especially those in NATO, and remains in service throughout the world, despite having been superseded by the M1 Abrams in the US military. The tank&#x27;s hull was the basis for a wide variety of prototype, utility, and support vehicles such as armored recovery vehicles, bridge layers and combat engineering vehicles. Egypt is the largest operator with 1,716 upgraded M60A3s, Turkey is second with 866 upgraded units in service, and Saudi Arabia is third with over 650 units.

==Development==
===Impetus===
The United States entered a period of frenzied activity during the crisis atmosphere of the Korean War, when America seemed to lag behind the Soviet Union in terms of tank quality and quantity. Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure speedy delivery of new tanks. Such rapid production caused problems but the importance given to rapidly equipping combat units with new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to quantity production.

The M47 Patton entered production in 1951 and was used by the United States Army and Marine Corps but ongoing technical and production problems kept it from serving in the Korean War. The M48 Patton tank entered US service in 1952 but its early designs were deemed unsatisfactory by Army Field Forces (AFF). The improvements to the M48 focused on improving the 90 mm main gun and fire control systems while simultaneously exploring the development of silicas glass composite armor and autoloader systems. The tank continued further development through 1955 in conjunction with its simultaneous mass production. The course of its development during the mid-1950s was the source of widespread debate among Congressional Budget Oversight committees.

The T95 program, which began in 1955 was intended to supersede the M48, featured a host of innovative and experimental components such as its 90mm smoothbore T208 cannon rigidly affixed to its turret, experimental X-shaped engine design using a vapor-cycle power plant fueled by hydrocarbons, composite armor and infrared rangefinder. The burden of developing them, however, slowed the overall program to a crawl. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, a Soviet T-54A medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the UK&#x27;s embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians in November.

After a brief examination of this tank&#x27;s armor by a British military attaché it was concluded that the 20-pounder (84 mm L/66.7) was apparently incapable of consistently defeating its frontal armor with High-Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) or Armor-Piercing Capped (APC) ammunition. Its 100 mm gun was a significant advancement over the weapon of the T-44.

There were also rumors of an even larger 115 mm gun in the works. These events spurred the United Kingdom to begin upgrading existing tanks with a 105 mm high-velocity rifled gun in 1958, the Royal Ordnance L7 to keep the Centurion viable against this new Soviet tank design. The United States responded by starting development of the XM60 tank in September 1957. This new tank design incorporated many Army Combat Vehicle (ARCOVE) committee improvements to the M48A2, chiefly the use of diesel engines to increase its operational range and the use of a more powerful main gun.

===Choice of components===

====M68 105 mm main gun====
The main gun was chosen after a comparative firing test of six different guns carried out on the Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1958. The factors evaluated were accuracy, lethality of a hit, rate of fire and penetration performance.
An M48A2C was fit with the 90 mm M41 and tested with the new T300E53 HEAT round. A smoothbore version of the 90 mm, the T208E9, was mounted on the T95E1 tank and tested the T320E62 Armour-Piercing Discarding Sabot (APDS) round. An American variant of the British Royal Ordnance L7 tank gun, under the US designation 105 mm T254E1, was mounted on the T95E2 and tested with British APDS ammunition. Finally, two versions of the 120 mm gun from the M103 were trialed, the existing model and a lightened variant known as T123E6 which was mounted on the T95E4.

The T123E6 was preferred by the Ordnance Department because its ammunition, the same as that for the M58 gun, was already at an advanced state of development. However, the ammunition was in two parts, shell and propellant bag, which required significant time to load. In the M103 this was addressed by adding a second loader, but a medium tank would not have the internal space needed for another crewmember and the firing rate would suffer as a result. In testing it demonstrated a maximum rate of 4 rounds per minute vs. the T254&#x27;s 7 rpm.

Based on these tests, the 105 mm T254E1 was selected, modified to the T254E2 and standardized as the &quot;Cannon, 105 mm Gun, M68&quot;. It used a vertical drop breechblock instead of the T254E1&#x27;s horizontal sliding breechblock. Until American-made barrels could be obtained with comparable accuracy, British X15/L52 barrels were to be used. US built XM24/L52 barrels ( in length) fitted with an eccentric bore evacuator were used for the M60-series starting in June 1959 but retained interchangeability with the British X15/L52 barrel.

All of the US guns and XM24 barrels were produced at the Watervliet Arsenal, NY and the gun mounts (M116 for the M60 and M140 for the M60A1/A3) were manufactured at the Rock Island Arsenal, IL. Because the evacuator was positioned lower on the gun&#x27;s barrel US M68 guns were fitted with an eccentric bore evacuator instead of a concentric model in order to provide more clearance over the rear deck.

The M68E1 gun shares the same firing characteristics as the M68. It featured several design improvements including an updated gun hydraulic configuration, a stabilization upgrade for the gun, a gun elevation kill switch for the loader, improved ballistic drive allowing the accurate firing of long dart penetrators and other component refinements.

The gun is capable of using a wide range of ammunition including APDS-Tracer (APDS-T) (M392 and M728), Armour-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot-Tracer (APFSDS-T) (M735 and M774), APFSDS Depleted Uranium (DU) (APFSDS-DU) (M833), HEAT-FS (M456), APDS dummy and target practice rounds, High Explosive Plastic (HEP)/ High-Explosive Squash Head (HESH) (M393), white phosphorus and canister rounds. Barrels with thermal sleeves were used starting in 1973.

Both the original M60 variant as well and the initial configuration of the M60A1 used the M68 gun. Additionally, many M48A3s armed with a 90 mm gun that were in service with the Army National Guard (ARNG) were retrofitted with the M68 gun during the mid-1970s and redesignated as the M48A5. This was done to maintain training levels of ARNG units as well as using a commonality in ammunition amongst tanks.

M60A1 RISE (Reliability Improved Selected Equipment) Passive tanks built after 1977 and all M60A3 tanks were armed with the M68E1 variant of the gun. It had an improved ballistic drive to allow for accurate firing of the M735 APFSDS ammunition. Most M60A1 RISE tanks were retrofitted to this standard by applying the M735 Cam update from the M60A1 PIP Turret Update Kit.

====Armor====
Composite armor made with fused silica glass sandwiched between plates of steel were intended to be fitted to the hull. This led to a redesign of the front of the hull into the shape of a flat wedge, instead of the M48&#x27;s elliptical front, as it simplified the installation of this armor. It was also envisioned that the T95E6 turret was to be constructed solely with this special armor. The US Army Ordnance Tank Automotive Command (OTAC) and the Carnegie Institute of Technology began development of the armor in November 1952 at Fort Belvoir VA as Project TT2-782/51 using examples of the T95 tank to conduct the ballistics testing.

This composite armor provides protection against HEAT, HEP/HESH and HE rounds. However, field repaired panel castings suffered a loss of kinetic energy protection. Limitations in manufacturing capacity and the added cost led to this armor being dropped by November 1958 and all M60-series tanks were protected with conventional steel armor but the tank retained the capability to employ armor panels.

The M60 was the last tank to feature an escape hatch under the hull. The escape hatch was provided for the driver, whose top-side hatch could easily be blocked by the main gun.

There were two versions of hulls used for the M60-series. The M60 hull had a straight slope and beak compared to the earlier M48&#x27;s rounded one. The hull bottom had a strong boat-like appearance with a pronounced recess between the upper tracks and external suspension arms and one shock absorber on the first roadwheel pair. The armor was improved, at 6 inches (155 mm) on the front glacis and mantle of solid rolled homogeneous armor, while it was 4.3 inches (110 mm) on the M48. The first prototype hulls did not have shock absorbers and were briefly named M68 in late 1958 before the Ordnance Department renamed it the M60 in March 1959. This hull version was used only on the original M60 variant and early M728 Combat Engineer Vehicles (CEVs) and M60 Armored Vehicle Launched Bridges (AVLBs). This hull model was in production from 1959 to 1962.

The M60A1 hull has basically the same visual characteristics, the noticeable difference was the addition of a second shock absorber at the second roadwheel pair and was also accompanied by a slight relocation of the first return roller. These modifications were needed due to the increased weight of the M60A1 turret as well as the additional hull armor. This hull model was used on the M60A1, M60A2 and M60A3 models of the M60-series as well as the M728A1 CEV and M60A1 AVLB. It was in production from 1962 to 1983.

The M60-series went through a progressive turret design scheme during its production life with four different turrets being manufactured for the M60-series. The T95E5 turret used on the M60 was hemispherically shaped and bore a strong resemblance to the M48 Patton. The M60A1 was the first version to employ the newly designed T95E7 turret with a redesigned bustle increasing the number of rounds for the main gun to 63. The M60A2 featured a specially designed turret for the M162 gun/missile launcher that greatly reduced the frontal arc in comparison to the M60A1&#x27;s T95E7 turret. The M60A3&#x27;s turret was similar to the A1&#x27;s but with increased armor protection for the frontal arc and mantlet in an effort to provide additional protection of the turret&#x27;s hydraulics system.

====M19 commander&#x27;s cupola====

A redesigned full vision cupola was envisioned for the commander&#x27;s station. It had 7 tiltable vision blocks arranged to give the commander a 360 degree field of view with overlapping vision between adjacent vision blocks. The front vision block could be replaced with a dual power M34 7×50 binocular day sight or an M19E1 Infrared (IR) periscope. A special feature was that the cupola body could be raised up to , providing the commander a direct field of vision while remaining under armor protection.

Access was through a hatch cover on the roof and a .50 caliber M2 Heavy Barrel (HB) machine gun was pedestal mounted on the forward part of the cupola. It could be aimed and fired with the cupola closed. Also there was an long hydraulically operated port on the left side allowing spent cartridge cases to be ejected.

After creating a full-sized mock up of this design using the T95E6 turret, it was dropped in favor of a design based on the M1 cupola of the M48A2&#x27;s turret. This T9 cupola provided the commander with more headroom than the T6 cupola of the T95 tank, carrying a new short receiver M85/T175 .50 caliber machine gun and it was standardized as the Cupola, Tank Commander&#x27;s Caliber .50 Machine Gun, M19. The first M19 cupola (a modified T9) was ready on 27 October 1958. It has an M28C sight for the machine gun in the forward part of the cupola and eight vision blocks. The front vision block can be replaced by a M19E1 infrared periscope or an M36E1 passive periscope for night observation.

Initial production of the cupola was problematic. The first 300 M60s produced were armed with a .50cal M2HB machine gun in a pedestal mount welded to the left side of the commander&#x27;s cupola owing to production problems with the new M85 machine gun. Of these tanks, the first 45 manufactured were made without the cupola itself, also due to production problems. All of these early M60s eventually had the M19 cupola and M85 machine gun installed.

Compared to a conventional pintle mount, the remote-controlled M85 machine gun was relatively ineffective in the anti-aircraft role for which it was designed. Removing the cupola lowered the vehicle&#x27;s relatively high silhouette. The cupola&#x27;s hatch also opened toward the rear of the vehicle and was dangerous to close if under small-arms fire owing to a lock-open mechanism that required the user to apply leverage to unlock it prior to closing. The commander was able to observe the battlefield using the x4 binocular M34D daylight vision block or the M19E1 IR or M36 Passive periscopes while remaining under armor protection with a 360 degree traverse independent of the turret, was stabilized in azimuth and elevation and carried 600 rounds of ammunition.

All M60s in US service retained the M19 cupola until the tank was phased out of service. The few M60A3s in Army service as training vehicles had their commander&#x27;s cupola removed as it was deemed unnecessary for training and to better mimic the profile of Soviet tanks. Some M48A5s were retrofitted with the M19 cupola to maintain training levels of ARNG units.

====Main battle tank designation====
The concept of the medium tank gradually evolved into the main battle tank (MBT) in the 1960s. The MBT was to combine the firepower and protection sufficient for the assault role with the mobility to perform as a medium tank. The MBT thus took on the role the British had once called the &quot;universal tank&quot; in the late 1950s, exemplified by the British Centurion, filling almost all battlefield roles. Typical MBTs were as well armed as any other vehicle on the battlefield, highly mobile, and well armored. Yet they were cheap enough to be built in large numbers.

The first generation consists of the medium tanks designed and produced directly after World War II that were later redefined as main battle tanks. These were exemplified by the M47 and M48 Pattons armed with a 90 mm main gun already in widespread US service. The original variant of the M60 series also fulfilled the definition of a late first generation MBT sometimes being referred to as an intermediate second generation design. The Soviet T-54 and T-55 as well as the original configuration of the T-62A tank designs are also regarded as first generation MBTs.

The second generation had enhanced night-fighting capabilities and in most cases nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protection. Most western tanks of this generation were armed with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 tank gun or derivatives of it. Notable are the British Chieftain and German Leopard 1. The United States fully committed to the MBT doctrine in 1963 when the Marine Corps deactivated its last M103 heavy tank battalion.

The first American nomenclature-designated second generation MBT was the M60A1 version of the M60 series. The term MBT is used in strategic doctrine and the composition of force as determined by the United States Army. The M60 series tanks fulfilled the MBT role on a strategic and tactical level. It was never referred to as such in any official training or technical manuals. The first Soviet second generation main battle tank designs were the T-64 and .

==Production versions==

===XM60 development===
By May 1957, it became clear that the T95 Medium Tank would not have a significant advantage over the M48A2. The X-shaped motor and electro-optical rangefinder were both discarded due to performance, and the accuracy of the smoothbore gun and its high velocity APDS ammunition continued to be unsatisfactory. The T95E6 turret was to be made with the advanced silicas armor but was never constructed. All this led to the closure of the T95 project on July 7, 1960. But the T95E7 turret design using conventional hardened steel armor was carried forward, becoming the M60A1&#x27;s turret.

The course of the M48 Patton&#x27;s tank production was the source of widespread Congressional debate. The Bureau of the Budget believed that the Army was not progressing with sufficient speed in its tank modernization program and recommended the immediate replacement of the M48A2. Correctly predicting that Congress would not approve the procurement of the M48A2 after the fiscal year 1959, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics (DCSLOG) proposed a tank based on the M48A2 featuring improved firepower and the AVDS-1790 engine. Since the main gun had not yet been specified, four XM60 weapons systems were submitted in September 1957.
The first concept was armed with the 120mm gun T123E6 in the long nosed T95E6 turret. This was the design preferred by the Ordnance Department. It was fitted with a mock-up of the new designed full-vision commander&#x27;s cupola. A full sized prototype of this turret was constructed before this concept was dropped, mainly due to its slow rate of fire. The second carried the 105mm rifled T254E1 main gun in the T95E5 type turret and the T9 cupola style of the M48A2. The T254 guns used British X15/L52 barrels with a concentric bore evacuator on the barrel.

The Army Ordnance Technical Committee chose this design for production in August 1958. The third concept was to mount the 90mm T208 smooth-bore main gun and the T95E6 turret with the T6 cupola of the T95 tank. It never progressed beyond design drawings. The fourth used the T95E1 turret and the T208 main gun. A mock-up was built using the new vision cupola. All of these conceptual designs were referred to as the XM60. A contract was awarded to Chrysler Engineering in September 1958 for the advanced production engineering (APE) of the XM60 concept #2.

The T95 hull was considered however its one-piece front casting was too difficult and expensive to produce in quantity. Some existing T95 hulls were re-fitted with the AVDS-1790 engine and used from 1960 to 1964 to develop the T118E1 prototyping of the M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle. Instead the decision was made to use modified M48A2 hulls. The hulls had 3 return rollers and 6 steel roadwheel pairs per side with no shock absorbers, using only bumper springs on the first and sixth roadwheel arms along with a widened turret well and ring, and a flat wedge-shaped glacis. The T254E2 gun was chosen to be the main weapon of the tank in August 1958 being standardized as the M68 105mm gun. After a briefing on 11 December 1958, General Maxwell Taylor ordered the XM60 into production because of the improvements it offered in firepower, protection, and cruising range.

Since the tank had not yet received its official designation these prototype hulls were briefly referred to as the M68 in December 1958 until they were officially named the M60 in March 1959. Fulfilling this requirement was an interim tank design that resulted in the M60-series, which largely resembles the M48A2 Patton it was based on, but has significant differences. The visual similarity of these designs as well as their overlapping period of service has caused some sources to informally name the original variant of the M60 as a Patton tank.

===M60 series===

The OTCM (Ordnance Technical Committee Minutes) #37002 officially standardized the type as the Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 105-mm Gun, M60 on 16 March 1959. The production contract was approved April 1959 with the low rate initial production starting in June at the Chrysler Corporation Delaware Defense Plant in Newark Delaware. Production pilot 1 was completed at Chrysler Defense Engineering on 2 July with an initial production total of 45 tanks in July 1959. These tanks were sent to the Aberdeen Proving Ground for survivability testing and final design modifications. This batch of tanks did not have the M19 cupola due to its initial production problems.

Production pilot 2 was finished on 4 August and used to develop technical publications and an additional 47 tanks produced to complete the first low rate production buy. In August 1959, an engineering bid package was awarded for the second low rate production buy of M60s to be built at the Delaware Plant. Production pilot 3 was completed 2 September. These tanks went to the Detroit Arsenal Test Center for maintenance evaluations, they were then sent to Fort Knox for user trials.

The fourth pilot was completed on 26 October and was used as the master hull to verify production standards at the Detroit Tank Plant with a low-rate initial production total of 180 M60s built in 1959. Subsequent production, starting with the October 1960 batch were built at the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant, in Warren Michigan. It reached operational capability with fielding to Army units in Europe beginning in December 1960.

;Features
The original variant of the M60 series ultimately was produced as a quick fix engineering (QFE) upgrade of the M48 due to the Soviet Union&#x27;s tank advancements of the late 1950s and the delays from developing the silicas armor and an improved turret design. The M60 mounted a 105 mm M68 main gun with the bore evacuator mounted towards the middle of the tube carrying 57 rounds in the clamshell shaped turret style of the M48. Nine rounds were stowed in the left side of the turret bustle behind the loader.

The remaining rounds were stored inside safe containers on the hull floor. A new short receiver coaxial machine gun was designed for the M60 tank. This was the 7.62mm M73/T197E2 which replaced the .30 caliber M37 used on the M48A2. It had 2,000 rounds of ammunition. They had a reputation for jamming. After working to correct this, they were redesignated as the M73A1 in 1970.

The electrical package on the M60 was essentially the same as used on the M48A2C including an improved turret control system and an all-metric measurement M16 Fire Control System (FCS), The M16 FCS consists of a new M10 ballistic drive and mechanical M16E1 gun data computer which integrated barrel temperature data with an M17 coincidence range finder. The rangefinder is a double image coincidence image instrument used as the ranging device of the gunner&#x27;s primary direct sighting and fire control system. The gunner is provided with an M31E1 day periscope with a magnification of x8 and an M105D day telescopic sight with a magnification of x8 and a field of view of 7.5 degrees.

Range information from the rangefinder is fed into the ballistic computer through a shaft. The ballistic computer is a mechanically driven unit that permits ammunition selection, range correction, and superelevation correction by the gunner. The ballistic drive receives the range input and, through the use of cams and gears, provides superelevation information to the superelevation actuator. The superelevation actuator adds sufficient hydraulic fluid to the elevating mechanism to correctly position the gun.

In late 1962, a kit was fielded that allowed the use of the AN/VSS-1(V)1 IR searchlight. The searchlight has both infrared and visible light capabilities and was positioned over the gun. Along with an M32 IR periscope for the gunner, M19 IR periscope and M18 IR binoculars for the commander provided first generation night vision capability to the M60 and M60A1 tanks. This kit was also compatible with the M48A3/A5.

The hull bottom had a strong boat-like appearance with a pronounced recess between the upper tracks and external suspension arms with cast aluminum roadwheels and return rollers along with a single shock absorber on the first roadwheel pair. Cast aluminum road wheels were used to save weight. The armor was improved, at 6 inches (155 mm) on the front glacis and mantle of solid rolled homogeneous armor, while it was 4.3 inches (110 mm) on the M48. Power was provided by the AVDS-1790-2A engine, CD-850-5 cross drive transmission and the T97E2 track assembly as used on the M48A3.

The drive sprocket is located at the rear of the hull. The vehicle also provides full NBC protection for the crew using the M13A1 protection system creating a positive atmospheric pressure in the crew compartment. The positive pressure keeps contaminated air out and forces the smoke produced from firing the main or coax guns out of the vehicle. Access between the driver&#x27;s compartment and the turret fighting compartment was also restricted, requiring that the turret be traversed to the rear.

The M60 was deployed to West Germany to counter the threat presented from the T-54s and T-55s of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact as well as to South Korea but was never sent to South Vietnam mainly due to unfavorable terrain and the general lack of significant numbers of North Vietnamese armor. In May 1961 Army Chief-of-Staff General George Decker announced that the European Command had been receiving the M60 to replace older tank inventory. By October the Seventh Army was outfitted with many of the tanks. A total of 2,205 M60s were built between June 1959 and August 1962. Some M60/E60 tanks were later transferred to Israel and participated in the Yom Kippur War. Some were repurposed as AVLBs.

===M60A1 series===

;Development
The program to develop the M60A1 was approved in early 1960 in conjunction with abandoning further development of the advanced composite armor and the closure of the T95 Medium Tank project. The first proof of concept attempt to mate a modified M60 hull with the T95E7 turret took place in March 1960. The turret, even without the siliceous cored armor, provided improved ballistic protection. Additional space for the turret crew was also made available by using the M140 mount thus moving the cannon 5 inches forward.

The first two prototypes (Pilot 1 and 2) were ready in May 1961 and the third (Pilot 3) in June 1961, when the vehicle also received its official prototype designation as the M60E1. These vehicles were built by Chrysler Defense. Pilot 1 was sent for evaluation at the Eglin Air Force Base climatic hangar, while Pilot 2 was tested at the Yuma Test Station, and Pilot 3 underwent field trials at Fort Knox.

On 22 October 1961, the M60E1 was officially accepted in service under the designation of Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 105-mm Gun, M60A1. Production began on 13 October 1962 when the Army placed an initial order for 720 of the tanks for 61.2 million dollars.

;Features
In addition to the new turret design, the hull was upgraded. The hull&#x27;s upper glacis armor was increased from at 65 degrees while the turret sides went from at their apex. This brought the frontal armor up to the same 10&quot; line of sight armor standard of the M103 heavy tank. A mushroom-shaped fume extractor was placed at the rear left of the turret bustle to vent smoke produced from firing the main or coax guns out of the vehicle. The addition of a shock absorber on the second roadwheel pair was also accompanied by a slight relocation of the first return roller. These modifications were needed due to the increased weight of the M60A1 turret as well as the additional hull armor.

The ammunition load for the main gun was increased to 63 rounds. Round storage was distributed between the turret bustle, where 15 ready rounds of various types were stowed and accessible for the loader, and the rest were stored inside safe containers on the hull floor.

The uncomfortable wire mesh seats for the loader and gunner were replaced with padded ones. The brake and accelerator pedal and gauges were also rearranged for more efficient and comfortable operation while the steering wheel was replaced by a T bar steering control. The engine and power train were supplied by the Continental AVDS-1790-2A engine and the CD-850-5 cross drive transmission and using the T97 track assembly.

Improvements to the electronics package for this version included an improved electro-mechanical traverse assembly and an AN/VSS-1(V)1 IR searchlight above the gun shield. The M19 FCS consisted of the M17A1 coincidence rangefinder, M10A1 ballistic drive and the mechanical M19E1 ballistic computer for the gunner. The M60A1 RISE Passive tank uses the M68E1 variant of the gun carried in the M140 mount. Most M60A1 RISE tanks were retrofitted to this standard after 1977. The M68E1 gun shares the same firing characteristics as the M68. It featured several design improvements including an updated gun hydraulic configuration, a stabilization upgrade for the gun, a gun elevation kill switch for the loader, improved ballistic drive and other component refinements.

;Upgrades

As the development of a new main battle tank stalled with problems and cost escalating quickly, the M60A1 was forced to serve longer than originally intended with production lasting almost 20 years. In that time span, numerous product improvement programs were put forward. As the major changes were incorporated into the production line, the vehicle model designations were changed. The first of which was Top Loading Air Cleaner (TLAC) in 1971. This reduced dirt and dust ingestion, which increased engine life as well as allowing for easier servicing of the engine. Early TLAC panels were made from aluminum and were vulnerable to damage from small arms fire.

Next came Add-On Stabilization (AOS) that was introduced in late 1972. This was an add-on kit made to fit with minimum modifications to the existing hydraulic gun control system. The add-on-stabilization system provides stabilization control for both gun elevation and turret traverse. It provides the gunner with the capability of aiming and target tracking and also improved surveillance of the battlefield terrain by the gunner while the tank is moving. It may be used in any one of three modes of control: (1) power-with-stabilization-on, (2) power-with-stabilization-off, and (3) manual. In the power-with-stabilization-on mode, the gunner&#x27;s aim on target is automatically retained while the vehicle is in motion. This mode provides a fire-on the-move capability. The power-with-stabilization-off option eliminates needless exercise of the stabilization system and provides a backup power mode. The manual back up system permits the crew to aim and fire the weapons should the electrical/hydraulic subsystems fail.

At a range of , hit probabilities of better than 70% from a moving M60A1 were obtained in Aberdeen test results while without a stabilizer it was essentially zero. M60A1s with this upgrade were designated as the M60A1(AOS). The T142 track was fielded in 1974, which had replaceable rubber pads, better end connectors, and improved service life. M60A1(AOS)+ was the denotation for M60A1s equipped with the TLAC &amp; AOS upgrades and the T142 track.

Introduced in 1975, the Reliability Improved Selected Equipment (RISE) was a comprehensive upgrade of the M60A1 hull as well as integrating the previous TLAC and AOS upgrades. It included the upgraded AVDS-1790-2C RISE diesel engine and CD-850-6 transmission that featured several changes in order to improve service life and reliability. A new 650 ampere oil-cooled alternator, a solid state regulator and new wiring harness with more accessible disconnectors was also incorporated into the hull&#x27;s electrical system as well as armored steel TLAC panels and the return to the use of steel roadwheels and return rollers. They were denoted as M60A1(RISE).

The 1977 fielding of the passive M32E1 sight for the gunner and M36E1 periscope for the commander as well as the M24E1 IR night vision block for the driver provided second generation night vision capabilities for M60A1 and RISE tanks. These new passive gunner&#x27;s sight and commander&#x27;s periscope provide recognition capability at longer ranges and at relatively low night light levels (1/2 moonlight). Under starlight conditions, they will provide recognition beyond with the use of an IR searchlight.

During 1978, kits for the mounting of the M239 smoke grenade launchers and the mounting of the M240 as the coaxial machine gun were fielded. The development of the M735 APFSDS ammunition required a cam update to the gun&#x27;s mechanical ballistic drive for accurate firing. M60A1s configured to this standard were denoted as M60A1(RISE)+.

The M60A1(RISE) Passive featured the implementation of all previous updates plus AN/VVS-2 passive night vision block for the driver, a deep water fording kit, the capability to mount Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) and the AVDS-1790-2D RISE engine with CD-850-6A transmission and a Vehicle Engine Exhaust Smoke System (VEESS) that visually obscured the area around the vehicle. The VEESS smokescreen system does not provide protection against infrared, thermal or laser detection.

The two six-barreled, electronically fired M239 smoke grenade launchers, one on each side of the main gun and replacement of the coax machine gun with the M240C were implemented in late 1978. The smoke grenades contain a phosphor compound that masks the thermal signature of the vehicle to the enemy. They were denoted as M60A1(RISE) Passive.

Over the period of M60A1 tank production, several essential engineering changes were incorporated. Many of these miscellaneous changes were to improve the system safety, reliability, maintainability and increase mission performance. The M60A1 Tank Hull/Turret Product Improvement Plan (PIP) Update Kit includes those items that could not be readily identified with basic major product improvements and to incorporate essential engineering changes that had occurred during M60A1 tank production. The update program included engineering changes and minor product improvements which were not part of specific product improvements, but were required to upgrade early vintage M60A1 tanks up to the current M60A1(RISE) production configuration. Additionally the Hull PIP Update Kit was applied to the M48A5.

The M60A1 was in production from October 1962 until May 1980 and was extensively used by the US Army and Marine Corps as well as being widely exported to foreign governments. A total of 7,948 M60A1s (all variants including E60A) were built. Many of them were later converted to the A3 standard.

===M60A2 series===
During the early 1960s there was some debate regarding the future of main tank weaponry, largely focusing on conventional kinetic energy rounds versus missiles. In the early 1960s it was generally accepted that the maximum effective range of the M68 gun was between . The XM-13 missile system had proven itself viable, obtaining over 90% first round accuracy up to . But the development of a main battle tank variant was bogged down by having too many design proposals. In response, studies were made in August 1961 to retrofit existing M60 tanks with a weapon capable of firing both conventional HEAT (High-Explosive Anti-Tank) rounds and launching ATGMs (Anti-Tank Guided-Missiles).

Three M60E1 tanks with T95 turrets were modified to permit the installation of the 152mm XM81 gun-launcher. Mounted on former M60 hulls, they were to provide test beds for the evaluation of the Shillelagh weapon system. Although this system was the preferred armament for the MBT-70, by late 1961 problems with the XM13 missile required that the program be reorganized. The missile was reclassified as an applied research project and it was obvious that there would be some delay before it would be available for service.

On 10 January 1962, representatives from various ordnance organizations met at the Ordnance Tank-Automotive Center (OTAC) to review armament systems that might be suitable replacements, if the Shillelagh missile could not be developed in a timely manner. Time was particularly critical for the Armored Reconnaissance/Airborne Assault Vehicle (AR/AAV) (the XM551 Sheridan) which required a decision on the armament by April 1962. The possible delay was not as serious for the MBT-70 since the program was limited to conceptual design and component development. The requirements also differed for the tank because of its ability to carry a much heavier weapon system.

Several backup weapons were also under consideration and concept studies were prepared showing their application to the MBT-70 concepts. The 152mm gun-launcher XM81 also was considered without the missile depending only on the combustible case conventional ammunition. It was expected that the Shillelagh or some other missile then could be introduced at a later date.

The 105mm gun M68 as standardized for the M60 tank was considered as an alternate armament system. It had the advantage of being immediately available and its ammunition was already in production. Of the several turrets drafted, one of the earliest was the driver-in-turret integrated fighting compartment. This design was further developed using the MBT-70. Another proposal was a more compact turret design of the T95E7.

;Development

During the development of the M60A2, three different turret types were considered, the Type A, Type B and . The Type A turret would be constructed based on the T95E7 turret and then further modified and produced as the Type B standard. The Type C turret was essentially a larger M551 Sheridan-style turret. A mock-up of this turret was built, but the design was never seriously considered and soon abandoned. All of these conceptual variants were referred to as the XM66.

On 10 January 1964, the Army reviewed all three variants and selected the Type A variant for further development. Initially two Type A turrets were built in 1964. The M60A1 hull was used starting in 1966 to develop the new compact turret design using the 152mm M162/XM81E13 rifled barrel main gun. These developmental tanks were designated as the M60A1E series.

The M60A1E1 referred to vehicles based on the modified T95E7 Type A turrets with M60 hulls used through 1965. The M60A1E1 variant was used to evaluate the XM81 dual-purpose gun and its compatibility with the XM13 Guided Missile, Armor Defeating together with the XMTM51 training round. During the early testing of the XM81 main gun it was noted that misfires and premature detonations of the M409 conventional case ammunition were caused by unburnt propellant in the bore and breech.

This flaw was often catastrophic as it set off the projectile in the barrel as it was fired. To remedy this the guns were equipped with a traditional fume extractor on the barrel. The XM81 Gun/Launcher also experienced frequent faulty breeches, often not closing correctly during a missile firing, allowing the exhaust of the launching Shillelagh to vent hot noxious gases into the crew compartment.
As the M60A1 hull became available in 1966, it was decided to upgrade these prototype vehicles to the M60A1 hull standard. Vehicles using the M60A1 hull and chassis received the M60A1E2 designation, and were used to develop the Type B compact turret and the XM81E13 gun variant. The M60A1E2 finalized the turret design with the use of a compact turret which reduced exposed frontal area by 40% compared to the M60A1 and continued development of the M51 Missile Guidance System (M51MGS).

These were later standardized as the M60A2. Initial plans called to retrofit the turret of every M60 with the new A2 turret, and use them in the mobile anti-armor role alongside the M60A1 tanks. But the continual technical and reliability difficulties with the dual-purpose gun caused this to be abandoned. The M60A1E3 variant was a prototype mounting the M68 105 mm rifled gun to the turret of the M60A1E2. This was evaluated due to several earlier faults noted in the M60A1E1&#x27;s main gun. Compared to the Shillelagh system, the use of the 105mm gun increased the overall tank weight by about .

The M60A1E4 was a conceptual variant that explored the use of various remote controlled weapons, including a 20mm gun as secondary armament. A mock-up of this design using the Type C turret was constructed. All variants of this series underwent evaluations and trials at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The M60A1E2 was finally accepted by the Army in 1970 and given the designation Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 152-mm Gun/Launcher, M60A2.

Initial orders were submitted by the Army in 1971 however production did not start until 1973 and continued until 1975. All were built at the Chrysler Tank Plant in Warren, Michigan with a total of 540 M60A2s produced. The M60A2 was intended to serve as the stop-gap solution until its projected replacement, the MBT-70 completed its development. The M60A2 was deployed to Army units in Europe starting in June 1975 when B Company, 1-32 Armor Battalion received its first M60A2 tanks.
;Features
The M60A2 featured a unique low profile turret, mounting the M162 Gun/Launcher that drastically reduced the turret&#x27;s frontal arc in comparison to the A1&#x27;s. It consisted of a large disk with a narrow channel in the center with each crew member in the turret having their own hatch. The gunner and loader were located to the right and left of the gun, respectively, and the commander was in a turret basket up and behind the main gun.

As a result, each crew member was effectively isolated from one another with the gunner and loader separated by Shillelagh missiles in their storage position. The commander was in the rear compartment under a large redesigned cupola, which somewhat negated the low profile silhouette of the turret.

The M162 gun was fully stabilized in both turret traverse and gun elevation using the same upgrade kit as the M60A1 AOS, allowing the gunner to effectively scan the battlefield while the tank was in motion. This system could be used by the gunner to engage targets with unguided M409 rounds while the vehicle was in motion, but the tank had to remain stationary when firing and tracking an MGM-51 missile. Four M226 smoke grenade launchers were mounted on each side of the turret bustle.

Additionally there was a mounting point on the left side of the turret for an AN/VSS-1(V)1 Infrared Spotlight and M19E1 IR periscope providing first generation night vision for night operations. A basket was fitted to the rear of the turret to stow the spotlight when not in use. Late production versions replaced the bore evacuator with the Closed-Bore Scavenger System (CBSS), a compressed air system that pushed the fumes and gases out of the muzzle when the breech was opened.

Initial production M60A2s used the M60A1 hull powered by an AVDS-1790-2A TLAC engine, CD-850-5 cross-drive transmission and the T97 track assembly. Many of these hulls were later upgraded to the RISE standard.

The M51 Missile Guidance System (MGS) for the Shillelagh missiles was designed by Ford&#x27;s Aerospace Division. The M51 MGS consisted of an infrared (IR) direct beam guidance and control system to track the missile mounted to the turret over the mantel of the gun with a telescopic sight and a Raytheon AN/WG-1 Flashlamp Pumped, Ruby Laser range finder, accurate to 4,000 meters, for the gunner.

The gunner aimed the cross-hairs in his direct telescopic sight at the target and fired the missile. After acquiring a target a small charge would propel the missile out of the barrel. The missile&#x27;s solid-fueled sustainer rocket then ignited and launched the Shillelagh. For the time of flight of the missile, the gunner had to keep the cross-hairs pointed at the target. A direct infrared beam missile tracker in the gunner&#x27;s sight detected any deviation of the flight path from the line-of-sight to the target, and transmitted corrective commands to the missile via an infrared command link. The MGM-51A was stabilized by flip-out fins, and controlled by hot gas jet reaction controls.

The gunner also employed an M219 (later replaced with a M240C) to the gun mantle&#x27;s right with 2,000 rounds. The commanders cupola was redesigned causing the M85 to be mounted in the inverted position in order to provide access to its feed cover and mounted a single M34 periscope carrying 600 rounds. The M60A2&#x27;s combat load for the M162 main gun consisted of 33 M409 rounds and 13 MGM-51 Shillelagh missiles.

;Flaws
This weapon system had several drawbacks. First the gunner had to keep the target in the crosshairs of the sight during the entire flight time of the missile. This meant that only one target could be tracked and engaged at a time. Furthermore, the M60A2 could not fire or track a missile while moving.

Secondly was the high minimum range of about . Until the missile reached this range it flew beneath the tracking system&#x27;s infrared beam and could therefore not be guided by the infrared command link. Also minimum range was slightly above the maximum effective range of the M60A2&#x27;s conventional unguided munition. This created a dangerous gap area that could not be adequately covered by fire known as a &quot;dead zone&quot;.

It was also discovered that structural cracks in the barrel occurred after several missile firings. This defect was traced to a flaw in the missile&#x27;s longitudinal key, which fitted into a keyway inside the gun barrel. It was determined that a less deep key would significantly extend the service life of the barrel.

The Missile Control System was also very fragile owing to its dependence on vacuum tubes which often broke when firing the gun. Finally a Shillelagh missile was considerably more expensive than the M409 round. The vehicle was one of the most technologically complex of its era, eventually garnering an unofficial nickname of &quot;Starship&quot;. This also contributed to its failure, largely due to difficulties with maintenance, training, and complicated operation.

The M60A2 proved a disappointment, though its technical advancements would pave the way for future tanks. Its intended successor, the MBT-70, was canceled in 1971 and its funding diverted into the conceptual development of the XM1 Abrams. The Shillelagh/M60A2 system was phased out from active units by 1981, and the turrets scrapped. The main replacement for the Shillelagh missile in the mobile anti-armor role was the more versatile BGM-71 TOW. Most of the M60A2 tanks were rebuilt as M60A3s, or the hulls converted to armored vehicle-launched bridge (AVLB) vehicles and M728 Combat Engineer Vehicles with a few M60A2s retained as museum pieces.

===M60A3 series===
;Development
Due to the rapidly developing advancements in anti-armor capabilities and solid-state electronics of the 1970s, along with the general dissatisfaction of the M60A2, an upgrade of the M60A1 was needed. In 1976 work began on the M60A3 variant which featured a number of technological enhancements.

;Features

The M60A3 version of the M60-series had the same mobility, performance, and weapons systems as the M60A1 RISE and RISE Passive tanks and incorporated all of their engineering upgrades, improvements and capabilities.

The electronics and fire control systems were greatly improved. The turret&#x27;s hydraulic fluid was replaced with a non-flammable one. This updated turret configuration was mated to the M60A1 RISE hull using the AVDS-1790-2D RISE engine and CD-850-6A transmission along with a Halon fire suppression system. It was designated as the Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 105-mm Gun, M60A3.

The M60A3 tank was built in two configurations. The earlier version, sometimes referred to as the M60A3 Passive, uses the same passive gunner&#x27;s sight as the A1 RISE Passive and the latest version has a Tank Thermal Sight (TTS). The M60A1, RISE, and RISE Passive tanks used a coincidence rangefinder and the mechanical M19 ballistic computer. The M60A3 uses a laser based rangefinder and the solid state M21 ballistic computer.

The M21 FCS for the M60A3 was made up of a Raytheon AN/WG-2 flash-lamp pumped ruby-laser based range finder, accurate up to 5000 meters for both the commander and gunner, a solid-state M21E1 gun data computer incorporating a muzzle reference sensor and crosswind sensor, ammunition selection, range correction and superelevation correction were inputted by the gunner, an improved turret stabilization system along with an upgraded turret electrical system and solid-state analog data card bus. The M10A2E3 ballistic drive is an electro-mechanical unit.

The commander had an M36E1 passive periscope and the gunner an M32E1 passive sight. The TTS configuration replaced the gunner&#x27;s sight with the Raytheon AN/VSG2 Tank Thermal Sight (TTS), a Mercury-Cadmium-Telluride (HgCdTe) IR detector. This sight allows the gunner to see through fog, smoke and under starlight conditions without the aid of an IR searchlight. This system provided improved night fighting capabilities.
The first M60A3s were assembled at the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant in February 1978, where the first of a low-rate of initial production quantity of 296 M60A3s were produced through October with fielding to Army units in Europe starting in May 1979. The M60A3 was seen by the US Army as a stop-gap measure as the development of the XM1 Abrams MBT was already well advanced with fielding to Europe planned to start in 1981 and notified Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers of its near-term plans to discontinue M60-series tank production.

In March 1982, General Dynamics Land Systems purchased Chrysler Defense. The procurement of M60A3 and M60A3 TTS tanks for the Army ended in June 1983 with the purchase of 120 M60A3 TTS tanks, while production of the M60A3 (for Saudi Arabia, and M60A3 hulls for Taiwan) was expected to end in May 1985 after over 15,000 M60s were built in total, but in May 1985, Egypt placed an order for 94 M60A3 tanks at the cost of US$165 million. In 1986, the Egyptian order was complete.

The Army also increased its M60A3 TTS fleet through the M60A1 Product Improvement Program (PIP) and the M60A3 tank field retrofit program conducted by the Anniston Army Depot and the Mainz Army Depot (MZAD). Depot field teams retrofitted all of the Army&#x27;s 748 M60A3 tanks to the TTS configuration by the end of 1984. In addition, both depots converted a total of 1,391 M60A1 RISE tanks to the M60A3 TTS standard in that same year. In 1989, the US army had a total of 5,400 M60A3 TTS, of which 1,686 were newly built tanks, 114 were M60A1 passive tanks retrofitted to the M60A3 TTS standard, and 3,600 were conversions made by the Anniston Army Depot and Mainz Army Depot. These M60A1 RISE PIP conversion programs were concluded in 1990s.

Italy, Austria, Greece, Morocco, Taiwan, and other countries upgraded their existing fleets with various E60B component upgrades under several FMS defense contracts with Raytheon and General Dynamics during the mid to late 1980s. In 1990, M60A3/E60Bs from Army surpluses were sold to Oman, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia.

The M60A3 replaced the M60A1 in the US Army and any remaining M48A5s in ARNG service on a one-for-one basis. The Marine Corps continued to use the M60A1 RISE Passive until they were withdrawn from combat use in 1991. They were phased from ARNG service between 1994 and 1997, being replaced with the M1 MBT. The Detroit Tank Plant was closed in 1996 with production of the M1A1 Abrams continuing at the Lima Tank Plant in Ohio.

=== E60 series ===
M60s for use in foreign military service were designated as the E60 series by the US Foreign Military Sales (FMS). These were essentially M60s with minor modifications requested by approved foreign purchasers. Some of the modifications included removal of the M19 cupola, different models of machine guns, electronics, fire control systems or radios, external armor plates, smoke launchers and power packs. Israel purchased many of these tanks forming the basis for the Magach 6 series.

This series included the following designations:
*E60: modified M60 variant for non-US service
*E60A: modified M60A1 variant for non-US service
*E60B: modified M60A3 variant for non-US service

The M60A2 was never approved for foreign sales.

== Army National Guard evaluations ==

===M60AX===
Priority in initial M1 Abrams unit allotments was given to Active Army armored units in Europe. The Army National Guard&#x27;s armored assets were key strategic elements, approximated at 3,000 tanks, and were important for reinforcing Active Army units in Europe in case of conflict. Without an inventory available to provide the ARNG with M1 Abrams tanks, unfunded Requests for Proposals (RFPs) were circulated by the ARNG Tracked Vehicle Task Force starting in 1983. Teledyne Continental developed the first RFP upgrades to the suspension, power pack and transmission. It was demonstrated and tested at Fort Knox in January 1985. The upgrade was not evaluated for US military service or assigned a designation. GDLS acquired Teledyne and by 1987 had pursued the RFP improvement to the armor, mounted the M68A1, and called it the Super 60. It was the reference point for the ARNG upgrade decisions submitted to the Department of the Army to upgrade its M60A3 TTS fleet. In the actual report, the upgrade is referred to as the M60AX. $90 million was requested for prototyping and $2.8 billion to complete the fleet conversion by fiscal year 1989.

===M60A4===
The M60A4 was the proposed upgrade of the M60A3 TTS for the National Guard that emerged from the M60AX study conducted by the ARNG Tracked Vehicle Task Force with a projected cost of $750,000 per tank. The upgrade would have included improved protection, automotive performance and combat effectiveness, but retained the same M68E1 gun as the M60A3. Since the M60AX evaluation vehicle was not in the US Army Logistical system the requested components for the upgrade were inferred to by FSCM part numbers. After examining more than two dozen possible upgrade components for the M60A3 TTS, the task force decided on the 15 subsystem upgrades that made up the M60A4 overhaul. Survivability upgrades included both appliqué and wraparound armor, internal spall liners, laser protection, an automatic fire suppression system, an engine smoke generation kit and a new low-profile cupola. Mobility enhancements included a new 1050 horsepower engine, a new automatic transmission, improved final drives, an improved vehicle suspension and a modification to the air cleaner. The M60A4&#x27;s key target acquisition and fighting improvements were an upgraded laser rangefinder, an enhancement of TTS optical performance, a modified fire control system and an improved turret drive and stabilization system. After reviewing the proposal it was declined by the Chief of Staff of the United States Army General Carl E. Vuono in 1988. No prototype was ever constructed.

The US Army did not view the M60A4 as a cost effective proposition for the National Guard with only a limited increase in crew survivability and the same firepower as the M60A3. The M60 tank was superseded in ARNG service by the M1 version of the Abrams tank beginning in 1990. The M60A3 was phased out from ARNG service and was fully replaced by the M1A1 by 1997. Most of the M1 Abrams tanks were upgraded to the M1A1 configuration.

==Foreign upgrades==
A US Congressional Report in November 1993 stated that there were 5,522 serviceable M60A1 and M60A3 tanks in the US Army&#x27;s inventory available for sale or transfer to US allies or foreign nations. Of these, 111 were in Korea, 1,435 were in Europe, and 3,976 located in CONUS. The average age of these tanks was 16 years and an expected peacetime service life of 20 years. The average price was US$212,898 per tank as is, without radios or machine guns and they were not mechanically overhauled. Tanks located in Korea were inspected and sold to Bahrain and Taiwan.

Of the 1,435 tanks in Europe, 1,311 have been cascaded to other NATO countries under the terms of the Conventional Forces Europe Agreement (CFE), 18 reserved for non-combat use and 106 returned to CONUS. Egypt inspected 411 tanks at Fort Hood and 91 at Fort Knox and tentatively selected 299 of those. An additional inventory of tanks from the CONUS M60 fleet were available at the same unit price for other approved purchasers.

The United States chose not to pursue further upgrades to the M60 tank series after 1978. With its near-term replacement by the Army with the M1 MBT being scheduled to start production in 1980. M60 series tanks were phased out of US service by 1997 and Opposing Force (OPFOR) training use in 2005. Together with the large number of M60 MBTs still in foreign service and a large US Army surplus inventory, several upgrades for the tank were offered starting in 1985.

There are three basic approaches to upgrade decisions for the M60 MBT. Some countries, such as Taiwan and Jordan, have sought to modernize the M60 as a frontline MBT. Turkey is seeking a middle-ground, keeping it useful as it develops more modern designs. Other countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Thailand are modernizing their M60 fleets for counter-insurgency type operations.

While the market for M60 modernization is somewhat limited, because the tank is generally operated by poorer countries or has been relegated to secondary tasks, other companies have come up with more advanced Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) upgrade solutions. Additionally, several countries also funded their own design upgrades, notable examples are the Magach, Sabra and Phoenix variants. In 2005, M60 variants were in service with Egypt, Greece, Israel, Jordan, Turkey, Taiwan, and some 20 other nations to varying degrees.

=== High Performance/Super M60 Main battle tank ===

The High Performance M60, also called &quot;Super M60&quot;, was a comprehensive update package for the M60A1 and A3 tanks, first demonstrated and tested in 1985 by Teledyne Continental. The vehicle was developed as a private venture for the export market and was never evaluated for US military service. Unofficially called the M60AX, the upgrade offered to increase the protection, firepower and mobility for the M60A1 and A3 tanks.

The Super M60 prototype was based on an M60A1 leased from the US Army. It featured the AVCR-1790-1B engine producing coupled to a Renk RK-304 transmission with four forward and four reverse gears. The torsion bar suspension system of the M60 was replaced with a hydropneumatic suspension system (HSS) developed by the National Waterlift Company as seen on the HIMAG, General Motors XM1, and the Jordanian Centurion (Tariq). Over the M60A1, the Super M60&#x27;s top speed increased to and power/weight ratio increased to , despite the increase in weight. This High Performance configuration was demonstrated and tested at Fort Knox in January 1985 but was not designated. Although the US Army chose not to adopt the installation of a new power pack or suspension system in the M60 series, General Dynamics formed a co-operative private venture with Teledyne Continental to develop a comprehensive upgrade package.
Survivability was enhanced with a layer of Chobham spaced applique armor built around the turret and frontal arc of the hull that noticeably changed its appearance. The applique armor consisted of an outer layer of high-hardness steel armor panels and an inner layer of ceramic inserts covering the base M60A1 vehicle. Track skirts consisted of Sitall and high-hardness steel for the hull sides as well as Kevlar spall liners for the fighting compartment. Like the vehicle it is based on, it retained a crew of four: the commander, loader and gunner positioned in the turret and the driver in the front of the hull.
The weapons of the Super M60 are similar to those of the M60A3. The main gun is the rifled 105 mm/L52 M68A1E2 with a thermal sleeve. The 7.62 mm M73 coaxial machine gun used on the M60A1 was replaced with a 7.62 mm M240C, with the same number of rounds. The M19 cupola was replaced with a low silhouette model with a pop-up hatch for the commander and a 12.7 mm M2HB machine gun on a pintle mount with 600 rounds. The Fire Control System (FCS) used was designated the Advanced Laser Tank Fire Control System (LTFCS).

The FCS configuration was largely similar to that used on the M60A3, but instead of replacing the optical rangefinder with an AN/VVG-2 laser rangefinder, a emitter was installed on the roof and the M35 gunner&#x27;s sight was modified to include a laser visual unit. Also, the stabilization configuration was changed to that of the M1 Abrams where the sight itself was fully stabilized and the gun followed the sight. The prototype did not have an optical range finder but one could have been easily installed.

After initial tests with only the new engine and suspension, additional modifications such as the armor upgrade intended to increase protection from shaped charged projectiles were applied. Testing conducted not only showed that the new suspension system smoothened the off-road ride, but also allowed the Super M60 to handle well in spite of its considerable weight increase over the original M60A1. As one of the first upgrade packages offered for the M60 series, the Super M60 prototype demonstrated the potential for upgrading the M60A1/A3 and was offered by GDLS as one of their many possible upgrade packages.

Even though this update package offered M60 users an opportunity to dramatically increase the combat capabilities of their tank fleets, no country ever bought the update and the program effectively ceased by the end of the Cold War. Only one prototype was built. The overall failure of the Super M60 program was likely due to the lack of immediate necessity for such a vehicle. This design was similarly developed independently by Israel in their Magach 7 series. Additionally the German company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann offered the Super M48, applying this design&#x27;s technology to the M48A2/A3.

=== M60-2000 ===
The General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) M60-2000 or 120S was an upgrade of the M60A1 tank. The development of the M60-2000 was primarily due to the large number of M60 Main Battle Tanks in service with many Middle Eastern nations unable to afford a sufficient force of more modern main battle tanks. The upgrade was marketed at those M60 users with the industrial capability to convert the tanks themselves. The M60-2000/120S was a GDLS supplied conversion kit that married the M1A1 turret of the M1 Abrams to the M60A1 RISE hull, offering many features of the M1A1 Abrams to existing M60 users at a reduced cost.

It was first referred to the M60-2000 Program and design work began in late 1999 by General Dynamics Land Systems as a private venture for the export market and was never evaluated for US military service. Later the M60 designation was dropped because of the extensive changes and to highlight this as a new vehicle to potential customers thus changing the name to the 120S Project. The M60-2000 was test-marketed during 2000 and a number of countries in NATO and the Middle East were briefed on the vehicle. Following customer feedback, detailed engineering work was carried out and in December GDLS decided to build a functional prototype. The company rolled out the proof of concept prototype of the 120S tank at their Detroit, Michigan, facility in August 2001. It was shown at the IDEF Exhibition held in Turkey in October 2001.

The 120S was initially aimed at the Turkish Land Forces Command (TLFC) M60 upgrade requirement but this competition was subsequently won by IMI Military Industries with their Sabra II upgrade. The Egyptian Army was considering this offer until it was finally rejected in favor of a licensed contract to build M1s in Egypt. Only one prototype was made. As of early 2009, there were no sales of the 120S tank and was no longer mentioned in General Dynamics marketing literature. The prototype was disassembled and the hull and turret returned to the US Army in 2003.

=== M60A3 Phoenix ===
The M60 Phoenix Project was Jordan&#x27;s modular upgrade of the M60A3TTS to better address both immediate and emerging threats to the M60MBT. The tank is armed with a RUAG Land Systems L50 120 mm smoothbore Compact Tank Gun (CTG) with a firing rate of 6–10 rounds per minute. 20 ready rounds are stored in the turret bustle. The M21 FCS is replaced with Raytheon&#x27;s Integrated Fire Control System (IFCS). The system consists of an eye safe laser rangefinder, second generation night sight, digital ballistic computer, cant sensors and a MIL-STD 1553 data bus. The M10 ballistic drive is upgraded with a fully electrical superelevation resolver.

The maneuverability and acceleration of the Phoenix is improved with the use of the General Dynamics AVCR-1790-2C engine producing 950 hp increasing available power by 20%, an upgraded CD-850-B1 transmission, new air cleaner and air induction systems, improved suspension and new and improved final drives. Survivability is improved through the addition of various modular armor protection schemes for both the M60&#x27;s turret and hull. The upgrades include armor protection with STANAG 4569 Level 6 protection plates to the frontal arc, passive and reactive armor panels and side skirts and slat armor added to the bustle, protecting the rear of the turret from RPG attack.

The protection scheme can be reconfigured to changing threat conditions. It also has a 12 tube High Speed Directed Launcher (HSDL) smoke screen system using a multi-spectral smoke hardkill providing protection against thermal detection. On 15 April 2004 Raytheon Company was awarded a $64.8 million contract by the Jordan armed forces to upgrade three tank battalions.

Raytheon has been working with Jordan&#x27;s King Abdullah II Design and Development Bureau (KADDB) on its Phoenix Level 1 Independent Fire Control System (IFCS) upgrade and Level 2 Lethality upgrade efforts for the M60 main battle tank. Some of the upgrades included passive spaced armor packages, IR jammers and an ammunition containment system for the turret bustle. A $46.6M contract with the Jordan Armed Forces was authorized in 2012 to upgrade one battalion of their Phoenix main battle tanks.

=== Raytheon M60A3 SLEP ===
Raytheon in conjunction with other partners offered the M60 Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for the M60A3 in May 2016. It has been marketed for export to nations that need the performance improvements to take on modern armor threats. The SLEP is offered as a collection of modular upgrades for the tank&#x27;s firepower, mobility, and protection. This allows for SLEP customization to each user&#x27;s needs. Its firepower improvements features the 120 mm M256 smoothbore main gun as used on the M1A1 Abrams. It is fitted with a load assist system allowing for a firing rate of 6 to 10 rounds per minute and 20 ready-rounds in the turret bustle.

The Raytheon Integrated Fire Control System (IFCS) integrating an eye safe laser rangefinder, second generation gunner&#x27;s night sight, digital ballistic computer, cant sensors, a fully electrical superelevation resolver and a MIL-STD-1553 data bus, giving the system capabilities similar to the M1AD standard. Other turret upgrades offered are the Curtis-Wright Gun Turret Drive and replacing the M19 cupola with a Hitrole remote controlled weapon system, that enables 360° panoramic surveillance from a secure position inside the tank armed with a M2HB .50cal machine gun.

Suspension and mobility upgrades include an upgraded AVCR-1790-2C engine producing 950 hp and improved hydropneumatic suspension. The installation of an Automatic Fire and Explosion Sensing and Suppressing system (AFSS) that improves soldier survivability and protects the engine compartment as standard. Upgraded armor protection with STANAG 4569 Level 6 protection plates to the frontal arc and side skirts and slat armor added to the bustle, protecting the rear of the turret from RPG attack. These changes increased the vehicle weight to 62–63 tons.

=== Leonardo M60A3 SLEP ===

The Leonardo M60A3 is a modular SLEP upgrade for the M60MBT offered in 2017 by the defense company Leonardo DRS. The upgrade is intended to offer nations already operating the M60 a modular upgrade solution for their vehicles to offer capabilities more in line with third-generation main battle tanks. It was unveiled 17 October 2017 at the Bahrain International Defense Exhibition and Conference (BIDEC). It has been marketed as an alternative upgrade to the Raytheon SLEP upgrade for M60MBT modernization.

Upgrades offered in this package include a new 120/45 gun from the Centauro II that offers a weight saving of over the older 120/44 gun due to a redesigned light alloy cradle and muzzle brake. The old commander&#x27;s cupola is completely removed and replaced instead with an armored circular ballistic plate protected with slat armor. This also offers a weight reduction compared to the original M19 cupola as used on the M60A3. For close defense, the turret is also fitted with the HITROLE-L 12.7mm remotely operated weapons system.

The turret has been refitted with a new set of hydraulic and servo control improving performance. The rest of the vehicle is completely overhauled including the torsion bars, brakes, fuel supply, electric system, wheels, seals, paint, and smoke grenades. The vehicle has also been retrofitted with the Automatic Fire and Explosion Sensing and Suppression System (AFSS). It is equipped with the LOTHAR gun sight, DNVS-4 Driver&#x27;s Night Vision Sight and TURMS digital fire control system. a daytime TV camera, and an eye-safe Laser range finder. IED jamming systems and a laser warning receiver systems developed by Leonardo are optionally offered.

Armor improvements include a new passive protection suite fitted around the M60&#x27;s existing cast armor turret and hull that is claimed to meet STANAG Level 6 standards. Protection for the turret is optimized for protection against kinetic energy (KE) weapons and artillery across the frontal arc. The hull is upgraded to the same standard with the protection covering the hull sides extending to the third roadwheel. For the rear of the turret, slat armor is provided with an emphasis on protecting against RPGs.

Mobility is improved via either a full refurbishment of the existing power packs or an upgrade. The new powertrain offered is stated to deliver up to 20% more power without high costs and avoiding the need for any modifications to the existing hull. This AVDS-1790-5T engine replaces the engine and is connected to an upgraded CD-850-B1 transmission. It was unveiled at the Bahrain International Defense Exhibition and Conference (BIDEC) at Manama, Bahrain in 2017.

==US service history==
Fifteen of the early examples of the M60 produced had insufficient hull armor thickness, and were therefore used by the Armor School at Fort Knox to train tank crewmembers and maintenance personnel.
The M60 AVLB and M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle were the only variants of the M60 series deployed to South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The M728 was used in fire support, base security, counter ambush fire, direct assault of fortified positions, and limited reconnaissance by fire. The AVLB provided gap crossing capabilities when required to support armored forces. M60 tanks were deployed to West Germany during the Cold War and participated in annual REFORGER exercises as well as Armed Forces Day parades in West Berlin until 1991. The M60 was also deployed to Korea to support US Forces Korea and participated in bi-annual Exercise Team Spirit maneuvers with South Korea notably with the US 2nd Infantry Division until 1991.

On 12 October 1973, President Nixon authorized Operation Nickel Grass that transferred M60 tanks to support Israel during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. On 21 August 1976, President Ford conferred with Henry Kissinger and green lighted Operation Paul Bunyan with a platoon of M60A1s reinforcing elements of the US 9th Infantry Regiment (Task Force Vierra) at the south end of the Bridge of No Return in response to the Korean axe murder incident.

M60 tanks participated in Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada in 1983. Marines from G Company of the US 22nd Marine Assault Unit equipped with Amphibious Assault Vehicles and four M60A1 tanks landed at Grand Mal Bay on October 25 and relieved the Navy SEALs the following morning, allowing Governor Scoon, his wife, and nine aides to be safely evacuated. The Marine tank crews faced sporadic resistance, knocking out a BRDM-2 armored car. G Company subsequently overwhelmed the Grenadian defenders at Fort Frederick. The 1st Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment deployed with M60A1s to Beirut and were present during the subsequent October 23 Beirut barracks bombing near the Beirut International Airport during the ongoing Lebanese Civil War.
M60s have been historically used for Red Flag exercises, as well as in close air support trials with the F-16 at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada in the 1980s. During Operation Desert Storm in the Gulf War of 1991, at least one US Air Force unit was equipped with M60 tanks. The 401st TFW (P), deployed to Doha, Qatar had two M60A3 tanks for use by explosives ordnance disposal personnel. It was planned that using the tanks would allow the EOD crews to remove unexploded ordnance from tarmac runway and taxiway surfaces with increased safety.

M60A1s of the 1st Marine Division Task Force Ripper led the drive to the Kuwait International Airport on 27 February 1991. The division commander Maj. Gen. J.M. Myatt said, &quot;During the first day of combat operations 1st Platoon, D Company, 3rd Tank Battalion destroyed 15 Iraqi tanks&quot;. The Marines also destroyed 25 APCs and took 300 prisoners of war. The next day, Marine M60A1 tanks encountered a minefield and attempted to proof two lanes with the MCRS. Both were unsuccessful. One MCRS missed a mine, which blew apart a track of the tank pushing it, immobilizing the tank and blocking the lane. The 1st Marine Division encountered more Iraqi opposition as it proceeded north coming into contact with the Iraqi 15th Mechanized Brigade, 3rd Armored Division. During this engagement the Marines destroyed an additional 46 enemy vehicles and took approximately 929 POWs. Once the 1st Marine Division reached Kuwait International Airport they found what remained of the Iraqi 12th Armored Brigade, 3rd Armored Division defending it. The Marines destroyed 30 to 40 Iraqi T-72 tanks which had taken up defensive positions around the airport.
After the conclusion of Operation Desert Storm, FORSCOM withdrew the M60 tank series from combat use and replaced it with the M1A1 Abrams for both the Army and Marine Corps. It was relegated to CONUS use with the Army National Guard through most of the 1990s. In May 1997, at Fort Riley, 1st Battalion, 635th Armor, Kansas Army National Guard, retired the last M60 series tanks in the US military. The 58 M60A3 tanks of the Kansas Guard&#x27;s only armor battalion were unceremoniously parked in a holding pen at the Camp Funston Mobilization and Training Equipment Site (MATES), in the Kansas River Valley, down the hill from Fort Riley&#x27;s main post. They were later transferred to the Jordanian Army. In 1987, it was reported that 10% of the M-60 fleet was inoperable due to counterfeit bolts.

Due to the restructuring of forces at the end of the Cold War, surplus US Army M1A1s were absorbed by the US Marines replacing their M60A1s on a one for one basis, allowing the Marine Corps to quickly become an all-M1 tank force at reduced cost. Except for a small number in TRADOC service for the combat training of units in Europe, most M60s were placed in reserve. Some 1,400 were transferred to NATO allies from 1991 to 1993 under the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and some were sold, mainly to Middle Eastern countries. Tanks were given to a few nations under governmental grants. They were finally declared as excess to US needs in 1994. They were superseded in National Guard service by the M1 version of the Abrams MBT and fully replaced by the M1A1.

After being retired from combat use in 1991, 18 M60A3s, with the M19 cupola removed, continued in active Army service to provide tactical combat training to US and NATO forces in Europe. They were fitted with the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES), given the mission to provide tactical engagement simulation for direct fire force-on-force training and were maintained at the Combat Maneuver Training Center (CMTC) near Hohenfels, Germany. They were used in the OPFOR Surrogate (OPFOR(S)) role by D Company 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment (Team Dragon) until May 2005. After their service as training aids, these examples were demilitarized and placed as target hulks on various firing ranges at the Grafenwoehr Training Area. They were replaced in this role by the Tonka tank (unofficial name) – an M113 OSV-T with a mock turret.

The large number of M60 series tanks still in the Army&#x27;s CONUS inventory in 1994 were declared as excess to requirements and disposal of them began through grant programs or demilitarization at additional costs to the US government. the US Army and Air Force continue to use QM60s on a limited basis as targets for the testing of radar and weapons systems. They are also salvaged for parts to maintain other vehicles still in service. One M60A1 hull was leased to General Dynamics for development of the M60-2000/120S during 2000–2001.
The M68 105 mm Gun has been used for the M1128 Stryker MGS. Many are on public display in parks and museums or veteran service organizations as well as gate guards at military bases. Some 100 M60s are to be placed as artificial reefs off New Jersey and the Gulf coasts of Florida and Alabama accessible to scuba divers. The United States Army TACOM Life Cycle Management Command (TACOM-LCMC) has directed that the M728, M60AVLB and QM60-series target vehicles are to be withdrawn from use and logistical support by 2024 with any units remaining to be demilitarized and sold for scrapping through the DLA Disposition Services Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DLADS-DRMO).

&quot;Additional equipment&quot;
* M9 Bulldozer Kit for the M60 series: (LIN B45390): The M9 bulldozer installed on the M60-series tank will increase the vehicle weight by 4.45 tons (4.04 metric tons). It is used to clear obstacles, leveling ground, filling depressions and to construct fighting positions. It is not to be used for demining activities. It is controlled by the driver.
* M1 Mine Clearing Roller System (MCRS) (LIN M18157): The MCRS is installed on the front of the tank through a removable adapter, and provides the capability for neutralization of Anti-Tank (AT) land mines, which are buried or laid on the surface, in the track path of the vehicle. The MCRS consists of two roller banks with two push arm assemblies. Each roller bank has five rollers, which apply ground pressure higher than that exerted by the tank. This principle ensures the explosion of pressure fused anti tank mines, which would otherwise explode under the track itself. The system weighs about 10 short tons (9.07 metric tons).
*Vehicle Magnetic Signature Duplicator (VEMSID): (LIN V53112) The VEMSID will increase the effectiveness and survivability of countermine equipment by triggering the stand-off detonation of magnetic influence mines at a safe distance ahead of the tank. It generates a multi-axial magnetic signature optimized for passively fused magnetic influence fused mines. The system is made up of four emitter coils, two associated power boxes and a MSD Control Unit (MSDCU).
*Pearson D7 Surface Mine Plow (SMP) (LIN B71620): It is a track-width plow designed to skim the surface of a flat roadway or trail, not to defeat buried mines. It is controlled by the driver.
*Track Width Mine Plow (TWMP) (LIN B71621): The Track Width Mine Plough (TWMP) uses a raking action to clear a safe path by bringing concealed or buried mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to the surface and moving them wide and clear of the vehicle. It can be fitted with a MAD to counter magnetic influence fused mines.
*Full Width Mine Rake (FWMR) (LIN B51986): A rake assembly for unearthing and disposing of buried and surface laid mines in sand and loose earth. It was specifically designed and fabricated for use in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The tank needs to have the M9 Bulldozer Kit or a SMP installed first to employ the rake. It consists of a V-shaped tined plough that performs countermine activities by lifting buried mines with its tines and pushing them to the side as the vehicle moves forward. The FWMR also uses an aluminum skid shoe which protrudes from the front of the tines to allow the rake to maintain a consistent plowing depth. It clears a path measuring 180 inches wide, accommodating heavy tanks and other armored vehicles. Additional features are that it weighs 4000 pounds and is easily assembled and installed.
